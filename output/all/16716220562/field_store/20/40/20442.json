SUMMARY AND FINAL APPEAL  FAREWELL ADDRESS  NIGHT OF MARTYRDOM  DEATH OF THE AUTHOR'S WIFE  LINES, ON READING THE AUTHOR'S FIRST LETTER IN THE SERIES, BY MISS E. R. SNOW    PREFACE.  The Author has, for some time, felt desirous to see the most prominent subjects of the faith of Latter-day Saints brought before the public in continuous order, in one volume.  This series of Letters was called forth by the letter of inquiry prefixed, from the pen of the Rev. William Crowel. This gentleman was at the time, and still is (for ought I know) Editor of \"_The Christian Watchman_,\" Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A.--a leading paper of the Baptist denomination in the United States.  The Editor was also a clergyman of high repute for learning and piety in that denomination of people, and missionary elect to a foreign land. From the elevated standing of this gentleman, and the nature of his inquiries being such as have come from many other distinguished acquaintance, relative to the author's change of views, it seemed wisdom, after consultation with the Prophet and Patriarch (since martyred), to publish a brief reply to his minute and interesting inquiries.  The author was extensively known in the New England and Middle States, as a Preacher of the Baptist denomination. Reference for his character is given to his Excellency George N. Briggs, Governor of the State of Massachusetts, by whom he was once invited to take the pastoral charge of the church where his Excellency resided, and of which he was a member; also to G. Read, Esq., Connecticut, and Eliphalet Nott, D.D., L.L.D., President of Union College, New York, under whose Presidency he graduated in 1824; and also to N. Kendrick D.D., President of Hamilton Literary and Theological College, from whence the author graduated in 1829. The records of both these institutions will show that the author held the FIRST grade of honourable distinction at the time he left them.  These references are not given from vanity, but from the fact that almost every man's character is traduced and villified, the moment he embraces the _faith_ once delivered to the Saints.  The present volume constitutes the third re-print, several thousand copies having been exhausted in a tract form, the present edition, in book form, was repeatedly inquired after.  The edition has been got out in the midst of multiplied engagements. Truth in studied brevity has been aimed at, without seeking the least embellishment of diction.  If there has, in part of the volume, been the appearance of severity towards the religions of modern Christianity, it has been prompted solely by the impulse of truth, in order to demolish error, before the Destroyer of the Gentiles should expose iniquity with irretrievable loss to its victims.  Scripture references have been studiously omitted, believing that honest minds would readily find ample support from the scriptures for all that is contained in this little volume. It is, therefore, commended to the faith and cordial reception of all who desire the salvation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, in sincerity and truth.  ORSON SPENCER.  _Liverpool, January_ 1, 1848.    LETTER FROM THE REV. WILLIAM CROWELL, A. M. TO ORSON SPENCER, A. B.  _Boston, October_ 21, 1842.  MY DEAR SIR,--On the confidence of an old acquaintance and kindly intercourse, I have long wished to address a friendly line to you; for, I am sure, you have not forgotten the pleasant, though brief, interviews which we enjoyed at Middlefield. Since I saw you there, a great change has taken place, as I have been led to believe, in your religious views, and a corresponding one in your relations and circumstances; still, I trust, that you have not forgotten the claims of friendship and acquaintance.  I need not tell you how much I became interested in your family--so young and so full of promise--nor of the strong confidence which I reposed in your piety and conscientious regard for the will of God. I would not allow myself to believe that you would profess what you did not sincerely believe, nor that you would believe without good reasons; still the change in your views excited in me no little surprise. I have, therefore, been desirous to receive from yourself an account of your views, and the reasons of your change. I am also desirous to obtain from one in whom I can confide--one who is acquainted with the facts--and one who is not prejudiced against it at the outset, some account of the faith which you have embraced; of the personal character, doctrines, claims, and influence of him who is called the leader--I mean Joseph Smith.  Does he claim to be inspired? Is he a man of prayer? a man of pure life? a man of peace? Where is he now? Does he appear at the head of his troops as a military commander? What is the nature of the worship among you, and wherein does it differ from that of religious people with whom you have been acquainted elsewhere?  How many inhabitants has the city of Nauvoo? What is their condition, occupations, and general character? What are the dimensions of the Temple, now in course of erection? Do the Mormons suffer much persecution? if so, from whom? Are the children instructed in learning and religion? It would give me great pleasure to learn, also, how you are employed? whether your family are with you? and also your present views of truth and duty, and in what respects they differ from the views which you formerly entertained.  Excuse the number and minuteness of these inquiries. I take an interest in all that affects the welfare of my fellow-men, and especially in what is so important as their religious views and hopes. I am aware that the people, and the views which you have adopted as your own, are peculiarly liable to misrepresentation; but from you I may expect something more impartial. Now, if you do not find the task too great a tax upon your time, I should be much gratified in receiving as full and as speedy an answer to the queries above proposed, with any other information in your possession, as may be convenient to yourself.  It may be gratifying to you, to learn that a powerful revival of religion has been enjoyed in Middlefield, within a few weeks past,--an account of which, Mr. Bestor, the present pastor, has sent to me for publication in _The Christian Watchman,_ a copy of which I send you. I visited the town in the summer, and found your old friends well. I also attended a minister's meeting at Brother Bestor's, and enjoyed a very pleasant interview. Several of the brethren spoke of you in terms of kindness.  My best wishes attend you. Present my regards to Mrs. Spencer, and  Believe me,  Very truly yours,  WILLIAM CROWELL.  P. S.--You will understand that I ask for information for my private benefit and satisfaction. I do not ask for anything to be published, unless you see fit to give it for that purpose. I wish you to write as an old friend.  W. C.    LETTERS IN REPLY BY ORSON SPENCER, A. B.    LETTER I.  GENERAL INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.  _Nauvoo November_ 17, 1842.  My Dear Sir,--I received yours of the 21st ult. about a week since, but many engagements have prevented a more early reply.  Your inquiries were interesting and important, and I only regret that I have not more time and room to answer them as their importance and minuteness demand.  I am not at all surprised that my old friends should wonder at my change of views; even to this day it is marvellous in my own eyes, how I should be separated from my brethren to this (Mormon) faith. I greatly desire to see my Baptist brethren face to face, that I may tell them all things pertaining to my views and this work; but, at present, the care of my wife and six children, with the labours of a civil office, forbids this privilege.  A sheet of paper is a poor conductor of a marvellous and controverted system of theology; but receive this sheet as containing only some broken hints upon which I hope to amplify in some better manner hereafter. You have expressed confidence in my former conscientious regard for the will of God. I thank you for this, because the virtues of many good men have been disallowed upon some supposed forfeiture of public esteem. I thank God that you, and many of the churches where I once laboured, are more liberal.  You, more than common men, know that it is in accordance with all past history, that men's true characters suffer imprisonment, scourging, and death, as soon as they become innovators or seceders from long-established and venerated systems. Many have suffered martyrdom for literary and also religious improvements, to whom after ages have done better justice. \"Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted, and slain them which told before of the coming of the Just One?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],["title","Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#1)"],["body"," was the misfortune of many of the former prophets, that they were raised up at a period of the world when apostacy and corruption rendered their efforts indispensable, although such efforts proved unacceptable to those who were in fault. Ancient prophets, you know, did not merely reiterate what their predecessors had taught, but spoke hidden wisdom, even things that had been kept secret for many generations; because the spirit by which they were moved had knowledge of all truth, and could disclose and reveal as it seemed wisdom in God.  The spirits that were disobedient, while once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, doubtless despised the prophet that taught a universal deluge. But Noah had a special revelation of a deluge, although the religious people of his day counted him an enthusiast. The revelation given to Moses to _gather_ an opprest people to a particular place, was equally one side of, and out of the usual course of former revelations. John came to the literal followers of Abraham and Moses; but he escaped not persecution and death, because he breathed an uncharitable and exclusive spirit towards the existing sects of the day. Still he was a revelator and seer approved of God.  And is it a thing incredible with you, brother, that before the great sabbatic era, world's rest, or millennium, God should raise up a prophet to prepare the people for that event, and the second coming of Jesus Christ? Would it be disagreeable to those who love the unity of Saints, or improbable or unscriptural to expect such a prophet to be possessed with the key of knowledge, or endowed, like Peter, with the _stone_ of revelation? If the many hundred religious sects of this age should hereafter harmonize into one faith and brotherhood, without the aid of special revelations, it would constitute an unparalleled phenomenon. Should they become a bride fit to receive Jesus Christ at his coming, it could not be according to Paul's gospel. For six thousand years, apostles and prophets have constituted an essential part of the spiritual edifice in which God dwells. Paul says it is by them the church is perfected and brought to unity of faith.  I know that you and I have been taught from our childhood, that the church can be perfected without prophets; but where, I ask, is the first scripture to support this view?  As you kindly say, I have always been accustomed to offer a reason for my faith; but be assured I was confounded and made dumb, when asked why I taught another gospel than what Paul did--why I taught that revelation was ended, when Paul did not--or why I taught that prophets were not needed, when no inspired teacher ever taught such a doctrine. Error may become venerable by age, and respectable from the number of its votaries, but neither age nor popularity can ever make it truth.  You give me credit for a conscientious regard for the will of God. It was _this_ that gave me the victory where many others, I fear, are vanquished. The spirit of God wrought mightily in me, commending the ancient gospel to my conscience. I contemplated it with peaceful serenity and joy in believing. Visions and dreams began to illuminate, occasionally, my slumbering moments; but when I allowed my selfish propensities to speak, I cursed Mormonism in my heart, and regretted being in possession of as much light and knowledge as had flowed into my mind from that source. When I preached or conversed according to my best convictions, peace reigned in my heart, and truth enlarged my understanding. Conviction and reverence for the truth, at such times seemed to reign in the hearts of those that heard me; at times, however, some were ready to gnash their teeth, for the truth that they would not receive and could not resist.  I counted the cost, to myself and family, of embracing such views, until I could read it like the child his alphabet, either upward or downward. The expense I viewed through unavoidable tears, both in public and private, by night and by day; I said, however, the Lord He is God, I _can_, I _will_ embrace the truth.  When I considered the weakness of the human mind, and its liability to be deceived, I re-examined and held converse with the most able opposers to Mormonism, in a meek and teachable spirit; but the ease with which many, wearing a high profession of piety, turned aside the force of palpable truth, or leaned on tradition or inextricable difficulties, that they could not solve into harmony with their professions, was very far from dissuading me from my new views. What could I do? Truth had taken possession of my mind--plain, simple, Bible truth. It might be asked if I could not expel it from my door; yes, I _could_ do it; but how would that harmonize with a sincere profession to preach and practice the truth, by way of example to others? It was a crisis I never shall--I never can forget. I remember it as an exodus from parents, kindred, denomination, and temporal support. Has any one ever passed such a crisis, they will say, at least, be careful of Brother Spencer's character and feelings.  Little as I supposed that I cared about popularity, competence, or the fellowship of those who were sincerely in error, when I came to be stretched upon the altar of sacrifice, and the unsheathed blade that was to exscind from all these hung over me with perpendicular exactness; then, then, brother, I cried unto the Lord to strengthen me to pass through the scene with his approbation.  While I was inquiring to know what the Lord would have me to do, many brethren of different denominations warned and exhorted me faithfully; but their warnings consisted very much in a lively exhibition of evils to be endured, if I persisted; or, in other words, they appealed to my selfish nature. But I knew too well that truth should not be abandoned through the force of such appeals, however eloquently urged. Some with whom I conversed, gave glowing descriptions of the obnoxious character of Joseph Smith, and of the contradictory and unscriptural jargon of the Book of Mormon, but it was their misfortune usually to be deplorably ignorant of the true character of either.  Of the truth of this statement many instances might be furnished, if the limits of my sheet would allow. My own solicitude to know the character of Mr. Smith, in order to judge of the doctrines propagated by him, was not so great as that of some others. My aversion to the worship of man, is both educational and religious; but I said boldly, concerning Mr. Smith, that whoever had arranged and harmonized such a system of irresistible truth, has borne good fruit. Some suggested that it would be wisdom to make a personal acquaintance with Mr. Smith, previous to embracing his doctrines; but to me the obligation to receive the truths of heaven seemed absolute, whatever might be the character of Mr. Smith.  I read diligently the Book of Mormon from beginning to end, in close connexion with the comments of Origen Bachelor, Laroy Sunderland, and Dr. Hulburt, together with newspapers and some private letters obtained from the surviving friends of Mr. Spaulding, the supposed author of that book. I arose from its perusal with a strong conviction on my mind, that its pages were graced with the pen of inspiration. I was surprised that so little fault could be found with a book of such magnitude, treating, as it did, of such diversified subjects, through a period of so many generations. It appeared to me, that no enemy to truth or godliness would ever take the least interest in publishing the contents of such a book; such appeared to me to be its godly bearing, sound morality, and harmony with ancient scriptures, that the enemy of all righteousness might as well proclaim the dissolution of his own kingdom, as to spread the contents of such a volume among men; and from that time to this, every effort made by its enemies to demolish, has only shown how invincible a fortress defends it. If no greater breach can be made upon it, than has hitherto been made by those who have attacked it with the greatest animosity and diligence, its overthrow may be considered a forlorn hope. On this subject I only ask the friends of pure religion to read the Book of Mormon with the same unprejudiced, prayerful, and teachable spirit that they would recommend unbelievers in the ancient scriptures to read those sacred records. I have not spoken of the external evidence of the truth of the Book of Mormon, which is now worthy of much consideration; but the internal evidence, I think, will satisfy every honest mind. As you enquire after the reasons that operated to change my mind to the present faith, I only remark that \"Steven's Travels\" had some influence, as an external evidence of the truth of the Book of Mormon.  My present view, after which you also enquire, is, that the evidence, both internal and external, have been multiplied. It may have caused surprise and wonder to many of my respected and distinguished friends in New England, how I could ever renounce a respectable standing in the churches and in the ministry, to adhere to a people so odious in every one's mouth, and so revolting to every one's natural liking; the answer in part is this:--As soon as I discovered an identity in the doctrines of the Latter-day Saints and the Ancient Saints, I enquired whether the treatment bestowed upon each was also similar. I immediately began to dig deep to find the foundation and corner-stone of the true church; I looked at the demeanour and character of those who surrounded the Ancient Saints. The result of my observation seemed to be, that even Jesus Christ had many objectionable points of character to those who observed him. Those who were reputedly most conversant with Abraham, Moses, and other prophets of the Lord, pronounced him unfit for the respect and confidence of a pious community; and why did such men find so many objectionable points in the character and conduct of Jesus Christ? for"]]]
