It would not have been wasted then, my amaranto.  It is not wasted for me. If a shot should strike you--\"  \"Tell her I died loving her with all my soul!\"  cried Ammiani.  Violetta's frame quivered as if he had smitten her.  They left the house.  Countess Ammiani's door was the length of a barricade distant: it swung open to them, like all the other house-doors which were, or wished to be esteemed, true to the cause, and hospitable toward patriots.  \"Remember, when you need a refuge, my villa is on Lago Maggiore,\" Violetta said, and kissed her finger-tips to him.  An hour after, by the light of this unlucky little speech, he thought of her as a shameless coquette.  \"When I need a refuge?  Is not Milan in arms?--Italy alive?  She considers it all a passing epidemic; or, perhaps, she is to plead for me to the king!\"  That set him thinking moodily over the things she had uttered of Vittoria's strange and sudden devotion to the king.  Rainy dawn and the tongues of the churches ushered in the last day of street fighting.  Ammiani found Romara and Colonel Corte at the head of strong bodies of volunteers, well-armed, ready to march for the Porta 'rosa.  All three went straight to the house where the Provisional Government sat, and sword in hand denounced Count Medole as a traitor who sold his country to the king.  Corte dragged him to the window to hear the shouts for the Republic.  Medole wrote their names down one by one, and said, \"Shall I leave the date vacant?\"  They put themselves at the head of their men, and marched in the ringing of the bells.  The bells were their sacro-military music.  Barto Rizzo was off to make a spring at the Porta Ticinese.  Students, peasants, noble youths of the best blood, old men and young women, stood ranged in the drenching rain, eager to face death for freedom.  At mid-day the bells were answered by cannon and the blunt snap of musketry volleys; dull, savage responses, as of a wounded great beast giving short howls and snarls by the interminable over-roaring of a cataract.  Messengers from the gates came running to the quiet centre of the city, where cool men discoursed and plotted. Great news, big lies, were shouted:--Carlo Alberto thundered in the plains; the Austrians were everywhere retiring; the Marshal was a prisoner; the flag of surrender was on the citadel!  These things were for the ears of thirsty women, diplomatists, and cripples.  Countess Ammiani and Countess d'Isorella sat together throughout the agitation of the day.  The life prayed for by one seemed a wisp of straw flung on this humming furnace.  Countess Ammiani was too well used to defeat to believe readily in victory, and had shrouded her head in resignation too long to hope for what she craved.  Her hands were joined softly in her lap.  Her visage had the same unmoved expression when she conversed with Violetta as when she listened to the ravings of the Corso.  Darkness came, and the bells ceased not rolling by her open windows: the clouds were like mists of conflagration.  She would not have the windows closed.  The noise of the city had become familiar and akin to the image of her boy.  She sat there cloaked.  Her heart went like a time-piece to the two interrogations to heaven: \"Alive?--or dead?\"  The voice of Luciano Romara was that of an angel's answering.  He entered the room neat and trim as a cavalier dressed for social evening duty, saying with his fine tact, \"We are all well;\" and after talking like a gazette of the Porta Tosa taken by the volunteers, Barto Rizzo's occupation of the gate opening on the Ticino, and the bursting of the Porta Camosina by the freebands of the plains, he handed a letter to Countess Ammiani.  \"Carlo is on the march to Bergamo and Brescia, with Corte, Sana, and about fifty of our men,\" he said.  \"And is wounded--where?\"  asked Violetta.  \"Slightly in the hand--you see, he can march,\" Romara said, laughing at her promptness to suspect a subterfuge, until he thought, \"Now, what does this mean, madam?\"  A lamp was brought to Countess Ammiani.  She read:       \"MY MOTHER!       \"Cotton-wool on the left fore-finger.  They deigned to give me no      other memorial of my first fight.  I am not worthy of papa's two      bullets.  I march with Corte and Sana to Brescia.  We keep the      passes of the Tyrol.  Luciano heads five hundred up to the hills      to-morrow or next day.  He must have all our money.  Then go from      door to door and beg subscriptions.  Yes, my Chief!  it is to be      like God, and deserving of his gifts to lay down all pride, all      wealth.  This night send to my betrothed in Turin.  She must be with      no one but my mother.  It is my command.  Tell her so.  I hold      imperatively to it.       \"I breathe the best air of life.  Luciano is a fine leader in      action, calm as in a ball-room.  What did I feel?  I will talk of it      with you by-and-by;--my father whispered in my ears; I felt him at      my right hand.  He said, 'I died for this day.'  I feel now that I      must have seen him.  This is imagination.  We may say that anything      is imagination.  I certainly heard his voice.  Be of good heart, my      mother, for I can swear that the General wakes up when I strike      Austrian steel.  He loved Brescia; so I go there.  God preserve my      mother!  The eyes of heaven are wide enough to see us both.      Vittoria by your side, remember!  It is my will.                                               \"CARLO.\"  Countess Ammiani closed her eyes over the letter, as in a dead sleep. \"He is more his father than himself, and so suddenly!\" she said.  She was tearless.  Violetta helped her to her bed-room under the pretext of a desire to hear the contents of the letter.  That night, which ended the five days of battle in Milan, while fires were raging at many gates, bells were rolling over the roof-tops, the army of Austria coiled along the North-eastern walls of the city, through rain and thick obscurity, and wove its way like a vast worm into the outer land.     CHAPTER XXXI  EPISODES OF THE REVOLT AND THE WAR  VITTORIA DISOBEYS HER LOVER  Countess d'Isorella's peculiar mission to Milan was over with the victory of the city.  She undertook personally to deliver Carlo's injunction to Vittoria on her way to the king.  Countess Ammiani deemed it sufficient that her son's wishes should be repeated verbally; and as there appeared to be no better messenger than one who was bound for Turin and knew Vittoria's place of residence, she entrusted the duty to Violetta.  The much which hangs on little was then set in motion:  Violetta was crossing the Ticino when she met a Milanese nobleman who had received cold greeting from the king, and was returning to Milan with word that the Piedmontese declaration of war against Austria had been signed.  She went back to Milan, saw and heard, and gathered a burden for the royal ears.  This was a woman, tender only to the recollection of past days, who used her beauty and her arts as weapons for influence. She liked kings because she saw neither master nor dupe in a republic; she liked her early lover because she could see nothing but a victim in any new one.  She was fond of Carlo, as greatly occupied minds may be attached to an old garden where they have aforetime sown fair seed. Jealousy of a rival in love that was disconnected with political business and her large expenditure, had never yet disturbed the lady's nerves.  At Turin she found Vittoria singing at the opera, and winning marked applause from the royal box.  She thought sincerely that to tear a prima donna from her glory would be very much like dismissing a successful General to his home and gabbling family.  A most eminent personage agreed with her.  Vittoria was carelessly informed that Count Ammiani had gone to Brescia, and having regard for her safety, desired her to go to Milan to be under the protection of his mother, and that Countess Ammiani was willing to receive her.  Now, with her mother, and her maid Giacinta, and Beppo gathered about her, for three weeks Vittoria had been in full operatic career, working, winning fame, believing that she was winning influence, and establishing a treasury.  The presence of her lover in Milan would have called her to the noble city; but he being at Brescia, she asked herself why she should abstain from labours which contributed materially to the strength of the revolution and made her helpful.  It was doubtful whether Countess Ammiani would permit her to sing at La Scala; or whether the city could support an opera in the throes of war.  And Vittoria was sending money to Milan.  The stipend paid to her by the impresario, the jewels, the big bouquets--all flowed into the treasury of the insurrection.  Antonio- Pericles advanced her a large sum on the day when the news of the Milanese uprising reached Turin: the conditions of the loan had simply been that she should continue her engagement to sing in Turin.  He was perfectly slavish to her, and might be trusted to advance more.  Since the great night at La Scala, she had been often depressed by a secret feeling that there was divorce between her love of her country and devotion to her Art.  Now that both passions were in union, both active, each aiding the fire of the other, she lived a consummate life.  She could not have abandoned her path instantly though Carlo had spoken his command to her in person.  Such were her first spontaneous seasonings, and Laura Piaveni seconded them; saying, \"Money, money! we must be Jews for money.  We women are not allowed to fight, but we can manage to contribute our lire and soldi; we can forge the sinews of war.\"  Vittoria wrote respectfully to Countess Ammiani stating why she declined to leave Turin.  The letter was poorly worded.  While"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4440"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 6 (#7)"],["body"," it she had been taken by a sentiment of guilt and of isolation in presuming to disobey her lover.  \"I am glad he will not see it,\" she remarked to Laura, who looked rapidly across the lines, and said nothing.  Praise of the king was in the last sentence.  Laura's eyes lingered on it half-a- minute.  \"Has he not drawn his sword?  He is going to march,\" said Vittoria.  \"Oh, yes,\" Laura replied coolly; \"but you put that to please Countess Ammiani.\"  Vittoria confessed she had not written it purposely to defend the king. \"What harm?\"  she asked.  \"None.  Only this playing with shades allows men to call us hypocrites.\"  The observation angered Vittoria.  She had seen the king of late; she had breathed Turin incense and its atmosphere; much that could be pleaded on the king's behalf she had listened to with the sympathetic pity which can be woman's best judgement, and is the sentiment of reason.  She had also brooded over the king's character, and had thought that if the Chief could have her opportunities for studying this little impressible, yet strangely impulsive royal nature, his severe condemnation of him would be tempered.  In fact, she was doing what makes a woman excessively tender and opinionated; she was petting her idea of the misunderstood one: she was thinking that she divined the king's character by mystical intuition; I will dare to say, maternally apprehended it.  And it was a character strangely open to feminine perceptions, while to masculine comprehension it remained a dead blank, done either in black or in white.  Vittoria insisted on praising the king to Laura.  \"With all my heart,\" Laura said, \"so long as he is true to Italy.\"  \"How, then, am I hypocritical?\"  \"My Sandra, you are certainly perverse.  You admitted that you did something for the sake of pleasing Countess Ammiani.\"  \"I did.  But to be hypocritical one must be false.\"  \"Oh!\"  went Laura.  \"And I write to Carlo.  He does not care for the king; therefore it is needless for me to name the king to him; and I shall not.\"  Laura said, \"Very well.\"  She saw a little deeper than the perversity, though she did not see the springs.  In Vittoria's letter to her lover, she made no allusion to the Sword of Italy.  Countess Ammiani forwarded both letters on to Brescia.  When Carlo had finished reading them, he heard all Brescia clamouring indignantly at the king for having disarmed volunteers on Lago Maggiore and elsewhere in his dominions.  Milan was sending word by every post of the overbearing arrogance of the Piedmontese officers and officials, who claimed a prostrate submission from a city fresh with the ardour of the glory it had won for itself, and that would fain have welcomed them as brothers.  Romara and others wrote of downright visible betrayal.  It was a time of passions;--great readiness for generosity, equal promptitude for undiscriminating hatred.  Carlo read Vittoria's praise of the king with insufferable anguish.  \"You--you part of me, can write like this!\" he struck the paper vehemently.  The fury of action transformed the gentle youth.  Countess Ammiani would not have forwarded the letter addressed to herself had she dreamed the mischief it might do.  Carlo saw double-dealing in the absence of any mention of the king in his own letter.       \"Quit Turin at once,\" he dashed hasty lines to Vittoria; \"and no      'Viva il Re' till we know what he may merit.  Old delusions are      pardonable; but you must now look abroad with your eyes.  Your words      should be the echoes of my soul.  Your acts are mine.  For the sake      of the country, do nothing to fill me with shame.  The king is a      traitor.  I remember things said of him by Agostino; I subscribe to      them every one.  Were you like any other Italian girl, you might cry      for him--who would care!  But you are Vittoria.  Fly to my mother's      arms, and there rest.  The king betrays us.  Is a stronger word      necessary?  I am writing too harshly to you;--and here are the lines      of your beloved letter throbbing round me while I write; but till      the last shot is fired I try to be iron, and would hold your hand      and not kiss it--not be mad to fall between your arms--not wish for      you--not think of you as a woman, as my beloved, as my Vittoria; I      hope and pray not, if I thought there was an ace of work left to do      for the country.  Or if one could say that you cherished a shred of      loyalty for him who betrays it.  Great heaven! am I to imagine that      royal flatteries----- My hand is not my own!  You shall see all that      it writes.  I will seem to you no better than I am.  I do not tell      you to be a Republican, but an Italian.  If I had room for myself in      my prayers--oh! one half-instant to look on you, though with chains      on my limbs.  The sky and the solid ground break up when I think of      you.  I fancy I am still in prison.  Angelo was music to me for two      whole days (without a morning to the first and a night to the      second).  He will be here to-morrow and talk of you again.  I long      for him more than for battle--almost long for you more than for      victory for our Italy.       \"This is Brescia, which my father said he loved better than his      wife.       \"General Paolo Ammiani is buried here.  I was at his tombstone this      morning.  I wish you had known him.       \"You remember, we talked of his fencing with me daily.  'I love the      fathers who do that.' You said it.  He will love you.  Death is the      shadow--not life.  I went to his tomb.  It was more to think of      Brescia than of him.  Ashes are only ashes; tombs are poor places.      My soul is the power.       \"If I saw the Monte Viso this morning, I saw right over your head      when you were sleeping.       \"Farewell to journalism--I hope, for ever.  I jump at shaking off      the journalistic phraseology Agostino laughs at.  Yet I was right in      printing my 'young nonsense.'  I did, hold the truth, and that was      felt, though my vehicle for delivering it was rubbish.       \"In two days Corte promises to sing his song, 'Avanti.' I am at his      left hand.  Venice, the passes of the Adige, the Adda, the Oglio are      ours.  The room is locked; we have only to exterminate the reptiles      inside it.  Romara, D'Arci, Carnischi march to hold the doors.      Corte will push lower; and if I can get him to enter the plains and      join the main army I shall rejoice.\"  The letter concluded with a postscript that half an Italian regiment, with white coats swinging on their bayonet-points, had just come in.  It reached Vittoria at a critical moment.  Two days previously, she and Laura Piaveni had talked with the king. It was an unexpected honour.  Countess, d'Isorella conducted them to the palace.  The lean-headed sovereign sat booted and spurred, his sword across his knees; he spoke with a peculiar sad hopefulness of the prospects of the campaign, making it clear that he was risking more than anyone risked, for his stake was a crown.  The few words he uttered of Italy had a golden ring in them; Vittoria knew not why they had it.  He condemned the Republican spirit of Milan more regretfully than severely. The Republicans were, he said, impracticable.  Beyond the desire for change, they knew not what they wanted.  He did not state that he should avoid Milan in his march.  On the contrary, he seemed to indicate that he was about to present himself to the people of Milan.  \"To act against the enemy successfully, we must act as one, under one head, with one aim.\" He said this, adding that no heart in Italy had yearned more than his own for the signal to march for the Mincio and the Adige.  Vittoria determined to put him to one test.  She summoned her boldness to crave grace for Agostino Balderini to return to Piedmont.  The petition was immediately granted.  Alluding to the libretto of Camilla, the king complimented Vittoria for her high courage on the night of the Fifteenth of the foregoing year.  \"We in Turin were prepared, though we had only then the pleasure of hearing of you,\" he said.  \"I strove to do my best to help.  I wish to serve our cause now,\" she replied, feeling an inexplicable new sweetness running in her blood.  He asked her if she did not know that she had the power to move multitudes.  \"Sire, singing appears so poor a thing in time of war.\"  He remarked that wine was good for soldiers, singing better, such a voice as hers best of all.  For hours after the interview, Vittoria struggled with her deep blushes. She heard the drums of the regiments, the clatter of horses, the bugle- call of assembly, as so many confirmatory notes that it was a royal hero who was going forth.  \"He stakes a crown,\" she said to Laura.  \"Tusk! it tumbles off his head if he refuses to venture something,\" was Laura's response.  Vittoria reproached her for injustice.  \"No,\" Laura said; \"he is like a young man for whom his mother has made a match.  And he would be very much in love with his bride if he were quite certain of winning her, or rather, if she would come a little more than halfway to meet him.  Some young men are so composed.  Genoa and Turin say, 'Go and try.' Milan and Venice say, 'Come and have faith in us.' My opinion is that he is quite as much propelled as attracted.\"  \"This is shameful,\" said Vittoria.  \"No; for I am quite willing to suspend my judgement.  I pray that fortune may bless his arms.  I do think that the stir of a campaign, and a certain amount of success will make him in earnest.\"  \"Can you look on his face and not see pure enthusiasm?\"  \"I see every feminine quality in it, my dear.\"  \"What can it be that he is wanting in?\"  \"Masculine ambition.\"  \"I am not defending him,\" said Vittoria hastily.  \"Not at all; and I am not attacking him.  I can excuse his dread of Republicanism.  I can fancy that there is reason for him just now to fear Republicanism worse than Austria.  Paris and Milan are two grisly phantoms "]]]
