He pretended to accuse his sister of sending them.  She in honest delight accused Lena.  Lena then accused herself of not having done so.  It was winter: Vittoria had been seen in Milan.  Both Lena and Wilfrid spontaneously guessed her to be the guilty one.  He made a funeral pyre of the gifts and gave his sister the ashes, supposing that she had guessed with the same spirited intuition.  It suited Adela to relate this lover's performance to Lena.  \"He did well!\" Lena said, and kissed Adela for the first time.  Adela was the bearer of friendly messages to the poor private in the ranks.  From her and from little Jenna, Wilfrid heard that he was unforgotten by Countess Lena, and new hopes mingled with gratitude caused him to regard his situation seriously.  He confessed to his sister that the filthy fellows, his comrades, were all but too much for him, and asked her to kiss him, that he might feel he was not one of them.  But he would not send a message in reply to Lena.  \"That is also well!\"  Lena said.  Her brother Karl was a favourite with General Pierson.  She proposed that Adela and herself should go to Count Karl, and urge him to use his influence with the General.  This, however, Adela was disinclined to do; she could not apparently say why.  When Lena went to him, she was astonished to hear that he knew every stage of her advance up to the point of pardoning her erratic lover; and even knew as much as that Wilfrid's dejected countenance on the night when Vittoria's marriage was published in the saloon of the duchess on Lake Como, had given her fresh offence.  He told her that many powerful advocates were doing their best for the down-fallen officer, who, if he were shot, or killed, would still be gazetted an officer.  \"A nice comfort!\"  said Lena, and there was a rallying exchange of banter between them, out of which she drew the curious discovery that Karl had one of his strong admirations for the English lady.  \"Surely!\" she said to herself; \"I thought they were all so cold.\"  And cold enough the English lady seemed when Lena led to the theme.  \"Do I admire your brother, Countess Lena?  Oh! yes;--in his uniform exceedingly.\"  Milan was now full.  Wilfrid had heard from Adela that Count Ammiani and his bride were in the city and were strictly watched.  Why did not conspirators like these two take advantage of the amnesty?  Why were they not in Rome?  Their Chief was in Rome; their friends were in Rome.  Why were they here?  A report, coming from Countess d'Isorella, said that they had quarrelled with their friends, and were living for love alone. As she visited the Lenkensteins--high Austrians--some believed her; and as Count Ammiani and his bride had visited the Duchess of Graatli, it was thought possible.  Adela had refused to see Vittoria; she did not even know the house where Count Ammiani dwelt; so Wilfrid was reduced to find it for himself.  Every hour when off duty the miserable sentimentalist wandered in that direction, nursing the pangs of a delicious tragedy of emotions; he was like a drunkard going to his draught.  As soon as he had reached the head of the Corso, he wheeled and marched away from it with a lofty head, internally grinning at his abject folly, and marvelling at the stiff figure of an Austrian common soldier which flashed by the windows as he passed.  He who can unite prudence and madness, sagacity and stupidity, is the true buffoon; nor, vindictive as were his sensations, was Wilfrid unaware of the contrast of Vittoria's soul to his own, that was now made up of antics.  He could not endure the tones of cathedral music; but he had at times to kneel and listen to it, and be overcome.  On a night in the month of February, a servant out of livery addressed him at the barrack-gates, requesting him to go at once to a certain hotel, where his sister was staying.  He went, and found there, not his sister, but Countess Medole.  She smiled at his confusion.  Both she and the prince, she said, had spared no effort to get him reinstated in his rank; but his uncle continually opposed the endeavours of all his friends to serve him.  This interview was dictated by the prince's wish, so that he might know them to be a not ungrateful couple.  Wilfrid's embarrassment in standing before a lady in private soldier's uniform, enabled him with very peculiar dignity to declare that his present degradation, from the General's point of view, was a just punishment, and he did not crave to have it abated.  She remarked that it must end soon. He made a dim allusion to the littleness of humanity.  She laughed. \"It's the language of an unfortunate lover,\" she said, and straightway, in some undistinguished sentence, brought the name of Countess Alessandra Ammiani tingling to his ears.  She feared that she could not be of service to him there; \"at least, not just yet,\" the lady astonished him by remarking.  \"I might help you to see her.  If you take my advice you will wait patiently.  You know us well enough to understand what patience will do.  She is supposed to have married for love.  Whether she did or not, you must allow a young married woman two years' grace.\"  The effect of speech like this, and more in a similar strain of frank corruptness, was to cleanse Wilfrid's mind, and nerve his heart, and he denied that he had any desire to meet the Countess Ammiani, unless he could perform a service that would be agreeable to her.  The lady shrugged.  \"Well, that is one way.  She has enemies, of course.\"  Wilfrid begged for their names.  \"Who are they not?\"  she replied.  \"Chiefly women, it is true.\"  He begged most earnestly for their names; he would have pleaded eloquently, but dreaded that the intonation of one in his low garb might be taken for a whine; yet he ventured to say that if the countess did imagine herself indebted to him in a small degree, the mention of two or three of the names of Countess Alessandra Ammiani's enemies would satisfy him.  \"Countess Lena von Lenkenstein, Countess Violetta d'Isorella, signorina Irma di Karski.\"  She spoke the names out like a sum that she was paying down in gold pieces, and immediately rang the bell for her servant and carriage, as if she had now acquitted her debt.  Wilfrid bowed himself forth. A resolution of the best kind, quite unconnected with his interests or his love, urged him on straight to the house of the Lenkensteins, where he sent up his name to Countess Lena.  After a delay of many minutes, Count Lenkenstein accompanied by General Pierson came down, both evidently affecting not to see him.  The General barely acknowledged his salute.  \"Hey! Kinsky!\" the count turned in the doorway to address him by the title of his regiment; \"here; show me the house inhabited by the Countess d'Isorella during the revolt.\"  Wilfrid followed them to the end of the street, pointing his finger to the house, and saluted.  \"An Englishman did me the favour--from pure eccentricity, of course--to save my life on that exact spot, General,\" said the count.  \"Your countrymen usually take the other side; therefore I mention it.\"  As Wilfrid was directing his steps to barracks (the little stir to his pride superinduced by these remarks having demoralized him), Count Lenkenstein shouted: \"Are you off duty?  \"Wilfrid had nearly replied that he was, but just mastered himself in time.  \"No, indeed!\"  said the count, \"when you have sent up your name to a lady.\"  This time General Pierson put two fingers formally to his cap, and smiled grimly at the private's rigid figure of attention.  If Wilfrid's form of pride had consented to let him take delight in the fact, he would have seen at once that prosperity was ready to shine on him.  He nursed the vexations much too tenderly to give prosperity a welcome; and even when along with Lena, and convinced of her attachment, and glad of it, he persisted in driving at the subject which had brought him to her house; so that the veil of opening commonplaces, pleasant to a couple in their position, was plucked aside.  His business was to ask her why she was the enemy of Countess Alessandra Ammiani, and to entreat her that she should not seek to harm that lady.  He put it in a set speech.  Lena felt that it ought to have come last, not in advance of their reconciliation.  \"I will answer you,\" she said.  \"I am not the Countess Alessandra Ammiani's enemy.\"  He asked her: \"Could you be her friend?\"  \"Does a woman who has a husband want a friend?\"  \"I could reply, countess, in the case of a man who has a bride.\"  By dint of a sweet suggestion here and there, love-making crossed the topic.  It appeared that General Pierson had finally been attacked, on the question of his resistance to every endeavour to restore Wilfrid to his rank, by Count Lenkenstein, and had barely spoken the words--that if Wilfrid came to Countess Lena of his own free-will, unprompted, to beg her forgiveness, he would help to reinstate him, when Wilfrid's name was brought up by the chasseur.  All had laughed, \"Even I,\" Lena confessed. And then the couple had a pleasant petitish wrangle;--he was requested to avow that he had came solely, or principally, to beg forgiveness of her, who had such heaps to forgive.  No; on his honour, he had come for the purpose previously stated, and on the spur of his hearing that she was Countess Alessandra Ammiani's deadly enemy.  \"Could you believe that I was?\" said Lena; \"why should I be?\" and he coloured like a lad, which sign of an ingenuousness supposed to belong to her set, made Lena bold to take the upper hand.  She frankly accused herself of jealousy, though she did not say of whom.  She almost admitted that when the time for reflection came, she should rejoice at his having sought her to plead for his friend rather than for her forgiveness.  In the end, but with a drooping pause of her bright swift look at Wilfrid, she promised to assist him in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4442"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 8 (#2)"],["body","any machinations against Vittoria's happiness, and to keep him informed of Countess d'Isorella's movements.  Wilfrid noticed the withdrawing fire of the look.  \"By heaven!  she doubts me still,\" he ejaculated inwardly.  These half-comic little people have their place in the history of higher natures and darker destinies.  Wilfrid met Pericles, from whom he heard that Vittoria, with her husband's consent, had pledged herself to sing publicly.  \"It is for ze Lombard widows,\" Pericles apologized on her behalf; \"but, do you see, I onnly want a beginning.  She thaerst for ze stage; and it is, after marriage, a good sign.  Oh! you shall hear, my friend; marriage have done her no hurt--ze contrary!  You shall hear Hymen--Cupids--not a cold machine; it is an organ alaif!  She has privily sung to her Pericles, and ser, and if I wake not very late on Judgement. Day, I shall zen hear--but why should I talk poetry to you, to make you laugh?  I have a divin' passion for zat woman.  Do I not give her to a husband, and say, Be happy! onnly sing!  Be kissed! be hugged! onnly give Pericles your voice.  By Saint Alexandre! it is to say to ze heavens, Move on your way, so long as you drop rain on us r--you smile--you look kind.\"  Pericles accompanied him into a caffe, the picture of an enamoured happy man.  He waived aside contemptuously all mention of Vittoria's having enemies.  She had them when, as a virgin, she had no sense.  As a woman, she had none, for she now had sense.  Had she not brought her husband to be sensible, so that they moved together in Milanese society, instead of stupidly fighting at Rome? so that what he could not take to himself--the marvellous voice--he let bless the multitude!  \"She is the Beethoven of singers,\" Pericles concluded.  Wilfrid thought so on the night when she sang to succour the Lombard widows.  It was at a concert, richly thronged; ostentatiously thronged with Austrian uniforms.  He fancied that he could not bear to look on her.  He left the house thinking that to hear her and see her and feel that she was one upon the earth, made life less of a burden.  This evening was rendered remarkable by a man's calling out, \"You are a traitress!\" while Vittoria stood before the seats.  She became pale, and her eyelids closed.  No thinness was subsequently heard in her voice. The man was caught as he strove to burst through the crowd at the entrance-door, and proved to be a petty bookseller of Milan, by name Sarpo, known as an orderly citizen.  When taken he was inflamed with liquor.  Next day the man was handed from the civil to the military authorities, he having confessed to the existence of a plot in the city. Pericles came fuming to Wilfrid's quarters.  Wilfrid gathered from him that Sarpo's general confession had been retracted: it was too foolish to snare the credulity of Austrian officials.  Sarpo stated that he had fabricated the story of a plot, in order to escape the persecutions of a terrible man, and find safety in prison lodgings vender Government. The short confinement for a civic offence was not his idea of safety; he desired to be sheltered by Austrian soldiers and a fortress, and said that his torments were insupportable while Barto Rizzo was at large. This infamous Republican had latterly been living in his house, eating his bread, and threatening death to him unless he obeyed every command. Sarpo had undertaken his last mission for the purpose of supplying his lack of resolution to release himself from his horrible servitude by any other means; not from personal animosity toward the Countess Alessandra Ammiani, known as la Vittoria.  When seized, fear had urged him to escape.  Such was his second story.  The points seemed irreconcilable to those who were not in the habit of taking human nature into their calculations of a possible course of conduct; even Wilfrid, though he was aware that Barto Rizzo hated Vittoria inveterately, imagined Sarpo's first lie to have necessarily fathered a second.  But the second story was true: and the something like lover's wrath with which the outrage to Vittoria fired Pericles, prompted him to act on it as truth.  He told Wilfrid that he should summon Barto Rizzo to his presence.  As the Government was unable to exhibit so much power, Wilfrid looked sarcastic; whereupon Pericles threw up his chin crying: \"Oh! you shall know my resources.  Now, my friend, one bit of paper, and a messenger, and zen home to my house, to Tokay and cigarettes, and wait to see.\"  He remarked after pencilling a few lines, \"Countess d'Isorella is her enemy? hein!\"  \"Why, you wouldn't listen to me when I told you,\" said Wilfrid.  \"No,\" Pericles replied while writing and humming over his pencil; \"my ear is a pelican-pouch, my friend; it--and Irma is her enemy also?--it takes and keeps, but does not swallow till it wants.  I shall hear you, and I shall hear my Sandra Vittoria, and I shall not know you have spoken, when by-and-by I tinkle, tinkle, a bell of my brain, and your word walks in,-- 'quite well?'--'very well!  '--sit down'--'if it is ze same to you, I prefer to stand'--'good; zen I examine you.'  My motto:--'Time opens ze gates: my system: 'it is your doctor of regiment's system when your twelve, fifteen, forty recruits strip to him:--'Ah! you, my man, have varicose vein: no soldier in our regiment, you!'  So on.  Perhaps I am not intelligible; but, hear zis.  I speak not often of my money; but I say--it is in your ear--a man of millions, he is a king!\"  The Greek jumped up and folded a couple of notes.  \"I will not have her disturbed. Let her sing now and awhile to Pericles and his public: and to ze Londoners, wiz your permission, Count Ammiani, one saison.  I ask no more, and I am satisfied, and I endow your oldest child, signor Conte--it is said!  For its mama was a good girl, a brave girl; she troubled Pericles, because he is an intellect; but he forgives when he sees sincerity--rare zing!  Sincerity and genius: it may be zey are as man and wife in a bosom.  He forgives; it is not onnly voice he craves, but a soul, and Sandra, your countess, she has a soul--I am not a Turk.  I say, it is a woman in whom a girl I did see a soul!  A woman when she is married, she is part of ze man; but a soul, it is for ever alone, apart, confounded wiz nobody!  For it I followed Sandra, your countess.  It was a sublime devotion of a dog.  Her voice tsrilled, her soul possessed me, Your countess is my Sandra still.  I shall be pleased if child-bearing trouble her not more zan a very little; but, enfin! she is married, and you and I, my friend Wilfrid, we must accept ze decree, and say, no harm to her out of ze way of nature, by Saint Nicolas! or any what saint you choose for your invocation.  Come along.  And speed my letters by one of your militaires at once off.  Are Pericles' millions gold of bad mint? If so, he is an incapable.  He presumes it is not so.  Come along; we will drink to her in essence of Tokay.  You shall witness two scenes. Away!\"  Wilfrid was barely to be roused from his fit of brooding into which Pericles had thrown him.  He sent the letters, and begged to be left to sleep.  The image of Vittoria seen through this man's mind was new, and brought a new round of torments.  \"The devil take you,\" he cried when Pericles plucked at his arm, \"I've sent the letters; isn't that enough?\" He was bitterly jealous of the Greek's philosophic review of the conditions of Vittoria's marriage; for when he had come away from the concert, not a thought of her being a wife had clouded his resignation to the fact.  He went with Pericles, nevertheless, and was compelled to acknowledge the kindling powers of the essence of Tokay.  \"Where do you get this stuff?\"  he asked several times.  Pericles chattered of England, and Hagar's 'Addio,' and 'Camilla.'  What cabinet operas would he not give!  What entertainments!  Could an emperor offer such festivities to his subjects?  Was a Field Review equal to Vittoria's voice?  He stung Wilfrid's ears by insisting on the mellowed depth, the soft human warmth, which marriage had lent to the voice.  At a late hour his valet announced Countess d'Isorella.  \"Did I not say so?\"  cried Pericles, and corrected himself: \"No, I did not say so; it was a surprise to you, my friend.  You shall see; you shall hear.  Now you shall see what a friend Pericles can be when a person satisfy him.\"  He pushed Wilfrid into his dressing-room, and immediately received the countess with an outburst of brutal invectives--pulling her up and down the ranked regiment of her misdeeds, as it were.  She tried dignity, tried anger, she affected amazement, she petitioned for the heads of his accusations, and, as nothing stopped him, she turned to go.  Pericles laughed when she had left the room.  Irma di Karski was announced the next minute, and Countess d'Isorella re-appeared beside her.  Irma had a similar greeting.  \"I am lost,\" she exclaimed. \"Yes, you are lost,\" said Pericles; \"a word from me, and the back of the public is humped at you--ha! contessa, you touched Mdlle. Irma's hand? She is to be on her guard, and never to think she is lost till down she goes?  You are a more experienced woman!  I tell you I will have no nonsense.  I am Countess Alessandra Ammiani's friend.  You two, you women, are her enemies.  I will ruin you both.  You would prevent her singing in public places--you, Countess d'Isorella, because you do not forgive her marriage to Count Ammiani; you, Irma, to spite her for her voice.  You would hiss her out of hearing, you two miserable creatures. Not another soldo for you!  Not one! and to-morrow, countess, I will see my lawyer.  Irma, begone, and shriek to your wardrobe!\"  \"Countess d'Isorella, I have the extreme honour.\"  Wilfrid marvelled to hear this titled and lovely woman speaking almost in tones of humility in reply to such outrageous insolence.  She craved a private interview.  Irma was temporarily expelled, and then Violetta stooped"]]]
