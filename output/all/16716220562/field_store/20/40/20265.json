THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF PARLEY PARKER PRATT ========================================  ONE OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS,  EMBRACING THE LIFE, MINISTRY AND TRAVELS, WITH EXTRACTS, IN PROSE AND VERSE, FROM HIS MISCELLANEOUS WRITINGS.  EDITED BY HIS SON, PARLEY P. PRATT.  \"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and _their works do follow them_.\"--Rev. xiv. 13.  Chicago: Published for Pratt Bros. by Law, King & Law  1888  Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, By Parley P. Pratt, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington.   Preface ------------------------  In publishing this volume I am discharging a duty solemnly imposed upon me by my lamented father, just before his departure on his last mission to the United States.  It affords me great pleasure to present the Autobiography of the late Author to his relatives, his numerous friends, and to the general reader.  The writer is well and favorably known through his \"Voice of Warning,\" his \"Key to Theology,\" and other productions of his pen, as well as through his personal labors. He was one of the first Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, having been called by revelation and ordained to that office by the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He was intimately associated with the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, with Presidents B. Young and H. C. Kimball, and other leading men, almost from the first rise of the Church: his history, therefore, was so interwoven with that of the Church, that many of the most interesting sketches of Church history will be found therein.  The following pages, which embrace his life, ministry and travels, and some of his best miscellaneous writings in prose and verse, are the productions of his own pen.  He spared no pains to make the work a reliable record, and one that would be acceptable to all lovers of truth. It is written in the author's happiest style. He was an early pioneer of the Great West, and travelled extensively in different countries.  His life was one of indefatigable labor, varied and complicated, crowded with public labors and responsibilities, and full of strange and extraordinary events--a life mingled with the extremes of joy and sorrow--or, in the writer's own words, \"a truly eventful one.\"  With confidence and satisfaction I submit this work to the reader, feeling assured that it will stand upon its own merits. I also have an earnest and sincere desire that it may be the means, through the blessing of God, of accomplishing much good.  In editing the work I have been kindly assisted by the author's personal friend, Elder John Taylor, to whom I feel deeply indebted.  The work embraces a period of history of fifty years--from the author's boyhood to the time of his betrayal, by apostates, into the hands of his enemies, and martyrdom.  The writer, in his second preface to his \"Voice of Warning,\" in 1846, gave expression to the following sentiment: \"Should the author be called to sacrifice his life for the cause of truth, he will have the consolation that it will be said of him, as it was said of Abel, '_He being dead yet speaketh_.'\"  Editor.  Salt Lake City, _Dec., 1873_   To the Public ------------------------  The circumstances attending the death of our beloved and much esteemed Apostle, Parley Parker Pratt, rendered it impossible for him to complete and prepare for publication the work in which he had for many years been engaged, which is now presented to the public.  The general history and incidents were recorded in various forms of manuscript, some in book form, some in loose leaves, whilst others were extracts from the \"Millennial Star\" and other publications, yet they needed collating and revising preparatory to their publication.  The deceased, as appears above, had laid upon his eldest son, P. P. Pratt, the responsibility of publishing his history in case anything should happen to prevent himself from doing it.  At the solicitation of Brother Pratt I undertook the task of assisting to collate and revise the work preparatory to publication. I found, as I expected it to be, quite an undertaking. But, as Bro. Parley brought the gospel to and baptized me, and as I have always entertained for him the most profound regard, I esteemed it a duty, due alike to gratitude and respect, to assist in having him properly presented before the community.  In the revision the changes are very few and unimportant, the meaning being rigidly adhered to, and the original, so far as possible, preserved intact. His doctrines and general views are left unchanged, as he was always considered sound in doctrinal points.  The multitudinous reminiscences manifested in his eventful life exhibit a true and living faith in God and his religion--an honesty of purpose, an inflexible will, and an unflagging, indefatigable industry and perseverance. He possessed a comprehensive mind, coupled with a sound judgment. He manifested an indomitable fortitude under the most trying circumstances, and in adversity and trials, as well as in prosperity, exhibited an example worthy of praise and emulation. He was indeed a true Latter-Day Saint, an honorable Apostle, a good and kind husband, an affectionate father, a true friend, and an honest man.  From various premonitions which he had during his last visit with me in New York, I was satisfied that, when I took my last sad leave of him in that city, I should never see his face again in the flesh. These presentiments were but too speedily and sadly fulfilled. He has gone--but has left a name and a fame that will live throughout time and burst forth in eternity; and in the morning of the first resurrection, when the opening heavens shall reveal the Son of God, and he shall proclaim, \"I am the resurrection and the life,\" when Death shall deliver up the dead, I expect to meet Bro. Parley in the resurrection of just.  John Taylor.
