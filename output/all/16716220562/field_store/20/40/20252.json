The homes of these unfortunate people were ravaged by influenza and many died.  Prices at the stores mounted higher. Most of the gardens had been lying idle. The farmers had found it hard to get help. Some of the latter, indeed, had decided that they could make more by teaming at Millerton than by toiling in the fields, and with less effort. They left the boys and the women to do what they could with the crops. Naturally the latter were small. So the local sources of supply had little to offer and the demand upon the stores steadily increased. Certain of the merchants had been, in a way, spoiled by prosperity. They were rather indifferent to complaints and demands. Many of the storekeepers, irritated, doubtless, by overwork, had lost their former politeness. The two butchers, having prospered beyond their hopes, began to feel the need of rest. They cut down their hours of labor and reduced their stocks and raised their prices. There were days when their supplies failed to arrive. The railroad service had been bad enough in times of peace. Now, it was worse than ever.   Those who had plenty of money found it difficult to get a sufficient quantity of good food, Bingville being rather cut off from other centers of life by distance and a poor railroad. Some drove sixty miles to Hazelmead to do marketing for themselves and their neighbors.  Mr. and Mrs. J. Patterson Bing, however, in their luxurious apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, knew little of these conditions until Mr. Bing came up late in March for a talk with the mill superintendent. Many of the sick and poor suffered extreme privation. Father O'Neil and the Reverend Otis Singleton of the Congregational Church went among the people, ministering to the sick, of whom there were very many, and giving counsel to men and women who were unaccustomed to prosperity and ill-qualified wisely to enjoy it. One day, Father O'Neil saw the Widow Moran coming into town with a great bundle of fagots on her back.  \"This looks a little like the old country,\" he remarked.  She stopped and swung her fagots to the ground and announced: \"It do that an' may God help us! It's hard times, Father. In spite o' all the money, it's hard times. It looks like there wasn't enough to go 'round--the ships be takin' so many things to the old country.\"  \"How is my beloved Shepherd?\" the good Father asked.  \"Mother o' God! The house is that cold, he's been layin' abed for a week an' Judge Crooker has been away on the circuit.\"  \"Too bad!\" said the priest. \"I've been so busy with the sick and the dying and the dead I have hardly had time to think of you.\"  Against her protest, he picked up the fagots and carried them on his own back to her kitchen.  He found the Shepherd in a sweater sitting up in bed and knitting socks.  \"How is my dear boy?\" the good Father asked.  \"Very sad,\" said the Shepherd. \"I want to do something to help and my legs are useless.\"  \"Courage!\" Mr. Bloggs seemed to shout from his shelf at the window-side and just then he assumed a most valiant and determined look as he added: \"Forward! march!\"  Father O'Neil did what he could to help in that moment of peril by saying:  \"Cheer up, boy. I'm going out to Dan Mullin's this afternoon and I'll make him bring you a big load of wood. I'll have you back at your work to-morrow. The spring will be coming soon and your flock will be back in the garden.\"   It was not easy to bring a smile to the face of the little Shepherd those days. A number of his friends had died and others were sick and he was helpless. Moreover, his mother had told him of the disappearance of Pauline and that her parents feared she was in great trouble. This had worried him, and the more because his mother had declared that the girl was probably worse than dead. He could not quite understand it and his happy spirit was clouded. The good Father cheered him with merry jests. Near the end of their talk the boy said: \"There's one thing in this room that makes me unhappy. It's that gold piece in the drawer. It does nothing but lie there and shiver and talk to me. Seems as if it complained of the cold. It says that it wants to move around and get warm. Every time I hear of some poor person that needs food or fuel, it calls out to me there in the little drawer and says, 'How cold I am! How cold I am!' My mother wishes me to keep it for some time of trouble that may come to us, but I can't. It makes me unhappy. Please take it away and let it do what it can to keep the poor people warm.\"  \"Well done, boys!\" Mr. Bloggs seemed to say with a look of joy as if he now perceived that the enemy was in full retreat.  \"There's no worse company, these days, than a hoarded coin,\" said the priest. \"I won't let it plague you any more.\"  Father O'Neil took the coin from the drawer. It fell from his fingers with a merry laugh as it bounded on the floor and whirled toward the doorway like one overjoyed and eager to be off.  \"God bless you, my boy! May it buy for you the dearest wish of your heart.\"  \"Ha ha!\" laughed the little tin soldier for he knew the dearest wish of the boy far better than the priest knew it.  Mr. Singleton called soon after Father O'Neil had gone away.  \"The top of the morning to you!\" he shouted, as he came into Bob's room.  \"It's all right top and bottom,\" Bob answered cheerfully.  \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" the minister went on. \"I'm a regular Santa Claus this morning. I've got a thousand dollars that Mr. Bing sent me. It's for any one that needs help.\"  \"We'll be all right as soon as our load of wood comes. It will be here to-morrow morning,\" said the Shepherd.  \"I'll come and cut and split it for you,\" the minister proposed. \"The eloquence of the axe is better than that of the tongue these days. Meanwhile, I'm going to bring you a little jag in my wheelbarrow. How about beefsteak and bacon and eggs and all that?\"  \"I guess we've got enough to eat, thank you.\" This was not quite true, for Bob, thinking of the sick, whose people could not go to market, was inclined to hide his own hunger.  \"Ho, ho!\" exclaimed Mr. Bloggs, for he knew very well that the boy was hiding his hunger.  \"Do you call that a lie?\" the Shepherd asked as soon as the minister had gone.  \"A little one! But in my opinion it don't count,\" said Mr. Bloggs. \"You were thinking of those who need food more than you and that turns it square around. I call it a golden lie--I do.\"  The minister had scarcely turned the corner of the street, when he met Hiram Blenkinsop, who was shivering along without an overcoat, the dog Christmas at his heels.  Mr. Singleton stopped him.  \"Why, man! Haven't you an overcoat?\" he asked.  \"No, sir! It's hangin' on a peg in a pawn-shop over in Hazelmead. It ain't doin' the peg any good nor me neither!\"  \"Well, sir, you come with me,\" said the minister. \"It's about dinner time, anyway, and I guess you need lining as well as covering.\"  The drunkard looked into the face of the minister.  \"Say it ag'in,\" he muttered.  \"I wouldn't wonder if a little food would make you feel better,\" Mr. Singleton added.  \"A little, did ye say?\" Blenkinsop asked.  \"Make it a lot--as much as you can accommodate.\"  \"And do ye mean that ye want me to go an' eat in yer house?\"  \"Yes, at my table--why not?\"  \"It wouldn't be respectable. I don't want to be too particular but a tramp must draw the line somewhere.\"  \"I'll be on my best behavior. Come on,\" said the minister.  The two men hastened up the street followed by the dejected little yellow dog, Christmas.  Mrs. Singleton and her daughter were out with a committee of the Children's Helpers and the minister was dining alone that day and, as usual, at one o'clock, that being the hour for dinner in the village of Bingville.  \"Tell me about yourself,\" said the minister as they sat down at the table.  \"Myself--did you say?\" Hiram Blenkinsop asked as one of his feet crept under his chair to conceal its disreputable appearance, while his dog had partly hidden himself under a serving table where he seemed to be shivering with apprehension as he peered out, with raised hackles, at the stag's head over the mantel.  \"Yes.\"  \"I ain't got any _Self_, sir; it's all gone,\" said Blenkinsop, as he took a swallow of water.  \"A man without any Self is a curious creature,\" the minister remarked.  \"I'm as empty as a woodpecker's hole in the winter time. The bird has flown. I belong to this 'ere dog. He's a poor dog. I'm all he's got. If he had to pay a license on me I'd have to be killed. He's kind to me. He's the only friend I've got.\"  Hiram Blenkinsop riveted his attention upon an old warming-pan that hung by the fireplace. He hardly looked at the face of the minister.  \"How did you come to lose your Self?\" the latter asked.  \"Married a bad woman and took to drink. A man's Self can stand cold an' hunger an' shipwreck an' loss o' friends an' money an' any quantity o' bad luck, take it as it comes, but a bad woman breaks the works in him an' stops his clock dead. Leastways, it done that to me!\"  \"She is like an arrow in his liver,\" the minister quoted. \"Mr. Blenkinsop, where do you stay nights?\"  \"I've a shake-down in the little loft over the ol' blacksmith shop on Water Street. There are cracks in the gable, an' the snow an' the wind blows in, an' the place is dark an' smells o' coal gas an' horses' feet, but Christmas an' I snug up together an' manage to live through the winter. In hot weather, we sleep under a tree in the ol' graveyard an' study astronomy. Sometimes, I wish I was there for good.\"  \"Wouldn't you like a bed in a comfortable house?\"  \"No. I couldn't take the dog there an' I'd have to git up like other folks.\"  \"Would you think that a hardship?\"  \"Well, ye see, sir, if ye're layin' down ye ain't hungry. Then, too, I likes to dilly-dally in bed.\"  \"What may that mean?\" the minister asked.  \"I likes to lay an'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44796"],["title","The Prodigal Village: A Christmas Tale (#7)"],["body"," an' build air castles.\"  \"What kind of castles?\"  \"Well, sir, I'm thinkin' often o' a time when I'll have a grand suit o' clothes, an' a shiny silk tile on my head, an' a roll o' bills in my pocket, big enough to choke a dog, an' I'll be goin' back to the town where I was brought up an' I'll hire a fine team an' take my ol' mother out for a ride. An' when we pass by, people will be sayin': 'That's Hiram Blenkinsop! Don't you remember him? Born on the top floor o' the ol' sash mill on the island. He's a multi-millionaire an' a great man. He gives a thousand to the poor every day. Sure, he does!'\"  \"Blenkinsop, I'd like to help you to recover your lost Self and be a useful and respected citizen of this town,\" said Mr. Singleton. \"You can do it if you will and I can tell you how.\"  Tears began to stream down the cheeks of the unfortunate man, who now covered his eyes with a big, rough hand.  \"If you will make an honest effort, I'll stand by you. I'll be your friend through thick and thin,\" the minister added. \"There's something good in you or you wouldn't be having a dream like that.\"  \"Nobody has ever talked to me this way,\" poor Blenkinsop sobbed. \"Nobody but you has ever treated me as if I was human.\"  \"I know--I know. It's a hard old world, but at last you've found a man who is willing to be a brother to you if you really want one.\"  The poor man rose from the table and went to the minister's side and held out his hand.  \"I do want a brother, sir, an' I'll do anything at all,\" he said in a broken voice.  \"Then come with me,\" the minister commanded. \"First, I'm going to improve the outside of you.\"  When they were ready to leave the house, Blenkinsop and his dog had had a bath and the former was shaved and in clean and respectable garments from top to toe.  \"You look like a new man,\" said Mr. Singleton.  \"Seems like, I felt more like a proper human bein',\" Blenkinsop answered.  Christmas was scampering up and down the hall as if he felt like a new dog. Suddenly he discovered the stag's head again and slunk into a dark corner growling.  \"A bath is a good sort of baptism,\" the minister remarked. \"Here's an overcoat that I haven't worn for a year. It's fairly warm, too. Now if your Old Self should happen to come in sight of you, maybe he'd move back into his home. I remember once that we had a canary bird that got away. We hung his cage in one of the trees out in the yard with some food in it. By and by, we found him singing on the perch in his little home. Now, if we put some good food in the cage, maybe your bird will come back. Our work has only just begun.\"  They went out of the door and crossed the street and entered the big stone Congregational Church and sat down together in a pew. A soft light came through the great jeweled windows above the altar, and in the clearstory, and over the organ loft. They were the gift of Mr. Bing. It was a quiet, restful, beautiful place.  \"I used to stand in the pulpit there and look down upon a crowd of handsomely dressed people,\" said Mr. Singleton in a low voice. \"'There is something wrong about this,' I thought. 'There's too much respectability here. There are no flannel shirts and gingham dresses in the place. I can not see half a dozen poor people. I wish there was some ragged clothing down there in the pews. There isn't an out-and-out sinner in the crowd. Have we set up a little private god of our own that cares only for the rich and respectable?' I asked myself. 'This is the place for Hiram Blenkinsop and old Bill Lang and poor Lizzie Quesnelle, if they only knew it. Those are the kind of people that Jesus cared most about.' They're beginning to come to us now and we are glad of it. I want to see you here every Sunday after this. I want you to think of this place as your home. If you really wish to be my brother, come with me.\"  Blenkinsop trembled with strange excitement as he went with Mr. Singleton down the broad aisle, the dog Christmas following meekly. Man and minister knelt before the altar. Christmas sat down by his master's side, in a prayerful attitude, as if he, too, were seeking help and forgiveness.  \"I feel better inside an' outside,\" said Blenkinsop as they were leaving the church.  \"When you are tempted, there are three words which may be useful to you. They are these, 'God help me,'\" the minister told him. \"They are quickly said and I have often found them a source of strength in time of trouble. I am going to find work for you and there's a room over my garage with a stove in it which will make a very snug little home for you and Christmas.\"   That evening, as the dog and his master were sitting comfortably by the stove in their new home, there came a rap at the door. In a moment, Judge Crooker entered the room.  \"Mr. Blenkinsop,\" said the Judge as he held out his hand, \"I have heard of your new plans and I want you to know that I am very glad. Every one will be glad.\"  When the Judge had gone, Blenkinsop put his hand on the dog's head and asked with a little laugh: \"Did ye hear what he said, Christmas? He called me _Mister_. Never done that before, no sir!\"  Mr. Blenkinsop sat with his head upon his hand listening to the wind that whistled mournfully in the chimney. Suddenly he shouted: \"Come in!\"  The door opened and there on the threshold stood his Old Self.  It was not at all the kind of a Self one would have expected to see. It was, indeed, a very youthful and handsome Self--the figure of a clear-eyed, gentle-faced boy of about sixteen with curly, dark hair above his brows.  Mr. Blenkinsop covered his face and groaned. Then he held out his hands with an imploring gesture.  \"I know you,\" he whispered. \"Please come in.\"  \"Not yet,\" the young man answered, and his voice was like the wind in the chimney. \"But I have come to tell you that I, too, am glad.\"  Then he vanished.  Mr. Blenkinsop arose from his chair and rubbed his eyes.  \"Christmas, ol' boy, I've been asleep,\" he muttered. \"I guess it's time we turned in!\"     CHAPTER FOUR  IN WHICH MR. ISRAEL SNEED AND OTHER WORKING MEN RECEIVE A LESSON IN TRUE DEMOCRACY   Next morning, Mr. Blenkinsop went to cut wood for the Widow Moran. The good woman was amazed by his highly respectable appearance.  \"God help us! Ye look like a lawyer,\" she said.  \"I'm a new man! Cut out the blacksmith shop an' the booze an' the bummers.\"  \"May the good God love an' help ye! I heard about it.\"  \"Ye did?\"  \"Sure I did. It's all over the town. Good news has a lively foot, man. The Shepherd clapped his hands when I told him. Ye got to go straight, my laddie buck. All eyes are on ye now. Come up an' see the boy. It's his birthday!\"  Mr. Blenkinsop was deeply moved by the greeting of the little Shepherd, who kissed his cheek and said that he had often prayed for him.  \"If you ever get lonely, come and sit with me and we'll have a talk and a game of dominoes,\" said the boy.  Mr. Blenkinsop got strength out of the wonderful spirit of Bob Moran and as he swung his axe that day, he was happier than he had been in many years. Men and women who passed in the street said, \"How do you do, Mr. Blenkinsop? I'm glad to see you.\"  Even the dog Christmas watched his master with a look of pride and approval. Now and then, he barked gleefully and scampered up and down the sidewalk.  The Shepherd was fourteen years old. On his birthday, from morning until night, people came to his room bringing little gifts to remind him of their affection. No one in the village of Bingville was so much beloved. Judge Crooker came in the evening with ice-cream and a frosted cake. While he was there, a committee of citizens sought him out to confer with him regarding conditions in Bingville.  \"There's more money than ever in the place, but there never was so much misery,\" said the chairman of the committee.  \"We have learned that money is not the thing that makes happiness,\" Judge Crooker began. \"With every one busy at high wages, and the banks overflowing with deposits, we felt safe. We ceased to produce the necessaries of life in a sufficient quantity. We forgot that the all important things are food, fuel, clothes and comfortable housing--not money. Some of us went money mad. With a feeling of opulence we refused to work at all, save when we felt like it. We bought diamond rings and sat by the fire looking at them. The roofs began to leak and our plumbing went wrong. People going to buy meat found the shops closed. Roofs that might have been saved by timely repairs will have to be largely replaced. Plumbing systems have been ruined by neglect. With all its money, the town was never so poverty-stricken, the people never so wretched.\"  Mr. Sneed, who was a member of the committee, slyly turned the ring on his finger so that the diamond was concealed. He cleared his throat and remarked, \"We mechanics had more than we could do on work already contracted.\"  \"Yes, you worked eight hours a day and refused to work any longer. You were legally within your rights, but your position was ungrateful and even heartless and immoral. Suppose there were a baby coming at your house and you should call for the doctor and he should say, 'I'm sorry, but I have done my eight hours' work to-day and I can't help you.' Then suppose you should offer him a double fee and he should say, 'No, thanks, I'm tired. I've got forty thousand dollars in the bank and I don't have to work when I don't want to.'  \"Or suppose I were trying a case for you and, when my eight hours' work had expired, I should walk out of the court and leave your case to take care of itself. What do you suppose would become of it? Yet that is exactly what you did to my pipes. You left them to take care of themselves. You men, who use your hands, make a great mistake in thinking that you are the workers of the country and that the rest of us are your natural enemies. In America, we are all workers! The idle man is a mere parasite and not at heart an American. Generally, I work fifteen hours a day.  \"This little "]]]
