The horses were generally very strong, formed much like the Norman horse, and with very heavy manes and tails.  A number of officers supplied themselves with these, and they generally rendered as useful service as the northern animal in fact they were much better when grazing was the only means of supplying forage.  There was no need for haste, and some months were consumed in the necessary preparations for a move.  In the meantime the army was engaged in all the duties pertaining to the officer and the soldier.  Twice, that I remember, small trains were sent from Corpus Christi, with cavalry escorts, to San Antonio and Austin, with paymasters and funds to pay off small detachments of troops stationed at those places.  General Taylor encouraged officers to accompany these expeditions.  I accompanied one of them in December, 1845.  The distance from Corpus Christi to San Antonio was then computed at one hundred and fifty miles. Now that roads exist it is probably less.  From San Antonio to Austin we computed the distance at one hundred and ten miles, and from the latter place back to Corpus Christi at over two hundred miles.  I know the distance now from San Antonio to Austin is but little over eighty miles, so that our computation was probably too high.  There was not at the time an individual living between Corpus Christi and San Antonio until within about thirty miles of the latter point, where there were a few scattering Mexican settlements along the San Antonio River.  The people in at least one of these hamlets lived underground for protection against the Indians.  The country abounded in game, such as deer and antelope, with abundance of wild turkeys along the streams and where there were nut-bearing woods.  On the Nueces, about twenty-five miles up from Corpus Christi, were a few log cabins, the remains of a town called San Patricio, but the inhabitants had all been massacred by the Indians, or driven away.  San Antonio was about equally divided in population between Americans and Mexicans.  From there to Austin there was not a single residence except at New Braunfels, on the Guadalupe River.  At that point was a settlement of Germans who had only that year come into the State.  At all events they were living in small huts, about such as soldiers would hastily construct for temporary occupation.  From Austin to Corpus Christi there was only a small settlement at Bastrop, with a few farms along the Colorado River; but after leaving that, there were no settlements except the home of one man, with one female slave, at the old town of Goliad.  Some of the houses were still standing.  Goliad had been quite a village for the period and region, but some years before there had been a Mexican massacre, in which every inhabitant had been killed or driven away.  This, with the massacre of the prisoners in the Alamo, San Antonio, about the same time, more than three hundred men in all, furnished the strongest justification the Texans had for carrying on the war with so much cruelty.  In fact, from that time until the Mexican war, the hostilities between Texans and Mexicans was so great that neither was safe in the neighborhood of the other who might be in superior numbers or possessed of superior arms.  The man we found living there seemed like an old friend; he had come from near Fort Jessup, Louisiana, where the officers of the 3d and 4th infantry and the 2d dragoons had known him and his family.  He had emigrated in advance of his family to build up a home for them.    CHAPTER V.  TRIP TO AUSTIN--PROMOTION TO FULL SECOND LIEUTENANT--ARMY OF OCCUPATION.  When our party left Corpus Christi it was quite large, including the cavalry escort, Paymaster, Major Dix, his clerk and the officers who, like myself, were simply on leave; but all the officers on leave, except Lieutenant Benjamin--afterwards killed in the valley of Mexico --Lieutenant, now General, Augur, and myself, concluded to spend their allotted time at San Antonio and return from there.  We were all to be back at Corpus Christi by the end of the month.  The paymaster was detained in Austin so long that, if we had waited for him, we would have exceeded our leave.  We concluded, therefore, to start back at once with the animals we had, and having to rely principally on grass for their food, it was a good six days' journey.  We had to sleep on the prairie every night, except at Goliad, and possibly one night on the Colorado, without shelter and with only such food as we carried with us, and prepared ourselves.  The journey was hazardous on account of Indians, and there were white men in Texas whom I would not have cared to meet in a secluded place. Lieutenant Augur was taken seriously sick before we reached Goliad and at a distance from any habitation.  To add to the complication, his horse--a mustang that had probably been captured from the band of wild horses before alluded to, and of undoubted longevity at his capture--gave out. It was absolutely necessary to get for ward to Goliad to find a shelter for our sick companion.  By dint of patience and exceedingly slow movements, Goliad was at last reached, and a shelter and bed secured for our patient.  We remained over a day, hoping that Augur might recover sufficiently to resume his travels.  He did not, however, and knowing that Major Dix would be along in a few days, with his wagon-train, now empty, and escort, we arranged with our Louisiana friend to take the best of care of the sick lieutenant until thus relieved, and went on.  I had never been a sportsman in my life; had scarcely ever gone in search of game, and rarely seen any when looking for it.  On this trip there was no minute of time while travelling between San Patricio and the settlements on the San Antonio River, from San Antonio to Austin, and again from the Colorado River back to San Patricio, when deer or antelope could not be seen in great numbers. Each officer carried a shot-gun, and every evening, after going into camp, some would go out and soon return with venison and wild turkeys enough for the entire camp.  I, however, never went out, and had no occasion to fire my gun; except, being detained over a day at Goliad, Benjamin and I concluded to go down to the creek--which was fringed with timber, much of it the pecan--and bring back a few turkeys.  We had scarcely reached the edge of the timber when I heard the flutter of wings overhead, and in an instant I saw two or three turkeys flying away.  These were soon followed by more, then more, and more, until a flock of twenty or thirty had left from just over my head.  All this time I stood watching the turkeys to see where they flew--with my gun on my shoulder, and never once thought of levelling it at the birds.  When I had time to reflect upon the matter, I came to the conclusion that as a sportsman I was a failure, and went back to the house.  Benjamin remained out, and got as many turkeys as he wanted to carry back.  After the second night at Goliad, Benjamin and I started to make the remainder of the journey alone.  We reached Corpus Christi just in time to avoid \"absence without leave.\"  We met no one not even an Indian --during the remainder of our journey, except at San Patricio.  A new settlement had been started there in our absence of three weeks, induced possibly by the fact that there were houses already built, while the proximity of troops gave protection against the Indians.  On the evening of the first day out from Goliad we heard the most unearthly howling of wolves, directly in our front.  The prairie grass was tall and we could not see the beasts, but the sound indicated that they were near.  To my ear it appeared that there must have been enough of them to devour our party, horses and all, at a single meal.  The part of Ohio that I hailed from was not thickly settled, but wolves had been driven out long before I left.  Benjamin was from Indiana, still less populated, where the wolf yet roamed over the prairies.  He understood the nature of the animal and the capacity of a few to make believe there was an unlimited number of them.  He kept on towards the noise, unmoved.  I followed in his trail, lacking moral courage to turn back and join our sick companion. I have no doubt that if Benjamin had proposed returning to Goliad, I would not only have \"seconded the motion\" but have suggested that it was very hard-hearted in us to leave Augur sick there in the first place; but Benjamin did not propose turning back.  When he did speak it was to ask: \"Grant, how many wolves do you think there are in that pack?\" Knowing where he was from, and suspecting that he thought I would over-estimate the number, I determined to show my acquaintance with the animal by putting the estimate below what possibly could be correct, and answered:  \"Oh, about twenty,\" very indifferently.  He smiled and rode on.  In a minute we were close upon them, and before they saw us.  There were just TWO of them.  Seated upon their haunches, with their mouths close together, they had made all the noise we had been hearing for the past ten minutes.  I have often thought of this incident since when I have heard the noise of a few disappointed politicians who had deserted their associates.  There are always more of them before they are counted.  A week or two before leaving Corpus Christi on this trip, I had been promoted from brevet second-lieutenant, 4th infantry, to full second-lieutenant, 7th infantry.  Frank Gardner,(*1) of the 7th, was promoted to the 4th in the same orders.  We immediately made application to be transferred, so as to get back to our old regiments.  On my return, I found that our application had been approved at Washington. While in the 7th infantry I was in the company of Captain Holmes, afterwards a Lieutenant-general in the Confederate army. I never came in contact with him in the war of the Rebellion, nor did he render any very conspicuous"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],["title","Sowing Seeds in Danny (#0)"],["body","of Women Writers\" and by Gardner Buchanan.

Burton Francis sat, at peace with herself and all mankind. The glory of the short winter afternoon streamed into the room and touched with new warmth and tenderness the face of a Madonna on the wall.  The whole room suggested peace. The quiet elegance of its furnishings, the soft leather-bound books on the table, the dreamy face of the occupant, who sat with folded hands looking out of the window, were all in strange contrast to the dreariness of the scene below, where the one long street of the little Manitoba town, piled high with snow, stretched away into the level, white, never-ending prairie. A farmer tried to force his tired horses through the drifts; a little boy with a milk-pail plodded bravely from door to door, sometimes laying down his burden to blow his breath on his stinging fingers.  The only sound that disturbed the quiet of the afternoon in Mrs. Francis's sitting room was the regular rub-rub of the wash-board in the kitchen below.  \"Mrs. Watson is slow with the washing to-day,\" Mrs. Francis murmured with a look of concern on her usually placid face. \"Possibly she is not well. I will call her and see.\"  \"Mrs. Watson, will you come upstairs, please?\" she called from the stairway.  Mrs. Watson, slow and shambling, came up the stairs, and stood in the doorway wiping her face on her apron.  \"Is it me ye want ma'am?\" she asked when she had recovered her breath.  \"Yes, Mrs. Watson,\" Mrs. Francis said sweetly. \"I thought perhaps you were not feeling well to-day. I have not heard you singing at your work, and the washing seems to have gone slowly. You must be very careful of your health, and not overdo your strength.\"  While she was speaking, Mrs. Watson's eyes were busy with the room, the pictures on the wall, the cosey window-seat with its numerous cushions; the warmth and brightness of it all brought a glow to her tired face.  \"Yes, ma'am,\" she said, \"thank ye kindly, ma'am. It is very kind of ye to be thinkin' o' the likes of me.\"  \"Oh, we should always think of others, you know,\" Mrs. Francis replied quickly with her most winning smile, as she seated herself in a rocking-chair. \"Are the children all well? Dear little Danny, how is he?\"  \"Indade, ma'am, that same Danny is the upsettinest one of the nine, and him only four come March. It was only this morn's mornin' that he sez to me, sez he, as I was comin' away, 'Ma, d'ye think she'll give ye pie for your dinner? Thry and remimber the taste of it, won't ye ma, and tell us when ye come home,' sez he.\"  \"Oh, the sweet prattle of childhood,\" said Mrs. Francis, clasping her shapely white hands. \"How very interesting it must be to watch their young minds unfolding as the flower! Is it nine little ones you have, Mrs. Watson?\"  \"Yes, nine it is, ma'am. God save us. Teddy will be fourteen on St. Patrick's Day, and all the rest are younger.\"  \"It is a great responsibility to be a mother, and yet how few there be that think of it,\" added Mrs. Francis, dreamily.  \"Thrue for ye ma'am,\" Mrs. Watson broke in. \"There's my own man, John Watson. That man knows no more of what it manes than you do yerself that hasn't one at all at all, the Lord be praised; and him the father of nine.\"  \"I have just been reading a great book by Dr. Ernestus Parker, on 'Motherhood.' It would be a great benefit to both you and your husband.\"  \"Och, ma'am,\" Mrs. Watson broke in, hastily, \"John is no hand for books and has always had his suspicions o' them since his own mother's great-uncle William Mulcahey got himself transported durin' life or good behaviour for havin' one found on him no bigger'n an almanac, at the time of the riots in Ireland. No, ma'am, John wouldn't rade it at all at all, and he don't know one letther from another, what's more.\"  \"Then if you would read it and explain it to him, it would be so helpful to you both, and so inspiring. It deals so ably with the problems of child-training. You must be puzzled many times in the training of so many little minds, and Dr. Parker really does throw wonderful light on all the problems that confront mothers. And I am sure the mother of nine must have a great many perplexities.\"  Yes, Mrs. Watson had a great many perplexities--how to make trousers for four boys out of the one old pair the minister's wife had given her; how to make the memory of the rice-pudding they had on Sunday last all the week; how to work all day and sew at night, and still be brave and patient; how to make little Danny and Bugsey forget they were cold and hungry. Yes, Mrs. Watson had her problems; but they were not the kind that Dr. Ernestus Parker had dealt with in his book on \"Motherhood.\"  \"But I must not keep you, Mrs. Watson,\" Mrs. Francis said, as she remembered the washing. \"When you go downstairs will you kindly bring me up a small red notebook that you will find on the desk in the library?\"  \"Yes ma'am,\" said Mrs. Watson, and went heavily down the stairs. She found the book and brought it up.  While she was making the second laborious journey down the softly padded stairs, Mrs. Francis was making an entry in the little red book.     Dec. 7, 1903. Talked with one woman to-day RE Beauty    of Motherhood. Recommended Dr. Parker's book. Believe    good done.  Then she closed the book with a satisfied feeling. She was going to have a very full report for her department at the next Annual Convention of the Society for Propagation of Lofty Ideals.  In another part of the same Manitoba town lived John Watson, unregenerate hater of books, his wife and their family of nine. Their first dwelling when they had come to Manitoba from the Ottawa Valley, thirteen years ago, had been C. P. R. box-car No. 722, but this had soon to be enlarged, which was done by adding to it other car-roofed shanties. One of these was painted a bright yellow and was a little larger than the others. It had been the caboose of a threshing outfit that John had worked for in '96. John was the fireman and when the boiler blew up and John was carried home insensible the \"boys\" felt that they should do something for the widow and orphans. They raised one hundred and sixty dollars forthwith, every man contributing his wages for the last four days. The owner of the outfit, Sam Motherwell, in a strange fit of generosity, donated the caboose.  The next fall Sam found that he needed the caboose himself, and came with his trucks to take it back. He claimed that he had given it with the understanding that John was going to die. John had not fulfilled his share of the contract, and Sam felt that his generosity had been misplaced.  John was cutting wood beside his dwelling when Sam arrived with his trucks, and accused him of obtaining goods under false pretences. John was a man of few words and listened attentively to Sam's reasoning. From the little window of the caboose came the discordant wail of a very young infant, and old Sam felt his claims growing more and more shadowy.  John took the pipe from his mouth and spat once at the woodpile. Then, jerking his thumb toward the little window, he said briefly:  \"Twins. Last night.\"  Sam Motherwell mounted his trucks and drove away. He knew when he was beaten.  The house had received additions on every side, until it seemed to threaten to run over the edge of the lot, and looked like a section of a"]]]
