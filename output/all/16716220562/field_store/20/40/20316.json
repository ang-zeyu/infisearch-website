Volunteers who helped with this book: Eric Heaps, Meridith Crowder, Byron Clark, Jean-Michel Carter, Tod Robbins, Ben Crowder, Stephen Bruington, Benjamin Bytheway.  Version 1.0    Preface  The need of a history of the Church in one volume that can be used for general reading, and at the same time meet the requirements of a text-book in the priesthood quorums, Church schools and auxiliary organizations, for a long time has been recognized. In the preparation of this volume, all these requirements have been given thoughtful consideration. As the title of the book, _Essentials in Church History_, implies, the vital and essential points of history and doctrine have been selected, and as far as possible, arranged in chronological order. The doctrines and revelations given to the Prophet Joseph Smith have been interwoven with the main story of the history in a manner, it is hoped, that will prove to be both interesting and instructive to the casual reader, as well as to the careful student. Moreover, the work has been prepared with the desire that the arrangement of the material will stimulate in the reader a zeal for further research and study of other and more extensive histories, particularly the _Documentary History of the Church_, in six volumes, which covers the period of the life of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  It is impossible to give, in one volume, in detail all the important incidents in the history of the Church. However, this volume is sent forth on its mission with the hope that it will answer fully the purpose for which it was written.  Grateful appreciation is hereby acknowledged for invaluable assistance given by Dr. John A. Widtsoe, of the council of the twelve, in the preparation of the manuscript. I also desire to express sincere thanks to Elders Edward H. Anderson, J. M. Sjodahl, Andrew Jenson, August William Lund and others, who have so willingly and cheerfully assisted in the preparation of the work.

The belief is held by many that when the Savior supplanted these laws with the Gospel it was the first appearance among men of that great plan of salvation. The Gospel is much older than the law of Moses; it existed before the foundation of the world. Its principles are eternal, and were made known to the spirits of men in that antemortal day when Jesus Christ was chosen to be the \"Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.\" All necessary preparations were made in the spirit life for the peopling of this earth in a mortal existence. It was there decided that Adam should come to this earth and stand as the progenitor of the race.  The Fall of Man and His Redemption  That Adam and his posterity might gain the experience that can only be obtained in mortality, it was necessary that he should break the law by which he was governed in the Garden of Eden, and thereby subject himself and his posterity to death. To gain an exaltation man must have experience and must exercise his free will. Then, knowing both good and evil, by obeying the will of the Father he will receive a reward for the good deeds done while in the flesh. The fall of man brought temptation, sin and death. It was therefore essential that a Redeemer be provided through whose atonement for the fall, all men, without regard to their belief, race, or color, are entitled to come forth in the resurrection of the dead, to be judged according to their works. \"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive\" (1 Cor. 15:21-22).  Individual Salvation Taught to Adam  Individual salvation requires that a man must repent and accept the fulness of the Gospel if he would be exalted in the kingdom of God. This plan of salvation was taught to Adam after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. He was baptized in water for the remission of his sins, in the name of the only Begotten of the Father, and received the Holy Ghost. He and his wife, Eve, were commanded to teach their children the Gospel, that they also \"might be sanctified from all sin, and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even immortal glory\" (Moses ch. 6).  In obedience to this commandment Adam and Eve made all these things known to their sons and daughters. Thus the Gospel was taught in the beginning and was declared from generation to generation. Adam received the Holy Priesthood, which was also conferred upon the patriarchs who followed after him. They were \"preachers of righteousness, and spake and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent, and faith was taught unto the children of men\" (Moses 6:22).  The Gospel Rejected in Days of Noah  In the days of Noah the Gospel was universally rejected, save by Noah and his immediate family--in all eight souls. Noah had labored diligently and long to bring mankind to repentance, but without avail, \"for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth\" (Moses 8:29). After the destruction of the wicked in the flood, the Gospel continued to be taught by Noah and the later patriarchs, but quite generally it was not received. Melchizedek, king of Salem, through his faithfulness, became a great high priest, and the people of the Church in his day honored him by calling the \"Holy Priesthood after the order of the Son of God,\" by his name, \"out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being\" (D. & C. 107:4). From Melchizedek, Abraham received the Priesthood, and to Melchizedek, as the properly authorized servant of the Lord, Abraham paid tithes of all he possessed (Gen. 14:20).  The Covenant with Abraham  Unto Abraham also was the Gospel preached and the Lord made covenant with him that through him and his posterity should all nations of the earth be blessed (Gen. 22:18). This same Gospel was also declared to the children of Israel in its simple truth; but they proved"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45054"],["title","Essentials in Church History (#1)"],["body","to receive it in its fulness, due to their long sojourn in Egypt, where they had partaken of the customs, traditions and theology of the Egyptians, and therefore \"the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it\" (Heb. 4:2). The Lord endeavored to establish the fulness of his Gospel and authority among them, which Moses plainly taught, and he sought to sanctify the people, \"that they might behold the face of God; but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence, therefore the Lord in his wrath (for his anger was kindled against them) swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory\" (D. & C. 84:23-24).  The Higher Priesthood and the Carnal Law  It became necessary, therefore, for the Lord to take Moses and the Higher Priesthood out of their midst, but the Lesser Priesthood, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels and the preparatory Gospel--faith, repentance and baptism for the remission of sins--he permitted to remain. To this he added the carnal law, known as the law of Moses, which was added, so Paul informs us, as a schoolmaster to prepare them to receive the fulness of the Gospel when restored by Jesus Christ.  The Israelites, from the time they entered the promised land to the coming of the Son of God, were living under the law of Moses, which laid upon them severe and exacting restrictions because of their refusal to receive the fulness of the Gospel when it was offered in the wilderness. When the Savior came, it was to complete and fulfil the ends of this law, of which he said not one jot or title should pass until all was fulfilled.  Dispensation of the Meridian of Time  In the Dispensation of the Meridian of Time, when the Savior ministered among the Jews, he restored the Gospel with the Higher Priesthood. He called and ordained Twelve Apostles and gave them power, before his ascension into heaven, to complete the church organization, and commissioned them to carry the message of divine salvation into all the world. In restoring that which had been taken away, he annulled the carnal law, which had been added in the place of the higher law, for it had filled the measure of its creation.  Commission of the Apostles  Under the commission Jesus gave the apostles to carry the Gospel message into all the world and preach it to every creature, they commenced their active ministry on the day of Pentecost, preaching in power to the convincing of many souls. As the work of the ministry grew, and the assistance of other laborers was required to carry on the work, men were divinely called and ordained to specific offices in the Church. The Lord, himself, had called and ordained, besides the twelve, seventies, and sent them forth throughout Judea bearing the message of truth. When they returned from that missionary journey it was with much rejoicing because even the devils were subject unto them. What other officers the Lord ordained and set apart, the scriptures do not reveal. That the Twelve Apostles were empowered to set in order all things pertaining to the Church, is, nevertheless, beyond dispute. We learn that under their direction and ministry, as branches were formed and the work of the ministry required it, high priests, evangelists, patriarchs, elders, bishops, deacons, priests, pastors and teachers were called into the service of the Church. The organization was in this manner effected during the days of the apostles. The Church was also blessed with the divine gifts and blessings of the Spirit of the Lord in those early days, just as it was during the Savior's ministry. There were in the Church many prophets who uttered, by the gift of the Holy Ghost, many remarkable predictions.  Essential Offices in the Church  All of these offices in the Church, are essential to the advancement of the members and cannot be discarded with impunity. Paul said, the Lord \"gave some apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists; and some pastors and teachers; for the perfection of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.\" These were not merely to remain in the Church during the formative period, or for a brief season in order to start the work, and then to be replaced by other officers of another kind. Men were ordained to these callings \"for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ\" (Eph. 4:12-13). Evidently, then, as long as there is imperfection in the Church among the members, in doctrine, knowledge, or love, they fall short of \"the stature of the fulness of Christ.\"  These officers are all needed and cannot justly be removed, for the Lord never so intended. The writer of the epistle to the Ephesians also further compares all these officers to the various parts of the human body and says: \"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.\" This same apostle also likens the spiritual gifts to the physical body, declaring each to be essential in the Church, just as the parts of the body are each necessary and one part cannot say to another, \"I have no need of you,\" for all are necessary that all men may \"profit withal.\"    Chapter 2  The Falling Away  The Body of the Church Destroyed  Notwithstanding that the early officers of the Church were endowed with the Holy Priesthood and exercised the spiritual gifts, which were to remain until all came \"unto a perfect man unto the stature of the fulness of Christ,\" there came a great and terrible change, absolutely destroying the perfect body of the Church. In its place arose a strange organization which eventually gained dominion over the earth and ruled the destinies of men, not in love unfeigned, but in blood and carnage most appalling, and with an iron hand.  The Falling Away Predicted  The rise of this power had been predicted by many of the prophets of old and by the apostles of our Lord. Even the Savior, when instructing his disciples regarding the signs of the times, intimated that this would occur. Isaiah, seven centuries before the birth of Christ, predicted that the time would come when the earth would be defiled under its inhabitants because of the transgression of the law, the changing of ordinances and the breaking of the new and everlasting covenant. It is evident that this was to occur in the latter days, and not in the days of Israel's subjection to the law, for the law of Moses was not an everlasting covenant. This prophecy was to receive its consummation in the day when the earth, defiled by the wickedness and corruption of its inhabitants, should be cleansed by fire and few men left (Isaiah 24:1-6).  The Prophecies of Isaiah and Amos  Speaking of this event Isaiah says: \"For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.\" Shortly before this time, Amos also predicted that the time would come when the Lord would send a famine in the land, \"not a famine of bread,\" said he, \"nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\"  The Vision of Daniel  Daniel saw in vision the overthrow of the Church established by the Savior in the meridian of time. In his vision of the four beasts, representing the kingdoms seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream, he saw one horn, or power, come up among the ten that succeeded the Roman Empire, \"more stout than his fellows.\" This horn had eyes and a mouth that spake very great words against the Most High, and three other kingdoms were subdued by this great horn. The same power \"made war with the saints and prevailed against them,\" and through continued conflict and exercise of might was able to \"wear out the saints of the Most High\" and thought to \"change times and laws.\" This blasphemous power was to rule until the coming of the Ancient of Days, when the kingdom and dominion was to be \"given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.\"  Apostasy Commenced in Days of Apostles  The falling away from the faith commenced before the close of the ministry of the apostles. Paul, when at Miletus taking his final departure from the elders of Ephesus who had come to meet him, earnestly entreated them to take heed to feed the Church of God, for, said he, \"I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock, and of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them.\" He also took occasion to warn the Saints at Thessalonica not to be deceived regarding the ushering in of the second advent of the Son of God, \"for that day,\" he wrote to them, \"shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.\"  The Predictions of Paul  The Saints at Galatia commenced very early to depart from the faith. Timothy was warned by Paul, and instructed that in the last days perilous times would come and men would be \"lovers of their ownselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more that lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.\" Moreover, he said the time would come, \"when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, "]]]
