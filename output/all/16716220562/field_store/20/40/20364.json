To what heights of power and glory may they not ascend?  It is idle today to ask men to be satisfied with the old sectarian notions of man's future life, where at best he is to be but one of a minstrelsy twanging harps and singing to the glory of an incorporeal, bodiless, passionless, immaterial incomprehensible God. Such conceptions of existence no longer satisfy the longings of the intelligent or spiritual-minded man.[A]  [Footnote A: On this subject Sir Robert Ball, the great English astronomer and man of science, and who is feelingly spoken of as \"a man with singular capacity for popularizing science without debasing it\"--has the following passage:       \"The popular notion that man, once escaped from the confinement of     the body, does nothing except sit on a cloud and sing psalms to the     glory of a God, whose glory is so perfect without him that he was     content when man was not in being, rests upon no evidence, whether     of reason or revelation, and seems to us derived either from     man's long experience of overtoil and misery and his enjoyment,     therefore, of their absence, or from the inherent Asiatic dislike     of exertion. Why should we not work forever as well as now? If man     can live again, and grow in that new life, and exert himself to     carry out the always hidden, but necessarily magnificent purpose of     the Creator, then indeed, his existence may have some importance,     and the insignificance of his place of origin be forgotten. For he     has an inherent quality which does not belong, so far as the mind     can see what must always remain partially dark, even the Divine;     he is capable of effort, and in the effort and through the effort,     not only of growing greater than before, but of adding force to an     inanimate thing like his own body. What if that power of effort     should be slowly aggrandized until man, now a little higher than     the monkey, became a really great being?\" (\"Self Culture\" for     March, 1899.)]  Growth, enlargement, expansion for his whole nature, as he recognizes that nature in its intellectual, moral, spiritual and social demands, are what his soul calls for; and the systems of theology that rise not to the level of these hopes are unworthy man's attention.  Keep these thoughts in mind for a moment, I pray you. That is, remember the powers in man, what he has attained to in this life, and what it is conceivable for him to attain unto after the resurrection of the dead, when death shall have been removed from his pathway. Keep this in mind, while I bring to bear on the theme under consideration another line of facts.  Let us consider, just for a moment, and in a very simple manner, the universe in which man lives. And let us start with what we know, and keep well within those lines. First of all, then, as to the earth itself: Thanks to the knowledge man now has respecting the earth it is no longer regarded as the center of the universe, around which revolve sun and moon and stars, that in the ages of darkness were thought to have been created for the sole purpose of giving light by day and by night to the earth. No; man has learned the true relation of the earth to these other objects in the universe. He knows that the earth is but one of a number of planets--one of a group of eight major planets, and a larger number of minor ones, that revolve regularly around the sun--and one of the smallest of the group of major planets at that. Outside of this group of planets, with whose motions and laws man has become familiar, is a vast host of what are called \"fixed stars;\" that is, stars that apparently have no motion, but which really do move, only their orbits are so immense that man with the unaided eye can not discern their movements--hence we call them \"fixed stars.\"[A] Our astronomers have learned that these \"fixed stars\" are not like the planets which move in their orbits about our sun, but, on the contrary, are like the sun itself, self-luminous bodies, and doubtless like the sun the center of opaque planetary groups; or at least we may say that reasoning from analogy, that is regarded as a very probable fact.  [Footnote A: \"To the unassisted eye, the stars seem to preserve the same relative positions in the celestial sphere generation after generation. If Job, Hipparchus, or Ptolemy should again look upon the heavens, he would, to all appearance see Aldebaran, Orion, and the Pleiades exactly as he saw them thousands of years ago, without a single star being moved from its place. But the refined methods of modern astronomy, in which the telescope is brought in to measure spaces absolutely invisible to the eye, have shown that this seeming unchangeability is not real, but that the stars are actually in motion, only the rate of change is so slow that the eye would not, in most cases, notice it for thousands of years. In ten thousand years, quite a number of stars, especially the brighter ones, would be seen to have moved, while it would take a hundred thousand years to introduce a very noticeable change in the aspect of the constellations.\" (Newcomb's Astronomy, pp. 464-5.)]  Sir Robert Ball in speaking of these worlds and the probability of their being inhabited says:       We know of the existence of thirty millions of stars or suns, many     of them much more magnificent than the one which gives light to     our system. The majority of them are not visible to the eye, or     even recognizable by the telescope, but sensitized photographic     plates--which are for this purpose eyes that can stare unwinking     for hours at a time--have revealed their existence beyond all     doubt or question, though most of them are almost inconceivably     distant, thousands or tens of thousands of times as far off as our     sun. A telegraphic message, for example, which would reach the sun     in eight minutes, would not reach some of these stars in eighteen     hundred years. The human mind, of course, does not really conceive     such distances, though they can be expressed in formula which the     human mind has devised, and the bewildering statement is from one     point of view singularly depressing. It reduces so greatly the     probable importance of man in the universe. It is most improbable,     almost impossible, that these great centers of light should have     been created to light up nothing, and as they are far too distant     to be of use to us, we may fairly accept the hypothesis that     each one has a system of planets around it like our own. Taking     an average of only ten planets to to each sun, that hypothesis     indicates the existence, within the narrow range to which human     observation is still confined, of at least three hundred millions     of separate worlds, many of them doubtless of gigantic size, and it     is nearly inconceivable that those worlds can be wholly devoid of     living and sentient beings upon them. Granting the to us impossible     hypothesis that the final cause of the universe is accident, a     fortuitous concourse of self-existent atoms, still the accident     which produced thinking beings upon this little and inferior     world must have frequently repeated itself: while if, as we hold,     there is a sentient Creator, it is difficult to believe, without     a revelation to that effect, that he has wasted such glorious     creative power upon mere masses of insensible matter. God cannot     love gases. The high probability, at least, is that there are     millions of worlds--for, after all, what the sensitized paper sees     must be but an infinitesimal fraction of the whole--occupied by     sentient beings.[A]  [Footnote A: Self Culture for March, 1899.]  On this subject Richard A. Proctor, in his \"Other Worlds Than Ours,\" also remarks:       To sum up what we have learned so far from the study of the starry     heavens--we see that, besides our sun there are myriads of other     suns in the immensity of space; that these suns are large and     massive bodies capable of swaying by their attraction systems of     worlds as important as those which circle around our own sun; that     these suns are formed of elements similar to those which constitute     our own sun, so that the worlds which circle round them may be     regarded as in all probability similar in constitution to this     earth; and that from these suns all forms of force which we know     to be necessary to the existence of organized beings on our earth     are abundantly emitted. It seems reasonable to conclude that these     suns are girt round by dependent systems of worlds. Though we     cannot, as in the case of the solar system, actual see such worlds,     yet the mind presents them before us, various in size, various     in structure, infinitely various in their physical condition and     habitudes.[A]  [Footnote A: \"Other Worlds Than Ours,\" p. 240.]  With the unaided eye there is ordinarily within the range of our vision some five or six thousand of these \"fixed stars.\" With the aid of the telescope, however, there is brought within the range of man's vision between forty and fifty millions of fixed stars; with the probability existing that all these, as well as those fixed stars of sufficient magnitude to be within the range of our unaided vision, are, like our own sun, the centers of groups of opaque planets, which, because they are opaque, cannot be seen by us. But this is but the beginning of the story of the universe. Immense as are the numbers of \"fixed stars\" to which I have called attention, and their distances so great that in some cases it would take a ray of light a million years to reach us from them, though light moves through space at such speed that it will travel some eight times around the earth in a single second--immense, I say, as are these numbers of \"fixed stars\" revealed to man by the telescope, they are after all but as the first \"street lamps\" of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],["title","The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#7)"],["body","d's great universe--but a few of the motes in God's sunbeam. Let me explain. You have seen a ray of sunlight dart into a room through the half drawn curtains, and have observed that it reveals the existence of innumerable motes floating about in the sunbeam. You know that if the sunbeam should shift into another part of the room it will reveal the existence of motes in that part of the room also--millions of them. So you know that the atmosphere in the whole room is filled with such motes; that the atmosphere in every room in your house is in the same condition--that is, filled with motes; so all the rooms in all the houses of your friends, or in the city; so also the whole circumambient air of the whole earth. Well, what man has discovered in space pertaining to the existence of \"fixed stars\"--great, selfluminous bodies, unquestionably the centers of planetary systems the same as our sun is--all this, I say, is but as the sunbeam revealing the existence of a few of the motes that exist in some little corner of a room: for out on the farthest edge of space explored by man's vision aided by the most powerful helps he can devise, man in contemplation can stand and conceive of still greater stretches of space filled by still more numerous suns, the centers of planetary systems, than has yet come within the range of his vision. And standing thus in the midst of the universe, he begins to comprehend that great truth uttered by Joseph Smith when he contemplated the creations of the Gods: \"There is no space where there is no kingdom [created world], and there is no kingdom where there is no space, either a greater or a lesser space.\"[A] But this is beside the subject.  [Footnote A: Doc. & Cov. sec. 88:36,37.]  What I want you to do is to think how small and insignificant this earth of ours is, even in comparison with some of the planets of our own system, some of which are hundreds of times larger than our earth.[A] And then the sun, the center of the system, itself--what a speck it is in the universe! Though outweighing the combined mass of all the planets of which he is the center seven hundred and thirty times over, still he is but a point in the universe! To quote the words of an eminent author:  [Footnote A: The planet Jupiter, for example, has a diameter of about 85,000 miles, while the earth's diameter is but about 8,000 miles. In volume Jupiter exceeds our earth about 1,300 times, while in mass it exceeds it 213 times. (See \"Newcomb's Astronomy,\" p. 339.)]       As there are other globes like our earth, so, too, there are     other worlds like our solar system. There are self-luminous suns     exceeding in number all computation. The dimensions of this earth     pass into nothingness in comparison with the dimensions of the     solar system, and that system, in its turn, is only an invisible     point if placed in relation with the countless hosts of other     systems which form, with it, clusters of stars. Our solar system,     far from being alone in the universe, is only one of an extensive     brotherhood, bound by common laws and subject to like influences.     Even on the very verge of creation, where imagination might lay the     beginning of the realms of chaos, we see unbounded proofs of order,     a regularity in the arrangement of inanimate things, suggesting     to us that there are other intellectual creatures like us, the     tenants of those islands in the abysses of space. Though it may     take a beam of light a million of years to bring to our view those     distant worlds, the end is not yet. Far away in the depths of space     we catch the faint gleams of other groups of stars like our own.     The finger of a man can hide them in their remoteness. Their vast     distances from one another have dwindled into nothing. They and     their movements have lost all individuality; the innumerable suns     of which they are composed blend all their collected lights into     one pale milky glow.      Thus extending our view from the earth to the solar system, from     the solar system to the expanse of the group of stars to which we     belong, we behold a series of gigantic nebular creations rising     up one above another, and forming greater and greater colonies of     worlds. No numbers can express them, for they make the firmament     a haze of stars. Uniformity, even though it be the uniformity of     magnificence, tires at last, and we abandon the survey, for our     eyes can only behold a boundless prospect and conscience tells us     our own unspeakable insignificance.[A]  [Footnote A: Draper's \"Intellectual Development of Europe,\" vol. 2, p. 292.]  And the earth itself, then, what of that? What an insignificant thing it is in the creations of God! With all its islands and continents, its rivers, lakes and mighty oceans; its mountains and its valleys; its towns, cities and all the tribes of men, together with all their hopes and fears and petty ambitions--all is but a mote in God's sunbeam--less than a single grain of sand on the sea shore!  What I want to ask in the light of these reflections is this: Is it such a wonderful thing to believe that at the last, one of God's sons shall preside over this little earth as the God-president or God of it? That our Father Adam, the \"Grand Patriarch\" of our race--the \"Ancient of Days\"--\"Michael, the Archangel\"--give him what title you will out of the many which are his--is it so hard to believe that he will eventually attain to the dignity of the governorship of this earth, when it is redeemed and sanctified and becomes one of the glorified spheres of God?  Some of the sectarian ministers are saying that we \"Mormons\" are ashamed of the doctrine announced by President Brigham Young to the effect that Adam will thus be the God of this world. No, friends, it is not that we are ashamed of that doctrine. If you see any change come over our countenances when this doctrine is named, it is surprise, astonishment, that any one at all capable of grasping the largeness and extent of the universe--the grandeur of existence and the possibilities in man for growth, for progress, should be so lean of intellect, should have such a paucity of understanding, as to call it in question at all. That is what our change of countenance means--not shame for the doctrine Brigham Young taught.  I feel that I must have wearied you with so long a discourse; I know very well I have wearied myself; and yet I am loth to quit this splendid field for thought. The subject, and our conception of it, must ever be grander than it is within our ability to express. It is beyond our power to grasp it and make it plain in words, I can see in this \"Mormon\" doctrine of God the highest spirituality that the mind of man is capable of grasping. If our sectarian friends think, that in us there is any drifting away from the teachings of our prophets upon this subject, any shadow of turning, and that we of modern days are growing more spiritual than were they, it is not that we are changing, or leaving the old moorings of our faith; but it is because they themselves are giving a little more careful attention to our doctrines, and begin to catch their first sight of the grand spirituality which all the while has pervaded our belief in the Gods and their government, and the heights of glory to which men--the offspring of the Gods--may finally attain.    CHAPTER II.  REPLY TO ELDER ROBERTS' MORMON VIEWS OF DEITY,[A] BY REV. C. VAN DER DONCKT, OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, POCATELLO, IDAHO.  [Footnote A: The following note preceded Rev. Van Der Donckt's reply, when published in the _Improvement Era_: \"In the first two numbers of the present volume of the _Era_, an article on the Characteristics of the Deity from a 'Mormon' View Point, appeared from the pen of Elder B. H. Roberts. It was natural that ministers of the Christian denominations should differ from the views there expressed. Shortly after its appearance, a communication was received from Reverend Van Der Donckt, of the Catholic church, of Pocatello, Idaho, asking that a reply which he had written might be printed in the _Era_. His article is a splendid exposition of the generally accepted Christian views of God, well written and to the point, and which we think will be read with pleasure by all who are interested in the subject. We must, of course, dissent from many of the deductions with which we cannot at all agree, but we think the presentation of the argument from the other side will be of value to the Elders who go forth to preach the Gospel, as showing them what they must meet on this subject. It is therefore presented in full; the _Era_, of course, reserving the right to print any reply that may be deemed necessary.--Editors.\"]  I.  I am very grateful for the privilege of being allowed space in your magazine to reply to Mr. B. H. Roberts' defense of the \"Mormon Views of the Deity.\"  1. First, Mr. Roberts asserts: \"Jesus came with no abstract definition of God.\" He certainly gave a partial definition of God when declaring: \"God is a spirit\" (John 4:24). Now, although we must believe whatever God reveals to us upon one single word of his, just as firmly as upon a thousand, nevertheless, I will add that St. Paul, who solemnly testifies that he _received of the Lord that which he delivered unto the Christians,_ (I Cor. 11:23) also states: \"The Lord is a spirit\" (II Cor. 3:17).  I am well aware that the Latter-day Saints interpret those texts as meaning a spirit clothed with a body, but what nearly the whole of mankind, Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans, have believed for ages cannot be upset by gratuitous assertions of a religious innovator of this last century. Again, the context of the Bible admits of no such interpretation. And if anyone should still hesitate to accept the universally received meaning of the word _spirit_, our risen Savior settles the matter.
