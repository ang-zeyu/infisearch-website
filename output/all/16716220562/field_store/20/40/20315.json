I stopped to rest at a post put up by Stewart where the Raccoon fork led off. While there Josiah Arnold passed on his way to Miller's. From him I learned that there was a camp ground about a half a mile farther. I went on and waited. Before any of the wagons arrived James came up. Soon after news arrived that Swap had broke his wagon tongue. I sent James to help bring on the loads. We only started with three wagons and left three back with Corbitt and Martin. The teams worked hard all day and at half past nine the last team arrived having taken all day to travel about five miles.  Monday, May 25  This morning I sent James and Corbitt to go and trade three horses and some harness for cows. About noon I started out with two wagons and left one and about three loads of stuff in care of two of the guard. After we had traveled about three miles I met a messenger from the camp who handed me two letters, one was from Diantha and one from Brother Whitaker concerning a piece of land. We went on about a mile and crossed a creek where we waited to rest our teams. When I read Diantha's letter it gave me painful feelings to hear of her situation. After resting about an hour we went on about four miles farther and camped near Father Baker's camp on a creek. It was night before we got supper over. I found several men going back to Nauvoo for their families.  Tuesday, May 26  Wrote an answer to Whitaker's letter and also one to Diantha. We started on about eight o'clock and found the road bad and many bad creeks where the bridges had been washed away. After traveling two miles one of my wagons loaded with corn meal was upset in a hole. But after about an hour's labor we got the loading in. The wagon was not much damaged. We proceeded about three miles farther and met two men with six yoke of oxen which President Young had sent to meet us. This was a great relief to us for we saw that we could not get to camp today because of our teams being so worn down. We rested our teams about an hour and then started on at a good pace. We found several more very bad creeks to pass but we did not have much difficulty. Duzett and myself drove the cows. Edward Martin drove his horses. About sundown we arrived in camp, having traveled about thirteen miles. This place is called Mt. Pisgah and is a very beautiful situation, the prairie rolling and rich, skirted with beautiful groves of timber on the main fork of the Grand river. Soon after we arrived Elder Kimball came to welcome us to camp and then came Elder Richards and family and President Young who all seemed glad to see us in camp.  Wednesday, May 27  This morning my horses and one cow and several of the oxen are missing. I went to see Bishop Whitney about getting teams to send back for the loads remaining but could get no satisfaction from him. I went back and unloaded two wagons on the ground and about the same time saw the President who said he would send for them. Elder Kimball sent one wagon and the President sent two. President Young said they intended to take the church property in their wagons and take it on to Council Bluffs but I must go with them and leave James and Corbitt and Egan to bring on the wagons they have, etc. I cannot think they understand my situation in regard to the teams or they would make some definite move about it. They intend to start in a day or two and I tried to fix the wagons in good order but had no chance to get even one fixed. Spent the day fixing up my tent and had to get a new pole. Heber took my other one. Afternoon it commenced gathering for a storm and we had barely time to get the tent up and the things under it before it began to rain and continued till I went to sleep. George Herring and Shumway arrived here last night. I spoke with them today.  Thursday, May 28  The morning dull and foggy, ground wet, etc. Went fishing some. Evening played with Hutchinson and Pitt. All my oxen, horses and the cow were found. I went out this morning hunting for them on foot. Evening raining.  Friday, May 29  The weather fine, cool, and windy. Talked with Heber some. He says I shall have teams. One of my wagons came in this morning.  Saturday, May 30  Went and borrowed a robe and ornaments from Aaron Farr then rode with Dr. Richards about three miles on the prairie. There were five others and among them President Young. Two tents were brought and we fixed them up and then met and clothed. There were President Young, P. P. Pratt, J. Taylor, Geo. A. Smith, A. Lyman, John Smith, N. K. Whitney, D. Spencer, O. Spencer, C. C. Rich, E. T. Benson, Wm. Huntington and myself. Clothed and having offered up the signs, offered up prayer, Heber C. Kimball being mouth. We then conversed awhile and appeared again, Geo. A. Smith being mouth--A. P. Rockwood and Wm. Kimball were guarding the tent. Prayers were offered that we might be delivered from our enemies and have teams to go on our journey, etc. About two o'clock we returned to camp. Many of the teams were coming in and among the rest, the teams sent back for my loading which all arrived tonight.  Sunday, May 31  Having heard that Egan was near I started out to meet him. The morning was fine but about eleven o'clock it began to thunder. I went about two miles and before I got back without seeing Egan it rained heavily. I was wet through. I called at the meeting while President Young was speaking. It rained nearly all the afternoon. Noal Richards died.    June 1846  Monday, June 1  Was wet in the morning and windy all day. The council got me four wagons and seven yoke of oxen to take church property.  Tuesday, June 2  Still windy but fair. President Young has again stated I lack some cattle yet. Fixing my wagon, etc. Have about teams enough but lack teamsters.  Wednesday, June 3  Fixing my wagons. Concluded to start on. My teams were scattered but we started with what we had. We got over the river at three o'clock, one yoke of cattle still missing. I sent the men hunting for them but they were not found.  Thursday, June 4  Again sent the men hunting cattle. The day was very cold and windy, almost as cold as winter. I spent the day fixing a wagon for Diantha expecting her on in about two weeks. Lucy Walker called in this afternoon and expressed sorrow on account of the treatment of Heber's family toward her. Amos Fielding called on his way to the President's camp. Towards evening it rained and there was one of the most beautiful rainbows I ever saw in my life. We could see its brilliant reflection within a few rods of us. In the evening Douzett came for his cow which had tarried with ours. He concluded to stay over night. My teamsters returned without finding the cattle.  Friday, June 5  Sent all the men except James Douglas to hunt the cattle. About nine o'clock my adopted son Thomas Corbich returned with them. I then waited till two o'clock for the men to return, three of them being still absent. I have now eleven wagons, sixteen yoke of oxen, six cows, five horses, and six teamsters, besides my brother James, whose names are Conrad Neil, Levi N. Kendall, James Douglas, Milton F. Bartlett, Willard Smith, and A. E. Hinkel, four of the latter are new to me and do not seem to know much about teaming. At two o'clock I concluded to start on and after about an hour's preparation we started. The men took two teams each. I drove the cows on foot. The roads are a great deal better. We traveled about six miles and camped on a hill beyond nice timber. Pitt is here and Brother Taylor's camp. Amos called on his way back to England. He stayed and conversed a while. I will here say that the oxen put in by Brothers Olive and Rich to take church property are very poor and some of them scarcely of any use. We arrived here about half past six o'clock. The day has been cold, fine and fair.  Saturday, June 6  The morning very fine. We started out at eight o'clock; Pitt joined with us. I went on foot to drive the cows. About ten o'clock we had a little rain. After traveling about seven miles we arrived at a piece of timber where the patriarch John Smith was resting. We concluded to rest our teams here and stopped at half past eleven. At one o'clock we started again and soon after had a heavy thunder shower. I was about a mile ahead of the wagons and having no shelter was soon completely drenched with rain. It got very cold while raining. As soon as the wagons came up we stopped till the shower was over which did not last long. We then pursued our journey and at six o'clock camped on the open prairie a long way from timber, having traveled about sixteen miles. After the shower the day was fine. I was very tired and wet and after eating a little went to bed. Vilate Ruth is weaning from the breast today which makes her cry.  Sunday, June 7  Inasmuch as we were not near timber we concluded to travel on till we found some. We started at eight o'clock and traveled till two, being about nine miles, when we came to a little grove of timber and just beyond a bad bottom of prairies. I concluded to pass this and camp on the adjoining ridge. I drove the cows all day on foot. My feet were sore and blistered. The day was very fine. Sometime after we arrived Father John Smith came and camped just below us.  Monday, June 8  The weather fine. Traveled about ten miles, the roads being very hilly and uneven. We camped on a bottom near timber. I went fishing and had good success. I drove the cows till noon then rode with family.  Tuesday, June 9  Weather fine and hot. Went fishing at daybreak with James and had good luck. At nine we went on. I rode again. Afternoon three Indians overtook us and begged some bread. We camped on a bottom beside Coleman and others, having traveled about twelve miles. Two Indians are here and we have learned their camp is only three miles from us. President Young left word to go in companies from here to avoid being plundered by the Indians. We"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45051"],["title","William Clayton's Journal (#8)"],["body"," our cattle tied up and a guard over them through the night.  Wednesday, June 10  Went fishing at daybreak and caught thirty-six. Weather hot. We started about nine o'clock and found the roads good but over hills and ravines all the day. At six o'clock we camped in sight of the Pottawattamie Indian village. When about two miles from it they discovered us coming and we soon saw a number of them riding towards us. Some had bells on their horses which frightened our horses and cattle. James and I took the horses and let the others take the oxen the best way they could. Some of the Indians followed our wagons and inquired often for whiskey. We had to pass some timber and a river before we arrived at their village which is situated on a very beautiful ridge skirted by timber and beautiful rolling prairie. Before we arrived at the timber it seemed that the whole village had turned out, men, women, and children, some on horses and many on foot. Their musicians came and played while we passed them. They seemed to escort our wagons and asked if we were Mormons. When we told them we were they seemed highly pleased. It took us some time to cross the bridge over the river and then we were perfectly surrounded by Indians apparently from curiosity and friendship. They watched us cross the bridge and others followed on with us. The boys seemed to learn the words our teamsters used to drive the cattle and would run and in their way help to drive. They manifested every feeling of friendship and nothing unkind or unfriendly transpired. Soon after we passed the bridge we were met by Jas. W. Cummings and the brethren from Shariton Ford with John L. Butler to bring Emmet's company to meet us. The cattle have been with Emmet's company from the time they left Nauvoo. The road leads within about two hundred yards of the Indians and I wanted to go about two miles farther to save the necessity of having a guard but soon after we left the village we had to ford a stream which was deep and bad to cross. I then concluded to camp on the ridge above the ford and in sight of the village, being about a half or three quarters of a mile from them. Many of them followed us, men, women and children and watched all our movements but about dark all departed in peace. They seemed well pleased with their visit. They certainly showed every mark of friendship and kindness imaginable and treated us as brothers. We learned that the chief's daughter was buried today. We have traveled about fifteen miles. From Cummings we learned that Emmet had left his things belonging to the company with him. Part of the company has crossed at St. Louis and are now on the line here. The agent of the U. S. refuses to let them pass. The other part of the company are thirty miles below the bluffs expecting us to cross there.  Thursday, June 11  Many of the Indians again came to the camp with the same friendly feeling. Some squaws came to trade. We started soon after nine, the weather being very hot. We traveled over about five miles of very uneven road. The rest was good. We had to travel till late before we came to water. We camped on a small creek where Coleman and Tanner were camped, having traveled about fourteen miles.  Friday, June 12  Traveled about three miles, the weather being very hot. We camped on a beautiful ridge where the main body had evidently left but little before, beside a large rapid stream. I concluded to stay here until Monday to rest our teams and give their shoulders a chance to heal, several of which were very sore.  Saturday, June 13  Fixing a wagon, etc. The weather very hot. Evening killed one of our cows. The mosquitoes here began to be very troublesome, there being so many of them and so bloodthirsty.  Sunday, June 14  The weather very hot and the mosquitoes tremendously bad. This morning I weighed bread for each man at the rate of a half a pound a day. They seem very much dissatisfied and growl to each other very much. I weighed for my family of ten as much as I weighed for six teamsters. They were dissatisfied but we had some left. They have hitherto had all they wanted three times a day and above this have eaten up a bag of crackers unknown to me which I had reserved for the mountains. The mosquitoes being so bad, I concluded to go on a little piece. We started at 1:00 p.m. and traveled until four when we arrived at a small clear stream having traveled about six miles. I camped here and in the evening told the men a part of what I thought of their conduct.  Monday, June 15  The morning cooler but mosquitoes bad. Our horses were missing and we were detained till ten o'clock before we could start. The horses had gone back to where we left yesterday. We traveled till sundown before we came to water, being about twelve miles. We camped near to C. L. Whitney.  Tuesday, June 16  Started at 7:30 and traveled about twelve miles when we came in sight of the Missouri river and the main camp about five miles farther. We soon learned that some of the camp were coming back to find water. There being no water where we were, we moved back about two miles to a spring and there camped expecting to stay until we should learn what to do.  Wednesday, June 17  This morning Kay and Duzett rode up and said they were anxiously expecting us at the camp and wanted us to go immediately. I went to the camp with them to look out a place while my men yoked up and brought the wagons. When I arrived I saw Heber. He seemed pleased to see me and went with me to look out a place to camp. I fixed a spot between President Young's camp and Bishop Miller's. Heber said the twelve had an invitation to go to the village to the agent's to dinner and they wanted the band to go with them. I went back to meet the wagons which had been detained on account of some of the cattle being missing. As soon as my wagons arrived I got ready and started in Heber s carriage with Heber, Bishop Whitney, and Smithies. Edward Martin, Pitt, Hutchinsoo, Kay and Duzett rode in the other carriage. When we arrived at Mr. Mitchell's, the agent's place, we were introduced to him one by one. We then played and Kay sang until about five o'clock when we returned. This village is situated but a little distance from the river, probably fifty rods. It is composed of twelve or fifteen blocks, houses without glass in the windows, and is the noted place where the Lamanites for years held their council. The inhabitants are composed of Lamanites, half breeds and a few white folks. I had an introduction to Sarrapee an Indian trader. We arrived home just at dusk.  Thursday, June 18  Fixing a wagon all day. Evening went fishing. Spoke to Bishop Whitney about some more teams.  Friday, June 19  Fixing wagons and preparing to send off some things to trade. Evening went fishing. Went with the band to hold a concert at the village. Many went from the camp. The Indians and half breeds collected $10.10 and gave it to us and the agent Mr. Mitchel gave a dinner to all that came.  Sunday, June 21  At home until evening. At 5:00 met with the brethren of the camp and acted as clerk while they selected men to build the boat.  Monday, June 22  Fixing my wagons. The day was windy and cold. I was informed yesterday that Diantha is twenty miles back from Mt. Pisgah with her father still farther back. They have sent her chest on to Pisgah and she is with Loren. I partly made up my mind to start in the morning and bring her.  Tuesday, June 23  This morning I got my food ready to start after Diantha but Vilate Ruth seemed quite sick and I concluded not to start. We took the teams and went to the village to pick gooseberries but it rained nearly all the time we were gone. I bought a scythe and some other things and tried to trade a watch for a yoke of cattle. Major Mitchel offered me three yoke for the gold watch. We got home about 3:00. I then went and told the President about Mitchel's offer and he told me to sell it. It was so cold and wet and windy we went to bed early and soon after we got to bed, Heber and Dr. Richards came to my wagon with two letters from Diantha, one dated Nauvoo, May 17, 1846, the other Big Prairie, June 18th. She tells that she is sent on by her father and is with Loren and is very anxious that I should bring her or send for her. I made up my mind to start tomorrow. The night was very stormy with strong winds and heavy rains.  Wednesday, June 24  The morning wet and cold. I went over to President Young and told him where I was going and what for. He said he would get the cattle for me. I also spoke to Heber and he said: \"Go and prosper.\" At 11:00 I went to council and President Young, Kimball and Taylor concluded also to go to Pisgah after the cannon. I started at two o'clock it then being fair. At five o'clock I passed Father Knowlton's company thirteen miles from camp and at seven passed Laharpe's company and inquired of Brother Burgham and Freeman about Diantha but could not learn much from them. Brother Ezra Bickford was here on his way back to Nauvoo. He said he was tired from riding on horseback and asked if I would let him go with me to Pisgah and use his horse in the wagon. I told him to come on. I soon found it made a difference in the load. We went on about two miles and stopped at dark on the middle of the prairie near no water. After feeding we lay down to rest. We had several heavy showers through the night.  Thursday, June 25  This morning arose at four o'clock and moved our wagon a little to fresh grass to let the horses feed, they being tied to it. It is fair, but cloudy. We started again at 5:30 a.m., traveled till 10:00 then rested till 2:00 and then traveled until dark, making thirty-one miles. We camped just beyond the Indian village in the midst of a severe thunder storm. It rained most of the day and the roads were bad.  Friday, June 26  Did not start until after seven. Morning fair, roads bad. After traveling about six miles we found Horace Clark and others camped on one side of a small"]]]
