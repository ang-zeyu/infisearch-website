As I said before, I belonged to the grenadiers, and there were twenty of us in a small bell tent; and you may easier conceive than I can describe how such a number could take repose during the night on so small a space, with nothing but straw on the ground, and our camp blankets. We were so jammed together that it was impossible for any one to change his posture, at least without disturbing the whole tent. Our field-days also were very frequent and severe, the men being out from five or six o'clock in the morning until four or five in the afternoon, without tasting a morsel of victuals, so that many of the men fainted daily in the ranks from want and fatigue.  After remaining on the Curragh for six weeks, the country became quiet, and we were ordered back to our old stations; and heartily glad we were again to see the barracks of Athlone. After doing the duty here a few months longer, we received a route to Dublin, at which news I was very greatly delighted, for there I expected to get my musical mind much better entertained than at Athlone. On my arrival at Dublin I went to a music teacher, to whom I paid half-a-guinea a month for getting instructions on the violin and clarionet; but having already acquired considerable execution on the German flute, I was encouraged myself to give instructions on that instrument; and the money I received in this way enabled me to defray the expense of my own teacher, and of buying instruments, music, &c. Here I breathed my native air, I may say; for what with regimental practice, teaching my pupils, attending my own instructions, writing my own music, &c. I certainly had enough of it, yet hardly could I ever say I was satiated. Even in the night the music was passing before me in review; and when I did not perfectly comprehend my master's lessons during the day, they were sure to be cleared up to me when I awoke during the night. There was no time here allowed for the service of God; no--something of more importance, as I thought, engrossed my mind, but I little thought that this course was preparing me apace for falling a victim before a temptation which was not far distant. It may seem strange to my readers, that I who seemed to show so much piety, during my apprenticeship, and for some time afterwards, should now live so careless a life; but I had my lashes of conscience sometimes, I assure you, and endeavoured to hush its clamours by saying, I had no opportunity in a barrack-room for prayer, reading my Bible, or serious reflection, and I tried to believe that God would take this for an excuse, particularly as I promised to become a good Christian, when the Lord should deliver me from this confusion. Truly, the heart is deceitful and desperately wicked. The truth is, my mind was constantly going after its vanities; I found pleasure in nothing but music and musicians.  Windham's plan, as it was called, now came into action. This was for Militia and Army of Reserve men, to volunteer into the line for seven years, and great numbers in our regiment were taking the bounty every day. There was nothing but drumming and fifeing to be heard in the very passages of the barracks, and our commanding officer gave five pounds to drink, night after night, at the mess-house, in order to encourage our men to extend[1] their service, and enter into the first battalion of the regiment, which consisted of what are called regulars; and to add to the intoxicating effect of the liquor, the whole corps of fifes and drums were ordered to attend, and continued there nightly, till we were all worn out with fatigue. In spite of these temptations, I never once thought of volunteering, though the commanding officer laboured hard to induce me to go with him into the first battalion. I told him freely that my mind did not lead me to the army; and when he saw he could not prevail, he said, \"Very well, my man, if your heart does not lie in the right bit, never volunteer.\" But, alas! the value of the Apostle's admonition, \"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall,\" was soon after exemplified in my experience. Shortly after this, upwards of one hundred of our men volunteered into the 2d battalion of the Scots Royals, which was also a marching regiment. Some of them were asked by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart if there was any young man of the 26th corps of fifes, that was qualified for fife-major. They all answered, there was one B----. The Colonel hearing so much of me, sent a Serjeant to request me to call upon him. This I promised to do next day, but I had truly a miserable conflict in my mind that night, considering whether I ought to accept or refuse this offer. Sleep I could get none, but walked about the passages of the barracks all night, looking anxiously at both sides of the question. My principal objection was the wickedness of the army, for I easily got over that of the hardships to which I would be exposed in a marching regiment, either in the field or in a foreign country. On the other hand, if I could obtain the situation of serjeant and fife-major, the pay would be very comfortable, and I would have an opportunity of seeing the world, which would gratify an inclination I had long entertained. I therefore came to the resolution of going, if I received the above situation. To be short, I went to Colonel Stewart, and after a few words passing on both sides, he asked me if I would take the ten guineas of bounty, and fife-major, with the _rank_ of serjeant, and go with him into the 2d Battalion of the Royals. I told him, if I received the _pay_, with the rank of serjeant and fife-major, I would, but not otherwise, for that I did not care for the rank without the pay.--So he was honest enough to tell me, that he did not know if the Duke of Kent would allow a fife-major the pay of serjeant, besides his perquisites as fife-major, but if I would take his offer, he would give me five guineas over and above my bounty, as he had received a good character of me, and liked my appearance, and, moreover, that I would find a friend in him, and that he would write the Duke of Kent, who was our Colonel, for authority to give me the serjeant's pay; but as he could not assure me of its being done, he would promise nothing but what he could perform. This was very honest plain dealing, and was truly attractive in my eyes, but it would not do: so I thanked him for his friendly offers, and so bade him farewell, and walked away; but he followed me to the foot of the stair, where the major of the regiment meeting us, said, \"Well Stewart, have you agreed with this young man?\" He answered in the negative, and stated to him the reason as above mentioned; but the major soon removed that obstacle, by saying, \"we can easily give him the difference of pay out of the fund of the regiment, if the duke will not allow it; and to give me all satisfaction that the serjeant's pay would be sure to me from that date, he offered me his letter to that effect.\" To this proposal I could no longer object, and in short I received the letter, passed the Doctor, got my bounty, and a furlough of two months to see my friends in Scotland, before I returned to my barracks. A few days after, along with other volunteers, who had also obtained furloughs, we sailed in a vessel for Saltcoats, and, after a very pleasant passage of two days, were safely landed there, and my comrades each took his own road. One young lad only went with me to Edinburgh; and we were on the top of the coach on the 7th day of August, 1806; that dreadful day of thunder, lightning, and rain, by which so much mischief was done to men, beasts, and the fruits of the earth. We were the only outside passengers, and the company inside were willing to incommode themselves considerably, to give us shelter, which was kind on their part, and tempting upon ours; and my comrade gave me the motion to that effect; but I refused, saying, that as we had joined a marching regiment of the line, we must lay our account with being exposed frequently to such weather and worse, and that I could not brook this sort of effeminateness, but no doubt we got a very complete ducking.            [1] The Reserve were enlisted for five years, or during the           war, and were not obliged to go out of the three kingdoms.  I arrived safe at Peebles amongst my old friends, where I was warmly received after an absence of three years; but I did not long remain there till I formed an intimacy with a young woman; and our courtship, like that of many soldiers, was not long; but I would not marry till I returned to the regiment and obtained my Colonel's liberty, that so I might have a better chance of getting her abroad with me, should the regiment, as we expected, be ordered on foreign service. My attachment to this young woman was very sincere; and I gave instructions to the person with whom I had left my bounty money, as formerly mentioned, to give her ten pounds to bear her expenses to the regiment, then in England, when, after obtaining the Colonel's leave to marry her, I should send him a letter to that effect. All being thus settled between us, the time drew nigh when I was to leave my native spot, which was now doubly dear to me. I left Peebles about two o'clock in the morning, in fine moonlight, in the month of September; but it is easier for you, my dear reader, to conceive than for me to describe my situation. I cast many a longing lingering look behind me, and dragged myself by main force out of the view. I was little short of being angry at my preciseness, that I did not marry off hand, and bring the girl with me, whose situation was still more pitiable than my own. We were only two days in Edinburgh, then sailed from Leith Roads for the regiment, which was lying at Horsham, and I was not long there when I had all settled in our favour, and immediately wrote for the young woman; but, as I afterwards discovered, or at least had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45531"],["title","Narrative of the Life and Travels of Serjeant B—— (#4)"],["body","reason to suspect, a certain evil-designing person kept up the letters. I waited in anxious suspense for \"the girl I left behind me,\" but I waited in vain. Days were as months, and brought me no relief. At last, to crown my misery, I received a letter from a friend in Peebles, who knew of our agreement, stating, that Jean had almost gone out of her mind about me, and thinking, like too many of my coat, that I was going to prove unfaithful, she went to Edinburgh to inquire about me. There she got no relief to her distracted mind, but only the satisfaction that I had sailed for the regiment at such and such a time. She was now put to her wits end, and in a kind of derangement she wandered to Dumfries, where she had a brother residing, and remained with him for some time. She saw herself like a castaway, for she was ashamed to go back to her place at Peebles, and it being between terms, she could not get into service in a country where she was a stranger: so, in a word, the serjeant of a Highland regiment, an acquaintance of her brother's, paid his addresses to her, and she married him; but scarcely was the festival over when the contents of my letter, through the same channel probably by which it was intercepted originally, reached her ears; and if she was to be pitied before that time, she was not less so then. This was, I may say, my first courtship, (and I then thought it would be my last,) for, during the three years I was in Ireland, I never spent an hour in a woman's company, good or bad, although some of my companions often tried to lead me astray. But I was always so much taken up with my music, that I had no time to spend in such courses: Providence by this means preserving me from at least a worse evil; for these strange women (as Solomon calls them) were the occasion of hundreds of the regiment getting themselves confined and flogged, besides the other dreadful effects produced by their company.  Nothing extraordinary happened till we came to Hastings, which we left on the 15th March, 1807, (on our route to Portsmouth to be embarked for India,) and reached Lewes on that day, where I, and thirty others of our regiment, were billeted at the White Hart. Shoreham is the next stage for soldiers, and here, intending to write my friends in Scotland, I felt for my watch, (which cast up the day of the month,) that I might put the right date to my letter, but, to my great mortification, my watch was gone. After a little reflection, I remembered that I had, very stupidly indeed, left it in my quarters at Lewes: so I immediately went to Colonel Stewart to ask his permission to return there, which he readily granted. I left Shoreham about four o'clock at night, and reached the inn at Lewes about eleven. Happy was I to find my watch safe in the possession of Boots, and I immediately took the road again, and was in Shoreham in good time to march with the regiment in the morning. When Colonel Stewart saw me, he inquired why I had not gone for my watch; and when I told him I had already been at Lewes, he would scarcely believe me, until I showed her to him. He then desired me to get on one of the baggage waggons; but I said I was able enough for the march; but you may believe I was terribly tired before we reached the next stage.  When we arrived at Portsmouth, the Duke of Kent came in person to make arrangements for the embarkation of the regiment; but now came the tug of war for the married people. There were between two and three hundred women in the 2d Battalion of the Royals, and there were only six women for every hundred men permitted to go; so that sixty women (our battalion being 1000 strong) were the whole number who could embark with their husbands. The selection of these was made by casting lots. Amongst the married people, all was suspense and anxiety to know their destiny; and you may conceive what barrack-rooms we had after it was over. I went into one of them, as I was passing to the Colonel's quarters, to see one of my musical friends, who had a worthy woman to his wife, and to inquire if she had got a prize, but all was _dool_ and sorrow. I thought with myself that I would try what my interest with the Colonel could do for this sorrowful couple, but durst not speak my mind lest I should raise hopes that would never be realized, and thus make things worse; for \"hope deferred maketh the heart sick.\" So I opened my mind freely to the Colonel, and spoke much in favour of Mrs. Allan, (for that was her name,) but nothing more than she justly deserved. His answer to me was, \"Indeed B---- I wish the Duke of Kent had stopped where he was. We would have managed matters better without him; but I will try what I can do for her on your account. Tell Mrs. Allan to come to me.\" So I left him quite overjoyed that I should have it in my power to bring comfort to the disconsolate mourners. I returned to his quarters immediately along with Mrs. Allan. The Colonel said, smiling, \"Well, Mrs. Allan, are you not afraid of your husband being jealous of you and the Fife Major?\" She answered in the negative. \"He speaks in very high terms of your character.\" \"I am very much obliged to him, Sir, for his good opinion.\" \"Is he any relation to you?\" \"No, Sir, but he has always been a very good friend.\" \"That is right; give my compliments to Captain Glover, and desire him from me to put down your name to go with his company.\"--Take notice of this circumstance, for I will have occasion to mention it again.     CHAPTER III.   We were embarked on board of our respective ships on the 13th April, 1807, and weighed anchor on the 18th. There seems much to make one unhappy and melancholy, when taking probably the last view of the land which gave him birth; but, notwithstanding, all seemed now festivity and joy. Some of those who seemed so full of joy, I have good reason to believe, might, with justice, be called Solomon's merry men--in their laughter their hearts were sad. Still more, perhaps, have their relations who loved them cause of sorrow. To them may the prophet's language be truly directed, \"Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him, but weep sore for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see his native country; but he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.\"  _At sea, Ship Coutts, May 1st._ William Troop departed this life. He was one of those unhappy creatures who left his wife behind, and died of a broken heart. They had been lately married, and were like the \"loving hind and the pleasant roe,\" and his feelings being unable to stand the separating stroke, he sunk under this insurmountable load of sorrow.  _May 6_, Twelve o'clock noon. We had a tremendous storm of wind, accompanied with incessant falls of rain and vivid flashes of lightning. All hands during night were piped by the boatswain upon deck, to reef, or rather to clue the sails, when a fine looking young man, who had shipped himself at Portsmouth for ship's painter, being ordered aloft by the boatswain, to bear a hand in reefing the mizzen topsail, fell from the yard into the sea and was drowned. He pled hard with the boatswain to allow him to remain and assist upon deck, saying, that he never was aloft in his life, and that in such a dreadful night he was sure he would not be able to keep his feet; but all his entreaties were in vain.  _June 12._ This day we crossed the equinoctial line. The foolish but amusing ceremony (to bystanders) of shaving took place on all those who had not before crossed it; but, lest it might lead to any disturbance, the soldiers were exempted. The form is as follows: A person goes to the head of the ship, in the garb of Neptune, the god of the sea, according to the heathens, and another person, generally the most dexterous at the harpoon, kills a fish previously to this, and gives it to the Captain to be in readiness. Neptune, from the bow of the vessel, hails it in these words, \"_What ship, a hoy?_\" The officer whose turn it is to be on watch, answers \"Coutts,\" or whatever is the name. \"Where bound?\" _Officer on watch._--\"India.\" Neptune then comes on board and enters his triumphal car, which stands in waiting. He is drawn aft by the sailors, and the fish is presented to him by the captain. Then commences the shaving operation. All the sailors who have not formerly crossed the equinoctial are kept below blindfolded until the large tub is ready. Each of them is in this state led upon deck, and placed on a plank laid across the tub, filled with salt water. The mock barber daubs his face all over with tar and feathers.  For a razor he takes a piece of iron hoop and commences his shaving. It requires no common degree of patience to endure this horrid operation; but if the person gets refractory, he is instantly plunged over head and ears in the watery element, by one of the sailors pulling the plank from under him; and after he has scrambled out of the tub, should he stand to expostulate with his comrades on this treatment, two or three of the sailors, each provided with a bucket of salt water, standing on the hammock railings, discharge the contents upon him with such an overwhelming dash as makes him glad to choose another time and place to avenge his wrongs.  _June 20._ I lost my watch overboard, which cost me upwards of four pounds, and so much uneasiness and travel in England; but I would not have mentioned the circumstance but for the loss of a seal attached to it, which I had received from my affectionate comrade the drum-major of the 2d battalion, who was sent to another battalion, and we got in his place an old wicked creature, whom I may have occasion to bring on the carpet again. We were much attached to each other, and he offered to his Royal Highness to go with me to India in the capacity of a private drummer, if he would not continue him in his present situation; but his petition was not granted, so he gave me this seal as a token of his remembrance.  _June 22."]]]
