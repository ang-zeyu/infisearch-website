I hope they won't turn the guns of the fort upon us.\"  \"No fear. They'll have been warned of our coming by now.\"  A minute later, they opened out the sea, the forts, and Shakespeare's Cliff, and within another three minutes they had crossed the boundary of sea and land, and at a tremendous altitude were gliding over the Channel.  \"Nine thousand!\" yelled Dastral, turning his head towards Jock, after casting a brief glance at his indicator.  \"Now let her rip,\" cried the other, for in climbing to get the required height to rush the Channel, the machine had lost speed.  \"Right-o!\" came the answer.  So, in order to get speed quickly, Dastral did a little nose dive of about three hundred feet, then flattened out again, intending to rush the Channel at one hundred and twenty miles an hour, lest they should slip unconsciously into an air-pocket.  As he did so, he noticed a flash of fire followed by a puff of white smoke down at the Castle.  \"A signal!\" shouted Jock, who had noticed the occurrence at the same instant.  \"Yes, they want to speak to us,\" and with a circling sweep the machine came round as Dastral pulled the joy-stick hard over, and swept back again until he hung right over Dover Castle.  \"Can you make it out, old man?\" asked the pilot.  \"Yes, I have it,\" cried Fisker, whose eyes had been glued to a spot on the Castle grounds just at the top of the hill overlooking the naval harbour.  \"What is it? Do they want us to go down?\"  \"No. The Commander of the fort says there are several enemy submarines in the Channel, and requests us to keep a sharp look-out for them as we cross over.\"  \"Cheery-o, Jock! That's good news. I'm going to drop down a bit, then. There's a D.S.O. for you if you spot one. Here goes!\" And with that, Dastral jammed over the controls again, and did a neat nose dive of two thousand feet, looping the loop once or twice just to express his joy, and give vent to his feelings.  Jock had picked up this information from a few white strips of calico, which had been stretched out in a curious fashion within the Castle grounds. To a trained observer like Fisker, it was mere child's play to read a code signal like that.  And now the daring joy-riders, keenly watched by hundreds of eyes far down below, left the shore once again, and the naval harbour with its shipping, and headed for the French coast, watching the surface of the sea as though they would read its secret.  \"East-south-east, Dastral! That's the course till we sight the opposite shore,\" shouted Jock to his comrade, who, he thought, in his excitement and eagerness to spot a submarine lurking in the depths, might miss his way, as many a brave aviator before him had done.  \"Right-o!\" came the answer to this reminder, for the French coast was hid as yet in the morning mist. Then the course was altered slightly once again, in order to make a proper landfall on the other side.  They were flying low now, much lower than the usual regulations permitted, for it is necessary to keep a good altitude in crossing the Channel, not only because of the chance of running into a stray air-pocket, but to enable one to 'plane to safety should anything go wrong with the engines, for only a seaplane can ride the waves like a ship; and this was no seaplane they were riding to-day.  Far down below them they could see the patrol boats hunting for their prey. They could also see the mine-sweepers at work, clearing the fairway from those foul nests of floating mines which the crafty foe had been busy laying with their submarines. Once or twice they thought they could make out some dark-grey object like a mine or sunken vessel beneath the surface of the water.  A string of mine-sweepers were stretched out below them now. They could see them distinctly, could see even the long nets that trailed between them, for the sun was gaining power and the morning mists were rolling away. The grey expanse of water took on another hue, changing from a dull grey to a greenish tint, with patches here and there of deep blue, where the water deepened, or the surface of the mirror reflected a corresponding patch of the azure above.  Keenly now they searched the face of the deep for any dark speck, for, from an aeroplane, it is possible to look far down, often even to the bed of the sea; but as yet they saw nothing, save an occasional piece of wreckage, which had probably detached itself and floated from the treacherous Goodwins, away to the eastward and the northward--those treacherous shoals which hold the remains of so many gallant barques and vessels, from the Roman galley to the modern liner.  They had not long left the mine-sweepers on their port quarter when Jock, through his glasses, noted something like a string of porpoises, which, owing to the motion of the waves, appeared to be travelling along. They seemed so regular and orderly in their movement, however, that he was about to pass them over. Thinking, however, that he would like to call Dastral's attention to them, he shouted:--  \"Starboard bow, Dastral! Look at 'em! What are they? Not mines, surely. Look like porpoises, only they're not dark enough, and they don't tumble about much.\"  Dastral peered over the side of the cockpit and looked down.  \"Can't say,\" he ejaculated.  \"Let's go down a bit lower, old man,\" said Fisker.  \"Aye, aye. Hold tight!\" cried the pilot, for he noticed that Jock was standing up and leaning over, unstrapped.  \"Right away! I'm all right,\" replied the observer, squatting down, and pressing his knees against the knee-board, which is the life-line of the aeroplane.  And down they went in a graceful nose-dive till they were within five hundred feet of the surface of the water, with the engines shut off. Then, as they flattened out, both men peered over the side again, and Dastral was the first to exclaim:--  \"Porpoises be hanged! They're German mines. A whole string of them floating about in the fairway, ready for the first ship that comes along. The dirty Huns!\"  \"Snakes alive! So they are. Now I can make them out quite plainly; I can even see the horns and contacts through my glasses. Phew! There'll be a deuce of a mess shortly unless they're cleared up.\"  \"Look alive, old man, or there'll be trouble!\" shouted the pilot.  \"How so?\"  \"See that ocean tramp coming up Channel. She's a seven thousand tonner, and her cargo's worth a couple of hundred thousand. She'll be right on the string of mines directly, and then--gee whiz!--there'll be fireworks, and another valuable cargo will have gone to Davy Jones' locker.\"  The mine-sweepers were about a couple of miles away by this time, but the Commodore of the little fleet had seen the rapid nose-dive of the hornet, and knew that something unusual was happening.  He had already strung out the signal for a boat to detach its nets and proceed at full steam to the spot, for he thought that the machine was coming down with engine trouble.  It was his duty, therefore, to save the men, and, if possible, salve the aeroplane also. Dastral saw the signal through his glasses, and watched the vessel cast off her nets to come up. His immediate concern, therefore, was for the tramp steamer surging up Channel, and nearing the end of her long voyage from Valparaiso to London. At all costs to the aeroplane, she must be saved from the deadly mines towards which she was now heading directly. The tide was with her, and she was coming up rapidly. In another five minutes she would be in the cunningly laid trap.  For the moment, Dastral continued to circle over the mine bed, hoping thereby to warn off the tramp. Of this she appeared to take no notice, though undoubtedly a score of eyes were watching his gymnastic gyrations from the deck and bridge of the vessel.  \"Try the gun, Jock. Quick!\"  \"Rip-r-r-r-r-r!\" went the Lewis gun, as Jock pressed the button and fired off half a drum of ammunition.  Even yet, the tramp steamer did not seem to understand, for her captain did not charge her course.  \"Is she fitted with wireless?\" yelled Dastral.  \"Yes,\" answered the observer, putting down his glasses into the socket for an instant.  \"Then give her a message on the international code. It's her last chance. She'll be on the infernal things in another two minutes.\"  \"Right-o! Here goes!\" and, uncoiling the long aerial wire, he tapped out just one word on the sending key:--  \"M I N E S!!!\"  \"Good. If that fails, the ship's done for!\" ejaculated Fisker, as he watched eagerly for the ship to change her course.  On came the vessel, quite oblivious of the danger. She was less than a cable's length from the string of mines, and still steaming fast, when Dastral noted some movement about the deck, where a dozen or so of the crew stood just for'ard of the bridge, in the waist, gazing intently at the 'plane.  \"Heavens! It's too late!\" gasped the pilot, as he saw the steamer's bows running dead on towards the very centre of the floating mines.  \"No, she may just do it,\" he ventured to his observer, as he saw the sudden commotion on board.  Suddenly, out of the wireless room, the operator, evidently carrying the message, dashed up the companion way to the bridge, flourishing a piece of paper in his hand, and shouted:--  \"Mines in the vicinity, sir!\"  Then it was that the captain realised the danger he was in, for the mine-sweeper coming up on the starboard bow was also flying the signal for her to heave to.  Dashing to the wheelhouse door, a few paces away from where he had been standing, the captain shouted to the man at the helm,  \"Hard-a-starboard!\"  And though the tide was with her, the good ship swung round smartly, only in the very nick of time, for, as she turned, one of the deadly mines was within two feet of her stern, and the wash from her screw and the rapid movement of her rudder as she came round, caused the nearest mine to come into contact with a piece of wreckage, at which there was a terrific roar,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44348"],["title","Dastral of the Flying Corps (#3)"],["body","a huge column of water was lifted up and hurled some two hundred feet into the air.  Then followed a more terrible spectacle, for one after another the whole string of mines went off, as though they had been countermined. It was just as if there had been a sub-aqueous earthquake, for a prolonged roar of thunder, earsplitting and nerve-racking, immediately followed, while the sea for hundreds of yards around rose up like a huge waterspout, and for some minutes the whole surface of the water, hitherto placid, broke into tumultuous waves.  The tramp steamer received fifty tons of water upon her decks, but save for a slight starting of the plates in her stern, she was untouched. Nevertheless, she had to keep the pumps constantly in use for the remainder of her voyage.  After circling round the spot for another few minutes to speak with the Commodore of the fleet of mine-sweepers, Dastral turned the hornet's head once again towards the enemy's coast, and the captain of the tramp steamer dipped his pennant and gave a long blast on the siren, as a token of gratitude for the service rendered.  The aviators were well pleased with themselves for the part they had taken in the little adventure, which had not been without its thrills, and a spice of danger.  They were now almost in mid-Channel, and could see both shores. There were the white cliffs of Old Albion behind them, while in front, a little on their left, Cape Grisnez rose out of the water. Below them several liners, transports and colliers, could be seen making either up or down Channel, or for one of the ports on the English or French coasts. Turning round to Fisker, the pilot shouted through the speaking tube:--  \"Sorry it wasn't a German submarine, old fellow. There'll be no D.S.O. for us for picking up a string of floating mines.\"  \"Ah, well. Better luck next time,\" called back the observer.  \"The place is too well patrolled now for the Huns' submarines to show themselves about here. Gemini! but I'd give my brevet and six months' pay to spot one this journey. It would be some find.\"  The observer did not reply immediately. He was keenly searching the opposite shore to find the breakwater at the entrance to Boulogne harbour.  \"Can you see it yet?\" called the pilot, noting an anxious look on Jock's face. \"Yes,\" replied the latter. \"Better give her another two points south, and then we shall just about hit the canal below the town. Our instructions were to follow it to the main aerodrome.\"  \"Aye, aye,\" answered the pilot, altering the controls slightly, and bringing her head round upon a more southerly course.  Shortly after this, the town and harbour of Boulogne came into full view to the naked eye. Their intention was to leave it a little on their left, and, then making a landfall of a certain railhead and canal, take a short cross-country flight to the big aerodrome behind the British lines. They now began to regard themselves as nearly at the end of their journey, and had no expectation of a still greater adventure before them--an adventure which would prevent them reaching their destination, at any rate, that day.  Only some five or six miles of sea now lay between them and the land, and they were right over the track of the transports, which made a continuous line of traffic between the two shores, when Fisker, who had taken up his glasses again in order to watch a batch of troopships, escorted by a couple of destroyers, suddenly turned them on to a large four tunnelled hospital ship, which, coming out of the harbour, crowded with wounded and war-worn men, was ploughing its solitary way towards Old Blighty, without any other escort or protector than the Red Cross flag.  Suddenly, as he watched the stately vessel moving along at twenty-five knots, with the huge combers falling away from her bow, and a long milk-white trail from her stern, he started suddenly, and lowered his glasses, almost shrieking at the top of his voice:--  \"See there, Dastral! Quick!\"  \"Where away?\" cried the pilot, turning round sharply, and catching a glimpse of Fisker's horrified face.  \"There!\" exclaimed the observer, laconically, pointing with his hand in the direction of the hospital ship.  Dastral looked in the direction indicated.  \"The brutes!\" he gasped. \"Not if I can prevent it.\"  That which had called forth these horrified expressions was nothing more or less than a lurking German submarine, hidden beneath the water, but with a few inches of periscope above the surface, manoeuvring to bring the huge hospital ship within its range. It had evidently watched the procession of transports pass by, but, fearing that it might be rammed by one of the destroyers if it revealed its presence, it had waited for some other tasty morsel to come along. Unfortunately, there was nothing she could touch but this hospital ship.  With any other nation, a vessel flying the sacred emblem of humanity, which floated from the masthead of the ship, would have been immune from attack. But to the Hun no code of morals seems to hold good. Nor was any crime to be regarded as such if only some damage could be inflicted upon the enemy.  \"Ach, wohl, mein herr!\" the German ober-lieutenant in the submarine was remarking to his superior officer at that moment. \"The verdomt transports are gone, and there's nothing but a big 'hospital ship steaming by. Shall we loose a leetle tin fish at her? You can't trust these English; they're probably transporting materials of war. There are sure to be some staff officers on her decks anyhow. What say you, mein herr?\"  \"Sink the blamed hooker, Fritz! We can say that she tried to ram us, when we make out our report. No one will be any the wiser, for dead men can't tell tales. He, he! Ho, ho!\"  And already the commander's hand was upon the lever in the conning-tower which controlled the torpedo tubes in the bow. Hesitating just for a second, as though battling with the last shreds of a lingering conscience, he pulled the lever.  \"Swiss-s-s-h!\" came the sound as the deadly missile left the tube and entered the water.  \"Good heavens! She's fired!\" exclaimed both the aviators, as, in the very middle of a dangerous nose dive they saw what had transpired, and followed for an instant, even in that downward dive, the wake of the deadly torpedo.  Fortunately, at that very moment the captain of the _Galicia_, the big four-funnelled boat, having had his attention attracted to the spot by the nose-dive of the warplane, saw the periscope of the enemy's submarine, and, starboarding his helm, swung the huge vessel just sufficiently to port for the first torpedo to miss his stern by a few feet.  Then commenced a stern chase, for the _Galicia_, seeing the imminent danger that she was in, sought refuge in flight. Placing her stern towards the oncoming submarine, she fled down Channel, hoping thereby to save her precious cargo of wounded heroes.  \"Donner and blitz!\" exclaimed the commander to his lieutenant. \"We have missed her. That will never do. We must sink her now at any cost, or the American cables will be full of the affair, and the anger of the neutral world will be turned against us once more.\"  \"What shall we do, mein herr?\" asked the lieutenant of the submarine. \"She can do twenty-five knots and we can only do seventeen while we are submerged.\"  \"We must run her awash, and give her three-inch shells with the deck guns. The transports and patrols are some distance off now.\"  \"She will be calling back the destroyers by now with her wireless, mein herr.\"  \"Gott in Himmel! but we must risk it. There may just be time. I wish we had let the blamed hooker go by.\"  Then, with a few round oaths, he switched down the periscope, pulled over the lever that drove the water out of the ballast tanks, and, as the boat came to the surface, he had the hatch unshipped, and ordered his gun crew to stations, calling them dachshunds, and a few more vile names.  As soon as the submarine came to the surface, the electric motors were stopped, and the surface engines started so that every knot could be got out of them.  \"All clear!\" had been reported to him by the lieutenant, and as regards the narrow horizon which can be surveyed from the periscope of a submerged vessel, all was indeed clear, for they had not seen the hornet which was buzzing overhead, silently dipping and nose-diving with her engines shut off, and rapidly manoeuvring like an angry wasp, waiting but an opportunity to get at its victim.  So intent was the submarine commander upon his prey, with one eye on the hospital ship and another on the horizon, watching for the patrol boats, which he knew would be sure to return, that he had even got his deck-gun to work, and was firing rapidly at the _Galicia_, when to his dismay he heard, just over his head, the whir-r-r-r-r of the aeroplane, as Dastral started his engine again.  \"Mein Gott, was ist das?\" he cried.  \"Ach, Himmel, but we are lost!\" came the cry from the gunners and the ober-lieutenant.  \"Dachshunds!--you verdomt fools, turn the gun on the aeroplane!\" yelled the irate commander, but he realised that he had lost the game.  Nearer and nearer came that dreaded enemy, with its angry buzz, till but a hundred feet above the broad, whale-like back of the submarine, for Dastral, having but the two twenty-pound bombs in his carrier, determined not to miss his chance.  \"Be careful, Jock!\" he shouted. \"Drop it right on her conning-tower. Take no risks.\"  \"Right-o, old fellow!\" Jock had replied, his hand on the bomb release. \"She's giving us shrapnel, though. Look out!\"  \"Spit . . . Bang! Spit . . . Bang!\" came the bursting shrapnel from the quick-firing gun on the deck of the submarine, and a shot hitting the left aileron of the warplane, just as the observer was releasing the first bomb, caused her to roll and bank so much that the bomb fell into the sea, just a few inches from the starboard beam of the boat.  \"Great heavens, you've missed him!\" shouted Dastral, as the bomb, which was"]]]
