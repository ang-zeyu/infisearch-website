At first in the form of folk tales in many lands, through ballads and the primitive drama it found its way into literature. It remained for the master-poet, Goethe, to fuse all the elements of the legend into an imaginative drama of unequaled ethical and poetic interest, to give the story the form in which it appeals most strongly to the modern mind.  Innumerable musical works of every form have drawn inspiration from the story of Faust. Wagner's concert-overture, Liszt's symphony, and the beautiful fragments by Schumann are among the noblest of such works. Stage versions of the legend have been numerous, but the first really poetic creation was Spohr's opera of \"Faust,\" composed in 1813. Since its appearance there has been an abundance of Faust operas by English, German, French and Italian composers down to the imaginative but fragmentary \"Mefistofele\" of Boito (1868). But of all the stage versions that have claimed the public attention, that of Barbier and Carré, made after Goethe's drama and set to music by Charles Gounod, is far and away the most popular, and may be regarded, in its lyric dress, as the most successful also. There exists scarcely a single rival to the popularity of Gounod's \"Faust\" among opera-goers.  The love story with which the French librettists concerned themselves exclusively is wholly Goethe's conception, and finds no place in the old legends concerning the magician Faust. With true Gallic instinct they seized this pathetic episode as being best adapted for a lyric setting, and making the most potent appeal to the emotions of the spectators. But to the composer himself is due the credit of suggesting the story of Faust as a suitable subject for musical treatment.     THE STORY OF THE ACTION   ACT I.--Faust, an aged philosopher, who has grown weary of life, and of the vain search for the source of all knowledge, decides, after a nightlong vigil, to end his existence by taking poison. In the act of raising the cup to his lips his hand is arrested by the sound of merry voices of maidens singing in the early morning of the joy of living. Again he essays to drink, but pauses to listen to the song of the reapers on their way to the fields, voicing their gratitude to God. Excited to a frenzy of rage, Faust curses all that is good and calls upon the Evil One to aid him. Mephistopheles appears, and offers gold, glory, boundless power; but the aged doctor craves youth, its passions and delights. The fiend agrees that all shall be his if he but sign a compact, by which the devil serves Faust on earth, but in the hereafter below the relation is to be reversed. Faust wavers at first, but a vision of Marguerite appears, which inflames his ardor and dispels his hesitation; he drinks the potion and is transformed into a young and handsome man.   ACT II.--A Kermesse or town fair. Groups of students, soldiers, old men, maids and matrons fill the scene. Valentine, the brother of Marguerite, about to leave for the wars, commends his sister to the care of Siebel, who timidly adores her. While Wagner, a student, is attempting a song, he is interrupted by Mephistopheles who volunteers to sing him a better one (the mocking \"Calf of Gold\"). Then the fiend causes a fiery liquor to flow miraculously from the tavern sign, and proposes the health of Marguerite. Valentine resents the insult, but his sword is broken in his hand, and Mephistopheles draws a magic circle around himself and bids defiance to the rapiers of the soldiers. These, now suspecting his evil nature, hold their cruciform sword-hilts toward Mephistopheles, who cowers away at the holy symbol. The fête is resumed; in the midst of the revelry Marguerite enters, returning home from church. Faust offers to escort her home, but she timidly declines his assistance, and leaves him enamoured of her beauty. The act closes with a merry dance of the townspeople.   ACT III.--The scene shows the garden of Marguerite's dwelling. Siebel enters to leave a nosegay on the doorstep of his charmer. The flowers he plucks wither at his touch, due to an evil spell cast upon him by the fiend, which he, however, breaks by dipping his hand in holy water. Faust and Mephistopheles conceal themselves in the garden after having left a casket of jewels on the doorstep near Siebel's modest offering. Marguerite returns home and seats herself at the spinning-wheel, singing the while a song of the \"King of Thule.\" But she interrupts the song to dream of the handsome stranger who had spoken to her at the fête. Upon discovering the jewels, she cannot forbear to adorn herself. While thus occupied, Faust and his evil ally appear. The latter engages the girl's flighty neighbor, Martha, in conversation, while Faust pleads his passion's cause successfully with Marguerite.   ACT IV.--Betrayed and deserted by her lover, Marguerite must bear the scorn of her former companions. Siebel alone is faithful, and speaks comforting words. She goes to the church to pray; but her supplications are interrupted by the mocking fiend at her elbow, by the accusing cries of demons, and by the stern chants of the worshipers. Finally Mephistopheles appears to the sight of the wretched girl, who swoons with terror.  The return of the victorious soldiers brings back Valentine, who hears evil stories of his sister's condition. Aroused by an insulting serenade which Mephistopheles, accompanied by Faust, sings beneath Marguerite's window, Valentine engages in a duel with the latter and is wounded to the death. Dying, he curses Marguerite, who comes from the church to his side, and accuses her of bringing him to his end.   ACT V.--Marguerite, her reason shaken by her misfortunes, has killed her child, and for this crime she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45806"],["title","Faust: A Lyric Drama in Five Acts (#1)"],["body","thrown into prison, and condemned to die. Faust, aided by Mephistopheles, obtains access to her cell and urges her to fly with him; but her poor mind cannot grasp the situation, and recurs only to the scenes of their love. When she sees Faust's companion, she turns from him in horror, falls upon her knees, and implores the mercy of heaven. As she sinks in death, Mephistopheles pronounces her damned, but a heavenly voice proclaims her pardoned; and while a celestial choir chants the Easter hymn the soul of Marguerite is seen borne up to heaven by angels. Faust falls to his knees, and the devil crouches beneath the shining sword of an archangel.  First performed at the Théâtre Lyrique, Paris, March 19, 1859, with the following cast:    LE DOCTEUR FAUST                _MM.

He is seated at a table covered with books and parchments; an open book lies before him. His lamp is flickering in the socket.)  _Faust._ No! In vain hath my soul aspired, with ardent longing,          All to know,--all in earth and heaven.          No light illumines the visions, ever thronging          My brain; no peace is given,          And I linger, thus sad and weary,          Without power to sunder the chain          Binding my soul to life always dreary.          Nought do I see! Nought do I know!     (He closes the book and rises. Day begins to dawn.)           Again 'tis light!          On its westward course flying,          The somber night vanishes.                     (Despairingly.)          Again the light of a new day!          O death! when will thy dusky wings          Above me hover and give me--rest?                  (Seizing a flask on the table.)          Well, then! Since death thus evades me,          Why should I not go in search of him?          Hail, my final day, all hail!          No fears my heart assail;          On earth my days I number;          For this draught immortal slumber          Will secure me, and care dispel!      (Pours liquid from the flask into a crystal goblet. Just as he is about to raise it to his lips, the following chorus is heard, without.)  _Cho. of Maidens._ Why thy eyes so lustrous          Hidest thou from sight?          Bright Sol now is scatt'ring          Beams of golden light;          The nightingale is warbling          Its carol of love;          Rosy tints of morning          Now gleam from above;          Flow'rs unfold their beauty          To the scented gale;          Nature all awakens--          Of love tells its tale.  _Faust._ Hence, empty sounds of human joys          Flee far from me.          O goblet, which my ancestors          So many times have filled,          Why tremblest thou in my grasp?               (Again raising the goblet to his lips.) _Cho. of Laborers_                     (without).          The morn into the fields doth summon us,          The swallow hastes away!          Why tarry, then?          To labor let's away! to work let's on,          The sky is bright, the earth is fair,          Our tribute, then, let's pay to heav'n.  _Cho. of Maidens and Laborers._          Praises to God!  _Faust._ God! God!               (He sinks into a chair.)          But this God, what will he do for me?                       (Rising.)          Will he return to me youth, love, and faith?                     (With rage.)          Cursed be all of man's vile race!          Cursed be the chains which bind him in his place!          Cursed be visions false, deceiving!          Cursed the folly of believing!          Cursed be dreams of love or hate!          Cursed be souls with joy elate.          Cursed be science, prayer, and faith!          Cursed my fate in life and death!               Infernal king, arise!              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE II.  FAUST AND MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Mep._                (suddenly appearing).          Here am I! So, I surprise you?          SATAN, Sir, at your service!          A sword at my side; on my hat a gay feather;--          A cloak o'er my shoulder; and altogether,          Why, gotten up quite in the fashion!                      (Briskly.)          But come, Doctor Faust, what is your will?          Behold! Speak! Are you afraid of me?  _Faust._ No.  _Mep._   Do you doubt my power?  _Faust._ Perhaps.  _Mep._   Prove it, then.  _Faust._ Begone!  _Mep._   Fie! Fie! Is this your politeness!          But learn, my friend, that with Satan          One should conduct in a different way.          I've entered your door with infinite trouble.          Would you kick me out the very same day?  _Faust._ Then what will you do for me?  _Mep._   Anything in the world! All things. But          Say first what you would have.          Abundance of gold?  _Faust._ And what can I do with riches?  _Mep._   Good. I see where the shoe pinches.          You will have glory.  _Faust._ Still wrong.  _Mep._   Power, then.  _Faust._ No. I would have a treasure          Which contains all. I wish for youth.          Oh! I would have pleasure,          And love, and caresses,          For youth is the season          When joy most impresses.          One round of enjoyment,          One scene of delight,          Should be my employment          From day-dawn till night.          Oh, I would have pleasure,          And love, and caresses;          If youth you restore me,          My joys I'll renew!  _Mep._   'Tis well--all thou desirest I can give thee.  _Faust._ Ah! but what must I give in return?  _Mep._   'Tis but little:          In this world I will be thy slave,          But down below thou must be mine.  _Faust._ Below!  _Mep._   Below.                   (Unfolding a scroll.)          Come, write. What! does thy hand tremble?          Whence this dire trepidation?          'Tis youth that now awaits thee--Behold!  (At a sign from MEPHISTOPHELES, the scene opens and discloses MARGUERITE, spinning.)  _Faust._ Oh, wonder!  _Mep._   Well, how do you like it?                  (Taking parchment.) _Faust._ Give me the scroll!                      (Signs.) _Mep._   Come on then! And now, master,                   (Taking cup from the table.)          I invite thee to empty a cup,          In which there is neither poison nor death,          But young and vigorous life.  _Faust._                (Taking cup and turning toward Marguerite.)          O beautiful, adorable vision! I drink to thee!      (He drinks the contents of the cup, and is transformed   into a young and handsome man. The vision disappears.)  _Mep._   Come, then.  _Faust._ Say, shall I again behold her?  _Mep._   Most surely!  _Faust._ When?  _Mep._   This very day!  _Faust._ 'Tis well.  _Mep._   Then let's away.  _Both._  'Tis pleasure I covet,          'Tis beauty I crave;          I sigh for its kisses,          Its love I demand!          With ardor unwonted          I long now to burn;          I sigh for the rapture          Of heart and of sense.                 (Exeunt. The curtain falls.)     ACT II.   SCENE I.  _The Kermesse._    (One of the city gates. To the left, an Inn,     bearing the sign of the god Bacchus.)    WAGNER, Students, Burghers, Soldiers, Maidens, and Matrons.  _Studs._ Wine or beer, now, which you will!          So the glass quick you fill!          And replenish at our need:          At our bouts we drink with speed!  _Wag._   Now, young tipplers at the cask,          Don't refuse what I ask--          Drink to glory! drink to love!          Drain the sparkling glass!  _Studs._ We young tipplers at the cask          Won't refuse what you ask--          Here's to glory! here's to love!          Drain the sparkling glass!                    (They drink.)  _Soldiers._ Castles, hearts, or fortresses,               Are to us all one.             Strong towers, maids with fair tresses,               By the brave are won;             He, who hath the art to take them,               Shows no little skill;             He, who knows the way to keep them,               Hath more wisdom still.  _Citizens._ On holy-days and feast-days,          I love to talk of war and battles.          While the toiling crowds around          Worry their brains with affairs,          I stroll calmly to this retreat          On the banks of the gliding river,          And behold the boats which pass          While I leisurely empty my glass.               (Citizens and soldiers go to back of stage.)              (A group of young girls enters.)  _Girls._ Merry fellows come this way,          Yes, they now advance;          Let us, then, our steps delay,          Just to take one glance.         (They go to right of stage.         A second chorus of students enters after them.)  _Studs._ Sprightly maidens now advance,          Watch their conquering airs;          Friends be guarded, lest a glance          Take you unawares.  _Matrons._              (watching the students and young girls).          Behold the silly damsels,          And the foolish young men;          We were once as young as they are,          And as pretty again.    (All join in the following chorus, each singing as follows.)  _Mats._         (to the Maidens).             Ye strive hard to please,             Your object is plain.  _Studs._    Beer or wine, wine or beer,             Nought care I, with heart of cheer.  _Soldiers._ On, then, let's on;             Brave soldiers are we,             To conquest we'll on.  _Citizens._ Come, neighbor! In this fine weather             Let us empty a bottle together!  _Maidens._  They wish to please us, but 'tis in vain!             If you are angry, little you'll gain.  _Young Students._ They"]]]
