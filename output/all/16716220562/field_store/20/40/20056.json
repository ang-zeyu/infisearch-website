I had not been \"called out\" as a corporal, but when I returned from furlough I found myself the last but one--about my standing in all the tactics--of eighteen sergeants.  The promotion was too much for me.  That year my standing in the class--as shown by the number of demerits of the year--was about the same as it was among the sergeants, and I was dropped, and served the fourth year as a private.  During my first year's encampment General Scott visited West Point, and reviewed the cadets.  With his commanding figure, his quite colossal size and showy uniform, I thought him the finest specimen of manhood my eyes had ever beheld, and the most to be envied.  I could never resemble him in appearance, but I believe I did have a presentiment for a moment that some day I should occupy his place on review--although I had no intention then of remaining in the army.  My experience in a horse-trade ten years before, and the ridicule it caused me, were too fresh in my mind for me to communicate this presentiment to even my most intimate chum.  The next summer Martin Van Buren, then President of the United States, visited West Point and reviewed the cadets; he did not impress me with the awe which Scott had inspired.  In fact I regarded General Scott and Captain C. F. Smith, the Commandant of Cadets, as the two men most to be envied in the nation.  I retained a high regard for both up to the day of their death.  The last two years wore away more rapidly than the first two, but they still seemed about five times as long as Ohio years, to me.  At last all the examinations were passed, and the members of the class were called upon to record their choice of arms of service and regiments.  I was anxious to enter the cavalry, or dragoons as they were then called, but there was only one regiment of dragoons in the Army at that time, and attached to that, besides the full complement of officers, there were at least four brevet second lieutenants.  I recorded therefore my first choice, dragoons; second, 4th infantry; and got the latter.  Again there was a furlough--or, more properly speaking, leave of absence for the class were now commissioned officers--this time to the end of September. Again I went to Ohio to spend my vacation among my old school-mates; and again I found a fine saddle horse purchased for my special use, besides a horse and buggy that I could drive--but I was not in a physical condition to enjoy myself quite as well as on the former occasion.  For six months before graduation I had had a desperate cough (\"Tyler's grip\" it was called), and I was very much reduced, weighing but one hundred and seventeen pounds, just my weight at entrance, though I had grown six inches in stature in the mean time.  There was consumption in my father's family, two of his brothers having died of that disease, which made my symptoms more alarming.  The brother and sister next younger than myself died, during the rebellion, of the same disease, and I seemed the most promising subject for it of the three in 1843.  Having made alternate choice of two different arms of service with different uniforms, I could not get a uniform suit until notified of my assignment.  I left my measurement with a tailor, with directions not to make the uniform until I notified him whether it was to be for infantry or dragoons.  Notice did not reach me for several weeks, and then it took at least a week to get the letter of instructions to the tailor and two more to make the clothes and have them sent to me.  This was a time of great suspense.  I was impatient to get on my uniform and see how it looked, and probably wanted my old school-mates, particularly the girls, to see me in it.  The conceit was knocked out of me by two little circumstances that happened soon after the arrival of the clothes, which gave me a distaste for military uniform that I never recovered from.  Soon after the arrival of the suit I donned it, and put off for Cincinnati on horseback.  While I was riding along a street of that city, imagining that every one was looking at me, with a feeling akin to mine when I first saw General Scott, a little urchin, bareheaded, footed, with dirty and ragged pants held up by bare a single gallows--that's what suspenders were called then--and a shirt that had not seen a wash-tub for weeks, turned to me and cried:  \"Soldier! will you work?  No, sir--ee; I'll sell my shirt first!!\" The horse trade and its dire consequences were recalled to mind.  The other circumstance occurred at home.  Opposite our house in Bethel stood the old stage tavern where \"man and beast\" found accommodation, The stable-man was rather dissipated, but possessed of some humor.  On my return I found him parading the streets, and attending in the stable, barefooted, but in a pair of sky-blue nankeen pantaloons--just the color of my uniform trousers--with a strip of white cotton sheeting sewed down the outside seams in imitation of mine.  The joke was a huge one in the mind of many of the people, and was much enjoyed by them; but I did not appreciate it so highly.  During the remainder of my leave of absence, my time was spent in visiting friends in Georgetown and Cincinnati, and occasionally other towns in that part of the State.    CHAPTER III.  ARMY LIFE--CAUSES OF THE MEXICAN WAR--CAMP SALUBRITY.  On the 30th of September I reported for duty at Jefferson Barracks, St. Louis, with the 4th United States infantry.  It was the largest military post in the country at that time, being garrisoned by sixteen companies of infantry, eight of the 3d regiment, the remainder of the 4th. Colonel Steven Kearney, one of the ablest officers of the day, commanded the post, and under him discipline was kept at a high standard, but without vexatious rules or regulations.  Every drill and roll-call had to be attended, but in the intervals officers were permitted to enjoy themselves, leaving the garrison, and going where they pleased, without making written application to state where they were going for how long, etc., so that they were back for their next duty.  It did seem to me, in my early army days, that too many of the older officers, when they came to command posts, made it a study to think what orders they could publish to annoy their subordinates and render them uncomfortable.  I noticed, however, a few years later, when the Mexican war broke out, that most of this class of officers discovered they were possessed of disabilities which entirely incapacitated them for active field service. They had the moral courage to proclaim it, too.  They were right; but they did not always give their disease the right name.  At West Point I had a class-mate--in the last year of our studies he was room-mate also--F. T. Dent, whose family resided some five miles west of Jefferson Barracks.  Two of his unmarried brothers were living at home at that time, and as I had taken with me from Ohio, my horse, saddle and bridle, I soon found my way out to White Haven, the name of the Dent estate.  As I found the family congenial my visits became frequent. There were at home, besides the young men, two daughters, one a school miss of fifteen, the other a girl of eight or nine.  There was still an older daughter of seventeen, who had been spending several years at boarding-school in St. Louis, but who, though through school, had not yet returned home.  She was spending the winter in the city with connections, the family of Colonel John O'Fallon, well known in St. Louis.  In February she returned to her country home.  After that I do not know but my visits became more frequent; they certainly did become more enjoyable.  We would often take walks, or go on horseback to visit the neighbors, until I became quite well acquainted in that vicinity. Sometimes one of the brothers would accompany us, sometimes one of the younger sisters.  If the 4th infantry had remained at Jefferson Barracks it is possible, even probable, that this life might have continued for some years without my finding out that there was anything serious the matter with me; but in the following May a circumstance occurred which developed my sentiment so palpably that there was no mistaking it.  The annexation of Texas was at this time the subject of violent discussion in Congress, in the press, and by individuals.  The administration of President Tyler, then in power, was making the most strenuous efforts to effect the annexation, which was, indeed, the great and absorbing question of the day.  During these discussions the greater part of the single rifle regiment in the army--the 2d dragoons, which had been dismounted a year or two before, and designated \"Dismounted Rifles\"--was stationed at Fort Jessup, Louisiana, some twenty-five miles east of the Texas line, to observe the frontier.  About the 1st of May the 3d infantry was ordered from Jefferson Barracks to Louisiana, to go into camp in the neighborhood of Fort Jessup, and there await further orders.  The troops were embarked on steamers and were on their way down the Mississippi within a few days after the receipt of this order. About the time they started I obtained a leave of absence for twenty days to go to Ohio to visit my parents.  I was obliged to go to St. Louis to take a steamer for Louisville or Cincinnati, or the first steamer going up the Ohio River to any point.  Before I left St. Louis orders were received at Jefferson Barracks for the 4th infantry to follow the 3d.  A messenger was sent after me to stop my leaving; but before he could reach me I was off, totally ignorant of these events.  A day or two after my arrival at Bethel I received a letter from a classmate and fellow lieutenant in the 4th, informing me of the circumstances related above, and advising me not to open any letter post marked St. Louis or Jefferson Barracks, until the expiration of my leave, and saying that he would pack up my things"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4367"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Complete (#5)"],["body","take them along for me.  His advice was not necessary, for no other letter was sent to me.  I now discovered that I was exceedingly anxious to get back to Jefferson Barracks, and I understood the reason without explanation from any one.  My leave of absence required me to report for duty, at Jefferson Barracks, at the end of twenty days.  I knew my regiment had gone up the Red River, but I was not disposed to break the letter of my leave; besides, if I had proceeded to Louisiana direct, I could not have reached there until after the expiration of my leave.  Accordingly, at the end of the twenty days, I reported for duty to Lieutenant Ewell, commanding at Jefferson Barracks, handing him at the same time my leave of absence.  After noticing the phraseology of the order--leaves of absence were generally worded, \"at the end of which time he will report for duty with his proper command\"--he said he would give me an order to join my regiment in Louisiana.  I then asked for a few days' leave before starting, which he readily granted.  This was the same Ewell who acquired considerable reputation as a Confederate general during the rebellion.  He was a man much esteemed, and deservedly so, in the old army, and proved himself a gallant and efficient officer in two wars --both in my estimation unholy.  I immediately procured a horse and started for the country, taking no baggage with me, of course.  There is an insignificant creek--the Gravois--between Jefferson Barracks and the place to which I was going, and at that day there was not a bridge over it from its source to its mouth.  There is not water enough in the creek at ordinary stages to run a coffee mill, and at low water there is none running whatever.  On this occasion it had been raining heavily, and, when the creek was reached, I found the banks full to overflowing, and the current rapid.  I looked at it a moment to consider what to do.  One of my superstitions had always been when I started to go any where, or to do anything, not to turn back, or stop until the thing intended was accomplished.  I have frequently started to go to places where I had never been and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road, and if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in by the other side.  So I struck into the stream, and in an instant the horse was swimming and I being carried down by the current.  I headed the horse towards the other bank and soon reached it, wet through and without other clothes on that side of the stream.  I went on, however, to my destination and borrowed a dry suit from my --future--brother-in-law.  We were not of the same size, but the clothes answered every purpose until I got more of my own.  Before I returned I mustered up courage to make known, in the most awkward manner imaginable, the discovery I had made on learning that the 4th infantry had been ordered away from Jefferson Barracks.  The young lady afterwards admitted that she too, although until then she had never looked upon me other than as a visitor whose company was agreeable to her, had experienced a depression of spirits she could not account for when the regiment left.  Before separating it was definitely understood that at a convenient time we would join our fortunes, and not let the removal of a regiment trouble us.  This was in May, 1844.  It was the 22d of August, 1848, before the fulfilment of this agreement.  My duties kept me on the frontier of Louisiana with the Army of Observation during the pendency of Annexation; and afterwards I was absent through the war with Mexico, provoked by the action of the army, if not by the annexation itself. During that time there was a constant correspondence between Miss Dent and myself, but we only met once in the period of four years and three months.  In May, 1845, I procured a leave for twenty days, visited St. Louis, and obtained the consent of the parents for the union, which had not been asked for before.  As already stated, it was never my intention to remain in the army long, but to prepare myself for a professorship in some college.  Accordingly, soon after I was settled at Jefferson Barracks, I wrote a letter to Professor Church--Professor of Mathematics at West Point--requesting him to ask my designation as his assistant, when next a detail had to be made. Assistant professors at West Point are all officers of the army, supposed to be selected for their special fitness for the particular branch of study they are assigned to teach.  The answer from Professor Church was entirely satisfactory, and no doubt I should have been detailed a year or two later but for the Mexican War coming on. Accordingly I laid out for myself a course of studies to be pursued in garrison, with regularity, if not persistency.  I reviewed my West Point course of mathematics during the seven months at Jefferson Barracks, and read many valuable historical works, besides an occasional novel.  To help my memory I kept a book in which I would write up, from time to time, my recollections of all I had read since last posting it.  When the regiment was ordered away, I being absent at the time, my effects were packed up by Lieutenant Haslett, of the 4th infantry, and taken along.  I never saw my journal after, nor did I ever keep another, except for a portion of the time while travelling abroad.  Often since a fear has crossed my mind lest that book might turn up yet, and fall into the hands of some malicious person who would publish it.  I know its appearance would cause me as much heart-burning as my youthful horse-trade, or the later rebuke for wearing uniform clothes.  The 3d infantry had selected camping grounds on the reservation at Fort Jessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine.  Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await further instructions.  Those authorized to do so selected a place in the pine woods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about three miles from each, and on high ground back from the river.  The place was given the name of Camp Salubrity, and proved entitled to it. The camp was on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, in front and rear.  The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water, and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in that region in great multitudes and of great voracity.  In the valley they swarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge.  The regiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred, and that was caused by an accident.  There was no intimation given that the removal of the 3d and 4th regiments of infantry to the western border of Louisiana was occasioned in any way by the prospective annexation of Texas, but it was generally understood that such was the case. Ostensibly we were intended to prevent filibustering into Texas, but really as a menace to Mexico in case she appeared to contemplate war.  Generally the officers of the army were indifferent whether the annexation was consummated or not; but not so all of them.  For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.  It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory.  Texas was originally a state belonging to the republic of Mexico.  It extended from the Sabine River on the east to the Rio Grande on the west, and from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and east to the territory of the United States and New Mexico--another Mexican state at that time--on the north and west.  An empire in territory, it had but a very sparse population, until settled by Americans who had received authority from Mexico to colonize. These colonists paid very little attention to the supreme government, and introduced slavery into the state almost from the start, though the constitution of Mexico did not, nor does it now, sanction that institution.  Soon they set up an independent government of their own, and war existed, between Texas and Mexico, in name from that time until 1836, when active hostilities very nearly ceased upon the capture of Santa Anna, the Mexican President. Before long, however, the same people--who with permission of Mexico had colonized Texas, and afterwards set up slavery there, and then seceded as soon as they felt strong enough to do so--offered themselves and the State to the United States, and in 1845 their offer was accepted.  The occupation, separation and annexation were, from the inception of the movement to its final consummation, a conspiracy to acquire territory out of which slave states might be formed for the American Union.  Even if the annexation itself could be justified, the manner in which the subsequent war was forced upon Mexico cannot.  The fact is, annexationists wanted more territory than they could possibly lay any claim to, as part of the new acquisition. Texas, as an independent State, never had exercised jurisdiction over the territory between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Mexico had never recognized the independence of Texas, and maintained that, even if independent, the State had no claim south of the Nueces.  I am aware that a treaty, made by the Texans with Santa Anna while he was under duress, ceded all the territory between the Nueces and the Rio Grande--, but he was a prisoner of war when the treaty was made, and his life was in jeopardy.  He knew, too, that he deserved execution at the hands of the Texans, if they should ever capture him.  The Texans, if they had taken his life, would have only followed the example set by Santa Anna himself a few years before, when he executed the entire garrison of"]]]
