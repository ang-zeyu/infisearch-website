Your reason must perceive that you ask too much.  I would willingly assist you in sparing the feelings of Count Ammiani; and, believe me, gratitude is the last thing I require to stimulate my services.  You ask too much; you must see that you ask too much.\"  \"I do,\" said Vittoria.  \"Good-night, Wilfrid.\"  He was startled to find her going, and lost his equable voice in trying to detain her.  She sought relief in Laura's bosom, to whom she recapitulated the interview.  \"Is it possible,\" Laura said, looking at her intently, \"that you do not recognize the folly of telling this Lieutenant Pierson that you were pleading to him on behalf of your lover?  Could anything be so monstrous, when one can see that he is malleable to the twist of your little finger? Are you only half a woman, that you have no consciousness of your power? Probably you can allow yourself--enviable privilege!--to suppose that he called you down at this late hour simply to inform you that he is compelled to do something which will cause you unhappiness!  I repeat, it is an enviable privilege.  Now, when the real occasion has come for you to serve us, you have not a single weapon--except these tears, which you are wasting on my lap.  Be sure that if he denounces Angelo, Angelo's life cries out against you.  You have but to quicken your brain to save him.  Did he expose his life for you or not?  I knew that he was in Meran,\" the signora continued sadly.  \"The paper which frightened the silly peasants, revealed to me that he was there, needing help.  I told you Angelo was under an evil star.  I thought my day to-morrow would be a day of scheming.  The task has become easy, if you will.\"  \"Be merciful; the task is dreadful,\" said Vittoria.  \"The task is simple.  You have an instrument ready to your hands.  You can do just what you like with him--make an Italian of him; make him renounce his engagement to this pert little Lena of Lenkenstein, break his sword, play Arlecchino, do what you please.  He is not required for any outrageous performance.  A week, and Angelo will have recovered his strength; you likewise may resume the statuesque demeanour which you have been exhibiting here.  For the space of one week you are asked for some natural exercise of your wits and compliancy.  Hitherto what have you accomplished, pray?\"  Laura struck spitefully at Vittoria's degraded estimation of her worth as measured by events.  \"You have done nothing-- worse than nothing.  It gives me horrors to find it necessary to entreat you to look your duty in the face and do it, that even three or four Italian hearts--Carlo among them--may thank you.  Not Carlo, you say?\" (Vittoria had sobbed, \"No, not Carlo.\") \"How little you know men!  How little do you think how the obligations of the hour should affect a creature deserving life!  Do you fancy that Carlo wishes you to be for ever reading the line of a copy-book and shaping your conduct by it?  Our Italian girls do this; he despises them.  Listen to me; do not I know what is meant by the truth of love?  I pass through fire, and keep constant to it; but you have some vile Romance of Chivalry in your head; a modern sculptor's figure, 'MEDITATION;' that is the sort of bride you would give him in the stirring days of Italy.  Do you think it is only a statue that can be true?  Perceive--will you not--that this Lieutenant Pierson is your enemy.  He tells you as much; surely the challenge is fair?  Defeat him as you best can.  Angelo shall not be abandoned.\"  \"O me! it is unendurable; you are merciless,\" said Vittoria, shuddering.  She saw the vile figure of herself aping smirks and tender meanings to her old lover.  It was a picture that she dared not let her mind rest on: how then could she personate it?  All through her life she had been frank; as a young woman, she was clear of soul; she felt that her, simplicity was already soiled by the bare comprehension of the abominable course indicated by Laura.  Degradation seemed to have been a thing up to this moment only dreamed of; but now that it was demanded of her to play coquette and trick her womanhood with false allurements, she knew the sentiment of utter ruin; she was ashamed.  No word is more lightly spoken than shame.  Vittoria's early devotion to her Art, and subsequently to her Italy, had carried her through the term when she would otherwise have showed the natural mild attack of the disease.  It came on her now in a rush, penetrating every chamber of her heart, overwhelming her; she could see no distinction between being ever so little false and altogether despicable.  She had loathings of her body and her life.  With grovelling difficulty of speech she endeavoured to convey the sense of her repugnance to Laura, who leaned her ear, wondering at such bluntness of wit in a woman, and said, \"Are you quite deficient in the craft of your sex, child?  You can, and you will, guard yourself ten times better when your aim is simply to subject him.\"  But this was not reason to a spirit writhing in the serpent-coil of fiery blushes.  Vittoria said, \"I shall pity him so.\"  She meant she would pity Wilfrid in deluding him.  It was a taint of the hypocrisy which comes with shame.  The signora retorted: \"I can't follow the action of your mind a bit.\"  Pity being a form of tenderness, Laura supposed that she would intuitively hate the man who compelled her to do what she abhorred.  They spent the greater portion of the night in this debate.     CHAPTER XXVIII  THE ESCAPE OF ANGELO  Vittoria knew better than Laura that the task was easy; she had but to override her aversion to the show of trifling with a dead passion; and when she thought of Angelo lying helpless in the swarm of enemies, and that Wilfrid could consent to use his tragic advantage to force her to silly love-play, his selfishness wrought its reflection, so that she became sufficiently unjust to forget her marvellous personal influence over him.  Even her tenacious sentiment concerning his white uniform was clouded.  She very soon ceased to be shamefaced in her own fancy.  At dawn she stood at her window looking across the valley of Meran, and felt the whole scene in a song of her heart, with the faintest recollection of her having passed through a tempest overnight.  The warm Southern glow of the enfoliaged valley recalled her living Italy, and Italy her voice. She grew wakefully glad: it was her nature, not her mind, that had twisted in the convulsions of last night's horror of shame.  The chirp of healthy blood in full-flowing veins dispersed it; and as a tropical atmosphere is cleared by the hurricane, she lost her depression and went down among her enemies possessed by an inner delight, that was again of her nature, not of her mind.  She took her gladness for a happy sign that she had power to rise buoyant above circumstances; and though aware that she was getting to see things in harsh outlines, she was unconscious of her haggard imagination.  The Lenkensteins had projected to escape the blandishments of Vienna by residing during the winter in Venice, where Wilfrid and his sister were to be the guests of the countess:--a pleasant prospect that was dashed out by an official visit from Colonel Zofel of the Meran garrison, through whom it was known that Lieutenant Pierson, while enjoying his full liberty to investigate the charms of the neighbourhood, might not extend his excursions beyond a pedestrian day's limit;--he was, in fact, under surveillance.  The colonel formally exacted his word of honour that he would not attempt to pass the bounds, and explained to the duchess that the injunction was favourable to the lieutenant, as implying that he must be ready at any moment to receive the order to join his regiment. Wilfrid bowed with a proper soldierly submission.  Respecting the criminal whom his men were pursuing, Colonel Zofel said that he was sparing no efforts to come on his traces; he supposed, from what he had heard in the Ultenthal, that Guidascarpi was on his back somewhere within a short range of Meran.  Vittoria strained her ears to the colonel's German; she fancied his communication to be that he suspected Angelo's presence in Meran.  The official part of his visit being terminated, the colonel addressed some questions to the duchess concerning the night of the famous Fifteenth at La Scala.  He was an amateur, and spoke with enthusiasm of the reports of the new prima donna.  The duchess perceived that he was asking for an introduction to the heroine of the night, and graciously said that perhaps that very prima donna would make amends, to him for his absence on the occasion.  Vittoria checked a movement of revolt in her frame.  She cast an involuntary look at Wilfrid.  \"Now it begins,\" she thought, and went to the piano: she had previously refused to sing. Wilfrid had to bend his head over his betrothed and listen to her whisperings.  He did so, carelessly swaying his hand to the measure of the aria, with an increasing bitter comparison of the two voices.  Lena persisted in talking; she was indignant at his abandonment of the journey to Venice; she reproached him as feeble, inconsiderate, indifferent. Then for an instant she would pause to hear the voice, and renew her assault.  \"We ought to be thankful that she is not singing a song of death and destruction to us!  The archduchess is coming to Venice. If you are presented to her and please her, and get the writs of naturalization prepared, you will be one of us completely, and your fortune is made.  If you stay here--why should you stay?  It is nothing but your uncle's caprice.  I am too angry to care for music.  If you stay, you will earn my contempt.  I will not be buried another week in such a place.  I am tired of weeping.  We all go to Venice: Captain Weisspriess follows us.  We are to have endless Balls, an opera, a Court there--with whom"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4439"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 5 (#8)"],["body"," I to dance, pray, when I am out of mourning?  Am I to sit and govern my feet under a chair, and gaze like an imbecile nun?  It is too preposterous.  I am betrothed to you; I wish, I wish to behave like a betrothed.  The archduchess herself will laugh to see me chained to a chair.  I shall have to reply a thousand times to 'Where is he?' What can I answer?  'Wouldn't come,' will be the only true reply.\"  During this tirade, Vittoria was singing one of her old songs, well known to Wilfrid, which brought the vision of a foaming weir, and moonlight between the branches of a great cedar-tree, and the lost love of his heart sitting by his side in the noising stillness.  He was sure that she could be singing it for no one but for him.  The leap taken by his spirit from this time to that, was shorter than from the past back to the present.  \"You do not applaud,\" said Lena, when the song had ceased.  He murmured: \"I never do, in drawing-rooms.\"  \"A cantatrice expects it everywhere; these creatures live on it.\"  \"I'll tell her, if you like, what we thought of it, when I take her down to my sister, presently.\"  \"Are you not to take me down?\"  \"The etiquette is to hand her up to you.\"  \"No, no!\" Lena insisted, in abhorrence of etiquette; but Wilfrid said pointedly that his sister's feelings must be spared.  \"Her husband is an animal: he is a millionaire city-of-London merchant; conceive him!  He has drunk himself gouty on Port wine, and here he is for the grape-cure.\"  \"Ah! in that England of yours, women marry for wealth,\" said Lena.  \"Yes, in your Austria they have a better motive\" he interpreted her sentiment.  \"Say, in our Austria.\"  \"In our Austria, certainly.\"  \"And with our holy religion?\"  \"It is not yet mine.\"  \"It will be?\" She put the question eagerly.  Wilfrid hesitated, and by his adept hesitation succeeded in throwing her off the jealous scent.  \"Say that it will be, my Wilfrid!\"  \"You must give me time\"  \"This subject always makes you cold.\"  \"My own Lena!\"  \"Can I be, if we are doomed to be parted when we die?\"  There is small space for compunction in a man's heart when he is in Wilfrid's state, burning with the revival of what seemed to him a superhuman attachment.  He had no design to break his acknowledged bondage to Countess Lena, and answered her tender speech almost as tenderly.  It never occurred to him, as he was walking down to Meran with Vittoria, that she could suppose him to be bartering to help rescue the life of a wretched man in return for soft confidential looks of entreaty; nor did he reflect, that when cast on him, they might mean no more than the wish to move him for a charitable purpose.  The completeness of her fascination was shown by his reading her entirely by his own emotions, so that a lowly-uttered word, or a wavering unwilling glance, made him think that she was subdued by the charm of the old days.  \"Is it here?\" she said, stopping under the first Italian name she saw in the arcade of shops.  \"How on earth have you guessed it?\" he asked, astonished.  She told him to wait at the end of the arcade, and passed in.  When she joined him again, she was downcast.  They went straight to Adela's hotel, where the one thing which gave her animation was the hearing that Mr. Sedley had met an English doctor there, and had placed himself in his hands.  Adela dressed splendidly for her presentation to the duchess. Having done so, she noticed Vittoria's depressed countenance and difficult breathing.  She commanded her to see the doctor.  Vittoria consented, and made use of him.  She could tell Laura confidently at night that Wilfrid would not betray Angelo, though she had not spoken one direct word to him on the subject.  Wilfrid was peculiarly adept in the idle game he played.  One who is intent upon an evil end is open to expose his plan.  But he had none in view; he lived for the luxurious sensation of being near the woman who fascinated him, and who was now positively abashed when by his side. Adela suggested to him faintly--she believed it was her spontaneous idea --that he might be making his countess jealous.  He assured her that the fancy sprang from scenes which she remembered, and that she could have no idea of the pride of a highborn Austrian girl, who was incapable of conceiving jealousy of a person below her class.  Adela replied that it was not his manner so much as Emilia's which might arouse the suspicion; but she immediately affected to appreciate the sentiments of a highborn Austrian girl toward a cantatrice, whose gifts we regard simply as an aristocratic entertainment.  Wilfrid induced his sister to relate Vittoria's early history to Countess Lena; and himself almost wondered, when he heard it in bare words, at that haunting vision of the glory of Vittoria at La Scala--where, as he remembered, he would have run against destruction to cling to her lips.  Adela was at first alarmed by the concentrated wrathfulness which she discovered in the bosom of Countess Anna, who, as their intimacy waxed, spoke of the intruding opera siren in terms hardly proper even to married women; but it seemed right, as being possibly aristocratic.  Lena was much more tolerant.  \"I have just the same enthusiasm for soldiers that my Wilfrid has for singers,\" she said; and it afforded Adela exquisite pleasure to hear her tell how that she had originally heard of the 'eccentric young Englishman,' General Pierson's nephew, as a Lustspiel--a comedy; and of his feats on horseback, and his duels, and his--he was very wicked over here, you know;\" Lena laughed.  She assumed the privileges of her four-and-twenty years and her rank.  Her marriage was to take place in the Spring.  She announced it with the simplicity of an independent woman of the world, adding, \"That is, if my Wilfrid will oblige me by not plunging into further disgrace with the General.\"  \"No; you will not marry a man who is under a cloud,\" Anna subjoined.  \"Certainly not a soldier,\" said Lena.  \"What it was exactly that he did at La Scala, I don't know, and don't care to know, but he was then ignorant that she had touched the hand of that Guidascarpi.  I decide by this--he was valiant; he defied everybody: therefore I forgive him.  He is not in disgrace with me.  I will reinstate him.\"  \"You have your own way of being romantic,\" said Anna.  \"A soldier who forgets his duty is in my opinion only a brave fool.\"  \"It seems to me that a great many gallant officers are fond of fine voices,\" Lena retorted.  \"No doubt it is a fashion among them,\" said Anna.  Adela recoiled with astonishment when she began to see the light in which the sisters regarded Vittoria; and she was loyal enough to hint and protest on her friend's behalf.  The sisters called her a very good soul. \"It may not be in England as over here,\" said Anna.  \"We have to submit to these little social scourges.\"  Lena whispered to Adela, \"An angry woman will think the worst.  I have no doubt of my Wilfrid.  If I had!--\"  Her eyes flashed.  Fire was not wanting in her.  The difficulties which tasked the amiable duchess to preserve an outward show of peace among the antagonistic elements she gathered together were increased by the arrival at the castle of Count Lenkenstein, Bianca's husband, and head of the family, from Bologna.  He was a tall and courtly man, who had one face for his friends and another for the reverse party; which is to say, that his manners could be bad.  Count Lenkenstein was accompanied by Count Serabiglione, who brought Laura's children with their Roman nurse, Assunta.  Laura kissed her little ones, and sent them out of her sight.  Vittoria found her home in their play and prattle. She needed a refuge, for Count Lenkenstein was singularly brutal in his bearing toward her.  He let her know that he had come to Meran to superintend the hunt for the assassin, Angelo Guidascarpi.  He attempted to exact her promise in precise speech that she would be on the spot to testify against Angelo when that foul villain should be caught.  He objected openly to Laura's children going about with her.  Bitter talk on every starting subject was exchanged across the duchess's table. She herself was in disgrace on Laura's account, and had to practise an overflowing sweetness, with no one to second her efforts.  The two noblemen spoke in accord on the bubble revolution.  The strong hand--ay, the strong hand!  The strong hand disposes of vermin.  Laura listened to them, pallid with silent torture.  \"Since the rascals have taken to assassination, we know that we have them at the dregs,\" said Count Lenkenstein.  \"A cord round the throats of a few scores of them, and the country will learn the virtue of docility.\"  Laura whispered to her sister: \"Have you espoused a hangman?\"  Such dropping of deadly shells in a quiet society went near to scattering it violently; but the union was necessitous.  Count Lenkenstein desired to confront Vittoria with Angelo; Laura would not quit her side, and Amalia would not expel her friend.  Count Lenkenstein complained roughly of Laura's conduct; nor did Laura escape her father's reproof.  \"Sir, you are privileged to say what you will to me,\" she responded, with the humility which exasperated him.  \"Yes, you bend, you bend, that you may be stiff-necked when it suits you,\" he snapped her short.  \"Surely that is the text of the sermon you preach to our Italy!\"  \"A little more, as you are running on now, madame, and our Italy will be froth on the lips.  You see, she is ruined.\"  \"Chi lo fa, lo sa,\" hummed Laura; \"but I would avoid quoting you as that authority.\"  \"After your last miserable fiasco, my dear!\"  \"It was another of our school exercises.  We had not been good boys and girls.  We had learnt our lesson imperfectly.  We have received our punishment, and we mean to do better next time.\"  \"Behave seasonably, fittingly; be less of a wasp; school your tongue.\"  \"Bianca is a pattern to me, I am aware,\" said Laura.  \"She is a good wife.\"  \"I am a poor widow.\""]]]
