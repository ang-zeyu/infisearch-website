I need hardly tell you how we frequently \"took sweet counsel together,\" while he remained in the hospital; but his complaint getting better, he was ordered to his duty, which truly I was very sorry for. But by God's kindness in sending me this instructor, I was put into the way that leads to everlasting life; and my mind being led into \"wisdom's ways, which are pleasantness and peace,\" my body began gradually to recover.  The flux, however, still continuing, and keeping me in a state of extreme weakness, I was advised by one of my fifers to take a dose of corks and wine without the doctor's knowledge, since all his medicine hitherto appeared ineffectual for stopping the flow of blood. I was rather averse to this prescription, which was a pint of wine, made as warm as I could possibly drink it, and a burnt cork reduced to a powder and mixed with it, and this dose I was to take for three nights; and, to encourage me, he said some of our former regiment were cured by it when we were in Ireland. I accordingly took this horse medicine with great difficulty; and you may easily imagine that it could not be otherwise, considering that I had eaten nothing for about a fortnight; and more particularly, that my mouth was perfectly raw with the mercury which is given in obstinate cases of this disease, and the cork stuck in my throat, so that it was hardly possible for me to get it over; however, I got it managed for the three nights; but never would I advise a friend of mine to try such an experiment, for the pain of the flux was never so severe as that produced by this savage dose. After being a few days in this extreme pain, the flux of blood disappeared, and I got gradually better, but I have never enjoyed my former health; and, I believe, stopping the blood so suddenly was permanently unfavourable to my constitution.  I must not omit informing you, that my good friend the Colonel, with whom I enlisted in Dublin, used to pay me a visit frequently; and finding me in better health and spirits than formerly, he told the doctor to let me want for nothing which could be of service to me. The doctor then inquired very particularly into my case. I told him the blood had left me, and that my mouth was rather better. He ordered me a pint of wine every day, and a bit of fowl for dinner. In a word, by the blessing of God, I got a good deal better, and left the hospital upon the 9th November; but I had not been at my duty many days, when an order came for seven companies to go to Madras, by a frigate and two country ships, which were ready for us in the bay. We embarked upon the 25th November, the staff and light company went on board of La Dedaigneuse, a frigate formerly taken from the French; and the rest of the regiment (except two companies left at the island) went on board of the two country ships. We had a very rough passage, having high winds, swelling seas, and a leaky ship; and being exposed to the weather, as we took our watch upon deck in turns, I was again seized with a severe flux. The Colonel, seeing me one day on deck, inquired very kindly how I was? I told him the truth; and he was very angry that I should expose myself in such weather, especially after my late severe illness. I made the best apology I could, but he was not satisfied, and desired me to go to the surgeon and let my case be known. He likewise asked me what liquor I received? I told him half a pint of arrack daily; but I said that I did not think that it was agreeing with me. So he spoke to the doctor, who ordered me a pint of wine in place of it, and to keep myself constantly below. The frigate, as I have stated above, was very leaky; and having to encounter a dreadful hurricane during four nights and days, it was with difficulty that the crew, with the assistance of the soldiers, could keep her afloat. We were three weeks upon this passage without any deaths, except one man who fell overboard; but it was indeed a very disagreeable voyage, for we could not keep our provisions from getting wet by the sea rushing in between every plank! You may think it strange that one of his Majesty's ships of war was suffered to be in this leaky condition; but it would have taken a very tight vessel indeed to have ridden this storm without making a considerable quantity of water; and, moreover, she was ordered for dock as soon as she reached the harbour.  The manner of landing persons on this coast may not be unworthy of the reader's attention. The best boats belonging to his Majesty's navy dare not venture through the prodigious surf that runs every where on the beach, and you may often see the captains of the Indiamen or Men-of-war, obliged to leave their elegant boats and fine-dressed crews outside the surf, and get on board of what are called Massulah boats, to be rowed ashore by natives. These boats are constructed nearly like our own, but are considerably deeper. The planks are sewed together by small cocoa-nut ropes, instead of being nailed, and they are caulked by the cocoa-nut hemp (if I may call it so) of which the ropes are made.  When the passengers are all seated, the boatmen begin their rowing, which they accompany with a kind of song, until they approach the breakers, when the boatswain gives the alarm, and all is activity among the rowers; for if they did not pay great attention to avoid the wave in the act of breaking, the boat would run every risk of being swamped. The most severe part of the boat's usage is when she strikes the beach the first time, which generally tumbles the passengers upon one another like a heap. The boatmen must not attempt to jump out and pull her ashore after the first breaker, for the wave that makes her strike runs past a considerable distance, and then returns, rushing down the declivity of the beach with irresistible force, carrying her along with it; but before the next wave overtakes them the boat has gained a little by rowing, so that the second shock is less formidable; and, on the third, they jump out in a moment, and lay hold on a rope fastened to the bow on purpose, and thereby hold her fast till the passengers get ashore. Were our boats to get such usage it would knock them to staves.  After our landing, we were encamped upon the south esplanade, which divides Fort St. George from the original town of Madras.     CHAPTER V.   I do not here intend to give a particular account of Madras; but as your curiosity may be somewhat excited, I will gratify it a little, by giving you a kind of general description. Madras, or Fort St. George, (sometimes distinguished into Black Town and White Town,) the principal settlement of the British, on the coast of Coromandel, has a very beautiful appearance from the sea; and the first sight of this place is not calculated to spoil the picture which a sanguine imagination draws to itself. The clear, blue, cloudless sky, and the polished white buildings, of which there is a great number, both in the Fort and along the beach, present a combination entirely new to the British traveller, which is well fitted to give him a very exalted idea of India, and lead him to imagine, after being so long out of the sight of land, that he is entering a new world, something far superior to that which he has left. But it is with this as with the work of the painter; for it looks best at a distance. That part of the town which is within the fortress can boast indeed of several fine streets; and the houses being covered with a kind of stucco, called _chunam_, which is capable of a polish little inferior to marble, have a very elegant and lively appearance: but as to the houses of the original town, sometimes called by the natives, Madras _Patnam_, (which signifies _superior_,) no rule seems to have been followed but that of contrast; for the fine white polished buildings of the European, the Persian, or the Indian merchant, are promiscuously interspersed with the most wretched mud-walled cocoa-nut covered huts of the poorest native: and the confused, irregular, unpaved streets, render it one of the dirtiest places possible in wet weather. There are a number of meeting-houses here for the various religious professors; but that which has the most respectable appearance, (the protestant church of Fort St. George excepted,) belongs to the Armenians. The appearances of the natives also are extremely varied; and we find it hold good here, as in other parts of the world, \"that the poor and the rich meet together;\" for we here see some carried in palanquins shoulder high, and others performing all the offices of drudgery; while some are riding in their bullock coaches, others are walking on foot, following their various employments; while some are riding upon horses, well clothed, with ear-rings the circumference of a large tea-cup, others are hardly able to walk, but literally, \"wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\" That feature in the female character which has been general in all ages, is also very prominent in this place: for we find many of the wealthy of that sex adorned with all the varieties of toys mentioned by the prophet, \"walking with stretched forth necks, and wanton eyes; walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;\" but it is the less to be wondered at, that these poor creatures should take such a pride in showing themselves off, as they think, with these butterfly ornaments; for they know no better: but it is truly a pity, as well as a great sin, that the daughters of Zion in our own land should so far follow their example, and expose themselves to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45531"],["title","Narrative of the Life and Travels of Serjeant B—— (#8)"],["body","of the Lord for the sake of a few trinkets, as those women did in the days of the prophet. Because it is very evident, that it was the sin which these daughters of Zion contracted, by setting their affections upon these vanities of ornaments, that was the cause of God denouncing his judgments against them. It would surely be infinitely better, to adorn themselves according to the direction of the apostle; \"whose adorning,\" said he, \"let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is, in the sight of God, of great price.\"  While our regiment lay at Madras, we were infested by the natives offering themselves for servants, and many of them did get into place; but, I believe those that took them would have been much better without servants, for they plundered them of what they could get, and then went their way[2].            [2] Most of these fellows belonged to the thieving bazaar,           (a market here for receiving and selling stolen goods,) and           took this method of obtaining some booty. I think it is a           great shame (to say no worse of it) that such a place should           be protected by law; for the goods taken from us could not           be gotten from thence unless they were regularly paid for,           in the same manner as if we had never seen them; but if the           thief was caught before he reached the bounds assigned for           the bazaar, he could be prosecuted and punished. As a proof           of what I have stated, Captain M'Lean of our regiment had           his regimental coat stolen, and it was found there, but he           durst not touch it without agreeing with the bazaar man for           a certain sum. However, before I left the country, they were           much restricted, no goods being allowed to be publicly           exposed until four o'clock in the afternoon.  We lay in camp upon the south esplanade until the 20th, when we got the route for Wallajahbad. This being our first march in the country, we had our provisions and baggage carried free, but very few of us thought much of the meat, and less of the liquor; for the arrack used to be standing all night in cocoa-nut shells, and spilled upon the ground in the morning when we marched. It would have been well for the far greater part of our regiment, had this indifference to that liquor continued; but, alas! it was far otherwise, as I yet may have cause to observe.  We came to Wallajahbad upon the 24th December, 1807. This place was to us according to its name, for it proved very _bad_ to our regiment; the men, women, and children, dying almost every day. As fife-major of the regiment, it was part of my duty to warn a fifer for the funeral party always upon evening parade, for the following day; and there were twelve days successively that the fifer for the funeral was wanted. Although there were none dead at the time, I ordered him to be in readiness; and for that space of time, we never missed one day without having less or more paying the debt of nature. If a man died at night, he was buried in the morning; and if through the day, he was interred in the evening. Amongst the many that died at this time, my old musical friend Allan was one. He was cut off by water in the head; but the disorder that carried off almost all the rest was the bloody flux, or dysentery.  About this time the grenadier company (which had parted with us upon our voyage to get their ship refitted) joined us[3], and also the two companies from Prince of Wales's Island. The grenadiers were, in general, envied by the rest of the regiment for their healthy appearance; but, alas! that did not long continue; for no less than twenty-one of these robust looking men went the way of all living in the course of one month.            [3] The grenadiers who were on board of the East India           Company's ship, Surat Castle, had been obliged to part with           the fleet, in consequence of the leaky state of that vessel,           when we were near the latitudes of South America, and with           difficulty reached the port of Rio Janeiro. But had it not           been for the extraordinary exertions of these able-bodied           men, the ship, and every soul on board, must, in all human           probability have perished; for they were under the absolute           necessity of working the pumps night and day for a           considerable time before they reached that port, and,           notwithstanding all their endeavours, the water gained upon           them to such a degree as to be two or three feet deep upon           the harlop deck; but in spite of their excessive hardships           and fatigues, that company was the most healthy of any in           the regiment. For during the whole voyage they had very           little sickness, and none of their numbers diminished by           death, in a natural way. They had, indeed, one struck dead           by a thunderbolt, and another killed by the natives of a           certain island, where they touched for a supply of fresh           water. The way that this man came into the power of these           savages was as follows:--A party of the grenadiers were sent           ashore with a few water casks to get them filled, and while           they were performing this piece of duty, some           misunderstanding took place between them and the natives;           and the soldiers not being aware that they were going to get           such rude treatment, were quite unprepared with weapons           offensive or defensive, so that some of them were cut and           mangled most dreadfully by their assailants. But the man I           allude to, whose name I do not recollect, and another of the           name of Campbell, with whom I was very intimate, wrested           each a weapon from the blacks, and, as the saying is, \"made           their own sticks break their own heads;\" and, in this manner           fought their way, retreating backward toward the boat, which           some of their companions had reached; but before they could           attain their object, the poor fellow sunk under the repeated           blows of his overpowering enemies, and Campbell received           seven severe wounds, several of which were in the head.           Those who had not the good fortune to reach the boat were           taken prisoners. No sooner did the news of this disaster           reach the ship than the officers were fired with indignation           at the treatment which their men had received, and the           soldiers, particularly, for losing several of their           comrades, while those who escaped came on board streaming           with blood. Such outrages were not to be tamely submitted to           by those who had not only the name, but also the courage, of           British soldiers. Orders were immediately given for the men           to get ready their arms and ammunition, to go in quest of           their companions who were detained ashore, and these orders           were attended to with all the alertness that could have been           displayed had the ship been on fire, and they themselves           obliged to fly for their lives to a safe and commodious           shelter. No sooner were the grenadiers landed than they           marched steadily towards a town not far from the shore,           where the king lived, defying all opposition to their           progress, and striking terror into the hearts of every           beholder. And when they reached the place, the determined           countenances of the men, and the dazzling appearance of           their shining arms, so enervated the hearts and arms of his           majesty's loyal subjects, that they could make little           resistance until our party was in the royal presence itself.           One of the men, named John Love, literally took the poor           trembling Nabob by the neck like a dog, and the royal suite,           seeing his majesty treated so unceremoniously, perceived           well what was to be their fate if they continued to hold the           soldiers in their place of confinement, and therefore           prudently made all the haste in their power to restore them           to the embraces of their brave mess-mates, who all returned           to the ship in safety, and were warmly received by those on           board. My wife has now the pillow that the Captain gave to           Campbell, to lay under his mangled head, after he went on           board. However, with proper medical attendance, and kind           treatment, he recovered, and was raised to the rank and pay           of serjeant after the company joined in Wallajahbad.  _March 3, 1808_, I was married to Mrs. Allan. This is the circumstance I told you to mark before we left England, after I had obtained liberty from Colonel Stewart for her to go with her husband. But I had then very little knowledge that I was taking out a wife for myself, and one too, that was to be the means in the hand of Divine Providence of prolonging my days, for had it not been for her nursing care, I must, in all human probability, have gone the way of hundreds of the regiment, as I had much severe trouble after I was joined to her. She had no children, save one daughter that was left at home with her grandfather, whom I may have occasion to speak of afterwards. I was in a very poor state of health when married to her; for the complaint I caught in the frigate had never left me, and I really had at that time more need of a doctor than a wife; but I knew her to be an excellent woman, and as she had no objections to me as a husband, I could have none against her as a wife; but happily for me I found in her both a doctor and a wife, and I daily recovered and enjoyed "]]]
