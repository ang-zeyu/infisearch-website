She stood still a second--so still that it seemed as if she was not drawing mortal breath.  Her astonishing, expectant eyes closed themselves, and yet in closing spoke expectancy still.  \"Speak, Lord,\" she said softly, but as if she spoke to Something whose nearness to her was such that her hand might have touched it.  \"Speak, Lord, thy servant 'eareth.\"  Antony Dart almost felt his hair rise.  He quaked as she came near, her poor clothes brushing against him.  He drew back to let her pass first, and followed her leading.  The court was filled with men, women, and children, who surged about the doorway, talking, crying, and protesting against each other's crowding. Dart caught a glimpse of a policeman fighting his way through with a doctor.  A dishevelled woman with a child at her dirty, bare breast had got in and was talking loudly.  \"Just outside the court it was,\" she proclaimed, \"an' I saw it.  If she'd bin 'erself it couldn't 'ave 'appened.  'No time for 'osspitles,' ses I.  She's not twenty breaths to dror; let 'er die in 'er own bed, pore thing!\"  And both she and her baby breaking into wails at one and the same time, other women, some hysteric, some maudlin with gin, joined them in a terrified outburst.  \"Get out, you women,\" commanded the doctor, who had forced his way across the threshold.  \"Send them away, officer,\" to the policeman.  There were others to turn out of the room itself, which was crowded with morbid or terrified creatures, all making for confusion.  Glad had seized the child and was forcing her way out into such air as there was outside.  The bed--a strange and loathly thing--stood by the empty, rusty fireplace.  Drunken Bet lay on it, a bundle of clothing over which the doctor bent for but a few minutes before he turned away.  Antony Dart, standing near the door, heard Miss Montaubyn speak to him in a whisper.  \"May I go to 'er?\" and the doctor nodded.  She limped lightly forward and her small face was white, but expectant still.  What could she expect now--O Lord, what?  An extraordinary thing happened. An abnormal silence fell.  The owners of such faces as on stretched necks caught sight of her seemed in a flash to communicate with others in the crowd.  \"Jinny Montaubyn!\" someone whispered.  And \"Jinny Montaubyn\" was passed along, leaving an awed stirring in its wake.  Those whom the pressure outside had crushed against the wall near the window in a passionate hurry, breathed on and rubbed the panes that they might lay their faces to them.  One tore out the rags stuffed in a broken place and listened breathlessly.  Jinny Montaubyn was kneeling down and laying her small old hand on the muddied forehead.  She held it there a second or so and spoke in a voice whose low clearness brought back at once to Dart the voice in which she had spoken to the Something upstairs.  \"Bet,\" she said, \"Bet.\"  And then more soft still and yet more clear, \"Bet, my dear.\"  It seemed incredible, but it was a fact.  Slowly the lids of the woman's eyes lifted and the pupils fixed themselves on Jinny Montaubyn, who leaned still closer and spoke again.  \"'T ain't true,\" she said.  \"Not this.  'T ain't TRUE.  There IS NO DEATH,\" slow and soft, but passionately distinct.  \"THERE--IS--NO-- DEATH.\"  The muscles of the woman's face twisted it into a rueful smile.  The three words she dragged out were so faint that perhaps none but Dart's strained ears heard them.  \"Wot--price--ME?\"  The soul of her was loosening fast and straining away, but Jinny Montaubyn followed it.  \"THERE--IS--NO--DEATH,\" and her low voice had the tone of a slender silver trumpet.  \"In a minit yer 'll know--in a minit.  Lord,\" lifting her expectant face, \"show her the wye.\"  Mysteriously the clouds were clearing from the sodden face--mysteriously. Miss Montaubyn watched them as they were swept away!  A minute--two minutes--and they were gone.  Then she rose noiselessly and stood looking down, speaking quite simply as if to herself.  \"Ah,\" she breathed, \"she DOES know now--fer sure an' certain.\"  Then Antony Dart, turning slightly, realized that a man who had entered the house and been standing near him, breathing with light quickness, since the moment Miss Montaubyn had knelt, was plainly the person Glad had called the \"curick,\" and that he had bowed his head and covered his eyes with a hand which trembled.  IV  He was a young man with an eager soul, and his work in Apple Blossom Court and places like it had torn him many ways.  Religious conventions established through centuries of custom had not prepared him for life among the submerged. He had struggled and been appalled, he had wrestled in prayer and felt himself unanswered, and in repentance of the feeling had scourged himself with thorns.  Miss Montaubyn, returning from the hospital, had filled him at first with horror and protest.  \"But who knows--who knows?\" he said to Dart, as they stood and talked together afterward, \"Faith as a little child.  That is literally hers. And I was shocked by it--and tried to destroy it, until I suddenly saw what I was doing.  I was--in my cloddish egotism--trying to show her that she was irreverent BECAUSE she could believe what in my soul I do not, though I dare not admit so much even to myself.  She took from some strange passing visitor to her tortured bedside what was to her a revelation.  She heard it first as a child hears a story of magic.  When she came out of the hospital, she told it as if it was one.  I--I--\" he bit his lips and moistened them, \"argued with her and reproached her. Christ the Merciful, forgive me!  She sat in her squalid little room with her magic--sometimes in the dark--sometimes without fire, and she clung to it, and loved it and asked it to help her, as a child asks its father for bread.  When she was answered--and God forgive me again for doubting that the simple good that came to her WAS an answer--when any small help came to her, she was a radiant thing, and without a shadow of doubt in her eyes told me of it as proof--proof that she had been heard. When things went wrong for a day and the fire was out again and the room dark, she said, 'I 'aven't kept near enough--I 'aven't trusted TRUE.  It will be gave me soon,' and when once at such a time I said to her, 'We must learn to say, Thy will be done,' she smiled up at me like a happy baby and answered:  \"'Thy will be done on earth AS IT IS IN 'EAVEN.  Lor', there's no cold there, nor no 'unger nor no cryin' nor pain. That's the way the will is done in 'eaven.  That's wot I arst for all day long--for it to be done on earth as it is in 'eaven.'  What could I say?  Could I tell her that the will of the Deity on the earth he created was only the will to do evil--to give pain--to crush the creature made in His own image.  What else do we mean when we say under all horror and agony that befalls, 'It is God's will--God's will be done.' Base unbeliever though I am, I could not speak the words.  Oh, she has something we have not.  Her poor, little misspent life has changed itself into a shining thing, though it shines and glows only in this hideous place. She herself does not know of its shining.  But Drunken Bet would stagger up to her room and ask to be told what she called her 'pantermine' stories.  I have seen her there sitting listening--listening with strange quiet on her and dull yearning in her sodden eyes.  So would other and worse women go to her, and I, who had struggled with them, could see that she had reached some remote longing in their beings which I had never touched.  In time the seed would have stirred to life--it is beginning to stir even now.  During the months since she came back to the court--though they have laughed at her--both men and women have begun to see her as a creature weirdly set apart.  Most of them feel something like awe of her; they half believe her prayers to be bewitchments, but they want them on their side. They have never wanted mine.  That I have known--KNOWN.  She believes that her Deity is in Apple Blossom Court--in the dire holes its people live in, on the broken stairway, in every nook and awful cranny of it--a great Glory we will not see--only waiting to be called and to answer. Do _I_ believe it--do you--do any of those anointed of us who preach each day so glibly 'God is EVERYWHERE'? Who is the one who believes?  If there were such a man he would go about as Moses did when 'He wist not that his face shone.'\"  They had gone out together and were standing in the fog in the court. The curate removed his hat and passed his handkerchief over his damp forehead, his breath coming and going almost sobbingly, his eyes staring straight before him into the yellowness of the haze.  \"Who,\" he said after a moment of singular silence, \"who are you?\"  Antony Dart hesitated a few seconds, and at the end of his pause he put his hand into his overcoat pocket.  \"If you will come upstairs with me to the room where the girl Glad lives, I will tell you,\" he said, \"but before we go I want to hand something over to you.\"  The curate turned an amazed gaze upon him.  \"What is it?\" he asked.  Dart withdrew his hand from his pocket, and the pistol was in it.  \"I came out this morning to buy this,\" he said.  \"I intended--never mind what I intended.  A wrong turn taken in the fog brought me here.  Take this thing from me and keep it.\"  The curate took the pistol and put it into his own pocket without comment. In the course of his labors he had seen desperate men and desperate things many times.  He had even been--at moments--a desperate man thinking desperate things himself, though no human being had ever suspected the fact.  This man had faced some tragedy, he could see. Had he been on the verge of a crime--had he looked murder in the eyes? What had made him pause?  Was it possible that the dream of Jinny Montaubyn being in the air had reached his brain--his being?  He looked almost appealingly at him, but he only said aloud:  \"Let "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4602"],["title","\"The Kingdom of God Is Within You\" (#0)"],["body","[For those interested, there is a note at the end of this document that details the adaptations made to this work]        \"THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS WITHIN YOU\" CHRISTIANITY NOT AS A MYSTIC RELIGION BUT AS A NEW THEORY OF LIFE  TRANSLATED FROM THE RUSSIAN OF COUNT LEO TOLSTOI BY CONSTANCE GARNETT New York, 1894    TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.  The book I have had the privilege of translating is, undoubtedly, one of the most remarkable studies of the social and psychological condition of the modern world which has appeared in Europe for many years, and its influence is sure to be lasting and far reaching.  Tolstoi's genius is beyond dispute.  The verdict of the civilized world has pronounced him as perhaps the greatest novelist of our generation.  But the philosophical and religious works of his later years have met with a somewhat indifferent reception.  They have been much talked about, simply because they were his work, but, as Tolstoi himself complains, they have never been seriously discussed.  I hardly think that he will have to repeat the complaint in regard to the present volume.  One may disagree with his views, but no one can seriously deny the originality, boldness, and depth of the social conception which he develops with such powerful logic.  The novelist has shown in this book the religious fervor and spiritual insight of the prophet; yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is not wholly lost in the thinker.  The subtle intuitive perception of the psychological basis of the social position, the analysis of the frame of mind of oppressors and oppressed, and of the intoxication of Authority and Servility, as well as the purely descriptive passages in the last chapter--these could only have come from the author of \"War and Peace.\"  The book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of, and must call forth much criticism.  It must be refuted by those who disapprove of its teaching, if they do not want it to have great influence.  One cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they are to be influenced by ideas, and instinctively distrustful of all that is logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt to put Tolstoi's theory of life into practice.  But one may at least be sure that his destructive criticism of the present social and political RÉGIME will become a powerful force in the work of disintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around us.  Many earnest thinkers who, like Tolstoi, are struggling to find their way out of the contradictions of our social order will hail him as their spiritual guide.  The individuality of the author is felt in every line of his work, and even the most prejudiced cannot resist the fascination of his genuineness, sincerity, and profound earnestness.  Whatever comes from a heart such as his, swelling with anger and pity at the sufferings of humanity, cannot fail to reach the hearts of others.  No reader can put down the book without feeling himself better and more truth-loving for having read it.  Many readers may be disappointed with the opening chapters of the book.  Tolstoi disdains all attempt to captivate the reader.  He begins by laying what he considers to be the logical foundation of his doctrines, stringing together quotations from little-known theological writers, and he keeps his own incisive logic for the later part of the book.  One word as to the translation.  Tolstoi's style in his religious and philosophical works differs considerably from that of his novels.  He no longer cares about the form of his work, and his style is often slipshod, involved, and diffuse.  It has been my aim to give a faithful reproduction of the original.  CONSTANCE GARNETT. January, 1894     PREFACE.  In the year 1884 I wrote a book under the title \"What I Believe,\" in which I did in fact make a sincere statement of my beliefs.  In affirming my belief in Christ's teaching, I could not help explaining why I do not believe, and consider as mistaken, the Church's doctrine, which is usually called Christianity.  Among the many points in which this doctrine falls short of the doctrine of Christ I pointed out as the principal one the absence of any commandment of non-resistance to evil by force.  The perversion of Christ's teaching by the teaching of the Church is more clearly apparent in this than in any other point of difference.  I know--as we all do--very little of the practice and the spoken and written doctrine of former times on the subject of non-resistance to evil. I knew what had been said on the subject by the fathers of the Church--Origen, Tertullian, and others--I knew too of the existence of some so-called sects of Mennonites, Herrnhuters, and Quakers, who do not allow a Christian the use of weapons, and do not enter military service; but I knew little of what had been done by these so-called sects toward expounding the question.  My book was, as I had anticipated, suppressed by the Russian censorship; but partly owing to my literary reputation, partly because the book had excited people's curiosity, it circulated in manuscript and in lithographed copies in Russia and through translations abroad, and it evolved, on one side, from those who shared my convictions, a series of essays with a great deal of information on the subject, on the other side a series of criticisms on the principles laid down in my book.  A great deal was made clear to me by both hostile and sympathetic criticism, and also by the historical events of late years; and I was led to fresh results and conclusions, which I wish now to expound.  First I will speak of the information I received on the history of the question of non-resistance to evil; then of the views of this question maintained by spiritual critics, that is, by professed believers in the Christian religion, and also by temporal ones, that is, those who do not profess the Christian religion; and lastly I will speak of the conclusions to which I have been brought by all this in the light of the historical events of late years.

THE DOCTRINE OF NON-RESISTANCE TO EVIL BY FORCE HAS BEEN PROFESSED BY A MINORITY OF MEN FROM THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CHRISTIANITY.  Of the Book \"What I Believe\"--The Correspondence Evoked by it--Letters from Quakers--Garrison's Declaration--Adin Ballou, his Works, his Catechism--Helchitsky's \"Net of Faith\"--The Attitude of the World to Works Elucidating Christ's Teaching--Dymond's Book \"On War\"--Musser's \"Non-resistance Asserted\"--Attitude of the Government in 1818 to Men who Refused to Serve in the Army--Hostile Attitude of Governments Generally and of Liberals to Those who Refuse to Assist in Acts of State Violence, and their Conscious Efforts to Silence and Suppress these Manifestations of Christian Non-resistance.   Among the first responses called forth by my book were some letters from American Quakers. In these letters, expressing their sympathy with my views on the unlawfulness for a Christian of war and the use of force of any kind, the Quakers gave me details of their own so-called sect, which for more than two hundred years has actually professed the teaching of Christ on non-resistance to evil by force, and does not make use of weapons in self-defense. The Quakers sent me books, from which I learnt how they had, years ago, established beyond doubt the duty for a Christian of fulfilling the command of non-resistance to evil by force, and had exposed the error of the Church's teaching in allowing war and capital punishment.  In a whole series of arguments and texts showing that war--that is, the wounding and killing of men--is inconsistent with a religion founded on peace and good will toward men, the Quakers maintain and prove that nothing has contributed so much to the obscuring of Christian truth in the eyes of the heathen, and has hindered so much the diffusion of Christianity through the world, as the disregard of this command by men calling themselves Christians, and the permission of war and violence to Christians.  \"Christ's teaching, which came to be known to men, not by means of violence and the sword,\" they say, \"but by means of non-resistance to evil, gentleness, meekness, and"]]]
