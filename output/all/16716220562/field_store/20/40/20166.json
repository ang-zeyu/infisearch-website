I receive your denial, my children. In addition, I merely desire to satisfy curiosity.  Did the guard clear a way for you?'  The answer was affirmative.  'Your swords!'  One of them drew, and proffered the handle.  The other clasped the haft angrily, and with a resolute smack on it, settled it in the scabbard.  'Am I a prisoner, General?'  'Not at all!'  'Then I decline to surrender my sword.'  Another General officer happened to be sauntering by.  Applauding with his hands, and choosing the Italian language as the best form of speech for the enunciation of ironical superlatives, he said:  'Eccellentemente! most admirable! of a distinguished loftiness of moral grandeur: \"Then I decline,\" etc.: you are aware that you are quoting? \"as the drummerboy said to Napoleon.\"  I think you forgot to add that? It is the same young soldier who utters these immense things, which we can hardly get out of our mouths.  So the little fellow towers!  His moral greatness is as noisy as his drum.  What's wrong?'  'General Pierson, nothing's wrong,' was replied by several voices; and some explained that Lieutenant Jenna had been called upon by General Schoneck to show his sword, and had refused.  The heroic defender of his sword shouted to the officer with whom General Pierson had been conversing: 'Here!  Weisspriess!'  'What is it, my dear fellow?  Speak, my good Jenna!'  The explanation was given, and full sympathy elicited from Captain Weisspriess, while the two Generals likewise whispered and nodded.  'Did you draw?' the captain inquired, yawning.  'You needn't say it in quite so many words, if you did.  I shall be asked by the General presently; and owing to that duel pending 'twixt you and his nephew, of which he is aware, he may put a bad interpretation on your pepperiness.'  'The devil fetch his nephew!' returned the furious Lieutenant Jenna. 'He comes back to-night from Milan, and if he doesn't fight me to-morrow, I post him a coward.  Well, about that business!  My good Weisspriess, the fellows had got into a thick crowd all round, and had begun to knead me.  Do you understand me?  I felt their knuckles.'  'Ah, good, good!' said the captain.  'Then, you didn't draw, of course. What officer of the Imperial service would, under similar circumstances! That is my reply to the Emperor, if ever I am questioned.  To draw would be to show that an Austrian officer relies on his good sword in the thick of his enemies; against which, as you know, my Jenna, the Government have issued an express injunction button.  Did you sell it dear?'  'A fellow parted with his ear for it.'  Lieutenant Jenna illustrated a particular cut from a turn of his wrist.  'That oughtn't to make a noise?' he queried somewhat anxiously.  'It won't hear one any longer, at all events,' said Captain Weisspriess; and the two officers entered into the significance of the remark with enjoyment.  Meantime General Pierson had concluded an apparently humorous dialogue with his brother General, and the later, now addressing Lieutenant Jenna, said: 'Since you prefer surrendering your person rather than your sword-- it is good!  Report yourself at the door of my room to-night, at ten.  I suspect that you have been blazing your steel, sir.  They say, 'tis as ready to flash out as your temper.'  Several voices interposed: 'General!  what if he did draw!'  'Silence.  You have read the recent order.  Orlando may have his Durindarda bare; but you may not.  Grasp that fact.  The Government wish to make Christians of you, my children.  One cheek being smitten, what should you do?'  'Shall I show you, General?' cried a quick little subaltern.  'The order, my children, as received a fortnight since from our old Wien, commands you to offer the other cheek to the smiter.'  'So that a proper balance may be restored to both sides of the face,' General Pierson appended.  'And mark me,' he resumed.  'There may be doubts about the policy of anything, though I shouldn't counsel you to cherish them: but there's no mortal doubt about the punishment for this thing.' The General spoke sternly; and then relaxing the severity of his tone, he said, 'The desire of the Government is to make an army of Christians.'  'And a precious way of doing it!' interjected two or three of the younger officers.  They perfectly understood how hateful the Viennese domination was to their chiefs, and that they would meet sympathy and tolerance for any extreme of irony, provided that they showed a disposition to be subordinate.  For the bureaucratic order, whatever it was, had to be obeyed.  The army might, and of course did, know best: nevertheless it was bound to be nothing better than a machine in the hands of the dull closeted men in Vienna, who judged of difficulties and plans of action from a calculation of numbers, or from foreign journals--from heaven knows what!  General Schoneck and General Pierson walked away laughing, and the younger officers were left to themselves.  Half-a-dozen of them interlaced arms, striding up toward the Porta Nuova, near which, at the corner of the Via Trinita, they had the pleasant excitement of beholding a riderless horse suddenly in mid gallop sink on its knees and roll over. A crowd came pouring after it, and from the midst the voice of a comrade hailed them.  'It's Pierson,' cried Lieutenant Jenna.  The officers drew their swords, and hailed the guard from the gates.  Lieutenant Pierson dropped in among their shoulders, dead from want of breath.  They held him up, and finding him sound, thumped his back.  The blade of his sword was red.  He coughed with their thumpings, and sang out to them to cease; the idle mob which had been at his heels drew back before the guard could come up with them.  Lieutenant Pierson gave no explanation except that he had been attacked near Juliet's tomb on his way to General Schoneck's quarters.  Fellows had stabbed his horse, and brought him to the ground, and torn the coat off his back.  He complained in bitter mutterings of the loss of a letter therein, during the first candid moments of his anger: and, as he was known to be engaged to the Countess Lena von Lenkenstein, it was conjectured by his comrades that this lady might have had something to do with the ravishment of the letter.  Great laughter surrounded him, and he looked from man to man.  Allowance is naturally made for the irascibility of a brother officer coming tattered out of the hands of enemies, or Lieutenant Jenna would have construed his eye's challenge on the spot.  As it was, he cried out, 'The letter! the letter! Charge, for the honour of the army, and rescue the letter!' Others echoed him: 'The letter! the letter! the English letter!' A foreigner in an army can have as much provocation as he pleases; if he is anything of a favourite with his superiors, his fellows will task his forbearance. Wilfrid Pierson glanced at the blade of his sword, and slowly sheathed it.  'Lieutenant Jenna is a good actor before a mob,' he said. 'Gentlemen, I rely upon you to make no noise about that letter; it is a private matter.  In an hour or so, if any officer shall choose to question me concerning it, I will answer him.'  The last remnants of the mob had withdrawn.  The officer in command at the gates threw a cloak over Wilfrid's shoulders; and taking the arm of a friend Wilfrid hurried to barracks, and was quickly in a position to report himself to his General, whose first remark, 'Has the dead horse been removed?' robbed him of his usual readiness to equivocate.  'When you are the bearer of a verbal despatch, come straight to quarters, if you have to come like a fig-tree on the north side of the wall in Winter,' said General Schoneck, who was joined presently by General Pierson.  'What 's this I hear of some letter you have been barking about all over the city?' the latter asked, after returning his nephew's on-duty salute.  Wilfrid replied that it was a letter of his sister's treating of family matters.  The two Generals, who were close friends, discussed the attack to which he had been subjected.  Wilfrid had to recount it with circumstance: how, as he was nearing General Schoneck's quarters at a military trot, six men headed by a leader had dashed out on him from a narrow side-street, unhorsed him after a struggle, rifled the saddlebags, and torn the coat from his back, and had taken the mark of his sword, while a gathering crowd looked on, hooting.  His horse had fled, and he confessed that he had followed his horse.  General Schoneck spoke the name of Countess Lena suggestively.  'Not a bit,' returned General Pierson; 'the fellow courts her too hotly.  The scoundrels here want a bombardment; that 's where it lies.  A dose of iron pills will make Verona a healthy place.  She must have it.'  General Schoneck said, 'I hope not,' and laughed at the heat of Irish blood.  He led Wilfrid in to the Marshal, after which Wilfrid was free to seek Lieutenant Jenna, who had gained the right to a similar freedom by pledging his honour not to fight within a stipulated term of days.  The next morning Wilfrid was roused by an orderly coming from his uncle, who placed in his hands a copy of Vittoria's letter: at the end of it his uncle had written, 'Rather astonishing.  Done pretty well; but by a foreigner.  \"Affection\" spelt with one \"f.\"  An Italian: you will see the letters are emphatic at \"ugly flag\"; also \"bloody and past forgiveness\" very large; the copyist had a dash of the feelings of a commentator, and did his (or her) best to add an oath to it.  Who the deuce, sir, is this opera girl calling herself Vittoria?  I have a lecture for you.  German women don't forgive diversions during courtship; and if you let this Countess Lena slip, your chance has gone.  I compliment you on your power of lying; but you must learn to show your right face to me, or the very handsome feature, your nose, and that useful box, your skull,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4436"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 2 (#3)"],["body","come to grief.  The whole business is a mystery.  The letter (copy) was directed to you, brought to me, and opened in a fit of abstraction, necessary to commanding uncles who are trying to push the fortunes of young noodles pretending to be related to them.  Go to Countess Lena. Count Paul is with her, from Bologna.  Speak to her, and observe her and him.  He knows English--has been attached to the embassy in London; but, pooh!  the hand's Italian.  I confess myself puzzled.  We shall possibly have to act on the intimation of the fifteenth, and profess to be wiser than others.  Something is brewing for business.  See Countess Lena boldly, and then come and breakfast with me.'  Wilfrid read the miserable copy of Vittoria's letter, utterly unable to resolve anything in his mind, except that he would know among a thousand the leader of those men who had attacked him, and who bore the mark of his sword.     CHAPTER X  THE POPE'S MOUTH  Barto Rizzo had done what he had sworn to do.  He had not found it difficult to outstrip the lieutenant (who had to visit Brescia on his way) and reach the gates of Verona in advance of him, where he obtained entrance among a body of grape-gatherers and others descending from the hills to meet a press of labour in the autumnal plains.  With them he hoped to issue forth unchallenged on the following morning; but Wilfrid's sword had made lusty play; and, as in the case when the order has been given that a man shall be spared in life and limb, Barto and his fellow- assailants suffered by their effort to hold him simply half a minute powerless.  He received a shrewd cut across the head, and lay for a couple of hours senseless in the wine-shop of one Battista--one of the many all over Lombardy who had pledged their allegiance to the Great Cat, thinking him scarcely vulnerable.  He read the letter, dizzy with pain, and with the frankness proper to inflated spirits after loss of blood, he owned to himself that it was not worth much as a prize.  It was worth the attempt to get possession of it, for anything is worth what it costs, if it be only as a schooling in resolution, energy, and devotedness:-- regrets are the sole admission of a fruitless business; they show the bad tree;--so, according to his principle of action, he deliberated; but he was compelled to admit that Vittoria's letter was little else than a repetition of her want of discretion when she was on the Motterone.  He admitted it, wrathfully: his efforts to convict this woman telling him she deserved some punishment; and his suspicions being unsatisfied, he resolved to keep them hungry upon her, and return to Milan at once.  As to the letter itself, he purposed, since the harm in it was accomplished, to send it back honourably to the lieutenant, till finding it blood- stained, he declined to furnish the gratification of such a sight to any Austrian sword.  For that reason, he copied it, while Battista's wife held double bandages tight round his head: believing that the letter stood transcribed in a precisely similar hand, he forwarded it to Lieutenant Pierson, and then sank and swooned.  Two days he lay incapable and let his thoughts dance as they would.  Information was brought to him that the gates were strictly watched, and that troops were starting for Milan.  This was in the dull hour antecedent to the dawn.  'She is a traitress!' he exclaimed, and leaping from his bed, as with a brain striking fire, screamed, 'Traitress!  traitress!' Battista and his wife had to fling themselves on him and gag him, guessing him as mad.  He spoke pompously and theatrically; called himself the Eye of Italy, and said that he must be in Milan, or Milan would perish, because of the traitress: all with a great sullen air of composure and an odd distension of the eyelids.  When they released him, he smiled and thanked them, though they knew, that had he chosen, he could have thrown off a dozen of them, such was his strength.  The woman went down on her knees to him to get his consent that she should dress and bandage his head afresh.  The sound of the regimental bugles drew him from the house, rather than any immediate settled scheme to watch at the gates.  Artillery and infantry were in motion before sunrise, from various points of the city, bearing toward the Palio and Zeno gates, and the people turned out to see them, for it was a march that looked like the beginning of things.  The soldiers had green twigs in their hats, and kissed their hands good-humouredly to the gazing crowd, shouting bits of verses:  'I'm off!  I'm off!  Farewell, Mariandl!  if I come back a sergeant-major or a Field-Marshal, don't turn up your nose at me: Swear you will be faithful all the while; because, when a woman swears, it's a comfort, somehow: Farewell!  Squeeze the cow's udders: I shall be thirsty enough: You pretty wriggler! don't you know, the first cup of wine and the last, I shall float your name on it?  Luck to the lads we leave behind! Farewell, Mariandl!'  The kindly fellows waved their hands and would take no rebuff.  The soldiery of Austria are kindlier than most, until their blood is up. A Tyrolese regiment passed, singing splendidly in chorus.  Songs of sentiment prevailed, but the traditions of a soldier's experience of the sex have informed his ballads with strange touches of irony, that help him to his (so to say) philosophy, which is recklessness.  The Tyroler's 'Katchen' here, was a saturnine Giulia, who gave him no response, either of eye or lip.  'Little mother, little sister, little sweetheart, 'ade! ade!'  My little sweetheart, your meadow is half-way up the mountain; it's such a green spot on the eyeballs of a roving boy! and the chapel just above it, I shall see it as I've seen it a thousand times; and the cloud hangs near it, and moves to the door and enters, for it is an angel, not a cloud; a white angel gone in to pray for Katerlein and me: Little mother, little sister, little sweetheart, 'ade! ade!'  Keep single, Katerlein, as long as you can: as long as you can hold out, keep single: 'ade!''  Fifteen hundred men and six guns were counted as they marched on to one gate.  Barto Rizzo, with Battista and his wife on each side of him, were among the spectators.  The black cock's feathers of the Tyrolese were still fluttering up the Corso, when the woman said, 'I 've known the tail of a regiment get through the gates without having to show paper.'  Battista thereupon asked Barto whether he would try that chance.  The answer was a vacuous shake of the head, accompanied by an expression of unutterable mournfulness.  'There's no other way,' pursued Battista, 'unless you jump into the Adige, and swim down half-a-mile under water; and cats hate water--eh, my comico?'  He conceived that the sword-cut had rendered Barto imbecile, and pulled his hat down his forehead, and patted his shoulder, and bade him have cheer, patronizingly: but women do not so lightly lose their impression of a notable man.  His wife checked him.  Barto had shut his eyes, and hung swaying between them, as in drowsiness or drunkenness.  Like his body, his faith was swaying within him.  He felt it borne upon the reeling brain, and clung to it desperately, calling upon chance to aid him; for he was weak, incapable of a physical or mental contest, and this part of his settled creed that human beings alone failed the patriotic cause as instruments, while circumstances constantly befriended it--was shocked by present events.  The image of Vittoria, the traitress, floated over the soldiery marching on Milan through her treachery.  Never had an Austrian force seemed to him so terrible.  He had to yield the internal fight, and let his faith sink and be blackened, in order that his mind might rest supine, according to his remembered system; for the inspiration which points to the right course does not come during mental strife, but after it, when faith summons its agencies undisturbed--if only men will have the faith, and will teach themselves to know that the inspiration must come, and will counsel them justly.  This was a part of Barto Rizzo's sustaining creed; nor did he lose his grasp of it in the torment and the darkness of his condition.  He heard English voices.  A carriage had stopped almost in front of him. A General officer was hat in hand, talking to a lady, who called him uncle, and said that she had been obliged to decide to quit Verona on account of her husband, to whom the excessive heat was unendurable.  Her husband, in the same breath, protested that the heat killed him.  He adorned the statement with all kinds of domestic and subterranean imagery, and laughed faintly, saying that after the fifteenth--on which night his wife insisted upon going to the Opera at Milan to hear a new singer and old friend--he should try a week at the Baths of Bormio, and only drop from the mountains when a proper temperature reigned, he being something of an invalid.  'And, uncle, will you be in Milan on the fifteenth?' said the lady; 'and Wilfrid, too?'  'Wilfrid will reach Milan as soon as you do, and I shall undoubtedly be there on the fifteenth,' said the General.  'I cannot possibly express to you how beautiful I think your army looks,' said the lady.  'Fine men, General Pierson, very fine men.  I never saw such marching-- equal to our Guards,' her husband remarked.  The lady named her Milanese hotel as the General waved his plumes, nodded, and rode off.  Before the carriage had started, Barto Rizzo dashed up to it; and 'Dear good English lady,' he addressed her, 'I am the brother of Luigi, who carries letters for you in Milan--little Luigi!--and I have a mother dying in Milan; and here I am in Verona, ill, and can't get to her, poor soul!  Will you allow me that I may sit up behind as quiet as a mouse, and be near one of the lovely English ladies who are so kind to unfortunate persons, and never deaf to the name of charity?  It's my mother who is dying, poor soul!'  The lady"]]]
