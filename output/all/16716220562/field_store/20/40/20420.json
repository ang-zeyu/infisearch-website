SOLOMON MACK, THE FATHER OF LUCY MACK--EXTRACT FROM HIS NARRATIVE.  My father, Solomon Mack, was born in the town of Lyme, New London county, State of Connecticut, September 26, 1735. His father, Ebenezer Mack, was a man of considerable property, and lived in good style, commanding all the attention and respect which are ever shown to those who live in fine circumstances, and habits of strict morality. For a length of time he fully enjoyed the fruits of his industry. But this state of things did not always continue for a series of misfortunes visited my grand-parents, by which they were reduced to that extremity, that a once happy and flourishing family were compelled to disperse, and throw themselves upon the charity of a cold, unfeeling world.  My father was taken into the family of a neighboring farmer, where he remained until he was nearly twenty-one years of age, about which time he enlisted in the service of his country.  I have a sketch of my father's life, written by himself, in which is detailed an account of his several campaigns, and many of his adventures, while in the army. From this, I extract the following:      At the age of twenty-one years, I left my master. Shortly after     which, I enlisted in the services of my country, under the command     of Captain Henry, and was annexed to the regiment commanded by Col.     Whiting.      From Connecticut, we marched to Fort Edwards, in the state of New     York. We were in a severe battle, fought at Half-way Brook in 1855     [should likely read 1775--Transcriber]. During this expedition, I     caught a heavy cold, which rendered me unfit for business until the     return of warm weather. I was carried the ensuing spring to Albany.      In the year 1757, I had two teams in the King's service, which was     employed in carrying the general's baggage. While thus engaged,     I went one morning to yoke my team, but three of my oxen were     missing. When this knowledge came to the officer, he was very     angry, and drawing his sword, threatened to run it through me. He     then ordered me to get three other oxen, which I accordingly did,     and proceeded with the baggage to Fort Edwards, and the next day I     returned in order to find my missing oxen.      While I was performing this trip, the following circumstance     occurred. About half way from Stillwater to Fort Edwards, I espied     four Indians nearly thirty rods distant, coming out of the woods;     they were armed with scalping knives, tomahawks and guns. I was     alone, but about twenty rods behind me was a man by the name of     Webster. I saw my danger, and that there was no way to escape,     unless I could do it by stratagem; so I rushed upon them, calling     in the mean time at the top of my voice, Rush on! rush on my boys!     we'll have the devils. The only weapon I had, was a walking staff,     yet I ran toward them, and as the other man appeared just at that     instant, it gave them a terrible fright, and I saw no more of them.      I hastened to Stillwater the next day, as aforementioned, and     finding my oxen soon after I arrived there, I returned the same     night to Fort Edwards, a distance of seven miles, the whole of     which was a dense forest.      In 1758, I enlisted under Major Spenser, and went immediately over     Lake George, with a company who crossed in boats, to the western     side, where we had a bloody and hot engagement with the enemy, in     which Lord Howe fell at the onset of the battle. His bowels were     taken out and buried, but his body was embalmed, and carried to     England.      The next day we marched to the breastworks, but were unsuccessful,     being compelled to retreat with a loss of five hundred men killed,     and as many more wounded.      In this contest I narrowly escaped--a musket ball passed under     my chin, within half an inch of my neck. The army then returned     to Lake George, and, on its way thither, a large scouting party     of the enemy came round by Skeenesborough, and, at Half-way     Brook, destroyed a large number of both men and teams. Upon this,     one thousand of our men were detached to repair immediately to     Skeenesborough in pursuit of them; but when we arrived at South     Bay, the enemy were entirely out of our reach.      The enemy then marched to Ticonderoga, New York, in order to     procure supplies, after which they immediately pursued us, but we     eluded them by hastening to Woodcreek, and thence to Fort Ann,     where we arrived on the 13th day of the month. We had just reached     this place, when the sentry gave information that the enemy was all     around us, in consequence of which we were suddenly called to arms.     Major Putman led the company, and Major Rogers brought up the rear.     We marched but three-quarters of a mile, when we came suddenly     upon a company of Indians that were lying in ambush. Major Putman     marched his men through their ranks, whereupon the Indians fired,     which threw our men into some confusion. Major Putnam was captured     by them, and would have been killed by an Indian, had he not been     rescued by a French lieutenant.      The enemy rose like a cloud, and fired a whole volley upon us, and     as I was in the foremost rank, the retreat of my company brought me     in the rear, and the tomahawks and bullets flew around me like hail     stones. As I was running, I saw not far before me a windfall, which     was so high that it appeared to me insurmountable, however, by     making great exertions, I succeeded in getting over it. Running a     little farther, I observed a man who had in this last conflict been     badly wounded, and the Indians were close upon him; nevertheless     I turned aside for the purpose of assisting him, and succeeded in     getting him into the midst of our army, in safety.      In this encounter, a man named Gersham Bowley, had nine bullets     shot through his clothes but received no personal injury. Ensign     Worcester received nine wounds, was scalped and tomahawked,     notwithstanding which, he lived, and finally recovered.      The above engagement commenced early in the morning, and continued     until about three o'clock p. m., in which half of our men were     either killed, wounded or taken prisoners. In consequence of this     tremendous slaughter we were compelled to send to Fort Edwards for     men, in order to assist in carrying our wounded, which were about     eighty in number.      The distance we had to carry them, was nearly fourteen miles. To     carry so many thus far, was truly very fatiguing, insomuch that     when we arrived at the place of destination, my strength was about     exhausted.      I proceeded immediately to Albany, for the purpose of getting     supplies, and returned again to the army as soon as circumstances     would admit.      Autumn having now arrived I went home, where I tarried the ensuing     winter.      In the spring of 1759, the army marched to Crownpoint, where I     received my discharge. In the same year, I became acquainted with     an accomplished young woman, a school teacher, by the name of     Lydia Gates. She was the daughter of Nathan Gates, who was a man     of wealth, living in the town of East Haddam, Connecticut. To this     young woman I was married shortly after becoming acquainted with     her.      Having received a large amount of money for my services in the     army, and deeming it prudent to make an investment of the same in     real estate, I contracted for the whole town of Granville, in the     state of New York. On the execution of the deed, I paid all the     money that was required in the stipulation, which stipulation also     called for the building of a number of log houses. I accordingly     went to work to fulfill this part of the contract, but after     laboring a short time, I had the misfortune to cut my leg, which     subjected me, during that season, to the care of the physician. I     hired a man to do the work, and paid him in advance, in order to     fulfill my part of the contract; but he ran away with the money,     without performing the labor, and the consequence was, I lost the     land altogether.      In 1761, we moved to the town of Marlow, where we remained until     we had four children. When we moved there it was no other than a     desolate and dreary wilderness. Only four families resided within     forty miles. Here I was thrown into a situation to appreciate more     fully the talents and virtues of my excellent wife; for, as our     children were deprived of schools, she assumed the charge of their     education, and performed the duties of an instructress as none,     save a mother, is capable of. Precepts accompanied with examples     such as hers, were calculated to make impressions on the minds of     the young, never to be forgotten.      She, besides instructing them in the various branches of an     ordinary education, was in the habit of calling them together both     morning and evening, and teaching them to pray; meanwhile urging     upon them the necessity of love toward each other, as well as     devotional feelings towards Him who made them.      In this manner my first children became confirmed in habits of     piety, gentleness, and reflection, which afforded great assistance     in guiding those who came after them, into the same happy channel.     The education of my children would have been a more difficult     task, if they had not inherited much of their mother's excellent     disposition.      In 1776, I enlisted in the service of my country and was for a     considerable length of time in the land forces, after which I went     with my two sons, Jason and Stephen, on a privateering expedition,     commanded by Captain Havens. Soon after, we set sail we were driven     upon Horseneck. We succeeded, however, in getting some of our     guns on shore,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45619"],["title","History of the Prophet Joseph, (#2)"],["body","bringing them to bear upon the enemy, so as to     exchange many shots with them; yet they cut away our rigging, and     left our vessel much shattered.      We then hauled off and cast anchor; but, in a short time we espied     two row-gallies, two sloops, and two schooners. We quickly weighed     anchor, and hauled to shore again, and had barely time to post     four cannon in a position in which they could be used, before a     sanguinary, contest commenced. The balls from the enemy's guns tore     up the ground, cutting asunder the saplings in every direction.     One of the row-gallies went round a point of land with the view of     hemming us in, but we killed forty of their men, with our small     arms, which caused the enemy to abandon their purpose.      My son Stephen, in company with the cabin boys, was sent to a house     not far from the shore, with a wounded man. Just as they entered     the house, an eighteen-pounder followed them. A woman was engaged     in frying cakes, at the time, and being somewhat alarmed, she     concluded to retire into the cellar, saying, as she left, that the     boys might have the cakes, as she was going below.      The boys were highly delighted at this, and they went to work     cooking and feasting upon the lady's sweet cakes, while the     artillery of the contending armies was thundering in their ears,     dealing out death and destruction on every hand. At the head of     this party of boys, was Stephen Mack, my second son, a bold and     fearless stripling of fourteen.      In this contest the enemy was far superior to us in point of     numbers, yet we maintained our ground with such valor that they     thought it better to leave us, and accordingly did so. Soon after     this, we hoisted sail and made for New London.      When hostilities ceased and peace and tranquility were again     restored, we freighted a vessel for Liverpool. Selling both ship     and cargo in this place, we embarked on board Captain Foster's     vessel, which I afterwards purchased; but, in consequence of storms     and wrecks, I was compelled to sell her, and was left completely     destitute.      I struggled a little longer to obtain property, in making     adventures, then returned to my family, after an absence of four     years, about pennyless. After this I determined to follow phantoms     no longer, but devote the rest of my life to the service of God and     my family.  I shall now lay aside my father's journal, as I have made such extracts as are adapted to my purpose, and take up the history of his children.    CHAPTER II.  HISTORY OF JASON MACK.  Jason, my oldest brother, was a studious and manly boy. Before he had attained his sixteenth year, he became what was then called a Seeker, and believing that by prayer and faith the gifts of the gospel, which were enjoyed by the ancient disciples of Christ, might be attained, he labored almost incessantly to convert others to the same faith. He was also of the opinion that God would, at some subsequent period, manifest his power as he had anciently done--in signs and wonders.  At the age of twenty, he became a preacher of the gospel. And in a short time after this, he formed an acquaintance with a young woman of wealthy parentage.[A] She was the pride of the place in which she resided, not so much on account of her splendid appearance, as the soundness of her mind, and her stately deportment, joined with an unaffected mildness of disposition, and a condescension of manners, which were admirably suited to the taste and principles of my brother. Jason became deeply in love with her, insomuch that his heart was completely hers, and it would have been as easy to have convinced him that he could exist without his head, as that he could live and enjoy life, without being united with her in marriage. These feelings, I believe, were mutual, and Jason and she entered into an engagement to be married, but, as they were making arrangements for the solemnization of their nuptials, my father received a letter from Liverpool, containing information that a large amount of money was collected for him, and that it was ready for his reception.  [Footnote A: The name of this young woman was Esther Bruce; she was from the state of New Hampshire.]  On account of this intelligence, it was agreed that the marriage of my brother, as my father desired that he should accompany him to Liverpool, should be deferred until their return. Accordingly, my brother left his affianced bride, with a heavy heart, and with this promise, that he would write to her and his sister conjointly, at least once in three months during his absence. In three months after his departure, according to agreement, a letter arrived, which indeed met with a very warm reception, but it was never followed by another from him. A young man who kept the post office where she received her letters, formed in his heart a determination to thwart my brother, if possible, in his matrimonial prospects, in order to obtain the prize himself. He commenced by using the most persuasive arguments against her marrying my brother; but not succeeding in this, he next detained his letters, and then reproached him for neglecting her. Being still unsuccessful, he forged letters purporting to be from a friend of Jason, which stated that he (Jason Mack) was dead, and his friends might cease to expect him. He then urged his suit again, but she still rejected him, and continued to do so until within four months of Jason's return, when she concluded that she had wronged the young man, and that he was really more worthy than she had expected. The time also which Jason was to be absent having expired without his return, she believed that the reports concerning his death must be true. So she accepted the hand of this young man, and they were united in the bonds of matrimony.  As soon as Jason arrived, he repaired immediately to her father's house. When he arrived there, she was gone to her brother's funeral; he went in, and seated himself in the same room where he had once paid his addresses to her. In a short time, she came home; when she first saw him she did not know him, but when she got a full view of his countenance, she recognized him, and instantly fainted. From this time forward, she never recovered her health, but, lingering for two years, died the victim of disappointment.  Jason remained in the neighborhood a short time, and then went to sea, but he did not follow the sea a great while. He soon left the main, and commenced preaching again, which he continued until his death.    CHAPTER III.  LOVISA AND LOVINA MACK.  The history of Lovisa and Lovina, my two oldest sisters, is so connected and interwoven that I shall not attempt to separate it.  They were one in faith, in love, in action, and in hope of eternal life. They were always together, and when they were old enough to understand the duties of a Christian, they united their voices in prayer and songs of praise to God. This sisterly affection increased with their years, and strengthened with the strength of their minds. The pathway of their lives was never clouded with a gloomy shadow until Lovisa's marriage, and removal from home, which left Lovina very lonely.  In about two years after Lovisa's marriage, she was taken very sick, and sent for Lovina. Lovina, as might be expected, went immediately, and remained with her sister during her illness, which lasted two years, baffling the skill of the most experienced physicians; but at the expiration of this time she revived a little, and showed some symptoms of recovery.  I shall here relate a circumstance connected with her sickness, which may try the credulity of some of my readers, yet hundreds were eye witnesses, and doubtless many are now living, who, if they would, could testify to the fact which I am about to mention.  As before stated, after the space of two years she began to manifest signs of convalescence, but soon a violent re-attack brought her down again, and she grew worse and worse, until she became entirely speechless, and so reduced that her attendants were not allowed to even turn her in bed. She took no nourishment except a very little rice water. She lay in this situation three days and two nights. On the third night, about two o'clock, she feebly pronounced the name of Lovina, who had all the while watched over her pillow, like an attendant angel, observing every change and symptom with the deepest emotion. Startled at hearing the sound of Lovisa's voice, Lovina now bent over the emaciated form of her sister, with thrilling interest, and said, \"my sister! my sister! what will you?\"  Lovisa then said emphatically, \"the Lord has healed me, both soul and body--raise me up and give me my clothes, I wish to get up.\"  Her husband told those who were watching with her, to gratify her, as in all probability it was a revival before death, and he would not have her crossed in her last moments.  They did so, though with reluctance, as they supposed she might live a few moments longer, if she did not exhaust her strength too much by exerting herself in this manner.  Having raised her in bed, they assisted her to dress; and although, when they raised her to her feet, her weight dislocated both of her ankles, she would not consent to return to her bed, but insisted upon being set in a chair, and having her feet drawn gently in order to have her ankle joints replaced. She then requested her husband to bring her some wine, saying, if he would do so she would do quite well for the present.  Soon after this, by her own request, she was assisted to cross the street to her father-in-law's, who was at that time prostrated upon a bed of sickness. When she entered the house he cried out in amazement, \"Lovisa is dead, and her spirit is now come to warn me of my sudden departure from this world.\" \"No, father,\" she exclaimed, \"God has raised me up, and I have come to tell you to prepare for death.\" She"]]]
