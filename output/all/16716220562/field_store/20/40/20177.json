One shriek from her would bring them, like a torrent, on the boards, as the officers well knew; and every second's delay in executing the orders of the General added to the difficulty of their position.  The lieutenant of Croats strode up to Weisspriess and Wilfrid, who were discussing a plan of action vehemently; while, amid hubbub and argument, De Pyrmont studied Vittoria's features through his opera-glass, with an admirable simple languor.  Wilfrid turned back to him, and De Pyrmont, without altering the level of his glass, said, 'She's as cool as a lemon-ice.  That girl will be a mother of heroes.  To have volcanic fire and the mastery of her nerves at the same time, is something prodigious.  She is magnificent.  Take a peep at her.  I suspect that the rascal at her right is seizing his occasion to plant a trifle or so in her memory--the animal!  It's just the moment, and he knows it.'  De Pyrmont looked at Wilfrid's face.  'Have I hit you anywhere accidentally?' he asked, for the face had grown dead-white.  'Be my friend, for heaven's sake!' was the choking answer.  'Save her! Get her away !  She is an old acquaintance of mine--of mine, in England. Do; or I shall have to break my sword.'  'You know her? and you don't go over to her?' said De Pyrmont.  'I--yes, she knows me.'  'Then, why not present yourself?'  'Get her away.  Talk Weisspriess down.  He is for seizing her at all hazards.  It 's madness to provoke a conflict.  Just listen to the house! I may be broken, but save her I will.  De Pyrmont, on my honour, I will stand by you for ever if you will help me to get her away.'  'To suggest my need in the hour of your own is not a bad notion,' said the cool Frenchman.  'What plan have you?'  Wilfrid struck his forehead miserably.  'Stop Lieutenant Zettlisch.  Don't let him go up to her.  Don't--'  De Pyrmont beheld in astonishment that a speechlessness such as affects condemned wretches in the supreme last minutes of existence had come upon the Englishman.  'I'm afraid yours is a bad case,' he said; 'and the worst of it is, it's just the case women have no compassion for.  Here comes a parlementaire from the opposite camp.  Let's hear him.'  It was Luciano Romara.  He stood before them to request that the curtain should be raised.  The officers debated together, and deemed it prudent to yield consent.  Luciano stipulated further that the soldiers were to be withdrawn.  'On one wing, or on both wings?' said Captain Weisspriess, twinkling eyes oblique.  'Out of the house,' said Luciano.  The officers laughed.  'You must confess,' said De Pyrmont, affably, 'that though the drum does issue command to the horse, it scarcely thinks of doing so after a rent in the skin has shown its emptiness.  Can you suppose that we are likely to run when we see you empty-handed?  These things are matters of calculation.'  'It is for you to calculate correctly,' said Luciano.  As he spoke, a first surge of the exasperated house broke upon the stage and smote the curtain, which burst into white zigzags, as it were a breast stricken with panic.  Giacinta came running in to her mistress, and cloaked and hooded her hurriedly.  Enamoured; impassioned, Ammiani murmured in Vittoria's ear: 'My own soul!'  She replied: 'My lover!'  So their first love-speech was interchanged with Italian simplicity, and made a divine circle about them in the storm.  Luciano returned to his party to inform them that they held the key of the emergency.  'Stick fast,' he said.  'None of you move.  Whoever takes the first step takes the false step; I see that.'  'We have no arms, Luciano.'  'We have the people behind us.'  There was a fiercer tempest in the body of the house, and, on a sudden, silence.  Men who had invaded the stage joined the Italian guard surrounding Vittoria, telling that the lights had been extinguished; and then came the muffled uproar of universal confusion.  Some were for handing her down into the orchestra, and getting her out through the general vomitorium, but Carlo and Luciano held her firmly by them.  The theatre was a rageing darkness; and there was barely a light on the stage.  'Santa Maria!' cried Giacinta, 'how dreadful that steel does look in the dark!  I wish our sweet boys would cry louder.'  Her mistress, almost laughing, bade her keep close, and be still.  'Oh! this must be like being at sea,' the poor creature whined, stopping her ears and shutting her eyes.  Vittoria was in a thick gathering of her defenders; she could just hear that a parley was going on between Luciano and the Austrians.  Luciano made his way back to her.  'Quick!' he said; 'nothing cows a mob like darkness.  One of these officers tells me he knows you, and gives his word of honour--he's an Englishman--to conduct you out: come.'  Vittoria placed her hands in Carlo's one instant.  Luciano cleared a space for them.  She heard a low English voice.  'You do not recognize me?  There is no time to lose.  You had another name once, and I have had the honour to call you by it.'  'Are you an Austrian?' she exclaimed, and Carlo felt that she was shrinking back.  'I am the Wilfrid Pole whom you knew.  You are entrusted to my charge; I have sworn to conduct you to the doors in safety, whatever it may cost me.'  Vittoria looked at him mournfully.  Her eyes filled with tears.  'The night is spoiled for me!' she murmured.  'Emilia!'  'That is not my name.'  'I know you by no other.  Have mercy on me.  I would do anything in the world to serve you.'  Major de Pyrmont came up to him and touched his arm.  He said briefly: 'We shall have a collision, to a certainty, unless the people hear from one of her set that she is out of the house.'  Wilfrid requested her to confide her hand to him.  'My hand is engaged,' she said.  Bowing ceremoniously, Wilfrid passed on, and Vittoria, with Carlo and Luciano and her maid Giacinta, followed between files of bayonets through the dusky passages, and downstairs into the night air.  Vittoria spoke in Carlo's ear: 'I have been unkind to him.  I had a great affection for him in England.'  'Thank him; thank him,' said Carlo.  She quitted her lover's side and went up to Wilfrid with a shyly extended hand.  A carriage was drawn up by the kerbstone; the doors of it were open.  She had barely made a word intelligible; when Major de Pyrmont pointed to some officers approaching.  'Get her out of the way while there's time,' he said in French to Luciano.  'This is her carriage. Swiftly, gentlemen, or she's lost.'  Giacinta read his meaning by signs, and caught her mistress by the sleeve, using force.  She and Major de Pyrmont placed Vittoria, bewildered, in the carriage; De Pyrmont shut the door, and signalled to the coachman.  Vittoria thrust her head out for a last look at her lover, and beheld him with the arms of dark-clothed men upon him.  La Scala was pouring forth its occupants in struggling roaring shoals from every door. Her outcry returned to her deadened in the rapid rolling of the carriage across the lighted Piazza.  Giacinta had to hold her down with all her might.  Great clamour was for one moment heard by them, and then a rushing voicelessness.  Giacinta screamed to the coachman till she was exhausted.  Vittoria sank shuddering on the lap of her maid, hiding her face that she might plunge out of recollection.  The lightnings shot across her brain, but wrote no legible thing; the scenes of the opera lost their outlines as in a white heat of fire.  She tried to weep, and vainly asked her heart for tears, that this dry dreadful blind misery of mere sensation might be washed out of her, and leave her mind clear to grapple with evil; and then, as the lurid breaks come in a storm-driven night sky, she had the picture of her lover in the hands of enemies, and of Wilfrid in the white uniform; the torment of her living passion, the mockery of her passion by-gone.  Recollection, when it came back, overwhelmed her; she swayed from recollection to oblivion, and was like a caged wild thing.  Giacinta had to be as a mother with her.  The poor trembling girl, who had begun to perceive that the carriage was bearing them to some unknown destination, tore open the bands of her corset and drew her mistress's head against the full warmth of her bosom, rocked her, and moaned over her, mixing comfort and lamentation in one offering, and so contrived to draw the tears out from her, a storm of tears; not fitfully hysterical, but tears that poured a black veil over the eyeballs, and fell steadily streaming.  Once subdued by the weakness, Vittoria's nature melted; she shook piteously with weeping; she remembered Laura's words, and thought of what she had done, in terror and remorse, and tried to ask if the people would be fighting now, but could not.  Laura seemed to stand before her like a Fury stretching her finger at the dear brave men whom she had hurled upon the bayonets and the guns.  It was an unendurable anguish.  Giacinta was compelled to let her cry, and had to reflect upon their present situation unaided.  They had passed the city gates.  Voices on the coachman's box had given German pass-words.  She would have screamed then had not the carriage seemed to her a sanctuary from such creatures as foreign soldiers, whitecoats; so she cowered on.  They were in the starry open country, on the high-road between the vine-hung mulberry trees.  She held the precious head of her mistress, praying the Saints that strength would soon come to her to talk of their plight, or chatter a little comfortingly at least; and but for the singular sweetness which it shot thrilling to her woman's heart, she would have been fretted when Vittoria, after one long-drawn wavering sob, turned her lips to the bared warm breast, and put a little kiss upon it, and slept.     CHAPTER XXIII  FIRST HOURS OF THE FLIGHT  Vittoria slept on like an outworn child, while Giacinta nodded over her, and started, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4438"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 4 (#7)"],["body","what embowelled mountain they might be passing through, so cold was the air and thick the darkness; and wondered more at the old face of dawn, which appeared to know nothing of her agitation. But morning was better than night, and she ceased counting over her sins forward and backward; adding comments on them, excusing some and admitting the turpitude of others, with 'Oh! I was naughty, padre mio! I was naughty--she huddled them all into one of memory's spare sacks, and tied the neck of it, that they should keep safe for her father-confessor. At such times, after a tumult of the blood, women have tender delight in one another's beauty.  Giacinta doted on the marble cheek, upturned on her lap, with the black unbound locks slipping across it; the braid of the coronal of hair loosening; the chance flitting movement of the pearly little dimple that lay at the edge of the bow of the joined lips, like the cradling hollow of a dream.  At whiles it would twitch; yet the dear eyelids continued sealed.  Looking at shut eyelids when you love the eyes beneath, is more or less a teazing mystery that draws down your mouth to kiss them.  Their lashes seem to answer you in some way with infantine provocation; and fine eyelashes upon a face bent sideways, suggest a kind of internal smiling. Giacinta looked till she could bear it no longer; she kissed the cheek, and crooned over it, gladdened by a sense of jealous possession when she thought of the adored thing her mistress had been overnight.  One of her hugs awoke Vittoria, who said, 'Shut my window, mother,' and slept again fast.  Giacinta saw that they were nearer to the mountains.  Mountain- shadows were thrown out, and long lank shadows of cypresses that climbed up reddish-yellow undulations, told of the sun coming.  The sun threw a blaze of light into the carriage.  He shone like a good friend, and helped Giacinta think, as she had already been disposed to imagine, that the machinery by which they had been caught out of Milan was amicable magic after all, and not to be screamed at.  The sound medicine of sleep and sunlight was restoring livelier colour to her mistress.  Giacinta hushed her now, but Vittoria's eyes opened, and settled on her, full of repose.  'What are you thinking about?' she asked.  'Signorina, my own, I was thinking whether those people I see on the hill-sides are as fond of coffee as I am.'  Vittoria sat up and tumbled questions out headlong, pressing her eyes and gathering her senses; she shook with a few convulsions, but shed no tears.  It was rather the discomfort of their position than any vestige of alarm which prompted Giacinta to project her head and interrogate the coachman and chasseur.  She drew back, saying, 'Holy Virgin!  they are Germans.  We are to stop in half-an-hour.'  With that she put her hands to use in arranging and smoothing Vittoria's hair and dress--the dress of Camilla--of which triumphant heroine Vittoria felt herself an odd little ghost now.  She changed her seat that she might look back on Milan.  A letter was spied fastened with a pin to one of the cushions.  She opened it, and read in pencil writing:  'Go quietly.  You have done all that you could do for good or for ill. The carriage will take you to a safe place, where you will soon see your friends and hear the news.  Wait till you reach Meran.  You will see a friend from England.  Avoid the lion's jaw a second time.  Here you compromise everybody.  Submit, or your friends will take you for a mad girl.  Be satisfied.  It is an Austrian who rescues you.  Think yourself no longer appointed to put match to powder.  Drown yourself if a second frenzy comes.  I feel I could still love your body if the obstinate soul were out of it.  You know who it is that writes.  I might sign \"Michiella\" to this: I have a sympathy with her anger at the provoking Camilla.  Addio!  From La Scala.'  The lines read as if Laura were uttering them.  Wrapping her cloak across the silken opera garb, Vittoria leaned back passively until the carriage stopped at a village inn, where Giacinta made speedy arrangements to satisfy as far as possible her mistress's queer predilection for bathing her whole person daily in cold water.  The household service of the inn recovered from the effort to assist her sufficiently to produce hot coffee and sweet bread, and new green-streaked stracchino, the cheese of the district, which was the morning meal of the fugitives.  Giacinta, who had never been so thirsty in her life, became intemperately refreshed, and was seized by the fatal desire to do something: to do what she could not tell; but chancing to see that her mistress had silken slippers on her feet, she protested loudly that stouter foot-gear should be obtained for her, and ran out to circulate inquiries concerning a shoemaker who might have a pair of country overshoes for sale.  She returned to say that the coachman and his comrade, the German chasseur, were drinking and watering their horses, and were not going to start until after a rest of two hours, and that she proposed to walk to a small Bergamasc town within a couple of miles of the village, where the shoes could be obtained, and perhaps a stuff to replace the silken dress.  Receiving consent, Giacinta whispered, 'A man outside wishes to speak to you, signorina.  Don't be frightened.  He pounced on me at the end of the village, and had as little breath to speak as a boy in love.  He was behind us all last night on the carriage.  He mentioned you by name.  He is quite commonly dressed, but he's a gallant gentleman, and exactly like our Signor Carlo. My dearest lady, he'll be company for you while I am absent.  May I beckon him to come into the room?'  Vittoria supposed at once that this was a smoothing of the way for the entrance of her lover and her joy.  She stood up, letting all her strength go that he might the more justly take her and cherish her.  But it was not Carlo who entered.  So dead fell her broken hope that her face was repellent with the effort she made to support herself.  He said, 'I address the Signorina Vittoria.  I am a relative of Countess Ammiani.  My name is Angelo Guidascarpi.  Last night I was evading the sbirri in this disguise by the private door of La Scala, from which I expected Carlo to come forth.  I saw him seized in mistake for me.  I jumped up on the empty box-seat behind your carriage.  Before we entered the village I let myself down.  If I am seen and recognized, I am lost, and great evil will befall Countess Ammiani and her son; but if they are unable to confront Carlo and me, my escape ensures his safety!  'What can I do?' said Vittoria.  He replied, 'Shall I answer you by telling you what I have done?'  'You need not, signore!  'Enough that I want to keep a sword fresh for my country.  I am at your mercy, signorina; and I am without anxiety.  I heard the chasseur saying at the door of La Scala that he had the night-pass for the city gates and orders for the Tyrol.  Once in Tyrol I leap into Switzerland.  I should have remained in Milan, but nothing will be done there yet, and quiet cities are not homes for me.'  Vittoria began to admit the existence of his likeness to her lover, though it seemed to her a guilty weakness that she should see it.  'Will nothing be done in Milan?' was her first eager question.  'Nothing, signorina, or I should be there, and safe!'  'What, signore, do you require me to help you in?'  'Say that I am your servant.'  'And take you with me?'  'Such is my petition.'  'Is the case very urgent?'  'Hardly more, as regards myself, than a sword lost to Italy if I am discovered.  But, signorina, from what Countess Ammiani has told me, I believe that you will some day be my relative likewise.  Therefore I appeal not only to a charitable lady, but to one of my own family.'  Vittoria reddened.  'All that I can do I will do.'  Angelo had to assure her that Carlo's release was certain the moment his identity was established.  She breathed gladly, saying, 'I wonder at it all very much.  I do not know where they are carrying me, but I think I am in friendly hands.  I owe you a duty.  You will permit me to call you Beppo till our journey ends.'  They were attracted to the windows by a noise of a horseman drawing rein under it, whose imperious shout for the innkeeper betrayed the soldier's habit of exacting prompt obedience from civilians, though there was no military character in his attire.  The innkeeper and his wife came out to the summons, and then both made way for the chasseur in attendance on Vittoria.  With this man the cavalier conversed.  'Have you had food?' said Vittoria.  'I have some money that will serve for both of us three days.  Go, and eat and drink.  Pay for us both.'  She gave him her purse.  He received it with a grave servitorial bow, and retired.  Soon after the chasseur brought up a message.  Herr Johannes requested that he might have the honour of presenting his homage to her: it was imperative that he should see her.  She nodded.  Her first glance at Herr Johannes assured her of his being one of the officers whom she had seen on the stage last night, and she prepared to act her part.  Herr Johannes desired her to recall to mind his introduction to her by the Signor Antonio-Pericles at the house of the maestro Rocco Ricci.  'It is true; pardon me,' said Vittoria.  He informed her that she had surpassed herself at the opera; so much so that he and many other Germans had been completely conquered by her. Hearing, he said, that she was to be pursued, he took horse and galloped all night on the road toward Schloss Sonnenberg, whither, as it had been whispered to him, she was flying, in order to counsel her to lie 'perdu' for a short space, and subsequently to conduct her to the schloss of the amiable duchess.  Vittoria thanked him, but stated humbly that she preferred to travel alone.  He declared that it was impossible: that she was precious to the world of Art, and must "]]]
