His mutterings were full of gratitude, showing a vividly transient impression to what was about him, that vanished in a narrow-headed flight through clouds into lands of memory.  It pained him, he said, that he could not offer her marriage; but he requested that when his chin was shaved his moustache should be brushed up out of the way of the clippers, for he and all his family were conspicuous for the immense amount of life which they had in them, and his father had lain six-and-thirty hours bleeding on the field of Wagram, and had yet survived to beget a race as hearty as himself:--'Old Austria! thou grand old Austria!'  The smile was proud, though faint, which accompanied the apostrophe, addressed either to his country or to his father's personification of it; it was inexpressibly pathetic to Vittoria, who understood his 'Oesterreich,' and saw the weak and helpless bleeding man, with his eyeballs working under the lids, and the palms of his hands stretched out open-weak as a corpse, but conquering death.  The arrival of Jacopo and Johann furnished help to carry him onward to the nearest place of shelter.  Angelo would not quit her side until he had given money and directions to both the trembling fellows, together with his name, that they might declare the author of the deed at once if questioned.  He then bowed to Vittoria slightly and fled.  They did not speak.  The last sunbeams burned full crimson on the heights of the Adige mountains as Vittoria followed the two pale men who bore the wounded officer between them at a slow pace for the nearest village in the descent of the pass.  Angelo watched them out of sight.  The far-off red rocks spun round his eyeballs; the meadow was a whirling thread of green; the brown earth heaved up to him.  He felt that he was diving, and had the thought that there was but water enough to moisten his red hands when his senses left him.     CHAPTER XXVII  A NEW ORDEAL  The old city of Meran faces Southward to the yellow hills of Italy, across a broad vale, between two mountain-walls and torrent-waters. With one hand it takes the bounding green Passeyr, and with the other the brown-rolling Adige, and plunges them together in roaring foam under the shadow of the Western wall.  It stands on the spur of a lower central eminence crowned by a grey castle, and the sun has it from every aspect. The shape of a swan in water may describe its position, for the Vintschgau and the stony Passeyrthal make a strong curve on two sides as they descend upon it with their rivers, and the bosom of the city projects, while the head appears bending gracefully backward.  Many castles are in view of it; the loud and tameless Passeyr girdles it with an emerald cincture; there is a sea of arched vineyard foliage at his feet.  Vittoria reached the Castle of Sonnenberg about noon, and found empty courts and open doors.  She sat in the hall like a supplicant, disregarded by the German domestics, who beheld a travel-stained humble- faced young Italian woman, and supposed that their duty was done in permitting her to rest; but the duchess's maid Aennchen happening to come by, questioned her in moderately intelligible Italian, and hearing her name gave a cry, and said that all the company were out hunting, shooting, and riding, in the vale below or the mountain above.  \"Ah, dearest lady, what a fright we have all been in about you!  Signora Piaveni has not slept a wink, and the English gentleman has made great excursions every day to find you.  This morning the soldier Wilhelm arrived with news that his master was bringing you on.\"  Vittoria heard that Laura and her sister and the duchess had gone down to Meran.  Countess Lena von Lenkenstein was riding to see her betrothed shoot on a neighbouring estate.  Countess Anna had disappeared early, none knew where.  Both these ladies, and their sister-in-law, were in mourning for the terrible death of their brother, Count Paul Aennchen repeated what she knew of the tale concerning him.  The desire to see Laura first, and be embraced and counselled by her, and lie awhile in her arms to get a breath of home, made Vittoria refuse to go up to her chamber, and notwithstanding Aennchen's persuasions, she left the castle, and went out and sat in the shaded cart-track.  On the winding ascent she saw a lady in a black riding habit, leading her horse and talking to a soldier, who seemed to be receiving orders from her, and presently saluted and turned his steps downward.  The lady came on, and passed her without a glance.  After entering the courtyard, where she left her horse, she reappeared, and stood hesitating, but came up to Vittoria and said bluntly, in Italian:  \"Are you the signorina Campa, or Belloni, who is expected here?\"  The Austrian character and colouring of her features told Vittoria that this must be the Countess Anna or her sister.  \"I think I have been expected,\" she replied.  \"You come alone?\"  \"I am alone.\"  \"I am Countess Anna von Lenkenstein; one of the guests of the castle.\"  \"My message is to the Countess Anna.\"  \"You have a message?\"  Vittoria lifted the embroidered cigar-case.  Countess Anna snatched it from her hand.  \"What does this mean?  Is it insolence?  Have the kindness, if you please, not to address me in enigmas.  Do you\"--Anna was deadly pale as she turned the cigarcase from side to side--\"do you imagine that I smoke, 'par hasard?'\"  She tried to laugh off her intemperate manner of speech; the laugh broke at sight of a blood-mark on one corner of the case; she started and said earnestly, \"I beg you to let me hear what the meaning of this may be?\"  \"He lies in the Ultenthal, wounded; and his wish was that I should deliver it to you.\"  Vittoria spoke as gently as the harsh tidings would allow.  \"Wounded?  My God! my God!\"  Anna cried in her own language.  \"Wounded?- in the breast, then!  He carried it in his breast.  Wounded by what?  by what?\"  \"I can tell you no more.\"  \"Wounded by whom?\"  \"It was an honourable duel.\"  \"Are you afraid to tell me he has been assassinated?\"  \"It was an honourable duel.\"  \"None could match him with the sword.\"  \"His enemy had nothing but a dagger.\"  \"Who was his enemy?\"  \"It is no secret, but I must leave him to say.\"  \"You were a witness of the fight?\"  \"I saw it all.\"  \"The man was one of your party!  \"Ah!\"  exclaimed Vittoria, \"lose no time with me, Countess Anna, go to him at once, for though he lived when I left him, he was bleeding; I cannot say that he was not dying, and he has not a friend near.\"  Anna murmured like one overborne by calamity.  \"My brother struck down one day--he the next!\"  She covered her face a moment, and unclosed it to explain that she wept for her brother, who had been murdered, stabbed in Bologna.  \"Was it Count Ammiani who did this?\"  she asked passionately.  Vittoria shook her head; she was divining a dreadful thing in relation to the death of Count Paul.  \"It was not?\"  said Anna.  \"They had a misunderstanding, I know.  But you tell me the man fought with a dagger.  It could not be Count Ammiani. The dagger is an assassin's weapon, and there are men of honour in Italy still.\"  She called to a servant in the castle-yard, and sent him down with orders to stop the soldier Wilhelm.  \"We heard this morning that you were coming, and we thought it curious,\" she observed; and called again for her horse to be saddled.  \"How far is this place where he is lying?  I have no knowledge of the Ultenthal.  Has he a doctor attending him?  When was he wounded?  It is but common humanity to see that he is attended by an efficient doctor.  My nerves are unstrung by the recent blow to our family; that is why--Oh, my father! my holy father!\" she turned to a grey priest's head that was rising up the ascent, \"I thank God for you!  Lena is away riding; she weeps constantly when she is within four walls.  Come in and give me tears, if you can; I am half mad for the want of them.  Tears first; teach me patience after.\"  The old priest fanned his face with his curled hat, and raised one hand as he uttered a gentle chiding in reproof of curbless human sorrow.  Anna said to Vittoria, coldly, \"I thank you for your message:\" she walked into the castle by his side, and said to him there: \"The woman you saw outside has a guilty conscience.  You will spend your time more profitably with her than with me.  I am past all religious duties at this moment. You know, father, that I can open my heart.  Probe this Italian woman; search her through and through.  I believe her to be blood-stained and abominable.  She hates us.  She has sworn an oath against us.  She is malignant.\"  It was not long before Anna issued forth and rode down to the vale.  The priest beckoned to Vittoria from the gates.  He really supposed her to have come to him with a burdened spirit.  \"My daughter,\" he addressed her.  The chapter on human error was opened:\" We are all of one family--all of us erring children--all of us bound to abnegate hatred: by love alone are we saved.  Behold the Image of Love-- the Virgin and Child.  Alas! and has it been visible to man these more than eighteen hundred years, and humankind are still blind to it?  Are their ways the ways of comfort and blessedness?  Their ways are the ways of blood; paths to eternal misery among howling fiends.  Why have they not chosen the sweet ways of peace, which are strewn with flowers, which flow with milk?\"--The priest spread his hand open for Vittoria's, which she gave to his keeping, and he enclosed it softly, smoothing it with his palms, and retaining"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4439"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 5 (#4)"],["body"," as a worldly oyster between spiritual shells. \"Why, my daughter, why, but because we do not bow to that Image daily, nightly, hourly, momently!  We do not worship it that its seed may be sown in us.  We do not cling to it, that in return it may cling to us.\"  He spoke with that sensuous resource of rich feeling which the contemplation of the Image does inspire.  And Vittoria was not led reluctantly into the oratory of the castle to pray with him; but she refused to confess.  Thereupon followed a soft discussion that was as near being acerb as nails are near velvet paws.  Vittoria perceived his drift, and also the dear good heart of the old man, who meant no harm to her, and believed that he was making use of his professional weapons for her ultimate good.  The inquisitions and the kindness went musically together; she responded to the kindness, but rebutted the inquisitions; at which he permitted a shade of discontent to traverse his features, and asked her with immense tenderness whether she had not much on her mind; she expressing melodious gratitude for his endeavours to give her comfort.  He could not forbear directing an admonishment to her stubborn spirit, and was obliged, for the sake of impressiveness, to speak it harshly; until he saw, that without sweetness of manner and unction of speech, he left her untouched; so he was driven back to the form of address better suited to his nature and habits; the end of which was that both were cooing.  Vittoria was ashamed to tell herself how much she liked him and his ghostly brethren, whose preaching was always of peace, while the world was full of lurid hatred, strife, and division.  She begged the baffled old man to keep her hand in his.  He talked in Latinized Italian, and only appeared to miss the exact meaning of her replies when his examination of the state of her soul was resumed.  They sat in the soft colour of the consecrated place like two who were shut away from earth. Often he thought that her tears were about to start and bring her low; for she sighed heavily; at the mere indication of the displacement of her hand, she looked at him eagerly, as if entreating him not to let it drop.  \"You are a German, father?\"  she said.  \"I am of German birth, my daughter.\"  \"That makes it better.  Remain beside me.  The silence is sweet music.\"  The silence was broken at intervals by his murmur of a call for patience! patience!  This strange scene concluded with the entry of the duchess, who retired partly as soon as she saw them.  Vittoria smiled to the old man, and left him: the duchess gave her a hushed welcome, and took her place.  Vittoria was soon in Laura's arms, where, after a storm of grief, she related the events of the journey following her flight from Milan.  Laura interrupted her but once to exclaim, \"Angelo Guidascarpi!\"  Vittoria then heard from her briefly that Milan was quiet, Carlo Ammiani in prison.  It had been for tidings of her lover that she had hastened over the mountains to Meran.  She craved for all that could be told of him, but Laura repeated, as in a stupefaction, \"Angelo Guidascarpi!\"  She answered Vittoria's question by saying, \"You could not have had so fatal a companion.\"  \"I could not have had so devoted a protector.\"  \"There is such a thing as an evil star.  We are all under it at present, to some degree; but he has been under it from his birth.  My Sandra, my beloved, I think I have pardoned you, if I ever pardon anyone!  I doubt it; but it is certain that I love you.  You have seen Countess Anna, or I would have told you to rest and get over your fatigue.  The Lenkensteins are here--my poor sister among them.  You must show yourself.  I was provident enough to call at your mother's for a box of your clothes before I ran out of wretched Milan.\"  Further, the signora stated that Carlo might have to remain in prison. She made no attempt to give dark or fair colour to the misery of the situation; telling Vittoria to lie on her bed and sleep, if sleep could be persuaded to visit her, she went out to consult with the duchess. Vittoria lay like a dead body on the bed, counting the throbs of her heart.  It helped her to fall into a state of insensibility.  When she awoke, the room was dark; she felt that some one had put a silken cushion across her limbs.  The noise of a storm traversing the vale rang through the castle, and in the desolation of her soul, that stealthy act of kindness wrought in her till she almost fashioned a vow upon her lips that she would leave the world to toss its wrecks, and dedicate her life to God.  For, O heaven! of what avail is human effort?  She thought of the Chief, whose life was stainless, but who stood proscribed because his aim was too high to be attained within compass of a mortal's years.  His error seemed that he had ever aimed at all.  He seemed less wise than the old priest of the oratory.  She could not disentangle him from her own profound humiliation and sense of fallen power.  Her lover's imprisonment accused her of some monstrous culpability, which she felt unrepentingly, not as we feel a truth, but as we submit to a terrible force of pressure.  The morning light made her realize Carlo's fate, to whom it would penetrate through a hideous barred loophole--a defaced and dreadful beam. She asked herself why she had fled from Milan.  It must have been some cowardly instinct that had prompted her to fly.  \"Coward, coward! thing of vanity! you, a mere woman!\" she cried out, and succeeded in despising herself sufficiently to think it possible that she had deserved to forfeit her lover's esteem.  It was still early when the duchess's maid came to her, bringing word that her mistress would be glad to visit her.  From the duchess Vittoria heard of the charge against Angelo.  Respecting Captain Weisspriess, Amalia said that she had perceived his object in wishing to bring the great cantatrice to the castle; and that it was a well-devised audacious scheme to subdue Countess Anna:--\"We Austrians also can be jealous.  The difference between us is, that it makes us tender, and you Italians savage.\"  She asked pointedly for an affirmative, that Vittoria was glad to reply with, when she said: \"Captain Weisspriess was perfectly respectful to you?\"  She spoke comforting words of Carlo Ammiani, whom she hoped to see released as soon as the excitement had subsided.  The chief comfort she gave was by saying that he had been originally arrested in mistake for his cousin Angelo.  \"I will confide what is now my difficulty here frankly to you,\" said the duchess.  \"The Lenkensteins are my guests; I thought it better to bring them here.  Angelo Guidascarpi has slain their brother--a base deed! It does not affect you in my eyes; you can understand that in theirs it does.  Your being present--Laura has told me everything--at the duel, or fight, between that young man and Captain Weisspriess, will make you appear as his accomplice--at least, to Anna it will; she is the most unreasoning, the most implacable of women.  She returned from the Ultenthal last night, and goes there this morning, which is a sign that Captain Weisspriess lives.  I should be sorry if we lost so good an officer.  As she is going to take Father Bernardus with her, it is possible that the wound is serious.  Do you know you have mystified the worthy man exceedingly?  What tempted you to inform him that your conscience was heavily burdened, at the same time that you refused to confess?\"  \"Surely he has been deluded about me,\" said Vittoria.  \"I do but tell you his state of mind in regard to you,\" the duchess pursued.  \"Under all the circumstances, this is what I have to ask: you are my Laura's guest, therefore the guest of my heart.  There is another one here, an Englishman, a Mr. Powys; and also Lieutenant Pierson, whom, naughty rebel that you are, you have been the means of bringing into disgrace; naturally you would wish to see them: but my request is, that you should keep to these rooms for two or three days: the Lenkensteins will then be gone.  They can hardly reproach me for retaining an invalid. If you go down among them, it will be a cruel meeting.\"  Vittoria thankfully consented to the arrangement.  They agreed to act in accordance with it.  The signora was a late riser.  The duchess had come on a second visit to Vittoria when Laura joined them, and hearing of the arrangement, spurned the notion of playing craven before the Lenkensteins, who, she said, might think as it pleased them to think, but were never to suppose that there was any fear of confronting them.  \"And now, at this very moment, when they have their triumph, and are laughing over Viennese squibs at her, she has an idea of hiding her head--she hangs out the white flag! It can't be.  We go or we stay; but if we stay, the truth is that we are too poor to allow our enemies to think poorly of us.  You, Amalia, are victorious, and you may snap your fingers at opinion.  It is a luxury we cannot afford.  Besides, I wish her to see my sister and make acquaintance with the Austrianized-Italian--such a wonder as is nowhere to be seen out of the Serabiglione and in the Lenkenstein family. Marriage is, indeed, a tremendous transformation.  Bianca was once declared to be very like me.\"  The brow-beaten duchess replied to the outburst that she had considered it right to propose the scheme for Vittoria's seclusion on account of the Guidascarpi.  \"Even if that were a good reason, there are better on the other side,\" said Laura; adding, with many little backward tosses of the head, \"That story has to be related in full before I denounce Angelo and Rinaldo.\"  \"It cannot be denied that they are assassins,\" returned the duchess.  \"It cannot be denied that they have killed one man or more.  For you, Justice drops from the bough: we have to climb and risk our necks for it. Angelo stood to defend my darling here.  Shall she be ashamed of him?\"  \"You will never persuade me to tolerate assassination,\" "]]]
