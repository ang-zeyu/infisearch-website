(MARGUERITE hastily takes off the jewels, and is about   to replace them in the casket.)  _Mart._  Oh woe! oh, unexpected news!  _Mar._                   (aside).          How beats my heart          Now he is near!  _Faust_                   (aside).          The fever of my love          Is lull'd when at her side!  _Mep._                   (to MARTHA).          Your much-loved spouse is dead,          And sends you greeting!  _Mart._                (to MEPHISTOPHELES).          Sent he nothing else to me?  _Mep._                   (to MARTHA).          No. We'll punish him for't;          Upon this very day          We'll find him a successor.  _Faust_                 (to MARGUERITE).          Wherefore lay aside these jewels?  _Mar._                   (to FAUST).          Jewels are not made for me;          'Tis meet I leave them where they are.  _Mep._                   (to MARTHA).          Who would not gladly unto          You present the wedding-ring?  _Mart._                   (aside).          Indeed!              (to MEPHISTOPHELES).          You think so?  _Mep._                   (sighing).          Ah me! ah, cruel fate!  _Faust_                 (to MARGUERITE)          Pray lean upon mine arm!  _Mar._                   (retiring).          Leave me, I humbly pray!  _Mep._             (offering his arm to MARTHA).          Take mine!  _Mart._                    (aside).          In sooth, a comely knight!                (taking his arm.)  _Mep._                    (aside).          The dame is somewhat tough!      (MARGUERITE yields her arm to FAUST, and withdraws with him.      MEPHISTOPHELES and MARTHA remain together.)  _Mart._  And so you are always traveling!  _Mep._   A hard necessity it is, madame!          Alone and loveless. Ah!  _Mart._ In youth it matters not so much,          But in late years 'tis sad indeed!          Right melancholy it is in solitude          Our olden age to pass!  _Mep._   The very thought doth make me shudder.          But still, alas! what can I do?  _Mart._  If I were you, I'd not delay,          But think on't seriously at once.  _Mep._   I'll think on't!  _Mart._  At once and seriously!      (They withdraw. FAUST and MARGUERITE re-enter.)  _Faust._ Art always thus alone?  _Mar._   My brother is at the wars,          My mother dear is dead!          By misadventure, too,          My dear sister have I lost.          Dear sister mine!          My greatest happiness was she.          Sad sorrows these;          When our souls with love are filled,          Death tears the loved one from us!          At morn, no sooner did she wake,          Than I was always at her side!          The darling of my life was she!          To see her once again,          I'd gladly suffer all.  _Faust._ If heaven, in joyous mood,          Did make her like to thee,          An angel must she indeed have been!  _Mar._   Thou mock'st me!  _Faust._ Nay, I do love thee!  _Mar._                     (sighing).          Flatterer! thou mock'st me!          I believe thee not! thou seekest to deceive.          No longer will I stay, thy words to hear.  _Faust_                    (to MARGUERITE).          Nay, I do love thee! Stay, oh stay!          Heaven hath with an angel crown'd my path.          Why fear'st thou to listen?          It is my heart that speaks.  (Re-enter MEPHISTOPHELES and MARTHA.)  _Mart._                 (to MEPHISTOPHELES).           Of what now are you thinking?          You heed me not--perchance you mock me.          Now list to what I say.--          You really must not leave us thus!  _Mep._                    (to MARTHA).          Ah, chide me not, if my wanderings I resume.          Suspect me not; to roam I am compelled!          Need I attest how gladly I remain.          I hear but thee alone.                    (Night comes on.)  _Mar._                    (to FAUST).          It grows dark,--you must away.  _Faust_                    (embracing her).          My loved one!  _Mar._   Ah! no more!                    (Escapes.)  _Faust._ Ah, cruel one, would'st fly?                    (Pursuing her.)  _Mep._        (aside, whilst MARTHA angrily turns her back to him).          The matter's getting serious,          I must away.               (Conceals himself behind a tree.)  _Mart._                       (aside).          What's to be done? he's gone!          What ho, good sir!                       (Retires.) _Mep._   Yes, seek for me--that's right!          I really do believe          The aged beldame would          Actually have married Satan!  _Faust_                    (without).          Marguerite!  _Mart._                    (without).          Good sir!  _Mep._ Your servant!              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE IX.  MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Mep._   'Twas high time!          By night, protected,          In earnest talk of love,          They will return! 'Tis well!          I'll not disturb          Their amorous confabulation!          Night, conceal them in thy darkest shade.          Love, from their fond hearts          Shut out all troublesome remorse.          And ye, O flowers of fragrance subtle,          This hand accurs'd          Doth cause ye all to open!          Bewilder the heart of Marguerite!                (Disappears amid the darkness.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE X.  FAUST and MARGUERITE.  _Mar._   It groweth late, farewell!  _Faust._ I but implore in vain.          Let me thy hand take, and clasp it,          And behold but thy face once again,          Illum'd by that pale light,          From yonder moon that shines,          O'er thy beauteous features shedding          Its faint but golden ray.  _Mar._   Oh, what stillness reigns around,          Oh, ineffable mystery!          Sweetest, happiest feeling,          I list; a secret voice          Now seems to fill my heart.          Still its tone again resoundeth in my bosom.          Leave me awhile, I pray.                (Stoops and picks a daisy.)  _Faust._ What is it thou doest?  _Mar._   This flower I consult.              (She plucks the petals of the daisy.)  _Faust_                      (aside).          What utters she in tones subdued?  _Mar._   He loves me!--no, he loves me not!          He loves me!--no!--He loves me!  _Faust._ Yes, believe thou this flower,          The flower of loves.          To thine heart let it tell          The truth it would teach,--          He loves thee! Know'st thou not          How happy 'tis to love?          To cherish in the heart a flame that never dies!          To drink forever from the fount of love!  _Both._  We'll love for ever!  _Faust._ Oh, night of love! oh, radiant night!          The bright stars shine above;          Oh, joy, this is divine!          I love, I do adore thee!  _Mar._   Mine idol fond art thou!          Speak, speak again!          Thine, thine I'll be;          For thee I'll gladly die.  _Faust._ Oh, Marguerite!  _Mar._        (suddenly tearing herself from FAUST'S arms).                             Ah, leave me!  _Faust._ Cruel one!  _Mar._   Fly hence! alas! I tremble!  _Faust._ Cruel one!  _Mar._   Pray leave me!  _Faust._ Would'st thou have me leave thee?          Ah! see'st thou not my grief?          Ah, Marguerite, thou breakest my heart!  _Mar._   Go hence! I waver! mercy, pray!          Fly hence! alas! I tremble!          Break not, I pray, thy Marguerite's heart!  _Faust._ In pity--  _Mar._   If to thee I'm dear,          I conjure thee, by thy love,          By this fond heart,          That too readily its secret hath revealed,          Yield thee to my prayer,--          In mercy get thee hence!               (Kneels at the feet of FAUST.)  _Faust_        (after remaining a few moments silent, gently raising her).          O fairest child,          Angel so holy,          Thou shalt control me,          Shalt curb my will.          I obey; but at morn--  _Mar._   Yes, at morn,          Very early.  _Faust._ One word at parting.          Repeat thou lovest me.  _Mar._   Adieu!      (Hastens towards the pavilion, then stops short on the threshold,   and wafts a kiss to FAUST.)  _Faust._ Adieu! Were it already morn!              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE XI.  FAUST, MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Mep._   Fool!  _Faust._ You overheard us?  _Mep._   Happily. You have great need, learned Doctor,          To be sent again to school.  _Faust._ Leave me!  _Mep._   Deign first to listen for a moment,          To the speech she rehearses to the stars.          Dear master, delay. She opens her window.      (MARGUERITE opens the window of the pavilion,   and remains with her head resting on her hand.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE XII.  The preceding. MARGUERITE.  _Mar._   He loves me! Wildly beats my heart!          The night-bird's song,          The evening breeze,          All nature's sounds together say,          \"He loves thee!\"          Ah! sweet, sweet indeed          Now is this life to me!          Another world it seems;          The very ecstasy of love is this!          With to-morrow's dawn,          Haste thee, oh dear one,          Haste thee to return! Yes, come!  _Faust._          (rushing to the window, and grasping her hand).              Marguerite!  MAR.               Ah!  _Mep._                     (mockingly).                        Ho! ho!      (MARGUERITE, overcome, allows her head to fall on FAUST'S shoulder.   MEPHISTOPHELES opens the door of the garden, and departs, laughing   derisively. The curtain falls.)     ACT IV.   SCENE I.  _Marguerite's Room._  SIEBEL and MARGUERITE.  _Sie._                  (quietly approaching).

And yet I have a manly heart,          And I will sure avenge thee.          The seducer's life shall forfeit pay.  _Mar._                    Whose life?  _Sie._   Need I name him? The wretch          Who thus hast deserted thee!  _Mar._   In mercy, speak not thus!  _Sie._   Dost love him still, then?  _Mar._   Ay, I love him still!          But not to you, good Siebel, should I repeat this tale.  _Sie._                         I.          When all was young, and pleasant May was blooming,          I, thy poor friend, took part with thee in play;          Now that the cloud of autumn dark is glooming,          Now is for me, too, mournful the day.          Hope and delight have passed from life away.                          II.          We were not born with true love to trifle,          Nor born to part because the wind blows cold.          What though the storm the summer garden rifle,          Oh, Marguerite! oh, Marguerite!          Still on the bough is left a leaf of gold.  _Mar._   Bless you, my friend, your sympathy is sweet.          The cruel ones who wrong me thus          Cannot close against me          The gates of the holy temple.          Thither will I go to pray          For him and for our child.              (Exit. SIEBEL follows slowly after.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE II.  _Interior of a Church._  MARGUERITE, then MEPHISTOPHELES.      (Women enter the church and cross the stage.   MARGUERITE enters after them, and kneels.)  _Mar._                     O heaven!          Permit thy lowly handmaiden          To prostrate herself before thine altar.  _Mep._   No, thou shalt not pray!          Spirits of evil, haste ye at my call,          And drive this woman hence!  _Cho. of Demons._    Marguerite!  _Mar._   Who calls me?  _Cho._   Marguerite!  _Mar._   I tremble!--oh, heaven!          My last hour is surely nigh!      (The tomb opens and discloses MEPHISTOPHELES,   who bends over to MARGUERITE's ear.)  _Mep._   Remember the glorious days          When an angel's wings          Protected thy young heart.          To church thou camest then to worship,          Nor hadst thou then sinned 'gainst heaven.          Thy prayers then issued          From an unstained heart          And on the wings of faith          Did rise to the Creator.          Hear'st thou their call?          'Tis hell that summons thee!          Hell claims thee for its own!          Eternal pain, and woe, and tribulation,          Will be thy portion!  _Mar._   Heaven! what voice is this          That in the shade doth speak to me?          What mysterious tones are these!  _Religious Cho._ When the last day shall have come,          The cross in heaven shall shine forth,          This world to dust shall crumble.  _Mar._   Ah me! more fearful still becomes their song.  _Mep._   No pardon hath heaven left for thee!          For thee e'en heaven hath no more light!  _Religious Cho._ What shall we say unto high heav'n?          Who shall protection find          When innocence such persecution meets?  _Mar._   A heavy weight my breast o'erpowers,--          I can no longer breathe!  _Mep._   Nights of love, farewell!          Ye days of joy, adieu!          Lost, lost for aye art thou!  _Mar. and Cho._          Heav'n! hear thou the prayer          Of a sad, broken heart!          A bright ray send thou          From the starry sphere          Her anguish to allay!  _Mep._   Marguerite, lost, lost art thou!  _Mar._                           Ah!

VALENTINE, Soldiers, then SIEBEL.  _Cho._   Our swords we will suspend          Over the paternal hearth;          At length we have returned.          Sorrowing mothers no longer          Will bewail their absent sons.              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE IV.  VALENTINE and SIEBEL.  _Val._                (perceiving SIEBEL, who enters).          Ah, Siebel, is it thou?  _Sie._   Dear Valentine!  _Val._   Come, then, to my heart!                  (embracing him).          And Marguerite?  _Sie._          (confused).          Perhaps she's yonder at the church.  _Val._   She doubtless prays for my return.          Dear girl, how pleased          She'll be to hear me tell          My warlike deeds!  _Cho._   Glory to those who in battle fall,          Their bright deeds we can with pride recall.          May we, then, honor and fame acquire,          Their glorious deeds our hearts will inspire!          For that dear native land where we first drew breath,          Her sons, at her command proudly brave e'en death.          At their sacred demand who on us depend,          Our swords we will draw, their rights to defend.          Homeward our steps we now will turn,--          Joy and peace await us there!          On, on at once, nor loiter here;          On, then, our lov'd ones to embrace,--          Affection calls, fond love doth summon us,          Yes, many a heart will beat          When they our tale shall hear.  _Val._   Come, Siebel, we'll to my dwelling          And o'er a flask of wine hold converse.              (Approaching MARGUERITE'S house.)  _Sie._   Nay, enter not!  _Val._   Why not, I pray?--Thou turn'st away;          Thy silent glance doth seek the ground--          Speak, Siebel--what hath happened?  _Sie._                 (with an effort.)          No! I cannot tell thee!  _Val._ What mean'st thou?                (Rushing toward house.)   _Sie._                   (withholding him.)          Hold, good Valentine, take heart!  _Val._   What is't thou mean'st!                   (Enters the house.)  _Sie._   Forgive her!          Shield her, gracious Heaven!      (Approaches the church. FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES      enter at the back; MEPHISTOPHELES carries a guitar.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE V.  FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES.  (Faust goes towards MARGUERITE's house, but hesitates.)  _Mep._   Why tarry ye?          Let us enter the house.  _Faust._ Peace! I grieve to think that I          Brought shame and sorrow hither.  _Mep._   Why see her again, then, after leaving her?          Some other sight might be more pleasing.          To the sabbath let us on.  _Faust_                      (sighing).          Oh, Marguerite!  _Mep._   My advice, I know,          Availeth but little          Against thy stubborn will.          Doctor, you need my voice!     (Throwing back his mantle, and accompanying himself on the guitar.)                          I.          Maiden, now in peace reposing,          From thy sleep awake,          Hear my voice with love imploring,          Wilt thou pity take?          But beware how thou confidest          Even in thy friend,          Ha! ha! ha!          If not for thy wedding finger          He a ring doth send.                          II.          Yes, sweet maiden, I implore thee,--          Oh, refuse not this,--          Smile on him who doth adore thee,          Bless him with thy kiss.          But beware how thou confidest,          Even in thy friend,          Ha! ha! ha!          If not for thy wedding finger          He a ring doth send.             (VALENTINE rushes from the house.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE VI.  VALENTINE and the before-named.  _Val._   Good sir, what want you here?  _Mep._   My worthy fellow, it was not to you          That we addressed our serenade!  _Val._   My sister, perhaps, would more gladly hear it!     (VALENTINE draws his sword, and breaks MEPHISTOPHELES' guitar.)  _Faust._ His sister!  _Mep._                    (to VALENTINE)          Why this anger?          Do ye not like my singing?  _Val._   Your insults cease!          From which of ye must I demand          Satisfaction for this foul outrage?          Which of ye must I now slay?                  (FAUST draws his sword.)          'Tis he!  _Mep._   Your mind's made up, then!          On, then, doctor, at him, pray!  _Val._   Oh, heaven, thine aid afford,          Increase my strength and courage,          That in his blood my sword          May wipe out this fell outrage!  _Faust._ What fear is this unnerves my arm?          Why falters now my courage?          Dare I to take his life,          Who but resents an outrage?  _Mep._   His wrath and his courage          I laugh alike to scorn!          To horse, then, for his last journey          The youth right soon will take!  _Val._       (taking in his hand the medallion suspended round his neck).          Thou gift of Marguerite,          Which till now hath ever saved me,          I'll no more of thee--I cast thee hence!          Accursed gift, I throw thee from me!                 (Throws it angrily away.)  _Mep._                       (aside).          Thou'll repent it!  _Val._                     (to FAUST).          Come on, defend thyself!  _Mep._                  (to FAUST, in a whisper).          Stand near to me, and attack him only;          I'll take care to parry!                      (They fight.)  _Val._                (falling).          Ah!  _Mep._                 Behold our hero,          Lifeless on the ground!          Come, we must hence--quick, fly!              (Exit, dragging FAUST after him.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE VII.      (Enter Citizens, with lighted torches;   afterwards SIEBEL and MARGUERITE.)  _Cho._   Hither, hither, come this way--          They're fighting here hard by!          See, one has fallen;          The unhappy man lies prostrate there.          Ah! he moves--yes, still he breathes;          Quick, then, draw nigh          To raise and succor him!  _Val._   'Tis useless, cease these vain laments.          Too often have I gazed          On death, to heed it          When my own time hath come!      (MARGUERITE appears at the back, supported by"]]]
