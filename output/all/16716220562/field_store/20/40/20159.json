Long, twisting lines of similar demarcation showed where the communication trenches ran.  Now they were over No Man's land, sailing along serenely, and the artillery down below had already opened the morning concert on both fronts, when--  \"Biff, puff----!\" came a time-fuse shrapnel and burst scarcely a hundred feet in front of the machine. Then another and another as the \"Archies\" below spotted the hornet, and tried to give her a packet.  Suddenly they were in a cloud of yellow smoke and half-poisonous fumes, which made them gasp and sputter. Then, owing to the bursting of the shells and the heavy concussions they found themselves in a succession of air-pockets.  \"Look out, Jock!\" cried Dastral, as the machine rocked and swayed, banking over once or twice as though she had been hit.  For several minutes they ran the gauntlet of this heavy fire from the German A.A. guns, but the terrific speed at which they were travelling--now nearly one hundred and twenty miles per hour--soon carried them beyond the range of the enemy's guns.  Then it was that the day's work really began. Their orders were to reconnoitre behind the enemy's lines and to report by wireless code any occurrence, such as the threat of a massed attack by infantry, the moving of transport columns, or the locating of heavy artillery. It was also necessary, above all, to watch the skies for the appearance of hostile aircraft.  The other 'planes which started with the hornet that morning are seen low down on the horizon, to the north and the south. They also are searching all the terrain for any signs of activity on the part of the Boche.  Spurts of flame, like jets of fire, are seen in many places. These are the German fieldguns firing upon the British trenches. The observer does not make any particular note of these; he is out for bigger game.  Suddenly, the observer steadies his glasses, resting his arm for a moment on the side of the fuselage. The loop line of the Combles-Ginchy railway is just ahead of them and slightly on their right. Though it is very early yet, Jock notices that the line about Ginchy is crowded with traffic.  \"Ahoy there, Dastral!\" he calls down the speaking tube.  \"Yes,\" comes back the laconic answer.  \"Railway line blocked with traffic. Troops detraining, I think. Put her over a bit.\"  \"Right-o!\"  Dastral jams over the rudder bar with his foot and, responding to her huge tail rudder the hornet comes round in a swift circle, banking a little as the joy-stick is also put over. Then Jock takes another view, exclaiming, as he does so,  \"Yes, by Jove, there must be a whole division of them. Here goes!\"  And dropping the glasses into the pocket prepared for them, he rapidly uncoils the long pendant wire, and begins to tap the keys of his instrument.  \"Caught them on the nap, Jock, eh? Stroke of luck. Case of the early bird. Tell the heavies to give 'em hell, old man,\" shouted Dastral, but the conversation was carried away into the morning breeze, for jock was already sending the message which would shortly bring the thunder.  \"Zip-zip-zip, zur-r-r-r, zip!\" went the brief coded message, back over Longueval and Ginchy; over Contalmaison and the trenches to where the British heavy batteries were waiting.  Behind the Ancre, in a little dug-out, an expert operator catches up the message. He has been waiting for it impatiently since dawn. The brief tapping which his receiver picks up, tells him exactly the spot on the terrain behind the enemy's lines where the thunder is needed. The whole map is scaled out into tiny sections and sub-sections, each with a number or letter to indicate the point where the concentrated fire is needed.  \"Quick!\" cries the operator to the little exchange. \"Give me H.Q. Heavy Batteries.\" Then as the reply comes through he gives:  \"A-2-3. Concentrated fire!\"  Within four minutes, while the hornet still circles over the luckless Germans, now alive to their danger and rushing over each other in their haste to finish the detrainment of the column, flashes of fire are seen away to the west, and through the air comes a heavy explosive shell. It is followed by another and yet another. As they explode, the observer sees the earth blotted out from view for a few seconds. He notes how near the first shots fall to the target. Then he taps his keys once more.  \"Zur, zip-zip!\" cries the machine, and the next shell falls into the midst of the column, destroying nearly a whole train. And so for another ten minutes the airmen remain, altering the range until at least a dozen direct hits are scored, and the damage done to the railway, the trains, and the division or so of men is tremendous.  Very quickly, however, the men are scattered and placed out of danger, hiding in the woods, and under hedges and trees where they cannot be seen.  The Germans, aware of that dangerous pest overhead, have rushed up anti-aircraft guns to deal with it, and have also telephoned to the nearest aerodromes for their beloved Fokkers. So shortly after, having done as much damage as possible in a short space of time, the hornet moves off to reconnoitre further afield.  \"Watch for their verdomt Fokkers, Jock,\" cries the pilot. \"They may appear at any minute. Himmelman himself may be in the neighbourhood.\"  \"Himmelman?\" queries Jock, more to himself than to his comrade, as he looks round uneasily, for on the previous day he had heard some tall tales of the doings of this crack German flyer.  Then as they move off and open out the engine to gain speed, Jock sweeps the horizon for a sight of enemy 'planes, for a strange curiosity grips him at the thought of Himmelman, and he wonders half aloud whether it will ever be his fate to meet this renowned airman, who was said to have brought down more machines than any other man living.  But there is little time for soliloquy in the life of an airman in war time. He must ever be on the _qui vive_. And so for another half an hour, seeing no enemy 'planes to engage and remembering that he is out first of all for a reconnaissance, he watches the ground more and more closely.  They have moved south some distance by this time, and have crossed the railway near Cl√©ry. Below them they see the narrow waters of the Somme, glistening in the sunshine, for by now the sun is up, and there is the promise of a brilliant day. Jock is keenly watching the white road that leads from Peronne to Albert.  \"Ah! Ah!\" He gasps. \"What is that dark object that breaks the white, sunlit road, as though some dark shadow has fallen across it?\"  He points it out to the pilot, with a few gestures, and Dastral spirals round, and makes off towards the place at a rapid rate.  As they approach the spot Jock scrutinises it yet more closely, for it looks suspicious. Then suddenly putting aside his glasses once more, he calls out,  \"Enemy column on the march!\"  \"The deuce it is?\" queries the pilot.  \"Yes, ammunition column, I think, but we'll soon find out.\"  Then the tapping begins again, and the message is flung across the battle-ground and is picked up. With a swift mental calculation the observer has reckoned up when the head of the column will reach a certain point in the road, where a bridge carries the road over a tributary of the Somme.  \"Swis-s-s-h! Boom-m-m-m!\" comes the first heavy fifteen-inch shell.  It is a little short and another message on the keys is necessary.  This time the shell falls plump right into the middle of the column, for so accurately are the guns trained, that, though they cannot see the object they are firing at, if the message sent only gives the exact position on the map, a direct hit is soon gained.  The consternation of the Germans can be better imagined than described. Thinking themselves in comparative security so far behind the lines, a huge shell without the slightest warning explodes near by, and the next lands clean in the middle of the column.  The object hit was a motor lorry conveying ammunition up to the guns. The first explosion is followed by another, more terrific than the first, for a couple of hundred shells are exploded, and when the smoke and dust have cleared away the observer and his pilot look down, and there is a huge gap in the column, for two of the lorries are blazing, several have been overturned, and one has disappeared entirely from view.  Not only so but the road is blocked for the next six or seven hours for all traffic, and not only will guns go short of ammunition but more than one battalion of the German army will go short of food for the next twenty-four hours.  For half an hour the guns continue to shell the rest of the column, which by that time has managed to get the undamaged motors away, by dashing blindly down any side turning that leads to anywhere, out of that terrible inferno.  For a little while longer the observer continues to send cryptic messages back to headquarters, which have the immediate effect of altering and adjusting the range of the heavy batteries, until the whole convoy has dispersed sufficiently to prevent the waste of further ammunition.  Modern warfare is like a game of chess, with move and countermove, and this applies just as much to war in the air as to warfare on land. Evidently this morning, however, the enemy have been caught napping. His air patrols have not yet been sighted. Surely he has had time to deal with the offender up there in the skies, who has been reading the secret of his lines, and the movements in his rear, or can it be that he is laying a trap for the unwary?  So far the daring young adventurers have had it all their own way, but a surprise is in store for them. Meanwhile, however, they continue to circle around, noting half a dozen little things which Jock briefly enters on his memoranda sheet. A few photographs are also taken with the telescopic camera, for in reconnoitring the observer has noted some new lines of brown coloured earth showing up plainly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44348"],["title","Dastral of the Flying Corps (#7)"],["body","the green. Becoming suspicious he pointed them out to Dastral.  Holding the joy stick between his legs, Dastral takes the glasses for a minute, then cries out,  \"New trenches, I believe!\"  \"I think so, but we must make sure. I want a snapshot. Reserve trenches probably. Perhaps the enemy are thinking of falling back the next time they are attacked in force.\"  \"If so, we've got his secret. It's important; we must go down and see. Hold tight!\"  At that moment while the couple were intent upon the line of new trenches below, they failed to notice a little cloud that was coming up out of the eastern horizon. Till now it had been bright and clear, as it often is at the break of dawn, but the first little cloud, no bigger than a man's hand, had arisen. And it was in that cloud that the danger lay.  Heedless, however, of this little thing, and willing to take some deadly risks to get the precious photograph, which might prove to be the final link in some theory held at headquarters as to the position on the enemy's front, they ignored the coming danger.  Putting forward the controlling gear the hornet dipped her head, and made a graceful nose-dive at a terrific speed, losing in fifteen seconds that which she would shortly very badly need, namely, her altitude.  The long, downward glide is finished at last. They are within a thousand feet of the newly-dug trenches when they flatten out, and the camera is released and a series of short, sharp snaps are taken, as the instrument click-clicks. To-morrow, when these are developed, they will tell the divisional commander much that he wants to know, and may explain something which has puzzled him for days past.  At the moment, however, when they flatten out, half a dozen Archies, artfully concealed under a clump of bushes, suddenly open fire upon the intruder.  \"Whis-s-s! Bang!\" comes one of the shells and bursts within fifty feet of the 'plane.  For a few seconds they are blinded and stunned by the explosion, the flying metal and the deadly fumes. They gasp for their breath, and the aeroplane rocks wildly, but the terrific speed given them by the nose-dive carries them through the maelstrom once more.  \"Are you hurt, Dastral?\" shouts the observer, as soon as he himself regains the power of speech.  The pilot turns round just for half a second, and shakes his head, but Jock sees for himself that though he evidently does not know it, Dastral is wounded, for the visible part of his face is covered with blood. Jock, himself, feels that his left arm is useless, and he clenches it tightly with the other.  There is no time to waste in words, however, for another peril is at hand. They are soon out of range of the Archies, which, nevertheless, have riddled the planes with jagged holes. No vital part has been hit, however, and the two adventurers are not severely wounded.  \"Is the engine all right?\" shouts Jock, as he sees Dastral peer into the mechanism once or twice.  \"She's 'pukka' (all right),\" comes back the answer.  \"Then we'd better make for home. Breakfast will be ready. It's nearly six o'clock, and we've been out an hour and a half.\"  Dastral nods, and heads the machine for home, altering the controls again in order to get a good altitude ready for crossing the trenches.  As he does so he happens to look away to the eastward, as the machine banks.  \"Great Scott, look there!\"  Jock did look, and in a cloud, not a couple of miles away, he saw two specks racing for them with twice the speed of an express train.  Seizing his glasses he fixed them for one second upon the objects, to discover, if possible, the rounded marks of the Allies upon the newcomers. Instead, he saw the black cross in a white rounded field, showing distinctly upon both machines.  \"Enemy 'planes!\" he shouted to the pilot.  \"Himmelman?\" suggested Dastral in a half bantering tone. \"We're up against it this time, old man. He's the 'star turn' of the enemy's corps, and he fights like the deuce. I would like to have met him upon even terms. As it is, if we cannot leave him and get back with this information, we must fight him.\"  \"Open the engine out, Dastral, and I'll bring the machine gun to bear.\"  Fortunately, the hornet had not been hit in any vital part, and her engine was running splendidly. But she had lost her altitude to get the precious photograph, having dropped nearly six thousand feet, and, in fighting, altitude counts a great deal, for it is much the same as the \"weather gage\" for which our sea-dogs used to contend in the olden days.  The hornet mounted two guns, but in a stern chase like this she could use only the rear weapon. If he could only cripple one of their pursuers by getting the first shot in Jock knew that they would then be on more even terms, despite the fact that the enemy 'planes, having caught them unawares, had got the advantage of them.  \"What are they, Jock?\" asked the pilot.  \"Fighting scouts, I fancy.\" Then half a minute later he added:  \"Yes, Fokkers, both of them, single seaters with the gun forward.\"  \"Are they gaining much?\"  \"Yes, they're creeping up rapidly. Now they're nose-diving to gain speed. Shall I open fire?\"  \"Not yet. Wait till they're within six hundred feet before you open. Cripple the leader if you can.\"  \"Here they come. They're about to open on us.\"  \"Biff, ping, ping, rap, rap!\" and the Hornet was sprayed from wing to wing with machine gun bullets.  \"Good heavens, the machine's like a sieve! She'll not last much longer at this rate,\" cried Dastral, as he looked round and surveyed the damage done. Then, turning round towards the observer, who was sighting his gun, he shouted wildly:  \"Give it him, Jock!\"  Then it was that Jock let fly, a full drum of ammunition clean at the fuselage of the leading enemy 'plane. Thus it was that nerve told. Not for nothing had Jock gained the highest honours in the School of Aerial Gunnery before putting his brevet up.  \"Got him!\" he cried exultantly, and the first machine went down in a spinning nose-dive under that withering fire, for the pilot at the controls was stone dead, shot through the head.  The next instant, however, the master-pilot of all the German airmen was upon them. While his companion had attacked from the level, he had kept his gage, and now, at the critical moment, he had appeared as it were from the clouds above their heads, firing from his bow gun as he did a thrilling nose-dive.  It was ever Himmelman's game to pounce upon his opponent and to beat him nearer and nearer to the ground, until he was forced to crash or make a landing in enemy territory. Once again he was about to triumph, so he thought, for never before had he caught his man so neatly.  But Dastral was no ordinary aviator, and though his machine was raked again from end to end, yet the engine still ran, and to Himmelman's surprise his quarry proved much more elusive than he thought. With his superior speed, owing to his downward drive, the German air-fiend swept round and round the hornet, firing all the while, but Dastral, his blood thoroughly up now, found an answering manoeuvre each time.  The end was near, however, for the English machine could not hold out much longer. Not only were the planes riddled, but several stays and struts were gone, and several times the engine had missed. To make matters worse, after the second drum the machine gun had jammed, and things seemed hopeless.  \"Confound the gun! He's coming on again, Dastral,\" shouted the observer, clenching his fist, and forgetting all about the bullet in his arm.  \"Look out, then, I'm going to ram him. If I've got to go down, he's going down with me.\"  The two machines were almost on a level now, and when the German came on, Dastral just put the joy-stick over, and made straight for his opponent.  \"Donner and blitz!\" yelled the irate Boche, for he did not understand such tactics. For one aeroplane to ram another in mid air at two thousand feet seemed incredible, but here was this mad Britisher coming straight for him.  \"Mein Gott, no!\" gasped Himmelman, and by a skilful manoeuvre he sheered off, though thousands of his fellow-countrymen were watching him from below, for they were now almost over the trenches.  \"Bravo, Dastral!\" yelled Jock, though but an instant before his heart seemed to be in his mouth, as the pilot made his almost fatal dash for his opponent.  Seeing that Himmelman had failed in his move, the anti-aircraft guns opened fire again from below, but the hornet sailed on over the trenches, and Himmelman did not follow, for out of the west three British fighters were coming to the rescue.  \"Will she hold out, Dastral?\" the observer asked a moment later, as they passed the British trenches, out of the range of the German Archies.  \"I think so. Can you spot the aerodrome?\"  \"Yes, there it is, a little to the right.\"  \"Thanks, I see it now,\" came the softened reply, for Dastral was rolling a little in his seat, as though he held the joy-stick with difficulty.  Jock bent over to help him, and the next minute they landed safely on the level turf. And Jock remembered hearing a voice say:  \"Come along now. We're waiting breakfast for you in the mess.\"     CHAPTER IV  STRAFING THE BABY-KILLERS   DASTRAL and Jock received a hearty welcome home that morning. Although it was scarcely yet six o'clock, their day's work was finished, and a good day's work it had been. Dastral's laconic report was handed to the Squadron-Commander. Then, as soon as his slight flesh wounds had been dressed by the genial \"Number Nine,\" as Captain Young, the medical officer for the squadron, was called, they went in to early morning breakfast at the mess.  \"So you've had a scrap with Himmelman, have you, Lieutenant?\" asked Number Nine at the breakfast table.  \"Just a slight skirmish,\" replied Dastral.  \"You're lucky to get away from him!\"  \"You think so?\" queried the young pilot, pouring out another cup of coffee, and pressing Jock, whose wound was giving him a good deal of pain, to another"]]]
