When this was noised abroad, a great multitude of people came together, both to hear and see concerning the strange and marvelous circumstance which had taken place. She talked to them a short time, and then sang a hymn, after which she dismissed them, promising to meet them the next day at the village church, where she would tell them all about the strange manner in which she had been healed.  The following day according to promise, she proceeded to the meeting house, and when she arrived there a large congregation had collected. Soon after she entered, the minister arose and remarked, that as many of the congregation had doubtless come to hear a recital of the strange circumstance which had taken place in the neighborhood, and as he himself felt more interested in it than in hearing a gospel discourse, he would open the meeting and then give place to Mrs. Tuttle.  The minister then requested her to sing a hymn; she accordingly did so, and her voice was as high and clear as it had ever been. Having sung, she arose and addressed the audience as follows:--\"I seemed to be borne away to the world of spirits, where I saw the Savior, as through a veil, which appeared to me about as thick as a spider's web, and he told me that I must return again to warn the people to prepare for death; that I must exhort them to be watchful as well as prayerful; that I must declare faithfully unto them their accountability before God, and the certainty of their being called to stand before the judgment seat of Christ; and that if I would do this, my life should be prolonged.\" After which, she spoke much to the people upon the uncertainty of life.  When she sat down, her husband and sister, also those who were with her during the last night of her sickness, arose and testified to her appearance just before her sudden recovery.  Of these things she continued to speak boldly for the space of three years. At the end of which time she was seized with the consumption which terminated her earthly existence.  A short time before Lovisa was healed in the miraculous manner before stated, Lovina was taken with a severe cough which ended in consumption. She lingered three years. During which time she spoke with much calmness of her approaching dissolution, contemplating death with all that serenity which is characteristic of the last moments of those who fear God, and walk uprightly before him. She conjured her young friends to remember that life upon this earth cannot be eternal. Hence the necessity of looking beyond this vale of tears, to a glorious inheritance, \"where moths do not corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.\"  The care of Lovina, during her illness, devolved chiefly upon myself. The task, though a melancholy one, I cheerfully performed, and, although she had much other attention, I never allowed myself to go an hour, at a time, beyond the sound of her voice while she was sick. A short time before she breathed out her last moments, which was in the night, she awakened me, and requested that I would call father and mother, for she wished to see them, as she would soon be gone. When they came, she said, \"Father and mother, now I am dying, and I wish you to call my young associates, that I may speak to them before I die.\" She then requested me to place her in a chair, and as soon as the young people who were called in, were seated, she commenced speaking. After talking a short time to them, she stopped, and, turning to her mother, said, \"Mother, will you get me something to eat? it is the last time you will ever bring me nourishment in this world.\" When my mother had complied with her request, she eat a small quantity of food, with apparent appetite, then gave back the dish, saying, \"There, mother, you will never get me anything to eat again.\"  After which, she turned to the company, and proceeded with her remarks, thus:--\"I do not know when I received any material change of heart, unless it was when I was ten years old. God, at that time, heard my prayers, and forgave my sins; and ever since then I have endeavored to serve him according to the best of my abilities. And I have called you here to give you my last warning--to bid you all farewell, and beseech you to endeavor to meet me where parting shall be no more.\"  Shortly after this, holding up her hands, and looking upon them as one would upon a trifling thing unobserved before, she said, with a smile upon her countenance, \"See, the blood is settling under my nails.\" Then, placing the fingers of her left hand across her right she continued thus, \"Tis cold to there--soon this mortal flesh will be food for worms.\" Then, turning to me, she said, \"Now, sister Lucy, will you help me into bed.\"  I did as I was directed, carrying her in my arms just as I would a child. Although I was but thirteen years old, she was so emaciated that I could carry her with considerable ease.  As I was carrying her to bed, my hand slipped. At this she cried out, \"Oh! Sister, that hurt me.\" This, indeed, gave me bitter feelings. I was well assured, that this was the last sad office I should ever perform for my sister, and the thought that I had caused her pain in laying her on her death bed, wounded me much.  Soon after this, she passed her hand over her face, and again remarked, \"My nose is now quite cold.\" Then, slightly turning and straightening herself in bed, she continued, \"Father, mother, brother, sister, and dear companions, all farewell, I am going to rest--prepare to follow me; for      \"Death! 'tis a melancholy day     To those that have no God,     When the poor soul is forced away     To seek her last abode.      \"In vain to heaven she lifts her eyes;     But guilt, a heavy chain,     Still drags her downwards from the skies,     To darkness, fire, and pain      \"Awake and mourn, ye heirs of hell,     Let stubborn sinners fear;     You must be driven from earth, and dwell     A long Forever there!      \"See how the pit gapes wide for you,     And flashes in your face;     And thou, my soul, look downward too,     And sing recovering grace.      \"He is a God of sov'reign love,     Who promised heaven to me,     And taught my thoughts to soar above,     Where happy spirits be.      \"Prepare me, Lord for thy right hand,     Then come the joyful day,     Come, death, and some celestial band,     To bear my soul away.\"  After repeating this hymn, she folded her hands across her breast, and then closed her eyes for ever.  Having led my readers to the close of Lovina's life, I shall return to Lovisa, of whom there only remains the closing scene of her earthly career.  In the course of a few months subsequent to the death of sister Lovina, my father received a letter from South Hadley, stating that Lovisa was very low of the consumption, and that she earnestly desired him to come and see her as soon as possible, as she expected to live but a short time.  My father set out immediately, and when he arrived there, he found her in rather better health than he expected. In a few days after he got there, she resolved in her heart to return with him at all hazards. To this her father unwillingly consented, and, after making the requisite preparations, they started for Gilsum.  They traveled about four miles, and came to an inn kept by a man by the name of Taff. Here her father halted, and asked her if she did not wish to tarry a short time to rest herself. She replied in the affirmative. By the assistance of the landlord, she was presently seated in an easy chair. My father then stepped into the next room to procure a little water and wine for her. He was absent but a moment; however, when he returned it was too late, her spirit had fled from its earthly tabernacle to return no more, until recalled by the trump of the archangel.  My father immediately addressed a letter to mother, informing her of Lovisa's death, lest the shock of seeing the corpse unexpectedly should overcome her. And as soon as he could get a coffin, he proceeded on his journey for Gilsum, a distance of fifty miles.  She was buried by the side of her Sister Lovina, according to her own request.  The following is part of a hymn composed by herself, a few days previous to her decease:--      Lord, may my thoughts be turned to thee--     Lift thou my heavy soul on high;     Wilt thou, O Lord, return to me     In mercy, Father, ere I die!     My soaring thoughts now rise above--     Oh fill my soul with heavenly love.      Father and mother, now farewell;     And husband, partner of my life,     Go to my father's children, tell     That lives no more on earth thy wife,     That while she dwelt in cumbrous clay,     For them she prayed both night and day.      My friends, I bid you all adieu;     The Lord hath called, and I must go--     And all the joys of this vain earth,     Are now to me of little worth:     'Twill be the same with you as me,     When brought as near eternity.  Thus closes this mournful recital, and when I pass with my readers into the next chapter, with them probably may end the sympathy aroused by this rehearsal, but with me it must last while life endures.    CHAPTER IV.  LIFE OF STEPHEN MACK.  My brother Stephen, who was next in age to Jason, was born in the town of Marlow, June 15, 1766.  I shall pass his childhood in silence, and say nothing about him until he attained the age of fourteen, at which time he enlisted in the army, the circumstances of which were as follows:  A recruiting officer came into the neighborhood to draft soldiers for the Revolutionary war, and he called out a company of militia to which my brother belonged, in order to take therefrom such as were best qualified to do military duty. My brother, being very anxious to go into the army at this time, was so fearful that he would be passed by on account of his age, that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45619"],["title","History of the Prophet Joseph, (#4)"],["body","sweat stood in large drops on his face, and he shook like an aspen leaf. Fortunately the officer made choice of him among others, and he entered the army and continued in the service of his country until he was seventeen. During this time he was in many battles, both on land and sea, and several times narrowly escaped death by famine; but, according to his own account, whenever he was brought into a situation to fully realize his entire dependence upon God, the hand of Providence was always manifested in his deliverance.  Not long since I met with an intimate acquaintance of my brother Stephen, and requested him to furnish me such facts as were in his possession in relation to him; and he wrote the following brief, yet comprehensive account, for the gratification of my readers:      I, Horace Stanly, was born in Tunbridge, Orange county, Vermont,     August 21, 1798. I have been personally acquainted with Major Mack     and his family ever since I can remember, as I lived in the same     township, within one mile and a half of the Major's farm, and two     miles from his store, and eight miles from Chelsea, the county seat     of Orange county, where he conducted the mercantile and tinning     business.      My eldest brother went to learn the tinning business of the Major's     workmen. The Major being a man of great enterprise, energetic in     business, and possessed of a high degree of patriotism, launched     forth on the frontiers of Detroit, in the year 1800 (if I recollect     rightly), where he immediately commenced trading with the Indians.      He left his family in Tunbridge, on his farm, and while he was     engaged in business at Detroit he visited them--sometimes once in a     year, in eighteen months, or in two years, just as it happened.      I visited Detroit, November 1, 1820, where I found the Major     merchandising upon quite an extensive scale, having six clerks in     one store; besides this, he had many other stores in the territory     of Michigan, as well as in various parts of Ohio.      His business at Pontiac was principally farming and building, but     in order to facilitate these two branches of business, he set in     operation a saw and flour mill, and afterwards added different     branches of mechanism. He made the turnpike road from Detroit to     Pontiac at his own expense. He also did considerable other public     work, for the purpose of giving employment to the poor.      He never encouraged idleness, or the man above his business. In     1828, having been absent from Detroit a short time, I returned.     The Major was then a member of the Council of the territory, and     had acted a very conspicuous part in enhancing its prosperity and     enlarging its settlement; and it was a common saying, that he had     done much more for the territory than any other individual.      In short, the Major was a man of talents of the first order. He was     energetic and untiring. He always encouraged industry, and was very     cautious how he applied his acts of charity.      Respectfully by      Horace Stanly.  My brother was in the city of Detroit in 1812, the year in which Hull surrendered the territory to the British crown. My brother being somewhat celebrated for his prowess, was selected by General Hull to take the command of a company, as captain. After a short service in this office, he was ordered to surrender. At this his indignation was roused to the highest pitch. He broke his sword across his knee, and throwing it into the lake, exclaimed that he would never submit to such a disgraceful compromise while the blood of an American continued to run through his veins.  This drew the especial vengeance of the army upon his head; and his property, doubtless, would have been sacrificed to their resentment, had they known the situation of his affairs. But this they did not know, as his housekeeper deceived them by a stratagem, related by Mr. Stanly, as follows:      At the surrender of Detroit, not having as yet moved his family     hither, Major Mack had an elderly lady, by the name of Trotwine,     keeping house for him. The old lady took in some of the most     distinguished British officers as boarders. She justified them in     their course of conduct towards the Yankees, and, by her shrewdness     and tact, she gained the esteem of the officers, and thus secured     through them the good will of the soldiery, so far as to prevent     their burning (what they supposed to be) her store and dwelling,     both of which were splendid buildings.      The Major never forgot this service done him by the old lady, for     he ever afterwards supported her handsomely.  Thus was a great amount of goods and money saved from the hands of his enemies. But this is not all: the news came to her ears that they were about to burn another trading establishment belonging to the Major, and, without waiting to consult him, she went immediately to the store, and took from the counting-room several thousand dollars, which she secreted until the British left the city. The building and goods were burned.  As soon as the English left the territory, he recommenced business, and removed his family from Tunbridge to Detroit. Here they remained but a short time, when he took them to Pontiac; and as soon as they were well established or settled in this place, he himself went to the city of Rochester, where he built a sawmill.  But, in the midst of his prosperity, he was called away to experience another state of existence, with barely a moment's warning, for he was sick only four days from the time he was first taken ill until he died, and even on the fourth day, and in the last hour of his illness, it was not supposed to be at all dangerous, until his son, who sat by his bedside, discovered he was dying.  He left his family with an estate of fifty thousand dollars, clear of encumbrance.    CHAPTER V.  LYDIA MACK, THIRD DAUGHTER OF SOLOMON MACK.  Of my sister Lydia I shall say but little; not that I loved her less, or that she was less deserving of honorable mention; but she seemed to float more with the stream of common events than those who have occupied the foregoing pages; hence fewer incidents of a striking character are furnished for the mind to dwell upon.  She sought riches and obtained them; yet in the day of prosperity she remembered the poor, for she dealt out her substance to the needy, with a liberal hand, to the end of her days, and died the object of their affection. As she was beloved in life, so she was bewailed in death.    CHAPTER VI.  DANIEL MACK--HE RESCUES THREE MEN FROM A WATERY GRAVE.  Daniel comes next in order. He was rather worldly-minded, yet he was not vicious; and if he had any peculiar trait of character, it was this--he possessed a very daring and philanthropic spirit, which led him to reach forth his hand to the assistance of those whose lives were exposed to danger, even to the hazard of his own life. For instance: he in company with several others, was once standing on the bank of Miller's river, in the town of Montague, when one of the number proposed taking a swim. Daniel objected, saying it was a dangerous place to swim in, yet they were determined, and three went in; but, going out into the stream rather too far they were overpowered by the current, and a kind of eddy which they fell into, and they sank immediately.  At this, Daniel said, \"Now, gentlemen, these men are drowning; who will assist them at the risk of his life?\" No one answered. At this, he sprang into the water, and, diving to the bottom, found one of them fastened to some small roots. Daniel took hold of him, and tore up the roots to which he was clinging, and brought him out, and then told the by-standers to get a barrel, for the purpose of rolling him on it, in order to make him disgorge the water which he had taken. He then went in again, and found the other two in the same situation as the first, and saved them in like manner.  After rolling them a short time on the barrel, he took them to a house, and gave them every possible attention, until they had so far recovered as to be able to speak. As soon as they could talk, one of them fixing his eyes upon Daniel, said, \"Mr. Mack, we have reason to look upon you as our savior, for you have delivered us from a watery tomb; and I would that I could always live near you. We are now assured that you have not only wisdom to counsel, but when men have spurned your advice, you still have that greatness of soul which leads you to risk your own life to save your fellow man. No, I will never leave you as long as I live, for I wish to convince you that I ever remember you, and that I will never slight your counsel again.\"  In this they were all agreed, and they carried out the same in their future lives.    CHAPTER VII.  SOLOMON MACK.  My youngest brother, Solomon, was born and married in the town of Gilsum, state of New Hampshire, where he is still living; and although he is now very aged, he has never traveled farther than Boston, to which place his business leads him twice a year.  He has gathered to himself in this rocky region, fields, flocks, and herds, which multiply and increase upon the mountains. He has been known at least twenty years, as Captain Solomon Mack, of Gilsum; but as he lives to speak for himself, and as I have to do chiefly with the dead, and not the living, I shall leave him, hoping that, as he has lived peaceably with all men, he may die happily.  I have now given a brief account of all my father's family, save myself; and what I have written has been done with the view of discharging an obligation which I considered resting upon me, inasmuch as they have all passed off this stage of action, except myself and youngest brother. And seldom do I meet with an individual with whom I was even acquainted in my early years, and I am constrained to exclaim--\"The friends of my youth! where are they?\" The tomb replies, \"Here are they!\" But,"]]]
