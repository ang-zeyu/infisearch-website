THE MORMON DOCTRINE OF DEITY  THE ROBERTS-VAN DER DONCKT DISCUSSION  TO WHICH IS ADDED A DISCOURSE  JESUS CHRIST: THE REVELATION OF GOD  BY B. H. ROBERTS.  ALSO A COLLECTION OF AUTHORITATIVE MORMON UTTERANCES ON THE BEING AND NATURE OF GOD.  \"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the character of God; and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another.\"--Joseph Smith.  \"He who possesses a knowledge of God, and a knowledge of man, will not easily commit sin.\"--Talmud.  Salt Lake City, Utah.  1903.    PREFACE.  In nothing have men so far departed from revealed truth as in their conceptions of God. Therefore, when it pleased the Lord in these last days to open again direct communication with men, by a new dispensation of the gospel, it is not surprising that the very first revelation given was one that revealed himself and his Son Jesus Christ. A revelation which not only made known the _being_ of God, but the _kind_ of a being he is. The Prophet Joseph Smith, in his account of his first great revelation, declares that he saw \"two personages,\" resembling each other in form and features, but whose brightness and glory defied all description. One of these personages addressed the prophet and said, as he pointed to the other--  \"_This is my beloved Son, hear him_.\"  This was the revelation with which the work of God in the last days began. The revelation of God, the Father; and of God, the Son. They were seen to be two distinct personages. They were like men in form; but infinitely more glorious in appearance, because perfect and divine. The Old Testament truth was reaffirmed by this revelation--\"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him.\" Also the truth of the New Testament was reaffirmed--Jesus Christ was shown to be the express image of the Father's person, hence God, the Father, was in form like the Man, Christ Jesus, who is also called \"the Son of Man.\"  Again the Old Testament truth was revealed--\"The _Gods_ said let _us_ make man in _our_ image, and in _our_ likeness.\" That is, more than _one_ God was engaged in the work of creation. Also the truth of the New Testament was again reaffirmed--the Father and the Son are seen to be two separate and distinct persons or individuals; hence the Godhead is plural, a council, consisting of three distinct persons, as shown at the baptism of Jesus, and throughout the conversations and discourses of Jesus and his inspired apostles.  All this, coming so sharply in conflict with the ideas of an apostate Christendom which had rejected the plain anthropomorphism of the Old and New Testament revelations of God; also the scriptural doctrine of a plurality of Gods, for a false philosophy-created God, immaterial and passionless--all this, I say, could not fail to provoke controversy; for the revelation given to Joseph Smith challenged the truth of the conception of God held by the modern world-pagan, Jew, Mohammedan and Christian alike.  It was not to be expected, then, that controversy could be avoided, though it has been the policy of the Elders of the Church to avoid debate as far as possible--debate which so often means contention, a mere bandying of words--and have trusted in the reaffirmation of the old truths of revelation, accompanied by a humble testimony of their divinity, to spread abroad a knowledge of the true God. Still, controversy, I repeat could not always be avoided. From the beginning, \"Mormon\" views of Deity have been assailed. They have been denounced as \"awful blasphemy;\" \"soul destroying;\" \"the lowest kind of materialism;\" \"destructive of all truly religious sentiment;\" \"the worst form of pantheism;\" \"the crudest possible conception of God;\" \"absolutely incompatible with spirituality;\" \"worse than the basest forms of idolatry.\" These are a few of the phrases in which \"Mormon\" views of Deity have been described. Defense against these attacks has been rendered necessary from time to time; and whenever Elders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have entered into discussions on the subject of Deity, they have not failed to make it clear that the scriptures sustained their doctrine, although they may not always have been successful in stopping the denunciations, sarcasm, and ridicule of their opponents. This, however, is matter of small moment, since making clear the truth is the object of discussion, not superior strength in denunciation, bitterness in invective, keenness in sarcasm, or subtilty in ridicule.  In the winter and summer of 1901, unusual interest was awakened in \"Mormon\" views of Deity, in consequence of a series of lectures on the subject delivered by a prominent sectarian minister of Salt Lake City, and other discourses delivered before sectarian conventions of one kind or another held during the summer months of the year named. Now it so happened that for that same year the General Board of the Young Men's Improvement Associations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had planned a course of theological study involving consideration of this same subject--the being and nature of God; therefore, when the Mutual Improvement Associations of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion met in conference on the 18th of August of that year, and the writer was invited to deliver an address at one of the sessions of the conference, the time to him seemed opportune to set forth as clearly as might be the doctrine of the Church of Christ as to God. Accordingly the discourse, which makes chapter one in this book, was delivered. The discourse attracted some considerable attention, being published both in the _Deseret News_ and _Improvement Era_: in the latter publication, in revised form. Through a copy of this magazine the discourse fell into the hands of the Reverend C. Van Der Donckt, of Pocatello, Idaho, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church; and he wrote a Reply to it, which by the courtesy of the editors of the _Improvement Era_ was published in that magazine, and now appears as chapter two in this work.  It was very generally conceded that Rev. Van Der Donckt's Reply was an able paper--a view in which I most heartily concur; and it had the additional merit of being free from offensive personalities or any indulgence in ridicule or sarcasms of those principles which the gentleman sought to controvert. Some were of opinion that the Rev. gentleman's argument could not be successfully answered. This was a view in which I did not concur; for however unequal my skill in debate might be as compared with that of the Rev. gentleman of the Catholic Church, I had, and have now, supreme confidence in the truth of the doctrines I believe and advocate; and I was sure this advantage of having the truth would more than outweigh any want of skill in controversy on my part. In this confidence the Rejoinder was written and published in the _Improvement Era_, and now appears as chapter three in this work. How successfully the Rejoinder meets the criticism upon our doctrines by the Rev. gentleman who wrote the Reply, will, of course, be determined by the individual reader.  The discourse with which this controversy begins appears in chapter one as it did in the _Era_; unchanged except by the enlargement of a quotation or two from Dr. Draper's works, and Sir Robert Ball's writings, and the addition of one or two notes, with here and there a mere verbal change which in no way affects the thought or argument of the discourse, as I recognize the fact that any alteration which would change the argument or introduce new matter in the discourse, would be unfair to Mr. Van Der Donckt. The Rev. gentleman's Reply is, of course, exactly as it appeared in the _Improvement Era_ for August and September, 1902. In the Rejoinder I have felt more at liberty, and therefore have made some few changes in the arrangement of paragraphs, and have here and there strengthened the argument, though even in this division of the discussion the changes in the _Era_ copy are but slight.  In chapter four I publish another discourse--_Jesus Christ: the Revelation of God_, which I trust will emphasize and render even more clear than my first discourse the belief of the Church that Jesus Christ is the complete and perfect revelation of God;--that such as Jesus Christ is, God is.  In chapters five, six, seven and eight is a collection of utterances from our sacred scriptures, and from some of the prophets in the Church, on the doctrine of Deity, which I may say without reserve will be found extremely valuable to the student of this great subject; and these passages are so arranged as to make clear the fact that our doctrines on the subject of Deity are today what they have been from the commencement; and while there may have been an unfolding of the doctrines, an enlargement of our understanding of them, there is nothing in our doctrines on Deity today but what was germinally present in that first great revelation received by the Prophet Joseph Smith, in which God made himself known once more to a prophet, who knew him, as Moses did, face to face--as a man knows his friend.

THE \"MORMON\" DOCTRINE OF DEITY.[A]  [Footnote A: A lecture originally delivered before the conference of the Mutual Improvement Associations of the Salt Lake Stake of Zion, August 18, 1901.]    CHAPTER I.  I.  FORM OF GOD.  MY brethren and sisters, there are two things which conjoin to make this conference of the Young Men's and Young Women's Improvement Associations of Salt Lake Stake of Zion an interesting occasion. One is the approaching working season of the Young Men's Associations. They will this winter take up a course of study in \"Mormon\" doctrine--the first principles of the Gospel, or at least, some of those principles; and a large division of the Manual which has been prepared for their use will deal with the subject of the Godhead. For this reason I thought the time opportune to call attention to some of the doctrinal features pertaining to this subject. The Prophet Joseph Smith made this important statement: \"It is the first principle of the Gospel to know for a certainty the character of God;\" then he added something which to some ears is a little offensive--\"and to know that we may converse with him, as one man converses with another.\" On the same occasion, he also said: \"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens.[A]\" Since, then, to know the character of God is one of the first principles of the Gospel, the subject of the Godhead is given a prominent place in the Manual for our Young Men's Associations during the coming season. This is one thing which makes this conference an interesting occasion.  [Footnote A: History of Joseph Smith: _Millennial Star_, Vol. xxiii, p. 246.]  Another thing which contributes to the interest of this conference, and also to this subject of the Godhead, is the attention which of late has been given to what is called the \"Mormon view of God\" by sectarian ministers among us. The interest found expression in a course of lectures during the past few months by one of the prominent ministers of Salt Lake City,[A] and also in a discourse delivered by another minister before the Teachers' association of the Utah Presbytery,[B] in which certain strictures were offered concerning our doctrine of God. It will perhaps be well to read the report of what in substance was said on that occasion by the reverend gentleman who thought proper to take up this subject before that association. I read from the synopsis of his discourse published in one of the morning papers:  [Footnote A: This was Rev. Alfred H. Henry, Pastor First M. B. Church.]  [Footnote B: This was Dr. Paden of the Presbyterian church, August 16, 1901.]       At this point Dr. Paden made his address, first taking up some     of the standard writings on \"Mormon\" doctrine and reading from     them the ideas of God as incorporated in the \"Mormon\" faith. He     read from the Catechism in relation to the Godhead, wherein it is     stated that there are not only more Gods than one, but that God     is a being of parts, with a body like that of a man. He then read     from the Doctrine and Covenants, where it is stated that the words     of the priesthood are the words of God. After calling attention     to the material view of God as set forth in these teachings, the     speaker said that he thought he could see a tendency towards a     more spiritual idea of God among the younger and more enlightened     members of the dominant church, and noticed this in the writings     of Dr. Talmage especially. Referring to the Adam-God idea, the     speaker said that he had not investigated it much, but thought that     the \"Mormon\" Church was ashamed of such an idea. He placed special     stress on the idea that when men attempted to give God a human     form they fashioned him after their own weaknesses and frailties.     A carnal man, he said, had a carnal God, and a spiritual man a     spiritual God. The teaching of a material God, said he, and of a     plurality of Gods, I think is heathenish. The material conception     of God is the crudest possible conception.  I take it that we may classify under three heads the complaints here made against us with reference to the doctrine of Deity.  First, we believe that God is a being with a body in form like man's; that he possesses body, parts and passions; that in a word, God is an exalted, perfected man.  Second, we believe in a plurality of Gods.  Third, we believe that somewhere and some time in the ages to come, through development, through enlargement, through purification until perfection is attained, man at last, may become like God--a God.  I think these three complaints may be said to cover the whole ground of what our reverend critics regard as our error in doctrine on the subject of Deity.  The task before me, on this occasion, is to take this subject and present to you what in reality the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints teaches with reference to the Godhead.  Very naturally, one stands in awe of the subject, so large it is, and so sacred it is. One can only approach it with feelings of reverential awe, and with a deep sense of his own inability to grasp the truth and make it plain to the understandings of men. In the presence of such a task, one feels like invoking the powers divine to aid him in his undertaking; and paraphrasing Milton a little, one could well cry aloud, what in me is dark, illumine; what low, raise and support, that to the height of this great argument I may justify to men the faith we hold of God.  Here let me say that we are dependent upon that which God has been pleased to reveal concerning himself for what we know of him. Today, as in olden times, man cannot by searching find out God.[A] While it is true that in a certain sense the heavens declare his glory, and the firmament showeth his handiwork, and proclaim to some extent his eternal power and Godhead, yet nothing absolutely definite with respect of God may be learned from those works of nature. I will narrow the field still more, and say that such conceptions of God as we entertain must be in harmony with the doctrines of the New Testament on this subject; for accepting as we do, the New Testament as the word of God--at least, as part of it--any modern revelation which we may claim to possess must be in harmony with that revelation. Consequently, on this occasion, all we have to do is to consider the New Testament doctrine with reference to the Godhead. This, I believe, will simplify our task.  [Footnote A: Job ii:7.]  Start we then with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. It is to be observed in passing that Jesus himself came with no abstract definition of God. Nowhere in his teachings can you find any argument about the existence of God. That he takes for granted; assumes as true; and from that basis proceeds as a teacher of men. Nay more; he claims God as his Father. It is not necessary to quote texts in proof of this statement; the New Testament is replete with declarations of that character. What may be of more importance for us at the present moment is to call attention to the fact that God himself also acknowledged the relationship which Jesus claimed. Most emphatically did he do so on the memorable occasion of the baptism of Jesus in the river Jordan. You remember how the"]]]
