This spirit is the Spirit of God, and nothing less; and the Spirit of God is the spirit of revelation, because it is expressly declared that the spirit takes of the things of God, and shows them unto men: even the deep things of God are searched out and dispensed to men for their comfort and the illumination of their minds. Hence Jesus declared that he would send them another \"comforter,\" even the spirit of truth; and the office of this spirit of truth was to \"lead into all truth.\" By this means we perceive that the universal store-house of all truth is thrown open and rendered available to such as have been properly baptized into the spirit, as their occasion may demand. Even the apostles were forbid to go out and preach until they were endowed with the gift of the Holy Ghost. After they should receive this gift, it would then become their duty to impart it unto all others freely, by the imposition of hands, who should obey the gospel. Males and females were to partake of it, and see in vision things to come, and have their remembrance of things past quickened into vivid and unambiguous recollection.  It was this spirit of revelation that gave to the primitive church the power of godliness; for it was simply the Holy Spirit of God that rendered the gospel the power of God unto salvation to them that believed; for therein was the righteousness of God _revealed_ from faith to faith. The gospel never took any effect upon men's hearts, unless the Spirit of God attended it. Whenever God takes away from the church the spirit of revelation, he thereby takes away the light of the church--the good spirit of the church, and the _truth_ and integrity of the church, and the comfort of the church, and also the power of it. It becomes like the branch without sap, or the pale mortal corpse without the living spirit.  A church that is built upon the principle of revelation by the Holy Spirit can never be prevailed against while that spirit continues with it. It then becomes the power of God personified. Mere men and women--servants and handmaidens--attended by the Holy Spirit of God, know about men and things, and matters and events, even as God knows; because they have precisely the same spirit that God has. Things that never entered the heart of man to conceive, and things that the tongue could never utter, are revealed by the Spirit of God. As bodily eyes are to the corporal organization (causing all that wide difference that exists between him that sees and one that is wholly blind) so are the eyes of intelligence which the Spirit imparts to a believer, whereby he comprehends the different spirits of men from time to time, and sees events in the future as though they were actually and presently at hand. The daughters of Philip can speak prophetically, with as much unerring certainty as God himself, according to the measure of the spirit given them, because they have His Spirit, and consequently a given measure of intelligence. And the scope of this increase of intelligence is expanded or diminished as God pleases to suit the occasion.  When there is occasion to prophecy, or speak with new tongues, or interpret, or rebuke diseases and cast out evil spirits--His Spirit is given. And it could be given as well to a beast as to a man for the same purpose, and the same effect would follow. The beast of Balaam, when inspired of God, rose immediately above his legitimate sphere of action, and spoke with a man's voice, forbidding the madness of the prophet. The same spirit by which he spoke, would have enabled the dumb ass to rebuke disease, cast out devils, or speak a variety of tongues. But God might withdraw that spirit, and he would then be only a dumb ass, fit only to bear burdens, &c. Men are but little more competent to heal the sick, cast out devils, and discern spirits, or know the things of God or eternity, and make preparations for the future, than the beasts, without the Spirit of God. When God wants to punish a generation or generations, he does it effectually by withholding His Spirit. The world travels in pain, and groans in bondage, and oppression, and cruelty, and strife, and bloodshed, and in ignorance, superstition, and zeal without knowledge, when God shuts out the light of revelation. The revelations given to the primitive age, bear about the same relation of benefit to the people of this age, that the gift of food and manna, to those starving in former ages, bears towards the supply of such as are in want now. Jesus Christ winds up his sermon on the mount, by calling him a WISE man that hears and obeys the voice of revelation, and _he_ shall never \"fall.\" At the same time he calls him that hears and obeys not the voice of revelation a FOOL, and such a man will _fall_, and his fall will be great.  We cannot be in any doubt what is meant by the expression \"hearing\" Christ, or \"these sayings of mine.\" Jesus says to such servants as he sends out to preach, (and none but such as are sent by revelation can preach), he that heareth YOU heareth ME. But while they cannot hear without a preacher, neither can they hear _with_ a preacher, except the Father draw them; or, in other words, except they have the Spirit of God, which is a spirit of _revelation_. How could Peter know Jesus, when he heard his conversation and preaching? Jesus testifies that, by the wisdom of flesh and blood, Peter did _not_ know him, but by the spirit of revelation from God out of heaven; and in order to end all controversy throughout all ages, he declares that not only Peter, but NO OTHER MAN, ever _did_ or ever _can_ know God, only as he is revealed to him from heaven; and that man is \"blessed\" that has the spirit of revelation to know the only true God and Jesus Christ. That man is accounted as a thief and a robber that would know God or Jesus without the spirit of revelation.  The Spirit of God was sent into the world for the express purpose of acquainting men with Jesus Christ. By this spirit it was an easy matter for men to know Jesus Christ, though he was everywhere spoken against, and the whole country teemed with lies, and the great mass of people, reputedly good as well as bad, thought that he ought to be _stoned, mobbed, and crucified_: still it was easy to know him by the spirit of revelation, and it was impossible to know him without that spirit. Thus, dear sir, it is easy for you, and all my former associates in the sectarian ministry, to know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord, sent to prune the Lord's vineyard for the last time.  Says the scripture, \"no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, can call Jesus accursed,\" although he \"hung upon a tree.\" And I add, sir, with perfect assurance, that no man can call Joseph Smith \"accursed,\" or an \"impostor,\" while speaking by the Spirit of God; for the Spirit of God will never dictate any one to speak against the servant of God; but the spirit of the world and of Satan, _will_ stir up men to speak against prophets and saints, and persecute and assassinate them. The scripture also says, that no man can call Jesus Lord, but by the HOLY GHOST. Thus, reverend sir, you perceive that NO MAN, in former ages or latter ages, can call Jesus Lord, but by revelation from the HOLY GHOST. It is by the person and agency of the HOLY GHOST only, that Jesus promises to be with his preachers always unto the end of the world, in order to reveal the truth unto honest hearers, and show them who are prophets and true ministers of Christ, and also what is true doctrine. The HOLY GHOST will always attend a true minister of God, and reveal to his humble honest hearers, his mission and authority beyond all reasonable doubt.  Now, sir, let me say, distinctly, that the testimony of any number of men, or of all men together, is no proof either _for_ or _against_ the authority, doctrine, or mission of a prophet or true minister of God. For if no _one_ man can know a minister of God without revelation, then no large body of men can know him; and surely they cannot testify of what they do not KNOW. No matter what is said against Joseph Smith, or who, or how many, say it, or however _credible_ the witnesses, they are not competent to testify, because they have not the gift of revelation. This position, sir, is invincible, because it is fortified by the voice of eternal truth, even the word of God, which you profess publicly to believe, and preach, and print. Flesh and blood cannot reveal spiritual things, but our Father in heaven. The things of the spirit require the same spirit to discern them. He that is spiritual can judge all things, while he that has not the spirit of revelation cannot judge any spiritual matters correctly, of any name or nature.  Now, my dear friend, I close this second epistle, praying that God will give you the spirit of understanding, which I assure you He will do, inasmuch as you are humble and contrite, and seek it with all your heart.  Your obedient servant,  ORSON SPENCER.    LETTER III.  ON FAITH.  _Liverpool, June_ 1, 1847.  Reverend and Dear Sir,--The next subject to which I will invite your careful consideration, is that of FAITH.  Do not be surprised that I should attempt the investigation of a subject so common-place, with the view of imparting any new or useful instruction. The numerous elaborate treatises that have heretofore been bestowed upon this subject, have, I boldly aver, been like Goliath's armour against David--massive and imposing, but, at the same time, alike inapplicable and ineffectual to the case at issue.  In order that you may be apprised of my position, without needless circumlocution, I here distinctly observe, that there neither "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],["title","Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#7)"],["body","is, nor ever was, any gospel or saving faith, in former or latter days, but the faith of miracles, or the faith of _immediate revelation_. Can any man know God without faith? Certainly not. The gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation. To whom? To the unbelieving? No! but to them that have _faith_. The gospel of Christ is, then, brought only to such as have faith. But what faith are they to have in order to receive it? The answer, is the faith of immediate revelation, or of the supernatural agency of the Holy Spirit.  Now, sir, I ask you to listen a moment, and hear what the voice of God says to you and me on this subject. The righteousness of God is _revealed_ from FAITH to FAITH. Here, it is conceived, my position is invincibly fortified beyond the power of rational conquest. God's righteous will is _revealed_ to FAITH. It is written, \"The just shall live by faith.\" By what faith shall the just live? Surely, nothing less than the faith of immediate revelation. The fact that God's will was _revealed_ to the faith of the Saints anciently, does not supersede the necessity of his will being _revealed_ to your faith and to my faith now.  The ancients could not _believe_ for us; or, in other words, their faith could not be a substitute for our faith. \"He that believeth not,\" for himself, \"shall be damned.\" Neither could a revelation to them be necessarily a _revelation_ to us. A revelation to Noah to build an ark, is not suited to Abraham, or Peter, or Francis Wayland, or Dr. Chalmers. No man, in this day, can know that God ever revealed himself to Noah, or Abraham, unless it is now revealed to him from heaven; and he cannot know that it is revealed from heaven to him now, unless he has faith unto himself before God; and this faith which he must exercise for himself, is the faith of _revelation_, or the faith of miracles.  What ailed the Judaic churches in Christ's day? They certainly believed on Moses and Abraham, and made habitual sacrifices in support of their faith. Paul was a bright example of sincerity and fidelity in support of the Judaic faith. He verily thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. But was the faith of Paul, and of the Judaic church generally, the faith of immediate revelation or the faith of miracles? By no means. Paul originally, and his associates in the ministry, believed the Mosaic scriptures from tradition and education, and not from immediate revelation. They, indeed, believed that Abraham, and Moses, and Samuel, and Noah, had the faith of miracles, and enjoyed _immediate revelation_, and the spirit of prophecy, &c. They believed that such an high order of faith as prevailed in the Mosaic and prophetic days was no longer necessary. (But, afterwards, Paul concedes that one in his own state was one in ignorance and unbelief.)  Hence the spirit of prophecy, spoken of by Joel, as poured out in the apostolic day, was, in their estimation uncalled for. They supposed the canon of scripture was sufficiently full, when the prophet Malachi finished his testimony, and closed up the age of miracles! Men may sincerely believe the Bible, as many of the sects do believe it, without having it revealed from heaven that the Bible is true, and it will never save them. They may believe the Bible even without knowing God; for the simple reason, that no man can know God without God reveals himself to him. This was the condition of the Judaic church. Many of them sincerely believed the Mosaic writings, but detested and rejected the principle of immediate revelation, by which alone they could know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he had sent. If they had believed heartily in the doctrine of immediate revelation to all believers, in all ages, they would have known Jesus Christ to be the Messiah, as well as Moses, or Abraham, who saw his day, and was glad. On the same principle, dear sir. Christian denominations, in this day, believe the apostolic scriptures sincerely, and do many things accordingly; but rejecting the principle of immediate revelation to them-ward, they neither know Jesus Christ nor his prophet Joseph, nor the power of God, as it is revealed from faith to faith in our day.  We, sir, contend for the faith of miracles in our own day; but you and your associates contend against it. The disciples of Jesus contended for it, in their day; but the professed followers of Moses and Abraham contended against it. Now, sir, to which of these sides do you belong? Can you find that any people, who ever contended against the faith of immediate revelation and miracles, such as was maintained by Samuel, Abraham, Barak, Daniel, and Noah, ever prospered. Is there a single instance in scripture, from Genesis to Revelations, where God manifests any fellowship for any faith short of a faith of miracles and immediate revelation? If an inferior kind of faith has been got up since the New Testament age, is it not well to inquire from whence it has sprung, and what is the scriptural basis of its support? If such an inferior faith is not _revealed_ from heaven, it must certainly be from beneath, and, consequently earthly, and sensual, and devilish. If it springs from the precepts of men, and not from the direct and positive revelation of God, it ought surely to be abandoned and forsaken at once. When men believe the Old and New Testament scriptures from tradition, and the lips of a ministry that is not sent out and called by immediate revelation from heaven, their faith is dead; and all such as float in this broad stream of traditionary faith, are not and cannot be built up as lively stones to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God.  Hence, sir, the concession of Mr. C. G. Finney, and Nettleton, and of your own Mr. Knapp, all great Revivalists, and talented and devout men, that the \"sectarian churches need to be converted over again.\" And I am constrained to add, without any inviduous feelings, that such teachers themselves need to be converted from a traditionary faith into the same faith with the ancient worthies spoken of in the eleventh chapter to the Hebrews. They themselves cannot _know_ God without that same ancient faith that secured to its possessors revelation from God, and the power of working miracles, &c. God has never called men to testify to the truth of the Old and New Testament, unless the truth has been revealed to them _personally_ from the heavens. When it is thus revealed, they will obey like the ancient saints, and the power of godliness will follow their faith, \"even healing the sick, casting out devils, and speaking with new tongues.\"  You, sir, will surely admit, that the faith of the ancients was far superior to modern traditionary faith, and was attended with a power which this latter faith cannot, in its very nature, ever attain to. By the ancient faith, or faith of immediate revelation, men wrought righteousness, subdued kingdoms, stopped the mouths of lions, and quenched the violence of fire--stayed the sun in the firmament--sealed up the heavens as brass for the space of three years and a half, or opened the windows thereof for the rain to descend in showers or torrents, even to a universal deluge. Surely it will be no disparagement to such exalted names as yours, and that of my old acquaintance President Barnas Sears, and my former instructor President E. Knott, to turn, like Paul, to the banner and standard of such a faith. By such a faith they are prepared to work the works of God; and either in time or eternity, to work even far greater works than Jesus ever wrought on the earth, as his own word declares; for, sir, this kind of faith shall abide beyond the veil; for God himself made the world by faith, and the spirits of the just work by faith, and obtain revelation from God, and minister the same to militant believers on earth, from the faith of the sanctified in light, to the faith of the militant here below. \"The righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith.\" Surely we may count all things but loss for the excellency of the _knowledge_ of Christ Jesus our Lord; for he that gets the knowledge of Christ by revelation to himself, and keeps it, shall never fall.  Do you not preach, sir, the ancient faith spoken of in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, for modern believers to imitate? Or is the miraculous faith of the ancients to be pourtrayed to men in this day, only as a beautiful picture to be admired by spectators, and not copied and imitated as a doctrine of modern practice? If there is such a thing as _common_ faith, in distinction from the supernatural and miraculous faith, named in the eleventh of Hebrews, what part of the scriptures teach it? Please to name the chapter and verse; and when you have pointed out to me the specific scriptures that teach a faith inferior to that of prophecying or working miracles, &c., please to tell me wherein lies the power of such a faith? If it cannot reveal any thing to the children of men, how can it increase the sum of knowledge with any reasonable prospect of filling the earth with knowledge, as the waters cover the bed of the great deep? If it cannot forecast events beyond the mere common prescience of human minds, how can the wise man foresee the evil in time to hide himself? Is it not passing strange, sir, that from Adam to Noah, and from Noah to Abraham, and from Abraham to David, and from David to Malachi, and from John the Baptist to John the Revelator, the miraculous faith should be tenaciously and rigorously contended for; while since that day, men, professing godliness, not only contend for an inferior faith, but contend against the antiquated faith that was sustained for more than four thousand years, giving to God a great and glorious name for all his wonderful works and mighty deeds.  Why do the modern clergy commend the faith that put to flight the armies of the aliens--quenched the violence of fire--and staggered not at promises that required supernatural agency to"]]]
