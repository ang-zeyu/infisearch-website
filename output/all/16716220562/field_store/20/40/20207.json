She admitted that it was in his power to ruin her, as far as money went. \"Perhaps a little farther,\" said Pericles; \"say two steps.  If one is on a precipice, two steps count for something.\"  But, what had she done? Pericles refused to declare it.  This set her guessing with a charming naivete.  Pericles called Irma back to assist her in the task, and quitted them that they might consult together and hit upon the right thing.  His object was to send his valet for Luigi Saracco.  He had seen that no truth could be extracted from these women, save forcibly. Unaware that he had gone out, Wilfrid listened long enough to hear Irma say, between sobs: \"Oh! I shall throw myself upon his mercy.  Oh, Countess d'Isorella, why did you lead me to think of vengeance!  I am lost!  He knows everything.  Oh, what is it to me whether she lives with her husband!  Let them go on plotting.  I am not the Government.  I am sure I don't much dislike her.  Yes, I hate her, but why should I hurt myself?  She will wear those jewels on her forehead; she will wear that necklace with the big amethysts, and pretend she's humble because she doesn't carry earrings, when her ears have never been pierced!  I am lost!  Yes, you may say, lookup!  I am only a poor singer, and he can ruin me.  Oh!  Countess d'Isorella, oh!  what a fearful punishment.  If Countess Anna should betray Count Ammiani to-night, nothing, nothing, will save me.  I will confess.  Let us both be beforehand with her--or you, it does not matter for a noble lady.\"  \"Hush!\" said Violetta.  \"What dreadful fool is this I sit with?  You may have done what you think of doing already.\"  She walked to the staircase door, and to that of the suite.  An honourable sentiment, conjoined to the knowledge that he had heard sufficient, induced Wilfrid to pass on into the sleeping apartment a moment or so before Violetta took this precaution.  The potent liquor of Pericles had deprived him of consecutive ideas; he sat nursing a thunder in his head, imagining it to be profound thought, till Pericles flung the door open.  Violetta and Irma had departed.  \"Behold!  I have it; ze address of your rogue Barto Rizzo,\" said Pericles, in the manner of one whose triumph is absolutely due to his own shrewdness.  \"Are two women a match for me?  Now, my friend, you shall see.  Barto Rizzo is too clever for zis government, which cannot catch him.  I catch him, and I teach him he may touch politics--it is not for him to touch Art.  What! to hound men to interrupt her while she sings in public places?  What next!  But I knew my Countess d'Isorella could help me, and so I sent for her to confront Irma, and dare to say she knew not Barto's dwelling--and why? I will tell you a secret.  A long-flattered woman, my friend, she has had, you will think, enough of it; no! she is like avarice.  If it is worship of swine, she cannot refuse it.  Barto Rizzo worships her; so it is a deduction--she knows his abode--I act upon that, and I arrive at my end.  I now send him to ze devil.\"  Barto Rizzo, after having evaded the polizia of the city during a three months' steady chase, was effectually captured on the doorstep of Vittoria's house in the Corso Francesco, by gendarmes whom Pericles had set on his track.  A day later Vittoria was stabbed at about the same hour, on the same spot.  A woman dealt the blow.  Vittoria was returning from an afternoon drive with Laura Piaveni and the children.  She saw a woman seated on the steps as beggarwomen sit, face in lap.  Anxious to shield her from the lacquey, she sent the two little ones up to her with small bits of money.  But, as the woman would not lift her head, she and Laura prepared to pass her, Laura coming last.  The blow, like all such unexpected incidents, had the effect of lightning on those present; the woman might have escaped, but after she had struck she sat down impassive as a cat by the hearth, with a round-eyed stare.  The news that Vittoria had been assassinated traversed the city.  Carlo was in Turin, Merthyr in Rome.  Pericles was one of the first who reached the house; he was coming out when Wilfrid and the Duchess of Graatli drove up; and he accused the Countess d'Isorella flatly of having instigated the murder.  He was frantic.  They supposed that she must have succumbed to the wound.  The duchess sent for Laura.  There was a press of carriages and soft-humming people in the street; many women and men sobbing.  Wilfrid had to wait an hour for the duchess, who brought comfort when she came.  Her first words were reassuring.  \"Ah!\"  she said, \"did I not do well to make you drive here with me instead of with Lena?  Those eyes of yours would be unpardonable to her.  Yes, indeed; though a corpse were lying in this house; but Countess Alessandra is safe.  I have seen her.  I have held her hand.\"  Wilfrid kissed the duchess's hand passionately.  What she had said of Lena was true: Lena could only be generous upon the after-thought; and when the duchess drove Wilfrid back to her, he had to submit to hear scorn: and indignation against all Italians, who were denounced as cut-throats, and worse and worse and worse, males and females alike.  This way grounded on her sympathy for Vittoria.  But Wilfrid now felt toward the Italians through his remembrance of that devoted soul's love of them, and with one direct look he bade his betrothed good-bye, and they parted.  It was in the early days of March that Merthyr, then among the Republicans of Rome, heard from Laura Piaveni.  Two letters reached him, one telling of the attempted assassination, and a second explaining circumstances connected with it.  The first summoned him to Milan; the other left it to his option to make the journey.  He started, carrying kind messages from the Chief to Vittoria, and from Luciano Ramara the offer of a renewal of old friendship to Count Ammiani.  His political object was to persuade the Lombard youth to turn their whole strength upon Rome.  The desire of his heart was again to see her, who had been so nearly lost to all eyes for ever.  Laura's first letter stated brief facts.  \"She was stabbed this afternoon, at half-past two, on the steps of her house, by a woman called the wife of Barto Rizzo.  She caught her hands up under her throat when she saw the dagger.  Her right arm was penetrated just above the wrist, and half-an-inch in the left breast, close to the centre bone.  She behaved firmly.  The assassin only struck once.  No visible danger; but you should come, if you have no serious work.\"  \"Happily,\" ran the subsequent letter, of two days' later date, \"the assassin was a woman, and one effort exhausts a woman; she struck only once, and became idiotic.  Sandra has no fever.  She had her wits ready --where were mine?--when she received the wound.  While I had her in my arms, she gave orders that the woman should be driven out of the city in her carriage.  The Greek, her mad musical adorer, accuses Countess d'Isorella.  Carlo has seen this person--returns convinced of her innocence.  That is not an accepted proof; but we have one.  It seems that Rizzo (Sandra was secret about it and about one or two other things) sent to her commanding her to appoint an hour detestable style!  I can see it now; I fear these conspiracies no longer:--she did appoint an hour; and was awaiting him when the gendarmes sprang on the man at her door.  \"He had evaded them several weeks, so we are to fancy that his wife charged Countess Alessandra with the betrayal.  This appears a reasonable and simple way of accounting for the deed.  So I only partly give credit to it.  But it may be true.  \"The wound has not produced a shock to her system--very, very fortunately.  On the whole, a better thing could not have happened. Should I be more explicit?  Yes, to you; for you are not of those who see too much in what is barely said.  The wound, then, my dear good friend, has healed another wound, of which I knew nothing.  Bergamasc and Brescian friends of her husband's, have imagined that she interrupted or diverted his studies.  He also discovered that she had an opinion of her own, and sometimes he consulted it; but alas! they are lovers, and he knew not when love listened, or she when love spoke; and there was grave business to be done meanwhile.  Can you kindly allow that the case was open to a little confusion?  I know that you will.  He had to hear many violent reproaches from his fellow-students.  These have ceased.  I send this letter on the chance of the first being lost on the road; and it will supplement the first pleasantly to you in any event.  She lies here in the room where I write, propped on high pillows, the right arm bound up, and says: 'Tell Merthyr I prayed to be in Rome with my husband, and him, and the Chief.  Tell him I love my friend.  Tell him I think he deserves to be in Rome.  Tell him--'  Enter Countess Ammiani to reprove her for endangering the hopes of the house by fatiguing herself.  Sandra sends a blush at me, and I smile, and the countess kisses her.  I send you a literal transcript of one short scene, so that you may feel at home with us.  \"There is a place called Venice, and there is a place called Rome, and both places are pretty places and famous places; and there is a thing called the fashion; and these pretty places and famous places set the fashion: and there is a place called Milan, and a place called Bergamo, and a place called Brescia, and they all want to follow the fashion, for they are giddy-pated baggages.  What is the fashion, mama?  The fashion, my dear, is &c.  &c.  &c.:--Extract of lecture to my little daughter, Amalia, who says she forgets you; but Giacomo sends his manly love.  Oh, good God! should I have blood in my lips when I kissed him, if I knew that he was old enough to go out with a sword in his hand a week hence? I seem every day to be growing more and more all mother.  This month in front of us is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4442"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 8 (#4)"],["body","of thunder.  Addio!\"  When Merthyr stood in sight of Milan an army was issuing from the gates.     CHAPTER XLI  THE INTERVIEW  Merthyr saw Laura first.  He thought that Vittoria must be lying on her couch: but Laura simply figured her arm in a sling, and signified, more than said, that Vittoria was well and taking the air.  She then begged hungrily for news of Rome, and again of Rome, and sat with her hands clasped in her lap to listen.  She mentioned Venice in a short breath of praise, as if her spirit could not repose there.  Rome, its hospitals, its municipal arrangements, the names of the triumvirs, the prospects of the city, the edicts, the aspects of the streets, the popularity of the Government, the number of volunteers ranked under the magical Republic-- of these things Merthyr talked, at her continual instigation, till, stopping abruptly, he asked her if she wished to divert him from any painful subject.  \"No, no!\" she cried, \"it's only that I want to feel an anchor.  We are all adrift.  Sandra is in perfect health.  Our bodies, dear Merthyr, are enjoying the perfection of comfort.  Nothing is done here except to keep us from boiling over.\"  \"Why does not Count Ammiani come to Rome?\"  said Merthyr.  \"Why are we not all in Rome?  Yes, why!  why!  We should make a carnival of our own if we were.\"  \"She would have escaped that horrible knife,\" Merthyr sighed.  \"Yes, she would have escaped that horrible knife.  But see the difference between Milan and Rome, my friend!  It was a blessed knife here.  It has given her husband back to her; it has destroyed the intrigues against her.  It seems to have been sent--I was kneeling in the cathedral this morning, and had the very image crossing my eyes--from the saints of heaven to cut the black knot.  Perhaps it may be the means of sending us to Rome.\"  Laura paused, and, looking at him, said, \"It is so utterly impossible for us women to comprehend love without folly in a man; the trait by which we recognize it!  Merthyr, you dear Englishman, you shall know everything. Do we not think a tisane a weak washy drink, when we are strong?  But we learn, when we lie with our chins up, and our ten toes like stopped organ-pipes--as Sandra says--we learn then that it means fresh health and activity, and is better than rivers of your fiery wines.  You love her, do you not?\"  The question came with great simplicity.  \"If I can give a proof of it, I am ready to answer,\" said Merthyr, in some surprise.  \"Your whole life is the proof of it.  The women of your country are intolerable to me, Merthyr: but I do see the worth of the men.  Sandra has taught me.  She can think of you, talk of you, kiss the vision of you, and still be a faithful woman in our bondage of flesh; and to us you know what a bondage it is: How can that be?  I should have asked, if I had not seen it.  Dearest, she loves her husband, and she loves you.  She has two husbands, and she turns to the husband of her spirit when that, or any, dagger strikes her bosom.  Carlo has an unripe mind.  They have been married but a little more than four months; and he reveres her and loves her.\"  .  .  .  .  Laura's voice dragged.  \"Multiply the months by thousands, we shall not make those two lives one.  It is the curse of man's education in Italy?  He can see that she has wits and courage.  He will not consent to make use of them.  You know her: she is not one to talk of these things.  She, who has both heart and judgement--she is merely a little boat tied to a big ship.  Such is their marriage.  She cannot influence him.  She is not allowed to advise him.  And she is the one who should lead the way.  And--if she did, we should now be within sight of the City.\"  Laura took his hand.  She found it moist, though his face was calm and his chest heaved regularly.  An impish form of the pity women feel for us at times moved her to say, \"Your skin is as bronzed as it was last year. Sandra spoke of it.  She compared it to a young vine-leaf.  I wonder whether girls have really an admonition of what is good for them while they are going their ways like destined machines?\"  \"Almost all men are of flesh and blood,\" said Merthyr softly.  \"I spoke of girls.\"  \"I speak of men.\"  \"Blunt--witted that I am!  Of course you did.  But do not imagine that she is not happy with her husband.  They are united firmly.\"  \"The better for her, and him, and me,\" said Merthyr.  Laura twisted an end of her scarf with fretful fingers.  \"Carlo Albert has crossed the Ticino?\"  \"Is about to do so,\" Merthyr rejoined.  \"Will Rome hold on if he is defeated?\"  \"Rome has nothing to fear on that side.\"  \"But you do not speak hopefully of Rome.\"  \"I suppose I am thinking of other matters.\"  \"You confess it!\"  The random conversation wearied him.  His foot tapped the floor.  \"Why do you say that?\"  he asked.  \"Verily, for no other reason than that I have a wicked curiosity, and that you come from Rome,\" said Laura, now perfectly frank, and believing that she had explained her enigmatical talk, if she had not furnished an excuse for it.  Merthyr came from the City which was now encircled by an irradiating halo in her imagination, and a fit of spontaneous inexplicable feminine tenderness being upon her at the moment of their meeting, she found herself on a sudden prompted to touch and probe and brood voluptuously over an unfortunate lover's feelings, supposing that they existed.  For the glory of Rome was on him, and she was at the same time angry with Carlo Ammiani.  It was the form of passion her dedicated widowhood could still be subject to in its youth; the sole one.  By this chance Merthyr learnt what nothing else would have told him.  Her tale of the attempted assassination was related with palpable indifference.  She stated the facts.  \"The woman seemed to gasp while she had her hand up; she struck with no force; and she has since been inanimate, I hear.  The doctor says that a spasm of the heart seized her when she was about to strike.  It has been shaken--I am not sure that he does not say displaced, or unseated--by some one of her black tempers. She shot Rinaldo Guidascarpi dead.  Perhaps it was that.  I am informed that she worshipped the poor boy, and has been like a trapped she-wolf since she did it.  In some way she associated our darling with Rinaldo's death, like the brute she is.  The ostensible ground for her futile bit of devilishness was that she fancied Sandra to have betrayed Barto Rizzo, her husband, into the hands of the polizia.  He wrote to the Countess Alessandra--such a letter!--a curiosity!--he must see her and cross- examine her to satisfy himself that she was a true patriot, &c.  You know the style: we neither of us like it.  Sandra was waiting to receive him when they pounced on him by the door.  Next day the woman struck at her. Decidedly a handsome woman.  She is the exact contrast to the Countess Violetta in face, in everything.  Heart-disease will certainly never affect that pretty spy!  But, mark,\" pursued Laura, warming, \"when Carlo arrived, tears, penitence, heaps of self-accusations: he had been unkind to her even on Lake Orta, where they passed their golden month; he had neglected her at Turin; he had spoken angry words in Milan; in fact, he had misused his treasure, and begged pardon;--'If you please, my poor bleeding angel, I am sorry.  But do not, I entreat, distract me with petitions of any sort, though I will perform anything earthly to satisfy you.  Be a good little boat in the wake of the big ship.  I will look over at you, and chirrup now and then to you, my dearest, when I am not engaged in piloting extraordinary.'--Very well; I do not mean to sneer at the unhappy boy, Merthyr; I love him; he was my husband's brother in arms; the sweetest lad ever seen.  He is in the season of faults.  He must command; he must be a chief; he fancies he can intrigue poor thing! It will pass.  And so will the hour to be forward to Rome.  But I call your attention to this: when he heard of the dagger--I have it from Colonel Corte, who was with him at the time in Turin--he cried out Violetta d'Isorella's name.  Why?  After he had buried his head an hour on Sandra's pillow, he went straight to Countess d'Isorella, and was absent till night.  The woman is hideous to me.  No; don't conceive that I think her Sandra's rival.  She is too jealous.  She has him in some web.  If she has not ruined him, she will.  She was under my eyes the night she heard of his marriage: I saw how she will look at seventy! Here is Carlo at the head of a plot she has prepared for him; and he has Angelo Guidascarpi, and Ugo Corte, Marco Sana, Giulio Bandinelli, and about fifty others.  They have all been kept away from Rome by that detestable ----- you object to hear bad names cast on women, Merthyr. Hear Agostino!  The poor old man comes daily to this house to persuade Carlo to lead his band to Rome.  It is so clearly Rome--Rome, where all his comrades are; where the chief stand must be made by the side of Italy's Chief.  Worst sign of all, it has been hinted semi-officially to Carlo that he may upon application be permitted to re-issue his journal. Does not that show that the Government wishes to blindfold him, and keep him here, and knows his plans?\"  Laura started up as the door opened, and Vittoria appeared leaning upon Carlo's arm.  Countess Ammiani, Countess d'Isorella, and Pericles were behind them.  Laura's children followed.  When Merthyr rose, Vittoria was smiling in Carlo's face at something that had been spoken.  She was pale, and her arm was in a sling, but there was no appearance of her being unnerved.  Merthyr waited for her recognition of him.  She turned her eyes from Carlo slowly.  The soft dull smile in them died out as it were with a throb, and then her head drooped on one shoulder, and she sank to the floor.     CHAPTER XLII  THE SHADOW ON CONSPIRACY  Merthyr left the house at Laura's whispered suggestion.  He was agitated beyond control,"]]]
