I've found that out before this. You simply CAN'T stop it.\"  \"Won't let you change your mind, eh?\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"Well, that has its advantidges, an' its disadvantiges. If your ol' umbrel hadn't been so obstinate, we could have saved that boat.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Trot briskly, \"here we are safe back again. Wasn't it jus' the--the fascinatingest ride you ever took, Cap'n?\"  \"It's pretty good fun,\" admitted Cap'n Bill. \"Beats them aeroplanes an' things all holler, 'cause it don't need any regulatin.'\"  \"If we're going to that island, we may as well start right away,\" said Button-Bright when they had safely landed.  \"All right. I'll tie on the lunch-basket,\" answered the sailor. He fastened it so it would swing underneath his own seat, and they all took their places again.  \"Ready?\" asked the boy.  \"Let 'er go, my lad.\"  \"I want to go to Sky Island,\" said Button-Bright to the umbrella, using the name Trot had given him. The umbrella started promptly. It rose higher than before, carrying the three voyagers with it, and then started straight away over the ocean.     THE ISLAND IN THE SKY  CHAPTER 4   They clung tightly to the ropes, but the breeze was with them, so after a few moments, when they became accustomed to the motion, they began to enjoy the ride immensely.  Larger and larger grew the island, and although they were headed directly toward it, the umbrella seemed to rise higher and higher into the air the farther it traveled. They had not journeyed ten minutes before they came directly over the island, and looking down they could see the forests and meadows far below them. But the umbrella kept up its rapid flight.  \"Hold on, there!\" cried Cap'n Bill. \"If it ain't keerful, the ol' thing will pass by the island.\"  \"I--I'm sure it has passed it already,\" exclaimed Trot. \"What's wrong, Button-Bright? Why don't we stop?\"  Button-Bright seemed astonished, too.  \"Perhaps I didn't say it right,\" he replied after a moment's thought. Then, looking up at the umbrella, he repeated distinctly, \"I said I wanted to go to Sky Island! Sky Island, don't you understand?\"  The umbrella swept steadily along, getting farther and farther out to sea and rising higher and higher toward the clouds.  \"Mack'rel an' herrings!\" roared Cap'n Bill, now really frightened. \"Ain't there any blamed way at all to stop her?\"  \"None that I know of,\" said Button-Bright anxiously.  \"P'raps,\" said Trot after a pause during which she tried hard to think. \"P'raps 'Sky Island' isn't the name of that island at all.\"  \"Why, we know very well it ain't the name of it,\" yelled Cap'n Bill from below. \"We jus' called it that 'cause its right name is too hard to say.\"  \"That's the whole trouble, then,\" returned Button-Bright. \"Somewhere in the world there's a real Sky Island, and having told the Magic Umbrella to take us there, it's going to do so.\"  \"Well, I declare!\" gasped the sailorman. \"Can't we land anywhere else?\"  \"Not unless you care to tumble off,\" said the boy. \"I've told the umbrella to take us to Sky Island, so that's the exact place we're bound for. I'm sorry. It was your fault for giving me the wrong name.\"  They glided along in silence for a while. The island was now far behind them, growing small in the distance. \"Where do you s'pose the real Sky Island can be?\" asked Trot presently.  \"We can't tell anything about it until we get there,\" Button-Bright answered. \"Seems to me I've heard of the Isle of Skye, but that's over in Great Britain, somewhere the other side of the world, and it isn't Sky Island, anyhow.\"  \"This miser'ble ol' umbrel is too pertic'ler,\" growled Cap'n Bill. \"It won't let you change your mind an' it goes ezzac'ly where you say.\"  \"If it didn't,\" said Trot, \"we'd never know where we were going.\"  \"We don't know now,\" said the sailor. \"One thing's certain, folks: we're gett'n' a long way from home.\"  \"And see how the clouds are rolling just above us,\" remarked the boy, who was almost as uneasy as Cap'n Bill.  \"We're in the sky, all right,\" said the girl. \"If there could be an island up here among the clouds, I'd think it was there we're going.\"  \"Couldn't there be one?\" asked Button-Bright. \"Why couldn't there be an island in the sky that would be named Sky Island?\"  \"Of course not!\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"There wouldn't be anything to hold it up, you know.\"  \"What's holding US up?\" asked Trot.  \"Magic, I guess.\"  \"Then magic might hold an island in the sky. Whee-e-e! What a black cloud!\"  It grew suddenly dark, for they were rushing through a thick cloud that rolled around them in billows. Trot felt little drops of moisture striking her face and knew her clothing was getting damp and soggy. \"It's a rain cloud,\" she said to Button-Bright, \"and it seems like an awful big one, 'cause it takes so long for us to pass through it.\"  The umbrella never hesitated a moment. It made a path through the length of the heavy, black cloud at last and carried its passengers into a misty, billowy bank of white, which seemed as soft and fleecy as a lady's veil. When this broke away, they caught sight of a majestic rainbow spanning the heavens, its gorgeous colors glinting brightly in the sun, its arch perfect and unbroken from end to end. But it was only a glimpse they had, for quickly they dove into another bank of clouds and the rainbow disappeared.  Here the clouds were not black, nor heavy, but they assumed queer shapes. Some were like huge ships, some like forest trees, and others piled themselves into semblances of turreted castles and wonderful palaces. The shapes shifted here and there continually, and the voyagers began to be bewildered by the phantoms.  \"Seems to me we're goin' down,\" called Trot.  \"Down where?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"Who knows?\" said Button-Bright. \"But we're dropping, all right.\"  It was a gradual descent. The Magic Umbrella maintained a uniform speed, swift and unfaltering, but its path through the heavens was now in the shape of an arch, as a flying arrow falls. The queer shapes of the clouds continued for some time, and once or twice Trot was a little frightened when a monstrous airy dragon passed beside them or a huge giant stood upon a peak of cloud and stared savagely at the intruders into his domain. But none of these fanciful, vapory creatures seemed inclined to molest them or to interfere with their flight, and after a while the umbrella dipped below this queer cloudland and entered a clear space where the sky was of an exquisite blue color.  \"Oh, look!\" called Cap'n Bill. \"There's land below us.\" The boy and girl leaned over and tried to see this land, but Cap'n Bill was also leaning over, and his big body hid all that was just underneath them.  \"Is it an island?\" asked Trot solemnly.  \"Seems so,\" the old sailor replied. \"The blue is around all one side of it an' a pink sunshine around the other side. There's a big cloud just over the middle, but I guess it's surely an island, Trot, an' bein' as it's in the sky, it's likely to be Sky Island.\"  \"Then we shall land there,\" said the boy confidently. \"I knew the umbrella wouldn't make a mistake.\"  Presently Cap'n Bill spoke again. \"We're goin' down on the blue part o' the island,\" he said. \"I can see trees an' ponds an' houses. Hold tight, Trot! Hold tight, Butt'n-Bright! I'm afeared we're a'goin' to bump somethin'!\"  They were certainly dropping very quickly now, and the rush of air made their eyes fill with water so that they could not see much below them. Suddenly, the basket that was dangling below Cap'n Bill struck something with a loud thud, and this was followed by a yell of anger. Cap'n Bill sat flat upon the ground, landing with such a force that jarred the sailorman and made his teeth click together, while down upon him came the seat that Trot and Button-Bright occupied, so that for a moment they were all tangled up.  \"Get off from me! Get off from my feet, I say!\" cried an excited voice. \"What in the Sky do you mean by sitting on my feet? Get off! Get off at once!\"     THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES  CHAPTER 5   Cap'n Bill suspected that these remarks were addressed to him, but he couldn't move just then because the seat was across him, and a boy and girl were sprawling on the seat. As the Magic Umbrella was now as motionless as any ordinary umbrella might be, Button-Bright first released the catch and closed it up, after which he unhooked the crooked handle from the rope and rose to his feet. Trot had managed by this time to stand up, and she pulled the board off from Cap'n Bill. All this time the shrill, excited voice was loudly complaining because the sailor was on his feet, and Trot looked to see who was making the protest, while Cap'n Bill rolled over and got on his hands and knees so he could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position, which wasn't a very easy thing to do.  Button-Bright and Trot were staring with all their might at the queerest person they had ever seen. They decided it must be a man because he had two long legs, a body as round as a ball, a neck like an ostrich, and a comical little head set on the top of it. But the most curious thing about him was his skin, which was of a lovely sky-blue tint. His eyes were also sky-blue, and his hair, which was trained straight up and ended in a curl at the top of his head, was likewise blue in color and matched his skin and his eyes. He wore tight-fitting clothes made of sky-blue silk, with a broad blue ruffle around his long neck, and on his breast glittered a magnificent jewel in the form of a star, set with splendid blue stones.  If the blue man astonished the travelers, they were no less surprised by his surroundings, for look where they might, everything they beheld was of the same blue color as the sky above. They seemed to have landed in a large garden, surrounded by a high wall of blue stone. The trees"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4356"],["title","Sky Island (#5)"],["body","all blue, the grass was blue, the flowers were blue, and even the pebbles in the paths were blue. There were many handsomely carved benches and seats of blue wood scattered about the garden, and near them stood a fountain made of blue marble, which shot lovely sprays of blue water into the blue air.  But the angry inhabitants of this blue place would not permit them to look around them in peace, for as soon as Cap'n Bill rolled off his toes, he began dancing around in an excited way and saying very disrespectful things of his visitors. \"You brutes! You apes! You miserable, white-skinned creatures! How dare you come into my garden and knock me on the head with that awful basket and then fall on my toes and cause me pain and suffering? How dare you, I say? Don't you know you will be punished for your impudence? Don't you know the Boolooroo of the Blues will have revenge? I can have you patched for this insult, and I will--just as sure as I'm the Royal Boolooroo of Sky Island!\"  \"Oh, is this Sky Island, then?\" asked Trot.  \"Of course it's Sky Island. What else could it be? And I'm its Ruler, its King, its sole Royal Potentate and Dictator. Behold in the Personage you have injured the Mighty Quitey Righty Boolooroo of the Blues!\" Here he strutted around in a very pompous manner and wagged his little head contemptuously at them.  \"Glad to meet you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I allus had a likin' for kings, bein' as they're summat unusual. Please 'scuse me for a-sittin' on your royal toes, not knowin' as your toes were there.\"  \"I won't excuse you!\" roared the Boolooroo. \"But I'll punish you. You may depend upon that.\"  \"Seems to me,\" said Trot, \"you're actin' rather imperlite to strangers. If anyone comes to our country to visit us, we always treat 'em decent.\"  \"YOUR country!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo, looking at them more carefully and seeming interested in their appearance. \"Where in the Sky did you come from, then, and where is your country located?\"  \"We live on the Earth when we're at home,\" replied the girl.  \"The Earth? Nonsense! I've heard of the Earth, my child, but it isn't inhabited. No one can live there because it's just a round, cold, barren ball of mud and water,\" declared the Blueskin.  \"Oh, you're wrong about that,\" said Button-Bright.  \"You surely are,\" added Cap'n Bill.  \"Why, we live there ourselves,\" cried Trot.  \"I don't believe it. I believe you are living in Sky Island, where you have no right to be, with your horrid white skins. And you've intruded into the private garden of the palace of the Greatly Stately Irately Boolooroo, which is a criminal offense. And you've bumped my head with your basket and smashed my toes with your boards and bodies, which is a crime unparalleled in all the history of Sky Island! Aren't you sorry for yourselves?\"  \"I'm sorry for you,\" replied Trot, \"'cause you don't seem to know the proper way to treat visitors. But we won't stay long. We'll go home pretty soon.\"  \"Not until you have been punished!\" exclaimed the Boolooroo sternly. \"You are my prisoners.\"  \"Beg parding, your Majesty,\" said Cap'n Bill, \"but you're takin' a good deal for granted. We've tried to be friendly and peaceable, an' we've 'poligized for hurtin' you, but if that don't satisfy you, you'll have to make the most of it. You may be the Boolooroo of the Blues, but you ain't even a tin whistle to us, an' you can't skeer us for half a minute. I'm an ol' man, myself, but if you don't behave, I'll spank you like I would a baby, an' it won't be any trouble at all to do it, thank'e. As a matter o' fact, we've captured your whole bloomin' blue island, but we don't like the place very much, and I guess we'll give it back. It gives us the blues, don't it, Trot? So as soon as we eat a bite of lunch from our basket, we'll sail away again.\"  \"Sail away? How?\" asked the Boolooroo.  \"With the Magic Umbrel,\" said Cap'n Bill, pointing to the umbrella that Button-Bright was holding underneath his arm.  \"Oh, ho! I see, I see,\" said the Boolooroo, nodding his funny head. \"Go ahead, then, and eat your lunch.\"  He retreated a little way to a marble seat beside the fountain, but watched the strangers carefully. Cap'n Bill, feeling sure he had won the argument, whispered to the boy and girl that they must eat and get away as soon as possible, as this might prove a dangerous country for them to remain in. Trot longed to see more of the strange blue island, and especially wanted to explore the magnificent blue palace that adjoined the garden and which had six hundred tall towers and turrets; but she felt that her old friend was wise in advising them to get away quickly. So she opened the basket, and they all three sat in a row on a stone bench and began to eat sandwiches and cake and pickles and cheese and all the good things that were packed in the lunch basket.  They were hungry from the long ride, and while they ate they kept their eyes busily employed in examining all the queer things around them. The Boolooroo seemed quite the queerest of anything, and Trot noticed that when he pulled the long curl that stuck up from the top of his head, a bell tinkled somewhere in the palace. He next pulled at the bottom of his right ear, and another faraway bell tinkled; then he touched the end of his nose, and still another bell was faintly heard. The Boolooroo said not a word while he was ringing the bells, and Trot wondered if that was the way he amused himself. But now the frown died away from his face and was replaced with a look of satisfaction.  \"Have you nearly finished?\" he inquired.  \"No,\" said Trot, \"we've got to eat our apples yet.\"  \"Apples? Apples? What are apples?\" he asked.  Trot took some from the basket. \"Have one?\" she said. \"They're awful good.\"  The Boolooroo advanced a step and took the apple, which he regarded with much curiosity.  \"Guess they don't grow anywhere but on the Earth,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.  \"Are they good to eat?\" asked the Boolooroo.  \"Try it and see,\" answered Trot, biting into an apple herself.  The Blueskin sat down on the end of their bench, next to Button-Bright, and began to eat his apple. He seemed to like it, for he finished it in a hurry, and when it was gone he picked up the Magic Umbrella.  \"Let that alone!\" said Button-Bright, making a grab for it. But the Boolooroo jerked it away in an instant, and standing up he held the umbrella behind him and laughed aloud.  \"Now then,\" said he, \"you can't get away until I'm willing to let you go. You are my prisoners.\"  \"I guess not,\" returned Cap'n Bill, and reaching out one of his long arms, the sailorman suddenly grasped the Boolooroo around his long, thin neck and shook him until his whole body fluttered like a flag. \"Drop that umbrel. Drop it!\" yelled Cap'n Bill, and the Boolooroo quickly obeyed. The Magic Umbrella fell to the ground, and Button-Bright promptly seized it. Then the sailor let go his hold and the King staggered to a seat, choking and coughing to get his breath back.  \"I told you to let things alone,\" growled Cap'n Bill. \"If you don't behave, your Majesty, this Blue Island'll have to get another Boolooroo.\"  \"Why?\" asked the Blueskin.  \"Because I'll prob'ly spoil you for a king, an' mebbe for anything else. Anyhow, you'll get badly damaged if you try to interfere with us, an' that's a fact.\"  \"Don't kill him, Cap'n Bill,\" said Trot cheerfully.  \"Kill me? Why, he couldn't do that,\" observed the King, who was trying to rearrange the ruffle around his neck. \"Nothing can kill me.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"Because I haven't lived my six hundred years yet. Perhaps you don't know that every Blueskin in Sky Island lives exactly six hundred years from the time he is born.\"  \"No, I didn't know that,\" admitted the sailor.  \"It's a fact,\" said the King. \"Nothing can kill us until we've lived to the last day of our appointed lives. When the final minute is up, we die; but we're obliged to live all of the six hundred years whether we want to or not. So you needn't think of trying to kill anybody on Sky Island. It can't be done.\"  \"Never mind,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I'm no murderer, thank goodness, and I wouldn't kill you if I could, much as you deserve it.\"  \"But isn't six hundred years an awful long time to live?\" questioned Trot.  \"It seems like it at first,\" replied the King, \"but I notice that whenever any of my subjects get near the end of their six hundred, they grow nervous and say the life is altogether too short.\"  \"How long have you lived?\" asked Button-Bright.  The King coughed again and turned a bit bluer. \"That is considered an impertinent question in Sky Island,\" he answered, \"but I will say that every Boolooroo is elected to reign three hundred years, and I've reigned not quite--ahem!--two hundred.\"  \"Are your kings elected, then?\" asked Cap'n Bill.  \"Yes, of course. This is a Republic, you know. The people elect all their officers from the King down. Every man and every woman is a voter. The Boolooroo tells them whom to vote for, and if they don't obey, they are severely punished. It's a fine system of government, and the only thing I object to is electing the Boolooroo for only three hundred years. It ought to be for life. My successor has already been elected, but he can't reign for a hundred years to come.\"  \"I think three hundred years is plenty long enough,\" said Trot. \"It gives someone else a chance to rule, an' I wouldn't be s'prised if the next king is a better one. Seems to me you're not much of a Boolooroo.\"  \"That,\" replied the King indignantly, \"is a matter of opinion. I like myself very much, but I can't expect you to like me, because you're deformed and ignorant.\"  \"I'm not!\" cried Trot.  \"Yes, you are. Your legs are too short and your neck is nothing at all. Your color is most peculiar, but there isn't a shade of blue about any of you, except the deep-blue color of the clothes the old ape that choked me wears. Also, you are ignorant because you know nothing of Sky Island, which is the Center of the"]]]
