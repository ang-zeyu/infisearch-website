The enemy's outposts had been driven in, but beyond these, their fortified places bristled with machine guns, which wrought havoc on our troops, and, indeed, brought the successful offensive to a close. Controversy has arisen over the disappointing results which were achieved.  For a month after the battle, Neuve Chapelle was heralded by the public as a great British victory.  But doubt followed confidence, and in a few weeks the \"victory\" was described as a failure.  The truth lies between these extremes.  The object of this battle of Neuve Chapelle was to give our men a new spirit of offensive and to test the British fighting machine which had been built up with so much difficulty on the Western front.  Besides, if this attack succeeded in destroying the German lines, it would be possible to gain the Aubers ridge which dominates Lille.  That ridge once firmly held in our hands, the city should have been ours.  That would have been a great victory.  It would probably have meant the end of the German occupation of this part of France.  In any case it must have had a marked effect upon the whole progress of the war.[1]  That was what we hoped to do.  What we actually accomplished was the winning of about a mile of territory along a three-mile front, and the straightening of our line.  The price was too high for the result.  It was the first great effort ever made by the British to pierce the German line since it had been established after the open field battles of the Marne and the Aisne.  The British troops had faced the German lines for months, and while the fundamental principles of the German defences were fairly well understood, their real strength was very much underrated.  Things went badly from the beginning of the action.  The artillery \"preparation\" represented quite the most formidable bombardment the British had so far made, but even so, it was ineffective along certain sections of the line.  After the way had been paved by shrapnel and high explosive, the British infantry moved forward in a splendid offensive to secure what everyone believed would be a decisive victory; and trained observers of the battle were under the impression that the gallant British infantry had won their end.  This is an impression, too, which was shared by some of the men for a time.  For many months the British had been almost entirely on the defensive, and over and over again been called on to repulse heavy, massed German attacks.  The casualties sustained in repulsing these attacks first revealed our shortage of machine-guns.  What they lacked in machine-guns, however, the British troops made up for in a deadly accuracy of rifle fire, which was at once the terror and the admiration of the Germans.  The British had thus come to an exaggerated idea of the efficacy of rifle fire, and a consequent over-estimate of the importance of the German first line trenches.  Over these they swarmed, and the word went forth that the day was won.  It was only when the British troops had occupied the enemy's first and second line trenches, they discovered that, in actual fact, they had not done more than drive in the outposts of an army.  Close at hand, the Germans' third line loomed up like a succession of closely interlocked citadels.  Nay, more, those citadels were so constructed that the trenches from which our men had ousted the enemy with so much heroism and loss were deathtraps for the new tenants.  The circumstances were such that to retire meant acknowledgment of failure, and to hang on, a grisly slaughter.  Even so, there were features of the situation which made for hope. There were positions to be won which would very seriously jeopardise the whole German scheme of defence; but, at the critical moment of the battle, the advanced troops seem to have passed beyond the control of the various commanders in the rear on account of the misty weather.  The real tragedy, however, was the non-arrival of the supports at a point and at a time when the appearance of reserves might have made all the difference to the fortunes of the day.  The enemy was still bewildered and demoralised, and, but for the delay, might have been completely routed.  Unfortunately, the British front was in great need of straightening out.  The 23rd Brigade continued to hang up the 8th Division, while the 25th Brigade was fighting along a portion of the front where it was not supposed to be at all.  Units had to be disentangled and the whole line straightened before further advance could be made.  The fatal result was a delay which, Sir John French says, would never have occurred had the \"clearly expressed orders of the General Officer commanding the 1st Army been more carefully observed.\"  Sir Douglas Haig himself hurried up to set things right, but it was then too late to retrieve the failure which had been occasioned by delay.  The attack was thoroughly exhausted, its sting was gone, and the enemy had pulled himself together.  Night was falling, and there was nothing to be done but \"dig in\" beneath the ridge above Lille, the capture of which would have altered the whole story of the campaign on the Western front.  As I have said, the Canadian infantry took no part in the battle, though the troops waited impatiently and expectantly for the order to advance, but the activity of the Canadian artillery was considerable and important.  The Canadian guns took their full share in the \"preparation\" for the subsequent British infantry attack, and the observation work of our gunners was good and continuous.  After Neuve Chapelle, quiet reigned along the Canadian trenches, though the battle raged to the north of us at St. Eloi, and the Princess Patricia's Battalion was involved.  Early in the last days of March our troops were withdrawn and retired to rest camps.  The Canadians had received their baptism of fire, and in extremely favourable circumstances.  They had not been called on to make any desperate attacks on the German lines.  Nor had the Germans launched any violent assaults upon theirs.  The infantry had sustained a few casualties, but that was all; while German artillery practice against our trenches had been curtailed on account of the violent fighting both to the south and the north.  On the other hand, we had been surrounded by all the circumstances of great battles.  We had watched the passage of the giant guns, of which the British made use for the first time at Neuve Chapelle, and we had moved and lived and stood to arms amid all the stir and accessories of vehement war.  The guns had boomed their deadly message in our ears, we had seen death in many forms, and understood to the full the meaning of \"Casualties,\" while, day by day, the aeroplanes wheeled and circled overhead, passing and re-passing to the enemy's lines.  The Canadians had come to make war, and had dwelt in the midst of it, and after their turn in the trenches many of them, no doubt, accounted themselves war-worn veterans.  Little they knew of the ordeals of the future.  Little they dreamt, when towards the middle of the month of April they were sent to take over French trenches in the Ypres salient, that they were within a week of that terrible but wonderful battle which has consecrated this little corner of Flanders for Canadian generations yet unborn.    [1] The scheme of the attack on Neuve Chapelle had been worked out by General John Gough just before he was killed, and it was explained to his Corps Commanders by Sir John French on May 8th as follows:--The 1st Army was to launch the main assault, the 4th Corps being on the left flank and the Indian Corps on the right.  To hold up the enemy all along the line, and to prevent his massing reinforcements to meet the main attack, two other supplementary attacks were also to be made--one attack by the 1st Corps from Givenchy, and the other by the 3rd Corps--detailed from the 2nd Army for that purpose--to the south of Armenti√®res.

It was not until long afterwards that it was possible to collect and collate the whole of the battalion diaries. The story, therefore, could only be compiled from the personal reports of the officers commanding units, and in some cases these were not available, and certain regiments did not therefore receive the prominence which was their due.  These regiments will, I am sure, readily understand that the omission was not intentional, but due to the impossibility of making sure of all the details of a great and confused action until months after the event.  Although the material has become available, I have decided not to attempt to rewrite the story.  It is, in its main features, absolutely accurate, and has the advantage which must belong to any narrative written within sound of the guns, and while the impressions of the battlefield are still vivid to the mind.  I am, in fact, afraid that any attempt on my part to reconstruct the narrative would spoil whatever merit it may possess.  In the first place, it is necessary, however, to make good some mistakes in the first volume which have been pointed out by persons who were engaged in various actions.  The majority of errors occur in the matter of names, which, in about a dozen cases, have been given inexactly.  In some cases it has been possible to make the requisite corrections of initials, rank, or spelling in succeeding editions.  I particularly regret the confusion between the two brothers, Sergt. L. G. Newell and Sergt. F. C. C. Newell, both of whom took part in the charge at Langemarke.  The first-named, the older brother, died of his wounds after that attack, while the second and younger recovered, returned to the trenches, and won the D.C.M. at Givenchy.  With reference to the names of regiments concerned in the Second Battle of Ypres, the King's Own Royal Leinsters have been named by a misprint instead of the King's Own Royal Lancashires, as part of Colonel Geddes' command, on page 56.  King Edward's Horse should have the prefix 2nd throughout.  I offer my very sincere apologies to both regiments.  As to the position of various units, it is stated on page 74 of Vol. I. that Lieut.-Col. Watson, of the 2nd, was employed with his regiment on a dangerous digging operation to connect a weak point in the line on the night of April 28th, 1915.  It should have been added that the entire 1st Brigade took part in this, the 2nd Battalion being on the left, the 3rd in the centre, and the 1st on the right, the 4th Battalion digging in the meanwhile a support trench close in rear.  The omission of the description of the part played by the 5th Battalion (Colonel Tuxford) in the Second Battle of Ypres was a serious one, but this is dealt with in the course of the next few pages.  The only serious accusation of inaccuracy in the tactical survey of any situation is preferred by those who maintain that the sketch of the action at Festubert is wrong or misleading.  I have communicated with Colonel J. E. Leckie, of the 16th Battalion, who, as a major, took a prominent part in the assault and succeeded to the command of the regiment, when his brother, Brigadier-General R. G. E. Leckie, was promoted to a brigade.  He assures me that the sketch of the two positions occupied by the Canadians in their successive attacks is quite accurate, and, in fact, it is so.  None the less, it is easy to see how the idea that there was an error originated.  In an attempt to secure largeness of scale in the map, the area is unduly limited in its scope.  The position from which the Canadians attacked is not given, and the extent to which the Germans were forced back is only just indicated.  In consequence, the words \"First Canadian Position\" might be held to imply that this was the line from which they sallied forth instead of the first position they occupied before they advanced to the final attack on the orchard.  It is a misfortune if the plan underestimates the ground won by the 14th and 15th.  No further serious errors have been suggested so far as Vol. I. is concerned.  Mistakes will no doubt be discovered in the second volume.  They will be found, however, to apply to the misspelling of the names of individuals and to an occasional mistake or doubt as to the precise position of a particular unit on a certain date, and not, I hope, to any main question of the tactics or strategy of battle.  The contemporary historian cannot hope to avoid these errors.  He has at his disposal neither the leisure nor the information of the writer of after years.  He must take his information as it comes to him and trust that rough justice is done, believing that his honest misjudgments will be cleared up when the full history comes to be written.  In the meantime, he may hope to supply material of value for subsequent examination and use.  But for this final judgment we may have to wait some years.  In the confusion and isolation of a modern battle men are acutely aware of their own experiences, and can have little knowledge of what is passing to the right or left, while the staff behind have the same difficulty in discovering what is happening on their front.  In these circumstances, the eye-witnesses themselves often disagree.  Even the historians of the past have not infrequently made mistakes and waged with the pen as fierce battles over stricken fields as were ever fought by the opposing hosts with the sword.  There is, of course, one easy way out of these troubles; it is to have no immediate record, but to await the official publications of after time.  The Dominion Government has, and I think rightly, declared against this policy.  It has been from the start in favour of publicity so long as there was no danger to national interests.  It has not concurred in the suppression of the deeds of regiments or individuals, believing that in a democratic country the greatest stimulus to exertion is the knowledge that one is known and approved by one's fellow-citizens.  Its eye-witness accounts, therefore, set in many respects the tone for similar publications, and it has adopted the same liberal view in authorising a contemporary story.  In another respect, the Dominion Government has been wise.  Enormous sums were spent after the American Civil War in collecting the official records.  The units had been disbanded and the witnesses scattered to civilian pursuits all over the country, and the inquiry was in consequence laborious and expensive.  The Dominion Government, warned by this example, have taken prompt measures to secure from day to day and week to week full reports of the movements and actions of all units, at a cost which is trifling compared with what it would cost in after years; in this way the framework has been erected for an official narrative.  This is a prudent measure which will be endorsed by Canadian students of history, since there is a growing tendency to demand a full and intelligent documentary record of our progress.  All the officers of the Canadian Corps have in one respect or another contributed to the collection of these facts, and have done so often in the face of grave danger and complete exhaustion, when they might well have been excused from troubling about such trivialities as to what posterity would think about them.  The members of the Record Officer's Staff have been unwearied in collecting all the available material, and this common sense of duty has laid the foundation of our records on a substantial basis of fact.  For all mistakes which occur, and more particularly for the omissions, I, as Record Officer, take full responsibility, for the Record Officer is no more exempt than others from the fog of battle.  But I would point out that my task would be rendered less difficult, and the chances of error or injustice diminished, if the commanders of units would supply exhaustive diaries and reports on all occasions of importance.  I have particularly in my mind's eye the case of Brigadier-General (then Lieut.-Col.) Tuxford, of the 5th Battalion, who with his regiment conducted a most heroic defence of the extreme right of the position during the Second Battle of Ypres.  His regiment was, in fact, the pivot of the retirement, and, had it given way, very few of the 1st Division would have come back to tell the tale.  The General is well known as a man of action and a brilliant soldier, and is perhaps, therefore, though well qualified to write, little disposed to do so, and so it was long after the stress and confusion of the great conflict that I became fully aware of the part that he and his regiment had taken.  Yet his defence of the Gravenstafel Ridge was a great feat of arms, well worthy of the 7th Division, the Household Cavalry, and the Guards Brigade, who had fought up and down that bloodstained soil against overwhelming odds in the autumn of 1914.  I hope to make all mistakes good in some final edition of \"Canada in Flanders\"; if not, posterity will vindicate any who have been wronged by accident.  But in return for such confessions as I have made, I would give one word of warning to the critics.  The original twelve battalions have become an army corps, and if one division or another happens to find itself involved in a great battle, it is not unnatural that the attention of the public should be concentrated on its achievements, failures, or losses, even though the others are doing their work equally well.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, the turn of each division comes, and the 1st is known by Ypres, the 2nd by St. Eloi, and the 3rd by Sanctuary Wood.  There is enough glory and"]]]
