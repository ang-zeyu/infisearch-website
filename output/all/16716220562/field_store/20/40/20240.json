Better tell him, better tell him ...  \"Side street ... go side street.\"  Dennison obeyed automatically.  Zinc and Chuck bawled at each other.  \"Get shells ready ... ready, Chuck...\"  Swinging roundabout, they caught the pillbox from an angle: its cannon was futile, just a rod of steel: methodically, Chuck trained his 75; his first shell overshot but the second crushed the concrete dome; the third shell, aimed low, burst open a side.  Machinegun triggered, visors wide opened, Landel accounted for the crew, his blood boiling:  He was yelling, whistling, screaming.  Barbed wire fenced the box and Dennison smashed it, treads burying the spirals, the port tread crushing remains of the pill box.  Thinking of the canteen, he got it and sopped his handkerchief: water, face, water, the turret flung open, now he could breathe. Water, a little more water ... there was plenty of water!  As they sped onto a highway the surface seemed annoyingly, deceptively smooth: probably mined.  Watch it, boy!  \"Mined?\" he asked Landel.  \"Safe,\" Landel reported, doubting their luck.  He had sopped his head and underneath the open turret, his face shone like an Inca ceremonial head: a scratch under one eye was bleeding; his naked shoulders were soaked; he leaned against the side of his seat, mouth gaping ...  He hated the day, hated the bad luck, hated losing Millard.  He called himself a fool for permitting his men to crowd about the fountain. Should have known, should have.  It was Dennison’s fault for not reconnoitering.  Give him hell tonight.  Tonight ... well, they’d be midway to Ghat.  The swaying tank, the roaring treads made him clamp his eyes.  Someone was yapping on the radio.  On the road, beside a bombed truck, lay a crippled GI.  The fellow raised his arms--appeared to see the oncoming tank--but Dennison could not avoid him without crashing off the highway. He had no chance to diminish his speed and zoom aside since they were clocking forty. Dennison’s nerves buckled, his spine stiffened, his throat contracted painfully, his hands shook: the Sherman raced over the man in a flash and yet Dennison saw him die--could see him underneath the treads--felt him gasp, heard him scream.  \"Jesus Christ ... I killed him ... I killed one of our guys ... Jesus Christ...\"  Sun was beating through the turret, stabbing the desert.  Desert heat swirled with engine heat.  If the highway is mined!  Landel was using his periscope.  The viewer showed an even expanse.  Souped-up, they were hitting sixty.  Was it riskier to cross a mine at top speed?  What would the explosion do, heel then over, crumble a tread, stove in the floor, belch out the walls?   ... In the white walled house, the Arab, in the yellow-blue turban, was opening the shutters to his windows ... did he sell dates?  In Texas, while piloting his training tank, he had thought of the rags and litter on the ground as the bodies of men.  Excellent imagination. Useless.  Absurd.  Such thinking had not hardened him.  It was just another kind of fear.  Another kind of folly. His hands were still trembling.  Nothing had prepared him for the first dead in Africa, that first week in Africa, when men got crushed underneath his treads: then it had seemed to him that he had crushed them himself, mashed then with his own weight.  He had dreamed then, for many nights, of arms and hands struggling against pressure, faces blotted into nothingness.  He had longed to climb out of his machine, kill himself, go, go somewhere.  And now?  Beramet appeared on the road ahead ... palm trees, white one-story buildings, olive trees, tamarisk.  Through radio transmission he knew that their tank forces were pincering: the town was to be grabbed by nightfall.  Light shimmered in front, misty pools of it, mirage water, the desert--port and starboard--was undulating with heat and light: heat, combining a scab of dust, wavered over Beramet: a single point, a blue minaret, broke through.  An MP slowed Dennison: standing beside his motorcycle, black glasses over his eyes, tropic hat slapped down low, he seemed a little insane as he swatted at flies.  The dust on his cycle matched the dust on his fatigues.  Dust was approaching, trailing from a stream of converging trucks, half-tracks, tanks, cars, and ambulances.  Dully, Orville stared at his compass ... so this was Beramet? Where, in Beramet, would they stop, climb out, rest?  In a few minutes the compass began quivering: they were in the thick of street fighting, Arabs dodging from house to house, Nazis firing from doorways, windows, firing machine guns, firing rifles.  GI’s opened a front.  A grenade exploded.  Sand gushed up. Another grenade forced sand through the visors and ports of the bus.  Both Dennison and Landel coughed violently.  Dennison leaned forward, his back soaked, his arms soaked, the cushion behind him clumsy, lumped.  Urine sloshed across the floor.  He forced his brain above the shaking tank and roar of fighting. Hell, how lunatic, self-preservation and fear clawing each other. Eyes on the street havoc, he moved his machine as directed. Sometimes he saw Arabs firing, sometimes Nazis, sometimes smoke blotted everything.  Something crumbled and fell through dust.  Blinding sunlight took over as the Sherman crept forward.  Gradually through radio communications, through signals with Landel, he became aware that the Beramet probe was almost over ... now he noticed that his hand was scratched and he licked the scratch absently, groggily.  It seemed to him that it was some other person’s hand.  It seemed to him he was very old (these had been days not hours): in this world there was only pain and everyone hoped to die.  In this world there was the torture of sound being tortured. Following a deserted street, he observed death at the next corner, sitting on an oil drum.  He snarled at himself for having joined the Corps, for having thrown in his lot with Landel.  A concentration camp would have been better.  Time could never obliterate these memories.  The brain was permanently wounded.  He tried but could not tap the future: he was too exhausted, too hot--as Landel ordered \"stop\" Dennison doubled over, craving water: he wanted to lie down in water: he wanted to die.  That night, sleeping in the open, death woke him.  He woke shaking, remembering, half-remembering ...  On Sunday, eleven tanks and two half-tracks were compelled to halt because of gas shortage: they squirmed into a wadi below a hundred meter red cliff topped by a single dead tree, an acacia that had been dead and stark for fifty years or more.  Crewmen called the place \"the dam\" although there had been no water there for many seasons.  The dam was a low, concrete wall that crossed the wadi.  Its concrete apron bedded a few of the Shermans.  Landel, hoping the cliff might afford some protection, had suggested they make a halt until supply tanks and trucks could catch up.  Flies were everywhere: they were inside the tanks; they were outside on the treads, guns and turrets--on weeds, rocks, sand. They zoomed into food the crews tried to eat.  They crept over hands and faces and necks as men tried to work.  They bit.  Singly and by the dozens, they came from below, from above, left, right, and flew into eyes, ears, mouth. Men slapped at them, swore at them, shouted at them.  They crawled over K-rations.  Dennison and Zinc, sharing rations, sprawled below the cliff, troubled by the flies.  Zinc poured cold coffee from a thermos. With a rag over his face, Dennison was determined to rest as long as possible, doze perhaps.  He felt himself drift perhaps ten minutes: how long he never knew.  A bomb hurled him, dragged him through gravel and sand.  Through a torn spot in the rag he saw the tree on top of the cliff fall; he heard rocks and gravel avalanche onto the tanks, rocks and then a dribble of sand.  A second bomber flew over but dropped no bombs.  In a kind of back-flash, he recognized that the second plane was a reconnaissance plane, following their tell-tales across the desert. Like infallible radar the ruts could lead bombers to \"the dam.\" Scrambling to his feet, dropping the rag, he raced for his tank.  A plane swooped low: a black wall of sand met Dennison and spun him around; as he fell he saw the tread of a Sherman expand like a rubber band and slice a man across his waist and chest: the man did not scream. God, Dennison groaned.  Another bomb flattened Dennison: Jesus, how many did they have upstairs!  The scream of steel on steel mingled with the roar of falling rocks.  A bomb with a bent fin howled as it dropped.  He burrowed into sand to avoid hurling metal: he imagined Zinc, Chuck, Landel, dead.  Pain twisted his back.  Silence ...  Getting up, he stumbled across the gully.  He found crewmen there, crouched behind boulders and camel grass.  Somebody had spread a tarp overhead to cut down on the spray of sand.  Nobody said a word. Presently, Chuck Hitchcock came crawling, blubbering, mouth gaping: crawling on hands and knees he banged into a rock.  A blast of sand had sandpapered his eyes: lids and eyeballs were ingrained, a sand and blood inlay.  As Dennison dragged Chuck under the tarp he realized he would never see again: he tried to shield his wounded face, the man sobbing, breathing in gasps, his blond, pallid face distorted.  He won’t play billiards again, Dennison thought, remembering Chuck’s stories about billiard games at the University of Wisconsin.  A bomb crashed and a tank exploded: it seemed to leap into the air--the whole Sherman--fell into ensheathing fire.  It was visible to everyone under the tarp.  Sand fountained.  Ignited gas and oil spouted: machine gun bullets began to ricochet.  Metal whizzed past.  Another bomb exploded.  \"Let’s run for it!\" Dennison shouted.  \"Get out of here! ... get out of here!\" someone roared.  Dennison and a fellow, Jim Harrington, grabbed Chuck, and rushed him down the wadi, swaying, pitching, dragging."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44717"],["title","Forward, Children! (#7)"],["body"," began to gasp.  Chuck was sobbing.  Dennison thought every step was getting them nowhere; yet Landel appeared out of a wall of smoke, his head plastered with dirt. He slid an arm under Chuck and the three carried him into a thorn thicket out of the wadi and laid him on the sand.  \"I’m blind!\" Chuck cried.  \"I’m blind!  Help me!\"  Another bomb geysered sand: it left a fog of sand, everyone coughing and spitting.  Men tied rags or handkerchiefs or shirts over their face. So, it was sand, not flies.  The heat sweated the sand into the flesh. So, it was heat, heat coming down from the cliff.  \"Can’t see our bus\" Dennison shouted, trying to estimate damage.  He snuffed and continued coughing.  Suddenly, he grinned, and began to shake: the flies are gone, the bomb’s got rid of the flies!  He laughed loudly, throwing back his head.  \"No flies ... no flies ... the bombers killed our flies!\"  \"Shut up,\" Landel said, hitting him.  \"No flies!\"  Landel hit him again.  Dennison crumpled to the sand: he knew what Landel meant: he realized too, in spite of his hysteria, that he was lucky to have escaped: cradling his head on his arms he attempted to blot out Chuck’s raving.  With the last bomber gone, the crewmen came to life, swatting off sand and dust, huddling, at first in little groups.  In twos and threes they began checking, climbing on their machines, crawling inside.  Out of nowhere supply trucks arrived.  \"Gas,\" the men said.  \"Gas.\"  Zinc pointed to some butterflies, flying close to the sand, headed past the Shermans.  Dennison rubbed his face: they can really fly: yellow butterflies ... beyond them, in the face of the sun, the heat puffed and writhed; a slight wind kicked up dust.  A section of the wadi cliff had toppled and sand had buried snouts and sides of several machines and both half-tracks: the sand had acted as a cushion protecting treads and armor plate.  Men began to dig ... gas tanks got filled ... motors started ... tanks pulled away ...  Dennison led Chuck by the arm, Chuck moaning and trembling. They both fell into a sand hollow.  Directly in front of Dennison lay a pair of arms, intact from finger to shoulders, the dog tag visible on the wrist, above the greasy fingers.  _Lawrence_, Dennison saw:  Lawrence Robinson, from California.  Dennison jumped away, shrank back, dragging Chuck, almost hurling him down, bumping into Landel.  \"What’s wrong with you?\" Landel scoffed.  \"Watch where you’re going!  A pair of kooky arms scare ya!\"  Without hesitating, Dennison whirled on Landel, and knocked him down: he tried to jump on him but Chuck clung to him, moaning, saying \"no ... no...\"  \"Jeez, man!\" Landel gulped.  \"Are you nuts again?\"  \"That was Lawrence Robinson,\" Dennison yelled.  \"Larry Robinson ... it could have been me!\"  \"Fuck you,\" said Landel, picking himself up, remembering a corner of the Argonne, where men’s bodies had been blown about like chips.  Glaring at Chuck’s bloody eyes he felt no pity for him: he felt they should save themselves for their machines and the job of fighting: let scabs go to hell!  But remembering his job as captain he ordered Dennison to take Chuck to Corporal Willits ...  \"He’s over there ... he’s Red Cross ... take him, then let’s get our bus rolling.  He’s not been hit.  Not bad!\"  \"Not bad,\" Dennison said to himself, angrily.  He saw himself returning to Base Camp with Chuck; he would see him hospitalized; on leave, he would rest by the ocean; ships would be unloading; the surf would be warm; he’d have good chow.  Assisting Chuck, Dennison sat down by him as Willets examined the lidless eyes: in the sun the imbedded sand glistened like glass; blood glistened like glass.  Chuck was trembling, his hands quivering on his lap, fingers wholly uncoordinated.  Willets was talking kindly to Chuck.  \"Can you hear?\" Dennison asked, bending close.  \"No.\"  \"Willits is looking after you ... he’s from the Medical Corps...\"  \"Who?\"  \"Willits.\"  \"He a doctor?\"  \"Medical Corps.\"  \"Where am I?\"  \"By a half-track ... there are wounded here ... Willits and Cobb are helping the men ... we’ll be moving out of this gully...\"  \"Don’t go, Dennison.\"  \"Can you move your head ... to the side? ... I want to put medication in your eyes,\" said Willits.  \"Okay.\"  \"The stuff won’t hurt.\"  \"Okay.\"  \"Hold still.\"  \"Light me a cigarette, Dennison.\"  \"Sure...\"  Dennison began fumbling through his clothes, expecting his cigarettes to be shredded; the pack was badly squashed but he straightened a cigarette, lit it, and put it in Chuck’s mouth.  Chuck drew a puff or two and then pain doubled him up as smoke trailed across his eyes; the cigarette dropped to the sand; rolling his head from side to side, he groaned, and flailed his arms.  \"My eyes ... my eyes!\"  \"Keep your hands off them!\" Willits ordered.  \"Are they so bad?\"  \"Yeah ... they’re bad--keep your hands down...\"  The wind shook a dwarf thorn tree behind him.  \"Lift your head up ... higher ... I’m using more medication ... soothing...\"  \"Can ya gimmie a drink?\"  \"I will,\" said Dennison.  Willits was a dark skinned man, very Italian, with greying moustache and grey animal-kind eyes.  When Dennison returned with water, he nodded at him, jerked his head toward Chuck, then shrugged his shoulders: hopeless.  \"Now you keep your hands off your eyes ... I’m gonna put cool antiseptic salve on a bandage, real loose ... gonna put that around your head ... over your eyes ... we’ll get you to a doctor soon as we can ... I’ll use the transmitter ... others ... other guys ... you know ... get help ... they need help...\"  Groggily, he went on repeating, talking to himself.  Chuck was still shaking as Dennison walked away--back to his machine.  He and Zinc removed shovels from the rear of the tank: it was slow digging but they released a tread, cleaned the hatches, freed the guns: Landel had a shovel: there was no Al, no Millard, no Chuck: climbing inside Dennison switched on lights, checked dials, checked the intercom and radio: something about the white interior helped.  Switching on the transmitter he shouted:  \"Dennison calling ... Lieutenant Dennison calling ... calling X2B ... calling X2B ... Dennison reporting for Fred Landel ... M4-221 reporting ... bombers caught us at point L-T ... place we call \"The Dam\" ... tanks badly damaged ... several wounded ... one man dead ... can you send medics?  Dennison calling ... can you hear me?...\"  A little of the horror abated: there was promise in the lights around him, in the transmitter, the old seat cushion, the thermos on the floor, the gleam of dials: with the earphones over his ears he waited.  The radio spluttered:  \"X2B ... we read you ... roger ... we’ve got you on the maps ... news has been coming in ... we know your conditions ... medical help enroute ... tanks moving forward ... medical help coming ... tanks coming ... pass on the word ... over...\"  Climbing out of the tank, into the dying day, Dennison notified officers and crewmen.  Enjoying a smoke he perched on the rear of his bus: crews were shoveling sand away from the tanks, bedding treads with tarp and gravel.  A star specked the horizon. For an instant, for several minutes, he contemplated the ancientness and greatness of this continent: perhaps some of that greatness could resurrect mankind.  How absurd the steel hulks, primitive without claiming any antiquity, primordial because of weight and shape.  Yet their hellish threats were not absurd.  They had crawled into sand as if it was their birthplace, as if returning home after millennia.  After dusk, after the takeover of the sky, tanks, trucks and halftracks arrived: there were two makeshift ambulances, a corps of medics: \"the dam\" became an encampment, a black-in of men and steel.  Dennison, at the door of the ambulance, did his best to break through to Chuck who was lying beside an unconscious GI.  It seemed to Chuck, as he fought his pain and depression, he was losing his best friend: everything was out of proportion as he talked to Dennison.  \" ... sure ... sure ... and you know there’s my sister in London. You’ve got to meet her ... somehow you’ve got to meet her.  She’s, she’s pretty ... was the prettiest girl in Racine ... She’s stationed at Red Cross ... Dalton Station ... Red Cross ... Dalton ... remember ... if you are ever in London on leave ... remember ... Jeannette...\"  The roof lights in the ambulance blinked off.  The chauffeur said: we’re shovin’ off.  \"Here ... take her pic ... her photo from my billfold ... here ... tell her I sent you ... take it ... you can find her ... send me word when I’m at Hopkins ... tell me ... find her...\"  \"Good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye.\"  London, Dennison thought, as he shovelled away more sand: I’ll never see London again.  Perspiration made his hands slip on the shovel handle. He and Zinc were digging by lantern light, their shadows mugging each other: arms, heads, legs, shovels, machine. They were able to hear the hissing sound of sand.  Nearby someone revved a motor.  In the light of a tank, Jeannette’s photo showed a beautiful woman. Slipping it into his billfold he called her his pinup.  \"Hell ... I’m hungry,\" he said to Zinc.  \"There’s chow,\" said Zinc.  \"I saw the truck ... yeah, there’s chow,\" he repeated, rubbing his beard.  \"We gotta get some sleep ... gotta sit ... rest.\"  He was trying to rub away intestinal pain with his right hand: he had strained muscles as he helped load wounded into the ambulances. Somebody had given him a sticky candy bar, he could still taste it; maybe it would stay down.  \"Chuck’s had it ... he’s lost his sight ... he’s...\"  He went on mumbling to himself.  He and Dennison had located Robinson by flash.  Dennison had brought his arms and placed them across his mutilated body, on a stretcher in a converted supply tank.  Robinson’s ID fell beside the tank and Zinc brushed off sand and stuck it inside Robinson’s torn shirt and buttoned the shirt over the crushed leather.  \"Well, he doesn’t have to be buried here,\""]]]
