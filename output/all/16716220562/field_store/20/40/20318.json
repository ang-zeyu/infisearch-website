Mariners had been afraid to traverse the seas far beyond the sight of land. Shortly before the end of this century there came one navigator more daring than his fellows, who proposed to cross the sea. After many pleadings and attempts to interest some one with means in the venture, he finally succeeded and the remarkable feat was done. In accomplishing this he made discoveries that the Lord, in his wisdom, had kept hid from the nations of the east all down through the ages, until in his own due time he desired them to be revealed. Columbus was moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord and crossed the waters in fulfilment of predictions made by a prophet, who lived on this continent, five hundred years before the birth of Christ.  The \"Reformation\"  All these things played an important part in the establishment of individual and religious freedom. The most important agency of all in this great work was doubtless the so-called \"Reformation,\" which was in fact a revolution from the bondage of the church of Rome. Great men of intellectual power began to undermine the thraldom of the religious world. This rebellion against the dominion of Rome was almost simultaneous in the various lands. In England, Scandinavia, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany, many \"reformers\" arose near the end of the fifteenth and during the sixteenth century. They were of varying degrees of enthusiasm and opposition to the teachings of that time. In the beginning their only desire was to correct evils within the Catholic Church, but failing in this many of them openly rebelled and set up independent churches of their own.  Martin Luther  The greatest of these \"reformers\" was Martin Luther in Germany, who did more than any other individual in casting off the yoke of bondage placed upon the people by the papacy. Powerful princes came to his aid, but there was not in Germany at that time the cohesion of the people, or the centralization of power, that existed in England under Henry VIII, or in Sweden, where Gustavus Vasa reigned. Luther's task, therefore, was a heavy one, but he nobly carried it through to the bitter end.  The Protestant Revolution a Preparatory Work  Their mission was not, however, to set up the Church or Christ, for the time was not ripe, and that important event was reserved for another generation. They were called to be forerunners of that eventful day, and did much to prepare the world for the ushering in of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times. The Lord did not call them to their great work by an opening of the heavens; by visitation of angel, or direct communication, as in times of old; neither did any of them claim that in this manner they had been called. Nevertheless it was the Spirit of the Lord which rested upon them and inspired them to fight against the abominations and practices of their times committed in the name of religion. Such, at least, was the case with most of them. The motive of Henry VIII of England, was a selfish one; yet the Lord brought good out of it in behalf of religious freedom. At first Henry opposed the rebellion of Luther and others most vigorously, even writing in defense of the pope of Rome, for which service he received the benediction of the pope and the title of \"Defender of the Faith.\" Afterwards, when his own interests where in conflict with the policy of the Catholic Church and in no wise he could prevail, he became rebellious, with the result that he was excommunicated by the pope. In defense he established an independent church, known today as the Church of England, of which he became the head. Parliament and the people were back of him and thus the great state church of England was brought into being.  Disagreement Among \"Reformers\"  The pity of it all is that these \"reformers\" when they established their religious freedom, could not agree among themselves. They were constantly in turmoil, contending one with another on points of doctrine, which led to considerable bitterness and the establishing of various and conflicting sects. Moreover, they had not learned the lesson themselves, through all the persecutions they were forced to suffer, that toleration was a fundamental principle of freedom. Because this great lesson had not been learned the persecuted became the persecutors in many cases, and were just as intolerant where they had the power with those who disagreed with them as their enemies had been with them.  America a Land of Freedom  Nevertheless the seeds of toleration had been sown, but they were of slow growth. Toleration was a matter of education and therefore came by degrees and could not burst forth in full fruition at once. Not until there had been much shedding of blood in Europe, and more particularly in America during the war for independence, were the people fully awakened to this truth. It required a planting in new soil in a choice land above all other lands. Here in America freedom and religious toleration became a fundamental part of our great government. Our land became a land of refuge for the afflicted, the downtrodden, and the oppressed of other nations, who found in the United States a haven of rest; for this land had been dedicated to liberty by the shedding of blood.  Praise be to the great souls who conducted the Protestant Revolution. They helped to make it possible for the establishment of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the early part of the nineteenth century, preparatory to the second coming of the Son of God. For all the good they did we honor them, and they shall receive their reward which shall be great. They were not restorers, but were sent to prepare the way for one who was yet to come with a mission of restoration and everlasting power.    Part Two  Opening of the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times    Chapter 4  Necessity for a Restoration  The Marvelous Work  The work of the Protestant revolution having been accomplished, and the land of America having been prepared by the sowing of the seed of religious freedom, the time for the restoration of the Gospel had arrived. The promise made by the Savior that the Gospel of the kingdom should be preached in all the world for a witness, was about to be fulfilled, and the Church of Jesus Christ was again to be established in the earth. The \"marvelous work and a wonder,\" which Isaiah predicted should come forth in the latter days, was about to make its appearance, to the confounding of the wisdom of the worldly wise.  Reasonable and Scriptural to Expect a Restoration  It is reasonable as well as scriptural, to believe that the Lord, before he shall come in judgment and to commence his reign of a thousand years, will send a messenger to prepare the way before him. In justice the people should be warned and given the privilege of repentance and remission of sins, through the preaching of the Gospel, and have an opportunity for membership in the Church of Christ. \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing,\" said Amos, \"until he revealeth the secret unto his servants the prophets.\"[1]  Ancient Predictions to be Fulfilled  Many of the ancient prophets had spoken of the opening of the heavens and revealing anew to man, the everlasting Gospel, before the second coming of the Lord. The visitation of heavenly messengers, and the pouring out of the Spirit of the Lord, in which the sons and daughters of Israel should prophesy, old men dream dreams, and the young men see visions, were also foretold as events for the latter days.  Daniel Saw Our Day  Daniel, in vision, while an exile at the court of Babylon's great king, saw our day and the work of setting up the kingdom which should be given to the Saints of the Most High, who should possess it \"even forever and forever.\" The same event he confirmed in the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the wonderfully constructed image. It was to be in the last days at a time when the kingdoms represented by the toes of the image should bear rule. In that day the God of heaven will \"set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, or left to other people.\"  Vision of John  John also saw the time when the Gospel should be declared by an angel flying in the midst of heaven \"having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\" This also was to be in the last day, when the people were departed from the teachings of the Lord, and needed a call unto repentance, for this angel was to be followed by another who should say: \"Babylon is fallen, is fallen;\" and before Babylon should fall, she was to be warned and given a chance of repentance.  Joseph Smith Divinely Called  It was necessary, therefore, that one should be chosen and clothed with power from the Father to re-establish the Church of Jesus Christ on the earth.[2] In choosing a representative to stand at the head of this \"great and marvelous work, about to come forth unto the children of men,\" the Lord did not select one who was versed in the learning and traditions of the world. His ways are not the ways of man, neither are his thoughts like the thoughts of men. One taught in the learning of the world would have had too much to unlearn of the traditions and philosophy of men. In his great wisdom, the Lord chose an unsophisticated child--a boy fourteen years of age. Unto this youth the Lord revealed the fulness of the Gospel, which the world could not receive because of unbelief. Through years of heavenly guidance--for he was instructed by messengers from the presence of the Lord--this young man, Joseph Smith, was prepared to direct the work of the restoration of the Gospel and the building of the Kingdom of God.

The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45054"],["title","Essentials in Church History (#5)"],["body","idea which prevails in the world in relation to the Church, is set forth in Smith's _Bible Dictionary_, Article--Church, vol. 1, p. 458, as follows: \"We have seen that according to the scriptural view the Church is a holy kingdom, established by God on earth, of which Christ is the invisible King--it is a divinely organized body, the members of which are knit together amongst themselves, and joined to Christ their Head, by the Holy Spirit, who dwells in and animates it; it is a spiritual but visible society of men united by constant succession to those who were personally united to the Apostles, holding the same faith that the Apostles held, administering the same sacraments, and like them forming separate, but only locally separate, assemblies, for the public worship of God. This is the Church according to the Divine intention. But as God permits men to mar the perfection of his designs in their behalf, and as men have both corrupted the doctrines and broken the unity of the Church, we must not expect to see the Church of Holy Scripture actually existing in its perfection on earth. It is not to be found, thus perfect, either in the collected fragments of Christendom, or still less in any one of these fragments; though it is possible that one of those fragments more than another may approach the scriptural and Apostolic ideal which existed only until sin, heresy, and schism, had time sufficiently to develop themselves to do their work.\"    Chapter 5  The Ancestry of Joseph Smith  1638-1805  Ancestry of Joseph Smith  Joseph Smith was born in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, December 23, 1805. He was the third son and fourth child of Joseph and Lucy Mack Smith, who had a family of ten children. His parents were of sturdy New England stock, honest, godfearing, industrious, but poor in worldly substance. Joseph Smith had descended on his paternal side from Robert Smith, who emigrated from England in the year 1638. There is no record to be found of the ancestry of Robert Smith, nor do we know at this time from what part of England he came, further than that he went in his early youth to Boston, Lincolnshire, and then to London, where he took ship for America. He landed in Boston, Massachusetts, and moved to that part of Rowley, in Essex County, which afterwards became the township of Boxford. Here, later, he purchased two hundred eight acres of land, a portion of which was in Topsfield township. He married Miss Mary French. They were the parents of ten children. Robert was known among his neighbors as a quiet, unassuming man, devoted to the welfare of the settlement. Through his industry he was able to provide some comforts for his family, who were reared in the prevailing religious teachings of that day, but strictly in the knowledge of the scriptures.  Patriotic Service of Samuel Smith  Samuel, son of Robert and Mary, was born January 26, 1666. He married Rebecca, daughter of John Curtis, a prominent citizen of the town of Topsfield. After his father's death, Samuel moved to Topsfield, where he became an influential member of that community and was honored by the citizens with several offices of trust. He was the father of nine children. His son Samuel, born January 26, 1714, was one of the most prominent citizens of Topsfield. The greater part of his life was spent in the service of the people. He passed through the stormy days of the American Revolution and bore arms in defense of the liberties of the people. Among the many positions he held are the following: He was grand juryman in 1760; in 1770, road supervisor; in 1779, 1780, 1783, 1784 and 1785, on the committee of safety; from 1771 to 1777 and in 1781 and 1782, assessor and selectman in Topsfield, declining the honor in 1783; he was moderator, in 1758-60, 1762, 1764, 1766-73, 1777-80, and 1782-83; representative to the General Court (House of Representatives) in 1764-70, 1772, 1777-78, and 1781; town clerk in 1774, 1776 and 1777; delegate to the Provincial Congress at Concord, October 11, 1774 and again January 19, 1775, and on the tea committee, from Topsfield and acted as chairman, in 1773.  He was known as Captain Samuel Smith, receiving his military title during service in the militia of Massachusetts. He married Priscilla, daughter of Zacheus Gould of Topsfield. They had five children, two sons and three daughters. The mother died shortly after the birth of her youngest child, and Samuel married a cousin of his first wife who bore the same name. He died November 22, 1785, leaving an estate valued at more than 544 pounds sterling. The Salem Gazette of November 22, 1785, made mention of him in the following words:  \"Died.--At Topsfield, on Monday, the 14th instant, Samuel Smith, Esq. So amiable and worthy a character as he evidently appeared, both in public and private, will render the memory of him ever precious. For a number of years he represented the town in the General Court, where he was esteemed a man of integrity and uprightness. His usefulness among those with whom he was more immediately conversant was eminent. He was a sincere friend to the liberties of his country, and a strenuous advocate for the doctrine of Christianity.\"  \"The memory of the Just be blessed.\"  Asael Smith Grandfather of Joseph Smith  Asael Smith was the second son and youngest child of (2) Samuel. He was born in Topsfield, March 7, 1744. His mother died, as already noted, shortly after his birth. His early life was spent in Topsfield. February 12, 1767, he took to wife, Mary Duty, of Windham, New Hampshire, and later moved to that place. From there he went to Dunbarton and then to Derryfield, now the city of Manchester. During the Revolution he followed the example of his illustrious father and served with the Colonial forces. After the death of his father in 1785, he returned to Topsfield and made his home on the family estate. He lived in the old home, about one mile north of the town, where a number of his children were born, notably Joseph, father of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  Asael was a man of very liberal views, far in advance of his time. Some of his children were members of the Congregational Church, but in his religious views he leaned towards the teachings of the Universalists. However, he held aloof from all sects, because he could not reconcile his understanding of the scriptures with their many conflicting creeds. He advocated the truth very strongly, that all men should have free and equal religious liberty. In his opinions he was frank and explicit, expressing himself without fear of the prevailing opinions of his neighbors. He was somewhat gifted with the pen and wrote some worthy sentiments which have been preserved and are still in possession of members of the family. Many years before his death he wrote a charge to his family in which the advice given could be followed with great profit by parents and children even in our day. An excerpt from this document will give an insight into the character of this man and depict his remarkable faith in Jesus Christ:  Advice of Asael Smith to His Family  \"And first to you, my dear wife,\" he wrote, \"I do with all the strength and power that is in me, thank you for your kindness and faithfulness to me, beseeching God who is the husband of the widow, to take care of you and not to leave you nor forsake you, or suffer you to leave nor forsake him, nor his ways. Put your whole trust solely in him, he never did nor never will forsake any that trust in him. . . . And now my dear children, let me pour out my heart to you and speak first of immortality in your souls. Trifle not in this point; the soul is immortal; you have to deal with an infinite Majesty; you go upon life and death, therefore in this point be serious. Do all to God in a serious manner; when you think of him, speak of him, pray to him, or in any way make your addresses to his great Majesty, be in good earnest. Trifle not with his name or with his attributes, nor call him to witness to any thing but is absolute truth, nor then, but when sound reason or serious consideration requires it. And as to religion, I would not wish to point out any particular way for you; but first I would wish you to search the scriptures and consult sound reason and see if they (which I take to be two witnesses that stand by the God of the whole earth) are not sufficient to evince to you that religion is a necessary theme. . . .  \"For the public.--Bless God that you live in a land of liberty and bear yourselves dutifully and conscionably towards the authority under which you live. See God's providence in the appointment of the Federal Constitution and hold union and order precious jewels.\"  Prediction of Asael Smith  In the spring of 1791 he moved from Topsfield to Tunbridge, Vermont, where he made his home for several years. As old age came on and his health became impaired he removed to Stockholm, St. Lawrence County, New York, and made his home with his son Silas. Here he died, October 31, 1830, at the advanced age of more than 86 years. In stature he was tall, his body was well proportioned and possessed of unusual strength. At times the spirit of inspiration rested upon him. One one occasion he said: \"It has been borne in upon my soul that one of my descendants will promulgate a work to revolutionize the world of religious faith.\" Perhaps he did not expect to live to see that day, but such proved to be the case. The first summer after the organization of the Church, his son Joseph and grandson Don Carlos Smith paid him a visit and presented him with a copy of the Book of Mormon. At the time he was in feeble health, but he diligently read the book, or most of it, and said he was convinced that the work of his grandson, Joseph Smith, was of divine origin. He was not baptized, due to his weakened physical condition, and died shortly after this visit. His wife, Mary Duty Smith, later moved to Kirtland where she died in 1836, firm in the faith of the restored Gospel.  John"]]]
