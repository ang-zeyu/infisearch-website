We haven't found the man who can match him yet on our side. But one of these days we shall do it.\"  Dastral did not reply for some time. His mind was full of the details of the recent encounter he had had with the unbeaten champion. He wondered what Himmelman thought of his own tactics which had made the air-fiend sheer off at the last moment. And he also determined that should the opportunity ever come to fight with him on equal terms he would not refuse the challenge. If it were possible the western front should be rid of this champion, and the supremacy of the air wrested from the Germans.  For the next few days Dastral and Jock remained on light duty, nursing their wounds, and taking strolls about the aerodrome near Contalmaison. The hornet had been so badly damaged that it was necessary to send to England for new parts to be supplied before it could be flown again.  At the end of a fortnight, however, they were both quite well again, and the hornet had been brought to its pristine condition. Then they took part in several reconnaissances over the enemy's lines, and in more than one bombing raid, but nothing of unusual importance happened for nearly a month, when the following incident occurred:  Dastral had just been made Flight-Commander, and so, in addition to the hornet, three other active warplanes and three brilliant pilots who were ready to follow him to the \"Gulfs,\" wherever that might be, had been placed under his command. This was the section of the Royal Flying Corps called \"B\" Flight, which was to win much fame and glory in the days of the near future. Already, Dastral, by his cool daring and skilful manoeuvring, had won a great name amongst his fellows, and some had even begun to talk of him as a possible competitor with Himmelman.  Often, after one of his more than usually brilliant raids or reconnaissances over the lines, his friends would remark of him in his absence:  \"Some day he will meet with Himmelman again, and then one of the two will never return.\"  \"What a fight that will be!\" remarked Number Nine one day, as he lit his cigar and leaned back in his comfortable fauteuil, to puff rings of smoke into the air.  \"And I hope I shall be there,\" said Mac, one of the pilots of \"B\" Flight.  \"And while Dastral fights with Himmelman, may I be there to fight with Boelke,\" added Brum to his friend Steve, both pilots belonging to \"B\" Flight.  Brum was short and sturdy, while Steve, or Inky as he was sometimes called, was tall and thin and very dark, with piercing blue-grey eyes, and they both considered Dastral the finest and fairest fighter in the British Air Service.  One day, while the great fight on the Somme was in progress, and the Allies, by their great pressure were winning village after village from the enemy, there came a mysterious message to the Command Headquarters of the ---- Division, stating that the enemy had finished the construction of three huge Zeppelin sheds not far from Brussels. Also that the same number of Zeppelins had just arrived from Friedricshaven to take possession of the sheds, evidently preparatory to a raid upon Paris or London.  The wires and despatch-riders were busy that day between the Command Headquarters and the Aerodrome. Plans were drawn up to destroy at an early date both the airships and the sheds. After some consideration, it was decided that \"B\" Flight should have the honour of carrying out the raid, and accordingly Dastral and Jock went to work at once with their maps and charts to evolve a thoroughly sound plan of campaign.  Several days later, towards evening, another coded message from the same secret service agent behind the lines came to hand by carrier pigeon, which when decoded ran something as follows:  \"Two Zeppelins just left Brussels' sheds, travelling west-nor'-west!\"  \"Send Flight-Commander Dastral to me at once,\" said the Squadron-Commander, immediately the message was read to him.  As soon as Dastral appeared the O.C., who had been pacing about his little room, turned abruptly upon the pilot, and said,  \"See this, Dastral?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the youth, scanning the brief message, which told him so much.  \"You know what it means?\"  \"It evidently means that a raid on London is imminent, and is being carried out to-night, I fancy, sir.\"  \"Exactly!\" snapped the O.C., who at such times became easily fractious and irritated.  At this moment the telephone in the C.O.'s office suddenly burst out,  \"Ting-a-ling-ling!\"  \"Yes, who's there?\" asked the Major sharply.  \"Advanced Headquarters, Fourth Army. Are you the R.F.C.?\"  \"Yes--Squadron-Commander speaking from No. 10 Aerodrome.\"  \"Right. News is just to hand by field telephone that three Zeppelins have passed overhead making for the Channel. We have wired the coast stations and the R N.A.S. to look after them, and if possible to bring them down. There is evidently a raid in progress. What do you think you can do in the matter?\" asked the officer at the other end.  \"Hold on just a few seconds, sir!\" replied the Major. Then, turning round to Dastral, he repeated the conversation briefly, and said,  \"What do you suggest?\"  \"Just this, sir,\" replied the pilot. \"Our plan to destroy the sheds is well forward, and we hoped to carry it out in three or four days. We know exactly where the place is----\"  \"Yes, yes, go on. The staff officer is waiting at the other end of the line,\" blurted out the C.O.  \"Well, sir, if you will detail me to take my flight over there, so as to be on the spot at dawn, when the airships return, we may be able to strafe the lot. At any rate, we can destroy the sheds, and a Zeppelin would be useless without its cradle, and would soon come to grief.\"  \"Good! Prepare your flight at once for the venture, and we must leave the other Squadrons and the R.N.A.S. and coast batteries to try and stop the raid.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the pilot, saluting smartly and departing on his errand.  So while the C.O. concluded his conversation with Headquarters over the 'phone, Dastral got to work at once with his flight.  While Snorty, the Aerodrome Sergeant-Major, and Yap, the rag-time \"Corporal,\" and a squad of experienced air-mechanics prepared the machines for action, the Flight-Commander got together his pilots, Mac, Steve, and Brum, with their observers, and explained every detail of the proposed campaign. Distances were carefully worked out, a prearranged code of signals agreed upon, maps and charts examined and committed as far as possible to memory, and a score of necessary details worked up, so that there should be no confusion in the method of attack.  Having spent an hour thus discussing the matter and threshing out every aspect of the question that arose, Dastral said,  \"Now then for a rendezvous, lads, for we must go singly, and come together smartly, at the precise moment, just as the dawn is breaking, which will be no easy matter.\"  \"Let it be the Lion Mound on the battlefield at Waterloo,\" suggested Mac.  \"Well, yes, that will do,\" said the Flight-Commander. \"It is only about two miles away from the sheds, which are close by the village of Braine l'Alleud.\"  \"Agreed,\" they all cried. \"It will be a landmark we shall easily find.\"  \"Then understand, all of you, that you must be there exactly as the dawn breaks, and, as soon as we pick each other up, we shall fall into regular flight formation, make a bee line for the sheds, and drop the squibs before the enemy can get to work with their Archies,\" said Dastral.  \"And the cargo, Dastral? What shall we load up with?\"  \"Six twenty-pound bombs each, with ten drums of the new machine-gun ammunition. I think that will be all we can safely take without reducing speed.\"  \"Right, sir!\"  \"And understand, boys,\" the leader went on. \"There must be no fighting on the way there, even if attacked, unless it is absolutely necessary to prevent a crash. I quite expect we may have to fight an airship or two, and possibly a patrol of Fokkers or Aviatiks, for the Zeps are sure to be escorted on their way back, if they get wind of our little game.\"  \"Agreed, sir.\"  \"And now, gentlemen, to bed, all of you. It is imperative that you should each have a good night's rest, for if any man's nerves are run down in the morning, I shall put him off,\" said Dastral seriously, and they knew he meant it, for he could be serious at times, despite his laughing blue eyes, and his apparently gay and reckless manner.  So to bed they went, for they were all tired out, and not even the promise of the morrow's venture could keep them awake, for these daring airmen had learnt the happy knack of taking sleep whenever they could get it, as soon as duty was done, and of forgetting all about their machines as well as their own wonderful exploits.  Next morning, long before dawn, Corporal Yap, humming one of his rag-time songs, went round the bunks of the officers' mess and gently called the pilots and observers one by one. Within an hour they had breakfasted and were out on the aerodrome watching the machines being wheeled out, by the aid of the hand-lamps and electric torches.  After a brief but careful final examination of every strut and wire, the machines were quite ready, all loaded up, with the machine-guns shipped, compasses aboard, etc.  \"All ready, sir!\" reported Snorty, as he came up and saluted.  \"Tumble aboard, lads!\" called Dastral, and within two minutes the pilots and observers were in their seats, and the air mechanics standing ready to swing the propellors.  \"Swish!\" went the whirling blades.  \"Stand clear!\" came next in a shrill voice.  Then away into the darkness sped the four machines. In a few seconds they were lost to sight as they taxied across the aerodrome. Then one after another they leapt into the air, and began their upward climb, leaving their friends and well-wishers behind them, craning their necks to get a last view of them as they tried to locate them in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4435"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 1 (#0)"],["body","David Widger  <widger@cecomet.net>      VITTORIA  By George Meredith    CONTENTS:  BOOK 1.

THE WARNING VII.      BARTO RIZZO VIII.     THE LETTER     CHAPTER I   From Monte Motterone you survey the Lombard plain.  It is a towering dome of green among a hundred pinnacles of grey and rust-red crags.  At dawn the summit of the mountain has an eagle eye for the far Venetian boundary and the barrier of the Apennines; but with sunrise come the mists.  The vast brown level is seen narrowing in; the Ticino and the Sesia waters, nearest, quiver on the air like sleepy lakes; the plain is engulphed up to the high ridges of the distant Southern mountain range, which lie stretched to a faint cloud-like line, in shape like a solitary monster of old seas crossing the Deluge.  Long arms of vapour stretch across the urn-like valleys, and gradually thickening and swelling upward, enwrap the scored bodies of the ashen-faced peaks and the pastures of the green mountain, till the heights become islands over a forgotten earth.  Bells of herds down the hidden run of the sweet grasses, and a continuous leaping of its rivulets, give the Motterone a voice of youth and homeliness amid that stern company of Titan-heads, for whom the hawk and the vulture cry.  The storm has beaten at them until they have got the aspect of the storm.  They take colour from sunlight, and are joyless in colour as in shade.  When the lower world is under pushing steam, they wear the look of the revolted sons of Time, fast chained before scornful heaven in an iron peace.  Day at last brings vigorous fire; arrows of light pierce the mist-wreaths, the dancing draperies, the floors of vapour; and the mountain of piled pasturages is seen with its foot on the shore of Lago Maggiore.  Down an extreme gulf the full sunlight, as if darting on a jewel in the deeps, seizes the blue-green lake with its isles.  The villages along the darkly-wooded borders of the lake show white as clustered swans; here and there a tented boat is visible, shooting from terraces of vines, or hanging on its shadow.  Monte Boscero is unveiled; the semicircle of the Piedmontese and the Swiss peaks, covering Lake Orta, behind, on along the Ticinese and the Grisons, leftward toward and beyond the Lugano hills, stand bare in black and grey and rust-red and purple.  You behold a burnished realm of mountain and plain beneath the royal sun of Italy.  In the foreground it shines hard as the lines of an irradiated Cellini shield.  Farther away, over middle ranges that are soft and clear, it melts, confusing the waters with hot rays, and the forests with darkness, to where, wavering in and out of view like flying wings, and shadowed like wings of archangels with rose and with orange and with violet, silverwhite Alps are seen.  You might take them for mystical streaming torches on the border-ground between vision and fancy.  They lean as in a great flight forward upon Lombardy.  The curtain of an early autumnal morning was everywhere lifted around the Motterone, save for one milky strip of cloud that lay lizard-like across the throat of Monte Boscero facing it, when a party of five footfarers, who had met from different points of ascent some way below, and were climbing the mountain together, stood upon the cropped herbage of the second plateau, and stopped to eye the landscape; possibly also to get their breath.  They were Italians.  Two were fair-haired muscular men, bronzed by the sun and roughly bearded, bearing the stamp of breed of one or other of the hill-cities under the Alps.  A third looked a sturdy soldier, squareset and hard of feature, for whom beauties of scenery had few awakening charms.  The remaining couple were an old man and a youth, upon whose shoulder the veteran leaned, and with a whimsical turn of head and eye, indicative of some playful cast of mind, poured out his remarks upon the objects in sight, and chuckled to himself, like one who has learnt the necessity to appreciate his own humour if he is disposed to indulge it.  He was carelessly wrapped about in long loose woollen stuff, but the youth was dressed like a Milanese cavalier of the first quality, and was evidently one who would have been at home in the fashionable Corso.  His face was of the sweetest virile Italian beauty.  The head was long, like a hawk's, not too lean, and not sharply ridged from a rapacious beak, but enough to show characteristics of eagerness and promptitude.  His eyes were darkest blue, the eyebrows and long disjoining eyelashes being very dark over them, which made their colour precious.  The nose was straight and forward from the brows; a fluent black moustache ran with the curve of the upper lip, and lost its line upon a smooth olive cheek.  The upper lip was firmly supported by the under, and the chin stood freely out from a fine neck and throat.  After a space an Austrian war-steamer was discerned puffing out of the harbour of Laveno.  \"That will do,\" said the old man.  \"Carlo, thou son of Paolo, we will stump upward once more.  Tell me, hulloa, sir! are the best peaches doomed to entertain vile, domiciliary, parasitical insects?  I ask you, does nature exhibit motherly regard, or none, for the regions of the picturesque?  None, I say.  It is an arbitrary distinction of our day. To complain of the intrusion of that black-yellow flag and foul smoke- line on the lake underneath us is preposterous, since, as you behold, the heavens make no protestation.  Let us up.  There is comfort in exercise, even for an ancient creature such as I am.  This mountain is my brother, and flatters me not--I am old.\"  \"Take my arm, dear Agostino,\" said the youth.  \"Never, my lad, until I need it.  On, ahead of me, goat! chamois!  and teach me how the thing used to be done in my time.  Old legs must be the pupils of young ones mark that piece of humility, and listen with respectfulness to an old head by-and-by.\"  It was the autumn antecedent to that memorable Spring of the great Italian uprising, when, though for a tragic issue, the people of Italy first felt and acted as a nation, and Charles Albert, called the Sword of Italy, aspired, without comprehension of the passion of patriotism by which it was animated, to lead it quietly into the fold of his Piedmontese kingship.  There is not an easier or a pleasanter height to climb than the Motterone, if, in Italian heat, you can endure the disappointment of seeing the summit, as you ascend, constantly flit away to a farther station.  It seems to throw its head back, like a laughing senior when children struggle up for kissings.  The party of five had come through the vines from Stresa and from Baveno.  The mountain was strange to them, and they had already reckoned twice on having the topmost eminence in view, when reaching it they found themselves on a fresh plateau, traversed by wild water-courses, and browsed by Alpine herds; and again the green dome was distant.  They came to the highest chalet, where a hearty wiry young fellow, busily employed in making cheese, invited them to the enjoyment of shade and fresh milk.  \"For the sake of these adolescents, who lose much and require much, let it be so,\" said Agostino gravely, and not without some belief that he consented to rest on behalf of his companions.  They allowed the young mountaineer to close the door, and sat about his fire like sagacious men.  When cooled and refreshed, Agostino gave the signal for departure, and returned thanks for hospitality.  Money was not offered and not expected.  As they were going forth the mountaineer accompanied them to the step on the threshold, and with a mysterious eagerness in his eyes, addressed Agostino.  \"Signore, is it true?--the king marches?\"  \"Who is the king, my friend?\" returned Agostino.  \"If he marches out of his dominions, the king confers a blessing on his people perchance.\"  \"Our king, signore!\"  The"]]]
