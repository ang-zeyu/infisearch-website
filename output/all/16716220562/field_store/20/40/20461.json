The clergyman seemed satisfied by the answer, and presently added that it would be well, if Master and Mistress Talbot meant to adopt the child, that she should be baptized.  \"How now?\" said Richard, \"we are not so near any coast of Turks or Infidels that we should deem her sprung of heathen folk.\"  \"Assuredly not,\" said Cuthbert Langston, whose quick, light-coloured eyes had spied the reliquary in Mistress Susan's work-basket, \"if this belongs to her.  By your leave, kinswoman,\" and he lifted it in his hand with evident veneration, and began examining it.  \"It is Babylonish gold, an accursed thing!\" exclaimed Master Heatherthwayte.  \"Beware, Master Talbot, and cast it from thee.\"  \"Nay,\" said Richard, \"that shall I not do.  It may lead to the discovery of the child's kindred.  Why, my master, what harm think you it will do to us in my dame's casket?  Or what right have we to make away with the little one's property?\"  His common sense was equally far removed from the horror of the one visitor as from the reverence of the other, and so it pleased neither. Master Langston was the first to speak, observing that the relic made it evident that the child must have been baptized.  \"A Popish baptism,\" said Master Heatherthwayte, \"with chrism and taper and words and gestures to destroy the pure simplicity of the sacrament.\"  Controversy here seemed to be setting in, and the infant cause of it here setting up a cry, Susan escaped under pretext of putting Humfrey to bed in the next room, and carried off both the little ones.  The conversation then fell upon the voyage, and the captain described the impregnable aspect of the castle of Dumbarton, which was held for Queen Mary by her faithful partisan, Lord Flemyng.  On this, Cuthbert Langston asked whether he had heard any tidings of the imprisoned Queen, and he answered that it was reported at Leith that she had well-nigh escaped from Lochleven, in the disguise of a lavender or washerwoman.  She was actually in the boat, and about to cross the lake, when a rude oarsman attempted to pull aside her muffler, and the whiteness of the hand she raised in self-protection betrayed her, so that she was carried back.  \"If she had reached Dumbarton,\" he said, \"she might have mocked at the Lords of the Congregation.  Nay, she might have been in that very brig, whose wreck I beheld.\"  \"And well would it have been for Scotland and England had it been the will of Heaven that so it should fall out,\" observed the Puritan.  \"Or it may be,\" said the merchant, \"that the poor lady's escape was frustrated by Providence, that she might be saved from the rocks of the Spurn.\"  \"The poor lady, truly!  Say rather the murtheress,\" quoth Heatherthwayte.  \"Say rather the victim and scapegoat of other men's plots,\" protested Langston.  \"Come, come, sirs,\" says Talbot, \"we'll have no high words here on what Heaven only knoweth.  Poor lady she is, in all sooth, if sackless; poorer still if guilty; so I know not what matter there is for falling out about.  In any sort, I will not have it at my table.\" He spoke with the authority of the captain of a ship, and the two visitors, scarce knowing it, submitted to his decision of manner, but the harmony of the evening seemed ended.  Cuthbert Langston soon rose to bid good-night, first asking his cousin at what hour he proposed to set forth for the Spurn, to which Richard briefly replied that it depended on what had to be done as to the repairs of the ship.  The clergyman tarried behind him to say, \"Master Talbot, I marvel that so godly a man as you have ever been should be willing to harbour one so popishly affected, and whom many suspect of being a seminary priest.\"  \"Master Heatherthwayte,\" returned the captain, \"my kinsman is my kinsman, and my house is my house.  No offence, sir, but I brook not meddling.\"  The clergyman protested that no offence was intended, only caution, and betook himself to his own bare chamber, high above.  No sooner was he gone than Captain Talbot again became absorbed in the endeavour to spell out the mystery of the scroll, with his elbows on the table and his hands over his ears, nor did he look up till he was touched by his wife, when he uttered an impatient demand what she wanted now.  She had the little waif in her arms undressed, and with only a woollen coverlet loosely wrapped round her, and without speaking she pointed to the little shoulder-blades, where two marks had been indelibly made--on one side the crowned monogram of the Blessed Virgin, on the other a device like the Labarum, only that the upright was surmounted by a fleur-de-lis.  Richard Talbot gave a sort of perplexed grunt of annoyance to acknowledge that he saw them.  \"Poor little maid! how could they be so cruel?  They have been branded with a hot iron,\" said the lady.  \"They that parted from her meant to know her again,\" returned Talbot.  \"Surely they are Popish marks,\" added Mistress Susan.  \"Look you here, Dame Sue, I know you for a discreet woman.  Keep this gear to yourself, both the letter and the marks.  Who hath seen them?\"  \"I doubt me whether even Colet has seen this mark.\"  \"That is well.  Keep all out of sight.  Many a man has been brought into trouble for a less matter swelled by prating tongues.\"  \"Have you made it out?\"  \"Not I.  It may be only the child's horoscope, or some old wife's charm that is here sewn up, and these marks may be naught but some sailor's freak; but, on the other hand, they may be concerned with perilous matter, so the less said the better.\"  \"Should they not be shown to my lord, or to her Grace's Council?\"  \"I'm not going to run my head into trouble for making a coil about what may be naught.  That's what befell honest Mark Walton.  He thought he had seized matter of State, and went up to Master Walsingham, swelling like an Indian turkey-cock, with his secret letters, and behold they turned out to be a Dutch fishwife's charm to bring the herrings.  I can tell you he has rued the work he made about it ever since.  On the other hand, let it get abroad through yonder prating fellow, Heatherthwayte, or any other, that Master Richard Talbot had in his house a child with, I know not what Popish tokens, and a scroll in an unknown tongue, and I should be had up in gyves for suspicion of treason, or may be harbouring the Prince of Scotland himself, when it is only some poor Scottish archer's babe.\"  \"You would not have me part with the poor little one?\"  \"Am I a Turk or a Pagan?  No.  Only hold thy peace, as I shall hold mine, until such time as I can meet some one whom I can trust to read this riddle.  Tell me--what like is the child?  Wouldst guess it to be of gentle, or of clownish blood, if women can tell such things?\"  \"Of gentle blood, assuredly,\" cried the lady, so that he smiled and said, \"I might have known that so thou wouldst answer.\"  \"Nay, but see her little hands and fingers, and the mould of her dainty limbs.  No Scottish fisher clown was her father, I dare be sworn.  Her skin is as fair and fine as my Humfrey's, and moreover she has always been in hands that knew how a babe should be tended. Any woman can tell you that!\"  \"And what like is she in your woman's eyes?  What complexion doth she promise?\"  \"Her hair, what she has of it, is dark; her eyes--bless them--are of a deep blue, or purple, such as most babes have till they take their true tint.  There is no guessing.  Humfrey's eyes were once like to be brown, now are they as blue as thine own.\"  \"I understand all that,\" said Captain Talbot, smiling.  \"If she have kindred, they will know her better by the sign manual on her tender flesh than by her face.\"  \"And who are they?\"  \"Who are they?\" echoed the captain, rolling up the scroll in despair. \"Here, take it, Susan, and keep it safe from all eyes.  Whatever it may be, it may serve thereafter to prove her true name.  And above all, not a word or breath to Heatherthwayte, or any of thy gossips, wear they coif or bands.\"  \"Ah, sir! that you will mistrust the good man.\"  \"I said not I mistrust any one; only that I will have no word of all this go forth!  Not one!  Thou heedest me, wife?\"  \"Verily I do, sir; I will be mute.\"     CHAPTER II.  EVIL TIDINGS.   After giving orders for the repairs of the Mastiff, and the disposal of her crew, Master Richard Talbot purveyed himself of a horse at the hostel, and set forth for Spurn Head to make inquiries along the coast respecting the wreck of the Bride of Dunbar, and he was joined by Cuthbert Langston, who said his house had had dealings with her owners, and that he must ascertain the fate of her wares.  His good lady remained in charge of the mysterious little waif, over whom her tender heart yearned more and more, while her little boy hovered about in serene contemplation of the treasure he thought he had recovered.  To him the babe seemed really his little sister; to his mother, if she sometimes awakened pangs of keen regret, yet she filled up much of the dreary void of the last few weeks.  Mrs. Talbot was a quiet, reserved woman, not prone to gadding abroad, and she had made few acquaintances during her sojourn at Hull; but every creature she knew, or might have known, seemed to her to drop in that day, and bring at least two friends to inspect the orphan of the wreck, and demand all particulars.  The little girl was clad in the swaddling garments of Mrs. Talbot's own children, and the mysterious marks were suspected by no one, far less the letter which Susan, for security's sake, had locked up in her nearly empty, steel-bound, money casket.  The opinions of the gossips varied, some thinking the babe might belong to some of the Queen of Scotland's party fleeing to France, others fathering her on the refugees from the persecutions in Flanders, a third party believing her a mere fisherman's child, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4596"],["title","Unknown to History: A Story of the Captivity of Mary of Scotland (#3)"],["body","lean, lantern-jawed old crone, Mistress Rotherford, observing, \"Take my word, Mrs. Talbot, and keep her not with you.  They that are cast up by the sea never bring good with them.\"  The court of female inquiry was still sitting when a heavy tread was heard, and Colet announced \"a serving-man from Bridgefield had ridden post haste to speak with madam,\" and the messenger, booted and spurred, with the mastiff badge on his sleeve, and the hat he held in his hand, followed closely.  \"What news, Nathanael?\" she asked, as she responded to his greeting.  \"Ill enough news, mistress,\" was the answer.  \"Master Richard's ship be in, they tell me.\"  \"Yes, but he is rid out to make inquiry for a wreck,\" said the lady. \"Is all well with my good father-in-law?\"  \"He ails less in body than in mind, so please you.  Being that Master Humfrey was thrown by Blackfoot, the beast being scared by a flash of lightning, and never spoke again.\"  \"Master Humfrey!\"  \"Ay, mistress.  Pitched on his head against the south gate-post.  I saw how it was with him when we took him up, and he never so much as lifted an eyelid, but died at the turn of the night.  Heaven rest his soul!'  \"Heaven rest his soul!\" echoed Susan, and the ladies around chimed in. They had come for one excitement, and here was another.  \"There!  See but what I said!\" quoth Mrs. Rotherford, uplifting a skinny finger to emphasise that the poor little flotsome had already brought evil.  \"Nay,\" said the portly wife of a merchant, \"begging your pardon, this may be a fat instead of a lean sorrow.  Leaves the poor gentleman heirs, Mrs. Talbot?\"  \"Oh no!\" said Susan, with tears in her eyes.  \"His wife died two years back, and her chrisom babe with her.  He loved her too well to turn his mind to wed again, and now he is with her for aye.\"  And she covered her face and sobbed, regardless of the congratulations of the merchant's wife, and exclaiming, \"Oh! the poor old lady!\"  \"In sooth, mistress,\" said Nathanael, who had stood all this time as if he had by no means emptied his budget of ill news, \"poor old madam fell down all of a heap on the floor, and when the wenches lifted her, they found she was stricken with the dead palsy, and she has not spoken, and there's no one knows what to do, for the poor old squire is like one distraught, sitting by her bed like an image on a monument, with the tears flowing down his old cheeks.  'But,' says he to me, 'get you to Hull, Nat, and take madam's palfrey and a couple of sumpter beasts, and bring my good daughter Talbot back with you as fast as she and the babes may brook.'  I made bold to say, 'And Master Richard, your worship?' then he groaned somewhat, and said, 'If my son's ship be come in, he must do as her Grace's service permits, but meantime he must spare us his wife, for she is sorely needed here.'  And he looked at the bed so as it would break your heart to see, for since old Nurse Took hath been doited, there's not been a wench about the house that can do a hand's turn for a sick body.\"  Susan knew this was true, for her mother-in-law had been one of those bustling, managing housewives, who prefer doing everything themselves to training others, and she was appalled at the idea of the probable desolation and helplessness of the bereaved household.  It was far too late to start that day, even had her husband been at home, for the horses sent for her had to rest.  The visitors would fain have extracted some more particulars about the old squire's age, his kindred to the great Earl, and the amount of estate to which her husband had become heir.  There were those among them who could not understand Susan's genuine grief, and there were others whose consolations were no less distressing to one of her reserved character. She made brief answer that the squire was threescore and fifteen years old, his wife nigh about his age; that her husband was now their only child; that he was descended from a son of the great Earl John, killed at the Bridge of Chatillon, that he held the estate of Bridgefield in fief on tenure of military service to the head of his family.  She did not know how much it was worth by the year, but she must pray the good ladies to excuse her, as she had many preparations to make.  Volunteers to assist her in packing her mails were made, but she declined them all, and rejoiced when left alone with Colet to arrange for what would be probably her final departure from Hull.  It was a blow to find that she must part from her servant-woman, who, as well as her husband Gervas, was a native of Hull.  Not only were they both unwilling to leave, but the inland country was to their imagination a wild unexplored desert.  Indeed, Colet had only entered Mrs. Talbot's service to supply the place of a maid who bad sickened with fever and ague, and had to be sent back to her native Hallamshire.  Ere long Mr. Heatherthwayte came down to offer his consolation, and still more his advice, that the little foundling should be at once baptized--conditionally, if the lady preferred it.  The Reformed of imperfect theological training, and as such Joseph Heatherthwayte must be classed, were apt to view the ceremonial of the old baptismal form, symbolical and beautiful as it was, as almost destroying the efficacy of the rite.  Moreover, there was a further impression that the Church by which the child was baptized, had a right to bring it up, and thus the clergyman was urgent with the lady that she should seize this opportunity for the little one's baptism.  \"Not without my husband's consent and knowledge,\" she said resolutely.  \"Master Talbot is a good man, but somewhat careless of sound doctrine, as be the most of seafaring men.\"  Susan had been a little nettled by her husband's implied belief that she was influenced by the minister, so there was double resolution, as well as some offence in her reply, that she knew her duty as a wife too well to consent to such a thing without him.  As to his being careless, he was a true and God-fearing man, and Mr. Heatherthwayte should know better than to speak thus of him to his wife.  Mr. Heatherthwayte's real piety and goodness had made him a great comfort to Susan in her lonely grief, but he had not the delicate tact of gentle blood, and had not known where to stop, and as he stood half apologising and half exhorting, she felt that her Richard was quite right, and that he could be both meddling and presuming. He was exceedingly in the way of her packing too, and she was at her wit's end to get rid of him, when suddenly Humfrey managed to pinch his fingers in a box, and set up such a yell, as, seconded by the frightened baby, was more than any masculine ears could endure, and drove Master Heatherthwayte to beat a retreat.  Mistress Susan was well on in her work when her husband returned, and as she expected, was greatly overcome by the tidings of his brother's death.  He closely questioned Nathanael on every detail, and could think of nothing but the happy days he had shared with his brother, and of the grief of his parents.  He approved of all that his wife had done; and as the damage sustained by the Mastiff could not be repaired under a month, he had no doubt about leaving his crew in the charge of his lieutenant while he took his family home.  So busy were both, and so full of needful cares, the one in giving up her lodging, the other in leaving his men, that it was impossible to inquire into the result of his researches, for the captain was in that mood of suppressed grief and vehement haste in which irrelevant inquiry is perfectly unbearable.  It was not till late in the evening that Richard told his wife of his want of success in his investigations.  He had found witnesses of the destruction of the ship, but he did not give them full credit.  \"The fellows say the ship drove on the rock, and that they saw her boats go down with every soul on board, and that they would not lie to an officer of her Grace.  Heaven pardon me if I do them injustice in believing they would lie to him sooner than to any one else.  They are rogues enough to take good care that no poor wretch should survive even if he did chance to come to land.\"  \"Then if there be no one to claim her, we may bring up as our own the sweet babe whom Heaven hath sent us.\"  \"Not so fast, dame.  Thou wert wont to be more discreet.  I said not so, but for the nonce, till I can come by the rights of that scroll, there's no need to make a coil.  Let no one know of it, or of the trinket--Thou hast them safe?\"  \"Laid up with the Indian gold chain, thy wedding gift, dear sir.\"  \"'Tis well.  My mother!--ah me,\" he added, catching himself up; \"little like is she to ask questions, poor soul.\"  Then Susan diffidently told of Master Heatherthwayte's earnest wish to christen the child, and, what certainly biased her a good deal, the suggestion that this would secure her to their own religion.  \"There is something in that,\" said Richard, \"specially after what Cuthbert said as to the golden toy yonder.  If times changed again--which Heaven forfend--that fellow might give us trouble about the matter.\"  \"You doubt him then, sir!\" she asked.  \"I relished not his ways on our ride to-day,\" said Richard.  \"Sure I am that he had some secret cause for being so curious about the wreck.  I suspect him of some secret commerce with the Queen of Scots' folk.\"  \"Yet you were on his side against Mr. Heatherthwayte,\" said Susan.  \"I would not have my kinsman browbeaten at mine own table by the self-conceited son of a dalesman, even if he have got a round hat and Geneva band!  Ah, well! one good thing is we shall leave both of them well behind us, though I would it were for another cause.\"  Something in the remonstrance had, however, so worked on Richard Talbot, that before morning be declared that, hap what hap, if he and his wife were to bring up the child, she should be made a good Protestant Christian before they left the house, and there should be no more ado about it.
