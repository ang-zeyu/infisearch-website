Barto sprang up. 'I shall be your courier, dear lady,' he said, and commenced his professional career in her service by shouting to the vetturino to drive on.  Wilfrid met them as he was trotting down from the Porta del Palio, and to him his sister confided her new trouble in having a strange man attached to her, who might be anything.  'We don't know the man,' said her husband; and Adela pleaded for him: 'Don't speak to him harshly, pray, Wilfrid; he says he has a mother dying in Milan.'  Barto kept his head down on his arms and groaned; Adela gave a doleful little grimace. 'Oh, take the poor beggar,' said Wilfrid; and sang out to him in Italian: 'Who are you--what are you, my fine fellow?'  Barto groaned louder, and replied in Swiss-French from a smothering depth: 'A poor man, and the gracious lady's servant till we reach Milan.'  'I can't wait,' said Wilfrid; 'I start in half-an-hour.  It's all right; you must take him now you've got him, or else pitch him out--one of the two.  If things go on quietly we shall have the Autumn manoeuvres in a week, and then you may see something of the army.'  He rode away.  Barto passed the gates as one of the licenced English family.  Milan was more strictly guarded than when he had quitted it.  He had anticipated that it would be so, and tamed his spirit to submit to the slow stages of the carriage, spent a fiery night in Brescia, and entered the city of action on the noon of the fourteenth.  Safe within the walls, he thanked the English lady, assuring her that her charitable deed would be remembered aloft.  He then turned his steps in the direction of the Revolutionary post-office.  This place was nothing other than a blank abutment of a corner house that had long been undergoing repair, and had a great bank of brick and mortar rubbish at its base.  A stationary melonseller and some black fig and vegetable stalls occupied the triangular space fronting it.  The removal of a square piece of cement showed a recess, where, chiefly during the night, letters and proclamation papers were deposited, for the accredited postman to disperse them.  Hither, as one would go to a caffe for the news, Barto Rizzo came in the broad glare of noon, and flinging himself down like a tired man under the strip of shade, worked with a hand behind him, and drew out several folded scraps, of which one was addressed to him by his initials.  He opened it and read:  'Your house is watched.  'A corporal of the P .  .  .  ka regiment was seen leaving it this morning in time for the second bugle.  'Reply:--where to meet.  'Spies are doubled, troops coming.  'The numbers in Verona; who heads them.  'Look to your wife.  'Letters are called for every third hour.'  Barto sneered indolently at this fresh evidence of the small amount of intelligence which he could ever learn from others.  He threw his eyes all round the vacant space while pencilling in reply:--  'V. waits for M., but in a box' (that is, Verona for Milan).  'We take the key to her.  'I have no wife, but a little pupil.  'A Lieutenant Pierson, of the dragoons; Czech white coats, helmets without plumes; an Englishman, nephew of General Pierson: speaks crippled Italian; returns from V. to-day.  Keep eye on him;--what house, what hour.'  Meditating awhile, Barto wrote out Vittoria's name and enclosed it in a thick black ring.  Beneath it he wrote  'The same on all the play-bills.  'The Fifteenth is cancelled.  'We meet the day after.  'At the house of Count M. to-night.'  He secreted this missive, and wrote Vittoria's name on numbers of slips to divers addresses, heading them, 'From the Pope's Mouth,' such being the title of the Revolutionary postoffice, to whatsoever spot it might in prudence shift.  The title was entirely complimentary to his Holiness. Tangible freedom, as well as airy blessings, were at that time anticipated, and not without warrant, from the mouth of the successor of St.  Peter.  From the Pope's Mouth the clear voice of Italian liberty was to issue.  This sentiment of the period was a natural and a joyful one, and endowed the popular ebullition with a sense of unity and a stamp of righteousness that the abstract idea of liberty could not assure to it before martyrdom.  After suffering, after walking in the shades of death and despair, men of worth and of valour cease to take high personages as representative objects of worship, even when these (as the good Pope was then doing) benevolently bless the nation and bid it to have great hope, with a voice of authority.  But, for an extended popular movement a great name is like a consecrated banner.  Proclamations from the Pope's Mouth exacted reverence, and Barto Rizzo, who despised the Pope (because he was Pope, doubtless), did not hesitate to make use of him by virtue of his office.  Barto lay against the heap of rubbish, waiting for the approach of his trained lad, Checco, a lanky simpleton, cunning as a pure idiot, who was doing postman's duty, when a kick, delivered by that youth behind, sent him bounding round with rage, like a fish in air.  The marketplace resounded with a clapping of hands; for it was here that Checco came daily to eat figs, and it was known that the 'povero,' the dear half- witted creature, would not tolerate an intruder in the place where he stretched his limbs to peel and suck in the gummy morsels twice or thrice a day.  Barto seized and shook him.  Checco knocked off his hat; the bandage about the wound broke and dropped, and Barto put his hand to his forehead, murmuring: 'What 's come to me that I lose my temper with a boy--an animal?'  The excitement all over the triangular space was hushed by an imperious guttural shout that scattered the groups.  Two Austrian officers, followed by military servants, rode side by side.  Dust had whitened their mustachios, and the heat had laid a brown-red varnish on their faces.  Way was made for them, while Barto stood smoothing his forehead and staring at Checco.  'I see the very man!' cried one of the officers quickly.  'Weisspriess, there's the rascal who headed the attack on me in Verona the other day. It's the same!  'Himmel!' returned his companion, scrutinizing the sword-cut, 'if that's your work on his head, you did it right well, my Pierson!  He is very neatly scored indeed.  A clean stroke, manifestly!'  'But here when I left Milan! at Verona when I entered the North-west gate there; and the first man I see as I come back is this very brute.  He dogs me everywhere!  By the way, there may be two of them.'  Lieutenant Pierson leaned over his horse's neck, and looked narrowly at the man Barto Rizzo.  He himself was eyed as in retort, and with yet greater intentness.  At first Barto's hand was sweeping the air within a finger's length of his forehead, like one who fought a giddiness for steady sight.  The mist upon his brain dispersing under the gaze of his enemy, his eyeballs fixed, and he became a curious picture of passive malice, his eyes seeming to say: 'It is enough for me to know your features, and I know them.' Such a look from a civilian is exasperating: it was scarcely to be endured from an Italian of the plebs.  'You appear to me to want more,' said the lieutenant audibly to himself; and he repeated words to the same effect to his companion, in bad German.  'Eh?  You would promote him to another epaulette?' laughed Captain Weisspriess.  'Come off.  Orders are direct against it.  And we're in Milan--not like being in Verona!  And my good fellow!  remember your bet; the dozen of iced Rudesheimer.  I want to drink my share, and dream I'm quartered in Mainz--the only place for an Austrian when he quits Vienna. Come.'  'No; but if this is the villain who attacked me, and tore my coat from my back,' cried Wilfrid, screwing in his saddle.  'And took your letter took your letter; a particular letter; we have heard of it,' said Weisspriess.  The lieutenant exclaimed that he should overhaul and examine the man, and see whether he thought fit to give him into custody.  Weisspriess laid hand on his bridle.  'Take my advice, and don't provoke a disturbance in the streets.  The truth is, you Englishmen and Irishmen get us a bad name among these natives.  If this is the man who unhorsed you and maltreated you, and committed the rape of the letter, I'm afraid you won't get satisfaction out of him, to judge by his look.  I'm really afraid not.  Try it if you like.  In any case, if you halt, I am compelled to quit your society, which is sometimes infinitely diverting.  Let me remind you that you bear despatches.  The other day they were verbal ones; you are now carrying paper.'  'Are you anxious to teach me my duty, Captain Weisspriess?'  'If you don't know it.  I said I would \"remind you.\"  I can also teach you, if you need it.'  'And I can pay you for the instruction, whenever you are disposed to receive payment.'  'Settle your outstanding claims, my good Pierson!'  'When I have fought Jenna?'  'Oh!  you're a Prussian--a Prussian!'  Captain Weisspriess laughed. 'A Prussian, I mean, in your gross way of blurting out everything. I've marched and messed with Prussians--with oxen.'  'I am, as you are aware, an Englishman, Captain Weisspriess.  I am due to Lieutenant Jenna for the present.  After that you or any one may command me.'  'As you please,' said Weisspriess, drawing out one stream of his moustache.  'In the meantime, thank me for luring you away from the chances of a street row.'  Barto Rizzo was left behind, and they rode on to the Duomo.  Glancing up at its pinnacles, Weisspriess said:  'How splendidly Flatschmann's jagers would pick them off from there, now, if the dogs were giving trouble in this part of the city!'  They entered upon a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4436"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 2 (#5)"],["body","discussion of the ways and means of dealing with a revolutionary movement in the streets of a city like Milan, and passed on to the Piazza La Scala.  Weisspriess stopped before the Play-bills.  'To-morrow's the fifteenth of the month,' he said. 'Shall I tell you a secret, Pierson?  I am to have a private peep at the new prima donna this night.  They say she's charming, and very pert. \"I do not interchange letters with Germans.\"  Benlomik sent her a neat little note to the conservatorio--he hadn't seen her only heard of her, and that was our patriotic reply.  She wants taming.  I believe I am called upon for that duty.  At least, my friend Antonio-Pericles, who occasionally assists me with supplies, hints as much to me.  You're an engaged man, or, upon my honour, I wouldn't trust you; but between ourselves, this Greek--and he's quite right--is trying to get her away from the set of snuffy vagabonds who are prompting her for mischief, and don't know how to treat her.'  While he was speaking Barto Rizzo pushed roughly between them, and with a black brush painted the circle about Vittoria's name.  'Do you see that?' said Weisspriess.  'I see,' Wilfrid retorted, 'that you are ready to meddle with the reputation of any woman who is likely to be talked about.  Don't do it in my presence.'  It was natural for Captain Weisspriess to express astonishment at this outburst, and the accompanying quiver of Wilfrid's lip.  'Austrian military etiquette, Lieutenant Pierson,' he said, 'precludes the suspicion that the officers of the Imperial army are subject to dissension in public.  We conduct these affairs upon a different principle.  But I'll tell you what.  That fellow's behaviour may be construed as a more than common stretch of incivility.  I'll do you a service.  I'll arrest him, and then you can hear tidings of your precious letter.  We'll have his confession published.'  Weisspriess drew his sword, and commanded the troopers in attendance to lay hands on Barto; but the troopers called, and the officer found that they were surrounded.  Weisspriess shrugged dismally.  'The brute must go, I suppose,' he said.  The situation was one of those which were every now and then occurring in the Lombard towns and cities, when a chance provocation created a riot that became a revolt or not, according to the timidity of the ruling powers or the readiness of the disaffected.  The extent and evident regulation of the crowd operated as a warning to the Imperial officers.  Weisspriess sheathed his sword and shouted, 'Way, there!'  Way was made for him; but Wilfrid lingered to scrutinize the man who, for an unaccountable reason, appeared to be his peculiar enemy. Barto carelessly threaded the crowd, and Wilfrid, finding it useless to get out after him, cried, 'Who is he?  Tell me the name of that man?' The question drew a great burst of laughter around him, and exclamations of 'Englishman!  Englishman!' He turned where there was a clear way left for him in the track of his brother officer.  Comments on the petty disturbance had been all the while passing at the Caffe La Scala, where sat Agostino Balderini, with, Count Medole and others, who, if the order for their arrest had been issued, were as safe in that place as in their own homes.  Their policy, indeed, was to show themselves openly abroad.  Agostino was enjoying the smoke of paper cigarettes, with all prudent regard for the well-being of an inflammable beard.  Perceiving Wilfrid going by, he said, 'An Englishman!  I continue to hope much from his countrymen.  I have no right to do so, only they insist on it.  They have promised, and more than once, to sail a fleet to our assistance across the plains of Lombardy, and I believe they will --probably in the watery epoch which is to follow Metternich.  Behold my Carlo approaching.  The heart of that lad doth so boil the brain of him, he can scarcely keep the lid on.  What is it now?  Speak, my son.'  Carlo Ammiani had to communicate that he had just seen a black circle to Vittoria's name on two public playbills.  His endeavour to ape a deliberate gravity while he told the tale, roused Agostino's humouristic ire.  'Round her name?' said Agostino.  'Yes; in every bill.'  'Meaning that she is suspected!'  'Meaning any damnable thing you like.'  'It's a device of the enemy.'  Agostino, glad of the pretext to recur to his habitual luxurious irony, threw himself back, repeating 'It 's a device of the enemy.  Calculate, my son, that the enemy invariably knows all you intend to do: determine simply to astonish him with what you do.  Intentions have lungs, Carlo, and depend on the circumambient air, which, if not designedly treacherous, is communicative.  Deeds, I need not remark, are a different body.  It has for many generations been our Italian error to imagine a positive blood relationship--not to say maternity itself--existing between intentions and deeds.  Nothing of the sort!  There is only the intention of a link to unite them.  You perceive?  It's much to be famous for fine intentions, so we won't complain.  Indeed, it's not our business to complain, but Posterity's; for fine intentions are really rich possessions, but they don't leave grand legacies; that is all.  They mean to possess the future: they are only the voluptuous sons of the present. It's my belief, Carlino, from observation, apprehension, and other gifts of my senses, that our paternal government is not unacquainted with our intention to sing a song in a certain opera.  And it may have learnt our clumsy method of enclosing names publicly, at the bidding of a non- appointed prosecutor, so to, isolate or extinguish them.  Who can say? Oh, ay!  Yes! the machinery that can so easily be made rickety is to blame; we admit that; but if you will have a conspiracy like a Geneva watch, you must expect any slight interference with the laws that govern it to upset the mechanism altogether.  Ah-a! look yonder, but not hastily, my Carlo.  Checco is nearing us, and he knows that he has fellows after him.  And if I guess right, he has a burden to deliver to one of us.'  Checco came along at his usual pace, and it was quite evident that he fancied himself under espionage.  On two sides of the square a suspicious figure threaded its way in the line of shade not far behind him.  Checco passed the cafe looking at nothing but the huge hands he rubbed over and over.  The manifest agents of the polizia were nearing when Checco ran back, and began mouthing as in retort at something that had been spoken from the cafe as he shot by.  He made a gabbling appeal on either side, and addressed the pair of apparent mouchards, in what, if intelligible, should have been the language of earnest entreaty.  At the first word which the caffe was guilty of uttering, a fit of exasperation seized him, and the exciteable creature plucked at his hat and sent it whirling across the open-air tables right through the doorway.  Then, with a whine, he begged his followers to get his hat back for him.  They complied.  'We only called \"Illustrissimo!\"' said Agostino, as one of the men returned from the interior of the caffe hat in hand.  'The Signori should have known better--it is an idiot,' the man replied. He was a novice: in daring to rebuke he betrayed his office.  Checco snatched his hat from his attentive friend grinning, and was away in a flash.  Thereupon the caffe laughed, and laughed with an abashing vehemence that disconcerted the spies.  They wavered in their choice of following Checco or not; one went a step forward, one pulled back; the loiterer hurried to rejoin his comrade, who was now for a retrograde movement, and standing together they swayed like two imperfectly jolly fellows, or ballet bandits, each plucking at the other, until at last the maddening laughter made them break, reciprocate cat-like hisses of abuse, and escape as they best could--lamentable figures.  'It says well for Milan that the Tedeschi can scrape up nothing better from the gutters than rascals the like of those for their service,' quoth Agostino.  'Eh, Signor Conte?'  'That enclosure about La Vittoria's name on the bills is correct,' said the person addressed, in a low tone.  He turned and indicated one who followed from the interior of the caffe.  'If Barto is to be trusted she is not safe,' the latter remarked.  He produced a paper that had been secreted in Checco's hat.  Under the date and the superscription of the Pope's Mouth, 'LA VITTORIA' stood out in the ominous heavily-pencilled ring: the initials of Barto Rizzo were in a corner.  Agostino began smoothing his beard.  'He has discovered that she is not trustworthy,' said Count Medole, a young man of a premature gravity and partial baldness, who spoke habitually with a forefinger pressed flat on his long pointed chin.  'Do you mean to tell me, Count Medole, that you attach importance to a communication of this sort?' said Carlo, forcing an amazement to conceal his anger.  'I do, Count Ammiani,' returned the patrician conspirator.  'You really listen to a man you despise?'  'I do not despise him, my friend.'  'You cannot surely tell us that you allow such a man, on his sole authority, to blacken the character of the signorina?'  'I believe that he has not.'  'Believe? trust him?  Then we are all in his hands.  What can you mean? Come to the signorina herself instantly.  Agostino, you now conduct Count Medole to her, and save him from the shame of subscribing to the monstrous calumny.  I beg you to go with our Agostino, Count Medole.  It is time for you--I honour you for the part you have taken; but it is time to act according to your own better judgement.'  Count Medole bowed.  'The filthy rat!' cried Ammiani, panting to let out his wrath.  'A serviceable dog,' Agostino remarked correctingly.  'Keep true to the form of animal, Carlo.  He has done good service in his time.'  'You listen to the man?' Carlo said, now thoroughly amazed.  'An indiscretion is possible to"]]]
