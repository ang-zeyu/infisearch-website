A heavy reward has been offered for his apprehension, and bold menaces are occasionally hung over our heads, that we, as a people, shall be driven from the State. These things have a tendency to check our prosperity. In one instance some of our brethren were kidnapped by Missourians from this State, and put to shame and scourging. The malignant and vexatious lawsuits to which our people have been subject, are exceedingly numerous; and owing to our impoverished condition, rendered sometimes distressing. But none of these things move us, because we know that if they have hated the master, they will also hate the disciples. Such as are born of the bond woman, will persecute them that are born of the free woman. But it seems like a discouraging effort, to attempt to convince our opposers that we are persecuted, because editors and other philanthropic men are reluctant to tell to the public our side of the matter. They themselves would thereby become suspected of espousing our cause. Men are so sensitive on the subject of our religion, that whoever speaks peaceably of it, perils his influence and reputation; but hireling editors and priests will speak and publish against us.  You ask me to give an account of the faith which I have embraced. I believe that Jesus Christ is God, co-eternal with God the Father; and that such as have the knowledge of the gospel and believe upon him, will be saved; and such as believe not, will be damned. I believe the Old and New Testaments to be the word of God. I believe that every person should be born, not only of the spirit, but also of the water, in order to enter into the kingdom of God. There are three that bear witness on earth, as there are three that bear record in heaven--the spirit, the water, and the blood, bear concurrent testimony to our obedience on earth; for the want of any one, or all of these witnesses on earth, in our favour, there will be no registry of our perfect acceptance in heaven. Hence the baptism for the dead. The righteous dead have a merciful provision made for them in the testimony of the three witnesses on earth, which secures a record of their perfect acceptance in heaven, without which they cannot attain to the highest glory. I believe in the resurrection of the dead, the righteous to life eternal, and the wicked to shame and everlasting contempt. I believe that repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, are among the elementary and cardinal truths of the gospel.  In some, and, indeed, many respects do we differ from sectarian denominations. We believe that God is a being that has both body and parts, and also passions; also in the existence of the gifts in the true church spoken of in St. Paul's letter to the Corinthians.  I believe that every church, in gospel order, has a priesthood, consisting of prophets, apostles, elders, &c., and that the knowledge and power of a priesthood, ordained of God, as the ancient priesthood was, is indispensably necessary to the prosperity of the church. I do not believe that the canon of sacred scripture was closed with the revelation of John, but believe that wherever God has a true church, there he makes frequent revelations of his will: and as God takes cognizance of all things, both temporal and spiritual, his revelations will pertain to all things whereby his glory may be promoted, and the temporal and spiritual well-being of his people advanced. Any people that are destitute of the teachings of prophets and apostles, which come by immediate revelation, will soon fall into divisions and strifes, and depart from the truth as it is in Jesus.  You wish to know, \"What is the personal character and influence, doctrines and claims of him who is called the leader, Joseph Smith?\" Joseph Smith, when the great designs of heaven were first made known to him, was not far from the age of seventeen; from that time to this he has had much said about him, both of a favourable and unfavourable nature. I shall only speak of his character as I believe it to be from an intimate acquaintance of more than one year, and from an intimate acquaintance with those who have been with him many years. No man is more narrowly watched by friends and enemies than Mr. Joseph Smith; consequently, if he were as good a man as any prophet that has preceded him, he would have as violent enemies as others have had. But I hasten to give my own opinion.  I firmly avow, in the presence of God, that I believe Mr. Joseph Smith to be an upright man, that seeks the glory of God in such a manner as is well pleasing to the Most High God. Naturally he is kind and obliging; pitiful and courteous; as far from dissimulation as any man; frank and loquacious to all men, friends or foes. He seems to employ no studied effort to guard himself against misrepresentation, but often leaves himself exposed to misconstructions by those who watch for faults. He is remarkably cheerful for one who has seen well-tried friends martyred around him, and felt the inflictions of calumny--the vexation of lawsuits--the treachery of intimates--and multiplied violent attempts upon his person and life, together with the cares of much business. His influence, after which you inquire, is very great. His friends are as ardently attached to him as his enemies are violently opposed. Free toleration is given to all opposing religions, but wherever he is accredited as a prophet of the living God, there you will perceive his influence must be great. That lurking fear and suspicion that he may become a dictator or despot, gradually gives place to confidence and fondness, as believers become acquainted with him.  In doctrine, Mr. Smith is eminently scriptural. I have never known him to deny or depreciate a single truth of the Old and New Testaments, but I have always known him to explain and defend them in a masterly manner. Being anointed of God, for the purpose of teaching and perfecting the church, it is needful that he should know how to set in order the things that are wanting, and to bring forth things new and old, as a scribe well instructed. This office and apostleship he appears to magnify; at his touch the ancient prophets spring into life, and the beauty and power of their revelations are made to commend themselves with thrilling interest to all that hear.  You inquire, \"Does he claim to be inspired?\" Certainly he does claim to be inspired. He often speaks in the name of the Lord, which would be rank hypocrisy and mockery, if he were not inspired to do it. It seems very difficult for those who stand at the distance of many generations from the true prophets, to realize what prophets are, and what ought to be expected from them. I do not chide them for their ignorance and folly, however, because I have nothing to boast of, previous to embracing the faith of the Latter-day Saints. I understand that prophets may speak as they are moved by the Holy Ghost at one time, while they may be very far from being moved by the Holy Ghost as they speak at another. They may be endowed with power to perform miracles and mighty deeds at one time, while they have no authority, and there is no suitableness in doing the same at another time.  You ask, \"Is he a man of prayer, of a pure life, of peace? Does he appear at the head of his troops as a military commander?\" These questions I answer, according to the best knowledge I have, in the affirmative. As a people, we perform military duty as the laws of the State of Illinois enjoin and require. The legion answers the purpose to keep the lawless and mobocratic at a respectful distance; and the more \"earthquake and storm\" our enemies raise about the Nauvoo Legion, and a military chieftain like the ancient Mahomet, the greater fear and dread of us will be conveyed to the minds of the lawless, who watch for prey, and spoil, and booty. I can assure you, that neither Mr. Smith, nor any other intelligent Latter-day Saint, ever intends to make one convert by the sword; neither are we such tee-total peacemakers, that any savage banditti of lawless depredators could waste our property, violate virtue, and shed innocent blood, without experiencing from us a firm defence of law, of right, and innocence. We are to this day very sensitive to a repetition of past wrongs that we still smart under. The Lord our God, who was once called (by a man after his own heart) \"a man of war,\" we trust will be our defence and strong tower in the day of battle, if our country should ever call us to scenes of carnage and blood.  You ask, \"What is the nature of the worship among you, and wherein does it differ from that of religious people with whom you have been acquainted elsewhere?\" On the sabbath some person usually preaches a sermon after prayer and singing, and, perhaps, reading some scripture. We have, also, frequent prayer meetings, in which all that are so disposed may join. The gifts are variously exercised, sometimes in the way of prophecy, or in tongues; sometimes in discerning of spirits, or interpretation of tongues. The ordinance of baptism, together with the imposition of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, is administered as occasion may require. Thus you will perceive that our worship differs from what we both have been accustomed to in times that are past.--Anxious seats and inquiry meetings, &c., are not in use at all with us; although converts to our faith have swelled our numbers greatly in every year that is past, yet we are very far from employing any blustering effort to convert men. The spirit of God attends the truth with sufficient power to save the upright; while those that hold the truth in unrighteousness, and contend with it, are beyond the legitimate exercise of divine power to save, and are led captive by the devil at his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45846"],["title","Letters Exhibiting the Most Prominent Doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of (#5)"],["body","ll.  Our worship differs from that of other religious people, inasmuch as we have the knowledge of God, and the true doctrine and order of his kingdom, beyond all perplexing doubt and diversity of opinion. It is utterly impossible for intelligent and devoted sectarian clergy to lead their hearers into any considerable knowledge of God, for this very potent reason, that they neither know much of him themselves, nor, indeed, have they the means of knowing him. For this they are not at all culpable; but the fact is, nevertheless, incontrovertible.  I do not now speak to please men, nor to mortify them, but I know it to be true, my brother, and therefore speak it boldly. Are you offended? Will you stop here and throw down my letter with contempt, as though an ignorant upstart had abused you? If I write plainly, it is with deep and painful emotions. While writing I can hardly suppress a flood of tears. I know the dilemma in which many of my religious brethren are placed, and the extreme difficulty of approaching them; but whether they hear or forbear, I must tell them that it is out of their power to attain to any considerable knowledge of the true and living God. But, say they, have we not got the good old Bible, which makes men wise unto salvation? You have, indeed, those venerable truths which have many ages since made men wise unto salvation; and those truths will teach you, if you take heed to them, that the Gentiles have been broken off from the covenant favour of God as the Jews were. But these scriptures cannot impart to you the gifts of the Holy Ghost; they cannot ordain and qualify you to teach and preach the gospel, and administer the ordinances; they cannot give you promises and revelations that are expressly for _you_.  When the apostle Paul was in danger of being shipwrecked with his crew (see Acts of Apostles), it would have been poor consolation to him to read the ancient history of Jonah's shipwreck, and pray over the subject in order to know how the voyage would result to him; but how much greater his consolation, and how much more certain his knowledge, when God ministers to him by visions and angels, and promises both him and the crew preservation. Philip wanted no better assurance of his duty to go to Gaza, than for an angel of God to tell him to go; but if he had pored over ancient revelations, with prayerful anxiety, in order to know the same, it would have been a poor guide. The New Testament Saints did not lean upon Old Testament revelations for the knowledge of present duties, or for aid in their present contingencies; they looked directly to God for present fresh instruction and aid--they obtained what they looked for.  The ancient Jews (contemporary with Christ), that leaned on the venerated sayings of Abraham and Moses, and other old prophets, abode in darkness, and became the prey of foul spirits, while the advocates of present revelations were mighty through God, in signs and wonders, and marvellous deeds.  Now, let the religious people of this day depend exclusively upon the ancient scriptures, rejecting present revelations, and they will be filled with ignorance, and the spirit of unrighteousness will possess them; and they cannot act with that certainty and power that those can, who know for themselves by immediate revelation. But I have said it is impossible for them to know much of the true God: the careful observer knows, that what one sect or denomination teaches for doctrine, another will controvert and deny. There is not that power in the doctrine of any one sect that gives them much ascendancy over any other sect. The doctrines of all sects, though adverse to each other, are about equally weighty and plausible; no one gets any considerable ascendancy; if there appears to be light in one sect over another sect, it shows an equal amount of an opposite character.  It is an acknowledged duty of parents, in this church, to teach their children the elementary principles of religion, training them up in the way they should go. You ask if they are instructed in learning. As a people we aim most diligently to give our children learning. Our persecutions, oppressions, and poverty have operated greatly to the disadvantage of our children; still we have a chartered University, that promises much benefit to us; and common schools are extensively multiplying throughout the city.  The present population of the city is from ten to twelve thousand. You ask, \"What is their condition, occupation, and general character?\" The condition of the people is as prosperous as circumstances will permit. Many of them, like Jacob of old, have left a good patrimony at home that they are not benefitted from, by reason of their being every where spoken against; but though they had nothing but their staff in hand, and a little bundle upon their back when they came, they have now in many instances a comfortable cottage, a flourishing garden, and a good cow. There are many instances of families being subject to privations, beyond what they were accustomed to in early days; and there are some instances of deep penury, through sickness, persecution, and other uncontrollable causes; and there are also instances of wealth; but be assured, sir, there is not a more contented and cheerful people to be found. Families will consent to let father and brother go out preaching, when their daily bread is barely supplied for a few months.  Believing as we do, that these are the last days, and that signal matters await this generation; and that the harvest must be gathered soon, if at all, you must not marvel if we do not all at once become rich, and build large houses, and enclose productive farms. If riches were our object, we might readily gratify the most ambitious grasp. We possess every facility for being rich, but we long to behold the beauty of the Lord, and inquire in his holy temple. The place of his sanctuary, which we greatly desire to beautify, is a site of surpassing natural beauty. Upon it stands the incomplete structure of a temple; in dimensions, a little over one hundred and twenty-eight feet long, by eighty-eight feet wide, to be elevated in height a little under sixty feet; the walls are made of a well-wrought handsome stone. The inhabitants are very industrious, being occupied in agriculture and the various mechanical arts.  Our people are mostly the working class of the community, from the United States, and Great Britain and her Provinces. They are a very intelligent people, especially so far as common sense and a general knowledge of men and things are concerned.  Our Elders are versed in religious polemics, from discussions in the pulpit, stage, bar-room, canal, and steam-boat, of the fireside and highway side: and, perhaps, you are not aware that many, very many, are from the most enlightened portion of New England; men that have been rocked in the cradle of orthodoxy and liberty; accustomed to fatigue, privation, and opposition; and knowing that their religion has more light and truth, and the power of the Holy Ghost to support it, than any other that has existed since the days of the apostles, they are prepared to endure all things with the assurance that their reward is great in heaven.  You wish to know the general character of the people. There is probably less profanity, drunkenness, lewdness, theft, fighting, gambling, and tavern-haunting, than in any other city of the same magnitude.  But I must close my answer to your many and minute inquiries, having already protracted them beyond my original design. Your letter contains many important inquiries, similar indeed to what I have received from other distinguished friends from different parts of the Union. You will accept my apology for not answering at an earlier date; and though I design this epistle to be a general answer to all similar inquiries, yet shall hereafter readily reciprocate all private communications in the usual method of friendship and affection.  Most sincerely and truly yours,  ORSON SPENCER.    LETTER II.  IMMEDIATE REVELATION.  _Liverpool, May_ 15, 1847.  Reverend Sir,--Agreeable to promise made in my first answer to your letter, I now resume my pen to inform you, in a series of letters, of the distinguishing tenets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to the faith which I myself do entertain, with all sobriety and integrity of heart, before God and all good men. I had hoped, however, that more leisure would have favoured me, not only that I might more minutely and perspicuously maintain the primitive faith, but also do it in such conciseness and embellishment of diction, as both to please and enlighten.  The first subject to which I will invite your attention will be that of IMMEDIATE REVELATION. It shall be my direct aim to show in this letter, that no person ever did partake of the gospel of salvation, or ever will partake of it, without the spirit of _revelation_ dwelling in his breast. This is the first and also the last round in the ladder that leads to the perfect knowledge of God. Without the same spirit of revelation that dwelt in the breasts of prophets, patriarchs, and apostles in ancient time, no man can _begin_ to know God, neither can any man or set of men make any _progress_ in the knowledge of God, when that spirit is withdrawn from him.  A word from the mouth of the Great Arbitrator of all controversy ought to suffice. HE, THE GREAT GOD AND JUDGE OF ALL, has said that \"no man knoweth the Father but the Son, and no man knoweth the Son but he to whom the Son revealeth him.\" Words cannot bear a plainer import. If any man knows Jesus Christ, it is by _revelation_, and in no other way can he be known. Will you say that apostles and prophets know him in this way; while others _may_ know him without themselves being gifted with the spirit of revelation? Absurd! Others must know him by revelation as much as apostles and prophets. If they have not the spirit of revelation, they cannot"]]]
