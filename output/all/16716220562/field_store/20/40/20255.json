The word discontent sums them up.  As soon as discontent is generalised a party is formed which often becomes strong enough to struggle against the Government.  Discontent must generally have been accumulating for a long time in order to produce its effects.  For this reason a revolution does not always represent a phenomenon in process of termination followed by another which is commencing but rather a continuous phenomenon, having somewhat accelerated its evolution.  All the modern revolutions, however, have been abrupt movements, entailing the instantaneous overthrow of governments.  Such, for example, were the Brazilian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese revolutions.  To the contrary of what might be supposed, the very conservative peoples are addicted to the most violent revolutions.  Being conservative, they are not able to evolve slowly, or to adapt themselves to variations of environment, so that when the discrepancy becomes too extreme they are bound to adapt themselves suddenly.  This sudden evolution constitutes a revolution.  Peoples able to adapt themselves progressively do not always escape revolution.  It was only by means of a revolution that the English, in 1688, were able to terminate the struggle which had dragged on for a century between the monarchy, which sought to make itself absolute, and the nation, which claimed the right to govern itself through the medium of its representatives.  The great revolutions have usually commenced from the top, not from the bottom; but once the people is unchained it is to the people that revolution owes its might.  It is obvious that revolutions have never taken place, and will never take place, save with the aid of an important fraction of the army.  Royalty did not disappear in France on the day when Louis XVI. was guillotined, but at the precise moment when his mutinous troops refused to defend him.  It is more particularly by mental contagion that armies become disaffected, being indifferent enough at heart to the established order of things.  As soon as the coalition of a few officers had succeeded in overthrowing the Turkish Government the Greek officers thought to imitate them and to change their government, although there was no analogy between the two regimes.  A military movement may overthrow a government--and in the Spanish republics the Government is hardly ever destroyed by any other means--but if the revolution is to be productive of great results it must always be based upon general discontent and general hopes.  Unless it is universal and excessive, discontent alone is not sufficient to bring about a revolution.  It is easy to lead a handful of men to pillage, destroy, and massacre, but to raise a whole people, or any great portion of that people, calls for the continuous or repeated action of leaders.  These exaggerate the discontent; they persuade the discontented that the government is the sole cause of all the trouble, especially of the prevailing dearth, and assure men that the new system proposed by them will engender an age of felicity.  These ideas germinate, propagating themselves by suggestion and contagion, and the moment arrives when the revolution is ripe.  In this fashion the Christian Revolution and the French Revolution were prepared.  That the latter was effected in a few years, while the first required many, was due to the fact that the French Revolution promptly had an armed force at its disposal, while Christianity was long in winning material power. In the beginning its only adepts were the lowly, the poor, and the slaves, filled with enthusiasm by the prospect of seeing their miserable life transformed into an eternity of delight.  By a phenomenon of contagion from below, of which history affords us more than one example, the doctrine finally invaded the upper strata of the nation, but it was a long time before an emperor considered the new faith sufficiently widespread to be adopted as the official religion.   4.  The Results of Political Revolutions.   When a political party is triumphant it naturally seeks to organise society in accordance with its interests.  The organisation will differ accordingly as the revolution has been effected by the soldiers, the Radicals, or the Conservatives, &c.  The new laws and institutions will depend on the interests of the triumphant party and of the classes which have assisted it--the clergy for instance.  If the revolution has triumphed only after a violent struggle, as was the case with the French Revolution, the victors will reject at one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.  The supporters of the fallen regime will be persecuted, exiled, or exterminated.  The maximum of violence in these persecutions is attained when the triumphant party is defending a belief in addition to its material interests.  Then the conquered need hope for no pity. Thus may be explained the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, the autodafes of the Inquisition, the executions of the Convention, and the recent laws against the religious congregations in France.  The absolute power which is assumed by the victors leads them sometimes to extreme measures, such as the Convention's decree that gold was to be replaced by paper, that goods were to be sold at determined prices, &c.  Very soon it runs up against a wall of unavoidable necessities, which turn opinion against its tyranny, and finally leave it defenceless before attack, as befell at the end of the French Revolution.  The same thing happened recently to a Socialist Australian ministry composed almost exclusively of working-men.  It enacted laws so absurd, and accorded such privileges to the trade unions, that public opinion rebelled against it so unanimously that in three months it was overthrown.  But the cases we have considered are exceptional.  The majority of revolutions have been accomplished in order to place a new sovereign in power.  Now this sovereign knows very well that the first condition of maintaining his power consists in not too exclusively favouring a single class, but in seeking to conciliate all.  To do this he will establish a sort of equilibrium between them, so as not to be dominated by any one of these classes.  To allow one class to become predominant is to condemn himself presently to accept that class as his master. This law is one of the most certain of political psychology.  The kings of France understood it very well when they struggled so energetically against the encroachments first of the nobility and then of the clergy.  If they had not done so their fate would have been that of the German Emperors of the Middle Ages, who, excommunicated by the Pope, were reduced, like Henry IV. at Canossa, to make a pilgrimage and humbly to sue for the Pope's forgiveness.  This same law has continually been verified during the course of history.  When at the end of the Roman Empire the military caste became preponderant, the emperors depended entirely upon their soldiers, who appointed and deposed them at will.  It was therefore a great advantage for France that she was so long governed by a monarch almost absolute, supposed to hold his power by divine right, and surrounded therefore by a considerable prestige.  Without such an authority he could have controlled neither the feudal nobility, nor the clergy, nor the parliaments.  If Poland, towards the end of the sixteenth century, had also possessed an absolute and respected monarchy, she would not have descended the path of decadence which led to her disappearance from the map of Europe.  We have shewn in this chapter that political revolutions may be accompanied by important social transformations.  We shall soon see how slight are these transformations compared to those produced by religious revolutions.    CHAPTER II  RELIGIOUS REVOLUTIONS  1.  The importance of the study of Religious Revolutions in respect of the comprehension of the great Political Revolutions.   A portion of this work will be devoted to the French Revolution. It was full of acts of violence which naturally had their psychological causes.  These exceptional events will always fill us with astonishment, and we even feel them to be inexplicable.  They become comprehensible, however, if we consider that the French Revolution, constituting a new religion, was bound to obey the laws which condition the propagation of all beliefs.  Its fury and its hecatombs will then become intelligible.  In studying the history of a great religious revolution, that of the Reformation, we shall see that a number of psychological elements which figured therein were equally active during the French Revolution.  In both we observe the insignificant bearing of the rational value of a belief upon its propagation, the inefficacy of persecution, the impossibility of tolerance between contrary beliefs, and the violence and the desperate struggles resulting from the conflict of different faiths.  We also observe the exploitation of a belief by interests quite independent of that belief.  Finally we see that it is impossible to modify the convictions of men without also modifying their existence.  These phenomena verified, we shall see plainly why the gospel of the Revolution was propagated by the same methods as all the religious gospels, notably that of Calvin.  It could not have been propagated otherwise.  But although there are close analogies between the genesis of a religious revolution, such as the Reformation, and that of a great political revolution like our own, their remote consequences are very different, which explains the difference of duration which they display.  In religious revolutions no experience can reveal to the faithful that they are deceived, since they would have to go to heaven to make the discovery.  In political revolutions experience quickly demonstrates the error of a false doctrine and forces men to abandon it. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],["title","The Psychology of Revolution (#4)"],["body"," Thus at the end of the Directory the application of Jacobin beliefs had led France to such a degree of ruin, poverty, and despair that the wildest Jacobins themselves had to renounce their system.  Nothing survived of their theories except a few principles which cannot be verified by experience, such as the universal happiness which equality should bestow upon humanity.   2.  The beginnings of the Reformation and its first disciples.   The Reformation was finally to exercise a profound influence upon the sentiments and moral ideas of a great proportion of mankind. Modest in its beginnings, it was at first a simple struggle against the abuses of the clergy, and, from a practical point of view, a return to the prescriptions of the Gospel.  It never constituted, as has been claimed, an aspiration towards freedom of thought.  Calvin was as intolerant as Robespierre, and all the theorists of the age considered that the religion of subjects must be that of the prince who governed them.  Indeed in every country where the Reformation was established the sovereign replaced the Pope of Rome, with the same rights and the same powers.  In France, in default of publicity and means of communication, the new faith spread slowly enough at first.  It was about 1520 that Luther recruited a few adepts, and only towards 1535 was the new belief sufficiently widespread for men to consider it necessary to burn its disciples.  In conformity with a well-known psychological law, these executions merely favoured the propagation of the Reformation. Its first followers included priests and magistrates, but were principally obscure artisans.  Their conversion was effected almost exclusively by mental contagion and suggestion.  As soon as a new belief extends itself, we see grouped round it many persons who are indifferent to the belief, but who find in it a pretext or opportunity for gratifying their passions or their greed.  This phenomenon was observed at the time of the Reformation in many countries, notably in Germany and in England.  Luther having taught that the clergy had no need of wealth, the German lords found many merits in a faith which enabled them to seize upon the goods of the Church.  Henry VIII. enriched himself by a similar operation.  Sovereigns who were often molested by the Pope could as a rule only look favourably upon a doctrine which added religious powers to their political powers and made each of them a Pope.  Far from diminishing the absolutism of rulers, the Reformation only exaggerated it.   3.  Rational value of the doctrines of the Reformation.   The Reformation overturned all Europe, and came near to ruining France, of which it made a battle-field for a period of fifty years.  Never did a cause so insignificant from the rational point of view produce such great results.  Here is one of the innumerable proofs of the fact that beliefs are propagated independently of all reason.  The theological doctrines which aroused men's passions so violently, and notably those of Calvin, are not even worthy of examination in the light of rational logic.  Greatly concerned about his salvation, having an excessive fear of the devil, which his confessor was unable to allay, Luther sought the surest means of pleasing God that he might avoid Hell.  Having commenced by denying the Pope the right to sell indulgences, he presently entirely denied his authority, and that of the Church, condemned religious ceremonies, confession, and the worship of the saints, and declared that Christians should have no rules of conduct other than the Bible.  He also considered that no one could be saved without the grace of God.  This last theory, known as that of predestination, was in Luther rather uncertain, but was stated precisely by Calvin, who made it the very foundation of a doctrine to which the majority of Protestants are still subservient.  According to him: ``From all eternity God has predestined certain men to be burned and others to be saved.''  Why this monstrous iniquity?  Simply because ``it is the will of God.''  Thus according to Calvin, who for that matter merely developed certain assertions of St. Augustine, an all-powerful God would amuse Himself by creating living beings simply in order to burn them during all eternity, without paying any heed to their acts or merits.  It is marvellous that such revolting insanity could for such a length of time subjugate so many minds--marvellous that it does so still.[1]    [1] The doctrine of predestination is still taught in Protestant catechisms, as is proved by the following passage extracted from the last edition of an official catechism for which I sent to Edinburgh:  ``By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life, and others foreordained to everlasting death.  ``These angels and men, thus predestinated and foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed; and their number is so certain and definite that it cannot be either increased or diminished.  ``Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to His eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of His will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of His mere free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him thereunto; and all to the praise of his glorious grace.  ``As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath He, by the eternal and most free purpose of His will, foreordained all the means thereunto.  Wherefore they who are elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ; are effectually called unto faith in Christ by His spirit working in due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept by His power through faith unto salvation.  Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.''    The psychology of Calvin is not without affinity with that of Robespierre.  Like the latter, the master of the pure truth, he sent to death those who would not accept his doctrines.  God, he stated, wishes ``that one should put aside all humanity when it is a question of striving for his glory.''  The case of Calvin and his disciples shows that matters which rationally are the most contradictory become perfectly reconciled in minds which are hypnotised by a belief.  In the eyes of rational logic, it seems impossible to base a morality upon the theory of predestination, since whatever they do men are sure of being either saved or damned.  However, Calvin had no difficulty in erecting a most severe morality upon this totally illogical basis.  Considering themselves the elect of God, his disciples were so swollen by pride and the sense of their own dignity that they felt obliged to serve as models in their conduct.   4.  Propagation of the Reformation.   The new faith was propagated not by speech, still less by process of reasoning, but by the mechanism described in our preceding work: that is, by the influence of affirmation, repetition, mental contagion, and prestige.  At a much later date revolutionary ideas were spread over France in the same fashion.  Persecution, as we have already remarked, only favoured this propagation.  Each execution led to fresh conversions, as was seen in the early years of the Christian Church.  Anne Dubourg, Parliamentary councillor, condemned to be burned alive, marched to the stake exhorting the crowd to be converted.  ``His constancy,'' says a witness, ``made more Protestants among the young men of the colleges than the books of Calvin.''  To prevent the condemned from speaking to the people their tongues were cut out before they were burned.  The horror of their sufferings was increased by attaching the victims to an iron chain, which enabled the executioners to plunge them into the fire and withdraw them several times in succession.  But nothing induced the Protestants to retract, even the offer of an amnesty after they had felt the fire.  In 1535 Francis I., forsaking his previous tolerance, ordered six fires to be lighted simultaneously in Paris.  The Convention, as we know, limited itself to a single guillotine in the same city. It is probable that the sufferings of the victims were not very excruciating; the insensibility of the Christian martyrs had already been remarked.  Believers are hypnotised by their faith, and we know to-day that certain forms of hypnotism engender complete insensibility.  The new faith progressed rapidly.  In 1560 there were two thousand reformed churches in France, and many great lords, at first indifferent enough, adhered to the new doctrine.   5.  Conflict between different religious beliefs--Impossibility of Tolerance.   I have already stated that intolerance is always an accompaniment of powerful religious beliefs.  Political and religious revolutions furnish us with numerous proofs of this fact, and show us also that the mutual intolerance of sectaries of the same religion is always much greater than that of the defenders of remote and alien faiths, such as Islamism and Christianity. In fact, if we consider the faiths for whose sake France was so long rent asunder, we shall find that they did not differ on any but accessory points.  Catholics and Protestants adored exactly the same God, and only differed in their manner of adoring Him. If reason had played the smallest part in the elaboration of their belief, it could easily have proved to them that it must be quite indifferent to God whether He sees men adore Him in this fashion or in that.  Reason being powerless to affect the brain of the convinced, Protestants and Catholics continued their ferocious conflicts. All the efforts of their sovereigns to reconcile them were in vain.
