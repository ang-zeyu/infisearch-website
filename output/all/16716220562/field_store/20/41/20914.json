FIRST SCENE   _At the bottom of the Rhine_   _A greenish twilight, lighter above than below. The upper part is filled with undulating water, which streams respectively from right to left. Towards the bottom the waves resolve themselves into a mist which grows finer as it descends, so that a space, as high as a mans body from the ground, appears to be quite free from the water, which floats like a train of clouds over the gloomy stretch below. Steep rocky peaks jut up everywhere from the depths, and enclose the entire stage. The ground is a wild confusion of jagged rocks, no part of it being quite level, and on every side deeper fisures are indicated by a still denser gloom. Woglinde circles with graceful swimming movements round the central rock._    WOGLINDE        Weia! Waga!       Roll, O ye billows,       Rock ye our cradle!       Wagala weia!   Wallala, weiala, weia!  WELLGUNDE [_From above._        Woglinde, watchest alone?  WOGLINDE        If Wellgunde came we were two.  WELLGUNDE [_Dives down to the rock_.        How keepest thou watch?  WOGLINDE [_Swimming off, eludes her_.        Wary of thee.          [_They playfully tease and chase one another_.  FLOSSHILDE [_From above_.        Heiaha weia!       Ho! ye wild sisters!  WELLGUNDE        Flosshilde, swim!       Woglinde flies:   Help me to hinder her flying.  FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down between the two at play._        The sleeping gold       Badly ye guard;       Watch with more zeal       The slumberer's bed,   Or dear you'll pay for your sport!          [_They swim asunder with merry cries. Flosshilde         tries to catch first the one, then the other.         They elude her, and then combine to chase her,         darting like fish from rock to rock with jests and         laughter. Meanwhile Alberich climbs out of a dark         ravine on to a rock. He pauses, still surrounded         by darkness, and watches the frolic of the         Rhine-Maidens with increasing pleasure._  ALBERICH        Hey, hey! ye nixies!       Ye are a lovely,       Lovable folk!       From Nibelheim's night       Fain would I come,   Would ye be kind to me.          [_The maidens, as soon as they hear Alberich's         voice, stop playing._  WOGLINDE        Hei! Who is there?  WELLGUNDE        A voice! It grows dark!  FLOSSHILDE        Who listens below?          [_They dive down and see the Nibelung._  WOGLINDE and WELLGUNDE        Fie! the loathsome one!  [Illustration: Plate 02, The frolic of the Rhine-Maidens.]  FLOSSHILDE [_Swimming up quickly._        Look to the gold!       Father warned us       Of such a foe.          [Both the others follow her, and all three gather         quickly round the central rock.  ALBERICH        You above there!  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS        What wouldst thou below there?  ALBERICH        Do I spoil sport       By standing and gazing here?       Dived ye but deeper,       Fain the Niblung   Would join in your frolic and play.  WELLGUNDE        He wishes to join us?  WOGLINDE        Is he in jest?  ALBERICH        Ye gleam above me       So glad and fair!       If one would only   Glide down, how close in my arms   Fondly clasped she would be!  FLOSSHILDE        I laugh at my fears:       The foe is in love.  WELLGUNDE        The amorous imp!  WOGLINDE        Let us approach him.          [She sinks down to the top of the rock, whose base         Alberich has reached.  ALBERICH        Lo! one of them comes!  WOGLINDE        Climb up to me here!  ALBERICH          [_Climbs with gnome-like agility, though with         repeated checks, to the summit of the rock.         Irritably._        Horrid rock,       So slippery, slimy!       I slide and slip!       My hands and feet vainly       Attempt to hold on       To the slithery surface!       Vapour damp       Fills up my nostrils--       Accursed sneezing!          [_He has got near Woglinde,_  WOGLINDE [_Laughing._        Sneezing tells       That my suitor comes!  ALBERICH        Be thou my love!       Adorable child!          [_He tries to embrace her._  WOGLINDE [_Escaping from him._        Here thou must woo,       If woo me thou wilt!          [_She swims up to another rock._  ALBERICH [_Scratching his head._        Alas! not yet caught?       Come but closer!       Hard I found   What so lightly thou didst.  WOGLINDE [_Swims to a third rock lower down._        Deeper descend:       Thou'lt certainly seize me!  ALBERICH [_Clambers down quickly._        Down there it is better!  WOGLINDE [_Darts upwards to a higher rock at the side._        But better still higher!  WELLGUNDE AND FLOSSHILDE [_Laughing_        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH        How capture this coy,       Elusive fish?       Wait for me, false one!          [_He tries to climb after her in haste._  WELLGUNDE          [_Has sunk down to a lower rock on the other side._        Heia! my friend there!       Dost thou not hear?  ALBERICH [_Turning round._        What? Didst thou call?  WELLGUNDE        Be counselled by me:       Forsake Woglinde,       Climb up to me now!  ALBERICH          [_Climbs hastily over the river-bottom towards         Wellgunde._        Thou art more comely       Far than that coy one;       Her sheen is duller,       Her skin too smooth.       But thou must deeper       Dive to delight me!  WELLGUNDE          [_Sinking down"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48214"],["title","The Rhinegold & The Valkyrie (#1)"],["body"," she is a little nearer him._         Well, now am I near?  ALBERICH        Not near enough.       Thine arms around me       Tenderly throw,       That I may fondle       Thy neck with my fingers,       And closely may cling   To thy bosom with love and with longing.  WELLGUNDE        Art thou in love?       For love art thou pining?       Approach and show me       Thy face and thy form.       Fie! thou horrible       Hunchback, for shame!

ALBERICH [_Angrily calling after Wellgunde._        Fickle maid!   Bony, cold-blooded fish!       Fair if I seem not,       Pretty and playful       Smooth and sleek--   Hei! if I am so loathsome   Give thy love to the eels!  FLOSSHILDE        What ails thee, dwarf?       Daunted so soon?       Though two have been wooed,       Still a third waits thee,       Solace sweet   Fain at a word to grant!  ALBERICH        Soothing song       Sounds in my ear!       'Twas well I found       Three and not one!   The chance is I charm one of many,   Whilst, single, no one would choose me!       Hither come gliding,       And I will believe!  FLOSSHILDE [_Dives down to Alberich._        How senseless are ye,       Silly sisters,   Not to see he is fair!  ALBERICH [_Hastening towards her._        I well may deem them       Dull and ill-favoured,   Seeing how lovely thou art!  FLOSSHILDE        Sing on! Thy song,       So soft and sweet,   Entrancing sounds in my ear!  ALBERICH [_Caressing her with confidence._        My heart burns       And flutters and fails,   Flattered by praises so sweet!  FLOSSHILDE [_Gently resisting him._        Thy grace and beauty       Make glad my eye;       And thy smile refreshes       My soul like balm          [_She draws him tenderly towards her._        Dearest of men!  ALBERICH        Sweetest of maids!  FLOSSHILDE        Wert thou but mine!  ALBERICH        Wert mine for ever!  FLOSSHILDE [_Ardently._        To be pierced by thy glance,       To be pricked by thy beard,   To see and to feel them for aye!       Might thy hair hard as bristles       Flow ever more   Enraptured Flosshilde wreathing!       And thy form like a frog's,       And the croak of thy voice--       O could I, dumb with amaze,       Marvel forever on these!  WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE          [_Dive down close to them and laugh._        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH [_Starting in alarm._        Wretches, dare ye thus scoff?  FLOSSHILDE [_Suddenly darting away from him._        A suitable end to the song.          [_She swims up quickly with her sisters._  WOGLINDE AND WELLGUNDE [_Laughing._        Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  ALBERICH [_In a wailing voice._        Woe's me! Ah, woe's me!       Alas! Alas!       The third one, so dear,       Does she too betray?       O sly and shameful   Worthless and dissolute wantons!       Live ye on lies   Alone, O ye false nixie brood?

Faint-hearted wooer,       Why couldst not hold   The maid, when won, more fast?       True are we,       And troth we keep   With lovers when once caught.       Grasp then and hold;       Away with all fear!   In the waves we scarce can escape.       Wallala!   Lalaleia! Leialalei!   Heia! Heia! Ha hei!          [_They swim apart hither and thither, now lower,         now higher, to provoke Alberich to give chase._  [Illustration: Plate 03, The Rhine-Maidens teasing Alberich.]  ALBERICH         Fiercely within me        Passionate fires        Consume and flame!        Love and fury,        Wild, resistless,        Lash me to frenzy!   So laugh and lie your fill--        One of you I desire,        And one must yield to my yearning!          [_He starts chasing them with desperate energy.         He climbs with terrible agility, and, springing         from rock to rock, tries to catch one maiden         after another. They keep eluding him with mocking         laughter. He stumbles and falls into the abyss, and         clambers up quickly again and resumes the chase.         They sink down a little towards him; he almost         reaches them, but falls, back again, and once         more tries to catch them. At last he pauses out         of breath, and, foaming with rage, stretches his         clenched fist up towards the maidens._  ALBERICH        If but this fist had one!          [_He remains speechless with rage, gazing upwards,         when he is suddenly attracted and arrested by the         following spectacle. Through the water a light         of continually increasing brilliance breaks from         above, and, at a point near the top of the middle         rock, kindles to a radiant and dazzling golden         gleam. A magical light streams from this through         the waves._  WOGLINDE        Look, sisters!       The wakener laughs to the deep.  WELLGUNDE        Through the billows green       The blissful slumberer greets.  FLOSSHILDE        He kisses the eyelid,       Making it open;       Bathed in splendour,       Behold it smiles,       Sending, like a star,   Gleaming light through the waves.  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS          [_Swimming gracefully round the cliff together._        Heia jaheia!       Heia jaheia!   Wallala la la la leia jahei!       Rhinegold!       Rhinegold!       Radiant delight,   How glorious and glad thy smile,       Over the water   Shooting effulgence afar!       Heia jahei!       Heia jaheia!       Waken, friend!       Wake in joy!       That we may please thee,       Merry we'll play,       Waters afire,       Billows aflame,       As, blissfully bathing,       Dancing and singing,   We dive and encircle thy bed!       Rhinegold!       Rhinegold!       Heia jaheia!       Heia jaheia!   Wallala la la la heia jahei!          [_With increasing mirthful abandonment the maidens         swim round the rock.

THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS        Where dost thou hail from, O churl,       Of the Rhinegold not to have heard?  WELLGUNDE        Knows not the elf       Of the famed eye golden   That wakes and sleeps in turn?  WOGLINDE        Of the star resplendent       Down in the depths   Whose light illumines the waves?  THE THREE RHINE-MAIDENS [_Together_        See how gaily       We glide in the glory!       Wouldst thou also       Be bathed in brightness,   Come, float and frolic with us!   Wallala la la leia lalei!   Wallala la la leia jahei!  ALBERICH        Has the gold no value       Apart from your games?       It were not worth getting!  WOGLINDE        He would not scoff,       Scorning the gold,   Did he but know all its wonders!  WELLGUNDE    That man surely   The earth would inherit       Who from the Rhinegold       Fashioned the ring   Which measureless power imparts.  FLOSSHILDE        Our father told us,       And strictly bade us       Guard with prudence       The precious hoard   That no thief from the water might steal it.   Be still, then, chattering fools.  WELLGUNDE        O prudent sister,       Why chide and reproach?       Hast thou not heard       That one alone   Can hope to fashion the gold?  WOGLINDE        Only the man       Who love defies,       Only the man       From love who flies   Can learn and master the magic   That makes a ring of the gold.  WELLGUNDE        Secure then are we       And free from care:   For love is part of living;   No one would live without loving.  WOGLINDE        And least of all he,       The languishing elf,       With pangs of love       Pining away.  FLOSSHILDE        I fear him not       Who should surely know,       By his savage lust       Almost inflamed.  [Illustration: Plate 04       \"Mock away! Mock away!
