Rescue the gold!     Help us! Help us!     Woe! Woe!\"]     SECOND SCENE   _The waves have gradually changed into clouds which, becoming lighter and lighter by degrees, finally disperse in a fine mist. As the mist vanishes upwards in light little clouds an open space on a mountain height becomes visible in the dim light which precedes dawn. At one side Wotan with Fricka beside him both asleep, lie on a flowery bank. The dawning day illumines with increasing brightness a castle with glittering pinnacles which stands on the summit of a cliff in the background. Between this and the foreground a deep valley is visible through which the Rhine flows._    FRICKA          [_Awakes; her gaze falls on the castle, which has         become plainly visible; alarmed._  WOTAN [_Continuing to dream._    The happy hall of delight   Is guarded by gate and door:       Manhood's honour,       Power for aye,   Rise to my lasting renown!  FRICKA [_Shakes him._        Up from deceitful       Bliss of a dream!   My husband, wake and consider!  WOTAN          [_Awakes and raises himself slightly. His glance is         immediately arrested by the view of the castle._    The walls everlasting are built!       On yonder summit       The Gods' abode       Proudly rears       Its radiant strength!   As I nursed it in dream   And desired it to be,       Strong it stands,       Fair to behold,   Brave and beautiful pile!  FRICKA        While thou rejoicest,       Joyless am I.       Thou hast thy hall;       My heart fears for Freia.   Heedless one, hast thou forgotten   The price that was to be paid?       The work is finished,       And forfeit the pledge:   Hast thou then no care for the cost?  WOTAN    My bargain well I remember   With them who built the abode.       'Twas a pact tamed them,       The obstinate race,       So that this hallowed       Hall they have built me.   It stands--the strong ones' doing:--   Fret not thou, counting the cost.  FRICKA    O laughing, insolent lightness!   Mirth how cruel and callous!   Had I but known of thy pact,   The trick had never been played;       But far from your counsels       Ye men kept the women,   That, deaf to us and in peace,   Alone ye might deal with the giants.       So without shame       Ye promised them Freia,   Freia, my beautiful sister,   Proud of playing the thief.       What remains holy       Or precious to men   Once grown greedy of might?  WOTAN [_Calmly._        From such greed       Was Fricka then free   Herself when the castle she craved?  FRICKA    I was forced to ponder some means   To keep my husband faithful,   True to me when his fancy   Tempted him far from his home.       Halls high and stately,       Decked to delight thee,       Were to constrain thee       To peaceful repose.   But thou hadst the work designed   Intent on war alone;       It was to add       More to thy might still,       To stir up to tumult still fiercer   That built were the towering walls  WOTAN        Wouldst thou, O Wife!       In the castle confine me,   To me, the god, must be granted,       Faithful at home,       The right to wage war   And conquer the world from without.       Ranging and changing       All men love:   That sport at least thou must leave me.  FRICKA        Cold, hard-hearted,       Merciless man!       For the idle baubles,       Empire and sway,   Thou stakest in insolent scorn   Love and a woman's worth!  WOTAN    When I went wooing, to win thee       I staked ungrudging,   Gladly one of my eyes:   What folly now then to scold!       Women I honour       Beyond thy desire!       I will not abandon       Frei, the fair:   Such never was my intent.  FRICKA          [_ Anxiously looking towards a point not on the         stage._        Then succour her now:       Defenceless, in fear,   Hither she hastens for help!  FREIA          [_Enters as if flying from someone._         Help me, sister!        Shield me, o brother!        From yonder mountain        Menaces Fasolt:    He comes to bear me off captive.  WOTAN        Let him come!       Sawest thou Loge?  FRICKA        To this tricky deceiver       O why wilt thou trust?   He always snares thee anew,   Though from his snares thou hast suffered.  WOTAN    I ask for no aid   Where simple truth suffices;       But to turn the spite       Of foes to profit,   Craft and cunning alone   Can teach, as by Loge employed.   He whose advice I obeyed   Has promised ransom for Freia:   On him my faith I have fixed.  FRICKA    And art left in the lurch.       The giants come.       Lo! hither they stride:   Where lingers now thine ally?  FREIA        Where tarry ye, my brothers,       When help ye should bring me,   Weak and bartered away by my kin?       O help me, Donner!       Hither! Hither!   Rescue Freia, my Froh!  FRICKA    Now the knaves who plotted and tricked thee   Abandon thee in thy need.          [_Fasolt and Fafner, both of gigantic stature,         enter, armed with stout clubs._  FASOLT        Soft sleep       Sealed thine eyes       While we, both sleepless,   Built the castle walls:       Working hard       Wearied not,       Heaping, heaving       Heavy stones.       Tower steep,       Door and gate       Keep and guard   Thy goodly castle halls.          [_Pointing to the castle._        There stands       What we builded,       Shining fair       Beneath the sun.       Enter in   And pay the price!  WOTAN    Name, Workers, your wage.   What payment will appease you?  FASOLT    We made the terms   That seemed to us meet.   Hast thou forgot so soon?       Freia, the fair one,       Holda, the free one--       The bargain is   We bear her away.  WOTAN (Quickly.)        Ye must be mad       To moot such a thing!   Ask some other wage;   Freia I will not grant.  FASOLT          _Stands for a space speechless with angry surprise._        What is this? Ha!       Wouldest deceive?--       Go back on thy bond?       What thy spear wards       Are they but sport,   All the runes of solemn bargain?  FAFNER        O trusty brother!   Fool, dost now see the trick?  FASOLT        Son of light,       Light, unstable,   Hearken! Have a care!   In treaties keep thou troth!       What thou art       Thou art only by treaties,       For, built on bonds,   There are bounds to thy might.       Though cunning thou,       More clever than we:       Though we once freemen,       Are pledged to peace,   Cursed be all thy wisdom;--       Peaceful promises perish!--       Wilt thou not open,   Honest and frank   Stand fast by a bargain once fixed.       A stupid giant       Tells thee this:   O wise one, take it from him!  [Illustration: plate 06, Freia, the fair one]  WOTAN    How sly to judge us serious   When plainly we were but jesting!       The beautiful Goddess       Light and bright--   For churls what charm could she have?  FASOLT        Jeerest thou?       Ha! how unjust!   Ye who by beauty rule,   Proud and radiant race!       How foolish, striving       For towers of stone,   Woman's love to pledge--   Price of walls and of halls!   We dolts, despising ease,   Sweating with toil-hardened hands,       Have worked, that a woman       With gentle delight   In our midst might sojourn   And ye call the pact a jest?  FAFNER    Cease thy childish chatter;   No gain look we to get.       Freia's charms       Mean little;   But it means much,   If from the Gods we remove her.       Golden apples   Ripen within her garden;       She alone   Grows the apples and tends them.       The goodly fruit       Gives to her kinsfolk,       Who eat thereof,       Youth everlasting.       Sick and pale,       Their beauty would perish,       Old and weak,       Wasting away,   Were not Freia among them.          [_Roughly._    From their midst, therefore, Freia must forth!  WOTAN [_Aside._        Loge lingers long!  FASOLT        We wait for thy word!  WOTAN        Ask some other wage!  FASOLT        No other: Freia alone!  FAFNER        Thou there, follow us!          [_Fafner and Fasolt press towards Freia. Froh and         Donner enter in haste._  FREIA        Help! Help from the harsh ones!  FROH        To me, Freia!          [_Clasping Freia in his arms._ [_To Fafner._        Back, overbold one!       Froh shields the fair one!  DONNER [_Confronting the giants._        Fasolt and Fafner,       Have ye not felt   With what weight my hammer falls?  FAFNER        What means thy threat?  FASOLT        What wouldst thou here?   No strife we desire;   We want but our due reward.  DONNER        Oft I've doled out       Giants their due:   Come, your reward is here   Waiting, full measure and more!          [_He swings his hammer._  WOTAN          [_Stretching out his spear between the combatants._        Hold, thou fierce one!       Nothing by force!       All bonds and treaties       My spear protects;   Spare then thy hammer's haft!  FREIA        Woe's me! Woe's me!       Wotan forsakes me!  FRICKA        Can such be thy thought,       Merciless man?  WOTAN          [_Turns away and sees Loge coming._         There comes Loge!       Hot is thy haste       Smoothly to settle   Thy sorry, badly-made bargain!  LOGE          [_Has come up out of the valley in the background._        What is this bargain       That I am blamed for?--       The one with the giants   That thou thyself didst decide?

Donner and Froh,   They dream but of roof and room:       Wedding, must have   A home in which to dwell,       A stately hall,       A fortress fast.   It was such Wotan wished.       Hall and house,       Castle, court,       The blissful abode   Now stands complete and strong.       I proved the lordly       Pile myself;       In fear of flaws,       Scanning it close.       Fasolt and Fafner       Faithful I found;   Firm-bedded is each stone.       I was not slothful       Like many here:   Who calls me sluggard, he lies!  WOTAN        Cunningly       Thou wouldst escape!       Warned be, and wisely   Turn from attempts to deceive.       Of all the Gods       I alone stood by thee       As thy friend,   In the gang that trusted thee not.   Now speak, and to the point!   For when the builders at first   As wage Freia demanded,       I gave way only,       Trusting thy word   When thou didst solemnly promise   To ransom the noble pledge.  LOGE        Perplexed to puzzle,       Plans to ponder       For its redeeming--   That promise I gave;       But to discover       What cannot be,       What none can do,   No man can possibly promise.  FRICKA        See the treacherous       Rogue thou didst trust!  FROH        Named art Loge,       But liar I call thee!  DONNER        Accursèd flame,       I will quench thy fire!  LOGE        From their shame to shelter,       Foolish folk flout me.          [_Donner threatens to strike Loge._  WOTAN          [_Stepping between them._    Forbear and let him alone!   Ye wot not Loge's wiles.       His advice,       Given slowly, gains   Both in weight and in worth.  FAFNER        Do not dally;       Promptly pay!  FASOLT      Long waits our reward.  WOTAN          _Turns sternly to Loge._        Speak up surly one!       Fail me not!   How far hast thou ranged and roamed?  LOGE        Still with reproach       Is Loge paid!       Concerned but for thee,       Thorough and swift,       I searched and ransacked       To the ends of the earth   To find a ransom for Freia   Fair to the giants and just.       In vain the search,       Convincing at last       That the world contains       Nothing so sweet   That a man will take it instead   Of woman's love and delight.          [_All seem surprised and taken aback._    Where life moves and has being,   In water, earth and air       I questioned,       Asking of all things,       Where weak still is strength,       And germs only stirring,       What men thought dear--       And stronger deemed--   Than woman's love and delight.   But where life moves and has being       My questions met       But with laughter and scorn.       In water, earth and air       Woman and love       Will none forego.          [_Varied gestures of amazement._        One man, one only,       I met who, renouncing love,       Prized ruddy gold   Above any woman's grace.   The Rhine's pure-gleaming children   Told me of their sorrow.       The Nibelung,       Night-Alberich,       Wooed for the favour       Of the swimmers in vain,       And vengeance took,   Stealing the Rhinegold they guard.       He thinks it now       A thing beyond price,   Greater than woman's grace.       For their glittering toy       Thus torn from the deep   The sorrowful maids lamented.       They pray, Wotan,       Pleading to thee,   That thy wrath may fall on the robber       The gold too       They would have thee grant them       To guard in the water for ever.       Loge promised       The maidens to tell thee,   And, keeping faith, he has told.  [Illustration: plate 07     \"The Rhine's pure-gleaming children      Told me of their sorrow\"]  WOTAN        Dull thou must be       Or downright knavish!   In parlous plight myself,   What help have I for others?  FASOLT          [_Who has been listening attentively, to Fafner._        The Niblung has much annoyed us;       I greatly grudge him this Rhinegold;       But such his craft and cunning,       He has never been caught.  FAFNER        Other malice       Ponders the Niblung;   Gains he might from gold       Listen, Loge!       Tell us the truth.   What wondrous gift has the gold,   That the dwarf desires it so?  LOGE        A plaything,       In the waves providing   Children with laughter and sport,       It gives, when to golden       Ring it is rounded,   Power and might unmatched;   It wins its owner the world.  WOTAN [_Thoughtfully._        Rumours I have heard       Of the Rhinegold;       Runes of riches   Hide in its ruddy glow;       Pelf and power   Are by the ring bestowed.  FRICKA [_Softly to Loge._        Could this gaud,       This gleaming trinket       Forged from the gold,   Be worn by a woman too?  LOGE        The wife who wore       That glittering charm       Never would lose       Her husband's love--   That charm which dwarfs are welding,   Working in thrall to the ring.  FRICKA [_Coaxingly to Wotan._        O could but my husband       Come by the ring!  WOTAN          _As if falling more and more under the influence of         a spell._        Methinks it were wisdom,   Won I the ring to my service.       But say, Loge,       How shall I learn   To forge and fashion it true?  LOGE        A magic rune   Can round the golden ring.       No one knows it,   Yet plain the spell to him   Who happy love forswears.          [_Wotan turns away in annoyance._        That suits thee not;       Thou art too late too.   Alberich did not delay;       Fearless he mastered       The potent spell,          [_Harshly._    And wrought aright was the ring.  DONNER _To Wotan._        We should all be       Under the dwarf,   Were not the ring from him wrested.  WOTAN        The ring I must capture!  FROH        Lightly now,   Without cursing love it were won.  LOGE        Just so:   Without guile, as in children's games!  WOTAN        Then tell us how.  LOGE          By theft!       What a thief stole       Steal thou from the thief;   How better could object be won?       But with baleful arms       Battles Alberich.       Wary, wise       Must be thy scheming,   If the thief thou wouldst confound,          _With warmth._        And restore the ruddy       And golden toy,   The Rhinegold, to the maidens.   For this they pray and implore.  WOTAN        The river-maidens?       What profit were mine?  FRICKA        Of that billow-born brood       Bring me no tidings,       For they have wooed       To my woe   Full many a man to their caves.          _Wotan stands silent, struggling with himself. The         other Gods gaze at him in mute suspense. Fafner,         meanwhile, has been consulting aside with Fasolt._  FAFNER        Worth far more than Freia       Were the glittering gold.       Eternal youth, too, were his       Who could use the charm in its quest.          [_Fasolt's gestures indicate that he is being         convinced against his will. Fafner and Fasolt         approach Wotan again._  FAFNER        Hear, Wotan,       Our word while we wait;   Freia we will restore you,       And will take       Paltrier payment:   The Niblung's red-gleaming gold   Will guerdon us giants rude.  WOTAN        Ye must be mad!       With what I possess not   How can I, shameless ones, pay you?  FAFNER        Hard labour       Went to those walls;       How easy       With fraud-aided force   (What our malice never achieved)   The Niblung to break and bind!  [Illustration: Plate 08, Fasolt suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to one side with Fafner]  WOTAN [_More quickly._        Why should I make       War on the Niblung?--   Fight, your foe to confound?       Insolent       And greedily grasping   Dolts you grow through my debt!  FASOLT          [_Suddenly seizes Freia and drags her to one side         with Fafner._        Maiden, come!       We claim thee ours!   As pledge thou shalt be held   Till the ransom is paid.  FREIA [_Screaming_.    Woe's me! Woe's me! Woe!  FAFNER        From your midst       We bear her forth!   Till evening--mark it well I--   As a pledge she is ours.       We will return then.       But when we come,   If the Rhinegold be not ready,   The Rhinegold bright and red--  FASOLT        The respite is ended,       Freia is forfeit   And bides among us for aye!  FREIA        Sister! Brothers!       Save me! Help!          [_The giants hasten off, dragging Freia with them._  FROH        Up! Follow fast!  DONNER        Fall now the heavens!          [_They look inquiringly at Wotan._  FREIA [_In the distance._        Save me! Help!  LOGE [_Looking after the giants._    Downward over stock and stone       Striding they go;   Through the ford across the Rhine       Wade now the robbers.       Sad at heart       Hangs Freia,   Thrown rudely over rough shoulders!       Heia! hei!   The louts, how they lumber along!   Through the Rhine valley they reel.       Not till Riesenheim's march       Is reached will they rest!          [_He turns to the Gods._     How darkly Wotan doth dream!   What ails the high, happy Gods?          [_A pale mist, gradually increasing in density,         fills the stage. Seen through it the Gods look more         and more wan and aged. All stand in dismay and         apprehension regarding Wotan, whose eyes are fixed         broodingly on the ground._  LOGE         Does a mist mock me?        Tricks me a dream?        Dismayed and wan,        How swiftly ye fade!    Lo! the bloom forsakes your cheeks,    And quenched is the light of your eyes!        Courage, Froh!    Day's but begun!
