When one was struck down and unable to give or receive orders, another took his place automatically, and was obeyed implicitly and instantly.  In one battalion only two officers survived.  In some other battalions the losses have been very severe.  One lost three-quarters of its strength. But the morale of all ranks was unimpaired, and the troops, who had endured this day an experience which might well weaken the purpose of the strongest and stoutest, were fit and ready at dawn on the morrow to undertake a counter-attack.                                      *II.*   _June 4th._  That Friday night, while the enemy was preparing to hold his new front, and the stretcher-bearers and Red Cross workers on both sides were bringing in their wounded and dead, General Sir Julian Byng, the Corps Commander, was planning a counter-attack to recover the ground which had been lost.  This attack was delayed for some hours, owing to the necessity for assembling artillery in such force as to silence the enemy, who still maintained a vigorous and occasionally an intense bombardment.  The advance was timed for six o’clock in the morning, but still the barrage did not lift, and it was nearly half-past nine when our troops moved forward in earnest.  These troops belonged to the First and Third Divisions, but the brunt of the fighting was borne by survivors of the 7th and 8th Brigades of the latter Division, assisted by two companies of the King’s Royal Rifles, an Imperial regiment which had been serving in the Salient to the left of the Canadian troops.  A bombardment of a vigour almost equal to that of the Germans of the previous day created a shelter for our advancing battalions. The enemy guns replied, and at one time the spectacle was witnessed of a double barrage of appalling intensity.  None the less, the Canadians pushed on, and after fighting all day succeeded in reaching a portion of their old front-line trenches in the northern section.  On the way thither they came across numbers of enemy dead lying about unburied.  But the trenches were battered to pieces, and our troops were not in sufficient strength to hold on until the works could be reconstructed.  The same was true of the battalions of the 8th Brigade, who advanced south of Maple Copse and east of Warrington Avenue, although the 49th Battalion, which had lost its commanding officer, Colonel Baker, struggled valiantly for a time to maintain itself.  The upshot was that we were forced back to a new front line of trenches near Zillebeke.  The losses of these two days have been grievous--some 7,000 killed and wounded.  It is to-day known that the commander of the heroic Third Canadian Division, Major-General Mercer, has fallen.  Just as the Huns were making their advance at half-past one o’clock, the General was seen supporting himself against a parapet at the entrance of a dug-out known as the Tube, suffering from shell shock, and there beyond doubt he met his death, and there his body lies buried.  A brigade commander and a battalion commander were taken prisoners.  Two other colonels, Buller and Baker, have been slain.  The earth is all torn, seared, and fretted hereabouts, but a surprising amount of timber still stands.  All through those two fierce days’ fighting, wounded men were crawling about or lying motionless for hours, either helpless or to avoid observation.  One man told me he had spent two nights on his back in No Man’s Land without food, drink, or succour. Another was thrice buried by the effects of the much-vaunted minenwerfer shell--which ploughs up the surrounding earth--and thrice dug out by a passing officer. Machine-guns were repeatedly buried, and then rapidly and diligently excavated and brought by our gallant fellows again into action, much to the enemy’s amazement and discomfiture.  It is now Sunday afternoon at Corps Headquarters.  As I write, staff officers hurry to and fro; occasionally a general or a battalion commander dashes by, all deeply preoccupied and intent on the business in hand.  Some of them have not slept for three days.  The troops who have borne the brunt are now going into rest billets.  As to these two days’ struggle, if you were to take all the actions along the British front from the very beginning, there is none that illustrates so vividly, so intensely, the whole character of the fighting in this War.  It combines the essential features of all, with the exception of poison gas.  Brief, compact, and murderous, it was by far the greatest artillery ordeal to which the Canadians have yet been subjected.  As an exhibition of German frightfulness on the one hand, and British steadfastness on the other, it is unsurpassed in the War. \"Comparable only to Verdun,\" is the comment to me of a distinguished commander, when I mentioned the fury of the German bombardment.  Down the road leading from the battle front to the divisional headquarters appears the head of a long column of mud-stained, grimy-faced Canadians, with rusty, tattered accoutrements, their heads in the air, still keeping step, and singing--actually singing--with a sort of wild humour and abandon. And one catches the sound, not of the \"Maple Leaf for Ever,\" or \"My Little Grey Home in the West,\" but of the latest London music-hall ditty--the one a famous comedian chants nightly at the Alhambra:      \"If you were the only girl in the world,     And I were the only boy!\"   But make no mistake about it--retribution is in the air.  Look into the men’s eyes, and their glances tell the same tale.  The men are excited--they are feverish; all this that you see is reaction.  They know, every man of them, the game is only just begun.  The question is: How long will the German be permitted to hold on to his winnings?  I have just had a brief interview with the Corps commander, Sir Julian Byng, who gave me this message:--   \"I am proud of the Canadians under my command.  Their behaviour has been magnificent.  I have never known, not even at Vimy Ridge, a fiercer or more deadly barrage, nor have I ever seen any troops fight with more earnestness, courage, endurance, and cheerfulness.  It is regrettable that our losses are heavy, but the slight penetration of our line will cost the Germans dear.\"   Yes; it is possible that the battle is only just begun.  The next few hours may reveal much, but it will reveal no secret of German strategy for which we shall not be fully prepared.                                      *III.*   _June 7th._  It is all a question of artillery preparation. The enemy momentarily holds a large portion of the ground formerly held by us.  It is only a few acres, when all is said, but it is as precious to us as our life-blood.  We have been given a charge to keep, and the honour of Canada is involved in our keeping it intact.  Evidently the Hun commander had convinced himself that here was a vulnerable point in the British line, and he delivered a ruthless onslaught.  It was carefully planned and meditated; this is clearly demonstrated by the enormous weight of metal, which must have been accumulating for weeks.  The bombardment of June 2nd was without a parallel even in this shell-devastated region, and yesterday he repeated it.  Four mines were exploded directly under our front trenches at Hooge, and he pressed forward a few steps further and captured the ruins of the hamlet.  Two short years ago the Chateau of Hooge and all the land hereabouts belonged to a Belgian nobleman, the Baron de Vinck, who dwelt here with his family and dependents. Now his chateau is as immortal as Hougoumont. Thrilling scenes have been enacted in this park--the flower of the chivalry of England and France have perished in its defence.  Hooge was on October 30th, 1914, the headquarters of the 1st and 2nd Divisions. On that day General Lomax was wounded, General Munro stunned, and six staff officers killed.  It was once also the headquarters of Byng’s 3rd Cavalry Division.  On this very ground that we are now again fighting to recover, on November 6th, 1914, the 1st and 2nd Life Guards and the Blues advanced to make their never-to-be-forgotten stand against the Prussian Guards, who fought under their Emperor’s eye.  It was to Hooge that were borne the dead bodies of Fitzclarence, Cavendish, Wellesley, Wyndham, Cadogan, Gordon-Lennox, Hay, Kinnaird, Bruce, and Fraser, and not far from there they are chiefly interred. Close at hand also is the grave of the brave young Prince Maurice of Battenberg.  It has long since--chateau, hamlet, and wood--been smashed to fragments by their guns; but we continued to hold it, and now it is theirs.  It is of no strategical significance, perhaps, but it brings them nearer to Ypres, and the graves of so many of our heroic dead.  From the hill where I am stationed, the line of the new German trenches is clearly visible, even if it were not indicated by their shell-fire, which just now continues particularly hot in the neighbourhood of St. Eloi.  Our line has been slightly indented, but the high ground to the east was already theirs, from which they could belch forth all their artillery resources, and it is difficult to see what strategical advantage they have gained from their late bloody effort.  From all I can gather, the cost to them in casualties, as well as ammunition, has been very great--much greater than was first supposed.  Earlier in the war the shelling I am now witnessing at the turn in the loop which encloses this blood-stained amphitheatre of three thousand acres would have seemed a serious bombardment.  Now it is merely an artillery diversion.  Twenty thousand Canadian soldiers, hidden in what seems an absolutely deserted plain, are looking upwards at those great white or yellow puffs of smoke with quiet unconcern, awaiting the appointed hour. For the present, the Boche has done his worst. He has given a violent tug at the loop, and if he has"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46256"],["title","In the Ypres Salient (#4)"],["body"," it by a few inches, it is possible it has also made it stronger.  It has cost him thousands of lives and yielded him a few battered trenches and a brick-heap.  Elsewhere on the British front numerous raids, adroitly planned by us, and almost invariably successful, have been the order of the day.  At one point an enormous white placard has been exhibited on the enemy parapet:                         ENGLISCH--TAKE WARNUNG BY                            KITCHENER’S FATE.                          GERMANY IS INVINCIBLE.   It is impossible to reproduce the character or the spelling, both of which were atrocious. This was brought in by a raiding party, and provoked infinite amusement amongst our men.  [Illustration: Map--Ypres and area]                                      *IV.*   _June 14th._  The expected has happened.  The Canadians, chafing over the results of the fierce German offensive of the past ten days, successfully carried through in the early hours of yesterday morning a counter-attack which restored every rod of valuable ground they had lost.  Observatory Ridge, the whole of Armagh Wood, and the uplands to the south, including Mount Sorel, are again firmly in our hands.  It was a most brilliant feat of arms.  The night was wet, cold, and thoroughly disagreeable, but the men were in the highest possible spirits at the prospect of an advance to recover their old position. This time our artillery was fully prepared, and at 1.30 o’clock in the morning, under cover of a heavy fire, the advance began.  A fresh Canadian division had been sent into the Salient, and there remained a mixed brigade of those Canadian mounted troops who have figured in the recent fighting.  General Lipsett, the new divisional commander appointed to succeed General Mercer, deferred taking up his command in order to lead his old brigade into action.  To three battalions the attack was mainly entrusted.  A fourth battalion to the right, opposite Hill 60, provided a diversion for the enemy, so as to protect the attacking battalions from being enfiladed, while on the extreme left, where there was less ground to be retaken, a fifth battalion advanced.  The orders were to take three lines of trenches, and to establish bomb posts in the fourth.  These four trenches were (1) the new German front line which they had recently made, (2) our old reserve trench, (3) our old support trench, and (4) our old front line.  The troops pressed forward, the Germans felling back sullenly under the impetuosity of the attack.  Some fierce fighting took place here and there in the territory south of Warrington Avenue, especially for the possession of Observatory Ridge, but the enemy seemed helpless before the fury of our impetus.  Early in the engagement, two of his guns mounted on high ground south of the famous \"Appendix\" fell into our hands, and we then learned from men captured there that the Germans actually had planned a further attack upon our lines at that point, to take place at 6.30 that very morning.  Owing to circumstances over which they had no control, it has been postponed.  \"My battalion,\" narrates one officer who greatly distinguished himself this day, \"went forward in four waves, two under Major Kemp and two under Major McCuaig. The first of the trenches was taken without opposition.  It had been practically obliterated by our artillery. While we were taking this trench, the artillery lifted until 1.50, to give us time to reach the second trench, which we also took with little opposition.  Major Kemp was hit before we reached the first trench.  The third trench was taken by the first three waves, supported by the fourth.\"  But it was here that opposition was encountered.  A Boche machine-gun on the left had been dragged up from below, and ably handled by a Boche sergeant, whose face was streaming with blood, enfiladed our line in a most disastrous manner.  Four of our advancing officers were struck down, and for a few moments it looked as though that single weapon was going to check this part of the line.  \"Silence that Hun machine!  Put it out of action!\" roared one of our officers.  And a machine-gun officer, Lieutenant Hamilton, ran backwards with a single private, armed with bombs, and charged the Boche offender in the dark, guided only by his own fire.  Their first bomb killed the sergeant, but another sprang in his place, and the crew had to be beaten off with fists and the butt of a revolver.  The gun was captured, mounted, and trained on the enemy.  Meanwhile Lieutenant Giveen, the bombing officer, having been killed, his place was filled by Lieutenant Saunders, who led a bombing party up the communication trench to the fourth and foremost trench, which was the front Canadian line of ten days ago. Having rapidly issued instructions to his men to establish blocks, the gallant Saunders could not refrain from raising a cheer of triumph. At that very moment he was struck down, probably by a bomb.  He had led the way, and others followed, and a red rocket, sent up by Major McCuaig’s orders, announced to those behind that the final objective of the counter-attack had been reached.  In less than ten minutes a party of engineers and a company of pioneers, armed with picks and shovels, were on the spot, and the work of digging in--of \"consolidating\"--began.  All this while another force had been toiling madly at digging out the third line of trenches. Communication was established at dawn with the battalions to right and left, who had also advanced under the same difficulties, and suffering heavy losses, which were to be heavier during that terrible day when the Germans began their bombardment.  The rain continued to descend pitilessly, there was nothing visible anywhere but a sea and watersheds of mud, ploughed and churned by shells and bombs, and strewn with corpses and the litter of a battlefield.  When the men sat down to rest, their hips were sunk in heavy brown slime.  Yet even under such conditions the spirit of the men was amazing.  As one of their officers has declared--  \"Even men who had joined as reinforcements a month ago behaved like old and seasoned soldiers.\"  A Vancouver officer bears similar testimony.  \"When we reached the German front line,\" he states, \"there was no trench left. We met with no opposition, the Germans at first seeming to be too dazed by the heavy fire to which they had been subjected to do anything. The ground, as we advanced, was in a frightful state, all in holes, which were made the more trying by the pouring rain.  We should never have got through had it not been for the splendid work of the artillery, for progress through this ploughed up mud was slow.  We took some fifty to sixty prisoners. All the men were keen as mustard.  Some of the newly-joined had never been in a serious engagement before, but they were just as steady as the old hands.\"  Another says: \"The trenches were in a sad state, and conditions generally bad.  The men had to sleep anyhow in the open.  We lost pretty severely, in coming up, through shells.  When at length we advanced, we went forward so rapidly that we were through the first trench and up the hill before the Germans realised what was happening.  Our losses here were comparatively slight.  At length we reached our old front line, where we attacked with bombs and bayonets.  The Germans made an effort at a counter-attack, but it was easily handled by our bombers. We were relieved that night.  The ground, I should add, was in an awful state. One of our men who had sunk deeply in the mud during the advance was discovered still tightly held in the mire afterwards, when two men pulled him out.\"  Another officer of the same battalion said that the bombing battalion on their right did its work very effectively, and kept the Germans on Hill 60 well occupied.  After reaching the objective, this battalion had some stiff fighting on the extreme right, the Germans counter-attacking with bombs.  But soon the old British line was made tenable with sandbags. The Germans came back twice, and had to be bombed out of the German front line, and even then some came back again.  After the last trench had been taken, the Germans shelled it heavily, and there were many casualties.  The men behaved with great gallantry, and were crazy to reach the German trenches. At one time four different men of the battalion went out of the trench after a wounded comrade, and all were killed in the attempt to save him.  The wounded man was subsequently brought in at night.  \"Lord, it was fine,\" relates still another officer who was in the thick of the fighting. \"I could feel that terrible fretting of the past week just oozing out as the boys jumped the parapets and smashed across to where our old first line had been.  I don’t think anything could have stopped them.  I didn’t get in with the first bunch, because my company was held on the edge, watching for the counter-attack, if it came too soon for our fellows to make a stand.  \"When we got going we went through the Germans like a knife through cheese. They didn’t know what to do with us but throw down their rifles and bolt, or hold up their hands.  They said we ran.  You should have seen them skedoodle for home and ma, what didn’t throw themselves on the ground and beg to be taken.  We went clean to the old line, and captured some hundreds of prisoners.  Our artillery had kept them from doing much in the digging-in line, and so we had a chance to slam them good and plenty. And you bet we did.  \"Then we had to take ours.  They had the range of us to a nicety, and they gave us particular hell with shell-fire for days before and during the assault.  When we went up and took over the line from the assaulting troops, we had to take another dose of iron which the Huns put on while they were getting their counter-attack ready.  But the counter-attack never came off--at least, not what we’d call an attack.  Our artillery got them in the belt and cut them up too bad"]]]
