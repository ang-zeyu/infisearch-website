Nancy looked at the guns with some apprehension. She would be truly glad when this was over. Shorty was all a-jitter again.  “Nancy, I’ll run close to you,” she said.  “Sure,” agreed Nancy, recalling their trying time at the gas chamber.  “Somehow I always feel safer when you’re around.”  At the signal they were off across the corn stubble left from last year’s harvest. As a child, Nancy had read how that other Nancy—Nancy Hart, and other women of Georgia, advancing in a field of corn stubble had taken part in the battle of Kettle Creek, and driven the British from upper Georgia during the Revolution. How little she had dreamed that she, another Nancy, six generations later, would be rehearsing for battle in a war for liberty that encircled the globe in just such a field.  The nurses had run only about a hundred feet when there came a roar of gunfire behind and far overhead. Almost everyone wondered if her neighbor had been struck as she saw her dive for the earth.  “Golly Moses!” groaned Mabel. “I’m scared stiff!”  Nancy giggled nervously as she turned to see her pal’s forehead smeared with dirt where she had tried to go through the corn furrow.  “Exciting, but awful!” she agreed.  At the sound of the whistle they were off again. Over and over the gruelling performance was repeated. Then they had to turn and come back across the field in the face of the fire. Nancy found this easier. At least they could see that the shots were going far above their heads.  Most of them came in across the goal line triumphantly, though some were slightly hysterical between laughter and fear. Only two or three staggered back, tense and shaken.  During the rest of the afternoon their men instructors gave them illustrations of jungle camouflage. In the densely wooded section below the pine thicket and bordering a creek, they had to try to locate a half dozen men whose helmets and garments had been camouflaged.  “Hide and seek when we were kids was never half as thrilling as this,” said Nancy, as she and Mabel started off on the search.  Next morning Nancy, Mabel and Ida Hall were among the dozen nurses instructed to camouflage themselves and hide in the woods for the others to locate. Nancy had dabbled at painting in school, and did a fairly good imitation of bay leaves across Mabel’s face and coveralls. Then before their small mirror she touched up her own countenance to look like woods’ shadows. A net was secured over her helmet and in it she twisted pieces of jasmine vines and bay leaves, leaving some of the vines to trail down across her face.  They were given ten minutes to hide before the others of their unit were sent in search of them. Nancy found a spot of dense growth not far from the highway where a scuppernong vine trailed over some low bushes, and a near-by jasmine crowned an old stump with yellow blossoms. She stretched flat under the scuppernong, and stuck her head among the yellow blossoms. Certainly she could not have found a more fragrant hiding place.  She heard the shot fired for the search to begin, then came faint sounds of the cautious searchers. In spite of orders, whoops and little screeches escaped the nurses when anyone was discovered. Several passed close enough for Nancy to touch them, but still she wasn’t noticed. Like an ostrich sticking his head in the sand, Nancy closed her eyes at each approach, feeling somehow that she was better hidden that way. Someone was coming near almost at a run when the shot was fired to end the race. Nancy was thrilled to know she was among those who had missed being found.  She was about to crawl out of her hiding place when she saw that the approaching girl was Tini Hoffman. Tini seemed to have no interest in the search, however, but was intent on reaching the highway. While Nancy had crouched under the bushes she had heard several cars go by. Cautiously she lifted her head as Tini passed and saw some letters sticking from her coverall pocket. Suspicion stirred. No doubt Tini was intent on mailing those letters she had written in the swamp describing their activities.  Instantly Nancy had a hunch that she meant to stop some passing car and get the driver to put her letters into the nearest post office. But she couldn’t run out there and accuse her of such an intention. There was nothing to do but watch her.  She saw Tini running, and in the distance a farmer’s truck coming down the hill. Nancy crawled from her hiding place and hurried from tree to bush on Tini’s trail. The car was quite close now and Tini jumped a ditch and ran to the pavement. So intent was she on attracting the driver’s attention, she was completely unaware of Nancy’s approach.  Tini waved her letters and the driver slowed. When he stopped, she called out, “Will you drop these letters at the nearest post office for me?”  “Sure, lady,” agreed the farmer at the wheel. “Glad to ’comodate you, miss.”  With a leap across the ditch Nancy was at Tini’s side. She reached for the letters as Tini extended them toward the man.  “You know you shouldn’t do that, Tini!” she burst forth.  The farmer gaped in amazement at this strange creature draped in leaves and covered with splotches of paint.  “How dare you?” burst forth Tini. “I’ve a perfect right—”  “You have not!”  “Give me my letters.”  “I will not! And if you try to take them I’ll report the whole business to Lieutenant Hauser.”  “Reckon I’ll be moving on,” said the farmer uneasily, looking at both of them as if he thought they had just escaped from an asylum. He chugged his motor into action, but before he rolled off he glanced at them compassionately and said, “Y’all better be good now and go back to the ’sylum, so Doc can take care o’ you.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  CHAPTER SEVEN                                  LETTERS   As the farmer’s truck rolled away Tini glared at Nancy. She stomped her G.I. shoes on the pavement and burst forth, “How dare you? Hand me my letters!”  Laughing suddenly Nancy handed them to her. “He thought we had escaped from the asylum across the hill,” she chuckled.  “You look like a lunatic!”  “And you act like one!”  Tini turned and stalked back into the pine thicket. Nancy took off her be-decked helmet, mopped her hot face with her sleeve and followed.  She finally overtook Tini and asked, “Why did you do that, Tini?”  “I have a right to mail letters if I like.”  “Then why didn’t you send them through the regular channels at the camp?”  “Who wants somebody pawing over your letters, looking at addresses?” asked Tini.  “I don’t believe anybody pries into who our letters are sent to.”  “And what business is it of yours?” Tini stopped suddenly and turned on Nancy.  “Any regulations given to this unit concern us all,” stated Nancy firmly.  “Zat so!” Tini’s tone was biting with sarcasm.  “And if I broke the regulations it would be your business to jack me up.” Suddenly Nancy’s tone became pleading. “Tini, can’t you see that all these rules are for our own good, and the safety of the boys out yonder we’re offering our lives to save?”  “I understand what we’re going into the same as you, Nancy Dale. But some of the restrictions are utterly silly.”  “We’ve got to trust the judgment of our superiors about that. They understand the whole situation better than we do.”  “I see no reason why we can’t tell our family and friends what we’ve been doing. I didn’t let out any military secrets in those letters.”  “The other night under the net you asked me how to spell camouflage. You were evidently telling them about our instructions in camouflage.”  Tini’s fair face flushed. “Well, what of it?” she snapped. “It’s no secret that our men use camouflage.”  “You shouldn’t write about it for the simple reason that Lieutenant Hauser ordered us to say nothing of the things we’ve been doing on this trip. Those are orders. The very fact that you tried to get somebody outside to post your letters proves you have a guilty conscience about the whole business.”  “And where did you get the right to jack me up about anything I do?”  “I have only the right that every American should use—to try to see that information about our military activities doesn’t get into the hands of our enemies.”  “So you’re implying that my family and friends are enemies!” Tini’s eyes were flashing fire now.  “Oh, Tini, this is so absurd,” mourned Nancy.  “Of course it’s absurd your trying to stop my sending mail out.”  Suddenly Nancy lost all patience. She stopped short and by her very manner forced Tini to stop. “You have no reason in you, Tini!” she exclaimed. “Now I’ll give you two choices—you either hand those letters to Lieutenant Hauser to be mailed, or burn them.”  “So! Since when have I had to take orders from you?”  Nancy ignored the question and continued, “You know perfectly well that the rest of us tore up the letters we wrote in the swamp before we knew we were not to write descriptions of what we had been doing. Those letters you have must have been written back there. You’ve had no time for writing since we came on here.”  Tini ignored the plain truth with which she had been faced and started on toward camp. Nancy caught up with her, saying, “If you don’t do one or the other you’ll place me in the embarrassing position of having to report what just happened to Lieutenant Hauser.”  “So you’re one of the spying, little tattletales!”  Nancy’s brown eyes were full of fire now as she said, “Tini Hoffman, this is no schoolgirl business we’re in. Thousands of lives may sometime be at stake because some thoughtless person like you has seen no sense in certain censorship restrictions. If we don’t conform to those regulations now, it’ll be too late to learn how when we get over there. I’m taking no chances, Tini, no matter what you or anyone else"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],["title","Seven Little Australians (#0)"],["body","Little Australians   by  Ethel Turner     CONTENTS  CHAPTER       I  Chiefly Descriptive     II  Fowl for Dinner    III  Virtue Not Always Rewarded     IV  The General Sees Active Service      V  \"Next Monday Morning\"     VI  The Sweetness of Sweet Sixteen    VII  \"What Say You to Falling in Love?\"   VIII  A Catapult and a Catastrophe     IX  Consequences      X  Bunty in the Light of a Hero     XI  The Truant    XII  Swish, Swish!

If you imagine you are going to read of model children, with perhaps; a naughtily inclined one to point a moral, you had better lay down the book immediately and betake yourself to 'Sandford and Merton' or similar standard juvenile works.  Not one of the seven is really good, for the very excellent reason that Australian children never are.  In England, and America, and Africa, and Asia, the little folks may be paragons of virtue, I know little about them.  But in Australia a model child is--I say it not without thankfulness--an unknown quantity.  It may be that the miasmas of naughtiness develop best in the sunny brilliancy of our atmosphere.  It may be that the land and the people are young-hearted together, and the children's spirits not crushed and saddened by the shadow of long years' sorrowful history.  There is a lurking sparkle of joyousness and rebellion and mischief in nature here, and therefore in children.  Often the light grows dull and the bright colouring fades to neutral tints in the dust and heat of the day.  But when it survives play-days and school-days, circumstances alone determine whether the electric sparkle shall go to play will-o'-the-wisp with the larrikin type, or warm the breasts of the spirited, single-hearted, loyal ones who alone can \"advance Australia.\"  Enough of such talk.  Let me tell you about my seven select spirits.  They are having nursery tea at the present moment with a minimum of comfort and a maximum of noise, so if you can bear a deafening babel of voices and an unmusical clitter-clatter of crockery I will take you inside the room and introduce them to you.  Nursery tea is more an English institution than an Australian one; there is a kind of _bon camaraderie_ feeling between parents and young folks here, and an utter absence of veneration on the part of the latter.  So even in the most wealthy families it seldom happens that the parents dine in solemn state alone, while the children are having a simple tea in another room: they all assemble around the same board, and the young ones partake of the same dishes, and sustain their parts in the conversation right nobly.  But, given a very particular and rather irritable father, and seven children with excellent lungs and tireless tongues, what could you do but give them separate rooms to take their meals in?  Captain Woolcot, the father, in addition to this division, had had thick felt put over the swing door upstairs, but the noise used to float down to the dining-room in cheerful, unconcerned manner despite it.  It was a nursery without a nurse, too, so that partly accounted for it.  Meg, the eldest, was only sixteen, and could not be expected to be much of a disciplinarian, and the slatternly but good-natured girl, who was supposed to combine the duties of nursery-maid and housemaid, had so much to do in her second capacity that the first suffered considerably.  She used to lay the nursery meals when none of the little girls could be found to help her, and bundle on the clothes of the two youngest in the morning, but beyond that the seven had to manage for themselves.  The mother? you ask.  Oh, she was only twenty--just a lovely, laughing-faced girl, whom they all adored, and who was very little steadier and very little more of a housekeeper than Meg.  Only the youngest of the brood was hers, but she seemed just as fond of the other six as of it, and treated it more as if it were a very entertaining kitten than a real live baby, and her very own.  Indeed at Misrule--that is the name their house always went by, though I believe there was a different one painted above the balcony--that baby seemed a gigantic joke to everyone.  The Captain generally laughed when he saw it, tossed it in the air, and then asked someone to take it quickly.  The children dragged it all over the country with them, dropped it countless times, forgot its pelisse on wet days, muffled it up when it was hot, gave it the most astounding things to eat, and yet it was the healthiest, prettiest, and most sunshiny baby that ever sucked a wee fat thumb.  It was never called \"Baby,\" either; that was the special name of the next youngest.  Captain Woolcot had said, \"Hello, is this the General?\" when the little, red, staring-eyed morsel had been put into his arms, and the name had come into daily use, though I believe at the christening service the curate did say something about Francis Rupert Burnand Woolcot.  Baby was four, and was a little soft fat thing with pretty cuddlesome ways, great smiling eyes, and lips very kissable when they were free from jam.  She had a weakness, however, for making the General cry, or she would have been really almost a model child.  Innumerable times she had been found pressing its poor little chest to make it \"squeak;\" and even pinching its tiny arms, or pulling its innocent nose, just for the strange pleasure of hearing the yells of despair it instantly set up.  Captain Woolcot ascribed the peculiar tendency to the fact that the child had once had a dropsical-looking woolly lamb, from which the utmost pressure would only elicit the faintest possible squeak: he said it was only natural that now she had something so amenable to squeezing she should want to utilize it.  Bunty was six, and was fat and very lazy.  He hated scouting at cricket, he loathed the very name of a paper-chase, and as for running an errand, why, before anyone could finish saying something was wanted he would have utterly disappeared.  He was rather small for his age;-and I don't think had ever been seen with a clean face. Even at church, though the immediate front turned to the minister might be passable, the people in the next pew had always an uninterrupted view of the black rim where washing operations had left off.  The next on the list--I am going from youngest to oldest, you see--was the \"show\" Woolcot, as Pip, the eldest boy, used to say. You have seen those exquisite child-angel faces on Raphael Tuck's Christmas cards?  I think the artist must just have dreamed of Nell, and then reproduced the vision imperfectly.  She was ten, and had a little fairy-like figure, gold hair clustering in wonderful waves and curls around her face, soft hazel eyes, and a little rosebud of a mouth.  She was not conceited either, her family took care of that--Pip would have nipped such a weakness very sternly in its earliest bud; but in some way if there was a pretty ribbon to spare, or a breadth of bright material; just enough for one little frock, it fell as a matter of course to her.  Judy was only three years older, but was the greatest contrast imaginable.  Nellie used to move rather slowly about, and would have made a picture in any attitude.  Judy I think, was never seen to walk, and seldom looked picturesque.  If she did not dash madly to the place she wished to get to, she would progress by a series of jumps, bounds, and odd little skips.  She was very thin, as people generally are who have quicksilver instead of blood in their veins; she had a small, eager, freckled face, with very, bright dark eyes, a small, determined mouth, and a mane of untidy, curly dark hair that was the trial of her life.  Without doubt she was the worst of the seven, probably because she was the cleverest.  Her brilliant inventive powers plunged them all into ceaseless scrapes, and though she often bore the brunt of the blame with equanimity, they used to turn round, not infrequently, and upbraid her for suggesting the mischief.  She had been christened \"Helen,\" which in no way account's for \"Judy,\" but then nicknames are rather unaccountable things sometimes, are they not?  Bunty said it was because she was always popping and jerking herself about like the celebrated wife of Punch, and there really is something in that.  Her other name, \"Fizz,\" is easier to understand; Pip used to say he never yet had seen the ginger ale that effervesced and bubbled and made the noise that Judy did.  I haven't introduced you to Pip yet, have I?  He was a little like Judy, only handsomer and taller, and he was fourteen, and had as good an opinion of himself and as poor a one of girls as boys of that age generally have.  Meg was the eldest of the family, and had a long, fair plait that Bunty used to delight in pulling; a sweet, rather dreamy face, and a powdering of pretty freckles that occasioned her much tribulation of spirit.  It was generally believed in the family that she wrote poetry and stories, and even kept a diary, but no one had ever seen a vestige of her papers, she kept them so carefully locked up in her old tin hat-box.  Their father, had you asked them they would all have replied with considerable pride, was \"a military man,\" and much from home.  He did not understand children at all, and was always grumbling at the noise they made, and the money they cost. Still, I think he was rather proud of Pip, and sometimes, if Nellie were prettily dressed, he would take her out with him in his dogcart.  He had offered to send the six of them to boarding school when he brought home his young girl-wife, but she would not hear of"]]]
