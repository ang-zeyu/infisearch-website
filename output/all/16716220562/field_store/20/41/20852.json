Another measure which would do much to increase liberty would be an increase of self-government for subordinate groups, whether geographical or economic or defined by some common belief, like religious sects.  A modern state is so vast and its machinery is so little understood that even when a man has a vote he does not feel himself any effective part of the force which determines its policy. Except in matters where he can act in conjunction with an exceptionally powerful group, he feels himself almost impotent, and the government remains a remote impersonal circumstance, which must be simply endured, like the weather.  By a share in the control of smaller bodies, a man might regain some of that sense of personal opportunity and responsibility which belonged to the citizen of a city-state in ancient Greece or medieval Italy.  When any group of men has a strong corporate consciousness--such as belongs, for example, to a nation or a trade or a religious body--liberty demands that it should be free to decide for itself all matters which are of great importance to the outside world.  This is the basis of the universal claim for national independence.  But nations are by no means the only groups which ought to have self-government for their internal concerns.  And nations, like other groups, ought not to have complete liberty of action in matters which are of equal concern to foreign nations.  Liberty demands self-government, but not the right to interfere with others.  The greatest degree of liberty is not secured by anarchy.  The reconciliation of liberty with government is a difficult problem, but it is one which any political theory must face.  The essence of government is the use of force in accordance with law to secure certain ends which the holders of power consider desirable. The coercion of an individual or a group by force is always in itself more or less harmful.  But if there were no government, the result would not be an absence of force in men's relations to each other; it would merely be the exercise of force by those who had strong predatory instincts, necessitating either slavery or a perpetual readiness to repel force with force on the part of those whose instincts were less violent.  This is the state of affairs at present in international relations, owing to the fact that no international government exists.  The results of anarchy between states should suffice to persuade us that anarchism has no solution to offer for the evils of the world.  There is probably one purpose, and only one, for which the use of force by a government is beneficent, and that is to diminish the total amount of force used m the world.  It is clear, for example, that the legal prohibition of murder diminishes the total amount of violence in the world.  And no one would maintain that parents should have unlimited freedom to ill-treat their children.  So long as some men wish to do violence to others, there cannot be complete liberty, for either the wish to do violence must be restrained, or the victims must be left to suffer.  For this reason, although individuals and societies should have the utmost freedom as regards their own affairs, they ought not to have complete freedom as regards their dealings with others.  To give freedom to the strong to oppress the weak is not the way to secure the greatest possible amount of freedom in the world. This is the basis of the socialist revolt against the kind of freedom which used to be advocated by _laissez-faire_ economists.  Democracy is a device--the best so far invented--for diminishing as much as possible the interference of governments with liberty.  If a nation is divided into two sections which cannot both have their way, democracy theoretically insures that the majority shall have their way.  But democracy is not at all an adequate device unless it is accompanied by a very great amount of devolution.  Love of uniformity, or the mere pleasure of interfering, or dislike of differing tastes and temperaments, may often lead a majority to control a minority in matters which do not really concern the majority.  We should none of us like to have the internal affairs of Great Britain settled by a parliament of the world, if ever such a body came into existence. Nevertheless, there are matters which such a body could settle much better than any existing instrument of government.  The theory of the legitimate use of force in human affairs, where a government exists, seems clear.  Force should only be used against those who attempt to use force against others, or against those who will not respect the law in cases where a common decision is necessary and a minority are opposed to the action of the majority.  These seem legitimate occasions for the use of force; and they should be legitimate occasions in international affairs, if an international government existed.  The problem of the legitimate occasions for the use of force in the absence of a government is a different one, with which we are not at present concerned.  Although a government must have the power to use force, and may on occasion use it legitimately, the aim of the reformers to have such institutions as will diminish the need for actual coercion will be found to have this effect.  Most of us abstain, for instance, from theft, not because it is illegal, but because we feel no desire to steal.  The more men learn to live creatively rather than possessively, the less their wishes will lead them to thwart others or to attempt violent interference with their liberty.  Most of the conflicts of interests, which lead individuals or organizations into disputes, are purely imaginary, and would be seen to be so if men aimed more at the goods in which all can share, and less at those private possessions that are the source of strife.  In proportion as men live creatively, they cease to wish to interfere with others by force.  Very many matters in which, at present, common action is thought indispensable, might well be left to individual decision.  It used to be thought absolutely necessary that all the inhabitants of a country should have the same religion, but we now know that there is no such necessity.  In like manner it will be found, as men grow more tolerant in their instincts, that many uniformities now insisted upon are useless and even harmful.  Good political institutions would weaken the impulse toward force and domination in two ways: first, by increasing the opportunities for the creative impulses, and by shaping education so as to strengthen these impulses; secondly, by diminishing the outlets for the possessive instincts.  The diffusion of power, both in the political and the economic sphere, instead of its concentration in the hands of officials and captains of industry, would greatly diminish the opportunities for acquiring the habit of command, out of which the desire for exercising tyranny is apt to spring.  Autonomy, both for districts and for organizations, would leave fewer occasions when governments were called upon to make decisions as to other people's concerns.  And the abolition of capitalism and the wage system would remove the chief incentive to fear and greed, those correlative passions by which all free life is choked and gagged.  Few men seem to realize how many of the evils from which we suffer are wholly unnecessary, and that they could be abolished by a united effort within a few years.  If a majority in every civilized country so desired, we could, within twenty years, abolish all abject poverty, quite half the illness in the world, the whole economic slavery which binds down nine tenths of our population; we could fill the world with beauty and joy, and secure the reign of universal peace.  It is only because men are apathetic that this is not achieved, only because imagination is sluggish, and what always has been is regarded as what always must be.  With good-will, generosity, intelligence, these things could be brought about.     Chapter II: Capitalism and the Wage System   I  The world is full of preventible evils which most men would be glad to see prevented.  Nevertheless, these evils persist, and nothing effective is done toward abolishing them.  This paradox produces astonishment in inexperienced reformers, and too often produces disillusionment in those who have come to know the difficulty of changing human institutions.  War is recognized as an evil by an immense majority in every civilized country; but this recognition does not prevent war.  The unjust distribution of wealth must be obviously an evil to those who are not prosperous, and they are nine tenths of the population. Nevertheless it continues unabated.  The tyranny of the holders of power is a source of needless suffering and misfortune to very large sections of mankind; but power remains in few hands, and tends, if anything, to grow more concentrated.  I wish first to study the evils of our present institutions, and the causes of the very limited success of reformers in the past, and then to suggest reasons for the hope of a more lasting and permanent success in the near future.  The war has come as a challenge to all who desire a better world.  The system which cannot save mankind from such an appalling disaster is at fault somewhere, and cannot be amended in any lasting way unless the danger of great wars in the future can be made very small.  But war is only the final flower of an evil tree.  Even in times of peace, most men live lives of monotonous labor, most women are condemned to a drudgery which almost kills the possibility of happiness before youth is past, most children are allowed to grow up in ignorance of all that would enlarge their thoughts or stimulate their imagination.  The few who are more fortunate are rendered illiberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of the awakening indignation of the masses.

Material possessions, in fact or in desire, dominate our outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative impulses.  Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering.  Only by diminishing the strength of this passion and its hold upon our daily lives can new institutions bring permanent benefit to mankind.  Institutions which will diminish the sway of greed are possible, but only through a complete reconstruction of our whole economic system. Capitalism and the wage system must be abolished; they are twin monsters which are eating up the life of the world.  In place of them we need a system which will hold in cheek men's predatory impulses, and will diminish the economic injustice that allows some to be rich in idleness while others are poor in spite of unremitting labor; but above all we need a system which will destroy the tyranny of the employer, by making men at the same time secure against destitution and able to find scope for individual initiative in the control of the industry by which they live.  A better system can do all these things, and can be established by the democracy whenever it grows weary of enduring evils which there is no reason to endure.  We may distinguish four purposes at which an economic system may aim: first, it may aim at the greatest possible production of goods and at facilitating technical progress; second, it may aim at securing distributive justice; third, it may aim at giving security against destitution; and, fourth, it may aim at liberating creative impulses and diminishing possessive impulses.  Of these four purposes the last is the most important.  Security is chiefly important as a means to it.  State socialism, though it might give material security and more justice than we have at present, would probably fail to liberate creative impulses or produce a progressive society.  Our present system fails in all four purposes.  It is chiefly defended on the ground that it achieves the first of the four purposes, namely, the greatest possible production of material goods, but it only does this in a very short-sighted way, by methods which are wasteful in the long run both of human material and of natural resources.  Capitalistic enterprise involves a ruthless belief in the importance of increasing material production to the utmost possible extent now and in the immediate future.  In obedience to this belief, new portions of the earth's surface are continually brought under the sway of industrialism.  Vast tracts of Africa become recruiting grounds for the labor required in the gold and diamond mines of the Rand, Rhodesia, and Kimberley; for this purpose, the population is demoralized, taxed, driven into revolt, and exposed to the contamination of European vice and disease.  Healthy and vigorous races from Southern Europe are tempted to America, where sweating and slum life reduce their vitality if they do not actually cause their death.  What damage is done to our own urban populations by the conditions under which they live, we all know.  And what is true of the human riches of the world is no less true of the physical resources.  The mines, forests, and wheat-fields of the world are all being exploited at a rate which must practically exhaust them at no distant date.  On the side of material production, the world is living too fast; in a kind of delirium, almost all the energy of the world has rushed into the immediate production of something, no matter what, and no matter at what cost.  And yet our present system is defended on the ground that it safeguards progress!  It cannot be said that our present economic system is any more successful in regard to the other three objects which ought to be aimed at.  Among the many obvious evils of capitalism and the wage system, none are more glaring than that they encourage predatory instincts, that they allow economic injustice, and that they give great scope to the tyranny of the employer.  As to predatory instincts, we may say, broadly speaking, that in a state of nature there would be two ways of acquiring riches--one by production, the other by robbery.  Under our existing system, although what is recognized as robbery is forbidden, there are nevertheless many ways of becoming rich without contributing anything to the wealth of the community.  Ownership of land or capital, whether acquired or inherited, gives a legal right to a permanent income.  Although most people have to produce in order to live, a privileged minority are able to live in luxury without producing anything at all.  As these are the men who are not only the most fortunate but also the most respected, there is a general desire to enter their ranks, and a widespread unwillingness to face the fact that there is no justification whatever for incomes derived in this way.  And apart from the passive enjoyment of rent or interest, the methods of acquiring wealth are very largely predatory.  It is not, as a rule, by means of useful inventions, or of any other action which increases the general wealth of the community, that men amass fortunes; it is much more often by skill in exploiting or circumventing others.  Nor is it only among the rich that our present régime promotes a narrowly acquisitive spirit.  The constant risk of destitution compels most men to fill a great part of their time and thought with the economic struggle.  There is a theory that this increases the total output of wealth by the community.  But for reasons to which I shall return later, I believe this theory to be wholly mistaken.  Economic injustice is perhaps the most obvious evil of our present system.  It would be utterly absurd to maintain that the men who inherit great wealth deserve better of the community than those who have to work for their living.  I am not prepared to maintain that economic justice requires an exactly equal income for everybody.  Some kinds of work require a larger income for efficiency than others do; but there is economic injustice as soon as a man has more than his share, unless it is because his efficiency in his work requires it, or as a reward for some definite service.  But this point is so obvious that it needs no elaboration.  The modern growth of monopolies in the shape of trusts, cartels, federations of employers and so on has greatly increased the power of the capitalist to levy toll on the community.  This tendency will not cease of itself, but only through definite action on the part of those who do not profit by the capitalist régime.  Unfortunately the distinction between the proletariat and the capitalist is not so sharp as it was in the minds of socialist theorizers.  Trade-unions have funds in various securities; friendly societies are large capitalists; and many individuals eke out their wages by invested savings.  All this increases the difficulty of any clear-cut radical change in our economic system.  But it does not diminish the desirability of such a change.  Such a system as that suggested by the French syndicalists, in which each trade would be self-governing and completely independent, without the control of any central authority, would not secure economic justice.  Some trades are in a much stronger bargaining position than others.  Coal and transport, for example, could paralyze the national life, and could levy blackmail by threatening to do so.  On the other hand, such people as school teachers, for example, could rouse very little terror by the threat of a strike and would be in a very weak bargaining position.  Justice can never be secured by any system of unrestrained force exercised by interested parties in their own interests.  For this reason the abolition of the state, which the syndicalists seem to desire, would be a measure not compatible with economic justice.  The tyranny of the employer, which at present robs the greater part of most men's lives of all liberty and all initiative, is unavoidable so long as the employer retains the right of dismissal with consequent loss of pay.  This right is supposed to be essential in order that men may have an incentive to work thoroughly.  But as men grow more civilized, incentives based on hope become increasingly preferable to those that are based on fear.  It would be far better that men should be rewarded for working well than that they should be punished for working badly.  This system is already in operation in the civil service, where a man is only dismissed for some exceptional degree of vice or virtue, such as murder or illegal abstention from it. Sufficient pay to ensure a livelihood ought to be given to every person who is willing to work, independently of the question whether the particular work at which he is skilled is wanted at the moment or not.  If it is not wanted, some new trade which is wanted ought to be taught at the public expense.  Why, for example, should a hansom-cab driver be allowed to suffer on account of the introduction of taxies? He has not committed any crime, and the fact that his work is no longer wanted is due to causes entirely outside his control.  Instead of being allowed to starve, he ought to be given instruction in motor driving or in whatever other trade may seem most suitable.  At present, owing to the fact that all industrial changes tend to cause hardships to some section of wage-earners, there is a tendency to technical conservatism on the part of labor, a dislike of innovations, new processes, and new methods.  But such changes, if they are in the permanent interest of the community, ought to be carried out without allowing them to bring unmerited loss to those sections of the community whose labor is no longer wanted in the old form.  The instinctive conservatism of mankind is sure to make all processes of "]]]
