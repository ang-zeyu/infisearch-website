He had just seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack start toward the Big River for a brief visit before leaving on their long, difficult journey to the far-away Southland.  Farewells are always rather sad, and this particular farewell had left Peter with a lump in his throat,--a queer, choky feeling.  \"If I were sure that they would return next spring, it wouldn't be so bad,\" he muttered.  \"It's those terrible guns.  I know what it is to have to watch out for them.  Farmer Brown's boy used to hunt me with one of them, but he doesn't any more.  But even when he did hunt me it wasn't anything like what the Ducks have to go through.  If I kept my eyes and ears open, I could tell when a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if I wanted to.  I never had to worry about my meals.  But with the Ducks it is a thousand times worse.  They've got to eat while making that long journey, and they can eat only where there is the right kind of food.  Hunters with terrible guns know where those places are and hide there until the Ducks come, and the Ducks have no way of knowing whether the hunters are waiting for them or not.  That isn't hunting.  It's--it's--\"  \"Well, what is it? What are you talking to yourself about, Peter Rabbit?\"  Peter looked up with a start to find the soft, beautiful eyes of Lightfoot the Deer gazing down at him over the top of a little hemlock tree.  \"It's awful,\" declared Peter. \"It's worse than unfair. It doesn't give them any chance at all.\"  \"I suppose it must be so if you say so,\" replied Lightfoot, \"but you might tell me what all this awfulness is about.\"  Peter grinned.  Then he began at the beginning and told Lightfoot all about Mr. and Mrs. Quack and the many dangers they must face on their long journey to the far-away Southland and back again in the spring, all because of the heartless hunters with terrible guns.  Lightfoot listened and his great soft eyes were filled with pity for the Quack family.  \"I hope they will get through all right,\" said he, \"and I hope they will get back in the spring.  It is bad enough to be hunted by men at one time of the year, as no one knows better than I do, but to be hunted in the spring as well as in the fall is more than twice as bad.  Men are strange creatures.  I do not understand them at all.  None of the people of the Green Forest would think of doing such terrible things.  I suppose it is quite right to hunt others in order to get enough to eat, though I am thankful to say that I never have had to do that, but to hunt others just for the fun of hunting is something I cannot understand at all.  And yet that is what men seem to do it for. I guess the trouble is they never have been hunted themselves and don't know how it feels.  Sometimes I think I'll hunt one some day just to teach him a lesson.  What are you laughing at, Peter?\"  \"At the idea of you hunting a man,\" replied Peter.  \"Your heart is all right, Lightfoot, but you are too timid and gentle to frighten any one.  Big as you are I wouldn't fear you.\"  With a single swift bound Lightfoot sprang out in front of Peter.  He stamped his sharp hoofs, lowered his handsome head until the sharp points of his antlers, which people call horns, pointed straight at Peter, lifted the hair along the back of his neck, and made a motion as if to plunge at him.  His eyes, which Peter had always thought so soft and gentle, seemed to flash fire.  \"Oh!\" cried Peter in a faint, frightened-sounding voice and leaped to one side before it entered his foolish little head that Lightfoot was just pretending.  Lightfoot chuckled.  \"Did you say I couldn't frighten any one?\" he demanded.  \"I--I didn't know you could look so terribly fierce,\" stammered Peter.  \"Those antlers look really dangerous when you point them that way.  Why--why--what is that hanging to them?  It looks like bits of old fur.  Have you been tearing somebody's coat, Lightfoot?\"  Peter's eyes were wide with wonder and suspicion.     CHAPTER II: Lightfoot's New Antlers   Peter Rabbit was puzzled.  He stared at Lightfoot the Deer a wee bit suspiciously.  \"Have you been tearing somebody's coat?\" he asked again.  He didn't like to think it of Lightfoot, whom he always had believed quite as gentle, harmless, and timid as himself.  But what else could he think?  Lightfoot slowly shook his head.  \"No,\" said he, \"I haven't torn anybody's coat.\"  \"Then what are those rags hanging on your antlers?\"  demanded Peter.  Lightfoot chuckled.  \"They are what is left of the coverings of my new antlers,\" he explained.  \"What's that?  What do you mean by new antlers?\"  Peter was sitting up very straight, with his eyes fixed on Lightfoot's antlers as though he never had seen them before.  \"Just what I said,\" retorted Lightfoot.  \"What do you think of them?  I think they are the finest antlers I've ever had.  When I get the rest of those rags off, they will be as handsome a set as ever was grown in the Green Forest.\"  Lightfoot rubbed his antlers against the trunk of a tree till some of the rags hanging to them dropped off.  Peter blinked very hard.  He was trying to understand and he couldn't.  Finally he said so.  \"What kind of a story are you trying to fill me up with?\" he demanded indignantly.  \"Do you mean to tell me that those are not the antlers that you have had as long as I've known you?  How can anything hard like those antlers grow?  And if those are new ones, where are the old ones?  Show me the old ones, and perhaps I'll believe that these are new ones.  The idea of trying to make me believe that antlers grow just like plants!  I've seen Bossy the Cow all summer and I know she has got the same horns she had last summer.  New antlers indeed!\"  \"You are quite right, Peter, quite right about Bossy the Cow. She never has new horns, but that isn't any reason why I shouldn't have new antlers, is it?\" replied Lightfoot patiently.  \"Her horns are quite different from my antlers.  I have a new pair every year.  You haven't seen me all summer, have you, Peter?\"  \"No, I don't remember that I have,\" replied Peter, trying very hard to remember when he had last seen Lightfoot.  \"I KNOW you haven't,\" retorted Lightfoot. \"I know it because I have been hiding in a place you never visit.\"  \"What have you been hiding for?\" demanded Peter.  \"For my new antlers to grow,\" replied Lightfoot.  \"When my new antlers are growing, I want to be away by myself.  I don't like to be seen without them or with halfgrown ones.  Besides, I am very uncomfortable while the new antlers are growing and I want to be alone.\"  Lightfoot spoke as if he really meant every word he said, but still Peter couldn't, he just COULDN'T believe that those wonderful great antlers had grown out of Lightfoot's head in a single summer.  \"Where did you leave your old ones and when did they come off?\"  he asked, and there was doubt in the very tone of his voice.  \"They dropped off last spring, but I don't remember just where,\" replied Lightfoot.  \"I was too glad to be rid of them to notice where they dropped.  You see they were loose and uncomfortable, and I hadn't any more use for them because I knew that my new ones would be bigger and better.  I've got one more point on each than I had last year.\"  Lightfoot began once more to rub his antlers against the tree to get off the queer rags hanging to them and to polish the points.  Peter watched in silence for a few minutes.  Then, all his suspicions returning, he said:  \"But you haven't told me anything about those rags hanging to your antlers.\"  \"And you haven't believed what I have already told you,\" retorted Lightfoot.  \"I don't like telling things to people who won't believe me.\"     CHAPTER III: Lightfoot Tells How His Antlers Grew   It is hard to believe what seems impossible.  And yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else.  So it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be.  Peter Rabbit wanted to believe what Lightfoot the Deer had just told him, but somehow he couldn't.  If he had seen those antlers growing, it would have been another matter.  But he hadn't seen Lightfoot since the very last of winter, and then Lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had.  So Peter really couldn't be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4670"],["title","Lightfoot the Deer (#1)"],["body","and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months of spring and summer.  But Peter didn't blame Lightfoot in the least, because he had told Peter that he didn't like to tell things to people who wouldn't believe what he told them when Peter had asked him about the rags hanging to his antlers. \"I'm trying to believe it,\" he said, quite humbly.  \"It's all true,\" broke in another voice.  Peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin, Jumper the Hare.  Unseen and unheard, he had stolen up and had overheard what Peter and Lightfoot had said.  \"How do you know it is true?\" snapped Peter a little crossly, for Jumper had startled him.  \"Because I saw Lightfoot's old antlers after they had fallen off, and I often saw Lightfoot while his new ones were growing,\" retorted Jumper.  \"All right!  I'll believe anything that Lightfoot tells me if you say it is true,\" declared Peter, who greatly admires his cousin, Jumper.  \"Now tell me about those rags, Lightfoot.  Please do.\"  Lightfoot couldn't resist that \"please.\"  \"Those rags are what is left of a kind of covering which protected the antlers while they were growing, as I told you before,\" said he.  \"Very soon after my old ones dropped off the new ones began to grow.  They were not hard, not at all like they are now.  They were soft and very tender, and the blood ran through them just as it does through our bodies.  They were covered with a sort of skin with hairs on it like thin fur.  The ends were not sharply pointed they now are, but were big and rounded, like knobs.  They were not like antlers at all, and they made my head hot and were very uncomfortable.  That is why I hid away.  They grew very fast, so fast that every day I could see by looking at my reflection in water that they were a little longer.  It seemed to me sometimes as if all my strength went into those new antlers. And I had to be very careful not to hit them against anything.  In the first place it would have hurt, and in the second place it might have spoiled the shape of them.  \"When they had grown to the length you now see, they began to shrink and grow hard.  The knobs on the ends shrank until they became pointed.  As soon as they stopped growing the blood stopped flowing up in them, and as they became hard they were no longer tender.  The skin which had covered them grew dry and split, and I rubbed it off on trees and bushes.  The little rags you see are what is left, but I will soon be rid of those.  Then I shall be ready to fight if need be and will fear no one save man, and will fear him only when he has a terrible gun with him.\"  Lightfoot tossed his head proudly and rattled his wonderful antlers against the nearest tree.  \"Isn't he handsome,\" whispered Peter to Jumper the Hare; \"and did you ever hear of anything so wonderful as the growing of those new antlers in such a short time?  It is hard to believe, but I suppose it must be true.\"  \"It is,\" replied Jumper, \"and I tell you, Peter, I would hate to have Lightfoot try those antlers on me, even though I were big as a man.  You've always thought of Lightfoot as timid and afraid, but you should see him when he is angry.  Few people care to face him then.\"     CHAPTER IV: The Spirit Of Fear     When the days grow cold and the nights are clear,    There stalks abroad the spirit of fear.        --Lightfoot the Deer.   It is sad but true.  Autumn is often called the sad time of the year, and it is the sad time.  But it shouldn't be.  Old Mother Nature never intended that it should be.  She meant it to be the GLAD time.  It is the time when all the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows have got over the cares and worries of bringing up families and teaching their children how to look out for themselves.  It is the season when food is plentiful, and every one is fat and is, or ought to be, care free.  It is the season when Old Mother Nature intended all her little people to be happy, to have nothing to worry them for the little time before the coming of cold weather and the hard times which cold weather always brings.  But instead of this, a grim, dark figure goes stalking over the Green Meadows and through the Green Forest, and it is called the Spirit of Fear.  It peers into every hiding-place and wherever it finds one of the little people it sends little cold chills over him, little chills which jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun cannot chase away, though he shine his brightest.  All night as well as all day the Spirit of Fear searches out the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest.  It will not let them sleep. It will not let them eat in peace.  It drives them to seek new hiding-places and then drives them out of those.  It keeps them ever ready to fly or run at the slightest sound.  Peter Rabbit was thinking of this as he sat at the edge of the dear Old Briar-patch, looking over to the Green Forest.  The Green Forest was no longer just green; it was of many colors, for Old Mother Nature had set Jack Frost to painting the leaves of the maple-trees and the beech-trees, and the birch-trees and the poplar-trees and the chestnut-trees, and he had done his work well. Very, very lovely were the reds and yellows and browns against the dark green of the pines and the spruces and the hemlocks. The Purple Hills were more softly purple than at any other season of the year.  It was all very, very beautiful.  But Peter had no thought for the beauty of it all, for the Spirit of Fear had visited even the dear Old Briar-patch, and Peter was afraid.  It wasn't fear of Reddy Fox, or Redtail the Hawk, or Hooty the Owl, or Old Man Coyote.  They were forever trying to catch him, but they did not strike terror to his heart because he felt quite smart enough to keep out of their clutches.  To be sure, they gave him sudden frights sometimes, when they happened to surprise him, but these frights lasted only until he reached the nearest bramble-tangle or hollow log where they could not get at him.  But the fear that chilled his heart now never left him even for a moment.  And Peter knew that this same fear was clutching at the hearts of Bob White, hiding in the brown stubble; of Mrs. Grouse, squatting in the thickest bramble-tangle in the Green Forest; of Uncle Billy Possum and Bobby Coon in their hollow trees; of Jerry Muskrat in the Smiling Pool; of Happy Jack Squirrel, hiding in the tree tops; of Lightfoot the Deer, lying in the closest thicket he could find.  It was even clutching at the hearts of Granny and Reddy Fox and of great, big Buster Bear.  It seemed to Peter that no one was so big or so small that this terrible Spirit of Fear had not searched him out.  Far in the distance sounded a sudden bang.  Peter jumped and shivered.  He knew that every one else who had heard that bang had jumped and shivered just as he had.  It was the season of hunters with terrible guns.  It was man who had sent this terrible Spirit of Fear to chill the hearts of the little meadow and forest people at this very time when Old Mother Nature had made all things so beautiful and had intended that they should be happiest and most free from care and worry.  It was man who had made the autumn a sad time instead of a glad time, the very saddest time of all the year, when Old Mother Nature had done her best to make it the most beautiful.  \"I don't understand these men creatures,\" said Peter to little Mrs. Peter, as they stared fearfully out from the dear Old Briar-patch.  \"They seem to find pleasure, actually find pleasure, in trying to kill us.  I don't understand them at all.  They haven't any hearts.  That must be the reason; they haven't any hearts.\"     CHAPTER V: Sammy Jay Brings Lightfoot Word   Sammy Jay is one of those who believe in the wisdom of the old saying, \"Early to bed and early to rise.\"  Sammy needs no alarm clock to get up early in the morning.  He is awake as soon as it is light enough to see and wastes no time wishing he could sleep a little longer.  His stomach wouldn't let him if he wanted to.  Sammy always wakes up hungry.  In this he is no different from all his feathered neighbors.  So the minute Sammy gets his eyes open he makes his toilet, for Sammy is very neat, and starts out to hunt for his breakfast. Long ago Sammy discovered that there is no safer time of day to visit the dooryards of those two-legged creatures called men than very early in the morning.  On this particular morning he had planned to fly over to Farmer Brown's dooryard, but at the last minute he changed his mind.  Instead, he flew over to the dooryard of another farm.  It was so very early in the morning that Sammy didn't expect to find anybody stirring, so you can guess how surprised he was when, just as he came in sight of that dooryard, he saw the door of the house open and a man step out.  Sammy stopped on the top of the nearest tree.  \"Now what is that man doing up as early as this?\" muttered Sammy.  Then he caught sight of something under the man's arm.  He didn't have to look twice to know what it was.  It was a gun!  Yes, sir, it was a gun, a terrible gun.  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Sammy, and quite forgot that his stomach was empty.  \"Now who can that fellow be after so early in the morning? I wonder if he is going to the dear Old Briar-patch to look for Peter Rabbit, or if he is going to the Old Pasture in search of Reddy Fox, or if it is Mr. and Mrs. Grouse he hopes to kill. I think I'll sit right here and watch.\"  So Sammy sat in the top of the tree and watched the hunter with the terrible gun.  He saw him head straight for the Green Forest. \"It's Mr. and Mrs. Grouse after all, I guess,\" thought Sammy. \"If I knew just where they were I'd go over and warn them.\" But Sammy didn't know just where they were and he knew that it might take him a long time to find them, so he once more began to think of breakfast and then, right then, another thought popped into his head.  He thought of Lightfoot the Deer.  Sammy watched the hunter enter the Green Forest,"]]]
