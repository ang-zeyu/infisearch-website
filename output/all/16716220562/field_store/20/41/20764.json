Whin an Irishman is four miles out at sea he is as much an American as Presarved Fish.  But a German is niver an American excipt whin he goes back to Germany to see his rilitives.  He keeps his own language, he plays pinochle, he despises th' dhrink iv th' counthry, his food is sthrange an' he on'y votes f'r Germans f'r office, or if he can't get a German, f'r somewan who's again' th' Irish.  I bet ye, if ye was to suddenly ask Schwarzmeister where he is, he'd say: 'At Hockheimer in Schwabia.' He don't ra-aly know he iver come to this counthry.  I've heerd him talkin' to himsilf.  He always counts in German.  \"But I say about Prince Hinnery that f'r a German he's all right an' I'm glad he come.  I hear he wrote home to his brother that is th' Imp'ror over there: 'Dear Willum: This is a wondherful counthry, an' they've give me a perfectly killin' rayciption. I've almost died laughin'.  We was met forty miles out at sea be a band on a raft playin' th' Watch on th' Rhine.  We encountered another band playin' th' same plazin' harmony ivry five miles till we got up to New York.  I wisht I had come over on a man-iv-war. In th' Bay we was surrounded be a fleet iv tugs carryin' riprisintatives iv th' press, singin' th' Watch on th' Rhine.  I rayceived siveral offers through a migaphone to write an article about what ye say in ye'er sleep f'r th' pa-apers, but I declined thim, awaitin' insthructions fr'm ye.  At th' dock we was greeted be a band playin' th' Watch on th' Rhine an' afther some delay, caused be th' Delicatessen Sangerbund holdin' us while they sung th' Watch on th' Rhine, we stepped ashore on a gangplank neatly formed be th' guv'nor iv th' state holdin' onto th' feet iv th' mayor, him clutchin' th' iditor iv th' Staats Zeitung an' so on, th' gangplank singin' th' Watch on th' Rhine as we walked to th' dock.  \"'I am much imprissed be New York.  I hate it.  Th' buildin's are very high here but th' language is higher.  If I was to go home now, ye wudden't know me.  Afther I hear a speech I don't dare to look in th' glass f'r fear I might be guilty iv treason to ye, mein lieber.  Our illustrious ancesthor, Fridrick th' Great, was a cheap an' common man compared to me, an' ye, august brother, niver got by th' barrier.  I hope I'll have time to cool down befure I get home or ye'll have to lock me up.  \"'They're givin' me th' fine line iv entertainmint.  Ivrywhere I go, they'se music or something that does as well.  I have a musical insthrument called a catastrophone in me room that plays th' Watch on th' Rhine whin I go in at night an' get up in th' mornin'. Whin I go out on th' sthreet, th' crowd cries \"Hock th' Kaiser.\" I wish they'd stop hockin' ye, dear brother, an' hock th' Watch on th' Rhine.  (This here is an American joke.  I'm gettin' on fast.) I'm goin' to be took to th' opry some night this week. They've fired a lot iv la-ads out iv their boxes to make room f'r me.  Wan iv thim objected, but he was fired annyhow.  Aftherward I'm goin' to ate dinner with th' iditors iv th' counthry.  Won't that be nice? I suppose I'm th' first Hohnezollern that iver took dinner with an iditor, though our fam'ly has often given thim food an' lodgin'--in jail.  I wish ye was here to go with me.  Ye've had more journylistic expeeryence an' manny iv th' things ye've had printed wudden't seem too unthrue to th' other guests.  Th' newspapers has been mos' kind to me, I might say almost too kind. I am sindin' ye a photygraft iv mesilf in me bath, took be flashlight be an iditor concealed on th' top iv th' clothes press, an' an interview be a lady rayporther who riprisinted hersilf as th' Queen iv Ohio.  \"'But th' big ivint comes off tomorrah.  I am actually invited to a dinner iv wan hundherd iv th' riprisintative business men iv New York an' a few Christyans ast in aftherward.  Hooray, hooray! Mind ye, these ar-re not ordhn'ry business men.  Far fr'm it.  No one gets in unless he has made at laste eight millyion marks out iv th' sivinty millyion marks in this counthry.  An' I'm ast to meet thim! What fun! I bet 'twill be jolly.  I'm goin' to buy me a table f'r computin' inthrest, a copy iv th' naytional bankin' act an' a good account iv th' thransactions in sterlin' exchange f'r th' current year an' whin th' quip an' jest go round, I'll be no skeleton at th' feast.  \"'Ye can see be this that me life has been almost too gay, but th' merrymint goes blithely on.  Fr'm here I go to Bawstown where I expict to pat th' Bunker Hill monymint on th' head an' have a look at th' new railway station.  Then I will take in Buffly, Cichago (pro-nounced Sichawgo), Saint Looey, Three Rapids, Idaho, Pinnsylvanya, an' mos' iv th' large cities iv th' west, includin' Chatahooga where wan iv th' gr-reat battles iv th' rivolution was fought between Gin'ral Sigel an' Gin'ral Zollycoffer.  I ixpict to larn a good deal about th' steel, pork, corn, lard an' lithrachoor iv th' counthry befure I rayturn.  But this buttherfly existence is killin' me.  It is far too gay.  I suppose whin I was younger, I wud've injyed it, but me time f'r socyal fistivities has passed an' I long f'r th' quiet iv home life among th' simple ryelties iv Europe.  Ye'ers, Hinnery.'  \"Yes, he's havin' a good time.  But what th' pa-apers calls th' climax iv th' intertainmint will be reached whin he arrives in Chicago.  Schwartzmeister an' I will rayceive him.  Schwartzmeister's fam'ly knew his in th' ol' counthry.  He had an uncle that was booted all th' way fr'm Sedan to Paris be a cousin iv th' Prince. We've arranged th' programme as far as Ar-rchey road is consarned. Monday mornin', visit to Kennedy's packin' house; afthernoon, Riordan's blacksmith shop; avenin', 'Th' Two Orphans,' at th' Halsted sthreet opry house.  Choosdah, iliven A.M., inspiction iv th' rollin' mills ; afthernoon, visit to Feeney's coal yard; avenin', 'Bells iv Corneville,' at th' opry house.  Winsdah mornin', tug ride on th' river fr'm Thirty-first sthreet to Law's coal yard; afthernoon, a call on th' tanneries, th' cable barn an' th' brick yards; avenin', dinner an' rayciption be th' retail saloonkeepers.  There's th' whole programme.  They may think in New York they are givin' him a good time but we'll show him what gayety ra-aly is, an' inform him iv th' foundation iv our supreemacy as a nation.  That's what he wants to see an' we'll show it to him.\"  \"Goowan,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"He don't know ye.\"  \"I bet ye he knows me as much as he knows thim,\" said Mr. Dooley. \"To a ra-ale prince, they can't be much diff'rence between a man who sells liquor be th' pail an' wan that sells it be th' distillery, between a man that makes a horseshoe an' wan that makes a mlllyion tons iv steel.  We're all alike to him--Carnaygie, Rockyfellar, Morgan, Schwartzmeister an' me.\"  \"Well, he certainly has been well rayceived,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"I wondher,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"if he thinks 'tis on th' square!\"     Cuba vs. Beet Sugar   \"What's all this about Cubia an' th' Ph'lippeens?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"What's beet sugar?\"  \"Th' throuble about Cubia is that she's free; th' throuble about beet sugar is we're not; an' th' throuble about th' Ph'lippeens is th' Ph'lippeen throuble,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"As rega-ards Cubia, she's like a woman that th' whole neighborhood helps to divoorce fr'm a crool husband, but nivertheless a husband, an' a miserable home but a home, an' a small credit at th' grocery but a credit, an' thin whin she goes into th' dhressmakin' business, rayfuse to buy annything fr'm her because she's a divoorced woman.  We freed Cubia but we didn't free annything she projooces.  It wasn't her fault.  We didn't think.  We expicted that all we had to do was to go down to Sandago with a kinetoscope an' sthrike th' shackles fr'm th' slave an' she'd be comfortable even if she had no other protiction f'r her poor feet.  We f'rgot about th' Beet.  Most iv us niver thought about that beautiful but fragile flower excipt biled in conniction with pigs' feet or pickled in its own life juice.  We didn't know that upon th' Beet hangs th' fate iv th' nation, th' hope iv th' future, th' permanence iv our instichoochions an' a lot iv other things akelly precious.  Th' Beet is th' naytional anthem an', be hivins, it looks as though it might be th' naytional motto befure long.  \"Well, Cubia got her freedom or something that wud look like th' same thing if she kept it out iv th' rain, but somehow or another it didn't suit her entirely.  A sort iv cravin' come over her that it was hard to tell fr'm th' same feelin' iv vacancy that she knew whin she was opprissed be th' Hated Casteel.  Hunger, Hinnissy, is about th' same thing in a raypublic as in a dispotism.  They'se not much choice iv unhappiness between a hungry slave an' a hungry freeman.  Cubia cudden't cuk or wear freedom.  Ye can't make freedom into a stew an' ye can't cut a pair iv pants out iv it.  It won't bile, fry, bake or fricassee.  Ye can't take two pounds iv fresh creamery freedom, a pound iv north wind, a heapin' taycupfull iv naytional aspirations an' a sprinklin' iv bars fr'm th' naytional air, mix well, cuk over a hot fire an' sarve sthraight fr'm th' shtove; ye can't make a dish out iv that that wud nourish a tired freeman whin he comes home afther a hard day's wurruk lookin' f'r a job.  So Cubia comes te us an' says she: 'Ye done well by us,' she says.  'Ye give us freedom,' says she, 'an' more thin enough to go round,' she says, 'an' now if ye plaze we'd like to thrade a little iv it bhack f'r a few groceries,' she says.  'We will wear wan shackle f'r a ham,' says she, 'an' we'll put on a full raygalia iv ball an' chain an' yoke an' fetters an' come-alongs f'r a square meal,' says she.  \"That sounds raisonable enough an' bein' be nature a gin'rous people whin we don't think, we're about to help her disthress with whativer we have cold in th' panthry whin th' thought iv th' Beet crosses our minds.

Roberts       La vie est vaine:   Un peu d'amour,   Un peu de haine...   Et puis--bonjour!    La vie est breve:   Un peu d'espoir,   Un peu de reve...   Et puis--bonsoir!    Leon Montenaeken     Foreword  My young friend Dennis has honoured me with a request to write a preface to his book.  I think a man can best write a preface to his own book, provided he knows it is good.  Also if he knows it is bad.  \"The Sentimental Bloke\", while running through the Bulletin, brightened up many dark days for me.  He is more perfect than any alleged \"larrikin\" or Bottle-O character I have ever attempted to sketch, not even excepting my own beloved Benno. Take the first poem for instance, where the Sentimental Bloke gets the hump.  How many men, in how many different parts of the world--and of how many different languages--have had the same feeling--the longing for something better--to be something better?  The exquisite humour of The Sentimental Bloke speaks for itself; but there's a danger that its brilliance may obscure the rest, especially for minds, of all stations, that, apart from sport and racing, are totally devoted to boiling        \"The cabbitch storks or somethink\"  in this social \"pickle found-ery\" of ours.  Doreen stands for all good women, whether down in the smothering alleys or up in the frozen heights.  And so, having introduced the little woman (they all seem \"little\" women), I \"dips me lid\"-- and stand aside.  HENRY LAWSON   SYDNEY, 1st September, 1915.       Contents    I.

A Spring Song     The world 'as got me snouted jist a treat;     Crool Forchin's dirty left 'as smote me soul;   An' all them joys o' life I 'eld so sweet     Is up the pole.   Fer, as the poit sez, me 'eart 'as got     The pip wiv yearnin' fer--I dunno wot.    I'm crook; me name is Mud; I've done me dash;     Me flamin' spirit's got the flamin' 'ump!   I'm longin' to let loose on somethin' rash....     Aw, I'm a chump!   I know it; but this blimed ole Springtime craze     Fair outs me, on these dilly, silly days.    The young green leaves is shootin' on the trees,     The air is like a long, cool swig o' beer,   The bonzer smell o' flow'rs is on the breeze,     An' 'ere's me, 'ere,   Jist moochin' round like some pore, barmy coot,     Of 'ope, an' joy, an' forchin destichoot.    I've lorst me former joy in gettin' shick,     Or 'eadin' browns; I 'aven't got the 'eart   To word a tom; an', square an' all,     I'm sick of that cheap tart   'Oo chucks 'er carkis at a feller's 'ead     An' mauls 'im...Ar! I wish't that I wus dead!...    Ther's little breezes stirrin' in the leaves,     An' sparrers chirpin' 'igh the 'ole day long;   An' on the air a sad, sweet music breaves     A bonzer song--   A mournful sorter choon thet gits a bloke     Fair in the brisket 'ere, an' makes 'im choke ...    What is the matter wiv me?...I dunno.     I got a sorter yearnin' 'ere inside,   A dead-crook sorter thing that won't let go     Or be denied--   A feelin' like I want to do a break,     An' stoush creation for some woman's sake.    The little birds is chirpin' in the nest,     The parks an' gardings is a bosker sight,   Where smilin' tarts walks up an' down, all dressed     In clobber white.   An', as their snowy forms goes steppin' by,     It seems I'm seekin' somethin' on the sly.    Somethin' or someone--I don't rightly know;     But, seems to me, I'm kind er lookin' for   A tart I knoo a 'undred years ago,     Or, maybe, more.   Wot's this I've 'eard them call that thing?...Geewhizz!   Me ideel bit o' skirt!  That's wot it is!    Me ideel tart!... An', bli'me, look at me!     Jist take a squiz at this, an' tell me can   Some square an' honist tom take this to be     'Er own true man?   Aw, Gawd!  I'd be as true to 'er, I would     As straight an' stiddy as...Ar, wot's the good?    Me, that 'as done me stretch fer stoushin' Johns,     An' spen's me leisure gittin' on the shick,   An' 'arf me nights down there, in Little Lon.,     Wiv Ginger Mick,   Jist 'eadin' 'em, an' doing in me gilt.     Tough luck!  I s'pose it's 'ow a man is built.    It's 'ow Gawd builds a bloke; but don't it 'urt     When 'e gits yearnin's fer this 'igher life,   On these Spring mornin's, watchin' some sweet skirt     Some fucher wife--   Go sailin' by, an' turnin' on his phiz     The glarssy eye--fer bein' wot 'e is.     I've watched 'em walkin' in the gardings 'ere     Cliners from orfices an' shops an' such;   The sorter skirts I dursn't come too near,     Or dare to touch.   An, when I see the kind er looks they carst...     Gorstrooth!  Wot is the use o' me, I arst?    Wot wus I slung 'ere for? An wot's the good     Of yearnin' after any ideel tart?...   Ar, if a bloke wus only understood!     'E's got a 'eart:   'E's got a soul inside 'im, poor or rich.     But wot's the use, when 'Eaven's crool'd 'is pitch?    I tells meself some day I'll take a pull     An' look eround fer some good, stiddy job,   An' cut the push fer good an' all; I'm full     Of that crook mob!   An', in some Spring the fucher 'olds in store,     I'll cop me prize an' long in vain no more.    The little winds is stirrin' in the trees,     Where little birds is chantin' lovers' lays;   The music of the sorft an' barmy breeze...     Aw, spare me days!   If this 'ere dilly feelin' doesn't stop     I'll lose me block an' stoush some flamin' cop!      II. The Intro     'Er name's Doreen ...Well spare me bloomin' days!   You could er knocked me down wiv 'arf a brick!     Yes, me, that kids meself I know their ways,     An' 'as a name for smoogin' in our click!   I just lines up an' tips the saucy wink.   But strike! The way she piled on dawg! Yer'd think     A bloke was givin' back-chat to the Queen....      'Er name's Doreen.    I seen 'er in the markit first uv all,   Inspectin' brums at Steeny Isaacs' stall.     I backs me barrer in--the same ole way--     An' sez, \"Wot O!  It's been a bonzer day.   'Ow is it fer a walk?\"...Oh, 'oly wars!   The sorter look she gimme!  Jest becors     I tried to chat 'er, like you'd make a start      Wiv ANY tart.    An' I kin take me oaf I wus perlite.   An' never said no word that wasn't right,     An' never tried to maul 'er, or to do     A thing yeh might call crook.  Ter tell yeh true,   I didn't seem to 'ave the nerve--wiv 'er.   I felt as if I couldn't go that fur,     An' start to sling off chiack like I used...      Not INTRAJUICED!    Nex' time I sighted 'er in Little Bourke,   Where she was in a job. I found'er lurk     Wus pastin' labels in a pickle joint,     A game that--any'ow, that ain't the point.   Once more I tried ter chat 'er in the street,   But, bli'me!  Did she turn me down a treat!     The way she tossed 'er 'cad an' swished 'er skirt!      Oh, it wus dirt!    A squarer tom, I swear, I never seen,   In all me natchril, than this 'ere Doreen.     It wer'n't no guyver neither; fer I knoo     That any other bloke 'ad Buckley's 'oo   Tried fer to pick 'er up. Yes, she was square.   She jist sailed by an' lef' me standin' there     Like any mug. Thinks I, \"I'm out er luck,\"      An' done a duck    Well, I dunno.  It's that way wiv a bloke.   If she'd ha' breasted up ter me an' spoke,     I'd thort 'er jist a commin bit er fluff,     An' then fergot about 'er, like enough.   It's jest like this.  The tarts that's 'ard ter get   Makes you all 'ot to chase 'em, an' to let     The cove called Cupid get an 'ammer-lock;      An' lose yer block.    I know a bloke 'oo knows a bloke 'oo toils   In that same pickle found-ery. ('E boils     The cabbitch storks or somethink.)  Anyway,     I gives me pal the orfis fer to say   'E 'as a sister in the trade 'oo's been   Out uv a jorb, an' wants ter meet Doreen;     Then we kin get an intro, if we've luck.      'E sez, \"Ribuck.\"    O' course we worked the oricle; you bet!   But, 'struth, I ain't recovered frum it yet!     'Twas on a Saturdee, in Colluns Street,     An'--quite by accident, o' course--we meet.   Me pal 'e trots 'er up an' does the toff   'E allus wus a bloke fer showin' off.     \"This 'ere's Doreen,\" 'e sez. \"This 'ere's the Kid.\"      I dips me lid.    \"This 'ere's Doreen,\" 'e sez.  I sez \"Good day.\"   An', bli'me, I 'ad nothin' more ter say!     I couldn't speak a word, or meet 'er eye.     Clean done me block!  I never been so shy.   Not since I was a tiny little cub,   An' run the rabbit to the corner pub--     Wot time the Summer days wus dry an' 'ot--      Fer me ole pot.    Me! that 'as barracked tarts, an' torked an' larft,   An' chucked orf at 'em like a phonergraft!     Gorstrooth! I seemed to lose me pow'r o' speech.     But, 'er!  Oh, strike me pink!  She is a peach!   The sweetest in the barrer!  Spare me days,   I carn't describe that cliner's winnin' ways.     The way she torks!  'Er lips!  'Er eyes!  'Er hair!...    "]]]
