KATE VERNON.  A Tale.  _IN THREE VOLUMES._  VOL. I.    LONDON:   THOMAS CAUTLEY NEWBY, PUBLISHER,   30, WELBECK STREET, CAVENDISH SQUARE.   1854.     KATE VERNON.     PART FIRST.     CHAPTER I.  THE BALL.   The autumn of 18-- was as uncomfortable and _triste_ a season as I have ever known; commerce and crops alike looked down--respectable prophets of Tory tendencies shook their heads with redoubled vigor and gloomy but intense satisfaction at the near approach of that total ruin they had so often foretold; and the unfortunate devils of starving mechanics, unable to solve the problem of depression, were raising shindies by way of relieving their minds. Under these circumstances, it pleased the Horse Guards, in the plenitude of their power and inhumanity, to banish Her Majesty's -- Regiment of Light Dragoons to an infernal region of smoke and \"sansculottism\" situated in the west of England, and known to mortals as the wealthy and busy town of Carrington.  Here then were we hurried at the very beginning of grouse shooting, from first-rate quarters in North Britain.  Terrible was the change which came o'er all our spirits; every thing was against us; I do not believe I ever saw such rain. Byron talks about \"nature's tear drops,\"--she gave us a shower bath! The effect of all this may be imagined. I am certain it was that fatal quarter confirmed our Major in the deep rooted love for \"Kingston's old port,\" which finally cut him off at 65, while pretty little Mrs. Pemberton, the paymaster's wife, no longer guided in the way she should go, by fashion and the aristocracy, fell from the right path into a meeting house, and eloped with the preacher! But our rulers care little for our morals.  _Au commencement_, the rich manufacturers were very civil, and gave us some most enormous dinners. Their daughters, pretty girls enough, we found tolerable, as women must always be, even under the most distressing circumstances; but we had nothing to talk of to them. It was so confounding to try conversation with girls who had not a single subject in common with you; who looked on sporting as loss of time, and to whom all one's allusions, illustrations, and even good stories were an unknown tongue. Their brothers were \"very awful,\" as Sammy Spectre says; and, when we asked the fellows to mess, they got so brutally drunk, and talked such stupid slang, we were thoroughly disgusted; so when the first terror of burnt mills and broken windows was passed, and the respectable cotton spinners, taking time to breathe, collected their scattered faculties, and remembered their dislike to the military, we were most ready to dispense with their society, and our communications were soon almost totally cut off.  Such was our position towards the beginning of September, when one morning, as I was forgetting my misfortunes in Alison's Account of the Vendean War, which in all probability I should have never read but for our unlucky change of quarters, Tom Ashley broke into my room, exclaiming, \"Keep your books for a _dernier ressort_ my dear fellow! Come along and get your tickets.\"  \"For what,\" said I peevishly, for I am capable of acknowledging an author's magic sometimes.  \"No humbug! You do not mean to say you have not read the placards announcing the Festival in the New Music Hall? Grisi, Mario, and all the rest of them. A grand mass in G, and something still grander in Z?\"  \"No! I know nothing about it.\"  \"Well, know it now! There are to be three days' hard work. Sacred and scientific in the morning; profane and light in the evening; to wind up with a fancy and full dress ball on Thursday.\"  \"Well, it is something to do, so I am _à vos ordres, mon cher_,\" said I, taking my hat.  We found the town full of fresh looking country faces, and, after some delay and crowding, secured our tickets. The oratorio was very like all other oratorios; the concert like all other concerts. There were airs in both that made one think some other world must exist besides this one of duns and devilry, and art and army agents. But a glance at the singers, one thought of their characters was quite enough to dispel any heavenly illusions. I have since tasted the exquisite enjoyment of hearing the lovely tones and words \"I know that my Redeemer liveth,\" thrill from pure lips, and then I knew what music meant; but at the time of which I write I felt that any better feeling roused in me was false, both in cause and effect.  All our fellows liked music, or were used to it; but I think they were glad enough to kick their heels at the ball. I found myself there about eleven o'clock, listening to a very inspiriting quadrille, and gazing at the pretty little plebs and their snobbish partners, wondering if they really could be satisfied to waste their sweetness on such specimens of humanity (for there is a natural refinement about women); and the brutes were so pre-occupied with self, so divested of that profound attention I always thought every woman expected, otherwise there was little to distinguish the gathering from a ball at Lady Y----s or Lady L----s; the lights, music, and refreshments, were first rate, the dresses handsome, many in good taste; the thing wanting was the spirit of easy enjoyment which only people sufficiently well bred to be natural dare venture on. Occupied in these philosophic reflections, I stood among a group of my brother officers, who were mingling their critiques of the morning's concert with strictures on the mob round us, when my eye was caught by a pair of fair graceful shoulders to the right in front of me; there was something indescribable in the proud deer-like carriage of the head, with its simple classic knot of chestnut brown hair, which made me almost involuntarily exclaim \"That is a gentlewoman whoever she is;\" and nervously anxious to see if a _nez retroussé_ or _un nez noble_ adorned the countenance which was hidden from me, I edged my way into a commanding but unremarkable position. It was neither, but one that harmonised well with her broad smooth forehead and short tremulous upper lip; the general expression of the face was a sort of proud yet gentle sadness, perhaps thoughtfulness is the best word. Above middle height, her easy rounded figure moved slightly and apparently unconsciously to the music, while her dress (and this I always consider a most important characteristic) was very gauzy and white, and perfectly without ornament except, indeed, a bouquet of brilliant flowers which seemed to fasten the folds over the bosom. How little does this miserable description convey the impression of grace and harmony this fair girl's countenance and figure stamped upon my mind! but I know were I to write for ever I should still be dissatisfied.  There was a _fierté_ so thorough bred and yet so soft in her air, that I could have imagined her at home in the most splendid court, and what rendered this perhaps more striking, was the remarkable contrast presented by her companions.  She was leaning one arm on the back of a seat occupied by a little thin woman like a respectable housekeeper, with a fierce contrivance of lace and flowers on her head; beside her, and also behind the chair, was a plump comfortable looking man, past middle age, whose round rosy face was adorned with two little restless laughing twinkling black eyes; a large bunch of seals to a black ribbon appeared below his waistcoat in bygone style, held up in a sort of relief by the goodly protuberance below. As I glanced at these details, this last individual said something to his beautiful companion with a sort of gravity over all his face except the eyes; she bent her head gently to hear, and then her lips parted with such a smile, that I wondered I could have thought her countenance expressed pride, thought, anything, but happy merriment: such a smile must come from the heart.      \"And where it most sparkled, no glance could discover     In eyes, lip, or cheek, for she brightened all over.\"  That finished me, \"I must know her, I must dance with her,\" I exclaimed.  \"Yes, but how,\" said Burton, who had been watching me, \"I was trying to find out who she is before you came in, and no one knows them.\"  \"How very odd,\" said Ashley.  \"She is so strangely unlike the people with her, and all the others,\" said I.  \"Ah! Egerton has received a death blow.\"  \"Command yourself my dear fellow.\"  \"She must be Cinderella under the chaperonage of the cook and butler.\"  \"I am determined,\" said I, \"to know her, and _selon les régles_; for that is no young lady to treat with scant ceremony.\"  So saying, I took Burton's arm and moved off to try and catch one of the Stewards; we succeeded, but the savage would do nothing; \"didn't like\" and \"could not say.\" So we left him; and Burton was laughingly pouring forth consolations, when I exclaimed, \"I have it! I will pretend to recognise her as some acquaintance;--profound deference--many apologies &c. Eh? get up a little conversation, it requires nerve, but you know I am half Irish!\"  \"It requires great tact and impudence; I wish you well thro' it,\" said Burton gravely.  This little conversation took place near a pillar, of which there was a row, two and two, across both ends of the room, dividing it into three compartments; the centre and largest of which formed the ball room. On re-entering it we missed the group of which we were in search, and for a moment I thought that my inexorable ill-luck had sent them home; but no! I soon discovered the unmistakeable profile close to the very pillar at the other side of which we had held our consultation. \"Done! by all that's unfortunate,\" I exclaimed. \"No, no,\" said Burton, \"it is impossible they could have overheard us, besides, they may have only just got there.\"  \"Well, _coute qui coute_, I will venture.\"  \"And I will watch.\"  The "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#1)"],["body","moment I was bowing profoundly with all the grace I could muster. \"I fear I am too presumptuous in hoping that you do not quite forget me.\"  She gazed on me at first with such a puzzled but full and steady glance from her dark clear grey eyes, that I felt ashamed of myself; then again sparkling all over with a smile and look of recognition, she held out her hand, saying quietly--\"I am very stupid not to know you at once, but the moustache alters you, and it is a long time since I saw you; how is your brother?\"  I was electrified--the most cutting declaration that my flimsy artifice was seen thro', could not have perplexed me more. A momentary glance showed me Burton, standing transfixed, with mouth and eyes wide open; then rallying my scattered ideas I hastened to avail myself of this happy mistake, and answered that my brother was quite well, and would be delighted to hear I had met her. She bowed. But I had a brother, could she really know him? Her next words solved the problem: \"How did he like your leaving the regiment? It was so pleasant to be always together,\" murmuring something of submission to necessity. I begged her to join the quadrille then forming, to which, after some slight hesitation, she assented, saying to her friends, \"Shall I find you here?\" \"Yes,\" said \"he of the seals,\" as G. P. R. James would call him, \"I am glad you are going to dance;\" the little woman gave her a smile and a nod, and we joined the quadrille. Longing to draw her from her reminiscences which kept me in a frightful state of mind lest I should make a false step, not daring to start almost any topic lest it should betray me, I feel convinced I presented an illustration of the acme of boobyism. At length I ventured to remark that I was surprised not to have seen her at any of the oratorios; this was true at all events. \"We only came over for yesterday's performances,\" she said, \"and arriving very early we got up near the orchestra. How superb that double chorus was. I should like to have heard it in some huge dim cathedral; the theatric decorations of that concert room seemed to jar upon the eye.\"  \"Yes! I quite agree with you; I am certain had I heard it under those circumstances I should have been ready to shave my head, tie a cord round my waist, and join the Franciscans _sur l'instant_!\"  I felt more at ease--\"If I can avoid my brother and the old regiment I am tolerably safe.\" I thought--\"if I could get the smallest glimpse of who I am I should go ahead famously.\"  A few more sentences, broken by the movements of the dance, when my partner, returning to me, again threw me off my centre, by suddenly raising her eyes to mine with a sort of demure merriment sparkling in them, saying, \"You have not enquired for any of your old friends! But, military memories are proverbially short, and yours is no exception I fear.\" Passing over the dangerous commencement of this speech, I launched into a glowing defence of military memories in general, and my own in particular, and wound up by entreating her to give me the fullest intelligence of all my old friends. She shook her head, \"Ah! those generalities speak but badly of the kindliness of recollection I like.\" Good Heavens! I was getting deeper in the mire; the rich soft tones that could not be uttered by any one not possessed both of heart and intellect, seemed to sink into mine! So, hastily stammering that she did me great injustice, I reiterated my request for all the news she could impart. \"I suppose you know all about the--\"  \"I cannot remember the numbers of regiments,\" said she, looking to me for the word.  \"Oh! of course,\" said I hastily, \"a copious correspondence places me pretty well _au fond_.\"  \"Yes! but my cousin, I know you will be glad to hear though you have not the grace to ask, is still abroad, and, I hear, as beautiful as ever, and refusing all that princes and peers can offer to induce her again to try the lottery of marriage.\"  \"Ah! the loved are not always soon forgotten,\" said I, trying to chime in with the tone of subdued feeling which seemed to pervade all my fair companion said. She looked at me with an air of disapprobation and replied gravely, \"Notwithstanding their great disparity of years, my cousin did truly and deeply feel her husband's loss.\" I had better take care! could I but draw her off from her confounded cousin! At that moment she dropped her fan; I looked at it for a moment before restoring it to her; it was antique, with gold sticks, and of great value, the only part of her toilet that bespoke wealth. \"You remember that fan and Lady Desmond's grand ball?\" said she smiling. \"Indeed I do,\" I exclaimed, enraptured to have learned at one _coup_ that Dublin was the scene of our acquaintance and that Lady Desmond was a mutual friend. Here, however, the quadrille ended, and accepting my arm, my unknown belle turned her steps and mine, _malgré moi_, in the direction of the oft mentioned pillars, near which we had left her chaperons; but those deserving individuals had, with praiseworthy carelessness, disappeared, and my companion after looking round in vain, said, in a somewhat anxious tone, \"they are certainly not here, I shall never find them again.\" I suggested the probability of nature requiring support, and that the refreshment room would be the most likely place in which to recover her lost guardians.  Assenting to this, and to my proposal of an ice, we were soon moving _en masse_ with the other dancers towards the tea rooms, and now, freed _pro. tem._ from the incubus of cousins and brothers, whom my partner appeared to forget in her keen appreciation of the many ridiculous points in the mob around her, I felt my spirits rise to concert pitch, the embargo on my tongue removed, and, fancying myself most agreeable, the passage to the refreshment table seemed to me to be performed with miraculous rapidity.--Here, after a short inspection, we discovered the missing individuals, and hastening towards them with speed I thought rather ungracious, this puzzling, but fascinating girl, with an inclination of the head and a smile in which much suppressed mirth seemed struggling, dropped my arm and took her station beside her incongruous companions. But I was not to be so easily sent adrift; I had not served a twelve or thirteen years' apprenticeship to ball rooms to be thus dismissed if I choose to stay; so with a deferential bow, \"I shall bring your ice here,\" said I; and rapidly securing one, I had the satisfaction of hearing her say, as I approached with it, as if in continuation of something, \"knew him slightly in Dublin, a long time ago;\" which, in some measure, placed me _au dessous des cartes_; for if only a slight acquaintance, I could not be expected to have very many subjects or reminiscences in common with her; so resolutely determined to stand my ground, have another dance, learn who she really was, and, if possible, lay the foundation of a future acquaintance, I took up a position beside the beautiful incognita, and ventured to discuss Ireland in a guarded and general manner, observing, with perfect truth, that two of the pleasantest years of my life had been spent there. I could perceive a decided increase of cordiality in Miss ---- (what would I not have given to know the name) as I pronounced this eulogy on her native country--for I had soon guessed, by the indescribable spirit of frankness, arch, yet tempered with a certain dignity in its gay _abandon_, which pervaded her manner, that she was Irish--and just as she had turned laughingly to answer some playful charge against its characteristics, spoken apparently through a medium of mashed potatoes in his throat, by the man with the seals, Burton touched my arm, \"Egerton, don't keep all your luck to yourself, introduce me.\"  \"Hold your tongue--for Heaven's sake, my dear fellow,\" I exclaimed in a rapid aside--\"don't breathe my name: at this moment I have not the most remote idea who I am, and am constantly on the verge of an unpardonable scrape; be silent and begone, I will tell you all afterwards.\" Silenced and amazed, poor Burton retired, and my unknown friend, turning to me as I stood elate at having conquered difficulties, again showed me my uncertain footing by observing--\"But you used to cherish the most heretical opinions on these points, and offend me not a little by their open avowal.\" What an ill-bred savage she must identify me with! \"Raw boys are always odious and irrational; you should not have deigned to listen to me,\" said I in despair.  \"Oh! you were by no means a raw boy, you looked quite as old as you do now; besides, it is not half a century since we met,\" she replied, with another distracting look; and then--with a merry burst of apparently irrepressible laughter, in which, though I could not account for it, her friends and myself joined--it was so infectious, added--\"You must forgive me, but really your reminiscences seem to be in such inextricable confusion, I cannot help laughing.\" In an agony lest all should be discovered--with the respectable couple before-mentioned for umpires, I urged in defence \"that my memory was like the background of a picture from which one figure alone stood out clear and well defined.\" Then, observing that she was beating time to the sound of a most delicious waltz just begun, \"Am I too unreasonable to ask for a waltz as well as a quadrille,\" I said. She half shook her head, then, smiling to her companions, observed--\"It is so long since I had a waltz I cannot resist it; shall I keep you too late, _Caro Maestro_?\" \"No, no,\" said the lady with the cap, \"we will go and watch you.\" In a few moments I was whirling my fair incognita round to the inspiring strains of the Elfin Waltz, then new and unhacknied.  What a delicious waltz that was! My partner seemed endowed with the very spirit of the dance: her light pliant form seemed to respond to every tone of the music, and not an unpractised _valseur_ myself, I felt that I was, at all"]]]
