Blake, it turned out, had known all about the old story, so he was a safe person.  Not that safety mattered much.  \"Lady Hester Lea\"--she called herself so now, as, indeed, she had every right--was making it known at Shinglebay.  So Torwood came out.  I was very anxious, of course, and had been hovering about on the nursery stairs, where I had gone to see whether baby was quietly asleep, and I overtook him as he was going down-stairs.  \"How is papa?\" I asked.  I shall never forget the white look of the face he raised up to mine as he said, \"Poor father!  Ursula, I can only call the news terrible. Will you try to stand up against it bravely?\"  And then he held out his arms and gathered me into them, and I believe I said, \"I can bear anything when you do that!\"  I thought it could only be something about Bertram, who had rather a way of getting into scrapes, and I said his name; but just as Fulk was setting me at ease on that score, Jaquetta, who was on the watch, too, opened the door of the green drawing-room, and we were obliged to go in.  Then, hardly answering her and Emily, as they asked after papa, he stood straight up in the middle of the rug and told us, beginning with--\"Ursula, did you know that our father had been married as a young man in Canada?\"  No. We had never guessed it.  \"He was,\" my brother went on, \"This is his daughter.\"  \"Our sister!\" Jaquetta asked.  \"Where has she been all this time?\"  But I saw there must be more to trouble him, and then it came.  \"I cannot tell.  My father had every reason to believe that--she--his first wife--had been killed in a massacre by the Red Indians; but if what this person says is true, she only died two years ago.  But it was in all good faith that he married our mother.  He had taken all means to discover--\"  Even then we did not perceive what this involved.  I felt stunned and numbed chiefly from seeing the great shock it had been to my father and to him; but poor little Jaquetta and Emily were altogether puzzled; and Jaquetta said, \"But is this sister of ours such a very disagreeable person, Torwood?  Why didn't you bring her in and show her to us?\"  Then he exclaimed, almost angrily at her simplicity, \"Good heavens! girls, don't you see what it all means?  If this is true, I am not Torwood.  We are nothing--nobody--nameless.\"  He turned to the fire, put both elbows on the mantelshelf, and hid his face in his hands.  Emily sprang up, and tried to draw down his arm; and she did, but he only used it to put her from him, hold her off at arm's length, and look at her--oh! with such a tender face of firm sorrow!  \"Ah! Emily,\" he said; \"you too!  It has been all on false pretences! That will have to be all over now.\"  Then Emily's great brown eyes grew bigger with wonder and dismay.  \"False pretences!\" she cried, \"what false pretences?  Not that you cared for me, Torwood.\"  \"Not that I cared for you,\" he said, with a suppressed tone that made his voice _so_ deep!  \"Not that _I_ cared, but that Lord Torwood did--Torwood is the baby upstairs.\"  \"But it is you--you--you--Fulk!\" said Emily, trying to creep and sidle up to him, white doe fashion.  I believe nobody had ever called him by his Christian name before, and it made it sweeter to him, but still he did not give in.  \"Ah! that's all very well,\" he said, and his voice was softer then, \"but what would your mother say?\"  \"The same as I do,\" said Emily, undauntedly.  \"How should it change one's feelings one bit,\" and she almost cried at being held back.  He did let her nestle up to him then, but with a sad sort of smile. \"My child, my darling,\" he said, \"I ought not to allow this!  It will only be the worse after!\"  But just then a servant's step made them start back, and a message came and brought word that Mr. Blake would be glad if Lord Torwood would step up.  Yes, my poor father was wandering in his speech, and very feverish, mixing up Adela and Faith Le Blanc strangely together sometimes, and at others fancying he was lying ill with his wound, and sending messages to Faith.  We sent for the doctor, but he could not do anything really.  It had been a death-blow, though the illness lasted a full week.  He knew us generally, and liked to see us, but he always had the sense that something dreadful had happened to us; and he would stroke my hand or Jaquetta's, and pity us.  He was haunted, too, by the sense that he ought to do something for us which he could not do.  We thought he meant to make a will, securing us something, but he was never in a condition in which my brother would have felt justified in getting him to sign it.  Indeed there was so little disease about him, and we thought he would get better, if only we could keep him free from distress and excitement; so we made his room as quiet as possible, and discouraged his talking or thinking.  Lady Hester came every day.  My brother had sent for Mr. Eagles, our solicitor, to meet her the first time, and look at her papers.  He said he could not deny that it looked very bad for us.  Of the original marriage there was no doubt; indeed, my father had told Torwood where to find the certificate of it, folded up in the secret drawer of his desk, with his commission in the army; and the register of Faith's burial was only too plain.  The only chance there was for us was, that her identity could not be established; but Mr. Eagles did not think it would go off on this.  The whole of her life seemed to be traceable; besides, there was something about Hester that forbade all suspicion of her being a conscious impostor.  Whether she would be able to prove herself my father's daughter was another more doubtful point. That, however, made no difference, except as to her own rank and fortune.  If the first wife were proved to have been alive till 1836, then little Alured was the only true heir to the title and estate, and, next after him, stood Hester Lea and her son.  People said she was like the family; I never could see it, and always thought the likeness due to their imagination.  She took one by surprise.  She was a tall, well-made woman, with a narrow waist, and a proud, peculiarly upright bearing, though quick, almost sharp in all her movements, and especially with her eyes.  Those eyes, I confess, always startled me.  They were clear, bright blue, well opened eyes--honest eyes one would have called them--only they appeared to be always searching about, and darting at one when one least expected it. The red and white of the face too always had a clear hard look, like the eyes; the teeth projected a little, and were so very, very white, that they always seemed to me to flash like the eyes; and if ever she smiled, it was as much as to say, \"I don't believe you.\"  Her nose had an amount of hook, too, that always gave me the feeling of having a wild hawk in the room with me.  Jaquetta used to call her a panther of the wilderness, but to my mind there was none of the purring cattish tenderness of the panther.  However, that might be only because she viewed us as her natural enemies, and was always on her guard against us, though I do not well know why; I am sure we only wanted to know the truth and do justice, and Fulk was so convinced that she would prove her case, and that there was no help for it, that at the end of hearing Mr. Eagles question her, he said, \"Well, the matter must be tried in due time, but since we are brothers and sisters, let us be friendly,\" and he held out his hand to her.  Mr. Eagles, who told me, said he could have beaten him for the imprudent admission, only he did look so generous and sweet and sad; and Lady Hester drew herself up doubtfully and proudly, as if she could hardly bear to own such a brother, but she did take his hand, coldly though, and saying, \"Let me see my father.\"  He was obliged to tell her that this was impossible.  I doubt whether she ever believed him--at least she used to gaze at him with her determined eyes, as if she meant to abash him out of falsehood, and she sharply questioned every one about Lord Trevorsham's state.  The determination to be friendly made my brother offer to take her to us.  She consented, but not very readily, and I am afraid we were needlessly cold and dry; but we were taken by surprise when my brother brought her into the sitting-room.  It was not very easy to welcome the woman who was going to turn us all out, and under such a stigma; and she--she could hardly be expected to look complacently at the interlopers who had her place, and the title she had a right to.  She put us through her hard catechism about my dear father's state, and said at last that she should like to see Lord Torwood.  Taken by surprise, we looked and signed towards him whom that name had always meant.  He smiled a little and said, \"Little Alured!  But, remember, I am bound to concede nothing till judicial minds are convinced.  The parties concerned cannot judge.  Can you venture to have Baby down, Ursula?\"  No, I did not venture.  I thought it might have been averted; but I was only obliged to take her up to the nurseries.  On the way up she asked which way my father's room lay.  I answered, \"Oh! across there;\" I did not know if she might not make a dash at it.  I think she must have heard at Shinglebay how delicate poor little Alured was, and thence gathered hopes of the succession for her boy, for she asked her sharp questions about his health all the way up, and knew that he had had fits.  I could not put her down as one generally can inquisitive people.  I suppose it was because she was more sensible of the difference in our real positions than I have as yet felt.  Baby was asleep; and I think she was touched by the actual sight of him.  She said he was very like her boy; and though I supposed that a mere assertion at the time, it was quite true.  Alured and Trevor Lea have always been remarkably alike.  However, she cross-"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4659"],["title","Lady Hester; Or, Ursula's Narrative (#4)"],["body","Nurse about his health even more minutely, and then took her leave; but she came again every day, walking after the first, as long as my dear father lived.  And she must have talked, for there came a kind of feeling over everyone, as well as ourselves, that something was hanging over us, of which the issue would be known when my father's illness took some turn.  Mr. Decies came every day to inquire, but I could not bear a strange eye, and Hester might have been looking on.  I was steeling myself against him.  Was I right?--oh! was I right?  I have wondered and grieved!  For I knew well enough what he had been thinking of for months before; only I did not want it to come to a point.  How was I to leave little Alured to Jaquetta? or disturb my father by breaking up his home?  I liked him on the whole, and had come the length of thinking that if I ever married at all, it would be-- But that's all nonsense; and mine could not have been what other people's love was, or I should not have shrunk from the sight and look of him.  If it had been only poverty that was coming, it would have been a different thing; but to be nameless impostors!  Mrs. Deerhurst had gone out on a round of visits, when Emily came to us, taking her younger daughter.  They were not a very letter-writing family.  It is odd how some people's pen is a real outlet of expression; while others seem to lack the nerve that might convey their thoughts to it, even when they live in more sympathy than Emily could well have had with her mother.  At least, so I understand, what afterwards we wondered at, that Emily never mentioned Hester; only saying, when, after some days she did write, that Lord Trevorsham was ill.  So Fulk had the one comfort of being with her when he was out of the sick room.  I used to see them from the window walking up and down the terrace in the blue east wind haze of those March days, never that I could see speaking.  I don't think my brother would have felt it honourable to tie one additional link between himself and her.  He had not a doubt as to how her mother would act, but to be in her dear little affectionate presence was a better help than we could give him, even though nothing passed between them.  Jaquetta used to wonder at them, and then try to go on the same as usual; and would wander about the garden and park with her dogs, and bring us in little anecdotes, and do all the laughing over them herself.  Poor child! she felt as if she were in a bad dream, and these were efforts to shake it off, and wake herself.  After all, nothing was ever so bad as those ten days!  But, my brother always said he was thankful for the respite and time for thought which they gave him.     CHAPTER III.  THE PEERAGE CASE.   The end came suddenly at last, when we were thinking my dear father more tranquil.  He passed away in sleep late one evening, just ten days after Hester's arrival.  She had gone back to her lodgings, and we did not send to tell her till the morning; but by nine o'clock she was in the house.  We had crept down to breakfast, Jaquetta and I, feeling very dreary in the half-light, and as if desolation had suddenly come on us; and when we heard her fly drive up to the door, Jaquetta cried out almost angrily, \"Torwood, how could you!\" and we would have run away, but he said, \"Stay, dear girls; it is better to have it over.\"  As she came in he rang the bell as if for family prayers, and she had only asked one or two questions, which he answered shortly, when all the servants came in, some crying sadly.  Fulk read a very few prayers--as much as he had voice for, and then, as all stood up, he had to clear his voice, but he spoke firmly enough.  \"It is right that you all should know that a grave doubt has arisen as to my position here.  Lord Trevorsham had every reason to believe his first wife had perished by the hands of the Red Indians long before he married my mother.  What he did was done in entire ignorance--no breath of blame must light on him.  This lady alleges that she can produce proofs that she is his daughter, and that her mother only died in February, '36.  If these proofs be considered satisfactory by a committee of the House of Lords, then she and Alured Torwood Trevor will be shown to be his only legitimate children.  I shall place the matter in the right hands as soon as possible--that is\" (for she was glaring at him), \"as soon as the funeral is over.  Until that decision is made I request that no one will call me by the title of him who is gone; but I shall remain here to take care of my little brother, whose guardian my father wished me to be; and for the present, at least, I shall make no change in the establishment.\"  I think everyone held their breath: there was a great stillness over all--a sort of hush of awe--and then some of the maids began sobbing, and the butler tried to say something, but he quite broke down; and just then a troubled voice cried out--  \"Torwood, Torwood, what is this?\"  And there we saw Bertram in the midst of us, with the haggard look of a man who had travelled all night, and a dismayed air that I can never forget.  He had been quartered at Belfast, and we had written to him the day after my father's illness, to summon him home, but there were no telegraphs nor railways; and there had been some hindrance about his leave, so that it had taken all that length of time to bring him. Fulk had left all to be told on his arrival.  He had come by the mail-coach, and walked up from the Trevorsham Arms, where he had been told of our father's death; and so had let himself in noiselessly, and was standing in the dining-room door, hearing all that Fulk said!  Poor fellow!  Jaquetta flung herself on him, hiding her face against him, while the servants went, and before any one else could speak, Hester stood forth, and said, to our amazement--  \"Captain Trevor!  You know me.  You can and must bear me witness, and do me justice--\"  \"You!  I have seen you before--but--where?  I beg your pardon,\" he said, bewildered.  \"You remember Sault St. Pierre farm?\" she said.  \"Sault St. Pierre!  What?  You are Mrs. Lea!  Good heavens!  Where is your mother?\"  \"My mother is dead, sir.  You were the first person who made known to her that her husband, my father, was not dead, but had taken--or pretended to take--an English woman for his wife.\"  \"Wait!\" thundered Fulk, \"whatever my father did was ignorantly and honourably done!\"  Bertram was as pale as death, and looked from one of us to the other, and at last, he gasped out--  \"And that--was what she meant?\"  \"There, sir,\" said Hester, turning to Torwood, \"You see your brother cannot deny it!  You will not refuse justice to me, and my son.\"  I fancy she expected that the house was to be given up to her, and that we were only to remain there on her sufferance, perhaps till after the funeral.  My brother spoke, \"Justice will no doubt be done; but the question does not lie between you and me, but between me and Alured.  It is, as I said, a peerage question--and will be decided by the peers. Incidentally, that enquiry will prove what is your position and rank, as well as what may or may not be ours.  Any further points depend upon my father's will, and that will be in the hands of Mr. Eagles. I think you can see that it would be impossible, as well as unfeeling, to take any steps until after the funeral.\"  Whatever Hester Lea was, she was a high-spirited being, standing there, a solitary woman, a stranger, with all of us four, and one whole household, as it must have seemed, against her.  I was outraged and shocked at her defiance at the time, but when, some time after, I re-read King John, I saw that there was something of Constance in her.  \"That may be,\" she answered, \"but when my child's interests are at stake, I cannot haggle over conventionalities and proprieties.  I am the Earl of Trevorsham's only legitimate daughter, and I claim my right to remain in his house, and to take charge of my infant brother.\"  A sign from Fulk stopped me, as I was going to scream at this.  \"Remember,\" he said, \"your identity has yet to be proved.\"  \"Your brother there must needs witness.  He has done so.\"  \"What do you witness to, Bertram?\" asked Fulk.  \"I do not know; I cannot understand,\" said Bertram.  \"I saw this person in a farm in Lower Canada, and there was an old lady who seemed to have known my father, and was very much amazed to find he was not killed in 1814.  I did not hear her name, nor know whose mother she was, nor anything about her, nor what this dreadful business means.\"  \"At any rate,\" said Fulk to her, \"your claim to remain in the house must depend on the legal proof of the fact.  My father's first marriage is undoubted, but absolute legal certainty that you are the child of that marriage alone can entitle you to take rank as his daughter; and, therefore, I am not compelled to admit your claim to remain here, though if you will refrain from renewing this discussion till after the funeral, I will not ask you to leave the house.\"  \"I do not recognize your right to ask or not to ask,\" she said, undauntedly.  \"I am either Lord Trevorsham's rightful heir--and it is not yet shown that I am not--or else I am the guardian he appointed for his son.  I know this to be so, and Mr. Eagles, who will soon be here, will show it to you in the will if you wish it.  Therefore, until the decision is made, when, if it goes against me, the child will no doubt be made a ward in Chancery, I am the person responsible for him and his property.\"  \"I have no doubt you will take advantage of me and of every quibble against me;\" and there at last she began to break down; \"but if there is justice in heaven or earth my child shall have it, though you and all were leagued against him.\"  And there she began to sob.  And those brothers of mine, they actually grew compassionate; they ran after wine; they called us to bring salts, and help her.  Emily shuddered, and put her hands behind her;"]]]
