It had played its part with distinction in the grim struggles around St. Eloi and Hooge.  When, therefore, it was selected by Sir Julian Byng the G.O.C. the Canadian Corps, for the great thrust against Courcelette, the General felt that he was employing a weapon of tried keenness and temper which could be depended upon neither to turn nor to break in his hand.  The result, as will be seen, more than amply justified his confidence.  [Illustration: Map--COURCELETTE Sept. 15th to Oct. 3rd (incl.) 1916]  The capture of Courcelette, it must be borne in mind, was not an isolated operation.  It was an enterprise carried out by the Canadian Corps in conjunction with an attack by our Fourth Army, and by the French Army operating on our right, south of the Somme.  The battle was fought in two distinct actions, one in the early morning by the 4th and 6th Brigades, the other in the late afternoon and evening by the 5th Brigade.  The first, properly speaking, was the action planned for the day, its objective being the capture of the formidable defences known as Sugar Trench and the Sugar Factory, which barred the way to Courcelette itself.  It was, indeed, an ample undertaking for one day; but the success of the attack was so swift and overwhelming, and our troops so straining on the leash, that it was decided to thrust on again at once for the greater prize without giving the dishevelled adversary time to recover.  The second, and major, portion of the operation, therefore, may be regarded as an improvisation on the battlefield.  At 3.30 in the afternoon the order came for the 5th Brigade, which had been held in reserve during the morning advance, to take Courcelette that same day.  Brief as was the notice, within two hours the new operation orders had been issued, and officers and N.C.O.'s fully instructed as to their individual duties.  At 6.15 a.m. the barrage lifted and the attacking battalions \"went over.\"  Before 7.30 p.m. the whole of Courcelette, with some 1,300 prisoners and much booty, was in our hands, and the position was being consolidated.  The second phase of the operation, though planned out with such haste, had worked no less smoothly and according to schedule than the first, and had resulted in a success no less decisive.  All through the night, and for several days thereafter, the Germans strove, by furious shelling and desperate counter-attacks, to regain the stronghold from which they had been so precipitately expelled.  But our troops proved no less dogged in holding on than they had been dashing in attack, and all the enemy's efforts to retrieve his loss resulted only in further loss of ground and further punishment.  An added interest attaches to the action against Courcelette from the fact that in this engagement appeared for the first time those amazing engines of war known as the \"Tanks.\"  The cold official designation of these monsters is simply \"Heavy Machine-Gun Battery.\"  But Tommy Atkins, with his fine sense of the fitness of things and his gift for apt nomenclature, could not possibly leave this most daringly original offspring of our military inventiveness to labour under so commonplace a designation.  He took this uncouth but invincible ally to his heart at once, and in humorous appreciation christened it a \"Tank.\"  And a Tank the amazing creation will remain, except for the purpose of some formal official documents.  How effectively the Tanks played their novel _rôle_ in the fight for Courcelette will appear in succeeding chapters in course of the detailed account of the individual units involved.  Suffice it to say here that the high opinion formed on this, their first appearance, as to the fighting value of this new engine of attack has been more than justified by its later performances, which have confounded the jeers of the pessimist and the sceptic.     CHAPTER IV  THE SUGAR FACTORY AND COURCELETTE  When the Canadians came up to join the struggle on the Somme, they arrived under happy auspices.  There was a sense of victory in the air. This is not less true literally than as a figure of speech; for on every hand the clear sky of early autumn in Picardy was dotted by our stationary observation balloons, and threaded by our darting 'planes, which scouted confidently far over the enemy lines or methodically registered for the massed ranks of our guns.  Just at this period the supremacy of our Air Service was hardly ever disputed.  The German 'planes rarely explored beyond our lines, and the German \"sausages\" seldom ventured aloft, having learned that such a venture was equivalent to speedy suicide.  Moreover, here on the Somme Front our Battalions realised at once that, upon whatsoever hard undertaking they might be launched, they would have the support of an overmastering weight of artillery.  Shell-fire, however murderous, loses half its effect upon the men's spirit when they feel that what they are enduring is mild compared to the avalanche of destruction which their own batteries, close behind them, are at the same moment letting loose upon the enemy.  Altogether it was a tonic change for our Battalions, after their long gruelling in \"the Salient,\" where at times they had felt themselves in much the position of the toad under the harrow, ground down into the Flanders mire by bombardments from three sides at once, and ceaselessly overlooked by an adversary holding superior positions. Here at last they marched up into the fight over ground wrenched from the enemy in spite of his most deliberate and desperate efforts to hold on to it.  Here they felt that they would have a chance to \"get a bit of their own back\"--and, as the event will show, they got it, full measure and running over.  The terrain over which the attack was to be made is a gently undulating expanse of farm lands stripped naked by the incessant storm of shell-fire and closely pitted with shell-holes and craters.  Of grass or herbage not a blade remained, of trees but here and there a bald and riven stump.  Dividing this unspeakable waste runs the straight highway from Albert to Bapaume, thick strung with ruined, or rather obliterated, villages.  Of these the most advanced in our possession was Pozières, with the great road running directly through it.  A mile and a half further on the road runs midway between the twin villages of Courcelette (on the left) and Martinpuich (on the right), which lie about three-quarters of a mile apart.  A little nearer our line, and flush with the left of the road--just about a mile from the eastern limit of Pozières--stood a mass of partly demolished brick buildings which had been a great sugar factory, and now, heavily entrenched and fortified by all the arts of the German engineers, constituted the most formidable outpost of Courcelette as well as an important flank defence to the position of Martinpuich.  From the western extremity of Martinpuich a strong trench known as Candy Trench ran north-west to the Bapaume Road, skirted the west side of the Sugar Factory, continued in the same direction for a couple of hundred yards past that stronghold, and joined, at right angles, another deeply entrenched and strongly held line called Sugar Trench, which ran south-west for a distance of about twelve hundred yards and ended at McDonnell Road, a second-class thoroughfare almost parallel to the Bapaume highway.  It was these two great trenches, each nearly three-quarters of a mile in length, forming two sides of a triangle with the Sugar Factory Fort in the apex, which constituted the grand obstacle to any advance on Courcelette itself. It was an obstacle of the first order, lavishly supported by bombing and machine-gun posts, its flanks fully guarded by trench-works outside of Martinpuich and along McDonnell Road.  Such and so formidable was the objective which the 2nd Division set itself out to gain on that memorable morning of the 15th.  The troops detailed for the attack were the 4th and 6th Brigades, the 5th being held in reserve.  The position from which the attack was ordered to start was a line of trench covering the front of Pozières, and something under half a mile in advance of the edge of the village. This line, roughly speaking about a mile in extent, ran south-west and north-west across the Bapaume Road, which divided it at right angles into two almost equal sectors, the major sector being that to the north or left of the road.  The extreme left of the line rested on McDonnell Road, and joined up at that point with the 3rd Canadian Division.  The right connected with the 15th British Division, which lay facing Martinpuich and kept the enemy force there fully occupied.  The sector to the right of the Bapaume Road was in the hands of the 4th Brigade, under Brigadier-General R. Rennie, M.V.O., D.S.O., while the left sector was allotted to the 6th, under Brigadier-General H. D. B. Ketchen, C.M.G.  The attacking line of the 4th Brigade was made up as follows:--On the right the 18th Battalion (Western Ontario), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Milligan; centre, the 20th Battalion (Northern and Central Ontario), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel C. H. Rogers; and on the left the 21st Battalion (Eastern Ontario), under Lieutenant-Colonel Elmer Jones.  In Brigade Reserve was the 24th Battalion (Victoria Rifles of Canada), under Lieutenant-Colonel J. H. Gunn.  The attacking line of the 6th Brigade consisted of the 27th Battalion (City of Winnipeg), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel P. J. Daly, D.S.O.; the 28th (North-West), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel J. F. Embury, C.M.G.; and the 31st (Alberta), under Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Bell, with the 29th (Vancouver), familiarly known as Tobin's Tigers, under Lieutenant-Colonel J. S. Tait, in Brigade Reserve.  The field guns covering the attack consisted of the 1st Brigade of the 1st Canadian Divisional Artillery and four"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46116"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume III (#7)"],["body","of the 18th Divisional Artillery, under Brigadier-General Metcalfe, D.S.O., on the right, and on the left three Brigades of the 1st Canadian Divisional Artillery and one Brigade of the Lahore Artillery, under the command of Brigadier-General Thacker.  The barrage work of both these groups throughout the attack was of a closeness and accuracy which left nothing to be desired.  It covered both the advance and the consolidation so effectually that our casualty list, though serious, was much smaller than the difficulties of the operation and the strength of the forces opposed to us had permitted us to hope.  The artillery preparation for the attack was begun, by the heavy guns and howitzers, at 1 o'clock in the afternoon of September 14th.  From that hour until 3 o'clock in the morning of the 15th the enemy's position was subjected to a deluge of high explosive.  At 3 o'clock this fire diminished in intensity.  At 4 o'clock it ceased abruptly.  A sudden calm fell upon the opposing lines--a calm as full of menace in its sinister suggestiveness, like the core of silence at the heart of the cyclone, as the devouring roar of the bombardment.  At the highest pitch of expectation our Battalions waited for the fateful hour of \"zero time\" creeping up with the dawn.  During this slow hour of waiting, always so stern a test to the nerve of the most seasoned troops, \"occurred an incident which\"--to quote from Major F. Davy's spirited and picturesque account of the battle--\"had it not been promptly met by the vigour and resolution of the Canadians, might have marred, perhaps prevented, the whole attack. A determined attack by a strong enemy bombing party was made upon the right sector of the 4th Brigade front.  A portion of the attacking party had actually reached our trenches at the time the attack started. It was overcome by vigorous bombing and rifle fire.  A bombing officer in the disputed section, Lieutenant Hugh H. Sykes, 18th Battalion, promptly organised his defence and effectually maintained his position. Lieutenant Gidley, of the 19th Battalion, and parties of bombers from that unit and the 20th Battalion also took part, and frustrated what might have developed into a formidable attack had the initial attempt been successful.  The enemy's preparations for this attack eventually told against him, for the strong force he placed in his front trenches to exploit any initial success suffered heavily as our barrage came down upon it.\"  At dawn of the 15th the air was dry, crisp, and clear--the bite of autumn in it.  Patches of pale sky glimmered abundantly between driven fleeces of cloud with promise of fine fighting weather--high visibility, and no baffling obstruction to the work of our airmen.  The ground, tossed and furrowed though it was in every direction by the demoniacal ploughshares of the high explosive, gave firm footing--for the curse of the Somme mud had not yet fallen upon our operations.  It was such an autumn morning indeed, as to turn men's hearts, with a homesick pang, to the remembrance that this was the date when the hunting season would open in far Canadian woods and swales and coverts. But it was other hunting that opened this day for Canadians on the Bapaume Road--the hunting of the dragon-spawn of treachery and rape.  \"Zero hour\" had been set for 6.20.  At last it came.  On the minute--nay, on the second, so exact is now the synchronising of all watches for this work--with a wide-flung, sky-splitting roar our barrage-fire opened.  At the same instant all along our front appeared the round, basin-like helmets of the men of our first wave as they climbed over the parapets of the \"jumping-off\" trenches.  Their appearance in itself marked an appreciable gain of ground already secured, for these jumping-off trenches had been dug, with infinite toil and secrecy and at heavy risk, at a distance of 100 to 150 yards in advance of our established front-line trench, by so much shortening the perilous path across the open to our objectives.  This arduous and valuable work had been carried out by the 19th Battalion (Toronto and Hamilton) on the right, and by the 29th (Vancouver) on the left.  At four minutes past zero time the barrage lifted to a line about 100 yards farther on, and in another minute our first waves (the attack was ordered in four waves) was in possession of the first of the German trenches.  This trench, which ran (as will be seen by the map) close along our whole attacking front, was not very strongly held, and the resistance offered by its defenders was no more than enough to warm our men up for what was to follow.  From this point it is necessary to trace the progress of the battle Brigade by Brigade rather than as a whole, for the problems confronting the 4th Brigade, on the right (as will be seen from the map), were different from those which the 6th Brigade, on the left, had to deal with.  Suffice it to say here, by way of clamping the two sections of the movement together, that by 8 o'clock both Brigades were receiving the congratulations of the Divisional Commander, General Turner, upon their swift success.  By 8.30 the last of our objectives was completely in our hands and being consolidated, while the enemy, dazed by the swiftness of their overthrow and demoralised to the point of panic by the implacable onslaught of the Tanks, had fled behind the inner defences of Courcelette.  The way into the stronghold lay wide open.  The waves of an attack, under the latest conditions of warfare, go forward not in one long sweep, but in a succession of short advances strictly regulated by the successive steps of the barrage fire.  Each time the barrage lifts forward--which it does according to a scheme previously worked out to the minute and the yard--the attacking lines must instantly move up behind it, as close as possible to the shelter of the appalling curtain of flame and death which it lets down before them.  The progress of the wave being thus so strictly scheduled, it must often leave small enemy posts in its rear, or dug-outs sheltering furtive bands of machine-gunners.  To deal with these \"remainders\"--which might easily become a serious menace, or even bring about complete disaster--behind the waves come the \"mopping-up\" parties, whose job it is to ferret out the hidden posts, clear the dug-outs, and gather in prisoners.  The advance of the 4th Brigade on all its fronts, and in spite of desperate opposition, was so rapid and irresistible that it left behind plenty of work for its mopping-up parties.  Within fifteen minutes of going over the Brigade was in possession of another line of German trench, from three to four hundred yards behind the first line, running south-east from the Bapaume Road towards the Martinpuich Road.  In the deep bays of this trench the contention was bitter and severe, and here occurred one of those instances of treachery for which the German has shown such peculiar aptitude.  A party of the enemy threw up their hands, with, the customary cry of \"Kamerad!  Kamerad!\" and surrendered to a company of the 18th Battalion, under the command of Captain S. Loghrin.  As Captain Loghrin was accepting their surrender one of the party threw a bomb at him and blew him to pieces.  The Captain's followers flung themselves forward in a fury, and not one German in that sector of the trench escaped the steel.  Throughout the advance the three assaulting Battalions of the Brigade, in spite of varying obstacles, succeeded in maintaining an even frontage.  When the 18th, on the right, and the 20th, in the centre, fighting their way forward through the storm of shell and shrapnel and the deadly sleet of the machine-guns, had reached and taken Candy Trench, the final objective set them, it was still scarcely more than 7 o'clock.  Three or four minutes in advance of them the 21st Battalion on the left, had reached the Sugar Factory and gained a footing there.  The Factory, though a redoubtable stronghold, had already been badly knocked about by our big guns.  Now, within a very few minutes, it was surrounded on three sides by our exultant troops, who were not to be denied.  After a mad half-hour of hand-to-hand struggle in a hell of grenade and machine-gun fire, from the dreadful turmoil of grunting, cursing, and shouting, the blood and the sweat of savage bodily combat, victory suddenly emerged, and the heap of ruins remained securely in our hands--along with 125 prisoners, of whom 10 were officers. One of the companies which distinguished themselves in this Homeric bout--\"B\" Company of the 21st Battalion--was commanded and most efficiently handled throughout the crisis of the affair by its senior non-commissioned officer, Sergeant-Major Dear, every one of its officers having fallen during its hard-fought advance along the Bapaume Road.  The unexpectedly swift collapse of this stronghold of the Sugar Factory--which the enemy had thought to make impregnable--was hastened, no doubt, by the intervention of one of the \"Tanks.\"  This monster, apparently eyeless, its carapace a daub of uncouth colours, squat and portentous as one of those colossal saurians which we picture emerging from the Eocene slime, had wallowed its slow, irresistible way up over the trenches and shell-holes, belching fire from its sides and its dreadful, blind, blunt snout. Bullets and shrapnel fell harmlessly as snowflakes upon its impervious shell.  Bombs exploded thickly upon it, and, though wrapping it in flame, did no more than deface the fantastic patterns of its paint. Its path, wherever it moved, was spread with panic. In the teeth of the most concentrated fire it waddled deliberately up to the barriers of the Sugar Factory, trod them down without haste or effort, and exterminated a defending machine-gun with its crew. Then, crashing ponderously through or over every kind of obstacle, made a slow circuit of the Factory, halting stolidly here and there to blot out a troublesome nest of machine-gunners"]]]
