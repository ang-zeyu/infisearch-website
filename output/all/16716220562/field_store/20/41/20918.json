THE INTERIOR OF HUNDING'S DWELLING     ACT II. A WILD ROCKY MOUNTAIN     ACT III. ON THE TOP OF A ROCKY MOUNTAIN                        (BRÜNNHILDE'S ROCK)     THE FIRST ACT   _The interior of a dwelling-place built of wood, with the stem of a mighty ash-tree as its centre; to the right, in the foreground, is the hearth, and behind this the store-room. At the back is the large entrance door; to the left, far back, steps lead up to an inner chamber; on the same side, nearer the front, stands a table with a broad bench behind it, fixed to the wall, and with stools in front. The stage remains empty for a space. Outside a storm is just subsiding. Siegmund opens the entrance door from without, and enters. With his hand on the latch he surveys the room. He seems overwhelmed with fatigue; his dress and appearance indicate that he is in flight. He shuts the door behind him when he sees nobody, walks to the hearth with the final effort of an utterly exhausted man, and throws himself down on a bearskin rug._    SIEGMUND        I rest on this hearth,       Heedless who owns it.          [_He sinks back and remains stretched out         motionless. Sieglinde enters from the inner         chamber; she thinks her husband has returned. Her         grave look changes to one of surprise when she sees         the stranger stretched out on the hearth._  SIEGLINDE [_Still at the back._        A stranger here!       He must be questioned.          [_Coming nearer._        What man came in       And lies on the hearth?          [_As Siegmund does not move, she draws nearer still         and looks at him._        Way-worn, weary       He seems and spent.       Faints he from weariness?       Can he be sick?  [_She bends over him, and listens._        He breathes still, his eyelids       Are sealed but in slumber.   Worthy, valiant his mien,   Though so worn he rests.  SIEGMUND [_Suddenly raising his head._        A drink! A drink!  SIEGLINDE        I go to fetch it.  [_She takes a drinking-horn and hurries out. She returns with it full, and offers it to Siegmund._        Lo, the water       Thy thirsting lips longed for:   Water brought at thy wish!          [_Siegmund drinks, and hands her back the horn.         As he signifies his thanks with a movement of the         head, he gazes at her with growing interest._  SIEGMUND        Welcome the water!       Quenched is my thirst.       My weary load       Lighter it makes;       New courage it gives;       Mine eyes that slept   Re-open glad on the world.   Who soothes and comforts me so?  SIEGLINDE        This house and this wife       Belong to Hunding.   Stay thou here as his guest;   Tarry till he comes home.  SIEGMUND        Shelter he surely       Will grant a worn,   Wounded, weaponless stranger.  SIEGLINDE [_With anxious haste._  Quick, show me! Where are thy wounds?  SIEGMUND          [_Shakes himself and springs up briskly to a         sitting posture._        My wounds are slight,       Scarce worthy remark;       My limbs are well knit still,       Whole and unharmed.   If my spear and shield had but been   Half so strong as my arm is,   I had vanquished the foe;   But in splinters were spear and shield.       The horde of foemen       Harassed me sore;       Through storm and strife       Spent was my force;   But, faster than I from foemen,   All my faintness has fled;   Darkness fell deep on my lids,   But now the sun again laughs.  SIEGLINDE          [_Goes to the storeroom, fills a horn with         mead, and proffers it to Siegmund with friendly         eagerness._        This healing and honeyed       Draught of mead   Deign to accept from me.  SIEGMUND    Set it first to thy lips.          [_Sieglinde sips from the horn and hands it back         to him. Siegmund takes a long draught, regarding         Sieglinde with increasing warmth. Still gazing,         he takes the horn from his lips and lets it sink         slowly, while his features express strong emotion.         He sighs deeply, and lowers his gaze gloomily to         the ground._  SIEGMUND [_In a trembling voice._    Thou hast tended an ill-fated one!       May all evil       Be turned from thee!          [_He starts up quickly, and goes towards the the         back._        I have been solaced       By sweet repose:   Onward now I must press.  SIEGLINDE    Who pursues thee so close at thy heels?          [_Turning round quickly._  SIEGMUND [_Stops._        Bad luck pursues me,       Everywhere follows;       And where I linger       Trouble still finds me:   Be thou preserved from its touch!   I must not gaze but go.          [_He strides hastily to the door and lifts the         latch._  SIEGLINDE [_Forgetting herself calls impetuously after him._        Then tarry here!   Misfortune thou canst not bring   To those who abide with it!  [Illustration: Plate 19     SIEGLINDE         \"This healing and honeyed         Draught of mead     Deign to accept from me.\"     SIEGFRIED     \"Set it first to thy lips.\"]  SIEGMUND          [_Deeply moved, remains standing; he looks         searchingly at Sieglinde, who, ashamed and sad,         lowers her eyes. Returning, he leans against the         hearth, his gaze fixed on Sieglinde, who continues         silently embarrassed._    Wehwalt named I myself:   Hunding here will I wait for.          _Sieglinde starts, listens and hears Hunding         outside leading his horse to the stable. She         hurries to the door and opens it. Hunding, armed         with shield and spear, enters, but, perceiving         Siegmund, pauses on the threshold. Hunding turns         with a look of stern inquiry to Sieglinde._  SIEGLINDE [_In answer to Hunding's look._        On the hearth       Fainting I found   One whom need drove here.  HUNDING        Hast succoured him?  SIEGLINDE        I gave him, as a guest,   Welcome and a drink.  SIEGMUND [_Regarding Hunding firmly and calmly._        Drink she gave,       Shelter too:   Wouldst therefore chide the woman?  HUNDING        Sacred is my hearth:       Sacred hold thou my house.          [_To Sieglinde, as he takes off his armour and         hands it to her._        Set the meal for us men!          [_Sieglinde hangs up the arms on the stem of         the ash-tree, fetches food and drink from         the store-room and sets supper on the table.         Involuntarily she turns her gaze on Siegmund         again._  HUNDING          [_Examining Siegmund's features keenly and with         amaze, compares them with Sieglinde's. Aside._         How like to the woman!        In his eye as well    Gleams the guile of the serpent.          [_He conceals his surprise, and turns with apparent         unconcern to Siegmund._        Far, I trow,       Must thou have fared;       The man who rests here       Rode no horse:       What toilsome journey       Made thee so tired?  SIEGMUND        Through wood and meadow,       Thicket and moor,       Chased by the storm       And peril sore,   I ran by I know not what road.       I know as little       What goal it led to,   And I would gladly be told.  HUNDING [_At table, inviting Siegmund to be seated._        'Tis Hunding owns       The roof and room   Which have harboured thee.       If to the westward       Thou wert to wend,       In homesteads rich       Thou wouldst find kinsmen   Who guard the honour of Hunding.   May I ask of my guest   In return to tell me his name?          [_Siegmund, who has taken his seat at the table,         looks thoughtfully before him. Sieglinde, who         has placed herself beside Hunding and opposite         Siegmund, gazes at him with evident sympathy and         suspense._  [Illustration: Plate 20, Hunding discovers the likeness between Siegmund and Sieglinde.]  HUNDING [_Watching them both._        If thou wilt not       Trust it to me,   To this woman tell thy secret:   See, how eagerly she asks!  SIEGLINDE [_Unembarrassed and interested._       Gladly I'd know      Who thou art.  SIEGMUND [_Looks up and, gazing into her eyes, begins gravely._    Not for me the name Friedmund;   Frohwalt fain were I called,   But forced was I to be Wehwalt.   Wölfe they called my father;   And I am one of twins:   With a sister twin I was born.       Soon lost were       Both mother and maid;       I hardly knew       Her who gave me my life,   Nor her with whom I was born.   Warlike and strong was Wölfe,   And never wanting for foes.       A-hunting oft       Went the son with the father.       One day we returned       Outworn with the chase   And found the wolf's nest robbed.       The brave abode       To ashes was burnt,       Consumed to dust       The flourishing oak,       And dead was the mother,       Dauntless but slain.       No trace of the sister       Was ever found:   The Neidungs' heartless horde   Had dealt us this bitter blow.       My father fled,       An outlaw with me;       And the youth       Lived wild in the forest   With Wölfe for many years.   Sore beset and harried were they,   But boldly battled the pair of wolves.

The rolling hills over which the clouds hung low smoothed out as they met and merged with the flat wasteland. A row of trees, the only ones in sight, lined one edge of a rectangle even flatter and smoother than the land near by. A long, low building near the trees, with two small airplanes in front of it, identified the rectangle as an airfield.  Before the transport reached the field, another slid out of the cloud. Suddenly swift fighter planes darted past them, swept low over the airfield with machine guns splattering their bullets over the hard earth, the two small planes, and the low hangar. They circled swiftly, just as a third transport appeared from the clouds, and roared past the field, on the far side of the line of trees. Long streaks of white smoke poured from them, falling lazily and billowing into man-made clouds as dense as those in which the planes had recently been flying. In five minutes the smoke screen was a wall twenty feet thick and a hundred feet high.  Meanwhile, the first transport had circled the field, dropping lower. Suddenly a figure plunged from the side of its fuselage, hurtled toward the ground, and then checked its descent with a jerk as a white parachute billowed out above. Another figure had dropped from the plane before the first ’chute opened, and now it too floated gently to earth behind the smoke screen. In rapid succession, eighteen men leaped from the plane, which sped back toward the hills as another came in to discharge its cargo of soldiers.  As the first man landed, he rolled over the hard earth, tugging at the lines of his parachute to spill the air from it. In a moment it had collapsed and the man had slipped from his harness. Dropping his emergency ’chute, he unfolded the stock of his sub-machine gun and ran forward, crouching, toward the smoke screen, on the other side of which lay the airfield building.  “Jerry!” a voice called from behind him, and he turned.  “Okay, Dick?” the first man called back.  “Yes, sir,” replied the second, running up. “And here come the rest.”  In less than three minutes the eighteen men from the first plane had gathered near their leader, Lieutenant Jerry Scotti.  “We won’t wait for the heavies,” he said. “I think this is a setup. Come on.”  He turned and ran into the cloud of smoke, followed by the others, who held their guns ready. As they broke out of the cloud on the other side, they dropped to the ground. The hangar was not more than a hundred feet away. There was still no sign of activity in or around it. Not a man had been seen since the planes first came over.  “No cover here at all,” muttered the second man, Sergeant Dick Donnelly.  “No opposition, either,” laughed the Lieutenant. “Can’t see a soul.”  “Think they’ve skipped out?” Donnelly asked his companion.  “No—no place to skip to, except by plane,” Scotti replied. “They must be in the hangar, just waiting. The Major said we might not meet any defense at all. Most of these Frenchmen are mighty happy to have us invading North Africa.”  “Sure, but some of ’em are putting up a fight,” the sergeant said. “They’re good soldiers and if their officers tell them to fight back, they fight back.”  “Get back a bit into the protection of the smoke,” Scotti said, and his men pushed themselves back ten feet. “Now let’s give them a burst and see what happens.”  The silence, broken only by the steady drone of airplane motors in the skies overhead, was shattered by the stuttering explosions of sub-machine guns. The bullets thudded into the thick, hard clay walls of the hangar.  Suddenly three rifles and a pistol were thrust through the windows at the rear of the hangar and they fired repeatedly—_into the air_! Then a white flag was thrust from the middle window on a long pole, so quickly that it must have been ready for the purpose.  “We surrendair!” called a voice from the hangar. “Les Américains—zey have conquered us!”  “All right,” shouted Lieutenant Scotti, advancing from the smoke screen about ten feet. “Toss all guns out the window.”  “Oui, oui, at once!” came back the voice.  Half a dozen rifles, three automatics, and two light machine guns were thrust from the windows and clattered to the ground. By this time two other groups of American soldiers had appeared, one to the right and one to the left of Scotti’s group.  “It’s all over,” he called to them. “Hold your fire! They’ve surrendered.”  “My golly!” cried a voice from the group on the left. “What did we come along for—just to take a ride?”  But Lieutenant Scotti had turned his attention back to the hangar.  “Now come out that side door,” he called. “One at a time, with your hands up.”  In a moment the side door of the hangar was opened and out stepped a smiling French officer, his hands in the air. His blue uniform was as trim as his tiny mustache, and he walked erect, with dignity and military precision. Just as the other French soldiers came out behind him, three men appeared from the smoke, which now was lifting somewhat, behind Scotti’s group. Dick Donnelly turned from his officer’s side and called to them.  “Take it easy, boys.” he said with a grin. “The heavy machine guns won’t be needed—unless you want a little target practice later just to keep in trim.”  The men, who had quickly assembled a machine gun dropped by parachute from one of the planes, rushed it forward with all possible speed, stopped in their tracks, dropped their heavy burdens, and looked disappointed.  “Aren’t we _ever_ gonna get any fightin’?” grumbled the first man.  “Wasn’t that little business at Casablanca enough for you?” asked Donnelly.  “Sure, but that was three weeks ago!” was the reply.  By this time the French soldiers were lined up alongside the hangar, their hands in the air. There were two other officers, four enlisted men and four men whose overalls showed that they were mechanics.  “We have resisted,” cried the first officer happily. “Did you not see? We fired our guns in resistance against your attack as we have been commanded. But your superior numbairs overcame us. Yes?”  Lieutenant Jerry Scotti grinned and walked forward.  “Sure, I understand,” he said. “You put up a whale of a fight! Lucky nobody was hurt. You can put your hands down now.”  Scotti turned to his sergeant.  “Sergeant Donnelly, you may send up the flares signaling capitulation of the French airfield after a brief but fierce fight. The other planes can come in now.”  As Dick"]]]
