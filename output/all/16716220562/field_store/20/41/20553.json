Then was built the vast and splendid Drapers’ Guild Hall, the most remarkable secular monument of the Middle Ages.  Merchants from all over Europe had counting-houses within its territory.  The Kings of France and England and the Emperors of Germany granted special privileges to the men of Ypres who came to trade in their realms.  Then came ruinous and bloody wars against the Counts of Flanders and against the Kings of France; came civil dissensions, riots, and massacres.  After being besieged by English troops under Richard II. in 1383, the town found its suburbs destroyed, and its industrial population terribly depleted by exile.  In the following century it was visited by repeated misfortunes, and in the sixteenth it became the scene of religious persecution, massacres, and pillage.  In 1566 Ypres was sacked by a mob, and the same fate befell it in 1578.  It was used as a fortress against the Spaniards, and when it fell, after a siege of eight months, the population had dwindled to 5,000 souls, and within its walls all was in ruins.  Sieges and bombardments continued at intervals until, at the French Revolution, Ypres fell into the hands of the troops of the Convention, and once more--\"for the last time,\" says the local historian--became a victim of violence and destruction.  Alas, not the last!  Briefly, that is the tale of Ypres, relentlessly pursued by misfortune. And yet, despite all the city has endured, it fronted the world bravely and even with an imposing aspect, repairing the ravages of war with patience and fortitude.  This time is it possible that this noble city should rise again?  Its pride--the glorious Guild Hall--the mediæval churches and mansions are all but level with the ground. There is scarce a single house in the city whose walls are undamaged, and most of them are mere heaps of bricks and mortar.  I have just made a tour of the streets, accompanied by a young Canadian engineer. It is a desert whose silence is only broken by the thunder of guns, for the Germans are bombarding again.  Occasionally a 4.5 shell crashes perilously near, or a shrapnel explodes over our heads, and instinctively we dart into cover.  But for these reminders of a savage and felon present we might be walking in a city buried like Pompeii or Herculaneum, and now exhumed to display to curious eyes the crumbling memorials of a remote and peaceful past.  My companion reminds me, as we pass the convent of the Irish Nuns of Ypres, that the Princess Patricia’s carried their colours through Ypres, and that while they halted here one of their officers quoted some lines of the famous ballad:      In the cloisters of Ypres a banner is swaying,     And by it a pale, weeping maiden is praying.  There have been, in dreams, many pale, weeping maidens praying beside that banner wrought by the royal Princess Patricia.  God grant soon that the prayers of all women be heard!                                   *APPENDIX.*                                      I.  Hooghe.--The Baron Gaston de Vinck, Belgian ex-Senator and Burgomaster of Zillebeke, writes me that the name and proper orthography is the Chateau de la Hooghe. \"All has been blown up by dynamite and burnt.  My fine collection of antiquities of great value, my furniture, pictures, and family portraits, all have perished.  The chateau was built in 1721: my family acquired the estate in 1740, and since then six generations have dwelt there.  I know with what martial glory on my old and beloved lands your compatriots have covered themselves.  Of this, I and those who shall come after me, will keep an imperishable memory.\"                                      II.  GENERAL MERCER’S DEATH.--Lieutenant Gooderham, the General’s aide-de-camp, now a prisoner in Germany, writes: \"I was beside my beloved general when he was killed.  He lay on the battlefield for two days, suffering from shell shock, until picked up by a German patrol. He was first shocked by large shell, and I tried to get him away, but it was impossible.  He was shot through the leg, which was broken.  He lay on the field, in no pain, and next day was killed by shrapnel instantly.\"  The General’s body was found in the Armagh Wood and buried in a military cemetery near Poperinghe, Sir Julian Byng and a large number of officers attending the funeral.

Daily hundreds of pilots are flying in Europe, in Africa, in Asia Minor; flying, fighting, and dying in a medium through which, ten years ago, it was considered impossible to travel.  But though the air has been mastered, the science of aero-dynamics is still in its infancy, and theory and practice are unproved so often that even the best aviators experience difficulty in keeping abreast of the times.  My experience in the French Aviation Service early taught me what a difficult and scientific task it is to pilot an aeroplane.  By piloting I mean flying understandingly, skilfully; not merely riding in a machine after a few weeks’ training in the hope that a safe landing may be made. In America many aviators holding pilot’s licenses are in reality only conductors.  Some pilots have received their brevets in the brief period of six weeks. I can only say that I feel sorry for them. My own training in France opened my eyes.  It showed me how exhaustive is the method adopted by the belligerents of Europe for making experienced aviators out of raw recruits.  Time and experience are the two factors essential in the training of the military pilot.  Even in France, where the Aviation Service is constantly working under the forced draught of war conditions, no less than from four to six months are devoted to the training of finished pilots.  Although I have just come from France, the progress of aviation is so rapid that much of my own knowledge may be out of date before I again return to the front. But interest in flying is becoming so general among Americans that the way the aviators of France are trained, and what they are accomplishing, should attract more than passing attention.  Surely, what France has done, and is doing, should be an object-lesson to our own government.  Through a special channel only recently open to Americans I enlisted in the French Air Service.  As is usual in governmental matters, there were many formalities to be complied with, but in my case a friendly official in the Foreign Office came to the rescue and arranged them for me. After a few days I received the necessary permit to report for duty. Without delay I hurried to the recruiting office, which is located in the Invalides, that wonderfully inspiring monument of martial France. As I entered the bureau I met a crowd of men who had been declared unfit for the front, either on account of their health, or because they had been too seriously wounded.  But to a man they were anxious to serve \"la patrie,\" and were seeking to be re-examined for any service in which physical requirements were not so stringent.  For an \"embusqué\" (a shirker) is looked upon as pariah in France.  When I had signed a contract to \"obey the military laws of France and be governed and punished thereby,\" I received permission to join the French Air Service. With about thirty other men I marched to the doctor’s office, where I was put through the eye, lung, and heart test. I was then ordered to report to the sergeant who had charge of the men who had passed the examination.  Among those accepted I noticed a young man of the working class.  He had been particularly nervous while the roll was called.  But the moment he heard his own name he seemed overjoyed.  Outside, on the sidewalk, his wife was waiting. He dashed out to tell her the news. Instead of bursting into tears, as I had rather expected, she seized his hands and they danced down the street as joyfully as two children.  It was typical of the spirit of the French women, willing to sacrifice everything, to help bring victory to their country.  I received my service-order to proceed immediately to Dijon, the headquarters of the Flying Corps.  I took the first train and arrived there at about three in the morning.  I discovered that the offices did not open until seven, and, as I had nothing to do and was hungry, I sought the military buffet at the railway-station. It was filled with men on leave and others who had been discharged from the hospitals, all waiting to return to the front. Officers and men mingled in a spirit of democracy and \"camaraderie.\"  This made a deep impression upon me, for, while discipline in the French army is very strict, there is an entire absence of that snobbishness which the average civilian so often associates with a military organization.  [Illustration: A Voisin bombarding-machine. A Nieuport \"avion de Chasse.\"]  About seven o’clock I made my way to the camp.  A sentry challenged me, but after I had proved my identity he sent me to the adjutant, who took my papers and, after reading them, addressed me in perfect English.  I was surprised and asked him how he happened to speak English so well. It seems that he had lived in New York for twelve years, but on the outbreak of the war had returned at once to serve.  I was then given in charge of a corporal. After this I was put through another \"questionnaire.\"  One officer asked for my pedigree; to another I gave the name and address of my nearest relative, to be notified in the event of my death.  After this came the \"vestiaire.\"  Each \"dépôt,\" or headquarters, has one of these, where every soldier is completely outfitted by the government.  I received a uniform, two pairs of shoes, two pairs of socks, an overcoat, two suits of underwear, two hats, a knapsack, and a tin cup, bowl, and spoon.  The recruit may buy his own outfit if he wishes, but the government offers it to him gratis if he is not too particular.  I was now a full-fledged French soldier of the second class, second because there was no third.  My satisfaction was only exceeded by my embarrassment.  I felt very self-conscious in my uniform, but, as a matter of fact, I was less conspicuous in this garb than I was before I gave up my civilian clothing.  The adjutant now gave me three cents, my first three days’ pay as a soldier, and warned me \"not to spend it all in one place.\"  Aviators receive extra pay, but I was still only a simple \"poilu.\"  He then handed me a formal order to study aviation—to be an \"élève pilote,\" as they say in France—and also a pass to proceed to Pau.  My time was now my own, so I decided to take a look around the hangars, and before long two \"élèves pilotes\" greeted me and inquired whether I was entering the Aviation Corps.  When they heard that I was, and that I was an American they told me that they also, and several of their friends to whom they afterward introduced me, had lived for some time in the United States.  With all this welcome I became conscious of the understood but inexplicable freemasonry that binds all aviators together.  I was greeted everywhere as a comrade and shown everything. I was amazed at the vastness of it all and at the scale of the organization.  In one corner of the establishment they were teaching mechanics how to repair motors, in another how to regulate aeroplanes. Beyond were classes for chauffeurs, and countless other courses.  There must have been several thousand men, and all of them were merely learning to serve the national heroes, the \"aviateurs.\"  In the evening we all went to Dijon together.  We dined and went to the theatre. The theatre was full of soldiers, and every little while the provost marshal’s guard, composed of gendarmes, would enter and make an arrest.  Any one who does not produce papers explaining his absence from the army is hustled off immediately.  There are very few Frenchmen who attempt to dodge their service, but this system of supervision has been found necessary to keep down their number and to discover any German spies who may be about.  After the play I went to the station. The road was clogged with troop-trains carrying reinforcements to the Near-Eastern front.  During the four hours I spent in the station twelve trains of British artillery passed by.  The entente between the Tommies and the "]]]
