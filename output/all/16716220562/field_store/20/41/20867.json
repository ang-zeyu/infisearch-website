The mechanic grinned as he held up a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher.  “That’s one more thing,” Sparky warned. “Don’t ever start twin motors unless someone is near with the fire bottle. And don’t you let me do it!”  “Is that so bad?” Mary asked.  “Worst in the world,” Sparky exploded. “If one motor fails to start popping, you’ll have a fire in your exhaust pipe.... A fire bottle will put it out in a hurry. But if there’s no fire bottle your ship will go up in smoke. A fire of high octane gas is something to think about!”  He started the energizing wheel going, waited a space of seconds, then threw on the fuel-booster switch. First the right engine began coughing. Mary worked her two levers that enriched the fuel mixture. Sparky eased his throttle back to one thousand, then nodded to the mechanic. The mechanic removed the chocks from before the wheels, and the big ship started to move.  “We’re off!” Mary thought with a little choking sensation at her throat.  Sparky cursed some small, foreign plane that, taxiing across the field, caused him to swing sharply to the right.  “Looks like he did that on purpose,” said Mary.  “May have, at that,” was the reply. “There are some Hitler sympathizers down this way.  “Well,” he sighed ten seconds later. “I fooled him. Now the runway’s clear, so here we go.” The powerful motors roared in unison. They rose sharply toward the stars. Ten minutes later they were out over the blue-black sea and still slowly climbing.  “The sea is so black,” Mary thought. “The sky is all filled with night. Hours of this! How can I bear it?”  Then, as a sense of real joy, the feeling that must come to a night-flying bird, passed over her, she whispered, “But we’re rushing east to meet the dawn.”  “Get on your oxygen mask,” Sparky commanded, crashing into her dream. “We’re going up where there isn’t any weather and mighty little air.”  Their masks were attached by rubber tubes to pipes running from the oxygen storage tanks. When Mary had pulled on her mask she sighed, “Ah! That’s great! Isn’t it wonderful that they should mould our masks to fit our faces!”  “It’s a grand idea,” Sparky agreed, “but you’ll get tired enough of it before we greet that dawn of yours. We’re going up to twenty thousand feet and stay there for hours. We’ll make better time that way and there’ll be no bumps. You can even sleep if you want to.”  “Sleep!” Mary’s voice rose. “I’d never do that. Suppose you fell asleep, or—or something happened to you!”  “I never get sleepy and nothing ever happens.” Sparky settled back in his place. “Talk when you feel like it,” he drawled. “I like the sound of your voice.”  “Oh, you do,” Mary laughed.  They climbed to twenty thousand feet. It seemed to Mary that she could feel the intense cold creeping through their cabin’s walls and her four-inch-thick suit of wool, leather and fur. But this, she knew, was pure imagination.  As they zoomed along through the blue with the black ocean far below and the stars apparently scattered all about them, she felt very little desire to talk. She just wanted to think.  Her mind went back to childhood days. Happy days they had been, those days with her father. School shut out much of this. And then had come college. College vacations found her flying, first with her father, then alone. She had learned about airplane engines from the ground up and had even become an expert with a machine gun.  “That,” she told herself, “was Providence, a dress rehearsal for war.”  As if he had been reading her thoughts, Sparky said, “Mary, there were a dozen or more who volunteered for this job you’re doing now. I wouldn’t want you to think I don’t like your work. I do. You’re swell, but how come they picked on you? You’re about the youngest of the lot.”  “That’s right,” Mary agreed, “but I’ve had more hours of solo flight than any of them. Fifteen hundred, to be exact.”  “Fifteen hundred?” Sparky whistled. “Practically flew from your cradle!”  “Nope—started when I was sixteen. You see, Dad is as much at home in the air as on the ground.”  “And you take after him?”  “Sure. Why not? What’s more, I know a lot about airplane engines and machine guns.”  “Handy man with tools, eh?” Sparky drawled.  “Try me.” Mary did not laugh. “Who knows? This job of ours may call for all the tricks we know before it’s done.”  “Guess that’s right,” Sparky agreed. “And I sure am glad you’re on the job.”  After that they once more lapsed into silence. The miles and the stars flew by. There were times when Mary was plagued by the illusion that somehow their ship had stopped traveling, that they were there, suspended in space, their motors roaring, but taking them nowhere. At such times she felt an all but over-powering desire to scream, for her overwrought imagination was telling her that the motors would roar on until the fuel was gone, then they would crash into the sea.  At times she felt drowsy, at others she was so wide awake that she wanted to leave her seat for a walk. This she knew was not entirely impossible since a bottle of oxygen attached to her tube and slung over her shoulder would give her freedom of movement. But this would call for more exertion than she felt like, and she lapsed back into sleepiness.  Then, little by little, she found herself drifting into a light and hilarious mood. She wanted to sing. She did hum little snatches of funny songs she knew. “The Bear Went Over The Mountain,” “The Old Gray Mare, She Ain’t What She Used To Be,” and “Clementine.”  From time to time Sparky looked at her and growled into his mask.  “Oh, Sparky,” she cried at last, “I’m tired of this mask. Can’t I take it off?”  She meant this only as a joke but Sparky roared, “For heaven’s sake! No! You wouldn’t last half a moment.”  Nothing daunted, she told him a rather long, funny story.  “Is that supposed to be a joke?” he growled. “If so, where’s the point?”  She began to realize that something was wrong.  “Either Sparky has turned into a terrible crab or I’m plain crazy,” she told herself half in despair.  From hilarity she went into gloomy foreboding. Then, of a sudden, she sprang out of both. She knew what had happened. Both she and Sparky were drunk on oxygen. They had been up high too long. They should drop to lower levels at once. But how was she ever to make Sparky see this? In the morose mood of a partially intoxicated man, he would perhaps resist all her suggestions.  After a moment’s thought she believed she had the very idea. “Sparky,” she said, “I’m hungry.”  “Suck your thumb, like a bear,” he growled.  “The coffee’s hot, a whole gallon of it.”  “It’s frozen solid. I told you it would be. Know what the temperature outside is? Thirty-five below.”  “Yes, I know, but that coffee’s still hot.”  “How come?”  “That’s my secret.”  “Then keep it.”  “I’ll bet you five dollars it’s hot, yes, and the bottle of soup, too.”  “You got five dollars?”  “Sure I have.”  “All—all right, it’s a bet.”  “Sure it is. Do come on down to five thousand feet and I’ll show you.”  “Okay, here we go. But I get the five.”  They started down. Anxiously Mary watched the recording gage. Twenty thousand, fifteen thousand, ten, eight—she opened a ventilator, then another. At five thousand they leveled off. When at last the air was changed, they dragged off their masks.  “Whew!” Sparky breathed deeply. “That’s great!”  “You don’t know half of it,” said Mary.  “Where’s your hot coffee?”  “I’ll get it.” She did. When the cork was removed steam rose from the bottle.  “Well, I’ll be!” Sparky exclaimed. “You win! How do you do it?”  “Little electric heat, that’s all.” She pointed at the connections at the base of the thermos bottle.  “Say!” Sparky beamed. “From now on, you and I travel together.”  “At least for some little time,” she agreed with a wise smile.  It was a grand little lunch they enjoyed there above the black waters of the Atlantic. Mary flew the ship while Sparky drank hot coffee and soup, and munched hot cheese sandwiches. Then he took the controls while she carried on with the lunch box.  But when it was all over and they began once more to climb, weighty problems once more bore down upon Mary’s tired brain. Would they again climb high and fly too far, then become oxygen-drunk again? She hated to ask Sparky and yet—  Thousands of weary miles lay ahead, miles where danger lurked all the way. Then, too, there was their precious cargo. Would it reach its destination safely?  “It must,” she whispered. She reached for her mask and then Sparky spoke.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER V                             THE LADY IN BLACK   “Forget the mask,” Sparky was saying. “We’ve got loads of gas. Dawn will soon be here. We’ll stay five thousand feet. Go back and get a little rest.”  Reluctantly she obeyed. Having wrapped herself in the eiderdown robe, she fell fast asleep. But not for long. She awoke with a start from a disturbing dream to find an eerie light shining down upon her.  “The ship’s on fire!” she thought tumbling out of her robe.  She sprang to a window to whisper, “We have met the dawn.”  It was true. The sun, a red disk, rolled along the horizon. The sea and the sky were all ablaze with light.  “Sparky!” she exclaimed. “It’s wonderful!”  “Is it?” he asked sleepily. “Just another sunrise. That’s all it seems to be. But look, Mary, you’ve been a peach. I suppose I should apologize for being gruff with you back there when we were way up high.”  “Oh, no!” Mary exclaimed. “Don’t ever apologize. Your friends don’t demand it, your enemies don’t deserve it. Besides I never quarrel with people when they’re drunk.” A teasing smile played about the corners of her mouth.  “Who’s been drunk?” He shot her a quick look. “You think I’m crazy? I’m not a drinking man, but if I were, I’d be plain mad if I drank before a trip like this.”  “Oh! So you weren’t drunk?” She threw back her head for a good laugh. “You were all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47793"],["title","Sparky Ames of the Ferry Command (#6)"],["body"," same.”  “What!” Sparky seemed ready to leave the controls to crown her.  “Yes, you were drunk and so was I. I was happy and you were sad. That’s how people get when they are drunk.”  “Say, are you crazy?”  “No, Sparky, I’m not.” She laughed again. “We were having an oxygen drunk. It might have been dangerous. I realized the danger just in time. Too much oxygen, too long, that’s all.”  “Too much oxygen, too long,” he repeated after her. “I’ve heard of that happening but just think of an oldtimer like me getting caught with it!”  “The bigger they are the harder they fall.” She favored him with a good laugh. “But it’s not really strange,” she added soberly. “Our trip, this far, has been a hard one. You’ve worked long hours. You were too tired to think. I was fresh. That made all the difference. And just for that, how would you like to crawl back for a few winks?”  “Don’t mind if I do.” He offered her the controls. “But promise me that if anything unusual occurs, seaplanes show up, or anything like that, you’ll call me.”  “I’ll call you,” she agreed.  Sparky’s sleep was long and peaceful. Never had Mary enjoyed herself half so much as on that morning guiding the big ship through the blue sky over a sea as dark and mysterious as death.  An hour passed, two, three hours. Sometimes she wondered in a vague sort of way about their secret cargo. Would it go through safely and would she be with the ship to its journey’s end? Just then none of these things appeared to matter much. It was good to live. That, for the moment, was enough.  There was a spring-like warmth in the air, and a faint fragrance as of flowers. They were going against a mild off-shore breeze.  Once she spotted dark dots on the ocean far below. There were twenty-four, a convoy. It must, she told herself, be an American convoy. She wanted terribly to drop down low and dip a wing in salute but, this, she knew, would never do. Some enemy sub might see that dip and know that the convoy lay beneath her. They would close in and then—  No—it would never do, so she drove straight on toward the rising sun.  At last a long, low, gray-green cloud appeared on the horizon before her. Or was it a cloud? Breathing softly she waited and watched. The long, narrow line widened. It seemed to take form. Some spots were higher, some strips greener than others. At last she whispered excitedly:  “It’s land! Land! Africa! I’ll soon be abroad. The long hop is nearing its end.” She wanted to shout for joy, to scream, but this she knew was not expected of the co-pilot of a big ship so all she said was:  “Sparky! Sparky! Wake up! We’re nearing land, and I don’t know the way to that secret airfield.”  “What—what?” Sparky groaned sleepily. “It can’t be land. I just stretched out here a minute ago.”  “Yes, I know.” Mary laughed for sheer joy. “It’s land all the same. I think I see a camel. Come and see.”  Sparky came forward rubbing his eyes. Adjusting his glasses he took a good look.  “Can’t make out your camel,” he drawled, “but that white spot off to the right is Dakar, all right. Good girl! You hit it right on the nose. Give me the controls and I’ll have you eating fried camel steak and dates before the hour is up.”  They did just that. Coming down on an airfield fringed with palms, they were given a cordial greeting by a dozen good American soldiers. To a man, they stared at Mary, then grinning, saluted.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _Soldiers Greeted Them at the Secret Airfield_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “Jeepers, boys!” one of them exclaimed. “An honest-to-goodness lady of the Ferry Command.”  “If they all come like this one, make ’em all ladies from now on,” his buddy chipped in.  “It’s nice to see you all.” Mary put on her best smile. “I only wish I could be with you for a week.”  “Make it two! Make it for the duration!” came in a chorus.  “Two hours,” was Sparky’s pronouncement. “Give our ship the once-over, will you, while we motor in for some chow?”  “Oh, sure, we’ll fix her up fine,” a big sergeant grinned. “But you’ll have to do your own searching for stowaways.”  “And be sure you look well!” the lieutenant in charge added. “I’m short-handed. Can’t spare a man.”  An army jeep appeared and they were whisked away to a small city of low, white buildings, gleaming streets, and many camels.  “My!” Mary exclaimed. “It’s hot!”  “Sure!” said Sparky. “This is Africa.”  “The scene shifts so fast I can’t keep up,” Mary said, fanning herself.  “It won’t be bad in here,” said Sparky, motioning her to enter a long, low eating place. “It’s more than half American, patronized mostly by our people. They run a sort of concession and get real food supplies from America.”  The place was all open screened windows. There was a breeze from the sea. The food was good, even to the coffee.  “Just think of taking off in two hours!” Mary exclaimed. “I’d like to make it two weeks.”  “Sure,” Sparky grinned. “Great place for a gal. Hundred American soldiers to pick from.”  “Sparky! Forget it!” She was half inclined to be angry. “What I mean is, I’d like really to see these places we visit, not go to it hop-skip-jump. It—it seems such a waste.”  “That’s right,” Sparky agreed. “After the war we’ll do it all over—take a whole year for it.”  “Will we?” she asked.  “Who knows?” He spoke slowly. “We may be dead. This is war.”  Sparky hurried through the meal, then excused himself. “Gotta see about our papers,” he explained. “Be back in 'bout half an hour. Get yourself another cup of java and wait here in the shade.”  Hardly had Sparky disappeared when a tall, distinguished-looking young woman entered. She was dressed in a striking manner, all in black, yet it was not the black of mourning for she wore much bright costume jewelry.  The place was fairly empty, a native couple in one corner and two doughboys in another.  “Do you mind?” The woman indicated the chair Sparky had left. “One sees so few women here.”  Mary did not mind. The woman, who spoke with a French accent, took a seat, then ordered cakes and sour wine.  “You are from America?” the woman suggested. Mary nodded.  “A lady soldier?” Mary shook her head.  “But your uniform?”  “In America many women wear uniforms. We like them.” Mary smiled. “I happen to be a member of the Ferry Command.”  “And you flew a big plane all the way! How wonderful! Shall there be many more of you?”  “No—I—” Mary broke off. She had been about to say, “I may be the only one. Mine is a special mission.”  “What a fool I am,” she thought.  “I came for the ride really,” she said, covering up deftly. “My father is over here somewhere.”  “Ah! You brave Americans!” the woman exclaimed. “They saved my country, France, in the last war and now—”  “Now you expect us to do it again,” Mary wanted to say. “And over here you are divided. You don’t really know what you want.”  She did not say this, nor did the woman finish, for at that moment a bright-eyed young woman in khaki entered the place and walked straight to their table to ask:  “Are you Mary Mason?”  “Yes.” Mary stood up.  “I’ve been asked to speak to you—that, that is I have a message for you.” The girl seemed embarrassed. “Perhaps—”  “No! No!” The French woman was on her feet. “I have urgent business. I was about to go. It is good to have seen you—” She bowed to Mary and was gone.  “Will you forgive me.” The girl in khaki dropped into a seat. “I just had to do it. I never saw that woman before. She may be all right. You never know. Over here half the people are for us, the other half against. You dare trust no one. You didn’t—” She hesitated.  “I didn’t tell her a thing worth knowing.” Mary smiled. “Will you have a cup of coffee?”  “Oh, sure!” The other girl’s face beamed. “Real American girls are so rare here.”  “You are a WAC?” Mary suggested.  “Yes, of course. There are very few of us here now, but there will be more and more.” Her voice dropped. “That’s the sort of things they want to know,” she confided in a whisper.  They talked, sipped coffee, and munched cakes until Sparky hurried into the place.  “All set!” he exclaimed. “Our outfit is still far ahead of us. Got to get going.”  After Mary had introduced Lucy Merriman, the WAC, they were on their way.  “I’ll be seeing you,” Mary called back. Then she added in an undertone, “I wonder.”  As she climbed into the car, she caught a glimpse of the tall French woman. She was talking to a small man with a round face.  “That’s a queer-looking pair,” said Sparky. “Lady of quality and a beggar Arab.”  “He looks like a Jap,” Mary gave the fellow a sharp look. She would know him if she saw him again. “Besides,” she added, “he can’t be quite a beggar. He’s got a camel.”  “You meet all types here,” Sparky replied absently. “It’s the strangest country you ever may hope to see. We’ve sure got to watch our step. By rights we should fly square across the desert. But with our cargo,” his voice dropped, “it’s too risky.”  “So we’ll go northeast?” Mary suggested.  “That’s right.”  “That takes us into fighting country?”  “Yes—sort of—”  The car started, returning them to the airfield.  “There’s a secret airport, on an oasis,” Sparky told Mary. “That’ll be our first stop. After that we hit Egypt and another secret spot. Egypt is safe enough. It’s those miles in between.” His brow wrinkled in a frown. “But we’ll make it.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER VI                             MYSTERIOUS MOSLEM   To Mary the next lap in their long journey will always remain a blank, but the oasis at which they arrived will stand out vividly in her memory.  The reason for the blank was quite simple, for, as soon as they were safely in the air, Sparky said:  “Mary, you look tired. I know you are tough as a hickory limb and you’ve got all kinds of grit—”  “Oh, thanks, Sparky,” she grinned. “I’m glad you’ve got"]]]
