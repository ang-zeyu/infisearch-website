From each one of our provinces came the same voice of mingled sorrow, pride and invincible determination.  The feeling found expression in the memorial services for the dead held on April 31st in Montreal, in five churches representing all religious denominations.  The flags were flown at half-mast and the troops turned out to attend the services. \"The achievements of our men,\" said the Bishop of Montreal, \"have brought Canada into a new and more honourable place in the Empire. They endured privation, they suffered greatly, and now they have paid life's greatest tribute with their lives.\"  [Sidenote: _May 2nd, 1915._]  Nor was Great Britain without her tribute.  A memorial service was held in St. Paul's on May 2nd, 1915, for the Canadians who fell at Ypres. The officiating clergy were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, the Chaplain-General to the Forces, and the Dean of St. Paul's. The ceremony took place not without propriety in the City Cathedral of St. Paul's; for though Westminster Abbey is consecrated by long tradition and the immortal tombs of great monarchs and statesmen of times almost out of remembrance, yet the shrines of Saxon, Norman, Angevin, and Tudor kings are a little remote from the dead of a far-off country with which these recumbent figures were never concerned.  But St. Paul's possesses not only the monuments of the great soldiers and sailors who laid the foundations of the Empire of to-day, but enshrines that spirit of patriotic and constrained freedom which has made the citizens of London both \"the regular army of Liberty\" and the firm supporters of all those statesmen, from Chatham to Disraeli, who have combined freedom with Empire.  Here the volunteer army of Canada committed to the Imperial cause would find that its dead might speak without constraint to those of an older time.  In this temple of a magnificent sobriety was held the funeral service of the heroes of Ypres.  In the stiff and formal tombs of their age lay the mortal remains of Wellington and Nelson, who, if there be remembrance among the shades, might well have been present to pay tribute to men whom even they would have been proud to command.  But round the walls hung a more significant witness to the fallen in the countless tablets which still hold the memories of the soldiers and sailors, now long forgotten by history, who in many a desperate battle by sea and land laid the enduring foundations of a Canada which has proved itself not unworthy of its origins.  Among these records are those of the City merchants whose purses and patriotism supplied the sinews of war to remind us that the great material resources of the Dominion are not inferior to the patriotism of its sons, and are no less a vital factor of national victory.  Here, then, were gathered the representatives of an Empire united both by pride and sorrow.  Over the vast assembly which thronged the building on that dim summer evening the half-lights scarcely illuminated the interior of the spacious dome.  As those lights grew and shot up into the gloom the massed bands opened with the \"Dead March,\" and a thrill ran through the multitude--one of those waves of emotion which only great occasions can evoke.  The Bishop of London was the preacher, nor was his eloquence wanting to the occasion.  \"It was on that tremendous day when French and British had been overpowered by poisonous gas that the manhood of Canada shone out like pure gold.  The example of these men will never die, but will remain as a perpetual inspiration to their successors.\"  Those successors were already on their way.  Within three days of the Ypres fight 1,800 reinforcements from the Canadian Training Division crossed the Channel to bring new blood to the decimated battalions in Flanders.  The Commander-in-Chief in France at once dispatched Lieut.-Col. Carrick, M.P., to ask for a further supply of new Canadian formations.  The Minister of Militia and Defence, General Sir Sam Hughes, did not wait for any request to deal with the instant need.  He called for a draft of men from the 3rd Contingent, still training in Canada, to go abroad and help refill the ranks.  The losses of the 1st Division were thus partially made good, and it was able now to inscribe on its banners the proud name of the Second Battle of Ypres.  To the military writer of the future the amazing feature of the Second Battle of Ypres will always be the courage and discipline shown by the Canadians, equal to the best to be found in the armies with which they were associated.  The greater proportion of the Anglo-French Armies were composed of Regular soldiers in the broadest sense of the term, and it has been held by most military historians as an axiom that no amount of gallantry and intelligence can make up for a lack of prolonged training and discipline.  Ordinary military writers put the case even more strongly.  They maintain in effect that the value of troops depends on the length of service and on the character of their training, and on these things alone.  This point of view ignores the other factors which go to the making of a soldier or a regiment--physique, natural boldness and resource, intelligence, and high patriotic motives; and would claim that a body composed of naturally inferior but technically better trained troops could defeat an equal number of men possessing the qualities I have mentioned, but deficient in discipline and experience. I would submit that the Second Battle of Ypres does not accord with the expert theory, but rather teaches the reverse.  The late Colonel Henderson, perhaps the best known of modern historians of war, goes so far as to countenance the suggestion that had either the North or the South in the American Civil War possessed at the start a single army corps of Regulars, the struggle would have been decided instantly in favour of its possessors instead of lasting over four years and necessitating the calling to arms of the great majority of the citizens of the United States!  Colonel Henderson states the matter more moderately in a passage I cannot forbear to quote at some length, because it embodies the best which can be said for the professional military point of view.  Speaking of American Volunteer troops, Colonel Henderson says:  \"The Volunteers had proved themselves exceedingly liable to panic. Their superior intelligence had not enabled them to master the instincts of human nature; and although they had behaved well in camp and on the march, in battle their discipline had fallen to pieces.  _It could hardly be otherwise_.  Men without ingrained habits of obedience, who have not been trained to subordinate their will to another's, cannot be expected to render implicit obedience in moments of danger and excitement; nor can they be expected, under such circumstances, to follow officers in whom they can have but little confidence.  The ideal of battle is a combined effort, directed by a trained leader.  Unless troops are thoroughly well disciplined, such effort is impossible; the leaders are ignored, and the spasmodic action of the individual is substituted for the concentrated pressure of the mass....  The Volunteers, although on many occasions they behaved with admirable courage, continually broke loose from control under the fire of the enemy.  As individuals they fought well; as organised bodies, capable of manoeuvring under fire and of combined effort, they proved to be comparatively worthless.\" (\"Stonewall Jackson,\" Vol. I., p. 49; Longmans, 1913.)  Colonel Henderson quoted in support of his view the undisciplined advance and disorganised retreat of the Federal levies at the battle of Bull Run, and the utter failure of the brave French Territorials of the Army of the Loire in 1870-71 to relieve Paris or to make any headway against the Germans when once the French Regular armies had been destroyed at Gravelotte, Metz, and Sedan.  Such views, by ignoring the real strength which underlies great national movements and supports national armies, however ill-trained, lead to that kind of miscalculation which lured Napoleon to his destruction in Spain.  They spring chiefly from a study of those periods in history when small mercenary or highly-trained bodies of troops existed side by side with a population whose civic organisation and patriotic ardour were at a low ebb.  Such conditions occurred at certain periods of mediæval history, in the Italy of the Renaissance, and during the end of the seventeenth and throughout the eighteenth centuries.  But even in those epochs we can notice the victories of the ill-organised levies inspired by Joan of Arc over the highly-trained British men-at-arms and archers, the successful resistance of Volunteer troops in Holland to the veterans of Alva, and the contest waged by the House of Orange with the levies of the United Provinces against the flower of the French Army led by Condé and Turenne.  And the system of small, trained armies, and most of the lessons derived from it, were utterly shattered by the armed development of the French Revolution. The Prussian and Austrian Armies which crossed the French frontiers in 1793 were the last word in disciplined perfection.  The Prussian Army in particular was the exact model of the instrument which, fighting against similar organisations, had made Frederick the Great.  The French Regular Army had vanished with the old régime.  In its place was nothing but a mass of ill-trained, ill-armed, ill-supplied National Volunteers, whose only strength lay in a passionate determination to drive the Invader from the soil which they had consecrated to Liberty. The field of Valmy decided the issue in favour of the Volunteers, or, more strictly, of the _levée en masse_, and it was not till the humiliation of Jena and the slackening of French enthusiasm for the Napoleonic cause had given Germany the National Movement which was ebbing from France,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46115"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume II (#4)"],["body","the military _rôles_ of the two countries became reversed.  The armies which finally drove Napoleon back across Europe to abdication and Elba would have compared unfavourably in technique with the old Prussian Regulars, but they were armed with an enthusiasm for their cause which their predecessors had utterly lacked.  The lessons of history receive a startling reinforcement from the conduct of the Australian and Canadian troops.  Both were volunteer and semi-trained troops in the strictest sense of the term--and what was true of the rank and file was, with a few distinguished exceptions, true of its officers and of its higher command.  Both forces were confronted, the one in Gallipoli and the other at Ypres, with circumstances of unprecedented difficulty and danger.  The landings in the Peninsula and the fierce fighting at Lone Pine Hill were certainly operations of an unusual character in war, and just of a kind, if Colonel Henderson's view is correct, to bring out the unsteadiness and unreliability of Volunteer troops, however brave.  The same is true of Ypres.  Here we find an attack by a new, horrible, and terrifying instrument of war, accompanied by a massed assault of the flower of the Prussian Army; the left of the position becomes a huge gap with the Canadian trenches in the air.  Communication between units becomes more and more difficult in the swaying _mêlée_ of the battle, and the senior officers are falling fast; supports for many hours there are none.  If our semi-trained troops had broken under these combined stresses, who could have blamed them?  But in the face of these almost unparalleled difficulties, the Canadians showed the world an example of courage, steadiness, and co-ordinated discipline which could not have been surpassed by that Guards Brigade which stemmed the German tide in the first great onslaught at Ypres.  The truth would appear to be that although, when other factors are equal between opposing forces, training and discipline will win, yet there resides in intense patriotism, high physical courage and endurance bred of pastimes which are akin to war, and superior personality, a force which can only be equalled by the last word in highly-trained infantry.  Sudden and unexpected emergencies, so far from breaking the nerves of great Volunteer armies, as they do those of inferior trained troops, who are confused if the drill book fails them, bring out the resources of an individuality not yet crushed by tradition.  The Volunteer adapts himself more quickly than a machine-made soldier.  [Sidenote: _April, 1915._]  But it is time to turn to the fortune of the 2nd Division, part of which was already crossing the Atlantic at the time of the Second Battle of Ypres.  The original offer of the Dominion Government had been a full division of all arms numbering 20,000.  But the patriotism of the country outran the offer of the Government, and the actual number of the first contingent was 33,000 men.  Of these, five battalions, the 6th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 17th, had been left in England when the 1st Division sailed for France to act as the nucleus of a Drafting and Training Division.  But even before the 1st Division had left for England the Dominion Government was feeling its way towards a further offer.  The day after the great review of September 7th, 1914, at Valcartier, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Borden had cabled Sir George Perley that there were 43,000 men under arms in Canada, and had requested him to sound the Colonial Office as to the dispatch of a second contingent.  In the first week of October, 1914, the offer of the 2nd Division of 20,000 men was made by the Dominion and accepted by the Imperial Government, and recruiting for it was started at once.  The 2nd Division consisted of the usual three brigades of infantry, but at the start each battalion was raised as a separate unit, for the purposes of enlistment and training.  In fact, in some cases, companies of the same battalion were raised and partly trained in separate localities.  [Sidenote: _Oct., 1914._]  The 4th Brigade was for a time under the command of Col. Denison. Illness intervened, and the high hopes of an officer with a splendid record were completely destroyed.  The brigade then passed to the command of Brigadier-General Lord Brooke.  The battalions were recruited from such well-known regiments as the Queen's Own (of Toronto), Royal Grenadiers, 21st Essex Fusiliers, 24th Kent Regiment, 28th Perth Regiment, 29th Highland Light Infantry, 7th London Fusiliers, 14th Prince of Wales' Own Rifles, 45th Victoria Regiment, the Brockville Rifles and the Governor-General's Foot Guards. Mobilisation commenced in October, 1914, and the 18th (Western Ontario Battalion) was commanded by Lieut.-Col. Wigle, the 19th (Ontario Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. MacLaren, the 20th (Northern and Central Ontario Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. Allan, and the 21st (Eastern Ontario Battalion) by Lieut.-Col. St. Pierre Hughes.  The 5th Brigade consisted of the 22nd (French Canadians), the 24th (Victoria Rifles), the 25th (Nova Scotia), and 26th (New Brunswick) Battalions.  All these regiments began their mobilisation in the latter part of October and the first week in November, 1914, but they completed it for various reasons at very different dates.  The brigade was taken over by Brigadier-General Watson, formerly commanding the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Division.  The 22nd Battalion, under Col. Gaudet, was recruited entirely from the French Canadians, and nearly all its officers and men hailed from Montreal or Quebec.  Its point of concentration was St. John's.  Some two thousand recruits offered themselves, and of these 1,100 were finally accepted or retained, the process of enlistment being completed by November 27th.  The next battalion of the brigade, the 24th (Victoria Rifles), Lieut.-Col. Gunn, was mobilised in Montreal on October 22nd, 1914, but did not complete its mobilisation until May 8th, 1915.  There appears to have been a great rush of recruits, no fewer than four thousand offering themselves.  The method here was to accept 1,800 men and continue to weed them out by a process of selection for several months until the full complement of the regiment was obtained.  A great proportion of this battalion came from Montreal, and, like the 22nd, had carried out most of its preliminary training in the middle of the winter snows.  The 25th Battalion was recruited in Nova Scotia, including a contingent from Cape Breton.  Lieut.-Col. Le Cain was in command, and Halifax was its main centre of mobilisation.  The 26th Battalion, commanded by Lieut.-Col. McAvity, was recruited in New Brunswick and mobilised in the first three weeks of November at St. John's.  The 6th Brigade, which when constituted was taken over by Brigadier-General Ketchen, was mainly raised in the West.  The 27th Battalion (City of Winnipeg) was mobilised in Winnipeg and the surrounding districts, and was almost entirely composed of local recruits.  Lieut.-Col. Snider was in command.  The next battalion, 28th (North-west), under Col. Embury, was more composite in its origin. From Regina came 12 officers and 246 men; from Moose Jaw, 6 officers and 246 men; from Saskatoon, 6 officers and 228 men; whilst smaller detachments were raised at Fort William, Port Arthur, and Prince Albert.  It reached Winnipeg on November 1st, 1,025 strong; and it was there able to take part in combined training with the 27th.  The 29th (Vancouver) Battalion was raised entirely in British Columbia and was mobilised very rapidly in the last week of October, 1914. Lieut.-Col. Tobin was in command.  The 31st (Alberta) Battalion, Lieut.-Col. Bell, was mobilised at Calgary in November, and was recruited from that town and from Edmonton, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge, and Red Deer.  The two regiments, which had joined the brigade in Winnipeg on March 1st, were somewhat handicapped in battalion training owing to the bad weather.  However, all ranks were kept hard at work at platoon and company training, and route marching was freely indulged in.  The 29th and 31st, on the other hand, found the climates of Calgary and Vancouver more fortunate, and were able to carry out battalion training to a fairly large extent.[1]  The sailing of the second Canadian contingent was less spectacular than that of the first.  The 1st Division had started from the mouth of the St. Lawrence as a single whole under the escort of warships--the most formidable Armada which had ever crossed the Atlantic.  The 2nd Division left in single ships and without the picturesque accompaniments of the first embarkation.  The units had been raised separately and were transhipped separately to their point of union and divisional concentration in England.  The voyage was accomplished in safety, and nothing except speculations on possible submarine attacks relieved the ordinary routine of the voyage. A recapitulation of the dates of arrival of the various units and of the vessels which carried them would be tedious.  It is enough to say that the transhipment was begun in April, 1915, was in the main completed by May, and that the last body arrived in August.  [Sidenote: _May to Aug., 1915._] Although some of the units did not join up till August, the division was actually constituted on May 24th, 1915, the first divisional standing orders being issued on that day by Colonel Dennison.  On the 25th Major-General Steele assumed command.  The 2nd Division was fortunate in the man who was appointed to command it.  Major-General Steele, C.B., M.V.O., had taken part in practically every event in the military history of the Dominion since he joined the 35th Regiment of Militia as an ensign at the age of sixteen during the Fenian raid of 1866.[2]  In December, 1914, he became Inspector-General for Western Canada, and organised the 6th Infantry Brigade.  In all these activities he was ably assisted by Lieut.-Col. Ketchen, whose efforts were largely responsible for "]]]
