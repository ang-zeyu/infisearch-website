When shall we get there?”  “We shall get there before very long.”  “And shall we come back to New York to-night?”  “No, it wouldn't leave us any time to stay. Besides, I feel tired and want to rest; don't you?”  “I do feel a little tired,” acknowledged Ida.  “Philadelphia!” announced the conductor, opening the car-door.  “We get out, here,” said the nurse. “Keep close to me, or you may get lost. Perhaps you had better take hold of my hand.”  “When are you coming back, Ida?” asked William Fitts, coming up to her with his basket on his arm.  “Mrs. Hardwick says we sha'n't go back till to-morrow.”  “Come, Ida,” said the nurse, sharply. “We must hurry along.”  “Good-by, William,” said Ida. “If you see Jack, just tell him you saw me.”  “Yes, I will,” was the reply.  “I wonder who that woman is with Ida,” thought the boy. “I don't like her looks much. I wonder if she's any relation of Mr. Crump. She looks about as pleasant as Aunt Rachel.”  The last-mentioned lady would hardly have felt complimented at the comparison, or the manner in which it was made.  Ida looked about her with curiosity. There was a novelty in being in a new place, since, as far back as she could remember, she had never left New York, except for a brief excursion to Hoboken; and one Fourth of July was made memorable in her recollection, by a trip to Staten Island, which she had taken with Jack, and enjoyed exceedingly.  “Is this Philadelphia?” she inquired.  “Yes;” said her companion, shortly.  “How far is it from New York?”  “I don't know; a hundred miles, more or less.”  “A hundred miles!” repeated Ida, to whom this seemed an immense distance. “Am I a hundred miles from father and mother, and Jack, and--and Aunt Rachel?”  The last name was mentioned last, and rather as an after-thought, if Ida felt it her duty to include the not very amiable spinster, who had never erred in the way of indulgence.  “Why, yes, of course you are,” said Mrs. Hardwick, in a practical, matter-of-fact tone. “Here, cross the street here. Take care or you'll get run over. Now turn down here.”  They had now entered a narrow and dirty street, with unsightly houses on either side.  “This ain't a very nice looking street,” said Ida, looking about her.  “Why isn't it?” demanded the nurse, looking displeased.  “Why, it's narrow, and the houses don't look nice.”  “What do you think of that house, there?” asked Mrs. Hardwick, pointing out a tall, brick tenement house.  “I shouldn't like to live there,” said Ida, after a brief survey.  “You shouldn't! You don't like it so well as the house you live in in New York?”  “No, not half so well.”  The nurse smiled.  “Wouldn't you like to go up and look at the house?” she asked.  “Go up and look at it!” repeated Ida, in surprise.  “Yes, I mean to go in.”  “Why, what should we do that for?”  “You see there are some poor families living there that I go to see sometimes,” said Mrs. Hardwick, who appeared to be amused at something. “You know it is our duty to visit the poor.”  “Yes, that's what mother says.”  “There's a poor man living in the third story that I've made a good many clothes for, first and last,” said the nurse, in the same peculiar tone.  “He must be very much obliged to you,” said Ida, thinking that Mrs. Hardwick was a better woman than she had supposed.  “We're going up to see him, now,” said the nurse. “Just take care of. that hole in the stairs. Here we are.”  Somewhat to Ida's surprise, her companion opened the door without the ceremony of knocking, and revealed a poor untidy room, in which a coarse, unshaven man, was sitting in his shirt-sleeves, smoking a pipe.  “Hallo!” exclaimed this individual, jumping up suddenly. “So you've got along, old woman! Is that the gal?”  Ida stared from one to the other, in unaffected amazement.    CHAPTER X. UNEXPECTED QUARTERS.    THE appearance of the man whom Mrs. Hardwick addressed so familiarly was more picturesque than pleasing. He had a large, broad face, which, not having been shaved for a week, looked like a wilderness of stubble. His nose indicated habitual indulgence in alcoholic beverages. His eyes, likewise, were bloodshot, and his skin looked coarse and blotched; his coat was thrown aside, displaying a shirt which bore evidence of having been useful in its day and generation. The same remark may apply to his nether integuments, which were ventilated at each knee, indicating a most praiseworthy regard to the laws of health. He was sitting in a chair pitched back against the wall, with his feet resting on another, and a short Dutch pipe in his mouth, from which volumes of smoke were pouring.  Ida thought she had never seen before so disgusting a man. She continued to gaze at him, half in astonishment, half in terror, till the object of her attention exclaimed,--  “Well, little girl, what you're looking at? Hain't you never seen a gentleman before?”  Ida clung the closer to her companion, who, she was surprised to find, did not resent the man's impertinence.  “Well, Dick, how've you got along since I've been gone?” asked Mrs. Hardwick, to Ida's unbounded astonishment.  “Oh, so so.”  “Have you felt lonely any?”  “I've had good company.”  “Who's been here?”  Dick pointed significantly to a jug, which stood beside his chair.  “So you've brought the gal. How did you get hold of her?”  There was something in these questions which terrified Ida. It seemed to indicate a degree of complicity between these two, which boded no good to her.  “I'll tell you the particulars by and by,” said the nurse, looking significantly at the child's expressive face.  At the same time she began to take off her bonnet.  “You ain't going to stop, are you?” whispered Ida.  “Ain't going to stop!” repeated the man called Dick. “Why shouldn't she? Ain't she at home?”  “At home!” echoed Ida, apprehensively, opening wide her eyes in astonishment.  “Yes, ask her.”  Ida looked, inquiringly, at Mrs. Hardwick.  “You might as well take off your things,” said the latter, grimly. “We ain't going any farther to-day.”  “And where's the lady you said you were going to see?” asked the child, bewildered.  “The one that was interested in you?”  “Yes.”  “Well, I'm the one.”  “You!”  “Yes.”  “I don't want to stay here,” said Ida, becoming frightened.  “Well, what are you going to do about it?” asked the woman, mockingly.  “Will you take me back early to-morrow?”  “No, I don't intend to take you back at all,” said the nurse, coolly.  Ida seemed stupefied with astonishment and terror at first. Then, actuated by a sudden impulse, she ran to the door, and had got it open when the nurse sprang forward, and seizing her by the arm, dragged her rudely back.  “Where are you going in such a hurry?” she demanded, roughly.  “Back to father and mother,” said Ida, bursting into tears. “Oh, why did you carry me away?”  “I'll tell you why,” answered Dick, jocularly. “You see, Ida, we ain't got any little girl to love us, and so we got you.”  “But I don't love you, and I never shall,” said Ida, indignantly.  “Now don't you go to saying that,” said Dick. “You'll break my heart, you will, and then Peg will be a widow.”  To give effect to this pathetic speech, Dick drew out a tattered red handkerchief, and made a great demonstration of wiping his eyes.  The whole scene was so ludicrous that Ida, despite her fears and disgust, could not help laughing hysterically. She recovered herself instantly, and said, imploringly, “Oh, do let me go, and father will pay you; I'm sure he will.”  “You really think he would?” said Dick.  “Oh, yes; and you'll tell her to carry me back, won't you?”  “No, he won't tell me any such thing,” said Peg, gruffly; “and if he did, I wouldn't do it; so you might as well give up all thoughts of that first as last. You're going to stay here; so take off that bonnet of yours, and say no more about it.”  Ida made no motion towards obeying this mandate.  “Then I'll do it for you,” said Peg.  She roughly untied the bonnet, Ida struggling vainly in opposition, and taking this with the shawl, carried them to a closet, in which she placed them, and then, locking the door, deliberately put the key in her pocket.  “There,” said she, “I guess you're safe for the present.”  “Ain't you ever going to carry me back?” asked Ida, wishing to know the worst.  “Some years hence,” said the woman, coolly. “We want you here for the present. Besides, you're not sure that they want to see you back again.”  “Not glad to see me?”  “No; how do you know but your father and mother sent you off on purpose? They've been troubled with you long enough, and now they've bound you apprentice to me till you're eighteen.”  “It's a lie,” said Ida, firmly. “They didn't send me off, and you're a wicked woman to keep me here.”  “Hoity-toity!” said the woman, pausing and looking menacingly at the child. “Have you anything more to say before I whip you?”  “Yes,” said Ida, goaded to desperation; “I shall complain of you to the police, and they will put you in jail, and send me home. That is what I will do.”  The nurse seized Ida by the arm, and striding with her to the closet already spoken of, unlocked it, and rudely pushing her in, locked the door after her.  “She's a spunky 'un,” remarked Dick, taking the pipe from his mouth.  “Yes,” said the woman, “she makes more fuss than I thought she would.”  “How did you manage to come it over her family?” asked Dick.  His wife, gave substantially, the same account with which the reader is already familiar.  “Pretty well done, old woman!” exclaimed Dick, approvingly. “I always said you was a deep 'un. I always say if Peg can't find out a way to do a thing it can't be done, no how.”  “How about the counterfeit coin?” asked his wife, abruptly.  “They're to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46602"],["title","Lydia Knight's History (#0)"],["body","(MormonTextsProject.org)         LYDIA KNIGHT'S HISTORY.  THE FIRST BOOK OF THE NOBLE WOMEN'S LIVES SERIES  By \"Homespun.\"  JUVENILE INSTRUCTOR OFFICE Salt Lake City, Utah.  1883.    PREFACE.    The growing demand for our own literature among the youth of this people has induced us to undertake the publication of a new series of books. The general satisfaction which the books of the Faith-Promoting Series have given, encourages us in the hope that this new series, which is designed to contain various items of interest and instruction from the lives of our noble sisters, will also be worthy of the perusal of the Saints.  We present, as the first book of the Noble Women's Lives Series, the history of a lady who early joined the Church, and remained faithful through the various trials and hardships to which the early Saints were subjected. And now, when in the evening of life, her influence is still being felt for good in Zion. The history of such persons should be written that the young may be stimulated to emulate their noble examples.  That this little work may prove both entertaining and instructive to those into whose hands it may come is the earnest desire of  The Publisher.    LYDIA KNIGHT'S HISTORY.    CHAPTER I.  A little girl with light-blue eyes and fair hair sat under the shade of the forest trees pulling a sheep-skin. One by one her brothers and sisters, older and younger than she, had grown weary of the work and wandered off to play.  \"Oh, Lydia, how can you sit there over that tiresome work. Look at the shadows under the trees, and the squirrels calling to us to come and chase them from limb to limb. Let's have a play,\" said the last little boy as his patience at length had ebbed away.  \"No,\" replied the fair-haired maiden, and the firm little mouth took another line of determination as she spoke, \"I shall not leave the sheepskin till the last lock is pulled.\"  A \"clearing\" in the forest of the western part of New York State, a large comfortable cabin on a rise of ground near the center of the space, with wide-open doors and floors of gleaming white, waving grain on one side of the house and a large vegetable garden on the other side constituted the scene of a home in the forest wilds, which was a common one in those days--the years between 1810 and 1820. The circle of high waving trees gave a grandeur and beauty to the view that nothing else could possibly do.  The little girl who sat so steadily at work had been brought by her parents two years previously to this wild western home.  She was born in 1812, in Sutton, Worcester Co., Mass., and eight happy years had been spent in her earliest home.  Shall I tell you about her father, whose name was Jesse Goldthwait? He was a medium-sized, well-built New Englander, prudent, industrious and the possessor of a firm will. Her mother was a quiet-spoken woman, but she bad an ardent temperament and a great deal of natural refinement. She had had some scholastic advantages and was exceedingly ambitious for her children. Five sisters and six brothers had Lydia, and a very happy and peaceful family they were.  Don't you know what \"wool-pulling\" is? Well, while my little girl is finishing her work I will tell you:  When the sheep was killed for family use, the skin was rolled up by the thrifty farmers in ashes or lime and laid away for some time. Then the wool could easily be separated from the hide. This last piece of labor generally fell to the children. And in Jesse Goldthwait's family none of the children would keep to the work but Lydia. So that it soon passed into a proverb, when Lydia exhibited that determination in anything which was so striking a point in her character, they would say to each other:  \"It's no use trying to make her give up her design. You know Lydia never leaves till the last lock is pulled.\"  The years passed on and Lydia grew apace. But as she attained to early womanhood, she did not lose the slender form, the quiet voice she had inherited from her mother, or the firm will her father had bequeathed to her. She was brought up to habits of work and she had also received religious training from her parents.  When the girl was about fifteen years old, a council was held concerning her by her father and mother:  \"Let us send the girl to school, father: you are comfortable for means, and Lydia is a good, obedient girl.\"  \"That she is,\" replied the father, \"and studiously inclined. I will think it over, mother.\"  After some deliberation, a boarding-school was chosen, and the girl placed under proper care.  Who cannot fancy the life of a school-girl of fifteen? Happy, careless as to the future, mindful of the husking-bees and quiltings, and with bright, shy glances for the youths who begin to \"wish to see you home.\"  Among Lydia's acquaintances in the village where she was attending school, was a young man whose name was Calvin Bailey. One who was a stranger in the village, but his smart, dapper ways, and his smooth address won him many friends among the thoughtless, the youth and the pleasure-loving of the villagers.  \"He is _so_ nice,\" said the girls.  \"Calvin is the right sort of a fellow for a frolic,\" added the young men.  Lydia admired the young man in common with the rest of her companions, and was far too young, too much of a child to dread the very smoothness which so often covers a wicked heart.  The Winter passed into Spring and Lydia returned to her home.  That Summer in her happy home was one long to be remembered by the girl who was fast hastening to so different an experience in life.  The rides with her brothers, the hunts in the forest for nuts, for cones, for flowers and for rare ferns, the quiet, happy talks with her mother, the lovely Sabbath evenings when Father Jesse would solemnly tell of the mysteries of God. All these home joys were hardly appreciated at the time, but long after remembered with sharp pangs of agony.  When the Winter came, she returned to her school, and now the acquaintance already began with young Bailey, ripened into a mutual attachment, and in the Fall of 1828 the couple were married.  For a little time all went well. But the old, old story was told again. The story of a man's cruelty and a woman's suffering.  The young man was one who \"drank occasionally.\" Had he been accused of being a drunkard he would have been highly insulted! But the misery of the poor girl was just as real as though things received their right names and \"a spade be called a spade.\" Shall I attempt to picture her sufferings? The long, lonely hours of waiting, the longing dread to hear the stumbling footsteps, the tortures of fear, the vile abuse, the bitter cursings heaped upon her head, the vain regrets, the puny hopes of a better life born but to be strangled by the next night's waiting agony, the gradual benumbing, crushed feeling that life was made but for suffering--shall I tell of this? No! for those who are waiting and watching for the unsteady step know all I can tell, and they who have never borne the dreadful burden would not understand me.  This firm, quiet wife endured it all in silence. The home they owned was some distance from her father's, and she was too sensitive to complain of one whom she called by the sacred name of husband.  In 1829, a little girl was born, and this great blessing soothed the aching heart of the youthful mother.  The months and years went on, and one morning when Lydia had been married about three years, she woke up to find herself alone, deserted by her husband, poor and almost friendless. What should she do? What could she do? The only course open to her was to return to her father's home; but this was a little trial to her proud spirit. Still it was all that was left for her to do; and taking her little girl by the hand, she entered her parents' home and begged their sympathy and support. She did not ask in vain; the farmer and his wife wept at her sorrow, but gladly took her to their arms once more.  In six months after her return, a little boy was born to her, Feb. 1832, but died almost at its birth.  The girl was quieter, sadder and more subdued than ever. Her work was well done but no light laughter went with it. Tears were often in her eyes, and a constant aching was at her heart.  One year passed away, and in January, 1833, the little girl, her mother's only comfort, was taken ill and died. The mother felt she had indeed drank the last bitter drop from sorrow's cup. She little dreamed of the grand drama of the future, in which she was to act so noble a part. God alone could soothe or heal the wound, and He did.    CHAPTER II.  Snow on the fields, on the hills and in the valleys. Snow on the house-tops and in the crevices. White, soft, dazzling snow.  The scene without was lovely beyond description. The trees weighted down with their crown of glory. But within, the inmates of the farm were comparatively prisoners.  \"My dear,\" the mother said to her husband, \"Lydia is full of sorrow. Her thoughts are far from her works; I fear for her unless something can be done to draw her mind from her trouble.\"  \"Well, wife, these things are beyond our power Lydia will be all right in time.\"  \"Pray God it may be so,\" she fervently replied.  In February, 1833, a young man who had been reared near Lydia's birthplace, by the name of Nikerson, paid a visit to the Goldthwaits.  In reply to their friendly questions, he told them he had settled in Upper Canada, had married the finest little woman in the kingdom, and was getting wealthy at merchandizing.  \"What ails Lydia?\" he asked one day.  \"She is ill and full of sorrow.\" And then the sad story was told. And at its close, the young man sat silent for some time with tears of sympathy in his eyes for the poor young creature.  Finally, looking up, he said: \"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Goldthwait, let me take that girl home with me, and I'll warrant my wife and I will bring back the roses to her cheeks, if kindness and comfort can do it. Don't you"]]]
