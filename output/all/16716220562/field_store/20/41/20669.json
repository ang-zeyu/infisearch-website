From the parlour they bow us into a long room in the right wing, its walls being plain boarded, and well ventilated with open seams. A table is spread with substantial edibles,-such as ham, bacon, mutton, and fish. These represent the southern planter's fare, to which he seldom adds those pastry delicacies with which the New Englander is prone to decorate his table. The party become seated as Franconia graces the festive board with her presence, which, being an incentive of gallantry, preserves the nicest decorum, smooths the conversation. The wine-cup flows freely; the Elder dips deeply-as he declares it choice. Temperance being unpopular in the south, it is little regarded at Marston's mansion. As for Marston himself, he is merely preparing the way to play facetious jokes on the Elder, whose arm he touches every few minutes, reminding him how backward he is in replenishing his glass.  Not at all backward in such matters, the Elder fills up, asks the pleasure of drinking his very good health, and empties the liquid into the safest place nearest at hand. Repeated courses have their effect; Marston is pleased, the Elder is mellow. With muddled sensibilities his eyes glare wildly about the table, and at every fresh invitation to drink he begs pardon for having neglected his duty, fingers the ends of his cravat, and deposits another glass,-certainly the very last. Franconia, perceiving her uncle's motive, begs to be excused, and is escorted out of the room. Mr. Praiseworthy, attempting to get a last glass of wine to his lips without spilling, is quite surprised that the lady should leave. He commences descanting on his own fierce enmity to infidelity and catholicism. He would that everybody rose up and trampled them into the dust; both are ruinous to negro property.  Marston coolly suggests that the Elder is decidedly uncatholicised.  \"Elder,\" interrupted Deacon Rosebrook, touching him on the shoulder, \"you are modestly undone-that is, very respectably sold to your wine.\"  \"Yes,\" rejoined Marston; \"I would give an extra ten dollars to hear him preach a sermon to my niggers at this moment.\"  \"Villainous inconsistency!\" exclaimed the Elder, in an indistinct voice, his eyes half closed, and the spectacles gradually falling from his nose. \"You are scandalising my excellent character, which can't be replaced with gold.\" Making another attempt to raise a glass of wine to his lips, as he concluded, he unconsciously let the contents flow into his bosom, instead of his mouth.  \"Well, my opinion is, Elder, that if you get my nigger property into heaven with your preaching, there'll be a chance for the likes of me,\" said Marston, watching the Elder intently. It was now evident the party were all becoming pretty deeply tinctured. Rosebrook thought a minister of the gospel, to get in such a condition, and then refer to religious matters, must have a soul empty to the very core. There could be no better proof of how easily true religion could be brought into contempt. The Elder foreclosed with the spirit, considered himself unsafe in the chair, and was about to relieve it, when Dandy caught him in his arms like a lifeless mass, and carried him to a settee, upon which he spread him, like a substance to be bleached in the sun.  \"Gentlemen! the Elder is completely unreverenced,-he is the most versatile individual that ever wore black cloth. I reverence him for his qualities,\" says Marston: then, turning to Maxwell, he continued, \"you must excuse this little joviality; it occurs but seldom, and the southern people take it for what it is worth, excusing, or forgetting its effects.\"  \"Don't speak of it-it's not unlike our English do at times-nor do our ministers form exceptions; but they do such things under a monster protection, without reckoning the effect,\" the Englishman replied, looking round as if he missed the presence of Franconia.  The Elder, soon in a profound sleep, was beset by swarms of mosquitoes preying upon his haggard face, as if it were good food. \"He's a pretty picture,\" says Marston, looking upon the sleeping Elder with a frown, and then working his fingers through his crispy red hair. \"A hard subject for the student's knife he'll make, won't he?\" To add to the comical appearance of the reverend gentleman, Marston, rising from his seat, approached him, drew the spectacles from his pocket, and placed them on the tip of his nose, adding piquancy to his already indescribable physiognomy.  \"Don't you think this is carrying the joke a point too far?\" asked Deacon Rosebrook, who had been some time silently watching the prostrate condition of Elder Pemberton Praiseworthy.  Marston shrugs his shoulders, whispers a word or two in the ear of his friend Maxwell, twirls his glass upon the table. He is somewhat cautious how he gives an opinion on such matters, having previously read one or two law books; but believes it does'nt portray all things just right. He has studied ideal good-at least he tells us so-if he never practises it; finally, he is constrained to admit that this 'ere's all very well once in a while, but becomes tiresome--especially when kept up as strong as the Elder does it. He is free to confess that southern mankind is curiously constituted, too often giving license to revelries, but condemning those who fall by them. He feels quite right about the Elder's preaching being just the chime for his nigger property; but, were he a professing Christian, it would'nt suit him by fifty per cent. There is something between the mind of a \"nigger\" and the mind of a white man,--something he can't exactly analyse, though he is certain it is wonderfully different; and though such preaching can do niggers no harm, he would just as soon think of listening to Infidelity. Painful as it was to acknowledge the fact, he only appeared at the \"Meet'n House\" on Sundays for the looks of the thing, and in the hope that it might have some influence with his nigger property. Several times he had been heard to say it was mere machine-preaching-made according to pattern, delivered according to price, by persons whose heads and hearts had no sympathy with the downcast.  \"There's my prime fellow Harry; a right good fellow, worth nine hundred, nothing short, and he is a Christian in conscience. He has got a kind of a notion into his head about being a divine. He thinks, in the consequence of his black noddle, that he can preach just as well as anybody; and, believe me, he can't read a letter in the book,--at least, I don't see how he can. True, he has heard the Elder's sermon so often that he has committed every word of it to memory,--can say it off like a plantation song, and no mistake.\" Thus Marston discoursed. And yet he declared that nobody could fool him with the idea of \"niggers\" having souls: they were only mortal,--he would produce abundant proof, if required.  Deacon Rosebrook listened attentively to this part of Marston's discourse. \"The task of proving your theory would be rendered difficult if you were to transcend upon the scale of blood,\" he replied, getting up and spreading his handkerchief over the Elder's face, to keep off the mosquitoes.  \"When our most learned divines and philosophers are the stringent supporters of the principle, what should make the task difficult? Nevertheless, I admit, if my fellow Harry could do the preaching for our plantation, no objections would be interposed by me; on the contrary, I could make a good speculation by it. Harry would be worth two common niggers then. Nigger property, christianised, is the most valuable of property. You may distinguish a christianised nigger in a moment; and piety takes the stubborn out of their composition better than all the cowhides you can employ; and, too, it's a saving of time, considering that it subdues so much quicker,\" says Marston, stretching back in his chair, as he orders Dandy to bring Harry into his presence. He will tell them what he knows about preaching, the Elder's sermon, and the Bible!  Maxwell smiles at such singularly out of place remarks on religion. They are not uncommon in the south, notwithstanding.  A few minutes elapsed, when Dandy opened the door, and entered the room, followed by a creature-a piece of property!-in which the right of a soul had been disputed, not alone by Marston, but by southern ministers and southern philosophers. The thing was very good- looking, very black;-it had straight features, differing from the common African, and stood very erect. We have said he differed from the common African-we mean, as he is recognised through our prejudices. His forehead was bold and well-developed-his hair short, thick and crispy, eyes keen and piercing, cheeks regularly declining into a well-shaped mouth and chin. Dejected and forlorn, the wretch of chance stood before them, the fires of a burning soul glaring forth from his quick, wandering eyes. \"There!\" exclaimed Marston. \"See that,\" pointing at his extremes; \"he has foot enough for a brick-maker, and a head equal to a deacon-no insinuation, my friend,\" bowing to Deacon Rosebrook. \"They say it takes a big head to get into Congress; but I'm afraid, Harry, I'd never get there.\"  The door again opened, and another clever-looking old negro, anxious to say \"how de do\" to mas'r and his visitors, made his appearance, bowing, and keeping time with his foot. \"Oh, here's my old daddy-old Daddy Bob, one of the best old niggers on the plantation; Harry and Bob are my deacons. There,--stand there, Harry; tell these gentlemen,--they are right glad to see you,--what you know about Elder Praiseworthy's sermon, and what you can do in the way of preaching,\" says Marston, laughing good-naturedly.  \"Rather a rough piece of property to make a preacher of,\" muttered Maxwell.  The poor fellow's feet were encrusted as hard as an alligator's back; and there he stood, a picture"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4677"],["title","Our World; Or, the Slaveholder's Daughter (#7)"],["body","which the sympathies of Christendom were enlisted-a human object without the rights of man, in a free republic. He held a red cap in his left hand, a pair of coarse osnaburg trousers reached a few inches below his knees, and, together with a ragged shirt of the same material, constituted his covering.  \"You might have dressed yourself before you appeared before gentlemen from abroad-at least, put on your new jacket,\" said Marston.  \"Why, mas'r, t'ant de clothes. God neber make Christian wid'e his clothes on;-den, mas'r, I gin' my new jacket to Daddy Bob. But neber mind him, mas'r-you wants I to tell you what I tinks ob de Lor. I tink great site ob the Bible, mas'r, but me don' tink much ob Elder's sermon, mas'r.\"  \"How is that, Harry?\" interrupted the deacon.  \"Why, Mas'r Deacon, ye sees how when ye preaches de good tings ob de Lor', ye mus'nt 'dulge in 'e wicked tings on 'arth. A'h done want say Mas'r Elder do dem tings-but 'e seem to me t' warn't right wen 'e join de wickedness ob de world, and preach so ebery Sunday. He may know de varse, and de chapter, but 'e done preach what de Lor' say, nohow.\"  \"Then you don't believe in a one-sided sermon, Harry?\" returned the deacon, while Marston and Maxwell sat enjoying the negro's simple opinion of the Elder's sermon.  \"No, mas'r. What the Bible teach me is to lob de Lor'-be good myself, and set example fo'h oders. I an't what big white Christian say must be good, wen 'e neber practice him,--but I good in me heart when me tink what de Lor' say be good. Why, mas'r, Elder preach dat sarmon so many Sundays, dat a' forgot him three times, since me know 'im ebery word,\" said Harry; and his face began to fill with animation and fervency.  \"Well, now, Harry, I think you are a little too severe on the Elder's sermon; but if you know so much about it, give these gentlemen a small portion of it, just to amuse them while the Elder is taking a nap,\" said Marston.  \"Ay, mas'r, be nap dat way too often for pious man what say he lobe de Lor',\" replied Harry; and drawing himself into a tragic attitude, making sundry gesticulations, and putting his hand to his forehead, commenced with the opening portion of the Elder's sermon. \"And it was said-Servants obey your masters, for that is right in the sight of the Lord,\" and with a style of native eloquence, and rich cantation, he continued for about ten minutes, giving every word, seriatim, of the Elder's sermon; and would have kept it up, in word and action, to the end, had he not been stopped by Marston. All seemed astonished at his power of memory. Maxwell begged that he might be allowed to proceed.  \"He's a valuable fellow, that-eh?\" said Marston. \"He'll be worth three-sixteenths of a rise on cotton to all the planters in the neighbourhood, by-and-by. He's larned to read, somehow, on the sly-isn't it so, Harry? come, talk up!\"  \"Yes, mas'r, I larn dat when you sleepin'; do Lor' tell me his spirit warn't in dat sarmon what de Elder preach,--dat me must sarch de good book, and make me own tinking valuable. Mas'r tink ignorant nigger lob him best, but t'ant so, mas'r. Good book make heart good, and make nigger love de Lor', and love mas'r too.\"  \"I'll bet the rascal's got a Bible, or a Prayer-book, hid up somewhere. He and old Daddy Bob are worse on religion than two old coons on a fowl-yard,\" said Marston. Here old Aunt Rachel entered the room to fuss around a little, and have a pleasant meeting with mas'r's guests. Harry smiled at Marston's remark, and turned his eyes upward, as much as to say, \"a day will come when God's Word will not thus be turned into ridicule!\"  \"And he's made such a good old Christian of this dark sinner, Aunt Rachel, that I wouldn't take two thousand dollars for her. I expect she'll be turning preacher next, and going north to join the abolitionists.\"  \"Mas'r,\" said Rachel, \"'t wouldn't do to mind what you say. Neber mind, you get old one ob dese days; den you don't make so much fun ob old Rachel.\"  \"Shut up your corn-trap,\" Marston says, smiling; and turning to his guests, continues-\"You hear that, gentlemen; she talks just as she pleases, directs my household as if she were governor.\" Again, Aunt Rachel, summoning her dignity, retorts,  \"Not so, Mas'r Deacon, (turning to Deacon Rosebrook,) \"'t won't square t' believe all old Boss tell, dat it won't! Mas'r take care ob de two cabins in de yard yonder, while I tends de big house.\" Rachel was more than a match for Marston; she could beat him in quick retort. The party, recognising Aunt Rachel's insinuation, joined in a hearty laugh. The conversation was a little too pointed for Marston, who, changing the subject, turned to Harry, saying, \"now, my old boy, we'll have a little more of your wisdom on religious matters.\" Harry had been standing the while like a forlorn image, with a red cap in his hand.  \"I can preach, mas'r; I can do dat, fo'h true,\" he replied quickly. \"But mas'r, nigger got to preach against his colour; Buckra tink nigger preachin' ain't good, cus he black.\"  \"Never mind that, Harry,\" interrupts Marston: \"We'll forget the nigger, and listen just as if it were all white. Give us the very best specimen of it. Daddy Bob, my old patriarch, must help you; and after you get through, he must lift out by telling us all about the time when General Washington landed in the city; and how the people spread carpets, at the landing, for him to walk upon.\" The entertainment was, in Marston's estimation, quite a recherch‚ concern: that his guests should be the better pleased, the venerable old Daddy Bob, his head white with goodly years of toil, and full of genuine negro humour, steps forward to perform his part. He makes his best bows, his best scrapes, his best laughs; and says, \"Bob ready to do anything to please mas'r.\" He pulls the sleeves of his jacket, looks vacantly at Harry, is proud to be in the presence of mas'r's guests. He tells them he is a better nigger \"den\" Harry, points to his extremes, which are decorated with a pair of new russet broghans.  \"Daddy's worth his weight in gold,\" continues Marston, \"and can do as much work as any nigger on the plantation, if he is old.\"  \"No, no, mas'r; I ain't so good what I was. Bob can't tote so much wid de hoe now. I work first-rate once, mas'r, but 'a done gone now!\"  \"Now, Bob, I want you to tell me the truth,--niggers will lie, but you are an exception, Bob; and can tell the truth when there's no bacon in the way.\"  \"Gih! Mas'r, I do dat sartin,\" replied Bob, laughing heartily, and pulling up the little piece of shirt that peeped out above the collar of his jacket.  \"How did Harry and you come by so much knowledge of the Bible? you got one somewhere, hav'n't you?\" enquired Marston, laconically.  This was rather a \"poser\" on Bob; and, after stammering and mumbling for some time-looking at Harry slyly, then at Marston, and again dropping his eyes on the floor, he ejaculated,  \"Well, mas'r, 'spose I might as well own 'im. Harry and me got one, for sartin!\"  \"Ah, you black rascals, I knew you had one somewhere. Where did you get it? That's some of Miss Franconia's doings.\"  \"Can't tell you, mas'r, whar I got him; but he don't stop my hoein' corn, for' true.\"  Franconia had observed Harry's tractableness, and heard him wish for a Bible, that he might learn to read from it,--and she had secretly supplied him with one. Two years Harry and Daddy Bob had spent hours of the night in communion over it; the latter had learned to read from it, the former had imbibed its great truths. The artless girl had given it to them in confidence, knowing its consolatory influences and that they, with a peculiar firmness in such cases, would never betray her trust. Bob would not have refused his master any other request; but he would never disclose the secret of Miss Franconia giving it.  \"Well, my old faithful,\" said Marston, \"we want you to put the sprit into Harry; we want to hear a sample of his preaching. Now, Harry, you can begin; give it big eloquence, none of the new fashion preaching, give us the old plantation break-down style.\"  The negro's countenance assumed a look indicative of more than his lips dare speak. Looking upward pensively, he replied,--\"Can't do dat, mas'r; he ain't what do God justice; but there is something in de text,--where shall I take 'em from?\"  \"Ministers should choose their own; I always do,\" interrupted Deacon Rosebrook.  Daddy Bob, touching Harry on the arm, looks up innocently, interposes his knowledge of Scripture. \"D'ar, Harry, I tells you what text to gin 'em. Gin 'em dat one from de fourt' chapter of Ephes: dat one whar de Lor' say:--'Great mas'r led captivity captive, and gin gifts unto men.' And whar he say, 'Till we come unto a unity of the faith of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; that we be no more children tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lay in wait to deceive.'\"  \"And you tink dat 'll do,--eh, Daddy?\" Harry replies, looking at the old man, as if to say, were he anything but a slave he would follow the advice.  \"Den, dars t' oder one, away 'long yonder, where 'e say in Isaiah, fifty-eight chapter--'Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness.\" The old man seemed perfectly at home on matters of Scripture; he had studied it in stolen moments.  The young Englishman seemed surprised at such a show of talent. He saw the humble position of the old man, his want of early instruction, and his anxiety to be enlightened. \"How singular!\" he ejaculated, \"to hear property preach, and know so much of the Bible, too! People in my country would open their eyes with surprise.\" The young man had been educated in an atmosphere where religion was prized-where it was held as "]]]
