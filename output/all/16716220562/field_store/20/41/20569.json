In the army or out of it, the wine of life is white and still, but at the Front it runs red and sparkling. One day I got a lift in a motor-wagon and sat on a box by the side of one of the servants of the officer’s mess at the Aerodrome near by.  He was going into Doullens, a market town, to buy food and some little luxuries. Captain Ball, V.C., the prince of English flyers, was, up to the time of his death in the air, a member of the mess, and the servant was telling me how comfortable all the officers make their quarters.  In a phrase he defined the glamour of the Front.  \"One day,\" he said, \"when we were helping him to make his room comfortable, Captain Ball burst out into a merry laugh and chuckled, ’We haven’t long to live, but we live well while we do live.’\"  There you have it.  Life is concentrated. Death is near--just round the corner--so the men make the most of their time and \"live well.\"  It has the same quality as \"leave\" at home.  Leave is short and uncertain, so we \"live well.\"  Our friends know it may be the last sight of us, and we know it may be our last sight of them.  They are kind and generous to us, as we are to them; and so, the ten days of \"leave\" are just glorious.  Ruskin says that the full splendor of the sunset lasts but a second, and that Turner went out early in the evening and watched with rapt attention for that one second of supreme splendor and delight.  He lived for sunsets and while others were balancing their accounts, or taking tea, he went out to see the daily miracle.  The one second in which he saw God pass by in the glory of the sunset was to him worth all the twenty-four hours.  For one second in each day he caught the glamour of earth and heaven, and went back to his untidy studios blind to all but the splendor he had seen.  That second each day was life, indeed, and the glamour of the Front is like unto it.  It is the place where life sets, and the darkness of death draws on.  The commonest soldier feels it and with true instinct, not less true because unconscious, he describes death at the Front as \"going West.\"  It is the presence of death that gives the Front its glamour, and life its concentrated joy and fascination.  Captain Ball saw it with the intuition of genius when he said: \"We haven’t long to live, but we live well while we _do_ live.\"  The immediate presence of death at the Front gives tone to every expression of life, and makes it the kindest place in the world.  No one feels he can do too much for you, and there is nothing you would not do for another. Whether you are an officer or a private, you can get a lift on any road, in any vehicle, that has an inch of room in it.  How often have I seen a dozen tired Tommies clambering up the back of an empty motor-lorry which has stopped, or slowed down, to let them get in. It is one of the merriest sights of the war and redounds to the credit of human nature. Cigarettes are passed round by those who have, to those who have not, with a generosity that reminds one of nothing so much as that of the early Christians who \"had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.\"  You need never go hungry while others have food.  Officers are welcome at every mess they go near, and privates will get food in the servants’ kitchen or may go shares with the men in any billet.  It may be a man’s own fault that he took no food on the march, and his comrades may tell him so in plain strong language, but they will compel him to share what they have just the same.  One wet night on the Somme I got lost in \"Happy Valley\" and could not find my regiment. Seeing a light in a tent, I made for it. It was a pioneers’ tent, but they invited me to come in out of the storm and stay the night. They were at supper and had only a small supply of bully-beef, biscuits and strong tea; but they insisted on me sharing what they had. I was dripping with rain, and they gave me one of their blankets.  One of them gave me a box to sleep on, while he shared his chum’s. Some lost privates came in later wet to the skin, and the pioneers gave them all the eatables left over from supper, and shared out their blankets and clothes.  It was pure Christianity--whatever creeds they may think they believe.  And it is the glamour of the Front. England feels cold and dull after it.  Kindness and comradeship pervade the air in France. You feel that everyone is a friend and brother. It will be pretty hard for chaplains to go back to their churches.  They have been spoiled by too much kindness.  How can they go back to the cold atmosphere of criticism and narrow judgments which prevail in so many churches--that is, unless the war has brought changes there also? And after preaching to dying men who listen as it their destiny depended upon their hearing, how can they go back to pulpits where large numbers in the congregations regard their messages as of less importance than dinner, and as merely supplying material for an exercise in more or less kindly criticism during the discussion of that meal?  The glamour of the services at the Front! How the scenes are photographed on my heart!  As a congregation sits in a church at home how stolid its features often are--how dull its eyes!  One glance around and the preacher’s heart sinks within him and his inspiration flies away.  Nothing is expected of him, and nothing particularly desired. People have come by force of habit, and not of need. But how the eyes of the soldiers in France glow and burn; how their features speak, and make the preacher speak in reply!  Who could help being eloquent there!  Such faces would make the dumb speak.  One can see the effect of his words as plainly in their expressions as he can see the effect of wind on a cornfield.  Every emotion from humor to concern leaps from the heart to the face as the subject touches them at, first this point of their life, then at that. The men’s eyes are unforgettable.  Months afterwards they come vividly to mind, and one is back again answering the questions they silently ask, and seeing the look of content or gratitude that takes the place of the perplexed or troubled expression.  Eyes are said to be the windows of the soul, and as I have spoken I have seen men’s souls looking out.  At home the windows are darkened and there seemed to be no souls behind the panes.  The dwellers within the houses are busy with other matters, and will not come to the windows.  The preacher feels like an organ-grinder in the street--those who hear do not heed nor come to the windows of the soul.  In France there is a soul looking out at every window; and the preacher sings--for his words grow rhythmic--to his listeners of the love of God and of the love of women and children which make sweet this vale of tears and light man on his lone way beyond the grave.  One Sunday in hospital, when we heard the singing of a hymn in the ward below, a young officer, in the next bed, turned to me and said: \"Why doesn’t the chaplain hold a service for us?  Why does he only hold them for the Tommies?  We need them and want them, just as much as the Tommies.  We are officers but we are also men.\"  I passed the word to the chaplain, and he was a joyful man when in the evening he gave us a service and the officers of the next ward asked the orderlies to carry them in.  There is the same naturalness and spirit of fellowship between members of various churches.  Many lasting friendships have been formed between chaplains of differing communions.  There has been no change of creed but something greater, a change of spirit. They have been touched by the common spirit, and have lived and worked in free and happy fellowship. On my last Sunday in a hospital in France, the chaplain, a canon of the Church of England, invited me to read the lesson at the morning parade service, and to administer the wine at Holy Communion.  This I did; and a colonel who was present stayed behind to express to us both the pleasure which had been given to him by the sight of Anglican and Methodist churchmen serving together at the Lord’s Table.  To a chaplain not a little of the glamour of the Front is found in this warm fellowship between men of differing creeds and varying religious communions.  We have not knocked down our garden walls but we have taken off the cut glass that had been cemented on them by our fathers; and now we can lean over and talk to our neighbors.  We have already found that our neighbors are human beings, and quite normal.  The chief difference between us seems to be that while one has an obsession for roses the other has an obsession for dahlias.  On pansies, sweet peas and chrysanthemums we seem equally keen and exchange plants.  A Roman Catholic officer who had been appointed to the Ulster Division told me that though he was received coldly at first, he had not been with the Division more than a few weeks when every officer in his regiment, and every soldier in his company, accepted him as cordially as if he were a Protestant.  He was from Dublin and they from Belfast, but they did not allow it to make any difference, and feelings of the warmest loyalty and friendship sprang up. His Tommies would fight to the death by his side, as readily as around any Ulsterman; and he was just as popular in the officers’ mess. When, he said, it passed the Irish Guards or any other Roman Catholic regiment, his regiment would sing some provoking song about \"hanging the Pope with a good "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46323"],["title","The Soul of the Soldier: Sketches from the Western Battle-Front (#5)"],["body","rope,\" and the Dublin regiment would reply with some song equally obnoxious and defiant; but whereas, in peace time, the songs would have caused a free fight to the accompaniment of bloodshed, now it caused nothing worse than laughter. The songs were just a bit of teasing such as every regiment likes to regale another with--perhaps, too, a common memory of the dear country they have left behind.  The men of Belfast and the men of Dublin have learned to respect and value one another.  They know that in a scrap with the enemy they can count on one another to the last drop of blood, for, whether from North or South, the Irish are \"bonnie fighters.\"  Of such are the miracles at the Front.  Most of all, perhaps, the glamour of the Front is found in the nobility to which common men rise.  An artillery officer told me that he had in his battery a soldier who seemed utterly worthless.  He was dirty in all his ways, and unreliable in character.  In despair they made him sanitary orderly, that is, the scavenger whose duty it was to remove all refuse.  One night the officer wanted a man to go on a perilous errand and there were few men available.  Instantly this lad volunteered. The officer looked at him in amazement, and with a reverence born on the instant.  \"No,\" he thought, \"I will not let him go and get killed.  I’ll go myself.\"  He told the lad so, and disappointment was plainly written on his features.  \"But, you’ll let me come with you, sir?\" he replied.  \"Why should two risk their lives,\" asked the officer, \"when one can do the job?\"  \"But you might get wounded, sir,\" was the quick response; and they went together.  An Irish officer told me of one man who seemed bad from top to toe.  All the others had some redeeming feature but this man appeared not to possess any.  He used the filthiest language and was dirty in his habits and dress. He was drunken and stole the officers’ whisky out of the mess.  He was unchaste and had been in the hospital with venereal disease; and neither as man nor soldier was there anything good to say of him.  The regiment was sent to France, and in due time took its place in the trenches; and then appeared in this man something that had never risen to the surface before.  Wherever there were wounded and dying men he proved himself to be the noblest man in the regiment.  When a man fell in No Man’s Land, he was over the parapet in the twinkling of an eye to bring him in.  No barrage could keep him away from the wounded. It was a sort of passion with him that nothing could restrain.  To save others he risked his life scores of times.  In rest-billets he would revert to some of his evil ways, but in the trenches he was the Greatheart of the regiment and, though he did not receive it, he earned the Victoria Cross over and over again.  There is a glamour at the Front that holds the heart with an irresistible grip.  In the light of War’s deathly fires the hearts of men are revealed and the black sheep often get their chance.  Life is intense and deep and men are drawn together by a common peril. They find the things that unite and forget the things that separate.  \"We haven’t long to live,\" said Captain Ball joyfully, \"but we live well while we _do_ live,\" and in those words he expressed the glamour of the Front.  Ball found, as thousands of his comrades-in-arms had found, that      \"One crowded hour of glorious life     Is worth an age without a name.\"                                       *IV*                           *A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF*   In his _History of the Somme Campaign_ John Buchan quotes, from an official report, an incident which, though I have tried, I cannot get my imagination to believe. Probably the incident is a true one but, unfortunately for me, my mind will not let it in. I cannot visualize it and the report is turned from the door as an impostor.  The report states that in a certain attack our aeroplanes fired on the Germans in their trenches and that the enemy waved white handkerchiefs in token of surrender.  Without the slightest difficulty I can imagine all except the white handkerchiefs. Where did they get them to wave? Men in the firing trenches don’t carry anything so conspicuous as white handkerchiefs.  To draw one out in a thoughtless moment might bring a sniper’s bullet, and there are risks enough without inviting more.  I doubt if in any English regiment two white handkerchiefs could be found: and I have little expectation that more could be found among the enemy. Furthermore, it is questionable, at this stage of the war, if a white handkerchief would be regarded as a sign, of surrender.  It might be taken as a taunt.  There is nothing more remarkable in the war than the psychological change that has been wrought in white.  A white feather used to be the badge of cowardice and a white flag the token of surrender.  It is not so now. White has taken on a peculiar sacredness.  If a new medal were to be struck of the same high value as the Victoria Cross it would probably be given a white ribbon, as the other has a red or (for the navy) blue.  This change in the moral significance of white was brought home to me by an incident in a billet. I had gone to a barn to give the men some shirts and socks that had been sent to me.  I stood on the steps, and like an auctioneer, offered my goods for acceptance.  \"Who wants a shirt?  Who a scarf?  Who wants this pair of mittens?  Who a pair of socks?\"  Hands shot up at each question, and the fun grew fast and furious.  Then I drew out and held up a white handkerchief.  \"A-ah! A-ah!\" they cried wistfully in chorus.  For a moment they stood gazing at it and forgot to raise their hands towards it; then, with a single movement, every hand shot up.  Unwittingly I had stirred them to the depths; and I felt sorry for them.  The Magic Carpet of Baghdad is not a fiction after all.  In the twinkling of an eye my white handkerchief had carried every boy and man to his home, and placed him by the fireside.  I saw it in their eyes and heard it in the sadness and wistfulness of their voices as they ejaculated \"A-ah!\"  They had not seen a white handkerchief for months. The last they saw was at home.  A vision of home flashed before their minds and they were back in the dear old days of peace when they used white handkerchiefs and khaki ones were unknown to them.  If in battle they were to see Germans waving white handkerchiefs, I think it would make them savage and unwilling to give quarter.  They would think the enemy was taunting them with all they had lost.  And they would be maddened by the thought that here were the very men who, by their war-lust, had caused them to lose it.  For a German to wave a white handkerchief before a British soldier would be as dangerous as flaunting a red flag before a bull.  It would bring death rather than pity. Anything of pure white is rare at the front, and it has gradually taken on a meaning it never held before.  About the only white thing we have is the paper we write home on, and that use of the color helps to sanctify it in the shrine of the heart.  In the army it is a term of supreme praise to call a man _white_.  When you say a comrade is a \"_white man_\" there is no more to be said. It is worth more than the Victoria Cross with its red ribbon, for it includes gallantry, and adds to it goodness.  A man must be brave to be called white and he must be generous, noble and good.  To reach whiteness is a great achievement.  To be dubbed white is, in the army, like being dubbed knight at King Arthur’s Court or canonized saint in the Church. He stands out among a soldier’s comrades distinct as a white handkerchief among khaki ones.  I don’t know where the term came from, but, wherever it may have tarried on the way, I think its footprints could be traced back to the Book of Revelation for its starting place. In the first chapter we have a picture of Christ as the first \"White Man\"--\"His Head and His Hairs were white like wool, as white as snow.\"  In the second chapter His faithful followers are given \"a white stone, and in the stone a new name written.\"  Is not the new name \"White man\"?  In the third chapter we read of \"a few names even in Sardis which have _not defiled their garments_; and they shall _walk with Me in white_; for they are worthy.\" There, too, the Laodiceans are counseled to buy \"white raiment.\"  In the fourth chapter we see the four and twenty elders, sitting around the throne under the rainbow arch, \"clothed in white raiment.\"  In the sixth chapter we have the crowned King going \"forth conquering, and to conquer\" and He is sitting on \"a white horse,\" that is, He uses \"white\" instruments to carry out His conquests.  Death, in the same chapter, rides on a \"pale\" horse, but not a \"white\" one.  Under the altar were the souls of the martyrs, \"And white robes were given unto every one of them.\"  And surely the climax is reached when we read in the seventh chapter that \"a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes.\"  So striking was the scene that one of the elders asked, \"What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?\"  And the answer is given, \"These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God.\"  In the army white has come back to its ancient significance.  The brave and noble martyrs of the early Church were given \"white robes\" and in the army to-day the brave and pure wear \"white robes\" in the eyes of their comrades.  When Clifford Reed was killed by a shell at his Regimental Aid Post his colonel wrote of him that he was the \"whitest man\" he had ever known.  He had done more than wear \"the white flower of a _blameless_ life.\"  His virtues were positive, not merely negative. He wore a \"white _robe_\"; not a mere"]]]
