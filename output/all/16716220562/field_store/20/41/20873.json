A well-to-do merchant from Bremen who travelled for some distance in my train assured me that there was plenty of food in Germany, except of course for the poor. Distress, he said, was confined entirely to these. Similarly a Prussian gentleman who looked very like a soldier, but who assured me with some heat that he was a commercial traveller, told me the same thing: There were no cases of starvation, he said, except among the very poor.  The aspect of the people too, at the stations and in the towns we passed, puzzled me. There were no uniforms, no soldiers. But I was amazed at the number of commercial travellers, Lutheran ministers, photographers, and so forth, and the odd resemblance they presented, in spite of their innocent costumes, to the arrogant and ubiquitous military officers whom I had observed on my former visit.  But I was too anxious to reach Berlin to pay much attention to the details of my journey.  Even when I at last reached the capital, I arrived as I had feared, too late.  \"Your Excellency,\" said a courteous official at the railway station, to whom my naval uniform acted as a sufficient passport. \"The Revolution of which you speak is over. Its leaders were arrested yesterday. But you shall not be disappointed. There is a better one. It is called the Comrades' Revolution of the Bolsheviks. The chief Executive was installed yesterday.\"  \"Would it be possible for me to see him?\" I asked.  \"Nothing simpler, Excellency,\" he continued as a tear rose in his eye. \"My four sons,--\"  \"I know,\" I said; \"your four sons are in the German Navy. It is enough. Can you take me to the Leader?\"  \"I can and will,\" said the official. \"He is sitting now in the Free Palace of all the German People, once usurped by the Hohenzollern Tyrant. The doors are guarded by machine guns. But I can take you direct from here through a back way. Come.\"  We passed out from the station, across a street and through a maze of little stairways, and passages into the heart of the great building that had been the offices of the Imperial Government.  \"Enter this room. Do not knock,\" said my guide. \"Good bye.\"  In another moment I found myself face to face with the chief comrade of the Bolsheviks.  He gave a sudden start as he looked at me, but instantly collected himself.  He was sitting with his big boots up on the mahogany desk, a cigar at an edgeways angle in his mouth. His hair under his sheepskin cap was shaggy, and his beard stubbly and unshaven. His dress was slovenly and there was a big knife in his belt. A revolver lay on the desk beside him. I had never seen a Bolshevik before but I knew at sight that he must be one.  \"You say you were here in Berlin once before?\" he questioned, and he added before I had time to answer: \"When you speak don't call me 'Excellency' or 'Sereneness' or anything of that sort; just call me 'brother' or 'comrade.' This is the era of freedom. You're as good as I am, or nearly.\"  \"Thank you,\" I said.  \"Don't be so damn polite,\" he snarled. \"No good comrade ever says 'thank you.' So you were here in Berlin before?\"  \"Yes,\" I answered, \"I was here writing up Germany from Within in the middle of the war.\"  \"The war, the war!\" he murmured, in a sort of wail or whine. \"Take notice, comrade, that I weep when I speak of it. If you write anything about me be sure to say that I cried when the war was mentioned. We Germans have been so misjudged. When I think of the devastation of France and Belgium I weep.\"  He drew a greasy, red handkerchief from his pocket and began to sob. \"To think of the loss of all those English merchant ships!\"  \"Oh, you needn't worry,\" I said, \"it's all going to be paid for.\"  \"Oh I hope so, I do hope so,\" said the Bolshevik chief. \"What a regret it is to us Germans to think that unfortunately we are not able to help pay for it; but you English--you are so generous--how much we have admired your noble hearts--so kind, so generous to the vanquished...\"  His voice had subsided into a sort of whine.  But at this moment there was a loud knocking at the door. The Bolshevik hastily wiped the tears from his face and put away his handkerchief.  \"How do I look?\" he asked anxiously. \"Not humane, I hope? Not soft?\"  \"Oh, no,\" I said, \"quite tough.\"  \"That's good,\" he answered. \"That's good. But am I tough ENOUGH?\"  He hastily shoved his hands through his hair.  \"Quick,\" he said, \"hand me that piece of chewing tobacco. Now then. Come in!\"  The door swung open.  A man in a costume much like the leader's swaggered into the room. He had a bundle of papers in his hands, and seemed to be some sort of military secretary.  \"Ha! comrade!\" he said, with easy familiarity. \"Here are the death warrants!\"  \"Death warrants!\" said the Bolshevik. \"Of the leaders of the late Revolution? Excellent! And a good bundle of them! One moment while I sign them.\"  He began rapidly signing the warrants, one after the other.  \"Comrade,\" said the secretary in a surly tone, \"you are not chewing tobacco!\"  \"Yes I am, yes I am,\" said the leader, \"or, at least, I was just going to.\"  He bit a huge piece out of his plug, with what seemed to me an evident distaste, and began to chew furiously.  \"It is well,\" said the other. \"Remember comrade, that you are watched. It was reported last night to the Executive Committee of the Circle of the Brothers that you chewed no tobacco all day yesterday. Be warned, comrade. This is a free and independent republic. We will stand for no aristocratic nonsense. But whom have you here?\" he added, breaking off in his speech, as if he noticed me for the first time. \"What dog is this?\"  \"Hush,\" said the leader, \"he is a representative of the foreign press, a newspaper reporter.\"  \"Your pardon,\" said the secretary. \"I took you by your dress for a prince. A representative of the great and enlightened press of the Allies, I presume. How deeply we admire in Germany the press of England! Let me kiss you.\"  \"Oh, don't trouble,\" I said, \"it's not worth while.\"  \"Say, at least, when you write to your paper, that I offered to kiss you, will you not?\"  Meantime, the leader had finished signing the papers. The secretary took them and swung on his heels with something between a military bow and a drunken swagger. \"Remember, comrade,\" he said in a threatening tone as he passed out, \"you are watched.\"  The Bolshevik leader looked after him with something of a shudder.  \"Excuse me a moment,\" he said, \"while I go and get rid of this tobacco.\"  He got up from his chair and walked away towards the door of an inner room. As he did so, there struck me something strangely familiar in his gait and figure. Conceal it as he might, there was still the stiff wooden movement of a Prussian general beneath his assumed swagger. The poise of his head still seemed to suggest the pointed helmet of the Prussian. I could without effort imagine a military cloak about his shoulders instead of his Bolshevik sheepskin.  Then, all in a moment, as he re-entered the room, I recalled exactly who he was.  \"My friend,\" I said, reaching out my hand, \"pardon me for not knowing you at once. I recognize you now...\"  \"Hush,\" said the Bolshevik. \"Don't speak! I never saw you in my life.\"  \"Nonsense,\" I said, \"I knew you years ago in Canada when you were disguised as a waiter. And you it was who conducted me through Germany two years ago when I made my war visit. You are no more a Bolshevik than I am. You are General Count Boob von Boobenstein.\"  The general sank down in his chair, his face pale beneath its plaster of rouge.  \"Hush!\" he said. \"If they learn it, it is death.\"  \"My dear Boob,\" I said, \"not a word shall pass my lips.\"  The general grasped my hand. \"The true spirit,\" he said, \"the true English comradeship; how deeply we admire it in Germany!\"  \"I am sure you do,\" I answered. \"But tell me, what is the meaning of all this? Why are you a Bolshevik?\"  \"We all are,\" said the count, dropping his assumed rough voice, and speaking in a tone of quiet melancholy. \"It's the only thing to be. But come,\" he added, getting up from his chair, \"I took you once through Berlin in war time. Let me take you out again and show you Berlin under the Bolsheviks.\"  \"I shall be only too happy,\" I said.  \"I shall leave my pistols and knives here,\" said Boobenstein, \"and if you will excuse me I shall change my costume a little. To appear as I am would excite too much enthusiasm. I shall walk out with you in the simple costume of a gentleman. It's a risky thing to do in Berlin, but I'll chance it.\"  The count retired, and presently returned dressed in the quiet bell-shaped purple coat, the simple scarlet tie, the pea-green hat and the white spats that mark the German gentleman all the world over.  \"Bless me, Count,\" I said, \"you look just like Bernstorff.\"  \"Hush,\" said the count. \"Don't mention him. He's here in Berlin.\"  \"What's he doing?\" I asked.  \"He's a Bolshevik; one of our leaders; he's just been elected president of the Scavengers Union. They say he's the very man for it. But come along, and, by the way, when we get into the street talk English and only English. There's getting to be a prejudice here against German.\"  We passed out of the door and through the spacious corridors and down the stairways of the great building. All about were little groups of ferocious looking men, dressed like stage Russians, all chewing tobacco and redolent of alcohol.  \"Who are all these people?\" I said to the count in a low voice.  \"Bolsheviks,\" he whispered. \"At least they aren't really. You see that group in the corner?  \"The ones with the long knives,\" I said.  \"Yes. They are, or at least they were, the orchestra of the Berlin Opera. They are now the Bolshevik Music Commission. They are here this morning to see about getting their second violinist hanged.\"  \"Why not the first?\" I asked.  \"They had him hanged yesterday. Both cases are quite clear.

It had never been even mentioned to him. He knew that his papa had been an Englishman, because his mamma had told him so; but then his papa had died when he was so little a boy that he could not remember very much about him, except that he was big, and had blue eyes and a long mustache, and that it was a splendid thing to be carried around the room on his shoulder. Since his papa's death, Cedric had found out that it was best not to talk to his mamma about him. When his father was ill, Cedric had been sent away, and when he had returned, everything was over; and his mother, who had been very ill, too, was only just beginning to sit in her chair by the window. She was pale and thin, and all the dimples had gone from her pretty face, and her eyes looked large and mournful, and she was dressed in black.  “Dearest,” said Cedric (his papa had called her that always, and so the little boy had learned to say it),--“dearest, is my papa better?”  He felt her arms tremble, and so he turned his curly head and looked in her face. There was something in it that made him feel that he was going to cry.  “Dearest,” he said, “is he well?”  Then suddenly his loving little heart told him that he'd better put both his arms around her neck and kiss her again and again, and keep his soft cheek close to hers; and he did so, and she laid her face on his shoulder and cried bitterly, holding him as if she could never let him go again.  “Yes, he is well,” she sobbed; “he is quite, quite well, but we--we have no one left but each other. No one at all.”  Then, little as he was, he understood that his big, handsome young papa would not come back any more; that he was dead, as he had heard of other people being, although he could not comprehend exactly what strange thing had brought all this sadness about. It was because his mamma always cried when he spoke of his papa that he secretly made up his mind it was better not to speak of him very often to her, and he found out, too, that it was better not to let her sit still and look into the fire or out of the window without moving or talking. He and his mamma knew very few people, and lived what might have been thought very lonely lives, although Cedric did not know it was lonely until he grew older and heard why it was they had no visitors. Then he was told that his mamma was an orphan, and quite alone in the world when his papa had married her. She was very pretty, and had been living as companion to a rich old lady who was not kind to her, and one day Captain Cedric Errol, who was calling at the house, saw her run up the stairs with tears on her eyelashes; and she looked so sweet and innocent and sorrowful that the Captain could not forget her. And after many strange things had happened, they knew each other well and loved each other dearly, and were married, although their marriage brought them the ill-will of several persons. The one who was most angry of all, however, was the Captain's father, who lived in England, and was a very rich and important old nobleman, with a very bad temper and a very violent dislike to America and Americans. He had two sons older than Captain Cedric; and it was the law that the elder of these sons should inherit the family title and estates, which were very rich and splendid; if the eldest son died, the next one would be heir; so, though he was a member of such a great family, there was little chance that Captain Cedric would be very rich himself.  But it so happened that Nature had given to the youngest son gifts which she had not bestowed upon his elder brothers. He had a beautiful face and a fine, strong, graceful figure; he had a bright smile and a sweet, gay voice; he was brave and generous, and had the kindest heart in the world, and seemed to have the power to make every one love him. And it was not so with his elder brothers; neither of them was handsome, or very kind, or clever. When they were boys at Eton, they were not popular; when they were at college, they cared nothing for study, and wasted both time and money, and made few real friends. The old Earl, their father, was constantly disappointed and humiliated by them; his heir was no honor to his noble name, and did not promise to end in being anything but a selfish, wasteful, insignificant man, with no manly or noble qualities. It was very bitter, the old Earl thought, that the son who was only third, and would have only a very small fortune, should be the one who had all the gifts, and all the charms, and all the strength and beauty. Sometimes he almost hated the handsome young man because he seemed to have the good things which should have gone with the stately title and the magnificent estates; and yet, in the depths of his proud, stubborn old heart, he could not help caring very much for his youngest son. It was in one of his fits of petulance that he sent him off to travel in America; he thought he would send him away for a while, so that he should not be made angry by constantly contrasting him with his brothers, who were at that time giving him a great deal of trouble by their wild ways.  But, after about six months, he began to feel lonely, and longed in secret to see his son again, so he wrote to Captain Cedric and ordered him home. The letter he wrote crossed on its way a letter the Captain had just written to his father, telling of his love for the pretty American girl, and of his intended marriage; and when the Earl received that letter he was furiously angry. Bad as his temper was, he had never given way to it in his life as he gave way to it when he read the Captain's letter. His valet, who was in the room when it came, thought his lordship would have a fit of apoplexy, he was so wild with anger. For an hour he raged like a tiger, and then he sat down and wrote to his son, and ordered him never to come near his old home, nor to write to his father or brothers again. He told him he might live as he pleased, and die where he pleased, that he should be cut off from his family forever, and that he need never expect help from his father as long as he lived.  The Captain was very sad when he read the letter; he was very fond of England, and he dearly loved the beautiful home where he had been born; he had even loved his ill-tempered old father, and had sympathized with him in his disappointments; but he knew he need expect no kindness from him in the future. At first he scarcely knew what to do; he had not been brought up to work, and had no business experience, but he had courage and plenty of determination. So he sold his commission in the English army, and after some trouble found a situation in New York, and married. The change from his old life in England was very great, but he was young and happy, and he hoped that hard work would do great things for him in the future. He had a small house on a quiet street, and his little boy was born there, and everything was so gay and cheerful, in a simple way, that he was never sorry for a moment that he had married the rich old lady's pretty companion just because she was so sweet and he loved her and she loved him. She was very sweet, indeed, and her little boy was like both her and his father. Though he was born in so quiet and cheap a little home, it seemed as if there never had been a more fortunate baby. In the first place, he was always well, and so he never gave any one trouble; in the second place, he had so sweet a temper and ways so charming that he was a pleasure to every one; and in the third place, he was so beautiful to look at that he was quite a picture. Instead of being a bald-headed baby, he started in life with a quantity of soft, fine, gold-colored hair, which curled up at the ends, and went into loose rings by the time he was six months old; he had big brown eyes and long eyelashes and a darling little face; he had so strong a back and such splendid sturdy legs, that at nine months he learned suddenly to walk; his manners were so good, for a baby, that it was delightful to make his acquaintance. He seemed to feel that every one was his friend, and when any one spoke to him, when he was in his carriage in the street, he would give the stranger one sweet, serious look with the brown eyes, and then follow it with a lovely, friendly smile; and the consequence was, that there was not a person in the neighborhood of the quiet street where he lived--even to the groceryman at the corner, who was considered the crossest creature alive--who was not pleased to see him and speak to him. And every month of his life he grew handsomer and more interesting.  When he was old enough to walk out with his nurse, dragging a small wagon and wearing a short white kilt skirt, and a big white hat set back on his curly yellow hair, he was so handsome and strong and rosy that he attracted every one's attention, and his nurse would come home and tell his mamma stories of the ladies who had stopped their carriages to look at and speak to him, and of how pleased they were when he talked to them in his cheerful little way, as if he had known them always. His greatest charm was this cheerful, fearless, quaint little way of making friends with people. I think it arose from his having a very confiding nature, and a kind little heart that sympathized with every one, and wished to make every one as comfortable as he liked to be himself. It made him very quick to understand the feelings of those about him. Perhaps this had grown on him, too, because he had lived so much with his father and mother, who were always loving and considerate and tender and well-bred. He had never heard an unkind or uncourteous word spoken at home; he had always been loved and caressed and treated tenderly, and so his childish soul was full of kindness and innocent warm feeling. He had always heard his mamma called by pretty, loving names, and so he used them himself when he"]]]
