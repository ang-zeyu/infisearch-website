[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4776"],["title","Political Ideals (#8)"],["body","cialism, even progressive opinion, in recent years, has been hostile to individual liberty.  Liberty is associated, in the minds of reformers, with _laissez-faire_, the Manchester School, and the exploitation of women and children which resulted from what was euphemistically called \"free competition.\" All these things were evil, and required state interference; in fact, there is need of an immense increase of state action in regard to cognate evils which still exist.  In everything that concerns the economic life of the community, as regards both distribution and conditions of production, what is required is more public control, not less--how much more, I do not profess to know.  Another direction in which there is urgent need of the substitution of law and order for anarchy is international relations.  At present, each sovereign state has complete individual freedom, subject only to the sanction of war.  This individual freedom will have to be curtailed in regard to external relations if wars are ever to cease.  But when we pass outside the sphere of material possessions, we find that the arguments in favor of public control almost entirely disappear.  Religion, to begin with, is recognized as a matter in which the state ought not to interfere.  Whether a man is Christian, Mahometan, or Jew is a question of no public concern, so long as he obeys the laws; and the laws ought to be such as men of all religions can obey.  Yet even here there are limits.  No civilized state would tolerate a religion demanding human sacrifice.  The English in India put an end to suttee, in spite of a fixed principle of non-interference with native religious customs.  Perhaps they were wrong to prevent suttee, yet almost every European would have done the same.  We cannot _effectively_ doubt that such practices ought to be stopped, however we may theorize in favor of religious liberty.  In such cases, the interference with liberty is imposed from without by a higher civilization.  But the more common case, and the more interesting, is when an independent state interferes on behalf of custom against individuals who are feeling their way toward more civilized beliefs and institutions.  \"In New South Wales,\" says Westermarck, \"the first-born of every lubra used to be eaten by the tribe 'as part of a religious ceremony.' In the realm of Khai-muh, in China, according to a native account, it was customary to kill and devour the eldest son alive.  Among certain tribes in British Columbia the first child is often sacrificed to the sun.  The Indians of Florida, according to Le Moyne de Morgues, sacrificed the first-born son to the chief....'\"[4]  [4] _Op cit._, p. 459.  There are pages and pages of such instances.  There is nothing analogous to these practices among ourselves.  When the first-born in Florida was told that his king and country needed him, this was a mere mistake, and with us mistakes of this kind do not occur.  But it is interesting to inquire how these superstitions died out, in such cases, for example, as that of Khai-muh, where foreign compulsion is improbable.  We may surmise that some parents, under the selfish influence of parental affection, were led to doubt whether the sun would really be angry if the eldest child were allowed to live. Such rationalism would be regarded as very dangerous, since it was calculated to damage the harvest.  For generations the opinion would be cherished in secret by a handful of cranks, who would not be able to act upon it.  At last, by concealment or flight, a few parents would save their children from the sacrifice.  Such parents would be regarded as lacking all public spirit, and as willing to endanger the community for their private pleasure.  But gradually it would appear that the state remained intact, and the crops were no worse than in former years.  Then, by a fiction, a child would be deemed to have been sacrificed if it was solemnly dedicated to agriculture or some other work of national importance chosen by the chief.  It would be many generations before the child would be allowed to choose its own occupation after it had grown old enough to know its own tastes and capacities.  And during all those generations, children would be reminded that only an act of grace had allowed them to live at all, and would exist under the shadow of a purely imaginary duty to the state.  The position of those parents who first disbelieved in the utility of infant sacrifice illustrates all the difficulties which arise in connection with the adjustment of individual freedom to public control.  The authorities, believing the sacrifice necessary for the good of the community, were bound to insist upon it; the parents, believing it useless, were equally bound to do everything in their power toward saving the child.  How ought both parties to act in such a case?  The duty of the skeptical parent is plain: to save the child by any possible means, to preach the uselessness of the sacrifice in season and out of season, and to endure patiently whatever penalty the law may indict for evasion.  But the duty of the authorities is far less clear.  So long as they remain firmly persuaded that the universal sacrifice of the first-born is indispensable, they are bound to persecute those who seek to undermine this belief.  But they will, if they are conscientious, very carefully examine the arguments of opponents, and be willing in advance to admit that these arguments _may_ be sound.  They will carefully search their own hearts to see whether hatred of children or pleasure in cruelty has anything to do with their belief.  They will remember that in the past history of Khai-muh there are innumerable instances of beliefs, now known to be false, on account of which those who disagreed with the prevalent view were put to death.  Finally they will reflect that, though errors which are traditional are often wide-spread, new beliefs seldom win acceptance unless they are nearer to the truth than what they replace; and they will conclude that a new belief is probably either an advance, or so unlikely to become common as to be innocuous.  All these considerations will make them hesitate before they resort to punishment.   II  The study of past times and uncivilized races makes it clear beyond question that the customary beliefs of tribes or nations are almost invariably false.  It is difficult to divest ourselves completely of the customary beliefs of our own age and nation, but it is not very difficult to achieve a certain degree of doubt in regard to them.  The Inquisitor who burnt men at the stake was acting with true humanity if all his beliefs were correct; but if they were in error at any point, he was inflicting a wholly unnecessary cruelty.  A good working maxim in such matters is this: Do not trust customary beliefs so far as to perform actions which must be disastrous unless the beliefs in question are wholly true.  The world would be utterly bad, in the opinion of the average Englishman, unless he could say \"Britannia rules the waves\"; in the opinion of the average German, unless he could say \"Deutschland Ã¼ber alles.\" For the sake of these beliefs, they are willing to destroy European civilization.  If the beliefs should happen to be false, their action is regrettable.  One fact which emerges from these considerations is that no obstacle should be placed in the way of thought and its expression, nor yet in the way of statements of fact.  This was formerly common ground among liberal thinkers, though it was never quite realized in the practice of civilized countries.  But it has recently become, throughout Europe, a dangerous paradox, on account of which men suffer imprisonment or starvation.  For this reason it has again become worth stating.  The grounds for it are so evident that I should be ashamed to repeat them if they were not universally ignored.  But in the actual world it is very necessary to repeat them.  To attain complete truth is not given to mortals, but to advance toward it by successive steps is not impossible.  On any matter of general interest, there is usually, in any given community at any given time, a received opinion, which is accepted as a matter of course by all who give no special thought to the matter.  Any questioning of the received opinion rouses hostility, for a number of reasons.  The most important of these is the instinct of conventionality, which exists in all gregarious animals and often leads them to put to death any markedly peculiar member of the herd.  The next most important is the feeling of insecurity aroused by doubt as to the beliefs by which we are in the habit of regulating our lives.  Whoever has tried to explain the philosophy of Berkeley to a plain man will have seen in its unadulterated form the anger aroused by this feeling.  What the plain man derives from Berkeley's philosophy at a first hearing is an uncomfortable suspicion that nothing is solid, so that it is rash to sit on a chair or to expect the floor to sustain us.  Because this suspicion is uncomfortable, it is irritating, except to those who regard the whole argument as merely nonsense.  And in a more or less analogous way any questioning of what has been taken for granted destroys the feeling of standing on solid ground, and produces a condition of bewildered fear.  A third reason which makes men dislike novel opinions is that vested interests are bound up with old beliefs.  The long fight of the church against science, from Giordano Bruno to Darwin, is attributable to this motive among others.  The horror of socialism which existed in the remote past was entirely attributable to this cause.  But it would be a mistake to assume, as is done by those who seek economic motives everywhere, that vested interests are the principal source of anger against novelties in thought.  If this were the case, intellectual progress would be much more rapid than it is.

Billy pointed with his chubby finger. âYonder! The straightest, bestest of all!â  Then Kittyâs heart swelled with pride, too, as she watched a tall man with the other medical officers from the Naval hospital. They were all wonderful, those rhythmical, moving lines of blue, green and khaki, but for the two Carters the heart and soul of it all was the Chief Pharmacistâs Mate they called Dad. They were sure the war could never be won without him.  It was a gala day in Bayport, for every organization had turned out to boost the Community Chest drive. Now a military band was passing, while Billyâs small feet kept time, and scuffed out the soles of his shoes. Kitty had had no idea a six-year-old could wear out so many shoes till she had come home from college a short time ago. Was it really only a few weeks ago? To Kitty it seemed ages, for her whole program of life had been changed in that time.  âThere come the WACs, to give Hitler whacks,â Billy prattled.  âAnd there are the WAVES, our American braves.â  Kitty laughed though her heart was like stone as she repeated the silly rhyme she had made up for Billy at Christmastime when she told him she was going to join the WAVES. How little she had dreamed during that happy vacation that Aunt Nina would be gone in another month, and Billy would have no one to look to except his big sister.  But Kitty couldnât keep back the blinding tears as the WACs and WAVES passed in their trim uniforms, their heads held high, their eyes bright in the knowledge that they were doing their share to help win the war.  âWhen are you going to be a WAVE, Kit, and wear a pretty uniform?â Billy wanted to know.  âIâve decided not to be a WAVE, darling,â Kitty looked straight ahead for fear he would see her tears.  âBut you said you were going to help win the war. Dad says we all must.â  âLook, there come the tanks!â  Billy forgot his puzzlement over his sisterâs change of plans, for the tanks were followed by jeeps, trucks and more lines of marching men and women. At last the parade went on down Bay Street, but Kitty still stood staring at the moving stream of passenger cars in its wake, though she really saw nothing that passed. Somehow she felt cheated, out of it all. After a while an insistent, small hand tugging at hers brought her back to the present.  âArenât we going to see the ducks in the park? You promised.â  âYes, of course. Itâll be fun watching the ducks. Letâs go across to the bay walk.â  They succeeded in crossing the street finally, and hurried down the path curving around the bay shore. In sight of the water Kittyâs spirits always lifted. After all it was for such as Billy that this war was being fought, that they might be free to go to parks and feed ducks, and walk along a bay shore without fear of bombs overhead. As Dad had said, she was really doing more than her bit, giving him a start in life.  Bayshore Park was a lovely spot of green under magnificent moss-draped live oaks. By the time they reached it the parade had broken up and marines, soldiers and sailors were scattered about the green slopes, resting after their long march. At the duck pond Kitty took a small package of bread crumbs for the ducks from her purse and handed them to Billy.  As she sat on a bench near by, her attention was suddenly caught by a group of Canteen workers serving a lunch to the tired soldiers. There were young girls in the Corps, some even younger than she, laughing and talking with the men as they served them coffee, doughnuts and sandwiches from a long table under the trees. How hungry the boys seemed and how appreciative of having some girls to talk to!  Now she recognized one of the girls from near her home over on Palmetto Island. Why Sally Bright was still in high school! How could she get into the Canteen Corps?  âLook, Kitty, the sailor made me a boat!â Again Billyâs voice recalled her from her abstraction.  She discovered a young yeoman squatting by the pond with Billy as they launched a magnolia-leaf boat, with an oak-leaf sail. Billy was gobbling half a sandwich the sailor had given him.  âYou shouldnât have given him your sandwich!â she exclaimed.  The young man sprang to his feet, apparently seeing her for the first time.  âTheyâre so good,â he explained. âI couldnât eat with him looking on.â He had brown eyes that twinkled as he spoke.  âThey do look good,â she admitted.  âLet me get you one? These Canteen girls sure have a genius for making sandwiches.â  âOh, no, donât bother, please. Iâm not hungry.â  âIâve a kid sister whoâs learned lots about good food since sheâs been a Canteen worker.â  âKid sister?â repeated Kitty, puzzled.  He laughed. âWell, sheâs not such a kid after all, I guess. Junior in college.â  âHow can she be a Canteen worker and go to college, too?â  âOh, she has plenty of extra time to get in her Canteen quota of hours. A girl can do Canteen work anywhere she happens to be living.â  âOh, I didnât know that. You mean they donât have to sign up for full time or go away from home to do that work?â  âSure!â  âOh say, why didnât I know about this before?â  The sailorâs face grew serious at the desperate way in which she spoke. âWhy? Would you like to do Canteen work?â  âIâd like to do anything to help.â  âWell, gal, nobodyâs keeping you from it! Thereâs Miss Pearson right over yonder. Iâll introduce you to her. Heard her say sheâs going to start a new nutrition class next week.â  He caught her hand and started across the green to the end of the long table where an efficient-looking woman, in a blue uniform with spotless white collar and cuffs, was pouring coffee. Within a few feet of her the sailor stopped suddenly.  âWhat _is_ your name? After all, introductions are awkward without having the names of both parties.â  They laughed self-consciously.  âKathryn CarterâKitty they call me, of course.â  âIâm Yeoman Brad Mason.â  âI knew you were a yeomanâyour crossed feather insignia,â she told him. âYou see my dadâs been in the Navy ten years.â  His face brightened. âOh, then weâre practically in the same family.
