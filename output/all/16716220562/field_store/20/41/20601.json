M. B.                                 *TO THE READER*   One is informed that novels touching upon the war are no longer read. This, if true, reduces the novelist to the following alternatives:  (1) Writing a novel of some period of the world’s history antecedent to the year nineteen-fourteen.  This is undoubtedly a wide field—the Christian era alone covers twenty centuries—but it has been cultivated by several writers already.  (2) Writing a post-war novel in which it is assumed that the war never happened.  This would make it rather difficult to know what to do with the graves of our dead.  (3) Writing a post-war novel about people who took no part in the war. This would restrict one’s choice of hero, heroine, and characters generally to Certified Lunatics, Convicts in residence, and Conscientious Objectors.  I have therefore decided to take a chance.  The tale which follows is based:  (_a_) Upon a frank admission that there has been a war.  (_b_) Upon a humble belief that the people chiefly worth writing about in these days are those who gave body, soul—everything—to win that war.  That explains my choice of title.                                    *CONTENTS*        I. The Valleys Stand so Thick with Corn      II. Rebellious Marjorie     III. Der Tag      IV. A Tryst       V.

It is not exactly a day of wrath—though one feels that it might easily become one—but it is a time of tribulation for people who do not want to go to church—or, if the worst happens, prefer their religious exercises to be brief and dilute.  But neither brevity nor dilution makes any appeal to my friend Tom Birnie.  \"I am a member,\" he announces, as soon as a quorum has assembled at Sunday breakfast, \"of the old Kirk of Scotland; and I propose to attend service at Doctor Chirnside’s at eleven o’clock.  If any of you would care\"—he addresses a suddenly presented perspective of immaculate partings, bald spots and permanent waves—\"to accompany me, a conveyance will leave here at ten-forty.\"  \"Well, we can’t _all_ get in, that’s plain,\" chirps Miss Joan Dexter hopefully.  (The table is laid for fourteen.)  \"The conveyance,\" continues the inexorable Tom, \"holds twelve inside and four out, not counting the coachman.\"  \"It’s no good, Joan, old fruit,\" observes Master Roy Birnie.  \"We keep a pantechnicon!\"  \"I suppose there’s not a Church of England service within reach?\" asks little Mrs. Pomeroy, rather ingeniously.  \"One’s own Church makes an appeal to one which no other denomination cannot—can—adequately—doesn’t it?\" she concludes, a little uncertain both of her syntax and her host. This is her first visit to Baronrigg.  \"Now she’s done for herself!\" whispers Master Roy into my left ear.  \"I agree with you.  There is an Episcopal Church—Scottish Episcopal, of course—at Fiddrie, three miles from here.  I shall be happy to send you over there this evening at half-past six.  This morning, I know, you will put up with our barbaric Northern rites!\" replies Tom, with what he imagines to be an indulgent smile.  \"I like to see the Baronrigg pew full.\"  And full it is.  The longer I know Tom Birnie, the more I marvel that Diana Carrick married him.  That sentiment is shared by a good many people, but on more abstract grounds than mine.  Tom is a just and considerate landlord, an adequate sportsman, and a good specimen of that class by whose voluntary service this country gets most of its local government done, admirably, for nothing.  But there are certain things against Tom.  In the first place—to quote old Lady Christina Bethune, of Buckholm—\"no one knows who the creature is, or where he came from.\"  This implies nothing worse than that since Tom represents the first generation of Birnies born in this county, his forbears must have been born somewhere else.  In other words—still quoting the same distinguished authority—\"they never existed at all.\"  As a matter of fact and common knowledge, Tom’s grandfather was a minister of the Kirk, somewhere in Perthshire, and his father an enormously successful member of the Scottish Bar, who bought the derelict little estate of Strawick, hard by here, and settled there in the late sixties with the presumptuous, but, I think, excusable, intention of founding a family. Naturally a family which has resided in our county for only forty-seven years can hardly be expected to have drifted, as yet, within the range of Lady Christina’s lorgnette.  Secondly, Tom is a Radical.  We are broad-minded people in this county, and are quite indulgent to persons who disapprove of the leasehold system (which does not obtain in Scotland), or who make excuses for the late Mr. Gladstone, or who are inclined to criticise pheasant preserving. That is the kind of Radicalism which we understand, and are prepared to tolerate.  That was the sort of person Tom’s father was. That is how Tom began.  But of late, it must be confessed, Tom has been going it.  He supports the present Government; he is for reducing the Army and Navy; he has recently helped to abolish our Second Chamber. (That was no great calamity; but he and his friends have omitted to provide us with a substitute.)  He has openly applauded the efforts of a person named George to break up the foundations of our well-tried Social System; while the courses which he advocates with regard to the taxation of Land Values and the treatment of loyal Ulster, surpass belief.  That is what the county has against Tom.  But I am neither a laird nor a farmer, and my indictment against Tom is based on more personal and less venial grounds.  Firstly, he is not human. He is a calculating machine, with about as much passion as a parish pump.  Secondly, he is absolutely destitute of all sense of humour.  And yet Diana married him!  Her own beautiful person exhaled humanity and humour in equal proportions. In all her short life I never knew her fail to understand a fellow-creature, or miss a humorous situation.  Yet she married Tom Birnie. She married Tom Birnie, and she broke off her engagement with Eric Bethune to do it.  I am a humble-minded person, and I never professed to understand any woman—not even my own wife, Diana’s sister—but I wonder, even now, how any girl could have resisted Eric Bethune as he was twenty years ago, or, having got him, have relinquished him in favour of Tom Birnie.  There was something pretty big and tragic behind that broken-off engagement.  My Eve knew what it was—I suppose Diana told her about it—but when I asked for the explanation I was tersely instructed not to be an inquisitive old busybody. As for Eric, he never mentioned the matter to me.  He simply informed me that my services as best man would not be required after all, and that he would be gratified if I would refrain from asking damn silly questions.  (Not that I had asked any.)  Also, that he looked to me to prevent other persons from doing so.  And now Tom Birnie is a baronet and a widower, with a son eighteen years old, and Eric Bethune is still an eligible bachelor of forty-three. And how he hates Tom Birnie!  However, I will introduce Eric presently. First of all, I must get our party to church.                                      *II*   The ancestral hereditary omnibus of the house of Baronrigg deposited us at the kirk door at ten fifty-five precisely, and by the time that the Reverend Doctor Chirnside’s Bible and hymn-book had been set out upon the red velvet cushion of the pulpit by a bulbous old friend of mine named James Dunshie—an octogenarian of austere piety, an infallible authority on dry-fly fishing, and a methodical but impervious drinker—we were all boxed into our places in the private gallery of Baronrigg.  It is less of a gallery than a balcony, and juts out curiously from the side of the little church, with the public gallery running across the end wall on its right, and the minister on its left.  It recedes into a deep alcove, and at the back is a fireplace, in which a fire is always kept burning upon wintry Sundays.  The Baronrigg pew—and, indeed, Baronrigg itself—came into the family from Diana’s side of the house: she brought them to Tom on her marriage. The pew is rich in Carrick associations.  It is reported of old Neil Carrick, the grandfather of Diana and my Eve, that whenever he found himself dissatisfied—a not infrequent occurrence—with the discourse of Doctor Chirnside’s predecessor, it was his habit to rise from his red rep chair in the forefront of the gallery, retire to the back, make up the fire with much clatter of fire-irons, and slumber peacefully before the resulting blaze with his back to the rest of the congregation. But no such licence was permitted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46549"],["title","The Willing Horse: A Novel (#1)"],["body"," us.  We sat austerely in two rows, gazing solemnly at the blank wall opposite us, while Doctor Chirnside worked his will upon his flock.  Doctor Chirnside is a tall, silver-haired, and pugnacious old gentleman of about seventy.  He fears God, and exhibits considerable deference towards Tom Birnie; but he regards the rest of his congregation as dirt.  (At least, that is how we feel in his presence.) This morning he entered the pulpit precisely on the stroke of eleven, in deference to the Laird’s well-known prejudices on the subject of punctuality—besides, I happened to know that he was coming on to lunch at Baronrigg after service—and, having been securely locked in by James Dunshie, adjusted his spectacles and gazed fiercely at some late comers. Then he gave out the opening psalm.  In Craigfoot Parish Church we always sing the opening psalm unaccompanied.  It is true that we possess a small organ, but that instrument is still regarded with such deep suspicion by some of the older members of the congregation that we only employ it to accompany hymns—which, as is well known, have little effect one way or the other upon one’s ultimate salvation.  But we take no risks with the Psalms of David.  These are offered without meretricious trimmings of any kind, save that furnished by the tuning-fork of Andrew Kilninver, our esteemed auctioneer, estate agent, and precentor.  Accordingly, when Doctor Chirnside took up his psalter, the young lady at the organ leaned back nonchalantly; Andrew Kilninver stirred importantly in his seat, tuning-fork in hand; and the choir—highly scented shop-girls and farmers’ daughters, assisted by overheated young men in Sunday \"blacks\" and choker collars—braced themselves with the air of people upon whose shoulders the credit, and maybe redemption, of a whole parish rests.  There is something peculiarly majestic about the manner in which Doctor Chirnside opens his morning service.  I believe that, in his view, the unaccompanied psalm is the one relic of pure orthodoxy preserved by him against the modern passion for hymns, organs, printed prayers, anthems, and \"brighter worship\" generally. That graceless young ruffian, Roy Birnie, gives an imitation of his performance which is celebrated throughout the parish.  It runs something like this:  \"Ha-humm!  Brethren, we will commence the public worrship of God, this Lord’s Day, by singing to His praise part of the Seven Hundred and Forty-Ninth Psalm.  Psalm Seven Hundred and Forty-Nine.  Ha-humm!  The Church is full cold.  Will Mr. John Buncle, of Sandpits, kindly rise in his pew and adjust the open window west of him?  (_Imitation of Mr. John Buncle, petrified with confusion, adjusting the window._)  We will commence at verrse One Hundred and Seventy-Nine:      _I, like a bottle, have been_     _With Thy great maircy filled,_     _Oh, hold me up, hold Thou me up,_     _That I may not be spilled!_  And so on until the end of the Psalm.  Psalm Seven Hundred and Forty-Nine.  The Seven Hundred and Forty-Ninth Psalm.  _Ping_!  _Ping_! _Ping_!  (_The last is supposed to be Kilninver getting to work with his tuning-fork._)  Tune, Winchester, ’_I, like a bottle..._’\"  I am a devout person, but I am afraid it does sound something like that.  However, one feels less inclined to smile when the actual singing of the psalm commences. The Metrical Psalms, sung in unison, without accompaniment, and with strong, rugged voices predominating, are Scottish history.  They bring back the days when people did not sing them in churches, but on hillsides in remote fastnesses, at services conducted by a man with a price on his head, guarded by sentries lying prone upon the skyline, on the look-out for Claverhouse and his troopers.  That is why I, coming of the stock I do, like to hear the opening psalm at Craigfoot.  The start, as a rule, is not all what it might be, for the Scots are a slow-moving race; and naturally it takes a little time to catch up with Andrew Kilninver and his comparatively nimble crew. But about the middle of the second verse we draw together, and the unsophisticated rhymes, firmly welded now with the grand old melody, go rolling upwards and outwards through the open door and windows, over one of the fairest and richest farming districts in the world:      _They drop upon the pastures wide,_       _That do in deserts lie;_     _The little hills on every side_       _Rejoice right pleasantly._     _With flocks the pastures clothed be,_       _The vales with corn are clad;_     _And now they shout and sing to Thee,_       _For Thou hast made them glad._   I am a soldier, and have been a soldier all my life, so when I encounter an assemblage of my fellow countrymen, I naturally scrutinise them from a recruiting sergeant’s point of view.  (At least, Eve always said I did.)  And what a sight that congregation presented!  I have encountered many types in the course of my duty.  I know our own Highlanders; I know the French Zouave regiments; a year or two ago—in nineteen-eleven I think it was—I saw the Prussian Guard march past the Emperor during Grand Manoeuvres; I have ridden with the Canadian North-West Mounted Police; I have seen a Zulu impi on the move in South Africa.  All have their own particular incomparabilities—dash, endurance, resource, initiative—but for sheer physical solidity and fighting possibilities, commend me to the peaceful yeoman-farming stock of the Lowlands of Scotland.  My own regiment is mainly recruited from this district, so perhaps I am prejudiced.  Still, if ever the present era of international restlessness crystallises into something definite; if ever The Day, about which we hear so much and know so little, really arrives—well, I fancy that that heavily-built, round-shouldered throng down there, with their shy, self-conscious faces and their uncomfortable Sunday clothes, will give an account of themselves of which their sonsy, red-cheeked wives and daughters will have no cause to feel ashamed.                                     *III*   After the psalm we settle down to the Doctor’s first prayer.  There are two of these, separated by an entire chapter of the Old Testament—a fairly heavy sandwich, sometimes.  The first prayer lasts a quarter of an hour, the second, eight minutes.  The first prayer takes the form of an interview between Doctor Chirnside and his Maker—an interview so confidential in character and of a theological atmosphere so rarefied that few of us are able to attain to it.  So our attention occasionally drops to lower altitudes.  The second prayer is more adapted to humble intellects. The Doctor refers to it as the Prayer of Intercession. In it he prays for everything and everybody, beginning with the British Empire and ending with the Dorcas Society.  Under the cloak of Intercession, too, he is accustomed, very ingeniously, to introduce, and comment upon, topics of current interest.  Occasionally he springs upon us a genuine and delightful surprise.  The parish still remembers the Sunday morning in eighteen-ninety-four upon which the Doctor, in his customary intercession for the Royal Family, got in twenty-four hours ahead of Monday’s _Scotsman_ by concluding his orison: \"And we invoke Thy special blessing, O Lord, upon the infant son (and ultimate heir to the Throne of this country) born, _as Thou knowest, Lord_, to Her Majesty’s grandchildren, the Duke and Duchess of York, at an early hour this morning!\"  But the first prayer, as already indicated, holds no surprises.  I am therefore accustomed to devote this period to a detailed inspection of the congregation below—an occupation which has the special merit of being compatible with an attitude of profound devotion.  Perhaps I ought to explain how it is that I, a mere visitor, should take such a deep interest in Craigfoot and its associations.  The fact is, I am no visitor.  I was born here, not ten miles away, at The Heughs, a little manor among the foothills, where my brother Walter and his lusty family still flourish.  As a younger son I was destined from birth for the Army; but by the time I had passed into Sandhurst, and on to the lordly exile of our Army in India, I knew every acre of the district.  I had tumbled into burns and been kicked off ponies all over the county. I knew everybody who lived there, from our local overlord, the Earl of Eskerley, down to Bob Reid, the signal porter at the railway station—who, being well aware that I went fishing every Wednesday at Burling, two stations up the line, was accustomed on those occasions to refuse right of way to the morning train, palpitating for its connection with the junction ten miles distant, until my tardy bicycle swept round the curve of the road and deposited me panting on the platform.  Inevitably, the day came when I fell in love—with Eve.  That was no novelty for Eve; for she and her elder sister, Diana, had most of us on a string in those days.  Baronrigg was the lodestone of every young spark in the county, except during those dismal months in summer when our twin divinities were spirited away to London for the season.  Some were able to follow them there; but I was not.  Neither was Eric Bethune. Regimental duty forbade, though we did what we could with the generous leave available in the early nineties.  Ultimately, I was taken and Eric was left. Why Eve took me I have never known.  I was only an infantry subaltern, and a younger son into the bargain.  But she picked me out from the crowd, and waited for me, bless her! for seven years.  My theory was, and is, that a woman only marries a man for one of two reasons—either because he gives her \"a thrill,\" or because she thinks he requires taking care of.  There was no doubting Eve’s reason for marrying me.  She took care of me for one rapturous year; and then she left me, and took her baby with her.  To-day both lie in the private burial-ground of Baronrigg. That is why I always accept Tom’s annual invitation to stay there at Easter,"]]]
