By the evening of August 3d, therefore, August Bank Holiday, and a day of serene and cloudless beauty, the Admiralty was able to announce that the entire navy had been placed upon a war footing, the mobilization having been completed in all respects by {13} 4 o'clock in the morning. This was the position when, in a House of Commons charged with emotions tenser than any man remembered, Sir Edward Grey rose to explain the situation and the attitude of the Government, for which he desired the country's mandate.  Beginning by assuring the House that the Government and himself had worked \"with all the earnestness in our power to preserve peace,\" he went on to deal with the British obligations toward her friends in the Entente--making it clear that the country was not bound, by any secret treaty, to provide armed assistance.  That was but a small matter, however, and what had to be determined was our moral position in the circumstances that had arisen.  Dealing first with naval matters, Sir Edward Grey pointed out that, the French Fleet being in the Mediterranean, her northern and western coasts--a tribute to her confidence in ourselves--were left absolutely unprotected; while, in the Mediterranean, should the French Fleet have to be withdrawn for vital purposes elsewhere, we ourselves had not then a fleet strong enough to meet all possible hostile combinations.  Under those conditions, and with a German declaration of war upon her probably the question of a few hours, it had obviously been our bounden duty to make our position clear toward France; and this had been done on the previous afternoon.  Subject to the support of Parliament, the British Government had promised that, if the German Fleet should come into the Channel, or through the North Sea, to undertake hostile operations against the French coast or shipping, the British Fleet would give to the {14} French all the protection in its power.  Just before coming to the House, Sir Edward Grey added, he had learned that, if we would pledge ourselves to neutrality, Germany would be prepared to agree that its fleet should not attack the northern coast of France. But that, as he said, was a far too narrow engagement.  Even more vital, however, was the question of Belgium's integrity, not only to France and ourselves, but to the whole basis upon which the relations of all civilized Powers had come to rest.  In connection with this, Sir Edward Grey told the House that a personal telegram had just been received by the King, in which the King of Belgium had made a supreme appeal for the diplomatic intervention of Great Britain. Should Belgium be compelled, Sir Edward Grey pointed out, to compromise her neutrality by allowing the passage of foreign troops, whatever might ultimately happen to her, her independence would have gone.  To stand by and see that would, in his opinion--and this was overwhelmingly endorsed both by the House and the country--be \"to sacrifice our respect and good sense and reputation before the world.\"  On the same day, Germany declared war on France, and, on Tuesday, August 4th, Great Britain asked for a definite assurance from Germany that Belgium's refusal to allow the passage of troops through her territory should be respected.  An answer was desired before midnight, but the only German reply was to present our ambassador with his passports, and, before the day ended, Great Britain was at war not only for her life but for the life of civilization.  {15}  And now, as regarded the navy, there occurred a little incident, not without an element in it of the deepest pathos, but demonstrating, at the outset, that one at least of our great naval traditions shone as brightly as ever.  For eight years--longer than any other living admiral--Sir George Callaghan had been afloat in various responsible commands; and, in 1911, he had become Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet.  Its efficiency as an instrument was due in no small measure to his personal thoroughness and enthusiasm; and the mingled feelings of pride, confidence, and anxiety, with which he had led it to its war stations, can readily be imagined.  At last he was to see in action, under his very eyes, that splendid weapon, for which he had so long been responsible.  But it was not to be.  Just as in most recent naval campaigns conducted by other countries, it had been considered advisable for the leader in war to have come fresh from staff work at headquarters, so it had been felt in England that the admiral commanding the Fleet in action must be not only a sea-officer of high standing, but one with a more intimate knowledge of the general strategical position than it had been possible for an officer so long afloat to acquire.  It was for such reasons that Admiral Sampson had been placed in charge of the American Fleet in the Spanish-American War, and Admiral Togo by the Japanese Government in the Japanese War with Russia, and, for similar considerations, it had been decided to appoint Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, still young as admirals went, to the command of the Grand Fleet.  {16}  As a former Director of Ordnance and Torpedoes, and thus familiar with every branch of munitionment; as a former Third Sea Lord in control of ship-building and equipment; and, as Second Sea Lord, responsible not only for _personnel_ but familiar, as Deputy for the First Sea Lord, with all questions of strategy, Admiral Jellicoe, apart from his personal qualities, had had unique opportunities of studying the whole naval problem from every possible standpoint.  He had proved himself in addition, during naval manoeuvres, a tactical leader of the highest order; and he was already due, later in the year, to succeed Sir George Callaghan in command of the Home Fleets.  It was therefore decided--not without considerable personal reluctance on the part of Admiral Jellicoe himself--that he should at once replace Sir George Callaghan on board the fleet-flagship _Iron Duke_; and nothing could have been more typical of naval _esprit de corps_ and the subservience of even the most illustrious officer to the interests of the whole service than that this incident took place without a trace of bitterness or the slightest personal jealousy.  Even so, five years after Trafalgar, having never been allowed to set foot again on English soil, Collingwood had died in his cabin, content that in his long sea-exile he had served his country; and even so, having carried upon his shoulders perhaps the heaviest individual responsibilities of the war, Jellicoe himself, at the end of 1917, walked quietly out of the Admiralty to hang pictures at home.  Born on December 5, 1859, Sir John Jellicoe was in his fifty-fifth year when he stepped on board the {17} _Iron Duke_ as admiralissimo of the Grand Fleet.  The son of a well-known captain in the mercantile marine, who lived long enough, as it is pleasant to remember, to witness his son's success, he was also related ancestrally to that Admiral Patton, who had been Second Sea Lord at the time of Trafalgar; while, in Lady Jellicoe, daughter of the late Sir Charles Cayzer, one of the Directors of the Clan Line of Steamships, he had formed, on his marriage, yet further connections with the sea.  After a few years at a private school at Rottingdean, he had entered the _Britannia_ as a cadet in 1872, and, from the first, seems without effort to have made the fullest use of his opportunities.  Passing out of the _Britannia_, the head of his year, with every possible prize that could be taken, he had qualified--again with three first prizes--as sub-lieutenant in 1878, being appointed a full lieutenant three years later, with three first-class certificates.  Two years after this, he had taken part in the Egyptian campaign, obtaining the silver medal for the expedition, and also the Khedive's Bronze Star.  Returning to Greenwich for a course in gunnery, he had obtained the Â£80 prize for gunnery lieutenants, and, soon afterward, had been appointed a Junior Staff Officer at the _Excellent_ School of Gunnery at Portsmouth; and it was here that he had come into contact, and begun a lifelong friendship, with the greatest naval genius of modern times, then plain Captain Fisher, and scarcely known outside the service.  It was while still a lieutenant that, in 1886, he had received the Board of Trade Medal for gallantry {18} in a forlorn attempt--during which he was himself shipwrecked--to save a stranded crew near Gibraltar.  Becoming a commander in 1891, he had been appointed to Sir George Tryon's flagship, the ill-fated _Victoria_, afterward to be sunk during manoeuvres--Commander Jellicoe himself, ill in his cabin at the moment, having the narrowest escape from drowning.  Six years later, he had become a captain, joining Sir Edward Seymour's flagship, the _Centurion_, on the China Station; and it was in China that, three years afterward, he had seen his next active service during the Boxer Rebellion.  In this he had been Chief Staff Officer to Sir Edward Seymour, who commanded the Naval Brigade; and, at the Battle of Pietsang, on June 21, 1900, he had been very severely wounded.  Happily he had recovered, receiving for his services the Companionship of the Bath, and, four years later, had found himself at the Admiralty as Director of Naval Ordnance--a position that he had held during the revolution produced by the appearance of the first British _dreadnought_.  He had also been largely responsible for the immense improvement in our gunnery, associated with the name of Admiral Sir Percy Scott.  In 1907 Captain Jellicoe had been promoted to the rank of Rear-Admiral, being appointed to a command in the Atlantic Fleet a little later in the same year.  In 1908 he had become one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty and Controller of the Navy, and, two years afterward, he had reached the vice-admirals' list and had succeeded to the command of the Atlantic Fleet."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47248"],["title","The Heroic Record of the British Navy: A Short History of the Naval War, (#6)"],["body","1911, having already been made a K.C.V.O., he had been {19} honoured with a K.C.B. at the coronation of King George V, and, in 1912, after a short spell of service in command of the Second Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet, he had become Second Sea Lord, the position he was holding on the outbreak of war.  Such were the qualifications of the man in whose hands, on that fateful fourth of August, rested more heavily than in those of any other the destiny of our empire and of mankind.  Had they proved inadequate, it is no exaggeration to say that the sun of freedom would have set for both.  That they were not so is common knowledge, and the fullest justification of those who had believed in them--chief among whom was that masterful administrator, who had changed the whole aspect of our naval strategy.  Rugged of face, with hosts of detractors, and, at this time, well over seventy years of age; a prey to moods, with some defects of his qualities, and a mind too often intolerant of the weaknesses of others, it was to Lord Fisher of Kilverstone, more than to any single living man, that the navy of August 4th owed its strength.  Lacking the hereditary sea-influences so strong in Sir John Jellicoe, and with none of the powerful encouragement that he himself had bestowed upon the younger admiral, Lord Fisher had risen to power by sheer mental ability united with an extraordinary force of character; although full credit must be given to Mr. Balfour who, as Prime Minister in 1902, gave Sir John Fisher, as he then was, the fullest scope for his genius.  These had included changes so radical and far-reaching, in almost every branch of naval {20} administration, that it would be impossible here to recapitulate them; and they are already familiar to most people. Briefly, they had amounted, first, to a drastic redistribution of our whole naval forces, including the partial absorption of the Mediterranean Fleet, hitherto our strongest command, into an enormously powerful force in the home seas always ready for war; the disestablishment of overseas squadrons of no strategical importance; the remorseless scrapping of many old ships that were doing little else than eating up money; and the reduction of distant dockyards that had long ceased to have any potential significance.  Hand in hand with all this, a revision of the entire system of naval education had been undertaken; the Royal Fleet Reserve had been strengthened by the inclusion of a number of seamen who had had five or more years' training; and from these were to be drawn the balance crews that, in time of war, were to bring the vessels of the Second Fleet up to their full complement.  It had further become clear, both from the lessons learned in the naval actions between Russia and Japan, and in the strong bid for an overpowering fleet then being made by Germany, that new developments in the matter of design were a problem of the most serious urgency.  It had accordingly been decided to replace the very large number of differing vessels, of which the navy then consisted, by a few definite classes, each designed to fulfil in war some clearly thought-out tactical purpose; and, at the same time, in absolute secrecy, the first of the great British dreadnoughts had been laid down.  {21}  This had not only compelled an immediate response in every navy throughout the world, but had once more secured for us the margin of vital security that had seriously been encroached upon before these reforms were initiated.  That in spite of changes of Government and the natural reluctance of the nation, in view of social necessities, to increase its naval expenditure, Lord Fisher had succeeded in carrying through his programme, was the best evidence of his strength; and men of all parties had become increasingly united in endorsing the general wisdom of his attitude.  So swift, even since then, however, had been the advance in naval construction that, when Sir John Jellicoe stepped on board the _Iron Duke_, the first of the dreadnoughts was almost obsolete.  Itself since outstripped by the ships of the _Queen Elizabeth_ class, when war was declared on August 4th, the _Iron Duke_, as regarded battleships, was perhaps the flower of the British Navy.  In full commission displacing 27,000 tons, and costing more than Â£2,000,000 to build, she had attained on trial, in spite of her enormous armament, a speed of no less than 22 knots.  Each of her large guns, of which she carried ten, so arranged as to be able to fire on each broadside, was capable of hurling a shell from twenty to twenty-five miles, during which it would rise far higher than Mont Blanc; and, besides these, she had a dozen 6-inch guns with which to repel possible destroyer attacks.  Her armour at the water-line was twelve inches thick; she was fitted with four submerged torpedo-tubes, and carried on board three thousand tons of fuel {22} and a complement of over a thousand officers and men.  No less powerful, though not so heavily armoured, and capable of a speed when pressed, of about thirty knots an hour, was the _Lion_, the flagship of the battle-cruisers, of whom Sir David Beatty was in command.  She, too, carried ten 13.5-inch guns, with sixteen smaller quick-firing guns, and two submerged torpedo-tubes.  Typical of yet another class was the since famous _Arethusa_ flying the pennant of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, as he then was--a light armoured cruiser, or, in Mr. Churchill's phrase, \"a destroyer of destroyers,\" displacing a little less than 4,000 tons, but capable of a speed, when pressed, approaching forty knots.  Lastly should be mentioned the _L_ class, then the latest of our destroyers, consuming oil fuel only--those antennÃ¦ of the Fleet, as fast as an express train, and the very incarnation of vigilance and daring.  Such then was the navy in which on August 3d, speaking in that breathless House of Commons, Sir Edward Grey had said that those responsible for it had the completest confidence.  To it had been added, on the outbreak of war, a couple of battleships that had just been completed for Turkey and two destroyer-leaders, built for Chile, that had been purchased from her by arrangement.  As the child of the cockle-ships that Alfred had beaten the Danes with, that had won the Battle of Sluys for Edward III; as the offspring of the fleets of Drake or even of Nelson, its least unit would have defied belief.  But it was of the same family, legitimately descended, and with the {23} old names scattered amongst its children.  _Bellerophon_, _St. George_, _TÃ©mÃ©raire_, its history was implicit in its roll call; while the dead animals stood re-invoked upon the prows that bore their legends. Collingwood, Benbow, St. Vincent; Albemarle, Cochrane, Hawke--they were at war for England if only as words.  But did they live again in the men that hailed them?  Well, the nation believed so, and, in that dark hour, this was the sheet-anchor of its hope.  In the words of the King to Sir John Jellicoe, it sent them the full assurance of its confidence that they would \"prove once again the true shield of Britain and of her Empire in the hour of trial.\"     {24}  CHAPTER II  THE BATTLE OF THE BIGHT  In his speech of August 3d in the House of Commons, Sir Edward Grey told his listeners that we had incurred no obligations to help France either by land or sea.  In view not less, however, of the increasing difficulties of our diplomatic relations with Germany than of the spontaneous friendship that had been growing between ourselves and our French neighbours, the question of coÃ¶peration with the latter, in certain eventualities, had inevitably arisen and been discussed.  It had also been pointed out that unless some conversations were to take place between the naval and military experts of both countries--unless some definite lines were laid down as to the methods by which each country was to help the other--such coÃ¶peration, even if desired, would almost certainly be fruitless.  At the same time, in a letter written on November 22, 1912, to the French ambassador, Sir Edward Grey had made it clear that these discussions between their respective experts did not commit either Government to a specified course of action \"in a contingency which has not yet arisen and may never arise.\"  When the contingency arose, however, the plans were there; and the mobilization and transport to {25} France of our Expeditionary Force will remain on record as one of the most efficient military operations ever undertaken by any country.  Second only to the rapidity and completeness with which the navy took command of the sea, were the speed and secrecy with which those first divisions were conveyed across the Channel.  That in mere numbers they seem in retrospect to have been almost ridiculously inadequate is merely a measure of the colossal proportions that the war on land afterward assumed.  Small as that army was, however, it was the largest force that we had ever sent oversea as a single undertaking; and it must be borne in mind that, in all probability, it was the most highly trained then in existence, and that its presence in France had both moral and material effects of almost incalculable importance.  Nobody who lived, or was staying, near any of our great southern railway lines during those early days of August will ever forget the emotions roused by that endless series of troop trains, passing with such precision day and night; and of the feelings produced in France by this visible pledge of our friendship there was instant and abundant evidence.  Between August 9th and August 23d five Divisions of Infantry and two Cavalry Divisions were safely landed in France; and when it is remembered what a single division consists of some idea may be obtained of what that accomplishment meant.  Apart from the Headquarters' Staff with a _personnel_ of 82, requiring 54 horses, 2 wagons, and 5 motor-cars, it embraced three Infantry Brigades, Headquarters'"]]]
