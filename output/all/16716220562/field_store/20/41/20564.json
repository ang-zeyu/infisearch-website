How we ever developed into the finest hospital unit in the forces none of us to this day knows—and none but ourselves suspects it yet.  We had, and have still, one outstanding feature—a sort of native modesty.  Whatever in this chronicle savours of egotism is merely the love of truth which cannot be suppressed.  And then, one eventful day, the surgeon-general came to inspect us.  He seemed pleased with us.  Presently he passed into the colonel’s tent, and they had a long and secret conference together.  Finally the pair emerged again.  \"What about your horses?\" the general queried.  The horses had been our greatest worry. They came on a different boat, and the two best were missing or stolen.  Once Sergeant Honk discovered them in the lines of another unit, but was indiscreet enough to proclaim his belief to the sergeant-major of that unit.  When we hurried down to get them they were gone.  No one there had ever heard of a horse of the colour or design which we described.  We were discouraged, and in our despair turned to the senior major, who was a great horseman and knew the tricks of the soldier horse-thief.  \"Don’t get excited,\" he said reassuringly. \"They’ve only hidden away the horses in a tent, after you chumps recognised them. To-morrow, when they are not suspicious, I’ll go down and get them.\"  And on the morrow _mirabile dictu_ he secured them both.  So the colonel answered: \"The horses are here, and ready, sir.\"  Ready for what?  There was a tenseness in the air—a sense of mystery that could not be explained.  We listened again, but could only catch scraps of the conversation, such as \"Transport officer,\" \"Nine a.m.\" \"Don’t take the mess tent or any tents but hospital marquees.\"  Something was brewing and brewing very fast.  At length the colonel saluted, and the general left.  \"What news, Colonel?\", we cried breathlessly, as soon as discretion allowed.  And he let fall these magic words:  \"We are under orders to move.  We shall be the first Canadians in France!\"                                  *CHAPTER III*   It was exactly 10 p.m. as Bill Barker and Huxford, with the heavy team and wagon, drove up to the colonel’s tent.  \"Do you think you can find your way to Southampton in the dark?\" the colonel asked Barker somewhat anxiously.  \"Yes, sir.  I’ve never been lost in my life—sober.\"  The afterthought was delivered with a reminiscent grin.  \"Remember, no ’booze’ until the horses are safely in the town; and a glass of beer will be quite enough even then,\" the colonel admonished him.  \"Never fear, sir,\" Bill replied, as he saluted.  With a last long look at the camp he said: \"Good-night, sir,\" and the horses started down the muddy road.  Why we should still have any affection for that camp in which none of us ever wore a dry stitch of clothes or knew a moment’s comfort, is merely another illustration of the perversity of human nature.  Like Bill Sikes’ dog, our love is stronger than our common sense.  For a moment we stood watching the team pass down through the lines toward the unknown south, and then we turned in to sleep.  At 3 a.m. our camp was all astir, and the dull yellow glow of candles and lanterns shining through the tents dotted the plain.  Here and there brighter lights flitted to and fro, as the men proceeded rapidly with the work of packing up.  And what a medley of goods there was! Blankets and rubber sheets were folded neatly into their canvas covers; stoves and pots and pans were crated; boxes of cheese, jam and bully-beef, together with bags of bread were carried out of the tents into the open. At one side stood large boxes of medicines, beds, mattresses, portable folding tables and chairs, and a hundred other varieties of hospital necessaries, all packed and ready for transport.  By 9 a.m. the motor lorries commenced to arrive.  How the boys worked that morning! The pile of forty tons of goods which represented our home, and soon would be the home of many others, sick and wounded, melted away before their united effort.  We had come to Salisbury Plain in the rain; it was but fitting that we should leave in a similar downpour.  We did!  The soldier is a strange creature; a migratory animal whose chief delight in life is moving.  Put him in one place for months, be it ever so cheery and comfortable—he frets like a restless steed; but give him the rein, permit him to go, he cares not whither—he is happy.  It may be from sunshine to shadow; it may be from château to trench; it may be from heaven to hell—he cares not if he but moves, and, moving, he will whistle or sing his delight.  The road was lined with envious Tommies who came to see us start.  \"Yer colonel muster had _some_ pull with Kitch’ner t’ git ye away so soon,\" said one of the envious to Tim, the colonel’s batman.  Tim was quite the most unique of all our motley tribe.  He was born in Ireland, educated (or rather remained uneducated) in the Southern States, and for the past ten years had lived in Canada.  He was a faithful servant, true to his master and to all his friends.  Like many another \"original,\" he was permitted to take liberties which shocked all sense of military discipline, as well as every other sense; but he amused us and was forgiven.  He was a prize fighter, too, of no mean ability, and carried the scars of many a hard-fought battle.  No other being in the world used a dialect like Tim’s.  It was a language all his own, and negroid in character.  \"Pull wit’ Kitch’ner!\" he replied disdainfully. \"Wit George hisself, ye means.  D’ye s’pose my kernel hobnobs wit’ anyt’ing lessen royalty?  De king sent fer him, an’ he goed to Lunnon a’ purpose.\"  \"’Wot is yer Majesty’s command?’ sez de kernel.  \"’Kernel,’ sez he, ’when I seed yer men on p’rade las’ Sunday, I turned to Lord Kitch’ner an’ sez: \"Kitch’ner, it ain’t right t’ keep men as good as dat in England; dere place is at de front!\"’\"  \"You was sure needed there,\" Tim’s vis-à-vis interjected sarcastically; \"good thick-headed fellers t’ stop a bullet.\"  Tim ignored the remark, and continued:  \"So he sez, ’Kernel, yer unit ’ull be de first t’ leave fer France, an’ good luck t’ ye!’  Wit dat de kernel comed back, an’ now we’re goin’ to see de Pea-jammers.\"  \"Wot’s them?\" the other growlingly inquired.  \"Don’t ye know wot Pea-jammers is yet? Ye muster bin eddicated in night school. Pea-jammers is Frenchmen.\"  By what process of exclusion Tim had arrived at this strange decision with reference to the French, none but himself knew; and he never by any chance alluded to them otherwise.  \"All in, men!\" shouted the sergeant-major, and each man scrambled to his allotted place.  To look at the rough exterior of our men one would not suppose that music lurked within their breasts—nothing more unlikely seemed probable; and yet, listen to the vibrant harmony of their chorus as they sit upon their bags and boxes!  It rolls in melodious waves over the camp, and crowds of soldiers come running toward the road to listen.  Oh, you may be sure they had their good points, those lads of ours—so many good points, too!  The lorries started, and the boys lifted their voices to the strains of \"Good-bye, Dolly, I Must Leave You.\"  The little crowd which lined the road on either side raised their caps and gave three cheers in kindly token of farewell.  As we looked back upon those stalwart soldier-boys, many a wistful glance was cast toward us, and many a longing eye followed the trail of our caravan.  Night had fallen before our train puffed noisily into the railway sheds at Southampton. How hungry we were!  And the sight of the crowded buffet and its odour of steaming coffee gave us a thrill of expectant delight.  There are times in life when it takes so little to please or interest one.  In the ornate grandeur of a metropolitan hotel such coffee and cake as we received that night would have called forth a clamour of protest; but in the rough interior of a dockyard shed no palatial surroundings mar the simple pleasures of the soul.  What delicious cheese our quartermaster produced out of a mud-covered box, and how splendidly crisp the hard-tack, as we crunched it with hungry teeth! Seated on our bags and boxes, we feasted as none but hungry soldiers can, and the murky coffee turned into nectar as it touched our lips.  Through the big doorway, too, the eye could feast on the towering side of the ship which was so soon to take us to our great adventure, as she lay snuggled against the quay.  But as we rested there, another train pulled into the sheds and stopped.  The doors were opened from within, and we were surprised to see hundreds of great horses step quietly and solemnly out upon the platform. There was a marvellous dignity about those tall, magnificent animals, with their arched necks and glossy coats.  They drew up upon the platform in long rows like soldiers. There was no neighing, no kicking or baulkiness. They seemed to be impressed with the seriousness of the mission upon which they were sent. A little later, as they passed up the ship’s gangway, and were marched aboard, no regiment ever stepped upon the deck with finer show of discipline.  Our saddle horses were already aboard; but what had become of Barker and the team?  \"Where’s Barker?\" the colonel suddenly demanded.  No one present knew; but, as if in answer to his question, little Huxford came running down the platform.  By the look of distress upon his face we knew something serious had happened.  \"What is it, Huxford?\" cried the colonel, as Huxford approached.  \"Barker’s been arrested, sir, by the military police, and the team are in the detention camp, four miles from here,\" he gasped.  \"Drunk, I suppose?\" the colonel queried angrily.  \"Well, sir, he _had_ had a drink or two, but not till after we got to town,\" Huxford answered reluctantly.  \"I might have guessed as much,\" said the colonel with some bitterness. \"It’s useless to depend upon a man "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46300"],["title","The First Canadians in France (#4)"],["body","drinks.  Here, Fraser,\" he called to Captain Fraser, \"take a taxi and make the camp as quickly as possible.  The boat sails in two hours.  Don’t fail to bring both Barker and the horses—although, Lord knows, Barker would be no great loss.\"  It was characteristic of the colonel that no matter what scrapes we got into, no matter what trouble or humiliation we caused him, he never forsook us.  More than once in the days that were to follow he saved some reckless youth from being taken out at early dawn and shot; not because he did not feel that the punishment was deserved but because his big, kindly heart enwrapped every one of his wayward soldier-boys with a father’s love.  An English regiment was embarking upon the same ship with us.  The donkey engine was busy again hauling their accoutrement and ours aboard. Great cases swung aloft in monotonous yet wonderful array.  Sometimes a wagon was hoisted into the air; again a motor truck was lifted with apparent ease, swayed to and fro for a moment high above our heads, and then descended to the depths below.  By midnight the ship was loaded, but Barker and the team with Huxford and Captain Fraser had not returned.  The transport officer addressed the senior major.  \"I’m sorry,\" he said, \"but I can’t hold the ship more than ten minutes longer.  If your men don’t arrive by that time they’ll have to remain behind.\"  The colonel had gone to meet the train on which the nursing sisters were to arrive. They were coming from London to join us, and were to cross upon the same boat.  But the colonel returned alone.  He was a tall, well-built, handsome man, and his winning smile was most contagious. It took a great deal to ruffle his genial good nature, and his blue-grey eyes were seldom darkened by a frown, but this was a night of unusual worry.  He called out to Captain Burnham:  \"Have your luggage brought ashore, Burnham.  You and I will remain behind to chaperon the nurses.  They can’t possibly make the boat.\"  \"What’s the trouble, sir?\" Burnham inquired, as he descended upon the quay.  \"Was their train late?\"  The colonel laughed a trifle impatiently.  \"No; the train was quite on time, but I have been having a new experience.  I under-estimated the baggage of thirty-five women, that’s all.  It’s astounding!  I don’t know how many trunks each nurse has, but the _tout ensemble_ makes Barnum’s circus train look foolish.  I ventured to remark that we were only going to the war, not touring Europe, but this precipitated such a shower of reproach upon my innocent head that I made no further protest.  I was never able to oust one woman in an argument.  Imagine, then, where I stood with thirty-five!  The trunks, every one of them, will cross with us to-morrow, and if they wish to bring Peter Robinson’s whole shop, you won’t hear a murmur from me!\"  At this moment the sound of horses’ hoofs coming at the gallop broke upon our ears; and Captain Fraser, himself driving the team, with Barker and Huxford clinging to the seat for support, dashed upon the quay.  As the horses pulled up, Barker descended and stood sheepishly awaiting the inevitable.  \"Barker, I’m ashamed of you,\" the colonel said in a tone of stern reproach.  \"You have been the first to bring disgrace upon our unit, and I hope you will be the last.  In future Huxford will have charge of the team.  I shall have something further to say when we reach France.  Get aboard!\"  Barker dropped his eyes during this speech.  \"I’m sorry, sir, I—I didn’t mean to disgrace you, sir!\"  With these words he saluted and shuffled humbly and contritely aboard.  It was many a long day before Barker tasted liquor again.  The colonel’s words burned with a dull glow in his heart, and kindled a spark of manhood there.  Crossing the Channel in those days was not as comparatively safe as it is to-day. Under the water, always prowling about, lurked the German submarines.  Every day reports of their dastardly deeds came to hand. Being torpedoed was not the sort of end which one might wish.  There was no honour or glory in such a death, and besides, the water looked dreary and cold.  In spite of oneself the thought of being blown suddenly into the air recurred occasionally to mind.  It was not that we had any real fear, for any form of death was part of the game of hazard on which we had embarked.  But we stood for some time upon the deck and peered inquisitively into the darkness as we steamed rapidly out into the Channel.  What was the dull glow at some distance ahead?  Perhaps a ship—it was impossible to say.  We looked astern, and there in the darkness we could just discern a ghostly shape which followed in our wake, and, hour by hour, ahead or behind, these two mysterious phantoms followed or led our every turn.  Dawn was breaking; the hazy shapes became more real.  Slowly the daylight pierced the mist, and there revealed to our astonished gaze, were two sturdy little torpedo boat destroyers.  It was a part of that marvellous British navy which never sleeps by night or day.  What a sense of security those two destroyers gave us!  The mist closed round us again, and hid them from our view, but ever and anon the roar of our siren broke the silence and presently, close by, a sharp answering blast told us that our guardians were near.  By and by the fog closed round about us so densely that further progress was unsafe, and so the engines were stopped, and for another day and night we remained at sea.                                   *CHAPTER IV*   During the day and a half that we stood out in the Channel fog, wondering whether we should ever reach land, or whether a stray German submarine would send us to a higher sphere, we had plenty of time to look about the ship.  She was an India liner which had been pressed into service as a troop ship; and the Hindu stewards looked after our many wants as only the Oriental can.  What a far-reaching cosmopolitanism emanates from that little land of Britain!  Here were English officers giving orders to the Hindus in their own mysterious tongue; and the deference with which these men obeyed helped us to realise Britain’s greatness.  To conquer a country, tame it, civilise it—sometimes by force—and still retain the love and respect of its inhabitants, is a power given to but few peoples; yet Britons possess it to the full.  On Sunday morning—a bright warm day in early November—our ship steamed slowly into the port of Le Havre.  We lingered a few minutes near a high stone quay.  Close beside us was a Belgian hospital ship, its white and green paint and big red crosses contrasting strangely with our own dull grey. We could see the nurses and medical officers on board ministering to their patients with tender care and solicitude.  We were steaming slowly through a narrow channel between block after block of wharves, where ships unnumbered piled their ocean freight. Finally we emerged into a great basin filled with craft, both large and small, some of which were dismantled.  Across the bay a splendid ocean liner reared her four smokeless funnels toward the sky; she was one of that great fleet of passenger ships, so recently the pride of France, now thrust aside by the stern demands of ruthless war.  At length we docked, and as we stood leaning over the rail, some little children came running down the quay to greet us.  \"_Messieurs!  Messieurs!  Bon jour!_\" they cried; and then for the first time we realised that we were in a foreign land.  _France, la belle France_!  How often have we dreamed of you in better days!  Bright, vivacious France, whose wit and laughter sparkled like champagne, whose joy was ever rampant!  How soon your smiles and tears were to intermingle with our own!  But the soldiers on board had not yet learned to speak in French, and they responded in our own dull tongue: \"Good-day, little girls.  Hello, little boys,\" and they dropped silver coins and pennies on the quay.  The French children had already learned a word or two of English, and they had also discovered that the Tommy understood two very useful French words.  Not to be outdone in courtesy, they flung them up to us in piping chorus: \"Good-night, cigarette, souvenir!\"  How many thousand times we have since heard this same greeting!  It has become the children’s formula, and as a gracious concession to our ignorance of French has met its just reward—in pennies.  Dusk fell before we had completed the unloading of our equipment and had it all stowed away in the _hangar_.  Then we formed up and, with a French boy-scout as guide, started our march toward camp.  The senior major, on his splendid black horse, led the van; the men, contrary to military custom, carrying a Union Jack, followed, and Captain Reggy and I, mounted, brought up the rear.  The first half-mile of our march was uneventful, as there were few people in the streets of the _basse ville_; but as we passed farther up into the city the sidewalks became crowded with spectators.  At first the French mistook us for English soldiers on the march, the sight of whom, while an almost hourly occurrence, was still a matter of keen interest.  But as the crowd, becoming larger and larger, and pushing one another off the sidewalks into the road, caught a glimpse of our shoulder badges marked \"Canada,\" the word was passed from mouth to mouth with lightning-like rapidity, and the excitement became intense.  They broke forth into the wildest cheering and shouted again and again, \"_Les Canadiens!  Vive le Canada!_\" until the clamour was deafening. Men, women and children surrounded us in thousands, laughing, singing and talking, shaking the soldiers by the hand, embracing and even kissing them in the excess of their welcome.  That the boys weren’t always kissed on account of their irresistible beauty may be gathered from this little conversation which took place _en passant_:  \"_Mon Dieu!_\" exclaimed one of the girls to her nearest neighbour, \"why did you kiss that ugly face?\"  \"Because,\""]]]
