Peter and his brethren of the twelve had doubtless all been baptised, and endeavored to lead holy lives during their association with Jesus; yet we find Him, just previous to His ascension on high, telling them, \"Behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. And He led them out as far as to Bethany, and He _lifted up His hands_, and blessed them.\" (Luke 24:49, 50.)  We find a still further explanation of the manner of obtaining this gift and blessing, in the Acts of the Apostles, where He \"commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water, but ye shall be _baptized with the Holy Ghost_ not many days hence.\" (Acts 1:4, 5.)  Turning to the account of the ministry of Philip in Samaria, we find that after the Samaritans had exercised FAITH sufficient to cause them to REPENT, they had been BAPTIZED under the hands of Philip. \"Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John; who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost (for as yet he was fallen upon none of them; only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) Then _laid they their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost_.\" (Acts 8:14-17.)  Paul, writing to Timothy, charged him thus: \"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of hands of the presbytery.\" (I. Tim. 4:14); and again, \"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by putting on of my hands.\" (II. Tim. 1:6.)  We also call the attention of the reader to the account of Paul's visit to the baptized saints of Ephesus, and his inquiry of them: \"Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. * * * Then they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had _laid his hands_ upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them: and they spake with tongues and prophesied.\" (Acts 19:2-5.)  Sufficient has doubtless been said to clearly establish the fact that the gift of the Holy Ghost was formerly obtained by the laying on of the hands of those who held the authority to do so. Nowhere do we find that the order here laid down has been supplanted or annulled. On the contrary, the apostle spoke in the strongest terms against any innovation upon the established forms that Jesus taught them.  Paul, writing to the Galatians, speaks of those who were \"perverting\" the gospel; doubtless teaching that the laying on of hands was not necessary, or else that it was done away with, and says, \"But though we or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.\" (Gal. 1:8.)  The reader has now examined the fourth step for man's advancement in the probation in which he is now living; and in the words of our Savior, \"He that entereth not by the _door_ into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.\" (John 10:1.)  We have traced man from a pre-existent state, before the world began, when he dwelt in the presence of the Father, and of our elder Brother, Jesus, and mingled with the spirits who have or shall come into this sphere of action.  As it is beautifully expressed in one of the songs of Zion:    \"Oh my Father, Thou that dwellest In the high and glorious place! When shall I regain Thy presence, And again behold Thy face? In Thy holy habitation, Did my spirit once reside? In my first primeval childhood, Was I nurtured near Thy side?  For a wise and glorious purpose Thou hast placed me here on earth, And withheld the recollection, Of my former friends and birth; Yet ofttimes a secret something Whisper'd, 'You're a stranger here' And I felt that I had wandered From a more exalted sphere.\"    This is certainly a grander and nobler conception of man's origin that that of some of the would-be philosophers of to-day, who advocate the idea of evolution from a lower scale.  Having described the nature of the duties (to have faith in God and His promises, to repent of his sins, to be baptized for their remission, and to receive the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost) that he must perform in this life to lay a foundation for future exaltation, we now turn to the consideration of man's FUTURE EXISTENCE.  Upon this subject there is a great diversity of opinion among men, and almost every possible conjecture has, from time to time, held the attention of the human family. If we are to judge by the accepted creeds of the Christian world, we find that an almost universal belief exists in future punishment.  We find, also, that the fear of future punishment is used as a mighty power to influence the minds of the people in a religious sense. The fearful horrors of the never-ending punishment of the guilty are portrayed in the liveliest colors from the Christian pulpits of the land. They are so clearly defined, that in many instances we find that the love and justice of God are lost sight of in the description of the fearful character of the punishment He inflicts, not so much upon unbelievers as upon those who reject the creeds, articles of faith and discipline, whereby men seek to \"know God.\"  Let the reader lay aside preconceived notions, tradition and prejudice, and examine this subject with a desire to know the truth.  We shall again refer to holy writ, and ask the candid attention of the reader to the proofs we place before him.  If we had the history of two persons, the one good and the other bad, after they left the earth, or laid down their bodies in death, it would serve as a guide to decide upon the future destiny of the whole human family. Fortunately, there is left upon record such information, and by it we can determine this all-important question.  No one will dispute the assertion that Jesus of Nazareth was appropriately termed the \"Just One,\" a person of pure and holy life.  The confession of guilt by one of the men crucified beside Jesus, is testimony enough to convict him of being a bad man. \"We received the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss\" (Luke 23:41), were the words of the malefactor, thus confessing that death was the proper penalty for the many crimes he was guilty of.  Now, here are two persons who were born upon the earth, lived out a certain number of years, and then laid down their lives, their bodies becoming cold and inanimate in death, while their spirits, freed from their earthly tenements, passed into another stage of existence, leaving their remains to be cared for in the ordinary rites of sepulture.  While suffering the agonies of crucifixion, a conversation was carried on between them, which will serve our purpose in opening up an investigation.  \"And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. And Jesus said unto him, Verily, I say unto thee, to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\" (Luke 23:42, 43.)  The request of the thief was so far favorably looked upon, that he had the promise that he should accompany Jesus to a place which He designated as paradise. He could not have consistently granted him the privilege of entering into His kingdom, when He had replied to Nicodemus: \"Except a man be born of water (baptized) and of the Spirit (received the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost) he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.\" (John 3:5.) The thief, not having attended to these ordinances, could lay no claim to that privilege; but, says Jesus, \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.\"  We are aware that the majority of the Bible-believing world are of the opinion that the thief was permitted to enter heaven, and enjoy the presence of God; but is this idea a correct one? Let us candidly examine it, and see; for upon it hangs a great principle of truth.  After the body of Jesus had lain three days in the tomb, the spirit again entered into it. The angels rolled the stone away from the mouth of the sepulchre, and the resurrected Redeemer of the world walked forth, clothed with an immortal body of flesh and bones.  Mary, who seems to have had some special interest in the Savior, came early to the tomb, and weeping, discovered that the body of her Master was not there. A voice spake to her, saying, \"Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I AM NOT YET ASCENDED TO MY FATHER: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.\" (John 20:16, 17.)  Here we have the assertion of Jesus, Himself, that during the three days immediately subsequent to His crucifixion, while His body lay in the tomb, His spirit did not go into heaven or the presence of His Father. Logically, it must follow, neither did that of the thief. The generally accepted idea, therefore, of the thief being saved, must inevitably fall to the ground. Jesus asserted that \"To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise,\" and upon His return to the earth, He informed Mary that He had not ascended to His Father.  The question naturally arises, where had He been during these three days? We are not left in doubt upon this point, but scripture plainly points out the character of the duties He was called upon to perform, while His body rested in peace in the new-made tomb of Joseph. He to whom Jesus transferred the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and who stood at the head of the twelve apostles, would certainly be accepted as a competent witness in this matter; and, by turning to his epistles, we gain this information: \"For Christ also hath once suffered for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46617"],["title","The Plan of Salvation (#3)"],["body","sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit: by which also He went and PREACHED UNTO THE SPIRITS IN PRISON.\" (I. Peter 3:18, 19.) Here we have an account of what He was doing during the three days absence from the body: preaching \"unto the spirits in prison,\" also a very clear explanation as to where the thief went. It was to a prison world, where he could have an opportunity to hear the Savior preach the gospel of deliverance to the captive spirits, \"which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah.\" (I. Peter 3:20.)  We now understand what Isaiah, the prophet, meant, when speaking of Jesus. He says, \"That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth.\" (Isaiah 49:9.) And again, \"He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the _captives_, and the opening of the _prison to them that are bound_.\" (Isaiah 61:1.) And again, \"To open the blind eyes, to bring out the _prisoners_ from the _prison_, and them that sit in darkness out of the _prison house_.\" (Isaiah 52:7.)  How appropriately do these passages coincide with, and support the assertion of Peter, relative to Jesus preaching to the \"spirits in prison.\" Men, who in the days of the flood failed to obey the commandments of God, and for two thousand long, weary years had suffered the penalty for their wrong doing, had been fulfilling the principle so clearly enunciated by our Savior, when He said, \"Verily, I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\" (Matt. 5:26.) \"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.\" (Luke 12:47, 48.)  With what joy must these long-suffering spirits, held in confinement, have greeted the Redeemer when He appeared and preached to them the glad tidings of great joy, and presented for their acceptance the EVERLASTING GOSPEL! Through its means they could have their prison doors opened, and themselves delivered from the grasp of Lucifer, the son of the morning, who is appropriately described as one who \"made the earth to tremble, and did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that _opened not the house of his prisoners_.\" (Isaiah 14:16, 17.)  How grand and glorious is the plan of salvation that the Creator has ordained for His children, reaching from eternity to eternity, and covering in its details every possible emergency; controlling, guiding and directing their footsteps while in a pre-existent state; teaching them while sojourners upon the earth, and extending beyond the grave into the spirit world, there to cause their hearts to rejoice and gladden under its benign influence, growing and increasing in might and majesty, power and glory, as the ages roll by, until the inspired words of our Divine Master shall be fulfilled: \"Every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess.\"  Well might Jesus say to the apostles just previous to His death, \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the _dead_ shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live * * * Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming in which all that are in the _graves_ shall hear his voice.\" (John 5:25-28.)  Turning again to the epistle of Peter, we find this assertion, \"Who shall give account to him who is ready to judge the quick and the _dead_. For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that _are dead_, that they might be judged according to _men in the flesh_, but live according to God in the spirit.\" (I. Peter 4:5, 6.)  Jesus, upon one occasion, when explaining the gospel to the apostles, said, \"Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, _neither in this world, neither in the world to come_.\" (Matt. 12:32.)  This, in perfect plainness, explains itself to mean, that there is a class of sins that can be forgiven in this world, and a class that cannot; also that there is a class of sins that can be forgiven in the world to come, and a class that cannot.  Peter, speaking of the patriarch David, says, \"For David is not ascended into the heavens.\" (Acts 2:34.) But David himself, knowing full well that the mercy of the Lord endureth forever, says, \"For thou will not leave my soul in hell.\" (Psalm 16:10.) He knew that after he had paid the penalty of the deeds done in the body, there would be a way whereby he might gain a place in the midst of the righteous in the presence of God.  If the present generation desire to know what will be the result of their disobedience to the proclamation of the principles of the gospel, and their contending against the servants of God who proclaim them, let them read what Isaiah says: \"The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage. * * * And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall punish the hosts of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they shall be _gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited_.\" (Isaiah 24:20-22.)  After having waited, perhaps, as long as they did who rejected the word of God in the days of Noah--after having passed through, perchance, thousands of years of punishment, until they have \"paid the uttermost farthing,\" then the gospel will again be presented to them, and \"they will be visited.\" Another opportunity will be given them to hearken unto the truth, but in the meantime, the saints of former and latter days will have advanced in the scale of progression and passed beyond the reach of those who, to-day, reject \"the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized.\" A separation will have taken place, in which there shall be \"weeping and wailing,\" sorrow and mourning, over the neglect to obey the gospel when there was opportunity.  In accordance with divine law, \"they were judged every man _according to their works_\" (Rev. 20:13), not indiscriminately consigning all grades and classes of sinners to the same punishment, and that to continue forever, but meting out judgment according to their works, some with many stripes and some with but few.  Would it not be a libel upon justice, if a judge, presiding over one of our ordinary courts, should award to every criminal brought before him, the same punishment? \"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?\" Certainly the law of poor, weak, mortal man is not superior to that of the Judge of all.  Paul beautifully and aptly expresses the principle in writing to the Corinthians: \"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable\" (I. Cor. 15:19); but knowing that the gospel would be preached to the spirits in prison, and that untold millions of those who failed to accept the gospel here would do so there, he felt to rejoice in his heart instead of being the most miserable of men. He was fully aware that there was but one way to be saved, \"One Lord, one faith, one baptism\" (Eph. 4:5); that it was positively necessary for man to pass through the door to enter into the sheepfold; that the many devices whereby men sought to save themselves must of necessity fail, for \"God's house is a house of order.\" He knew there was _only_ one name under heaven whereby men might be saved; that obedience to this law was a prime necessity to salvation, for \"in vain do ye say, Lord, Lord, and do not the things I command you.\"  Knowing these facts, the life of every good and true man, as was Paul, would be rendered miserable at the thought that so many millions of the human family must irretrievably perish, and be subject to torture throughout all the eternities to come; but understanding the great principle of the mission of our Savior to the prison world, they can rejoice in the fact that the plan of salvation is a complete one. They have hope that, not only in this life, but in the life to come, the gospel will be preached and men be taught its precepts.  We here introduce the evidence of some learned men, who have a reputation for scholarly ability, far and wide.  Professor Taylor Lewis, a prominent English writer, states: \"We are taught that there was a work of Christ in Hades, He descended into Hades; He made proclamation in Hades to those who are there, in ward.\"  Bishop Alford says: \"I understand these words (I. Peter 3:19) to say that our Lord, in His disembodied state, did go to the place of detention of departed spirits, and did there announce His work of redemption; preach salvation in fact, to the disembodied spirits of those who refused to obey the voice of God when the judgment of the flood was hanging over them.\"  Professor A. Hinderkoper, a German writer, says: \"In the second and third centuries _every branch and division of the Christian church_, so far as their records enable us to judge, _believed that Christ preached to the departed spirits _.\" (Haley's _Discrepancies of the Bible_.)  These writers were willing to ignore the teachings of tradition, and let the words of inspired men mean just what they said, without any \"private interpretation.\"  God, being no respecter of persons, it would be manifestly unjust for one portion of the human family to have the privilege of hearing the sound of the gospel in this life, while so great a proportion never hear it, and lie under condemnation from that fact. No; the plan of salvation is complete, and, reaching from our pre-existent state, applies to our present condition, and will extend to the future state, "]]]
