It was a welcome to stir the blood of the coldest, and from that moment we took France to our hearts, as she had taken us, and held her fast.  What did the landing of a mere handful of Canadians mean to France? There weren’t enough of us to be of much importance, compared with the thousands of other British troops which landed daily.  But the French, with their keen sense of appreciation, recognised at once that the advent of this little Canadian band had a broad significance; it meant that in her great struggle for the cause of liberty and humanity France was to be supported not only by Britain but by the far-flung elements of the Empire.  It meant encouragement; it meant success!  And as they shouted \"_Vive le Canada_\" we echoed with a will, \"_Vive la France_.\"  We sang, too, \"God Save the King,\" and \"_La Marseillaise_.\" A few who knew English joined in the first, but \"_La Marseillaise_\" starting by courtesy with us, swelled in a moment into a mighty anthem which swept the city like a storm.  Later, when we followed with \"The Maple Leaf,\" a respectful silence fell upon the throng.  With quick intuition they knew it was a song of home, with which they sympathised, but which they could not understand.  And as the melody concluded we could hear them whispering one to another: \"_Quelle est cette chanson?_\" And we answered in our broken French, \"It is a song of our native land, far, far from here.\"  It was my good fortune during this strange march to ride upon the side close to the curb, while Reggy, in comparative obscurity, rode opposite. Frequently, too, it was my privilege to return the greetings of the dainty French girls who lined the walk and waved their handkerchiefs high above the heads of the crowd in the road.  At last Reggy, trotting along in the shadow, could contain himself no longer.  He burst out:  \"Hang it all, major!  Just my bally luck again; you’re always closer to the girls than I.\"  \"But not closer to their hearts, Reggy dear,\" I interjected soothingly.  \"Small consolation, that, in the present situation,\" Reggy was grumbling, when he was suddenly interrupted by a pretty black-eyed girl who, running alongside his horse, caught him by the hand and forthwith begged a kiss. I believe—or, rather, I hope—Reggy blushed. I should always like to think that at that precise moment Reggy’s sense of modesty came to his rescue.  If it did, however, it vanished again with alarming rapidity.  \"Here’s an embarrassing situation,\" he cried dolefully.  \"Very trying, indeed, to have a pretty girl demand a kiss,\" I laughed.  \"Confound it!\" he returned.  \"That’s not the trouble; but I’m not horseman enough to lean over and get it.\"  There, you see, Reggy in one fell moment had destroyed all my illusions about him. Here was I worrying over his distress and presumed embarrassment, while he, hopeless young scamp that he was, showed actual regret because he couldn’t fall from grace.  \"I would suggest that you dismount,\" I answered, in a spirit of sarcasm.  For a moment I believe this insane thought obsessed him, and then his latent sense of military discipline and dignity saved him. He turned regretfully to the young lady, and pressing her hand warmly—very warmly, I thought—broke forth in schoolboy French:  \"_Merci, cherie!  Mille fois, mille fois_. Another time will have to do.\"  \"_Est-ce-que vous parlez Français, monsieur?_\" she demanded sweetly.  \"Rather rough on your French, Reggy,\" I teased, \"asking you, after that brilliant sortie, if you really speak the language.\"  Reggy appeared hurt.  \"Look at you,\" he cried, \"riding along like a bloated monarch, scooping in the obeisance of the whole kingdom, and because I command the attention—and, I trust, respect—of only one of your subjects, you’re jealous. Out upon you—for shame!\"  All good things come to an end at last. For half an hour we had been princes or kings, drinking in the nectar of adulation in mighty gulps. It turned our heads and made us dizzy, and this feeling of elation lasted long after we had left the crowd behind, and the faint cry of _Vive les Canadiens_ followed us into the darker streets.  We toiled slowly over the cobble stones, up the steep hill, and finally into camp.  The camp commandant came to meet us a few minutes after we arrived.  He was a fine-looking specimen of British officer—tall, athletic, with iron-grey hair and keen blue eyes. He smiled as he greeted us.  \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" he said, as the senior major approached and saluted. \"Where have you all come from?\"  \"Originally from Canada, sir,\" the major replied, \"but recently from Salisbury Plains.\"  \"How interesting,\" he cried in a tone of delighted surprise.  \"I had no idea the Canadians were coming to France so soon.\"  \"Weren’t you expecting us, sir?\" the major ventured.  The commandant laughed good-humouredly. We seemed to amuse him.  \"Well, not exactly,\" he replied; \"but you are quite welcome.  Take those three rows of tents, draw your rations and make yourselves at home.  One of these days orders will come along for you.\"  One of these days!  Well, well!  Was he actually addressing us in that careless and flippant manner, we who had just taken France by storm? Alas! we were not so important after all.  For a full hour we had looked upon ourselves as the whole war, and the rest of the British army as a mere background to our glory.  And now we were told that \"one of these days!\"  It was really too bad.  But still, he was kindly and courteous, and behind those smiling eyes lurked a great sympathy, I am sure, for our little band.  We looked about us and then we understood. There were miles of tents. Regiments of soldiers were marching in and regiments were marching out—the Highland \"kilties\" with their sporrans swaying to and fro in stirring unison.  We heaved a sigh.  It was all too true.  We were only one small cog in the great machine!  But the senior major was elated with a strange and inexplicable emotion. After the commandant had bidden us good-night, he paced back and forth, with his hands behind his back and his head in the air.  He raised his feet high as he walked, and clicked his spurs with the firmness of his tread. Something was effervescing in his mind, and soon would blow his mental cork out.  What was it?  He twirled his moustaches from time to time and smiled a crafty smile.  At last it popped:  \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"that’s one thing which no one can ever take from me!\"  \"What?\" we cried breathlessly.  \"That _I_ was the first officer who ever led a Canadian unit into France!\"  Oh, the supreme egotism and self-love of old bachelorhood!  We turned away without a word, in time to hear little Huxford’s piping voice in ungrammatical query.  \"Did ye had a good time to-night, Bill?\"  And Bill’s reply echoed the sentiments of all our hearts.  \"Did I?\" he cried exultantly.  \"_Some_ class!\"                                   *CHAPTER V*   How it stormed that night!  Thunder, lightning, rain and wind combined in one uproarious elemental war.  It seemed as if no tent on earth could stand the strain.  Once I peeped outside, and in the flashes saw vistas of tents rolling like great white-crested waves on an operatic sea. From time to time the cracking of poles and the dull swish of canvas, blending with the smothered oaths of men beneath, told us that some tent had fallen.  Reggy slept as peacefully as a new-born babe.  Tucked into his canvas sleeping-bag and with a woollen toque pulled well down over his ears, he was oblivious to the storm, and in the faint glimmer of our candle-lantern looked like an Eskimo at rest.  Peg after peg jerked out of the ground, and our tent commenced to rock to and fro in a drunken frenzy.  Would the guard never come to tighten the guys?  They seemed to have forgotten us.  Warmly ensconced in my blankets and half asleep in spite of the noise, I lay and from time to time idly wondered how much longer the tent would stand.  Sometimes I dozed and dreamed of getting up to fix it, and saw myself crawling about in wet pyjamas in the wind and rain. The thought awoke me; the tent was flapping still.  Reggy, as the junior, was in duty bound to right it; but if the storm couldn’t wake him, what could mere man do?  I dozed again and awoke just in time to see the canvas give one last wild gyration.  Then it crashed down upon us.  \"Hi!  What the d——l are you doing now?\"  It was the sleep-saturated voice of Reggy in angry, smothered tones beneath the wreck. For answer to his question, a gust of wind lifted the canvas from his face, and a spurt of rain, with the force of a garden hose, struck him.  \"O Lord!\" he howled.  \"The bally tent’s blown down!\"  Reggy’s perspicacity, while sluggish, was accurate.  \"Get up, you lazy blighter, and lend a hand!\" I shouted between blasts of wind and rain which soaked me through and through.  \"Ugh!  You wouldn’t ask a chap to get up in a storm like this,\" he cried appealingly.  I didn’t.  I merely took the lower end of his sleeping-bag and emptied it, as one would a sack of potatoes, onto the floor.  Reggy emerged like a rumpled blue-bird.  \"Rotten trick, I call that,\" he grumbled, as he scrambled to his feet.  Luckily by this time the guard arrived to help us, and after a long tussle with the ropes, the tent was pitched once more, and we crawled back to bed.  The morning sun rose clear and bright and smiled as if it had no memories of the night before.  Wherever one might look tents lay in heaps upon the ground, but not a breath of wind stirred the fresh cool air. Fainter and more faint from the distance came the weird strain of the bagpipes—a Highland regiment was passing down the hill, starting on that long journey whence all might not return.  Our men had breakfasted and were already at work"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46300"],["title","The First Canadians in France (#6)"],["body"," the fallen tents.  The adjutant emerged from his abode wearing a weary smile—he hadn’t slept much.  \"’What of the night?’\" he cried.  \"The storm has given me an appetite. Where’s breakfast?  I’m as hungry as an R.M.C. cadet.\"  Where indeed was breakfast?  As yet we had no \"mess\"; our goods were still unpacked.  \"There’s a soldiers’ buffet managed by ladies in the cottage yonder,\" said Fraser, pointing to a brick house on the crest of the hill.  Trust Fraser to know where grub abounds!  \"Perhaps I can persuade the little lady of the place...\"  \"You’ll need help,\" Reggy interpolated hastily.  \"Some one with persuasive powers. I’ll go along.\"  Reggy’s eagerness to go suggested other distractions than foraging.  We said we would accompany him—lest he forget.  We entered a long room at the rear of the house, which had been a carpenter’s shop before the war. It was furnished with two long tables, benches, and a large number of kitchen chairs.  The carpenter’s tools hung unused upon the wall. At the farther end of the room several young women and one of maturer years were rapidly cutting up bread and meat for sandwiches, buttering appetising French rolls and placing them all in large baskets.  It looked enough to feed a multitude.  We approached the table.  One young woman looked up, apparently more from courtesy than with any special interest in our arrival, and said: \"Good morning!\"  It was true then; they _were_ English-women. They were as cool—and refreshing—as the air outside.  Reggy saluted gravely.  \"May we have something to eat, please?\" he inquired hesitatingly.  The young woman looked up again, with a surprised smile.  \"But you are not Tommies,\" she replied.  \"No; merely officers, and very hungry ones at that.\"  She looked a trifle perplexed.  \"We don’t serve officers here,\" she asserted.  \"You see, this buffet is meant for Tommies only.\"  Bless their hearts!  Here at least was one place where the officer was discounted, and Tommy was king.  We had been fêted and pampered to such an extent that we had lost sight of the true proportion of things.  Here were women who realised that Tommy is quite as important as his officer, that he is a man and as such has rights.  We honoured the young women who could thus devote themselves to the men who really needed their help most.  But this elevating thought did not appease our hunger in the least.  We still wanted something to eat, and the dainty food before us failed to modify our internal cravings.  \"Couldn’t we have just one bun?\" Reggy coaxed.  The young woman smilingly shook her head.  \"It’s against our rules,\" she replied.  Reggy looked distressed.  We imitated his look with such success that another young woman, who seemed to be the one in authority, came forward and volunteered:  \"If you will step into the house, gentlemen, I shall see what the _concierge_ can do for you there.\"  That we didn’t fall upon her neck in sheer thankfulness speaks well for our self-control. We kept sufficient restraint upon ourselves, however, to merely murmur our gratitude in becoming words.  We explained that we had just arrived, and that our mess was not yet open.  \"Well, well,\" she laughed.  \"Of course, we can’t let you starve, but you really mustn’t eat in here.\"  If the angels in heaven look anything like that sweet young woman as she appeared to us at that moment—well, it’s a great incentive to lead a good life, that’s all.  We were ushered into a quaint French dining-room, furnished with hand-carved mahogany.  That a carpenter should have such exquisite taste surprised us.  We were yet to learn that the artistic sense is a keynote of French character.  The owner of the cottage was away at the war; he was one of the poilus who were then, and are still, upholding the martial traditions of a noble fighting race.  His wife spread a dainty table for us, and we breakfasted for the first time in France.  Our menu consisted of small mackerel, rolls and coffee!  How prosaic it sounds in English!  We shall always remember that _petit dejeuner_ in French: _Petits maqueraux, petits pains et café-au-lait._  What music there is in such a language!  The food itself loses its identity and is transformed into the sustenance of the gods!  Days passed by, but there was no word from our colonel, and no orders came for us to move.  Had they all forgotten us?  Had we by mischance taken the wrong boat and landed in the wrong part of France?  What had become of our colonel and the rest of our unit?  These thoughts perplexed and worried us.  But one day, as we were lunching, a messenger suddenly appeared at the tent door and asked for the senior major.  \"Telegram for you, sir,\" he said.  The major slowly unfolded it, read it as slowly, refolded it and placed it in his pocket without a word.  Could it be from the colonel? If so, where was he?  The major continued his meal.  At last Fraser could bear the suspense no longer.  \"Was that a message from the colonel?\" he inquired anxiously.  \"It was,\" the major replied.  One might have heard the proverbial pin drop—the strain was so intense. Would he never go on?  Were we to hear nothing further?  Fraser ventured again: \"What does he say?\"  The senior major got up and left the tent without a word.  Even after all these months it pains me to record the bitter disappointment of that moment.  All men have their peculiarities—Some are afflicted more than others.  We may forgive, but we cannot always forget.  And yet he had his good points, too; he wasn’t quite all bad. Perhaps Fraser’s question was injudicious; perhaps he hadn’t been deferential enough to his senior officer.  At any rate it was two days later when we first heard the news.  The adjutant, who had been taken into the major’s confidence, whispered the message to us:  \"The colonel is at Boulogne, and orders will be sent us in a few days to join him.  I have been told not to tell you, but I must relieve your anxiety.  Keep it secret!\"  How we loved him for his thoughtfulness! The tension was broken.  We were once more happy and content.  Three days later the order came to move. We were to entrain at midnight, and all day long we were busy packing.  By nine everything was ready. The motor lorries were loaded, and we started our march toward the train.  It was a pitch-black night and rain swept the streets in chilling torrents.  One of the horses of our team had a chafed back and could not be harnessed, so that my horse was selected to take his place.  The wagon was piled high with the kit-bags of the men, and from this elevation one of the orderlies held the halter of the sick horse, which followed behind.  We started down the steep hill from the camp, horses and men alike slipping upon the wet and greasy cobblestones.  Suddenly a slight explosion startled the led horse.  He reared upon his hind legs, jerked the halter from the hand of the orderly and bolted down the hill into the darkness.  Who would dare follow him?  To ride down that incline at any rate faster than a walk was sheer recklessness. Surely no horse or man who attempted to do so would return alive.  But Huxford, putting spurs to his horse, plunged down the hill at breakneck speed, a shower of sparks flying out on either side as the horse’s steel shoes struck the stones.  \"Good God!\" cried Barker; \"he’ll never come back—he’s a dead man!\"  \"Why didn’t he let the horse go?\" cried the senior major anxiously. \"Now we’ve lost two horses and a man.  He doesn’t know the city or where we are going, and even if he gets through alive, he’ll never find us again.\"  \"How could he expect to overtake a run-away horse in a strange city on a night like this?  It’s madness!\" exclaimed the adjutant.  \"He was a fine lad,\" said the quartermaster sadly, as though Huxford were already dead. \"Seems such a pity to lose him.  I didn’t think he had the courage to do it.\"  But war shatters preconceived ideas.  No one can tell which men are brave until the crisis comes.  Those who seem strongest fail; those who seem weakest succeed.  A gloom had been cast over us all.  We despaired of seeing Huxford again—except perhaps to find his mangled body somewhere at the foot of that long hill.  When we reached the bottom he wasn’t there, and we went on despondently for a mile or more, knowing the hopelessness of trying to find him; when suddenly, as we turned a corner, he appeared, still on horseback and leading the runaway.  A cheer from the boys greeted him.  \"Well done, Huxford!\" cried the senior major.  \"We never expected to see you again!\"  \"I couldn’t let him go, sir, ’cause th’ colonel giv’ th’ horses into my charge, an’ he _had_ to be caught.\"  May we all fulfil our duty as faithfully as this lad!  The queer little French train, with its cars marked eight _chevaux_—forty _hommes_ (8 horses—40 men) was waiting at the station when we arrived.  The transport officer had told the senior major not to leave until he had received his papers, but to get the men and horses aboard.  Shortly before midnight all were entrained. The equipment and horses were loaded, but there was no sign of either engine or conductor. We unrolled our sleeping-bags, placed them upon the seats in the compartment coach and fell asleep.  At four a.m. we were awakened by an angry discussion taking place on the train platform.  One voice was French, evidently that of the train conductor; the other was unmistakably that of the senior major. He was talking very loudly:  \"I tell you, you can’t move this train one inch until I get my papers.\"  The reply was in French:  \"_Comprend pas, monsieur!_\"  Evidently he was about to signal the engineer to start.  \"Stop!  I command you to stop!\" shouted the major again.  The Frenchman understood the action, if he failed to understand the words.  \"_Il faut partir tout de suite, monsieur_,\" he replied with respectful firmness, and then, placing the bugle to his lips, he blew a signal to the engineer and the train started.  The major sprang from the platform just in "]]]
