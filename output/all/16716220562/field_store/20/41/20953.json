The moonlight painted her features in sharp outline.  “It’s Lena!” she whispered. “Lena, in civilian clothes!” What did it mean? Had this girl been found out and dismissed from the service?  As if the question had been put directly to her, the shorter of the two girls paused and looked back. Just in time Norma dodged into the shadows.  An inaudible gasp escaped her lips. The other girl was the one from the beauty parlor at the Fort.  As the two girls resumed their march, Norma followed them, without thinking too much about the reason or possible consequence.  At the next corner they turned west on a dark street. Here, on both sides, were auto repair shops and cheap second-hand stores.  Scarcely had Norma rounded this corner when the two girls swung through a door to disappear into a shop that was almost completely dark.  Acting purely on impulse. Norma caught the door before it had completely closed. Pushing it a little farther open she slipped inside and then allowed it to close noiselessly.  At the same instant a thought struck her all in a heap. Lena had a perfect right to dress in civilian clothes on her day off. All WACs have. She, Norma, had chosen to wear her uniform.  “In a way it is a sort of protection,” she had said to Betty.  “Yes, like a nun’s cape and veil,” Betty had laughed.  “Is it a protection?” Norma asked herself now. At first the place seemed completely dark. Then she caught a gleam of light at the far end of the room. She began hearing low voices. The two girls were back there. Someone was with them.  “What a goose I am,” Norma thought. “Lena has a right to dress as she pleases. Nothing unusual has happened. That other girl probably has a friend who works here. They have come here to meet him. I’ll just slip out of the door.”  But she couldn’t. Not just yet. The door was closed and locked. Just a little frightened, she felt for some sort of bolt or spring lock that could be released. There was none.  For the first time in her life she was seized with a feeling very near to panic. She wanted to dash to the heavily shaded windows and pound on them for help. She wanted to scream. And yet she did not dare. Perhaps those people did not know she was there.  “And after all, why should I be afraid?” she asked herself. “This is some sort of a repair shop.” That faint light from the back brought out the looming bulks of cars and trucks. “There’s no law against going into a repair shop, even at night.”  All of a sudden she realized that it was not fear of those who enforce the law that inspired her with fear, but those who hated the law.  “Spies,” she whispered softly.  But were there spies in this city? Perhaps. Who could tell? Spies were everywhere.  Once again she tried the latch, lifting it up and down, pulling at the door without a sound. It was no use. Some mysterious type of lock held the door fast shut.  In the hope of finding a smaller door, she began gliding along the wall. All at once she bumped into something that toppled over to fall with a loud bang.  Like a wild bird in a cage she flew to the door to try the latch with all her strength.  “Who’s there?” came in a hoarse voice.  She neither moved nor spoke.  A minute passed—two—three minutes—or was it an hour? Her heart was beating painfully. She had the sense of someone approaching, yet she neither heard nor saw a moving thing.  Then suddenly she did see it—a groping hand. The flash of light cutting through a spot beside a windowshade revealed it.  A scream was on her lips. And yet she did not scream.  And then the hand gripped her arm.  “What are you doing here?” a voice growled.  She tried to speak, but no words came.  “Oh! You are one of them.” The voice changed suddenly. Now it was low, apologetic. “You are one of them lady soldiers. A WAC they call them, don’t they?”  “Yes. Yes. That’s what I am.” She formed the words but could not say them.  There was no need, for the man went on, “You were perhaps looking for the WAC garage. It is not here. That is another place. You came in—the door locked itself. Is it not so?”  “Yes! Yes! That is it,” she whispered. Lena must not hear her voice or see her face.  “I shall unlock the door. This is all too bad,” said the man who had gripped her arm.  By some magic the door was opened and she stepped out into the night. The light of a car illuminated the man’s face for a second. Then the door slammed shut.  “I’ll know that face if I see it again,” she told herself. She wondered if after all Lena had seen _her_ face—and if she had, what then?  Ten minutes later, panting a little, she entered the hotel, called for her key, then dashed up two flights of stairs to her room.  Having locked and bolted the door, she sank into the chair before her array of pictures.  “Oh, Bill!” she whispered, “I wish I hadn’t come.” She was thinking not alone of Des Moines, but Fort Des Moines, the Army, and all the rest. She was wishing desperately that she might be back with her dad and her dog Spark.  After that she sat looking at her father’s picture. From his square shoulders and his twinkling gray eyes she drew strength. She seemed to feel again his hand on her shoulder as he said in his slow calm voice, “You’re the only boy I’ve got. Thank God they’re giving you a chance. I know you’ll do your duty as a good soldier.”  “No,” she whispered, “I’m not sorry. I’m glad.”  One thing she decided before she fell asleep in that big comfortable bed. This was that she would cease playing the part of an F.B.I. agent and start being a real WAC.  “I’ll put this Lena business out of my life,” she whispered. “This is the end of it forever and ever.”  Did some sprite whisper, “Oh, no, sister! No you won’t!” If so, it was all lost on her, for she had fallen fast asleep. But if there was a sprite hovering about and he did say that, he would have spoken the truth. There are some things that just won’t be put out of our lives.  When she awoke the sun was shining in her window. It was Sunday morning. But she was not thinking of that. Instead, a question had popped into her head. How had that man known she was a WAC? He had not seen her. The place had been completely dark. There could be but one answer—by the sense of feeling. He had gripped her arm. He had recognized the feel of her soft wool WAC uniform. And how had he come to know the feel of fine wool? Here too there could be but one answer—Lena. It was strange.  On the following Monday Norma was asked to take charge of the drilling of her company.  “I realize that this is an unusual request,” the officer in charge said soberly. “But this is an unusual war, and ours an unusual organization. For that reason we must perform unusual tasks.  “We are short of officers. The Army camps are constantly calling for more and more of our workers. They go out in small groups. An officer goes with each group. So now you see how it is.” She smiled. “What do you say?”  “I—I’ll try it.” Norma agreed.  She undertook the task with fear and trembling. It was not so much that she distrusted her own ability. She had been well trained. But how would the other girls take it?  “Some of them are thirty years old. One is a grandmother,” she said to Betty, as she broke the news. “And I am barely old enough to vote.”  “It’s not age that counts,” Betty replied in a tone that carried conviction. “It’s ability and experience. Go in there, old pal, and win. This is war. We all must do our best. And you can bet I’ll be right in there rooting for you.”  “Then—thanks! Oh, thanks!” Norma replied huskily.  All the same, when the time came for her first order: “Company, attention!” her throat was dry and her heart was in her mouth.  There was a surprised look on many faces as they turned about to line up. There was a smile or two, but they were not unkind smiles.  Then a thing happened that broke the tension. An officer of the old school, her father had drilled her in an unusual way. When as a child she stood at attention, he would call: “Hup, two, three.”  Now, in her excitement she called to her company:  “Hup, two, three!”  Then suddenly realizing what she had done, she laughed. And they all laughed with her. The ice was broken.  “Mark time! One! Two! One! Two! March.”  Feet came down with an even thud—thud—and crunch—crunch on the frozen path. The march was on.  Oddly enough, at the first rest period one of the older members said:  “Why not ‘Hup, two, three,’ for us?”  “Sure. That’s the way the soldiers get it. And we’re in the Army now.”  “They’ll call us the Hup company,” someone laughed.  “That will be swell,” exclaimed another. “And that’s what we’ll be, the ‘Hup an’ comin’ Company’.”  And so it came to be.  For two hours Norma put them through their paces. Only once did her attention waver. That was when Lena gave her a long, searching look. “She knows about that night,” she told herself, and all but lost a step.  When at last the tired marchers were once more on their own, many of the girls came forward to congratulate her and tell her how well she had done.  “They are won over. Just wonderful!” Tears of gratitude stood in Norma’s eyes as she reported to her superior.  “These came here for just one purpose,” the Lieutenant said.  “To help win the war.”  “Yes. That’s it. To hasten the end of this terrible affair and to help bring their brothers, sweethearts, and friends back home again.  “So how could they fail to do their best or refuse to respond to the orders of any leader? But you, my child,”—she placed a hand on Norma’s shoulder—“you have real officer’s blood coursing through your veins.”  Norma thanked her, then marched away.  “She spoke wiser than she knew,” Norma thought with a smile. She had not told her that her father had been an officer in the other World War.  But did she really want to become an officer of the WACs? She did not know.  After that the days glided by. Drill was not all there was to their training. Far "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48599"],["title","Norma Kent of the WACS (#7)"],["body","that. The Articles of War were read to them. They studied long hours learning what it meant to be a soldier. They studied military regulations. They took gas mask drill, first aid, and a score of other activities that were likely to fall to the lot of any WAC.  From time to time each girl was assigned to K. P.—Kitchen Police—peeling potatoes, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, dishing up food.  Betty, who was a real student, hated this, for on that day they were excused from study. But Millie, who found study difficult, wished that K. P. came five times a week.  Though Norma had sworn that the spy complex should not tempt her again, strange things happened, and always her mystery-loving mind would ask, “Why? Why?”  There was the time she went with the little Italian girl, Rosa, to visit the airport on their day off. Then, too, Betty more than once tempted her to start spy hunting all over again.  “I won’t!” she told herself. “I won’t! I just won’t!” Positive as she was at the time, Norma did not succeed long in keeping this resolution.  It was really Rosa’s strange and mysterious adventure at the airport that got her going all over again.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER VIII                             ROSA ALMOST FLIES   On the Saturday that Norma and Rosa went to visit the airfield they doffed their uniforms and put on their civies.  “All the same,” Norma said, “we’ll take along our identification cards, just in case—”  Airplanes, especially those flown by the Army Air Forces, had always interested Norma, so she was more than delighted when shortly after their arrival at the field, a flight of small, sleek fighter planes came winging in out of the blue.  “Look, Rosa!” Norma exclaimed. “Aren’t they wonderful! Like a flock of beautiful white pigeons!”  There was no need to say “Look” to the little Italian WAC. As if in a hypnotic trance, she stood with eyes glued on the flight of planes.  “See how they circle!” Norma herself was entranced. “This is like war. This is how they will come sweeping in after escorting a bomber squadron in Africa, or China, or who knows where. That’s the way they’ll look when we watch them beyond the seas.”  “Yes, this is war,” was all that Rosa said, as one by one the fighting planes taxied across the field into position.  Like a troop of boys the fliers came walking across the field.  “Bill is in flight training right now,” Norma said, all excited. “If only he were in that group!”  “Who’s Bill?” Rosa’s eyes left the planes for an instant.  “Oh, he’s just Bill.” Norma laughed. “But he’s not here.”  Always interested in any person in uniform, Norma moved closer to the joking, laughing group.  “How young they seem!” she said, half aloud. It shocked her to think that some day, perhaps not too far away, from the blue sky, shot out of his plane, Bill would come hurtling down, tumbling over and over like a stick thrown into the air crashing at last to earth.  “This is war,” she thought, with a shudder. “We WACs must do all in our power to make it end. And we will! Now we are a hundred and fifty thousand. Next it will be three hundred thousand—half a million—a million WACs marching away to win the war.”  Looking up, she allowed her eyes to sweep the field. It was an inspiring picture—the men, the planes, the flag floating in the breeze.  “Oh!” she whispered. “Oh! How I wish Dad were young again!”  And then, with a sudden start, she realized that Rosa was gone from her side.  “She’s vanished!” she thought, with a sudden sense of panic, as her eyes sought the girl in vain.  Just then, as if moving of its own will, one of the fighter planes began gliding toward the center of the field.  At once the quiet scene became one of action. A young pilot close to the plane made a running jump to grab the tail of the plane. He had just reached it when, in the midst of shouting and sound of rushing feet, the plane’s motor went silent, and the plane itself came to a sudden stop.  Norma was thunderstruck when, from the pilot’s seat of that plane, none other than her companion, Rosa, the little Italian WAC, was dragged out.  “Rosa! Rosa! You little dunce! Why did you do it?” she screamed as she raced forward.  By the time she reached the side of the plane Rosa was on the ground. A stalwart member of the Military Police had her by the arm, and was saying:  “Come along, sister. What’s wrong with you? Drunk? Or just plain nuts—or nothin’ at all?”  “It’s the guardhouse for her,” a second M. P. predicted loudly.  Realizing that for the moment nothing could be accomplished, Norma joined three grinning young pilots as they followed the M. P.’s and Rosa across the field.  “What’s the matter with that girl?” one of the pilots asked in a friendly tone.  “I don’t know,” was all Norma could say.  “She was with you, wasn’t she?” a second pilot asked.  Norma made no reply.  “She really had that plane going,” said the first pilot. “One minute more, and she’d have been right up in the sky.”  “And there’s secrets in those planes that nobody but us are supposed to know,” put in number three. “By George! Maybe she’s a spy!”  “Hush,” said Norma. “She’s no more a spy than you are. She’s a WAC.”  “A WAC!” the first pilot exclaimed. “Well I’ll be jiggered! And I suppose you’re one too?”  “Sure I am,” Norma agreed.  “Well, all I got to say is you’d look swell in any uniform,” was the final rejoinder.  Just then the flight commander, a very youthful-appearing major who had come across the field in long strides, caught up with the procession.  “Caught this girl trying to steal one of your planes,” said an M. P.  “Yes,” said the other. “We’re taking her to the guardhouse. C’mon, sister.” He gave the weeping Rosa a gentle push.  “Wait a minute. Not so fast. Those are our planes. I’m flight commander. Let the girl go. She won’t run away, will you, young lady?”  Rosa tried to speak, but no words came.  “Here’s a young lady who was with her,” said a pilot, moving Norma gently forward. “She says they’re both WACs.”  “WACs?” said the officer. “Hmm! Where are your uniforms?”  “We’re on leave.” Norma swallowed hard, then threw her shoulders back. “Saturday afternoon and Sunday we can wear what we please. And—and Major,” she stammered, “I don’t know why Rosa did it. I—I think the plane charmed her.”  “Charmed her! Hmm! Now let’s see.”  “She’s one of the best little WACs in our squadron,” said Norma, half in despair.  “And are you the squadron’s leader?”  “No, but I drill the entire company. And that’s not all!” Norma exclaimed, gathering courage from the major’s smiling eyes. “I’m the daughter of Major John M. Kent, who fought in the World War—”  “John M. Kent!” The major studied her face. “You do look like him. You’ve got his eyes.”  “Then you know him?” Norma exclaimed.  “Quite well. He’s a splendid man.”  “His eyes are not all I have,” said Norma. “I have his picture.” She fumbled in her billfold.  “Here—here it is.”  The officer studied the photograph, and, across the bottom of it, he read:  “To my beloved daughter Norma.”  “Norma,” he smiled. “That’s a pretty name for a pretty girl. So you’re a WAC? A chip off the old block. Shake.” He held out his hand. She seized it in a good, friendly grip.  “And here’s a picture of our squadron,” Norma said half a minute later. “There’s Rosa, right there, uniform and all. You know we wouldn’t do anything wrong. I guess Rosa just lost her head.”  “Yes, lost my head,” Rosa sobbed.  “All right, boys,” said the major. “You may let the young lady go. You can’t put a WAC in the guardhouse. It just isn’t being done, especially not here.”  To Norma he said: “If I’m here long enough I’m coming to visit your camp. Yours is a grand outfit. We’re going to need you all before this scrap is over.”  “Oh! Please do come!” Norma exclaimed. “I—I’ll get you the keys to Boom Town and to every other place in old Fort Des Moines!”  “Well, I’m jiggered!” exclaimed one of the pilots, as Norma and the still silently weeping Rosa hurried off the field.  Once she was safe on the streetcar and headed for the city, Rosa ceased her weeping, but every now and again Norma heard her whisper:  “Why did I do it? Oh why?”  What was back of all this? Hidden away in the little Italian girl’s mind were secrets. Norma would never be able to doubt that from this day on.  “I’d like to go exploring in that mind of yours,” she thought. That this type of exploring often leads to disaster she knew all too well. So, for the time being, she did not explore.  Arrived at the city, Norma at once sought out a restaurant with a little nook in the wall where lights were subdued and where delicious foods were served.  By the time they had gone all the way from soup to ice cream and were sipping good strong black tea, the little Italian girl’s eyes were shining once again.  “Was that after all so terrible?” she asked.  “Of course it was,” Norma replied instantly. The question surprised and shocked her.  “I did no harm to the plane.”  “You might have killed someone, wrecked the plane, or even flown away in it.”  “Oh, no, I—” For a space of seconds it seemed that Rosa was on the verge of revealing some important secret. “But—but I didn’t do any of those terrible things,” she ended lamely.  “The secret must wait,” Norma told herself. To Rosa she said: “There were secrets in that plane.”  “I didn’t want their secrets,” Rosa’s cheeks flushed.  “How could they know that?” Norma was a little provoked.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _“You Might Have Wrecked the Plane,” Norma Replied_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “I’m a WAC. When they knew that they saw it was all right.”  “It was I who got you off.” Norma’s voice rose. “They thought you were a spy.”  “I, a spy?” Rosa stared. “Yes, that is what they said, but they were joking.”  “They were not joking.” Norma was in dead"]]]
