Rare happenings have been omitted and sometimes, to avoid long explanations, _probable_ matters have been stated as if they were ascertained facts; but these instances are few, and it is hoped no reader will be led into serious error.  The year 360 B.C. has been selected for the hypothetical time of this visit, not because of any special virtue in that date, but because Athens was then architecturally almost perfect, her civic and her social life seemed at their best, the democratic constitution held its vigor, and there were few outward signs of the general decadence which was to set in after the triumph of Macedon.  I have endeavored to state no facts and to make no allusions, that will not be fairly obvious to a reader who has merely an elementary knowledge of Greek annals, such information, for instance, as may be gained through a good secondary school history of ancient times. This naturally has led to comments and descriptions which more advanced students may find superfluous.  The writer has been under a heavy debt to the numerous and excellent works on Greek “Private Antiquities” and “Public Life” written in English, French, or German, as well as to the various great Classical Encyclopædias and Dictionaries, and to many treatises and monographs upon the topography of Athens and upon the numerous phases of Attic culture.  It is proper to say, however, that the material from such secondary sources has been merely supplementary to a careful examination of the ancient Greek writers, with the objects of this book kept especially in view.  A sojourn in modern Athens, also, has given me an impression of the influence of the Attic landscape upon the conditions of old Athenian life, an impression that I have tried to convey in this small volume.  I am deeply grateful to my sister, Mrs. Fannie Davis Gifford, for helpful criticism of this book while in manuscript; to my wife, for preparing the drawings from Greek vase-paintings which appear as illustrations; and to my friend and colleague, Professor Charles A. Savage, for a kind and careful reading of the proofs.  Thanks also are due to Henry Holt and Company for permission to quote material from their edition of Von Falke’s “Greece and Rome.”  W. S. D.

The Importance of Athens in Greek History.—To three ancient nations the men of the twentieth century owe an incalculable debt. To the Jews we owe most of our notions of religion; to the Romans we owe traditions and examples in law, administration, and the general management of human affairs which still keep their influence and value; and finally, to the Greeks we owe nearly all our ideas as to the fundamentals of art, literature, and philosophy, in fact, of almost the whole of our intellectual life.  These Greeks, however, our histories promptly teach us, did not form a single unified nation.  They lived in many “city-states” of more or less importance, and some of the largest of these contributed very little directly to our civilization.  Sparta, for example, has left us some noble lessons in simple living and devoted patriotism, but hardly a single great poet, and certainly never a philosopher or sculptor.  When we examine closely, we see that the civilized life of Greece, during the centuries when she was accomplishing the most, was peculiarly centered at Athens.  Without Athens, Greek history would lose three quarters of its significance, and modern life and thought would become infinitely the poorer.   2. Why the Social Life of Athens is so Significant.—Because, then, the contributions of Athens to our own life are so important, because they touch (as a Greek would say) upon almost every side of “the true, the beautiful, and the good,” it is obvious that the outward conditions under which this Athenian genius developed deserve our respectful attention.  For assuredly such personages as Sophocles, Plato, and Phidias were not isolated creatures, who developed their genius apart from, or in spite of, the life about them, but rather were the ripe products of a society, which in its excellences and weaknesses presents some of the most interesting pictures and examples in the world.  To understand the Athenian civilization and genius it is not enough to know the outward history of the times, the wars, the laws, and the lawmakers.  We must see Athens as the average man saw it and lived in it from day to day, and _then_ perhaps we can partially understand how it was that during the brief but wonderful era of Athenian freedom and prosperity[*], Athens was able to produce so many men of commanding genius as to win for her a place in the history of civilization which she can never lose.  [*] That era may be assumed to begin with the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.), and it certainly ended in 322 B.C., when Athens passed decisively under the power of Macedonia; although since the battle of Chæroneia (338 B.C.) she had done little more than keep her liberty on sufferance.   3. The Small Size and Sterility of Attica.—Attica was a very small country according to modern notions, and Athens the only large city therein.  The land barely covered some 700 square miles, with 40 square miles more, if one includes the dependent island of Salamis. It was thus far smaller than the smallest of our American “states” (Rhode Island = 1250 square miles), and was not so large as many American counties.  It was really a triangle of rocky, hill-scarred land thrust out into the Ægean Sea, as if it were a sort of continuation of the more level district of Bœotia. Yet small as it was, the hills inclosing it to the west, the seas pressing it form the northeast and south, gave it a unity and isolation all its own. Attica was not an island; but it could be invaded only by sea, or by forcing the resistance which could be offered at the steep mountain passes towards Bœotia or Megara.  Attica was thus distinctly separated from the rest of Greece.  Legends told how, when the half-savage Dorians had forced themselves southward over the mainland, they had never penetrated into Attica; and the Athenians later prided themselves upon being no colonists from afar, but upon being “earth-sprung,”—natives of the soil which they and their twenty-times grandfathers had held before them.   [Illustration:  Sketch map of Attica]   This triangle of Attica had its peculiar shortcomings and virtues. It was for the most part stony and unfertile.  Only a shallow layer of good soil covered a part of its hard foundation rock, which often in turn lay bare on the surface.  The Athenian farmer had a sturdy struggle to win a scanty crop, and about the only products he could ever raise in abundance for export were olives (which seemed to thrive on scanty soil and scanty rainfall) and honey, the work of the mountain bees.   4. The Physical Beauty of Attica.—Yet Attica had advantages which more than counterbalanced this grudging of fertility.  All Greece, to be sure, was favored by the natural beauty of its atmosphere, seas, and mountains, but Attica was perhaps the most favored portion of all, Around her coasts, rocky often and broken by pebbly beaches and little craggy peninsulas, surged the deep blue Ægean, the most glorious expanse of ocean in the world.  Far away spread the azure water[*],—often foam-crested and sometimes alive with the dolphins leaping at their play,—reaching towards a shimmering sky line where rose “the isles of Greece,” masses of green foliage, or else of tawny rock, scattered afar, to adapt the words of Homer, “like shields laid on the face of the glancing deep.”  [*] The peculiar blueness of the water near Attica is probably caused by the clear rocky bottom of the sea, as well as by the intensity of the sunlight.   Above the sea spread the noble arch of the heavens,—the atmosphere often dazzlingly bright, and carrying its glamour and sparkle almost into the hearts of men.  The Athenians were proud of the air about their land.  Their poets gladly sung its praises, as, for example, Euripides[*], when he tells how his fellow countrymen enjoy being—  Ever through air clear shining brightly As on wings uplifted, pacing lightly.   [*] Medea:829.   5. The Mountains of Attica.—The third great element, besides the sea and the atmosphere of Athens, was the mountains.  One after another the bold hills reared themselves, cutting short all the plainlands and making the farmsteads often a matter of slopes and terraces.  Against the radiant heavens these mountains stood out boldly, clearly; revealing all the little gashes and seams left from that long-forgotten day when they were flung forth from the bowels of the earth.  None of these mountains was very high:  Hymettus, the greatest, was only about 3500 feet; but rising as they often did from a close proximity to the sea, and not from a dwarfing table-land, even the lower hills uplifted themselves with proud majesty.  These hills were of innumerable tints according to their rocks, the hue of the neighboring sea, and the hour of the day.  In spring they would be clothed in verdant green, which would vanish before the summer heats, leaving them rosy brown or gray.  But whatever the fundamental tone, it was always brilliant; for the Athenians lived in a land where blue sky, blue sea, and the massive rock blent together into such a galaxy of shifting color, that, in comparison, the lighting of almost any northern or western landscape would seem feeble and tame.  The Athenians absorbed natural beauty with their native air.   6. The Sunlight in Athens.—The Athenian loved sunshine, and Helios the Sun God was gracious to his prayers.  In the Athens of to-day it is reckoned that the year averages 179 days in which the sun is not concealed by clouds one instant; and 157 days more when the sun is not hidden more than half an hour[*].  Ancient Athens was surely not more cloudy.  Nevertheless, despite this constant sunshine and a southern latitude, Athens was stricken relatively seldom with semitropical heat.  The sea was a good friend, bringing tempering breezes.  In the short winter there might be a little frost, a little snow, and a fair supply of rain.  For the rest of the year, one golden day was wont to succeed another, with the sun and the sea breeze in ever friendly rivalry.  [*] The reason for these many clear days is probably "]]]
