In some measure it was the Yankees’ fault and to some extent the product of facts and forces that are beyond the control of individuals. There was disapproval and jealousy of the over-prominence America had too easily acquired in the great war.  There was resentment of the favoritism of the Russians for the Americans.  There was the inheritance of pride in the military achievements of the Empire. There was utter ignorance of the motives and purposes of the present English government. But there was also the independence and \"insolence\" of the Yankees, their free and easy attitude toward British official dignity, their insistence upon reasons why, and their assumption of knowledge and ability quite beyond anything their experience in military matters justified.  And these little irritations grew and were magnified in little minds until the manner of the Yankee salute itself became a mote in the British eye.  I have heard the most caustic and untrue criticism of American soldiers from the lips of English officers whose rank should in itself have been guaranty that they would not descend to this.  I have heard it hinted at a score of times by petty officers who out of consideration for my presence did not pursue the subject to its commonplace ends.  And repeatedly members of the new British army that had never seen the Yanks at all said to me in all friendliness: \"What a pity that your men out here were not real Americans, that they were foreigners, and that they gave America such a black eye by their conduct.\"  This was a direct echo of the campaign of vilification of the American soldier which was carried on within their own circles by certain British officers of the North Russian Expeditionary Force.  I overheard some English soldiers singing a parody of \"Over There,\" of which I can only remember \"The Yanks are running, the Yanks are running everywhere,\" and the last line \"And they didn’t do a damn thing about it over there.\"  This was in Archangel.  There were no Yankee soldiers about.  They were at the front.  The singing which had been in a subdued tone was stopped immediately when my presence was observed and when we had finished a little conversation the Tommies sang \"Over There,\" and they sang it straight. There was no anti-Yank feeling in these men. They had genuine admiration for the Yankee soldiers.  They had picked up the little seeds of antipathy from some of their officers.  As a matter of fact the American soldier in North Russia fought well. He drove the Bolsheviki 427 versts south of Archangel before winter set in, and then took up winter quarters and prepared for defense.  Constant patrolling had to be done, and expeditions had to be made against the Bolshevik villages that flanked us on both sides and constantly threatened our rear.  All this was for the most part true of seven fronts between which there was no connection or communication except by going back to the base.  Captain Odyard of Company A was decorated by the British government, and the company was praised for its gallant work at Ustpadenga and Vistafka, and yet the British Tommies of the new army asked me in July: \"Why was it that the Yanks turned tail at Ustpadenga?\"  The charges made by the British that the American soldiers were unreliable and mutinous were founded correctly on the mental attitude of the American soldier and upon the things he said.  He hated the expedition and its management.  But those charges were not fairly founded upon anything that the American soldier did.  There was an instance of one company refusing at one time to go to the front. It was but a temporary refusal.  They went. There were several parallel instances when British and Canadian and French soldiers resorted to similar semi-mutiny.  It was always momentary.  They always eventually went forward with the unequal fight despite the inhuman conditions.  The dissatisfied and unhappy soldier was not yellow.  He may have had some sympathy for the Bolsheviki whose country he was unwillingly invading. He certainly felt that the invasion was a crime.  But he was not yellow.[#]  He obeyed orders.  He fought splendidly.  He went to his death.  He held his post.  He cursed the British and did his duty. He killed Bolsheviki, plenty of them, not knowing why.   [#] The report of the Judge Advocate General gives a number of cases of American soldiers who were convicted by court-martial of having been guilty of self-inflicted wounds.  The number accused of this was lamentably large.  Even if larger in proportion, however, than in any other army in the world war, the reflective mind is forced to ask the question: Why?                                      *VIII*                             *\"AMERICA DOBRA\"*   There was one thing in North Russia that touched every American where every normal man is sentimental.  There was a passion for America.  In every log house there was love for America.  In the hearts of the people in every village there was moving what Benjamin Kidd calls \"the emotion of the ideal.\"  We could not understand it at first.  Every peasant greeted us with \"America dobra,\" which is not good Russian, but a sort of slang phrase meaning that America is all right.  And now and then one would step up a little nearer and in a more subdued tone say that some other country was not all right.  We suspected at first that he was playing a double game.  We remembered the man who walks like a bear.  We smiled cynically and handed him a cigarette.  But we did him an injustice.  [Illustration: The church at Yemetskoye is visible for many miles up the Dvina. Shenkursk is a quiet and romantic spot on the Vaga River.]  One heavily whiskered old peasant of Kitsa made me see this injustice. We had crawled into Kitsa on the second night after the evacuation of Shenkursk, with the weather about twenty below zero and bringing with us ninety-seven wounded on sleds.  The senior medical officer had selected the best houses in Kitsa for hospital purposes, and one could never forget how cheerfully on ten minutes’ notice those peasant people got themselves and their things out of the way and helped to get the patients in and warm and fed.  Two of these houses belonged to my bewhiskered friend.  He was something of a magnate in Kitsa.  And it turned out that we were to use his houses for hospital purposes for months after that night, sending him and his on their northward way, for safety in the company of refugees from seven other villages.  His property interests in Kitsa, however, were too important in his old life to be ignored and in a few days he was back with a sled convoy as a common driver, a labor which he persisted in as long as the fortunes of war permitted for the sake of the opportunity it gave him to look things over. Knowing that the hospital was an American affair the old man was quite delighted that his houses had been chosen for this purpose.  \"America dobra,\" he said to me exultantly.  One day I happened to discover that in both houses the private rooms in which the precious family possessions had been stored and secured by heavy padlocks had been broken open and the contents looted and despoiled.  Most of the fabrics and silverware and family gods pulled out of trunks and bureaus were of no use or interest to soldiers and had been thrown on the floor and trampled underfoot.  It was wanton and heartless, and believing that our boys had at least had a hand in it I was ashamed and chagrined.  It was painful to remember the gleam of faith in the old Mongolian eyes when he said \"America dobra.\"  When he came again and I saw him the gloom on his face was terrible.  He had seen the wreck.  Apologetically I offered my condolences: \"America ne dobra.\"  \"No,\" he said slowly in Russian, \"no, war is at fault.  War is not good.  America dobra.\"  So I had to think again.  I hadn’t seen far enough into the soul behind this bushy face. And I didn’t smile cynically as I handed him the cigarette.  After a while we learned to discriminate between \"Amerikanski\" and \"Amerika.\"  The peasants often handed us personal compliments, but we learned that when they praised America they were not talking about us but about an idea, an ideal, a dream—would I could say a fact!  These Russian peasants have not read American history.  They do not know American politics.  Most of them probably have not read five hundred words about America in all their lives. But they have heard and talked about America some, and thought about America more. Perhaps there are many well-read Americans who could profitably think about America more, even at a loss of time to read.  And now the moujik of North Russia and his wife and children have all of them seen Americans—real live ones—and liked them.  How much the Russian peasant liked the American soldier it is a little difficult for me to convey without seeming to exaggerate.  I was skeptical about it for months.  It might be bear love.  He was always begging for cigarettes, and one could easily see through his cupidity and simple craft.  But I saw American soldiers billeted in Russian homes and mixing with the Russians so much that I am sure that I know the true sentiments in this case.  I have been asked by English soldiers more than once: \"Why is it that the Russians like the Yankees so much better than they do us?\"  I asked this question, without the comparison, of an intelligent looking Russian soldier: \"Why do you Russians like the Yanks so well?\"  \"Because they shake hands like men,\" he answered thoughtfully.  \"Because they treat us as equals.  Because they are good to the Russian people,\" and the next day when we were talking about the same subject he said: \"It is because they represent America to us that we like the Yankee soldiers.\"  Yet there was another"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46191"],["title","Fighting Without a War: An Account of Military Intervention in North Russia (#5)"],["body","to this picture. When first I came to Archangel there was in all people a wonderful faith in Mr. Wilson.  I marveled how all these Russians could have learned so much about him. They knew what he had said.  They knew what he stood for before the world.  I wondered if the people at home knew as well.  Pictures of the American President soon made their appearance and were given great prominence throughout the city and in every village.  I was calling on the editor of a Russian newspaper hundreds of miles up the river one day.  He could use a few English words and I a few Russian.  Mr. Wilson’s picture hung over his desk.  \"The friend of the Russian people,\" he said, pointing to the picture, and as he looked at it tears slowly gathered.  Turning toward me he said brokenly: \"He is the one man in all the world who can lead Russia out of her troubles.\"  And I gathered that one reason for this faith was because the Bolsheviki respected and feared Mr. Wilson. This man was on the Bolshevik black list.  His paper was radically socialistic, however, and the editor was quite distrustful of the results of the Allied expedition.  But he believed in Mr. Wilson.  \"He will soon speak,\" he said, \"and then all Russia will follow him.\"  That was in December.  In June I met this editor in Archangel.  His home and printing plant had long been in the hands of the Bolsheviki.  There was pathetic sadness in his face as he told me of the universal hopelessness of the people.  I boomed the League of Nations. It would cure the wrongs, it would become the guide and instrument of salvation. But there was no response of hope.  \"We have lost Mr. Wilson and there is no hope.  But after we are all killed off in this mad and hopeless struggle, Russia will rise out of the ruins and show the way of real democracy.\"                                       *IX*                               *AMERICA EXIT*   When it was openly announced that the American troops were to be withdrawn from North Russia the Bolshevik propaganda took every possible advantage of it, claiming that President Wilson was now their friend and America would soon recognize their government.  A certain type of Englishman also made use of the opportunity to call the attention of the Russians to the fact that their much praised American friends were now leaving them to the mercy of the Bolsheviki except for the greater friendship of England for Russia.  England would not desert Russia.  We felt great uncertainty at this time.  Not a man of us had one authorized word of explanation to make.  Our government was silent.  Our enemies were noisy.  But the Russian peasant never wavered a hair’s-breadth in his faith in the friendship of America.  If the Americans were going home then that was the best thing to do.  If the English were staying then perhaps that was not the best thing to do.  And when the departure took place and the Yankees packed up their old kit-bags for home they were given the warmest good-bys and God-bless-yous in Russian, and there was no indication of resentment at being left in a bad predicament.  I stood on the bank of the Emtsa River when three platoons of Company K embarked on a barge and waved their farewells to the theater of war.  I was the only American left behind. On the river bank nearly the entire population of Yemetskoye were assembled, dressed in their best clothes and giving every possible evidence of their regard and esteem for these boys.  As the barge swung down the river with the soldiers singing \"Keep the home fires burning,\" I saw many a handkerchief wiping tears away on the river bank, and the head man of the Zemstvo Upravda, who stood beside me all dressed up in a white shirt, had tears in his eyes too as he grasped my hand and said again as he had said repeatedly before: \"Amerikanski dobrey.\"  I saw these American boys embark at Archangel and Economy—four great liners loaded with them—for Brest.  Archangel was busy welcoming an incoming British army.  There were no demonstrations here except those of American joy; exuberant, selfish joy.  For the war at last was over in those last days of June for these five thousand men who for a year had done the work of twenty-five thousand on a job that called for fifty thousand or more.  And the very last to leave were those who perhaps had done the hardest work—Companies A, B, and C of the 310th Engineers. These men embarked on a transport at Archangel on June twenty-sixth, and the American expedition was at an end.  When these men were gone Archangel was a lonesome place for an American. They were affectionately remembered by the Russians, and there certainly were some among them to remember the love and gratitude and admiration of old Russian eyes in wrinkled faces, and the simple, wonderful faith of these backward and romantic peasants in the land that symbolized to them freedom, education, and justice.                                       *X*                           *THE NEW BRITISH ARMY*   In June a splendid new British army took over the fronts in North Russia from the Americans and the Canadians and the old British \"category\" men. They came to finish the job, to clean up North Russia, to take Kotlas by July fifteenth, Viatka and Vologda in another thirty days, and Petrograd before snowfall.  This was quite on the cards.  This new army had come to Russia with much boasting and had been received in Archangel with great ceremonial and flourish.  They were \"men from France\" who \"knew how to fight,\" and they would \"show the Yankees how to lick the Bolos.\"  This boastfulness was unlike that of the first Yankees to go to France in that it was indulged in more by the officers than by the men.  Many small British officers had acquired with reason a feeling of resentment toward the Yankee privates which during the spring found relief in big brag about what the new army was going to do in comparison with what the Yanks had done.  There were ex-colonels who came as corporals, and lords who came really to fight.  It was an army to be proud of, an army of which much could be expected, an army which certainly would put across its program.  It was very much bigger than the army that had borne the winter’s campaign. The equipment was better in every way.  They had new rifles that would not jam at every other shot as the old ones often did.  They had more and better artillery.  They had a large air force with an abundance of equipment.  More than all they had the best time of the year in which to conduct a campaign.  Moreover, they had small Bolshevik forces to contend with, as the Bolsheviki seemed to be busy just then elsewhere.  [Illustration: The new British army entered Archangel in June with great pomp and ceremony. The Duma building at Archangel was decorated in honor of the new army that came to finish the Bolsheviki.]  In the address of welcome that was made to this new army on its arrival, the commanding general said that no better equipped army had ever been sent out by the British Empire.  This was easy to believe.  Not only was there the newest and latest equipment, there was quantity, such amplitude of everything as to inspire the greatest of confidence, and we who had lived through the poverty of the previous winter felt that there would be no such handicap upon those who should now turn the tide of battle and march victoriously to Petrograd.  About half of the men in this new army were volunteers.  Many of them told me that they had enlisted because they could not find work, but that they had specifically volunteered to come and rescue besieged British soldiers from Archangel.  When they found themselves three hundred miles up the Dvina River engaged in an expensive offensive they groused as hard as the Americans or Canadians ever had, but this did not interfere with their fighting.  These men gave a good account of themselves, and they would have gone right through to Kotlas and Viatka and Vologda if something entirely beyond them had not changed the British plans.                                       *XI*                           *THE NEW RUSSIAN ARMY*   There were broadly three classes in the Russian army: first, the volunteer Slavo-British Legion of men who enlisted in order to draw army rations and buy from the Y.M.C.A; second, the conscripted \"mobilized\" army of men forced to join against their own choice; and, third, a large body of ex-Bolshevist prisoners who chose the army in preference to prison and labor, and who because of this volition on their part were made a part of the Slavo-British Legion.  In each of these classes were many men who had been on the \"Eastern\" front in February, 1917, and who then threw down their arms and went home, \"having finished with war forever.\"  Politicians and militarists who were unable to understand that act have been equally unable to understand any of the subsequent acts of these strange and natural men.  I am horrified at what these men have since done, and abhor it, but I think I understand it, at least somewhat.  These Russian soldiers were provided with food and rum and cigarettes. They liked this. But they disliked everything else.  They were sometimes commanded by British officers, which they hated.  They were permitted to wear the British name on their shoulders when they went into battle, which they could not do with patriotic enthusiasm, and when they visited their friends, which they did with explanations and chagrin.  They were Russians, but they were not a Russian army.  I have seen many a Russian officer shrug his shoulders in quizzical dismay as he spoke about the British uniform he was wearing.  But there was real fighting ability in this new Russian army.  It was greatly increased in numbers and much better organized and officered than the army of the previous winter.  It was supplied with the new equipment, and much was justly expected of it.  It was thoroughly saturated with British stories of Bolshevik atrocities, as fear is a "]]]
