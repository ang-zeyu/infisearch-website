I’m sure Dad won’t object.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _A Spurt of Flame Ran Across the Boy’s Shoe_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “We are already loading the station wagon, but that won’t hold all we need. Miss Pearson phoned from Bayport for us to bring dishes, equipment and all the help we can get.”  “I’ll be down as soon as I can put on my clothes,” Kitty promised.  How thankful she was that they had arranged for Jane to have the small room behind the kitchen. Kitty roused her and gave careful instructions about the house and Billy, in case she would have to be gone all day. Then she told her father about the call, and in ten minutes was on her way down to the Canteen.  She helped Vera finish loading the station wagon and they drove over to the dock where her boat was housed. With the aid of Sally and Lana they filled the boat with pots, pans, all sorts of utensils and dishes, and what canned goods they had in stock. So many willing hands made quick work of the packing. They left only room enough for Mrs. Evans, the two Bright girls and Kitty. Judy Conner was going to help Vera pack the rest of their things in the station wagon and drive around over the causeway.  Not until they were seated in the boat and on their way to Bayport did Kitty find time to ask about the fire.  “The old cannery was a regular firetrap anyhow,” said Sally.  “It’s a miracle the fire didn’t sweep on to the shipyards,” Mrs. Evans remarked. “There was a strong northeast wind blowing that carried burning brands right in that direction.”  “Sounds like sabotage,” put in Lana.  “I doubt it,” said Mrs. Evans, who had a way of thinking the best of everything and everybody. “A careless match or hot cigarette ashes could have started the fire in any of those dumps.”  The mention of cigarette ashes made Kitty think of the cigar ash falling on the sailor’s shoe in the bus. Then with a feeling of shock she recalled that the sailor had come aboard the bus in the oyster cannery district. Could there possibly be any connection between the two fires? She knew that gasoline or kerosene was often used by saboteurs in setting fires. Perhaps the main motive had not been the destruction of the cannery and shacks, but the shipyards and government docks beyond.  Resolutely she tried to dismiss the entire affair, thinking how unjust it was to be suspicious of people she didn’t know. At least she would say nothing about it to anyone else, but she decided to do some investigating on her own if opportunity came.  There was so much to be done on reaching the scene of the disaster, however, that for a time Kitty forgot all about the incident on the bus. The Bayport Canteen workers had already set up a kitchen in a small playground near the center of the oyster cannery district.  She was amazed at the devastation that had been wrought in a few short hours. Practically every home that had surrounded the oyster cannery and docks had been burned to charcoal. The firemen, seeing it was impossible to save the poorly built shacks in the strong gale, had concentrated on preventing the spread of the fire to the essential war industries near by.  “It may be the best thing that could have happened to these people,” said Miss Pearson, when the island group of workers arrived. “We’ll see that proper housing units surround the cannery if it is rebuilt.”  Kitty had her initiation that day in the wonderful work which the Red Cross does in emergencies. As there was no adequate kitchen within easy reach of the homeless people, cooking racks had been set up in the open.  “If this were night and there was danger of air raids,” Miss Pearson explained to a group of Canteen apprentices who stood around the cook fire, “we’d have to cover our cook fire completely to keep it from being seen overhead.”  “My brother in the Coast Guard says even a match struck in the marshes can be seen by a passing plane,” Sally told them.  Soon pots were steaming with coffee, while huge saucepans held bubbling cereal. Kitty, with three other girls, improvised a table and benches where the children could sit to eat. In her group was Mrs. Janice, a member of the nutrition class, whom Vera had pointed out as a resident of the cannery district. She was an uneducated woman with an eager willingness to do everything in her power to help. Three of her sons were in the service. Though she and her other two children were now left homeless, she was doing her bit to help her fellow sufferers.  “There’s talk that the cannery was set afire,” she told Kitty when they went off together to tear some loose planks from a small section of the cannery that had not burned.  “Really! What have you heard about it?” Kitty said, encouraging Mrs. Janice to talk.  “The night watchman said he saw a stranger in dark clothes hurrying past the factory not ten minutes before he discovered the fire.” Then she added in a lower tone, “A sailor, too, he claims.”  Could it be possible that the boy she had seen on the bus had done this awful thing? But Kitty tried not to show her suspicions as she said, “But people must constantly pass by the cannery.”  “That’s so, of course, but you know how it is. You hear all sorts o’ talk. People round here were mighty careful ’bout fire, knowing how shoddy our houses were.”  “Maybe it’s a blessing in disguise. You’ll certainly have better homes to live in after this.”  With the aid of Mrs. Janice’s fourteen-year-old son, Jerry, they found a half dozen boards from which they managed to make a table. The Canteen workers were soon helping the hungry children to bowls of hot cereal and milk as they lined up at the table. Some of them were upset at being separated from their parents, but Kitty had a way of stilling their fears as she satisfied their hunger.  When their breakfast was over, Kitty gave each of them an apple and herded them over near the swings. She solicited the aid of some older boys and girls to keep the younger children amused while their parents ate. Then for two hours she helped wash the mountain-like pile of dishes.  “How long will we have to feed them?” she asked Mrs. Evans, when she was finally drying her hands.  “Tired already?”  “Oh, no—that is, of course I’m tired, but I didn’t mean it that way. I was just wondering what’s to be done about all these people. Where will they sleep tonight? What will they do till more homes can be built?”  “And well you may, my dear,” said Mrs. Evans kindly. “The town is packed to capacity with war workers. In spite of that many homes have already made room for some of these people. The Red Cross will provide tents for others until permanent shelter can be found. In the meantime they are dependent on the Canteen Corps for food.”  Kitty’s eyes were starry as she looked at her leader. “It’s wonderful work, isn’t it, Mrs. Evans?”  “Indeed it is!”  “If this fire was the work of saboteurs, it only makes us dedicate ourselves all the more devotedly to bringing peace and harmony in the end.”  “Sometimes the most loyal person can let carelessness make him the worst sort of saboteur,” said Mrs. Evans significantly.  Kitty thought she had more reason than anyone else for doubting that that fire had been started by a careless patriot. She had thought at first that she would keep quiet about the little incident on the bus last night, but now she made up her mind to take Brad Mason into her confidence. Brad might be in a position to make some investigations that she could not about the sailor.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER FIVE                               THE SNACK BAR   Nutrition classes were suspended for the duration of the emergency.  “You’ll learn more through actual experience now,” Miss Pearson told them, “than I could teach you in many lessons.”  Kitty spent as much time as possible during the next three days helping to feed the homeless cannery workers and their families. Tuesday evening she was much too weary to go to the regular USO party, and so she had no opportunity to see Brad till the following Saturday.  By that time her excitement over the fire had cooled, and she was afraid he would think her silly to accuse the strange sailor of having anything to do with it. A score of times she had heard her father say, “When in doubt say nothing.” So she wisely followed his advice.  There was so much work to be done in the closing days of the nutrition class that she had no time to think of anything else. The course had opened up to her a whole new world of practical interest.  “I can’t believe we’ve learned so much in two weeks,” she said to Lana and Vera.  “I’m surely glad Miss Pearson taught us every day, instead of once a week as they do in some places,” said Vera.  “I’ll say,” agreed Lana. “It’s much better to do it in two weeks instead of ten.”  “And it’s been so much fun, too,” said Kitty. “Only think of the places we’ve visited—packing plants, canneries, bakeries, restaurant kitchens. It’s so interesting to learn about all the food industries around this part of the country.”  “I’ve got a whole notebook full of recipes, and ideas about food I can put to good use when my Jim comes back from Italy,” said Vera.  “Huh,” laughed Kitty, “I don’t have to wait for anybody to come back.”  Lana laughed too. “That’s right. You have a dad and little brother to experiment on right now.”  On the last evening, as they were going over to class, Kitty said to her two pals, “Strange, but I don’t feel a bit nervous over the exam.”  “It’s been so practical and interesting there’s no sense in anyone being nervous,” Vera agreed.  “I wish I felt as certain as you two,” said Lana, who was still poring over her tables of vitamins and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47775"],["title","Kitty Carter, Canteen Girl (#6)"],["body"," values.  At this final meeting all except three members of the class signed up to go on with the Canteen work, though Kitty and her two friends were the only ones from Palmetto Island. Kitty felt a real glow of pride when she received her certificate at the conclusion of the course. Each member of the class was also given a recipe book to help with her own home menus.  The Canteen course that followed immediately under Mrs. Evans gave quite a different kind of instruction. The brief experience they had already had in emergency feeding made them keenly appreciative of all the phases of the Canteen instruction. Step by step they discussed all the angles of the work; planning menus for large scale feeding, food preparation, and here the course they had just taken was of invaluable aid. They also discussed methods of food service and how to keep a Canteen orderly and spotless. Kitty was one of the group who received some practical experience in serving food at the blood donation center twice a week.  Two days before this course ended there was a railroad wreck twenty-five miles from town. Kitty went with the mobile canteen to supply food for the rescue crew who were working to clear the wounded from the wreck. It happened to be Hazel Dawson’s day off, and she, too, went in the Red Cross station wagon, and worked like a trooper, giving first aid to the wounded.  “Tired?” asked Hazel gently as they were riding home in the Red Cross car at ten o’clock that night.  “I didn’t know I was tired till I sat down,” Kitty admitted. “But Hazel, isn’t it wonderful to be able to help people at a time like this?”  “There’s nothing in life quite so wonderful. You have the spirit of a real Canteen worker, Kitty. It’s a privilege to feed men’s bodies when they’re hungry, but it’s still more wonderful to give comfort to their souls and anxious minds as I saw you doing several times today.”  Kitty had had no greater sense of pride when she donned her cap and gown at graduation than she felt the day she was entitled to wear her Canteen uniform the first time. She was going over to Bayport to meet a troop train with several of the workers.  The Belgian blue poplin dress made her bright eyes seem all the bluer. Her heart was beating proudly when she arranged her cap behind the auburn hair rolled softly into a pompadour. She had a feeling of real pride in those red crosses on her pocket and the white band of her cap. Some day she meant to earn service bars, too. Mrs. Evans wore a chevron and three bars, representing seven years of service.  Although the girls did not wear their uniforms at the Snack Bar, Kitty donned the official apron she was allowed to wear there on the first evening after finishing her course. Though she had done much volunteer work at the bar she felt somewhat elated tonight over being a full-fledged Canteen worker.  She was in an expansive mood and said as she and Judy were slicing bread for sandwiches, “Let’s make ’em extra large, with plenty of stuffing just to celebrate our graduation.”  “You might make that special dressing you were telling me about,” Judy suggested.  “May I, Mrs. Evans?” Kitty asked.  “Of course. The boys always enjoy something different.”  Kitty had learned to make a tart creole sauce for sandwich filling from their cook in New Orleans, so she prepared a bowlful. By the time the boys began to drift into the hall the air was fragrant with coffee and chocolate, and trays of sandwiches were ready.  Brad, knowing it was Kitty’s initiation night, was one of the first bluejackets to plant his elbows on the counter and demand a sandwich.  “And a cupa cawfee, too, wench, and be snappy about it!” he said with mock gruffness.  She made a face at him as she turned to get the coffee.  After one bite of the sandwich Brad’s eyes bulged. “Oh boy! This tastes like something from Toni’s swanky joint in New Orleans.”  Kitty laughed in delight. “Our old cook used to work at Toni’s. She gave me lots of his secrets.”  Jimmy Barnes sat beside Brad taking huge bites of a sandwich. He enthusiastically added his praise to Brad’s. “Boy, but this is really seasoned up like home cooking.”  “About the best seasoning they give us up at the hospital is the shrimp creole.”  “And they only have that about twice a month,” added Jimmy in disgust.  Kitty’s curiosity stirred. Maybe this was her chance to learn something about the staff in the galley.  “Do you know the cooks very well?” she asked.  “Only a passing acquaintance,” said Brad. “Our Chief Commissary Steward is named Krome—an old timer at the job.”  “I saw a thin, dark-looking chap on the bus the other night with a crescent on his arm. Do you happen to know him?”  “Quite a number down there,” said Jimmy dubiously. “Only one I’ve talked to very often is a fair young chap, named Ned Miller.”  “There’s one named Punaro fits your description,” Brad told Kitty. “He empties wastebaskets on our floor.”  “Right young—about eighteen or nineteen?” Kitty persisted.  “About that. Only been in a few months. Why?”  “Oh, nothing. I just happened to see him the other day on the bus.”  A few minutes later Brad and Jimmy went off to play a game of pingpong with some of the girls and for the next hour Kitty was very busy at the bar. Later during a lull in their business she glanced down the hall and noticed that Lieutenant Cary was playing chess with someone in the south corner of the room. They were about the only two who had not patronized the Snack Bar during the evening.  “What’s so interesting over there?” Brad’s teasing tone jolted Kitty out of her curious speculation.  “Who’s that playing chess with Lieutenant Cary?” she asked in a low tone.  Brad glanced to the south corner of the room and replied, “Krome.”  “You mean the head cook up at the hospital?”  “What’s so surprising about that?”  “Somehow I thought Lieutenant Cary would be too snippity to play chess with the cook.”  “Why Krome’s Chief Commissary Steward. Lieutenant Cary has no reason to be high-hat to him. He was in the service long before Cary ever thought of such a thing.”  “Is that so?”  “Sure.”  “But Dr. Cary is a lieutenant.”  “Just the same he’s only been in the service a few months. He’s one of the physicians recently recruited.”  “Oh, I see,” murmured Kitty in a significant tone. Then she asked, “Do you know anything about the cook?”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _“What’s So Interesting There?” Brad Asked_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Brad laughed. “I know he can dish up some mighty good chow on occasion.”  “He looks as though he didn’t object to good eating himself. He must weigh two hundred and twenty-five at least.” Kitty tried to make her tone seem trivial in case anyone else had overheard their conversation.  “I’ll be trotting along,” Brad said. “I promised to make a fourth for bridge over yonder.”  Kitty held his eyes a moment and lowered her voice to say, “There’s something I want to talk to you about when I have a chance.”  “I’ll see you home if you can get through before eleven. We can talk on the way up.”  “Fine,” she agreed.  Brad had scarcely taken his seat with the other players when Lieutenant Cary and Chief Krome came toward the bar.  Excitedly Kitty whispered to Judy, “Let me wait on them if they come here.”  Judy sent her a surprised look. “You’re welcome to them. I wouldn’t be interested.”  “Neither am I, in the way you think,” retorted Kitty with a laugh.  She thought what an odd pair they made as they came toward the Snack Bar. Lieutenant Cary was as lean and alert as a bloodhound, while the square-rigged Krome was almost a head shorter. Kitty would have felt curious about any man who was friendly with Lieutenant Cary, even if her curiosity had not already been stirred by one of Krome’s assistants, so that the association brought the Chief Steward under suspicion also.  Vera came out of the kitchen just as the two men straddled the stools at the counter and she took Lieutenant Cary’s order. Kitty’s hand was a little unsteady as she poured Krome’s cup of coffee.  “We have some special sandwiches tonight,” Judy explained to the two customers, “made by our new Canteen worker, Miss Kitty Carter.”  “I’ll take two,” Krome spoke up promptly.  When Kitty faced the head cook squarely he seemed such a hearty, good-natured sort her suspicions evaporated like the steam above his coffee cup.  “So you’re now a full-fledged Canteen worker.” Though Lieutenant Cary’s smile and words were friendly enough his tone held a slight cynicism.  “I wasn’t a bit prouder when I donned my cap and gown at graduation from college, than when I put on my uniform the first time,” she said frankly.  “They got something when they got you, young lady,” spoke up Krome warmly. “These sandwiches ain’t to be sneezed at.”  “Why, I’m thrilled that you think so! They tell me you can serve some very good things over at the hospital, and I can vouch for it myself the few times I’ve eaten there.”  “So you’re Chief Carter’s daughter?”  “And proud I am to have the honor.”  Krome finished the last crumb of his sandwich, and said, “How about giving me the recipe for that sandwich filling?”  Kitty looked disconcerted. “If you feed the boys on it at the hospital they may not want our sandwiches down here.”  “I’ll promise not to do that.”  Kitty laughed. “Oh, really, I wouldn’t be that selfish. You’re welcome to the recipe. And maybe you’d do me a favor in return.”  Krome looked surprised. “Me do you a favor?” he asked, indicating himself, then Kitty with his fat hand. Then he laughed as if it were a great joke.  “I heard the boys talking about your grand shrimp creole—and that they don’t get it often enough. How about giving me that recipe?”  “Oh, that? Sure. We’ll swap recipes then. I’ll bring it next time I come.”  When the men had gone Judy said with a sniff, “If you ever get a recipe out of him you’ll do better than Mrs. Evans has. He’"]]]
