'Er name's Doreen....An' me-that thort I knoo     The ways uv tarts, an' all that smoogin' game!   An' so I ort; fer ain't I known a few?     Yet some'ow...I dunno.  It ain't the same.   I carn't tell WOT it is; but, all I know,   I've dropped me bundle--an' I'm glad it's so.     Fer when I come ter think uv wot I been....      'Er name's Doreen.      III. The Stoush o' Day     Ar, these is 'appy days!  An' 'ow they've flown--     Flown like the smoke of some inchanted fag;   Since dear Doreen, the sweetest tart I've known,     Passed me the jolt that made me sky the rag.   An' ev'ry golding day floats o'er a chap   Like a glad dream of some celeschil scrap.    Refreshed wiv sleep Day to the mornin' mill     Comes jauntily to out the nigger, Night.   Trained to the minute, confident in skill,     'E swaggers in the East, chock-full o' skite;   Then spars a bit, an' plugs Night on the point.   Out go the stars; an' Day 'as jumped the joint.    The sun looks up, an' wiv a cautious stare,     Like some crook keekin' o'er a winder sill   To make dead cert'in everythink is square,     'E shoves 'is boko o'er an Eastern 'ill,   Then rises, wiv 'is dial all a-grin,   An' sez, \"'Ooray!  I knoo that we could win!\"    Sure of 'is title then, the champeen Day     Begins to put on dawg among 'is push,   An', as he mooches on 'is gaudy way,     Drors tribute from each tree an' flow'r an' bush.   An', w'ile 'e swigs the dew in sylvan bars,   The sun shouts insults at the sneakin' stars.    Then, lo! the push o' Day rise to applaud;     An' all 'is creatures clamour at 'is feet   Until 'e thinks'imself a little gawd,     An' swaggers on an' kids 'imself a treat.   The w'ile the lurkin' barrackers o' Night   Sneak in retreat an' plan another fight.    On thro' the hours, triumphant, proud an' fit,   The champeen marches on 'is up'ard way,   Till, at the zenith, bli'me!  'E-is-IT!   And all the world bows to the Boshter Day.   The jealous Night speeds ethergrams thro' space   'Otly demandin' terms, an' time, an' place.    A wile the champeen scorns to make reply;     'E's taken tickets on 'is own 'igh worth;   Puffed up wiv pride, an' livin' mighty 'igh,     'E don't admit that Night is on the earth.   But as the hours creep on 'e deigns to state   'E'll fight for all the earth an' 'arf the gate.    Late afternoon...Day feels 'is flabby arms,     An' tells 'imself 'e don't seem quite the thing.   The 'omin' birds shriek clamorous alarms;     An' Night creeps stealthily to gain the ring.   But see!  The champeen backs an' fills, becos   'E doesn't feel the Boshter Bloke 'e was.    Time does a bunk as us-u-al, nor stays     A single instant, e'en at Day's be'est.   Alas, the 'eavy-weight's 'igh-livin' ways     'As made 'im soft, an' large around the vest.   'E sez 'e's fat inside; 'e starts to whine;   'E sez 'e wants to dror the colour line.    Relentless nigger Night crawls thro' the ropes,     Advancin' grimly on the quakin' Day,   Whose noisy push, shorn of their 'igh-noon 'opes,     Wait, 'ushed an' anxious, fer the comin' fray.   And many lusty barrackers of noon   Desert 'im one by one--traitors so soon!    'E's out er form!  'E 'asn't trained enough!     They mark their sickly champeen on the stage,   An' narked, the sun, 'is backer, in a huff,     Sneaks outer sight, red in the face wiv rage.   W'ile gloomy roosters, they 'oo made the morn   Ring wiv 'is praises, creep to bed forlorn.     All faint an' groggy grows the beaten Day;     'E staggers drunkenly about the ring;   An owl 'oots jeerin'ly across the way,     An' bats come out to mock the fallin' King.   Now, wiv a jolt, Night spreads 'im on the floor,   An' all the west grows ruddy wiv 'is gore.    A single, vulgar star leers from the sky     An' in derision, rudely mutters, \"Yah!\"   The moon, Night's conkerbine, comes glidin' by     An' laughs a 'eartless, silvery \"Ha-ha!\"   Scorned, beaten, Day gives up the 'opeless fight,   An' drops 'is bundle in the lap o' Night.        *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *    So goes each day, like some celeschil mill,     E'er since I met that shyin' little peach.   'Er bonzer voice!  I 'ear its music still,     As when she guv that promise fer the beach.   An', square an' all, no matter 'ow yeh start,   The commin end of most of us is--Tart.     IV. Doreen     \"I wish't yeh menat it, Bill.\"  Oh, 'ow me 'eart      Went out to 'er that evnin' on the beach.   I knew she weren't no ordinary tart,         My little peach!    To 'ear 'er voice!  Its gentle sorter tone,     Like soft dream-music of some Dago band.   An' me all out; an' 'oldin' in me own         'Er little 'and.   An' 'ow she blushed!  O, strike! it was divine   The way she raised 'er shinin' eyes to mine.    'Er eyes!  Soft in the moon; such BOSHTER eyes!   An' when they sight a bloke...O, spare me days!   'E goes all loose inside; such glamour lies         In 'er sweet gaze.   It makes 'im all ashamed uv wot 'e's been   To look inter the eyes of my Doreen.           *      *      *      *    The wet sands glistened, an' the gleamin' moon     Shone yeller on the sea, all streakin' down.   A band was playin' some soft, dreamy choon;         An' up the town   We 'eard the distant tram-cars whir an' clash.   An' there I told Per 'ow I'd done me dash.    \"I wish't yeh meant it.\"  'Struth!  And did I, fair?     A bloke 'ud be a dawg to kid a skirt   Like her.  An' me well knowin' she was square.         It 'ud be dirt!   'E'd be no man to point wiv her, an' kid.   I meant it honest; an' she knoo I did.    She knoo.  I've done me block in on her, straight.     A cove 'as got to think some time in life   An' get some decent tart, ere it's too late,         To be 'is wife.   But, Gawd!  'Oo would 'a' thort it could 'a' been   My luck to strike the likes of Per?...Doreen!    Aw, I can stand their chuckin' off, I can.     It's 'ard; an' I'd delight to take 'em on.   The dawgs!  But it gets that way wiv a man         When 'e's fair gone.   She'll sight no stoush; an' so I have to take   Their mag, an' do a duck fer her sweet sake.    Fer 'er sweet sake I've gone and chucked it clean:     The pubs an' schools an' all that leery game.   Fer when a bloke 'as come to know Doreen,         It ain't the same.   There's 'igher things, she sez, for blokes to do.   An' I am 'arf believin' that it's true.    Yes, 'igher things--that wus the way she spoke;     An' when she looked at me I sorter felt   That bosker feelin' that comes o'er a bloke,         An' makes 'im melt;   Makes 'im all 'ot to maul 'er, an' to shove   'Is arms about'er...Bli'me? but it's love!    That's wot it is.  An' when a man 'as grown     Like that 'e gets a sorter yearn inside   To be a little 'ero on 'is own;         An' see the pride   Glow in the eyes of 'er 'e calls 'is queen;   An' 'ear 'er say 'e is a shine champeen.    \"I wish't yeh meant it,\" I can 'ear 'er yet,     My bit o' fluff!  The moon was shinin' bright,   Turnin' the waves all yeller where it set--         A bonzer night!   The sparklin' sea all sorter gold an' green;   An' on the pier the band--O, 'Ell!... Doreen!      V. The Play     \"Wots in a name?\" she sez...An' then she sighs,   An' clasps 'er little 'ands, an' rolls 'er eyes.   \"A rose,\" she sez, \"be any other name   Would smell the same.   Oh, w'erefore art you Romeo, young sir?   Chuck yer ole pot, an' change yer moniker!\"    Doreen an' me, we bin to see a show--   The swell two-dollar touch.  Bong tong, yeh know.   A chair apiece wiv velvit on the seat;   A slap-up treat.   The drarmer's writ be Shakespeare, years ago,   About a barmy goat called Romeo.    \"Lady, be yonder moon I swear!\" sez 'e.   An' then 'e climbs up on the balkiney;   An' there they smooge a treat, wiv pretty words   Like two love-birds.   I nudge Doreen.  She whispers, \"Ain't it grand!\"   'Er eyes is shinin'; an' I squeeze 'er 'and.    \"Wot's in a name?\" she sez.  'Struth, I dunno.   Billo is just as good as Romeo.   She may be Juli-er or Juli-et--   'E loves 'er yet.   If she's the tart 'e wants, then she's 'is queen,   Names never count...But ar, I like \"Doreen!\"    A sweeter, dearer sound I never 'eard;   Ther's music 'angs around that little word,   Doreen!...But wot was this I starts to say   About the play?   I'm off me beat.  But when a bloke's in love   'Is thorts turns 'er way, like a 'omin' dove.    This Romeo 'e's lurkin' wiv a crew--   A dead tough crowd o' crooks--called Montague.   'Is cliner's push--wot's nicknamed Capulet--   They 'as 'em set.   Fair narks they are, jist like them back-street clicks,   Ixcep' they fights wiv skewers 'stid o' bricks.    Wot's in a name?  Wot's in a string o' words?   They scraps in ole Verona with the'r swords,   An' never give a bloke a stray dog's chance,   An' that's Romance.   But when they deals it out wiv bricks an' boots   In Little Lon., they're low, degraded broots.    Wot's jist plain stoush wiv us, right 'ere to-day,   Is \"valler\" if yer fur enough away.   Some time, some writer bloke will do the trick   Wiv Ginger Mick,   Of Spadger's Lane.  'E'LL be a Romeo,   When 'e's bin dead five 'undred years or so.    Fair Juli-et, she gives 'er boy the tip.   Sez she: \"Don't sling that crowd o' mine no lip;   An' if you run agin a Capulet,   Jist do a get.\"   'E swears 'e's done wiv lash; 'e"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4730"],["title","The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke (#2)"],["body","'ll chuck it clean.   (Same as I done when I first met Doreen.)    They smooge some more at that.  Ar, strike me blue!   It gimme Joes to sit an' watch them two!   'E'd break away an' start to say good-bye,   An' then she'd sigh   \"Ow, Ro-me-o!\" an' git a strangle-holt,   An' 'ang around 'im like she feared 'e'd bolt.    Nex' day 'e words a gorspil cove about   A secret wedding; 'an they plan it out.   'E spouts a piece about 'ow 'e's bewitched:   Then they git 'itched.   Now, 'ere's the place where I fair git the pip!   She's 'is ofr keeps, an' yet 'e lets 'er slip!    Ar! but'e makes me sick! A fair gazob!   'E's jist the glarsey on the soulful sob,   'E'll sigh and spruik, an' 'owl a love-sick vow--   (The silly cow!)   But when 'e's got 'er, spliced an' on the straight   'E crools the pitch, an' tries to kid it's Fate.    Aw! Fate me foot!  Instid of slopin' soon   As 'e was wed, off on 'is 'oneymoon,   'Im an' 'is cobber, called Mick Curio,   They 'ave to go   An' mix it wiv that push o' Capulets.   They look fer trouble; an' it's wot they gets.    A tug named Tyball (cousin to the skirt)   Sprags 'em an' makes a start to sling off dirt.   Nex' minnit there's a reel ole ding-dong go--   'Arf round or so.   Mick Curio, 'e gets it in the neck,   \"Ar rats!\" 'e sez, an' passes in 'is check.    Quite natchril, Romeo gits wet as 'ell.   \"It's me or you!\" 'e 'owls, an' wiv a yell,   Plunks Tyball through the gizzard wiv 'is sword,   'Ow I ongcored!   \"Put in the boot!\" I sez.  \"Put in the boot!\"   \"'Ush!\" sez Doreen...\"Shame!\" sez some silly coot.    Then Romeo, 'e dunno wot to do.   The cops gits busy, like they allwiz do,   An' nose around until 'e gits blue funk   An' does a bunk.   They wants 'is tart to wed some other guy.   \"Ah, strike!\" she sez. \"I wish that I could die!\"    Now, this 'ere gorspil bloke's a fair shrewd 'ead.   Sez 'e \"I'll dope yeh, so they'll THINK yer dead.\"   (I tips 'e was a cunnin' sort, wot knoo   A thing or two.)   She takes 'is knock-out drops, up in 'er room:   They think she's snuffed, an' plant 'er in 'er tomb.    Then things gits mixed a treat an' starts to whirl.   'Ere's Romeo comes back an' finds 'is girl   Tucked in 'er little coffing, cold an' stiff,   An' in a jiff,   'E swallows lysol, throws a fancy fit,   'Ead over turkey, an' 'is soul 'as flit.    Then Juli-et wakes up an' sees 'im there,   Turns on the water-works an' tears 'er 'air,   \"Dear love,\" she sez, \"I cannot live alone!\"   An' wiv a moan,   She grabs 'is pockit knife, an' ends 'er cares...   _\"Peanuts or lollies!_\" sez a boy upstairs.      VI. The Stror 'at Coot     Ar, wimmin!  Wot a blinded fool I've been!     I arsts meself, wot else could I ixpeck?   I done me block complete on this Doreen,     An' now me 'eart is broke, me life's a wreck!   The dreams I dreamed, the dilly thorts I thunk   Is up the pole, an' joy 'as done a bunk.    Wimmin!  O strike!  I orter known the game!     Their tricks is crook, their arts is all dead snide.   The 'ole world over tarts is all the same;     All soft an' smilin' wiv no 'eart inside.   But she fair doped me wiv 'er winnin' ways,   Then crooled me pitch fer all me mortal days.    They're all the same!  A man 'as got to be     Stric' master if 'e wants to snare 'em sure.   'E 'as to take a stand an' let 'em see     That triflin' is a thing'e won't indure.   'E wants to show 'em that 'e 'olds command,   So they will smooge an' feed out of 'is 'and.    'E needs to make 'em feel 'e is the boss,     An' kid 'e's careless uv the joys they give.   'E 'as to make 'em think 'e'll feel no loss     To part wiv any tart 'e's trackin' wiv.   That all their pretty ways is crook pretence   Is plain to any bloke wiv common-sense.    But when the birds is nestin' in the spring,     An' when the soft green leaves is in the bud,   'E drops 'is bundle to some fluffy thing.     'E pays 'er 'omage--an' 'is name is Mud.   She plays wiv'im an' kids 'im on a treat,   Until she 'as 'im crawlin' at 'er feet.    An' then, when 'e's fair orf 'is top wiv love,     When she 'as got 'im good an' 'ad 'er fun,   She slings 'im over like a carst-orf glove,     To let the other tarts see wot she's done.   All vanity, deceit an' 'eartless kid!   I orter known; an', spare me days, I did!    I knoo.  But when I looked into 'er eyes--     Them shinin' eyes o' blue all soft wiv love   Wiv MIMIC love--they seemed to 'ipnertize.     I wus content to place 'er 'igh above.   I wus content to make of 'er a queen;   An' so she seemed them days...O, 'struth!...Doreen!    I knoo.  But when I stroked 'er glossy 'air     Wiv rev'rint 'ands, 'er cheek pressed close to mine,   Me lonely life seemed robbed of all its care;     I dreams me dreams, an' 'ope begun to shine.   An' when she 'eld 'er lips fer me to kiss...   Ar, wot's the use?  I'm done wiv all o' this!    Wimmin!...Oh, I ain't jealous!  Spare me days!     Me?  Jealous uv a knock-kneed coot like that!   'Im!  Wiv 'is cute stror 'at an' pretty ways!     I'd be a mug to squeal or whip the cat.   I'm glad, I am--glad 'cos I know I'm free!   There ain't no call to tork o' jealousy.    I tells meself I'm well out o' the game;     Fer look, I mighter married 'er-an' then....   Ar strike!  'Er voice wus music when my name     Wus on 'er lips on them glad ev'nin's when   We useter meet.  An' then to think she'd go...   No, I ain't jealous--but--Ar, I dunno!    I took a derry on this stror 'at coot     First time I seen 'im dodgin' round Doreen.   'Im, wiv 'is giddy tie an' Yankee soot,     Ferever yappin' like a tork-machine   About \"The Hoffis\" where 'e 'ad a grip....   The way 'e smiled at 'er give me the pip!    She sez I stoushed 'im, when I promised fair     To chuck it, even to a friendly spar.   Stoushed 'im!  I never roughed 'is pretty 'air!     I only spanked 'im gentle, fer 'is mar.   If I'd 'a' jabbed 'im once, there would 'a' been   An inquest; an' I sez so to Doreen.    I mighter took an' cracked 'im in the street,     When she was wiv 'im there lars' Fridee night.   But don't I keep me temper when we met?     An' don't I raise me lid an' act perlite?   I only jerks me elbow in 'is ribs,   To give the gentle office to 'is nibs.    Stoushed 'im!  I owns I met 'im on the quiet,     An' worded 'im about a small affair;   An' when 'e won't put up 'is 'ands to fight--     ('E sez, \"Fer public brawls 'e didn't care\")--   I lays 'im 'cross me knee, the mother's joy,   An' smacks 'im 'earty, like a naughty boy.    An' now Doreen she sez I've broke me vow,     An' mags about this coot's pore, \"wounded pride.\"   An' then, o' course, we 'as a ding-dong row,     Wiv 'ot an' stormy words on either side.   She sez I done it outer jealousy,   An' so, we parts fer ever--'er an' me.    Me jealous?  Jealous of that cross-eyed cow!     I set 'im 'cos I couldn't sight 'is face.   'Is yappin' fair got on me nerves, some'ow.     I couldn't stand 'im 'angin' round 'er place.   A coot like that!...But it don't matter much,   She's welkim to 'im if she fancies such.    I swear I'll never track wiv 'er no more;     I'll never look on 'er side o' the street--   Unless she comes an' begs me pardin for     Them things she said to me in angry 'eat.   She can't ixpeck fer me to smooge an' crawl.   I ain't at ANY woman's beck an' call.    Wimmin!  I've took a tumble to their game.     I've got the 'ole bang tribe o' cliners set!   The 'ole world over they are all the same:     Crook to the core the bunch of 'em--an' yet   We could 'a' been that 'appy, 'er an' me...   But, wot's it matter?  Ain't I glad I'm free?    A bloke wiv commin-sense 'as got to own     There's little 'appiness in married life.   The smoogin' game is better left alone,     Fer tarts is few that makes the ideel wife.   An' them's the sort that loves wivout disguise,   An' thinks the sun shines in their 'usban's' eyes.    But when the birds is matin' in the spring,     An' when the tender leaves begin to bud,   A feelin' comes--a dilly sorter thing   That seems to sorter swamp 'im like a flood.   An' when the fever 'ere inside 'im burns,   Then freedom ain't the thing fer wot 'e yearns.    But I 'ave chucked it all.  An' yet--I own     I dreams me dreams when soft Spring breezes stirs;   An' often, when I'm moonin' 'ere alone,     A lispin' maid, wiv 'air an' eyes like 'ers,   'Oo calls me \"dad,\" she climbs upon me knee,   An' yaps 'er pretty baby tork to me.    I sorter see a little 'ouse, it seems,     Wiv someone waitin' for me at the gate...   Ar, where's the sense in dreamin' barmy dreams,     I've dreamed before, and nearly woke too late.   Sich 'appiness could never last fer long,   We're strangers--'less she owns that she was wrong.    To call 'er back I'll never lift a 'and;     She'll never 'ear frum me by word or sign.   Per'aps, some day, she'll come to understand     The mess she's made o' this 'ere life o' mine.   Oh, I ain't much to look at, I admit.   But'im!  The knock-kneed, swivel-eyed misfit?...      VII. The Siren     She sung a song; an' I sat silent there,   Wiv bofe 'ands grippin' 'ard on me chair;     Me 'eart, that yesterdee I thort wus broke   Wiv 'umpin sich a 'eavy load o' care,     Come swelling in me throat like I would choke.   I felt 'ot blushes climbin' to me 'air.    'Twas like that feelin' when the Spring wind breaves   Sad music in the sof'ly rustlin' leaves.     An' when a bloke sits down an' starts to chew   Crook thorts, wivout quite knowin' why 'e grieves     Fer things 'e's done 'e didn't ort to do--   Fair winded wiv the 'eavy sighs 'e 'eaves.    She sung a song; an' orl at once I seen   The kind o' crool an' 'eartless broot I been.     In ev'ry word I read it like a book--   The slanter game I'd played wiv my Doreen--     I 'eard it in 'er song; an' in 'er look   I seen wot made me feel fair rotten mean.    Poor, 'urt Doreen!  My tender bit o' fluff!   Ar, men don't understand; they're fur too rough;     Their ways is fur too coarse wiv lovin' tarts;   They never gives 'e"]]]
