Judy always mystified him.  He understood her the least of any of his children, and sometimes the thought of her worried him.  At present she was only a sharp, clever, and frequently impertinent child; but he felt she was utterly different from the other six, and it gave him an aggrieved kind of feeling when he thought about it, which was not very often.  He remembered her own mother had often said she trembled for Judy's future.  That restless fire of hers that shone out of her dancing eyes, and glowed scarlet on her cheeks in excitement, and lent amazing energy and activity to her young, lithe body, would either make a noble, daring, brilliant woman of her, or else she would be shipwrecked on rocks the others would never come to, and it would flame up higher and higher and consume her.  \"Be careful of Judy\" had been almost the last words of the anxious mother when, in the light that comes when the world's is going out, she had seen with terrible clearness the stones and briars in the way of that particular pair of small, eager feet.  And she had died, and Judy was stumbling right amongst them now, and her father could not \"be careful\" of her because he absolutely did not know how.  As he went up the veranda steps again and through the hall, he was wishing almost prayerfully she had not been cast in so different a mould from the others, wishing he could stamp out that strange flame in her that made him so uneasy at times.  He gave a great puff at his cigar, and sighed profoundly; then he turned on his heel and went off toward the stables to forget it all.  The man was away, exercising one of the horses in the long paddock; but there was something stirring in the harness-room, so he went in.  There was a little, dripping wet figure standing over a great bucket, and dipping something in and out with charming vigour. At the sound of his footsteps, Baby turned round and lifted a perspiring little face to his.  \"I'se washing the kitsies for you, and Flibberty-Gibbet,\" she said beamingly.  He took a horrified step forward.  There were two favourite kittens of his, shivering, miserable, up to their necks in a lather of soapy water; and Flibberty-Gibbet, the beautiful little fox terrier he had just bought for his wife, chained to a post, also wet, miserable, and woebegone, also undergoing the cleansing process, and being scrubbed and swilled till his very reason was tottering.  \"They'se SO clean and nicey--no horrid ole fleas 'n them now. AREN't you glad?  You can let Flibberty go on your bed now, and Kitsy Blackeye is--\"  Poor Baby never finished her speech.  She had a confused idea of hearing a little \"swear-word\" from her father, of being shaken in a most ungentle fashion and put outside the stable, while the unfortunate animals were dried and treated with great consideration.  But the worst was yet to come, and the results were so exceedingly bad that the young Woolcots determined never again to assume virtues that they had not.  Bunty, of course, desired to help the cause as strongly as the others, and to that end his first action was to go into his bedroom and perform startling ablutions with his face, neck, and hands.  Then he took his soap-shiny countenance and red, much bescrubbed hands downstairs, and sunned himself under his father's very nose, hoping to attract favourable comment.  But he was bidden irritably \"go and play,\" and saw he would have to find fresh means of appeasement.  He wandered into the study, with vague thoughts of tidying the tidy bookshelves; but Pip was there, surrounded with books and whittling a stick for a catapult, so he went out again. Then he climbed the stairs and explored his father's bedroom and dressing-room.  In the latter there was a wide field for his operations.  A full-dress uniform was lying across a chair, and it struck Bunty the gold buttons were looking less bright than they should, so he spent a harmless quarter of an hour in polishing them up.  Next, he burnished some spurs, which also was harmless. Then he cast about for fresh employment.  There was quite a colony of dusty boots in one corner of the room, and there was a great bottle of black, treacly looking varnish on the mantelpiece.  Bunty conceived the brilliant idea of cleaning the whole lot and standing them in a neat row to meet his father's delighted eyes.  He found a handkerchief on the floor, of superfine cambric, though dirty, poured upon it a liberal allowance of varnish, and attacked the first pair.  A bright polish rewarded him, for they were patent leather ones; but the next and the next and the next would not shine, however hard he rubbed.  There was a step on the stair, the firm, well-known step of his father, and he paused a moment with a look of conscious virtue on his small shiny face.  But it fled all at once, and a look of horror replaced it.  He had stuck the bottle on a great armchair for convenience, as he was sitting on the floor, and now he noticed it had fallen on its side and a black, horrid stream was issuing from its neck.  And it was the chair with the uniform on, and one of the sleeves was soaked with the stuff, and the beautiful white shirt that lay there, too, waiting for a button, was sticky, horrible! Bunty gave a wild, terrified look round the room for some place to efface himself, but there were no sheltering corners or curtains, and there was not time to get into the bedroom and under the bed. Near the window was a large-sized medicine chest, and in despair Bunty crushed himself into it, his legs huddled up, his head between his knees, and an ominous rattle of displaced bottles in his ears.  The next minute his father was in the room.  \"Great Heavens!  God bless my soul!\" he said, and Bunty shivered from head to foot.  Then he said a lot of things very quickly--\"foreign language\" as Judy called it; kicked something over, and shouted \"Esther!\" in a terrifying tone.  But Esther was down in one of the paddocks with the General, so there was no reply.  More foreign language, more stomping about.  Bunty's teeth chattered noisily; he put up his hand to hold his mouth together, and the cupboard, overbalanced, fell right over, precipitating its occupant right at his father's feet, and the bottles everywhere.  \"I didn't--I haven't--'twasn't me--'twasn't my fault!\" he howled, backing towards the door.  \"Hoo--yah--boo-hoo-ooo! Esther--boo--yah--Judy--oh--oh--h! oh--oh--h--h--h--h!\" As might be expected, his father had picked up a strap that lay conveniently near, and was giving his son a very fair taste of it.  \"Oh--h--h--h! o--o--h! o--o--h! ah--h--h! 'twasn't me--'twasn't my fault--its Pip and Judy--oh--h--h--h! hoo--the pant'mime! boo-hoo! ah--h--h--h--you're killing me! hoo-boo! I was only d--doin' it--oh--hoo--ah--h--h! d--oin' it to p--please--boo--oo--oo! to p--please you!\"  His father paused with uplifted strap.  \"And that's why all the others are behaving in so strange a fashion?  Just for me to take them to the pantomime?\"  Bunty wriggled himself free.  \"Boo--hoo--yes! but not me--I didn't--I never--true's faith--oh-h-h-hoo-yah! it wasn't my fault, it's all the others--boo--hoo--hoo! hit them the rest.\"  He got three more smart cuts, and then fled howling and yelling to the nursery, where he fell on the floor and kicked and rolled about as if he were half killed.  \"You sn--n--n--n--neaks!\" he sobbed, addressing the others, who had flown from all parts at his noisy outcry, \"you m-m--mean p--p--p--pigs! I h--hadn't n--n--no fo--o--ow-l, and I've h--h--had all the b--b--b--beating! y--you s--s--sn--n-neaks! oh--h--h--h! ah--h--h--h! oh--h--h--h! oh--h--h-h! I'm b--b--bleeding all over, I kno--o--o--ow!\"  They couldn't help laughing a bit; Bunty was always so irresistibly comic when he was hurt ever so little; but still they comforted him as well as they could, and tried to find out what had happened.  Esther came in presently, looking very worried.  \"Well?\" they said in a breath.  \"You really are the most exasperating children,\" she said vexedly.  \"But the pantomime--quick, Esther--have you asked him?\" they cried impatiently.  \"The pantomime!  He says he would rather make it worth Mr. Rignold's while to take it off the boards than that one of you should catch a glimpse of it--and it serves you very well right! Meg, for goodness' sake give Baby some dry clothes--just look at her; and, Judy, if you have any feeling for me, take off that frock.  Bunty, you wicked boy, I'll call your father if you don't stop that noise.  Nell, take the scissors from the General, he'll poke his eyes out, bless him.\"  The young stepmother leaned back in her chair and looked round her tragically.  She had never seen her husband so thoroughly angered, and her beautiful lips quivered when she remembered how he had seemed to blame her for it all.  Meg hadn't moved; the water was trickling slowly off Baby's clothes and making a pool on the floor, Bunty was still giving vent to spasmodic boos and hoos, Judy was whistling stormily, and the General, mulcted of the scissors, was licking his own muddy shoe all over with his dear little red tongue.  A sob rose in her throat, two tears welled up in her eyes and fell down her smooth, lovely cheeks.  \"Seven of you, and I'm only twenty!\" she said pitifully.  \"Oh! it's too bad--oh dear! it is too bad.\"     CHAPTER IV  The General Sees Active Service     \"My brain it teems     With endless schemes,     Both good and new.\"   It was a day after \"the events narrated in the last chapter,\" as story-book parlance has it.  And Judy, with a wrathful look in her eyes, was sitting on the nursery table, her knees touching her chin and her thin brown hands clasped round them.  \"It's a shame,\" she said, \"it's a burning, wicked shame! What's the use of fathers in the world, I'd like to know!\"  \"Oh, Judy!\" said Meg, who was curled up in an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],["title","Seven Little Australians (#4)"],["body","armchair, deep in a book.  But she said it mechanically, and only as a matter of duty, being three years older than Judy.  \"Think of the times we could have if he didn't live with us,\" Judy continued, calmly disregardful.  \"Why, we'd have fowl three times a day, and the pantomime seven nights a week.\"  Nell suggested that it was not quite usual to have pantomimic performances on the seventh day, but Judy was not daunted.  \"I'd have a kind of church pantomime,\" she said thoughtfully--\"beautiful pictures and things about the Holy Land, and the loveliest music, and beautiful children in white, singing hymns, and bright colours all about, and no collection plates to take your only threepenny bit--oh! and no sermons or litanies, of course.\"  \"Oh, Judy!\" murmured Meg, turning a leaf.  Judy unclasped her hands, and then clasped them again more tightly than before. \"Six whole tickets wasted--thirty beautiful shillings--just because we have a father!\"  \"He sent them to the Digby-Smiths,\" Bunty volunteered, \"and wrote on the envelope, 'With compts. J. C. Woolcot.'\"  Judy moaned.  \"Six horrid little Digby-Smiths sitting in the theatre watching our fun with their six horrid little eyes,\" she said bitterly.  Bunty, who was mathematically inclined, wanted to know why they wouldn't look at it through their twelve horrid little eyes, and Judy laughed and came down from the table, after expressing a wicked wish that the little Digby-Smiths might all tumble over the dress-circle rail before the curtain rose.  Meg shut her book with a hurried bang.  \"Has Pip gone yet?  Father'll be awfully cross.  Oh dear, what a head I've got!\" she said.  \"Where's Esther?  Has anyone seen Esther?\"  \"My DEAR Meg!\" Judy said; \"why, it's at least two hours since Esther went up the drive before your very nose.  She's gone to Waverly--why, she came in and told you, and said she trusted you to see about the coat, and you said, 'M--'m! all right.'\"  Meg gave a startled look of recollection.  \"Did I have to clean it?\" she asked in a frightened tone, and pushing her fair hair back from her forehead.  \"Oh, girls! what WAS it I had to do?\"  \"Clean with benzine, iron while wet, put in a cool place to keep warm, and bake till brown,\" said Judy promptly.  \"SURELY you heard, Margaret?  Esther was at such pains to explain.\"  Meg ruffled her hair again despairingly.  \"What shall I do?\" she said, actual tears springing to her eyes.  \"What will Father say?  Oh, Judy, you might have reminded me.\"  Nell slipped an arm round her neck.  \"She's only teasing, Megsie; Esther did it and left it ready in the hall--you've only to give it to Pip.  Pat has to take the dogcart into town this afternoon to have the back seat mended, and Pip's going in it, too, that's all, and they're putting the horse in now; you're not late.\"  It was the coat Bunty had done his best to spoil that all the trouble was about.  It belonged, as I said, to the Captain's full-dress uniform, and was wanted for a dinner at the Barracks this same evening.  And Esther had been sponging and cleaning at it all the morning, and had left directions that it was to be taken to the Barracks in the afternoon.  Presently the dogcart came spinning round to the door in great style, Pip driving and Pat looking sulkily on.  They took the coat parcel and put it carefully under the seat, and were preparing to start again, when Judy came out upon the veranda, holding the General in an uncomfortable position in her arms.  \"You come, too, Fizz, there's heaps of room--there's no reason you shouldn't,\" Pip said suddenly.  \"Oh--h--h!\" said Judy, her eyes sparkling.  She took a rapid step forward and lifted her foot to get in.  \"Oh, I say!\" remonstrated Pip, \"you'll have to put on something over that dress, old girl--it's all over jam and things.\"  Judy shot herself into the hall and returned with her ulster; she set the General on the floor for a minute while she donned it, then picked him up and handed him up to Pip.  \"He'll have to come, too,\" she said; \"I promised Esther I wouldn't let him out of my sight for a minute; she's getting quite nervous about him lately--thinks he'll get broken.\"  Pip grumbled a minute or two, but the General gave a gurgling, captivating laugh and held up his arms, so he took him up and held him while Judy clambered in.  \"We can come back in the tram to the Quay, and then get a boat back,\" she said, squeezing the baby on the seat between them. \"The General loves going on the water.\"  Away they sped; down the neglected carriage drive, out of the gates, and away down the road.  Pip, Judy of the shining eyes, the General devouring his thumb, and Pat smiling-faced once more because in possession of the reins.  A wind from the river swept through the belt of gum trees on the Crown lands, and sent the young red blood leaping through their veins; it played havoc with Judy's curls, and dyed her brown cheeks a warm red; it made the General kick and laugh and grow restive, and caused Pip to stick his hat on the back of his head and whistle joyously.  Until town was reached, when they were forced to yield somewhat to the claims of conventionality.  On the way to Paddington a gentleman on horseback slackened pace a little. Pip took off his hat with a flourish, and Judy gave a frank, pleased smile, for it was a certain old Colonel they had known for years, and had cause to remember his good-humour and liberality.  \"Well, my little maid--well, Philip, lad,\" he said, smiling genially, while his horse danced round the dogcart--\"and the General too--where are you all off to?\"  \"The Barracks--I'm taking something up for the governor,\" Pip answered, Judy was watching the plunging horse with admiring eyes. \"And then we're going back home.\"  The old gentleman managed, in spite of the horse's tricks, to slip his hand in his pocket.  \"Here's something to make yourselves ill with on the way,\" he said, handing them two half-crowns; \"but don't send me the doctor's bill.\"  He flicked the General's cheek with his whip, gave Judy a nod, and cantered off.  The children looked at each other with sparkling eyes.  \"Coconuts,\" Pip said, \"and tarts and toffee, and save the rest for a football?\"  Judy shook her head.  \"Where do I come in?\" she said. \"You'd keep the football at school.  I vote pink jujubes, and icecreams, and a wax doll.\"  \"A wax grandmother!\" Pip retorted; \"you wouldn't be such a girl, I hope.\"  Then he added, with almost pious fervour, \"Thank goodness you've always hated dolls, Fizz.\"  Judy gave a sudden leap in her seat, almost upsetting the General, and bringing down upon her head a storm of reproaches from the coachman.  \"I know!\" she said; \"and we're almost halfway there now.  Oh--h--h! it will be lovely.\"  Pip urged her to explain herself.  \"Bondi Aquarium--skating, boats, merry-go-round, switchback threepence a go!\" she returned succinctly.  \"Good iron,\" Pip whispered softly, while he revolved the thing in his mind.  \"There'd be something over, too, to get some tucker with, and perhaps something for the football, too.\"  Then his brow clouded.  \"There's the kid--whatever did you go bringing him for?  Just like a girl to spoil everything!\" Judy looked nonplussed.  \"I quite forgot him,\" she said, vexedly.  \"Couldn't we leave him somewhere?  Couldn't we ask someone to take care of him while we go?  Oh, it would be TOO bad to have to give it up just because of him.  It's beginning to rain, too; we couldn't take him with us.\"  They were at the foot of Barrack Hill now, and Pat told them they must get out and walk the rest of the way up, or he would never get the dogcart finished to take back that evening.  Pip tumbled out and took the General, all in a bunched-up heap, and Judy alighted carefully after him, the precious coat parcel in her arms.  And they walked up the asphalt hill to the gate leading to the officers' quarters in utter silence.  \"Well?\" Pip said querulously, as they reached the top.  \"Be quick; haven't you thought of anything?\"  That levelling of brows, and pursing of lips, always meant deep and intricate calculation on his sister's part, as he knew full well.  \"Yes,\" Judy said quietly.  \"I've got a plan that will do, I think.\" Then a sudden fire entered her manner.  \"Who is the General's father?  Tell me that,\" she said, in a rapid, eager way; \"and isn't it right and proper fathers should look after their sons?  And doesn't he deserve we should get even with him for doing us out of the pantomime?  And isn't the Aquarium too lovely to miss?\"  \"Well?\"  Pip said; his slower brain did not follow such rapid reasoning.  \"Only I'm going to leave the General here at the Barracks for a couple of hours till we come back, his father being the proper person to watch over him.\"  Judy grasped the General's small. fat hand in a determined way, and opened the gate.  \"Oh, I say,\" remarked Pip, \"we'll get in an awful row, you know, Fizz.  I don't think we'd better--I don't really, old girl.\"  \"Not a bit,\" said Judy, stoutly--\"at least, only a bit, and the Aquarium's worth that.  Look how it's raining; the child will get croup, or rheumatism, or something if we take him; there's Father standing over on the green near the tennis-court talking to a man.  I'll slip quietly along the veranda and into his own room, and put the coat and the General on the bed; then I'll tell a soldier to go and tell Father his parcels have come; and while he's gone I'll fly back to you, and we'll catch the tram and go to the Aquarium.\"  Pip whistled again softly.  He was used to bold proposals from this sister of his, but this was beyond everything.  \"B--b--but,\" he said uneasily, \"but, Judy, whatever would he do with that kid for two mortal hours?\"  \"Mind him,\" Judy returned promptly.  \"It's a pretty thing if a father can't mind his own child for two hours.  Afterwards, you see, when we've been to the Aquarium, we will come back and fetch him, and we can explain to Father how it was raining, and that we thought we'd better not take"]]]
