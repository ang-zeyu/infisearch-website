Mrs. Crump looked disappointed.  “Surely,” she said, with a sudden sinking of heart, “you have not come to take her away?”  “This letter will explain my object in visiting you,” said the woman, drawing a sealed envelope from a bag which she carried on her arm.  The cooper's wife nervously broke open the letter, and read as follows:--  “MRS. CRUMP;  “Eight years ago last New Year's night, a child was left on your door-steps, with a note containing a request that you would care for it kindly as your own. Money was sent, at the same time, to defray the expenses of such care. The writer of this note is the mother of the child Ida. There is no need to say, here, why I sent the child away from me. You will easily understand that only the most imperative circumstances would have led me to such a step. Those circumstances still prevent me from reclaiming the child, and I am content, still, to leave Ida in your charge. Yet, there is one thing of which I am desirous. You will understand a mother's desire to see, face to face, the child who belongs, of right, to her. With this view, I have come to this neighborhood. I will not say where, for concealment is necessary to me. I send this note by a trustworthy attendant,--Mrs. Hardwick, my little Ida's nurse in her infancy,--who will conduct Ida to me, and return her again to you. Ida is not to know whom she is visiting. No doubt she believes you her mother, and it is well. Tell her only, that it is a lady who takes an interest in her, and that will satisfy her childish curiosity. I make this request as  “IDA'S MOTHER.”  Mrs. Crump read this letter with mingled feelings. Pity for the writer; a vague curiosity in regard to the mysterious circumstances which had compelled her to resort to such a step; a half feeling of jealousy, that there should be one who had a claim to her dear adopted daughter superior to her own; and a strong feeling of relief at the assurance that Ida was not to be permanently removed,--all these feelings affected the cooper's wife.  “So you were Ida's nurse,” she said, gently.  “Yes, ma'am,” said the stranger. “I hope the dear child is well.”  “Perfectly well. How much her mother must have suffered from the separation!”  “Indeed, you may say so, ma'am. It came near to break her heart.”  “So it must,” said sympathizing Mrs. Crump. “There is one thing I would like to ask,” she continued, hesitating and reddening. “Don't answer it unless you please. Was--is Ida the child of shame?”  “She is not,” answered the nurse.  Mrs. Crump looked relieved. It removed a thought from her mind which would now and then intrude, though it had never, for an instant, lessened her affection for the child.  At this point in the conversation, the cooper entered the house. He had just come home on an errand.  “It is my husband,” said Mrs. Crump, turning to her visitor, by way of explanation. “Timothy, will you come in a moment?”  Mr. Crump regarded his wife's visitor with some surprise. His wife hastened to introduce her as Mrs. Hardwick, Ida's nurse, and handed to the astonished cooper the letter which the latter had brought with her.  He was not a rapid reader, and it took him some time to get through the letter. He laid it down on his knee, and looked thoughtful. The nurse regarded him with a slight uneasiness.  “This is, indeed, unexpected,” he said, at last. “It is a new development in Ida's history. May I ask, Mrs. Hardwick, if you have any further proof. I want to be prudent with a child that I love as my own,--if you have any further proof that you are what you claim to be?”  “I judged that this letter would be sufficient,” said the nurse; moving a little in her chair.  “True; but how can we be sure that the writer is Ida's mother?”  “The tone of the letter, sir. Would anybody else write like that?”  “Then you have read the letter?” said the cooper, quickly.  “It was read to me, before I set out.”  “By----”  “By Ida's mother. I do not blame you for your caution,” she continued. “You must be so interested in the happiness of the dear child of whom you have taken such (sic) excelent care, I don't mind telling you that I was the one who left her at your door eight years ago, and that I never left the neighborhood until I found that you had taken her in.”  “And it was this, that enabled you to find the house, to-day.”  “You forget,” said the nurse, “that you were not then living in this house, but in another, some rods off, on the left-hand side of the street.”  “You are right,” said the cooper. “I am disposed to believe in the genuineness of your claim. You must pardon my testing you in such a manner, but I was not willing to yield up Ida, even for a little time, without feeling confident of the hands she was falling into.”  “You are right,” said the nurse. “I don't blame you in the least. I shall report it to Ida's mother, as a proof of your attachment to your child.”  “When do you wish Ida to go with you?” asked Mrs. Crump.  “Can you let her go this afternoon?”  “Why,” said Mrs. Crump, hesitating, “I should like to have a chance to wash out some clothes for her. I want her to appear as neat a possible, when she meets her mother.”  The nurse hesitated.  “I do not wish to hurry you. If you will let me know when she will be ready, I will call for her.”  “I think I can get her ready early to-morrow morning.”  “That will answer excellently. I will call for her then.”  The nurse rose, and gathered her shawl about her.  “Where are you going, Mrs. Hardwick?” asked the cooper's wife.  “To a hotel,” was the reply.  “We cannot allow that,” said Mrs. Crump, kindly. “It is a pity if we cannot accommodate Ida's old nurse for one night, or ten times as long, for that matter.”  “My wife is quite right,” said the cooper; “we must insist upon your stopping with us.”  The nurse hesitated, and looked irresolute. It was plain she would have preferred to be elsewhere, but a remark which Mrs. Crump made, decided her to accept the invitation.  It was this. “You know, Mrs. Hardwick, if Ida is to go with you, she ought to have a little chance to get acquainted with you before you go.”  “I will accept your kind invitation,” she said; “but I am afraid I shall be in your way.”  “Not in the least. It will be a pleasure to us to have you here. If you will excuse me now, I will go out and attend to my dinner, which I am afraid is getting behindhand.”  Left to herself, the nurse behaved in a manner which might be regarded as singular. She rose from her seat, and approached the mirror. She took a full survey of herself as she stood there, and laughed a short, hard laugh.  Then she made a formal courtesy to her own reflection, saying, “How do you do, Mrs. Hardwick?”  “Did you speak?” asked the cooper, who was passing through the entry on his way out.  “No,” said the nurse, a little awkwardly. “I believe I said something to myself. It's of no consequence.”  “Somehow,” thought the cooper, “I don't fancy the woman's looks, but I dare say I am prejudiced. We're all of us as God made us.”  While Mrs. Crump was making preparations for the noon-day meal, she imparted to Rachel the astonishing information, which has already been detailed to the reader.  “I don't believe a word of it,” said Rachel, resolutely.  “She's an imposter. I knew she was the very first moment I set eyes on her.”  This remark was so characteristic of Rachel, that Mrs. Crump did not attach any special importance to it. Rachel, of course, had no grounds for the opinion she so confidently expressed. It was consistent, however, with her general estimate of human nature.  “What object could she have in inventing such a story?”  “What object? Hundreds of 'em,” said Rachel, rather indefinitely. “Mark my words, if you let her carry off Ida, it'll be the last you'll ever see of her.”  “Try to look on the bright side, Rachel. Nothing is more natural than that her mother should want to see her.”  “Why couldn't she come herself?” muttered Rachel.  “The letter explains.”  “I don't see that it does.”  “It says that the same reasons exist for concealment as ever.”  “And what are they, I should like to know? I don't like mysteries, for my part.”  “We won't quarrel with them, at any rate, since they enable us to keep Ida with us.”  Aunt Rachel shook her head, as if she were far from satisfied.  “I don't know,” said Mrs. Crump, “but I ought to invite Mrs. Hardwick in here. I have left her alone in the front room.”  “I don't want to see her,” said Aunt Rachel. Then changing her mind, suddenly, “Yes, you may bring her in. I'll find out whether she is an imposter or not.”  Mrs. Crump returned with the nurse. “Mrs. Hardwick,” said she, “this is my sister, Miss Rachel Crump.”  “I am glad to make your acquaintance, ma'am,” said the nurse.  “Aunt Rachel, I will leave you to entertain Mrs. Hardwick,” said Mrs. Crump. “I am obliged to be in the kitchen.”  Rachel and the nurse eyed each other with mutual dislike.  “I hope you don't expect me to entertain you,” said Rachel. “I never expect to entertain anybody again. This is a world of trial and tribulation, and I've had my share. So you've come after Ida, I hear?”  with a sudden change of subject.  “At her mother's request,” said the nurse.  “She wants to see her, then?”  “Yes, ma'am.”  “I wonder she didn't think of it before,” said Aunt Rachel, sharply. “She's good at waiting. She's waited eight years.”  “There are circumstances that cannot be explained,” commenced the nurse.  “No, I dare say not,” said Rachel, dryly. “So you were her nurse?”  “Yes, ma'am,” said Mrs. Hardwick, who evidently did not relish this cross-examination.  “Have you lived with the mother ever since?”  “No,--yes,” stammered the nurse. “Some of the time,” she added, recovering herself.  “Umph!” grunted Rachel, darting a sharp glance at her.  “Have you a husband living?” inquired Rachel, after a pause.  “Yes,” said Mrs. Hardwick. “Have"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4660"],["title","Timothy Crump's Ward: A Story of American Life (#7)"],["body","ou?”  “I!” repeated Aunt Rachel, scornfully. “No, neither living nor dead. I'm thankful to say I never married. I've had trials enough without that. Does Ida's mother live in the city?”  “I can't tell you,” said the nurse.  “Humph, I don't like mystery.”  “It isn't my mystery,” said the nurse. “If you have any objection to make against it, you must make it to Ida's mother.”  The two were not likely to get along very amicably. Neither was gifted with the best of tempers, and perhaps it was as well that there should have been an interruption as there was.    CHAPTER IX. A JOURNEY.    “OH, mother,” exclaimed Ida, bounding into the room, fresh from school.  She stopped short, in some confusion, on seeing a stranger.  “Is this my own dear child, over whose infancy I watched so tenderly?”  exclaimed the nurse, rising, her harsh features wreathed into a smile.  “It is Ida,” said Mrs. Crump.  Ida looked from one to the other in silent bewilderment.  “Ida,” said Mrs. Crump, in a little embarrassment, “this is Mrs. Hardwick, who took care of you when you were an infant.”  “But I thought you took care of me, mother,” said Ida, in surprise.  “Very true,” said Mrs. Crump, evasively, “but I was not able to have the care of you all the time. Didn't I ever mention Mrs. Hardwick to you?”  “No, mother.”  “Although it is so long since I have seen her, I should have known her anywhere,” said the nurse, applying a handkerchief to her eyes. “So pretty as she's grown up, too!”  Mrs. Crump, who, as has been said, was devotedly attached to Ida, glanced with pride at the beautiful child, who blushed at the compliment.  “Ida,” said Mrs. Hardwick, “won't you come and kiss your old nurse?”  Ida looked at the hard face, which now wore a smile intended to express affection. Without knowing why, she felt an instinctive repugnance to her, notwithstanding her words of endearment.  She advanced timidly, with a reluctance which she was not wholly able to conceal, and passively submitted to a caress from the nurse.  There was a look in the eyes of the nurse, carefully guarded, yet not wholly concealed, which showed that she was quite aware of Ida's feeling towards her, and resented it. But whether or not she was playing a part, she did not betray this feeling openly, but pressed the unwilling child more closely to her bosom.  Ida breathed a sigh of relief when she was released, and walked quietly away, wondering what it was that made her dislike the woman so much.  “Is my nurse a good woman?” she asked, thoughtfully, when alone with Mrs. Crump, who was setting the table for dinner.  “A good woman! What makes you ask that?” queried her adopted mother, in surprise.  “I don't know,” said Ida.  “I don't know anything to indicate that she is otherwise,” said Mrs. Crump. “And, by the way, Ida, she is going to take you on a little excursion, to-morrow.”  “She going to take me?” exclaimed Ida. “Why, where are we going?”  “On a little pleasure trip, and perhaps she may introduce you to a pleasant lady, who has already become interested in you, from what she has told her.”  “What could she say of me?” inquired Ida, “she has not seen me since I was a baby.”  “Why,” said the cooper's wife a little puzzled, “she appears to have thought of you ever since, with a good deal of affection.”  “Is it wicked,” asked Ida, after a pause, “not to like those that like us?”  “What makes you ask?”  “Because, somehow or other, I don't like this Mrs. Hardwick at all, for all she was my old nurse, and I don't believe ever shall.”  “Oh yes, you will,” said Mrs. Crump, “when you find she is exerting herself to give you pleasure.”  “Am I going to-morrow morning with Mrs. Hardwick?”  “Yes. She wanted you to go to-day, but your clothes were not in order.”  “We shall come back at night, sha'n't we?”  “I presume so.”  “I hope we shall,” said Ida, decidedly, “and that she won't want me to go with her again.”  “Perhaps you will think differently when it is over, and you find you have enjoyed yourself better than you anticipated.”  Mrs. Crump exerted herself to fit Ida up as neatly as possible, and when at length she was got ready, she thought to herself, with sudden fear, “Perhaps her mother won't be willing to part with her again.”  When Ida was ready to start, there came over all a little shadow of depression, as if the child were to be separated from them for a year, and not for a day only. Perhaps this was only natural, since even this latter term, however brief, was longer than they had been parted from her since, an infant, she was left at their door.  The nurse expressly desired that none of the family should accompany her, as she declared it highly important that the whereabouts of Ida's mother should not be known at once. “Of course,” she said, “after Ida returns, she can tell you what she pleases. Then it will be of no consequence, for her mother will be gone. She does not live in this neighborhood; she has only come here to have an interview with Ida.”  “Shall you bring her back to-night?” asked Mrs. Crump.  “I may keep her till to-morrow,” said the nurse. “After eight years' absence, that will seem short enough.”  To this, Mrs. Crump agreed, but thought that it would seem long to her, she had been so accustomed to have Ida present at meals.  The nurse walked as far as Broadway, holding Ida by the hand.  “Where are we going?” asked the child, timidly. “Are we going to walk all the way?”  “No,” said the nurse, “we shall ride. There is an omnibus coming now. We will get into it.”  She beckoned to the driver who stopped his horse. Ida and her companion got in.  They got out at the Jersey City ferry.  “Did you ever ride in a steamboat?” asked Mrs. Hardwick, in a tone intended to be gracious.  “Once or twice,” said Ida. “I went with brother Jack once, over to Hoboken. Are we going there, now?”  “No, we are going over to the city, you can see over the water.”  “What is it? Is it Brooklyn?”  “No, it is Jersey City.”  “Oh, that will be pleasant,” said Ida, forgetting, in her childish love of novelty, the repugnance with which the nurse had inspired her.  “Yes, and that is not all; we are going still further,” said the nurse.  “Are we going further?” asked Ida, her eyes sparkling. “Where are we going?”  “To a town on the line of the railroad.”  “And shall we ride in the cars?” asked the child, with animation.  “Yes, didn't you ever ride in the cars before?”  “No, never.”  “I think you will like it.”  “Oh, I know I shall. How fast do the cars go?”  “Oh, a good many miles an hour,--maybe thirty.”  “And how long will it take us to go to the place you are going to carry me to!”  “I don't know exactly,--perhaps two hours.”  “Two whole hours in the cars!” exclaimed Ida. “How much I shall have to tell father and Jack when I get back.”  “So you will,” said Mrs. Hardwick, with an unaccountable smile, “when you get back.”  There was something peculiar in her tone as she pronounced these last words, but Ida did not notice it.  So Ida, despite her company, actually enjoyed, in her bright anticipation, a keen sense of pleasure.  “Are we most there?” she asked, after riding about two hours.  “It won't be long,” said the nurse.  “We must have come ever so many miles,” said Ida.  An hour passed. She amused herself by gazing out of the car windows at the towns which seemed to flit by. At length, both Ida and her nurse became hungry.  The nurse beckoned to her side a boy who was going through the cars selling apples and seed-cakes, and inquired their price.  “The apples are two cents apiece, ma'am, and the cakes a cent apiece.”  Ida, who had been looking out of the window, turned suddenly round, and exclaimed, in great astonishment; “Why, William Fitts, is that you?”  “Why, Ida, where did you come from?” asked the boy, his surprise equalling her own.  The nurse bit her lips in vexation at this unexpected recognition.  “I'm making a little journey with her,” indicating Mrs. Hardwick.  “So you're going to Philadelphia,” said the boy.  “To Philadelphia!” said Ida, in surprise. “Not that I know of.”  “Why, you're most there now.”  “Are we, Mrs. Hardwick?” asked Ida, looking in her companion's face.  “It isn't far from there where we're going,” said the nurse, shortly. “Boy, I'll take two of your apples and four seed-cakes. And now you'd better go along, for there's somebody by the stove that looks as if he wanted to buy of you.”  William looked back as if he would like to question Ida farther, but her companion looked forbidding, and he passed on reluctantly.  “Who is that boy?” asked the nurse, abruptly.  “His name is William Fitts.”  “Where did you get acquainted with him?”  “He went to school with Jack, so I used to see him sometimes.”  “With Jack! Who's Jack?”  “What! Don't you know Jack, brother Jack?” asked Ida, in childish surprise.  “O yes,” replied the nurse, recollecting herself; “I didn't think of him.”  “He's a first-rate boy, William is,” said Ida, who was disposed to be communicative. “He's good to his mother. You see his mother is sick most of the time, and can't do much; and he's got a little sister, she ain't more than four or five years old--and William supports them by selling things. He's only sixteen; isn't he a smart boy?”  “Yes;” said the nurse, mechanically.  “Some time,” continued Ida, “I hope I shall be able to earn something for father and mother, so they won't be obliged to work so hard.”  “What could you do?” asked the nurse, curiously.  “I don't know as I could do much,” said Ida, modestly; “but when I have practised more, perhaps I could draw pictures that people would buy.”  “So you know how to draw?”  “Yes, I've been taking lessons for over a year.”  “And how do you like it?”  “Oh, ever so much! I like it a good deal better than music.”  “Do you know anything of that?”  “Yes, I can play a few easy pieces.”  Mrs. Hardwick looked surprised, and regarded her young charge with curiosity.  “Have you got any of your drawings with you?” she asked.  “No, I didn't bring any.”  “I"]]]
