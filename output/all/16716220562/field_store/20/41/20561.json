He resolved to get a view of it, and then, he thought he might very likely run better than the best of them.    CHAPTER V.  There were moments of waiting.  The youth thought of the village street at home before the arrival of the circus parade on a day in the spring. He remembered how he had stood, a small, thrillful boy, prepared to follow the dingy lady upon the white horse, or the band in its faded chariot.  He saw the yellow road, the lines of expectant people, and the sober houses. He particularly remembered an old fellow who used to sit upon a cracker box in front of the store and feign to despise such exhibitions.  A thousand details of color and form surged in his mind. The old fellow upon the cracker box appeared in middle prominence.  Some one cried, \"Here they come!\"  There was rustling and muttering among the men.  They displayed a feverish desire to have every possible cartridge ready to their hands. The boxes were pulled around into various positions, and adjusted with great care.  It was as if seven hundred new bonnets were being tried on.  The tall soldier, having prepared his rifle, produced a red handkerchief of some kind.  He was engaged in knitting it about his throat with exquisite attention to its position, when the cry was repeated up and down the line in a muffled roar of sound.  \"Here they come!  Here they come!\"  Gun locks clicked.  Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown swarm of running men who were giving shrill yells.  They came on, stooping and swinging their rifles at all angles.  A flag, tilted forward, sped near the front.  As he caught sight of them the youth was momentarily startled by a thought that perhaps his gun was not loaded.  He stood trying to rally his faltering intellect so that he might recollect the moment when he had loaded, but he could not.  A hatless general pulled his dripping horse to a stand near the colonel of the 304th.  He shook his fist in the other's face.  \"You 've got to hold 'em back!\" he shouted, savagely; \"you 've got to hold 'em back!\"  In his agitation the colonel began to stammer. \"A-all r-right, General, all right, by Gawd!  We--we'll do our--we-we'll d-d-do--do our best, General.\"  The general made a passionate gesture and galloped away. The colonel, perchance to relieve his feelings, began to scold like a wet parrot.  The youth, turning swiftly to make sure that the rear was unmolested, saw the commander regarding his men in a highly regretful manner, as if he regretted above everything his association with them.  The man at the youth's elbow was mumbling, as if to himself: \"Oh, we 're in for it now! oh, we 're in for it now!\"  The captain of the company had been pacing excitedly to and fro in the rear.  He coaxed in schoolmistress fashion, as to a congregation of boys with primers.  His talk was an endless repetition.  \"Reserve your fire, boys--don't shoot till I tell you--save your fire--wait till they get close up--don't be damned fools--\"  Perspiration streamed down the youth's face, which was soiled like that of a weeping urchin. He frequently, with a nervous movement, wiped his eyes with his coat sleeve.  His mouth was still a little ways open.  He got the one glance at the foe-swarming field in front of him, and instantly ceased to debate the question of his piece being loaded. Before he was ready to begin--before he had announced to himself that he was about to fight--he threw the obedient, well-balanced rifle into position and fired a first wild shot.  Directly he was working at his weapon like an automatic affair.  He suddenly lost concern for himself, and forgot to look at a menacing fate.  He became not a man but a member.  He felt that something of which he was a part--a regiment, an army, a cause, or a country--was in a crisis.  He was welded into a common personality which was dominated by a single desire.  For some moments he could not flee no more than a little finger can commit a revolution from a hand.  If he had thought the regiment was about to be annihilated perhaps he could have amputated himself from it.  But its noise gave him assurance.  The regiment was like a firework that, once ignited, proceeds superior to circumstances until its blazing vitality fades. It wheezed and banged with a mighty power.  He pictured the ground before it as strewn with the discomfited.  There was a consciousness always of the presence of his comrades about him.  He felt the subtle battle brotherhood more potent even than the cause for which they were fighting.  It was a mysterious fraternity born of the smoke and danger of death.  He was at a task.  He was like a carpenter who has made many boxes, making still another box, only there was furious haste in his movements.  He, in his thought, was careering off in other places, even as the carpenter who as he works whistles and thinks of his friend or his enemy, his home or a saloon.  And these jolted dreams were never perfect to him afterward, but remained a mass of blurred shapes.  Presently he began to feel the effects of the war atmosphere--a blistering sweat, a sensation that his eyeballs were about to crack like hot stones.  A burning roar filled his ears.  Following this came a red rage.  He developed the acute exasperation of a pestered animal, a well-meaning cow worried by dogs.  He had a mad feeling against his rifle, which could only be used against one life at a time.  He wished to rush forward and strangle with his fingers.  He craved a power that would enable him to make a world-sweeping gesture and brush all back.  His impotency appeared to him, and made his rage into that of a driven beast.  Buried in the smoke of many rifles his anger was directed not so much against the men whom he knew were rushing toward him as against the swirling battle phantoms which were choking him, stuffing their smoke robes down his parched throat.  He fought frantically for respite for his senses, for air, as a babe being smothered attacks the deadly blankets.  There was a blare of heated rage mingled with a certain expression of intentness on all faces. Many of the men were making low-toned noises with their mouths, and these subdued cheers, snarls, imprecations, prayers, made a wild, barbaric song that went as an undercurrent of sound, strange and chantlike with the resounding chords of the war march.  The man at the youth's elbow was babbling.  In it there was something soft and tender like the monologue of a babe.  The tall soldier was swearing in a loud voice.  From his lips came a black procession of curious oaths.  Of a sudden another broke out in a querulous way like a man who has mislaid his hat.  \"Well, why don't they support us?  Why don't they send supports?  Do they think--\"  The youth in his battle sleep heard this as one who dozes hears.  There was a singular absence of heroic poses. The men bending and surging in their haste and rage were in every impossible attitude.  The steel ramrods clanked and clanged with incessant din as the men pounded them furiously into the hot rifle barrels.  The flaps of the cartridge boxes were all unfastened, and bobbed idiotically with each movement. The rifles, once loaded, were jerked to the shoulder and fired without apparent aim into the smoke or at one of the blurred and shifting forms which upon the field before the regiment had been growing larger and larger like puppets under a magician's hand.  The officers, at their intervals, rearward, neglected to stand in picturesque attitudes.  They were bobbing to and fro roaring directions and encouragements.  The dimensions of their howls were extraordinary. They expended their lungs with prodigal wills.  And often they nearly stood upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the enemy on the other side of the tumbling smoke.  The lieutenant of the youth's company had encountered a soldier who had fled screaming at the first volley of his comrades.  Behind the lines these two were acting a little isolated scene.  The man was blubbering and staring with sheeplike eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him by the collar and was pommeling him.  He drove him back into the ranks with many blows.  The soldier went mechanically, dully, with his animal-like eyes upon the officer.  Perhaps there was to him a divinity expressed in the voice of the other--stern, hard, with no reflection of fear in it.  He tried to reload his gun, but his shaking hands prevented.  The lieutenant was obliged to assist him.  The men dropped here and there like bundles. The captain of the youth's company had been killed in an early part of the action.  His body lay stretched out in the position of a tired man resting, but upon his face there was an astonished and sorrowful look, as if he thought some friend had done him an ill turn.  The babbling man was grazed by a shot that made the blood stream widely down his face.  He clapped both hands to his head.  \"Oh!\" he said, and ran.  Another grunted suddenly as if he had been struck by a club in the stomach.  He sat down and gazed ruefully.  In his eyes there was mute, indefinite reproach.  Farther up the line a man, standing behind a tree, had had his knee joint splintered by a ball.  Immediately he had dropped his rifle and gripped the tree with both arms.  And there he remained, clinging desperately and crying for assistance that he might withdraw his hold upon the tree.  At last an exultant yell went along the quivering line.  The firing dwindled from an uproar to a last vindictive popping.  As the smoke slowly eddied away, the youth saw that the charge had been repulsed. The enemy were scattered into reluctant groups.  He saw a man climb to the top of the fence, straddle the rail, and fire a parting shot.  The waves had receded, leaving bits of dark _d√©bris_ upon the ground.  Some in the regiment began to whoop frenziedly.  Many were silent. Apparently they were trying to contemplate themselves.  After the fever had left his "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/463"],["title","The Red Badge of Courage: An Episode of the American Civil War (#7)"],["body","veins, the youth thought that at last he was going to suffocate. He became aware of the foul atmosphere in which he had been struggling.  He was grimy and dripping like a laborer in a foundry.  He grasped his canteen and took a long swallow of the warmed water.  A sentence with variations went up and down the line.  \"Well, we 've helt 'em back.  We 've helt 'em back; derned if we haven't.\"  The men said it blissfully, leering at each other with dirty smiles.  The youth turned to look behind him and off to the right and off to the left.  He experienced the joy of a man who at last finds leisure in which to look about him.  Under foot there were a few ghastly forms motionless.  They lay twisted in fantastic contortions.  Arms were bent and heads were turned in incredible ways.  It seemed that the dead men must have fallen from some great height to get into such positions.  They looked to be dumped out upon the ground from the sky.  From a position in the rear of the grove a battery was throwing shells over it.  The flash of the guns startled the youth at first.  He thought they were aimed directly at him.  Through the trees he watched the black figures of the gunners as they worked swiftly and intently. Their labor seemed a complicated thing.  He wondered how they could remember its formula in the midst of confusion.  The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs. They argued with abrupt violence.  It was a grim pow-wow.  Their busy servants ran hither and thither.  A small procession of wounded men were going drearily toward the rear. It was a flow of blood from the torn body of the brigade.  To the right and to the left were the dark lines of other troops.  Far in front he thought he could see lighter masses protruding in points from the forest.  They were suggestive of unnumbered thousands.  Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along the line of the horizon. The tiny riders were beating the tiny horses.  From a sloping hill came the sound of cheerings and clashes.  Smoke welled slowly through the leaves.  Batteries were speaking with thunderous oratorical effort.  Here and there were flags, the red in the stripes dominating.  They splashed bits of warm color upon the dark lines of troops.  The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of the emblem.  They were like beautiful birds strangely undaunted in a storm.  As he listened to the din from the hillside, to a deep pulsating thunder that came from afar to the left, and to the lesser clamors which came from many directions, it occurred to him that they were fighting, too, over there, and over there, and over there.  Heretofore he had supposed that all the battle was directly under his nose.  As he gazed around him the youth felt a flash of astonishment at the blue, pure sky and the sun gleamings on the trees and fields.  It was surprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on with her golden process in the midst of so much devilment.    CHAPTER VI.  The youth awakened slowly.  He came gradually back to a position from which he could regard himself.  For moments he had been scrutinizing his person in a dazed way as if he had never before seen himself.  Then he picked up his cap from the ground.  He wriggled in his jacket to make a more comfortable fit, and kneeling relaced his shoe.  He thoughtfully mopped his reeking features.  So it was all over at last!  The supreme trial had been passed.  The red, formidable difficulties of war had been vanquished.  He went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction. He had the most delightful sensations of his life. Standing as if apart from himself, he viewed that last scene.  He perceived that the man who had fought thus was magnificent.  He felt that he was a fine fellow.  He saw himself even with those ideals which he had considered as far beyond him.  He smiled in deep gratification.  Upon his fellows he beamed tenderness and good will.  \"Gee! ain't it hot, hey?\" he said affably to a man who was polishing his streaming face with his coat sleeves.  \"You bet!\" said the other, grinning sociably. \"I never seen sech dumb hotness.\"  He sprawled out luxuriously on the ground.  \"Gee, yes!  An' I hope we don't have no more fightin' till a week from Monday.\"  There were some handshakings and deep speeches with men whose features were familiar, but with whom the youth now felt the bonds of tied hearts.  He helped a cursing comrade to bind up a wound of the shin.  But, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke out along the ranks of the new regiment.  \"Here they come ag'in!  Here they come ag'in!\"  The man who had sprawled upon the ground started up and said, \"Gosh!\"  The youth turned quick eyes upon the field. He discerned forms begin to swell in masses out of a distant wood.  He again saw the tilted flag speeding forward.  The shells, which had ceased to trouble the regiment for a time, came swirling again, and exploded in the grass or among the leaves of the trees.  They looked to be strange war flowers bursting into fierce bloom.  The men groaned.  The luster faded from their eyes.  Their smudged countenances now expressed a profound dejection.  They moved their stiffened bodies slowly, and watched in sullen mood the frantic approach of the enemy.  The slaves toiling in the temple of this god began to feel rebellion at his harsh tasks.  They fretted and complained each to each. \"Oh, say, this is too much of a good thing!  Why can't somebody send us supports?\"  \"We ain't never goin' to stand this second banging.  I didn't come here to fight the hull damn' rebel army.\"  There was one who raised a doleful cry.  \"I wish Bill Smithers had trod on my hand, insteader me treddin' on his'n.\"  The sore joints of the regiment creaked as it painfully floundered into position to repulse.  The youth stared.  Surely, he thought, this impossible thing was not about to happen.  He waited as if he expected the enemy to suddenly stop, apologize, and retire bowing.  It was all a mistake.  But the firing began somewhere on the regimental line and ripped along in both directions. The level sheets of flame developed great clouds of smoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild wind near the ground for a moment, and then rolled through the ranks as through a gate.  The clouds were tinged an earthlike yellow in the sunrays and in the shadow were a sorry blue. The flag was sometimes eaten and lost in this mass of vapor, but more often it projected, sun-touched, resplendent.  Into the youth's eyes there came a look that one can see in the orbs of a jaded horse.  His neck was quivering with nervous weakness and the muscles of his arms felt numb and bloodless. His hands, too, seemed large and awkward as if he was wearing invisible mittens.  And there was a great uncertainty about his knee joints.  The words that comrades had uttered previous to the firing began to recur to him.  \"Oh, say, this is too much of a good thing!  What do they take us for--why don't they send supports?  I didn't come here to fight the hull damned rebel army.\"  He began to exaggerate the endurance, the skill, and the valor of those who were coming. Himself reeling from exhaustion, he was astonished beyond measure at such persistency.  They must be machines of steel. It was very gloomy struggling against such affairs, wound up perhaps to fight until sundown.  He slowly lifted his rifle and catching a glimpse of the thickspread field he blazed at a cantering cluster.  He stopped then and began to peer as best he could through the smoke.  He caught changing views of the ground covered with men who were all running like pursued imps, and yelling.  To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubtable dragons.  He became like the man who lost his legs at the approach of the red and green monster.  He waited in a sort of a horrified, listening attitude.  He seemed to shut his eyes and wait to be gobbled.  A man near him who up to this time had been working feverishly at his rifle suddenly stopped and ran with howls.  A lad whose face had borne an expression of exalted courage, the majesty of he who dares give his life, was, at an instant, smitten abject.  He blanched like one who has come to the edge of a cliff at midnight and is suddenly made aware. There was a revelation.  He, too, threw down his gun and fled.  There was no shame in his face.  He ran like a rabbit.  Others began to scamper away through the smoke.  The youth turned his head, shaken from his trance by this movement as if the regiment was leaving him behind.  He saw the few fleeting forms.  He yelled then with fright and swung about. For a moment, in the great clamor, he was like a proverbial chicken.  He lost the direction of safety.  Destruction threatened him from all points.  Directly he began to speed toward the rear in great leaps.  His rifle and cap were gone.  His unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind.  The flap of his cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen, by its slender cord, swung out behind.  On his face was all the horror of those things which he imagined.  The lieutenant sprang forward bawling.  The youth saw his features wrathfully red, and saw him make a dab with his sword.  His one thought of the incident was that the lieutenant was a peculiar creature to feel interested in such matters upon this occasion.  He ran like a blind man.  Two or three times he fell down.  Once he knocked his shoulder so heavily against a tree that he went headlong.  Since he had turned his back upon the fight his fears had been wondrously magnified.  Death about to thrust him between the shoulder blades was far more dreadful than death about to smite him between the eyes.  When he thought of it later, he conceived the impression that it is better to view the appalling than to be merely within hearing.  The noises of the battle were like stones; he believed himself liable to be crushed.  As he ran he mingled with others.  He dimly saw men on his right and on his left, and he heard footsteps behind him.  He thought that all the regiment was"]]]
