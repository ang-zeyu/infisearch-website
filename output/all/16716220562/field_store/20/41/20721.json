The climate saved the Athenians from being obliged to wage a stern warfare with nature as did the northern peoples.  Their life and civilization could be one developed essentially “in the open air”; while, on the other hand, the bracing sea breeze saved them from that enervating lethargy which has ruined so many southern folk. The scanty soil forced them to struggle hard to win a living; unless they yielded to the constant beckoning of the ocean, and sought food, adventure, wealth, and a great empire across the seas.   7. The Topography of the City of Athens.—So much for the land of Attica in general; but what of the setting of the city of Athens itself?  The city lay in a plain, somewhat in the south central part of Attica, and about four miles back from the sea.  A number of mountains came together to form an irregular rectangle with the Saronic Gulf upon the south.  To the east of Athens stretched the long gnarled ridge of Hymettus, the wildest and grayest mountain in Attica, the home of bees and goatherds, and (if there be faith in pious legend) of innumerable nymphs and satyrs.  To the west ran the lower, browner mountains, Ægaleos, across which a road (the “Sacred Way”) wound through an easy pass towards Eleusis, the only sizable town in Attica, outside of Athens and its harbors.  To the rear of the plain rose a noble pyramid, less jagged than Hymettus, more lordly than Ægaleos; its summits were fretted with a white which turned to clear rose color under the sunset.  This was Pentelicus, from the veins whereof came the lustrous marble for the master sculptor.  Closer at hand, nearer the center of the plain, rose a small and very isolated hill,—Lycabettus, whose peaked summit looked down upon the roofs of Athens.  And last, but never least, about one mile southwest of Lycabettus, upreared a natural monument of much greater frame,—not a hill, but a colossal rock.  Its shape was that of an irregular oval; it was about 1000 feet long, 500 feet wide, and its level summit stood 350 feet above the plain. This steep, tawny rock, flung by the Titans, one might dream, into the midst of the Attic plain, formed one of the most famous sites in the world, for it was the Acropolis of Athens.  Its full significance, however, must be explained later.  From the Acropolis and a few lesser hills close by, the land sloped gently down towards the harbors and the Saronic Bay.   [Illustration: Sketch map of Athens]   These were the great features of the outward setting of Athens.  One might add to them the long belt of dark green olive groves winding down the westward side of the plain, where the Cephisus (which along among Attic rivulets did not run dry in summer) ran down to the sea.  There was also a shorter olive belt west of the city, where the weaker Ilissus crept, before it lost itself amid the thirsty fields.  Sea, rock, and sky, then, joined together around Athens as around almost no other city in the world.  The landscape itself was adjusted to the eye with marvelous harmony.  The colors and contours formed one glorious model for the sculptor and the painter, one perpetual inspiration for the poet.  Even if Athens had never been the seat of a famous race, she would have won fame as being situated in one of the most beautiful localities in the world.  Rightly, therefore, did its dwellers boast of their city as the “Violet-crowned” (_Iostephanos_).   8. 360 B.C.—The Year of the Visit to Athens.—This city let us visit in the days of its greatest outward glory.  We may select the year 360 B.C.  At that time Athens had recovered from the ravages of the Peloponnesian War, while the Macedonian peril had not as yet become menacing.  The great public buildings were nearly all completed.  No signs of material decadence were visible, and if Athens no longer possessed the wide naval empire of the days of Pericles, her fleets and her armies were still formidable.  The harbors were full of commerce; the philosophers were teaching their pupils in the groves and porticoes; the democratic constitution was entirely intact.  With intelligent vision we will enter the city and look about us.     Chapter II. The First Sights in Athens.   9. The Morning Crowds bound for Athens.—It is very early in the morning.  The sun has just pushed above the long ridge of Hymettus, sending a slanting red bar of light across the Attic plain, and touching the opposite slopes of Ægaleos with livid fire.  Already, however, life is stirring outside the city.  Long since, little market boats have rowed across the narrow strait from Salamis, bringing the island farmer’s produce, and other farmers from the plain and the mountain slopes have started for market.  In the ruddy light the marble temples on the lofty Acropolis rising ahead of these hurrying rustics are standing out clearly; the spear and helmet of the great brazen statue of the Athena Promachos are flashing from the noble citadel, as a kind of day beacon, beckoning onward toward the city.  From the Peiræus, the harbor town, a confused hum of mariners lading and unlading vessels is even now rising, but we cannot turn ourselves thither.  Our route is to follow the farmers bound for market.  The most direct road from the Peiræus to Athens is hidden indeed, for it leads between the towering ramparts of the “Long Walls,” two mighty barriers which run parallel almost four miles from the inland city to the harbor, giving a guarded passage in wartime and making Athens safe against starvation from any land blockade; but there is an outside road leading also to Athens from the western farmsteads, and this we can conveniently follow.  Upon this route the crowd which one meets is certainly not aristocratic, but it is none the less Athenian.  Here goes a drover, clad in skins, his legs wound with woolen bands in lieu of stockings; before him and his wolf-like dog shambles a flock of black sheep or less manageable goats, bleating and baaing as they are propelled toward market. After him there may come an unkempt, long-bearded farmer flogging on a pack ass or a mule attached to a clumsy cart with solid wheels, and laden with all kinds of market produce.  The roadway, be it said, is not good, and all carters have their troubles; therefore, there is a deal of gesticulating and profane invocation of Hermes and all other gods of traffic; for, early as it is, the market place is already filling, and every delay promises a loss.  There are still other companions bound toward the city:  countrymen bearing cages of poultry; others engaged in the uncertain calling of driving pigs; swarthy Oriental sailors, with rings in their ears, bearing bales of Phœnician goods from the Peiræus; respectable country gentlemen, walking gravely in their best white mantles and striving to avoid the mud and contamination; and perhaps also a small company of soldiers, just back from foreign service, passes, clattering shields and spear staves.   [Illustration: Peasant going to Market]   10. The Gate and the Street Scenes.—The crowds grow denser as everybody approaches the frequented “Peiræus Gate,” for nearly all of Attica which lies within easy reach of Athens has business in the Market Place every morning.  On passing the gate a fairly straight way leads through the city to the market, but progress for the multitude becomes slow.  If it is one of the main thoroughfares, it is now very likely to be almost blocked with people.  There are few late risers at Athens; the Council of Five Hundred[*], the huge Jury Courts, and the Public Assembly (if it has met to-day[+]) are appointed to gather at sunrise.  The plays in the theater, which, however, are given only on certain festivals, begin likewise at sunrise.  The philosophers say that “the man who would accomplish great things must be up while yet it is dark.”  Athenians, therefore, are always awake and stirring at an hour when men of later ages and more cold and foggy climes will be painfully yawning ere getting out of bed.  [*] The “Boule,” the great standing committee of the Athenian people to aid the magistrates in the government.   [+] In which case, of course, the regular courts and the Council would hardly meet.   [Illustration: At the Street Fountain]   The Market Place attracts the great masses, but by no means all; hither and thither bevies of sturdy slave girls, carrying graceful pitchers on their heads, are hurrying towards the fountains which gush cool water at most of the street corners.  Theirs is a highly necessary task, for few or no houses have their own water supply; and around each fountain one can see half a dozen by no means slatternly maidens, splashing and flirting the water one at another, while they wait their turn with the pitchers, and laugh and exchange banter with the passing farmers’ lads.  Many in the street crowds are rosy-cheeked schoolboys, walking decorously, if they are lads of good breeding, and blushing modestly when they are greeted by their fathers’ acquaintances.  They do not loiter on the way. Close behind, carrying their writing tablets, follow the faithful ‘pedagogues,’ the body-servants appointed to conduct them to school, give them informal instruction, and, if need be, correct their faults in no painless manner.  Besides the water maids and the schoolboys, from the innumerable house doors now opening the respective masters are stepping forth—followed by one, two, or several serving varlets, as many as their wealth affords.  All these join in the crowd entering from the country.  “Athenian democracy” always implies a goodly amount of hustling and pushing. No wonder the ways are a busy sight!   11. The Streets and House Fronts of Athens.—Progress is slower near the Market Place because of the extreme"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4716"],["title","A Day in Old Athens; a Picture of Athenian Life (#3)"],["body","of the streets. They are only fifteen feet wide or even less,—intolerable alleys a later age would call them,—and dirty to boot.  Sometimes they are muddy, more often extremely dusty.  Worse still, they are contaminated by great accumulations of filth; for the city is without an efficient sewer system or regular scavengers.  Even as the crowd elbows along, a house door will frequently open, an ill-favored slave boy show his head, and with the yell, “Out of the way!” slap a bucket of dirty water into the street.  There are many things to offend the nose as well as the eyes of men of a later race.  It is fortunate indeed that the Athenians are otherwise a healthy folk, or they would seem liable to perpetual pestilence; even so, great plagues have in past years harried the city[*].  [*] The most fearful thereof was the great plague of 430 B.C. (during the Peloponnesian War), which nearly ruined Athens.   The first entrance to Athens will thus bring to a stranger, full of the city’s fame and expectant of meeting objects of beauty at every turn, almost instant disappointment.  The narrow, dirty, ill-paved streets are also very crooked.  One can readily be lost in a labyrinth of filthy little lanes the moment one quits the few main thoroughfares.  High over head, to be sure, the red crags of the Acropolis may be towering, crowned with the red, gold, and white tinted marble of the temples, but all around seems only monotonous squalor.  The houses seem one continuous series of blank walls; mostly of one, occasionally of two stories, and with flat roofs. These walls are usually spread over with some dirty gray or perhaps yellow stucco.  For most houses, the only break in the street walls are the simple doors, all jealously barred and admitting no glance within.  There are usually no street windows, if the house is only one story high.  If it has two stories, a few narrow slits above the way may hint that here are the apartments for the slaves or women.  There are no street numbers.  There are often no street names.  “So-and-so lives in such-and-such a quarter, near the Temple of Heracles;” that will enable you to find a householder, after a few tactful questions from the neighbors; and after all, Athens is a relatively small city[*] (as great cities are reckoned), very closely built, and her regular denizens do not feel the need of a directory.  [* ]Every guess at the population of Athens rests on mere conjecture; yet, using the scanty data which we possess, it seems possible that _the population of all Attica_ at the height of its prosperity was about _200,000 free persons_ (including the _metics_—resident foreigners without citizenship); and a rather smaller number of slaves—say 150,000 or less.  Of this total of some 350,000, probably something under one half resided in the city of Athens during times of peace, the rest in the outlying farms and villages.  _Athens may be imagined as a city of about 150,000_—possibly a trifle more. During serious wars there would be of course a general removal into the city.   So the crowd elbows its way onward:  now thinning, now gaining, but the main stream always working towards the Market Place.   12.  The Simplicity of Athenian Life.—It is clear we are entering a city where nine tenths of what the twentieth century will consider the “essential conveniences” of life are entirely lacking; where men are trying to be civilized—or, as the Greeks would say, to lay hold upon “the true, the beautiful, and the good,” without even the absolute minimum of those things which people of a later age will believe separate a “civilized man” from a “barbarian.”  The gulf between old Athens and, for instance, new Chicago is greater than is readily supposed[*].  It is easy enough to say that the Athenians lacked such things as railways, telephones, gas, grapefruit, and cocktails.  All such matters we realize were not known by our fathers and grandfathers, and we are not yet so removed from _them_ that we cannot transport ourselves in imagination back to the world of say 1820 A.D.; but the Athenians are far behind even our grandfathers.  When we investigate, we will find conditions like these—houses absolutely without plumbing, beds without sheets, rooms as hot or as cold as the outer air, only far more drafty.  We must cross rivers without bridges; we must fasten our clothes (or rather our “two pieces of cloth”) with two pins instead of with a row of buttons; we must wear sandals without stockings (or go barefoot); must warm ourselves over a pot of ashes; judge plays or lawsuits on a cold winter morning sitting in the open air; we must study poetry with very little aid from books, geography without real maps, and politics without newspapers; and lastly, “we must learn how to be civilized without being comfortable!”[+]  [*] See the very significant comment on the physical limitations of the old Athenian life in Zimmern’s “_The Greek Commonwealth_,” p. 209.   [+] Zimmern, _ibid_.   Or, to reverse the case:  we must understand that an Athenian would have pronounced our boasted “civilization” hopelessly artificial, and our life so dependent on outward material props and factors as to be scarcely worth the living.  He would declare himself well able to live happily under conditions where the average American or Englishman would be cold, semi-starved, and miserable.  He would declare that _his_ woe or happiness was retained far more under his own control than we retain ours, and that we are worthy of contemptuous pity rather than of admiration, because we have refined our civilization to such a point that the least accident, _e.g._ the suspension of rail traffic for a few days, can reduce a modern city to acute wretchedness.  Probably neither the twentieth century in its pride, nor the fourth century B.C. in its contempt, would have all the truth upon its side.[*]  The difference in viewpoint, however, must still stand. Preëminently Athens may be called the “City of the Simple Life.” Bearing this fact in mind, we may follow the multitude and enter the Marketplace; or, to use the name that stamps it as a peculiarly Greek institution,—the Agora.  [*] The mere matter of _climate_ would of course have to come in as a serious factor.  The Athenian would have found his life becoming infinitely more complex along the material side when he tried to live like a “_kalos-k’agathos_”—_i.e._ a “noble and good man,” or a “gentleman,”—in a land where the thermometer might sink to 15° below zero Fahrenheit (or even lower) from time to time during the winter.     Chapter III. The Agora and its Denizens.   13.  The Buildings around the Agora.—Full market time![*]  The great plaza of the Agora is buzzing with life.  The contrast between the dingy, dirty streets and this magnificent public plaza is startling. The Athenians manifestly care little for merely private display, rather they frown upon it; their wealth, patriotism, and best artistic energy seem all lavished upon their civic establishments and buildings.  [*] Between nine and twelve A.M.   The Agora is a square of spacious dimensions, planted here and there with graceful bay trees.  Its greatest length runs north and south.  Ignoring for the time the teeming noisy swarms of humanity, let our eyes be directed merely upon the encircling buildings.  The place is almost completely enclosed by them, although not all are of equal elegance or pretension.  Some are temples of more or less size, like the temple of the “Paternal Apollo” near the southwestern angle; or the “Metroön,” the fane of Cybele “the Great Mother of the Gods,” upon the south.  Others are governmental buildings; somewhat behind the Metroön rise the imposing pillars of the Council House, where the Five Hundred are deliberating on the policy of Athens; and hard by that is the Tholos, the “Round House,” with a peaked, umbrella-shaped roof, beneath which the sacred public hearth fire is ever kept burning, and where the presiding Committee of the Council[*] and certain high officials take their meals, and a good deal of state business is transacted.  The majority of these buildings upon the Agora, however, are covered promenades, porticoes, or stoæ.  [*] This select committee was known technically as the “_Prytanes_.”   The stoæ are combinations of rain shelters, shops, picture galleries, and public offices.  Turn under the pillars of the “Royal Stoa” upon the west, and you are among the whispering, nudging, intent crowd of listeners, pushing against the barriers of a low court. Long rows of jurors are sitting on their benches; the “King Archon” is on the president’s stand, and some poor wight is being arraigned on a charge of “Impiety”[*]; while on the walls behind stand graved and ancient laws of Draco and Solon.  [*] The so-called “King Archon” had special cognizance of most cases involving religious questions; and his court was in this stoa.   [Illustration: A Wayside Herm]   Cross the square, and on the opposite side is one of the most magnificent of the porticoes, the “Painted Porch” (“_Stoa Poikilë_”), a long covered walk, a delightful refuge alike from sun and rain. Almost the entire length of the inner walls (for it has columns only on the side of the Agora) is covered with vivid frescoes.  Here Polygnotus and other master painters have spread out the whole legendary story of the capture of Troy and of the defeat of the Amazons; likewise the more historical tale of the battle of Marathon. Yet another promenade, the “Stoa of Zeus,” is sacred to Zeus, Giver of Freedom.  The walls are not frescoed, but hung with the shields of valiant Athenian warriors.  In the open spaces of the plaza itself are various altars, _e.g._ to the “Twelve Gods,” and innumerable statues of local worthies, as of Harmodius and Aristogeiton, the tyrant-slayers; while across the center, cutting the Market Place from east to west, runs a line of stone posts, each surmounted with a rude bearded head of Hermes, the"]]]
