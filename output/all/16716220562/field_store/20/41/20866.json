The natives are coming.”  “Yes, and let them come,” Sparky rattled his sub-machine gun. “If they’re peaceful, things will be all right. If not—” He rattled the gun once more. “This is war. The Lone Star and her secret cargo must go through!”  After that for some time they sat there in silence listening to the wild native chant that, with every movement, grew louder.  Then, suddenly, the dark waters of the river came all alight. The long canoes had turned a bend of the river. In each canoe were a dozen torches held aloft. Mary counted nine canoes in all. To her heightened imagination each canoe seemed a hundred feet in length.  “Do they come like that when they want to fight?” she asked gripping Sparky’s arm hard.  “Who knows?” was the brief reply.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER III                               BATTLING A SPY   For a time Sparky and Mary sat in the dark silently watching the torch-lit procession of great canoes. To Mary it was a fascinating and fearsome spectacle.  Suddenly Sparky let out a low exclamation. “Thunderation!”  At that he jumped from the log on which he had been sitting to kick at their half-burned-out campfire until the coals glowed red again. Then, gathering up an armful of dry-as-tinder leaves, he threw them on the coals.  For a space of seconds a column of dense smoke rose straight toward the stars. Then, as the whole mass burst into flames, all about them, the native huts, the airplanes, and the jungle at their backs stood out in bold relief.  “Sparky!” Mary exclaimed, shrinking back. “Why did you do that?”  “I’ll meet any man half way,” was the reply. “That is, anyone but Hitler’s mob and those dirty, little Japs.”  “But those men are savages!”  “Who knows? What’s a savage anyway,” Sparky’s voice sounded strange. “Every man is a human being. Those are men. Brazil is our ally at war and this is Brazil. When men come to you singing and waving torches, you just must meet them half way.”  By this time the dugout canoes were pulling up to the shore. The chant had ceased. In its place was only the murmur of voices. The torches still flamed.  Soon a procession came moving like a great, twisting, glowing serpent toward the campfire.  “Sparky!” Mary crowded close. “It’s too much. I can’t stand it!”  “Steady, girl!” Sparky’s voice was calm. His hands still gripped the tommy-gun.  As the procession came closer, they saw that most of the natives were all but naked, that some carried rifles and others spears and that they were led by a little man wearing striped trousers, a bright jacket and a sword. They did not pause until, as if in a high-school drill, they had ranged themselves in three semicircular rows before the fire. The little man stood at the center and three steps before them.  Mary tried to think what one swing of Sparky’s spitting tommy-gun would do to those rows and shuddered.  At last the little man spoke. His words came in slow, precise English.  “You are from the United States?”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _Sparky and Mary Watched the Natives Come Closer_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “That’s right, pardner,” Sparky agreed.  “The United States and Brazil are united against a common enemy.”  “Right again.”  “As our ally I salute you.” The little man’s hand shot up in a salute.  Thrilled to her fingertips, Mary managed to join Sparky in a salute.  The little man spoke a single word in a strange tongue and instantly the circle of natives dropped to their knees in a position of ease.  “Just like that,” Mary whispered. She wanted terribly to cry.  With a courteous gesture the little man invited Mary and Sparky to resume their positions on the log. Then he sat down at Sparky’s side.  “I,” he said, “am Doctor Salazar. I have studied in your country. Being not unskilled in the medical profession and also possessed of an interest in native life, I was sent to this place that I might make friends of the natives. This, you will see, I’ve done.”  “You are wonderful,” Mary exclaimed. “And you are a doctor.”  “Yes, that is my profession.”  “One member of our party has been injured, how seriously we can’t tell,” Sparky explained.  “I am at your service. Shall we have a look at this man?”  They rose and walked over to Don’s side. He had been sleeping but now stared at them with questioning eyes.  “We have brought you a doctor,” said Mary.  “And not a medicine man either,” Sparky laughed.  With practised fingers the little man went over Don from head to toe. “No bones broken,” was his diagnosis. “Probably three ribs cracked. When his chest is taped up, he can be moved.”  “Good! We’ll take him to Para in the morning.”  “In that large plane, I suppose,” said the doctor.  “Yes.”  “And the other plane?” asked the doctor.  “If your men will help us, we can load the motors in our good plane,” said Sparky.  “It shall be done. You are Americans. I am an American. We all are Americans.”  “You’re right. We all are!” Mary exclaimed.  “The motors shall go,” said the doctor. “But that which remains?”  Sparky shrugged. “In a war there will always be losses.”  “My men and I can take it in pieces. We shall float it to the Rio Negro. There it can be put on a steamer. It should be in Para perhaps in two weeks. So there you are.” The doctor made another bow.  “Indeed, you are wonderful!” Mary exclaimed.  “It is all for the great cause. Speed the victory.” The doctor clicked his heels and saluted.  The salute was returned in good measure.  And so it was arranged. Scarcely had the red of dawn disappeared from the sky when the Lone Star rose to greet the sun, then began winging its way toward the far-away city of Para.  Four hours later, far above the clouds, they flew across the broad waters of the Para river at its mouth, then began circling down to the city of Para.  First to catch Mary’s eye was the city’s ancient fortifications. As they circled lower she caught the gleam of the cathedral’s roof. The governor’s palace and other public buildings stood out from among the royal palms. Last but not least were the hundreds of homes, each with its lovely little garden surrounded by palms.  The broad public garden caught her eye, then the airport. So they came circling down to ask for and receive permission to land.  As soon as they were down an ambulance was called and Don, with Janet in attendance, was whisked away to the hospital.  “I’m staying with the ship,” Sparky said to Mary.  “Sure,” Mary agreed. “Can’t take any chances this time.”  “That’s right. Besides there’s a lot to be done. The motors from my ship must be unloaded and arrangements made for the repairing and assembling of the other plane when it arrives—if it does,” Sparky added gloomily.  “Oh! It will!” Mary exclaimed. “I’d trust that little doctor with my life.”  “Okay. We’ll hope for it,” Sparky agreed. “You just hop out somewhere and get yourself a good, square meal.”  “One good Brazilian feed,” she laughed.  “That’s it. One dinner in every land. That’s our motto.”  “I’ll bring you a dinner on a tray, buy tray, dishes, and all. When we get going you can eat the food and throw the dishes into the sea.”  “We’ll be taking off in just a couple of hours, if I can get our papers all cleared up, so don’t admire the scenery too long.”  “Don’t worry. I’ll be right back.”  Even at this strange corner of the world the war was much in evidence. Soldiers were all over the field. Army planes from many lands came and went. At the gate stood two guards. A smile and her uniform were all the passes she needed.  Not so the youth in tattered clothes who stood outside the gate, gazing in at Mary’s big plane.  “That’s some plane you’ve got.” He tipped his seedy hat.  “You’re an American, too.” She smiled.  “Yes—I—guess so. At least I used to be.” He did not smile. “Now, well, I guess you’d say I’m sort of a tropical tramp. Been down here for five years.”  “But,” his voice rose, “Boy! That plane of yours. Must be the best there is!”  “Ever do any flying?” she asked. She should be going on but this boy interested her.  “Sure—I’ve flown quite a bit, here and in U.S.A., too.”  “Why don’t you join up?”  “Your outfit?” He grinned broadly. “You’re a girl.”  “Oh, but there are a lot more men than women flying for the Ferry Command.”  “But then,” her voice dropped, “they probably wouldn’t take you.”  “Why?” His shoulders squared.  “That’s just it,” was the quick reply. “You’re too fit. They’d want you for combat duty. You can’t make our outfit unless you’re too old for combat or there’s something a little wrong with you. Sparky, my fellow-pilot, has a hole in his eardrum. Combat wouldn’t take him, but Ferry did.”  “But say!” She gave him a good, square look. “Why don’t you ship back to U.S.A. and get into a uniform? Afraid to go back?”  “No, just ashamed. I ran away. My mother’s a peach. She really is.”  “Go back and sign up. Get into uniform, then breeze back home. You’ll make a hit.”  “Well, I—”  He broke short off to leap sideways, take three flying steps, then swing his arm to knock something from a stranger’s hand. Without knowing why, Mary followed on the run. It was lucky that she did, for the angry man flashed a knife. He slashed at the boy once and drew blood. His second blow, better aimed, might have been fatal had not Mary done a flying leap to knock his arm high in the air and send the knife flying away.  Instantly they were surrounded by soldiers. The youth and the man were seized. Two soldiers stepped toward Mary.  “What eez zis all about?” one asked.  “I—I really don’t know,” was her faltering answer.  The soldier looked at her in astonishment. “You might have been keeled. Now you say, ‘I know nothing.’”  “It’s a fact for all that.” She smiled in spite of herself. “I—I do things like that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47793"],["title","Sparky Ames of the Ferry Command (#4)"],["body","metimes.”  “I’ll tell you what it’s about,” the boy broke in, holding up a bloody arm. “That man,” he pointed to the stranger, “is a spy. He was taking pictures of that big plane. That’s an American plane and I’m an American. He can’t get by with that!”  “Good for you!” The words were on Mary’s lips. She did not say them. Instead she bent down and picked up something black that gave off a bright gleam. “He’s telling the truth,” she said in as quiet a tone as she could command. “Here’s the proof, his camera. That boy knocked it from his hand.”  “It’s a lie!” the man snarled. “I never saw the thing before!”  “It’s one of those costly miniature cameras,” Mary went on. “It takes a hundred pictures as easy as firing a machine gun. And sometimes it’s twice as deadly.” She handed it to the soldier. “Have the film developed. The pictures will speak for themselves.”  “It’s a lie,” the man growled, trying to break away.  “He calls himself Joe Stevens now,” said the boy, swabbing his bleeding arm with a soiled handkerchief. “I knew him in Manos. That was before we entered the war. He was a rubber trader then. They called him Schnieder.”  “We’ll look into this,” said the officer.  To Mary he said, “This boy needs attention. There’s a Red Cross first-aid station up that way a block.”  “I’ll have him fixed up,” said Mary.  “And will you vouch for his return to the station at the airport gate?”  “Absolutely.”  “Come on then,” the soldier spoke to Stevens who had once been Schnieder, then they marched away.  “It’s nothing,” the boy said, hiding his hand. “I’ll fix it.”  “No,” said Mary. “We’re going to the first-aid station. Then you’re going to take me to some place where I can get a swell dinner.”  “Oh, so that’s how it is?” His face lit up. “Come on, then, let’s go.”  An hour later, with his arm neatly bandaged, the boy sat opposite her, smiling. The grand dinner he had promised was coming to an end. It had been all she had dreamed of and more. They were having their black coffee and ice cream.  Taking a pencil from her purse she wrote on a card then handed it to him. “That,” she said, “is my permanent address. I’m going on a rather long journey. I may not come back. We never know. But if I do, I’d like to have something nice waiting for me. Send me your picture when you get in uniform, won’t you?”  “Well, I—” He swallowed hard. “Yes, I will, if I make it.” That was all he said.  At the airport gate he put out a hand for a good stout handclasp.  “Ships that pass in the night.” His voice was husky.  “Yes,” she replied quickly. “Fighting ships that are going to put things to rights in this old world of ours.” At that she turned to march away.  “By the way,” he called after her. “Just in case you might like to know, my name’s Jerry Sikes—”  “Thanks, Jerry.” She smiled. Then without thinking she added, “I’ll be seeing you.”  One more hour passed. Just as they were ready to take off, Mary brought Sparky his dinner on a tray.  “It’s paid for, tray and all,” she said.  “Good! Then, let’s go.” He led the way into the cabin. “They say it brings good luck if you throw your dishes into the sea,” he laughed.  Mary did not laugh. One word Sparky had spoken stuck in her mind.  “Luck,” she whispered to herself. “We may need it, all kinds of luck.” She could not quite forget that they had already lost one plane. Just now she had visions of herself on a rubber raft in mid-Atlantic, casting a line in the vain hope of catching a fish.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER IV                                THE BIG HOP   Shaking herself free from these disturbing thoughts, Mary checked the No. 1 card Sparky handed her and said, “It’s okay,” then watched him check his gas.  Working together like the well-trained team that they were, they threw on a switch here to release it, then snapped on another there, only to reach for one more switch. Mary nodded to the mechanic waiting outside. He nodded back, then held up a fire bottle. One engine coughed, then the other. Mary reached for two small levers, Sparky eased the throttle back to one thousand, then nodded to the mechanic. The mechanic removed the chocks from before their wheels. Sparky eased his plane slowly down the runway. They picked up speed. Faster—faster—faster they sped and then that magic word, “up,” and they were away.  They were not off for Africa, not yet. Their way led along the coast toward Natal, the jumping off place.  Sometimes they were far out over the sea and then again the beauty of tropical forests lay beneath them. It was a glorious trip.  Just at sunset a white spot appeared before them and Mary knew that this lap of their journey was nearing its end.  “There are good American mechanics at Natal,” Sparky said. “They’ll give the old ship a real going over. We’ll get a few hours of good, sound sleep. And then—”  “We’ll be off.” Mary thrilled to the tips of her toes. “Off for the Old World. We’re going abroad, Sparky! Just think! Really going abroad!”  “It’s just another trip for me,” Sparky laughed low. “But if you get a kick out of it, that’s just fine.”  “Get a kick out of it!” she exclaimed. “Of course I will. If the time ever comes when I no longer get a kick out of things, I’ll be ready to die.”  “Guess you’re right at that,” Sparky agreed. “But then, what’s a thrill to you may be just another headache for someone else. I, too, have my big moments.”  “Let me know when you have one?” she asked.  “I might, at that,” he agreed.  “There’s a good little hotel run just for American women at Natal,” he said. “Run by an old lady called Aunt Polly.”  “Aunt Polly—sounds like a parrot,” Mary laughed.  “She’s got one, too,” said Sparky. “She keeps a nice place. I’ll run over there soon’s we land.  “Set your alarm, for I’ll be after you at two A.M. We’ll not sleep going over so don’t lie awake thinking. Hit the pillow fast and hard. That’s my motto.”  “Fast and hard it shall be,” Mary agreed.  At that they began circling for a landing.                    *       *       *       *       *  At 2:15 that night they had breakfast sitting on stools in a little all-night stand.  “Lots of coffee and plenty of oatmeal with cream,” was Mary’s order.  “And good, brown toast with well-done bacon,” Sparky added.  “Nervous?” he asked as her fingers shook a bit.  “Yes.”  “That’s fine. I wouldn’t give a plugged nickel for a partner that didn’t have nerves. It’s part of our equipment. Keeps us on our toes. But you’re not scared?”  “Just a little.”  “Don’t be!” He grinned. “It’s only a step.”  “Pretty long step.” She smiled back at him.  “Eighteen hundred miles, plus, and water under us all the way. What could be sweeter? And we’ll be flying out to meet the dawn.”  “Oh, Sparky!” she exclaimed. “That does sound swell! I never did like night. Just to think that we’re hurrying away to meet the sun that is just popping along to meet us! That sure is something.”  The food was excellent so she ordered a lunch “to go” and, producing a gallon thermos bottle, ordered it filled with coffee.  “That,” said Sparky, “will be frozen solid. We’re going to be flying up there among the stars.”  “Oh, no, it won’t,” she gave him a sly smile. “There are some advantages in having a gal for a co-pilot. One of the advantages is a hot lunch half way across.”  “Tasting is believing.” He was a skeptic.  “Wait and see.”  “I’ll wait.”  Ten minutes later they were at the airport and with their arrival a burden seemed to fall upon Mary’s slender shoulders. She had started out light-heartedly enough to do, with her companion, Janet, what no woman of the Ferry Command had ever done before, to ferry a big ship half way round the world. What was more, their ship was to carry a light cargo of vital war equipment. Now her companion was gone. Sparky had taken her place. They had started out forty planes strong. Now one plane was out of action and thirty-eight were a full day ahead of them.  “We’ll have to go it alone,” she said, speaking half to herself and half to Sparky.  “That’s it,” Sparky agreed. “The Fates have arranged that.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _“We’ll Have to Go It Alone,” Said Mary_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “And our cargo is priceless. That’s what the Major said.”  “Priceless,” he agreed. “It’s quite as important that it should arrive safely as, well perhaps, as it is for all those big bombers ahead of us to go through.  “But, Mary,” his voice changed, “don’t think of it that way. You’ll tighten up if you do. That might prove fatal. You have to be relaxed, flexible, ready for anything. That’s how you have to be.”  “I—I’ll try to forget that cargo,” she agreed.  “Well,” he breathed, “here’s our ship all primed up and rarin’ to go. Come on. Let’s climb up.”  Once again he handed her the “Form One” card. This time she studied it with supreme care. It told her that the engines were in perfect order, that the tubes of carbon dioxide snow for fire prevention were full as were their oxygen tubes, and that fuel and oil supply were at their maximum.  When she had studied the card, she nodded to Sparky, and at once, he began thumbing the oil gage.  “Do you always check your oil supply?” she asked.  “Always,” was the emphatic reply, “regardless of the report on the card, test your fuel. If you want to keep on living, you’ll always do that. Men are human. An attendant may read your report, note that your No. 1 tank is short a hundred gallons, record that he is putting that amount in, then discover that he has but fifty gallons to spare. He forgets to record the change and—”  “Right out over an endless forest your engine coughs and dies. No gas—I see,” she replied soberly.  “Gas and oil okay,” Sparky murmured. Then in silence he flipped on the ignition and gas, set the electric primer going, counted five, allowed it to snap off, then nodded "]]]
