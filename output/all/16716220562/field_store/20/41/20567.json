Christ died for him.  He should be     A man for Christ.  He is his own     And God’s and man’s, not mine alone.     He was not mine to give.  He gave     Himself, that he might help to save     All that a Christian should revere     All that enlightened men hold dear.      \"To feed the guns.\"  Ah! torpid soul,     Awake, and see life as a whole.     When freedom, honor, justice, right,     Were threatened by the despot’s might,     He bravely went for God, to fight     Against base savages, whose pride     The laws of God and man defied;     Who slew the mother and the child;     Who maidens, pure and sweet, defiled;     He did not go to feed the guns,     He went to save from ruthless Huns     His home and country, and to be     A guardian of democracy.      \"What if he does not come?\" you say;     Well, then, my sky will be more gray,     But through the clouds the sun will shine     And vital memories be mine.     God’s test of manhood is, I know     Not, will he come--_but did he go_?      JAMES L. HUGHES.                                    *PREFACE*   The sketches in this book and in my previous one, \"The Cross at the Front,\" are attempts to show the soul of the soldier serving in France as I have seen it during the year and a half that I have been with him. It is a padre’s privilege and duty to be the voice with which, in public worship, the soldiers speak to God; and through which their last thoughts are borne to their friends at home.  He is their voice both when they are sick or wounded, and when they lie silent in the grave. He speaks of their hopes and fears, hardships and heroisms, laughter and tears.  As best he may he tries to tell, to those who have a right and a longing to know, how they thought, and how they bore themselves in the great day of trial when all risked their lives and many laid them down.  Soldiers, as a rule, are either inarticulate or do not care to speak of themselves; and the padre has to be their spokesman if ever their deeper thoughts and finer actions are to be known to their friends.  To do this he may have to bring himself into the picture, or even illustrate a common thing in their lives by a personal experience of his own.  To reveal life and thought at the Front in the third person, and without sacrificing truth and vividness, requires a degree of literary power and art which cannot be expected of a padre to whom writing is but a by-product, and not his main work.  I have written but little of military operations--these things are not in my province. Moreover, they are not the things which are most revealing.  The presence of Spring is first and most surely revealed by the flowers in our gardens and lanes; and the soldier is most clearly seen in the little things that happen on the march--in his billet or in the Dressing Station.  Some things are not seen at all.  They are only felt, and my opinion about them must be taken for what it is worth.  One knows what the men are by their influence on one’s own mind and life.  I do not judge the morality and spirituality of our soldiers entirely by their habits and speech, for these are but outward and clumsy expressions of the inner life and are largely conventional.  There is something else to put in the reckoning, and to find out what the soldiers are worth to us we must somehow get behind their words and actions and find out what they are worth to God, whose terrible wheel of war is shaping their characters.  I appraise them mostly by the total effect of the impact of their souls on mine.  I know their thoughts and feelings by the thoughts and feelings they inspire in me.  \"Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?\"  There are certain thoughts and emotions that only come to me strongly when I am with the soldiers or when I am living again with them in memory, and so, I take these as their gift to me and judge the men by their influence on my character.  Character is, in its influence, subtle as Spring.  Words and actions by themselves are too coarse and conventional to do anything but mislead us in judging the quality of our men.  \"By their fruits ye shall know them.\"  Not by their leaves.  Fruit is _seed_.  In the seed the tree reproduces itself. And reproduction, whether in physical, moral or spiritual life, is the test of vitality.  I have not unduly loaded my pages with ghastly details of war, because their effect on the mind of the reader who has not been at the Front would be false and distorting.  The reader would be more horrified in imagining them than our soldiers are in seeing them.  I have tried rather to show life at the Front, with its mingling of red and gold, horror and happiness, as it affects the soldier; so that his friends at home may see it as he sees it, and with his sense of proportion.  If I could only do it, as well as I intend it, my pictures would create a truer sympathy between the home and the trench.  Some would find comfort for their hearts, and others would awake to a new and noble seriousness. Soldiers have suffered much through imperfect sympathies.  They have been pitied for the wrong things, and left to freeze when they needed warmth. Only when we realize their dignity and greatness and the true nature of their experiences can we be their comrades and helpers.  Life at the Front is brutal and terrifying, and yet our soldiers are neither brutalized nor terrorized, for there is something great and noble at the Front which keeps life pure and sweet and the men gentle and chivalrous. When \"the boys\" come home their friends will, in almost every case, find them just as bright, affectionate and good as when they went out. The only change will be a subtle one--a deepening in character and manly quality, a broadening in mind and creed, and an impatience with cant and make-believe whether in politics or business, Christianity or Rationalism. There will be an air of indefinable greatness about them as of men who have been at grips with the realities of life and death.  In a footnote to one of his songs, Edward Teschemacher says that the gypsies, as they wander through the country, leave a sprinkling of grass or wild flowers at the cross-roads to indicate, to those who come after them, the road they have taken.  These flowers are known as the \"Patterain.\"  These essays are my Patterain--wild flowers plucked in France, and left to mark the red path trod during the months I have been with my comrades at the Front.  I would the flowers were worthier, but such as I have, I give; and they are taken out of my heart.      \"Where my caravan has rested       Flowers I leave you on the grass;     All the flowers of love and memory;       You will find them when you pass.\"      THOMAS TIPLADY.

After Winter, Spring                                       *I*                            *THE SWAN AT YPRES*   For three years the storm center of the British battle front has been at Ypres. Every day and night it has been the standing target of thousands of guns.  Yet, amid all the havoc and thunder of the artillery, the graceful white form of a swan had been seen gliding over the water of the moat.  It never lacked food, and was always welcome to a share of Tommy’s rations.  In the Battle of Messines--I had the story first-hand from a lieutenant of artillery whose battery was hidden close by, and who was an eye-witness of the incident--a shell burst near the swan, and it was mortally wounded.  For three long years it had spread its white wings as gallantly as the white sails of Drake’s flagship when he sailed out of Plymouth Sound to pluck the beard of the Spaniard.  But now its adventurous voyaging was over.  Another beautiful and innocent thing had been destroyed by the war and had passed beyond recall.  There was no dying swan-song heard on the waters, but all who saw its passing felt that the war had taken on a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46323"],["title","The Soul of the Soldier: Sketches from the Western Battle-Front (#1)"],["body","shade of tragedy.  Many a \"white man\" had been slain near the spot but somehow the swan seemed a mystical being, and invulnerable.  It was a relic of the days of peace, and a sign of the survival of purity and grace amid the horrors and cruelties of war.  It spoke of the sacred things that yet remain--the beautiful things of the soul upon which war can lay no defiling finger. Now it had gone from the water and Ypres seems more charred than ever, and the war more terrible.  The death of the swan revealed against its white wings the peculiar inhumanity of the present war.  It is a war in which the enemy spares nothing and no one.  He is more blind and merciless than the Angel of Death which swept over Egypt, for the angel had regard to the blood which the Israelites had sprinkled over the lintels of their doors and he passed by in mercy.  To the German Eagle every living creature is legitimate prey.  No blood upon the lintel can save the inmate; not even the cross of blood on the hospital tent or ship.  Wounded or whole, combatant or non-combatant, its beak and talons tear the tender flesh of all and its lust is not sated.  In Belgium and Serbia it is believed that more women and children perished than men. Things too hideous for words were done publicly in the market-squares.  Neither age nor sex escaped fire and sword.  The innocent babe was left to suck the breast of its dead mother or was dandled on the point of the bayonet. What resistance can the Belgian swan make to the German eagle?  It needs must lie torn and bleeding beneath its talons.  The German Emperor has waded deeper in blood than Macbeth, and has slain the innocent in their sleep.  Even the sea is full of the women, children, and non-combatant men he has drowned.  His crown is cemented together with innocent blood and its jewels are the eyes of murdered men and women.  The wretched man has made rivers of blood to flow yet not a drop in them is from his own veins or the veins of his many sons.  Napoleon risked his life with his men in every battle but this man never once.  While sending millions to their death he yet consents to live, and protects his life with the anxious care a miser bestows on his gold.  Alone among large families in Germany his household is without a casualty. Though a nation be white and innocent as the Belgian swan it will not escape his sword, and he will swoop upon it the more readily because it is unarmed.  The swan cannot live where the eagle flies, and one or the other must die.  But the stricken swan of Ypres is not merely the symbol of Belgium and her fate.  There are other innocents who have perished or been sorely wounded.  The whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain.  The neutral nations are suffering with the belligerent, and the lower creatures are suffering with mankind.  Next to seeing wounded men on the roads at the front, I think the saddest sight is that of dying horses and mules.  Last winter they had to stand, with little cover, exposed to the bitter blasts.  It was impossible to keep them clean or dry, for the roads were churned into liquid mud and both mules and drivers were plastered with it from head to foot.  To make things worse there was a shortage of fodder; and horses waste away rapidly under ill-feeding. Before the fine weather had given them a chance to recover weight and strength, the Battle of Arras began, and every living beast of burden, as well as every motor-engine, was strained to its utmost.  The mule is magnificent for war, and our battles have been won as much by mules as men.  Haig could rely on one as much as on the other.  The mule will eat anything, endure anything, and, when understood and humored by its driver, will do anything.  It works until it falls dead by the roadside.  In the spring, hundreds died in harness.  In fact, few die except in harness.  They die facing the foe, dragging rations along shell-swept roads to the men in the trenches.  On two miles of road I have counted a dozen dead mules; and burial parties are sent out to put them out of sight.  One night, alone, I got three dying mules shot.  The road was crowded with traffic, yet it was difficult to find either an officer with a revolver or a transport-driver with a rifle.  I had to approach scores before I could find a man who had the means to put a mule out of its misery; and we were within two miles of our Front.  So rigid is our line of defense that those behind it do not trouble to take arms.  Even when I found a rifleman he hesitated to shoot a mule.  There is a rule that no horse or mule must be shot without proper authority, and when you consider the enormous cost of one the necessity for the rule is obvious. I had therefore to assure a rifleman that I would take full responsibility for his action. He then loaded up, put the nozzle against the mule’s forehead and pulled the trigger.  A tremor passed through the poor thing’s body and its troubles were over.  It had come all the way from South America to wear itself out carrying food to fighting men, and it died by the road when its last ounce of strength was spent.  The mule knows neither love nor offspring. Apart from a few gambols in the field, or while tethered to the horse-lines, it knows nothing but work.  It is the supreme type of the drudge.  It is one of the greatest factors in the war, and yet it receives scarcely any recognition and more of whipping than of praise.  Only too often I have seen their poor shell-mangled bodies lying by the roadside waiting till the battle allowed time for their burial.  Yet what could be more innocent of any responsibility for the war?  They are as innocent as the swan on the moat at Ypres.  Yet the greatest suffering among innocents is not found at the Front at all.  It is found at home.  At the Front there is suffering of body and mind, but at home there is the suffering of the heart.  Every soldier knows that his mother and wife suffer more than he does, and he pities them from his soul.  War is a cross on which Woman is crucified.  The soldier dies of his wounds in the morning of life, but his wife lingers on in pain through the long garish day until the evening shadows fall. There is no laughter at home such as you hear at the Front, or even in the hospitals.  One finds a gayety among the regiments in France such as is unknown among the people left at home.  It is the sunshine of the street as compared with the light in a shaded room.  There is a youth and buoyancy at the Front that one misses sadly in the homeland.  To a true woman with a son or husband at the Front, life becomes a nightmare.  To her distorted imagination the most important man in the country is not the Prime Minister but the postman.  She cannot get on with her breakfast for listening for his footsteps.  There is no need for him to knock at the door, she has heard him open the gate and walk up the gravel path.  Her heart is tossed like a bubble on the winds of hope and fear.  She finds herself behind the door without knowing how she got there, and her hand trembles as she picks up the letter to see if the address is in \"his\" handwriting or an official’s.  The words, \"On His Majesty’s Service,\" she dreads like a witch’s incantation.  They may be innocent enough, and cover nothing more than belated Commission Papers, but she trembles lest they should be but the fair face of a dark-hearted messenger, who is to blot out the light of her life forever.  If she goes out shopping and sees a telegraph-boy go in the direction of her home she forgets her purchases and hurries back to see if he is going to knock at her door.  The rosy-faced messenger has become a sinister figure, an imp from the nether world.  He may be bringing news of her loved one’s arrival \"on leave,\" but so many evil faces of fear and doubt peer through the windows of her heart that she cannot believe in the innocence and good-will of the whistling boy.  Her whole world is wrapped up in his little orange-colored envelope.  The boys at the Front know of the anxiety and suspense that darken their homes, and they do all they can to lighten them.  There were times on the Somme when the men were utterly exhausted with fighting and long vigils in the trenches.  Water was scarce, and a mild dysentery came into evidence.  No fire could be lighted to cook food or make hot tea. The ranks had been thinned, and only two officers were left to each company.  The weather was bad and the captured trench uncomfortable. Any moment word might come for another attack.  The campaign was near its close, and the work must be completed despite the prevalent exhaustion. The officers were too tired, depressed and preoccupied to censor hundreds of letters.  In front of him each could see a gaping grave. The sun was rapidly \"going west\" and leaving them to the cold and dark. Nothing seemed to matter in comparison with _that_. To hold services were impossible and I felt that the best I could do was to walk through the trench, chat with the officers and men, gather up the men’s letters and take them back and censor in my tent.  This gave the officers times to write their own, and an opportunity to post them.  But note, I pray you, the nobility of these gallant fellows.  All of them were exhausted and depressed.  The shadows of death were thick about them, yet when I opened their letters, I found myself--with two exceptions out of three or four hundred--in an entirely different atmosphere.  It was a sunny atmosphere in which birds were singing.  The men said nothing of their suffering, their depression, their fears for the future.  The black wings of death cast no shadow over their pages. They said they were \"all right,\" \"merry and bright\" and \"soon going back for a long rest.\"  They told their mothers what kind of cigarettes to send, and gave them details how to make up the next parcel.  They talked as if death were out of sight--a sinister fellow with whom they had nothing to do.  The officers, of "]]]
