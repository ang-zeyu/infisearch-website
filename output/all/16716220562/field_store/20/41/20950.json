Her army cot creaked.  “You’ll have to lie still,” she told herself sternly. “You’ll keep the other girls awake.”  Even as she thought this, the girl on the cot next to her own half rose to whisper:  “We’re Mrs. Hobby’s horses now.”  “That’s the girl called Betty,” Norma thought as she barely suppressed a disturbing laugh.  “Shish,” she managed to whisper. Then all was silent where, row on row, fifty girls were sleeping. Fifty! And Norma had spoken to barely half a dozen of them! It was all very strange.  Strange and exciting. Yes, it had surely been all that. They had all been jumpy, nervous as colts, on the train from Chicago. If they were walking down the aisle and the train tipped, they had laughed loudly. They had been high-pitched, nervous laughs. And why not? Had they not launched themselves on a new and striking adventure?  As Norma recalled all this she suddenly started, then rose silently on one shoulder. She had caught a flash of light where no light was supposed to be.  “A flash of light,” she whispered silently. At the same instant she caught the gleam of light once more. This time she located it—at the head of the cot by the nearest window.  “Rosa Rosetti!” she thought, with a start. She did not know the girl, barely recalled her name. She had a beaming smile, yet beyond doubt was foreign-born.  “What would you do if you suspected that someone was a spy?” That question had, not twenty-four hours before, been put to her by a very important person. She had answered as best she could. Had her answer been the correct one? Her reply had been:  “Nothing. At least, not at once.”  Now she settled back in her place. The flash of light from the head of Rosa Rosetti’s cot did not shine again. Nor did Norma Kent fall asleep at once.  “A flash of light in the night,” she was thinking. “How very unimportant!”  And yet, as her thoughts drifted back to her childhood days not so long ago—she was barely twenty-one now and just out of college—she recalled a story told by her father, a World War veteran. The story dealt with a stranger in an American uniform who, claiming to be lost from his outfit, had found refuge in their billet for the night.  “That night,” her father had said, “flashes of light were noticed at the window of our attic lodging. And that night, too, our village was bombed.”  “Suppose we are bombed tonight?” the girl thought. Then she laughed silently, for she was lodged deep in the heart of Iowa, at old Fort Des Moines.  As the name drifted through her dreamy thoughts, it gave her a start. She was fully awake again, for the full weight of the tremendous move she had made came crashing back upon her.  “I’m a WAC,” she whispered, “a WAC! I’m in the Army now!”  Yes, that was it. She was a member of the Woman’s Army Corps. So, too, were all the girls sleeping so peacefully there. Here at Fort Des Moines in four short weeks they would receive their basic training. And then—“I may drive a truck,” she thought with a thrill, “or operate an army short-wave set, or help watch for enemy planes along the seacoast, or—” she caught her breath, “I may be sent overseas.” North Africa, the Solomons, the bleak shores of Alaska—all these and more drifted before her mind’s eye.  “Come what may,” she whispered, “I am ready!”  She might have fallen asleep then had not a cot less than ten feet from her given out a low creak as a tall, strong girl, who had caught her eye from the first, sat straight up in her bed to whisper three words.  The words were whispered in a foreign tongue. Norma was mildly shocked at hearing them whispered here in the night.  “She was talking in her sleep,” Norma assured herself as the girl settled quietly back in her place. Then it came to her with the force of a blow. “She too might be a spy!”  “What nonsense!” she chided herself. “How jittery I am tonight! I’ll go to sleep. And here’s hoping I don’t dream.”  She did fall asleep, and she did not dream.  From some place very, very far away, a bugle was blowing and someone seemed to sing, “I can’t get ’em up, I can’t get ’em up. I can’t get ’em up in the morning.” Then an alarm clock went off with a bang and Norma, the WAC recruit, was awake.  Her feet hit the floor with a slap and she was putting on her clothes before she knew it. A race to the washroom, a hasty hair-do, a dash of color to her cheeks and, twenty minutes later, together with thirty other raw recruits, she lined up for Assembly.  It was bitter cold. A sharp wind was blowing. A bleak dawn was showing in the east. Norma shivered in spite of her thick tweed coat. She looked at the slender girl next to her and was ashamed. The girl’s lips were blue. Her thin and threadbare coat flapped in the breeze. She wanted to wrap this girl inside her coat, but did not. This would be quite unsoldierlike. So she stood at rigid attention. But out of the corner of her mouth she said:  “It won’t be long now. Those soldier suits we’ll wear are grand.”  “It wo-won’t be-be long!” the girl replied cheerfully through chattering teeth.  Norma permitted herself one quick flashing look to right and left. To her right, beyond the slender girl, stood the tall girl who had whispered so strangely in her sleep. Wrapped in a long black fur coat she stood primly at attention. There was something about this girl’s prim indifference to those about her that irritated Norma.  She turned to the left to find herself looking into a pair of smiling blue eyes. The girl said never a word but her bright smile spoke volumes. This girl’s dress, short squirrelskin coat, heavy skirt, neat shoes, and small hat spoke both of taste and money. Beyond this girl stood the little Italian who flashed a light at night. She stood, lips parted, eyes shining, sturdy young body erect, very sure of herself and unafraid.  “Whatever happens, I’m going to like her a lot, and that can’t be helped,” Norma assured herself.  Five minutes later they were all back in the barracks making up their bunks and preparing for a busy day ahead.  “Bedding down Mrs. Hobby’s horses,” said a laughing voice.  “Say! What does that mean?” Norma demanded, looking up from her work into a pair of laughing blue eyes.  “Don’t you know?” asked the other girl, as she sat down on her cot.  “I don’t. That’s a fact,” Norma admitted.  “Well, I’ll tell you. But first,” the other girl put out a hand, “my name’s Betty Gale. Something tells me that we’ve both just finished college and that we’re likely to be pals in this great adventure until death or some Lady Major does us part.”  “You’re right in the first count,” Norma laughed. “And I hope you are in the second. My name is Norma Kent.”  “Swell,” said Betty Gale. “Now—about Mrs. Hobby’s Horses.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER II                             THE TEST THAT TOLD   “Mrs. Hobby’s Horses.” Betty laughed. “That’s really no great secret. Perhaps you didn’t notice it, but we’ve been sleeping in a stable.”  “A stable!”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48599"],["title","Norma Kent of the WACS (#1)"],["body","stared. “A stable with polished floors?”  “Oh, they fixed them up, of course. But the row of buildings to which this belongs was all stables only a short while ago.”  “For horses?”  “Why not?” Betty laughed again. “Fort Des Moines has always been a cavalry post.”  “Oh! And I suppose it was from these very stables that cavalry horsemen rode thundering away to fight the Indians.”  “Absolutely!”  “How romantic!” Norma exclaimed. “But I still don’t see what that’s got to do with hobby horses.”  “I didn’t say hobby horses. I said they called us Mrs. Hobby’s horses. Don’t you see?” Betty’s voice dropped. “Mrs. Hobby is director of the Corps. And they say she’s a wonder. All of us raw recruits must spend a week in these stables before we go to live in Boom Town. So you see, they call us Mrs. Hobby’s horses.”  “But Boom Town? Where’s that?” Norma demanded.  “Oh! Come on!” Betty exclaimed. “You want to know too much too soon. Let’s get our bunks made. We have a lot of things to do this day. One of them is to eat breakfast. That cold air made me hungry. Let’s get going.”  A short time later they found themselves caught in a brown stream of WACs pouring toward a long, low building. Once inside they were greeted with the glorious odor of frying bacon, brewing coffee, and all that goes with a big delicious breakfast.  And was it big! In this mess hall twenty-five hundred girls were being served.  As she joined the long line that moved rapidly forward Norma was all but overcome by the feeling that she was part of something mammoth and wonderful.  “It’s big!” she exclaimed.  “Biggest thing in all the world.” Betty pressed her arm. “We’re in the Army now!”  Yes, they were in the Army. And this was Army food. On their sectional trays, oatmeal, toast and bacon were piled.  Their cups were a marvel to behold. Half an inch thick, big as a pint jar, and entirely void of handles, they presented a real problem. But Norma mastered the art of an Army coffee drinker in one stride. So too did Millie, the girl from a department store.  “Boy!” Millie giggled, balancing her cup in one hand. “Now let the Japs come! I’ll get one of them and never even nick this cup! Honest,” she confided, “I think this is going to be fun.”  “Fun, and lots of work,” was Norma’s reply.  “Oh! Work!” Millie sobered. “Lead me to it! It can’t be worse than Shield’s Bargain Basement during the Christmas rush. It’s ‘Can you find me this?’ or ‘Can you give me that?’ and ‘Miss Martin, do this,’ and ‘Miss Martin, do that,’ hours and hours on end. Bad air, cross customers, bossy floorwalkers. And for what? I ask you? Sixteen dollars a week!”  “Could you live on that?” Norma asked in surprise.  “No, but I did,” Millie giggled. “But honest, I think this will be a lot better.”  “It’s not so much a matter of it being better or worse,” Norma replied soberly, “as it is of what we have to give. This is war, you know. Our war!”  “Yes, I know.” The little salesgirl, it seems, had a serious side to her nature. “I’ve thought about that, too. In the city where they examined us they said I might do library work. I sold books, you know, and I know an awful lot about them. And I can cook, too,” she added hopefully.  “They have a cooking and baking school,” Betty encouraged. “They teach you how to cook in a mess hall and out of doors for a few people and a great many. Perhaps for a thousand people at a time. And you do it all in the baggage car of a special train.”  “Ee-magine little me cooking for a thousand people!” Millie wilted like an unwatered flower. “Honest, girls, I’m just scared stiff! I couldn’t go back! I just couldn’t! I’d rather die! And today they give us our special interviews and everything.”  “You’ll make it all right,” Betty assured her. “Just drink the rest of your coffee. That will pep you up.”  Once again Millie lifted her huge army cup. “Here’s to us all,” she laughed.  At that they clinked their cups and drank to their day that had just begun.  Mid-afternoon found Norma sitting at the end of a row of girls, waiting her turn at a private interview. In twenty-five open booths twenty-five interviewers sat smilingly asking questions in low tones of twenty-five new recruits, and carefully writing down the answers. In her row as she sat waiting her turn Norma saw Lena, the tall, strong girl who whispered strangely in the night, Rosa, who had flashed a light, Betty, Millie, and a few others.  As she waited—just waited—she began to be a little afraid. The interviewers were smiling, but after all, those were serious smiles. She could not hear the questions. She could guess them. These interviewers were asking, “What can you do? What would you like most to do? What else can you do?”  All of a sudden Norma realized that she had never done a real day’s work in all her life. She had always gone to school. Oh, yes! She could cook, just a little. But so little!  “I guess,” she thought, “that I’m what they call a typical American college girl, not a bad student, and not too good, fairly good at tennis and basketball. I’ve got brown hair and eyes, and I’m not too tall nor yet too short.” She laughed in spite of herself. “A good fellow, and all that. But,” she sobered, “what can I do? What do I want to do? What else can I do?”  She had felt a little sorry for the shopgirl, Millie. Now she envied her. Millie knew all about books and she could really cook. At this very moment, smiling with fresh-born confidence, Millie was stepping into a booth for her trial-by-words. And she, Norma Kent, a college graduate, sat there shivering in her boots! Surely this was a strange world.  The booth that Millie had entered was wide open. Norma could see all but hear nothing of what went on. At first she was interested in watching the smiles and frowns that played across Millie’s frank and mobile face. Of a sudden her interest was caught and held by the examiner. Tall, slim, looking very much the soldier in her neatly pressed uniform that bore a lieutenant’s bar on its shoulder, this examiner seemed just what Norma hoped in time to become—a real soldier.  “She’s not too young—perhaps thirty,” the girl told herself. “And she’s wearing some sort of medal pinned to her breast. Say! That’s strange!”  And indeed it was strange. The Woman’s Army Corps was as yet very young. Only a few had gone overseas and none, as far as she knew, had either won honors or returned to America.  “She’s keen,” she whispered to the girl next to her.  “Who?” The girl stared.  “That examiner,” Nonna nodded toward the booth.  “Oh! Oh sure!” The other girl resumed polishing her nails.  “All the same she is,” Norma told herself. “And I’d like to know her.”  As Millie, the shopgirl, at last rose from her place, a happy smile played about her lips.  “She made it,” Norma said aloud. “And am I glad!” She smiled at Millie as she passed.  Lena, the “night whisperer” was next to enter the vacated booth. As the interviewer began her task her body appeared to stiffen.  “On her guard,” Norma thought. “I wonder why.”  On the officer’s face there was still a smile, but somehow it was a different sort of smile.  And the tall girl? She too seemed rather strange. She appeared always on her guard. “As if she were speaking a piece and feared she might forget,” was Norma’s thought.  Still, in the end all must have gone well for, as she passed her on the way out, the tall girl flashed Norma a look that said plainer than words. “See? That’s how you do it.”  Whatever may have been Norma’s reactions to this they were quickly lost, for suddenly she realized that the black eyes of the examining officer were upon her and that her name was being called. Her time had come. Swallowing hard, she rose to step into the booth.  “You are Norma Kent,” said the examiner, flashing her a friendly smile. “And your home is—”  “Greenvale, Illinois,” was the prompt reply. The date of her birth, when she entered and left grade school, high school, and college, and other details followed.  “And now,” said the examiner, leaning forward, “what can you do?”  “I—I really don’t know,” the girl faltered. “I’ve never worked at anything.”  “Ah! So you’ve never worked? Can you cook?”  “Not very well.”  “I see.” The examiner studied Norma’s face.  “How many in your family?”  “Just father and I.”  “And your father? What does he do?”  “He’s with the Telephone Company, in charge of a wide territory—equipment and all that.”  “Hmm.” The examiner studied her report. “Just two of you. You should be great pals.”  “Oh—we are!” Norma’s eyes shone. “You see,” she exclaimed, “Dad was in the other World War. I’ve always loved him for that. He was in France.”  “France,” said the examiner, with a quick intake of breath. Norma did not at all understand. “What a lovely land to die for.”  “Dad lost his right arm,” Norma stated in a matter-of-fact tone. “That’s why he can’t go back this time, and—and that’s why he wants me to go.”  “Would you like to go overseas?” The examiner’s eyes shone with a strange new light.  “I’d love to!” the girl whispered hoarsely. “But what could I do?”  “Oh! Loads of things.” The examiner made a record on her sheet. “Your father must have driven about a great deal looking things over in his present occupation.”  “Of course.”  “Did you ever go with him?”  “Oh! Many, many times!”  “Did you ever assist him?”  “Oh, yes! Of course! It was all great fun. He had big charts showing every center, every phone. I helped him mark down each new installation.”  “Ah!” the examiner breathed.  “Yes, and we had a grand little shop in the basement where we worked things out—lots of new things.” Norma’s eyes shone. “There were many rural centers where the switchboards were in stores. When a number was called a light shone on the board. But that wasn’t enough. The storekeeper couldn’t always see the light.”  “And what did you do about it?”  “We fixed up a new board, just Dad and I. Put a tiny bell on every line.”  “I see. The light flashed, the bell rang, and then the storekeeper"]]]
