T. V. Eaton, of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, on March 9th, 1916.  Eaton had commanded the R.C.H.A. with our 1st Division in France in 1915.  He is a professional as well as a practical artillery officer, with years of theoretical and scientific study behind his experience in the field.  The command of the 9th Brigade, C.F.A., went to Lieutenant-Colonel H. G. Carscallen, who had long ago been mentioned in despatches for his work at the Front with the 11th Battery; that of the 10th to Lieutenant-Colonel G. H. Ralston, who distinguished himself as far back as June, 1915, at the \"Duck's Bill,\" when two guns of his battery were established and fought in our front-line trench, seventy-five yards distant from the German trench, with disastrous results to the enemy's wire, parapets, and machine-gun emplacements (see Vol. I., p. 133). Lieutenant-Colonel A. G. MacNaughton, late of the 2nd Brigade, C.F.A., was appointed to the 11th Brigade.  These four Brigades and their ammunition column went to France under the command of Brigadier-General J. H. Mitchell, late of the 3rd Brigade, C.F.A.  This officer had been mentioned in despatches and awarded the Legion of Honour, Croix d'Officier, a year before.  The 4th Canadian Division went to France in August, 1916, the 10th Infantry Brigade arriving on the 11th, the 11th Brigade on the 14th, and the 12th Brigade on the 15th.  On the 17th they assembled, and within the week were moved into positions on the war-torn front of the Ypres salient.  There they remained until the first week in October, when they joined the Canadian Corps on the Somme.  During their occupation of the Ypres salient each of the three Brigades was withdrawn in turn for a course of tactical training.  So it was that the autumn of 1916 saw the Canadian Army in France flooding to and beyond the one hundred thousand mark.  Four Divisions, according to the old establishment, which gave twenty-two thousand men of all ranks and arms to a division, would account for eighty-eight thousand Canadians in France at that time, but the development of the machine-gun service and the creation of trench-mortar batteries long ago caused the outgrowth and consequent revision of that establishment. And still, without the addition of a further Division, the Canadian Army Corps continued to grow, waxing greater daily to meet every progressive need and condition of modern warfare.  By January, 1917, Canada's man-power in France reached the significant total of one hundred and twelve thousand.  This figure takes no account of the wastage of battle.  The seriously wounded and work-worn who are returned to England are, like the dead, immediately struck out of the tally.  This figure stands for fit Canadians actively employed at the moment in first-hand combat with the enemy.  In the past, great battles have been won and long wars brought to a swift and violent end, tyrants have been broken, races enslaved, and thrones overturned by armies far weaker in numbers and in spirit than these fighting legions of Canada.  To enforce the significance of this Canadian Field Army of 112,000, we may compare the numbers engaged in some of the decisive battles of the past.  The army of Napoleon, for instance, numbered but 70,000 men when he broke the power of Austria and Russia at Austerlitz.  Wellington won the crushing victory of Vittoria, in the Peninsular War.  with a force of 65,000; and at Waterloo he commanded rather less than 68,000.  The terrific battle of Gettysburg, in the American Civil War, was fought by 78,000 Federals against the slightly smaller forces of the Southern Confederacy.  Even at the great battle of Sedan, which decided the issue of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the army of France, on which all her hopes were staked--and lost--numbered but 150,000.  From such figures may be estimated the importance of Canada's contribution in the present gigantic struggle for liberty and right.  In the summer of 1914 Canada was a land of peace, of self-interest, of political warfare, and commercial and agricultural prosperity; and now her thousands lie dead on foreign battlefields; thousands of her sons have returned to her, maimed, broken, and blind; her forward army fights on, continually bleeding yet continually growing in strength, reinforced from her trained troops in England; and to her own home camps and garrisons her sons continue to gather from counting-house, school, and farm.     CHAPTER II  HOLDING THE LINE  The Battle of Sanctuary Wood was fought and endured throughout the first two days of June, 1916.  Canada's resistance to that terrific and overwhelming onslaught of metal and men will live as long and gloriously as any victory in the great story of our arms.  During those two fateful days Canadian trenches were obliterated--blown out of the ground; dug-outs were buried and strong points crushed; woods in our positions were mown and torn to earth; Major-General Mercer was killed and one of our Brigade commanders wounded and taken prisoner.  The Canadian front was crushed by that indescribable deluge of exploding metal--but it was not broken.  Between the heroic actions in the Ypres salient in June (1st to 15th) and the commencement of our strenuous thrusts on the Somme front in mid-September, no unit of the Canadian Corps was in any major offensive operation.  But the routine work of holding and strengthening our positions continued with the full measure of that activity for which the Canadians have become famous.  The vitality of our opposition to the confronting masses of men and machinery did not lessen for an instant.  Relieved from the recent terrific efforts of defence and counter-attack, we were stationary yet aggressive.  Hostile trenches and strongholds were raided and bombarded, wire was cut by hand and smashed by shell-fire, and mines were sprung.  All arms continued to carry on enthusiastically, and the mental peace and physical security of the occupants of opposing positions were shattered constantly by bayonet and grenade, trench-bomb, bullet, and shell.  The following instances will serve to illustrate the nature of our activities throughout this period of waiting, of preparation, and of so-called quiet.  Dominion Day (July 1st) was celebrated by the 26th (New Brunswick) Battalion in a manner little appreciated by the grey ranks across the way.  Supported by the fire of our artillery and trench-mortars, two officers and twenty-five other ranks operated against a convenient point in the German front-line trench.  The assaulting party were observed and subjected to a brisk but inaccurate fire of machine-guns and rifles before they had passed the enemy's inner wire.  They pressed forward without a pause and rushed the parapet.  The garrison of the trench immediately retired from this threatened point except for three men, who stuck to their loopholes and continued firing.  Lieutenant Fleming accounted for one of these by thrusting his revolver into a loophole and returning the fire.  The trench was then entered and its remaining defenders disposed of.  After our party had investigated about forty yards of the trench they were driven out by a heavy bombardment of rifle-grenades and mortar-bombs.  They then returned to our own lines with a few slight casualties, some useful information, and a quantity of German equipment.  An encounter in No Man's Land between a patrol of the 22nd (French Canadian) Battalion and a German patrol on the night of July 4th resulted in the dispersion of the enemy and our capture of two prisoners.  Ten nights later a reconnoitring patrol from the 25th (Nova Scotia) Battalion attacked an enemy listening-post at the moment of its being strongly reinforced.  After a brisk exchange of grenades the Germans ran for their trench, leaving the field and one of their wounded to us.  On the night of the 25th a large German mine was blown in our lines on the Bluff.  This was not the enemy's first attempt to possess himself of that advantageous position.  It will be remembered that he attained his object in January of the same year and was not driven out until a month later, and then only at a heavy cost of killed and wounded. Fortunately the second attempt to secure a foothold on that ground failed utterly, thanks to the alertness and prompt action of our troops immediately concerned.  Briefly, the story of the foiled effort is this:--  The 1st Canadian Division, which had taken over the Bluff sector on the 22nd of the month, received warning two days later from Major North, of the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company, that the enemy might be depended upon to blow a mine very soon somewhere in the vicinity.  The localities which were considered with the liveliest suspicion were a point known as the Bean and Trench 33.  The Division immediately warned the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the menace; the G.O.C. the Brigade ordered reductions in the garrisons of the threatened positions, the covering of that section of front by machine-guns, and the detailing of parties for counter-attack and of other parties for the vital work of consolidation should a mine be blown.  The early hours of the night of the 25th were unusually quiet about the Bluff.  Artillery was silent.  Snipers and machine-gunners seemed half-hearted in their activities.  The 7th (British Columbia) Battalion was engaged in preparing for a relief which was to be completed by midnight.  At ten o'clock the quiet was shattered by a tremendous convulsion. Earth, fire, rock, and smoke belched to heaven.  Trenches vanished, engulfed.  Instantly the S.O.S. rocket went up.  Our machine-guns responded like crackling echoes of the explosion.  Within thirty seconds of the rocket-signal for help the guns of Dodd's Group commenced a crushing bombardment of the German positions which threatened the new crater."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46116"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume III (#3)"],["body","  Our counter-attacking parties advanced, armed with rifles, grenades, and machine-guns.  They occupied the forward lip of the crater, the flanking shell-holes overlooking its raw depths, certain points commanding the canal, and a ridge running between an historic old crater and the new.  The Germans, reinforced and ready for the dash from cover and the occupation of the Crater swarmed to their parapets, and swayed and seethed there for a little while like a headed wave about to break and flood forward.  Then the wave broke and subsided--backward instead of forward.  The great attack was dead, dead in the first half-minute of its furious and painful life, killed by the smashing fire of our artillery and the whipping hail of our machine-guns.  Within one and a half hours of the blowing of the mine the O.C. the 7th Battalion reported to his Brigadier that the menace was past, and that the new crater was being swiftly absorbed by our defensive positions. Our artillery reduced its fire by one-half.  Five minutes later the German artillery retaliation ceased, the fire of our machine-guns and artillery dropped to normal, and the relief of our infantry--which had been interrupted and delayed for nearly two hours--was calmly continued.  Owing to the precaution of thinning the garrisons in the threatened locality, our casualties were wonderfully light--less than fifty all told in killed, wounded, and missing.  It is safe to say that the enemy casualties, caused by our artillery, machine-guns, Stokes and trench-mortar batteries, were much heavier; and, in addition to their loss of life and limb, the Germans lost their adventure.  The months of toil devoted to the laying of the mine and the tons of explosive which comprised it failed to strengthen their position by a tittle or to weaken ours by a jot.  On the night of the 28th a patrol from the Nova Scotian Battalion (25th), consisting of a lieutenant, a sergeant, and four men, carried out a daring raid on a small scale.  They bombed the German trench at the point where they intended to enter, and were about to negotiate the parapet when a party of eight enemy bombers attacked them on the flank. In the brief but desperate fight which followed this unexpected distraction three of the Canadians were wounded and the eight Germans were disposed of.  Lieutenant Wise, with Sergeant Anderson and Private Johnson, then entered the hostile trench and discovered that their preliminary grenade-fire had killed five of the garrison.  They drove the enemy down the trench, until Anderson was wounded.  Lieutenant Wise ceased his offensive to help the sergeant over the parapet, and while thus engaged he received three wounds.  Johnson continued to drive the enemy until all his grenades were thrown.  He then escaped from the trench, returned to our lines, collected a rescue party, and led the way back to the scene of action.  All our wounded were found and brought in with the exception of Sergeant Anderson.  At half-past eight on the morning of the 29th the 19th (Ontario) Battalion made a daylight raid into the enemy trenches on the St. Eloi front between Ruined Farm and the Canal.  Two officers and the scouts of the Battalion had devoted every day and night of the preceding week to reconnoitring the ground over which the attack was to be made. During the night of the 28th the enemy's wire in front of the point selected for entry was hand-cut by two men of the Battalion. Machine-gun fire on the hostile parapet at the threatened point muffled the sound of the clipping of the wire.  The raiding party, consisting of Captain C. L. Kilmer Lieutenant H. B. Pepler, and eighteen N.C.O.'s and men, covered three-quarters of their journey between the lines by way of an old ditch, doubled across the remaining forty-five yards, passed through the gaps in the wire, and went over the parapet before they were discovered by the enemy.  They moved to the right and left along the trench, shooting and bombing.  Upon the approach of strong German reinforcements along a communication trench, the signal to retire was given and successfully obeyed.  During the evacuation of the trench the raiders suffered a few slight casualties from grenade-fire, and the two officers and a sergeant sustained shrapnel wounds.  Captain Kilmer was the last to leave the trench.  One of his ankles had been broken in the fight.  As he was unable to reach our lines unassisted, and unwilling to delay the retirement, he crawled into a shell-hole situated about eight yards in front of the German wire.  He was rescued from this insecure retreat by Lieutenant Burnham, Corporal Wilson, and Private Newton, who, covered by an accurate barrage from the guns of Stewart's Group, moved out to the shell-hole and back to our lines under a heavy fire of machine-guns and rifles.  In this, the first of our daylight raids, no prisoners were taken.  The action was too swift and the encounters were too violent to permit of the removal of a single living Hun; but the operation was highly successful.  The occupants of the trench were identified as the Royal Württembergers; valuable information of a technical nature was obtained; two machine-guns were put out of action and other machine-gun and trench-mortar emplacements located; many of the garrison of the trench were shot, and four large dug-outs, crowded with men, were effectively bombed; and it is reasonable to suppose that the casualties inflicted by our artillery were severe.  Lieutenant H. R. Dillon, Canadian Field Artillery, who acted as Forward Observation Officer throughout the operation, did splendid service, especially during the rescue of Captain Kilmer, when he stood fully exposed in No Man's Land at a point within forty yards of the German trench, and from there directed the fire of his battery.  Lieutenant Hooper, of the 19th Battalion, whose active command during the raid included a Lewis gun, snipers, and a telephonist, also did fine work.  On the night of August 5th-6th the 27th (City of Winnipeg) Battalion sent a raiding party into the enemy trenches opposite their front, with the usual objects of obtaining prisoners and information and inflicting casualties.  This raid was daringly executed; but the fighting in the trench was so severe that no prisoners were taken.  Lieutenant Harris was wounded while carrying a wounded German toward the point of entry. Two unwounded Germans were caught, but owing to their struggles and the depth of the trench the efforts of their captors to expel them over the parapet were ineffectual.  Eight nights later Lieutenant Clarkson of this same Battalion led another party into the enemy's lines and succeeded in bringing out a prisoner.  The garrison of the invaded trench suffered heavily.  Of Clarkson's party only one man was wounded.  A party from the 28th (North-West) Battalion, supported by the artillery of Stuart's Group, our trench-mortars, and Stokes guns, entered the enemy's trenches in the neighbourhood of Ruined Farm on the night of August 10th-11th.  Lieutenant T. L. O. Williams, who commanded the raiders, was wounded.  The enemy and his trenches were severely knocked about and a prisoner was brought back.  A dummy raid on the hostile positions at the Hollandscheschuur Farm and Quarante Wood salients was successfully practised by Dodd's Group, C.F.A., and the 10th (Ontario) Battalion in the early hours of August 15th.  The object of this long-headed enterprise was to draw the Germans in force into their front-line trenches and there drub them thoroughly with the combined fire of our field batteries, Stokes guns, and machine-guns.  At 3.45 a.m. three white flares were sent up from our lines, and at the same time the enemy's entanglements were violently shaken by means of strong wires which connected them with our forward positions.  The Germans immediately took alarm and subjected their own entanglements to a heavy grenade bombardment along the whole front from the Quarante Wood to the Chemin de Poperinghe.  Our artillery and Stokes guns then opened heavily and accurately on selected targets on the enemy front and support trenches.  The Germans promptly attempted a retaliation with the fire of a five-point-nine battery; but as their first two shells fell in their own lines at the Farm, the third in No Man's Land, and the next thirty-seven on various points behind and in their own defences, they soon became discouraged.  In addition to the casualties and material damage inflicted by our fire, the enemy must have suffered heavily from the erratic performance of his own five-point nines.  On the 17th a new strong point in the system of enemy trenches known as \"the Loop,\" in Sanctuary Wood, about two thousand yards east of Zillebeke, was subjected to a concentrated bombardment by our 6-inch howitzers and partially destroyed.  To complete its destruction the bombardment was resumed during the night of the 17th and 18th, and under cover of this bombardment a raid was undertaken by a party from the Royal Canadian Regiment against an advanced trench sector and bombing post in the immediate neighbourhood of \"the Loop.\"  The idea was to take the enemy by surprise while their attention was occupied by the bombardment, and to capture prisoners.  In both these respects, however, the operation was a failure, as the Germans were found fully prepared and \"standing to,\" with the post heavily manned, and not only were no prisoners taken, but not one of our men succeeded in getting into the trench.  The affair was memorable, however, for the amazing courage and audacity with which it was pushed, in the teeth of overwhelming and ready numbers, and for the resourcefulness and heroic devotion with which the three officers--Lieutenant Bole, leader of the raiding party, and Lieutenants Churchill and Munn, who had come to his assistance--succeeded in bringing all the wounded back to our lines. It was remarkable, too, for the slaughter inflicted in the crowded trench by this "]]]
