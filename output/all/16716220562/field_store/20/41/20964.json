And Other Christmas Stories (#1)"],["body","who has a pink sweetmeat,\" said the Little Blues, who couldn't help being pleased. \"And I'm for a real child. Wilhelm and Greta are more than half grown up.\"  \"Real children are very hard on their stockings, I've always heard,\" retorted the White Pair, who never could resist the temptation to say a disagreeable thing.  \"That may be, but it is all in the future. This one night is my own, and I mean to enjoy it,\" replied the contented Little Blue.  So the night went, and now it was the dawn of Christmas. With the first light the door opened softly and a little boy crept into the room. This was Jan. When he saw the three pairs of stockings hanging by the stove, he clapped his hands together, but softly, lest the noise should wake the others. Then he crossed the room on tiptoe and looked hard at the stockings. He soon made sure which pair was for himself, but he did not take them down immediately; only stood with his hands behind his back and gazed at them with two large, pleased eyes.  At last he put his hand up and gently touched the three, felt the little blue pair, gave it a pat, and finally unhooked it from its nail. Then he sat down on the floor, and began to put them on. His toe encountering an obstacle, he pulled the stocking off again, put his hand in, and extracted the pink sweetmeat, with which he was so pleased that he laughed aloud. That woke up the others, who presently came in.  \"Ah, little rogue that thou art! Always the first to waken,\" said his mother, pleased at his pleasure.  \"See, mother! see what I found!\" he cried. \"It is good--sweet! I have tasted a crumb already. Take some of it, mother.\"  But Mrs. Wendte shook her head.  \"No,\" she said. \"I do not care for sugar. That is for little folks like thee. Eat it thyself, Jan.\"  It was her saying this, perhaps, which prevented Wilhelm and Greta from making the same offer--at least, I hope so. Certain it is that neither of them made it. Greta ate hers up on the spot, with the frank greediness of a girl of twelve who does not often get candy. Wilhelm buttoned his up in his trousers pocket. All three made haste to put on the new stockings. The three pairs had only time to hastily whisper as they were separated:  \"To-night perhaps we may meet again.\"  Illustration: GRETA  The pink sweetmeat went into the pocket of Jan's jacket, and he carried it about with him all the morning. He did not eat it, because once eaten it would be gone, and it was a greater pleasure to have it to look forward to, than to enjoy it at the moment. Jan was a thrifty little boy, as you perceive.  Being Christmas, it was of course an idle day. Jacob Wendte never knew what to do with such. There was his pipe, and there was beer to be had, so in default of other occupation, he amused himself with these. Mrs. Wendte had her hands full with the dinner, and was frying sausages and mixing Yorkshire pudding all the morning. Only Greta went to church. She belonged to a parish-school where they gave Christmas prizes, and by no means intended to lose her chance; but, apart from that, she really loved church-going, for she spoke English and understood it better than either of the other children. Wilhelm went off on errands of his own.  Little Jan spent the morning in admiring his stockings, and in wrapping and unwrapping his precious sweetmeat, and taking it out of his pocket and putting it in again.  \"Why dost thou not eat it, dear?\" asked his mother, as she lifted the frying-pan from the stove.  But he answered: \"Oh! not yet. When once it is eaten, it is over. I will wait.\"  \"How long wilt thou wait?\" she asked.  Jan said bashfully: \"I don't know.\"  In truth, he had not made up his mind about the sweetmeat, only he felt instinctively that he did not want to hurry and shorten his pleasure.  Dinner over, he went out for a walk. Every now and then, as he marched along, his hand would steal into his pocket to finger his precious candy and make sure that it was safe.  It was a gray afternoon, but not snowing or raining. Hyde Park was not too far away for a walk, and Jan went there. The Serpentine was skimmed over with ice just strong enough to bear boys, and quite a little crowd was sliding or skating upon it. Jan could skate very well. He had learned in Holland, but he made no attempt to join the crowd. He was rather shy of English boys, for they sometimes laughed at his Hollander clothes or his Dutch accent, and he did not like to be laughed at.  So he strolled away, past the Serpentine and the skaters, and watched the riders in the Row for awhile. There were not a great many, for people who ride are apt to be out of London at the Christmas time; but there were some pretty horses, and one fair little girl on a pony who took Jan's fancy very much. He stood for a long time watching her trot up and down, and the idea occurred to him that he would like to give her his sweetmeat. He even put his hand into his pocket and half pulled it out, but the little girl did not look his way, and presently her father, with whom she was riding, spoke to her, and she turned her horse's head and trotted off through the marble arch. Jan dropped the sugar-plum again into his pocket, and felt as if his sudden fancy had been absurd; and indeed I think the little girl would have been surprised and puzzled what to do had he carried out the intention.  After the pony and his little mistress had departed, Jan lost his interest in the riders, and walked away across the park. Once he stopped to look at a dear little dog with a blue collar, who seemed to have lost his master, for he was wandering about by himself, and smelling everybody and everything he met, as if to recover a lost trail. Jan called him. He came up in a very friendly way and allowed himself to be patted, and once more the sweetmeat was in danger, for Jan had taken it out with the intention of dividing it with this new friend, when a whistle was heard which the little dog evidently recognized, and he darted off at once to join his master. So again the pink sweetmeat was put back into Jan's pocket, and he walked on.  He had gone quite a distance when he saw a number of people collected round the foot of a tree. A ladder was set against one of the lower branches, and a man had climbed up nearly to the top of the tree. Jan, like a true boy, lost no time in joining the crowd, but at first he could not make out what was going on. The boughs were thick. All that he could see was the man's back high up overhead, and what he was doing he could not guess.  A benevolent-looking old gentleman stood near and Jan heard him exclaim with great excitement:  \"There, he's got him! No, he's not; but it was a close shave!\"  \"Got what, sir?\" he ventured to ask.  \"Why, the rook, to be sure.\"  Then, seeing that Jan still looked puzzled, he took the trouble to explain.  \"You see that rook up there, my lad, don't you?\" Jan had not seen any rook at all! \"Well, it is caught in some way, how, I can't tell you, but it can't get away from the tree. It has been there three days, they say, and all that time the other rooks have brought food to it, and kept it from starving. Now some one has gone up to see what is the difficulty, and, if possible, to set the poor thing free.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Jan.  And the old gentleman looked at him kindly, and said to himself:  \"A very civil, tidy little lad! I like his face.\"  Jan had now become deeply interested in what was going on. He stood on tiptoe, and stretched his neck; but all he could see was the man's back and one of his feet, and now and then the movement of a stick with which the man seemed to be trying to hit something. At last there was a great plunge and a rustling of branches, and people began to hurrah. Jan hurrahed too, though he still saw nothing very clearly; but it is easier to shout when other boys shout, if you happen to be a boy, than it is to keep still.  Slowly the man in the tree began to come down. He had only one hand to help himself with now, for the other held the heavy rook. We in America do not know what rooks are like, but in England they are common enough. They are large black birds, something like our crows, but they look wiser, and are a good deal bigger.  As the man neared the ground every one in the crowd could see what had been the matter with the rook. A kite-string caught among the tree branches, had tangled his legs and held him fast. He had pulled so hard in his efforts to escape that the string had cut into one of his legs and half broken it. It was stiff and bleeding, and the rook could neither fly nor hop. People searched in their pockets, and one little girl, who had a half biscuit, fed the rook, who, for all the kindly efforts of his friends, seemed to be half-famished. The poor thing was too weak to struggle or be frightened, and took the crumbs eagerly from the girl's hand.  Jan thought of his sweetmeat, and took it out for the third time. Everybody was crowding round the man who held the rook, and he could not get near. A tall policeman stood in front of him. Jan pulled his arm, and when he turned, handed him the sweetmeat, and said in his soft, foreign English:  \"For the bird, sir.\"  \"Thank you my dear,\" said the policeman.  He had not understood what Jan said, and in an abstracted way, with his eyes still fixed on the rook, he bit the pink sweetmeat in two, and swallowed half of it at a mouthful. Fortunately Jan did not see this, for the policeman's back was turned to him; but observing that the man made no attempt to go forward, he pulled his sleeve for the second time, and again said:  \"For the bird, I said, sir.\"  Illustration: WILHELM  This time the policeman heard, and taking one step forward, he held the remaining half of the sweetmeat out to the rook, who, having by this time grown used to being fed, took the offered dainty greedily. Jan saw the last pink crumb vanish into the long beak, but he felt no regret. His heart had been touched by the suffering of the poor bird, and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48747"],["title","Who Ate the Pink Sweetmeat? And Other Christmas Stories (#2)"],["body","glad to give what he could to make it forget those painful days in the tree.  So that was the end of the pink sweetmeat, or not quite the end. The kind old gentleman to whom Jan had spoken, had noticed the little transaction with the policeman. He was shrewd as well as kind.  He guessed by Jan's clothes that he was a working-man's son, to whom sweets were not an everyday affair, and the generous act pleased him. So he put his hand into _his_ pocket, pulled out a half-crown, and watching his opportunity, dropped it into Jan's pocket, quite empty now that the sweetmeat was gone. Then, with a little chuckle, he walked away, and Jan had no suspicion of what had been done to him.  Gradually the crowd dispersed, Jan among the rest walking briskly, for he wanted to get home and tell his mother the story. It was not till after supper that he discovered the half-crown, and then it seemed to him like a sort of dream, as if fairies had been at work, and turned the pink sweetmeat into a bit of silver.  That night the three pairs of stockings had another chance for conversation. The blue ones and the green ones lay close together on the floor of the room where Jan slept with his brother, and the white ones which Greta had carelessly dropped as she jumped into bed, were near enough the half-opened door to talk across the sill.  \"It has been an exciting day,\" said the White Pair. \"My girl got a Keble's _Christian Year_ at her school. It was the second-best prize. It is a good thing to belong to respectable people who take prizes. Only one thing was painful to me, she wriggled her toes so with pleasure that I feel as if I were coming to an end in one of my points.\"  \"You probably are,\" remarked the Big Gray. \"Yes, now that I examine, I can see the place. One stitch has parted already, and there is quite a thin spot. You know I always predicted that you would be in the rag-bag before you knew it.\"  \"Oh, don't say such dreadful things,\" pleaded the Little Blues. \"Mrs. Wendte will mend her, I am sure, and make her last. What did your girl do with her sweetmeat?\"  \"Ate it up directly, of course. What else should one do with a sweetmeat?\" snapped the White Pair crossly. \"Oh, dear! my toe feels dreadfully ever since you said that; quite neuralgic!\"  \"My boy was not so foolish as to eat his sweetmeat,\" said the Big Gray stockings. \"Only girls act in that way, without regard to anything but their greedy appetites. He traded his with another boy, and he got a pocket-knife for it, three screws, and a harmonica. There!\"  \"Was the knife new?\" asked the Blue.  \"Could the harmonica play any music?\" demanded the White.  \"No; the harmonica is out of order inside somehow, but perhaps my boy can mend it. And the knife isn't new--quite old, in fact--and its blade is broken at the end; still it's a knife, and Wilhelm thinks he can trade it off for something else. And now for your adventures. What did _your_ boy do with his sweetmeat, Little Blues? Did he eat it, or trade it?\"  \"It is eaten,\" replied the Blue Stockings cautiously.  \"Eaten! Then of course he ate it. Why don't you speak out? If he ate it, say so. If he didn't, who did?\"  \"Well, nobody ate the whole of it, and my boy didn't eat any. It was divided between two persons--or rather, between one person and--and--a thing that is not a person.\"  \"Bless me! What are you talking about? I never heard anything so absurd in my life. Persons, and things that are not persons,\" said the White Pair, \"what do you mean?\"  \"Yes; what _do_ you mean? What is the use of beating about the bush in this way?\" remonstrated the Big Gray Pair. \"Who did eat the sweetmeat? Say plainly.\"  \"Half of it was eaten by a policeman, and the other half by a rook,\" replied the Little Blues, in a meek voice.  \"Ho, ho!\" roared the Gray Stockings, while the White Pair joined in with a shrill giggle. \"That beats all! Half by a policeman, and half by a rook! A fine way to dispose of a Christmas sweetmeat! Your boy must be a fool, Little Blues.\"  \"Not a fool at all,\" said the Blue Pair indignantly. \"Now just listen to me. Your girl ate hers up at once, and forgot it. Your boy traded his away; and what has he got? A broken knife, and a harmonica that can't play music. I don't call those worth having. My boy enjoyed his sweetmeat all day. He had more pleasure in giving it away than if he had eaten it ten times over! Beside he got half a crown for it. An old gentleman slipped it into his pocket because he was pleased with his kind heart. I saw him do it.\"  \"Half a crown!\" ejaculated the White Pair, with amazement.  \"That _is_ something like,\" admitted the Big Gray Stockings. \"Your boy did the best of the three, I admit.\"  The Little Blues said no more.  Presently the others fell asleep, but she lay and watched Jan as he rested peacefully beside his brother, with his wonderful treasure--the silver coin--clasped tight in his hand. He smiled in his sleep as though his dreams were pleasant.  \"Even if he had no half-crown, still he would have done the best,\" she whispered to herself at last.  Then the clock struck twelve, and the day after Christmas was begun.     THE WHIZZER.   That was a cold evening. The snow was just as dry as flour, and had been beat down till the road looked slick as a ribbon far up and far down, and squeaked every step. I pulled Mrar on our sled. All the boys went home by the crick to skate, but I was 'fraid Mrar would get cold, she's such a little thing. I like to play with the girls if the boys do laugh, for some of the big ones might push Mrar down and hurt her. She misses her mother so I babies her more than I used to.  We's almost out of sight of the schoolhouse, and just where the road elbows by the Widow Briggs's place, when something passed us like whiz! I'd been pulling along with the sled rope over my arm, and my hands in my pockets, and didn't hear a team or anything, but it made me shy off the side of the road, and pretty near upset Mrar. School lets out at four o'clock, and dusk comes soon after that, but it was woolly gray yet, so you could see plain except in the fence corners, and the thing that passed us was a man riding on nothing but one big wheel.  \"O, see there!\" says Mrar, scared as could be. I felt glad on her account we's close to Widow Briggs's place. It would be easy to hustle her over Briggs's fence; but the thing run so still and fast it might take fences as well as a straight road.  The man turned round after he passed us, and came rearing back, away up on that wheel, and I stood as close before the sled as I could. He sat high up in the air, and wiggled his feet on each side of the wheel, and I never saw a camel or elephant, or any kind of wild thing at a show that made me feel so funny. But just when I thought he's going to cut through us, he turned short, and stopped. He had on an overcoat to his ears, and a fur cap down to his nose, and hairy gloves on, and a little satchel strapped over his shoulder, and I saw there was a real small wheel behind the big one that balanced him up. He wasn't sitting on the tire neither, but on a saddle place, and the big wheel had lots of silver spokes crossing back and forward.  \"Whose children are you?\" says the man.  \"Nobody's,\" says I.  \"But who owns and switches you?\" says he.  \"The schoolmaster switches me,\" says I; \"but we ain't owned since mother died.\"  Mrar begun to cry.  \"We live at uncle Mozy's,\" says she. \"They don't want to give us away.\"  The man laughed, and says: \"Are you right sure?\" But I hated to have her scared, so I told her the wheel couldn't hurt her, nor him neither.  \"I've seen the cars many a time,\" I says, \"and I've seen balloons, and read in the paper about things that went on three wheels, but this\"--  \"It's a bicycle,\" says he. \"I'm a wheel-man.\"  \"That's what I thought,\" says I.  Then he wanted to know our names.  \"Mine's Steele Pedicord,\" I says, \"and this is my little sister Mrar.\"  His eyes looked sharp at us and he says:  \"Your mother died about six weeks ago?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" says I.  \"To-morrow won't be a very nice Christmas for you,\" says he.  \"No, sir,\" says I, digging my heel in the snow, for he had no business to talk that way, and make Mrar feel bad, when I had a little wagon all whittled out in my pocket to give her, and she cried most every night, anyhow, until aunt Ibby threatened to switch her if she waked the family any more. I slept with the boys, but when I heard Mrar sniffling in the big bed, a good many nights I slipped out and sat by her and whispered stories to take her attention as long as my jaws worked limber; but when they chattered too much with the cold, I'd lay down on the cover, with my arm across her till she went to sleep. I like Mrar.  \"They said we might go up to cousin Andy Sanders's to stay over,\" says I. \"We don't have to be at uncle Moze's a Christmas.\"  \"That's some consolation, is it?\" says he.  I was not going to let him know what the relations did, but I never liked relations outside of our place. At aunt Ibby and uncle Moze's the children fight like cats. And they always act poor at Christmas, and make fun of hanging your stocking or setting your plate; for you'd only get ashes or corn-cobs. Aunt Ibby keeps her sleeves rolled up so she can slap real handy, and uncle Moze has yellow streaks in his eyes, and he shivers over the stove, and keeps everybody else back. At cousin Andy Sanders' they have no children, and don't want them. You durse hardly come in out of the snow, and all the best things on the table will make you sick. If there is a piece in the paper that is hard to read, and ugly as it can be, they will make you sit still and read it; and if you get done too quick, they will say you skipped, and you have to read it out loud while they find fault. I knew cousin Andy Sanders never had any candy or taffy for Christmas, but Mrar and me could be peaceable there, for they don't push her around so bad.  \"Well, hand me your rope,\" says the man, \"and I'll give you a ride.\""]]]
