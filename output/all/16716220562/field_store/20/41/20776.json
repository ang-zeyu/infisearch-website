Why, Pip, it's beautifully simple!\"  Pip still looked uncomfortable.  \"I don't like it, Fizz,\" he said again; \"he'll be in a fearful wax.\"  Judy gave him one exasperated look.  \"Go and see if that's the Bondi tram coming,\" she said; and glad of a moment's respite, he went down the path again to the pavement and looked down the hill.  When he turned round again she had gone.  He stuck his hands in his pockets and walked up and down the path a few times.  \"Fizz'll get us hanged yet,\" he muttered, looking darkly at the door in the wall through which she had disappeared. He pushed his hat to the back of hiss head and stared gloomily at his boots, wondering what would be the consequences of this new mischief.  There was a light footfall beside him.  \"Come on,\" said Judy, pulling his sleeve; \"it's done now, come on, let's go and have our fun; have you got the money safe?\"  It was two o'clock as they passed out of the gate and turned their faces up, the hill to the tram stopping-place.  And it was half-past four when they jumped out of a town-bound tram and entered the gates again to pick up their charge.  Such an afternoon as they had had!  Once inside the Aquarium, even Pip had put his conscience qualms on one side, and bent all his energies to enjoying himself thoroughly.  And Judy was like a little mad thing.  She spent a shilling of her money on the switchback railway, pronouncing the swift, bewildering motion \"heavenly.\"  The first journey made Pip feel sick, so he eschewed a repetition of it, and watched Judy go off from time to time, waving gaily from the perilous little car, almost with his heart in his mouth.  Then they hired a pair of roller skates each, and bruised themselves black and blue with heavy falls on the asphalt.  After that they had a ride on the merry-go-round, but Judy found it tame after the switchback, and refused to squander a second threepence upon it, contenting herself with watching Pip fly round, and madly running by his side, to keep up as long as she could.  They finished the afternoon with a prolonged inspection of the fish-tanks, a light repast of jam tarts of questionable freshness, and twopennyworth of peanuts.  And, as I said, it was half-past four as they hastened up the path again to the top gate of the Barracks.  \"I hope he's been good,\" Judy said, as she turned the handle. \"Yes, you come, too, Pip\"--for that young gentleman hung back one agonized second.  \"Twenty kicks or blows divided by two only make ten, you see.\"  They went up the long stone veranda and stopped at one door.  There was a little knot of young officers laughing and talking close by.  \"Take my word, 'twas as good as a play to see Wooly grabbing his youngster, and stuffing it into a cab, and getting in himself, all with a look of ponderous injured dignity,\" one said, and laughed at the recollection.  Another blew away a cloud of cigar smoke.  \"It was a jolly little beggar,\" he said.  \"It doubled its fists and landed His High Mightiness one in the eye; and then its shoe dropped off, and we all rushed to pick it up, and it was muddy and generally dilapidated, and old Wooly went red slowly up to his ear-tips as he tried to put it on.\"  A little figure stepped into the middle of the group--a little figure with an impossibly short and shabby ulster, thin black-stockinged legs, and a big hat crushed over a tangle of curls.  \"It is my father you are speaking of,\" she said, her head very high, her tone haughty, \"and I cannot tell where your amusement is. Is my father here, or did I hear you say he had gone away?\"  Two of the men looked foolish, the third took off his cap.  \"I am sorry you should have overheard us, Miss Woolcot,\" he said pleasantly.  \"Still, there is no irreparable harm done, is there?  Yes, your father has gone away in a cab.  He couldn't imagine how the little boy came on his bed, and, as he couldn't keep him here very well, I suppose he has taken him home.\"  Something like a look of shame came into Judy's bright eyes,  \"I am afraid I must have put my father to some inconvenience,\" she said quietly.  \"It was I who left the Gen--my brother here, because I didn't know what to do with him for an hour or two. But I quite meant to take him home myself.  Has he been gone long?\"  \"About half an hour,\" the officer said, and tried not to look amused at the little girl's old-fashioned manner.  \"Ah, thank you.  Perhaps we can catch him up.  Come on, Pip,\" and, nodding in a grave, distant manner, she turned away, and went down the veranda and through the gate with her brother.  \"A nice hole we're in,\" he said.  Judy nodded.  \"It's about the very awfullest thing we've ever done in our lives. Fancy the governor carting that child all the way from here!  Oh, lor'!\"  Judy nodded again.  \"Can't you speak?\" he said irritably.  \"You've got us into this--I didn't want to do it; but I'll stand by you, of course.  Only you'll have to think of something quick.\"  Judy bit three finger-tips off her right-hand glove, and looked melancholy.  \"There's absolutely nothing to do, Pip,\" she said slowly.  \"I didn't think it would turn out like this.  I suppose we'd better just go straight back and hand ourselves over for punishment. He'll be too angry to hear any sort of an excuse, so we'd better just grin and hear whatever he does to us.  I'm really sorry, too, that I made a laughing-stock of him up there.\"  Pip was explosive.  He called her a little ass and a gowk and a stupid idiot for doing such a thing, and she did not reproach him or answer back once.  They caught a tram and went into Sydney, and afterwards to the boat.  They ensconced themselves in a corner at the far end, and discussed the state of affairs with much seriousness.  Then Pip got up and, strolled about a little to relieve his feelings, coming back in a second with a white, scared face.  \"He's on the boat,\" he said, in a horrified whisper.  \"Where-where--where? what--what--what?\" Judy cried, unintentionally mimicking a long-buried monarch.  \"In the cabin, looking as glum as a boiled wallaby, and hanging on to the poor little General as if he thinks he'll fly away.\"  Judy looked a little frightened for the first time.  \"Can't we hide?  Don't let him see us.  It wouldn't be any good offering to take the General now.  We're in for it now, Pip--there'll be no quarter.\"  Pip groaned; then Judy stood up.  \"Let's creep down as far as the engine,\" she said, \"and see if he does look very bad.\"  They made their way cautiously along the deck, and took up a position where they could see without being seen.  The dear little General was sitting on the seat next to his stern father, who had a firm hold of the back of his woolly-pelisse.  He was sucking his little dirty hand, and casting occasional longing glances at his tan shoe, which he knew was delicious to bite. Once or twice he had pulled it off and conveyed it to his mouth, but his father intercepted it, and angrily buttoned it on again in its rightful place.  He wanted, too, to slither off the horrid seat, and crawl all over the deck, and explore the ground under the seats, and see where the puffing noise came from; but there was that iron grasp on his coat that no amount of wriggling would move.  No wonder the poor child looked unhappy!  At last the boat stopped at a wharf not far from Misrule, and the Captain alighted, carrying his small dirty son gingerly in his arms.  He walked slowly up the red road along which the dogcart had sped so blithesomely some six or seven hours ago, and Judy and Pip followed at a respectful--a very respectful--distance. At the gate he saw them, and gave a large, angry beckon for them to come up.  Judy went very white, but obeyed instantly, and Pip, pulling himself together, brought up the rear.  Afterwards Judy only had a very indistinct remembrance of what happened during the next half-hour.  She knew there was a stormy scene, in which Esther and the whole family came in for an immense amount of vituperation.  Then Pip received a thrashing, in spite of Judy's persistent avowal that it was all her fault, and Pip hadn't done anything.  She remembered wondering whether she would be treated as summarily as Pip, so angry was her father's face as he pushed the boy aside and stood looking at her, riding whip in hand.  But he flung it, down and laid a heavy hand on her shrinking shoulder.  \"Next Monday,\" he said slowly--\"next Monday morning you will go to boarding school.  Esther, kindly see Helen's clothes are ready for boarding school--next Monday morning.\"     CHAPTER V  \"Next Monday Morning\"   There was a trunk standing in the hall, and a large, much-travelled portmanteau, and there were labels on them that said: \"Miss Helen Woolcot, The Misses Burton, Mount Victoria.\"  In the nursery breakfast was proceeding spasmodically.  Meg's blue eyes were all red and swollen with crying, and she was still sniffing audibly as she poured out the coffee.  Pip had his hands in his pockets and stood on the hearthrug, looking gloomily at a certain plate, and refusing breakfast altogether; the General was crashing his own mug and plate joyously together; and Bunty was eating bread and butter in stolid silence.  Judy, white-faced and dry-eyed, was sitting at the table, and Nell and Baby were clinging to either arm.  All the three days between that black Thursday and this doleful morning she had been obstinately uncaring.  Her spirits had never seemed higher, her eyes brighter, her tongue sharper, than during that interval of days; and she had pretended to everyone, and her father, that she especially thought boarding school must be great fun, and that she should enjoy it immensely.  But this morning she had collapsed altogether.  All the time before, her hot childish heart had been telling her that her father could not really be so cruel, that he did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],["title","Seven Little Australians (#6)"],["body","mean to send her away among strangers, away from dear, muddled old Misrule and all her sisters and brothers; he was only saying it to frighten her, she kept saying to herself, and she would show him she was not a chickenhearted baby.  But on Sunday night, when she saw a trunk carried downstairs and filled with her things and labelled with her name, a cold hand seemed to close about her heart.  Still, she said to herself, he was doing all this to make it seem more real.  But now it was morning, and she could disbelieve it no longer. Esther had come to her bedside and kissed her sorrowfully, her beautiful face troubled and tender.  She had begged as she had never done before for a remission of poor Judy's sentence, but the Captain was adamant.  It was she and she only who was always ringleader in everything; the others would behave when she was not there to incite them to mischief and go she should.  Besides, he said, it would be the making of her.  It was an excellent school he had chosen for her; the ladies who kept it were kind, but very firm, and Judy was being ruined for want of a firm hand.  Which, indeed, was in a measure true.  Judy sat bolt upright in bed at the sight of Esther's sorrowful face.  \"It's no good, dear; there's no way out of it,\" she said gently. \"But you'll go like a brave girl, won't you, Ju-Ju?  You always were the sort to die game, as Pip says.\"  Judy gulped down a great lump in her throat, and her poor little face grew white and drawn.  \"It's all right, Essie.  There, you go on down to breakfast,\" she said, in a voice that, only shook a little; \"and please leave the General, Esther; I'll bring him down with me.\"  Esther deposited her little fat son on the pillow, and with one loving backward glance went out of the door.  And Judy pulled the little lad down into her arms, and covered the bedclothes right over both their heads, and held him in a fierce, almost desperate clasp for a minute or two, and buried her face in his soft, dimpled neck, and kissed it till her lips ached.  He fought manfully against these troublesome proceedings, and at last objected, with an angry scream, to being suffocated.  So she flung back the clothes and got out of bed, leaving him to burrow about among the pillows, and pull feathers out of a hole in one of them.  She dressed in a quick nervous fashion, did her hair with more care than usual, and then picked up the General and took him along the passage into the nursery.  All the others were here, and, with Esther, were evidently discussing her.  The three girls looked tearful and protesting; Pip had just been brought to book for speaking disrespectfully of his father, and was looking sullen; and Bunty, not knowing what else to do at such a crisis, had fallen to catching flies, and was viciously taking off their wings.  It was a wretched meal: The bell sounded for the downstairs breakfast, and Esther had to go.  Everyone offered Judy everything on the table, and spoke gently and politely to her.  She seemed to be apart from them, a person not to be lightly treated in the dignity of this great trouble.  Her dress, too, was quite new--a neat blue serge fresh from the dressmaker's hands; her boots were blacked and bright, her stockings guiltless of ventilatory chasms.  All this helped to make her a Judy quite different from the harum-scarum one of a few days back, who used to come to breakfast looking as if her clothes had been pitchforked upon her.  Baby addressed herself to her porridge for one minute, but the next her feelings overcame her, and, with a little wail, she rushed round the table to Judy, and hung on her arm sobbing.  This destroyed the balance of the whole company.  Nell got the other arm and swayed to and fro in an excess of misery. Meg's tears rained down into her teacup; Pip dug his heel in the hearthrug, and wondered what was the matter with his eyes; and even Bunty's appetite for bread and butter diminished.  Judy sat there silent; she had pushed back her unused plate, and sat regarding it with an expression of utter despair on her young face.  She looked like a miniature tragedy queen going to immediate execution.  Presently Bunty got off his chair, covered up his coffee with his saucer to keep the flies out, and solemnly left the room.  In a minute he returned with a pickle bottle, containing an enormous green frog.  \"You can have it to keep for your very own, Judy,\" he said, in a tone of almost reckless sadness.  \"It'll, keep you amused, perhaps, at school.\"  Self-sacrifice could go no further, for this frog was the darling of Bunty's heart.  This stimulated the others; everyone fetched some offering to lay at Judy's shrine for a keepsake.  Meg brought a bracelet, plaited out of the hair of a defunct pet pony.  Pip gave his three-bladed pocketknife.  Nell a pot of musk that she had watered and cherished for a year, Baby had a broken-nosed doll, that was the Benjamin of her large family.  \"Put them in the trunk, Meg--there's room on top, I think,\" Judy said in a choking voice, and deeply touched by these gifts.  \"Oh! and, Bunty, dear! put a cork over the f--f--frog, will you? it might get lost, poor thing! in that b--b--big box.\"  \"All right,\" said Bunty, \"You'll take c--c--care of it, w--won't you, Judy?  Oh dear, oh--h--h!--boo-hoo!\"  Then Esther came in, still troubled-looking.  \"The dogcart is round,\" she said.  \"Are you ready, Ju, dearest?  Dear little Judy! be brave, little old woman.\"  But Judy was white as death, and utterly limp.  She suffered Esther to put her hat on, to help her into her new jacket, to put her gloves into her hand.  She submitted to being kissed by the whole family, to be half carried downstairs by Esther, to be kissed again by the girls, then by the two good-natured domestics, who, in spite of her peccadilloes, had a warm place in their hearts for her.  Esther and Pip lifted her into the dogcart; and she sat in a little, huddled-up way, looking down at the group on the veranda with eyes that were absolutely tragic in their utter despair.  Her father came out, buttoning his overcoat, and saw the look.  \"What foolishness is this?\" he said irascibly--\"Esther-great heavens! are you making a goose of yourself, too?\"--there were great tears glistening in his wife's beautiful eyes.  \"Upon my soul, one would think I was going to take the child to be hanged, or at least was going to leave her in a penitentiary.\"  A great dry sob broke from Judy's white lips.  \"If you'll let me stay, Father, I'll never do another thing to vex you; and you can thrash me instead, ever so hard.\"  It was her last effort, her final hope, and she bit her poor quivering lip till it bled while she waited for his answer.  \"Let her stay--oh! do letter stay, we'll be good always,\" came in a chorus from the veranda.  And, \"Let her stay, John, PLEASE!\" Esther called in a tone as entreating as any of the children.  But the Captain sprang into the dogcart and seized the reins from Pat in a burst of anger.  \"I think you're all demented!\" he cried.  \"She's going to a thoroughly good home, I've paid a quarter in advance already, and I can assure you good people I'm not going to waste it.\"  He gave the horse a smart touch with the whip, and in a minute the dogcart had flashed out of the gate, and the small, unhappy face was lost to sight.     CHAPTER VI  The Sweetness of Sweet Sixteen    \"She is not yet so old   But she may learn: happier than this,   She is not bred so dull but she can learn.\"   Meg's hair had always been pretty, but during the last two months she had cut herself a fringe, and begun to torture it up in curl papers every night.  And in her private drawer she kept a jam tin filled with oatmeal, that she used in the water every time she washed, having read it was a great complexion beautifier.  And nightly she rubbed vaseline on her hands and slept in old kid gloves.  And her spare money went in the purchase of \"Freckle Lotion,\" to remove that slight powdering of warm brown sun-kisses that somehow lent a certain character to her face.  All these things were the outcome of being sixteen, and having found a friend of seventeen.  Aldith MacCarthy learnt French from the same teacher that Meg was going to twice a week, and after an exchange of chocolates, hair-ribbons, and family confidences a friendship sprang up.  Aldith had three grown-up sisters, whom she aped in everything, and was considerably wiser in the world than simple-minded, romantic Meg.  She lent Meg novels, \"Family Herald Supplements\", \"Young Ladies' Journals\", and such publications, and the young girl took to them with avidity, surprised at the new world into which they took her; for Charlotte Yonge and Louisa Alcott and Miss Wetherall had hitherto formed her simple and wholesome fare.  Meg began to dream rose-coloured dreams of the time when her fair, shining hair should be gathered up into \"a simple knot at the back of her head\" or \"brushed into a regal coronet,\" these being the styles in which the heroines in the novels invariably dressed their hair.  A pigtail done in three was very unromantic.  That was why, as a sort of compromise, she cut herself a fringe and began to frizz out the end of her plait.  Her father stared at her, and said she looked like a shop-girl, when first he noticed it, and Esther told her she was a stupid child; but the looking-glass and Aldith reassured her.  The next thing was surreptitiously to lengthen her dresses, which were at the short-long stage.  In the privacy of her own bedroom she took the skirts of two or three of her frocks off the band, inserted a piece of lining for lengthening purposes, and then added a frill to the waists of her bodices to hide the join.  This dropped the skirts a good two inches, and made her look quite a tall, slim figure, as she was well aware.  And none of these things were very harmful.  But Aldith gradually grew dissatisfied with her waist.  \"You're at least twenty-three, Marguerite,\" she said once, quite in "]]]
