So bein' driv out of that argument, he sez, forgittin' his own eleven proofs aginst his story bein' true:  \"Polygamy is done away with anyway; the United States have abolished it in Utah.\"  And I sez: \"Well, I should be glad to think that wuz so, for one husband and one wife is as much as the Lord in his mercy ort to ask one human creeter to tend to and put up with. Not but what marriage is a beautiful institution and full of happiness if Love props it up and gilds it with its blessed ray. But one is enough,\" sez I firmly, \"and enough is as good as a feast.\"  Miss Meechim sot silently by durin' this eloquent discussion--what she felt, she that abhorred the institution of marriage anyway--what she felt to look on and see folks so much married as these wuz, will forever remain a secret, but her looks wuz queer, very, and her nose fairly sought the heavens, it wuz held so high. A few of the wives brought in some refreshments to refresh us, and a few more waited on us and the small husband of their eleven hearts, and almost immegiately we tore ourselves away, takin' in ourn as we left, the hand of the husband and the eleven right hands of the wife.  That evenin' I wuz told I wuz wanted in the parlor, and as I entered quite a good lookin' Mormon man got up and advanced and broke out to once askin' my help. He said he'd read in the paper that I wuz there to that tarven, and knowin' I stood so high with the public he had ventered to ask my help. He had political yearnin's and wanted to set in the Senate, but as I stood firm as iron again that idee his linement grew almost frenzied, and sez he:  \"Do help me, do use your influence with your President. He's afraid of race suicide; tell him I'm the father of forty-seven children--will not that touch his heart?\"  \"Not a mite!\" sez I, \"his heart is as true as steel to his one wife and six children. It is a good manly heart that can't be led off by any such brazen statements.\"  His linement looked lurid and half demented as he sez, \"Mebby some high church dignitaries would help me. Or no,\" sez he, \"go to the head of it all, go to the Liquor Power--that's the place to go to, that rules Church and State, that makes the laws. Oh, do go to the Liquor Power, and git it to let me set. I'll pay their usual price for makin' personal laws in a man's favor.\"  The cold glare in my gray eye froze the words on his lip. \"You ask me to go to the Liquor Power for help! Do you know who you're speakin' to?\"  \"Yes,\" sez he feebly, \"I'm speakin' to Josiah Allen's wife, and I want to set.\"  His axent wuz heartbroken and I fancied that there wuz a little tone of repentance in it. Could I influence him for the right? Could I frighten him into the right path? I felt I must try, and I sez in a low, deep voice:  \"I'll help you to set if you'll set where I want you to.\"  \"Oh, tell me! tell me,\" sez he, \"where you want me to set.\"  \"Not in the high halls where justice is administered, not up there with the pictures of your numerous wives on your heart to make laws condemnin' a man who has only one extra wife to prison for twenty years, which same law would condemn you to prison for 'most a century. That wouldn't be reasonable. Presidents and senators are sot up there in Washington D. C. as examplers for the young to foller and stimulate 'em to go and do likewise. Such a example as yourn would stimulate 'em too much in matrimonial directions and land 'em in prison.\"  He muttered sunthin' about lots of public men havin' other wives in secret.  \"In secret?\" sez I. \"Well, mebby so, but it has to be in secret, hid away, wropped in disgrace, and if the law discovers it they are punished. That's a very different thing from makin' such a life respectable, coverin' 'em under the mantilly of the law, embroidered too with public honors.\"  He turned away despairin'ly and murmured mekanically the old heart-broken wail, \"I want to set.\"  And I sez reasonably, \"There is no objection to your settin' down, and if I had my way you would set right by them who have done only half or a quarter what you have and in the place the laws have made for them and you.\"  He turned quick as a wink, \"Then you won't help me?\"  \"Yes,\" sez I, \"I'll help all I can to put you right in with the others that have done jest what you have--openly set our laws at defiance. But if I know myself I won't help a tiger cat to hold a canary bird or a wolf to guard a sheep pen. I won't help a felon up on the seat of justice to make laws for innocent men.\"  \"Innocent men!\" And agin he sez, \"Ha! ha!\"  And agin I didn't care what he said. And I got up and sez, \"You may as well leave the presence.\" And as he turned I sez in conclusion, thinkin' mebby I'd been too hash, \"I dare say you have intellect and may be a good man so fur as I know only in this one iniquity and open defiance of our laws, and I advise you to turn right round in your tracks and git ready to set down on high, for you'll find it a much worse thing to prance round through all eternity without settin' than it is to not set here.\"  He jest marched out of the door and didn't say good bye or good day or anything. But I didn't care. I knowed the minute his card wuz handed to me jest how many wives he had and how he wuz doin' all he could to uphold what he called his religion, but I did hope I'd done him some good but felt dubersome about it. But knowin' I'd clung to Duty's apron strings I felt like leavin' the event. And when Miss Meechim come in I wuz settin' calm and serene in a big chair windin' some clouded blue and white yarn, Aronette holdin' the skein. I'd brung along a lot of woollen yarn to knit Josiah some socks on the way, to make me feel more homelike.  And the next day we proceeded on to California.     CHAPTER V   Miss Meechim and Dorothy looked brighter and happier as every revolution of the wheels brought us nearer their old home, and they talked about Robert Strong and other old friends I never see.      \"Be it ever so humbly,     There is no place like hum.\"  My heart sung them words and carried two parts, one sulferino and one bear tone. The high part caused by my lofty emotions and sweet recollections of home, that hallowed spot; the minor chords caused by feelin's I have so often recapitulated. Tommy, as the day wore on, went to sleep, and I covered him tenderly on the seat with my little shoulder shawl, and sot there alone; alone, as the cars bore us onward, sometimes through broad green fields of alfalfa, anon over a bridge half a mile long, from whence you could look down and see the flowing stream beneath like a little skein of silver yarn glistening in the sun fur below, agin forests and valleys and farms and homesteads, and anon in an opening through a valley, high bluffs, beautifully colored, could be seen towering up over blue waters, up, up as if they wuz bent on touching the fleecy clouds overhead. And then a green sheltered valley, and then a high range of mountains seen fur off as if overlookin' things to see that all wuz well, anon a big city, then a village, then the green country agin, and so the pictures passed before me as I sot there.  I had put on a pair of new cuffs and a collar, made for me and hemstitched by Waitstill Webb, and gin to me by her, though I wanted to pay her. Sweet little creeter! how good she wuz to me and to everybody, and I thought of her sad history, and hoped that brighter days wuz ahead on her. I d'no as I've told the reader much about her history, and mebby I might as well whilst we are rushin' on so fast, and Tommy is asleep.  Alan Thorne, the young man she wuz engaged to, wuz brung up by a uncle who had a family of his own to love and tend to, but he did his duty by Alan, gin him a good education and a comfortable, if not affectionate, home in his family. But it wuz a big family all bound up in each other, and Alan had seemed like one who looks on through a winder at the banquet of Life and Love, kinder hungry and lonesome till he met Waitstill Webb. Then their two hearts and souls rushed together like two streams of water down an inclined plane. They literally seemed to be two bodies with one heart, one soul, one desire, one aspiration. He had always been industrious, honest and hard workin'. Now he had sunthin' to work for; and for the three years after he met Waitstill he worked like a giant. He wuz earning a home for his wife, his idol; how happy he wuz in his efforts, his work, and how happy she wuz to see it, and to work herself in her quiet way for the future.  He had bought a home about a mile out of the city, where he was employed, and had got it all payed for. It wuz a beautiful little cottage with a few acres of land round it, and he had got his garden all laid out and a orchard of fruit trees of all kinds, and trees and flowering shrubs and vines around the pretty cottage. There wuz a little pasture where he wuz to keep his cow and a horse, that she could take him with to his work mornings and drive round where she wanted to, and there wuz a meadow lot with a little rivulet running through it, and they had already planned a rustic bridge over the dancing stream, and a trout pond, and she had set out on its borders some water lilies, pink and white, and Showy Ladies and other wild flowers, and she jest doted on her posy garden and strawberry beds, and they'd bought two or three hives of bees in pretty boxes and took them out there; they had rented the place to a old couple till they wanted it themselves. And every holiday and Sunday they walked out to their own place, and the sun did not shine any brighter on their little home than the sun of hope and happiness did in their hearts as they pictured their life there in that cozy nest.  And Alan Thorne, after he loved Waitstill, not only tried to win outward success for her sake; he tried to weed out all the weaknesses of his nater, to make himself more worthy of her.

Thus  he inherited a dark destiny--or did he?_   \"Call them what you like,\" said Tex Harrigan. \"Lost people or strayed, crackpots or warped geniuses--I know enough of them to fill an entire department of queer people. I've been a reporter long enough to have run into quite a few of them.\"  \"For example?\" I said, recognizing Harrigan's mellowness.  \"Take Thaddeus McIlvaine,\" said Harrigan.  \"I never heard of him.\"  \"I suppose not,\" said Harrigan. \"But I knew him. He was an eccentric old fellow who had a modest income--enough to keep up his hobbies, which were three: he played cards and chess at a tavern called Bixby's on North Clark Street; he was an amateur astronomer; and he had the fixed idea that there was life somewhere outside this planet and that it was possible to communicate with other beings--but unlike most others, he tried it constantly with the queer machinery he had rigged up.  \"Well, now, this old fellow had a trio of cronies with whom he played on occasion down at Bixby's. He had no one else to confide in. He kept them up with his progress among the stars and his communication with other life in the cosmos beyond our own, and they made a great joke out of it, from all I could gather. I suppose, because he had no one else to talk to, McIlvaine took it without complaint. Well, as I said, I never heard of him until one morning the city editor--it was old Bill Henderson then--called me in and said, 'Harrigan, we just got a lead on a fellow named Thaddeus McIlvaine who claims to have discovered a new star. Amateur astronomer up North Clark. Find him and get a story.' So I set out to track him down....\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was a great moment for Thaddeus McIlvaine. He sat down among his friends almost portentously, adjusted his spectacles, and peered over them in his usual manner, half way between a querulous oldster and a reproachful schoolmaster.  \"I've done it,\" he said quietly.  \"Aye, and what?\" asked Alexander testily.  \"I discovered a new star.\"  \"Oh,\" said Leopold flatly. \"A cinder in your eye.\"  \"It lies just off Arcturus,\" McIlvaine went on, \"and it would appear to be coming closer.\"  \"Give it my love,\" said Richardson with a wry smile. \"Have you named it yet? Or don't the discoverers of new stars name them any more? McIlvaine's Star--that's a good name for it. Hard a port of Arcturus, with special displays on windy nights.\"  McIlvaine only smiled. \"It's a dark star,\" he said presently. \"It doesn't have light.\" He spoke almost apologetically, as if somehow he had disappointed his friends. \"I'm going to try and communicate with it.\"  \"That's the ticket,\" said Alexander.  \"Cut for deal,\" said Leopold.  That was how the news about McIlvaine's Star was received by his cronies. Afterward, after McIlvaine had dutifully played several games of euchre, Richardson conceived the idea of telephoning the _Globe_ to announce McIlvaine's discovery.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The old fellow took himself seriously,\" Harrigan went on. \"And yet he was so damned mousy about it. I mean, you got the impression that he had been trying for so long that now he hardly believed in his star himself any longer. But there it was. He had a long, detailed story of its discovery, which was an accident, as those things usually are. They happen all the time, and his story sounded convincing enough. Just the same, you didn't feel that he really had anything. I took down notes, of course; that was routine. I got a picture of the old man, with never an idea we'd be using it.  \"To tell the truth, I carried my notes around with me for a day or so before it occurred to me that it wouldn't do any harm to put a call in to Yerkes Observatory up in Wisconsin. So I did, and they confirmed McIlvaine's Star. The _Globe_ had the story, did it up in fine style.  \"It was two weeks before we heard from McIlvaine again....\"         *       *       *       *       *  That night McIlvaine was more than usually diffident. He was not like a man bearing a message of considerable importance to himself. He slipped into Bixby's, got a glass of beer, and approached the table where his friends sat, almost with trepidation.  \"It's a nice evening for May,\" he said quietly.  Richardson grunted.  Leopold said, \"By the way, Mac, whatever became of that star of yours? The one the papers wrote up.\"  \"I think,\" said McIlvaine cautiously, \"I'm quite sure--I have got in touch with them. Only,\" his brow wrinkled and furrowed, \"I can't understand their language.\"  \"Ah,\" said Richardson with an edge to his voice, \"the thing for you to do is to tell them that's your star, and they'll have to speak English from now on, so you can understand them. Why, next thing we know, you'll be getting yourself a rocket or a space-ship and going over to that star to set yourself up as king or something.\"  \"King Thaddeus the First,\" said Alexander loftily. \"All you star-dwellers may kiss the royal foot.\"  \"That would be unsanitary, I think,\" said McIlvaine, frowning.  Poor McIlvaine! They made him the butt of their jests for over an hour before he took himself off to his quarters, where he sat himself down before his telescope and found his star once more, almost huge enough to blot out Arcturus, but not quite, since it was moving away from that amber star now.  McIlvaine's star was certainly much closer to the Earth than it had been.  He tried once again to contact it with his home-made radio, and once again he received a succession of strange, rhythmic noises which he could not doubt were speech of some kind or other--a rasping, grating speech, to be sure, utterly unlike the speech of McIlvaine's own kind. It rose and fell, became impatient, urgent, despairing--McIlvaine sensed all this and strove mightily to understand.  He sat there for perhaps two hours when he received the distant impression that someone was talking to him in his own language. But there was no longer any sound on the radio. He could not understand what had taken place, but in a few moments he received the clear conviction that the inhabitants of his star had managed to discover the basic elements of his language by the simple process of reading his mind, and were now prepared to talk with him.  What manner of creatures inhabited Earth? they wished to know.  McIlvaine told them. He visualized one of his own kind and tried to put him into words. It was difficult, since he could not rid himself of the conviction that his interlocutors might be utterly alien.  They had no conception of man and doubted man's existence on any other star. There were plant-people on Venus, ant-people on Andromeda, six-legged and four-armed beings which were equal parts mineral and vegetable on Betelguese--but nothing resembling man. \"You are evidently alone of your kind in the cosmos,\" said his interstellar correspondent.  \"And what about you?\" cried McIlvaine with unaccustomed heat.  Silence was his only answer, but presently he conceived a mental image which was remarkable for its vividness. But the image was of nothing he had ever seen before--of thousands upon thousands of miniature beings, utterly alien to man; they resembled amphibious insects, with thin, elongated heads, large eyes, and antennae set upon a scaled, four-legged body, with rudimentary beetle-like wings. Curiously, they seemed ageless; he could detect no difference among them--all appeared to be the same age.  \"We are not, but we rejuvenate regularly,\" said the creature with whom he corresponded in this strange manner.  Did they have names? McIlvaine wondered.  \"I am Guru,\" said the star's inhabitant. \"You are McIlvaine.\"  And the civilization of their star?  Instantly he saw in his mind's eye vast cities, which rose from beneath a surface which appeared to bear no vegetation recognizable to any human eye, in a terrain which seemed to be desert, of monolithic buildings, which were windowless and had openings only of sufficient size to permit the free passage of its dwarfed dwellers. Within the buildings was evidence of a great and old civilization....         *       *       *       *       *  \"You see, McIlvaine really believed all this. What an imagination the man had! Of course, the boys at Bixby's gave him a bad time; I don't know how he stood it, but he did. And he always came back. Richardson called the story in; he took a special delight in deviling McIlvaine, and I was sent out to see the old fellow again.  \"You couldn't doubt his sincerity. And yet he didn't sound touched.\"  \"But, of course, that part about the insect-like dwellers of the star comes straight out of Wells, doesn't it?\" I put in.  \"Wells and scores of others,\" agreed Harrigan. \"Wells was probably the first writer to suggest insectivorous inhabitants on Mars; his were considerably larger, though.\"  \"Go on.\"  \"Well, I talked with McIlvaine for quite a while. He told me all about their civilization and about his friend, Guru. You might have thought he was talking about a neighbor of his I had only to step outside to meet.  \"Later on, I dropped around at Bixby's and had a talk with the boys there. Richardson let me in on a secret. He had decided to rig up a connection to McIlvaine's machine and do a little talking to the old fellow, making him believe Guru was coming through in English. He meant to give McIlvaine a harder time than ever, and once he had him believing everything he planned to say, they would wait for him at Bixby's and let him make a fool of himself.  \"It didn't work out quite that way, however....\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"McIlvaine, can you hear me?\"  McIlvaine started with astonishment. His mental impression of Guru became confused; the voice speaking English came clear as a bell, "]]]
