Several instruments made by Gerbert are described in detail; he includes a fine celestial globe made of wood covered with horsehide and having the stars and lines painted in color, and an armillary sphere having sighting tubes similar to those always found on Chinese instruments but never on the Ptolemaic variety. Lastly, he cites \"the construction of a sphere, most suitable for recognizing the planets,\" but unfortunately it is not clear from the description whether or not the model planets were actually to be animated mechanically. The text runs:[27]    Within this oblique circle (the zodiac on the ecliptic of   the globe) he hung the circles of the wandering stars (the   planets) with marvellous ingenuity, whose orbits, heights   and even the distance from each other he demonstrated to   his pupils most effectually. Just how he accomplished this   it is unsuitable to enter into here because of its extent   lest we should appear to be wandering from our main theme.  Thus, although there is a hint of mechanical complexity, there is really no justification for such an assumption; the description might well imply only a zodiac band on which the orbits of the planets were painted. On the other hand it is not inconceivable that Gerbert could have learned something of Islamic and other extra-European traditions during his period of study with the Bishop of Barcelona--a traveling scholarship that seems to have had many repercussions on the whole field of European scholarship.  Once the floodgates of Arabic learning were opened, a stream of mechanized astronomical models poured into Europe. Astrolabes and equatoria rapidly became very popular, mainly through the reason for which they had been first devised, the avoidance of tedious written computation. Many medieval astrolabes have survived, and at least three medieval equatoria are known. Chaucer is well known for his treatise on the astrolabe; a manuscript in Cambridge, containing a companion treatise on the equatorium, has been tentatively suggested by the present author as also being the work of Chaucer and the only piece written in his own hand.  The geared astrolabe of al-Biruni is another type of protoclock to have been transmitted. A specimen in the Science Museum, London,[28] though unfortunately now incomplete, has a very sophistocated arrangement of gears for moving pointers to indicate the correct relative positions and movements of the sun and moon (see figs. 17 and 18). Like the earlier Muslim example it contains wheels with odd numbers of gear teeth (14, 27, 39); however, the teeth are no longer equilateral in shape, but approximate a more modern slightly rounded form. This example is French and appears to date from _ca._ 1300. Another Gothic astrolabe with a similar gear ring on the rete, said to date from _ca._ 1400 (it could well be much earlier) is now in the Billmeier collection (London).[29]  Turning from the mechanized astrolabe to the mechanized equatorium, we find the work of Richard of Wallingford (1292?-1336) of the greatest interest as providing an immediate precursor to that of de Dondi. He was the son of an ingenious blacksmith, making his way to Merton College, Oxford, then the most active and original school of astronomy in Europe, and winning later distinction as Abbot of St. Albans. A text by him, dated 1326-27, described in detail the construction of a great equatorium, more exact and much more elaborate than any that had gone before.[30] Nevertheless it is evidently a normal manually operated device like all the others. In addition to this instrument, Richard is said to have constructed _ca._ 1320, a fine planetary clock for his Abbey.[31] Bale, who seems to have seen it, regarded it as without rival in Europe, and the greatest curiosity of his time. Unfortunately, the issue was confused by Leland, who identified it as the Albion (_i.e._, all-by one), the name Richard gives to his manual equatorium. This clock was indeed so complex that Edward III censured the Abbot for spending so much money on it, but Richard replied that after his death nobody would be able to make such a thing again. He is said to have left a text describing the construction of this clock, but the absence of such a work has led many modern writers to support Leland's identification and suppose that the device was not a mechanical clock.  [Illustration: Figure 17.--FRENCH GEARED ASTROLABE OF TREFOIL GOTHIC DESIGN, _ca._ A.D. 1300. The gearing on the pointer is, from the center: (32)/14-45+27-39, the last meshing with a concave annular gear of 180 teeth around the rim of the rete of the astrolabe. A second pointer, geared to this so as to follow the Moon, seems to be lacking. (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum. London._)]  [Illustration: Figure 18.--GEAR TRAIN OF POINTER in figure 17. (_Photo courtesy of Science Museum, London._)]  A corrective for this view is to be had from a St. Albans manuscript (now at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge) that described the methods for setting out toothed wheels for an astronomical horologium designed to show the motions of the planets. Although the manuscript copy is to be dated _ca._ 1340, it clearly indicates that a geared planetary device was known in St. Albans at an early date, and it is reasonable to suppose that this was in fact the machine made by Richard of Wallingford. Unfortunately the text does not appear to give any relevant information about the presence of an escapement or any other regulatory device, nor does it mention the source of power.[32] Now a geared version of the Albion would appear to correspond very closely indeed to the dial-work which forms the greater part of the de Dondi clock, and for this reason we suggest now that the two clocks were very closely related in other ways too. This, circumstantial though it be, is evidence for thinking that the weight drive and some form of escapement were known to Richard of Wallingford, _ca._ 1320. It would narrow the gap between the clock and the protoclocks to less than half a century, perhaps a single generation, in the interval _ca._ 1285-1320. In this connection it may be of interest that Richard of Wallingford knew only the Toledo tables corpus, that of the Alfonsine school did not arrive in England until after his death.  There are, of course, many literary references to the water-clocks in medieval literature. In fact most of these are from quotations which have often been produced erroneously in the history of the mechanical clock, thereby providing many misleading starts for that history, as noted previously in the discussion of the horologium. There are however enough mentions to make it certain that water clocks of some sort were in use, especially for ecclesiastic purposes, from the end of the 12th century onwards. Thus, Jocelin of Brakelond tells of a fire in the Abbey Church of Bury St. Edmunds in the year 1198.[33] The relics would have been destroyed during the night, but just at the crucial moment the clock bell sounded for matins and the master of the vestry sounded the alarm. On this \"the young men amongst us ran to get water, some to the well and others to the clock\"--probably the sole occasion on which a clock served as a fire hydrant.  It seems probable that some of these water clocks could have been simple drip clepsydras, with perhaps a striking arrangement added. A most fortunate discovery by Drover has now brought to light a manuscript illumination that shows that these water clocks, at least by _ca,_ 1285, had become more complex and were rather similar in appearance to the Alfonsine mercury drum.[34] The illustration (fig. 19) is from a moralized Bible written in northern France, and accompanies the passage where King Hezekiah is given a sign by the Lord, the sun being moved back ten steps of the clock. The picture clearly shows the central water wheel and below it a dog's head spout gushing water into a bucket supported by chains, with a (weight?) cord running behind. Above the wheel is a carillon of bells, and to one side a rosette which might be a fly or a model sun. The wheel appears to have 15 compartments, each with a central hole (perhaps similar to that in the Alfonsine clock) and it is supported on a square axle by a bracket, the axle being wedged in the traditional fashion. The projections at the edge of the wheel might be gear teeth, but more likely they are used only for tripping the striking mechanism. If it were not for the running water spout it would be very close to the Alfonsine model; but with this evidence it seems impossible to arrive at a clear mechanical interpretation.  From the adjacent region there is another account of a striking water clock, the evidence being inscriptions on slates, discovered in Villers Abbey near Brussels;[35] these may be closely dated as 1267 or 1268 and provide the remains of a memorandum for the sacrist and his assistants in charge of the clock.    Always set the clock, however long you may delay on [the   letter \"A\"] afterwards you shall pour water from the   little pot (pottulo) that is there, into the reservoir   (cacabum) until it reaches the prescribed level, and you   must do the same when you set [the clock] after compline   so that you may sleep soundly.  A quite different sort of evidence is to be had from the writings of Robertus Anglicus in 1271 where one gets the impression that just at this time there was active interest in the attempt to make a weight-driven anaphoric clock and to regulate its motion by some unstated method so that it would keep time with the diurnal rotation of the heavens:[36]    Nor it is possible for any clock to follow the judgment of   astronomy with complete accuracy. Yet clockmakers   (artifices horologiorum) are trying to make a wheel   (circulum) which will make one complete revolution for   every one of the equinoctial circle, but they cannot quite   perfect their work. But "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30001"],["title","On the Origin of Clockwork, Perpetual Motion Devices, and the Compass (#7)"],["body","they could, it would be a   really accurate clock (horologium verax valde) and worth   more than an astrolabe or other astronomical instrument   for reckoning the hours, if one knew how to do this   according to the method aforesaid. The method of making   such a clock would be this, that a man make a disc   (circulum) of uniform weight in every part so far as could   possibly be done. Then a lead weight should be hung from   the axis of that wheel (axi ipsius rote) and this weight   would move that wheel so that it would complete one   revolution from sunrise to sunrise, minus as much time as   about one degree rises according to an approximately   correct estimate. For from sunrise to sunrise, the whole   equinoctial rises, and about one degree more, through   which degree the sun moves against the motion of the   firmament in the course of a natural day. Moreover, this   could be done more accurately if an astrolabe were   constructed with a network on which the entire equinoctial   circle was divided up.  [Illustration: Figure 19.--MANUSCRIPT ILLUMINATION OF A MEDIEVAL WATERCLOCK, showing a partitioned wheel, a weight drive, and a carillion for striking. From Drover (see footnote 34).]  The text then continues with technical astronomical details of the slight difference between the rate of rotation of the sun and of the fixed stars (because of the annual rotation of the sun amongst the stars) but it gives no indication of any regulatory device. Again it should be noted, this source comes from France; Robertus, though of English origin, apparently being then a lecturer either at the University of Paris or at that of Montpellier. The date of this passage, 1271, has been taken as a _terminus post quem_ for the invention of the mechanical clock. In the next section we shall describe the text of Peter Peregrinus, very close to this in place and date, which describes just such a machine, conflating it with accounts of an armillary sphere, perpetual motion, and the magnetic compass--so bringing all these threads together for the first time in Europe.  [Illustration: Figure 20.--ARRANGEMENT FOR TURNING A FIGURE OF AN ANGEL. It has been alleged that this drawing by Villard represents an escapement. After Lassus (see footnote 37).]  We have reserved to the last one section of evidence which may or may not be misleading, the famous notebook of Villard (Wilars) of Honnecourt, near Cambrai. The album, attributed to the period 1240-1251, contains many drawings with short annotations, three of which are of special interest to our investigations.[37] These comprise a steeplelike structure labeled \"cest li masons don orologe\" (this is the house of a clock), a device including a rope, wheel and axle (fig. 20), marked \"par chu fait om un angle tenir son doit ades vers le solel\" (by this means an angel is made to keep his finger directed towards the sun), and a perpetual motion wheel which we shall reserve for later discussion.  The clock tower, according to Drover, shows no place for a dial but suggests the use of bells because of its open structure, suitable for letting out the sound. Moreover, he suggests that the delicacy of the line indicates that it was not really a full-size steeple but rather a small towerlike structure standing only a few feet high within the church. There is, alas, nothing to tell us about the clock it was intended to house; most probably it was a water clock similar to that of the illustrated Bible of _ca._ 1285.  The drawing of the rope, wheel and axles, for turning an angel to point towards the sun can have a simple explanation or a more complicated one. If taken at its face value the wheel on its horizontal axis acts as a windlass connected by the counterpoised rope to the vertical shaft which it turns, thereby moving (by hand) the figure of an angel (not shown) fixed to the top of this latter shaft. Such an explanation was in fact suggested by M. Quicherat,[38] who first called attention to the Villard album and pointed out that a leaden angel existed in Chartres before the fire there in 1836. It is a view also supported from another drawing in the album which describes an eagle whose head is made to turn towards the deacon when he reads the Gospel. Slight pressure on the tail of the bird causes a similar rope mechanism to operate.  A quite different interpretation has been suggested by Frémont;[39] he believes that the wheel may have acted as a fly-wheel and the ropes and counterpoises, turning first one way then the other acted as a sort of mechanical escapement. Such an arrangement is however mechanically impossible without some complicated free-wheeling device between the drive and the escapement, and its only effect would be to oscillate the angel rapidly rather than turn it steadily. I believe that Frémont, over-anxious to provide a protoescapement, has done too much violence to the facts and turned away without good reason from the more simple and reasonable explanation. It is nevertheless still possible to adopt this simple interpretation and yet to have the system as part of a clock. If the left-hand counterpoise, conveniently raised higher than that on the right, is considered as a float fitting into a clepsydra jar, instead of as a simple weight, one would have a very suitable automatic system for turning the angel. On this explanation, the purpose of the wheel would be merely to provide the manual adjustment necessary to set the angel from time to time, compensating for irremediable inaccuracies of the clepsydra.  [Illustration: Figure 21.--VILLARD'S PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL, from Lassus (see footnote 37).]  Having discussed the Villard drawings which are already cited in horological literature, we must draw attention to the fact that this medieval architect also gives an illustration of a perpetual motion wheel. In this case (fig. 21) it is of the type having weights at the end of swinging arms, a type that occurs very frequently at later dates in Europe and is also given in the Islamic texts. We cannot, in this case, suggest that drawings of clocks and of perpetual motion devices occur together by more than a coincidence, for Villard seems to have been interested in most sorts of mechanical device. But even this type of coincidence becomes somewhat striking when repeated often enough. It seems that each early mention of \"self-moving wheels\" occurs in connection with some sort of clock or mechanized astronomical device.  Having now completed a survey of the traditions of astronomical models, we have seen that many types of device embodying features later found in mechanical clocks evolved through various cultures and flowed into Europe, coming together in a burst of multifarious activity during the second half of the 13th century, notably in the region of France. We must now attempt to fill the residual gap, and in so doing examine the importance of perpetual motion devices, mechanical and magnetic, in the crucial transition from protoclock to mechanical-escapement clock.     Perpetual Motion and the Clock before de Dondi  We have already noted, more or less briefly, several instances of the use of wheels \"moving by themselves\" or the use of a fluid for purposes other than as a motive power. Chronologically arranged, these are the Indian devices of _ca._ 1150 or a little earlier, as those of Riḍwān _ca._ 1200, that of the Alfonsine mercury clock, _ca._ 1272, and the French Bible illumination of _ca._ 1285. This strongly suggests a steady transmission from East to West, and on the basis of it, we now tentatively propose an additional step, a transmission from China to India and perhaps further West, _ca._ 1100, and possibly reinforced by further transmissions at later dates.  One need only assume the existence of vague traveler's tales about the existence of the 11th-century Chinese clocks with their astronomical models and jackwork and with their great wheel, apparently moving by itself but using water having no external inlet or outlet. Such a stimulus, acting as it did on a later occasion when Galileo received word of the invention of the telescope in the Low Countries, might easily lead to the re-invention of just such perpetual-motion wheels as we have already noted. In many ways, once the idea has been suggested it is natural to associate such a perpetual motion with the incessant diurnal rotation of the heavens. Without some such stimulus however it is difficult to explain why this association did not occur earlier, and why, once it comes there seems to be such a chronological procession from culture to culture.  We now turn to what is undoubtedly the most curious part of this story, in which automatically moving astronomical models and perpetual motion wheels are linked with the earliest texts on magnetism and the magnetic compass, another subject with a singularly troubled historical origin. The key text in this is the famous _Epistle on the magnet_, written by Peter Peregrinus, a Picard, in an army camp at the Siege of Lucera and dated August 8, 1269.[40] In spite of the precise dating it is certain that the work was done long before, for it is quoted unmistakably by Roger Bacon in at least three places, one of which must have been written before _ca._ 1250.[41]  The _Epistle_ contains two parts; in the first there is a general account of magnetism and the properties of the loadstone, closing with a discussion \"of the inquiry whence the magnet receives the natural virtue which it has.\" Peter attributed this virtue to a sympathy with the heavens, proposing to prove his point by the construction of a \"terrella,\" a uniform sphere of loadstone which is to be carefully balanced and mounted in the manner of an armillary sphere, with its axis directed along the polar axis of the diurnal rotation. He then continues:    Now if the stone then move according to the motion of the   heavens, rejoice that you have arrived at a secret marvel.   But if not, let it be ascribed rather to "]]]
