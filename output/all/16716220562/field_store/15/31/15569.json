I fear we'll soon both sputter on the coals.\"  Cappen said nothing. If she wanted to think he had come especially to rescue her, he would not be so ungallant to tell her otherwise.  The troll-wife's mouth gashed in a grin as she walked through the fire to him. \"There is a price,\" she said. \"If you cannot tell me three things about myself which are true beyond disproving, not courage nor amulet nor the gods themselves may avail to keep that red head on your shoulders.\"  Cappen clapped a hand to his sword. \"Why, gladly,\" he said; this was a rule of magic he had learned long ago, that three truths were the needful armor to make any guardian charm work. \"Imprimis, yours is the ugliest nose I ever saw poking up a fire. Secundus, I was never in a house I cared less to guest at. Tertius, ever among trolls you are little liked, being one of the worst.\"  Hildigund moaned with terror as the monster swelled in rage. But there was no movement. Only the leaping flames and the eddying smoke stirred.  Cappen's voice rang out, coldly: \"Now the king lies on the sea, frozen and wet, and I am come to fetch a brand for his fire. And I had best also see his daughter home.\"  The troll shook her head, suddenly chuckling. \"No. The brand you may have, just to get you out of this cave, foulness; but the woman is in my thrall until a man sleeps with her--here--for a night. And if he does, I may have him to break my fast in the morning!\"  Cappen yawned mightily. \"Thank you, mother. Your offer of a bed is most welcome to these tired bones, and I accept gratefully.\"  \"You will die tomorrow!\" she raved. The ground shook under the huge weight of her as she stamped. \"Because of the three truths, I must let you go tonight; but tomorrow I may do what I will!\"  \"Forget not my little friend, mother,\" said Cappen, and touched the cord of the amulet.  \"I tell you, silver has no use against me--\"  Cappen sprawled on the floor and rippled fingers across his harp. \"_A lovely lady full oft lies--_\"  The troll-wife turned from him in a rage. Hildigund ladled up some broth, saying nothing, and Cappen ate it with pleasure, though it could have used more seasoning.  After that he indited a sonnet to the princess, who regarded him wide-eyed. The troll came back from a tunnel after he finished, and said curtly: \"This way.\" Cappen took the girl's hand and followed her into a pitchy, reeking dark.  She plucked an arras aside to show a room which surprised him by being hung with tapestries, lit with candles, and furnished with a fine broad featherbed. \"Sleep here tonight, if you dare,\" she growled. \"And tomorrow I shall eat you--and you, worthless lazy she-trash, will have the hide flayed off your back!\" She barked a laugh and left them.  Hildigund fell weeping on the mattress. Cappen let her cry herself out while he undressed and got between the blankets. Drawing his sword, he laid it carefully in the middle of the bed.  The girl looked at him through jumbled fair locks. \"How can ye dare?\" she whispered. \"One breath of fear, one moment's doubt, and the troll is free to rend ye.\"  \"Exactly.\" Cappen yawned. \"Doubtless she hopes that fear will come to me lying wakeful in the night. Wherefore 'tis but a question of going gently to sleep. O Svearek, Torbek, and Beorna, could you but see how I am resting now!\"  \"But ... the three truths ye gave her ... how knew ye...?\"  \"Oh, those. Well, see you, sweet lady, Primus and Secundus were my own thoughts, and who is to disprove them? Tertius was also clear, since you said there had been no company here in three years--yet are there many trolls in these lands, ergo even they cannot stomach our gentle hostess.\" Cappen watched her through heavy-lidded eyes.  She flushed deeply, blew out the candles, and he heard her slip off her garment and get in with him. There was a long silence.  Then: \"Are ye not--\"  \"Yes, fair one?\" he muttered through his drowsiness.  \"Are ye not ... well, I am here and ye are here and--\"  \"Fear not,\" he said. \"I laid my sword between us. Sleep in peace.\"  \"I ... would be glad--ye have come to deliver--\"  \"No, fair lady. No man of gentle breeding could so abuse his power. Goodnight.\" He leaned over, brushing his lips gently across hers, and lay down again.  \"Ye are ... I never thought man could be so noble,\" she whispered.  Cappen mumbled something. As his soul spun into sleep, he chuckled. Those unresting days and nights on the sea had not left him fit for that kind of exercise. But, of course, if she wanted to think he was being magnanimous, it could be useful later--         *       *       *       *       *  He woke with a start and looked into the sputtering glare of a torch. Its light wove across the crags and gullies of the troll-wife's face and shimmered wetly off the great tusks in her mouth.  \"Good morning, mother,\" said Cappen politely.  Hildigund thrust back a scream.  \"Come and be eaten,\" said the troll-wife.  \"No, thank you,\" said Cappen, regretfully but firmly. \"'Twould be ill for my health. No, I will but trouble you for a firebrand and then the princess and I will be off.\"  \"If you think that stupid bit of silver will protect you, think again,\" she snapped. \"Your three sentences were all that saved you last night. Now I hunger.\"  \"Silver,\" said Cappen didactically, \"is a certain shield against all black magics. So the wizard told me, and he was such a nice white-bearded old man I am sure even his attendant devils never lied. Now please depart, mother, for modesty forbids me to dress before your eyes.\"  The hideous face thrust close to his. He smiled dreamily and tweaked her nose--hard.  She howled and flung the torch at him. Cappen caught it and stuffed it into her mouth. She choked and ran from the room.  \"A new sport--trollbaiting,\" said the bard gaily into the sudden darkness. \"Come, shall we not venture out?\"  The girl trembled too much to move. He comforted her, absentmindedly, and dressed in the dark, swearing at the clumsy leggings. When he left, Hildigund put on her clothes and hurried after him.  The troll-wife squatted by the fire and glared at them as they went by. Cappen hefted his sword and looked at her. \"I do not love you,\" he said mildly, and hewed out.  She backed away, shrieking as he slashed at her. In the end, she crouched at the mouth of a tunnel, raging futilely. Cappen pricked her with his blade.  \"It is not worth my time to follow you down underground,\" he said, \"but if ever you trouble men again, I will hear of it and come and feed you to my dogs. A piece at a time--a very small piece--do you understand?\"  She snarled at him.  \"An _extremely_ small piece,\" said Cappen amiably. \"Have you heard me?\"  Something broke in her. \"Yes,\" she whimpered. He let her go, and she scuttled from him like a rat.  He remembered the firewood and took an armful; on the way, he thoughtfully picked up a few jeweled rings which he didn't think she would be needing and stuck them in his pouch. Then he led the girl outside.  The wind had laid itself, a clear frosty morning glittered on the sea and the longship was a distant sliver against white-capped blueness. The minstrel groaned. \"What a distance to row! Oh, well--\"         *       *       *       *       *  They were at sea before Hildigund spoke. Awe was in the eyes that watched him. \"No man could be so brave,\" she murmured. \"Are ye a god?\"  \"Not quite,\" said Cappen. \"No, most beautiful one, modesty grips my tongue. 'Twas but that I had the silver and was therefore proof against her sorcery.\"  \"But the silver was no help!\" she cried.  Cappen's oar caught a crab. \"What?\" he yelled.  \"No--no--why, she told ye so her own self--\"  \"I thought she lied. I _know_ the silver guards against--\"  \"But she used no magic! Trolls have but their own strength!\"  Cappen sagged in his seat. For a moment he thought he was going to faint. Then only his lack of fear had armored him; and if he had known the truth, that would not have lasted a minute.  He laughed shakily. Another score for his doubts about the overall value of truth!  The longship's oars bit water and approached him. Indignant voices asking why he had been so long on his errand faded when his passenger was seen. And Svearek the king wept as he took his daughter back into his arms.  The hard brown face was still blurred with tears when he looked at the minstrel, but the return of his old self was there too. \"What ye have done, Cappen Varra of Croy, is what no other man in the world could have done.\"  \"Aye--aye--\" The rough northern voices held adoration as the warriors crowded around the slim red-haired figure.  \"Ye shall have her whom ye saved to wife,\" said Svearek, \"and when I die ye shall rule all Norren.\"  Cappen swayed and clutched the rail.  Three nights later he slipped away from their shore camp and turned his face southward.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ January 1957.

Fannia pointed out that if Donnaught had had the brains of an ox, as well as the build, he would have remembered to check the tanks. Donnaught, although twice as big as him, wasn't quite as fast with an insult. He intimated, after a little thought, that Fannia's nose might have obstructed his reading of the fuel gauge.  This still left them twenty light-years from Thetis, with a cupful of transformer fuel in the emergency tank.  \"All right,\" Fannia said presently. \"What's done is done. We can squeeze about three light-years out of the fuel before we're back on atomics. Hand me _The Galactic Pilot_--unless you forgot that, too.\"  Donnaught dragged the bulky microfilm volume out of its locker, and they explored its pages.  _The Galactic Pilot_ told them they were in a sparse, seldom-visited section of space, which they already knew. The nearest planetary system was Hatterfield; no intelligent life there. Sersus had a native population, but no refueling facilities. The same with Illed, Hung and Porderai.  \"Ah-ha!\" Fannia said. \"Read that, Donnaught. If you can read, that is.\"  \"Cascella,\" Donnaught read, slowly and clearly, following the line with a thick forefinger. \"Type M sun. Three planets, intelligent (AA3C) human-type life on second. Oxygen-breathers. Non-mechanical. Religious. Friendly. Unique social structure, described in Galactic Survey Report 33877242. Population estimate: stable at three billion. Basic Cascellan vocabulary taped under Cas33b2. Scheduled for resurvey 2375 A.D. Cache of transformer fuel left, beam coordinate 8741 kgl. Physical descript: Unocc. flatland.\"  \"Transformer fuel, boy!\" Fannia said gleefully. \"I believe we will get to Thetis, after all.\" He punched the new direction on the ship's tape. \"If that fuel's still there.\"  \"Should we read up on the unique social structure?\" Donnaught asked, still poring over _The Galactic Pilot_.  \"Certainly,\" Fannia said. \"Just step over to the main galactic base on Earth and buy me a copy.\"  \"I forgot,\" Donnaught admitted slowly.  \"Let me see,\" Fannia said, dragging out the ship's language library, \"Cascellan, Cascellan ... Here it is. Be good while I learn the language.\" He set the tape in the hypnophone and switched it on. \"Another useless tongue in my overstuffed head,\" he murmured, and then the hypnophone took over.         *       *       *       *       *  Coming out of transformer drive with at least a drop of fuel left, they switched to atomics. Fannia rode the beam right across the planet, locating the slender metal spire of the Galactic Survey cache. The plain was no longer unoccupied, however. The Cascellans had built a city around the cache, and the spire dominated the crude wood-and-mud buildings.  \"Hang on,\" Fannia said, and brought the ship down on the outskirts of the city, in a field of stubble.  \"Now look,\" Fannia said, unfastening his safety belt. \"We're just here for fuel. No souvenirs, no side-trips, no fraternizing.\"  Through the port, they could see a cloud of dust from the city. As it came closer, they made out figures running toward their ship.  \"What do you think this unique social structure is?\" Donnaught asked, pensively checking the charge in a needler gun.  \"I know not and care less,\" Fannia said, struggling into space armor. \"Get dressed.\"  \"The air's breathable.\"  \"Look, pachyderm, for all we know, these Cascellans think the proper way to greet visitors is to chop off their heads and stuff them with green apples. If Galactic says unique, it probably means unique.\"  \"Galactic said they were friendly.\"  \"That means they haven't got atomic bombs. Come on, get dressed.\" Donnaught put down the needler and struggled into an oversize suit of space armor. Both men strapped on needlers, paralyzers, and a few grenades.  \"I don't think we have anything to worry about,\" Fannia said, tightening the last nut on his helmet. \"Even if they get rough, they can't crack space armor. And if they're not rough, we won't have any trouble. Maybe these gewgaws will help.\" He picked up a box of trading articles--mirrors, toys and the like.  Helmeted and armored, Fannia slid out the port and raised one hand to the Cascellans. The language, hypnotically placed in his mind, leaped to his lips.  \"We come as friends and brothers. Take us to the chief.\"  The natives clustered around, gaping at the ship and the space armor. Although they had the same number of eyes, ears and limbs as humans, they completely missed looking like them.  \"If they're friendly,\" Donnaught asked, climbing out of the port, \"why all the hardware?\" The Cascellans were dressed predominantly in a collection of knives, swords and daggers. Each man had at least five, and some had eight or nine.  \"Maybe Galactic got their signals crossed,\" Fannia said, as the natives spread out in an escort. \"Or maybe the natives just use the knives for mumblypeg.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The city was typical of a non-mechanical culture. Narrow, packed-dirt streets twisted between ramshackle huts. A few two-story buildings threatened to collapse at any minute. A stench filled the air, so strong that Fannia's filter couldn't quite eradicate it. The Cascellans bounded ahead of the heavily laden Earthmen, dashing around like a pack of playful puppies. Their knives glittered and clanked.  The chief's house was the only three-story building in the city. The tall spire of the cache was right behind it.  \"If you come in peace,\" the chief said when they entered, \"you are welcome.\" He was a middle-aged Cascellan with at least fifteen knives strapped to various parts of his person. He squatted cross-legged on a raised dais.  \"We are privileged,\" Fannia said. He remembered from the hypnotic language lesson that \"chief\" on Cascella meant more than it usually did on Earth. The chief here was a combination of king, high priest, deity and bravest warrior.  \"We have a few simple gifts here,\" Fannia added, placing the gewgaws at the king's feet. \"Will his majesty accept?\"  \"No,\" the king said. \"We accept no gifts.\" Was that the unique social structure? Fannia wondered. It certainly was not human. \"We are a warrior race. What we want, we take.\"  Fannia sat cross-legged in front of the dais and exchanged conversation with the king while Donnaught played with the spurned toys. Trying to overcome the initial bad impression, Fannia told the chief about the stars and other worlds, since simple people usually liked fables. He spoke of the ship, not mentioning yet that it was out of fuel. He spoke of Cascella, telling the chief how its fame was known throughout the Galaxy.  \"That is as it should be,\" the chief said proudly. \"We are a race of warriors, the like of which has never been seen. Every man of us dies fighting.\"  \"You must have fought some great wars,\" Fannia said politely, wondering what idiot had written up the galactic report.  \"I have not fought a war for many years,\" the chief said. \"We are united now, and all our enemies have joined us.\"  Bit by bit, Fannia led up to the matter of the fuel.  \"What is this 'fuel'?\" the chief asked, haltingly because there was no equivalent for it in the Cascellan language.  \"It makes our ship go.\"  \"And where is it?\"  \"In the metal spire,\" Fannia said. \"If you would just allow us--\"  \"In the holy shrine?\" the chief exclaimed, shocked. \"The tall metal church which the gods left here long ago?\"  \"Yeah,\" Fannia said sadly, knowing what was coming. \"I guess that's it.\"  \"It is sacrilege for an outworlder to go near it,\" the chief said. \"I forbid it.\"  \"We need the fuel.\" Fannia was getting tired of sitting cross-legged. Space armor wasn't built for complicated postures. \"The spire was put here for such emergencies.\"  \"Strangers, know that I am god of my people, as well as their leader. If you dare approach the sacred temple, there will be war.\"  \"I was afraid of that,\" Fannia said, getting to his feet.  \"And since we are a race of warriors,\" the chief said, \"at my command, every fighting man of the planet will move against you. More will come from the hills and from across the rivers.\"  Abruptly, the chief drew a knife. It must have been a signal, because every native in the room did the same.         *       *       *       *       *  Fannia dragged Donnaught away from the toys. \"Look, lummox. These friendly warriors can't do a damn thing to us. Those knives can't cut space armor, and I doubt if they have anything better. Don't let them pile up on you, though. Use the paralyzer first, the needler if they really get thick.\"  \"Right.\" Donnaught whisked out and primed a paralyzer in a single coordinated movement. With weapons, Donnaught was fast and reliable, which was virtue enough for Fannia to keep him as a partner.  \"We'll cut around this building and grab the fuel. Two cans ought to be enough. Then we'll beat it fast.\"  They walked out the building, followed by the Cascellans. Four carriers lifted the chief, who was barking orders. The narrow street outside was suddenly jammed with armed natives. No one tried to touch them yet, but at least a thousand knives were flashing in the sun.  In front of the cache was a solid phalanx of Cascellans. They stood behind a network of ropes that probably marked the boundary between sacred and profane ground.  \"Get set for it,\" Fannia said, and stepped over the ropes.  Immediately the foremost temple guard raised his knife. Fannia brought up the paralyzer, not firing it yet, still moving forward.  The foremost native shouted something, and the knife swept across in a glittering arc. The Cascellan gurgled something else, staggered and fell. Bright blood oozed from his throat.  \"I _told_ you not to use the needler yet!\" Fannia said.  \"I didn't,\" Donnaught protested. Glancing back, Fannia saw that"]]]
