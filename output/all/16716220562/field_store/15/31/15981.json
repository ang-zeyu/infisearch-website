I think you'd better start out there.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said sadly.  \"See if there's any mechanical or electrical defect in any of those computers,\" Burris said. \"Talk to the computer technicians. Find out what's causing all these errors.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He was still trying to feel resigned, but he wasn't succeeding very well.  \"And if you don't find anything--\" Burris began.  \"I'll come right back,\" Malone said instantly.  \"No,\" Burris said. \"You keep on looking.\"  \"I do?\"  \"You do,\" Burris said. \"After all, there has to be _something_ wrong.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said, \"if you say so. But--\"  \"There are the interview tapes,\" Burris said, \"and the reports the congressmen brought in. You can go through those.\"  Malone sighed. \"I guess so,\" he said.  \"And there must be thousands of other things to do,\" Burris said.  \"Well--\" Malone began cautiously.  \"You'll be able to think of them,\" Burris said heartily. \"I know you will. I have confidence in you, Malone. Confidence.\"  \"Thanks,\" Malone said sadly.  \"You just keep me posted from time to time on what you're doing, and what ideas you get,\" Burris said. \"I'm leaving the whole thing in your hands, Malone, and I'm sure you won't disappoint me.\"  \"I'll try,\" Malone said.  \"I know you will,\" Burris said warmly. \"And no matter how long it takes--I know you'll succeed.\"  \"No matter how long it takes?\" Malone said hesitantly.  \"That's right!\" Burris said. \"You can do it, Malone! You can do it.\"  Malone nodded slowly. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"Well, I ... well, I'll start out right away, then.\"  He turned. Before he could make another move Burris said: \"Wait!\"  Malone turned again, hope in his eyes. \"Yes, sir?\" he said.  \"When you leave--\" Burris began, and the hope disappeared \"please do one little favor for me. Just one little favor, because I'm an old, tired man and I'm not used to things any more.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Anything, Chief.\"  \"Don't call me--\"  \"Sorry,\" Malone said.  Burris breathed heavily. \"When you leave,\" he said, \"please, please use the door.\"  \"But--\"  \"Malone,\" Burris said, \"I've tried. I've really tried. Believe me. I've tried to get used to the fact that you can teleport. But--\"  \"It's useful,\" Malone said, \"in my work.\"  \"I can see that,\" Burris said. \"And I don't want you to ... well, to stop doing it. By no means. It's just that it sort of unnerves me, if you see what I mean. No matter how useful it is for the FBI to have an agent who can go instantaneously from one place to another, it unnerves me.\" He sighed. \"I can't get used to seeing you disappear like an over-dried soap bubble, Malone. It does something to me--here.\" He placed a hand directly over his sternum and sighed again.  \"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"It unnerved me, too, the first time I saw it. I thought I was going crazy, when that kid--Mike Fueyo--winked out like a light. But then we got him, and some FBI agents besides me have learned the trick.\" He stopped there, wondering if he'd been tactful. After all, it took a latent ability to learn teleportation, and some people had it, while others didn't. Malone, along with a few other agents, did. Burris evidently didn't--so he couldn't teleport, no matter how hard he tried or how many lessons he took.  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"I'm still unnerved. So ... please, Malone ... when you come in here, or go out, use the door. All right?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He turned and went out. As he opened the door, he could almost hear Burris' sigh of relief. Then he banged it shut behind him and, feeling that he might as well continue with his spacebound existence, walked all the way to the elevator, and rode it downstairs to the FBI laboratories.  The labs, highly efficient and divided into dozens of departments, covered several floors. Malone passed through the Fingerprint section, filled with technicians doing strange things to great charts and slides, and frowning over tiny pieces of material and photographs. Then came Forgery Detection, involving many more technicians, many more slides and charts and tiny pieces of things and photographs, and even a witness or two sitting on the white bench at one side and looking lost and somehow civilian. Identification Classified was next, a great barn of a room filled with index files. The real indexes were in the sub-basement; here, on microfilm, were only the basic division. A man was standing in front of one of the files, frowning at it. Malone went on by without stopping.  Cosmetic Surgery Classification came next. Here there were more indexes, and there were also charts and slides. There was an FBI agent sitting on a bench looking bored while two female technicians--classified as O&U for Old and Ugly in Malone's mind--fluttered around him, deciding what disguises were possible, and which of those was indicated for the particular job on hand. Malone waved to the agent, whom he knew very slightly, and went on. He felt vaguely regretful that the FBI couldn't hire prettier girls for the Cosmetic Surgery Division, but the trouble was that pretty girls fell for the agents--and vice versa--and this led to an unfortunate tendency toward only handsome and virile-looking disguises. The O&U Division was unfortunate, he decided, but a necessity.  Chemical Analysis (III) was next. The Chemical Analysis section was scattered over several floors, with the first stages up above. Division III, Malone remembered, was devoted to non-poisonous substances--like clay or sand found in boots or trouser cuffs, cigar ashes and such. They were placed on the same floor as Fingerprints to allow free and frequent passage between the sections on the problems of plastic prints--made in putty or like substances--and visible prints, made when the hand is covered with a visible substance like blood, ketchup or glue.  Malone found what he was looking for at the very end of the floor. It was the Computer Section, a large room filled with humming, clacking and buzzing machines of an ancient vintage, muttering to themselves as they worked, and newer machines which were smaller and more silent. Lights were lighting and bells were ringing softly, relays were relaying and the whole room was a gigantic maze of calculating and control machines. What space wasn't filled by the machines themselves was filled by workbenches, all littered with an assortment of gears, tubes, spare relays, transistors, wires, rods, bolts, resistors and all the other paraphernalia used in building the machines and repairing them. Beyond the basic room were other, smaller rooms, each assigned to a particular kind of computer work.  The narrow aisles were choked here and there with men who looked up as Malone passed by, but most of them gave him one quick glance and went back to work. A few didn't even do that, but went right on concentrating on their jobs. Malone headed for a man working all alone in front of a workbench, frowning down at a complicated-looking mechanism that seemed to have neither head nor tail, and prodding at it with a long, thin screwdriver. The man was thin, too, but not very long; he was a little under average height, and he had straight black hair, thick-lensed glasses and a studious expression, even when he was frowning. He looked as if the mechanism were a student who had cut too many classes, and he was being kindly but firm with it.         *       *       *       *       *  Malone managed to get to the man's side, and coughed discreetly. There was no response.  \"Fred?\" he said.  The screwdriver waggled a little. Malone wasn't quite sure that the man was breathing.  \"Fred Mitchell,\" he said.  Mitchell didn't look up. Another second passed.  \"Hey,\" Malone said. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"Fred,\" he said in a loud, reasonable-sounding voice, \"the State Department's translator has started to talk pig-Latin.\"  Mitchell straightened up as if somebody had jabbed him with a pin. The screwdriver waved wildly in the air for a second, and then pointed at Malone. \"That's impossible,\" Mitchell said in a flat, precise voice. \"Simply impossible. It doesn't have a pig-Latin circuit. It can't possibly--\" He blinked and seemed to see Malone for the first time. \"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, Malone. What can I do for you?\"  Malone smiled, feeling a little victorious at having got through the Mitchell armor, which was almost impregnable when there was a job in hand. \"I've been standing here talking to you for some time.\"  \"Oh, have you?\" Mitchell said. \"I was busy.\" That, obviously, explained that. Malone shrugged.  \"I want you to help me check over some calculators, Fred,\" he said. \"We've had some reports that some of the government machines are out of kilter, and I'd like you to go over them for me.\"  \"Out of kilter?\" Fred Mitchell said. \"No, you can forget about it. It's absolutely unnecessary to make a check--believe me. Absolutely. Forget it.\" He smiled suddenly. \"I suppose it's some kind of a joke, isn't it?\" he said, just a trifle uncertainly. Fred Mitchell's world, while pleasant, did not include much humor, Malone knew. \"It's supposed to be funny,\" he said in the same flat, precise voice.  \"It isn't funny,\" Malone said.  Fred sighed. \"Then they're obviously lying,\" he said, \"and that's all there is to it. Why bother me with it?\"  \"Certainly,\" Fred said. He looked at the machinery with longing.  Malone took a breath. \"How do you know?\" he said.  Fred sighed. \"It's perfectly obvious,\" he said in a patient tone. \"Since the State Department translator has no pig-Latin circuit, it can't possibly be talking pig-Latin. I will admit that such a circuit would be relatively easy to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30434"],["title","Occasion for Disaster (#2)"],["body","d, though it would have no utility as far as I can see. Except, of course, for a joke.\" He paused. \"Joke?\" he said, in a slightly uneasy tone.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Joke.\"  Mitchell looked relieved. \"Very well, then,\" he began. \"Since--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"The pig-Latin is a joke. That's right. But I'm not talking about the pig-Latin.\"  \"You're not?\" Mitchell asked, surprised.  \"No,\" Malone said.  Mitchell frowned. \"But you said--\" he began.  \"A joke,\" Malone said. \"You were perfectly right. The pig-Latin is a joke.\" He waited for Fred's expression to clear, and then added: \"But what I want to talk to you about isn't.\"  \"It sounds very confused,\" Fred said after a pause. \"Not at all the sort of thing that ... that usually goes on.\"  \"You have no idea,\" Malone said. \"It's about the political machines, all right, but it isn't anything as simple as pig-Latin.\" He explained, taking his time over it.  When he had finished, Fred was nodding his head slowly. \"I see,\" he said. \"I understand just what you want me to do.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said.  \"I'll take a team over to the Senate Office Building,\" Fred said, \"and check the computer-secretaries there. That way, you see, I'll be able to do a full running check on them without taking any one machine out of operation for too long.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said.  \"And it shouldn't take long,\" Fred went on, \"to find out just what the trouble is.\" He looked very confident.  \"How long?\" Malone asked.  Fred shrugged. \"Oh,\" he said, \"five or six days.\"  Malone repressed an impulse to scream. \"Days?\" he said. \"I mean ... well, look, Fred, it's important. Very important. Can't you do the job any faster?\"  Fred gave a little sigh. \"Checking and repairing all those machines,\" he said, \"is an extremely complex job. Sometimes, Malone, I don't think you realize quite how complex, and how delicate a job it is to deal with such a high-order machine. Why--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Check and repair them?\"  \"Of course,\" Fred said.  \"But I don't want them repaired,\" Malone said. Seeing the look of horror on Fred's face, he added hastily: \"I only want a report from you on what's wrong, whether they are actually making errors or not. And if they are making errors, just what's making them do it. And just what kind of errors. See?\"  Fred nodded very slowly. \"But I can't just ... just leave them there,\" he said piteously. \"In ... pieces and everything. It isn't right, Malone. It just isn't right.\"  \"Well, then,\" Malone said with energy, \"you go right ahead and repair them, if you want to. Fix 'em all up. But you can do that _after_ you make the report to me, can't you?\"  \"I--\" Fred hesitated. \"I had planned to check and repair each machine on an individual basis--\"  \"The Congress can allow for a short suspension,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, they can now--or as soon as I get the word to them. Suppose you check all the machines first, and then get around to the repair work.\"  \"It's not the best way,\" Fred demurred.  Malone discovered that it was his turn to sigh. \"Is it the fastest?\" he said.  Fred nodded.  \"Then it's the best,\" Malone said. \"How long?\"  Fred rolled his eyes to the ceiling and calculated silently for a second. \"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced, returning his gaze to Malone.  \"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Fine.\"  \"But--\"  \"Never mind the buts,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"I'll count on hearing from you tomorrow morning.\"  \"Oh--\" Fred said. \"All right.\"  \"And if it looks like sabotage,\" Malone added, \"if the errors aren't caused by normal wear and tear on the machines--you let me know right away. Phone me. Don't waste an instant.\"  [Illustration]  \"I'll ... I'll start right away,\" Fred said heavily. He looked sadly at the mechanism he had been working on, and put his screwdriver down next to it. It looked to Malone as if he were putting flowers on the grave of a dear departed. \"I'll get a team together,\" Fred added. He gave the mechanism and screwdriver one last fond parting look.  Malone looked after him for a second, thinking of nothing in particular, and then turned in the opposite direction and headed back toward the elevator. As he walked, he began to feel more and more pleased with himself. After all, he'd gotten the investigation started, hadn't he?  And now all he had to do was go back to his office and read some reports and listen to some interview tapes, and then he could go home.  The reports and the interview tapes didn't exactly sound like fun, Malone thought, but at the same time they seemed fairly innocent. He would work his way through them grimly, and maybe he would even indulge his most secret vice and smoke a cigar or two to make the work pass more pleasantly. Soon enough, he told himself, they would be finished with.  Sometimes, though, he regretted the reputation he'd gotten. It had been bad enough in the old days--the pre-1971 days when Malone had thought he was just lucky. Burris had called him a Boy Wonder then, when he'd cracked three difficult cases in a row. Being just lucky had made it a little tough to live with the Boy Wonder label--after all, Malone thought, it wasn't actually as if he'd done anything.  But since 1971 and the case of the Telepathic Spy, things had gotten worse. Much worse. Now Malone wasn't just lucky any more. Instead, he could teleport and he could even foretell the future a little, in a dim sort of way. He'd caught the Telepathic Spy that way, and when the case of the Teleporting Juvenile Delinquents had come up he'd been assigned to that one too, and he'd cracked it. Now Burris seemed to think of him as a kind of god, and gave him all the tough dirty jobs.  And if he wasn't just lucky any more, Malone couldn't think of himself as a Fearless, Heroic FBI Agent, either. He just wasn't the type. He was--well, talented. That was the word, he told himself: talented. He had all these talents and they made him look like something spectacular to Burris and the other FBI men. But he wasn't, really. He hadn't done anything really tough to get his talents; they'd just happened to him.  Nobody, though, seemed to believe that. He heaved a little sigh and stepped into the waiting elevator.  There were, after all, he thought, compensations. He'd had some good times, and the talents did come in handy. And he did have his pick of the vacation schedule lately. And he'd met some lovely girls--  And besides, he told himself savagely as the elevator shot upward, he wasn't going to do anything except return to his office and read some reports and listen to some tapes. And then he was going to go home and sleep all night, peacefully. And in the morning Mitchell was going to call him up and tell him that the computer-secretaries needed nothing more than a little repair. He'd say they were getting old, and he'd be a little pathetic about it; but it wouldn't be anything serious. Malone would send out orders to get the machines repaired, and that would be that. And then the next case would be something both normal and exciting, like a bank robbery or a kidnapping involving a gorgeous blonde who would be so grateful to Malone that--  He had stepped out of the elevator and gone down the corridor without noticing it. He pushed at his own office door and walked into the outer room. The train of thought he had been following was very nice, and sounded very attractive indeed, he told himself.  Unfortunately, he didn't believe it. His prescient ability, functioning with its usual efficient aplomb, told Malone that things would not be better, or simpler, in the morning. They would be worse, and more complicated.  They would be quite a lot worse.  And, as usual, that prescience was perfectly accurate.   II  The telephone, Malone realized belatedly, had had a particularly nasty-sounding ring. He might have known it would be bad news.  As a matter of fact, he told himself sadly, he had known.  \"Nothing at all wrong?\" he said into the mouthpiece. \"Not with any of the computers?\" He blinked. \"Not even one of them?\"  \"Not a thing,\" Mitchell said. \"I'll be sending a report up to you in a little while. You read it; we put them through every test, and it's all detailed there.\"  \"I'm sure you were very thorough,\" Malone said helplessly.  \"Of course we were,\" Mitchell said. \"Of course. And the machines passed every single test. Every one. Malone, it was beautiful.\"  \"Goody,\" Malone said at random. \"But there's got to be something--\"  \"There is, Malone,\" Fred said. \"There is. I think there's definitely something odd going on. Something funny. I mean peculiar, not humorous.\"  \"I thought so,\" Malone put in.  \"Right,\" Fred said. \"Malone, try and relax. This is a hard thing to say, and it must be even harder to hear. But--\"  \"Tell me,\" Malone said. \"Who's dead? Who's been killed?\"  \"I know it's tough, Malone,\" Fred went on.  \"Is everybody dead?\" Malone said. \"It can't be just one person, not from that tone in your voice. Has somebody assassinated the entire Senate? Or the President and his Cabinet? Or--\"  \"It's nothing like that, Malone,\" Fred said, in a tone that implied that such occurrences were really rather minor. \"It's the machines.\"  \"The machines?\"  \"That's right,\" Fred said grimly. \"After we checked them over and found they were in good shape, I asked for samples of both the input and the output of each machine. I wanted to do a thorough job.\"  \"Congratulations,\" Malone said. \"What happened?\"  Fred took a deep breath. \"They don't agree,\" he said.  \"They don't?\" Malone said. The phrase sounded as if it meant something momentous, but he couldn't quite figure out what. In a minute, he thought confusedly, it would come to him. But did he want it to?  \"They definitely do not agree,\" Fred was saying. \"The correlation is erratic; it makes no statistical sense. Malone, there are two possibilities.\"  \"Tell me about them,\" Malone said. He was beginning to feel relieved. To Fred, the malfunction of a machine was more serious than the murder of the entire Congress. But Malone couldn't"]]]
