[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30338"],["title","Freedom (#2)"],["body"," Colonel Ilya Simonov, in spite of his profession, was not immune to beauty. He deliberately failed to notify his new office of his arrival, flew in on a Ceskoslovenskè Aerolinie Tupolev rocket liner and spent his first night at the Alcron Hotel just off Wenceslas Square. He knew that as the new manager of the local Moskvich distribution agency he'd have fairly elaborate quarters, probably in a good section of town, but this first night he wanted to himself.  He spent it wandering quietly in the old quarter, dropping in to the age-old beer halls for a half liter of Pilsen Urquell here, a foaming stein of Smichov Lager there. Czech beer, he was reminded all over again, is the best in the world. No argument, no debate, the best in the world.  He ate in the endless automated cafeterias that line the Viclavské Námesi the entertainment center of Prague. Ate an open sandwich here, some crabmeat salad there, a sausage and another glass of Pilsen somewhere else again. He was getting the feel of the town and of its people. Of recent years, some of the tension had gone out of the atmosphere in Moscow and the other Soviet centers; with the coming of economic prosperity there had also come a relaxation. The _fear_, so heavy in the Stalin era, had fallen off in that of Khrushchev and still more so in the present reign of Frol Zverev. In fact, Ilya Simonov was not alone in Party circles in wondering whether or not discipline had been allowed to slip too far. It is easier, the old Russian proverb goes, to hang onto the reins than to regain them once dropped.  [Illustration]  But if Moscow had lost much of its pall of fear, Prague had certainly gone even further. In fact, in the U Pinkasu beer hall Simonov had idly picked up a magazine left by some earlier wassailer. It was a light literary publication devoted almost exclusively to humor. There were various cartoons, some of them touching political subjects. Ilya Simonov had been shocked to see a caricature of Frol Zverev himself. Zverev, Number One! Ridiculed in a second-rate magazine in a satellite country!  Ilya Simonov made a note of the name and address of the magazine and the issue.  Across the heavy wooden community table from him, a beer drinker grinned, in typically friendly Czech style. \"A good magazine,\" he said. \"You should subscribe.\"  A waiter, bearing an even dozen liter-size steins of beer hurried along, spotted the fact that Simonov's mug was empty, slipped a full one into its place, gave the police agent's saucer a quick mark of a pencil, and hurried on again. In the U Pinkasu, it was supposed that you wanted another beer so long as you remained sitting. When you finally staggered to your feet, the nearest waiter counted the number of pencil marks on your saucer and you paid up.  Ilya Simonov said cautiously to his neighbor, \"Seems to be quite, ah, brash.\" He tapped the magazine with a finger.  The other shrugged and grinned again. \"Things loosen up as the years go by,\" he said. \"What a man wouldn't have dared say to his own wife five years ago, they have on TV today.\"  \"I'm surprised the police don't take steps,\" Simonov said, trying to keep his voice expressionless.  The other took a deep swallow of his Pilsen Urquell. He pursed his lips and thought about it. \"You know, I wonder if they'd dare. Such a case brought into the People's Courts might lead to all sort of public reaction these days.\"  It had been some years since Ilya Simonov had been in Prague and even then he'd only gone through on the way to the ski resorts in the mountains. He was shocked to find the Czech state's control had fallen off to this extent. Why, here he was, a complete stranger, being openly talked to on political subjects.  His cross-the-table neighbor shook his head, obviously pleased. \"If you think Prague is good, you ought to see Warsaw. It's as free as Paris! I saw a Tri-D cinema up there about two months ago. You know what it was about? The purges in Moscow back in the 1930s.\"  \"A rather unique subject,\" Simonov said.  \"Um-m-m, made a very strong case for Bukharin, in particular.\"  Simonov said, very slowly, \"I don't understand. You mean this ... this film supported the, ah, Old Bolsheviks?\"  \"Of course. Why not? Everybody knows they weren't guilty.\" The Czech snorted deprecation. \"At least not guilty of what they were charged with. They were in Stalin's way and he liquidated them.\" The Czech thought about it for a while. \"I wonder if he was already insane, that far back.\"  Had he taken up his mug of beer and dashed it into Simonov's face, he couldn't have surprised the Russian more.  Ilya Simonov had to take control of himself. His first instinct was to show his credentials, arrest the man and have him hauled up before the local agency of Simonov's ministry.  But obviously that was out of the question. He was in Czechoslovakia and, although Moscow still dominated the Soviet Complex, there was local autonomy and the Czech police just didn't enjoy their affairs being meddled with unless in extreme urgency.  Besides, this man was obviously only one among many. A stranger in a beer hall. Ilya Simonov suspected that if he continued his wanderings about the town, he'd meet in the process of only one evening a score of persons who would talk the same way.  Besides, still again, he was here in Prague incognito, his job to trace the sources of this dry rot, not to run down individual Czechs.  But the cinema, and TV! Surely anti-Party sentiment hadn't been allowed to go this far!  He got up from the table shakily, paid up for his beer and forced himself to nod good-bye in friendly fashion to the subversive Czech he'd been talking to.  In the morning he strolled over to the offices of the Moskvich Agency which was located only a few blocks from his hotel on Celetna Hybernski. The Russian car agency, he knew, was having a fairly hard go of it in Prague and elsewhere in Czechoslovakia. The Czechs, long before the Party took over in 1948, had been a highly industrialized, modern nation. They consequently had their own automobile works, such as Skoda, and their models were locally more popular than the Russian Moskvich, Zim and Pobeda.  Theoretically, the reason Ilya Simonov was the newly appointed agency head was to push Moskvich sales among the Czechs. He thought, half humorously, half sourly, to himself, even under the Party we have competition and pressure for higher sales. What was it that some American economist had called them? a system of State-Capitalism.  At the Moskvich offices he found himself in command of a staff that consisted of three fellow Russians, and a dozen or so Czech assistants. His immediate subordinate was a Catherina Panova, whose dossier revealed her to be a party member, though evidently not a particularly active one, at least not since she'd been assigned here in Prague.  She was somewhere in her mid-twenties, a graduate of the University of Moscow, and although she'd been in the Czech capital only a matter of six months or so, had already adapted to the more fashionable dress that the style-conscious women of this former Western capital went in for. Besides that, Catherina Panova managed to be one of the downright prettiest girls Ilya Simonov had ever seen.  His career had largely kept him from serious involvement in the past. Certainly the dedicated women you usually found in Party ranks seldom were of the type that inspired you to romance but he wondered now, looking at this new assistant of his, if he hadn't let too much of his youth go by without more investigation into the usually favorite pastime of youth.  He wondered also, but only briefly, if he should reveal his actual identity to her. She was, after all, a party member. But then he checked himself. Kliment Blagonravov had stressed the necessity of complete secrecy. Not even the local offices of the ministry were to be acquainted with his presence.  He let Catherina introduce him around, familiarize him with the local methods of going about their business affairs and the problems they were running into.  She ran a hand back over her forehead, placing a wisp of errant hair, and said, \"I suppose, as an expert from Moscow, you'll be installing a whole set of new methods.\"  It was far from his intention to spend much time at office work. He said, \"Not at all. There is no hurry. For a time, we'll continues your present policies, just to get the feel of the situation. Then perhaps in a few months, we'll come up with some ideas.\"  She obviously liked his use of \"we\" rather than \"I.\" Evidently, the staff had been a bit nervous upon his appointment as new manager. He already felt, vaguely, that the three Russians here had no desire to return to their homeland. Evidently, there was something about Czechoslovakia that appealed to them all. The fact irritated him but somehow didn't surprise.  Catherina said, \"As a matter of fact, I have some opinions on possible changes myself. Perhaps if you'll have dinner with me tonight, we can discuss them informally.\"  Ilya Simonov was only mildly surprised at her suggesting a rendezvous with him. Party members were expected to ignore sex and be on an equal footing. She was as free to suggest a dinner date to him, as he was to her. Of course, she wasn't speaking as a Party member now. In fact, he hadn't even revealed to her his own membership.  As it worked out, they never got around to discussing distribution of the new Moskvich aircushion jet car. They became far too busy enjoying food, drink, dancing--and each other.  They ate at the Budapest, in the Prava Hotel, complete with Hungarian dishes and Riesling, and they danced to the inevitable gypsy music. It occurred to Ilya Simonov that there was a certain pleasure to be derived from the fact that your feminine companion was the most beautiful woman in the establishment and one of the most attractively dressed. There was a certain lift to be enjoyed when you realized that the eyes of half the other males present were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30338"],["title","Freedom (#3)"],["body","you in envy.  One thing led to another. He insisted on introducing her to barack, the Hungarian national spirit, in the way of a digestive. The apricot brandy, distilled to the point of losing all sweetness and fruit flavor, required learning. It must be tossed back just so. By the time Catherina had the knack, neither of them were feeling strain. In fact, it became obviously necessary for him to be given a guided tour of Prague's night spots.  It turned out that Prague offered considerably more than Moscow, which even with the new relaxation was still one of the most staid cities in the Soviet Complex.  They took in the vaudeville at the Alhambra, and the variety at the Prazské Varieté.  They took in the show at the U Sv Tomíse, the age old tavern which had been making its own smoked black beer since the fifteenth century. And here Catherina with the assistance of revelers from neighboring tables taught him the correct pronunciation of _Na zdraví!_ the Czech toast. It seemed required to go from heavy planked table to table practicing the new salutation to the accompaniment of the pungent borovika gin.  Somewhere in here they saw the Joseph Skupa puppets, and at this stage, Ilya Simonov found only great amusement at the political innuendoes involved in half the skits. It would never had one in Moscow or Leningrad, of course, but here it was very amusing indeed. There was even a caricature of a security police minister who could only have been his superior Kliment Blagonravov.  They wound up finally at the U Kalicha, made famous by Hasek in \"The Good Soldier Schweik.\" In fact various illustrations from the original classic were framed on the walls.  They had been laughing over their early morning snack, now Ilya Simonov looked at her approvingly. \"See here,\" he said. \"We must do this again.\"  \"Fine,\" she laughed.  \"In fact, tomorrow,\" he insisted. He looked at his watch. \"I mean tonight.\"  She laughed at him. \"Our great expert from Moscow. Far from improving our operations, there'll be less accomplished than ever if you make a nightly practice of carrying on like we did this evening.\"  He laughed too. \"But tonight,\" he said insistently.  She shook her head. \"Sorry, but I'm already booked up for this evening.\"  He scowled for the first time in hours. He'd seemingly forgotten that he hardly knew this girl. What her personal life was, he had no idea. For that matter, she might be engaged or even married. The very idea irritated him.  He said stiffly, \"Ah, you have a date?\"  Catherina laughed again. \"My, what a dark face. If I didn't know you to be an automobile distributor expert, I would suspect you of being a security police agent.\" She shook her head. \"Not a date. If by that you mean another man. There is a meeting that I would like to attend.\"  \"A meeting! It sounds dry as--\"  She was shaking her head. \"Oh, no. A group I belong to. Very interesting. We're to be addressed by an American journalist.\"  Suddenly he was all but sober.  He tried to smooth over the short space of silence his surprise had precipitated. \"An American journalist? Under government auspices?\"  \"Hardly.\" She smiled at him over her glass of Pilsen. \"I forget,\" she said. \"If you're from Moscow, you probably aren't aware of how open things are here in Prague. A whiff of fresh air.\"  \"I don't understand. Is this group of yours, ah, illegal?\"  She shrugged impatiently. \"Oh, of course not. Don't be silly. We gather to hear various speakers, to discuss world affairs. That sort of thing. Oh, of course, _theoretically_ it's illegal, but for that matter even the head of the Skoda plant attended last week. It's only for the more advanced intellectuals, of course. Very advanced. But, for that matter, I know a dozen or so Party members, both Czech and Russian, who attend.\"  \"But an American journalist? What's he doing in the country? Is he accredited?\"  \"No, no. You misunderstand. He entered as a tourist, came across some Prague newspapermen and as an upshot he's to give a talk on freedom of the press.\"  \"I see,\" Simonov said.  She was impatient with him. \"You don't understand at all. See here, why don't you come along tonight? I'm sure I can get you in.\"  \"It sounds like a good idea,\" Ilya Simonov said. He was completely sober now.         *       *       *       *       *  He made a written report to Kliment Blagonravov before turning in. He mentioned the rather free discussion of matters political in the Czech capital, using the man he'd met in the beer hall as an example. He reported--although, undoubtedly, Blagonravov would already have the information--hearing of a Polish Tri-D film which had defended the Old Bolsheviks purged in the 1930s. He mentioned the literary magazine, with its caricature of Frol Zverev, and, last of all, and then after hesitation, he reported party member Catherina Panova, who evidently belonged to a group of intellectuals who were not above listening to a talk given by a foreign journalist who was not speaking under the auspices of the Czech Party nor the government.  At the office, later, Catherina grinned at him and made a face. She ticked it off on her fingers. \"Riesling, barack, smoked black beer, and borovika gin--we should have know better.\"  He went along with her, putting one hand to his forehead. \"We should have stuck to vodka.\"  \"Well,\" she said, \"tonight we can be virtuous. An intellectual evening, rather than a carouse.\"  Actually, she didn't look at all the worse for wear. Evidently, Catherina Panova was still young enough that she could pub crawl all night, and still look fresh and alert in the morning. His own mouth felt lined with improperly tanned suede.  He was quickly fitting into the routine of the office. Actually, it worked smoothly enough that little effort was demanded of him. The Czech employees handled almost all the details. Evidently, the word of his evening on the town had somehow spread, and the fact that he was prone to a good time had relieved their fears of a martinet sent down from the central offices. They were beginning to relax in his presence.  In fact, they relaxed to the point where one of the girls didn't even bother to hide the book she was reading during a period where there was a lull in activity. It was Pasternak's \"Doctor Zhivago.\"  He frowned remembering vaguely the controversy over the book a couple of decades earlier. Ilya Simonov said, \"Pasternak. Do they print his works here in Czechoslovakia?\"  The girl shrugged and looked at the back of the cover. \"German publisher,\" she said idly. \"Printed in Frankfurt.\"  He kept his voice from registering either surprise or disapproval. \"You mean such books are imported? By whom?\"  \"Oh, not imported by an official agency, but we Czechs are doing a good deal more travel than we used to. Business trips, tourist trips, vacations. And, of course, we bring back books you can't get here.\" She shrugged again. \"Very common.\"  Simonov said blankly. \"But the customs. The border police--\"  She smiled in a manner that suggested he lacked sophistication. \"They never bother any more. They're human, too.\"  Ilya Simonov wandered off. He was astonished at the extent to which controls were slipping in a satellite country. There seemed practically no discipline, in the old sense, at all. He began to see one reason why his superior had sent him here to Prague. For years, most of his work had been either in Moscow or in the newly opened industrial areas in Siberia. He had lost touch with developments in this part of the Soviet Complex.  It came to him that this sort of thing could work like a geometric progression. Give a man a bit of rope one day, and he expects, and takes, twice as much the next, and twice that the next. And as with individuals, so with whole populations.  This was going to have to be stopped soon, or Party control would disappear. Ilya Simonov felt an edge of uncertainty. Nikita Khrushchev should never have made those first motions of liberalization following Stalin's death. Not if they eventually culminated in this sort of thing.  He and Catherina drove to her meeting place that evening after dinner.  She explained as they went that the group was quite informal, usually meeting at the homes of group members who had fairly large places in the country. She didn't seem to know how it had originally begun. The meetings had been going on for a year of more before she arrived in Prague. A Czech friend had taken her along one night, and she'd been attending ever since. There were other, similar groups, in town.  \"But what's the purpose of the organization?\" Simonov asked her.  She was driving her little aircushion Moskvich. They crossed over the Vltava River by the Cechuv Bridge and turned right. On the hill above them loomed the fantastically large statue of Stalin which had been raised immediately following the Second War. She grimaced at it, muttered, \"I wonder if he was insane from the first.\"  He hadn't understood her change of subject. \"How do you mean?\" he said.  \"Stalin. I wonder how early it was in his career that he went insane.\"  This was the second time in the past few days that Ilya Simonov had run into this matter of the former dictator's mental condition. He said now, \"I've heard the opinion before. Where did you pick it up?\"  \"Oh, it's quite commonly believed in the Western countries.\"  \"But, have you ever been, ah, West?\"  [Illustration]  \"Oh, from time to time! Berlin, Vienna, Geneva. Even Paris twice, on vacation, you know, and to various conferences. But that's not what I mean. In the western magazines and newspapers. You can get them here in Prague now. But to get back to your question. There is no particular purpose of the organization.\"  She turned the car left on Budenská and sped up into the Holesovice section of town.         *       *       *       *       *  The nonchalance of it all was what stopped Ilya Simonov. Here was a Party member calmly discussing whether or not the greatest Russian of them all,"]]]
