As a result, it became customary in Jefferson county, Alabama, to arrest negroes in large numbers. Deputy sheriffs would go out to mining camps where there were large numbers of laborers and bring back fifty or more negroes at a time. This condition became unbearable both to the employer and to the employe. Calling attention to the evil of this fee system, Dr. W.H. Oates, State Prison Inspector, said in his annual report for 1914:[26]      The vile, pernicious, pervading fee system beggars description     and my vocabulary is inadequate to describe its deleterious     and baneful effects. It increases in the management of our     jails greed for the almighty dollar. Prisoners are arrested     because of the dollar and, shame to say, are frequently kept     in captivity for months in steel cages for no other reason     than the almighty dollar.  During the fiscal year ending September 30, 1917, Jefferson county had 6,000 prisoners as follows:    In jail at the beginning of the year        328   Incarcerated during the year:             White men                  1,289             Negro men                  3,636             White women                  118             Negro women                  969                                        -----                  Total                 6,340  The fee bill, according to the sheriff's annual report of this department was $37,688.90. As the law provided that for each prisoner the sheriff shall receive 30 cents a day for feeding, and as a matter of fact the sheriff fed them for 10 cents a day, it is clear that he made a net profit of $25,125.94 during one fiscal year or at the same rate for his term of four years, $100,503.76.[27]  Another frequent complaint was directed against the accommodations for travel. It generally happens that the cars are crowded because the amount of space allotted is insufficient, and negroes as a class are denied accommodation in sleeping and dining cars. Usually there is but one toilet for both sexes and the waiting rooms at stations are cut off, unclean and insanitary. Then there are numerous petty offenses, which in themselves appear trifling, but which are spoken of as being on the whole considerably annoying. White men are permitted to come into the negroes' part of the coach and entertain the conductor, newsboy and flagman, all of whom usually make their headquarters there. The drunkards, the insane and other undesirables are forced into this comparment among negro women who have to listen to oaths and vulgar utterances. In stopping at some points, the trains halt the negro car in muddy and abominably disagreeable places; the rudeness and incivility of the public servants are ever apparent, and at the stations the negroes must wait at a separate window until every white passenger has purchased a ticket before he is waited on, although he may be delayed long enough to miss the train.  Both whites and negroes in mentioning the reasons for the movement generally give lynching as one of the most important causes and state that the fear of the mob has greatly accelerated the exodus. Negroes in Florida gave as their reason for going north the horrible lynchings in Tennessee. The white press in Georgia maintained that lynchings were driving the negroes in large numbers from that State. A careful study of the movement, however, shows that bad treatment by representatives of the law caused almost as many negroes to leave the South as lynchings, for, whereas lynchings were more or less sporadic, persecutions and mistreatment by representatives of the law were trials which all negroes had continually to bear and from which they were anxious to escape.[28]  Many of these causes then have their origin on the one hand in the attitude which the South assumes toward the negro as expressed in law and public opinion, and on the other hand in the feeling of the negro toward the South because of the treatment given him. A negro educator of Mississippi sought to explain the situation, saying:      Many white men of high intellectual ability and keen     discernment have mistaken the negroes' silence for     contentment, his facial expression for satisfaction at     prevailing conditions, and his songs and jovial air for     happiness.[29] But this is not always so. These are his     methods of bearing trouble and keeping his soul sweet under     seeming wrongs. In the absence of a spokesman or means of     communication with the whites over imagined grievances, he has     brightened his countenance, smiled and sung to ease his mind.     In the midst of it all he is unable to harmonize with the     practices of daily life the teachings of the Bible which the     white Christian placed in his hands. He finds it difficult to     harmonize the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man,     and his faith is put to the test in the _Providence_ which     enslaved his ancestors, corrupted his blood and placed upon     him stigmas more damaging than to be a leper or convict by     making his color a badge of infamy and his preordained social     position at the bottom of human society. So firmly has his     status been fixed by this _Providence_ that neither moral     worth, fidelity to trust, love of home, loyalty to country, or     faith in God can raise him to human recognition.      When he remembers that he has been the beast of burden of     southern civilization and the foundation of its luxuriant     ease, when he rehearses to his children that he was the     South's sole dependence when his master was away repelling     hostile armies, and how he worked by day and guarded his     unprotected mistress and her children at night, or accompanied     his master to the swamps of Virginia and the Carolinas and     bound up his wounds or brought his maimed or dead body home on     his shoulders, these children can not understand the attitude     of the South toward them. They do not understand why they     have not been educated to efficiency and employed to the best     interest of the South. They do not understand why they have     not been given better living conditions, a more equitable     division of funds appropriated for the education of the youth,     nor provisions made for their higher or professional training,     or why so much prejudice is engendered in the practice     of these professions among their own people. They do not     understand why they have been made to toil at starvation wages     and to pay heavy fines and suffer long prison sentences for     stealing food and clothing. They do not understand why no     estimate is placed upon negro virtue and the full rights of     citizenship are denied to negroes of education, character and     worth. If some mysterious _Providence_ has ordained that     they support themselves and employers by farming, they do not     understand why they are deprived of agricultural schools.     They do not see why mere prejudice would prevent them from     obtaining a square deal when contending for the possessions     of life, liberty and property. They do not understand why they     are not protected from petty peace officers in search of     fees and from mobs while in the hands of officers of the law.     Finally, they do not understand why there is so little genuine     sympathy and brotherhood between them and the only people they     know--the people whose language and customs they use, under     whose laws they live, whose Bible they read, whose God they     serve. These thoughts possessed the negroes' mind when, twelve     months ago, the boll weevil and rains destroyed the crops in     the South and the European war was calling foreigners from     field and factory in the North.[30]  One should bear in mind that the two generations of negroes living in the South are affected differently by the measures of control of the whites, and in many cases respond differently to treatment received. The older generation of whites and blacks avoided much friction by a sort of mutual understanding. The children of colored and white parents come less frequently into friendly contact and find it difficult to live together on the terms accepted by their fathers. Negro parents appreciate this situation but, although admitting that they can tolerate the position to which they are assigned, they do not welcome such an arrangement for their children. For this reason they are not reluctant to send their sons away from home. Should the children remain there, they live in a state of anxiety for their safety. They would not have them grow up as they, encompassed by restraints, and the young men themselves appear to entertain toward the prevailing system a more aggressive hostility.  A woman of color in Greenville, Mississippi, for example, had a son in a northern State and was afraid to invite him home to pay a visit because, as she stated, \"for him to accept the same abuses to which we, his parents, are accustomed, would make him much less than the man we would have him be.\" Another negro, a physician, the \"Nestor\" of his profession, having practiced in his State over thirty-five years, said:      Sir, I can't expect my son to accept the treatment under which     I have been brought up. My length of residence here and     the number of friends whom I know of the older and more     aristocratic type of whites will protect me but as for him,     there is no friendship. Now, as for me, there is no reason why     I should leave. I am making as much money as I could anywhere     else and all of the white people respect me. But I am just one     out of a thousand. The younger men have neither my contact nor     influence.  A lawyer of remarkable talent formerly of Mississippi, now living with his children in Chicago, who had felt keenly this humiliation and recognized it as one of the motives behind his change of residence, thus stated the situation:      One peculiar phase of the white southern"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29501"],["title","Negro Migration during the War (#5)"],["body"," is that     no matter how well liked or popular a colored man be in any     community, his son does not share that popularity unless he     enters a field of endeavor distinctly lower in the scale than     that occupied by his parent. My experience goes both ways on     this subject. My stepfather was a dearly beloved colored man     of the old school, but when he sent me off to Oberlin College     I returned to find that the community in which I had been     beloved as a boy in attendance at the rude country school     looked at me askance. It took twenty years to overcome the     handicap of attempting to occupy a higher sphere than that     to which the community thought it right to assign me. My     experiences were repeated by my son. He was a well liked boy     by the best people in a city of about twenty-five thousand,     because he was my son and was polite and agreeable. When he     went to a nearby Mississippi college and worked in his summer     vacations in a local industrial plant, they still thought well     of him, but when it was learned that he was being graduated     at Oberlin College, and his picture appeared in a college year     book, among others, my intimate white friends wanted to know     the necessity for so much education and, with a shrug of     the shoulder, they let all mention of him drop, as if he had     offended the most sacred laws of the community. This spirit     appeared so marked that I did not have him come back to visit     his mother and me during the summer vacation. I have seen the     same spirit in many instances. No man can explain why it is,     but it is so.[31]  [Footnote 17: _New York Times_, September 5, 9, 28, 1916.]  [Footnote 18: Ibid., October 18, 28; November 5, 7, 12, 15; December 4, 9, 1916.]  [Footnote 19: Work, _Report on Negro Migration from Alabama_.]  [Footnote 20: Work and Johnson, _Report on the Migration during the World War_.]  [Footnote 21: Attractive advertisements appeared in negro newspapers with wide circulation in the South.

There are seven white and two colored schools. The average salaries paid to white assistant teachers is $75 per month. The average salaries paid to colored assistant teachers is $32.50 per month. The average number of pupils taught by white is 30 and the average number taught by colored is 100.  In the county there are no agricultural high schools or in fact high schools of any kind. The whites in the same county have an agricultural high school of \"magnificent proportions\" and \"excellent facilities,\" a literary high school and about ten consolidated schools.  Negroes complain that the authorities are building white schools in communities where the negro population is five times as great. When they first sought to establish these consolidated schools, there was a provision that every one must pay taxes to support them. Negroes who were required to pay large taxes refused because they were denied the benefits of the schools. A law was passed with the provision that the majority of qualified electors in a county supervisor's district might secure one of these schools on petition to the Board of Supervisors and with the understanding that they would pay taxes. But negroes are not qualified electors and consequently have no schools.  In Liberty Grove the white school goes to the twelfth grade, with courses also in music. Automobiles bring the children to school and carry them back. The negro school in the same community has only one teacher getting $25 per month and teaching over 200 children. There are two large negro denominational schools, Jackson College and Campbell College which serve to supplement the public schools provided by the city.]  [Footnote 23: Jones, _Negro Education_, vol.

Johnson reports the following from Mississippi: \"The police of most of the cities are rough and indiscriminate in their treatment of negroes. At the depot during the summer, on several occasions, negro porters were severely beaten by policemen for trivial reasons. This, it was said, started a stream of young men that cleaned the town of porters.  \"Fee constables made their living from arresting negroes, indiscriminately, on trivial charges. A white man, to whom a prominent negro physician had gone for advice on a case concerning his arrest on a charge of having no lights on his automobile, said, 'If I were a negro, I would rather appear before a Russian court than come before a court here for trial.'\"]  [Footnote 30: Work and Johnson, _Report on the Migration during the World War_.]  [Footnote 31: Work and Johnson, _Report on the Migration during the World War_.]     CHAPTER III  STIMULATION OF THE MOVEMENT   It is not surprising that the exodus grew so contagious when viewed in the light of the numerous factors which played a part in influencing its extension. Considering the temper of the South and its attitude toward any attempt to reduce its labor supply, it is readily apparent that leaders who openly encouraged the exodus would be in personal danger. There were, of course, some few who did venture to voice their belief in it, but they were in most cases speedily silenced. A Methodist minister was sent to jail because he was said to have been enticing laborers to go north and work for a New York firm, which would give employment to fifty of his people. The tactics adopted by influential persons who favored the movement, therefore, were of necessity covert and very much guarded.  One of the chief stimuli was discussion. The very fact that negroes were leaving in large numbers was a disturbing factor. The talk in the barber shops and grocery stores where men were wont to assemble soon began to take the form of reasons for leaving. There it was the custom to review all the instances of mistreatment and injustice which fell to the lot of the negro in the South. It was here also that letters from the North were read and fresh news on the exodus was first given out. In Hattiesburg, Mississippi, it was stated that for a while there was no subject of discussion but the migration. \"The packing houses in Chicago for a while seemed to be everything,\" said one negro. \"You could not rest in your bed at night for Chicago.\" Chicago came to be so common a word that they began to call it \"Chi.\" Men went down to talk with the Chicago porters on the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad which ran through the town. They asked questions about the weather in Chicago. The report was that it was the same as in Hattiesburg.[32]  In every circle the advisability of leaving was debated. In the churches the pastors, seeing their flocks leaving, at first attempted to dissuade them. The people refused to come to church. In the church meetings there were verbal clashes on the matter of the attitude toward the migration. Some few had been careful enough to go north and investigate for themselves and friends.
