Pah, what barbarous names you Earthmen have.\" He shoved the giant back heavily into his seat, and turned his baleful glare upon Hilary.  \"You, what do you know about this?\"  Grim Morgan interposed hastily. \"Nothing, Magnificent. He came on the express conveyor after I did.\"  The guard's free hand went back. Very deliberately he struck him across the face with three ridged fingers. An angry welt raised.  \"That will teach you to keep your mouth shut when not spoken to.\"  The big man's eyes were mild, but his hands tensed as though they were curled around a throat. He said nothing.  The guard turned to Hilary again. \"Answer me,\" he barked.  \"My friend told the truth,\" Grendon said simply.  \"Your tag?\"  \"I have none.\"  Suspicion flared openly in the pink eyes.  \"Where is it?\"  \"I never had one.\"  \"Ah!\" There was a world of meaning to the exhalation. \"You know of course that every Earthman must be registered. The penalty for non-obedience is--death.\"  The angled tube came up with the swiftness of light. Grim Morgan cried out sharply, lunged out of his seat. Hilary tore at his gun, knowing sickeningly that the draw would be slower than the action of the strange weapon in the guard's hand.  There was a sneer on the monster as he pressed something on the tube. Hilary's automatic was only half out of his blouse. Grim's lunge would never reach in time. He was too far away.     CHAPTER III  _The Death of Amos Peabody_   Just how any inkling of what was happening penetrated the pain-swept consciousness of the blind and deaf President could never be determined. Possibly a thin repercussion of Grim's cry, possibly an intuition that comes to sense-bereft men. But he had jerked spasmodically erect. There was a sharp tinkling as the weakened leg links broke. He threw himself in a queer, awkward movement forward, directly in the path of the tubed weapon. A blinding beam flashed out of the orifice, sheared through Peabody's middle as though he were cut cleanly in half with a gigantic knife. He toppled in two sections to the floor of the conveyor--released from all humiliation, all suffering.  At the same time two other things happened. Grim Morgan hit the guard like a crashing thunderbolt and Hilary's gun barked once. The monster tottered under the impact. A puzzled expression flitted over his pinkish eyes, a filmy sheath spread over them like a veil, and he fell heavily, a neat bullet hole square between his eyes.  Hilary shoved the gun back in his blouse, and stared alternately at the huddled form of the grotesque being and all that remained of Amos Peabody. The old President had saved his life at the cost of his own. Instinctively his hand went up in formal salute to the gallant old man.  Grim Morgan shook him by the shoulder.  \"Man,\" he said quietly, \"we have killed a Mercutian guard. Within the hour we shall be dead men too.\"  Hilary looked up at him sharply.  \"A Mercutian,\" he echoed. \"You mean--\"  \"That for three years now the Earth has been a conquered province of these devils from Mercury,\" Grim interposed swiftly. \"We have committed the unforgivable offense and must pay for it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Hilary glanced swiftly around. The express conveyor was clear of passengers for over a hundred yards each way. All the people within range had cleared off when Hilary had attempted to release Peabody. The small figure of a man got up from his chair beyond the charmed circle, and was threading his way forward. The local conveyors seemed to be moving backward at graded speeds. Beyond was the open country, gradually thickening into scattered rows of crystal buildings. They were in the suburbs of Great New York. Within ten minutes the conveyor terminal would be reached.  Hilary's eyes flicked speculatively to the tiny cigar-shaped boat in which the dead guard had flown down to them. Its smooth gray-gleaming surface was devoid of wings or other lifting devices. Only a fan-shaped fin projected from the stern like the tail of a fish. The cockpit, if such it could be called, was tiny, just ample enough to accommodate the Mercutian's girth. The sunlight dazzled back from a bewildering jumble of tiny lenses inset in the instrument board. Arranged along the hull, on either side, were larger disks of the same quartz-like material.  \"Let's get away in the flier,\" he said.  \"Can't,\" Grim said. \"Those lenses you see on the instrument board are the controls. No one knows how to operate them except the Mercutians. Our people managed to capture a few, but couldn't do a thing with them.\"  Hilary stared at the motionless flier with interest. \"What are those round glass disks stretched along the hull in a double row?\" he asked. \"They look like burning glasses.\"  \"That's just what they are,\" said Grim sadly. \"The top row are sun-lenses, that throw a terrible ray for a distance of two to three hundred feet. Melts everything in its path--men trees, rocks even. You saw one in action in the sun-tube with which poor old Peabody was cut in half. The lower row of lenses on the flier are search beams.\"  \"Search beams?\" Hilary echoed inquiringly.  \"Yes. They act like X-rays, more powerful though, and with the further property of rendering everything they touch transparently crystal for depths of ten to fifteen feet. Lead is the only element they can not penetrate. Another secret our scientists can not fathom, so they talk learnedly about the stream of rays polarizing the structure of matter along a uniaxis.\"  \"Can't those lenses be duplicated, and turned as weapons against the Mercutians?\"  \"No. They are made of a peculiar vitreous material native to Mercury.\"  \"And no one has found out the principle on which they work?\"  \"Well, there have been theories. We haven't many scientists left, you know. But the most popular one is that these lenses have the power of concentrating the rays of the sun to an almost infinite degree, and then spreading them out again, each individual beam with the concentrated energy of the whole. Some new way of rearranging quanta of energy.\"  \"Hmm!\" Hilary's brow was wrinkled. For a long moment he stared and thought.         *       *       *       *       *  At last he snapped back to their present situation: the dead guard at their feet, the dismembered body of Amos Peabody, the cowed groups of Earthmen on the speeding conveyors, keeping respectful distances.  \"We'd better start moving if we want to get away,\" he said.  \"It's no use.\" Grim spread his hands resignedly. \"We'll have to take our medicine.\"  Hilary flared angrily. \"You're talking nonsense. What's to prevent us from hopping to another platform? There is no other Mercutian in sight.\"  \"No, but there were plenty of Earthmen who saw us.\"  \"They won't tell.\"  \"Oh, won't they?\" Grim shook his head quietly. \"You don't realize what has happened. Their spirit has been crushed until they are actually slavish in soul as well as in body. They fought bravely enough on the first invasion. Even after the conquest there were plenty of men looking for an opportunity to fight them again. Amos Peabody headed the revolt. It was smothered in blood, so effectually that only slaves are left. Peabody was left as a horrible warning. He was sent from city to city to be exhibited to the populace, unattended on the way, so confident were the Mercutians of the terror they had inspired.\"  \"So you think those Earthmen who saw us will report to their masters,\" Hilary said slowly.  Grim nodded.  \"I know it--they'll expect to curry favor in return.\"  Hilary felt a web of circumstance tighten around him. His jaw tautened. Thank the Lord he had been away--on his own. He had not the soul of a slave--yet.  \"Won't you fight for your life?\" he asked the big man curiously.  A spark lit in the mild blue eyes, died down.  \"Yes if there were a chance,\" he said dully. \"But there is none. The whole Earth is honeycombed with their guards. They have fliers, sun weapons, invisible search beams. We'd never elude them.\"  Hilary snorted impatiently. \"We have good Earth brains, haven't we? I've traveled all the outer planets and never met any intelligence equal to that of a man, and I won't admit for a moment that the Mercutians are any exceptions.\"  A man stepped casually onto the express, took one startled look at the dead guard, at them, and fled precipitately back.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Another one to spread the alarm,\" Morgan said grimly. \"There'll be a dozen guards dropping down on us in the next five minutes.\"  \"Let's get going then.\" Hilary was pulling the big man along by main force when he heard a movement in back of them. He stopped, whirled, automatic thrusting its blue nose forward.  The little man who had gotten up before on the express was pushing rapidly toward them.  \"Stop.\" Hilary's voice was harsh with command.  But the little man did not heed. He literally stumbled in his haste, crying: \"You've killed a Mercutian.\"  \"What of it, my bantam?\" Hilary inquired softly, the muzzle of his gun boring into a lean flat stomach. The little man was actually pressing against the automatic in his excitement.  \"What of it?\" he shrilled excitedly. \"God, all this time I've been waiting to find someone with guts enough to smash one of them. Sir, I'm proud to shake your hand.\"  He reached over the wicked-looking muzzle, gripped Hilary's fist, still tight on the gun butt, and pumped vigorously. He dropped the hand, swerved on Grim.  \"And you too, sir.\" His little fingers were engulfed in a mighty paw. \"I saw it all, I tell you,\" he babbled. \"We've got them on the run. We'll sweep the filthy devils clean off the Earth. We'll annihilate them.\"  \"Whoa there, my little gamecock.\" Morgan grinned down at the excited little man. \"One Mercutian doesn't make a Roman holiday. They're plenty more where he came from. You'd better clear out before they come, or you'll be included in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29966"],["title","Slaves of Mercury (#3)"],["body","rty.\"  The little fellow--he was not much more than five feet no inches tall--drew himself up to his full height. \"What,\" he ejaculated, \"me desert my friends? Wat Tyler's never had that said of him yet. We stick together, to hell and back again.\"  Hilary grinned as he slipped the weapon back into his blouse. He was beginning to like this little firebrand. In truth, Grim had rather fairly described him as a gamecock. His stature, the bristly red hair that flamed above a freckled face, the lightest of blue eyes that snapped with excitement, the peculiar strut of him.  \"You'll do,\" he said briefly.         *       *       *       *       *  At a safe distance a crowd was gathering, a crowd of Earthmen. Grim surveyed them carefully. They were milling back and forth, but no one dared come closer. \"Slaves,\" he grunted, \"not a spark left in them.\" His eyes swept the heavens. Two faint black specks appeared in the blue distance, from the direction of Great New York.  \"They're coming for us,\" he said quietly.  \"Let them,\" crowed the fiery little bantam, \"we'll meet them man to man.\"  He wrenched the tube from the stiffened fingers of the dead guard, swung it exultingly aloft.  \"You little fool,\" Hilary cried sharply, and struck it down again. \"We're not waiting for them. That's suicide. Come. I'm afraid it's too late for you to turn back now. You've been seen with us.\"  He dashed across the moving belts, Grim and Wat, a grotesquely assorted pair, directly behind him.  Passengers, men and women both, scattered at their approach, stark, servile fear smothering their dulled countenances. Cries arose on all sides. \"The Magnificents are coming.\"  The black specks became larger, forming themselves into swift one-man fliers. The three men pelted across the graded conveyors as hard as they could run. No Earthman tried to stop them; one look at their grim faces would have been a most potent dissuader. And fortunately there were no Mercutians within hailing distance other than the rapidly nearing fliers.  They flung themselves off the last slow-moving platform, panting.  \"Which way now?\" Hilary asked. His quick eye raked the scene for possible hideouts. They were on a smoothly clipped lawn, heaving gently up to a pretty rambling structure, built on an antique design, pleasingly irregular and nestling to the ground as though it were indigenous to the soil. The walls were modern, though, of vita-crystal, which possessed the peculiar property of permitting _all_ of the beneficial rays of the sun to penetrate, and yet presented a perfectly opaque appearance to the outside world.  No other hiding place was in sight. The lawn stretched smooth on all sides except for a scattering of trees--poor enough cover. The Mercutians were almost directly overhead now, preparing to swoop.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Our only chance seems to be the house,\" Hilary answered his own question quietly.  Grim shook his head. \"Their search beams can penetrate the vita-crystal walls as though they were transparent glass.\"  Hilary's heart sank. \"Can't help it,\" he said laconically. \"Come on.\"  The three men broke into a run. It was only a hundred yards, but the Mercutians were coming down fast. They had been seen. A flash as of molten metal gleamed overhead. A blinding ray leaped for the ground, struck viciously a little ahead of the running men. The velvet green grass crisped to ash; the soil underneath scorched.  \"Scatter!\" Hilary shouted.  Instantly the men spread out. Another blast hissed down at them, so close to Hilary that the heat seared his left side like a red-hot iron. The Mercutians were getting the range. Wat Tyler stopped short with a howl of defiance. He whipped the hand tube he had taken from the dead guard out of his blouse.  \"Hide it, you fool!\" Hilary yelled back at him. \"We don't want them to known we are armed.\"  Wat obeyed reluctantly. He shook his fist high in the air, and started to run again. It was not an instant too soon, either. A beam slithered down the smoldering air, and the Earth literally boiled under its impact, directly on the spot where Wat had stopped to shake his fist. All about them the terrible rays were slashing now.  But a last desperate burst of speed carried the Earthmen onto a wide enclosed portico, in the old manner. Hilary pounded on the vita-crystal door. It was tightly locked.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Step back a moment,\" Morgan rumbled.  Hilary obeyed. The big man spat thoughtfully upon his hands, worked his shoulders tentatively. Then he too retreated to the outermost edge of the portico. Above, the crystal suddenly shattered. Sharp-edged fragments showered down upon them. There was little time to waste.  Grim heaved forward in a slanting rush, right shoulder extended. He crashed into the locked door like a runaway train. There was a grinding noise, a smash of crystal, and his shoulder was through, incased in a halo of bright, sharp edges.  The big man staggered back, his shoulder streaming blood from a hundred cuts. His face was pale and drawn.  \"Good fellow,\" Wat yelled, \"even though you are an overgrown ox.\" He darted in behind the man-mountain like a twisting snake. His deft fingers reached in through the shattered crystal, pressed something on the inside. The door slid into its wall pocket with a sound of grinding glass.  Wat burst into the opened room first, Grim right behind him. Hilary brought up the rear, Grim's great bulk blotting out for the moment any view of the interior.  There was a sudden gasp--a girl's voice.  \"Wh--What does this mean?\" She was tremulous, yet unafraid.  Hilary stopped suddenly as though brought up against a solid wall. His heart pounded madly. That voice--but it was utterly impossible!  Wat answered, gallantly. \"Sorry to annoy you, miss, but they're after us. My partner here's wounded.\"  \"Oh, you poor man.\" There was quick sympathy in the clear tones. \"But who is after you?\"  A splintering crash resounded outside.  \"The Mercutians, as you no doubt hear,\" the little man responded with faint irony.  The girl gasped again. \"Oh my God!\"  There was silence. Hilary strained his ears, yet took care to keep hidden behind Grim's huge frame. What would she do now? It seemed to him as if the whole world depended on her reply.  The girl broke the silence. She had come to a swift decision.  \"They must not get you. Go upstairs, quietly, into the chamber on the left of the hall. It's my bedroom. Their search beams can not penetrate it; the walls are draped with lead-encrusted curtains. I'll stay down here and try to throw them off the trail.\"  Hilary's heart recommenced beating. A gush of joy overwhelmed him. The girl had proven herself.  Grim spoke, for the first time.  \"You know the penalty of course, for hiding us.\"  She did not answer directly. \"I can't help it. I can't surrender Earthmen to those beasts. Besides\"--there was a catch in her voice--\"it does not matter much since--\"  Hilary stepped quietly from behind Grim's overshadowing bulk.  The girl's eyes went wide at the sight of him; her slender white hand flew to her throat. She looked as if she had seen a ghost.  \"You--you!\" she choked. \"Hilary!\"         *       *       *       *       *  She swayed and would have fallen, had Hilary not jumped to catch her. His heart was beating thickly with excess of emotion. Joan Robbins in his arms again--how he prayed for this moment in the icy reaches of interplanetary space. Yet what was she doing here in Bronxville? Her home had always been atop the windswept Robbins Building in Great New York.  Her hand went softly over his features, as though to assure herself that it was really he.  \"Oh, my dear,\" she whispered brokenly. \"I had almost given up all hope. Everyone was certain you were lost--long ago.\"  Whirrings sounded outside.  \"Sorry to break up your reunion,\" Grim interrupted in his bass rumble, \"but the Mercutians have landed on the lawn. They'll be in here right away.\"  Joan tore herself out of Hilary's arms. Her slim straight figure tautened; her velvet soft eyebrows puckered over deep-lit pools.  \"Upstairs quickly, all of you,\" she cried. \"I'll manage them somehow.\"  Hilary said quietly, \"I won't leave you alone with those brutes. You go along up, and I'll remain here.\" The automatic gleamed in his hand.  \"No, no,\" she panted, \"you mustn't. You wouldn't have a chance. Leave it to me.\" She literally pushed them with her little hands to the stairway. \"Go, if you love me.\"  \"The girl's right,\" Grim said, \"there's a chance. If not,\" he shrugged his shoulders, \"we can always come down again.\"  Outside were heavy thuddings on the portico.  \"You in there,\" a heavy alien voice resounded, \"open or we blast our way in.\" The door had been slid back into position.  There was no room for further argument. Very reluctantly Hilary followed his companions up the winding stairway.  At the top of the stairs an entrance slide showed darker on the left. Wat fumbled for a moment until he found the button. The door whirred open, even as they heard Joan's clear voice below: \"Come in, Magnificents!\" There was a trampling of feet.     CHAPTER IV  _The Kidnapping of Joan_   The Earthmen moved quickly and quietly into Joan's room. Thin, crinkly draperies of heavy silk impregnated with lead in colloidal solution, covered all the walls, the door itself. But Hilary shot no more than a cursory glance around; he had left the slide slightly ajar; he was listening intently. The gun was in his hand. There were only two bullets in the chambers--all that were left of the thousands of rounds the expedition had started out with. He must not waste them.  The thick rough voice of a Mercutian floated up from below.  \"Three Earth slaves came in here. Where did they go?\"  \"They did,\" Joan admitted readily. \"They frightened me out of my wits. I screamed and they ran through the house and out the back way.\"  The Mercutian was suspicious.  \"Hmm. Funny there's no sign of a struggle here."]]]
