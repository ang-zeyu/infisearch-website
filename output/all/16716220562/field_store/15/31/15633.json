But even a fugitive may have friends--if he has been a master pilot and has a lean, likable face with a most disarming grin.  Where would he go? He did not know; he had been bluffing a bit and the Commander had called him when his hand was weak; he had no least idea where he could find their ship. If only he had had a chance for a word with Walt Harkness: Walt had been flying it; he had left it apparently in a storage hangar.  But where? And what was it that Walt had called out? Chet was racking his brains to remember.  \"The ship is yours,\" Walt had shouted ... and something about \"storage.\" But why should he have laid up the ship; why should he have stored it?  Chet saw the lights of subterranean stations flashing past as the car that held him rode silently through a tube that it touched not at all. He knew that magnetic rails made a grillwork that surrounded the car and that drew it on at terrific speed while suspending it in air. But he would infinitely have preferred the freedom of the high levels, and his own hand on a ship's controls.  A ship!--any ship!--but preferably his ship and Walt's. And Walt had said something of \"_storage--cold storage_.\" The words seemed written before him in fiery lines. It was a moment before he knew what he had recalled. Then a slow smile tugged at the corners of his mouth, and he turned and stared through a window that showed only blackness.  \"_Cold storage!_\" That was good work on Walt's part. He had been forced to shout the directions before them all, yet tell none of those others about him where the ship was hidden. Chet was picturing that place of \"cold storage\" as he smiled. The fact that it was some thousands of miles away troubled him not at all.         *       *       *       *       *  The great Hoover Terminal was a place where night never came. Its daylight tubes wove a network of light about the stupendous enclosure, their almost silent hissing merged to an unceasing rush of sound, so soft as to be unheard through the scuffing feet and chattering voices of the ever-hurrying crowds.  From subways the impatient people came and went, and from highway stations where busses and private cars drove in and away. The clock in the squat tower swung its electrically driven hands toward the figure 22; there lacked but two hours of midnight, and a steady stream of aircraft came dropping down the shaft of green light that reached to and through the clouds. There would be many liners leaving on the hour; these that were coming in were private craft that spun their flashing helicopters like giant emeralds in the green descending light, while the noise of their beating blades filled the air with a rush of sound.  Outside the entrance to the Passenger Station, Chet Bullard withdrew himself from the surging press of hurrying men and women and slipped into a shadowed alcove. Two passing figures in the gray and gold of the Air Patrol scanned the crowd closely; Chet drew himself into the deeper shadows and waited until they were by before he emerged and followed the shelter of a coffee-house that extended toward another entrance to the field, where pilots and mechanics passed in and out.         *       *       *       *       *  A bulletin board showed in changing letters of light the official assignment of landing space. And, though every passing eye was turned toward it, Chet knew that each man was intent upon the board and not on the shadowed niche in the building behind it. He watched his chance and slipped into that shadow.  Unseen, he could see them as they approached: men in the multicolored uniforms of many lines, who paused to read, to exchange bantering shop-talk--and to pass on.  Many voices: \"Storm area, over the South-shore up to Level Six. You birds on the local runs had better watch your step\" ... \"--coming down at Calcutta. Yeah, a dirty, red-bottomed freighter that rammed him. I saw it take off two of his fans, but Shorty set the old girl down like a feather on the lift of the four fans he had left. You said it--Shorty's a real pilot....\"  Another pause; then a growling voice that proclaimed complainingly: \"Lord, but I'm tired! All right, Spud; grin, you damned Irishman! But if you had been hauling the Commander all over Alaska to-day and then got ordered out again just as you were set for a good sleep, you'd be sore. What in thunder does he want his ship for to-night, I ask you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Chet, crouching still lower in the little retreat, stiffened to attention at the reference to the Commander. So the \"big boss\" had ordered out his own cruiser again! He listened still more intently to the voice that replied.  \"Sure, and it's thankful you sh'u'd be to be holdin' the controls on a fine, big cruiser like that; though, betwixt you and me, 'tis myself that don't envy you your job. Me and my old freighter, we go wallowin' along. And to-night I'm takin' her home for repairs--back to the fact'ry in Rooshia where they made her; and the devil of a job it will be, for she handles with all the grace of a pig in a puddle.\"  Chet risked a glance when the sound of heavy footsteps indicated that one of the two speakers had gone on alone to the pilots' gate. Before the huge bulletin board, in pilot's uniform and with the markings of a low-level man on his sleeve, stood the sturdy figure of the man called Spud. He started back at sight of the face peering out at him, but Chet whispered a command, and the man moved closer to the hiding place behind the board.  There were others coming in a laughing group up the walk; daylight tubes illuminated the approach. Chet spoke hurriedly.  \"I'm in a devil of a mess, Spud. Will you lend a hand? Will you stand by for rescue work?\"  And Spud studied the bulletin board as he growled:  \"Lend a hand?--yes, and the arm with it, Mr. Bullard. You stud by me once whin I needed help; and now you ask will I stand by for rescue work. Till we crash--that's all, me bhoy!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Spud's speech was tinged with the brogue of Erin; it grew perceptibly more pronounced as his quick emotions took hold of him.  \"Quiet!\" said Chet. \"Wait till they pass!\"  The newcomers stopped for no more than a glance. Then:  \"I'm demoted,\" Chet told the round-eyed man who stared unbelievingly at the vacant place on Chet's blouse. \"The air's hot with orders for my arrest. I've got to get out, and I've got to do it quick.\"  And now there was only a trace of the brogue in Spud's voice. Chet knew the trick of the man's speech; touch his heart and his tongue would grow thick; place him face to face with an emergency and he would go cold and hard, while the good-natured phrasing of his native sod went from him and he talked fast and straight.  \"The devil you say!\" exclaimed Spud. \"What you've done I don't know, nor yet why you did it. But, whatever it was, I don't believe you let that triple star go for less than a damned good reason. Now, let me think; let--me--think--\"  A figure in gray and gold was approaching, a member of the Air Patrol. Spud's tongue was lively with good-natured raillery as he fell into step and drew the officer with him through the pilots' gate, while Chet, from his shadow, saw with satisfaction the apparent desertion. He had known Spud O'Malley of old. Spud was square--and Spud had wanted time for thinking.  There were many who passed Chet's hiding place before a cautious whisper came to him and he saw a hand that thrust a roll of clothing around the edge of the bulletin board.  \"Put 'em on!\" was the order of Spud. \"And smear your yellah hair with the grease! Work fast, me bhoy!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The command was no less imperative for being spoken beneath Spud's breath, and for the first time Chet's hopes soared high within him. It had all been so hopeless, the prospect of actual escape from the net that was closing about him. And now--!  He unrolled the tight package of cloth to find a small can of black graphite lubricant done up in a jacket and blouse. Both were stained and smeared with grease; they were amply large. Chet did not bother to strip off his own blouse; he pulled on the other clothes over his own, and his face was alight with a grin of appreciation of Spud's attention to details as he took a daub of the grease, rubbed it on his hands, then passed them through his hair.  \"Yellah,\" Spud had said, but the description was no longer apt. And the man who stepped forth beside Spud O'Malley in the uniform of an engineer of a tramp freighter looked like nothing else in the world but just that.  \"Come on, now!\" ordered Spud harshly, as a figure in gray and gold appeared around the corner of the coffee shop. \"You're plinty late, me fine lad! Now get in there and clean up that dirty motor and get her runnin'! Try out every fan on the old boat; then we'll be off.  \"You're number CG41!\" he whispered. And Chet repeated the number as he followed the pilot through the gate.  \"O.K.,\" said the guard at the gate, \"and I'll bet he gives you hell and to spare!\"  Chet slouched his shoulders to disguise his real height and followed where Spud O'Malley, with every indication of righteous anger, strode indignantly down the pavement, at the far end of which was a battered and service-stained ship.         *       *       *       *       *  Her hull of dirty red showed mottlings of brown; she was sadly in need of a painter's gun. She would groan and squeal, Chet knew, when the fans lifted her from the hold-down clutch; and she couldn't fly at over twenty thousand without leaking her internal pressure through a thousand cracks that made her porous as an old balloon--but to Chet's eyes the old relic of the years was a thing of sheer beauty and grace.  O'Malley was leading through an open freight hatch; Chet followed, and, at his beckoning hand, slipped into a dingy cabin.  \"Lay low"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29717"],["title","The Finding of Haldgren (#3)"],["body","ere,\" the pilot ordered, and still, as Chet observed, his speech showed how clearly the man was thinking, since the emergency still existed \"I've cleared some time ago, Mr. Bullard; we're ready to leave as soon as we get the dispatcher's O.K.\"  The minutes were long where Chet waited in the pilot's cabin. Each sound might mean a last-minute search of departing ships, but he tried to tell himself that the attention of the officers would be centered upon the passenger liners.  Beyond, where he could see out into the control room, a white light flashed. He heard the bellowing orders of the Irishman at the controls. And, as other sounds reached his ears, he had to grip his hands hard while he fought for control of the laughter that was almost hysterical. For, beneath him, he felt the sluggish lift of the ship, and, from every joint and plate of this old-timer of the air, came squawking protests against the cruel fates that drove her forth again to face the buffeting, racking gales.  But the blue light of an ascending area was about them, and Spud O'Malley was shouting from the control room:  \"Sure, and we're off, Mr. Bullard. Now do ye come up here and tell me all about it--but I warn you, I'll not be believin' a word--\"     CHAPTER III  _Up From Earth_   Chet had plenty of time in which to acquaint Pilot O'Malley with the facts. And, when he had told his story, it did his sick and worried mind good to hear the explosive stream of expletives that came from the other's lips. Yet, despite the Irishman's anger, it was noticeable that he closed the tight door of the control room before he said a word.  \"Only a skeleton crew,\" he explained. \"Just the relief pilot and the engineers and a man or two in the galley, and I trust 'em all. But you can't be too careful.  \"The Commander,\" he concluded, \"is gettin' to be more an emperor than a Commander, and somethin's got to be done. Discipline we must have, 'tis true; but this kotowin' to His Royal Highness and all o' that--devil a bit do I like it! If only you could show him up, Mr. Bullard--but of course you can't.\"  \"I'm not so sure,\" Chet responded. \"What I told the big boss wasn't all bluff. Haldgren _did_ go out, five years ago this month. We have the record of a Crescent liner's captain who saw Haldgren's little ship shoot through the R.A. and go on out as if it were going somewhere. And now we have these flashes!  \"Do you see what that means, Spud? An SOS! Nobody but an Earth-man would send that, and we wouldn't do it now. We would just press the lever of our emergency-call, and every receiver within a thousand miles would pick up the scream of it.  \"But we've had this Dunston Emergency Transmitter less than four years. Haldgren knew only the old S O S. And remember this: three dots, three dashes and three dots don't just happen. They showed up on the Moon. They were repeated the next night. _Somebody sent them!_ Who was it?\"         *       *       *       *       *  And Pilot O'Malley gave the only obvious answer:  \"There's only yourself and Mr. Harkness and Pilot Haldgren that could have got there. 'Twas Haldgren, of course! What a pity that you can't go; 'tis likely the poor bhoy needs help.\"  \"Five years!\" mused Chet. \"Five long years since he left! He must have landed safely--and then what? After five years comes a signal and that signal a call for help that no pilot worthy the name would disregard....  \"Where are we bound?\" he demanded abruptly.  \"Rooshia,\" said O'Malley. \"I disremember the name--'tis on my orders--but I know it's a long way up north.\"  \"Spud,\" said Chet, \"you're a rotten pilot; you're one of the worst I ever knew. Careless--that's your worst fault--and if anybody doubts that they'll believe it after this trip. For, Spud, if you're any friend of mine, and I know you are, you're going to lose your bearings, and kick this old sky-hog a long way beyond that factory she is bound for. And you're going to set me down in a God-forsaken spot in the arctic where I'm pretty sure I'll find a ship waiting for me.  \"And, if you just stick around for a while after that, you will see me take off for the Moon. Then, if Haldgren is there--\"  Chet failed to finish the sentence; he was staring through a rear lookout, where, over the arc of the Earth's horizon, could be seen a thin crescent Moon; about it drifting clouds made a halo.  The eyes of Spud O'Malley followed Chet's, and his imaginative faculties must have been stimulated by Chet's words, for he gazed open-mouthed, as if for the first time he visioned that golden scimitar as something more substantial than a high-hung light. He drew one long incredulous breath before he answered.  \"What position, sir? Say the word and I'll lose myself so bad we'll be over the Pole and half-way to the equator again!\"  \"Not that bad,\" was Chet's assurance. \"Just spot this ship over 82:14 north, 93:20 east, and I'll give you local bearings from there.\"  Then to himself: \"'Cold storage,' Walt said; he meant our old shop, of course. Probably had a hunch we would need it.\"  But to the pilot he said only the one word: \"Thanks!\"--though the grip of his hand must have spoken more eloquently.         *       *       *       *       *  The eastbound lanes of the five thousand level saw them plod slowly along, while faster and better-groomed ships slipped smoothly past; then the red hull rose to Level Twelve and swung out upon the great circle course that would bear them more nearly in the direction of the destination Chet had given. There were free levels higher up in which they could have laid a direct course, but the Irish pilot did not need Chet to tell him that the old hull would never stand it. Her internal pressure could never have been maintained at any density such as human lungs demanded.  But they were on their way, and Chet's customary genial expression gave place to one of more grim determination as he watched the white-flecked ocean drift slowly past below.  Once a patrol ship spoke to them. Daylight had come to show plainly the silver hull with the distinctive red markings of the Service that slipped smoothly down from above to hang poised under flashing fans like a giant humming-bird. Her directed radio beam flashed the yellow call signal in O'Malley's control room.         *       *       *       *       *  Chet was beside him, and the two exchanged silent glances before O'Malley cut in his transmitter. He must give name and number--this signal was a demand that could not be disregarded--but on the old freighter was no automatic sender that would flash the information across to the other ship; the pilot's voice must serve instead.  \"Number three--seven--G--four--two!\" he thundered into the radiophone. \"Freighter of the Intercolonial Line, without cargo--\"  \"For the love of Pete,\" shouted the loudspeaker beside him in volume to drown out the pilot's words, \"are you sending this by short wave, or are you just yelling across to me? Calm down, you Irish terrier!\"  Then, before the pilot could reply, the voice from the silver and red patrol ship dropped into an exaggerated mimicry of the O'Malley brogue--  \"And did yez say 'twas a freighter you had there? Sure, I thot at th' very last 'twas a foine big liner from the Orient and Transpolar run, dropped down here from the hoigh livils! All right, Spud; on your way! But don't crowd the bottom of the Twelve Level so close. This is O--sixteen--L; Jimmy Maddux. By--by! I'll report you O.K.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Again Chet looked at the pilot silently before he glanced back at the vanishing ship, already small in the distance. He repeated the Patrol Captain's words:  \"You will 'report us O.K.'--yes, Jimmy, you'll do that, and if they want to find us again you can tell them right where to look.\"  \"I'm pushin' her all I can, Mr. Bullard,\" said Spud. \"'Tis all she can do.... And now do ye go into my cabin--there's two berths there--and we'll just turn in and sleep while my relief man takes his turn. But go in before I call him; there's not a soul on the ship besides ourselves knows that you're here.\"  And, in the cabin a short time later, Pilot O'Malley chuckled as he whispered: \"I gave the lad his course. And Mac will follow it, but it'll niver take him near to the part of Rooshia he expects it to. Still, the record's clear as far as he's concerned; I've got it in the log. Mac's a good lad, and I wouldn't have him get into trouble over this.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the freighter's cabin the chronometer was again approaching the hour of twenty-two; for nearly twenty-four hours the ship had been on her plodding way. And, lacking the A.D.D.--the Automatic Destination Detector--and other refinements of instrumental installations of the passenger ships, Pilot O'Malley had to work out his position for himself.  And where a faster craft would have driven through with scarcely a quiver, the big ship trembled with the buffets and suction of a wintry blast that drove dry snow like sand across the lookout glasses. The twelve thousand level was an unbroken cloud of snow--a gray smother where the red ship's blunt and rusty bow nosed through.  O'Malley clung to the chart table as the air gave way beneath them and the ship fell a hundred feet or more before her racing fans took hold and jerked her back to an even keel. He managed to check his figures, then moved to the door of his cabin, opened it and called softly.  Chet was beside him in an instant. It had seemed best that he remain in hiding, and he knew what the pilot's call meant. \"Made it, did you!\" he exclaimed. \"Now I'll take a look about and pick up my bearing points.\"  But one look at the ports and he shook his head.  \"That's dirty,\" he told O'Malley, and his eyes twinkled as he felt the old ship rear and plunge with the lift of a driving gale; \"and how the old girl does feel it! She can't rip through, and she can't go above. You've had some trip, Spud; it's been mighty decent of you to go "]]]
