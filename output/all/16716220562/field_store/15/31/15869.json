I am an old man--I had forgotten!’ cried the chief.  ‘The words of the antelope were true words--my reward shall be my undoing--they are being fulfilled!’  Then the white men fell upon the people of Gopani-Kufa and slew them together with the chief and his daughter Shasasa; and since then all the power of the Earth has rested in the hands of the white men, for they have in their possession Sipao, the Magic Mirror.           Story of the King Who Would See                   Paradise    Once upon a time there was king who, one day out hunting, came upon a fakeer in a lonely place in the mountains.  The fakeer was seated on a little old bedstead reading the Koran, with his patched cloak thrown over his shoulders.  The king asked him what he was reading; and he said he was reading about Paradise, and praying that he might be worthy to enter there. Then they began to talk, and, by-and- bye, the king asked the fakeer if he could show him a glimpse of Paradise, for he found it very difficult to believe in what he could not see.  The fakeer replied that he was asking a very difficult, and perhaps a very dangerous, thing; but that he would pray for him, and perhaps he might be able to do it; only he warned the king both against the dangers of his unbelief, and against the curiosity which prompted him to ask this thing.  However, the king was not to be turned from his purpose, and he promised the fakeer always to provided him with food, if he, in return, would pray for him.  To this the fakeer agreed, and so they parted.  Time went on, and the king always sent the old fakeer his food according to his promise; but, whenever he sent to ask him when he was going to show him Paradise, the fakeer always replied: ‘Not yet, not yet!’  After a year or two had passed by, the king heard one day that the fakeer was very ill-- indeed, he was believed to be dying.  Instantly he hurried off himself, and found that it was really true, and that the fakeer was even then breathing his last.  There and then the king besought him to remember his promise, and to show him a glimpse of Paradise.  The dying fakeer replied that if the king would come to his funeral, and, when the grave was filled in, and everyone else was gone away, he would come and lay his hand upon the grave, he would keep his word, and show him a glimpse of Paradise.  At the same time he implored the king not to do this thing, but to be content to see Paradise when God called him there.  Still the king’s curiosity was so aroused that he would not give way.  Accordingly, after the fakeer was dead, and had been buried, he stayed behind when all the rest went away; and then, when he was quite alone, he stepped forward, and laid his hand upon the grave!  Instantly the ground opened, and the astonished king, peeping in, saw a flight of rough steps, and, at the bottom of them, the fakeer sitting, just as he used to sit, on his rickety bedstead, reading the Koran!  At first the king was so surprised and frightened that he could only stare; but the fakeer beckoned to him to come down, so, mustering up his courage, he boldly stepped down into the grave.  The fakeer rose, and, making a sign to the king to follow, walked a few paces along a dark passage.  Then he stopped, turned solemnly to his companion, and, with a movement of his hand, drew aside as it were a heavy curtain, and revealed--what?  No one knows what was there shown to the king, nor did he ever tell anyone; but, when the fakeer at length dropped the curtain, and the king turned to leave the place, he had had his glimpse of Paradise!  Trembling in every limb, he staggered back along the passage, and stumbled up the steps out of the tomb into the fresh air again.  The dawn was breaking.  It seemed odd to the king that he had been so long in the grave.  It appeared but a few minutes ago that he had descended, passed along a few steps to the place where he had peeped beyond the veil, and returned again after perhaps five minutes of that wonderful view!  And what WAS it he had seen?  He racked his brains to remember, but he could not call to mind a single thing!  How curious everything looked too!  Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him!  The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall.  It was full; and there upon the throne sat another king!  The poor king, all bewildered, sat down and stared about him.  Presently a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king’s presence.  ‘But I am the king!’ he cried.  ‘What king?’ said the chamberlain.  ‘The true king of this country,’ said he indignantly.  Then the chamberlain went away, and spoke to the king who sat on the throne, and the old king heard words like ‘mad,’ ‘age,’ ‘compassion.’ Then the king on the throne called him to come forward, and, as he went, he caught sight of himself reflected in the polished steel shield of the bodyguard, and started back in horror!  He was old, decrepit, dirty, and ragged!  His long white beard and locks were unkempt, and straggled all over his chest and shoulders.  Only one sign of royalty remained to him, and that was the signet ring upon his right hand.  He dragged it off with shaking fingers and held it up to the king.  ‘Tell me who I am,’ he cried; ‘there is my signet, who once sat where you sit--even yesterday!’  The king looked at him compassionately, and examined the signet with curiosity.  Then he commanded, and they brought out dusty records and archives of the kingdom, and old coins of previous reigns, and compared them faithfully.  At last the king turned to the old man, and said: ‘Old man, such a king as this whose signet thou hast, reigned seven hundred years ago; but he is said to have disappeared, none know whither; where got you the ring?’  Then the old man smote his breast, and cried out with a loud lamentation; for he understood that he, who was not content to wait patiently to see the Paradise of the faithful, had been judged already.  And he turned and left the hall without a word, and went into the jungle, where he lived for twenty-five years a life of prayer and meditations, until at last the Angel of Death came to him, and mercifully released him, purged and purified through his punishment.  [A Pathan story told to Major Campbell.]          How Isuro the Rabbit Tricked Gudu    Far away in a hot country, where the forests are very thick and dark, and the rivers very swift and strong, there once lived a strange pair of friends.  Now one of the friends was a big white rabbit named Isuro, and the other was a tall baboon called Gudu, and so fond were they of each other that they were seldom seen apart.  One day, when the sun was hotter even than usual, the rabbit awoke from his midday sleep, and saw Gudu the baboon standing beside him.  ‘Get up,’ said Gudu; ‘I am going courting, and you must come with me. So put some food in a bag, and sling it round your neck, for we may not be able to find anything to eat for a long while.’  Then the rabbit rubbed his eyes, and gathered a store of fresh green things from under the bushes, and told Gudu that he was ready for the journey.  They went on quite happily for some distance, and at last they came to a river with rocks scattered here and there across the stream.  ‘We can never jump those wide spaces if we are burdened with food,’ said Gudu, ‘we must throw it into the river, unless we wish to fall in ourselves.’  And stooping down, unseen by Isuro, who was in front of him, Gudu picked up a big stone, and threw it into the water with a loud splash.  ‘It is your turn now,’ he cried to Isuro.  And with a heavy sigh, the rabbit unfastened his bag of food, which fell into the river.  The road on the other side led down an avenue of trees, and before they had gone very far Gudu opened the bag that lay hidden in the thick hair about his neck, and began to eat some delicious-looking fruit.  ‘Where did you get that from?’ asked Isuro enviously.  ‘Oh, I found after all that I could get across the rocks quite easily, so it seemed a pity not to keep my bag,’ answered Gudu.  ‘Well, as you tricked me into throwing away mine, you ought to let me share with you,’ said Isuro.  But Gudu pretended not to hear him, and strode along the path.  By-and-bye they entered a wood, and right in front of them was a tree so laden with fruit that its branches swept the ground.  And some of the fruit was still green, and some yellow.  The rabbit hopped forward with joy, for he was very hungry; but Gudu said to him: ‘Pluck the green fruit, you will find it much the best.  I will leave it all for you, as you have had no dinner, and take the yellow for myself.’  So the rabbit took one of the green oranges and began to bite it, but its skin was so hard that he could hardly get his teeth through the rind.  ‘It does not taste at all nice,’ he cried, screwing up his face; ‘I would rather have one of the yellow ones.’  ‘No! no!  I really could not allow that,’ answered Gudu.  ‘They would only make you ill.  Be content with the green fruit.’  And as they were all he could get, Isuro was forced to put up with them.  After this had happened two or three times, Isuro at last had his eyes opened, and made up his mind that, whatever Gudu told him, he would do exactly the opposite.  However, by this time they had reached the village where dwelt Gudu’s future wife, and as they entered Gudu pointed to a clump of bushes, and said to Isuro: ‘Whenever I am eating, and you hear me call out that my food has burnt me, run as fast as you can and gather some of those leaves that they may heal my mouth.’  The rabbit would have liked to ask him why he ate food that he knew would burn him, only he was afraid, and just nodded in reply; but when they had gone on a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3027"],["title","The Orange Fairy Book (#4)"],["body","er, he said to Gudu:  ‘I have dropped my needle; wait here a moment while I go and fetch it.’  ‘Be quick then,’ answered Gudu, climbing into a tree.  And the rabbit hastened back to the bushes, and gathered a quantity of the leaves, which he hid among his fur, ‘For,’ thought he, ‘if I get them now I shall save myself the trouble of a walk by-and-by.’  When he had plucked as many as he wanted he returned to Gudu, and they went on together.   The sun was almost setting by the time they reached their journey’s end and being very tired they gladly sat down by a well.  Then Gudu’s betrothed, who had been watching for him, brought out a pitcher of water--which she poured over them to wash off the dust of the road--and two portions of food.  But once again the rabbit’s hopes were dashed to the ground, for Gudu said hastily:  ‘The custom of the village forbids you to eat till I have finished.’ And Isuro did not know that Gudu was lying, and that he only wanted more food.  So he saw hungrily looking on, waiting till his friend had had enough.  In a little while Gudu screamed loudly: ‘I am burnt!  I am burnt!’ though he was not burnt at all.  Now, though Isuro had the leaves about him, he did not dare to produce them at the last moment lest the baboon should guess why he had stayed behind.  So he just went round a corner for a short time, and then came hopping back in a great hurry.  But, quick though he was, Gudu had been quicker still, and nothing remained but some drops of water.  ‘How unlucky you are,’ said Gudu, snatching the leaves; ‘no sooner had you gone than ever so many people arrived, and washed their hands, as you see, and ate your portion.’  But, though Isuro knew better than to believe him, he said nothing, and went to bed hungrier than he had ever been in his life.  Early next morning they started for another village, and passed on the way a large garden where people were very busy gathering monkey- nuts.  ‘You can have a good breakfast at last,’ said Gudu, pointing to a heap of empty shells; never doubting but that Isuro would meekly take the portion shown him, and leave the real nuts for himself.  But what was his surprise when Isuro answered:  ‘Thank you; I think I should prefer these.’  And, turning to the kernels, never stopped as long as there was one left.  And the worst of it was that, with so many people about, Gudu could not take the nuts from him.  It was night when they reached the village where dwelt the mother of Gudu’s betrothed, who laid meat and millet porridge before them.  ‘I think you told me you were fond of porridge,’ said Gudu; but Isuro answered: ‘You are mistaking me for somebody else, as I always eat meat when I can get it.’  And again Gudu was forced to be content with the porridge, which he hated.  While he was eating it, however a sudden thought darted into his mind, and he managed to knock over a great pot of water which was hanging in front of the fire, and put it quite out.  ‘Now,’ said the cunning creature to himself, ‘I shall be able in the dark to steal his meat!’  But the rabbit had grown as cunning as he, and standing in a corner hid the meat behind him, so that the baboon could not find it.  ‘O Gudu!’ he cried, laughing aloud, ‘it is you who have taught me to be clever.’  And calling to the people of the house, he bade them kindle the fire, for Gudu would sleep by it, but that he would pass the night with some friends in another hut.   It was still quite dark when Isuro heard his name called very softly, and, on opening his eyes, beheld Gudu standing by him.  Laying his finger on his nose, in token of silence, he signed to Isuro to get up and follow him, and it was not until they were some distance from the hut that Gudu spoke.  ‘I am hungry and want something to eat better than that nasty porridge that I had for supper.  So I am going to kill one of those goats, and as you are a good cook you must boil the flesh for me.’  The rabbit nodded, and Gudu disappeared behind a rock, but soon returned dragging the dead goat with him.  The two then set about skinning it, after which they stuffed the skin with dried leaves, so that no one would have guessed it was not alive, and set it up in the middle of a lump of bushes, which kept it firm on its feet.  While he was doing this, Isuro collected sticks for a fire, and when it was kindled, Gudu hastened to another hut to steal a pot which he filled with water from the river, and, planting two branches in the ground, they hung the pot with the meat in it over the fire.  ‘It will not be fit to eat for two hours at least,’ said Gudu, ‘so we can both have a nap.’  And he stretched himself out on the ground, and pretended to fall fast asleep, but, in reality, he was only waiting till it was safe to take all the meat for himself.  ‘Surely I hear him snore,’ he thought; and he stole to the place where Isuro was lying on a pile of wood, but the rabbit’s eyes were wide open.  ‘How tiresome,’ muttered Gudu, as he went back to his place; and after waiting a little longer he got up, and peeped again, but still the rabbit’s pink eyes stared widely.  If Gudu had only known, Isuro was asleep all the time; but this he never guessed, and by-and- bye he grew so tired with watching that he went to sleep himself.  Soon after, Isuro woke up, and he too felt hungry, so he crept softly to the pot and ate all the meat, while he tied the bones together and hung them in Gudu’s fur.  After that he went back to the wood-pile and slept again.  In the morning the mother of Gudu’s betrothed came out to milk her goats, and on going to the bushes where the largest one seemed entangled, she found out the trick.  She made such lament that the people of the village came running, and Gudu and Isuro jumped up also, and pretended to be as surprised and interested as the rest.  But they must have looked guilty after all, for suddenly an old man pointed to them, and cried:  ‘Those are thieves.’  And at the sound of his voice the big Gudu trembled all over.  ‘How dare you say such things?  I defy you to prove it,’ answered Isuro boldly.  And he danced forward, and turned head over heels, and shook himself before them all.  ‘I spoke hastily; you are innocent,’ said the old man; ‘but now let the baboon do likewise.’  And when Gudu began to jump the goat’s bones rattled and the people cried: ‘It is Gudu who is the goat-slayer!’  But Gudu answered:  ‘Nay, I did not kill your goat; it was Isuro, and he ate the meat, and hung the bones round my neck.  So it is he who should die!’  And the people looked at each other, for they knew not what to believe.  At length one man said:  ‘Let them both die, but they may choose their own deaths.’  Then Isuro answered:  ‘If we must die, put us in the place where the wood is cut, and heap it up all round us, so that we cannot escape, and set fire to the wood; and if one is burned and the other is not, then he that is burned is the goat- slayer.’  And the people did as Isuro had said.  But Isuro knew of a hole under the wood-pile, and when the fire was kindled he ran into the hole, but Gudu died there.  When the fire had burned itself out and only ashes were left where the wood had been, Isuro came out of his hole, and said to the people:  ‘Lo! did I not speak well?  He who killed your goat is among those ashes.’  [Mashona Story.]                Ian, the Soldier’s Son    There dwelt a knight in Grianaig of the land of the West, who had three daughters, and for goodness and beauty they had not their like in all the isles.  All the people loved them, and loud was the weeping when one day, as the three maidens sat on the rocks on the edge of the sea, dipping their feet in the water, there arose a great beast from under the waves and swept them away beneath the ocean.  And none knew whither they had gone, or how to seek them.  Now there lived in a town a few miles off a soldier who had three sons, fine youths and strong, and the best players at shinny in that country.  At Christmastide that year, when families met together and great feasts were held, Ian, the youngest of the three brothers, said:  ‘Let us have a match at shinny on the lawn of the knight of Grianaig, for his lawn is wider and the grass smoother than ours.’  But the others answered:  ‘Nay, for he is in sorrow, and he will think of the games that we have played there when his daughters looked on.’  ‘Let him be pleased or angry as he will,’ said Ian; ‘we will drive our ball on his lawn to-day.’  And so it was done, and Ian won three games from his brothers.  But the knight looked out of his window, and was wroth; and bade his men bring the youths before him.  When he stood in his hall and beheld them, his heart was softened somewhat; but his face was angry as he asked:  ‘Why did you choose to play shinny in front of my castle when you knew full well that the remembrance of my daughters would come back to me? The pain which you have made me suffer you shall suffer also.’  ‘Since we have done you wrong,’ answered Ian, the youngest, ‘build us a ship, and we will go and seek your daughters.  Let them be to windward, or to leeward, or under the four brown boundaries of the sea, we will find them before a year and a day goes by, and will carry them back to Grianaig.’  In seven days the ship was built, and great store of food and wine placed in her.  And the three brothers put her head to the sea and sailed away, and in seven days the ship ran herself on to a beach of white sand, and they all went ashore.  They had none of them ever seen that land before, and looked about them.  Then they saw that, a short way from them, a number of men were working on a rock, with one man standing over them.  ‘What place is this?’ asked the eldest brother.  And the man who was standing by made answer:  ‘This is the place where dwell the three daughters of the knight of Grianaig, who are to be wedded to-morrow to three giants.’  ‘How can we find them?’ asked the young man again.
