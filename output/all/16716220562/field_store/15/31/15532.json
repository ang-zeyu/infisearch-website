Even as Jon followed this train of logic his fingers were busy. Palming a wrench, he was swiftly loosening the main retaining nut on his hip joint. It dropped free in his hand, only the pivot pin remained now to hold his leg on. He climbed slowly to his feet and moved towards Coleman's desk.  \"Mr. Coleman, sir, it's time to go down to the ship now, should I leave now, sir?\"  Jon spoke the words slowly as he walked forward, apparently going to the door, but angling at the same time towards the plump man's desk.  \"You got thirty minutes yet, go sit--_say_...!\"  The words were cut off. Fast as a human reflex is, it is the barest crawl compared to the lightning action of electronic reflex. At the instant Coleman was first aware of Jon's motion, the robot had finished his leap and lay sprawled across the desk, his leg off at the hip and clutched in his hand.  \"YOU'LL KILL YOURSELF IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON!\"  The words were part of the calculated plan. Jon bellowed them in the startled man's ear as he stuffed the dismembered leg down the front of the man's baggy slacks. It had the desired effect, Coleman's finger stabbed at the button but stopped before it made contact. He stared down with bulging eyes at the little black box of death peeping out of his waistband.  Jon hadn't waited for the reaction. He pushed backward from the desk and stopped to grab the stolen pinch bar off the floor. A mighty one-legged leap brought him to the locked closet; he stabbed the bar into the space between the door and frame and heaved.  Coleman was just starting to struggle the bomb out of his pants when the action was over. The closet open, Jon seized the heavy strap holding the second bomb on the rummy's chest and snapped it like a thread. He threw the bomb into Coleman's corner, giving the man one more thing to worry about. It had cost him a leg, but Jon had escaped the bomb threat without injuring a human. Now he had to get to a phone and make that call.  Coleman stopped tugging at the bomb and plunged his hand into the desk drawer for a gun. The returning men would block the door soon, the only other exit from the room was a frosted-glass window that opened onto the mammoth bay of the warehouse.  Jon Venex plunged through the window in a welter of flying glass. The heavy thud of a recoilless .75 came from the room behind him and a foot-long section of metal window frame leaped outward. Another slug screamed by the robot's head as he scrambled toward the rear door of the warehouse.  He was a bare thirty feet away from the back entrance when the giant door hissed shut on silent rollers. All the doors would have closed at the same time, the thud of running feet indicated that they would be guarded as well. Jon hopped a section of packing cases and crouched out of sight.  He looked up over his head, there stretched a webbing of steel supports, crossing and recrossing until they joined the flat expanse of the roof. To human eyes the shadows there deepened into obscurity, but the infra-red from a network of steam pipes gave Jon all the illumination he needed.  The men would be quartering the floor of the warehouse soon, his only chance to escape recapture or death would be over their heads. Besides this, he was hampered by the loss of his leg. In the rafters he could use his arms for faster and easier travel.  Jon was just pulling himself up to one of the topmost cross beams when a hoarse shout from below was followed by a stream of bullets. They tore through the thin roof, one slug clanged off the steel beam under his body. Waiting until three of the newcomers had started up a nearby ladder, Jon began to quietly work his way towards the back of the building.  Safe for the moment, he took stock of his position. The men were spread out through the building, it could only be a matter of time before they found him. The doors were all locked and--he had made a complete circuit of the building to be sure--there were no windows that he could force--the windows were bolted as well. If he could call the emergency operator the unknown friends of Venex 17 might come to his aid. This, however, was out of the question. The only phone in the building was on Coleman's desk. He had traced the leads to make sure.  His eyes went automatically to the cables above his head. Plastic gaskets were set in the wall of the building, through them came the power and phone lines. The phone line! That was all he needed to make a call.  With smooth, fast motions he reached up and scratched a section of wire bare. He laughed to himself as he slipped the little microphone out of his left ear. Now he was half deaf as well as half lame--he was literally giving himself to this cause. He would have to remember the pun to tell Alec Diger later, if there was a later. Alec had a profound weakness for puns.  Jon attached jumpers to the mike and connected them to the bare wire. A touch of the ammeter showed that no one was on the line. He waited a few moments to be sure he had a dial tone then sent the eleven carefully spaced pulses that would connect him with the local operator. He placed the mike close to his mouth.  \"Hello, operator. Hello, operator. I cannot hear you so do not answer. Call the emergency operator--signal 14, I repeat--signal 14.\"  Jon kept repeating the message until the searching men began to approach his position. He left the mike connected--the men wouldn't notice it in the dark but the open line would give the unknown powers his exact location. Using his fingertips he did a careful traverse on an I-beam to an alcove in the farthest corner of the room. Escape was impossible, all he could do was stall for time.  \"Mr. Coleman, I'm sorry I ran away.\" With the volume on full his voice rolled like thunder from the echoing walls.  He could see the men below twisting their heads vainly to find the source.  \"If you let me come back and don't kill me I will do your work. I was afraid of the bomb, but now I am afraid of the guns.\" It sounded a little infantile, but he was pretty sure none of those present had any sound knowledge of robotic intelligence.  \"Please let me come back ... sir!\" He had almost forgotten the last word, so he added another \"Please, sir!\" to make up.  Coleman needed that package under the boat very badly, he would promise anything to get it. Jon had no doubts as to his eventual fate, all he could hope to do was kill time in the hopes that the phone message would bring aid.  \"Come on down, Junky, I won't be mad at you--if you follow directions.\" Jon could hear the hidden anger in his voice, the unspoken hatred for a robe who dared lay hands on him.  The descent wasn't difficult, but Jon did it slowly with much apparent discomfort. He hopped into the center of the floor--leaning on the cases as if for support. Coleman and Druce were both there as well as a group of hard-eyed newcomers. They raised their guns at his approach but Coleman stopped them with a gesture.  \"This is _my_ robe, boys, I'll see to it that he's happy.\"  He raised his gun and shot Jon's remaining leg off. Twisted around by the blast, Jon fell helplessly to the floor. He looked up into the smoking mouth of the .75.  \"Very smart for a tin-can, but not smart enough. We'll get the junk on the boat some other way, some way that won't mean having you around under foot.\" Death looked out of his narrowed eyes.  Less than two minutes had passed since Jon's call. The watchers must have been keeping 24 hour stations waiting for Venex 17's phone message.  The main door went down with the sudden scream of torn steel. A whippet tank crunched over the wreck and covered the group with its multiple pom-poms. They were an instant too late, Coleman pulled the trigger.  Jon saw the tensing trigger finger and pushed hard against the floor. His head rolled clear but the bullet tore through his shoulder. Coleman didn't have a chance for a second shot, there was a fizzling hiss from the tank and the riot ports released a flood of tear gas. The stricken men never saw the gas-masked police that poured in from the street.         *       *       *       *       *  Jon lay on the floor of the police station while a tech made temporary repairs on his leg and shoulder. Across the room Venex 17 was moving his new body with evident pleasure.  \"Now this really feels like _something_! I was sure my time was up when that land slip caught me. But maybe I ought to start from the beginning.\" He stamped across the room and shook Jon's inoperable hand.  \"The name is Wil Counter-4951L3, not that _that_ means much any more. I've worn so many different bodies that I forget what I originally looked like. I went right from factory-school to a police training school--and I have been on the job ever since--Force of Detectives, Sergeant Jr. grade, Investigation Department. I spend most of my time selling candy bars or newspapers, or serving drinks in crumb joints. Gather information, make reports and keep tab on guys for other departments.  \"This last job--and I'm sorry I had to use a Venex identity, I don't think I brought any dishonor to your family--I was on loan to the Customs department. Seems a ring was bringing uncut junk--heroin--into the country. F.B.I. tabbed all the operators here, but no one knew how the stuff got in. When Coleman, he's the local big-shot, called the agencies for an underwater robot, I was packed into a new body and sent running.  \"I alerted the squad as soon as I started the tunnel, but the damned thing caved in on me before I found out what ship was doing the carrying. From there on you know what happened.  \"Not knowing I was out of the game the squad sat tight and waited. The hop merchants saw a half million in snow sailing back to the old country so they had you dragged in as a replacement. You made the phone call and the cavalry rushed in at the last moment to save two robots from a rusty grave.\"  Jon, who had been trying"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29471"],["title","The Velvet Glove (#4)"],["body"," to get in a word, saw his chance as Wil Counter turned to admire the reflection of his new figure in a window.  \"You shouldn't be telling me those things--about your police investigations and department operations. Isn't this information supposed to be secret? Specially from robots!\"  \"Of course it is!\" was Wil's airy answer. \"Captain Edgecombe--he's the head of my department--is an expert on all kinds of blackmail. I'm supposed to tell you so much confidential police business that you'll have to either join the department or be shot as a possible informer.\" His laughter wasn't shared by the bewildered Jon.  \"Truthfully, Jon, we need you and can use you. Robes that can think fast and act fast aren't easy to find. After hearing about the tricks you pulled in that warehouse, the Captain swore to decapitate me permanently if I couldn't get you to join up. Do you need a job? Long hours, short pay--but guaranteed to never get boring.\"  Wil's voice was suddenly serious. \"You saved my life, Jon--those snowbirds would have left me in that sandpile until all hell froze over. I'd like you for a mate, I think we could get along well together.\" The gay note came back into his voice, \"And besides that, I may be able to save your life some day--I hate owing debts.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The tech was finished, he snapped his tool box shut and left. Jon's shoulder motor was repaired now, he sat up. When they shook hands this time it was a firm clasp. The kind you know will last awhile.         *       *       *       *       *  Jon stayed in an empty cell that night. It was gigantic compared to the hotel and barrack rooms he was used to. He wished that he had his missing legs so he could take a little walk up and down the cell. He would have to wait until the morning. They were going to fix him up then before he started the new job.  He had recorded his testimony earlier and the impossible events of the past day kept whirling around in his head. He would think about it some other time, right now all he wanted to do was let his overworked circuits cool down, if he only had something to read, to focus his attention on. Then, with a start, he remembered the booklet. Everything had moved so fast that the earlier incident with the truck driver had slipped his mind completely.  He carefully worked it out from behind the generator shielding and opened the first page of _Robot Slaves in a World Economy_. A card slipped from between the pages and he read the short message on it.      PLEASE DESTROY THIS CARD AFTER READING      _If you think there is truth in this book and would like to hear     more, come to Room B, 107 George St. any Tuesday at 5 P.M._  The card flared briefly and was gone. But he knew that it wasn't only a perfect memory that would make him remember that message.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ November 1956.
