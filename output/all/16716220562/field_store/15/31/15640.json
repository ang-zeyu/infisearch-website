Louder and wilder the merriment grows,   For the hobby-horse comes, and his rider he throws!         And the dragon's roar,         As he paweth the floor,         And belcheth fire         In his demon ire,   When the Abbot the monster takes by the nose,   Stirreth a tempest of uproar and din--   Yet none surmiseth the joke is a sin--   For the saints, from the windows, in purple and gold,   With smiles, say the gossips, Yule games behold;   And, at Christmas, the Virgin all divine   Smileth on sport, from her silver shrine!   \"Come forth, come forth! it is high noon,\"     Cries Hugh the seneschal;   \"My masters, will ye ne'er have done?     Come forth unto the hall!\"--    'Tis high Yule-tide in Torksey hall:   Full many a trophy bedecks the wall     Of prowess in field and wood;   Blent with the buckler and grouped with the spear   Hang tusks of the boar, and horns of the deer--   But De Thorold's guests beheld nought there     That scented of human blood.   The mighty wassail horn suspended   From the tough yew-bow, at Hastings bended,   With wreaths of bright holly and ivy bound,   Were perches for falcons that shrilly screamed,   While their look with the lightning of anger gleamed,   As they chided the fawning of mastiff and hound,   That crouched at the feet of each peasant guest,   And asked, with their eyes, to share the feast.    Sir Wilfrid's carven chair of state   'Neath the dais is gently elevate,--   But his smile bespeaks no lordly pride:   Sweet Edith sits by her loved sire's side,   And five hundred guests, some free, some thrall,   Sit by the tables along the wide hall,   Each with his platter, and stout drink-horn,--   They count on good cheer this Christmas morn!    Not long they wait, not long they wish--   The trumpet peals,--and the kingly dish,--     The head of the brawny boar,   Decked with rosemary and laurels gay,--   Upstarting, they welcome, with loud huzza,     As their fathers did, of yore!   And they point to the costard he bears in his mouth,         And vow the huge pig,         So luscious a fig,   Would not gather to grunch in the daintiful South!    Strike up, strike up, a louder chime,     Ye minstrels in the loft!   Strike up! it is no fitting time     For drowsy strains and soft,--         When sewers threescore         Have passed the hall door,   And the tables are laden with roast and boiled,   And carvers are hasting, lest all should be spoiled;         And gossips' tongues clatter         More loudly than platter,   And tell of their marvel to reckon the sorts:--    Ham by fat capon, and beef by green worts;   Ven'son from forest, and mutton from fold;   Brawn from the oak-wood, and hare from the wold;   Wild-goose from fen, and tame from the lea;   And plumëd dish from the heronry--   With choicest apples 'twas featly rimmed,   And stood next the flagons with malmsey brimmed,--   Near the knightly swan, begirt with quinces,   Which the gossips said was a dish for princes,--   Though his place was never to stand before   The garnished head of the royal boar!    Puddings of plumbs and mince-pies, placed   In plenty along the board, met taste   Of gossip and maiden,--nor did they fail   To sip, now and then, of the double brown ale--   That ploughman and shepherd vowed and sware   Was each drop so racy, and sparkling, and rare--   No outlandish Rhenish could with it compare!    Trow ye they stayed till the meal was done   To pledge a health? Degenerate son   Of friendly sires! a health thrice-told   Each guest had pledged to fellowships old,--   Untarrying eager mouth to wipe,   And across the board with hearty gripe   Joining rough hands,--ere the meal was o'er:--   Hearts and hands went with \"healths\" in the days of yore!    The meal is o'er,--though the time of mirth,   Each brother feels, is but yet in its birth:--   \"Wassail, wassail!\" the seneschal cries;   And the spicy bowl rejoiceth all eyes,   When before the baron beloved 'tis set,   And he dippeth horn, and thus doth greet   The honest hearts around him met:--    \"Health to ye all, my brothers good!     All health and happiness!   Health to the absent of our blood!     May Heaven the suffering bless,--   And cheer their hearts who lie at home   In pain, now merry Yule hath come!     My jolly freres, all health!\"    The shout is loud and long,--but tears   Glide quickly from some eyes, while ears     List whispering sounds of stealth   That tell how the noble Thorold hath sent,   To palsied widow and age-stricken hind,   Clothing and food, and brother-words kind,--   Cheering their aching languishment!    \"Wassail, wassail!\" Sir Wilfrid saith,--     \"Push round the brimming bowl!--   Art thou there, minstrel?--By my faith,     All list to hear thee troll,   Again, some goodly love-lorn verse!--   Begin thy ditty to rehearse,   And take, for guerdon, wishes blythe--   Less thou wilt take red gold therewith!\"    Red gold the minstrel saith he scorneth,--   But, now the merry Yule returneth,   For love of Him whom angels sung,   And love of one his burning tongue   Is fain to name, but may not tell,--   Once more, unto the harp's sweet swell,   A knightly chanson he will sing,--   And, straight, he struck the throbbing string.   Sir Raymond and the False Palmer.  THE STRANGER MINSTREL'S SECOND TALE.    Sir Raymond de Clifford, a gallant band   Hath gathered to fight in the Holy Land;   And his lady's heart is sinking in sorrow,--   For the knight and his lances depart on the morrow!    \"Oh, wherefore, noble Raymond, tell,\"--     His lovely ladye weeping said,--   \"With lonely sorrow must I dwell,     When but three bridal moons have fled?\"    Sir Raymond kissed her pale, pale cheek,     And strove, with a warrior's pride,   While an answer of love he essayed to speak,     His flooding tears to hide.    But an image rose in his heated brain,   That shook his heart with vengeful pain,   And anger flashed in his rolling eye,   While his ladye looked on him tremblingly.    Yet, he answered not in wrathful haste,--   But clasped his bride to his manly breast;   And with words of tender yet stately dress,   Thus strove to banish her heart's distress:--    \"De Burgh hath enrolled him with Philip of France,--   Baron Hubert,--who challenged De Clifford's lance,   And made him the scoff of the burgher swine,   When he paid his vows at the Virgin's shrine.    \"Oh, ask me not, love, to tarry in shame,--   Lest 'craven' be added to Raymond's name!   To Palestine hastens my mortal foe,--   And I with our Lion's Heart will go!    \"Nay, Gertrude, repeat not thy sorrowing tale!   Behold in my casque the scallop-shell,--   And see on my shoulder the Holy Rood--   The pledge of my emprize--bedyed in blood!    \"Thou wouldst not, love, I should be forsworn,   Nor the stain on my honour be tamely borne:   Do thou to the saints, each passing day,   For Raymond and royal Richard pray,--    \"While they rush to the rescue, for God's dear Son;     And soon, for thy Raymond, the conqu'ror's meed,--     By the skill of this arm, and the strength of my steed,--   From the Paynim swart shall be nobly won.    \"Thou shalt not long for De Clifford mourn,   Ere he to thy bosom of love return;   When blind to the lure of the red-cross bright,   He will bask, for life, in thy beauty's light!\"    The morn in the radiant east arose:--     The Red-cross Knight hath spurred his steed     That courseth as swift as a falcon's speed:--   To the salt-sea shore Sir Raymond goes.    Soon, the sea he hath crossed, to Palestine;   And there his heart doth chafe and pine,--   For Hubert de Burgh is not in that land:   He loitereth in France, with Philip's band.    But De Clifford will never a recreant turn,   While the knightly badge on his arm is borne;   And long, beneath the Syrian sun,   He fasted and fought, and glory won.    His Gertrude, alas! like a widow pines;   And though on her castle the bright sun shines,   She sees not its beams,--but in loneliness prays,   Through the live-long hours of her weeping days.--    Twelve moons have waned, and the morn is come   When, a year before, from his meed-won home   Sir Raymond went:--At the castle gate   A reverend Palmer now doth wait.    He saith he hath words for the ladye's ear;   And he telleth, in accents dread and drear,   Of De Clifford's death in the Holy Land,   At Richard's side, by a Saracen's hand.    And he gave to the ladye, when thus he had spoken,--   Of Sir Raymond's fall a deathly token:   'Twas a lock of his hair all stained with blood,   Entwined on a splinter of Holy Rood.--    Then the Palmer in haste from the castle sped;     And from gloomy morn to weary night,     Lorn Gertrude, in her widowed plight,   Weepeth and waileth the knightly dead.--    Three moons have waned, and the Palmer, again,   By Gertrude stands, and smileth fain;   Nor of haste, nor of death, speaks the Palmer, now;   Nor doth sadness or sorrow bedim his brow.    He softly sits by the ladye's side,   And vaunteth his deeds of chivalrous pride;   Then lisps, in her secret ear, of things   Which deeply endanger the thrones of kings:    From Philip of France, he saith, he came,   To treat with Prince John, whom she must not name;   And he, in fair France, hath goodly lands,--   And a thousand vassals there wait his commands.--    The ladye liked her gallant guest,--   For he kenned the themes that pleased her best;   And his tongue, in silken measures skilled,   With goodly ditties her memory filled.    Thus the Palmer the ladye's ear beguiles,--   Till Gertrude her sorrow exchangeth for smiles;   And when from the castle the Palmer went,   She watched his return, from the battlement.--    Another moon doth swell and wane:--     But how slowly it waneth!     How her heart now paineth   For sight of the Palmer again!    But the Palmer comes, and her healëd heart "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29722"],["title","The Baron's Yule Feast: A Christmas Rhyme (#6)"],["body","    Derideth pain and sorrow:   She pledgeth the Palmer, and smirketh smart,     And saith, \"we'll wed to-morrow!\"--    The morrow is come, and at break of day,   'Fore the altar, the abbot, in holy array,   Is joining the Palmer's and Gertrude's hands,--   But, in sudden amazement the holy man stands!    For, before the castle, a trumpet's blast   Rings so loud that the Palmer starts aghast;   And, at Gertrude's side, he sinks dismayed,--   Is't with dread of the living, or fear of the dead?    The doors of the chapel were open thrown,   And the beams through the pictured windows shone   On the face of De Clifford, with fury flushed,--   And forth on the Palmer he wildly rushed!--    \"False Hubert!\" he cried; and his knightly sword   Was sheathed in the heart of the fiend-sold lord!--   With a scream of terror, Gertrude fell--   For she knew the pride of Sir Raymond well!    He flew to raise her--but 'twas in vain:   Her spirit its flight in fear had ta'en!--   And Sir Raymond kneels that his soul be shriven,   And the stain of this deed be by grace forgiven:--    But ere the Abbot his grace can dole,     De Clifford's truthful heart is breaking,--     And his soul, also, its flight is taking!--   Christ, speed it to a heavenly goal!--   Oh, pray for the peace of Sir Raymond's soul!       THE   BARON'S YULE FEAST.    A   Christmas Rhyme.    CANTO IV.     What power can stay the burst of song     When throats with ale are mellow?   What wight with nieve so stout and strong   Dares lift it, jolly freres among,     And cry, \"Knaves, cease to bellow?\"    \"'Twas doleful drear,\"--the gossips vowed,--   To hear the minstrel's piteous tale!   But, when the swineherd tuned his crowd,[14]   And the gosherd began to grumble loud,   The gossips smiled, and sipped their ale!    \"A boon, bold Thorold!\" boldly cried     The gosherd from Croyland fen;   \"I crave to sing of the fen so wide,     And of geese and goosish men!\"    Loud loffe they all; and the baron, with glee,   Cried \"begin, good Swithin! for men may see   Thou look'st so like a knowing fowl,   Of geese thou art skilled right well to troll!\"    Stout Swithin sware the baron spake well,--   And his halting ditty began to tell:   The rhyme was lame, and dull the joke,--   But it tickled the ears of clownish folk.   The Gosherd's Song.    'Tis a tale of merry Lincolnshire     I've heard my grannam tell;   And I'll tell it to you, my masters, here,     An' it likes you all, full well.    A Gosherd on Croyland fen, one day,     Awoke, in haste, from slumber;   And on counting his geese, to his sad dismay,     He found there lacked one of the number.    O the Gosherd looked west, and he looked east,     And he looked before and behind him;   And his eye from north to south he cast     For the gander--but couldn't find him!    So the Gosherd he drave his geese to the cote,     And began, forthwith, to wander   Over the marshy wild remote,     In search of the old stray gander.    O the Gosherd he wandered till twilight gray     Was throwing its mists around him;   But the gander seemed farther and farther astray--     For the Gosherd had not yet found him.    So the Gosherd, foredeeming his search in vain,     Resolved no farther to wander;   But to Croyland he turned him, in dudgeon, again,     Sore fretting at heart for the gander.    Thus he footed the fens so dreary and dern,     While his brain, like the sky, was dark'ning;   And with dread to the scream o' the startled hern     And the bittern's boom he was heark'ning.    But when the Gosherd the church-yard reached,--     Forefearing the dead would be waking,--   Like a craven upon the sward he stretched,     And could travel no farther for quaking!    And there the Gosherd lay through the night,     Not daring to rise and go further:   For, in sooth, the Gosherd beheld a sight     That frighted him more than murther!    From the old church clock the midnight hour     In hollow tones was pealing,   When a slim white ghost to the church porch door     Seemed up the footpath stealing!    Stark staring upon the sward lay the clown,     And his heart went \"pitter patter,\"--   Till the ghost in the clay-cold grave sunk down,--     When he felt in a twitter-twatter!    Soon--stretching aloft its long white arms--     From the grave the ghost was peeping!--   Cried the Gosherd, \"Our Lady defend me from harms,     And Saint Guthlacke[15] have me in his keeping!\"    The white ghost hissed!--the Gosherd swooned!     In the morn,--on the truth 'tis no slander,--   Near the church porch door a new grave he found,     And, therein, the white ghost--his stray gander!      *       *       *       *       *    The Gosherd, scarce, his mirthful meed     Had won, ere Tibbald of Stow,--   With look as pert as the pouncing glede     When he eyeth the chick below,--       Scraped his crowd,       And clear and loud,       As the merle-cock shrill,       Or the bell from the hill,   Thus tuned his throat to his rough sire's praise--   His sire the swineherd of olden days:--   The Swineherd's Song.    I sing of a swineherd, in Lindsey, so bold,   Who tendeth his flock in the wide forest-fold:   He sheareth no wool from his snouted sheep:   He soweth no corn, and none he doth reap:   Yet the swineherd no lack of good living doth know:         Come jollily trowl         The brown round bowl,   Like the jovial swineherd of Stow!    He hedgeth no meadows to fatten his swine:   He renteth no joist for his snorting kine:   They rove through the forest, and browse on the mast,--   Yet, he lifteth his horn, and bloweth a blast,   And they come at his call, blow he high, blow he low!--         Come, jollily trowl         The brown round bowl,   And drink to the swineherd of Stow!    He shunneth the heat 'mong the fern-stalks green,--   Or dreameth of elves 'neath the forest treen:   He wrappeth him up when the oak leaves sere   And the ripe acorns fall, at the wane o' the year;   And he tippleth at Yule, by the log's cheery glow.--         Come, jollily trowl         The brown round bowl,   And pledge the bold swineherd of Stow!    The bishop he passeth the swineherd in scorn,--   Yet, to mass wends the swineherd at Candlemas morn;   And he offereth his horn, at our Lady's hymn,   With bright silver pennies filled up to the brim:--   Saith the bishop, \"A very good fellow, I trow!\"--         Come, jollily trowl         The brown round bowl,   And honour the swineherd of Stow!    And now the brave swineherd, in stone, ye may spy,   Holding his horn, on the Minster so high!--   But the swineherd he laugheth, and cracketh his joke,   With his pig-boys that vittle beneath the old oak,--   Saying, \"Had I no pennies, they'd make me no show!\"--         Come, jollily trowl         The brown round bowl,   And laugh with the swineherd of Stow![16]      *       *       *       *       *    So merrily the chorus rose,--     For every guest chimed in,--   That, had the dead been there to doze,     They had surely waked with the din!--   So the rustics said while their brains were mellow;   And all called the swineherd \"a jolly good fellow!\"    \"Come, hearty Snell!\" said the Baron good;   \"What sayest thou more of the merry greenwood?\"    \"I remember no lay of the forest, now,\"--   Said Snell, with a glance at three maids in a row;   \"Belike, I could whimper a love-lorn ditty,--   If Tib, Doll, and Bell, would listen with pity!\"    \"Then chaunt us thy love-song!\" cried Baron and guests;   And Snell, looking shrewd, obeyed their behests.   The Woodman's Love Song.    Along the meads a simple maid   One summer's day a musing strayed,   And, as the cowslips sweet she pressed,   This burthen to the breeze confessed--         I fear that I'm in love!    For, ever since so playfully   Young Robin trod this path with me,   I always feel more happy here   Than ever I have felt elsewhere:--         I fear that I'm in love!    And, ever since young Robin talked   So sweetly, while alone we walked,   Of truth, and faith, and constancy,   I've wished he always walked with me:--         I fear that I'm in love!    And, ever since that pleasing night   When, 'neath the lady moon's fair light,   He asked my hand, but asked in vain,   I've wished he'd walk, and ask again:--         I fear that I'm in love!    And yet, I greatly fear, alas!   That wish will ne'er be brought to pass!--   What else to fear I cannot tell:--   I hope that all will yet be well--         But, surely, I'm in love!      *       *       *       *       *    Coy was their look, but true their pleasure,   While the maidens listed the woodman's measure;   Nor shrunk they at laughter of herdsman or hind,   But mixed with the mirth, and still looked kind.    One maid there was who faintly smiled,     But never joined their laughter:   And why, by Yule-mirth unbeguiled,     Sits the Baron's beauteous daughter?   Why looks she downcast, yet so sweet,   And seeketh no eyes with mirth to greet?    \"My darling Edith,--hast no song?\"     Saith Thorold, tenderly;   \"Our guests have tarried to hear thee, long,     And looked with wistful eye!\"    Soft words the peerless damosel     Breathes of imperfect skill:   \"Sweet birds,\" smiles the Baron, \"all know--right well,     Can sweetly sing an' they will.\"    And the stranger minstrel, on his knee,   Offers his harp, with courtesy   So rare and gentle, that the hall   Rings with applause which one and all   Render who share the festival.    De Thorold smiled; and the maiden took   The harp, with grace in act and look,--   But waked its echoes tremulously,--   Singing no noisy jubilee,--   But a chanson of sweetly stifled pain--   So sweet--when ended all were fain   To hear her chaunt it o'er again.   The Baron's Daughter's Song.    I own the gay lark is the blythest bird     That welcomes the purple dawn;   But a sweeter chorister far is heard     When the veil of eve is drawn:    When the last lone traveller homeward wends     O'er the moorland, drowsily;   And "]]]
