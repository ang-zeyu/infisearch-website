They had relaxed, having found control of the situation, and they were cutting her to pieces.  \"Tell me,\" his sister was saying, her eyes dancing slyly, \"don't you people have some very strange tricks you can do?\"  George tightened his fingers against his palms. He heard Gistla answer, \"Tricks?\"  \"Yes.\" His sister's white smile shined. \"You know, like making things disappear, things like that.\"  \"My father,\" Gistla said seriously, \"can do very wonderful things. He is a musician.\"  George's father leaned forward, blinking amusedly. \"Really? What does he play?\"  \"Play?\" asked Gistla.  \"Yes. He's a musician. He must play something, some kind of instrument.\"  Gistla looked at George, but George did not know what to say. He wished he had never tried to do this. He wished he had just ignored his family and gone on loving Gistla in the privacy of his own emotions.  \"Well, now,\" Mr. Kenington was saying rather impatiently. \"Does he play something like our violin or clarinet or oboe, or what?\" His father, George had noticed, was becoming impatient more frequently since he had become Secretary. The Secretarial post was very important.  \"He does not play anything,\" Gistla said carefully. \"He just ... makes the music and I hear it.\"  \"But how?\" Mr. Kenington insisted. \"What does he play the music _on_? He certainly can't make the music without using something to make it on.\"  Gistla glanced again at George and he said quickly, \"It's pretty hard to understand, Father. I don't think--\"  \"No, now don't interrupt just now, son. This is very interesting. We'd like to know what she's talking about.\"  Mrs. Kenington spoke for the first time. \"Are you just making this up?\"  It was like a whip coming through the air. His mother sat there, blinking, the suspicion and distrust she felt for this creature showing in her eyes and upon her mouth and even in the way she was sitting.  \"Now, Lois,\" Mr. Kenington said, as though he really sympathized with what she had said, believing that not only Gistla was making it up, but that all of her race made everything up. But he was stubborn. \"Come now, tell us. Tell us what you mean.\"  Gistla's smooth head turned this way and that. \"Sometimes,\" she said slowly, \"my father journeys to other places, and if he cannot return soon, he sends me music. When the light has gone from the day and I am alone, I hear it.\"  \"You mean he sends it by wires or by radio?\" Mr. Kenington asked with surprise.  \"No.\"  \"Now, wait a minute,\" George's sister leaned forward, smiling. \"You just hear this music, is that right? Up here.\" She tapped her forehead.  \"Yes,\" said Gistla.  \"My God,\" George's sister said. She looked at her parents, arching her eyebrows.  \"You shouldn't make things up,\" George's mother said.  \"Mother,\" George said, his face coloring. \"She's not making things up!\"  \"Just a moment, son,\" Mr. Kenington said crisply. \"You don't want to talk to your mother in that tone.\"  \"No, but, my God,\" George's sister went on. \"Imagine. No wires, no loudspeakers, just ... up here.\" She tapped her forehead again.  \"I'm not talking to my mother in any tone at all,\" George said, disregarding his sister.  \"Well, she shouldn't lie,\" said Mrs. Kenington with conviction.  George stood up. \"She is not lying, Mother.\"  \"I forbid you to argue with your mother that way, George,\" said Mr. Kenington.  \"I mean, my God,\" said George's sister happily. \"This is an innovation! Can you imagine? Gistla, or whatever your name is, could your father make his music sometime when we have a dance?\"  Gistla's eyes were hurt and she was, George knew, confused. She shook her head.  Mrs. Kenington was blinking accusingly. \"Do they teach you to make these things up? Is that what they teach you at home?\"  \"Mother, will you please?\" George said. \"Why must you talk to her that way?\"  Mr. Kenington stood up quickly. \"I did not raise my son to show an attitude like that to his mother.\"  \"But she isn't making this up,\" George said. \"You asked her to tell you and she--\"  George's sister had jumped out of her chair and she was waltzing over the patio. She began humming as she danced. \"Can't you just see it? Everyone dancing around, listening to music in their heads? No orchestra or records or anything?\"  Mr. Kenington stood very tall. \"Are you taking the word of your mother, or this ... this ...\" He motioned curtly at Gistla.  George licked his lips, looking defensively at each one of his family. \"It isn't a matter of taking anyone's word at all. It's just something we don't understand.\"  George's sister whirled and then suddenly she stopped, putting her hand against her mouth. \"My God, what if everyone got the music different? I mean, does everyone hear the same music, dear? Because if they didn't, what a mess!\" She began dancing again, her skirt swirling over the bricks of the patio.  Mr. Kenington's voice was louder. \"I think we understand, all right, George. There isn't anything about this we don't understand!\"  George's lips were paling.  His sister dipped and turned. \"We could call it a Music In The Head dance. Everybody brings his own head!\" She laughed merrily. \"My God!\"  George noticed then that Gistla was disappearing out of the rear gate. He stood, clenching his fists and glaring at his family. His sister had stopped dancing but she was still laughing.  \"I didn't think, George,\" his mother said resolutely, \"that you were going to invite someone who lied.\"  George turned and ran after Gistla.         *       *       *       *       *  They sat again in the clearing. George could still feel the anger churning inside him, and he held his hands together so tightly that his fingers began to ache. \"I hate them for that,\" he said.  Gistla touched his arm. \"No, George. It is all right. It is the way things are.\"  \"But they don't need to be! My family did that on purpose.\"  \"They just don't understand. My race is very different from yours and it seems strange.\"  \"So does mine,\" George said, standing and beginning to pace back and forth.  It had been what he really had expected. But still he had hoped, somehow, that his family might have understood. He looked at Gistla, sitting quietly, her large eyes watching him. He knew he loved her very much just then, more in fact than he ever had before, because she had been refused by his family.  \"Listen, Gistla,\" he said, kneeling on the grass in front of her. \"It won't make any difference what anyone thinks or does or says. I love you, and I'll go on loving you. We'll build our own life the way we want it.\"  She shook her head slowly. \"No, George. It does make a difference. You cannot forget your family or your people. That is important to you. I would only hurt you.\"  \"Do you love me?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then that's all that's important to me. Not what anyone thinks. Not what my sister thinks or my father or my mother.\"  \"We are different, you and I.\" She sat unmoving, her smooth face unchanging. \"My people seem strange to yours because we can do things your people do not understand. We seem strange because we look differently, we act differently, we value things differently.\"  \"My values are the same as yours,\" George pleaded. \"I love you because of what you are, not because of some kind of stupid chart for physical beauty, not because ...\"  \"George,\" she said. \"Look at me.\"  George met her eyes suddenly, caught by the urgency in her voice. And slowly, in front of his eyes, she changed. Her features shifted, until George saw a beautiful young girl with pink white skin and red lips. He saw shining blue eyes and shimmering golden hair that fell over her shoulders. Gistla's body had changed to a lithe, smooth figure that revealed its contours beneath the gray cape.  He caught his breath and wiped a hand at his eyes.  \"What you see,\" said Gistla softly, \"is an illusion. You see what would be in your values, a beautiful girl.\"  George opened his mouth but was unable to find his voice.  \"Do not be afraid, George. Beneath the illusion of your senses, I am still Gistla. I am still a Venusian.\"  George reached out and touched his fingers against a white arm and a white shoulder bared by the cape. He touched the golden hair. \"Gistla,\" he said, amazed. \"You're beautiful.\"  \"Yes,\" she said sadly.  \"But--you really are! Your hair and your eyes and your mouth. How did you do it?\"  She shook her head to show its unimportance. \"It is something--like your hypnotism.\"  George raised himself from his knees and sat beside her. \"But I can't believe it!\"  \"You can see, you can feel.\"  \"Yes,\" George said. \"Yes.\"  \"You are happy with me this way, aren't you, George?\"  \"But you're so beautiful.\"  The golden-haired girl nodded her head, and the shining blue eyes watched him carefully.  \"You see then,\" Gistla said. \"It does make a difference. You love me more this way.\"  \"No,\" George said, touching her hair again. \"I don't love you more, but if you can do this, why then, we'll have no more worries. Don't you see?\"  \"I think so,\" Gistla said, looking away.  George's voice was excited, and his eyes darted over her face and body. \"Would other people see you as I do?\"  \"If I wished, yes.\"  \"Then you see? It's all changed! You are what I see. Golden-haired and pale-skinned--\"  \"I am still Gistla. You would always know that. Would you love something that is not real, just because you see it with your eyes?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But I can feel that you're real,\" George said, putting his hands on her shoulders. He pulled her closer and kissed her hair. \"You're Gistla,\" he said, \"and you're beautiful.\" He tipped her face up to his and bent to kiss her mouth.  His lips touched smooth green skin and he looked into Gistla's large round lidless eyes. He recoiled as though he had been touched by fire.  She watched him as he wiped a trembling hand across his chest, and her globular head glistened in the reflection of the late sun.  She nodded. \"When you see what I really am,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29578"],["title","George Loves Gistla (#2)"],["body","difference _is_ important.\" She gathered her cloak around her and stood up.  George felt the flush of his face, and he could not meet her eyes. He heard her walk a few steps away.  \"Good-by, George,\" she said.  He jumped up quickly. \"That wasn't fair.\"  \"No,\" she said slowly, \"but it proved the value of things.\"  \"It wasn't fair,\" George repeated. \"And it didn't prove anything.\"  \"I think it did,\" she said, moving away.  \"No, listen, Gistla,\" he said. \"You can't judge anything by what I did or said. We are different, in a physical sense, but that doesn't really matter. If a golden-haired girl materializes in front of my eyes, you can't blame me for what my emotions did. It's still you I love. Not the color of your skin or the shape of your mouth. But you and what you or I or anybody else looks like isn't important!\"  He followed her and caught her arm. She turned to face him. \"You can say that,\" she said. \"Your words tell me that and your eyes, but I know it isn't true.\"  The embarrassment was still inside him, but the way she denied him made him want her more than ever. He held to her arm and then he said, \"Gistla, could you change me? I mean, so that other people, even I, would see me as they see you--as a Venusian?\"  She stood very still, staring at him.  \"Could you?\" he asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Then do it, Gistla. I'll prove to you that nothing is important but you and me. I'll be a Venusian, like you are. I'll go back to my family as a Venusian and I'll take you with me. I'll prove that neither they nor anybody else makes any difference in how I love you!\"  Gistla watched him solemnly. Finally she said, \"Would you really do that?\"  \"Yes,\" he said quickly, \"Yes.\"  \"I love you, George,\" she said in her deep round voice.  He lifted his hands to touch her face and he found that his skin had turned to pale green. He touched his own face, and he knew that if he looked into a mirror he would see a round smooth head with large lidless eyes.  \"Is that what you wanted?\" she asked.  \"Yes,\" he said stubbornly. \"That's what I wanted.\" He stood there for a long time, trying to become used to it, fighting the fear that ran through him every time he looked at his hands or touched his head. Finally he said, quietly, \"Let's go meet my family.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As they drew near the house, he knew his family was still in the patio. He could hear the voices of his mother and father and the high, piercing laughter of his sister.  \"And, my God,\" he heard his sister say, \"did you see the way those horrible eyes looked at you? What ever gets into George?\"  \"Dear, dear, dear,\" he heard his mother say.  Gistla was looking at him. \"You do not have to do this.\"  \"Yes,\" he said, feeling his heart jump. \"I do.\"  He took her hand and they walked to the gate of the patio. He stood there, feeling Gistla's hand tighten about his own. And as he said, \"Hello, everybody,\" he felt his breath shorten as though he had suddenly gotten stage fright.  He saw his father turn around. \"What's this?\" Mr. Kenington said, frowning.  \"Hello, Father,\" George said.  \"_Father_,\" Mr. Kenington repeated. \"What are you doing in this patio?\"  \"I brought Gistla back.\"  \"So I see,\" said Mr. Kenington, his eyes narrow as he looked at Gistla. \"Where's George?\"  \"I'm George.\"  \"I'm not in the mood for joking with Venusians,\" his father snapped. \"What made you think you could come in here like this?\"  Gistla's hand tightened again. \"Try to understand,\" George said. \"Gistla--\"  \"What's going on?\" his sister interrupted.  \"Gistla, or whatever her name is,\" Mr. Kenington said, \"has brought a friend of hers, another Venusian.\" He said the word, Venusian, as though it were a curse or a filthy word.  \"My God,\" said his sister, squinting at them.  Mrs. Kenington leaned over in her chair, peering. \"Tell them not to come into the patio, Harry,\" she said to her husband.  \"Listen, Father,\" George said, feeling the panic begin. \"Gistla changed my appearance, so that I seem to look like a Venusian. I came here to tell you that it doesn't make any difference what I look like, whether I look like a Venusian or a leaf on a vine or anything else. I still love her, and it doesn't make any difference.\" He heard his voice rising and becoming louder.  \"My God,\" said his sister, giggling. \"More black magic. Can you make music?\" she asked George.  \"Harry,\" his mother said. \"They frighten me. Can't you make them keep off the patio?\"  \"Mother--\" George began.  \"Now see here,\" Mr. Kenington growled. \"You know we don't allow Venusians around here. I'd advise you to get out of here. Quick!\"  \"Why does he keep calling you father and mother?\" his sister asked. \"Isn't that queer, how he keeps doing that? Make some music,\" she said to George.  George could see the hatred in his father's eyes and in his mother's. And behind his sister's sarcastic smile, he could see the hatred there, too. He felt himself getting more tense, and the panic raced through him.  \"Listen,\" he shouted. \"I'm George, don't you understand? George!\"  \"I don't want to tell you again,\" his father said, his face very red. \"I don't know what your little game is, but it isn't coming off, and so I'll tell you just this one time. You get the hell off this property, or I'll ...\"  \"Listen,\" George yelled. \"I'm _GEORGE_! Don't you understand?\"  His father's lips thinned to a white line, and he began shouting for Joe Finch, the gardener.  George knew what he should have done then, he should have taken Gistla and gone. He should have walked with her, hand in hand, down the road and away from there. But instead, the panic made his heart pound and he saw the hatred all around him. He couldn't help it when he shouted to her, \"Gistla! For God's sake, change me back! Right now! Gistla!\"  He stood there, breathing hard, his muscles knotted like steel, while she stared at him, looking into his eyes.  Suddenly, he heard his father gasp and say, \"_George!_\"  He looked at his hands and they were white and he felt of his face and it was his own. He saw his sister's hand against her mouth, and his father stared at him with unbelieving eyes. His mother had gotten up and was coming over to him, her eyes blinking. \"George,\" she said, \"what did they do to you?\" She patted his shoulder, her hands fluttering like bird wings.  He turned back to Gistla and she was gone. Beyond the gate now, he knew, and walking slowly, alone, down the road. Only this time he would not go after her. He couldn't. And as he stood there, feeling his mother's hand patting his shoulder, hearing his sister say, \"My God,\" seeing his father shake his head slowly, he felt very young and at the same time, very old, and he wanted to cry.
