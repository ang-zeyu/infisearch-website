Dare with determin'd will to burst the portals Past which in terror others fain would steal Now is the time, through deeds, to show that mortals The calm sublimity of gods can feel; To shudder not at yonder dark abyss, Where phantasy creates her own self-torturing brood, Right onward to the yawning gulf to press, Around whose narrow jaws rolleth hell's fiery flood; With glad resolve to take the fatal leap, Though danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep!  Pure crystal goblet! forth I draw thee now, From out thine antiquated case, where thou Forgotten hast reposed for many a year! Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine, To glad the earnest guests was thine, As each to other passed the generous cheer. The gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought, Which he who quaff'd must first in rhyme expound, Then drain the goblet at one draught profound, Hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought. I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now, Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show. Here is a juice, makes drunk without delay; Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill; Let this last draught, the product of my skill, My own free choice, be quaff'd with resolute will, A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day! (He places the goblet to his mouth.) (Tue ringing of bells, and choral voices.)  Chorus of ANGELS  Christ is arisen! Mortal, all hail to thee, Thou whom mortality, Earth's sad reality, Held as in prison.  FAUST  What hum melodious, what clear silvery chime Thus draws the goblet from my lips away? Ye deep-ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime, Announce the solemn dawn of Easter-day? Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort singing, Which once around the darkness of the grave, From seraph-voices, in glad triumph ringing, Of a new covenant assurance gave?  CHORUS OF WOMEN  We, his true-hearted, With spices and myrrh, Embalmed the departed, And swathed him with care; Here we conveyed Him, Our Master, so dear; Alas! Where we laid Him, The Christ is not here.  CHORUS OF ANGELS  Christ is arisen! Blessed the loving one, Who from earth's trial throes, Healing and strengthening woes, Soars as from prison.  FAUST  Wherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong, Come ye a dweller in the dust to seek? Ring out your chimes believing crowds among, The message well I hear, my faith alone is weak; From faith her darling, miracle, hath sprung. Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar, Whence sound the tidings of great joy; And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy, Back it recalleth me to life once more. Then would celestial love, with holy kiss, Come o'er me in the Sabbath's stilly hour, While, fraught with solemn meaning and mysterious Chim'd the deep-sounding bell, and prayer was bliss; A yearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear, Drove me to wander on through wood and field; With heaving breast and many a burning tear, I felt with holy joy a world reveal'd. Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing, This Easter hymn in days of old; And fond remembrance now doth me, with childlike feeling, Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold. O still sound on, thou sweet celestial strain! The tear-drop flows,--Earth, I am thine again!  CHORUS OF DISCIPLES  He whom we mourned as dead, Living and glorious, From the dark grave bath fled, O'er death victorious; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growing powers; Ah! Him on earth we miss; Sorrow and grief are ours. Yearning he left his own, Mid sore annoy; Ah! we must needs bemoan. Master, thy joy!  CHORUS OF ANGELS  Christ is arisen, Redeem'd from decay. The bonds which imprison Your souls, rend away! Praising the Lord with zeal, By deeds that love reveal, Like brethren true and leal Sharing the daily meal, To all that sorrow feel Whisp'ring of heaven's weal, Still is the master near, Still is he here!  BEFORE THE GATE Promenaders of all sorts pass out.  ARTISANS  Why choose ye that direction, pray?  OTHERS  To the hunting-lodge we're on our way.  THE FIRST  We towards the mill are strolling on.  A MECHANIC  A walk to Wasserhof were best.  A SECOND  The road is not a pleasant one.  THE OTHERS  What will you do?  A THIRD  I'll join the rest.  A FOURTH  Let's up to Burghof, there you'll find good cheer, The prettiest maidens and the best of beer, And brawls of a prime sort.  A FIFTH  You scapegrace! How; Your skin still itching for a row? Thither I will not go, I loathe the place.  SERVANT GIRL  No, no! I to the town my steps retrace.  ANOTHER  Near yonder poplars he is sure to be.  THE FIRST  And if he is, what matters it to me! With you he'll walk, he'll dance with none but you, And with your pleasures what have I to do?  THE SECOND  To-day he will not be alone, he said His friend would be with him, the curly-head.  STUDENT  Why how those buxom girls step on! Come, brother, we will follow them anon. Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress'd, Stinging tobacco,--these I love the best.  BURGHER'S DAUGHTER  Look at those handsome fellows there! 'Tis really shameful, I declare, The very best society they shun, After those servant girls forsooth, to run.  SECOND STUDENT (to the first)  Not quite so fast! for in our rear, Two girls, well-dress'd, are drawing near; Not far from us the one doth dwell, And sooth to say, II like her well. They walk demurely, yet you'll see, That they will let us join them presently.  THE FIRST  Not I! restraints of all kinds I detest. Quick! let us catch the wild-game ere it flies, The hand on Saturday the mop that plies, Will on the Sunday fondle you the best.  BURGHER  No, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows, Now, he's in office, daily more arrogant he grows; And for the town, what doth he do for it? Are not things worse from day to day? To more restraints we must submit; And taxes more than ever pay.  BEGGAR (sings)  Kind gentleman and ladies fair, So rosy-cheek'd and trimly dress'd, Be pleas'd to listen to my prayer, Relieve and pity the distress'd. Let me not vainly sing my lay! His heart's most glad whose hand is free. Now when all men keep holiday, Should be a harvest-day to me.  ANOTHER BURGHER  On holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting Than chatting about war and war's alarms, When folk in Turkey, up in arms, Far off, are 'gainst each other fighting. We at the window stand, our glasses drain, And watch adown the stream the painted vessels gliding, Then joyful we at eve come home again, And peaceful times we bless, peace long-abiding.  THIRD BURGHER  Ay, neighbour! So let matters stand for me! There they may scatter one another's brains, And wild confusion round them see-- So here at home in quiet all remains!  OLD WOMAN (to the BURGHERS' DAUGHTERS)  Heyday! How smart! The fresh young blood! Who would not fall in love with you? Not quite so proud! 'Tis well and good! And what you wish, that I could help you to.  BURGHER'S DAUGHTER  Come, Agatha! I care not to be seen Walking in public with these witches. True, My future lover, last St. Andrew's E'en, In flesh and blood she brought before my view.  ANOTHER  And mine she show'd me also in the glass, A soldier's figure, with companions bold; I look around, I seek him as I pass, In vain, his form I nowhere can behold.  SOLDIERS  Fortress with turrets And walls high in air, Damsel disdainful, Haughty and fair, These be my prey! Bold is the venture, Costly the pay!  Hark how the trumpet Thither doth call us, Where either pleasure Or death may befall us. Hail to the tumult! Life's in the field! Damsel and fortress To us must yield. Bold is the venture, Costly the pay! Gaily the soldier Marches away.  FAUST and WAGNER  FAUST  Loosed from their fetters are streams and rills Through the gracious spring-tide's all-quickening glow; Hope's budding joy in the vale doth blow; Old Winter back to the savage hills Withdraweth his force, decrepid now. Thence only impotent icy grains Scatters he as he wings his flight, Striping with sleet the verdant plains; But the sun endureth no trace of white; Everywhere growth and movement are rife, All things investing with hues of life: Though flowers are lacking, varied of dye, Their colours the motly throng supply. Turn thee around, and from this height, Back to the town direct thy sight. Forth from the hollow, gloomy gate, Stream forth the masses, in bright array. Gladly seek they the sun to-day; The Lord's Resurrection they celebrate: For they themselves have risen, with joy,  From tenement sordid, from cheerless room, From bonds of toil, from care and annoy, From gable and roof's o'er-hanging gloom, From crowded alley and narrow street, And from the churches' awe-breathing night, All now have come forth into the light. Look, only look, on nimble feet, Through garden and field how spread the throng, How o'er the river's ample sheet, Many a gay wherry glides along; And see, deep sinking in the tide, Pushes the last boat now away. E'en from yon far hill's path-worn side, Flash the bright hues of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise; This is the people's paradise.  Both great and small send up a cheer; Here am I man, I feel it here.  WAGNER  Sir Doctor, in a walk with you There's honour and instruction too; Yet here alone I care not to resort, Because I coarseness hate of every sort. This fiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest; I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng; They roar as by the evil one possess'd, And call it pleasure, call it song.  PEASANTS (under the linden-tree) Dance and song The shepherd for the dance was dress'd, With ribbon, wreath, and coloured vest, A gallant show displaying. And round about the linden-trees, They footed it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! So fiddle-bow was braying.  Our swain amidst the circle press'd, He push'd a maiden trimly dress'd, And jogg'd her with his elbow; The buxom damsel turn'd her head, \"Now that's a stupid trick!\" she said, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchhesia! Heisa! He! Don't be so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3023"],["title","Faust — Part 1 (#5)"],["body","ude, good fellow!  Swift in the circle they advanced, They danced to right, to left they danced, And all the skirts were swinging. And they grew red, and they grew warm, Panting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! To hip their elbow bringing.  Don't make so free! How many a maid Has been betroth'd and then betray'd; And has repented after! Yet still he flatter'd her aside, And from the linden, far and wide, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Rang fiddle-bow and laughter.  OLD PEASANT  Doctor, 'tis really kind of you, To condescend to come this way, A highly learned man like you, To join our mirthful throng to-day. Our fairest cup I offer you, Which we with sparkling drink have crown'd, And pledging you, I pray aloud, That every drop within its round,  While it your present thirst allays, May swell the number of your days.  FAUST  I take the cup you kindly reach, Thanks and prosperity to each! (The crowd gather round in a circle.)  OLD PEASANT  Ay, truly! 'tis well done, that you Our festive meeting thus attend; You, who in evil days of yore, So often show'd yourself our friend! Full many a one stands living here, Who from the fever's deadly blast, Your father rescu'd, when his skill The fatal sickness stay'd at last. A young man then, each house you sought, Where reign'd the mortal pestilence. Corpse after corpse was carried forth, But still unscath'd you issued thence.  Sore then your trials and severe; The Helper yonder aids the helper here.  ALL  Heaven bless the trusty friend, and long To help the poor his life prolong!  FAUST  To Him above in homage bend, Who prompts the helper and Who help doth send. (He proceeds with WAGNER.)  WAGNER  What feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire, At homage paid thee by this crowd! Thrice blest Who from the gifts by him possessed Such benefit can draw! The sire Thee to his boy with reverence shows; They press around, inquire, advance, Hush'd is the fiddle, check'd the dance. Where thou dost pass they stand in rows, And each aloft his bonnet throws, But little fails and they to thee, As though the Host came by, would bend the knee.  FAUST  A few steps further, up to yonder stone! Here rest we from our walk. In times long past, Absorb'd in thought, here oft I sat alone, And disciplin'd myself with prayer and fast. Then rich in hope, with faith sincere, With sighs, and hands in anguish press'd, The end of that sore plague, with many a tear, From heaven's dread Lord, I sought to wrest. The crowd's applause assumes a scornful tone. Oh, could'st thou in my inner being read, How little either sire or son, Of such renown deserves the meed! My sire, of good repute, and sombre mood, O'er nature's powers and every mystic zone, With honest zeal, but methods of his own, With toil fantastic loved to brood; His time in dark alchemic cell, With brother adepts he would spend, And there antagonists compel, Through numberless receipts to blend. A ruddy lion there, a suitor bold, In tepid bath was with the lily wed. Thence both, while open flames around them roll'd, Were tortur'd to another bridal bed. Was then the youthful queen descried With varied colours in the flask This was our medicine; the patients died, \"Who were restored?\" none cared to ask. With our infernal mixture thus, ere long, These hills and peaceful vales among, We rag'd more fiercely than the pest; Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give; They pined away, I yet must live, To hear the reckless murderers blest.  WAGNER  Why let this thought your soul o'ercast? Can man do more than with nice skill, With firm and conscientious will, Practise the art transmitted from the past? If thou thy sire dost honour in thy youth, His lore thou gladly wilt receive; In manhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth, Then may thy son a higher goal achieve.  FAUST  How blest, in whom the fond desire From error's sea to rise, hope still renews! What a man knows not, that he doth require, And what he knoweth, that he cannot use. But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw O'er the calm beauty of this hour serene! In the rich sunset see how brightly glow Yon cottage homes, girt round with verdant green! Slow sinks the orb, the day is now no more; Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh for a pinion from the earth to soar, And after, ever after him to strive! Then should I see the world below, Bathed in the deathless evening-beams, The vales reposing, every height a-glow, The silver brooklets meeting golden streams. The savage mountain, with its cavern'd side, Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean, Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion, To my rapt vision opes its ample tide! But now at length the god appears to sink; A new-born impulse wings my flight, Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink, The day before me, and behind the night, The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies. Fair dream, it vanish'd with the parting day! Alas! that when on spirit-wing we rise, No wing material lifts our mortal clay. But 'tis our inborn impulse, deep and strong, Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight, When far above us pours its thrilling song The sky-lark, lost in azure light, When on extended wing amain O'er pine-crown'd height the eagle soars, And over moor and lake, the crane Still striveth towards its native shores.  WAGNER  To strange conceits oft I myself must own, But impulse such as this I ne'er have known: Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage, Their wings I envy not the feather'd kind; Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind, Bear us from book to book, from page to page! Then winter nights grow cheerful; keen delight Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll Some old and precious parchment, at the sight All heaven itself descends upon the soul.  FAUST  Thy heart by one sole impulse is possess'd; Unconscious of the other still remain! Two souls, alas! are lodg'd within my breast, Which struggle there for undivided reign: One to the world, with obstinate desire, And closely-cleaving organs, still adheres; Above the mist, the other doth aspire, With sacred vehemence, to purer spheres. Oh, are there spirits in the air, Who float 'twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding, Stoop hither from your golden atmosphere, Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding! A magic mantle did I but possess, Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings, I'd prize it far beyond the costliest dress, Nor would I change it for the robe of kings.  WAGNER  Call not the spirits who on mischief wait! Their troop familiar, streaming through the air, From every quarter threaten man's estate, And danger in a thousand forms prepare! They drive impetuous from the frozen north, With fangs sharp-piercing, and keen arrowy tongue From the ungenial east they issue forth, And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs; If, waft'd on the desert's flaming wing, They from the south heap fire upon the brain, Refreshment from the west at first they bring, Anon to drown thyself and field and plain. In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear; With guileful purpose our behests obey; Like ministers of grace they oft appear, And lisp like angels, to betray. But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend,  The air grows chill, the mists descend! 'Tis in the evening first our home we prize-- Why stand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes? What in the gloom thus moves you?  FAUST  Yon black hound See'st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round?  WAGNER  I've mark'd him long, naught strange in him I see!  FAUST  Note him! What takest thou the brute to be?  WAGNER  But for a poodle, whom his instinct serves His master's track to find once more.  FAUST  Dost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves, He wheels, each circle closer than before? And, if I err not, he appears to me A line of fire upon his track to leave.  WAGNER  Naught but a poodle black of hue I see; 'Tis some illusion doth your sight deceive.  FAUST  Methinks a magic coil our feet around, He for a future snare doth lightly spread.  WAGNER  FAUST  The circle narrows, he's already near!  WAGNER  A dog dost see, no spectre have we here; He growls, doubts, lays him on his belly, too, And wags his tail--as dogs are wont to do.  FAUST  Come hither, Sirrah! join our company!  WAGNER  A very poodle, he appears to be! Thou standest still, for thee he'll wait; Thou speak'st to him, he fawns upon thee straight; Aught thou mayst lose, again he'll bring, And for thy stick will into water spring.  FAUST  Thou'rt right indeed; no traces now I see Whatever of a spirit's agency. 'Tis training.--nothing more.  WAGNER  A dog well taught E'en by the wisest of us may be sought. Ay, to your favour he's entitled too, Apt scholar of the students, 'tis his due! (They enter the gate of the town.)  STUDY FAUST (entering with the poodle)  Now field and meadow I've forsaken; O'er them deep night her veil doth draw; In us the better soul doth waken, With feelings of foreboding awe, All lawless promptings, deeds unholy, Now slumber, and all wild desires; The love of man doth sway us wholly, And love to God the soul inspires.  Peace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me! Why at the threshold snuffest thou so? Behind the stove now quietly lay thee, My softest cushion to thee I'll throw. As thou, without, didst please and amuse me Running and frisking about on the hill, So tendance now I will not refuse thee; A welcome guest, if thou'lt be still.  Ah! when the friendly taper gloweth, Once more within our narrow cell, Then in the heart itself that knoweth, A light the darkness doth dispel. Reason her voice resumes; returneth Hope's gracious bloom, with promise rife; For streams of life the spirit yearneth, Ah! for the very fount of life.  Poodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises. Hallow'd and peaceful, my soul within, Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din. We find it not strange, that man despises What he conceives not; That he the good and fair misprizes-- Finding"]]]
