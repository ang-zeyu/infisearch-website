Now that the northern market was open for the sale of cotton the country merchants of the South were besieged for all these and a hundred other things, and their orders for goods from the North added mightily to the freight piles on the levee at Cairo.  As Guilford Duncan emerged from the alley-way between the cotton bales and reached the street at top of the levee, a still burning fragment of the fireworks fell upon a bale of which the bagging was badly torn, exposing the lint cotton in a way very tempting to fire. With the instinct of the soldier he instantly climbed to the top of the pile, tore away the burning bunches of lint cotton, and threw them to the ground, thus preventing further harm.  As he climbed down again a man confronted him.  \"Are you a watchman?\" asked the man.  \"No, I'm only a man in search of work.\"  \"Why did you do that, then?\" queried the stranger, pointing to the still burning cotton scattered on the ground.  \"On general principles, I suppose,\" answered Duncan. \"There would have been a terrible fire if I hadn't.\"  \"What's your name?\"  \"Guilford Duncan.\"  \"Want work?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What sort?\"  \"Any sort--for good wages.\" That last phrase was the result of his stoker experience.  \"Well, do you want to watch this cotton to-night and see that no harm comes to it, either from fire, or--what's worse--the cotton thieves that go down the alleys, pulling out all the lint they can from the torn bales?\"  \"Yes, if I can have fair wages.\"  \"Will three dollars for the night be fair wages?\"  \"Yes--ample. How far does your freight extend up and down the levee?\"  \"It's pretty nearly all mine, but I have other watchmen on other parts of it. This is a new cargo. Your beat will extend----\" and he gave the young man his boundaries.  \"You'll be off duty at sunrise. Come to me at seven o'clock for your pay. I'm Captain Will Hallam. Anybody in Cairo will tell you where my office is. Good-night.\"  This was an excellent beginning, Duncan thought. Three dollars was more money than he had carried in his pocket at any time since he had bought his suit of clothes at Wheeling. Better still, the promptitude with which employment had thus come to him was encouraging, although the employment was but for a night. And when he reflected that he had won favor by doing what seemed to him an act of ordinary duty, he was disposed to regard the circumstance as another lesson in the new service of work.  The night passed without event of consequence. There were two or three little fires born of the holiday celebration, but Guilford Duncan managed to suppress them without difficulty. Later in the night the swarm of cotton thieves--mainly boys and girls--invaded the levee, with bags conveniently slung over their shoulders. As there were practically no policemen in the town, and as his beat was a large one, young Duncan for a time had difficulty in dealing with these marauders. But after he had arrested half a dozen of them only to find that there were no police officers to whom he could turn them over, he adopted a new plan. He secured a heavy stick from a bale of hay, and with that he clubbed every cotton thief he could catch. As a soldier it was his habit to adapt means to ends; so he hit hard at heads, and seized upon all the stolen goods. It was not long before word was passed among the marauders that there was \"a devil of a fellow\" in charge of that part of the levee, and for the rest of the night the pilferers confined their operations to spaces where a less alert watchfulness gave them better and safer opportunities.  Thus passed Guilford Duncan's first night as a common soldier in the great army of industry.  In the morning, at the hour appointed, he presented himself to Captain Will Hallam, and was taken into that person's private office for an interview.     VI  A CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY OF WORK   Captain Will Hallam Was a Man Of The Very Shrewdest sense, fairly--though not liberally--educated, whose life, from boyhood onward, had been devoted to the task of taking quick advantage of every opportunity that the great river traffic of the fifties had offered to men of enterprise and sound judgment.  Beginning as a barefoot boy--about 1850, or earlier, he never mentioned the date--he had \"run the river\" in all sorts of capacities until, when the war came, temporarily paralyzing the river trade, he had a comfortable little sum of money to the good.  Unable to foresee what the course and outcome of the war might be, he determined, as a measure of prudence, to indulge himself and his little hoard in a period of safe waiting. He converted all his possessions into gold and deposited the whole of it in a Canadian bank, where, while it earned no interest, it was at any rate perfectly safe.  Then he sought and secured a clerkship in the commissary department of the army, living upon the scant salary that the clerkship afforded, and meanwhile acquainting himself in minute detail with the food resources of every quarter of the country, the means and methods of transportation and handling, and everything else that could in any wise aid him in making himself a master in commerce.  Then one day in 1863, when he had satisfied himself that the fortunes of war were definitely turning and that in the end the Union cause was destined to triumph, he made a change.  He resigned his clerkship. He recalled his money from Canada, and considerably increased at least its nominal amount by converting the gold into greatly depreciated greenbacks.  With this capital he opened a commission and forwarding house at Cairo, together with a coal yard, a bank, five wharf boats, half a dozen tugs, an insurance office, a flour mill, and other things. He sent for his brothers to act as his clerks and presently to become his partners.  From the beginning he made money rapidly, and from the beginning he was eagerly on the lookout for opportunities, which in that time of rapid change were abundant. He quickly secured control of nearly all the commission and forwarding business that centered at Cairo. By underbidding the government itself he presently had contracts for all the vast government business of that character.  He was always ready to take up a collateral enterprise that promised results. When the Mississippi River was reopened to commerce by the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, Captain Will Hallam was the first to see and seize the opportunity. He bought everything he could lay his hands on in the way of steamboats and barges, and sent them all upon trading voyages--each under charge of a captain, but each directed by his own masterful mind--up and down the Mississippi, and up and down the Ohio, and up and down every navigable tributary of those great rivers.  This field was quickly made his own, so far as he cared to occupy it. If a rival attempted a competition that might hurt his enterprises, Captain Hallam quietly and quite without a ripple of anger in his voice, dictated some letters to his secretary. Then freight rates suddenly fell almost to the vanishing point, and after a disastrous trip or two, his adversary's steamboats became his own by purchase at low prices, and freight rates went up again. He bore no enmity to the men who thus antagonized him in business and whom he thus conquered. His attitude toward them was precisely that of a soldier toward his enemy. So long as they antagonized him he fought them mercilessly; as soon as they fell into his hands as wounded prisoners, he was ready and eager to do what he could for them.  Those of them who knew the river, and had shown capacity in business, were made steamboat captains in his service, or steamboat clerks, or wharf-boat managers, or agents, or something else--all at fair salaries.  It was Captain Will Hallam's practice to make partners of all men who might render him service in that capacity. Thus when he saw how great a business there must be at Cairo in supplying Pittsburg steam coal to the government fleets on the Mississippi, and to the thousands of other steamboats trafficking in those waters, he went at once to Pittsburg and two days later he had made a certain Captain Red his partner in the control of that vastly rich trade.  Captain Red was the largest owner of the Pittsburg mines, and the pioneer in the business of carrying coal-laden barges in acres and scores of acres down the river, pushing them with stern-wheel steamers of large power, but still of a power insufficient for the accomplishment of the best results.  Captain Red's fleet was unable to control the trade. Captain Hallam pointed out to him the desirability of making it adequate and dominant. Within two days the two had formed a partnership which included a number of New York bankers and investors as unknown and silent stockholders in the enterprise, and an abundant capital was provided. An order was given for the hurried building of the Ajax, the Hector, the Agamemnon, the Hercules, and half a dozen other stern-wheel steamers of power so great that they could not carry the coal needed for their own furnaces, but must tow it in barges alongside.  These powerful steamers were to push vast fleets of coal-laden barges down the river all the way from Pittsburg on the east to St. Louis on the west, and New Orleans on the south. They were to supply, through Hallam's agents, every town along the river and every steamboat that trafficked to any part of it. Hallam was master of it all. Cairo was to be the central distributing point, and if anybody along the river owned a coal mine in Kentucky or Indiana, or elsewhere, he was quickly made to understand that his best means of marketing his product at a profit was to sell it through the Hallam yards at Cairo.  In the meanwhile, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30263"],["title","A Captain in the Ranks: A Romance of Affairs (#7)"],["body"," region after another in the South was conquered by the Union arms, Captain Hallam, whose long river service had brought him into acquaintance with pretty nearly everybody worth knowing south of Cairo, established agents of his own at every point where there was cotton to be bought at extravagant prices, payable in gold, even while the war was going on. These agents bought the cotton, the planters agreeing to deliver it upon the banks of the rivers and leave it there at Hallam's risk. Then Captain Hallam's steamboats, big and little, would push their way up the little rivers, take the cotton on board, and carry it to Cairo.  At Cairo, while the war lasted, there were difficulties to be encountered. Military authority was supreme, and just when the influx of cotton was greatest, military authority arbitrarily decreed that no cotton should be shipped from Cairo to the North or East without a military permit. For a time this decree seriously embarrassed trade. The warehouses in Cairo were choked and glutted with cotton. New ones were built only to be choked in the same way. The levee was piled high with precious bales. Even vacant lots and unoccupied blocks in the low-lying town were rented and made storage places for cotton bales, piled into veritable mountains of wealth. For cotton was worth forty or fifty cents a pound, and even more, at that time, and scores of mills were idle for want of raw material, both in England and in New England, while not a bale could be shipped because the military authorities would issue no permits.  Will Hallam one day set himself down to think this thing out. \"Why do the military authorities deny us shipping permits?\" he asked himself. \"The eastern buyers want the cotton, and we western holders of it want to sell it to them. There is absolutely no military or other good reason why the owner of cotton in one northern city should not be allowed to ship it to other northern cities where it is needed.\" Then he saw a light.  \"The military people, or some of them, want a slice of the profit. That's what's the matter. I don't like to pay a bribe, but in a military time like this, and while Cairo is under martial law, I suppose I must submit to conditions as they are. I'm no theorist or moralist. I'm fairly honest, I think, but I'm a practical business man. Besides, I've a dozen partners interested in this cotton, and I owe it to them to get it off to a market. If I don't, most of them will go to the bowwows, financially. The military authorities have no right to forbid shipment and ruin men in this way, but they have the power and they are exercising it. What's that the Bible says about ploughing with the other fellow's heifer, and making friends with the Mammon of unrighteousness? I always play the game according to the rules, no matter whether I like the rules or not. I'll play this hand in that way.\"  Then turning to his secretary, he said:  \"Call the main office cashier by telegraph and tell him to come to me at once, here at the house.\"  There were no telephones in that day, but Captain Will Hallam was accustomed to say that, living, as he did, in the nineteenth century, he made free use of nineteenth century conveniences in his business. He had laced the little city with telegraph wires, connecting his house not only with his office, and many warehouses, but with the houses of all the chief men in his employ, even to the head drayman. And he exacted of every one of his employees a reasonable facility in the use of the Morse telegraph.  Captain Hallam had many rules for the governance of his own conduct. Among them were these:  \"Never be a fool--look at the practical side of things.  \"Never let anything run away with you--keep cool.  \"Never be in a hurry--make the other fellows do the hustling.  \"Never let the men you work with know what you are doing--they might talk, or they might do a little business on their own account.  \"Never be satisfied with anything as it is--there is always some way of bettering it.  \"Never send good money after bad--it doesn't pay.  \"Never waste energy in regretting a loss--there's a better use for energy.  \"Never hesitate to pay for your education as you get it--use the telegraph freely, and keep in close communication with the men who are likely to know what you want to know.  \"When you want a man to keep still, make it worth his while--but don't say anything to him about it. That opens the way to blackmail.  \"Never take a drink--it unbalances the judgment.  \"Never get angry--that's worse than taking a dozen drinks.  \"Never do anything till you are ready to do it all over and clear through.\"  In obedience to the spirit of these rules, Captain Will Hallam, as soon as he had sent off his telegraphic messages, went out into his garden and hoed a while. Then he called John, his English gardener, and gave him some minute instructions respecting the care of certain plants. John resented the impertinence of course, but he obeyed the instructions, nevertheless. It was the fixed habit of men who worked for Captain Will Hallam to obey his commands.  Presently the cashier presented himself, with check book in hand.  \"Draw a check for five thousand dollars,\" commanded Captain Hallam, \"payable 'to the King of Holland or Bearer'. Mind, I say 'bearer,' _not_ 'order.' Then draw another check for one hundred dollars, payable to yourself.\"  Not another word was said. No explanation of the gift to the cashier was offered or asked. The cashier understood. He drew the checks and his employer signed them. The smaller one he handed to his subordinate. The vastly larger one he thrust into his vest pocket, as he moved around a corner of the piazza to set his little girls swinging in a new contrivance which he had purchased for their use.  Presently he returned to his secretary and said:  \"Telegraph Mr. Kingsbury to make out an application in proper form for a military permit to ship five thousand bales of cotton to New York. Tell him to have it ready for me at two o'clock at the main office.\"  Two hours later Captain Hallam found the application ready for him on his office desk. After looking it over he signed and carefully folded it after the fashion required for military documents, but as he did so he slipped into it the check for five thousand dollars, payable to the \"King of Holland or Bearer.\"  No mention of the check was made in the document. If the proceeding should be resented at headquarters, the enclosure could be excused on the plea of accident.  Then the man of business bade his secretary envelop the package and send it by messenger to military headquarters.  It came back promptly with this endorsement on it:  \"Application denied. The proposed shipment is larger than this office regards as proper _under existing circumstances_.\"  The last three words were heavily and suggestively underscored. Captain Hallam thought he understood. He was in the habit of understanding quickly. He called the cashier, handed him the check, first tearing it into four pieces, and bade him cancel the stub and draw a new check for ten thousand dollars, payable as before, to \"the King of Holland _or Bearer_.\"  Then he endorsed the application with the sentence:  \"As conditions have somewhat changed since this application was rejected, I venture to ask a reconsideration.\"  Half an hour later Captain Hallam was duly and officially notified that his application for permission to ship five thousand bales of cotton was granted.  The check--without endorsement--was cashed next day--the bank teller would never say by whom. But in the meanwhile Captain Hallam had said to his secretary:  \"Telegraph the general freight agent at Chicago for freight cars, as fast as he can let me have them. Say I have five thousand bales of cotton awaiting shipment, with more to come as fast as I can get permits.\"  Then Captain Hallam mounted his horse and rode away for a \"constitutional.\"  All this occurred a year or two before the time of Guilford Duncan's arrival in Cairo; but it was peculiarly characteristic of Captain Hallam's methods and the story of it is illustrative of his ideas.     VII  THE \"SIZING UP\" OF GUILFORD DUNCAN   Captain Will Hallam was quick to make up his mind with regard to a man. He was exceedingly accurate in his human judgments, too, and his confidence in them had been strengthened by experience in successfully acting upon them. As he phrased it, he \"knew how to size a man up,\" and, as the employer of multitudes of men in all parts of the country and in all sorts of capacities, he had daily need of the skill he had acquired in that art. It was as much a part of his equipment for the conduct of his vast and varied enterprises as was his money capital itself.  When young Duncan presented himself in the private office after his night's vigil as a watchman, Captain Hallam asked him to sit. That was a recognition of his social status as something better than his employment of the night before might have suggested. Ordinarily a man employed as a levee watchman would not have been told to come to the private office at all. Nor would such a man have seen anybody higher than a junior clerk in collecting his wages.  But Captain Hallam had been impressed by this newcomer, and he wanted to talk with him.  He broke at once into a catechism.  \"Why did you do that little fire-extinguishing act last night?\"  He asked the question precisely as he might have done if he had resented the saving of his wealth of cotton.  \"Oh, it was simple enough. The fire meant damage, and I was there. So, of course, I put it out.\"  \"But why? The cotton wasn't yours, and you hadn't been hired to watch it.\"  \"No, of course not. But when a gentle----I mean when any decent man sees property afire he doesn't ask whose it is before putting out the blaze.\"  \"You're a Virginian, I should say, from your voice--late of the rebel army. What's your rank?\"  \"None now. I've put the war completely behind me. I'm beginning life anew.\"  \"Good"]]]
