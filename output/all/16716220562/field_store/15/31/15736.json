The gully was of considerable width, as has been said before, though just at that time in the late summer the stream that flowed through it did not appear to be of any great depth, and could be easily forded.  There were bushes and grass and weeds growing all about, besides stray stones that may have fallen there when the solid masonry of the really fine bridge had been constructed years before.  Although he turned his eyes in this quarter and that, Rob failed to see anything that looked at all suspicious. Still that peculiar odor continued to strike his sense of smell, stronger than before, if anything.  \"Must be something burning, fellows!\" announced Tubby, as he held a hand up so that he could close his nose with thumb and finger against the offensive odor.  The guide had meanwhile thrown himself down at the brink of the stream and proceeded to drink his fill. Evidently he had no fear concerning the quality of the water. Typhoid germs were unknown to his lexicon; and so long as water looked fairly clear it suited him.  He was getting on his feet again as Tubby made that last remark. His horse had been pulling more violently than ever at the rein, and the Belgian started to say something uncomplimentary to the animal in Flemish.  Rob had stopped examining the shore upon which they were standing. He turned his gaze across the stream to the opposite bank, for his scout training told him that since the breeze came from that quarter he would be apt to learn the cause of the odor, so like burnt powder, if he followed it up.  The others heard Rob give a half suppressed shout, as though he had made a sudden and startling discovery.  \"Oh! what is it?\" cried Tubby, straining to keep his horse from trying to start up the ascent again.  \"Across the river, over there under the arch of the bridge, don't you see that little curl of blue-white rising?\" exclaimed Rob. \"Watch it and you'll find that it is creeping along over the ground. Come, we've got to get up out of this in a hurry! Turn your horses, and let them help to drag you up! Quick, everybody; not a second to lose, I tell you!\"  Tubby no longer tried to hold his horse back; on the contrary, he even urged the animal to climb the grade in frantic haste. He did not know what it all meant, but Rob acted as though there must be some terrible danger threatening them; and Tubby was no fool.  With cries and shouts they urged the animals to ascend. Several times a horse would slip, and come near falling headlong backward; then it was the one who held the reins found it necessary to encourage the struggling beast with word and act, so that the horse might regain his footing.  Tubby, chancing to glimpse Rob's face about the time they drew near the top was horrified to see how very white it seemed. Then more than ever did he realize that it must be something dreadful that had threatened them.  \"Rob, tell us what it was all about?\" Tubby managed to gasp, when, having reached the road again, they were hurrying back as rapidly as they could go, the horses helping to drag them along.  \"Just this,\" Rob told him briefly. \"They've fixed a mine there under the bridge, so as to blow it up; and we've had the narrowest escape of our lives!\"     CHAPTER VI.  GETTING NEAR THE WAR ZONE.   \"Hold on to your horses, everybody!\" called out Merritt, as he looked back toward the bridge from which they had now managed to press quite a little distance.  Merritt somehow did not seem to be very much astonished at what Rob had said. It might be he himself had entertained suspicions along those same lines.  They had heard that the determined Belgians were engaged in throwing all the obstacles possible in the way of an advance in force on the part of the invaders. If only cavalry were to be dealt with, the defenders of the soil had faith in their ability to take care of all that could be sent against them; but it was known to be a fact that the artillery arm was what the Germans meant to depend on more than anything else in this war for conquest.  If bridges and culverts were destroyed in every direction before the enemy could take possession of the roads, it would be next to impossible to move the great siege guns until some sort of strong temporary structure had been built in place of the stone and steel fabrics that were blown up.  And so, for days, there had been reports drifting in to Antwerp that certain bridges had been marked for destruction. Those who sallied forth in armored cars to speed over the country, and play havoc with their Maxim guns, found it necessary to revise their map of the district every night so as to conform to the new changes that had been wrought.  It was hardly ten seconds after Merritt told them to keep a firm grip on the bridles of their horses that the boys on looking back saw the bridge suddenly rear itself in the air. Then came a terrifying boom that made the very ground under their feet quiver; and, in a moment later, in place of the fine bridge lay a horrible gap, from which smoke and dust was arising in sickening clouds.  Tubby was as white as a sheet. The others could hear the big sigh with which he drew in a gulp of air.  \"I want to say right here,\" he started to remark solemnly, \"that I'm thankful I've got such a cracking good nose for queer odors. Think what might have happened to us if I hadn't begun to sniff around, and made Rob take notice. All that pile of stuff would have buried us out of sight. And the horses knew, sure they did. That explains why they acted so funny all the while. But isn't it a shame to see how they had to smash that splendid bridge!\"  \"Don't forget that this is war, Tubby,\" Merritt told him, \"and to hinder the enemy from coming up, anything is allowable.\"  \"But that's going to block our going on, I take it,\" ventured Tubby, watching Anthony, who showed evidences of having been considerably excited by the explosion, though Tubby could not tell whether it was fear that influenced the man, or an overmastering desire to join the army, and engage in some of this obstructive work himself.  \"Oh! that doesn't follow,\" Rob assured him. \"I noticed that the river was shallow just now; and I imagined I could see the old ford that used to answer before this bridge was ever thought of. We can get across without swimming. You forded the Rio Grande once upon a time, Tubby, and such a little bug stream as this shouldn't phase you a bit.\"  \"Oh! count on me going wherever the rest of you lead,\" retorted Tubby, with a blustering air, as though he did not want anyone to think him at all timid.  \"We might as well go back now,\" remarked Rob, \"and see about getting over. If the mine has been exploded, there shouldn't be any danger; I want to try that ford.\"  It was found that though the bridge was wrecked pretty badly, the greatest damage was to the span, and not so much to the anchorages or piers. In time another arch could be built--should peace ever come to this distracted land--when men would be able to once more \"beat their swords into ploughshares,\" and start to rebuilding what had been destroyed.  \"Follow after me,\" Rob told them, as he started to urge his horse across where he could see the old ford had been.  Little of the material from the wrecked bridge had been thrown to any distance, so the ford was not blocked. The horses still displayed more or less restlessness, as though they could not understand that, with such a smell of choking gases in the air, the danger was all over. The three boys, however, had had considerable experience in handling balky animals, and knew just how to urge them on.  Once on the other side, they started up the bank. As they arrived at the road, having crossed the abyss, they saw a crowd of men hurrying toward the spot. They were partly Belgian soldiers, it turned out, along with some civilians, possibly men versed in explosives or strategy to be employed to delay the advance of the German artillery.  Of course, they were very much excited at meeting the boys. The khaki uniforms seemed to soften their anger to some extent, but one who appeared to be in authority started to scold them for walking so blindly into a trap.  Through the guide Rob hastened to explain how it came they had not suspected the truth. Then as questions began to follow, he also told who and what they were, even mentioning something concerning their self-imposed mission into the danger zone of the fighting.  When the precious passport, written out by the good burgomaster, was shown, it had an additional soothing effect. The man in charge of the squad of destruction smiled and nodded as he perused the document, written in French.  \"He say burgomaster his uncle!\" explained Antonio, after the other had handed the paper back, and made some remark.  \"Well, now, that's what I call fine. Tell him we're glad we got out from under that bridge in time,\" said Rob, \"and also that we think he made a clean sweep of the job.\"  This seemed to please the Belgian officer, for he insisted on shaking hands all around. Feeling that they were now free to proceed, the scouts resumed their journey along the road that led to Brussels; probably, wholly in the hands of the invaders further on toward the capital, since rumor had it that immense numbers of German troops were daily being moved toward Ghent.  \"All of which only goes to show how necessary it is to be constantly on the watch while you're in a country that's fighting for its life,\" Merritt remarked to his companions as they lost sight of the ruined bridge.  \"If only we had eyes in the back of our heads, we might get along a heap better, I think,\" grumbled Tubby, as his horse awkwardly stumbled over some small object, and gave him a shock.  \"It was a close call, all right,\" acknowledged Merritt, \"and has sobered our guide a whole lot, I notice. He listens to every far-off boom now, as though something might be drawing him. But the morning is wearing away, so I "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29991"],["title","The Boy Scouts on Belgian Battlefields (#7)"],["body","that we stop at the very first village we come to, and see if we can beg, buy, or steal something to eat. I'm hungry as a bear.\"  \"Oh! bless you, Merritt, for those kind words!\" called out Tubby. \"I've felt a vacuum down around my belt line for two hours back. Whoa! there!\" he added, as his horse stumbled again. \"Want to break my neck, you animated skeleton? He knocks his hoofs together every third step he takes. No wonder they didn't grab him for the cavalry; he'd have fallen all over himself in the first charge.\"  Coming to a little hamlet, the boys found a house where they could secure something in the way of a lunch. Even at this early stage in the war, however, prudent hotel keepers realized that times were going to be hard, and that it would be the part of wisdom to conceal all the stores possible against a rainy day, or the raids of such invaders who might be billeted upon the villagers.  Here the boys remained between one and two hours, since the day was unusually hot, and their mounts were not in the best of condition for standing hard service.  Some of the good people had left for safer quarters, which would mean Antwerp, of course,--deemed impossible of capture at that day on account of its wonderful defenses. A group gathered in front of the little hotel, and questioned Anthony as to who the three boys in the uniform of scouts might be, and of the nature of their mission that tempted them to invade a region being made desolate by war.  Anthony himself knew very little on that score; but since it would not look well for him to admit this fact, it is possible he \"drew the long bow\" to some extent. He may even have told all sorts of fairy stories about the boys being English agents sent over to learn facts in connection with the movements of the German army, so that a strong force of the allies from across the Channel could be hastily dispatched to the scene, and chase the haughty Germans back across the Rhine.  Some idea like this the boys found very prevalent all through their journey. The Belgians seemed to believe the English were getting a wonderful surprise ready with which to stagger the enemy. If they could have only known how an army had to be built up step by step in the great island country, they might have felt less confidence, and perhaps shown more discretion in attacking the invaders.  Rob suspected something of this sort when he saw the way the villagers observed him and two chums, staring at them as though they were curiosities.  \"Makes you feel like some punkins, to have all these people watch every little thing you do, and get out of your way so quick when you go to make a move, don't it?\" remarked Tubby, evidently tickled over the attention shown them.  \"I don't just like it, to tell you the truth,\" admitted Merritt.  \"Oh! you're too modest by half, Merritt!\" jeered the fat scout.  \"It isn't that, Tubby,\" explained the other. \"Rob here says he believes our guide is spreading the report that we're English messengers, sent ahead to pick up news about the Germans, so they can be smashed when the British army gets here.\"  \"Well, what of that?\" demanded his friend. \"It isn't so _very_ dreadful that I can see, to be mistaken for a Johnny Bull.\"  \"You'll change your tune, my boy,\" Rob told him, \"if the Germans should come along and nab us. We'll soon see how you begin to roar out that you're a Yankee, as true-blue as they make them.\"  \"Oh! but they wouldn't know anything about that!\" declared Tubby, though showing signs of increasing dismay at the same time.  \"You never can tell,\" he was told by Rob. \"The ways of these smart Germans are past finding out. They've got spies everywhere. Right now there may be some secret sympathizer with the Fatherland in that bunch close by, taking in all that silly Anthony has been saying.\"  \"Gingersnaps and popguns!\" gasped Tubby, \"if that's really so I guess we'd better muzzle our guide in a hurry. Where's he gone to, do you think, Rob? It was all of half an hour ago that I saw him last, talking to the crowd.\"  \"I was wondering about that myself,\" said Merritt. \"If we expect to be getting along about this time, we ought to look Anthony up.\"  \"You take a turn that way, and I'll step into the taproom of the inn, to see if he is there,\" remarked Rob, who had a slight frown on his face as he spoke, as if he might not be wholly satisfied with the way in which their guide was acting.  Five minutes later Rob and Merritt joined Tubby at the same time.  \"Nothing doing in my section,\" remarked Merritt, \"except that I'm afraid somebody has swiped one of our nags, for I could only count three horses hitched there.\"  \"Then, that settles it!\" said Rob positively.  \"Settles what?\" piped up Tubby.  \"Anthony has basely deserted us, and taken to the back road!\" Rob told them. \"I feared as much from what the little inn proprietor let out; but what you say clinches the thing. Our guide is a mile or more on the way back to Antwerp by now!\"     CHAPTER VII.  THE DESERTION OF ANTHONY.   \"The miserable hound! Hanging would be too good for him!\" exclaimed Merritt, who it appeared had not up to that instant suspected anything like the truth, and was therefore taken completely by surprise.  \"That all depends on what his motive may have been,\" said Rob reflectively.  \"Why, it's plain he got cold feet after that little experience at the bridge this morning!\" Merritt hastened to declare. \"I thought he was a man of more nerve than that. I hope all Belgians are not made of the same kind of stuff.\"  \"Hold on a minute, Merritt,\" Rob cautioned him, \"you are jumping to conclusions now without being sure of your ground. I've been watching Anthony from time to time and I've noticed that whenever he happened to speak of the gallant doings of his people on the battlefields his face would beam with pride, and what I took to be a touch of envy.\"  \"Oh!\" said Tubby, grasping the idea, \"then, Rob, you think our guide shook us just because he couldn't hold back any longer. He thought he ought to be on the firing line along with the rest, and get in a crack at the invaders of his country. Is that the stuff, Rob?\"  \"I'm thinking that way,\" Rob informed him gravely, \"but we've got no time to look Anthony up. Whether he's gone to join the Belgian army or turned back to the city of Antwerp isn't going to cut any figure in our calculations.\"  \"That's about the size of it, Rob,\" agreed Merritt, beginning to show signs of returning confidence, when the patrol leader spoke with such vim.  \"What we've got to do is to figure out whether we want to call the whole thing off just because we haven't a guide to do the talking business for us and turn back to the city, or set our teeth together and push on.\"  Tubby and Merritt exchanged looks.  The latter even half opened his mouth as if to indignantly protest against giving up the most cherished plan of his life for a little snag, such as the desertion of Anthony proved. Then he suddenly closed his lips firmly. He had remembered an important fact, which was that after all he should not be the one to make such a suggestion. Let one of these good chums, who were his side partners, express an opinion first of all. That was why Merritt remained silent.  \"Oh! we just can't quit at the first puff!\" remonstrated Tubby. \"Fellows who have been through all we have shouldn't be built that way. Think of the battles we've been up against on the diamond and the gridiron; and did anybody ever hear us complain, or show a yellow streak? Well, I guess not! Tell him how you feel about it, Rob!\"  \"Just as you do, Tubby,\" responded the scout leader heartily. \"I wasn't counting any too much on Anthony's services, come to speak of it. Nine-tenths of what we expected to accomplish would have to come from our own hard work. If you put it up to me to decide, I say every time, go ahead!\"  Merritt looked almost joyous. Though he was not a demonstrative fellow as a rule, he could not help reaching out and squeezing a hand of each of his faithful chums. Indeed, no one ever knew more reliable allies than Merritt possessed in Rob and Tubby, who were ready to go through fire and water with him, if necessary.  \"It may all turn out for the best,\" Tubby continued, with fine optimism, such as these chubby fellows nearly always show since life looks rosy to them. \"And it's going to save you a little money in the bargain, too, Merritt. I must brush up my French and Flemish from now on. Already I can say as many as six words of the first, and I think I know how to almost pronounce one in Flemish.\"  \"No trouble to tell what that one is,\" remarked Rob, laughing.  \"It stands for grub!\" added Merritt.  \"Now, I consider it strange how you should guess so easily,\" Tubby shot back at them reproachfully. \"I suppose I'll have to acknowledge the corn. We've got to eat to live, and so I thought I ought to know the right word that would produce results quickest. Don't blame me, boys; I was thinking of you as well as myself.\"  \"Well, shall we get out of here?\" asked Rob. \"I don't altogether like the way we are being stared at by some of the people of the village. They say in Antwerp that there's a hidden sympathizer of the Germans in every city, town and hamlet through the whole of Belgium always trying to send information of value to the enemy.\"  \"Huh! don't know just what to believe, and what to brand as big yarns,\" protested Tubby. \"Since we've landed here I've heard stories that would make poor old Baron Munchausen hide his head in shame as a has-been. If one-tenth of the same turned out to be true, these Germans are the most remarkable people that ever lived for getting ready for a war against the whole world forty years ahead of the date. I'm beginning to use my own horse-sense, and figure things out.\"  Ten minutes later they turned their backs on the little hamlet where a fair meal had been procured, and which had also witnessed their first real misfortune in the base desertion of Anthony.
