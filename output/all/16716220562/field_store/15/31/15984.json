I am hopeful that, in the near future--\"  \"Well,\" Malone cut in desperately, \"sure. Of course. Naturally.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. O'Connor looked miffed. The temperature of the room seemed to drop several degrees, and Malone swallowed hard and tried to look ingratiating and helpful, like a student with nothing but A's on his record.  Before O'Connor could pick up the thread of his sentence, Malone went on: \"What I mean is something like this. Picking up the mental activity of another person is called telepathy. Floating in the air is called levitation. Moving objects around is psychokinesis. Going from one place to another instantaneously is teleportation. And so on.\"  \"The language you use,\" O'Connor said, still miffed, \"is extremely loose. I might go so far as to say that the statements you have made are, essentially, meaningless as a result of their lack of rigor.\"  Malone took a deep breath. \"Dr. O'Connor,\" he said, \"you know what I mean, don't you?\"  \"I believe so,\" O'Connor said, with the air of a king granting a pardon to a particularly repulsive-looking subject in the lowest income brackets.  \"Well, then,\" Malone said. \"Yes or no?\"  O'Connor frowned. \"Yes or no what?\" he said.  \"I\" Malone blinked. \"I meant, the things have names,\" he said at last. \"All the various psionic manifestations have names.\"  \"Ah,\" O'Connor said. \"Well. I should say.\" He put his fingertips together and stared at a point on the white ceiling for a second. \"Yes,\" he said at last.  Malone breathed a sigh of relief. \"Good,\" he said. \"That's what I wanted to know.\" He leaned forward. \"And if they all do have names,\" he went on, \"what is it called, when a large group of people are forced to act in a certain manner?\"  O'Connor shrugged. \"Forced?\" he said.  \"Forced by mental power,\" Malone said.  There was a second of silence.  \"At first,\" O'Connor said, \"I might think of various examples: the actions of a mob, for example, or the demonstrations of the Indian Rope Trick, or perhaps the sale of a useless product through television or through other advertising.\" Again his face moved, ever so slightly, in what he obviously believed to be a smile. \"The usual name for such a phenomenon is 'mass hypnotism,' Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"But that is not, strictly speaking, a _psi_ phenomenon at all. Studies in that area belong to the field of mob psychology; they are not properly in my scope.\" He looked vastly superior to anything and everything that was outside his scope. Malone concentrated on looking receptive and understanding.  \"Yes?\" he said.  O'Connor gave him a look that made Malone feel he'd been caught cribbing during an exam, but the scientist said nothing to back up the look. Instead, he went on: \"I will grant that there may be an amplification of the telepathic faculty in the normal individual in such cases.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said doubtfully.  \"Such an amplification,\" O'Connor went on, as if he hadn't heard, \"would account for the apparent ... ah ... mental linkage that makes a mob appear to act as a single organism during certain periods of ... ah ... stress.\" He looked judicious for a second, and then nodded. \"However,\" he said, \"other than that, I would doubt that there is any psionic force involved.\"  Malone spent a second or two digesting O'Connor's reply. \"Well,\" he said at last, \"I'm not sure that's what I meant. I mean, I'm not sure I meant to ask that question.\" He took a breath and decided to start all over. \"It's not like a mob,\" he said, \"with everybody all doing the same thing at the same time. It's more like a group of men, all separated, without any apparent connections between any of the men. And they're all working toward a common goal. All doing different things, but all with the same objective. See?\"  \"Of course I do,\" O'Connor said flatly. \"But what you're suggesting--\" He looked straight at Malone. \"Have you had any experience of this ... phenomenon?\"  \"Experience?\" Malone said.  \"I believe you have had,\" O'Connor said. \"Such a concept could not have come to you in a theoretical manner. You must be involved with an actual situation very much like the one you describe.\"  Malone swallowed. \"Me?\" he said.  \"Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"May I remind you that this is Yucca Flats? That the security checks here are as careful as anywhere in the world? That I, myself, have top-security clearance for my special projects? You do not need to watch your words here.\"  \"It's not security,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, it's not only security. But things are pretty complicated.\"  \"I assure you,\" O'Connor said, \"that I will be able to understand even events which you feel are complex.\"  Malone swallowed again, hard. \"I didn't mean--\" he started.  \"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. His voice was colder than usual. Malone had the feeling that he was about to take the extra chair away. \"Go on,\" O'Connor said. \"Explain yourself.\"  Malone took a deep breath. He started with the facts he'd been told by Burris, and went straight through to the interviews of the two computer-secretary technicians by Boyd and Company.  It took quite a while. By the time he had finished, O'Connor wasn't looking frozen any more; he'd apparently forgotten to keep the freezer coils running. Instead, his face showed frank bewilderment, and great interest. \"I never heard of such a thing,\" he said. \"Never. Not at any time.\"  \"But--\"  O'Connor shook his head. \"I have never heard of a psionic manifestation on that order,\" he said. It seemed to be a painful admission. \"Something that would make a random group of men co-operate in that manner--why, it's completely new.\"  \"It is?\" Malone said, wondering if, when it was all investigated and described, it might be called O'Connorizing. Then he wondered how anybody was going to go about investigating it and describing it, and sank even deeper into gloom.  [Illustration]  \"Completely new,\" O'Connor said. \"You may take my word.\" Then, slowly, he began to brighten again, with all the glitter of newly-formed ice. \"As a matter of fact,\" he said, in a tone more like his usual one, \"Mr. Malone, I don't think it's possible.\"  \"But it happened,\" Malone said. \"It's still happening. All over.\"  O'Connor's lips tightened. \"I have given my opinion,\" he said. \"I do not believe that such a thing is possible. There must be some other explanation.\"  \"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. \"I'll bite. What is it?\"  O'Connor frowned. \"Your levity,\" he said, \"is uncalled-for.\"  Malone shrugged. \"I didn't mean to be--\" he paused. \"Anyhow, I didn't mean to be funny,\" he went on. \"But I would like to have another idea of what's causing all this.\"  \"Scientific theories,\" O'Connor said sternly, \"are not invented on the spur of the moment. Only after long, careful thought--\"  \"You mean you can't think of anything,\" Malone said.  \"There must be some other explanation,\" O'Connor said. \"Naturally, since the facts have only now been presented to me, it is impossible for me to display at once a fully constructed theory.\"  Malone nodded slowly. \"O.K.,\" he said. \"Have you got any hints, then? Any ideas at all?\"  O'Connor shook his head. \"I have not,\" he said. \"But I strongly suggest, Mr. Malone, that you recheck your data. The fault may very well lie in your own interpretations of the actual facts.\"  \"I don't think so,\" Malone said.  O'Connor grimaced. \"I do,\" he said firmly.  Malone sighed, very faintly. He shifted in the chair and began to realize, for the first time, just how uncomfortable it really was. He also felt a little chilly, and the chill was growing. That, he told himself, was the effect of Dr. O'Connor. He no longer regretted wearing his hat. As a matter of fact, he thought wistfully for a second of a small, light overcoat.  O'Connor, he told himself, was definitely not the warm, friendly type.  \"Well, then,\" he said, conquering the chilly feeling for a second, \"maybe there's somebody else. Somebody who knows something more about psionics, and who might have some other ideas about--\"  \"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"The United States Government would hardly have chosen me had I not been uniquely qualified in my field.\"  Malone sighed again. \"I mean ... maybe there are some books on the subject,\" he said quietly, hoping he sounded tactful. \"Maybe there's something I could look up.\"  \"Mr. Malone.\" The temperature of the office, Malone realized, was definitely lowering. O'Connor's built-in freezer coils were working overtime, he told himself. \"The field of psionics is so young that I can say, without qualification, that I am acquainted with everything written on the subject. By that, of course, I mean scientific works. I do not doubt that the American Society for Psychical Research, for instance, has hundreds of crackpot books which I have never read, or even heard of. But in the strictly scientific field, I must say that--\"  He broke off, looking narrowly at Malone with what might have been concern, but looked more like discouragement and boredom.  \"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"are you ill?\"  Malone thought about it. He wasn't quite sure, he discovered. The chill in the office was bothering him more and more, and as it grew he began to doubt that it was all due to the O'Connor influence. Suddenly a distinct shudder started somewhere in the vicinity of his shoulders and rippled its way down his body.  Another one followed it, and then a third.  \"Me?\" Malone said. \"I'm ... I'm all right.\"  \"You seem to have contracted a chill,\" O'Connor said.  A fourth shudder followed the other three.  \"I ... guess so,\" Malone said. \"I d-d ... I do s-seem to be r-r-rather chilly.\"  O'Connor nodded. \"Ah,\" he said. \"I thought so. Although a chill is certainly odd at seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit.\" He looked at the thermometer just outside the window of his office, then turned back to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30434"],["title","Occasion for Disaster (#8)"],["body","ne. \"Pardon me,\" he said. \"Seventy-one point six.\"  \"Is ... is that all it is?\" Malone said. Seventy-one point six degrees, or even seventy-two, hardly sounded like the broiling Nevada desert he'd expected.  \"Of course,\" O'Connor said. \"At nine o'clock in the morning, one would hardly expect great temperatures. The desert becomes quite hot during the day, but cools off rapidly; I assume you are familiar with the laws covering the system.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"S-sure.\"  The chills were not getting any better. They continued to travel up and down his body with the dignified regularity of Pennsylvania Railroad commuter trains.  O'Connor frowned for a second. It was obvious that his keen scientific eye was sizing up the phenomenon, and reporting events to his keen scientific brain. In a second or less, the keen scientific brain had come up with an answer, and Dr. O'Connor spoke in his very keenest scientific voice.  \"I should have warned you,\" he said, without an audible trace of regret. \"The answer is childishly simple, Mr. Malone. You left Washington at noon.\"  \"Just a little before noon,\" Malone said. Remembering the burning sun, he added: \"High noon. Very high.\"  \"Just so,\" O'Connor said. \"And not only the heat was intense; the humidity, I assume, was also high.\"  \"Very,\" Malone said, thinking back. He shivered again.  \"In Washington,\" O'Connor said, \"it was noon. Here it is nine o'clock, and hardly as warm. The atmosphere is quite arid, and about twenty degrees below that obtaining in Washington.\"  Malone thought about it, trying to ignore the chills. \"Oh,\" he said at last. \"And all the time I thought it was you.\"  \"What?\" O'Connor leaned forward.  \"Nothing,\" Malone said hastily.  \"My suggestion,\" O'Connor said, putting his fingertips together again, \"is that you take off your clothes, which are undoubtedly damp, and--\"  Naturally, Malone had not brought any clothes to Yucca Flats to change into. And when he tried to picture himself in a spare suit of Dr. O'Connor's, the picture just wouldn't come. Besides, the idea of doing a modified strip-tease in, or near, the O'Connor office was thoroughly unattractive.  \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"thanks a lot, doctor, but no thanks. I really have a better idea.\"  \"Better?\" O'Connor said.  \"Well, I--\" Malone took a deep breath and shut his eyes.  He heard Dr. O'Connor say: \"Well, Mr. Malone--good-by. And good luck.\"  Then the office in Yucca Flats was gone, and Malone was standing in the bedroom of his own apartment, on the fringes of Washington, D. C.   IV  He walked over to the wall control and shut off the air-conditioning in a hurry. He threw open a window and breathed great gulps of the hot, humid air from the streets. In a small corner at the back of his mind, he wondered why he was grateful for the air he had suffered under only a few minutes before. But that, he reflected, was life. And a very silly kind of life, too, he told himself without rancor.  In a few minutes he left the window, somewhat restored, and headed for the shower. When it was running nicely and he was under it, he started to sing. But his voice didn't sound as much like the voice of Lauritz Melchior as it usually did, not even when he made a brave, if foolhardy stab at the Melchior accent. Slowly, he began to realize that he was bothered.  He climbed out of the shower and started drying himself. Up to now, he thought, he had depended on Dr. Thomas O'Connor for edifying, trustworthy and reasonably complete information about psionics and _psi_ phenomena in general. He had looked on O'Connor as a sort of living version of an extremely good edition of the _Britannica_, always available for reference.  And now O'Connor had failed him. That, Malone thought, was hardly fair. O'Connor had no business failing him--particularly when there was no place else to go.  The scientist had been right, of course, Malone knew. There was no other scientist who knew as much about psionics as O'Connor, and if O'Connor said there were no books, then that was that: there were no books.  He reached for a drawer in his dresser, opened it and pulled out some underclothes, humming tunelessly under his breath as he dressed. If there was no one to ask, he thought, and if there were no books--  He stopped with a sock in his hand, and stared at it in wonder. O'Connor hadn't said there were no books. As a matter of fact, Malone realized, he'd said exactly the opposite.  There were books. But they were \"crackpot\" books. O'Connor had never read them. He had, he said, probably never even heard of many of them.  \"Crackpot\" was a fighting word to O'Connor. But to Malone it had all the sweetness of flattery. After all, he'd found telepaths in insane asylums, and teleports among the juvenile delinquents of New York. \"Crackpot\" was a word that was rapidly ceasing to have any meaning at all in Malone's mind.  He realized that he was still staring at the sock, which was black with a gold clock. Hurriedly, he put it on, and finished dressing. He reached for the phone and made a few fast calls, and then teleported himself to his locked office in FBI Headquarters, on East Sixty-ninth Street in New York. He let himself out, and strolled down the corridor. The agent-in-charge looked up from his desk as Malone passed, blinked, and said: \"Hello, Malone. What's up now?\"  \"I'm going prowling,\" Malone said. \"But there won't be any work for you, as far as I can see.\"  \"Oh?\"  \"Just relax,\" Malone said. \"Breathe easy.\"  \"I'll try to,\" the agent-in-charge said, a little sadly. \"But every time you show up, I think about that wave of red Cadillacs you started. I'll never feel really secure again.\"  \"Relax,\" Malone said. \"Next time it won't be Cadillacs. But it might be spirits, blowing on ear-trumpets. Or whatever it is they do.\"  \"Spirits, Malone?\" the agent-in-charge said.  \"No, thanks,\" Malone said sternly. \"I never drink on duty.\" He gave the agent a cheery wave of his hand and went out to the street.         *       *       *       *       *  The Psychical Research Society had offices in the Ravell Building, a large structure composed mostly of plate glass and anodized aluminum that looked just a little like a bright blue, partially transparent crackerbox that had been stood on end for purposes unknown. Having walked all the way down to this box on Fifty-sixth Street, Malone had recovered his former sensitivity range to temperature and felt pathetically grateful for the coolish sea breeze that made New York somewhat less of an unbearable Summer Festival than was normal.  The lobby of the building was glittering and polished, as if human beings could not possibly exist in it. Malone took an elevator to the sixth floor, stepped out into a small, equally polished hall, and hurriedly looked off to his right. A small door stood there, with a legend engraved in elegantly small letters. It said:            _The Psychical Research Society_                       _Push_  Malone obeyed instructions. The door swung noiselessly open, and then closed behind him.  He was in a large square-looking room which had a couch and chair set at one corner, and a desk at the far end. Behind the desk was a brass plate, on which was engraved:              _The Psychical Research Society_                      _Main Offices_  To Malone's left was a hall that angled off into invisibility, and to the left of the desk was another one, going straight back past doors and two radiators until it ran into a right-angled turn and also disappeared.  Malone took in the details of his surroundings almost automatically, filing them in his memory just in case he ever needed to use them.  One detail, however, required more than automatic attention. Sitting behind the desk, her head just below the brass plaque, was a redhead. She was, Malone thought, positively beautiful. Of course, he could not see the lower two-thirds of her body, but if they were half as interesting as the upper third and the face and head, he was willing to spend days, weeks or even months on their investigation. Some jobs, he told himself, feeling a strong sense of duty, were definitely worth taking time over.  She was turned slightly away from Malone, and had obviously not heard him come in. Malone wondered how best to announce himself, and regretfully gave up the idea of tiptoeing up to the girl, placing his hands over her eyes, kissing the back of her neck and crying: \"Surprise!\" It was elegant, he felt, but it just wasn't right.  He compromised at last on the old established method of throat-clearing to attract her attention. He was sure he could take it from there, to an eminently satisfying conclusion.  He tiptoed on the deep-pile rug right up to her desk.  And the expected happened.  He sneezed.  The sneeze was loud and long, and it echoed through the room and throughout the corridors. It sounded to Malone like the blast of a small bomb, or possibly a grenade. Startled himself by the volume of sound he had managed to generate, he jumped back.  The girl had jumped, too--but her leap had been straight upward, about an inch and a half. She came down on her chair and reached up a hand. The hand wiped the back of her neck with a slow, lingering motion of complete loathing. Then, equally slowly, she turned.  \"That,\" she said in a low, sweet voice, \"was a dirty trick.\"  \"It was an accident,\" Malone said.  She regarded Malone darkly. \"Do you always do that to strangers? Is it some new sort of perversion?\"  \"I have never done such a thing before,\" Malone said sternly.  \"Oh,\" the girl said. \"An experimenter. Avid for new sensations. Probably a jaded scion of a rich New York family.\" She paused. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"Is it fun?\"  Malone opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He shut it, thought for a second and then tried again. He got as far as: \"I--\" before Nemesis overtook him. The second sneeze was even louder and more powerful than the first had been.  \"It must be fun,\" the girl said acidly, producing a handkerchief"]]]
