Among the prisoners captured were a son of General O. M. Mitchell, and our old acquaintance, Lieutenant Haines.  The prisoners were all paroled, and were astonished at the kind treatment they received. Both Captain Jumper, who was in charge of the wagon-train, and the son of General Mitchell were loud in their praise of the way they were used by Morgan.  After destroying all the Federal property captured, and damaging the railroad as much as possible, the command continued on their raid, their route taking them by the plantation of Mr. Osborne. The welcome they received there was a royal one. Colonel Morgan stopped and took dinner with the family.  Here he heard of the adventure of Calhoun, and he laughed long and heartily over the way Calhoun had recovered his horse.  “Tell him,” said Miss Osborne, “that I forgive him his abrupt leaving, as no harm came to father. By the way, Lieutenant Haines has become quite friendly, coming out to see us two or three times.”  “No one can blame him, even if you give him but a moment of your company,” replied Morgan, gallantly. “But Miss Osborne, I am sorry to say we took your friend prisoner. He was paroled, and no doubt is now on his way North.”  Miss Osborne blushed, and then said, “A good riddance; I trust I shall never see him again. But he was kind to papa. He even returned the horse; would not keep him.”  “That is lucky,” responded Morgan, “for if he hadn’t been returned, one of my men would be riding him now, and your chance of getting him would be small.”  From Pulaski Morgan pushed northeast, avoiding Shelbyville and Murfreesboro, both of these places being too strongly garrisoned for him to attack with his small force. He crossed the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad ten miles north of Murfreesboro, burned the depot, and destroyed as much of the track as his limited time would admit. From there he rode straight for Lebanon, Tennessee, which place he reached just at nightfall. The inhabitants received him with the wildest demonstration of joy. But trouble was in store for him. His men, wearied with their long ride, and elated over their continued success, became careless. They knew they were among friends, and thought that no harm could come to them, so they slept without fear.  The Federal authorities had become thoroughly alarmed over his progress. Strong bodies of troops were in swift pursuit, from Shelbyville, from Murfreesboro, and from Nashville.  Just before daylight the Federals charged into the little city with whoop and hurrah. Taken entirely by surprise, Morgan’s men thought only of flight. Two companies under the command of Colonel Robert C. Wood being cut off from their horses, threw themselves into a college building in the outskirts of the city, and for three hours defended themselves with desperation. At last being out of ammunition they were forced to surrender.  In this unfortunate affair Morgan lost nearly two hundred of his best troops. The rest were more or less scattered. He himself was chased for eighteen miles, and the pursuit ceased only when he, with the remnant of his troops, had crossed the Cumberland.  The Federals thought they had thoroughly whipped Morgan, and he would give them no more trouble. But they did not know the man. He had started for Kentucky, and to Kentucky he would go. After crossing the Cumberland, he halted, gathered his scattered command together, and then with less than three hundred men, started for Glasgow.  “Lieutenant Pennington will meet us at Glasgow with reinforcements,” he told his men.  But there were some of his officers who had misgivings. Chief among these was Captain Conway. Speaking to another officer, a Captain Mathews, Conway said: “It’s strange that the Colonel has such confidence in that young upstart. As for me, I look for no reinforcements. The best thing we can do is to get back as soon as possible.”  “Captain, what is the matter?” asked Mathews. “What has that young fellow done that you have taken such a dislike to him?”  “Nothing; but the idea of sending a mere boy on such an important mission! Why did he not send some one back with influence?”  “Pennington is well connected; you know his father is Judge Pennington of Danville.”  “That makes little difference. His mission will be a failure; see if it isn’t. We shall see no reinforcements at Glasgow.”  Just then Morgan came riding along, and seeing Conway said, “Captain, I want to thank you for the gallant manner in which you held back the enemy while the command crossed the Cumberland. You did nobly.”  This praise so pleased Conway that for a time he forgot his supposed grievance.  Without further trouble from the Federals, the little command reached Glasgow, where they were received with open arms by the inhabitants. Houses were thrown open to them and food provided in abundance. But nothing had been heard of any reinforcements.  “What did I tell you?” said Conway to Mathews.  “Wait,” was the answer.  The night was an anxious one. Morning came, but still nothing was heard of any reinforcements.  “We will wait another day,” said Morgan.  About noon cheering was heard, and Morgan’s men nearly went wild with enthusiasm, as nearly two hundred splendidly mounted men came galloping into camp.  When the captain in command reported, Morgan thanked him in the warmest terms, and then looking eagerly around, said: “Where is Lieutenant Pennington? I do not see him.”  “Lieutenant Pennington,” answered the Captain, “asked leave to take twenty men and scout toward Cave City. I gave him permission to do so. He has an idea that the railroad might be reached and broken at that point.”  “Ah! I have thought so myself,” replied Morgan. “I shall wait for his report with interest.”  The arrival of the two fresh companies had raised the command to as large, or larger, than it was when it started from Corinth, and every man was eager to go on. It was nearly night when Calhoun reported with his little company. He was jubilant over what he had discovered.  “Colonel,” he said, “we can easily capture Cave City, and thus sever the connection between Louisville and Nashville. The place is lightly guarded.”  “Oh! If we could only take the place, and capture the train on which my gallant men taken prisoners at Lebanon are being taken North, I should be supremely happy,” said Morgan, with much feeling.  “Perhaps we can,” replied Calhoun, with enthusiasm.  “How about going farther north than Cave City?” asked Morgan.  Calhoun shook his head. “It will not do,” he replied; “all the towns are too strongly held for your small force to cope with.”  “At least we can try Cave City,” answered Morgan, and orders were given for the command to be ready to march at sundown. The vicinity of Cave City was reached about two o’clock in the morning. The column was halted and the men were ordered to rest until daylight.  As soon as it was light, Calhoun, with a soldier named Emory, was sent in advance to the place. They were disguised as countrymen, and were to linger around the depot, and when the charge came they were to prevent the telegraph operator from sending warning of the raid.  Dressed in homespun clothes, and riding sorry steeds, Calhoun and Emory played their part to perfection. Their entrance into the little place caused no comment, and excited no suspicion. Sauntering into the depot, they gazed curiously around.    [Illustration: SAUNTERING INTO THE DEPOT THEY GAZED CURIOUSLY AROUND.]  “What’s that?” asked Calhoun, pointing at the clicking telegraph instrument.  “That, my boy,” said the operator, patronizingly, “is a telegraphic instrument. Did you never see one before?”  “No. What makes it tick?”  “Lightning, my son, lightning; that’s a lightning-catcher.”  Calhoun opened his eyes in wonder. “Jes’ heah that,” he said to Emory. “What is it fer?” he continued, turning his attention to the operator once more.  “To send messages,” replied the operator, amused at the ignorance displayed. “With this little instrument, I can talk with any one at Louisville or Nashville.”  “What’s yo-uns givin’ we-uns,” drawled Calhoun. “Do yo’ take we-uns fo’ a fule?”  A guard who stood idly by laughed long and loud. “A fine specimen of Southern chivalry,” he chuckled.  Just then there came the sound of cheering, pistol shots, and the clatter of horses’ hoofs, mingled with affrighted cries.  “By heavens! the town is being raided,” shouted the operator, as he sprang to his instrument.  “Stop!” thundered Calhoun. “Touch that instrument and you are a dead man.”  The operator looked up amazed, only to find himself covered with a revolver.  The guard at the same time was looking into the muzzle of a weapon held by Emory.  “Drop that gun,” said Emory to the trembling man.  The gun went clanging to the floor.  “You two stand there in the corner with your hands above your heads,” commanded Calhoun.  The operator and the guard obeyed with alacrity. “Keep them covered with your revolver, Emory,” continued Calhoun, “while I see what I can find. Think I will pocket these dispatches first; they may be of use.”  Just then he glanced out of the window and saw four or five soldiers running toward the depot. There might be more following. Giving the telegraphic instrument a kick which sent it flying, he started to leave in a hurry. Then noticing the blanched faces of the soldiers, as they came rushing into the depot, he called out, “No use running, Emory, we can take the whole crowd prisoners, green as we look.”  And they did. There was no fight in the frightened men.  When the excitement was over Calhoun looked over the dispatches which he had captured, and found that a passenger train was due from the south in half an hour, and that it had orders to wait at Cave City for a freight train to pass, coming from the north. This was good news, and Morgan’s men waited, in glee, for the approaching trains.

But     given a wrong conclusion, you can still get a right answer!  WALT and LEIGH RICHMOND  Illustrated by John Schoenherr   Little Oley had wandered into forbidden territory again--Big Brother Sven's ham shack. The glowing bottles here were an irresistible lure, and he liked to pretend that he knew all there was to know about the mysteries in this room.  Of course, Sven said that not even _he_ knew all of the mysteries, though he admitted he was one of the best ham operators extant, with QSOs from eighteen countries and thirty-eight states to his credit.  At the moment, Sven was busily probing into an open chassis with a hot soldering iron.  \"Short's in here some place,\" he muttered.  \"What makes shorts, Sven?\" Oley wasn't so knowledgeable but what he would ask an occasional question.  Sven turned and glared down. \"What are you doing in here? You know it's a Federal Offense for anybody to come into this room without I say so?\"  \"Momma and Hilda come in all the time, and you don't say so.\" Oley stood firm on what he figured were legal grounds. \"What makes shorts?\"  Sven relented a little. This brother had been something of a surprise to him, coming along when Sven was a full ten years old. But, he reflected, after a few years maybe I should get used to the idea. Actually, he sort of liked the youngster.  \"Shorts,\" he said, speaking from the superior eminence of his fourteen years to the four-year-old, \"is when electricity finds a way to get back where it came from without doing a lot of hard work getting there. But you see, electricity like to work; so, even when it has an easy way, it just works harder and uses itself up.\"  This confused explanation of shorts was, of course, taken verbatim, despite the fact that Oley couldn't define half the words and probably couldn't even pronounce them.  \"I don't like shorts. I don't like these pink shorts Momma put on me this morning. Is they electrics, Sven?\"  Sven glanced around at the accidentally-dyed-in-the-laundry, formerly white shorts.  \"Um-m-m. Yeah. You could call 'em electric.\"  With this Oley let out whoop and dashed out of the room, trailing a small voice behind him. \"Momma, Momma. Sven says my shorts is electric!\"  \"I'll short Sven's electrics for him, if he makes fun of your shorts!\" Oley heard his mother's comforting reply.         *       *       *       *       *  In the adult world days passed before Oley's accidentally acquired pattern of nubilous information on the subject of shorts was enlarged. It was only days in the adult world, but in Oley's world each day was a mountainous fraction of an entire lifetime, into which came tumbling and jumbling--or were pulled--bits, pieces, oddments, landslides and acquisitions of information on every subject that he ran into, or that ran into him. Nobody had told Oley that acquiring information was his job at the moment; the acquisition was partly accidental, mostly instinctive, and spurred by an intense curiosity and an even more intense determination to master the world as he saw it.  There was the taste of the sick green flowers that Momma kept in the window box and, just for a side course, a little bit of the dirt, too. There were the patterns of the rain on the window, and the reactions of a cat to having its tail pulled. The fact that you touch a stove one time, and it's cool and comfortable to lay your head against, and another time it hurts. Things like that. And other things--towering adults who sometimes swoop down on you and throw you high into the air; and most times walk over you, around you, and ignore you completely. The jumble of assorted and unsorted information that is the heritage of every growing young inquiring brain.  In terms of time, it was only a couple of weeks, if you were looking at it as an adult, until the next \"shorts\" incident.  Oley was sitting peacefully at the breakfast table, doing his level best to control the manipulation of the huge knife-fork-and-spoon, plate-bowl-and-glass, from which he was expected to eat a meal. Things smelled good. Momma was cooking doste, and that to Oley smelled best of all. The doster ticked quietly to itself, then gave a loud pop, and up came two golden-brown slices of doste. Dostes? Oley wasn't sure. But he hadn't really begun paying too much attention to whether one doste was the same as two doste or what, though he could quite proudly tell you the difference between one and two.  Out it came, and fresh butter was spread on it, and in went two shiny white beds, for some more doste.  Little Oley watched in fascination. And now he reached for the tremendous glass sitting on the table in front of him. But his fingers didn't quite make it. Somehow, the glass was heavy and slippery, and it eluded him, rolled over on its side, and spilled the bright purple juicy contents out across the table in a huge swish.  Oley wasn't dismayed, but watched with a researcher's interest as the bright purple juice swept across the table towards the busily ticking doster. Momma, of course, wasn't here, or she would have been gruff about it. She'd just gone into the other room.  [Illustration]  The juice spread rapidly at first, and then more and more slowly, making a huge, circuitous river spreading across the table, first towards the doster and then away from it towards the frayed power-cord lying on the table. It touched and began to run along the cord. Not a very eventful recording so far, but Oley watched, charmed.  As he watched, a few bubbles began to appear near the frayed spot. A few wisps of steam. And then, suddenly, there was a loud, snarling splat--and Momma screamed from the doorway. \"That juice is making a short!\"  The information, of course, was duly recorded. Juice makes shorts.  It was a minor item of information, mixed into a jumble of others, and nothing else was added to this particular file for nearly another week.         *       *       *       *       *  Oley was playing happily on the living room floor that night. Here there was much to explore, though an adult might not have thought twice about it. Back in the corner behind Momma's doing bachine a bright, slender piece of metal caught Oley's attention. Bigger on one end than the other, but not really very big anywhere, the sewing machine needle proved fascinating. As a first experiment, Oley determined that it worked like a tooth by biting himself with it. After that he went around the room, biting other things with it. Information, of course, is information, and to be obtained any way one can.  The brown, snaky lamp cord was the end of this experiment. Oley bit it, viciously, with his new tooth, and had only barely observed that it had penetrated completely through when there was a loud splat, and all the lights in the room went out.  In the darkness and confusion, of course, Oley moved away, seeking other new experiences. So the cause of the short that Momma and Poppa yakked so loudly about was never attributed to Oley's actions, but only to \"How could a needle have gotten from your sewing machine into this lamp cord, Alice?\"  But the sum of information had increased. Neatles stuck into lamp cords had something to do with shorts.  More time passed. And this time the file on shorts was stimulated by Poppa. The big, rough, booming voice had always scared Oley a bit when it sounded mad, like now.  \"Alice, I've just got to have some more shorts!\"  Poppa was rummaging in a drawer far above Oley's head, so he couldn't see the object under discussion. But all he already knew about shorts--the information passed in review before him.  Shorts are useful. They help electrics to work harder.  Shorts you wear, and they are electrics.  Wires are electrics.  Shorts can be made by juice.  Shorts can be made by neatles, that bite like teeth.  Poppa needs more shorts.  But Oley wasn't motivated to act at the moment. Just sorting out information and connecting it with other information files in the necessarily haphazard manner that might eventually result in something called intelligence, although he didn't know that yet.  It was a week later in the kitchen, when Momma dropped a giant version of the neatle on the floor, that his information file in this area increased again.  \"Is that a neatle?\" Oley asked.  His mother laughed quietly and looked fondly at her son as she put the ice pick back on the table.  \"I guess you could call it a needle, Oley,\" she told him. \"An ice needle.\"  Oley instinctively waited until Momma's back was turned before taking the nice neatle to try its biting powers; and instinctively took it out of the kitchen before starting his experiments.  As he passed the cellar door he heard a soft gurgling and promptly changed course. Pulling open the door with difficulty, he seated himself on the cellar stairs to watch a delightful new spectacle--frothing, gurgling water making its way across the floor towards the stairs. It looked wonderfully dirty and brown, and to Oley it was an absorbing phenomenon. It never occurred to him to tell Momma.  Suddenly above him the cellar door slammed open, and Poppa came charging down the stairs, narrowly missing the small figure, straight into the rising waters, intent, though Oley couldn't know it, on reaching the drain pipe in the far corner of the cellar to plug it before water from the spring rains could back up farther and really flood the cellar out.  Halfway across the cellar, Poppa reached up and grasped the dangling overhead light to turn it on, in order to see his way to the drain--and suddenly came to frozen, rigid, gasping stop as his hand clamped firmly over the socket.  Little Oley watched. There was juice in the cellar. Poppa had hold of an electric. Was Poppa trying to make the shorts he needed?  Oley wasn't sure. He thought it probable. And from the superior knowledge of his four years, Oley already knew a better way to make shorts. Neatles make good"]]]
