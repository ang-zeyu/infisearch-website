That crazy ululation kept up for several minutes. Evelyn shivered.  \"The Ragged Men,\" said Tommy very quietly. \"They sneaked up on the Tube. They flung blazing thermit, or something like it, with a weapon captured from the Golden City. That explosion was the grenades going off. I'm afraid the Tube's blown up, Evelyn.\"  She caught her breath, looking mutely up at him.  \"Here's a pistol,\" he said briefly, \"and shells. There's no use our going to the Tube to-night. It would be dangerous. We'll do our investigating at dawn.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He found a crevice where tree-fern trunks grew close together and closed in three sides of a sort of roofless cave. He seated himself grimly at the opening to wait for daybreak. He was not easy in his mind. There had been two Tubes to the Fifth-Dimension world. One had been made by Jacaro for his gunmen. That was now held by the men of the Golden City, as was proved by carnivorous lizards and the Death Mist that had come down it. The other was now blown up or, worse, in the hands of the Ragged Men. In any case Tommy and Evelyn were isolated upon a strange planet in a strange universe. To fall into the hands of the Ragged Men was to die horribly, and the Golden City would not now welcome inhabitants of the world Jacaro and his men had come from. To the civilized men of this world, Jacaro's raids would seem invasion. They would seem acts of war on the part of the people of Earth. And the people of Earth, all of them, would seem enemies. Jacaro would never be identified as an unauthorized invader. He would seem to be a scout, an advance guard, a spy, for hordes of other invaders yet to come.  As the long night wore away, Tommy's grim hopelessness intensified. The Ragged Men would hunt them for sport and out of hatred for all sane human beings. The men of the Golden City would be merciless to compatriots of Jacaro's gunmen. And Tommy had Evelyn to look out for.         *       *       *       *       *  When dawn came, his face was drawn and lined. Evelyn woke with a little gasp, staring affrightedly about her. Then she tried gamely to smile.  \"Morning, Tommy,\" she said shakily. She added in a brave attempt at levity: \"Where do we go from here?\"  \"We look at the Tube,\" said Tommy heavily. \"There's a bare chance....\"  He led the way as on the night before, with his gun held ready. They traveled for half an hour through the awakening jungle. Then for long, long minutes Tommy searched for a sign of living men before he ventured forth to look at the wreckage of the Tube. He found no live men, and only two dead ones. But a glimpse of their bestial, vice-ridden faces was enough to remove any regret for their deaths.  The Tube was shattered. Its mouth was belled out and broken by the explosion of the grenades hung within it. A part of the metal was molten--from the thermit, past question. There was a veritable crater fifteen feet across where the Tube had come through, and there were only shattered shreds of metal where the first bend had been. Tommy regarded the wreckage grimly. A pair of oxidized copper wires, their insulation burnt off, stung his eyes as he traced them to where they vanished in torn-up earth. He took them in his bare hands. The tingling sting of a low-voltage current made his heart leap. Then he smiled grimly. He touched them to each other. Dot-dot-dot--dash-dash-dash--dot-dot-dot. S O S! If there was anybody in the laboratory, that would tell them.  His hands stung sharply. Someone was there, ringing the phone! Evelyn came toward him, her face resolutely cheerful.  \"No hope, Tommy?\" she asked. \"I just saw the telephone, all battered up. I guess we're pretty badly off.\"  \"Get it!\" said Tommy feverishly. \"For Heaven's sake, get it! The phone wires weren't broken. If we can make it work....\"         *       *       *       *       *  The instrument was a wreck. It was crumpled and torn and apparently useless. The diaphragm of the receiver was punctured. The transmitter seemed to have been crushed. But Tommy worked desperately over them, and twisted the earth-wires into place.  \"Hello, hello, hello!\"  The voice that answered was Smithers', strained and fearful:  \"Mr. Reames! Thank Gawd! What's happened? Is Miss Evelyn all right?\"  \"So far,\" said Tommy. \"Listen!\" He told curtly just what had happened. \"Now, what's happened on Earth?\"  \"Hell!\" panted Smithers bitterly. \"Hell's been poppin'! The Death Mist's two miles across an' still growin an' movin'. Four townships under martial law an' movin' out the people. It got thirty of 'em this morning. An' they think the professor's crazy an' nobody'll listen to him!\"  \"Damn!\" said Tommy. He considered, grimly. \"Look here, Von Holtz ought to convince them.\"  \"He caved in, outa his head, before I got to Albany. He's in hospital now, ravin'. He's got some kinda fever the doctors don't know nothin' about. Sick as hell!\"  Tommy compressed his lips. Matters were more desperate even than he had believed. He informed his helper measuredly:  \"Evelyn and I can't stay around here, Smithers. The Ragged Men may come back, and it'll be weeks before you and the professor can get another Tube through. I'm going to make for the Golden City and work on them there to cut off the Death Mist.\"  There was an inarticulate sound from Smithers.  \"Tell the professor. If he can find Jacaro's Tube, he'll work out some way to communicate through it. We've got to stop that Death Mist somehow. And we don't know what else they may try.\"  Smithers tried to speak, and could not. He merely made grief-stricken noises. He worshiped Evelyn and she was isolated in a hostile world which was vastly more unreachable than could be measured by millions or trillions of miles. But at last he said unsteadily:  \"We'll be comin', Mr. Reames. We'll come, if we have t' blow half the world apart!\"  Tommy said grimly: \"Then hunt up the Golden City and bring extra ammunition. Mostly explosive bullets. Good-by.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He untwisted the wires from the shattered phone units and thrust them in his pocket. Evelyn was picking up stray small objects from the ground.  \"I've found some cartridges, Tommy,\" she said constrainedly, \"and a pistol I think will work.\"  \"Then listen for visitors,\" commanded Tommy, \"while I look for more.\"  For half in hour he scoured the area around the shattered Tube. He found where some clumsy-wheeled thing had been pushed to a spot near the Tube--undoubtedly the machine which had sprayed the flaming stuff upon it. He found two pockets full of shells. He found an extra magazine, for the sub-machine gun. It was nearly full and only a little bent. That was all.  \"Now,\" he said briskly, \"we'll start. I've got a hunch the jungle thins out over that way. We'll find a clearing, try to locate the Golden City either by seeing it or by watching for aircraft flying to it, and then make for it. They're making war on Earth there. They don't understand. We've got to make them understand. O. K.?\"  Evelyn nodded. She put out her hand suddenly, a brave slender figure amid the incredible growths about her.  \"I'm glad, Tommy,\" she said slowly, \"that if--if anything happens, it will be the--the two of us. Funny, isn't it?\"  Tommy kissed the twisted little smile from her face.  \"And now that that's over,\" he observed, ashamed of his own emotion, \"let's go!\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went. Tommy watched the sun and kept approximately a straight line. They traveled three miles, and the jungle broke abruptly. Before them was a spongy surface neither solid earth or marsh. It shelved gently down to a vast and steaming morass upon which the dull-red sun shone hotly. It was vast, that marsh, and a steaming haze hung over it, and it seemed to reach to the world's end. But vaguely, through the attenuating upper layers of the steamy haze, they saw the outlines of a city beyond: tall towers and soaring spires, buildings of a grace and perfection of outline unknown upon the Earth. And faint golden flashes came from the walls and pinnacles of that city. They were reflections of this planet's monster sun, upon walls and roofs of plated gold.  \"The Golden City,\" said Tommy heavily. He looked at the horrible marsh between. His heart sank.  And then there was a sudden screaming ululation nearby. A half-naked man was running out of sight. Two others danced and capered and yelled in insane glee, pointing at Tommy and at Evelyn. The running man's outcry was echoed from far away. Then it was taken up and repeated here and there in the jungle.  \"They saw our tracks near the Tube,\" snapped Tommy bitterly. \"Oh, what a fool I am! Now they'll ring us in.\"  He seized Evelyn's hand and began to run. There was a little rise in the ground a hundred yards away, with a clump of leafy ferns to shade it. They reached it as other half-naked, wholly mad human forms burst out of the jungle to yell and caper and make derisive and horrible gestures at the fugitives.  \"Here we fight,\" said Tommy grimly. \"The ground's open, anyhow. We fight here, and very probably we die here. But first....\"  He knelt down and drew the finest of fine beads upon a bearded man who carried a glittering truncheonlike club which, by the way it was carried, was more than merely a bludgeon. He pulled the trigger for a single shot.  The bullet struck the capering Ragged Man fairly in the chest. And it exploded.     CHAPTER V  _The Fight in the Marsh_   Twice, within the next two hours, the Ragged Men mustered the courage to charge. They came racing across the semi-solid ooze like the madmen they were. Their yells and shouts were maniacal howls of blood-lust or worse. And twice Tommy broke their rush with a savage ruthlessness. The sub-machine-gun's first magazine was nearly empty. It was an unhandy weapon for single-shot work but it was loaded with explosive shells. The second rush he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/30408"],["title","The Fifth-Dimension Tube (#6)"],["body","with an automatic pistol. There were half-naked bodies partly buried in the ooze all the way from the jungle's edge to within ten yards of the hillock on which he and Evelyn had taken refuge.  It was hot there, terribly hot. The air was stifling. It fairly reeked of moisture and the smells from the swamp behind them were sickening. Tommy began to transfer the shells from the spare bent magazine to the one he had carried with the gun.  \"We've a couple of reasons to be thankful,\" he observed. \"One is that there's a bit of shade overhead. The other is that we had the big magazines for this gun. We still have nearly ninety shells, besides the ones for the pistols.\"  Evelyn said soberly:  \"We're going to be killed, don't you think, Tommy?\"  Tommy frowned.  \"I'm rather afraid we are,\" he said irritably. \"Confound it, and I'd thought of such excellent arguments to use in the City back yonder! Smithers said the Death Mist was two miles across, to-day, and still growing. The people in the city are still pouring the stuff down through Jacaro's Tube.\"  Evelyn smiled faintly. She touched his hand.  \"Trying to keep me from worrying? Tommy....\" She hesitated until he growled a question. \"Please--remember that when Daddy and I were in the jungle before, we saw what these Ragged Men do to prisoners they take. I just want you to promise that--well, you won't wait too long, in hopes of somehow saving me.\"  Tommy stared at her. Then he decisively reached forward and put his hand over her mouth.  \"Keep quiet,\" he said gently. \"They shan't capture you. I promise that. Now keep quiet.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was only silence for a long time. Now and again a hidden figure screamed in rage at them. Now and again some flapping thing sped toward the jungle's edge. Once a naked arm thrust one of the golden truncheons from behind its cover, pointing at a flying thing a few yards overhead. The flying thing suddenly toppled, turning over and over before it crashed to the ground. There were howls of glee.  \"They seem mad,\" said Tommy meditatively, \"and they act like lunatics, but I've got a hunch of some sort about them. But what?\"  Sunlight gleamed on something golden beyond the jungle's edge. Naked figures went running to the spot. An exultant tumult arose.  \"Now they try another trick,\" Tommy observed dispassionately. \"I remember that at the Tube they had pushed something on wheels....\"  The sub-machine gun was unhandy for accurate single shots, and no pistol can be used to effect at long ranges. To conserve ammunition, Tommy had been shooting only at relatively close targets, allowing the Ragged Men immunity at over two hundred yards. But now he flung over the continuous-fire stud. He watched grimly.  The foliage at the edge of the jungle parted. A crude wagon appeared. Its axles were lesser tree-trunks. Its wheels were clumsy and crude beyond belief. But mounted upon it there was a queer mass of golden metal which looked strangely beautiful and strangely deadly.  \"That's the thing,\" said Tommy dispassionately, \"which made the flare of light last night. It blew up the Tube. And Von Holtz told me--hm--his friends, in the City....\"  He sighted carefully. The wagon and its contents were surrounded by a leaping, capering mob. They shook their fists in an insane hatred.  A storm of bullets burst upon them. Tommy was traversing the little gun with the trigger pressed down. His lips were set tightly. And suddenly it seemed as if the solid earth burst asunder! There had been an instant in which the bullet-bursts were visible. They tore and shattered the howling mob of Ragged Men. But then they struck the golden weapon. A sheet of blue-white flame leaped skyward and round about. A blast of blistering, horrible heat smote upon the beleaguered pair. The moisture of the ooze between them and the jungle flashed into steam. A section of the jungle itself, a hundred yards across, shriveled and died.         *       *       *       *       *  Steam shot upward in a monstrous cloud--miles high, it seemed. Then, almost instantly, there was nothing left of the Ragged Men about the golden weapon, or of the weapon itself, but an unbearable blue-white light which poured away and trickled here and there and seemed to grow in volume as it flamed.  From the rest of the jungle a howl arose. It was a howl of such loss, and of such unspeakable rage, that the hair at the back of Tommy's neck lifted, as a dog's hackles lift at sight of an enemy.  \"Keep your head down, Evelyn,\" said Tommy composedly. \"I have an idea that the burning stuff gives off a lot of ultra-violet. Von Holtz was badly burned, you remember.\"  Naked figures flashed forward from the jungle beyond the burned area. Tommy shot them down grimly. He discarded the sub-machine gun with its explosive shells for the automatics. Some of his targets were only wounded. Those wounded men dragged themselves forward, screaming their rage. Tommy felt sickened, as if he were shooting down madmen. A voice roared a rage-thickened order from the jungle. The assault slackened.  Five minutes later it began again, and this time the attackers waded out into the softer ooze and flung themselves down, and then began a half-swimming, half-crawling progress behind bits of tree-fern stump, or merely pushing walls of the jellylike mud before them. The white light expanded and grew huge--but it dulled as it expanded, and presently seemed no hotter than molten steel, and later still it was no more than a dull-red heat, and later yet....  Tommy shot savagely. Some of the Ragged Men died. More did not.  \"I'm afraid,\" he said coolly, \"they're going to get us. It seems rather purposeless, but I'm afraid they're going to win.\"  Evelyn thrust a shaking hand skyward. \"There, Tommy!\"         *       *       *       *       *  A strange, angular flying thing was moving steadily across the marsh, barely above the steamlike haze that hung in thinning layers about its foulness. The flying thing moved with a machinelike steadiness, and the sun twinkled upon something bright and shining before it.  \"A flying machine,\" said Tommy shortly. His mind leaped ahead and his lips parted in a mirthless smile. \"Get your gas mask ready, Evelyn. The explosion of that thermit-thrower made them curious in the City. They sent a ship to see.\"  The flying thing grew closer, grew distinct. A wail arose from the Ragged Men. Some of them leaped to their feet and fled. A man came out into the open and shook his fists at the angular thing in the air. He screamed at it, and such ghastly hatred was in the sound that Evelyn shuddered.  Tommy could see it plainly, now. Its single wing was thick and queerly unlike the air-foils of Earth. A framework hung below it, but it had no balancing tail. And there was a glittering something before it that obviously was its propelling mechanism, but as obviously was not a screw propeller. It swept overhead, with a man in it looking downward. Tommy watched coolly. It was past him, sweeping toward the jungle. It swung sharply to the right, banking steeply. Smoking things dropped from it, which expanded into columns of swiftly-descending vapor. They reached the jungle and blotted it out. The flying machine swung again and swept back to the left. More smoking things dropped. Ragged Men erupted from the jungle's edge in screaming groups, only to writhe and fall and lie still. But a group of five of them sped toward Tommy, shrieking their rage upon him as the cause of disaster. Tommy held his fire, looking upward. A hundred yards, fifty yards, twenty-five....         *       *       *       *       *  The flying machine soared in easy, effortless circles. The man in it was watching, making no effort to interfere.  Tommy shot down the five men, one after the other, with a curiously detached feeling that their vice-brutalized faces would haunt him forever. Then he stood up.  The flying machine banked, turned, and swept toward him, and a smoking thing dropped toward the earth. It was a gas bomb like those that had wiped out the Ragged Men. It would strike not ten yards away.  \"Your mask!\" snapped Tommy.  He helped Evelyn adjust it. The billowing white cloud rolled around him. He held his breath, clapped on his mask, exhaled until his lungs ached, and was breathing comfortably. The mask was effective protection. And then he held Evelyn comfortably close.  For what seemed a long, long while they were surrounded by the white mist. The cloud was so dense, indeed, that the light about them faded to a gray twilight. But gradually, bit by bit, the mist grew thinner. Then it moved aside. It drifted before the wind toward the tree-fern forest and was lost to sight.  The flying machine was circling and soaring silently overhead. As the mist drew aside, the pilot dived down and down. And Tommy emptied his automatic at the glittering thing which drew it. There was a crashing bolt of blue light. The machine canted, spun about with one wing almost vertical, that wing-tip struck the marsh, and it settled with a monstrous splashing of mud. All was still.  Tommy reloaded, watching it keenly.  \"The framework isn't smashed up, anyhow,\" he observed grimly. \"The pilot thinks we're some of Jacaro's gang. My guns were proof, to him. So, since the Ragged Men didn't get us, he gassed us.\" He watched again, his eyes narrow. The pilot was utterly still. \"He may be knocked out. I hope so! I'm going to see.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Automatic held ready, Tommy moved toward the crashed machine. It had splashed into the ooze less than a hundred yards away. Tommy moved cautiously. Twenty yards away, the pilot moved feebly. He had knocked his head against some part of his machine. A moment later he opened his eyes and stared about. The next instant he had seen Tommy and moved convulsively. A glittering thing appeared in his hand--and Tommy fired. The glittering thing flew to one side and the pilot clapped his hand to a"]]]
