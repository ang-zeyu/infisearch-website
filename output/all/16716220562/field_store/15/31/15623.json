Roughly the personnel in this war           has been multiplied by three; in earlier wars it           was increased six, seven, eight, or even nine           fold, if we take the difference between the           figures for 1792 and 1812.            \"It is a common error to suppose that our ships in           the old wars were manned entirely by seamen. A           knowledge of how the men were raised shows that           this cannot have been so; and confirmation can be           had from a very brief study of ships' muster           books. Only about a third of the crew of a           line-of-battle ship were, in the seaman's phrase,           'prime seamen.' The rest were either only partly           trained or were frankly not sailor men. The           _Victory_ at Trafalgar was not an ill-manned           ship--here is an analysis of her crew: officers,           commissioned and warrant, 28; petty officers,           including marines, 63; able seamen, 213; ordinary           seamen and boys, 225; landsmen, 86; marines, 137;           artificers, 18; quarter gunners, 12;           supernumeraries and domestics, 37.            \"During the whole of our naval history down to           1815 it was the invariable rule that in peace time           the battle fleets were laid up unmanned, and only           enough ships were kept in commission to 'show the           flag' and to police the sea. This accounts for the           very large increase of the naval personnel which           immediately became necessary when there was a           threat of war; and it accounts also for the           difficulty which was always experienced in raising           the men. This difficulty was even greater than we           are apt to suppose, for the Merchant Service has           never been able to give the navy more than a           fraction of the total number of men needed, and           the machinery for raising extra men has, until           this war, always been of a most primitive nature.            \"When war came the ships were commissioned,           without crews. This could be done because from the           latter part of the seventeenth century there was a           permanent force of officers. Then the officers had           to find their own crews. They began by drawing           their proportion of marines, and then proceeded           to invite seamen to volunteer. In this way they           got a number of skilled seamen, men who had been           in the navy before, and came back to it either as           petty officers or in the hope of becoming so. Then           warrants to impress seamen would be issued.           Theoretically the impress was merely a form of           conscription, the Crown claiming by prerogative           the right to the services of its seafaring           subjects. Practically a good deal of violence was           at times necessary, as many of the men, preferring           to sail in merchant ships, or wishing to wait for           a proclamation of bounty, tried to avoid arrest.           The scuffles that took place on these occasions           gave the impress service a bad name, not           altogether deserved, for real efforts were made to           avoid hardship, and in any case the number of men           raised in this way was greatly exaggerated by           popular report.\"  There was no compulsion during the Great War to join any unit of the British fleet. Therefore all were either in the regular service, reservists or volunteers. The need was made known not only throughout the British Isles, but also from Vancouver to Cape Town, Sydney and Wellington, and men in all walks of life, but with either the _Wander-Lust_ or true love of the wide open sea in their blood, rallied from all parts of the far-flung Empire to the call of the White Ensign.  In order to obtain some 6000 officers and nearly 200,000 trained or semi-trained men, new sources of supply had to be tapped. Already the great battle fleets, brought up to full war strength and with adequate reserves, had absorbed nearly all the Reserve officers who could be spared from the food and troop transports.[2]  First came the great sea-training establishment of the Empire--the Mercantile Marine and its retired officers and men--already heavily depleted. Then the yacht clubs from the Fraser to the Thames and Clyde. Thousands of professionals and amateurs came overseas to the training cruisers and the \"naval university,\" Canada alone supplying several hundred officers.  Doctors came from the hospitals and from lucrative private practices. The engineering professions and trades supplied the technical staffs and skilled mechanics. The great banks and city offices yielded the accountants, and the fishing and pleasure-boating communities, not only of Great Britain, but also of the Dominions and Colonies, yielded the men in tens of thousands. In this way the personnel of the new navy was completed in a very few months.  Before passing on to describe, in the detail of personal acquaintance, the severe training of this naval force, a general knowledge of its heterogeneous character is necessary to enable the reader to understand this great assemblage of the sons of the Empire.  [Illustration: A LARGE AND HEAVILY ARMED GERMAN SUBMARINE OF THE CRUISER TYPE  _British Official Photograph_]  In the smoke-filled wardroom and gunroom of the training cruiser, H.M.S. _Hermione_ one windy March evening in 1916 there were some eighty officers of the auxiliary fleet, and of this number one hailed from distant Rhodesia, where he was the owner of thousands of acres of land and a goodly herd of cattle, but who, some time in the past, had rounded the Horn in a _wind-jammer_ and taken _sights_ in the \"Roaring Forties.\" Another was a seascape painter of renown both in England and the United States. A third was a member of a Pacific coast yacht club. A fourth was the son of an Irish peer, the owner of a steam yacht. Then came a London journalist, a barrister, a solicitor and a New Zealand yachtsman, while sitting at the table was a famous traveller and a _pukka_ commander.  In the neighbouring gunroom, among the crowd of sub-lieutenants--all of the same great force, the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve--was a grey-haired veteran from the Canadian Lakes, a youngster from the Clyde, the son of a shipowner from Australia and a bronzed mine manager from the Witwatersrand.  Among the engineers and mechanics the same diversity. Men from several of the great engineering establishments, a student from a North Country university, electrical engineers from the power stations and mechanics from the bench, with here and there one or two with sea-going experience.  In the forecastle and elsewhere about the old cruiser--now merely a training establishment--were sailors with years of experience in both sail and steam. Fishermen from the Hebrides and Newfoundland rubbing shoulders with yacht hands from the Solent and Clyde.  From this curiously mixed but excellent raw material a naval personnel, with its essential knowledge and discipline, had to be fashioned in record time by an incredibly small staff of commissioned and warrant officers of the permanent service, aided by the more experienced amateurs.  It must, however, not be thought from this that the amateur was converted into a professional seaman in the space of a week or two. Three months of specialised training enabled them to take their place in the new fleet, but with some it required a much longer period to enable them to feel that perfect self-confidence when _alone_ in the face of difficulties and dangers which is the true heritage of the sea.  To describe here the training of officers and men would be to repeat what will be more fully and personally described in succeeding chapters. It is sufficient to say that the aim was to bring them all to a predetermined standard of efficiency, which would enable the officers to command ships of specific types at sea and in action, and the men to form efficient engineers and deck hands for almost any ship in the Navy.  The medical branches naturally required no special training and the accountants merely a knowledge of naval systems of financial and general administration. These two branches had their own training establishments.  When the period of preliminary training in the cruiser _Hermione_ was over the officers were passed on to the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, and from there to one or other of the fifty war bases in the United Kingdom, the Mediterranean or farther afield. Their appointments were to ships forming the fleets attached to each of these bases and generally operating in the surrounding seas.  In this way the whole zone of war was covered by an anti-submarine and minesweeping organisation and general naval patrol, which operated in conjunction with, but separate from, the battle fleets, squadrons and flotillas, which were thus left free to perform their true functions in big naval engagements.

CHAPTER II  THE NEW NAVY--TRAINING AN ANTI-SUBMARINE FORCE   HAVING described the _raison d'être_ of the new navy, and how it became a fleet in being, with its own admirals, captains, staffs, bases and all the paraphernalia of war, I can pass on to a more intimate description of the training of the officers and men, preparatory to their being drafted to the scattered units of this great anti-submarine force.  Lying in the spacious docks at Southampton was the old 4000-ton cruiser _Hermione_, which had been brought round from her natural base in Portsmouth dockyard to act as the depot ship and training establishment for a large section of this new force. Not all the officers and men of the auxiliary fleet were, however, destined to pass across its decks. This vessel was reserved for the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, from which a very considerable proportion of the entire personnel of the new fleet was drawn. Nor was H.M.S. _Hermione_ the first depot ship of the war-time R.N.V.R. at Southampton, for the Admiralty yacht _Resource II._ had been used for the first few drafts, but was unfortunately burned to the water's edge. There were also other vessels and establishments at Portsmouth, Devonport and Chatham. These were, however, mainly for the reception and brief training of the more experienced Merchant Service officers, entered in the Royal Naval Reserve for the duration of the war, and for the surgeons and accountants.  The men of the new force were mostly trained in the naval barracks and depot ships situated at the big naval centres, such as Portsmouth and Chatham. After a few weeks all these establishments were drafting, in a constant stream, the trained human element to the vessels awaiting full complements at the different war bases, or being constructed in the hundreds of shipyards of the Empire.  About H.M.S. _Hermione_, which has been selected as being representative of the training depots of a large section of the auxiliary service, little need be said, beyond the fact that she was commanded, first, by a distinguished officer from the Dardanelles, and subsequently by an equally capable officer, who, by the irony of fate, had in pre-war times been a member of the British Naval Mission to the Turkish navy--both of them men whose experience and unfailing tact contributed largely to the success of the thousands of embryo officers trained under their command.  The ship herself was a rambling old cruiser, but very little of the actual training was carried out on board. Spacious buildings on the quayside provided the training grounds for gunnery, drill, signalling, engineering and all the complicated curricula, of which more anon. Lying in the still waters of the dock, alongside the comparatively big grey cruiser, were the trim little hulls of a numerous flotilla of 20-knot motor launches, newly arrived from Canada, with wicked-looking 13-pounder high-angle guns, stumpy torpedo-boat masts and brand-new White Ensigns and brass-bound decks. These were the advance guard of a fleet of over 500 similar craft, to the command of which many of the officers being trained would, after a period of practical experience at sea, eventually succeed.  There were besides numerous other mosquito craft, which throbbed in and out of the dock from that vast sheltered arm of the sea called _Southampton Water_ on mysterious errands, soon to be solved by new recruits in the chilly winds of winter nights and early mornings.  This, then, was the mother ship and her children. When once the aft gangway leading up from the dockside to the clean-scrubbed decks had been crossed, and the sentry's challenge answered, the embryo officer left civilian life behind and commenced his training for the stern work of war.  It may not be out of place to give here a closer description of the training of the officers and men of the new navy, drawn from personal experience. To do this without the irritating egoism of the personal narrative it will be necessary, as often in future pages, to adopt the convenient \"third person.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The night was fine, but a keen March wind blew from off the sea. The dock lights were reflected in the still waters of the harbour. Tall cranes stood out black and clearly defined against the cold night sky. The shadows were deep around the warehouses, stores and other buildings of the busy dockside.  Lying in the south-western basin was the big grey hull of the cruiser, newly painted, and looking very formidable, with its tall masts and fighting-tops towering into the blue void, and its massive bow rising high above the dock wall.  Coming from the darkness on board were the tinkling notes of a banjo and the subdued hum of voices. Then the loud call of the quartermaster and the ringing of eight bells.  A group of newly appointed officers picked their way carefully among the tangled mooring ropes on the quayside and as they approached the warship were duly challenged by the sentries. Two of them had only just arrived from distant New Zealand. They were all \"for training,\" and on mounting the quarterdeck gangway were politely requested by the smiling quartermaster to report at the ship's office.  In order to get from the deck to this abode of paymasters and writers, except by the tabooed \"captain's hatchway,\" there had to be negotiated a long passage leading past the wardroom and the gunroom. In normal times at such an hour this passage would probably have been almost deserted, with the exception of a sentry, but the training was being speeded up to meet the demands of war, and with nearly 200 officers, many of whom fortunately lived ashore, constantly moving to and fro, it became either a semi-dark, congested thoroughfare, in which everyone was curtly apologising for knocking against someone else, or else it contained the steady pressure of a gunroom overflow meeting, with a tobacco-scented atmosphere peculiarly its own.  When the formality of reporting arrival had been completed, the embryo officers were taken in tow by the \"Officer of the Day,\" whose duty it was to introduce them to the gunroom and make them familiar in a general way with the routine of the ship. The officer who performed this ceremony on the night in question has since held a highly responsible post at the Admiralty--such is the fortune of war.  The first shock came when the work for the following day was explained. It commenced with physical drill on the quayside at 7 A.M. and ended with instruction in signalling at 6 P.M.!       .       .       .       .       .       .       .       .  The early morning was bitterly cold but fine. Physical \"jerks\" was not a dress parade; in fact, some of the early risers on the surrounding transports and ocean mail boats must have wondered what particular form of mania the crowd of running, leaping and arm-swinging men, in all stages of undress on the quayside, really suffered from.  Breakfast and Divisions were the next items on the programme, and the new-comers looked forward to the day's work with the keen interest of freshness.  _Morning Divisions_ and _Evening Quarters_ are events of some importance in the daily routine of his Majesty's ships. They are parades of the entire ship's company, with the exception of those on important duty, marking the beginning and end of the day's work. The crew, or men under training, are mustered in \"Watches,\" under their respective officers, and stand to attention at the bugle call. The senior officer taking divisions then enters, a roll is called and the names of those absent reported. The chaplain stands between the lines of men; the order \"Off caps!\" is given and prayers commence. When these are finished certain orders of the day are read out to the assembled ship's company and the parade is over.  At evening quarters, on certain days in the week, the names were read out of the officers and men detailed for special duties or for draft to a zone of war.  When morning divisions were over the day's work began. The embryo officers were attached to the seamanship class, consisting of about twenty men of all ages. Oilskins were donned, for the sky was overcast and the wind keen. They climbed down the steel sides of the cruiser on to the small deck of a tender, which was to convey them out on to the broad but sheltered waters where much of the preliminary practical training was to take place during the following weeks.  The instructor, an officer attached for the purpose, then divided his class into two \"watches,\" one being directed to work out the proposed course of the ship on the charts in the cabin and to give the necessary orders to the other watch on deck, who were to carry them into effect as the ship steamed along, with the aid of sextant, compass, wheel, engine-room telegraph, lead and log-line. As all possessed some knowledge of the sea, and had experience in navigating, this work did not prove as difficult as it undoubtedly would to anyone entirely devoid of nautical knowledge.  Those in the cabin with the charts worked out the compass courses from one point to another, making the necessary allowances for tide, deviation, etc. Others of the same watch received reports from the \"bridge\" and made the correct entries in the log-book. All elementary work, but which needed practice to make perfect, and on the accuracy of which men's lives would depend in the very near future.  The watch on deck was engaged in the more practical work of coastal navigation and could see the effect of any mistake made theoretically by their companions below. At midday the watches were reversed. Those working at the charts and courses came on deck and the seamen of the morning became the navigating officers of the afternoon.  On this particular day the second or port watch had the worst of it. A squally wind and rain had set in, making the work on"]]]
