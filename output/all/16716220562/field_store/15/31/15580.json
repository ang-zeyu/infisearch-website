The Exhibition consisted of eighty-seven pictures, in black and white of course, but otherwise similar in size and general appearance to those annually seen on the walls of Burlington House. Anyone who visited it must have seen that it was the result of many years of labour, and not a few of the pictures possessed an artistic value quite apart from their interest as pictorial travesties. A wish has been very generally expressed that some permanent record, in a portable shape, but in character consonant with the artistic purpose of the Exhibition, should be procurable by the public at large, both those who saw and those who did not see the originals at the Gainsborough Gallery and elsewhere.  To meet this wish an #ALBUM#, containing Reproductions of these #EIGHTY-SEVEN PICTURES#, with which will be included the contents of #THE ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE#, has been prepared and largely subscribed for. The issue of these Albums, however, which will be the only reproductions of the Exhibition, is strictly limited to #ONE THOUSAND COPIES#, each of which will be signed by the Artist.  It may be mentioned that the whole of this undertaking, from its conception to the present time, has been in Mr. Furniss's own hands. This has enabled Mr. Furniss scrupulously to maintain the artistic character of the whole enterprise. In the preparation of this Album he has spared no time or expense in trying reproductions by the different processes at home and abroad, similar to those used in the Album of the Royal Academy Pictures of 1886, and the annual reproductions of the French Salon. Not, however, being satisfied with any of these cheaper methods, he has, regardless of the great cost, adopted the finest method of photogravure--viz., the Photo Intaglio process of A. and C. Dawson, No. 3, Farringdon Street, and Hogarth Works, Chiswick, the reproductions being made under his own supervision. Each plate is hand-printed, and will in every way surpass, for artistic quality, anything of the kind ever published.  As PHOTOGRAVURE is the best and most faithful, as well as the most expensive method, this Album is certain to be valuable, and a worthy and complete memorial of the \"Artistic Joke\"; whilst the price charged will be only _£3 3s._, the same as fixed, originally, when the adoption of the cheaper process was contemplated.  The size of the Album is Imperial Quarto (11 by 15 inches); the plates range, on an average, from 4 × 6 to 7½ × 9 inches. The whole is handsomely and tastefully bound in cloth and gilt edged.  AFTER THE THOUSAND VERITABLE _Édition de Luxe_ WERE PRINTED, THE PLATES WERE DESTROYED.  _#The whole Edition is rapidly being exhausted and the price will be raised to FIVE Guineas in a few days#_.  _Orders should be forwarded to_ THE TYPOGRAPHIC-ETCHING CO., _No. 3, Farringdon Street_.  _#£3 3s. 6d.#_ (_including case for packing_).      \"I HAVE NOW HIT UPON A VERY HAPPY THOUGHT.\"--_Happy Thoughts._   #\"Happy Thoughts\" Birthday Book.#  _Selected and Arranged from \"Mr. Punch's\" Pages_  BY ROSIE BURNAND,   [Illustration]   WITH  #FRONTISPIECE PORTRAIT# of  #F.
