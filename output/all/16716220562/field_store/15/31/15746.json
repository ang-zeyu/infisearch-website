But in this position, or   mode of placing, I deem the virtues of this stone to be   properly conserved, and I believe that in other positions   or parts of the sky its virtue is dulled, rather than   preserved. By means of this instrument at all events you   will be relieved from every kind of clock (horologium),   for by it you will be able to know the Ascendant at   whatever hour you will, and all other dispositions of the   heavens which Astrologers seek after.  It should be noted that the device is to be mounted like an astronomical instrument and used like one, rather than as a time teller, or as a simple demonstration of magnetism. In the second part of the _Epistle_ Peter turns to practical instruments, describing for the first time, the construction of a magnetic compass consisting of a loadstone or iron needle pivoted with a casing marked with a scale of degrees. The third chapter of this section, concluding the _Epistle_, then continues with the description of a perpetual motion wheel, \"elaboured with marvellous ingenuity, in the pursuit of which invention I have seen many people wandering about, and wearied with manifold toil. For they did not observe that they could arrive at the mastery of this by means of the virtue, or power of this stone.\"  This tells us incidentally, that the perpetual motion device was a subject of considerable interest at this time.[42] Oddly enough, Peter does not now develop his idea of the terrella, but proceeds to something quite new, a device (see fig. 22) in which a bar-magnet loadstone is to be set towards the end of a pivoted radial arm with a circle fitted on the inside with iron \"gear teeth,\" the teeth being there not to mesh with others but to draw the magnet from one to the next, a little bead providing a counterweight to help the inertia of rotation carry the magnet from one point of attraction to the next. It is by no means the sort of device that one would naturally evolve as a means of making magnetism work perpetually, and I suggest that the toothed wheel is another instance of some vague idea of protoclocks, perhaps that of Su Sung, being transmitted from the East.  [Illustration: Figure 22.--MAGNETIC PERPETUAL MOTION WHEEL illustrated by Peter Peregrinus; from the edition of S. P. Thompson (see footnote 40).]  The work of Peter Peregrinus is cited by Roger Bacon in his _De secretis_ as well as in the _Opus majus_ and _Opus minus_. In the first and earliest of these occurs a description, taken from Ptolemy, of the construction of the (observing) armillary sphere. He says that this cannot be made to move naturally by any mathematical device, but \"a faithful and magnificent experimentor is straining to make one out of such material, and by such a device, that it will revolve naturally with the diurnal heavenly rotation.\" He continues with the statement that this possibility is also suggested by the fact that the motions of comets, of tides, and of certain planets also follow that of the Sun and of the heavens. Only in the _Opus minus_, where he repeats reference to this device, does he finally reveal that it is to be made to work by means of the loadstone.  The form of Bacon's reference to Peregrinus is strongly reminiscent of the statement by Robertus Anglicus, already mentioned as an indication of preoccupation with diurnally rotating wheels, at a date (1271) remarkably close to that of the _Epistle_ (1269)--so much so that it could well be thought that the friend to which Peter was writing was either Robert himself or somebody associated with him, perhaps at the University of Paris--a natural place to which the itinerant Peter might communicate his findings.  The fundamental question here, of course, is whether the idea of an automatic astronomical device was transmitted from Arabic, Indian, or Chinese sources, or whether it arose quite independently in this case as a natural concomitant of identifying the poles of the magnet with the poles of the heavens. We shall now attempt to show that the history of the magnetic compass might provide a quite independent argument in favour of the hypothesis that there was a 'stimulus' transmission.     The Magnetic Compass as a Fellow-traveler from China  The elusive history of the magnetic compass has many points in common with that of the mechanical clock. Just as we have astronomical models from the earliest times, so we find knowledge of the loadstone and some of its properties. Then, parallel to the development of protoclocks in China throughout the middle ages, we have the evidence analyzed by Needham, showing the use of the magnet as a divinatory device and of the (nonmagnetic) south-pointing chariot, which has been confusedly allied to the story. Curiously, and perhaps significantly the Chinese history comes to a head at just the same time for compasses and clocks, and a prime authority for the Chinese compass is Shen Kua (1030-1093) who also appears in connection with the clock of Su Sung, and who wrote about the mechanized armillary spheres and other models _ca._ 1086.  Another similarity occurs in connection with the history of the compass in medieval Europe. The treatise of Peter Peregrinus, already discussed, provides the first complete account of the magnetic compass with a pivoted needle and a circular scale, and this, as we have seen, may be connected with protoclocks and perpetual-motion devices. There are several earlier references, however, to the use of the directive properties of loadstone, mainly for use in navigation, but these earliest texts have a long history of erroneous interpretation which is only recently being cleared away. We know now that the famous passages in the _De naturis rerum_ and _De utensilibus_ of Alexander Neckham[43] (_ca._ 1187) and a text by Hugues de Berze[44] (after _ca._ 1204) refer to nothing more than a floating magnet without pivot or scale, but using a pointer at right angles to the magnet, so that it pointed to the east, rather than the north or south. A similar method is described (_ca._ 1200) in a poem by Guyot de Provins, and in a history of Jerusalem by Jacques de Vitry (1215).[45] It is of the greatest interest that, once more, all the evidence seems to be concentrated in France (Neckham was teaching in Paris) though at an earlier period than that for the protoclocks.  The date might suggest the time of the first great wave of transmissal of learning from Islam, but it is clear that in this instance, peculiar for that reason, that Islam learned of the magnetic compass only after it was already known in the West. In the earliest Persian record, some anecdotes compiled by al-'Awfiī _ca._ 1230,[46] the instrument used by the captain during a storm at sea has the form of a piece of hollow iron, shaped like a fish and made to float on the water after magnetization by rubbing with a loadstone; the fishlike form is very significant, for this is distinctly Chinese practice. In a second Muslim reference, that of Bailak al-Qabājaqī (_ca._ 1282), the ordinary wet-compass is termed \"al-konbas,\" another indication that it was foreign to that language and culture.[47]   Chronological Chart  ------------------------------------------------------------------------    CHINA    4th C., B.C.

There might well have been another wave of interest, giving the impetus to Peter Peregrinus at this time, but an earlier transmission, perhaps along the silk road or by travelers in crusades, must be postulated to account for the evidence in Europe, _ca._ 1200.

With polite smiles, the planet frustrated him at     every turn--until he found them all the hard way!_   SJAMBAK  By Jack Vance  Illustrated by VIRGIL FINLAY   Howard Frayberg, Production Director of _Know Your Universe!_, was a man of sudden unpredictable moods; and Sam Catlin, the show's Continuity Editor, had learned to expect the worst.  \"Sam,\" said Frayberg, \"regarding the show last night....\" He paused to seek the proper words, and Catlin relaxed. Frayberg's frame of mind was merely critical. \"Sam, we're in a rut. What's worse, the show's dull!\"  Sam Catlin shrugged, not committing himself.  \"_Seaweed Processors of Alphard IX_--who cares about seaweed?\"  \"It's factual stuff,\" said Sam, defensive but not wanting to go too far out on a limb. \"We bring 'em everything--color, fact, romance, sight, sound, smell.... Next week, it's the Ball Expedition to the Mixtup Mountains on Gropus.\"  Frayberg leaned forward. \"Sam, we're working the wrong slant on this stuff.... We've got to loosen up, sock 'em! Shift our ground! Give 'em the old human angle--glamor, mystery, thrills!\"  Sam Catlin curled his lips. \"I got just what you want.\"  \"Yeah? Show me.\"  Catlin reached into his waste basket. \"I filed this just ten minutes ago....\" He smoothed out the pages. \"'Sequence idea, by Wilbur Murphy. Investigate \"Horseman of Space,\" the man who rides up to meet incoming space-ships.'\"  Frayberg tilted his head to the side. \"Rides up on a _horse_?\"  \"That's what Wilbur Murphy says.\"  \"How far up?\"  \"Does it make any difference?\"  \"No--I guess not.\"  \"Well, for your information, it's up ten thousand, twenty thousand miles. He waves to the pilot, takes off his hat to the passengers, then rides back down.\"  \"And where does all this take place?\"  \"On--on--\" Catlin frowned. \"I can write it, but I can't pronounce it.\" He printed on his scratch-screen: CIRGAMESÇ.  \"Sirgamesk,\" read Frayberg.  Catlin shook his head. \"That's what it looks like--but those consonants are all aspirated gutturals. It's more like 'Hrrghameshgrrh'.\"  \"Where did Murphy get this tip?\"  \"I didn't bother to ask.\"  \"Well,\" mused Frayberg, \"we could always do a show on strange superstitions. Is Murphy around?\"  \"He's explaining his expense account to Shifkin.\"  \"Get him in here; let's talk to him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Wilbur Murphy had a blond crew-cut, a broad freckled nose, and a serious sidelong squint. He looked from his crumpled sequence idea to Catlin and Frayberg. \"Didn't like it, eh?\"  \"We thought the emphasis should be a little different,\" explained Catlin. \"Instead of 'The Space Horseman,' we'd give it the working title, 'Odd Superstitions of Hrrghameshgrrh'.\"  \"Oh, hell!\" said Frayberg. \"Call it Sirgamesk.\"  \"Anyway,\" said Catlin, \"that's the angle.\"  \"But it's not superstition,\" said Murphy.  \"Oh, come, Wilbur ...\"  \"I got this for sheer sober-sided fact. A man rides a horse up to meet the incoming ships!\"  \"Where did you get this wild fable?\"  \"My brother-in-law is purser on the _Celestial Traveller_. At Riker's Planet they make connection with the feeder line out of Cirgamesç.\"  \"Wait a minute,\" said Catlin. \"How did you pronounce that?\"  \"Cirgamesç. The steward on the shuttle-ship gave out this story, and my brother-in-law passed it along to me.\"  \"Somebody's pulling somebody's leg.\"  \"My brother-in-law wasn't, and the steward was cold sober.\"  \"They've been eating _bhang_. Sirgamesk is a Javanese planet, isn't it?\"  \"Javanese, Arab, Malay.\"  \"Then they took a _bhang_ supply with them, and _hashish_, _chat_, and a few other sociable herbs.\"  \"Well, this horseman isn't any drug-dream.\"  \"No? What is it?\"  \"So far as I know it's a man on a horse.\"  \"Ten thousand miles up? In a vacuum?\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"No space-suit?\"  \"That's the story.\"  Catlin and Frayberg looked at each other.  \"Well, Wilbur,\" Catlin began.  Frayberg interrupted. \"What we can use, Wilbur, is a sequence on Sirgamesk superstition. Emphasis on voodoo or witchcraft--naked girls dancing--stuff with roots in Earth, but now typically Sirgamesk. Lots of color. Secret rite stuff....\"  \"Not much room on Cirgamesç for secret rites.\"  \"It's a big planet, isn't it?\"  \"Not quite as big as Mars. There's no atmosphere. The settlers live in mountain valleys, with air-tight lids over 'em.\"  Catlin flipped the pages of _Thumbnail Sketches of the Inhabited Worlds_. \"Says here there's ancient ruins millions of years old. When the atmosphere went, the population went with it.\"  Frayberg became animated. \"There's lots of material out there! Go get it, Wilbur! Life! Sex! Excitement! Mystery!\"  \"Okay,\" said Wilbur Murphy.  \"But lay off this horseman-in-space. There _is_ a limit to public credulity, and don't you let anyone tell you different.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cirgamesç hung outside the port, twenty thousand miles ahead. The steward leaned over Wilbur Murphy's shoulder and pointed a long brown finger. \"It was right out there, sir. He came riding up--\"  \"What kind of a man was it? Strange-looking?\"  \"No. He was Cirgameski.\"  \"Oh. You saw him with your own eyes, eh?\"  The steward bowed, and his loose white mantle fell forward. \"Exactly, sir.\"  \"No helmet, no space-suit?\"  \"He wore a short Singhalût vest and pantaloons and a yellow Hadrasi hat. No more.\"  \"And the horse?\"  \"Ah, the horse! There's a different matter.\"  \"Different how?\"  \"I can't describe the horse. I was intent on the man.\"  \"Did you recognize him?\"  \"By the brow of Lord Allah, it's well not to look too closely when such matters occur.\"  \"Then--you _did_ recognize him!\"  \"I must be at my task, sir.\"  Murphy frowned in vexation at the steward's retreating back, then bent over his camera to check the tape-feed. If anything appeared now, and his eyes could see it, the two-hundred million audience of _Know Your Universe!_ could see it with him.  When he looked up, Murphy made a frantic grab for the stanchion, then relaxed. Cirgamesç had taken the Great Twitch. It was an illusion, a psychological quirk. One instant the planet lay ahead; then a man winked or turned away, and when he looked back, \"ahead\" had become \"below\"; the planet had swung an astonishing ninety degrees across the sky, and they were _falling_!  Murphy leaned against the stanchion. \"'The Great Twitch',\" he muttered to himself, \"I'd like to get _that_ on two hundred million screens!\"  Several hours passed. Cirgamesç grew. The Sampan Range rose up like a dark scab; the valley sultanates of Singhalût, Hadra, New Batavia, and Boeng-Bohôt showed like glistening chicken-tracks; the Great Rift Colony of Sundaman stretched down through the foothills like the trail of a slug.  A loudspeaker voice rattled the ship. \"Attention passengers for Singhalût and other points on Cirgamesç! Kindly prepare your luggage for disembarkation. Customs at Singhalût are extremely thorough. Passengers are warned to take no weapons, drugs or explosives ashore. This is important!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The warning turned out to be an understatement. Murphy was plied with questions. He suffered search of an intimate nature. He was three-dimensionally X-rayed with a range of frequencies calculated to excite fluorescence in whatever object he might have secreted in his stomach, in a hollow bone, or under a layer of flesh.  His luggage was explored with similar minute attention, and Murphy rescued his cameras with difficulty. \"What're you so damn anxious about? I don't have drugs; I don't have contraband ...\"  \"It's guns, your excellency. Guns, weapons, explosives ...\"  \"I don't have any guns.\"  \"But these objects here?\"  \"They're cameras. They record pictures and sounds and smells.\"  The inspector seized the cases with a glittering smile of triumph. \"They resemble no cameras of my experience; I fear I shall have to impound ...\"  A young man in loose white pantaloons, a pink vest, pale green cravat and a complex black turban strolled up. The inspector made a swift obeisance, with arms spread wide. \"Excellency.\"  The young man raised two fingers. \"You may find it possible to spare Mr. Murphy any unnecessary formality.\"  \"As your Excellency recommends....\" The inspector nimbly repacked Murphy's belongings, while the young man looked on benignly.  Murphy covertly inspected his face. The skin was smooth, the color of the rising moon; the eyes were narrow, dark, superficially placid. The effect was of silken punctilio with hot ruby blood close beneath.  Satisfied with the inspector's zeal, he turned to Murphy. \"Allow me to introduce myself, Tuan Murphy. I am Ali-Tomás, of the House of Singhalût, and my father the Sultan begs you to accept our poor hospitality.\"  \"Why, thank you,\" said Murphy. \"This is a very pleasant surprise.\"  \"If you will allow me to conduct you....\" He turned to the inspector. \"Mr. Murphy's luggage to the palace.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Murphy accompanied Ali-Tomás into the outside light, fitting his own quick step to the prince's feline saunter. This is coming it pretty soft, he said to himself. I'll have a magnificent suite, with bowls of fruit and gin pahits, not to mention two or three silken girls with skin like rich cream bringing me towels in the shower.... Well, well, well, it's not so bad working for _Know Your Universe!_ after all! I suppose I ought to unlimber my camera....  Prince Ali-Tomás watched him with interest. \"And what is the audience of _Know Your Universe!_?\"  \"We call 'em 'participants'.\"  \"Expressive. And how many participants do you serve?\"  \"Oh, the Bowdler Index rises and falls. We've got about two hundred million screens, with five hundred million participants.\"  \"Fascinating! And tell me--how do you record smells?\"  Murphy displayed the odor recorder on the side of the camera, with its gelatinous track which fixed the molecular design.  \"And the odors recreated--they are like the "]]]
