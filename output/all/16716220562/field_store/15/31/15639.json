Silence like grave-yard air, again,     Pervades the festive space:   All list for another minstrel strain;     And the youth, with merrier face,   But tender notes, thus half-divulged   The passion which his heart indulged:--   The Minstrel's Song.    O choose thou the maid with the gentle blue eye,   That speaketh so softly, and looketh so shy;         Who weepeth for pity,         To hear a love ditty,   And marketh the end with a sigh.    If thou weddest a maid with a wide staring look,   Who babbleth as loud as the rain-swollen brook,         Each day for the morrow         Will nurture more sorrow,--   Each sun paint thy shadow a-crook.    The maid that is gentle will make a kind wife;   The magpie that prateth will stir thee to strife:         'Twere better to tarry,         Unless thou canst marry   To sweeten the bitters of life!      *       *       *       *       *    What fires the youthful minstrel's lay     Lit in De Thorold's eyes,   It needs not, now, I soothly say:   Sweet Edith had softly stolen away,--     And 'mid his own surprise,   Blent with the boisterous applause   That, instant, to the rafters rose,   The baron his jealous thought forgot.   Quickly, sithence a jocund note   Was fairly struck in every mind,   And jolly ale its power combined   To fill all hearts with deeper glee,--   All wished for gleeful minstrelsy;   And every eye was shrewdly bent   On one whose caustic merriment   At many a blythe Yule-tide had bin   Compelling cause of mirthful grin   To ancient Torksey's rustic folk.    Full soon this sturdy summons broke   From sire and son, and maid and mother:--   \"Ho, ho! saint Leonard's fat lay brother!   Why dost thou in the corner peep,   And sipple as if half asleep   Thou wert with this good nappy ale?   Come, rouse thee! for thy sly old tale   Of the Miller of Roche and the hornless devil,   We'll hear, or we leave our Yule-night revel!   Thy folded cloak come cast aside!--   Beneath it thou dost thy rebeck hide--   It is thy old trick--we know it well--   Pledge all! and thy ditty begin to tell!\"   \"Pledge all, pledge all!\" the baron cried;   \"Let mirth be free at good Yule-tide!\"    Then, forth the lay brother his rebeck drew,     And athwart the triple string   The bow in gamesome mood he threw,--     His joke-song preluding;--   Soon, with sly look, the burly man,   In burly tones his tale began.   The Miller of Roche.[12]  THE LAY BROTHER OF SAINT LEONARD'S TALE.      O the Prior of Roche     Was without reproach   While with saintly monks he chanted;     But when from the mass     He had turned his face,   The prior his saintship scanted.      O the Miller of Roche,--     I swear and avouch,--   Had a wife of nut-brown beauty;     And to shrive her,--they say,--     The prior, each day,   Came with zeal to his ghostly duty.      But the neighbouring wives,     Who ne'er shrove in their lives,--   Such wickedness Sathanas whispers!--     Said the black-cloaked prior     By the miller's log fire,   Oft tarried too late for vespers!      O the thunder was loud,     And the sky wore a shroud,   And the lightning blue was gleaming;     And the foaming flood,     Where the good mill stood,   Pell-mell o'er the dam was teeming.      O the Miller, that night,     Toiled on in a fright,--   Though, through terror, few bushels he grinded!     Yet, although he'd stayed long,     The storm was so strong   That full loath to depart was he minded.      Lo! at midnight a jolt,     As loud as the bolt   Of the thunder on high that still rumbled,     Assailed the mill-doors,     And burst them, perforce,--   And in a drenched beggar-lad stumbled!      \"Saint Luke and saint John     Save the ground we stand on\"--   Cried the Miller,--\"but ye come in a hurry;\"     While the lad, turning pale,     'Gan to weep and to wail,   And to patter this pitiful story:      \"Goodman Miller, I pray,     Believe what I say,--   For, as surely as thou art a sinner,--     Since the break of the morn     I have wandered forlorn,   And have neither had breakfast nor dinner!\"      O the Miller looked sad,     And cried, \"Good lack, my lad!   But ye tell me a dolorous ditty!--     And ye seem in sad plight     To travel to-night:--   The sight o' ye stirs up one's pity!      \"Go straight to my cot,     And beg something that's hot,--   For ye look very haggard and hollow:--     The storm's nearly o'er;     I will not grind much more,--   And when I have done, I will follow.      \"Keep by the brook-side!     The path is not wide--   But ye cannot soon stray, if ye mind it;--     At the foot of the hill,     Half a mile from the mill,   Stands my cottage:--ye can't fail to find it.\"      Then out the lad set,     All dripping with wet,--   But the skies around him seemed brighter;     And he went gaily on,--     For his burthen was gone,--   And his heart in his bosom danced lighter.      Adown by the brook     His travel he took,   And soon raught the Miller's snug dwelling;--     But, what he saw ere     He was admitted there--   By Saint Bridget!--I must not be telling!      Thus much I may say--     That the cot was of clay,   And the light was through wind-cracks ejected;     And he placed close his eye,     And peeped in, so sly,--   And saw--what he never expected!      O the lad 'gan to fear     That the Miller would appear,--   And, to him, this strange sight would be vexing;     So he, first, sharply coughed,     And, then, knocked very soft,--   Lest his summons should be too perplexing.      But, I scorn to think harm!--     So pass by all alarm,   And trembling, and bustle, and terror,     Occasioned within:     The first stone at sin   Let him cast who, himself, hath no error!      In inquisitive mood,     The eaves-dropper stood,   By the wind-cracks still keeping his station;     Till, half-choked with fear,     A voice cried, \"Who's there?\"--   Cried the beggar, \"Mary grant ye salvation!--      \"I'm a poor beggar-lad,     Very hungry and sad,   Who have travelled in rain and in thunder;     I am soaked, through and through\"--     Cried the voice, \"Perhaps 'tis true--    But who's likely to help thee, I wonder?      \"Here's a strange time of night     To put folk in a fright,   By waking them up from their bolsters!--     Honest folk, by Saint Paul!     Abroad never crawl,   At the gloom-hour of night--when the owl stirs!\"      But the Miller now came,     And, hearing his dame   So sharply the beggar-lad scolding,     Said, \"Open, sweet Joan!     And I'll tell thee, anon,--   When thy brown cheek, once more, I'm beholding,      \"Why this poor lad is found     So late on our ground--   Haste, my pigeon!--for here there's hard bedding!\"--     So the door was unbarred;--     But the wife she frowned hard,   As the lad, by the door, thrust his head in.      And she looked very cold     While her lord the tale told;   And then she made oath, by our Lady,--     Such wandering elves     Might provide for themselves--   For she would get no supper ready!      O the Miller waxed wroth,     And vowed, by his troth,--   While the beggar slunk into a corner,--     If his termagant wife     Did not end her ill strife,   He would change words for blows, he'd forewarn her!      O the lad he looked sly,     And with mischievous eye,   Cried, \"Bridle your wrath, Goodman Grinder!--     Don't be in a pet,--     For I don't care a fret!--   Your wife, in a trice, will be kinder!      \"In the stars I have skill,     And their powers, at my will,   I can summon, with food to provide us:     Say,--what d'ye choose?     I pray, don't refuse:--   Neither hunger nor thirst shall betide us!\"      O the Miller he frowned,     And rolled his eyes round,   And seemed not the joke to be liking;     But the lad did not heed:     He was at his strange deed,   And the table was chalking and striking!      With scrawls straight and crookt,     And with signs square and hookt,   With the lord of each house, or the lady,     The table he filled,     Like a clerk 'ith' stars skilled,--   And, striking, cried \"Presto! be ready!--      \"A jug of spiced wine     'S in the box,--I divine!   Ask thy wife for the key, and unlock it!--     Nay, stop!\" the lad said;     \"We shall want meat and bread;\"   And the chalk took again from his pocket.      O the lad he looked wise,     And, in scholarly guise,   Completed his horary question:--     \"A brace of roast ducks     Thou wilt find in the box,   With the wine--sure as I am a Christian!--      \"And a white wheaten loaf;--     Quick! proceed to the proof!\"--   Cried the beggar,--while Grist stood stark staring;--     Though the lad's weasel eyes     Shone so wondrously wise,   That to doubt him seemed sin over-daring!      O the Miller's wife, Joan,     Turning pale, 'gan to groan;   But the Miller, arousing his spirits,     Said, \"Hand me the key,     And our luck we will see--   A faint heart no fortune inherits.\"      But,--Gramercy!--his looks--     When he opened the box,   And at what he saw in it stood wondering!     How his sturdy arm shook,     While the wine-jug he took,   And feared he would break it with blundering!      Faith and troth! at the last,     On the table Grist placed   The wine and the ducks--hot and smoking!     Yet he felt grievous shy     His stomach to try   With cates of a wizard's own cooking!      But, with hunger grown fell,     The lad sped so well,   That Grist was soon tempted to join in;     While Joan sat apart,     And looked sad at heart,   And some fearful mishap seemed divining!      O the lad chopped away,     And smiling so gay,   Told stories to make his host merry:--     How the Moon kittened stars,--     And how Venus loved Mars,   And often went to see him in a wherry!      O the Miller he laughed,     And the liquor he quaffed;   But the beggar new marvels was hatching:--     Quoth he \"I'm a clerk,     And I swear, by saint Mark,   That the Devil from hell I'll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29722"],["title","The Baron's Yule Feast: A Christmas Rhyme (#4)"],["body"," fetching!\"--      O the wife she looked scared,     And wildly Grist stared,   And cried, \"Nay, my lad, nay,--thou'rt not able!\"--     But the lad plied his chalk,     And muttered strange talk--   Till Grist drew his stool from the table!      Then the lad quenched the rush,     And cried, \"Bring a gorse-bush,   And under the caldron now kindle!\"--     But the Miller cried, \"Nay!     Give over, I pray!\"--   For his courage began fast to dwindle.      Quoth the lad, \"I must on     Till my conjuring's done;   To break off just now would be ruin:     So fetch me the thorns,--     And a devil without horns,   In the copper I soon will be brewing!\"--      O the Miller he shook     For fear his strange cook   Should, indeed and in truth, prove successful;     But feeling ashamed     That his pluck should be blamed,   Strove to smother his heart-quake distressful.      So the fuel he brought,     And said he feared nought   Of the Devil being brewed in his copper:     He'd as quickly believe     Nick would sit in his sieve,   Or dance 'mong the wheat in his hopper:--      And yet, lest strange ill,     From such conjuring skill,   Should arise, and their souls be in danger,--     He would have his crab-stick,     And would show my lord Nick   Some tricks to which he was a stranger!      O the lad 'gan to raise     'Neath the caldron a blaze,--   While the Miller, his crab-cudgel grasping,     Stood on watch, for his life!--     But his terrified wife   Her hands--in devotion--was clasping!      When the copper grew warm,     Quoth the lad, \"Lest some harm   From the visit of Nick be betiding,--     Set open the door,     And not long on the floor   Will the Goblin of Hell be abiding!\"      Quickly so did the host,     And returned to his post,--   Uplifting his cudgel with trembling:--     His strength was soon proved,--     For the copper-lid moved!--   When Grist's fears grew too big for dissembling.      Turning white as the wall,     His staff he let fall,--   While the Devil from the caldron ascended,--     And, all on a heap,--     With a flying leap,   On the fear-stricken Miller descended!      In dread lest his soul,     In the Devil's foul goal,   Should be burnt to a spiritual cinder,--     Grist grabbed the Fiend's throat,     And his grisly eyes smote,--   Till Nick's face seemed a platter of tinder!      Yea, with many a thwack,     Grist battered Nick's back,--   Nor spared Satan's portly abdomen!--     Hot Nick had lain cold     By this time--but his hold   Grist lost, through the screams of his woman!      While up from the floor,     And out, at the door,   Went the Fiend, with the skip of a dancer!     He seemed panic-struck,--     Or, doubted his luck,--   For he neither staid question nor answer!      \"Grist!\" the beggar-lad cried,     \"Lay your trembling aside,   And tell me, my man, how ye like him.     'Twas well ye were cool:     He'd have proved ye a fool,--   Had ye dar'd with the cudgel to strike him!\"      \"By saint Martin!\" Grist said,     And, scratching his head,   Seemed pondering between good and evil,--     \"I could swear and avouch     'Twas the Prior of Roche,--   If thou hadst not said 'twas the Devil!\"      And, in deed and in sooth,--     Though a marvellous truth,--   Yet such was the Fiend's revelation!--     But think it not strange     He should choose such a change:--   'Tis much after his old occupation:--      An angel of light,     'Tis his darling delight   To be reckoned--'tis very well tested:--     I argue, therefore,     'Twas not sinning much more,   In the garb of a Prior to be vested.      Though, with wink, nod, and smile--     O the world's very vile!--   Grist's neighbours told tales unbelieving,--     How the beggar, so shrewd,     Monk and supper had viewed,   And produced 'em!--the Miller deceiving!      But I do not belong     To that heretic throng   Who measure their faith with their eyesight:--     Thus much I may say--     Grist's cottage of clay   Never, now, doth the Prior of Roche visit:--      But, the sly beggar-lad,     Be he hungry or sad,   A remedy finds for each evil     In the Miller's good cheer,     Any day of the year;--   And though Joan looketh shy--_she is civil_!      *       *       *       *       *    The tale was rude, but pleased rude men;   And clamorous many a clown grew, when     The rebeck ceased to thrill:   Ploughboy and neatherd, shepherd swain,   Gosherd and swineherd,--all were fain     To prove their tuneful skill.    But, now, Sir Wilfrid waved his hand,   And gently stilled the jarring band:   \"What ho!\" he cried, \"what ails your throats?   Be these your most melodious notes?   Forget ye that to-morrow morn   Old Yule-day and its sports return,--   And that your freres, from scrogg and carr,[13]   From heath and wold, and fen, afar,   Will come to join ye in your glee?   Husband your mirth and minstrelsy,   And let some goodly portion be   Kept for their entertainment meet.   Meanwhile, let frolic guide your feet,     And warm your winter blood!   Good night to all!--For His dear sake   Who bore our sin, if well we wake,   We'll join to banish care and sorrow   With mirth and sport again to-morrow!\"     And forth the Baron good   Passed from his chair, midst looks of love   That showed how truly was enwove   Full, free, and heartfelt gratitude   For kindly deeds, in bosoms rude.    The broad hall-doors were open cast,   And, smiling, forth De Thorold passed.   Yet, was the crowning hour unflown--     Enjoyment's crowning hour!--   A signal note the pipe hath blown,     And a maiden at the door   Craves curtsied leave, with roseate blush,   To bring the sacred missel-bush.    Gaily a younker leads the fair,   Proud of his dimpled, blushing care:   All clap their hands, both old and young,   And soon the misseltoe is hung   In the mid-rafters, overhead;   And, while the agile dance they thread,   Such honey do the plough-lads seize   From lips of lasses as the bees   Ne'er sip from sweetest flowers of May.    All in the rapture of their play,--   While shrilly swells the mirthsome pipe,   And merrily their light feet trip,--   Leave we the simple happy throng   Their mirth and rapture to prolong.       THE   BARON'S YULE FEAST.    A   Christmas Rhyme.    CANTO III.     Mirth-verse from thee, rude leveller!   Of late, thy dungeon-harpings were     Of discontent and wrong;   And we, the Privileged, were banned   For cumber-grounds of fatherland,     In thy drear prison-song.    What fellowship hast thou with times   When love-thralled minstrels chaunted rhymes     At feast, in feudal hall,--   And peasant churls, a saucy crew,   Fantastic o'er their wassail grew,     Forgetful of their thrall?--    Lordlings, your scorn awhile forbear,--   And with the homely Past compare     Your tinselled show and state!   Mark, if your selfish grandeurs cold   On human hearts so firm a hold     For ye, and yours, create   As they possessed, whose breasts though rude   Glowed with the warmth of brotherhood   For all who toiled, through youth and age,   T' enrich their force-won heritage!    Mark, if ye feel your swollen pride   Secure, ere ye begin to chide!   Then, lordlings, though ye may discard     The measures I rehearse,   Slight not the lessons of the bard--     The moral of his verse.--    But _we_ will dare thy verse to chide!   Wouldst re-enact the Barmecide,     And taunt our wretchedness   With visioned feast, and song, and dance,--   While, daily, our grim heritance     Is famine and distress?    Hast thou forgot thy pledges stern,   Never from Suffering's cause to turn,     But--to the end of life--   Against Oppression's ruthless band   Still unsubduable to stand,     A champion in the strife?    Think'st thou we suffer less, or feel   To-day's soul-piercing wounds do heal     The wounds of months and years?   Or that our eyes so long have been   Familiar with the hunger keen   Our babes endure, we gaze serene--     Strangers to scalding tears?--    Ah no! my brothers, not from me   Hath faded solemn memory     Of all your bitter grief:   This heart its pledges doth renew--   To its last pulse it will be true     To beat for your relief.    My rhymes are trivial, but my aim     Deem ye not purposeless:   I would the homely truth proclaim--   That times which knaves full loudly blame     For feudal haughtiness   Would put the grinding crew to shame     Who prey on your distress.    O that my simple lay might tend     To kindle some remorse   In your oppressors' souls, and bend   Their wills a cheerful help to lend     And lighten Labour's curse!      *       *       *       *       *    A night of snow the earth hath clad     With virgin mantle chill;   But in the sky the sun looks glad,--     And blythely o'er the hill,   From fen and wold, troops many a guest   To sing and smile at Thorold's feast.    And oft they bless the bounteous sun     That smileth on the snow;   And oft they bless the generous one     Their homes that bids them fro   To glad their hearts with merry cheer,   When Yule returns, in winter drear.    How joyously the lady bells     Shout--though the bluff north-breeze   Loudly his boisterous bugle swells!     And though the brooklets freeze,   How fair the leafless hawthorn-tree   Waves with its hoar-frost tracery!   While sun-smiles throw o'er stalks and stems   Sparkles so far transcending gems--   The bard would gloze who said their sheen     Did not out-diamond   All brightest gauds that man hath seen   Worn by earth's proudest king or queen,     In pomp and grandeur throned!    Saint Leonard's monks have chaunted mass,   And clown's and gossip's laughing face     Is turned unto the porch,--   For now comes mime and motley fool,   Guarding the dizened Lord Misrule     With mimic pomp and march;   And the burly Abbot of Unreason   Forgets not that the blythe Yule season     Demands his paunch at church;         And he useth his staff         While the rustics laugh,--   And, still, as he layeth "]]]
