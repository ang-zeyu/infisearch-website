You will need time to think to see all of them.  \"It does not permit time travel as we have thought of time travel, but it gives us immortality of a sort. Immortality of the kind I have temporarily given us.  \"_Is it good?_ Is it worth while to lose the memory of fifty years of one's life in order to return one's body to relative youth? The only way I can find out is to try, as soon as I have finished writing this and made my other preparations.  \"You will know the answer.  \"But before you decide, remember that there is another problem, more important than the psychological one. I mean overpopulation.  \"If our discovery is given to the world, if all who are old or dying can make themselves young again, the population will almost double every generation. Nor would the world--not even our own relatively enlightened country--be willing to accept compulsory birth control as a solution.  \"Give this to the world, as the world is today in 2004, and within a generation there will be famine, suffering, war. Perhaps a complete collapse of civilization.  \"Yes, we have reached other planets, but they are not suitable for colonizing. The stars may be our answer, but we are a long way from reaching them. When we do, someday, the billions of habitable planets that must be out there will be our answer ... our living room. But until then, what is the answer?  \"Destroy the machine? But think of the countless lives it can save, the suffering it can prevent. Think of what it would mean to a man dying of cancer. Think ...\"         *       *       *       *       *  Think. You finish the letter and put it down.  You think of Barbara dead for forty-five years. And of the fact that you were married to her for three years and that those years are lost to you.  Fifty years lost. You damn the old man of seventy-five whom you became and who has done this to you ... who has given you this decision to make.  Bitterly, you know what the decision must be. You think that _he_ knew, too, and realize that he could safely leave it in your hands. Damn him, he _should_ have known.  Too valuable to destroy, too dangerous to give.  The other answer is painfully obvious.  You must be custodian of this discovery and keep it secret until it is safe to give, until mankind has expanded to the stars and has new worlds to populate, or until, even without that, he has reached a state of civilization where he can avoid overpopulation by rationing births to the number of accidental--or voluntary--deaths.  If neither of those things has happened in another fifty years (and are they likely so soon?), then you, at seventy-five, will be writing another letter like this one. You will be undergoing another experience similar to the one you're going through now. And making the same decision, of course.  Why not? You'll be the same person again.  Time and again, to preserve this secret until Man is ready for it.  How often will you again sit at a desk like this one, thinking the thoughts you are thinking now, feeling the grief you now feel?  There is a click at the door and you know that the time lock has opened, that you are now free to leave this room, free to start a new life for yourself in place of the one you have already lived and lost.  But you are in no hurry now to walk directly through that door.  You sit there, staring straight ahead of you blindly, seeing in your mind's eye the vista of a set of facing mirrors, like those in an old-fashioned barber shop, reflecting the same thing over and over again, diminishing into far distance.                                                         --FREDRIC BROWN     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ December 1953.

London   JEREMIAH HOW    209 Picadilley   1846     TO  THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON.     Lady, receive a tributary lay     From one who cringeth not to titled state     Conventional, and lacketh will to prate   Of comeliness--though thine, to which did pay   The haughty Childe his tuneful homage, may     No minstrel deem a harp-theme derogate.     I reckon thee among the truly great   And fair, because with genius thou dost sway   The thought of thousands, while thy noble heart     With pity glows for Suffering, and with zeal   Cordial relief and solace to impart.     Thou didst, while I rehearsed Toil's wrongs, reveal   Such yearnings! Plead! let England hear thee plead   With eloquent tongue,--that Toil from wrong be freed!     ADVERTISEMENT.   Several pieces in the following Rhyme were written many years ago, and will be recognised by my early friends. They were the fruit of impressions derived from the local associations of boyhood, (of which, the reader, if inclined, may learn more in the notes,) and of an admiration created by the exquisite beauty and simplicity of Coleridge's 'Christabel,'--which I had by heart, and used to repeat to Thomas Miller, my playmate and companion from infancy, during many a delightful 'Day in the Woods,' and pleasing ramble on the hills and in the woods above Gainsborough, and along the banks of Trent.  I offer but one apology for the production of a metrical essay, composed chiefly of imperfect and immature pieces:--the ambition to contribute towards the fund of Christmas entertainment, in which agreeable labour I see many popular names engaged,--and among them, one, the most deservedly popular in the literature of the day. The favour with which an influential portion of the press has received my 'Prison Rhyme' emboldens me to take this step; and if the flagellation of criticism be not too keenly dealt upon me for the imperfections in the few pages that follow, I will be content, in this instance, to expect no praise.  134, _Blackfriars Road_,  _Dec. 20. 1845_.       THE   BARON'S YULE FEAST.    A   Christmas Rhyme.     CANTO I.     Right beautiful is Torksey's hall,[1]     Adown by meadowed Trent;   Right beautiful that mouldering wall,   And remnant of a turret tall,     Shorn of its battlement.    For, while the children of the Spring     Blush into life, and die;   And Summer's joy-birds take light wing     When Autumn mists are nigh;   And soon the year--a winterling--   With its fall'n leaves doth lie;         That ruin gray--         Mirror'd, alway,   Deep in the silver stream,   Doth summon weird-wrought visions vast,   That show the actors of the past     Pictured, as in a dream.    Meseemeth, now, before mine eyes,   The pomp-clad phantoms dimly rise,     Till the full pageant bright--   A throng of warrior-barons bold,   Glittering in burnished steel and gold,     Bursts on my glowing sight.    And, mingles with the martial train,   Full many a fair-tressed beauty vain,     On palfrey and jennet--   That proudly toss the tasselled rein,     And daintily curvet;         And war-steeds prance,         And rich plumes glance     On helm and burgonet;         And lances crash,         And falchions flash   Of knights in tourney met.    Fast fades the joust!--and fierce forms frown     That man the leaguered tower,--   Nor quail to scan the kingly crown     That leads the leaguering power.    Trumpet and \"rescue\" ring!--and, soon,     He who began the strife   Is fain to crave one paltry boon:--     The thrall-king begs his life!    Our fathers and their throbbing toil     Are hushed in pulseless death;   Hushed is the dire and deadly broil--     The tempest of their wrath;--   Yet, of their deeds not all for spoil     Is thine, O sateless Grave!   Songs of their brother-hours shall foil     Thy triumph o'er the brave!    Their bravery take, and darkly hide     Deep in thy inmost hold!   Take all their mailëd pomp and pride     To deck thy mansions cold!   Plunderer! thou hast but purified     Their memories from alloy:   Faults of the dead we scorn to chide--     Their virtues sing with joy.    Lord of our fathers' ashes! list     A carol of their mirth;   Nor shake thy nieve, chill moralist!     To check their sons' joy-birth:--    It is the season when our sires     Kept jocund holiday;   And, now, around our charier fires,     Old Yule shall have a lay:--   A prison-bard is once more free;   And, ere he yields his voice to thee,   His song a merry-song shall be!      *       *       *       *       *    Sir Wilfrid de Thorold[2] freely holds     What his stout sires held before--   Broad lands for plough, and fruitful folds,--     Though by gold he sets no store;   And he saith, from fen and woodland wolds,     From marish, heath, and moor,--         To feast in his hall,         Both free and thrall,     Shall come as they came of yore.    \"Let the merry bells ring out!\" saith he     To my lady of the Fosse;[3]   \"We will keep the birth-eve joyfully     Of our Lord who bore the cross!\"    \"Let the merry bells ring loud!\" he saith     To saint Leonard's shaven prior;[4]   \"Bid thy losel monks that patter of faith     Shew works, and never tire.\"   Saith the lord of saint Leonard's: \"The brotherhood     Will ring and never tire   For a beck or a nod of the Baron good;\"--     Saith Sir Wilfrid: \"They will--for hire!\"    Then, turning to his daughter fair,   Who leaned on her father's carven chair,--         He said,--and smiled         On his peerless child,--   His jewel whose price no clerk could tell,         Though the clerk had told         Sea sands for gold;--   For her dear mother's sake he loved her well,--   But more for the balm her tenderness   Had poured on his widowed heart's distress;--     More, still more, for her own heart's grace     That so lovelily shone in her lovely face,     And drew all eyes its love to trace--   Left all tongues languageless!--          He said,--and smiled         On his peerless child,   \"Sweet bird! bid Hugh our seneschal   Send to saint Leonard's, ere even-fall,   A fat fed beeve, and a two-shear sheep,   With a firkin of ale that a monk in his sleep   May hear to hum, when it feels the broach,   And wake up and swig, without reproach!--   And the nuns of the Fosse--for wassail-bread--   Let them have wheat, both white and red;   And a runlet of mead, with a jug of the wine   Which the merchant-man vowed he brought from the Rhine;   And bid Hugh say that their bells must ring     A peal loud and long,     While we chaunt heart-song,   For the birth of our heavenly king!\"    Now merrily ring the lady-bells     Of the nunnery by the Fosse:--   Say the hinds, \"Their silver music swells   Like the blessed angels' syllables,     At his birth who bore the cross!\"    And solemnly swells saint Leonard's chime     And the great bell loud and deep:--   Say the gossips, \"Let's talk of the holy time     When the shepherds watched their sheep;   And the Babe was born for all souls' crime     In the weakness of flesh to weep.\"--   But, anon, shrills the pipe of the merry mime,     And their simple hearts upleap.    \"God save your souls, good Christian folk!     God save your souls from sin!--   Blythe Yule is come--let us blythely joke!\"--     Cry the mummers, ere they begin.    Then, plough-boy Jack, in kirtle gay,--     Though shod with clouted shoon,--   Stands forth the wilful maid to play   Who ever saith to her lover \"Nay\"--     When he sues for a lover's boon.    While Hob the smith with sturdy arm     Circleth the feignëd maid;   And, spite of Jack's assumed alarm,   Busseth his lips, like a lover warm,     And will not \"Nay\" be said.    Then loffe the gossips, as if wit     Were mingled with the joke:--   Gentles,--they were with folly smit,--   Natheless, their memories acquit     Of crime--these simple folk!    No harmful thoughts their revels blight,--   Devoid of bitter hate and spite,     They hold their merriment;--   And, till the chimes tell noon at night,     Their joy shall be unspent!    \"Come haste ye to bold Thorold's hall,     And crowd his kitchen wide;   For there, he saith, both free and thrall     Shall sport this good Yule-tide!    \"Come hasten, gossips!\" the mummers cry,     Throughout old Torksey town;   \"We'll hasten!\" they answer, joyfully,     The gossip and the clown.    Heigho! whence cometh that cheery shout?   'Tis the Yule-log troop,--a merry rout!   The gray old ash that so bravely stood,   The pride of the Past, in Thorney wood,[5]   They have levelled for honour of welcome Yule;   And kirtled Jack is placed astride:   On the log to the grunsel[6] he shall ride!    \"Losels, yoke all! yoke to, and pull!\"   Cries Dick the wright, on long-eared steed;         \"He shall have thwack         On lazy back,   That yoketh him not, in time of need!\"         A long wain-whip         Dick doth equip,   And with beans in the bladder at end of thong,   It seemeth to threaten strokes sturdy and strong;--         Yet clown and maid         Give eager aid,--   And all, as they rattle the huge block along,         Seem to court the joke         Of Dick's wain-whip stroke,--   Be it ever so smart, none thinks he hath wrong;--         Till with mirthsome glee,         The old ash tree   Hath come to the threshold of Torksey hall,--         Where its brave old heart         A glow shall impart   To the heart of each guest at the festival.    And through the porch, a jocund crowd,   They rush, with heart-born laughter loud;   And still the merry mimesters call,   With jest and gibe, \"Laugh, losels all!\"    Then in the laden sewers troop,   With plattered beef and foaming stoup:--   \"Make merry, neighbours!\" cries good Hugh,     The white-haired seneschal:   \"Ye trow, bold Thorold welcomes you--     Make merry, my masters, all!\""]]]
