The stunted children come and go   In squalid lanes and alleys black;   We follow but the beaten track   Of other nations, and we grow   In wealth for some -- for many, woe.    And it may be that we who live   In this new land apart, beyond   The hard old world grown fierce and fond   And bound by precedent and bond,   May read the riddle right and give   New hope to those who dimly see   That all things may be yet for good,   And teach the world at length to be   One vast united brotherhood.         .    .    .    .    .    So may it be, and he who sings   In accents hopeful, clear, and strong,   The glories which that future brings   Shall sing, indeed, a wond'rous song.     Anthony Considine      Out in the wastes of the West countrie,    Out where the white stars shine,   Grim and silent as such men be,   Rideth a man with a history --    Anthony Considine.    For the ways of men they are manifold    As their differing views in life;   For some are sold for the lust of gold    And some for the lust of strife:   But this man counted the world well lost    For the love of his neighbour's wife.    They fled together, as those must flee    Whom all men hold in blame;   Each to the other must all things be   Who cross the gulf of iniquity    And live in the land of shame.    But a light-o'-love, if she sins with one,    She sinneth with ninety-nine:   The rule holds good since the world begun --   Since ever the streams began to run    And the stars began to shine.   The rule holds true, and he found it true --    Anthony Considine.    A nobler spirit had turned in scorn    From a love that was stained with mire;   A weaker being might mourn and mourn    For the loss of his Heart's Desire:   But the anger of Anthony Considine    Blazed up like a flaming fire.    And she, with her new love, presently    Came past with her eyes ashine;   And God so willed it, and God knows why,   She turned and laughed as they passed him by --    Anthony Considine.    Her laughter stung as a whip might sting;    And mad with his wounded pride   He turned and sprang with a panther's spring    And struck at his rival's side:   And only the woman, shuddering,    Could tell how the dead man died!    She dared not speak -- and the mystery    Is buried in auld lang syne,   But out on the wastes of the West countrie,   Grim and silent as such men be,   Rideth a man with a history --    Anthony Considine.     Song of the Artesian Water      Now the stock have started dying, for the Lord has sent a drought;   But we're sick of prayers and Providence -- we're going to do without;   With the derricks up above us and the solid earth below,   We are waiting at the lever for the word to let her go.       Sinking down, deeper down,       Oh, we'll sink it deeper down:   As the drill is plugging downward at a thousand feet of level,   If the Lord won't send us water, oh, we'll get it from the devil;   Yes, we'll get it from the devil deeper down.    Now, our engine's built in Glasgow by a very canny Scot,   And he marked it twenty horse-power, but he don't know what is what:   When Canadian Bill is firing with the sun-dried gidgee logs,   She can equal thirty horses and a score or so of dogs.       Sinking down, deeper down,       Oh, we're going deeper down:   If we fail to get the water then it's ruin to the squatter,   For the drought is on the station and the weather's growing hotter,   But we're bound to get the water deeper down.    But the shaft has started caving and the sinking's very slow,   And the yellow rods are bending in the water down below,   And the tubes are always jamming and they can't be made to shift   Till we nearly burst the engine with a forty horse-power lift.       Sinking down, deeper down,       Oh, we're going deeper down   Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,   Yet we'll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming --   While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.    But there's no artesian water, though we've passed three thousand feet,   And the contract price is growing and the boss is nearly beat.   But it must be down beneath us, and it's down we've got to go,   Though she's bumping on the solid rock four thousand feet below.       Sinking down, deeper down,       Oh, we're going deeper down:   And it's time they heard us knocking on the roof of Satan's dwellin';   But we'll get artesian water if we cave the roof of hell in --   Oh! we'll get artesian water deeper down.    But it's hark! the whistle's blowing with a wild, exultant blast,   And the boys are madly cheering, for they've struck the flow at last,   And it's rushing up the tubing from four thousand feet below   Till it spouts above the casing in a million-gallon flow.       And it's down, deeper down --       Oh, it comes from deeper down;   It is flowing, ever flowing, in a free, unstinted measure   From the silent hidden places where the old earth hides her treasure --   Where the old earth hides her treasure deeper down.    And it's clear away the timber, and it's let the water run:   How it glimmers in the shadow, how it flashes in the sun!   By the silent belts of timber, by the miles of blazing plain   It is bringing hope and comfort to the thirsty land again.       Flowing down, further down;       It is flowing further down   To the tortured thirsty cattle, bringing gladness in its going;   Through the droughty days of summer it is flowing, ever flowing --   It is flowing, ever flowing, further down.     A Disqualified Jockey's Story      You see, the thing was this way -- there was me,   That rode Panoppoly, the Splendor mare,   And Ikey Chambers on the Iron Dook,   And Smith, the half-caste rider, on Regret,   And that long bloke from Wagga -- him what rode   Veronikew, the Snowy River horse.   Well, none of them had chances -- not a chance   Among the lot, unless the rest fell dead   Or wasn't trying -- for a blind man's dog   Could see Enchantress was a certain cop,   And all the books was layin' six to four.    They brought her out to show our lot the road,   Or so they said; but, then, Gord's truth! you know,   You can't believe 'em, though they took an oath   On forty Bibles that they'd tell the truth.   But anyhow, an amateur was up   On this Enchantress, and so Ike and me,   We thought that we might frighten him a bit   By asking if he minded riding rough --   'Oh, not at all,' says he, 'oh, not at all!   I learnt at Robbo Park, and if it comes   To bumping I'm your Moses!  Strike me blue!'   Says he, 'I'll bump you over either rail,   The inside rail or outside -- which you choose   Is good enough for me' -- which settled Ike;   For he was shaky since he near got killed   From being sent a buster on the rail,   When some chap bumped his horse and fetched him down   At Stony Bridge, so Ikey thought it best   To leave this bloke alone, and I agreed.    So all the books was layin' six to four   Against the favourite, and the amateur   Was walking this Enchantress up and down,   And me and Smithy backed him; for we thought   We might as well get something for ourselves,   Because we knew our horses couldn't win.   But Ikey wouldn't back him for a bob;   Because he said he reckoned he was stiff,   And all the books was layin' six to four.    Well, anyhow, before the start, the news   Got round that this here amateur was stiff,   And our good stuff was blued, and all the books   Was in it, and the prices lengthened out,   And every book was bustin' of his throat,   And layin' five to one the favourite.   So there was we that couldn't win ourselves,   And this here amateur that wouldn't try,   And all the books was layin' five to one.    So Smithy says to me, 'You take a hold   Of that there moke of yours, and round the turn   Come up behind Enchantress with the whip   And let her have it; that long bloke and me   Will wait ahead, and when she comes to us   We'll pass her on and belt her down the straight,   And Ikey'll flog her home, because his boss   Is judge and steward and the Lord knows what,   And so he won't be touched -- and, as for us,   We'll swear we only hit her by mistake!'   And all the books was layin' five to one.    Well, off we went, and comin' to the turn   I saw the amateur was holding back   And poking into every hole he could   To get her blocked, and so I pulled behind   And drew the whip and dropped it on the mare --   I let her have it twice, and then she shot   Ahead of me, and Smithy opened out   And let her up beside him on the rails,   And kept her there a-beltin' her like smoke   Until she struggled past him pullin' hard   And came to Ike; but Ikey drew his whip   And hit her on the nose and sent her back   And won the race himself -- for, after all,   It seems he had a fiver on the Dook   And never told us -- so our stuff was lost.   And then they had us up for ridin' foul,   And warned us off the tracks for twelve months each,   To get our livin' any way we could;   But Ikey wasn't touched, because his boss   Was judge and steward and the Lord knows what.    But Mister -- if you'll lend us half-a-crown,   I know three certain winners at the Park --   Three certain cops as no one knows but me;   And -- thank you, Mister, come an' have a beer   (I always like a beer about this time) . . .   Well, so long, Mister, till we meet again.     The Road to Gundagai      The mountain road goes up and down,   From Gundagai to Tumut Town.    And branching off there runs a track,   Across the foothills grim and black,    Across the plains and ranges grey   To Sydney city far away.         .    .    .    .    .    It came by chance one day that I   From Tumut rode to Gundagai.    And reached about the evening tide   The crossing where the roads divide;    And, waiting at the crossing place,   I saw a maiden fair of face,    With eyes of deepest violet blue,   And cheeks to match the rose in hue --    The fairest maids Australia knows   Are bred among the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/304"],["title","Rio Grande's Last Race, and Other Verses (#6)"],["body","snows.    Then, fearing I might go astray,   I asked if she could show the way.    Her voice might well a man bewitch --   Its tones so supple, deep, and rich.    'The tracks are clear,' she made reply,   'And this goes down to Sydney town,   And that one goes to Gundagai.'    Then slowly, looking coyly back,   She went along the Sydney track.    And I for one was well content   To go the road the lady went;    But round the turn a swain she met --   The kiss she gave him haunts me yet!         .    .    .    .    .    I turned and travelled with a sigh   The lonely road to Gundagai.     Saltbush Bill's Second Fight      The news came down on the Castlereagh, and went to the world at large,   That twenty thousand travelling sheep, with Saltbush Bill in charge,   Were drifting down from a dried-out run to ravage the Castlereagh;   And the squatters swore when they heard the news,     and wished they were well away:   For the name and the fame of Saltbush Bill were over the country side   For the wonderful way that he fed his sheep,     and the dodges and tricks he tried.   He would lose his way on a Main Stock Route,     and stray to the squatters' grass;   He would come to a run with the boss away, and swear he had leave to pass;   And back of all and behind it all, as well the squatters knew,   If he had to fight, he would fight all day, so long as his sheep got through:   But this is the story of Stingy Smith, the owner of Hard Times Hill,   And the way that he chanced on a fighting man to reckon with Saltbush Bill.         .    .    .    .    .    'Twas Stingy Smith on his stockyard sat, and prayed for an early Spring,   When he stared at sight of a clean-shaved tramp, who walked with jaunty swing;   For a clean-shaved tramp with a jaunty walk a-swinging along the track   Is as rare a thing as a feathered frog on the desolate roads out back.   So the tramp he made for the travellers' hut,     and asked could he camp the night;   But Stingy Smith had a bright idea, and he said to him, 'Can you fight?'   'Why, what's the game?' said the clean-shaved tramp,     as he looked at him up and down --   'If you want a battle, get off that fence, and I'll kill you for half-a-crown!   But, Boss, you'd better not fight with me, it wouldn't be fair nor right;   I'm Stiffener Joe, from the Rocks Brigade, and I killed a man in a fight:   I served two years for it, fair and square, and now I'm a trampin' back,   To look for a peaceful quiet life away on the outside track ----'   'Oh, it's not myself, but a drover chap,' said Stingy Smith with glee;   'A bullying fellow, called Saltbush Bill -- and you are the man for me.   He's on the road with his hungry sheep, and he's certain to raise a row,   For he's bullied the whole of the Castlereagh till he's got them under cow --   Just pick a quarrel and raise a fight, and leather him good and hard,   And I'll take good care that his wretched sheep don't wander a half a yard.   It's a five-pound job if you belt him well -- do anything short of kill,   For there isn't a beak on the Castlereagh will fine you for Saltbush Bill.'    'I'll take the job,' said the fighting man; 'and hot as this cove appears,   He'll stand no chance with a bloke like me,     what's lived on the game for years;   For he's maybe learnt in a boxing school, and sparred for a round or so,   But I've fought all hands in a ten-foot ring each night in a travelling show;   They earned a pound if they stayed three rounds,     and they tried for it every night --   In a ten-foot ring!  Oh, that's the game that teaches a bloke to fight,   For they'd rush and clinch, it was Dublin Rules, and we drew no colour line;   And they all tried hard for to earn the pound, but they got no pound of mine:   If I saw no chance in the opening round I'd slog at their wind, and wait   Till an opening came -- and it ALWAYS came -- and I settled 'em, sure as fate;   Left on the ribs and right on the jaw --     and, when the chance comes, MAKE SURE!   And it's there a professional bloke like me gets home on an amateur:   For it's my experience every day, and I make no doubt it's yours,   That a third-class pro is an over-match for the best of the amateurs ----'   'Oh, take your swag to the travellers' hut,'     said Smith, 'for you waste your breath;   You've a first-class chance, if you lose the fight,     of talking your man to death.   I'll tell the cook you're to have your grub, and see that you eat your fill,   And come to the scratch all fit and well to leather this Saltbush Bill.'         .    .    .    .    .    'Twas Saltbush Bill, and his travelling sheep were wending their weary way   On the Main Stock Route, through the Hard Times Run,     on their six-mile stage a day;   And he strayed a mile from the Main Stock Route, and started to feed along,   And, when Stingy Smith came up, Bill said that the Route was surveyed wrong;   And he tried to prove that the sheep had rushed     and strayed from their camp at night,   But the fighting man he kicked Bill's dog, and of course that meant a fight:   So they sparred and fought, and they shifted ground     and never a sound was heard   But the thudding fists on their brawny ribs, and the seconds' muttered word,   Till the fighting man shot home his left on the ribs with a mighty clout,   And his right flashed up with a half-arm blow -- and Saltbush Bill 'went out'.   He fell face down, and towards the blow;     and their hearts with fear were filled,   For he lay as still as a fallen tree, and they thought that he must be killed.   So Stingy Smith and the fighting man, they lifted him from the ground,   And sent to home for a brandy-flask, and they slowly fetched him round;   But his head was bad, and his jaw was hurt --     in fact, he could scarcely speak --   So they let him spell till he got his wits, and he camped on the run a week,   While the travelling sheep went here and there, wherever they liked to stray,   Till Saltbush Bill was fit once more for the track to the Castlereagh.         .    .    .    .    .    Then Stingy Smith he wrote a note, and gave to the fighting man:   'Twas writ to the boss of the neighbouring run, and thus the missive ran:   'The man with this is a fighting man, one Stiffener Joe by name;   He came near murdering Saltbush Bill, and I found it a costly game:   But it's worth your while to employ the chap,     for there isn't the slightest doubt   You'll have no trouble from Saltbush Bill while this man hangs about ----'   But an answer came by the next week's mail, with news that might well appal:   'The man you sent with a note is not a fighting man at all!   He has shaved his beard, and has cut his hair, but I spotted him at a look;   He is Tom Devine, who has worked for years for Saltbush Bill as cook.   Bill coached him up in the fighting yarn, and taught him the tale by rote,   And they shammed to fight, and they got your grass     and divided your five-pound note.   'Twas a clean take-in, and you'll find it wise --     'twill save you a lot of pelf --   When next you're hiring a fighting man, just fight him a round yourself.'         .    .    .    .    .    And the teamsters out on the Castlereagh, when they meet with a week of rain,   And the waggon sinks to its axle-tree, deep down in the black soil plain,   When the bullocks wade in a sea of mud, and strain at the load of wool,   And the cattle-dogs at the bullocks' heels are biting to make them pull,   When the off-side driver flays the team, and curses them while he flogs,   And the air is thick with the language used,     and the clamour of men and dogs --   The teamsters say, as they pause to rest and moisten each hairy throat,   They wish they could swear like Stingy Smith     when he read that neighbour's note.     Hard Luck      I left the course, and by my side    There walked a ruined tout --   A hungry creature evil-eyed,    Who poured this story out.    'You see,' he said, 'there came a swell    To Kensington to-day,   And if I picked the winners well,    A crown at least he'd pay.    'I picked three winners straight, I did,    I filled his purse with pelf,   And then he gave me half-a-quid,    To back one for myself.    'A half-a-quid to me he cast,    I wanted it indeed.   So help me Bob, for two days past    I haven't had a feed.    'But still I thought my luck was in,    I couldn't go astray,   I put it all on Little Min,    And lost it straightaway.    'I haven't got a bite or bed,    I'm absolutely stuck,   So keep this lesson in your head:    Don't over-trust your luck!'    The folks went homeward, near and far,    The tout, Oh! where was he?   Ask where the empty boilers are,    Beside the Circular Quay.     Song of the Federation      As the nations sat together, grimly waiting --    The fierce old nations battle-scarred --   Grown grey in their lusting and their hating,    Ever armed and ever ready keeping guard,   Through the tumult of their warlike preparation    And the half-stilled clamour of the drums   Came a voice crying, 'Lo! a new-made nation,    To her place in the sisterhood she comes!'    And she came -- she was beautiful as morning,    With the bloom of the roses in her mouth,   Like a young queen lavishly adorning    Her charms with the splendours of the South.   And the fierce old nations, looking on her,    Said, 'Nay, surely she were quickly overthrown,   Hath she strength for the burden laid upon her,    Hath she power to protect and guard her own?    Then she spoke, and her voice was clear and ringing    In the ears of the nations old and gray,   Saying, 'Hark, and ye shall hear my children singing    Their war-song in countries far away.   They are strangers to the tumult of the battle,    They are few but their hearts are very strong,   'Twas but yesterday they called unto the cattle,    But they now sing Australia's marching song.'
