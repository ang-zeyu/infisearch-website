We've got to get fixed for a fight; we can't handle this by ourselves.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rawson was silent. He spoke slowly at last:  \"You mean we've got to quit--quit without knowing what we're up against. Can you imagine what they'll say to me back in town? Scared out, licked by something I've never even seen!\"  \"Scared?\" Smithy inquired. \"You couldn't find a better word for it if you hunted through the whole dictionary. Scared? Why, say, I'm so damn scared I'm shaking yet, and the only thing that will cure me of it is to look at those devils along the top of a machine gun! We'll go catch us some equipment and a few service men--\"  \"You're a good guy, Smithy,\" Rawson reached out and gripped one brown hand. \"And we'll do as you say; but first I've got to get a line on things. I'm becoming as irrational as the men. I'm imagining all sort of crazy things.\"  \"You don't have to imagine them.\" Smithy's voice was strained; it showed the tension under which he was laboring. \"Men or beasts--God knows what they are!--but when they come up from nowhere--\"  \"Out of the sand,\" Rawson explained.  Smithy stared at him. \"Out of the sand,\" he repeated. \"Then, when they cut a man in two, melt steel as if it were butter, pull a few tons of metal down out of sight as easy as we would sink it in the ocean, flash their lights over in the ghost town, up on top of a volcano--\"  \"Stop!\" shouted Rawson unexpectedly. Some sudden gleam of understanding had flashed through his mind. He dragged himself to his feet and staggered to the doorway where he clung until the nausea of a whirling world had passed. \"The dust! The dust!\" he gasped.  Smithy put a hand on his shoulder. Plainly he thought Rawson out of his mind. \"Easy, old-timer,\" he cautioned. \"We'll get out of here. I hate to make you walk in the shape you're in, but the dirty cowards ran off with the trucks. They even took your car; there isn't a thing here on wheels.\"  But Rawson did not hear. He was staring off across the sand, and he was muttering bitter words.  \"Fool! Oh, you utter fool!\" he said. \"The dust--the dust.\" Then he let the roughly tender hands of Smithy guide him back to the cot where he fell into a troubled sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  The comparative coolness of dusk was tempering the feverish midday heat when Rawson awoke. And, strangely, his troubles and all his conflicting plans had been simplified by the magic of sleep. His course was entirely plain. He was going to the crater again.  \"What's there?\" Smithy demanded. \"What do you think that you'll find?\"  \"I don't know,\" was the reply.  \"Then why--what the devil's the idea?\"  \"It's my job. They put it up to me, Erickson and his crowd. I've got to go.\"  And nothing Smithy could say seemed able to reach Rawson and swerve him from his single idea.  \"You'll be safe on the road,\" Rawson told him, while he filled a canteen with water in preparation for his own trip. \"You can get to the highway by morning.\"  Smithy did not trouble to reply. Was Rawson out of his mind? He could not be sure. Certainly he had got an awful bump, but there were no bones broken. However, it might be that he was still dazed--a crack on the head might have done it.  But there was no use in further argument, he admitted to himself. Dean was going to the crater again--there was no stopping him--but he was not going alone; Smithy could see to that.         *       *       *       *       *  Again Rawson took the more difficult ascent. They went first to the ghost town: the slope above Little Rhyolite would save weary miles. But, once there, they knew that the route was not a place where they would care to be in the night. The realization came when Smithy, walking where they had been the day before, passing the sand dune where the wind had been scouring, seized Rawson's arm.  \"I thought so,\" he said softly. \"I thought I saw something there the other day, but the sand fell in and hid it. I didn't know the old-timers went in for subways in Little Rhyolite.\"  And Rawson looked as did Smithy, in wondering amazement, at the roughly round opening in the sand, a tunnel mouth, driven through the shifting sands--a tunnel, if Rawson was any judge, lined with brown glistening glass.  Understanding came quickly.  \"The jet of flame!\" he exclaimed half under his breath. \"They melted their way through; the sand turned to glass; they held it some way for an instant while it hardened.\" He walked cautiously toward the dark entrance and peered inside.  Darkness but for the nearer glinting reflections from walls that had once been molten and dripping. The tunnel dipped down at a slight angle, then straightened off horizontally. Rawson could have stood upright in it with easily another two feet of headroom to spare.  \"And that,\" said Smithy, \"is how the dirty rats got over to the camp. Like moles in their runway. No wonder they could pop up from nowhere. But, Dean, old man, I'm thinkin' we're up against something we haven't dared speak of to each other. Don't tell me that it's just men we've got to meet--\"  \"Wait,\" Rawson begged in a hushed whisper. \"Wait till we know. That's why I didn't dare go out without something definite to report. We'll go up--but not here. We'll get a line on this up top.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He led the way from the crumbling walls and skirted the mountain's base to the place where he had climbed before. And, with the help of a supporting arm at times, he found himself again in the great cleft in the rocks.  Darkness now made the passageway a place of somber shadows. The broad cupped crater lay beyond in silent waiting; the vast sand-filled pit seemed, under the starlight, to have been only that instant cooled. The twisted rocks that formed the rim had been caught in the very instant of their tortures and frozen to deep silence and eternal death: the black masses of tufa, protruding from the packed ashy sand might have been buried by the smothering mass but a moment before. It was a place of death, a place where nothing moved--until again the breeze that whirled gustily over the saw-tooth crags snatched at the sand in that lowest pit and drew it up in a spiral of dust.  The word was on Rawson's lips. \"Dust--dust in the crater. Fool! I said I could read sign; I thought I was a desert man.\"  \"Dust? And why shouldn't there be dust? How do you usually have your volcanoes arranged, old man?\"  \"Fine dust!\" Rawson interrupted in the same whisper. He was glancing sharply about him as if in fear of being overheard. \"See, the wind is blowing it. Coarse sand and pumice--that's to be expected; but light dust in a place that the winds have been sweeping for the last million years! I don't have them arranged that way, Smithy--not unless the sand has been recently disturbed!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He moved soundlessly across the sand. There was no chance for concealment; the surface was too smooth for that. Yet he wished, as he moved onward down the long, gentle slope, that he had been able to keep under cover. In all the wide bowl of the great crater top was nothing but dead ashes of fires gone long centuries before, coarse, igneous rock--nothing to set the little nerves of one's spine to tingling. Rawson tried to tell himself he was alone. Even the gun in his hand seemed an absurd precaution. Yet he knew, with a certainty that went beyond mere seeing, that invisible eyes were upon him.  The blocks were massive when he drew near to them. They were buried in the sand, their sides like mirrors, their edges true and straight. \"Crystals,\" Rawson tried to tell himself, but he knew they were not.  Gun in hand, he moved among the great rocks. Open sand lay beyond, running off at a steeper pitch to make a throat--a smaller pit in the great pit of the crater itself. Rawson noted it, then forgot it as he stooped for something that lay half hidden, its protruding end shining under the light of the stars, as he had seen it gleam before at the derrick's base.  He snatched up the metal tube, noting the lava tip, and that it was like the one Smithy had found in the ghost town. The tube, clearly, was part of some other mechanism, and Rawson realized with startling suddenness that he was holding in his hand the jet of a flame-thrower--the same one, perhaps, that had almost sent him to his death.  The thought, while he was still thinking it, was blotted from his mind. He was thrown suddenly to the sandy earth; the sand was slipping swiftly from beneath his feet; he was scrambling on all fours, clawing wildly for some anchorage that would keep him from being swept away.         *       *       *       *       *  He touched a corner of shining stone, drew himself to it, reached its slanting side, then scrambled frenziedly to the top and threw himself about to face the place of slipping sands. But where the sand had been, his wildly glaring eyes found only a black hole--a vertical bore, like the ancient throat of the volcano; and this, like the tunnel in the sand, was lined with smooth and glistening glass.  It was black at first, a yawning, ominous maw, till the polished sides caught a reflection from below and blazed red with the glare of hidden fires.  No time was needed for Dean's quick searching eyes to grasp the meaning of the change. Whatever had menaced the camp had set this trap. He swung sharply to leap from the block, but stopped at the sight of Smith's chunky figure coming slowly across the sand.  \"Back!\" he shouted. His voice was almost a scream, shrill and crackling with excitement. \"Get back, Smithy! I'm coming!\"         *       *       *       *       *  He would have leaped. Below the block the sand bulged upward as a yellow animal-thing came clawing up into the night. Dimly he saw it--saw this one and the others that must have been hidden in the sand. They were between him and Smithy!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29965"],["title","Two Thousand Miles Below (#8)"],["body"," A blaze of red came from behind him--there must be others there! He snatched his gun from its holster as he turned.  Flames were hissing into the darkness, five or six of them in lines of hot crimson fire. They changed to green as he watched, and the livid light spread out in ghastly illumination over the creatures that directed them.  He saw them now--saw them in one age-long instant while he stood in horror on the black shining rock. He saw their heads, red-skinned, pointed, their staring eyes as large as saucers--owl-eyes. They were naked, and their bodies, that would have been almost crimson in the light of day, were blotched and ghastly in the green light. And each one held in long clawlike hands a thing of shining metal--a lava tip like the one he had found projected and ended in the hissing line of green.  A flame slashed downward. For one sickening second he waited to feel the heat of it, though it was many feet away; in his mind he cringed involuntarily from the ripping knife-cut of the fiery blade that would blast the life from him; then he knew that the flame had passed--it was tearing at the rock beneath his feet. And the cold stone turned to liquid fire at that touch.  It leaped in a splashing fountain to the sand. The blaze turned the whole pit to flame. On even the farthest rugged crag of the crater's rim the red light glowed. Before Rawson could raise his own weapon the blast had torn the rock from beneath his feet. The great mass tipped, rolled. Rawson's arms were flung wide in an effort to save himself. Then below him was the black throat with its walls of glass: he was plunging headlong into it, turning as he fell--and somewhere, far down in that throat, was the red glow of waiting fires. He saw it again and again as he fell....     CHAPTER VII  _The Ring_  [Illustration: _One of them pointed at the shaft Rawson had drilled._]  [Sidenote: Town after town is fired by the emerging Red Ones as Rawson lies helpless, a prisoner, far down in their home within the earth.]   \"Smithy,\" Rawson had called him when he found the youngster fighting gamely with death in the heat of Tonah Basin. And Gordon Smith was the name on the company records. Yet he remained always \"Smithy\" to Rawson, and the name, which Rawson never ceased to believe was assumed, became a mark of the affection which can spring up between man and man.  And now Smithy stood like a rigid carven statue in the midst of a barren sandy waste in the vast cup of a towering volcano top--sand that was in reality coarse pumice and ash. This was a place of death, a place where raging fires had left nothing for plant or animal life. And, over all, the desert stars shone down coldly and added to the desolation with their own pale light.  Smithy had seen Rawson pull himself to the top of the great square-edged rock. Sensing that danger of some sort was threatening, he had started to run to the aid of the struggling man. Then came Rawson's cry.  \"Back!\" he shouted. \"Get back, Smithy! I'm coming--\"  But he did not come; and Smithy, halted by the command, was frozen to sudden, panic-stricken immobility by that which followed.  He saw the leaping things, like grotesque yellow giants. They came from the sand; then red ones leaped up from the open throat that had suddenly formed. They held flame throwers, the red ones; and the green lines of fire melted the rock from beneath Rawson's feet. All in the one second's time, it was done, and Rawson's body, his arms wide flung, was hurtling downward into the waiting throat and the threatening red glow from within. Then the carriers of the flame throwers vanished again into the pit, and there was left only a huddle of giant figures that tore at the loose sand and ash with their hands.  They threw the material in a continuous stream; the air was full of cascading sand. To Smithy they were suddenly inhuman--they were almost animals; men like moles. And they and their companions had captured Dean Rawson--sent him to his death. Slowly the watching man raised himself from the crouched position that had kept him hidden.  They were through with their work, these great yellow-skinned naked men--or mole-men. Six of them--Smithy counted them slowly before he took aim--and two were armed with flame-throwers.  Smithy rested his arm across the little hummock of gritty ash that had sheltered him and sent six flashes of flame through the night toward the cluster of bodies.         *       *       *       *       *  He made no attempt to aim at each individual--the shapes were too shadowy for that. And he had no knowledge of what other weapons they might have. One thing was sure: he must take no chances on facing the red ones single-handed. He rammed his empty pistol back into its holster as he turned and ran--ran with every ounce of energy he possessed to drive his flying feet across the crater floor, out through the cleft in the rocks and down the steep mountainside.  He was stunned by the suddenness of the catastrophe that had overtaken them. The horror of Dean Rawson's going; the fearful reality of those \"devils from hell\" that old Riley had seen--it was all too staggering, too numbing, for easy acceptance. Time was required for the truth to sink in; and through the balance of the night Smithy had plenty of time to think.  He dared not go back to the camp where ripping flashes of green light told him the enemy was at work. And then, even had it been possible to creep up on them in the darkness, that one chance vanished as the desert about the camp sprang into view. One after another the buildings burst into flame, and Smithy was thankful for the concealment of the vast, empty desert.         *       *       *       *       *  The embers were still glowing when he dared go near. This enemy, it seemed, worked only at night, and Smithy waited only for the sun to show above distant purple ranges. It had been their enemy once, that fiercely hot sun; they had fought against the heat--but never had the sun wrought such destruction as this.  Smithy looked from haggard, hopeless eyes upon the wreckage of Rawson's camp. For the men who had worked there, this had meant only a job; to Smithy it had been a fight against the desert which had defeated him once. But to Rawson it meant the fruit of years of effort, the goal of his dreams brought almost within his reach.  Smithy looked at the smoldering heaps of gray where an idle wind puffed playfully at fluffy ash or fanned a bed of coals to flame. Twisted steel of the wrecked derrick was still further distorted; the enemy had ripped it to pieces with his stabbing flames. Even the unused materials, the steel and cement that had been neatly stacked for future use--the flames had been turned on it all.  And Smithy, though his voice broke almost boyishly from his repressed emotion, spoke aloud in solemn promise:  \"It's too late to help you, Dean. I'll go back to town, report to the men who were back of you, and then.... They're going to pay, Dean! Whoever--whatever--they are, they're going to pay!\"  He turned away toward the mountains and the ribbon of road that wound off toward the canyon. Then, at some recollection, he swung back.  \"The cable's still down--he would have wanted it left all shipshape,\" he whispered.  Where the derrick had stood was the mouth of the twenty-inch casing. The cable that ran from it was entangled with the wreckage of the derrick, but it had not been cut. Smithy set doggedly to work.         *       *       *       *       *  A little gin-pole and light tackle allowed him to erect a heavier tripod of steel beams; it hoisted the big sheave block into place, and gave Smithy's two hands the strength of twenty to rig a temporary hoist. The juice was still on the main feed line, and the hoisting motors hummed at his touch. The ten miles of cable wound slowly onto the drums.  \"It's nonsense, I suppose,\" he told himself silently. But something drove him to do this last thing--to leave it all as Rawson would have had it.  The long bailer came out at last; there was just room to hoist it clear and let it drop back upon the drilling floor. A glint of gold flashed in the sunlight as Smithy let the long metal tube down, and he broke into voluble cursing at sight of the bit of metal that was caught near the bailer's top.  The gold had started it all! That first finding of the gold on the big drill had begun it.... He crossed swiftly to the gleaming thing that seemed somehow to symbolize his loss.  He stooped to reach for it, intending to throw it as far as he could. Instead he stood in an awkward stooping attitude--stood so while the long uncounted minutes passed....  His eyes that stared and stared in disbelief seemed suddenly to have turned traitor. They were telling him that they saw a ring--a cameo--jammed solidly into the shackle at the bailer's end. And that ring, when last he had seen it, had been on Dean Rawson's hand! Dean had caught it; he had hooked it over a lever in this very place--and now, from ten miles down inside the solid earth, it had returned. It meant--it meant....  But the stocky, broad-shouldered youngster known as Smithy dared not think what it meant. Nor had he time to follow the thought; he was too busily engaged in running at suicidal speed across the hot sand toward barren mountains where a ribbon of road showed through quivering air.     CHAPTER VIII  _The Darkness_   Darkness; and red fires that seemed whirling about him as his body twisted in air. To Dean Rawson, plunging down into the volcano's maw, each second was an eternity, for, in each single instant, he was expecting crashing death.  Then he knew that long arms were wrapped about him, holding him, supporting him, checking his downward plunge ... and at last the glassy walls, where each bulbous irregularity shone red with reflected light, moved slowly past. And, after more eons of time, a rocky floor rose slowly to meet him.  His body crashed gently; he was sprawled face downward on stone "]]]
