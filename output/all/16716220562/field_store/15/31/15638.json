And why should fears for future years   Mix jolly ale with thoughts of tears     When in the horn 'tis poured?   And why should ghost of sorrow fright   The bold heart of an English wight     When beef is on the board?    De Thorold's guests are wiser than     The men of mopish lore;   For round they push the smiling can,     And slice the plattered store.    And round they thrust the ponderous cheese,     And the loaves of wheat and rye:   None stinteth him for lack of ease--   For each a stintless welcome sees,     In the Baron's blythesome eye.    The Baron joineth the joyous feast--     But not in pomp or pride;   He smileth on the humblest guest   So gladsomely--all feel that rest     Of heart which doth abide   Where deeds of generousness attest   The welcome by the tongue professed,     Is not within belied.    And the Baron's beauteous child is there,     In her maiden peerlessness,--   Her eyes diffusing heart-light rare,   And smiles so sweetly debonair,     That all her presence bless.--    But wherefore paleth, soon, her cheek?   And why, with trembling, doth she seek     To shun her father's gaze?   And who is he for whom the crowd   Make ready room, and \"Welcome\" loud     With gleeful voices raise?    \"Right welcome!\" though the revellers shout,     They hail the minstrel \"Stranger!\"   And in the Baron's eye dwells doubt,     And his daughter's look thrills \"danger!\"    Though he seemeth meek the youth is bold,     And his speech is firm and free;   He saith he will carol a legend old,   Of a Norman lord of Torksey told:     He learnt it o'er the sea;   And he will not sing for the Baron's gold,     But for love of minstrelsy.    \"Come, tune thy harp!\" the Baron saith,     \"And tell thy minstrel tale:   It is too late to harbour wrath     For the thieves in helm and mail:    \"Our fathers' home again is ours!--     Though Thorold is Saxon still,   To a song of thy foreign troubadours     He can list with right good will!\"    A shout of glee rings to the roof,     And the revellers form a ring;   Then silent wait to mark what proof     Of skill with voice and string   The youthful stranger will afford.    Full soon he tunes each quivering chord,   And, with preamble wildly sweet   He doth the wondering listeners greet;--   Then strikes into a changeful chaunt   That fits his fanciful romaunt.     The Daughter of Plantagenet.  THE STRANGER MINSTREL'S TALE.   FYTTE THE FYRSTE.      'Tis midnight, and the broad full moon     Pours on the earth her silver noon;     Sheeted in white, like spectres of fear,     Their ghostly forms the towers uprear;   And their long dark shadows behind them are cast,   Like the frown of the cloud when the lightning hath past.      The warder sleeps on the battlement,     And there is not a breeze to curl the Trent;     The leaf is at rest, and the owl is mute--     But list! awaked is the woodland lute:   The nightingale warbles her omen sweet   On the hour when the ladye her lover shall meet.      She waves her hand from the loophole high,     And watcheth, with many a struggling sigh,     And hearkeneth in doubt, and paleth with fear,--     Yet tremblingly trusts her true knight is near;--   And there skims o'er the river--or doth her heart doat?--   As with wing of the night-hawk--her lover's brave boat.      His noble form hath attained the strand,     And she waves again her small white hand;     And breathing to heaven, in haste, a prayer,     Softly glides down the lonely stair;   And there stands by the portal, all watchful and still,   Her own faithful damsel awaiting her will.      The midnight lamp gleams dull and pale,--     The maidens twain are weak and frail,--     But Love doth aid his votaries true,     While they the massive bolts undo,--   And a moment hath flown, and the warrior knight   Embraceth his love in the meek moonlight.    The knight his love-prayer, tenderly,     Thus breathed in his fair one's ear   \"Oh! wilt thou not, my Agnes, flee?--     And, quelling thy maiden fear,   Away in the fleeting skiff with me,     And, for aye, this lone heart cheer?\"    \"O let not bold Romara[7] seek\"--     Soft answered his ladye-love,--   \"A father's doating heart to break,   For should I disdainful prove   Of his high behests, his darling child   Will thenceforth be counted a thing defiled;   And the kindling eye of my martial sire   Be robbed of its pride, and be quenched its fire:   Nor long would true Romara deem   The heart of his Agnes beat for him,   And for him alone--if that heart, he knew,   To its holiest law could be thus untrue.\"    His plume-crowned helm the warrior bows     Low o'er her shoulder fair,   And bursting sighs the grief disclose     His lips can not declare;   And swiftly glide the tears of love     Adown the ladye's cheek;--   Their deep commingling sorrows prove     The love they cannot speak!      The moon shines on them, as on things       She loves to robe with gladness,--     But all her light no radiance brings       Unto their hearts' dark sadness:     Forlornly, 'neath her cheerless ray,--       Bosom to bosom beating,--     In speechless agony they stay,       With burning kisses greeting;--   Nor reck they with what speed doth haste   The present hour to join the past.      \"Ho! lady Agnes, lady dear!\"       Her fearful damsel cries;     \"You reckon not, I deeply fear,       How swift the moontide flies!     The surly warder will awake,       The morning dawn, anon,--     My heart beginneth sore to quake,--       I fear we are undone!\"    But Love is mightier than Fear:     The ladye hasteth not:   The magnet of her heart is near,     And peril is forgot!    She clingeth to her knight's brave breast     Like a lorn turtle-dove,   And 'mid the peril feeleth rest,--     The full, rapt rest of Love!    \"I charge thee, hie thee hence, sir knight!\"     The damsel shrilly cries;   \"If this should meet her father's sight,     By Heaven! my lady dies.\"    The warrior rouseth all his pride,     And looseth his love's caress,--   Yet slowness of heart doth his strength betide     As he looks on her loveliness:--   But again the damsel their love-dream breaks,--     And, self-reproachingly,   The knight his resolve of its fetters shakes,     And his spirit now standeth free.      Then, came the last, absorbing kiss,       True Love can ne'er forego,--     That dreamy plenitude of bliss       Or antepast of woe,--   That seeming child of Heaven, which at its birth   Briefly expires, and proves itself of earth.    The ladye hieth to her couch;--     And when the morn appears,   The changes of her cheek avouch,     Full virginly her fears;--   But her doating father can nought discern     In the hues of the rose and the lily that chase     Each other across her lovely face,--   Save a sweetness that softens his visage stern.   FYTTE THE SECONDE.    Romara's skiff is on the Trent,     And the stream is in its strength,--   For a surge, from its ocean-fountain sent,     Pervades its giant length:[8]   Roars the hoarse heygre[9] in its course,   Lashing the banks with its wrathful force;   And dolefully echoes the wild-fowl's scream,   As the sallows are swept by the whelming stream;   And her callow young are hurled for a meal,   To the gorge of the barbel, the pike, and the eel:   The porpoise[10] heaves 'mid the rolling tide,   And, snorting in mirth, doth merrily ride,--   For he hath forsaken his bed in the sea,   To sup on the salmon, right daintily!    In Romara's breast a tempest raves:   He heeds not the rage of the furrowy waves:   Supremely his hopes and fears are set   On the image of Agnes Plantagenet:[11]   And though from his vision fade Gainsburgh's towers,   And the moon is beclouded, and darkness lours,   Yet the eye of his passion oft pierceth the gloom,   And beholds his Beloved in her virgin bloom--     Kneeling before the holy Rood,--       All clasped her hands,--     Beseeching the saints and angels good       That their watchful bands   Her knight may preserve from a watery tomb!    What deathful scream rends Romara's heart?--     Is it the bittern that, flapping the air,   Doth shriek in madness, and downward dart,     As if from the bosom of Death she would tear   Her perished brood,--or a shroud would have   By their side, in the depths of their river-grave?    Hark! hark! again!--'tis a human cry,   Like the shriek of a man about to die!   And its desolateness doth fearfully pierce   The billowy boom of the torrent fierce;       And, swift as a thought       Glides the warrior's boat   Through the foaming surge to the river's bank,   Where, lo!--by a branch of the osiers dank,       Clingeth one in agony       Uttering that doleful cry!    His silvery head of age upborne     Appeared above the wave;   So nearly was his strength outworn,     That all too late to save   Had been the knight, if another billow     Its force on his fainting frame, had bent,--   Nay, his feeble grasp by the drooping willow     The beat of a pulse might have fatally spent.    With eager pounce did Romara take     From the yawning wave its prey,--   But nought to his deliverer spake     The man with the head of gray:   And the warrior stripped, with needful haste,   The helpless one of his drenchÃ«d vest,   And wrapt his own warm mantle round   The chill one in his deathly swound.    The sea-born strength of the stream is spent,     And Romara's boat outstrips its speed,--   For his stalwart arm to the oar is bent,     And swiftly the ebbing waves recede.    Divinely streaketh the morning-star     With a wavy light the rippling waters;   And the moon looks on from the west, afar,     And palely smiles, with her waning daughters,   The thin-strown stars, which their vigil keep   Till the orient sun shall awake from sleep.    The sun hath awoke; and in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29722"],["title","The Baron's Yule Feast: A Christmas Rhyme (#2)"],["body","of gold   The turrets of Torksey are livingly rolled;   Afar, on Trent's margin, the flowery lea   Exhales her dewy fragrancy;   And gaily carols the matin lark,   As the warrior hastes to moor his bark.    Two menials hastened to the beach,     For signal none need they;   On the towers they kept a heedful watch     As the skiff glode on its way:    With silent step and breathless care   The rescued one they softly bear,   And bring him, at their lord's behest,   To a couch of silken pillowed rest.    The serfs could scarce avert their eye     From his manly form and mien,   As, with closÃ«d lids, all reverendly,     He lay in peace, serene.    And Romara thought, as he gazing leant     O'er the slumberer's form, that so pure a trace   Of the spirit of Heaven with the earthly blent     Dwelt only there, and in Agnes' face.    The leech comes forth at the hour of noon,   And saith, that the sick from his deathly swoon   Will awake anon; and Romara's eye,   Uplit, betokens his heartfelt joy;   And again o'er the slumberer's couch he bows   Till, slowly, those peaceful lids unclose,--   When, long, with heavenward-fixÃ«d gaze,   With lowly prayer and grateful praise,   The aged man, from death reprieved,   His bosom of its joy relieved.--    Then did Romara thus address   His gray guest, in his reverendness:    \"Now, man of prayer come tell to me   Some spell of thy holy mystery!   Some vision hast had of the Virgin bright,--   Or message, conveyed from the world of light,   By the angels of love who in purity stand   'Fore the throne of our Lord in the heavenly land?    \"I hope, when I die, to see them there:   For I love the angels so holy and fair:   And often, I trust, my prayer they greet   With smiles, when I kneel and kiss their feet   In the missal, my mother her weeping child gave,   But a day or two ere she was laid in the grave.    \"Sage man of prayer, come tell to me   What holy shapes in sleep they see   Who love the blest saints and serve them well!   I pray thee, sage man, to Romara tell,   For a guerdon, thy dreams,--sith, to me thou hast said   No thanks that I rescued thy soul from the dead.\"    But, when the aged man arose     And met Romara's wistful eye,--   What accents shall the change disclose     That marked his visage, fearfully?--   From joy to grief and deepest dole,     From radiant hope to dark presage   Of future ills beyond control--     Hath passed, the visage of the sage.    \"Son of an honoured line, I grieve,\"     Outspake the reverend seer,   \"That I no guerdon thee can give     But words of woe and fear!--   Thy sun is setting!--and thy race,     In thee, their goodly heir,   Shall perish, nor a feeble trace     Their fated name declare!--   Thy love is fatal: fatal, too,     This act of rescue brave--   For, him who from destruction drew     My life, no arm can save!\"    He said,--and took his lonely way     Far from Romara's towers.--   His fateful end from that sad day     O'er Torksey's chieftain lowers:--   Yet, vainly, in his heart a shrine     Hope builds for love,--with faith;--   Alas! for him with frown malign     Waiteth the grim king Death!   FYTTE THE THYRDE.    Plantagenet hath dungeons deep     Beneath his castled halls;--   Plantagenet awakes from sleep     To count his dungeoned thralls.    Alone, with the torch of blood-red flame,     The man of blood descends;   And the fettered captives curse his name,     As through the vaults he wends.--    His caverns are visited, all, save one,     The deepest, and direst in gloom,--   Where his father, doomed by a demon son,     Abode in a living tomb.--    \"I bring thee bread and water, sire!     Brave usury for thy gold!   I fear my filial zeal will tire     To visit, soon, thy hold!\"    Thus spake the fiendish-hearted lord,     And wildly laughed, in scorn:   Like thunder round the cell each word     By echoing fiends is borne,--   But not a human heart is there   The baron's scorn or hate to fear!    And the captives tell, as he passeth again,--     That tyrant, in his rage,--   How an angel hath led the aged man     To his heavenly heritage!    The wrathful baron little recked     That angel was his darling child;   Or knew his dark ambition checked     By her who oft his rage beguiled,--     By her on whom he ever smiled:--   This had he known, from that dread hour,   His darling's smile had lost its power,--   And his own hand, without remorse,   Had laid her at his feet a corse!--    Plantagenet's banners in pride are borne     To the sound of pipe and drum!   And his mailÃ«d bands, with the dawn of morn,     To Romara's walls are come.   \"We come not as foes,\" the herald saith,--   \"But we bring Plantagenet's shriven faith   That thou, Romara, in thine arms   Shall soon enfold thy true love's charms:   Let no delay thy joy betide!--   Thy Agnes soon shall be thy bride!\"    The raven croaks as Torksey's lord     Attends that bannered host;   But the lover is deaf to the omen-bird--     The fatal moat is crossed!    \"Ride, ride;\" saith the baron,--\"thy ladye fain     And the priest--by the altar wait!\"--   And the spearmen seize his bridle-rein,     And hurry him to his fate.    \"A marriage by torchlight!\" the baron said;     \"This stair to the altar leads!   We patter our prayers, 'mong the mouldering dead,--     And there we tell our beads!\"    Along the caverned dungeon's gloom     The tyrant strides in haste;   And, powerless, to his dreadful doom     The victim followeth fast.   The dazÃ«d captives quake and stare   At the sullen torch's blood-red glare,     And the lover starts aghast   At the deathlike forms they wear!    Too late, the truth upon him breaks!--     Romara's heart is faint!--   \"Behold thy bride!\" the baron shrieks--     \"Wilt hear the wedding chaunt?   This chain once bound my father here,     Who would have found his grave--     The cursed dotard!--'neath the wave,--   Had not thy hateful hand been near.--   Be this the bride thou now shalt wed!   This dungeon dank thy bridal bed!--   And when thy youthful blood shall freeze   In death,--may fiends thy spirit seize!\"--    Plantagenet hath minions fell   Who do their master's bidding well:--   Few days Romara pines in dread:--   His soul is with the sainted dead!--    Plantagenet hath reached his bourne!   What terrors meet his soul forlorn   And full of stain,--I may not say:--   Reveal them shall the Judgment Day!--    Her orisons at matin hour,     At noon, and eve, and midnight toll,   For him, doth tearful Agnes pour!--     Jesu Maria! sain his soul!       THE   BARON'S YULE FEAST.    A   Christmas Rhyme.  CANTO II.     Symphonious notes of dulcet plaint   Followed the stranger minstrel's chaunt;   And, when his sounding harp was dumb,   The crowd, with loud applausive hum,   Gave hearty guerdon for his strain;   While some with sighs expressed what pain   Had pierced their simple bosoms thorow   To hear his song of death and sorrow.    \"Come bear the mead-cup to our guest,\"     Said Thorold to his daughter;   \"We thought to hear, at our Yule feast,     A lay of mirth and laughter;   But, to thy harp, thou well hast sung     A song that may impart,   For future hours, to old and young,     Deep lessons to the heart.   Yet, should not life be all a sigh!   Good Snell, do thou a burthen try   Shall change our sadness into joy:   Such as thou trollest in blythe mood,   On days of sunshine in the wood.   Tell out thy heart withouten fear--   For none shall stifle free thoughts here!   But, bear the mead-cup, Edith sweet!   We crave our stranger guest will greet   All hearts, again, with minstrelsy,   When Snell hath trolled his mirth-notes free!\"    Fairer than fairest flower that blows,--   Sweeter than breath of sweetest rose,--   Still on her cheek, in lustre left,   The tear the minstrel's tale had reft   From its pearl-treasure in the brain--   The limbec where, by mystic vein,   From the heart's fountains are distilled   Those crystals, when 'tis overfilled,--   With downcast eye, and trembling hands,   Edith before the stranger stands--     Stranger to all but her!   Though well the baron notes his brow,   While the young minstrel kneeleth low--     Love's grateful worshipper!--   And doth with lips devout impress   The hand of his fair ministress!    Yet, was the deed so meekly done,--   His guerdon seemed so fairly won,--   The tribute he to beauty paid     So deeply all believed deserved,--   That nought of blame Sir Wilfrid said,     Though much his thoughts from meekness swerved.    Impatience, soon, their faces tell   To hear the song of woodman Snell,     Among the festive crew;   And, soon, their old and honest frere,   Elated by the good Yule cheer,   In untaught notes, but full and clear,     Thus told his heart-thoughts true:--   The Woodman's Song.    I would not be a crownÃ«d king,     For all his gaudy gear;   I would not be that pampered thing,     His gew-gaw gold to wear:   But I would be where I can sing     Right merrily, all the year;         Where forest treen,         All gay and green,     Full blythely do me cheer.    I would not be a gentleman,     For all his hawks and hounds,--   For fear the hungry poor should ban     My halls and wide-parked grounds:   But I would be a merry man,     Among the wild wood sounds,--         Where free birds sing,         And echoes ring     While my axe from the oak rebounds.    I would not be a shaven priest,     For all his sloth-won tythe:   But while to me this breath is leased,     And these old limbs are lithe,--   Ere Death hath marked me for his feast,     And felled me with his scythe,--         I'll troll my song,         The leaves among,     All in the forest blythe.      *       *       *       *       *    \"Well done, well done!\" bold Thorold cried,     When the woodman ceased to sing;   \"By'r Lady! it warms the Saxon tide     In our veins to hear thee bring   These English thoughts so freely out!   Thy health, good Snell!\"--and a merry shout   For honest"]]]
