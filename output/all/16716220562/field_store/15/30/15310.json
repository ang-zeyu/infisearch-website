And on this occasion she is resolute: she says the thing must and shall be done: and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos!\" With these words he left them, and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside.  \"I told you how it would end!\" moaned the elder traveller, wringing his hands, and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition, and had never predicted anything of the sort. \"Oh that we were well out of this miserable business!\"  \"Courage!\" cried the younger cheerily. \"_Hшие olim meminisse juvabit!_ The end of all this will be glory!\"  \"Glory without the L!\" was all the poor old man could say, as he rocked himself to and fro on the malachite bench. \"Glory without the L!\"  FOOTNOTE:  [Footnote A: \"_Maskee_,\" in Pigeon-English, means \"_without_.\"]     KNOT VII.  PETTY CASH.     \"Base is the slave that pays.\"   \"Aunt Mattie!\"  \"My child?\"  \"_Would_ you mind writing it down at once? I shall be quite _certain_ to forget it if you don't!\"  \"My dear, we really must wait till the cab stops. How can I possibly write anything in the midst of all this jolting?\"  \"But _really_ I shall be forgetting it!\"  Clara's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist, and with a sigh the old lady drew forth her ivory tablets and prepared to record the amount that Clara had just spent at the confectioner's shop. Her expenditure was always made out of her aunt's purse, but the poor girl knew, by bitter experience, that sooner or later \"Mad Mathesis\" would expect an exact account of every penny that had gone, and she waited, with ill-concealed impatience, while the old lady turned the tablets over and over, till she had found the one headed \"PETTY CASH.\"  \"Here's the place,\" she said at last, \"and here we have yesterday's luncheon duly entered. _One glass lemonade_ (Why can't you drink water, like me?) _three sandwiches_ (They never put in half mustard enough. I told the young woman so, to her face; and she tossed her head--like her impudence!) _and seven biscuits_. _Total one-and-two-pence._ Well, now for to-day's?\"  \"One glass of lemonade----\" Clara was beginning to say, when suddenly the cab drew up, and a courteous railway-porter was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence.  Her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly. \"Business first,\" she said: \"petty cash--which is a form of pleasure, whatever _you_ may think--afterwards.\" And she proceeded to pay the driver, and to give voluminous orders about the luggage, quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account.  \"My dear, you really must cultivate a more capacious mind!\" was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl. \"Are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon?\"  \"Not wide enough! Not half wide enough!\" was the passionate reply.  The words came in aptly enough, but the voice was not that of Clara, and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation. A fat little old lady was standing at the door of a cab, helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself: it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter, or which looked the more good-humoured of the two sisters.  \"I tell you the cab-door isn't half wide enough!\" she repeated, as her sister finally emerged, somewhat after the fashion of a pellet from a pop-gun, and she turned to appeal to Clara. \"Is it, dear?\" she said, trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles.  \"Some folks is too wide for 'em,\" growled the cab-driver.  [Illustration: \"I TELL YOU THE CAB-DOOR ISN'T HALF WIDE ENOUGH!\"]  \"Don't provoke me, man!\" cried the little old lady, in what she meant for a tempest of fury. \"Say another word and I'll put you into the County Court, and sue you for a _Habeas Corpus_!\" The cabman touched his hat, and marched off, grinning.  \"Nothing like a little Law to cow the ruffians, my dear!\" she remarked confidentially to Clara. \"You saw how he quailed when I mentioned the _Habeas Corpus_? Not that I've any idea what it means, but it sounds very grand, doesn't it?\"  \"It's very provoking,\" Clara replied, a little vaguely.  \"Very!\" the little old lady eagerly repeated. \"And we're very much provoked indeed. Aren't we, sister?\"  \"I never was so provoked in all my life!\" the fatter sister assented, radiantly.  By this time Clara had recognised her picture-gallery acquaintances, and, drawing her aunt aside, she hastily whispered her reminiscences. \"I met them first in the Royal Academy--and they were very kind to me--and they were lunching at the next table to us, just now, you know--and they tried to help me to find the picture I wanted--and I'm sure they're dear old things!\"  \"Friends of yours, are they?\" said Mad Mathesis. \"Well, I like their looks. You can be civil to them, while I get the tickets. But do try and arrange your ideas a little more chronologically!\"  And so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train, and chatting as if they had known one another for years.  \"Now this I call quite a remarkable coincidence!\" exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sisters--the one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cab-driver. \"Not only that we should be waiting for the same train, and at the same station--_that_ would be curious enough--but actually on the same day, and the same hour of the day! That's what strikes _me_ so forcibly!\" She glanced at the fatter and more silent sister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion, and who meekly responded--  \"And me too, sister!\"  \"Those are not _independent_ coincidences----\" Mad Mathesis was just beginning, when Clara ventured to interpose.  \"There's no jolting here,\" she pleaded meekly. \"_Would_ you mind writing it down now?\"  Out came the ivory tablets once more. \"What was it, then?\" said her aunt.  \"One glass of lemonade, one sandwich, one biscuit--Oh dear me!\" cried poor Clara, the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony.  \"Toothache?\" said her aunt calmly, as she wrote down the items. The two sisters instantly opened their reticules and produced two different remedies for neuralgia, each marked \"unequalled.\"  \"It isn't that!\" said poor Clara. \"Thank you very much. It's only that I _can't_ remember how much I paid!\"  \"Well, try and make it out, then,\" said her aunt. \"You've got yesterday's luncheon to help you, you know. And here's the luncheon we had the day before--the first day we went to that shop--_one glass lemonade_, _four sandwiches_, _ten biscuits_. _Total, one-and-fivepence._\" She handed the tablets to Clara, who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down.  The two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest, and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on Clara's arm.  \"Do you know, my dear,\" she said coaxingly, \"my sister and I are in the very same predicament! Quite identically the very same predicament! Aren't we, sister?\"  \"Quite identically and absolutely the very----\" began the fatter sister, but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale, and the little one would not wait for her to finish it.  \"Yes, my dear,\" she resumed; \"we were lunching at the very same shop as you were--and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuits--and neither of us has the least idea what we paid. Have we, sister?\"  \"Quite identically and absolutely----\" murmured the other, who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears, and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh liabilities; but the little lady broke in again, and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt.  \"_Would_ you make it out for us, my dear?\" pleaded the little old lady.  \"You can do Arithmetic, I trust?\" her aunt said, a little anxiously, as Clara turned from one tablet to another, vainly trying to collect her thoughts. Her mind was a blank, and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face.  A gloomy silence ensued.     KNOT VIII.  DE OMNIBUS REBUS.     \"This little pig went to market:    This little pig staid at home.\"   \"By Her Radiancy's express command,\" said the Governor, as he conducted the travellers, for the last time, from the Imperial presence, \"I shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the Military Quarter, where the agony of parting--if indeed Nature can survive the shock--must be endured! From that gate grurmstipths start every quarter of an hour, both ways----\"  \"Would you mind repeating that word?\" said Norman. \"Grurm----?\"  \"Grurmstipths,\" the Governor repeated. \"You call them omnibuses in England. They run both ways, and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour.\"  The old man breathed a sigh of relief; four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him, and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos.  In another minute they were crossing a large quadrangle, paved with marble, and tastefully decorated with a pigsty in each corner. Soldiers, carrying pigs, were marching in all directions: and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder, which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs.  \"It is the Commander-in-Chief!\" the Governor hurriedly whispered to his companions, who at once followed his example in prostrating themselves before the great man. The Commander gravely bowed in return. He was covered with gold lace from head to foot: his face "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29042"],["title","A Tangled Tale (#5)"],["body","an expression of deep misery: and he had a little black pig under each arm. Still the gallant fellow did his best, in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men, to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests.  \"Farewell, oh old one--carry these three to the South corner--and farewell to thee, thou young one--put this fat one on the top of the others in the Western sty--may your shadows never be less--woe is me, it is wrongly done! Empty out all the sties, and begin again!\" And the soldier leant upon his sword, and wiped away a tear.  \"He is in distress,\" the Governor explained as they left the court. \"Her Radiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four sties, so that, as she goes round the court, she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last.\"  \"Does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is?\" said Norman.  \"Surely,\" said the Governor. \"Her Radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine is--and also nearer than eleven is.\"  \"Then I think it can be done,\" said Norman.  The Governor shook his head. \"The Commander has been transferring them in vain for four months,\" he said. \"What hope remains? And Her Radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional----\"  \"The pigs don't seem to enjoy being transferred,\" the old man hastily interrupted. He did not like the subject of bamboos.  \"They are only _provisionally_ transferred, you know,\" said the Governor. \"In most cases they are immediately carried back again: so they need not mind it. And all is done with the greatest care, under the personal superintendence of the Commander-in-Chief.\"  \"Of course she would only go _once_ round?\" said Norman.  \"Alas, no!\" sighed their conductor. \"Round and round. Round and round. These are Her Radiancy's own words. But oh, agony! Here is the outer gate, and we must part!\" He sobbed as he shook hands with them, and the next moment was briskly walking away.  \"He _might_ have waited to see us off!\" said the old man, piteously.  \"And he needn't have begun whistling the very _moment_ he left us!\" said the young one, severely. \"But look sharp--here are two what's-his-names in the act of starting!\"  Unluckily, the sea-bound omnibus was full. \"Never mind!\" said Norman, cheerily. \"We'll walk on till the next one overtakes us.\"  They trudged on in silence, both thinking over the military problem, till they met an omnibus coming from the sea. The elder traveller took out his watch. \"Just twelve minutes and a half since we started,\" he remarked in an absent manner. Suddenly the vacant face brightened; the old man had an idea. \"My boy!\" he shouted, bringing his hand down upon Norman's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support.  Thus taken off his guard, the young man wildly staggered forwards, and seemed about to plunge into space: but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself. \"Problem in Precession and Nutation,\" he remarked--in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance. \"What is it?\" he hastily added, fearing his father might have been taken ill. \"Will you have some brandy?\"  \"When will the next omnibus overtake us? When? When?\" the old man cried, growing more excited every moment.  Norman looked gloomy. \"Give me time,\" he said. \"I must think it over.\" And once more the travellers passed on in silence--a silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs, who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty, under the personal superintendence of the Commander-in-Chief.     KNOT IX.  A SERPENT WITH CORNERS.     \"Water, water, every where,    Nor any drop to drink.\"   \"It'll just take one more pebble.\"  \"What ever _are_ you doing with those buckets?\"  The speakers were Hugh and Lambert. Place, the beach of Little Mendip. Time, 1.30, P.M. Hugh was floating a bucket in another a size larger, and trying how many pebbles it would carry without sinking. Lambert was lying on his back, doing nothing.  For the next minute or two Hugh was silent, evidently deep in thought. Suddenly he started. \"I say, look here, Lambert!\" he cried.  \"If it's alive, and slimy, and with legs, I don't care to,\" said Lambert.  \"Didn't Balbus say this morning that, if a body is immersed in liquid, it displaces as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk?\" said Hugh.  \"He said things of that sort,\" Lambert vaguely replied.  \"Well, just look here a minute. Here's the little bucket almost quite immersed: so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk. And now just look at it!\" He took out the little bucket as he spoke, and handed the big one to Lambert. \"Why, there's hardly a teacupful! Do you mean to say _that_ water is the same bulk as the little bucket?\"  \"Course it is,\" said Lambert.  \"Well, look here again!\" cried Hugh, triumphantly, as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one. \"Why, it doesn't half fill it!\"  \"That's _its_ business,\" said Lambert. \"If Balbus says it's the same bulk, why, it _is_ the same bulk, you know.\"  \"Well, I don't believe it,\" said Hugh.  \"You needn't,\" said Lambert. \"Besides, it's dinner-time. Come along.\"  They found Balbus waiting dinner for them, and to him Hugh at once propounded his difficulty.  \"Let's get you helped first,\" said Balbus, briskly cutting away at the joint. \"You know the old proverb 'Mutton first, mechanics afterwards'?\"  The boys did _not_ know the proverb, but they accepted it in perfect good faith, as they did every piece of information, however startling, that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor. They ate on steadily in silence, and, when dinner was over, Hugh set out the usual array of pens, ink, and paper, while Balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoon's task.  \"A friend of mine has a flower-garden--a very pretty one, though no great size--\"  \"How big is it?\" said Hugh.  \"That's what _you_ have to find out!\" Balbus gaily replied. \"All _I_ tell you is that it is oblong in shape--just half a yard longer than its width--and that a gravel-walk, one yard wide, begins at one corner and runs all round it.\"  \"Joining into itself?\" said Hugh.  \"_Not_ joining into itself, young man. Just before doing _that_, it turns a corner, and runs round the garden again, alongside of the first portion, and then inside that again, winding in and in, and each lap touching the last one, till it has used up the whole of the area.\"  \"Like a serpent with corners?\" said Lambert.  \"Exactly so. And if you walk the whole length of it, to the last inch, keeping in the centre of the path, it's exactly two miles and half a furlong. Now, while you find out the length and breadth of the garden, I'll see if I can think out that sea-water puzzle.\"  \"You said it was a flower-garden?\" Hugh inquired, as Balbus was leaving the room.  \"I did,\" said Balbus.  \"Where do the flowers grow?\" said Hugh. But Balbus thought it best not to hear the question. He left the boys to their problem, and, in the silence of his own room, set himself to unravel Hugh's mechanical paradox.  \"To fix our thoughts,\" he murmured to himself, as, with hands deep-buried in his pockets, he paced up and down the room, \"we will take a cylindrical glass jar, with a scale of inches marked up the side, and fill it with water up to the 10-inch mark: and we will assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water. We will now take a solid cylinder, such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to _half_ a pint of water, and plunge 4 inches of it into the water, so that the end of the cylinder comes down to the 6-inch mark. Well, that displaces 2 pints of water. What becomes of them? Why, if there were no more cylinder, they would lie comfortably on the top, and fill the jar up to the 12-inch mark. But unfortunately there _is_ more cylinder, occupying half the space between the 10-inch and the 12-inch marks, so that only _one_ pint of water can be accommodated there. What becomes of the other pint? Why, if there were no more cylinder, it would lie on the top, and fill the jar up to the 13-inch mark. But unfortunately----Shade of Newton!\" he exclaimed, in sudden accents of terror. \"When _does_ the water stop rising?\"  A bright idea struck him. \"I'll write a little essay on it,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  _Balbus's Essay._  \"When a solid is immersed in a liquid, it is well known that it displaces a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk, and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it, equal in bulk to the solid. Lardner says, precisely the same process occurs when a solid is _partially_ immersed: the quantity of liquid displaced, in this case, equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed, and the rise of the level being in proportion.  \"Suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed: a portion of the liquid is displaced, and the level of the liquid rises. But, by this rise of level, a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed, and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid, and a consequent rise of level. Again, this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion, and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise. It is self-evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed, and that the liquid will then begin to immerse whatever holds the solid, which, being connected with it, must for the time be considered a part of it. If you hold a stick, six feet long, with its end in a tumbler of water, and wait long enough, you must eventually be immersed. The question as to the source from which the water is supplied--which belongs to a high branch of mathematics, and is therefore beyond our present scope--does not apply to the sea. Let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing"]]]
