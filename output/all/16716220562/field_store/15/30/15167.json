There       is ample testimony to this effect in the rich vegetative remains       over wide areas.        In Spitzbergen, within twelve degrees of the pole, where now a       dwarf willow and a few herbaceous plants form the only       vegetation, and the ground is most of the time covered with snow       and ice, there were growing, in Miocene times, no less than       ninety-five species of trees, including yews, hazels, elders,       beech, elms, and others.33 But it is in the Miocene forests of       the continent of Europe where we meet with evidence of a       singularly mild climate.        There were at least eleven species of palms growing in       Switzerland; and one variety of them grew as far north as       Northern Germany.34        We can not give a list of all the species. On the one hand, there       were elms, willows, poplars, oaks, and beeches, thus far similar       to the forest growth of temperate regions. Mingled with these       were forests of trees like the tulip-tree, swamp cypress, and       liquid amber or sweet gum of the southern part of the United       States—plants whose home is in the warm and moist regions of the       earth. But there were also representatives of the tropical       regions—such as fig-trees, cinnamon-trees, and camphor-trees:       these are found growing now in tropical countries. Fruit-trees of       the cherry, plum, and almond species were also to be seen. Prof.       Heer points out how all this should convince us that a large part       of Europe, in the Miocene Age, possessed a climate not unlike       that of the Madeira or Canary Islands to-day. He calls especial       attention to the fact that these trees were nearly all of       evergreen species, and that a severe winter would destroy them.       He finds one hundred and thirty-one species of the Temperate       Zone—species that can stand a moderate amount of cold, but not       very hot and dry climates. He finds eighty-five species of       tropical plants that could not possibly live where the Winters       are severe. Mingled with these were nearly three hundred species       whose natural home is in the warm, temperate portions of the       earth. The only way you can explain this motley assemblage of       trees is, to suppose that in what is now Europe was a climate       free from extremes, allowing the trees to put forth flowers and       fruits all the year round. “Reminding us,” says Prof. Heer, “of       those fortunate zones where Nature never goes to rest.”35        Miocene Mammals.        Let us now inquire as to the animals that roamed through these       great forests we have been describing. The Miocene period       extended over a long lapse of time, and considerable change took       place among the animals belonging to the different parts of this       age. We will only give a general outline for the whole period.       The marsupials lingered along into the early stages of this       period, and then disappeared from Europe. The rhinoceros were       present in the early stages, and continued through the entire       age. We meet in this period animals of the elephant kind, two       species, the mastodon and deinotherium. Antelopes and gazelles       wandered in vast troops over the plains of Hungary, Spain, and       Southern France. Carnivorous animals resembling tigers and hyenas       found abundance of animal food. Herds of horse-like animals fed       on the rich herbage of the meadows. The birds were largely       represented. In the woods were to be seen flocks of gayly       feathered paroquets and trogons. On the plains secretary-birds       hunted the serpents and reptiles, which furnished them food—and       eagles were on the watch for their prey. Cranes waded in the       rivers for fish. Geese, herons, and pheasants must have been       abundant.        Our main interest centers in the order Quadrumana. We must       remember that this order appeared in the Eocene. Several species       were present in the Miocene. They wandered in the forests of       France, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy, and doubtless found       abundant food in the figs and bread-fruit, walnuts, almonds,       dates, and other nuts growing there.36 One of the most important       is regarded as belonging to the same genus as the Gibbons.37 This       is the genus which has been sometimes regarded as making a nearer       approach to man than any other monkey.38 Others, however,       consider it as belonging to an extinct family.39 In addition to       this species there were at least three other species: thus there       was no absence of simian life in the Miocene.40        From the sketch we have thus far drawn of the Miocene Age, it       seems to have been a very favorable one in every respect. One       writer41 affirms, that “the world never experienced a more       beautiful period.” And indeed it seems as if the facts bear out       this statement. A genial, temperate climate was the rule, even to       high northern latitudes. We need not doubt but that there were       grassy plains, wooded slopes, and rolling rivers. Was man present       to take advantage of all these favorable surroundings? Did he       wander through the evergreen forests, and hunt the deer,       antelope, and hogs—the hipparions, and mastodons, and       deinotheres—then so numerous?42 We know of no inherent       improbability of his existence at that time. An ape belonging to       a highly organized genus was then living in Europe. Every       condition considered necessary for the primeval Garden of Eden       was then satisfied. Let us stop for a minute and examine the       nature of the evidence considered sufficient to prove the       presence of man during any of the past geological ages.        Should we be so fortunate as to find portions of the bones of the       human skeleton in a geological formation in such positions that       they could not possibly have been introduced there since the       deposition of the containing bed, it would of course prove that       man was at least as old as the formation itself. But it happens       that human remains in beds of a previous geological age are very       rare. Indeed, human remains in formations of the Pleistocene       Age,43 during which we have ample testimony, as we shall see, of       the presence of man, are very rare. The cases in which there can       be no doubt can be reckoned on the fingers. The explanation of       this state of things is not at all difficult, for it is only       under very rare circumstances that portions of the bones of       animals even larger than man are preserved to us in geological       strata. Vast numbers die and vanish away without leaving a trace       behind them for every fragmentary bone we recover. In the case of       man we must remember that, in previous eras, he was present in       very small numbers; that, owing to his intelligence, he would not       be as liable to be drowned and swept away, and so mingle his       remains with beds of river detritus then forming, as were       animals. Mr. Lyell has made some remarks on the draining of the       Haarlem Lake by the government of Holland in 1853, which shows       that even favorable circumstances do not always preserve remains       for future inspection. Though called a lake, this body of water       was an arm of the sea, covering about forty-five thousand acres.       The population which had lived on the shores of the lake was       between thirty and forty thousand souls. “There had been many a       shipwreck, and many a naval fight on those waters, and hundreds       of Dutch and Spanish soldiers and sailors had met there with a       watery grave,” yet not a solitary portion of the human skeleton       was to be found in its bed.44 Thus we see that, in the majority       of cases, we must rely on other evidence than the presence of       human bones to prove the existence of man in the geological       periods of the past. In the case of the Haarlem Lake again, there       was found the wreck of one or two vessels, and some ancient       armor. So, had it been a disputed point whether man was a denizen       of this planet at the time when the area in question was covered       by water, it would have been settled beyond a doubt by these       relics of his industry, even though portions of the human frame       itself were entirely wanting. And, in reality, proofs of this       nature are just as satisfactory as it would be to discover human       bones. If, on a desert island, we find arrow-heads, javelins, a       place where there had been a fire, split bones, and other       _débris_ of a feast, we are as much justified in asserting that       man had been there, as we would be had we seen him with our own       eyes. In the same manner, if we detect in any strata of the past       any undoubted products of human industry—such as weapons, or       implements and ornaments—in such position that we know they could       not have been deposited there since the formation of the bed       itself, we have no hesitancy in asserting that man himself is of       the same antiquity as the strata containing the implements. In       the great majority of cases, this is the only kind of evidence       possible to advance.        It is now well known that the first stage in the culture of any       people, is what is called the Stone Age. That is to say, their       weapons and implements were made from stone, or at least the       majority of them were. We will discuss on another page this       point, and also the grounds leading us to infer that many of the       extremely rude forms are really the work of man.        Let us now return to the Miocene Age, in which we are to seek for       the presence of man. In 1867 a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2873"],["title","The Prehistoric World; Or, Vanished Races (#8)"],["body","geologist, by the name of       Bourgeois, who had been searching some beds of the Miocene Age,       near Thenay, France, found a number of flints of such a peculiar       shape, that he concluded they could only be explained by       supposing that man formed them. In this case there is to question       as to the age of the stratum containing the flints. All       geologists are agreed that it is of the Miocene Age. The question       then is, whether the flints were artificially cut or not. On this       question there has been a great division of opinion, and we can       not do better than to examine and see where the Principal       scientific men stand on this point.        In 1872, at the scientific congress in Brussels, this question       was referred to a committee composed of the most competent men       from the different countries of Europe. We are sorry to say that,       after a thorough consideration of them, the judges were unable to       agree. Some accepted them, others rejected them, and still others       were undecided. Some of the latter have since become convinced by       recent discoveries.45        Since this discovery, similar specimens have been described as       having been found in Portugal, and from another locality in       France. Some men of the highest authority accept these flints as       proving the presence of man in Miocene times. This is supported       by such men as Quatrefages, Hamy, Mortillet, and Capellini.46       These are all known to be competent and careful geologists.       Another class does not think the evidence strong enough to       declare these flints of human origin, and so do not think it       proved that man lived in Europe in Miocene times; but do believe       that we will eventually find proofs of his existence during that       era in the warm and tropical regions of the globe. This is the       view of such men as Lubbock, Evans, Huxley, and Winchell. Still       others say that, during the vast lapse of years since Miocene       times, all the species of land mammals then alive have       perished47—their place being taken by other species—and therefore       it is incredible that man, the most highly specialized of all       animals, should have survived. And hence, if these Thenay flints       are really artificial in their origin, it is more reasonable to       suppose they were cut by one of the higher apes, then living in       France, than by man. This is the view of Prof. Dawkins and Prof.       Gaudry.48 As to the last view, it is surely but reasonable to       suppose, with Quatrefages,49 that the superior intelligence of       man would serve to protect him from the operation of causes that       would effect the extinction of lower animals. Hence, unless some       evidence be produced to show that species of apes are known to       make rude stone implements, or some evidence that they did this       in past ages, we must believe, with Geikie and others, that these       flints prove that Miocene man lived in France, unless indeed we       refuse to believe that they are artificial.        It also seems to us that those who hold to the view that man was       living in other parts of the world, as Asia, during the Miocene       Age, ought readily to admit that a few wandering bands might       penetrate into Europe.50 The climate was tropical, there was an       abundance of animal life, and, if man was living anywhere, it is       very reasonable to suppose that, at some epoch during the course       of the Miocene Age, he would have found his way to Europe, unless       shut off by the sea. It therefore seems to us that the presence       of those cut flints is conclusive of the presence of man in       Europe during the Miocene Age. At the same time we can not affirm       that this is the conclusion of the scientific world. They seem to       have heeded the remark of Quatrefages, that “in such a matter       there is no great urgency,” and are waiting for further       discoveries.        Thus far in our review we have noticed the steady progress in the       forms of life. In the Miocene Age we have seen all the types of       life below man present, and some indications of the presence of       man himself. We must now learn what we can of the Pliocene Age,       the last division of the Tertiary Age.        The Pliocene Age need not detain us long. Considerable changes in       the geography of both Europe and America were going forward       during the Miocene Age, and the result was quite a change in       climate. There was a steady elevation of the Pacific coast region       of America, and, as a consequences a period of great volcanic       outbursts in California and Oregon.51 At the same time the bridge       connecting Asia and America was severed.52 In Europe the       Mediterranean area was elevated; but the land connecting       Greenland with Europe sank, allowing the cold waters of the       Arctic to communicate with both the North Sea and the       Atlantic—England at that time forming part of the great peninsula       extending north and west from Europe.53 The climate during the       Pliocene Age was cooler than that of the Miocene. This is marked       in the vegetation of that period. The palms and the cinnamon       trees, which in Miocene times grew in Germany, flourished no       farther north than Italy during the Pliocene.54        Count DeSaporta, who made special researches in the flora of this       period, found the remains of a forest growth buried under lava on       the side of a mountain in Cantal France, at an elevation of about       four thousand feet above the level of the sea. This consisted       principally of pines. This shows that probably all Northern       Europe was covered with somber forests of pine. In the same       section he found, buried under volcanic ash, a vegetation       consisting mostly of deciduous trees—maples, alders, poplars,       willows, elms, and ashes. As this was growing at the height Of       about twenty-three hundred feet in Cantal France, it probably       represents the vegetation of Britain and Northern Germany.       Finally, the vegetation of Central and Southern France, as well       as Northern Italy, was intermediate in character between the       luxuriant evergreen forests of the Miocene Age and that now       growing there. The tropical character of the vegetation was       evidently passing away. The climate over a large part of Europe       was now temperate, though probably warmer than at present.55        In the Mammalia we have to notice the disappearance of some       species, and the arrival and spread of some others. The apes       living as far north as Germany in the Miocene Age were restricted       to Southern France and Italy in the Pliocene, and, at its close,       vanished altogether from Europe. The first living species of       mammals is found in the remains of the hippopotamus that       frequented the rivers of Pliocene times. The mastodon of Miocene       times was still to be seen, but along with it was a species of       true elephants. The hipparion survived into this epoch, but the       horse also makes its appearance. Great quantities of deer roamed       over the land; and, as might be expected where they were so       abundant, the carnivorous animals allied to the bears and wolves,       panthers, linxes, and tigers, were also to be found. “At night,”       says Mr. Dawkins, “the Pliocene forests of Central France echoed       with the weird laughter of the hyena.”        The gradual lowering of the climate is also shown by the remains       of the mollusks deposited in beds of marine or sea formation       during different eras of this age. It is found that the earlier       the bed, the more southern mollusks are found in it. This shows       us that, all through the Pliocene Age, the waters of the seas       surrounding England were gradually growing cooler, thus       compelling the retreat of those mollusks fitted only for a warm       climate, and allowing a gradual increase in those species fitted       for cold or northern latitudes. We also find, in deposits made       near the close of Pliocene times, numbers of stone which show all       evidence of having been borne thither by means of ice. So we may       conclude that rafts of ice came floating down the North Sea       during the closing period of the Pliocene Age.56 Still, during       the entire length of the Pliocene Age, Europe certainly offered       an inviting home for man. Not only were the higher orders of       animals present, but at least one living species was known. We       find more proofs of his presence, but whether they are sufficient       to convince us that man really lived during that epoch is to be       seen.        Prof. Whitney has brought to the attention of the scientific       world what he considers ample evidence of the presence of       Pliocene man in California. We reserve this for discussion in       another place. We will only remark, at present, that the evidence       in this case is regarded as sufficient by some of the best of       American Scholars.57 We simply mention them here, so that they       may be borne in mind when we see what evidence Europe has to       offer on this point. In 1863, M. Desnoyers, of France,       discovered, in a stratum which he considered Pliocene, some bones       of elephants and other animals cut and scratched in such a manner       that he considered the cuts to be the work of man. As showing how       cautious geologists are of accepting such conclusions, we mention       this case. There was found in the same bed the remains of an       extinct beaver. The question was at once raised, whether rodents       by gnawing these bones could not have produced the cuts in       question.
