At all events, he lounged gracefully toward the sofa, on which she and Ruby were sitting: \"I say, Miss Heritage,\" he began, \"you mustn't let my Kiddie sister bore you like this. She's been whispering away in your ear for the last ten minutes.\"  Daphne denied that she was being bored.  \"Of _course_ she isn't!\" said Ruby; \"I was finishing the story I began telling her when we were walking home. We'd got to where Daphne first meets the Fairy Prince.\"  \"Then it's all about Miss Heritage, is it?\"  \"I call the heroine 'Daphne' in my story, after her--but, of course, she isn't Miss Heritage _really_.\"  \"You don't seem to think it very likely that Miss Heritage will ever come across a Fairy Prince, eh!\" commented Clarence, and wondered the next moment whether he mightn't have said something to commit himself.  \"I hope not,\" said Ruby, slipping her hand affectionately through Daphne's arm, \"because then she'd leave me, and I should never see her again!\"  \"I shouldn't worry about it just yet, darling,\" said Daphne, smiling. \"Fairy Princes are only to be found in their own country--and it's a long way from here to Fairyland.\"  Clarence was noticing, not for the first time, that her full face was shaped like a shield, also that two fascinating little creases came in it when she smiled, and her pretty grey eyes had a soft sparkle in them. \"I must be jolly careful,\" he told himself.  \"I should prefer, Miss Heritage,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, who had overheard the last sentence, \"that Ruby was not encouraged to fill her head with Fairy tales. I don't think them good for her.\"  \"Oh, come, Mater!\" protested Clarence, unable to resist the _rôle_ of Champion. \"Where on earth is the harm of them.\"  \"Surely, Clarence,\" Edna put in instructively, \"there is _this_ harm--they give such an utterly false impression of what life really _is_! That's why I've never been able to take any interest in them.\"  \"More likely,\" said Clarence, \"because you've got no imagination.\"  \"If I hadn't,\" retorted Edna, \"I should hardly have got through the Poetry I have. Most of Browning and Alfred Austin, and all Ella Wheeler Wilcox! It's only the lowest degree of imagination that invents things that couldn't possibly have happened!\"  \"They may have left off, Edna, but they happened _once_,\" declared Ruby. \"I know there _used_ to be Fairyland somewhere, with Kings and Queens and Fairy Godmothers and enchanted castles and magicians and Ogres and Dragons and things in it. And Miss Heritage believes it, too--_don't_ you, Miss Heritage, dear?\"  \"I'm much mistaken in Miss Heritage, my dear,\" said Mr. Stimpson gallantly, \"if her head isn't too well screwed on (if she'll allow me to say so) to believe in any such stuff. All very well for the Nursery, you know, but not to be taken seriously, or ... why, what's that? Most extraordinary noise! Seems to come from outside, overhead.\"  They could all hear a strange kind of flapping whirr in the air, it grew nearer and louder and then suddenly ceased.  \"Aeroplane,\" pronounced Clarence, drawing the window curtains and looking out. \"Miles away by now, though. Terrific pace they travel at. Too dark to see anything.\"  He returned to the hearthrug, and the moment afterwards, the silence outside was broken by a shrill, clear call which seemed to come from silver trumpets.  \"Very odd,\" said Mr. Stimpson, \"some one seems to be playing trumpets on the gravel-sweep!\"  \"If it's one of those travelling German bands,\" said his wife, \"you'd better send them away at once, Sidney.\"  But, whoever they were, they had already entered the hall, for almost immediately the drawing-room door was thrown open and two persons wearing tabards and gaily plumed hats entered and sounded another blast.  \"'Pon my word, you know,\" gasped Mr. Stimpson, \"this is really----\"  The heralds stepped back as a third person entered. He was wearing a rich suit of some long-departed period, and, with his furrowed face and deep-set eyes, he rather resembled an elderly mastiff, though he did not convey the same impression of profound wisdom. He gazed round the room as though he himself were as bewildered as its other occupants, who were speechless with amazement. Then his eye fell on Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, and he hesitated no longer, but, advancing towards her chair, sank with some difficulty on one knee, seized her hand, and kissed it with every sign of deep respect.  \"Heaven be praised!\" he cried in a voice that faltered with emotion, \"I have at last found the Queen we have so long sought in vain!\" He spoke with some sort of foreign accent, but they all understood him perfectly. As he knelt they heard a loud crack which seemed to come from between his shoulders.  \"Braces given way,\" whispered Clarence to Edna; \"silly old ass to go kneeling in 'em!\"  \"Really, sir,\" said Mr. Stimpson, \"this is most extraordinary behaviour.\"  \"You don't understand, Sidney,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, who had recovered from her first alarm and was now in a gratified flutter; \"remember what I told you about Lady Harriet and the Pageant! Pray, get up, sir,\" she added to the stranger, \"I haven't the advantage of knowing your name.\"  \"I am the Court Chamberlain,\" he said, \"and my name is Treuherz von Eisenbänden.\"  It was unknown to Mrs. Stimpson, but she concluded that he was some Anglo-German commercial magnate, who would naturally be invited to join the Committee for any such patriotic purpose as a Pageant.  As to the excessive ceremony of his manner, that was either the proper form for the occasion, or, what was more likely, Mr. Troitz, or whatever his name was, having come fresh from a dress rehearsal, could not divest himself as yet of his assumed character. The important point was that her interview with Lady Harriet had borne fruit already, and in the shape of a pressing invitation to play the distinguished part of \"Queen!\" The advantages thus offered for obtaining a social footing amongst county people made it easy to overlook any trifling eccentricities where the intention was so obviously serious. \"Well, Mr. Troitz,\" she said graciously, \"since the Committee have been kind enough to ask me, I shall be very pleased to be your Queen.\"  \"And if I may say so, Sir,\" said her husband, \"there are few ladies in the vicinity who would prove more competent. In fact----\"  \"That will do, Sidney,\" said his wife; \"if Lady Harriet and the Committee did not consider me competent to be the Queen they would not have asked me.\" And Mr. Stimpson said no more.  \"Pardon,\" Mr. Treuherz said, looking at him with solemn surprise, \"but--who is _this_?\"  \"This is my husband, Mr. Troitz--let me introduce him.\"  \"Your husband. Then, he will be the King!\"  \"The King?\" cried Mr. Stimpson, \"why, really, I'm not sure that would be altogether in my line.\"  \"Nonsense, Sidney. Of _course_ you will be the King if they want you! And this is my son, Clarence, Mr. Troitz. My daughters, Edna and Ruby.\"  \"A Crown Prince!\" cried Treuherz, and bent low to each in turn. \"And two--no, I mistake--_three_ Princesses! Ah, it is too much for me altogether!\"  It was almost too much for Ruby, who giggled helplessly, while even Daphne had to bite her lip rather hard for a moment.  \"The other young lady,\" corrected Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"is merely my daughter Ruby's governess--Miss Heritage. But if you like to find a place for her as one of my ladies of honour or something, I have no objection to her accepting a part,\" she added, reflecting that Miss Heritage's manners and appearance would add to the family importance, while it would be a comfort to have an attendant who could not give herself such airs as might a girl belonging to a county family.  \"Naturally,\" said Treuherz, inclining himself again. \"Any member of your Majesty's household you desire to bring.\"  \"Very well; I suppose, Miss Heritage, you have no objection? Then you will accompany us, please. And now, Mr. Troitz, about when shall we be wanted?\"  \"When?\" he replied. \"But now! At once. Already I have the car waiting!\"  \"Now?\" exclaimed Clarence; \"rum time to rehearse--what?\"  \"Who said anything about rehearsing, Clarence?\" said his mother impatiently. \"It's necessary for them to see us and talk over the arrangements. It's not likely to take long.\"  \"But it'll do later, my love,\" put in Mr. Stimpson, who did not like the idea of turning out without his dinner. \"Fact is, Mr. Troitz, we were just about to sit down to dinner. Why not keep the car waiting a bit and join us? No ceremony, you know--just as you _are_!\"  \"Sire, I regret that it is impossible,\" he said. \"I have undertaken to convey you with all possible speed. If we delay I cannot answer for what may happen.\"  \"You hear what Mr. Troitz says, Sidney,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, alarmed at the idea of another being chosen in her absence. \"What _does_ it matter if we do dine a little late? Children, we must go and put on our things at once--your warmest cloaks, mind--we're sure to find it cold motoring. Sidney and Clarence, you had better get your coats on--we shall be down directly.\"  Mr. Treuherz and the heralds stood at attention in the hall. While Clarence and his father struggled into their great-coats, neither of them in a very good temper, Mr. Stimpson being annoyed at postponing his dinner for what he called \"tomfoolery,\" and Clarence secretly sulky because his parent could not be induced to see the propriety of going up to change his tie.  \"I haven't _yet_ made out, Mother,\" said Edna, as they came downstairs, \"exactly where we're going to--or what we're expected to do when we get there.\"  \"It will either be The Hermitage--Lady Harriet's, you know--or Mr. Troitz's country house, wherever _that_ is. And, of course, the Committee require to know what times will suit us for rehearsing.\"  \"I wish you'd settle it all without _me_,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28459"],["title","In Brief Authority (#5)"],["body","Edna. \"I'd much rather stay at home, and run over my lecture notes.... Well, if I must come, I shall bring my note-book with me in case I'm bored.\" And she ran into the drawing-room, and came back with the note-book, rather as an emblem of her own intellectual superiority than with any intention of referring to it. However, as will be found later, the manuscript proved to be of some service in the future.  Daphne and Ruby were the last to join the party in the hall, Ruby wildly excited at the unexpected jaunt and the prospects of not going to bed till ever so late, and Daphne, though a little doubtful whether Mrs. Stimpson was quite justified in bringing her, inclined to welcome almost any change from the evening _routine_ of \"Inglegarth.\" And then, after Mrs. Stimpson had given some hurried instructions to the hopelessly mystified Mitchell, the whole family issued out of the Queen Anne porch, and were conducted by Treuherz, who, to their intense confusion, insisted on walking backwards to the car, while the heralds performed another flourish on their silver trumpets. It was pitch-dark when they had got to the asphalt pavement outside their gates, but they could just make out the contours of the car in the light that streamed across the hedge to the stained glass front-door.  \"Jolly queer-looking car,\" said Clarence. It was certainly unusually large, and seemed to have somewhat fantastic lines and decorations.  \"Oh, never mind about the car!\" cried Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, who was inside it already, a vague, bundled-up shape in the gloom. \"It's part of the Pageant, of course! Get in, Clarence, get in! We're late as it is! and if there's a thing I detest, it's keeping people waiting!\"  \"All right, Mater!\" said Clarence, clambering in. \"I can't make out what the dickens they've done with the bonnet--but we seem to be moving, what?\"  Slowly the car had begun to glide along the road. Mr. Treuherz was seated in front, probably at the steering-wheel, though none was visible. The heralds sat in the rear, and the car was of such a size that there was abundant room for the family in the centre. Some yards ahead they heard a curious dry rustle and clatter, and could distinguish a confused grey mass of forms that seemed to be clearing the way for them, though whether they were human beings it was not possible to tell till they passed a lighted street-lamp.  \"Why, goodness gracious!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"they look like--like _ostriches_!\"  She was mistaken here, because they were merely storks, but, before she could identify them more correctly, they all suddenly rose in the air with a whirr like that of a hundred spinning looms--and the car rose with them.  \"Stop!\" screamed Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"Sidney, tell Mr. Troitz to stop! I _insist_ on knowing where we are being taken to!\"  Treuherz glanced over his shoulder. \"Where should I conduct your Majesties,\" he said, \"but to your own Kingdom of Märchenland?\"  Mrs. Stimpson and her husband would no doubt have protested, demanded explanations, insisted upon being put down at once, had they been able; but, whether it was that the car had some peculiarly soporific tendency, or whether it was merely the sudden swift rush through the upper air, a torpor had already fallen on the whole Stimpson family. It was even questionable if they remained long enough awake to hear their destination.  Daphne, for some reason, did not fall asleep till later. She lay back in her luxuriously cushioned seat, watching the birds as they flew, spread out in a wide fan against the dusky blue evening sky. Gablehurst, with its scattered lights, artistic villa-residences, and prosaic railway station--its valley and common and wooded hills, were far below and soon left behind at an ever increasing distance. But she did not feel in the least afraid. It was odd, but, after the first surprise, she had lost all sense of strangeness in a situation so foreign to all her previous experience.  \"So we're being taken to Märchenland,\" she was thinking. \"That's the same as Fairyland, practically. At least it's where all the things they call Fairy stories really happened, and--_why_ I can't imagine--but Mr. and Mrs. Stimpson have been chosen King and Queen! And the poor dear things have no idea of it yet! Oh, I wonder\" (and here, no doubt, the little creases came into her cheeks again, for she laughed softly to herself), \"I _wonder_ what they'll say or do when they find out!\" And while Daphne was still wondering, her eyelids closed gently, and she, too, was sleeping soundly.     CHAPTER III  FINE FEATHERS   Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson was the first of her party to recover consciousness. When she did, she was greatly surprised to find that it was broad daylight, and that she was lying on a grassy slope, behind which was a forest of huge pines. Close beside her were the recumbent forms of her husband and family, which led her to the natural conclusion that the car must have met with an accident.  \"Sidney!\" she cried, shaking him by the shoulder. \"Speak to me! You're--you're not _seriously_ hurt, are you?\"  \"Eh, what?\" he replied sleepily, and evidently imagining that he was comfortably in bed at home; \"all right, my dear, all right! I'll get up and bring in the tea-tray presently. Lots of time.... Why, hullo!\" he exclaimed, after being shaken once more, as he sat up and rubbed his eyes. \"How do we all come to be _here_?\"  The others were awake by this time. \"And now we're here,\" put in Clarence, \"where _are_ we, eh, Mater?\"  \"It is no use asking _me_, Clarence. I know no more than you do. The last thing I remember was our all getting into the car to go and see the Pageant Committee. I've a vague recollection of ostriches--but no, I must have been dreaming _them_. However, the car seems to have upset somehow, only I don't see it about anywhere.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. Stimpson, \"or old Thingumagig, or those fellows with the trumpets either.\"  \"Dumped us down here, and gone off with the car,\" said Clarence. \"Looks as if we'd been the victims of a practical joke, what?\"  \"They would never dare to do that!\" said his Mother. \"I expect they have missed their way in the dark. Very careless of them. I don't know what Lady Harriet and the Committee will think of me. They'll probably ask somebody else to take the part of Queen before we can get there--for I'm sure we must be a good hundred miles away from Gablehurst!\"  \"The Baron said that he was taking us to Märchenland, Mrs. Stimpson,\" said Daphne; \"and I'm _almost_ sure that that is where we really are.\"  \"And where may Märchenland be?\" inquired Mrs. Stimpson sharply. \"I never heard of it myself.\"  \"Well,\" said Daphne, \"it's another name for--for Fairyland, you know.\"  \"Fairyland indeed!\" replied Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson with some irritation. \"You will find it difficult to persuade me to believe that I am in _Fairyland_, Miss Heritage! To begin with, there is no such place, and if there was, perhaps you will kindly tell me how we could possibly have got to it?\"  \"Through the air,\" explained Daphne patiently. \"That car was drawn by _storks_, you see--not ostriches.\"  \"When you have _quite_ woke up, Miss Heritage,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, \"you will realise what nonsense you are talking.\"  \"Whatever this place is,\" said Clarence, \"it don't look English, somehow, to _me_. I mean to say--that town over there--what?\" He pointed across the wide plain to a cluster of towers, spires, gables, and pinnacles which glittered and gleamed faintly through the shimmering morning haze.  \"It certainly has rather a Continental appearance,\" observed his father.  \"If it has,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"it is only some buildings or scenery or something they have run up for the Pageant. So we haven't been taken in the wrong direction after all.\"  \"_I_ believe, Mummy,\" chirped Ruby, \"Miss Heritage is right, and this _is_ Fairyland.\"  \"Don't be so ridiculous, child! You'll believe next that we came here in a car drawn by flying storks, I suppose!\"  \"D'you know, Mater,\" said Clarence, \"I'm not so sure we mayn't have. What I mean is--there's some sort of flying machine coming along now. I grant you it isn't drawn by storks, but they're _birds_ anyhow, and there seems to be some one in the car too.\"  \"Nothing of the kind!\" declared Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson obstinately. \"At least one may fancy one sees anything with the sun in our eyes as it is. Well, upon my word!\" she added, still incredulously, as an iridescent shell-shaped chariot attached to a team of snow-white doves _volplaned_ down from a dizzy height to a spot only a few yards away, \"I really could not have--who, and what can this old person be?\"  The occupant of the chariot had already got out of it, and was slowly coming towards them, supporting herself on a black crutch-handled staff. As she drew nearer they could see that she was a woman of great age. She wore a large ruff, a laced stomacher, wide quilted petticoats, and a pointed hat with a broad brim. Her expression was severe, but not unkindly, while she evidently considered herself a personage of some importance.  \"She looks exactly like the Fairy Godmother in the pictures,\" whispered Ruby.  \"Whoever she may be,\" said her Mother, scrambling to her feet with more haste than dignity, \"I suppose I shall have to go and speak to her, as I presume I am the person she has come to meet.\"  However, it was Daphne who was addressed by the new-comer.  \"The Court Chamberlain, Baron Treuherz von Eisenbänden, has brought me the glad tidings of your arrival, my child,\" she said in a high cracked voice, \"and, as the high official Court Godmother to the Royal Family, I felt that I should be the first to bid you welcome.\"  This was more than Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson could be expected to stand without a protest.  \"Pardon me,\" she said, throwing back her cloak as though she were in need of air, \"pardon me, Madam, but I think you are mistaking my daughter's governess for _me_. I am Mrs. Wibberley-St"]]]
