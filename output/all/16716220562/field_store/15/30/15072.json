W.L. Bowles. But      PEMBROKE deserved a more particular notice. Exclusively of      his fine statues, and architectural decorations, the Earl      contrived to procure a number of curious and rare books; and      the testimonies of Maittaire [who speaks indeed of him with      a sort of rapture!] and Palmer shew that the productions of      Jenson and Caxton were no strangers to his library. _Annales      Typographici_, vol. I. 13. edit. 1719. _History of      Printing_, p. v. \"There is nothing that so surely proves the      pre-eminence of virtue more than the universal admiration of      mankind, and the respect paid it even by persons in opposite      interests; and more than this, it is a sparkling gem which      even time does not destroy: it is hung up in the Temple of      Fame, and respected for ever.\" _Continuation of Granger_,      vol. I. 37, &c. \"He raised, continues Mr. Noble, a      collection of Antiques that were unrivalled by any subject.      His learning made him a fit companion for the literati.      Wilton will ever be a monument of his extensive knowledge;      and the princely presents it contains, of the high      estimation in which he was held by foreign potentates, as      well as by the many monarchs he saw and served at home. He      lived rather as a primitive christian; in his behaviour,      meek: in his dress, plain: rather retired, conversing but      little.\" Burnet, in the _History of his own Times_, has      spoken of the Earl with spirit and propriety.]       [Footnote 8: In the recent Variorum Edition of Pope's Works,      all that is annexed to Hearne's name, as above introduced by      the Poet, is, \"well known as an Antiquarian.\"       ALAS, POOR HEARNE!       thy merits, which are now fully appreciated, deserve an      ampler notice! In spite of Gibbon's unmerciful critique      [_Posthumous Works_, vol. II. 711.], the productions of this      modest, erudite, and indefatigable antiquary are rising in      price proportionably to their worth. If he had only edited      the _Collectanea_ and _Itinerary_ of his favourite Leland,      he would have stood on high ground in the department of      literature and antiquities; but his other and numerous works      place him on a much loftier eminence. Of these, the present      is not the place to make mention; suffice it to say that,      for copies of his works, on LARGE PAPER, which the author      used to advertise as selling for 7_s._ or 10_s._, or about      which placards, to the same effect, used to be stuck on the      walls of the colleges,--these very copies are now sometimes      sold for more than the like number of guineas! It is amusing      to observe that the lapse of a few years only has caused      such a rise in the article of HEARNE; and that the Peter      Langtoft on large paper, which at Rowe Mores's sale [Bibl.      Mores. No. 2191.] was purchased for £1. 2_s._ produced at      a late sale, [A.D. 1808] £37! A complete list of Hearne's      Pieces will be found at the end of his Life, printed with      Leland's, &c., at the Clarendon Press, in 1772, 8vo. Of      these the \"_Acta Apostolorum_, Gr. Lat;\" and \"_Aluredi      Beverlacensis Annales_,\" are, I believe, the scarcest. It is      wonderful to think how this amiable and excellent man      persevered \"through evil report and good report,\" in      illustrating the antiquities of his country. To the very      last he appears to have been molested; and among his      persecutors, the learned editor of Josephus and Dionysius      Halicarnasseus, Dr. Hudson, must be ranked, to the disgrace      of himself and the party which he espoused. \"Hearne was      buried in the church yard of St. Peter's (at Oxford) in the      East, where is erected over his remains, a tomb, with an      inscription written by himself,            Amicitiæ Ergo.           Here lyeth the Body of           THOMAS HEARNE, M.A.           Who studied and preserved           Antiquities.           He dyed June 10, 1735.           Aged 57 years.

One is      rather surprised at not finding any reference to this      masterly piece of bibliography in the last edition of Mr.      Roscoe's Leo X., where there is a pleasing account of the      establishment of the Aldine Press.]       [Footnote 12: I do not recollect having seen any book bound      by this binder.

They      were the productions of my juvenile years; and I need hardly      say, at this period, how ashamed I am of their author-ship.      The monthly and Analytical Reviews did me the kindness of      just tolerating them, and of warning me not to commit any      future trespass upon the premises of Parnassus. I struck off      500 copies, and was glad to get rid of half of them as waste      paper; the remaining half has been partly destroyed by my      own hands, and has partly mouldered away in oblivion amidst      the dust of Booksellers' shelves. My only consolation is      that the volume is _exceedingly rare_!]  If ever there was a country upon the face of the globe--from the days of Nimrod the beast, to Bagford[15] the book-hunter--distinguished for the variety, the justness, and magnanimity of its views; if ever there was a nation which really and unceasingly \"felt for another's woe\" [I call to witness our Infirmaries, Hospitals, Asylums, and other public and private Institutions of a charitable nature, that, like so many belts of adamant, unite and strengthen us in the great cause of HUMANITY]; if ever there was a country and a set of human beings pre-eminently distinguished for all the social virtues which soften and animate the soul of man, surely OLD ENGLAND and ENGLISHMEN ARE THEY! The common cant, it may be urged, of all writers in favour of the country where they chance to live! And what, you will say, has this to do with Book Collectors and Books?--Much, every way: a nation thus glorious is, at this present eventful moment, afflicted not only with the Dog[16], but the BOOK, disease--       Fire in each eye, and paper in each hand      They rave, recite,----       [Footnote 15: \"JOHN BAGFORD, by profession a bookseller,      frequently travelled into Holland and other parts, in search      of scarce books and valuable prints, and brought a vast      number into this kingdom, the greatest part of which were      purchased by the Earl of Oxford. He had been in his younger      days a shoemaker; and, for the many curiosities wherewith he      enriched the famous library of Dr. John Moore, Bishop of      Ely, his Lordship got him admitted into the Charter House.      He died in 1706, aged 65: after his death Lord Oxford      purchased all his collections and papers, for his library:      these are now in the Harleian collection in the British      Museum.

He was the most hungry and      rapacious of all book and print collectors; and, in his      ravages, spared neither the most delicate nor costly      specimens. His eyes and his mouth seem to have been always      open to express his astonishment at, sometimes, the most      common and contemptible productions; and his paper in the      Philosophical Transactions betrays such simplicity and      ignorance that one is astonished how my Lord Oxford and the      learned Bishop of Ely could have employed so credulous a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],["title","Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#4)"],["body"," forager. A modern collector and lover of      _perfect_ copies will witness, with shuddering, among      Bagford's immense collection of Title Pages, in the Museum,      the frontispieces of the Complutensian Polyglot, and      Chauncy's History of Hertfordshire, torn out to illustrate a      History of Printing. His enthusiasm, however, carried him      through a great deal of laborious toil; and he supplied, in      some measure, by this qualification, the want of other      attainments. His whole mind was devoted to book-hunting; and      his integrity and diligence probably made his employers      overlook his many failings. His hand-writing is scarcely      legible, and his orthography is still more wretched; but if      he was ignorant, he was humble, zealous, and grateful; and      he has certainly done something towards the accomplishment      of that desirable object, an accurate General History of      Printing. In my edition of _Ames's Typographical      Antiquities_, I shall give an analysis of Bagford's papers,      with a specimen or two of his composition.]       [Footnote 16: For an eloquent account of this disorder      consult the letters of Dr. Mosely inserted in the Morning      Herald of last year. I have always been surprised, and a      little vexed, that these animated pieces of composition      should be relished and praised by every one--but _the      Faculty_!]  Let us enquire, therefore, into the origin and tendency of the BIBLIOMANIA.  In this enquiry I purpose considering the subject under three points of view: I. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE; or an account of the eminent men who have fallen victims to it: II. THE NATURE, OR SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE: and III. THE PROBABLE MEANS OF ITS CURE. We are to consider, then,  1. THE HISTORY OF THE DISEASE. In treating of the history of this disease, it will be found to have been attended with this remarkable circumstance; namely, that it has almost uniformly confined its attacks to the _male_ sex, and, among these, to people in the higher and middling classes of society, while the artificer, labourer, and peasant have escaped wholly uninjured. It has raged chiefly in palaces, castles, halls, and gay mansions; and those things which in general are supposed not to be inimical to health, such as cleanliness, spaciousness, and splendour, are only so many inducements towards the introduction and propagation of the BIBLIOMANIA! What renders it particularly formidable is that it rages in all seasons of the year, and at all periods of human existence. The emotions of friendship or of love are weakened or subdued as old age advances; but the influence of this passion, or rather disease, admits of no mitigation: \"it grows with our growth, and strengthens with our strength;\" and is oft-times       ----The ruling passion strong in death.[17]       [Footnote 17: The writings of the Roman philologers seem to      bear evidence of this fact. Seneca, when an old man, says      that, \"if you are fond of books, you will escape the ennui      of life; you will neither sigh for evening, disgusted with      the occupations of the day--nor will you live dissatisfied      with yourself, or unprofitable to others.\" _De      Tranquilitate_, ch. 3. Cicero has positively told us that      \"study is the food of youth, and the amusement of old age.\"      _Orat. pro Archia_. The younger Pliny was a downright      Bibliomaniac. \"I am quite transported and comforted,\" says      he, \"in the midst of my books: they give a zest to the      happiest, and assuage the anguish of the bitterest, moments      of existence! Therefore, whether distracted by the cares or      the losses of my family, or my friends, I fly to my library      as the only refuge in distress: here I learn to bear      adversity with fortitude.\" _Epist._ lib. viii. cap. 19. But      consult Cicero _De Senectute_. All these treatises afford      abundant proof of the hopelessness of cure in cases of the      Bibliomania.]  We will now, my dear Sir, begin \"making out the catalogue\" of victims to the BIBLIOMANIA! The first eminent character who appears to have been infected with this disease was RICHARD DE BURY, one of the tutors of Edward III., and afterwards Bishop of Durham; a man who has been uniformly praised for the variety of his erudition, and the intenseness of his ardour in book-collecting.[18] I discover no other notorious example of the fatality of the BIBLIOMANIA until the time of Henry VII.; when the monarch himself may be considered as having added to the number. Although our venerable typographer, Caxton, lauds and magnifies, with equal sincerity, the whole line of British Kings, from Edward IV. to Henry VII. [under whose patronage he would seem, in some measure, to have carried on his printing business], yet, of all these monarchs, the latter alone was so unfortunate as to fall a victim to this disease. His library must have been a magnificent one, if we may judge from the splendid specimens of it which now remain.[19] It would appear, too, that, about this time, the BIBLIOMANIA was increased by the introduction of foreign printed books; and it is not very improbable that a portion of Henry's immense wealth was devoted towards the purchase of VELLUM copies, which were now beginning to be published by the great typographical triumvirate, Verard, Eustace, and Pigouchet.       [Footnote 18: It may be expected that I should notice a few      book-lovers, and probably BIBLIOMANIACS, previously to the      time of Richard De Bury; but so little is known with      accuracy of Johannes Scotus Erigena, and his patron Charles      the Bald, King of France, or of the book tête-a-têtes they      used to have together--so little, also, of Nennius, Bede,      and Alfred [although the monasteries at this period, from      the evidence of Sir William Dugdale, in the first volume of      the Monasticon were \"opulently endowed,\"--inter alia, I      should hope, with magnificent MSS. on vellum, bound in      velvet, and embossed with gold and silver], or the      illustrious writers in the Norman period, and the fine books      which were in the abbey of Croyland--so little is known of      book-collectors, previously to the 14th century, that I      thought it the most prudent and safe way to begin with the      above excellent prelate.       RICHARD DE BURY was the friend and correspondent of      Petrarch; and is said by Mons. de Sade, in his Memoires pour      la vie de Petrarque, \"to have done in England what Petrarch      did all his life in France, Italy, and Germany, towards the      discovery of MSS. of the best ancient writers, and making      copies of them under his own superintendence.\" His passion      for book-collecting was unbounded [\"vir ardentis ingenii,\"      says Petrarch of him]; and in order to excite the same      ardour in his countrymen, or rather to propagate the disease      of the BIBLIOMANIA with all his might, he composed a      bibliographical work under the title of _Philobiblion_;      concerning the first edition of which, printed at Spires in      1483, Clement (tom. v. 142) has a long gossiping account;      and Morhof tells us that it is \"rarissima et in paucorum      manibus versatur.\" It was reprinted in Paris in 1500, 4to.,      by the elder Ascensius, and frequently in the subsequent      century, but the best editions of it are those by Goldastus      in 1674, 8vo., and Hummius in 1703. Morhof observes that,      \"however De Bury's work savours of the rudeness of the age,      it is rather elegantly written, and many things are well      said in it relating to Bibliothecism.\" _Polyhist. Literar._      vol. i. 187, edit. 1747.       For further particulars concerning De Bury, read Bale,      Wharton, Cave, and Godwin's Episcopal Biography. He left      behind him a fine library of MSS. which he bequeathed to      Durham, now Trinity, College, Oxford.       It may be worth the antiquary's notice, that, in consequence      (I suppose) of this amiable prelate's exertions, \"in every      convent was a noble library and a great: and every friar,      that had state in school, such as they be now, hath AN HUGH      LIBRARY.\" See the curious Sermon of the Archbishop of      Armagh, Nov. 8, 1387, in Trevisa's works among the _Harleian      MSS._ No. 1900. Whether these Friars, thus affected with      the frensy of book-collecting, ever visited the \"old      chapelle at the Est End of the church of S. Saink      [Berkshire], whither of late time resorted in pilgrimage      many folkes for the disease of _madness_,\" [see Leland's      _Itinerary_, vol. ii. 29, edit. 1770] I have not been able,      after the most diligent investigation, to ascertain.]       [Footnote 19: The British Museum contains a great number of      books which bear the royal stamp of Henry VII.'s arms. Some      of these printed by Verard, UPON VELLUM, are magnificent      memorials of a library, the dispersion of which is for ever      to be regretted. As Henry VIII. knew nothing of, and cared      less for, fine books, it is not very improbable that some of      the choicest volumes belonging to the late king were      presented to Cardinal Wolsey.]  During the reign of Henry VIII., I should suppose that the Earl of Surrey[20] and Sir Thomas Wyatt were a little attached to book-collecting; and that Dean Colet[21] and his friend Sir Thomas More and Erasmus were downright Bibliomaniacs. There can be little doubt but that neither the great LELAND[22] nor his Biographer Bale,[23] were able to escape the contagion; and that, in the ensuing period, Rogar [Transcriber's Note: Roger] Ascham became notorious for the Book-disease. He purchased probably, during his travels abroad[24] many a fine copy of the Greek and Latin Classics, from which he read to his illustrious pupils, Lady Jane Grey, and Queen Elizabeth: but whether he made use of an _Editio Princeps_, or a _Large paper copy_, I have hitherto not been"]]]
