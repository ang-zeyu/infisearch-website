We haven't said a dozen words that could have been heard the length of this room. 'Come in!'\"  The door opened to admit one of the numerous female house servants, who announced that there was a gentleman on the gallery who had called to see Mrs. Gray on very important private and particular business.  \"She looks innocent enough,\" thought Marcy, who could not bring himself to believe, as his mother evidently did, that some of the domestics were watching their movements and reporting the result of their observations to the overseer. \"I don't think she heard a word, and she certainly could not have seen anything.\" And then, finding that his mother was looking at him as if she meant him to understand that she knew what the visitor's business was, and desired him to take it off her hands, he said, aloud: \"Who is the gentleman, and do you know what he's got to say that is so very important and particular?\"  \"I don't know, sah, what he want to speak about,\" answered the girl, \"but de man is Mr. Kelsey.\"  Marcy could hardly keep back an exclamation of disgust, and in an instant he was on his guard. The man's name and the message he had sent in warned him to be on the lookout for treachery. Kelsey was one of Beardsley's \"renters\"--that is to say, he hired from the captain a few acres of ground, on which he managed to raise enough corn and potatoes to keep his family from absolute want, and a little log cabin in which he found shelter when he was not absent on his hunting and thieving expeditions. Marcy had not seen him since his return from Barrington, but he had heard of him as a red-hot Confederate who went about declaring that hanging was too good for Yankees and their sympathizers. When Marcy heard of this, he told himself that the man was another Bud Goble, who, when the pinch came, would take to the woods and stay there as long as danger threatened.  \"I'll be with him directly,\" he said, addressing himself to the girl, who went out, closing the door behind her.  \"What in the name of wonder can that worthless man want with me?\" whispered Mrs. Gray, when she thought she had given the domestic time to get out of hearing. \"He has never been in this house before except to beg.\"  \"And he wouldn't be here now if he hadn't been sent,\" replied the boy.  \"Oh, Marcy!\" said his mother.  \"That is just what I mean. It isn't old clothes or grub that he is after this time.\"  \"But Beardsley couldn't have put him up to anything. He is in Newbern.\"  \"No odds. He left plenty of friends behind to do his dirty work, and this fellow, Kelsey, is one of them. It will take a sharper man than he is to pull the wool over my eyes.\"  \"Don't be over-confident, my son. He is not too insignificant--no one is too insignificant these times to do us some terrible injury. Be careful how you treat him and what you say to him. It might be dangerous to make him angry, for he has powerful friends behind him. Don't be gone long, for I shall be uneasy until you return.\"  \"I'll be right back,\" promised Marcy; and, giving his mother a reassuring kiss, he left the room and went out on the porch to see what Beardsley's friend and spy wanted.  The latter looked just as he did the last time Marcy saw him--too lazy to take a long breath. He was tall and lank, his hair fell down upon his shoulders, his whiskers were as tangled and matted as a little brush heap--in short, he was as fine a specimen of a poor white as one could find anywhere in the seceded States. He looked stupid as well as shiftless, but the young pilot knew he wasn't. He was as sly as a fox and as cunning as well, and Marcy confessed to himself that he stood more in fear of him than he did of Captain Beardsley. When the man heard Marcy's step upon the porch, he tried to assume the servile air which was characteristic of poor Southern whites before the war; but he did not succeed very well. His manner seemed to say that he knew he was dealing with one he could crush whenever he felt like it, and of whom he need not stand in fear; and Marcy was quick to notice it.  \"Sarvent, sah,\" said Kelsey, rising to his feet and taking off his tattered hat, which, however, he almost instantly replaced. \"I heared that you had got back again from sea, an' that you had whopped the Yankees first time tryin', same as our fellers done down to Charleston.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Marcy, seating himself, and depositing his feet on the railing, as if to indicate that he was quite at the service of his friend Kelsey as long as the latter wanted to talk to him. \"We whipped them, and we could do the same thing again.\" [\"And that's nothing but the truth,\" he added, to himself. \"When an armed vessel meets one that's not armed, the helpless one is bound to go under every time.\"]  It is hard to tell just what Kelsey expected the boy to say in response to his greeting, but in spite of his usual self-control his face showed that he had not looked for any such answer as this. Marcy spoke and acted as if he were delighted with the success that had attended the _Osprey's_ first cruise at sea, and proud of being able to say that he was one of her crew.  \"You sent in word that you desired to see my mother on very particular business,\" continued Marcy. \"She doesn't feel like seeing anybody to-day--upset by the war news, you know--and I am here to speak for her. It's nothing bad, I hope?\"  Kelsey straightened up on his seat and assumed a business air, as if these words had suggested an idea to him.  \"Yes, it's kinder bad,\" said he. \"We uns know that you are true blue, fur if you wasn't you wouldn't be on that privateer; an' if your maw wasn't true blue, she wouldn't a let you go.\"  [\"That sounds exactly like Beardsley,\" said Marcy, to himself.] \"Well, what of it? Didn't I do my duty faithfully?\"  \"I ain't sayin' nothing agin that,\" replied the man hastily. \"But--you're fur Jeff Davis, ain't you?\"  Instead of answering in words, Marcy pulled down the corner of his right eye and looked at Kelsey as if to ask him if he saw anything green in it.  \"What do ye mean by them movements?\" demanded the visitor.  \"I mean that I am not going to talk politics with you,\" was the reply. \"This settlement is full of traitors, and I'm going to hold my tongue unless I know who I am talking to. If I do that, I shan't get into trouble by speaking too freely in the hearing of a Yankee spy.\"  \"But look a-here, Mister Marcy,\" protested Kelsey.  \"If you came to pry into our private affairs, you might as well jump on your mule and go home, for you'll not get a word from me. I ought to put the dogs on you, for if all I hear is true you're the worst kind of a traitor.\" [\"And so you are,\" thought Marcy, closely watching the effect of his words, although he did not seem to be doing so; \"you're a traitor to the old flag.\"]  The visitor was astonished beyond measure, and it was fully a minute before he could collect his wits sufficiently to frame a reply.                                   CHAPTER II.                             HIDING THE FLAGS.  \"I think I have taken the right course,\" soliloquized the young pilot, who mentally congratulated himself on the ease with which he had \"got to windward\" of this sneaking spy. \"If I fight him with his own weapons I shall probably get more out of him than I could in any other way.\"  \"You heared that I was a traitor?\" exclaimed Kelsey, as soon as he could speak. \"Mister Marcy, the man who told you that told you a plumb lie, kase I ain't. I whooped her up fur ole Car'liny when she went out, I done the same when our gov'ner grabbed the forts along the coast, an' I yelled fit to split when our folks licked 'em at Charleston. Any man in the settlement or in Nashville will tell ye that them words of mine is nothing but the gospel truth.\"  Marcy knew well enough that his visitor's words were true, but he shook his head in a doubting way, as he replied:  \"That may all be; but _I_ didn't hear you whoop and yell, and you must not expect me to take your word for it. You must bring some proof before I will talk to you.\"  \"Why, how in sense could ye hear me whoop an' yell, seein' that you was away to school in the first place, an' off on the ocean with Beardsley in the next?\" exclaimed Kelsey. \"Ask Dillon, an' Colonel Shelby, an' the postmaster, an' see if they don't say it's the truth.\"  \"You have mentioned the names of some of our most respected citizens,\" said Marcy slowly, as if he were still reluctant to be convinced of the man's sincerity. \"And if they, or any of them, sent you up here to talk to my mother--why, then, I shall have to listen to you; but mind you, if you are trying to play a game on me----\"  \"Mister Marcy,\" said Kelsey solemnly, \"I ain't tryin' to come no game. Them men done it sure's you're born.\"  \"Did what?\"  \"Sent me up here this mawnin'.\"  \"That's one point gained, but won't mother be frightened when she hears of it?\" thought Marcy, leaning his elbows on his knees and covering his face with his hands so that his visitor could not see it. \"Some of the best men in the country have so far forgotten their manhood, and the friendship they once had for our family, that they can send this sneaking fellow here to worm something out of us.\"  \"I don't believe a word of it,\" he cried, jumping to his feet and confronting his visitor.  \"Ye--ye don't believe it?\" faltered Kelsey, springing up in his turn. \"Well, I--I--look a-here, Mister Marcy, mebbe this is something else you don't believe. Them men whose names I jest give you, say that you an' your maw an' all the rest of the Gray family is Union. What do ye say to _that?_\"  \"I say that they had better attend to their own business and let me attend to mine,\" answered Marcy. \"Are Colonel Shelby and the rest of them for the Union?\"  \"Not much; an' nuther be I.\"  \"Are you in favor of secession?\"  \"I reckon.\" replied Kelsey earnestly; and Marcy knew all the while that he could not have told what the word secession meant.  \"Then why don't you prove it--you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29387"],["title","Marcy the Blockade Runner (#3)"],["body"," and Colonel Shelby, and the rest of the neighbors who are saying things behind my back that they don't care to say to my face? Why don't you prove your loyalty to the South by shouldering a musket and going into the army?\"  \"Why, we uns has got famblies to look out fur,\" exclaimed the visitor, who had never had this matter brought squarely home to him before.  \"That makes no difference,\" answered the boy, who wondered if Kelsey's family would fare any worse while he was in the army than they did now, while he was out of it. \"Every man in this country must show his good will in one way or another. And there's that loudmouthed fellow Allison, who went out of his way to insult me in the post-office just before I went to sea. Nashville is full of such braggarts as he is. When they can't find anything else to talk about they talk about me; and I have smelt powder while they haven't.\" [\"No odds if it was our own powder and the wind blew the smoke into my face,\" he said to himself.]  By this time Marcy had the satisfaction of seeing that he had taken the wind completely out of Kelsey's sails, and that the man who had come there to trouble him was troubled himself. He even began to fear that he had gone too far, and that if he did not change his tactics the visitor would go away without giving a hint of the errand that had brought him to the house; for Kelsey picked up the hat he had placed upon the floor beside his chair, put it on his head and leaned forward with his hands on his knees, as if he were about to get upon his feet. That wouldn't do at all. There was something in the wind--something that Captain Beardsley, aided by Colonel Shelby and others, had studied up on purpose to get Marcy into a scrape of some kind, and Marcy was very anxious to know what it was.  \"You hinted a while ago that Colonel Shelby had sent you here to tell me some bad news,\" said the young pilot, in a much pleasanter tone of voice than he had thus far used in addressing his visitor. \"Are you ready now to obey orders and tell me what it is?\"  \"Well, I dunno. I reckon mebbe I'd best ride down an' see the colonel first,\" replied the man. But his actions said plainly that he _did_ know, and that he had no intention of facing his employer again until he could tell him that his instructions had been carried out.  \"Of course, you must do as you think best about that; but if it is anything that concerns my mother or myself----\"  \"I should say so,\" exclaimed Kelsey. \"I don't reckon it'll do any harm to tell you--but ain't there anybody to listen? It's very important an' private.\"  \"I think you may speak with perfect freedom; but in order to make sure of it----\" Marcy finished the sentence by getting up and closing both the doors that opened upon the veranda. \"Now we're safe,\" said he; whereupon Kelsey revealed the whole plot in less than a score of words.  \"Mebbe you don't know it,\" said he, in a whisper which was so loud and piercing that it could have been heard by an eavesdropper (if there had been one) at least fifty feet away, \"but you are harboring a traitor right here on the place.\"  \"Who is it?\"  \"Your mean sneak of an overseer.\"  It was now Marcy's turn to be astonished. He knew that there was not a word of truth in what the man said, and that if the overseer really was a Union man the planters round about would have sent a person of more influence and better social standing than Kelsey to tell him of it; but after all the plot was not as simple as it looked at first glance.  \"Where's your proof?\" was the first question he asked.  \"Well, Hanson has been talkin' a heap to them he thought to be Union, but it turned out that they wasn't. They was true to the flag of the 'Federacy.\"  \"What do Colonel Shelby and the rest want me to do?\" inquired Marcy, catching at an idea that just then flashed through his mind. \"If they will write me a note stating the facts of the case and asking me to discharge Hanson, I will attend to it before the sun goes down.\"  \"Well, you see they don't keer to take a hand in the furse at all, seein' that there's so many Union folks in the settlement,\" said Kelsey. \"They've got nice houses an' nigger quarters, an' they don't want 'em burned up.\"  \"But they are willing that I should get into trouble by discharging Hanson, and put myself in the way of having my house and quarters destroyed, are they?\" exclaimed the boy, his face growing red with indignation, although, as he afterward told his mother, there wasn't really anything to arouse his indignation. \"You may tell those gentlemen that if they want the overseer run off the plantation, they can come here and do it. If the Union men are as vindictive as Colonel Shelby seems to think they are, I don't care to get them down on me.\"  \"But the Union folks won't pester you uns,\" said Kelsey, speaking before he thought.  \"Ah! Why won't they?\"  \"Kase--kase they think you're one of 'em.\"  \"I don't see how they can think so when they know that I belong to a Confederate privateer.\"  \"Them men, whose names I give ye a minute ago, thought that mebbe you'd be willing to turn Hanson loose when you heared how he had been swingin' his tongue about that there money.\"  Kelsey had come to the point at last. He looked hard at Marcy to see what effect the words would have upon him, and Marcy returned his gaze with an impassive countenance, although he felt his heart sinking within him.  \"What money?\" he demanded, in so steady a voice that the visitor was fairly staggered. The latter believed that there was rich booty hidden somewhere about that old house, and he hoped in time to have the handling of some of it.  \"I mean the money your maw got when she went to Richmon' an' around,\" replied the man, who, in coon hunters' parlance, began to wonder if he wasn't \"barking up the wrong tree.\"  \"Can you prove that she brought any money back with her?\"  \"No, I can't,\" answered Kelsey, in a tone which said as plainly as words that he wished he could. \"I--me--I mean that the neighbors suspicion it.\"  \"Oh, that's it. Let those officious neighbors keep on talking; and when they have talked themselves blind, you may tell them, for me, that what money we have is safe,\" said Marcy, with a good deal of emphasis on the adjective. \"If you want to see what mother brought back from the city, go and look at the servants. Every one of them is dressed in a new suit. Now go on and tell me the bad news. I'm getting impatient to hear it.\"  \"Heavings an' 'arth! Haven't I told it to ye already?\" Kelsey almost shouted. \"I think it is bad enough when you an' your maw are keepin', right here on the plantation, a man who is all the time waitin' an' watchin' fur a chance to do harm to both of ye. If you don't think so, all right. I was a fule fur comin' here, an' I reckon I'd best be lumberin'. If anything happens to ye, bear in mind that I give ye fair warnin'.\"  \"I will,\" answered Marcy. \"And in the mean time do you bear in mind that I am ready to discharge Hanson at any time Colonel Shelby proves to my satisfaction that he is a dangerous man to have around; but I shall make no move unless the colonel says so, for I don't want to get into trouble with my neighbors.\" [\"I wonder if I have done the right thing,\" thought Marcy, as the visitor mounted his mule and rode out of the yard. \"The next plotter I hear from will be Hanson himself.\"]  The boy remained motionless in his chair until Kelsey disappeared behind the trees that bordered the road, and then got up and walked into the sitting-room, where he found his mother pacing the floor. Her anxiety and her impatience to learn what it was that brought Kelsey to the house were so overpowering that she could not sit still.  \"Another plot to ruin us,\" whispered the boy, as he entered the room and closed the door behind him.  \"Oh, Marcy, it is just what I was afraid of,\" replied Mrs. Gray. \"Who is at the bottom of it this time?\"  \"The same old rascal, Lon Beardsley; but he's got backing I don't like. There's Colonel Shelby for one, the postmaster for another, and Major Dillon for a third.\"  \"The most influential men in the neighborhood,\" gasped Mrs. Gray, sinking into the nearest chair. \"And the best.\"  \"They used to be the best, but they are anything but that now. When men will stoop as low as they have, they are mean enough for anything. I suppose you ought to hear what that fellow said to me, but I don t know how I can tell it to you.\"  \"Go on,\" said his mother, trying to bear up bravely. \"I must hear every word.\"  Marcy knew that it was right and necessary that his mother should be kept fully informed regarding the plots that were laid against them, and that she should know what the planters were thinking and saying about her; for if she were kept in ignorance, she would be at a loss how to act and speak in a sudden emergency. She might be surprised into saying something in the presence of a secret enemy that would be utterly ruinous. So he drew a chair to her side and told her everything that had passed between Kelsey and himself. He did not try to smooth it over, but repeated the conversation word for word; and when he came to the end, his mother was as much in the dark as Marcy was himself. She said she couldn't understand it.  \"There are but two things about it that are plain to me,\" answered Marcy, \"perhaps three. One is that the house is watched by somebody, and that the neighbors knew I was at home almost as soon as you knew it yourself. Another is that the suspicions aroused in the minds of some of our watchful neighbors are so strong that they amount to positive conviction. They are as certain that there is money in this house as they would be if they had caught you in the act of hiding it.\"  \"Doesn't that prove that the overseer is not the only spy there is on the place?\" said Mrs. Gray. \"And I was so careful.\"  \"I never will believe that anybody watched you at night,\" said Marcy quickly. \"The neighbors saw you when you went away and came back.\"  \"But I"]]]
