Cummings (Monette to her friends) returns with another     hauntingly persuasive story of a Tomorrow that may not be as     gleaming as we hope. Her recent story, THE WEIRDIES, apparently     delighted some and startled others--and this in Los Angeles! What's     happening there?_         no     pets  allowed   _by M. A. CUMMINGS_    He didn't know how he could have stood the four months  there alone. She was company and one could talk to her ...   I can't tell anyone about it. In the first place, they'd never believe me. And, if they did, I'd probably be punished for having her. Because we aren't allowed to have pets of any kind.  It wouldn't have happened, if they hadn't sent me way out there to work. But, you see, there are so many things I can't do.  I remember the day the Chief of Vocation took me before the council.  \"I've tried him on a dozen things,\" he reported. People always talk about me as if I can't understand what they mean. But I'm really not _that_ dumb.  \"There doesn't seem to be a thing he can do,\" the Chief went on. \"Actually, his intelligence seems to be no greater than that which we believe our ancestors had, back in the twentieth century.\"  \"As bad as that?\" observed one of the council members. \"You do have a problem.\"  \"But we must find something for him to do,\" said another. \"We can't have an idle person in the State. It's unthinkable.\"  \"But what?\" asked the Chief. \"He's utterly incapable of running any of the machines. I've tried to teach him. The only things he can do, are already being done much better by robots.\"  There was a long silence, broken at last by one little, old council member.  \"I have it,\" he cried. \"The very thing. We'll make him guard of the Treasure.\"  \"But there's no need of a guard. No one will touch the Treasure without permission. We haven't had a dishonest person in the State for more than three thousand years.\"  \"That's it, exactly. There aren't any dishonest people, so there won't be anything for him to do. But we will have solved the problem of his idleness.\"  \"It might be a solution,\" said the Chief. \"At least, a temporary one. I suppose we will have to find something else later on. But this will give us time to look for something.\"  So I became guard of the Treasure. With a badge. And nothing to do--unless you count watching the Key. The gates were kept locked, just as they were in the old days, but the large Key hung beside them. Of course, no one wanted to bother carrying it around. It was too heavy. The only ones who ever used it, anyway, were members of the council. As the man said, we haven't had a dishonest person in the State for thousands of years. Even I know that much.  Of course, this left me with lots of time on my hands. That's how I happened to get her in the first place. I'd always wanted one, but pets were forbidden. Busy people didn't have time for them. So I knew I was breaking the Law. But I figured that no one would ever find out.  First I fixed a place for her, and made a brush screen, so that she couldn't be seen by anyone coming to the gates. Then, one night, I sneaked into the forest and got her.  It wasn't so lonely after that. Now I had something to talk to. She was small when I got her--it would be too dangerous to go near a full grown one--but she grew rapidly. That was because I caught small animals and brought them to her. Not having to depend on what she could catch, she grew almost twice as fast as usual, and was so sleek and pretty. Really, she was a pet to be proud of.  I don't know how I could have stood the four months there alone, if I hadn't her to talk to. I don't think she really understood me, but I pretended she did, and that helped.  Every three or four weeks, three of the council members came to take a part of the Treasure, or to add to it. Always three of them.  That's why I was so surprised one day, to see one man coming by himself. It was Gremm, the little old member, who had recommended that I be given this job. I was happy to see him, and we talked for a while, mostly about my work, and how I liked it. I almost told him about my pet, but I didn't, because he might be angry at me for breaking the Law.  Finally, he asked me to give him the Key.  \"I've been sent to get something from the Treasure,\" he explained.  I was unhappy to displease him, but I said, \"I can't let you have it. There must be three members. You know that.\"  \"Of course, I know it. But something came up suddenly, so they sent me alone. Now, let me have it.\"  I shook my head. That was the one order they had given me--never to give the Key to any one person who came alone.  Gremm became quite angry.  \"You idiot,\" he shouted. \"Why do you think I had you put out here? It was so I could get in there and help myself to the Treasure.\"  \"But that would be dishonest. And there are no dishonest people in the State.\"  \"For three thousand years. I know.\" His usually kind face had an ugly look I had never seen before. \"But I'm going to get part of that Treasure. And it won't do you any good to report it, because no one is going to take the word of a fool like you, against a respected council member. They'll think you are the dishonest one. Now, give me that Key!\"  It's a terrible thing to disobey a council member. But if I obeyed him, I would be disobeying all the others. And that would be worse.  \"No!\" I shouted.  He threw himself upon me. For his size and age, he was very strong--stronger, even, than I. I fought as hard as I could, but I knew I wouldn't be able to keep him away from the Key for very long. And if he took the Treasure, I would be blamed. The council would have to think a new punishment for dishonesty. Whatever it was, it would be terrible, indeed.  He drew back and rushed at me. Just as he hit me, my foot caught upon a root, and I fell. His rush carried him past me, and he crashed through the brush screen beside the path. I heard him scream twice, then there was silence.  I was bruised all over, but I managed to pull myself up and take away what was left of the screen. There was no sign of Gremm, but my beautiful pet was waving her pearl-green feelers as she always did in thanks for a good meal.  That's why I can't tell anyone what happened. No one would believe that Gremm would be dishonest. And I can't prove it, because she ate the proof.  Even if I did tell them, no one is going to believe that a fly-catcher plant--even a big one like mine--would actually be able to eat a man.  So they think that Gremm disappeared. And I'm still out here--with her. She's grown so much larger now, and more beautiful than ever.  But I hope she hasn't developed a taste for human flesh. Lately, when she stretches out her feelers, it seems that she's trying to reach me.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ August 1957.

RAYMOND HALL AND H. GORDON MONTAGUE   In the academic year of 1947-48 Montague studied the geographic variation in _Thomomys talpoides_ of Wyoming. His study was based upon materials then in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Publication of the results was purposely delayed until previously reported specimens from certain adjacent areas, especially in Colorado, could be examined. In the autumn of 1950 one of us, Hall, was able to examine the specimens from Colorado; also, the specimens from Wyoming accumulated in the past two seasons of field work in Wyoming were examined by Hall. A result of these studies is the recognition of two heretofore unnamed subspecies of the northern pocket gopher in southeastern Wyoming.  Grateful acknowledgment is made of the opportunity to study the Coloradon specimens in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, and of the financial assistance from the Kansas University Endowment Association which permitted the field work in Wyoming.  Descriptions and names for the two new subspecies are given below:   =Thomomys talpoides rostralis= new subspecies  _Type._--Female, adult, skull and skin, no. 17096 Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas; from 1 mi. E Laramie, 7164 ft., Albany County, Wyoming; obtained on July 16, 1945, by C. Howard Westman; original no. 320.  _Range._--Southern Wyoming and south in the mountains of Colorado to the Arkansas River but not including the Colorado River drainage except in Grand County and part of Routt County.  _Diagnosis._--Size medium (see measurements); upper parts ranging from between Cinnamon-Rufous and Hazel (capitalized terms are of Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature, Washington, D. C., 1912) in the eastern part of the range to between Argus Brown and Brussels Brown in the western part of the range; sides Cinnamon-Rufous; throat whitish; remainder of under-parts whitish, in many specimens tipped with Ochraceous-Buff; feet and tail whitish; rostrum long; nasals ordinarily truncate posteriorly; temporal ridges nearly parallel; interpterygoid space broadly V-shaped.  _Comparisons._--From _Thomomys talpoides clusius_ (topotypes), _T. t. rostralis_ differs in: Body longer; color more reddish (lighter with less brownish and more ochraceous); rostrum both longer and broader, actually and also in relation to length of the skull; skull broader interorbitally; upper molariform tooth-row longer; tympanic bullae less inflated. For comparison with _T. t. attenuatus_ to the east, see the account of that subspecies.  From _Thomomys talpoides macrotis_ (topotypes) to the southeast, _T. t. rostralis_ differs in: Body shorter; upper parts slightly more ochraceous and less grayish; skull averaging smaller in all measurements except that interorbital region is broader and rostrum and upper molariform tooth-row are longer; nasals truncate versus emarginate, and consistently shorter; basilar length consistently less in specimens of equal age; mastoidal breadth less in 16 of 17 specimens of _rostralis_; temporal ridges parallel instead of divergent posteriorly; exposed parts of upper incisors shorter; tympanic bullae more angular antero-laterally.  From _Thomomys talpoides fossor_ (specimens from Rico, Silverton, Hermit and Pagosa Springs, all in Colorado), the subspecies to the southward, _T. t. rostralis_ differs in: Longer body; lighter color of upper parts; nasals truncate rather than rounded posteriorly; temporal ridges more nearly parallel (less divergent posteriorly); rostrum longer (averaging longer and broader); skull wider across zygomatic arches in 11 of 12 specimens of _rostralis._  _Remarks._--Geographic variation is evident in the material examined. In the initial study, one of us, Montague, separated the material from the Medicine Bow Range in Wyoming as a subspecies different from that at Laramie and the adjoining mountains to the eastward because of the darker color of the western animals and the smaller size of males. Acquisition of more material from still farther west (Sierra Madre) in Wyoming and the examination of material in the United States Biological Surveys Collection from Colorado discloses that there is a cline of increasing intensity of color from the geographic range of _T. t. cheyennensis_ at Pine Bluffs, Wyoming, westward to the eastern side of the Sierra Madre at a locality three miles east and five miles north of Savery, Wyoming. A further deterrent to setting apart the animals of the Medicine Bow Mountains as a separate subspecies is the large size of males from the North Platte River Valley southeast of Saratoga. The males from the valley of the North Platte are intermediate in size between those from the Medicine Bow Mountains and those from the Laramie River Valley. Females from the same places are available in longer series and show less variation. If there is a difference in size in the females, those from the mountains are larger than those from lower elevations on either side.  The examination that one of us, Hall, has made of the related materials from Colorado reveals, as we supposed would be the case, that a large area formerly assigned to the geographic range of _Thomomys talpoides fossor_ is to be assigned to the geographic range of the newly named _Thomomys talpoides rostralis._ It should be added that, at this writing, the lack of ideally complete material from southwestern Colorado leaves some doubt as to the range of variation properly to be included within the geographic range of _T. t. fossor._ Consequently, study of a larger number of specimens from more localities in Colorado may show that the boundary between the geographic ranges of _T. t. fossor_ and _T. t. rostralis_ should be shifted from where we have tentatively placed it.  _Specimens examined._--Total number, 168. Unless otherwise indicated, those from Colorado are in the United States National Museum, Biological Surveys Collection, and those from Wyoming are in the Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas.  =Colorado.= _Routt Co._: Hahns Peak, 2; Hayden, 1. _Jackson Co._ Pearle, North Park, 9000 ft., 2; Canadian Creek, North Park, 6; 5 mi.
