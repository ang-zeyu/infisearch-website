Ayers's and Carlisle's batteries were there. I found the spring beyond a little hillock. While drinking, there was sudden confusion in Schenck's brigade. There was loud talking, cannon and musketry firing, and a sudden trampling of horses. A squadron of Rebel cavalry swept past within a few rods of the spring, charging upon Schenck's brigade. The panic tide had come rolling to the rear. Ayers lashed his horses to a gallop, to reach Cub Run bridge. He succeeded in crossing it. He came into position to open upon the Rebels and to check their pursuit. The road was blocked with wagons. Frightened teamsters cut their horses loose and rode away. Soldiers, officers, and civilians fled towards Centreville, frightened at they knew not what. Blenker's brigade was thrown forward from Centreville to the bridge, and the rout was stopped. The Rebels were too much exhausted, too much amazed at the sudden and unaccountable breaking and fleeing of McDowell's army, to improve the advantage. They followed to Cub Run bridge, but a few cannon and musket shots sent them back to the Stone Bridge.  But at Blackburn's Ford General Jones crossed the stream to attack the retreating troops. General Davies, with four regiments and Hunt's battery, occupied the crest of a hill looking down towards the ford. The Rebels marched through the woods upon the bank of the stream, wound along the hillside, filed through a farm-yard and halted in a hollow within a quarter of a mile of General Davies's guns.  [Illustration: FIGHT AT BLACKBURN'S FORD, July 21, 1863.       1 Blackburn's Ford.      2 Mitchell's Ford.      3 Rebel troops.      4 Davies's brigade and batteries.      5 Richardson's brigade.]  \"Lie down,\" said the General, and the four regiments dropped upon the ground. The six cannon and the gunners alone were in sight.  \"Wait till they come over the crest of the hill; wait till I give the word,\" said the General to Captain Hunt.  The men stand motionless by their pieces. The long column of Rebels moves on. There is an officer on his horse giving directions. The long dark line throws its lengthening shadows upward in the declining sunlight, toward the silent cannon.  \"Now let them have it!\" The guns are silent no longer. Six flashes of light, and six sulphurous clouds are belched towards the moving mass. Grape and canister sweep them down. The officer tumbles from his horse, and the horse staggers to the earth. There are sudden gaps in the ranks. They stop advancing. Officers run here and there. Another merciless storm,--another,--another. Eighteen flashes a minute from those six pieces! Like grass before the mower the Rebel line is cut down. The men flee to the woods, utterly routed.  The attempt to cut off the retreat signally failed. It was the last attempt of the Rebels to follow up their mysterious victory. The rear-guard remained in Centreville till morning recovering five cannon which had been abandoned at Cub Run, which the Rebels had not secured, and then retired to Arlington.  So the battle was won and lost. So the hopes of the Union soldiers changed to sudden, unaccountable fear, and so the fear of the Rebels became unbounded exultation.  The sun had gone down behind the Blue Mountains, and the battle-clouds hung thick and heavy along the winding stream where the conflict had raged. It was a sad night to us who had gone out with such high hopes, who had seen the victory so nearly won and so suddenly lost. Many of our wounded were lying where they had fallen. It was a terrible night to them. Their enemies, some of them, were hard-hearted and cruel. They fired into the hospitals upon helpless men. They refused them water to quench their burning thirst. They taunted them in their hour of triumph, and heaped upon them bitterest curses. They were wild with the delirium of success, and treated their prisoners with savage barbarity. Any one who showed kindness to the prisoners or wounded was looked upon with suspicion. Says an English officer in the Rebel service:--[4]  [Footnote 4: Estvan.]      \"I made it my duty to seek out and attend upon the wounded,     and the more so when I found that the work of alleviating     their sufferings was performed with evident reluctance and     want of zeal by many of those whose duty it was to do it. I     looked upon the poor fellows only as suffering     fellow-mortals, brothers in need of help, and made no     distinction between friend and foe; nay, I must own that I     was prompted to give the preference to the latter, for the     reason that some of our men met with attention from their     relations and friends, who had flocked to the field in     numbers to see them. But in doing so I had to encounter     opposition, and was even pointed at by some with muttered     curses as a traitor to the cause of the Confederacy for     bestowing any attention on the d---- Yankees.\"  Notwithstanding the inhuman treatment they received at the hands of their captors, there were men on that field who never quailed,--men with patriotism so fervent, deep, and unquenchable, that they lay down cheerfully to their death-sleep. This officer in the Rebel service went out upon the field where the fight had been thickest. It was night. Around him were the dying and the dead. There was a young Union officer, with both feet crushed by a cannon-shot. There were tears upon his cheeks.  \"Courage, comrade!\" said the officer, bending over him; \"the day will come when you will remember this battle as one of the things of the past.\"  \"Do not give me false hopes, sir. It is all up with me. I do not grieve that I must die, for with these stumps I shall not live long.\"  He pointed to his mangled feet, and added: \"_I weep for my poor, distracted country. Had I a second life to live, I would willingly sacrifice it for the cause of the Union!_\"  His eyes closed. A smile lighted his countenance, as if, while on the border of another world, he saw once more those who were dearest on earth or in heaven. He raised himself convulsively, and cried, \"Mother! Father!\"  He was dead.  He sleeps upon the spot where he fell. His name is unknown, but his devotion to his country shall shine forevermore like a star in heaven!  When the Union line gave way, some of the soldiers were so stupefied by the sudden change that they were unable to move, and were taken prisoners. Among them was a Zouave, in red trousers. He was a tall, noble fellow. Although a prisoner, he walked erect, unabashed by his captivity. A Virginian taunted him, and called him by hard names.  \"Sir,\" said the Zouave, \"I have heard that yours was a nation of gentlemen, but your insult comes from a coward and a knave. I am your prisoner, but you have no right to fling your curses at me because I am unfortunate. Of the two, I consider myself the gentleman.\"[5]  [Footnote 5: Charleston Mercury.]  The Virginian hung his head in silence, while other Rebel soldiers assured the brave fellow that he should not again be insulted. So bravery, true courage, and manliness will win respect even from enemies.  No accurate reports have been made of the number of men killed and wounded in this battle; but each side lost probably from fifteen hundred to two thousand men.  It was a battle which will always have a memorable place in the history of this Rebellion, because having won a victory, the slaveholders believed that they could conquer the North. They became more proud and insolent. They manifested their terrible hate by their inhuman treatment of the prisoners captured. They gave the dead indecent burial. The Rebel soldiers dug up the bones of the dead Union men, and carved them into ornaments, which they sent home to their wives and sweethearts. One girl wrote to her lover to \"be sure and bring her Old Lincoln's _skelp_\" (scalp), so that the women as well as the men became fierce in their hatred. I have seen the letter, which was found upon a prisoner.  The North, although defeated, was not discouraged. There was no thought of giving up the contest, but, as you remember, there was a great uprising of the people, who determined that the war should go on till the Rebellion was crushed.     CHAPTER IV.  THE CAPTURE OF FORT HENRY.   Tennessee joined the Southern Confederacy, but Kentucky resisted all the coaxing, threatening, and planning of the leaders of the Rebellion. Some Kentuckians talked of remaining neutral, of taking no part in the great contest; but that was not possible. The Rebels invaded the State, by sailing up the Mississippi and taking possession of Columbus,--a town twenty miles below the mouth of the Ohio. They also advanced from Nashville to Bowling Green. Then the State decided for the Union,--to stand by the old flag till the Rebellion should be crushed.  The Rebels erected two forts on the northern line of Tennessee. Looking at your map, you see that the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers are near together where they enter the State of Kentucky. They are not more than twelve miles apart. The fort on the Tennessee River was named Fort Henry, the one on the Cumberland, Fort Donelson. A good road was cut through the woods between them, so that troops and supplies could be readily removed from one to the other. Fort Henry was on the eastern bank of the Tennessee, and Fort Donelson on the western bank of the Cumberland. They were very important places to the Rebels, for at high water in the winter the rivers are navigable for the largest steamboats,--the Cumberland to Nashville and the Tennessee to Florence, in Northern Alabama,--and it would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28572"],["title","Letters on an Elk Hunt (#0)"],["body","ON AN ELK HUNT   BY A   WOMAN HOMESTEADER   _Elinore Pruitt Stewart_   UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA PRESS  Lincoln and London      Copyright, 1915, by Elinore Pruitt Stewart   All rights reserved   Copyright © renewed 1943 by H C Stewart   First Bison Book Printing 1979   Most recent printing indicated by first digit below                                        7 8 9 10   Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data   Stewart, Elinore Pruitt, 1878-- Letters on an elk hunt     1 Stewart, Elinore Pruitt, 1878-- 2 Frontier and pioneer  life--Wyoming  3 Elk   hunting--Wyoming  4 Pioneers--Wyoming--Biography  5 Wyoming--Biography I  Title   F761 S82 1979 978 7'03'0924 79-13840   ISBN 0-8032-4112-7   ISBN 0-8032-9112-4 pbk   Published by arrangement  with Houghton Mifflin Company   Manufactured in the United States of America     [Illustration: _Photograph courtesy of Clyde Stewart_]      CONTENTS       I.

CONEY,--  Your letter of the 4th just to hand. How glad your letters make me; how glad I am to have you to tell little things to.  I intended to write you as soon as I came back from Green River, to tell you of a girl I saw there; but there was a heap to do and I kept putting it off. I have described the desert so often that I am afraid I will tire you, so I will leave that out and tell you that we arrived in town rather late. The help at the hotel were having their supper in the regular dining-room, as all the guests were out. They cheerfully left their own meal to place ours on the table.  One of them interested me especially. She was a small person; I couldn't decide whether she was a child or a woman. I kept thinking her homely, and then when she spoke I forgot everything but the music of her voice,--it was so restful, so rich and mellow in tone, and she seemed so small for such a splendid voice. Somehow I kept expecting her to squeak like a mouse, but every word she spoke charmed me. Before the meal was over it came out that she was the dish-washer. All the rest of the help had finished their work for the day, but she, of course, had to wash what dishes we had been using.  The rest went their ways; and as our own tardiness had belated her, I offered to help her to carry out the dishes. It was the work of only a moment to dry them, so I did that. She was so small that she had to stand on a box in order to be comfortable while she washed the cups and plates.  \"The sink and drain-board were made for real folks. I have to use this box to stand on, or else the water runs back down my sleeves,\" she told me.  My room was upstairs; she helped me up with the children. She said her name was Connie Willis, that she was the only one of her \"ma's first man's\" children; but ma married again after pa died and there were a lot of the second batch. When the mother died she left a baby only a few hours old. As Connie was older than the other children she took charge of the household and of the tiny little baby.  I just wish you could have seen her face light up when she spoke of little Lennie.  \"Lennie is eight years old now, and she is just as smart as the smartest and as pretty as a doll. All the Ford children are pretty, and smart, too. I am the only homely child ma had. It would do you good just to look at any of the rest, 'specially Lennie.\"  It certainly did me good to listen to Connie,--her brave patience was so inspiring. As long as I was in town she came every day when her work was finished to talk to me about Lennie. For herself she had no ambition. Her clothes were clean, but they were odds and ends that had served their day for other possessors; her shoes were not mates, and one was larger than the other. She said: \"I thought it was a streak of luck when I found the cook always wore out her right shoe first and the dining-room girl the left, because, you see, I could have their old ones and that would save two dollars toward what I am saving up for. But it wasn't so very lucky after all except for the fun, because the cook wears low heels and has a much larger foot than the dining-room girl, who wears high heels. But I chopped the long heel off with the cleaver, and these shoes have saved me enough to buy Lennie a pair of patent-leather slippers to wear on the Fourth of July.\"  I thought that a foolish ambition, but succeeding conversations made me ashamed of the thought.  I asked her if Lennie's father couldn't take care of her.  \"Oh,\" she said, \"Pa Ford is a good man. He has a good heart, but there's so many of them that it is all he can do to rustle what must be had. Why,\" she told me in a burst of confidence, \"I've been saving up for a tombstone for ma for twelve years, but I have to help pa once in a while, and I sometimes think I never will get enough money saved. It is kind of hard on three dollars a week, and then I'm kind of extravagant at times. I have wanted a doll, a beautiful one, all my days. Last Christmas I got it--for Lennie. And then I like to carry out other folks' wishes sometimes. That is what I am fixing to do now. Ma always wanted to see me dressed up real pretty just once, but we were always too poor, and now I'm too old. But I can fix Lennie, and this Fourth of July I am going to put all the beauty on her that ma would have liked to see on me. They always celebrate that day at Manila, Utah, where pa lives. I'll go out and take the things. Then if ma is where she can see, she'll see _one_ of her girls dressed for once.\"  \"But aren't you mistaken when you say you have been saving for your mother's tombstone for twelve years? She's only been dead eight.\"  \"Why no, I'm not. You see, at first it wasn't a tombstone but a marble-top dresser. Ma had always wanted one so badly; for she always thought that housekeeping would be so much easier if she had just one pretty thing to keep house toward. If I had not been so selfish, she could have had the dresser before she died. I had fifteen dollars,--enough to buy it,--but when I came to look in the catalogue to choose one I found that for fifteen dollars more I could get a whole set. I thought how proud ma would be of a new bedstead and wash-stand, so I set in to earn that much more. But before I could get that saved up ma just got tired of living, waiting, and doing without. She never caused any trouble while she lived, and she died the same way.  \"They sent for me to come home from the place where I was at work. I had just got home, and I was standing by the bed holding ma's hand, when she smiled up at me; she handed me Lennie and then turned over and sighed so contented. That was all there was to it. She was done with hard times.  \"Pa Ford wanted to buy her coffin on credit,--to go in debt for it,--but I hated for ma to have to go on that way even after she was dead; so I persuaded him to use what money he had to buy the coffin, and I put in all I had, too. So the coffin she lies in is her own. We don't owe for _that_. Then I stayed at home and kept house and cared for Lennie until she was four years old. I have been washing dishes in this hotel ever since.\"  That is Connie's story. After she told me, I went to the landlady and suggested that we help a little with Lennie's finery; but she told me to \"keep out.\" \"I doubt if Connie would accept any help from us, and if she did, every cent we put in would take that much from her pleasure. There have not been many happy days in her life, but the Fourth of July will be one if we keep out.\" So I kept out.  I was delighted when Mrs. Pearson invited me to accompany her to Manila to witness the bucking contest on the Fourth. Manila is a pretty little town, situated in Lucerne Valley. All the houses in town are the homes of ranchers, whose farms may be seen from any doorstep in Manila. The valley lies between a high wall of red sandstone and the \"hogback,\"--that is what the foothills are called. The wall of sandstone is many miles in length. The valley presents a beautiful picture as you go eastward; at this time of the year the alfalfa is so green. Each farm joins another. Each has a cabin in which the rancher lives while they irrigate and make hay. When that is finished they move into their houses in \"town.\" Beyond the hogback rise huge mountains, rugged cañons, and noisy mountain streams; great forests of pine help to make up the picture. Looking toward the east we could see where mighty Green River cuts its way through walls of granite. The road lies close up against the sandstone and cedar hills and along the canal that carries the water to all the farms in the valley. I enjoyed every moment. It was all so beautiful,--the red rock, the green fields, the warm brown sand of the road and bare places, the mighty mountains, the rugged cedars and sage-brush spicing the warm air, the blue distance and the fleecy clouds. Oh, I wish I could paint it for you! In the foreground there should be some cows being driven home by a barefooted boy with a gun on his shoulder and a limp brown rabbit in his hand. But I shall have to leave that to your imagination and move on to the Fourth.  On that day every one turns out; even from the very farthest"]]]
