Did you hear him bid me give      His message?  Did you hear my promise?  I,      And only I, see Mildred.       GUENDOLEN.                She will die.       TRESHAM.  Oh no, she will not die!  I dare not hope      She'll die.  What ground have you to think she'll die?      Why, Austin's with you!       AUSTIN.                  Had we but arrived      Before you fought!       TRESHAM.            There was no fight at all.      He let me slaughter him--the boy!  I'll trust      The body there to you and Gerard--thus!      Now bear him on before me.       AUSTIN.                     Whither bear him?       TRESHAM.  Oh, to my chamber!  When we meet there next,      We shall be friends.           [They bear out the body of MERTOUN.]                            Will she die, Guendolen?       GUENDOLEN.  Where are you taking me?       TRESHAM.                              He fell just here.      Now answer me.  Shall you in your whole life      --You who have nought to do with Mertoun's fate,      Now you have seen his breast upon the turf,      Shall you e'er walk this way if you can help?      When you and Austin wander arm-in-arm      Through our ancestral grounds, will not a shade      Be ever on the meadow and the waste--      Another kind of shade than when the night      Shuts the woodside with all its whispers up?      But will you ever so forget his breast      As carelessly to cross this bloody turf      Under the black yew avenue?  That's well!      You turn your head:  and I then?--       GUENDOLEN.                          What is done      Is done.  My care is for the living.  Thorold,      Bear up against this burden:  more remains      To set the neck to!       TRESHAM.             Dear and ancient trees      My fathers planted, and I loved so well!      What have I done that, like some fabled crime      Of yore, lets loose a Fury leading thus      Her miserable dance amidst you all?      Oh, never more for me shall winds intone      With all your tops a vast antiphony,      Demanding and responding in God's praise!      Hers ye are now, not mine!  Farewell--farewell!             SCENE II.--MILDRED'S Chamber           MILDRED alone       He comes not!  I have heard of those who seemed      Resourceless in prosperity,--you thought      Sorrow might slay them when she listed; yet      Did they so gather up their diffused strength      At her first menace, that they bade her strike,      And stood and laughed her subtlest skill to scorn.      Oh, 'tis not so with me!  The first woe fell,      And the rest fall upon it, not on me:      Else should I bear that Henry comes not?--fails      Just this first night out of so many nights?      Loving is done with.  Were he sitting now,      As so few hours since, on that seat, we'd love      No more--contrive no thousand happy ways      To hide love from the loveless, any more.      I think I might have urged some little point      In my defence, to Thorold; he was breathless      For the least hint of a defence:  but no,      The first shame over, all that would might fall.      No Henry!  Yet I merely sit and think      The morn's deed o'er and o'er.  I must have crept      Out of myself.  A Mildred that has lost      Her lover--oh, I dare not look upon      Such woe!  I crouch away from it!  'Tis she,      Mildred, will break her heart, not I!  The world      Forsakes me:  only Henry's left me--left?      When I have lost him, for he does not come,      And I sit stupidly... Oh Heaven, break up      This worse than anguish, this mad apathy,      By any means or any messenger!       TRESHAM [without].  Mildred!       MILDRED.                      Come in!  Heaven hears me!           [Enter TRESHAM.]                                                                You? alone?      Oh, no more cursing!       TRESHAM.              Mildred, I must sit.      There--you sit!       MILDRED.         Say it, Thorold--do not look      The curse! deliver all you come to say!      What must become of me?  Oh, speak that thought      Which makes your brow and cheeks so pale!       TRESHAM.                                   My thought?       MILDRED.  All of it!       TRESHAM.              How we waded years--ago--      After those water-lilies, till the plash,      I know not how, surprised us; and you dared      Neither advance nor turn back:  so, we stood      Laughing and crying until Gerard came--      Once safe upon the turf, the loudest too,      For once more reaching the relinquished prize!      How idle thoughts are, some men's, dying men's!      Mildred,--       MILDRED.  You call me kindlier by my name      Than even yesterday:  what is in that?       TRESHAM.  It weighs so much upon my mind that I      This morning took an office not my own!      I might... of course, I must be glad or grieved,      Content or not, at every little thing      That touches you.  I may with a wrung heart      Even reprove you, Mildred; I did more:      Will you forgive me?       MILDRED.              Thorold? do you mock?      Oh no... and yet you bid me... say that word!       TRESHAM.  Forgive me, Mildred!--are you silent, Sweet?       MILDRED [starting up].  Why does not Henry Mertoun come to-night?      Are you, too, silent?           [Dashing his mantle aside, and pointing to his scabbard,            which is empty.]                             Ah, this speaks for you!      You've murdered Henry Mertoun!  Now proceed!      What is it I must pardon?  This and all?      Well, I do pardon you--I think I do.      Thorold, how very wretched you must be!       TRESHAM.  He bade me tell you...       MILDRED.                          What I do forbid      Your utterance of!  So much that you may tell      And will not--how you murdered him... but, no!      You'll tell me that he loved me, never more      Than bleeding out his life there:  must I say      \"Indeed,\" to that?  Enough!  I pardon you.       TRESHAM.  You cannot, Mildred! for the harsh words, yes:      Of this last deed Another's judge:  whose doom      I wait in doubt, despondency and fear.       MILDRED.  Oh, true!  There's nought for me to pardon!  True!      You loose my soul of all its cares at once.      Death makes me sure of him for ever!  You      Tell me his last words?  He shall tell me them,      And take my answer--not in words, but reading      Himself the heart I had to read him late,      Which death...       TRESHAM.        Death?  You are dying too?  Well said      Of Guendolen!  I dared not hope you'd die:      But she was sure of it.       MILDRED.                 Tell Guendolen      I loved her, and tell Austin...       TRESHAM.                         Him you loved:      And me?       MILDRED.  Ah, Thorold!  Was't not rashly done      To quench that blood, on fire with youth and hope      And love of me--whom you loved too, and yet      Suffered to sit here waiting his approach      While you were slaying him?  Oh, doubtlessly      You let him speak his poor confused boy's-speech      --Do his poor utmost to disarm your wrath      And respite me!--you let him try to give      The story of our love and ignorance,      And the brief madness and the long despair--      You let him plead all this, because your code      Of honour bids you hear before you strike:      But at the end, as he looked up for life      Into your eyes--you struck him down!       TRESHAM.                              No!  No!      Had I but heard him--had I let him speak      Half the truth--less--had I looked long on him      I had desisted!  Why, as he lay there,      The moon on his flushed cheek, I gathered all      The story ere he told it:  I saw through      The troubled surface of his crime and yours      A depth of purity immovable,      Had I but glanced, where all seemed turbidest      Had gleamed some inlet to the calm beneath;      I would not glance:  my punishment's at hand.      There, Mildred, is the truth! and you--say on--      You curse me?       MILDRED.       As I dare approach that Heaven      Which has not bade a living thing despair,      Which needs no code to keep its grace from stain,      But bids the vilest worm that turns on it      Desist and be forgiven,--I--forgive not,      But bless you, Thorold, from my soul of souls!           [Falls on his neck.]      There!  Do not think too much upon the past!      The cloud that's broke was all the same a cloud      While it stood up between my friend and you;      You hurt him 'neath its shadow:  but is that      So past retrieve?  I have his heart, you know;      I may dispose of it:  I give it you!      It loves you as mine loves!  Confirm me, Henry!           [Dies.]       TRESHAM.  I wish thee joy, Beloved!  I am glad      In thy full gladness!       GUENDOLEN [without].  Mildred!  Tresham!           [Entering with AUSTIN.]                                                Thorold,      I could desist no longer.  Ah, she swoons!      That's well.       TRESHAM.       Oh, better far than that!       GUENDOLEN.                                She's dead!      Let me unlock her arms!       TRESHAM.                 She threw them thus      About my neck, and blessed me, and then died:      You'll let them stay now, Guendolen!       AUSTIN.                               Leave her      And look to him!  What ails you, Thorold?       GUENDOLEN.                                 White      As she, and whiter!  Austin! quick--this side!       AUSTIN.  A froth is oozing through his clenched teeth;      Both lips, where they're not bitten through, are black:      Speak, dearest Thorold!       TRESHAM.  Something does weigh down      My neck beside her weight:  thanks:  I should fall      But for you, Austin, I believe!--there, there,      'Twill pass away soon!--ah,--I had forgotten:      I am dying.       GUENDOLEN.  Thorold--Thorold--why was this?       TRESHAM.  I said, just as I drank the poison "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2880"],["title","A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (#8)"],["body","off,      The earth would be no longer earth to me,      The life out of all life was gone from me.
