Now, sprinkle the lobster with a little salt, red pepper and a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar. Allow it to stand for a few minutes, and then sprinkle over two or three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. As soon as the butter has chilled on the lobster, put a goodly layer over a slice of buttered bread; cover with another slice of bread; press the two together, and remove the crusts. Remember, there is only one layer of lobster between two slices of bread.   Lobster Salad Sandwiches  Cut fine the solid portion from one boiled lobster, put it into a bowl, dust it lightly with salt and pepper and sprinkle over two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Make a half cupful of mayonnaise from the yolk of one egg and eight tablespoonfuls of olive oil. Select crisp lettuce leaves. Mix the mayonnaise with the lobster, put a thin layer over a slice of buttered bread, cover with a lettuce leaf, put another thin layer of lobster on top of the lettuce leaf, then a second slice of buttered bread. Press firmly together, cut off the crusts and cut the slices into halves long ways, or you may make it into three fingers.   Mutton Sandwiches  Chop a half pound of cold, cooked mutton very fine; add two tablespoonfuls of cream or olive oil, a tablespoonful of capers, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper; mix thoroughly. Butter the slices on the loaf; cut them one-half inch thick, and trim off the crusts. Spread thickly with the mixture; put at each of the four corners a mint leaf; put on top another slice of buttered bread, from which you have trimmed the crust, press the two together, and cut from corner to corner making four triangles.  These sandwiches may also be flavored with tomato catsup.   Mutton Club Sandwiches  Cut brown bread into rounds or circles with an ordinary cake cutter. Chop one-half pound of cold, boiled mutton rather fine; add two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of paprika. Peel four or five quite solid tomatoes, cut them into slices and push out the seeds. Put a slice of tomato on top of a round of bread, fill the space from which you have taken the seeds with the mutton mixture; put on top another round of buttered bread, and press the two together. You may, if you like, put on top of the tomato a lettuce leaf, and in the center of that half a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing. Nice for luncheon on a warm day.   English Mutton Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold boiled mutton to make a pint. Add to it two tablespoonfuls of capers, a half teaspoonful of salt, six tablespoonfuls of cream or olive oil and a saltspoonful of pepper. Mash carefully and put between layers of buttered bread; trim the crusts and cut into triangles.   Spring Lamb Sandwiches  Grind sufficient lamb to make a half pint, putting through the meat grinder with the lamb the leaves from six stalks of mint. Add a half teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter or cream, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Rub this to a paste and spread between toasted English muffins. Leaves of mint may be put over the top of the lamb before putting the muffins together.   Turkish Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold roasted mutton to make a pint; add two solid tomatoes from a can of tomatoes, or two fresh tomatoes, peeled, the seeds pressed out and the flesh chopped fine. Add a half cupful of piñons or pine nuts, and sufficient olive oil to bind the whole together. Spread this between thin, warm milk or beaten biscuits and serve for afternoon tea or supper.   Picnic Sandwiches  Take the ordinary French rolls; make a round opening in the top of each, and then, with your finger, scoop out all the crumb, leaving the roll in shape with a very small opening on top. Save the little piece of crust from the top of the opening. Mix together four olives, one gherkin, a tablespoonful of capers and one large green, sweet pepper, chopped very fine. Chop fine two ounces of tongue, and mix it with the white meat of one chicken, chopped fine. Mix together, and moisten with a well-made mayonnaise dressing. Fill this into the roll, put on the top, and arrange neatly on a napkin in a wicker basket; serve at once. The rolls may be prepared and the mixture made some time before serving, but the two should be put together at the last moment.   Potato Sandwiches  Mash four good-sized boiled potatoes; add a level teaspoonful of salt, four tablespoonfuls of thick cream, and the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs rubbed to a smooth paste, a saltspoonful of pepper, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil; mix thoroughly until you have a perfectly smooth paste. Put this between slices of brown bread and butter, trim off the crusts, and cut into triangles. The top may be garnished with cress or lettuce.   Salad Sandwiches  Chop fine half a pound of cold, cooked chicken; mix with it six tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise dressing; add half a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper; put this between slices of bread and butter, and cut into fancy shapes.  These sandwiches may also be trimmed with lettuce or cress, and almost any meat may be substituted for the chicken. If beef is used, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup may be added; with mutton a tablespoonful of capers. Beef is much better garnished with cress, mutton with mint, chicken with lettuce or celery.  Lobsters and crabs may be mixed with mayonnaise and used as a salad sandwich; garnish of course with lettuce.   Fish Salad Sandwiches  Flake one can of salmon, or an equal quantity of cold boiled fish. Add to it a half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne and one ordinary cucumber, grated and drained. Just before serving time butter the bread, cut it into thin slices, put over the top a layer of the flaked fish, then a thin layer of mayonnaise or sandwich dressing and another covering of bread. Press together, trim the crusts and cut directly across the slice, making two long sandwiches about an inch and a half to two inches wide.   Sardine Salad Sandwiches  These, like salmon sandwiches, are made from materials usually in every household, and can be made at a moment's notice. Stir four tablespoonfuls of oil into an egg, add a few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. Remove the sardines from the oil, take off the tails and heads and remove the bones. Mash them in a bowl, add a tablespoonful of vinegar, or the same amount of lemon juice. If you have lettuce or cress, either shred it, or put one leaf between the fish and the buttered bread.   Sardine Sandwiches  Cut slices of bread about one-half an inch thick, butter and toast; trim off the crust. Remove skin and bones from the sardines, lay them carefully over toast; have ready, chopped very fine, some olives and capers, mixed together; sprinkle these over the sardines, then a teaspoonful of lemon juice to each sandwich. Cut into any shape you may desire and they are ready to serve.   Swiss Sandwiches  Put half a pound of ordinary schmierkase into a bowl, rub it perfectly smooth; add, a teaspoonful at a time, four tablespoonfuls of thick cream, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Butter the slices of bread on the loaf; cut each off about a half inch in thickness, trim off the crusts and spread with the cheese mixture; put on top a layer of pumpernickel or rye bread; on top of that another thin layer of cheese, and on top of that another layer of white bread and butter; press these lightly together. If the crusts have been trimmed off, cut the slices into three or four finger shaped sandwiches. They should be the length of the slice and about one inch wide. These are exceedingly nice garnished with cress.  In arranging them for serving, put a layer of sandwiches and a layer of cress all through the basket or dish.   Tongue Sandwiches  Chop cold boiled tongue very fine. To each cupful stir in two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dash of red pepper and about one-half teaspoonful of onion juice. Have bread sufficiently stale to cut nicely. Remove end crust, butter and cut a very thin slice; remove the crusts. Spread it with the tongue paste, roll each sandwich carefully, tie with narrow ribbon and put away until wanted. These can be made several hours before serving.   Sandwich Dressing  Put four tablespoonfuls of vinegar and three of water into a saucepan over the fire; add a half teaspoonful of salt and a half saltspoonful of pepper. Beat the yolks of four eggs until creamy, add slowly to them the hot mixture. Stir over hot water until it is the consistency of mayonnaise dressing. Take from the fire and add carefully two level tablespoonfuls of butter.   Farmer's Sandwiches  Butter each slice on the loaf, slice it off very thin. Remove the crusts, lay a crisp lettuce leaf on one half the buttered slices, spread with sandwich dressing and cover with a slice of buttered bread. Press the two together and cut into triangles. Cress, Romaine, or bleached chicory may be used in place of lettuce. These are more appetizing than ordinary bread and butter sandwiches, and are made from materials found in every household.   Farmer's Egg Sandwiches  Put six eggs into warm water, bring to a boil and keep at boiling point, without boiling hard, for a half hour. Throw them into cold water, remove the shells and cut them into slices lengthwise. A very fine wire is best for cutting eggs. Butter the slices on the loaf, then cut them off, cover with slices of hard-boiled eggs, dust lightly with salt and pepper. Spread the eggs carefully with sandwich dressing, put on another slice of buttered bread, press the two together and cut into triangles. If you have lettuce or cress put a leaf over the dressing.   Deviled Beef Sandwiches  Chop remains of cold cooked beef very fine. To each pint add one tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a dash of cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a half teaspoonful of paprika"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],["title","Sandwiches (#5)"],["body"," a tablespoonful of onion juice. Rub to a paste and put between thin slices of buttered bread, trim off the crusts and cut into triangles.   Corned Beef Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold cooked corned beef to make a pint. Add to it a teaspoonful of horseradish, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil and four or five tablespoonfuls of finely-shredded water cress. Put this between slices of buttered whole wheat or brown bread; trim the crusts and cut into triangles.   Plain Corned Beef Sandwiches  Butter an equal quantity of white and whole wheat bread. Cut the cooked corned beef into very thin slices. Put a slice on a slice of buttered bread, put on top a teaspoonful of creamed horseradish sauce, spread it out, cover with cress leaves, or crisp lettuce leaf, put on a slice of whole wheat bread, press the two together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers about one inch wide.  To make the creamed horseradish sauce, stir thick, dry whipped cream into dry horseradish. If the horseradish is in vinegar, press out the vinegar and then fold in the whipped cream.   Sandwiches à la Stanley  Cut cold beef loaf or roll into very thin slices. Bake three or four bananas, and make a creamed horseradish sauce according to preceding recipe. Butter white or whole wheat bread, put on first a slice of meat, then just a thin layer of the mashed baked banana, then a teaspoonful of horseradish sauce, and another slice of bread. Press together, trim the crusts, cut into triangles and serve. These sandwiches should be served soon after they are made.   English Salt-Beef Sandwiches  Whip a half cupful of cream until it is very stiff. Put four tablespoonfuls of freshly grated horseradish or horseradish pressed free from vinegar into a bowl, add the yolk of an egg and a saltspoonful of salt; mix and fold in the whipped cream. Have ready very thin slices of cold boiled salt beef. Butter thin slices of bread, put on a layer of salt beef, then a thin layer of the horseradish sauce and another layer of buttered bread. Press together, trim the crusts and cut into triangles.   Sandwiches à la Bernhardt  Chop sufficient very rare cold roasted beef to make a half pint; mix with it a dash of cayenne, a half teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a tablespoonful of mango chutney, two shallots, a half clove of garlic and a tablespoonful of olive oil. Spread this on a thin slice of buttered brown bread, cover it with leaves of cress, and then put on another thin slice of buttered white bread. Press the two together, cut into crescents or triangles.   East Indian Lentil Sandwiches  Take any left-over boiled or stewed lentils and press them through a sieve. To each half cupful of this mixture add a half cupful of chopped pecans, a level teaspoonful of curry and a saltspoonful of salt. Spread thin slices of brown bread with butter, then put over a thick layer of this mixture and cover with chopped parsley. Cover with another layer of brown bread, press together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.   Nut-Butter Sandwiches  Mix one glass of nut butter with two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and one tablespoonful of chopped pimientos. Spread this on a slice of unbuttered brown bread, cover with finely-chopped cress or shredded lettuce, place on top a slice of buttered bread, press the two together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers an inch wide.   Filipino Sandwiches  Add one grated pineapple to a tumbler of peanut butter, mix thoroughly, add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, a dash of cayenne, a half teaspoonful of paprika. Put this between thin slices of brown bread, buttered; press together and cut into halves.     SWEET SANDWICHES   Under this heading we place all those dainty sandwiches that are made from thin slices of bread and butter and a jam or fruit filling. They are usually cut into circles; it is more economical to do this before the bread is buttered, unless you can cut rounds from one side, and a crescent above it. Almost any sweet may be used. Serve with chocolate or coffee according to the fruit, either for an afternoon tea or an \"evening.\"   Cherry Sandwiches  Chop a quarter of a pound of candied cherries very fine, adding occasionally as you chop them a few drops of orange juice, if you use wine, a few drops of sherry. Mix thoroughly and spread over water thins, making it a little deeper in the center than at the edges. These sandwiches are better made from crackers than from bread. Arrange neatly on a pretty glass dish, and they are ready to serve.   Fig Sandwiches  Split a dozen figs and scrape out the soft portion, rejecting the skins; work this to a paste. Cut the slices of bread from the loaf, buttering before you cut them; make them quite thin. Remove the crusts, and spread this thick paste over the bread and roll carefully; press for a moment until there is no danger of the roll opening; roll each in a piece of tissue paper; twist the ends as you would an old-fashioned \"secret,\" or they may be tied with baby ribbon. These are exceedingly wholesome and palatable.   Fruit and Nut Sandwiches  These are perhaps the most attractive of all the sweet sandwiches.  Put through the meat chopper a quarter of a pound of almonds with half a pound of washed figs, the same quantity of dates, the same of raisins, and a pound of pecan nuts; put them through alternately so that they will be mixed in chopping. Pack the mixture into round baking powder tins, pressing it down firmly, and stand it aside over night. When wanted, dip the tin in hot water, loosen it with a knife and shake out the mixture. With a sharp knife cut into very thin slices and put them between two rounds of buttered bread. Serve with chocolate.  The combination may be varied; candied cherries, citron or any of the candied fruits may be substituted for the dates and figs. Brazilian and pine nuts may be substituted for a portion of the pecans.   Orange Marmalade Sandwiches  These sandwiches may be made precisely the same as fig sandwiches, substituting the orange marmalade for the figs.   Sponge Cake Sandwiches  Bake a sponge cake in a square loaf; cut it into slices a quarter of an inch thick; cut the slices into rounds with a small biscuit cutter. With another small cutter take out the center leaving the ring; put this ring on top of a solid round making sort of a patty as it were; fill the spaces with a mixture of chopped candied fruit that has been soaked in orange juice over night; cover the top with the meringue made from white of egg and sugar; put them in the oven to brown, dish neatly and they are ready to use. These cannot stand over an hour as the fruit will soften the cake.   Fresh Fruit Sandwiches  These sandwiches are exceedingly nice to serve for afternoon teas. They must be used soon after they are made. They will, however, if wrapped in a damp napkin, keep for an hour, but as fruit is soft the bread is liable to become moist, which spoils the sandwich.  Butter the bread and put between layers of sliced strawberries, dusted with powdered sugar; or raspberries, or large blackberries cut into halves; or peaches, finely chopped; or apple seasoned with a little salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice; or sliced bananas with a dash of lemon juice, are all nice.   Raisin Sandwiches  Put one-half pound of seeded raisins through the meat grinder, add a quarter of a pound of almonds that have been blanched, dried and ground. Add a half tumbler of quince jelly, mix thoroughly and put between thin slices of buttered white bread. These sandwiches are very nice in place of cake for afternoon teas or evening companies.   Afternoon Teas  Stone a quarter of a pound of dates, put them through a meat grinder, add to them a half tumbler of nut butter, mix until smooth, add four tablespoonfuls of sweet cream and a tablespoonful of orange juice. Put this mixture between thin slices of white buttered bread, press together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers or four small triangles.   Nut and Apple Sandwiches  Put a half cupful of _thick_ stewed apples into a bowl, add the grated yellow rind of quarter of an orange and one cupful of finely chopped mixed nuts. Spread this on saltines, Uneedas, or any crisp cracker. Put on top another cracker and serve at once. These are very nice for children's parties. Of course one may use buttered bread, either white or brown.   Grape Fruit Sandwiches  Spread any crisp cracker with a thin layer of grape fruit marmalade, put on top another cracker and serve at once.   Ginger Sandwiches  Put four or five pieces of ginger through your meat chopper. Stir this paste into a half cupful of orange marmalade. Put between slices of buttered bread, press them together, trim the crusts and cut into fingers. These are nice for afternoon teas. Ginger and carrot marmalade are also very nice.     CANAPÉS   These are slices of bread cut into fancy shapes, toasted or quickly fried in hot oil, or they may be spread with butter and browned in a quick oven. One slice only is used for each canapé. The mixture is spread on top, the top garnished, and the canapé used at once.   Anchovy Canapés  Cover a round or square of toast with anchovies that have been mashed and seasoned with a little tomato catsup. Put a little chopped celery around the edge as a garnish and send at once to the table.   Caviar Canapés  Season the caviar with onion and a very little lemon juice; spread over a round or square canapé, put chopped onion around the edge, garnish the top with a hard-boiled egg; place on paper mats and send at once to the table. These are used as first course at lunch or dinner.   Swedish Canapés  Cut thick slices of whole wheat or Graham bread, trim the crusts and hollow out the centers, being careful not to make a hole all the way through. Pound or mash the hard boiled yolks of three eggs with a tablespoonful of anchovy paste or two anchovies, two tablespoonfuls of butter and a dash of lemon juice. Cut a dill pickle lengthwise into slices an"]]]
