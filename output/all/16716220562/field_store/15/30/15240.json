Rudely     I'm Yorkshire too       Anonymous       From A Garland of New Songs, published by W. Appleton,      Darlington, 1811.       By t' side of a brig, that stands over a brook,         I was sent betimes to school;      I went wi' the stream, as I studied my book,         An' was thought to be no small fool.      I never yet bought a pig in a poke,         For, to give awd Nick his due,      Tho' oft I've dealt wi' Yorkshire folk,         Yet I was Yorkshire too.       I was pretty well lik'd by each village maid,         At races, wake or fair,      For my father had addled a vast(1) in trade,         And I were his son and heir.      And seeing that I didn't want for brass,         Poor girls came first to woo,      But tho' I delight in a Yorkshrre lass,         Yet I was Yorkshire too!       To Lunnon by father I was sent,         Genteeler manners to see;      But fashion's so dear, I came back as I went,         And so they made nothing o' me      My kind relations would soon have found out         What was best wi' my money to do:      Says I, \"My dear cousins, I thank ye for nowt,         But I'm not to be cozen'd by you!         For I'm Yorkshire too.\"       1. Earned a lot.     The Wensleydale Lad       Anonymous       When I were at home wi' my fayther an' mother,         I niver had na fun;      They kept me goin' frae morn to neet,         so I thowt frae them I'd run.      Leeds Fair were coomin' on,         an' I thowt I'd have a spree,      So I put on my Sunday cooat         an' went right merrily.       First thing I saw were t' factory,         I niver seed one afore;      There were threads an' tapes, an' tapes an' silks,         to sell by monny a score.      Owd Ned turn'd iv'ry wheel,         an' iv'ry wheel a strap;      \"Begor!\" says I to t' maister-man,         \"Owd Ned's a rare strong chap.\"       Next I went to Leeds Owd Church--         I were niver i' one i' my days,      An' I were maistly ashamed o' misel,         for I didn't knaw their ways;      There were thirty or forty folk,         i' tubs an' boxes sat,      When up cooms a saucy owd fellow.         Says he, \"Noo, lad, tak off thy hat.\"       Then in there cooms a great Lord Mayor,         an' over his shooders a club,      An' he gat into a white sack-poke,(1)         an gat into t' topmost tub.      An' then there cooms anither chap,         I thinks they call'd him Ned,      An' he gat into t' bottommost tub,         an' mock'd all t' other chap said.       So they began to preach an' pray,         they prayed for George, oor King;      When up jumps t' chap i' t' bottommost tub.       Says he, \"Good folks, let's sing.\"      I thowt some sang varra weel,         while others did grunt an' groan,      Ivery man sang what he wad,         so I sang \" Darby an' Joan.\"(2)       When preachin' an' prayin' were over,         an' folks were gangin' away,      I went to t' chap i' t' topmost tub.         Says I, \"Lad, what's to pay?\"      \"Why, nowt,\" says he, \"my lad.\"         Begor! I were right fain,      So I click'd hod(3) o' my gret club stick         an' went whistlin' oot again.       1. Corn-sack  2. Another reading is \"Bobbing Joan.\"      3.

I'll put my best white stockings on,      An' pair o' new cauf-leather shoon,         My clane wash'd gown o' printed cotton;      Aboot my neck a muslin shawl,      A new silk handkerchee ower all,         Wi' sike a careless air I'll put on,            I'll shine this day.       My partner Ned, I know, thinks he,      He'll mak hiss en secure o' me,         He's often said he'd treat me rarely;      But I's think o' some other fun,      I'll aim for some rich farmer's son,         And cheat oor simple Neddy fairly,            Sae sly this day.       Why mud not I succeed as weel,      An' get a man full oot genteel,         As awd John Darby's daughter Nelly?

A wanton wether had disdain'd the bounds      That kept him close confin'd to Willy's grounds;      Broke through the hedge, he wander'd far astray,      He knew not whither on the public way.      As Willy strives, with all attentive care,      The fence to strengthen and the gap repair,      His neighbour, Roger, from the fair return'd,      Appears in sight in riding-graith adorn'd;      Whom, soon as Willy, fast approaching, spies,      Thus to his friend, behind the hedge, he cries.       WILLY      How dea ye, Roger? Hae ye been at t' fair?      How gangs things? Made ye onny bargains there?

Depend upon 't, they'd better niver stor.(4)       ROGER      True, Willy, nobbud Englishmen 'll stand      By yan another o' their awwn good land.

If Franch dea coom here, Roger, I'll be hang'd      An' they deant git theirsens reet soondly bang'd.      I can't bud think--thof I may be mistean ­      Not monny on 'em 'll git back agean.

I whope it's all on't fause, bud sea talks gang.      Howsiver this I knaw, at when they please,      Oor sailors always beat 'em upo' t' seas.      An' if they nobbut sharply look aboot,      T'hey needn't let a single ship coom oat.      At least they'll drub 'em weel, I dinnot fear,      An' keep 'em fairly off frae landin' here.

Elegy on the Death of a Frog (1815)       David Lewis       Ya summer day when I were mowin',      When flooers of monny soorts were growin',      Which fast befoor my scythe fell bowin',            As I advance,      A frog I cut widout my knowin'--            A sad mischance.       Poor luckless frog, why com thoo here?      Thoo sure were destitute o' fear;      Some other way could thoo nut steer            To shun the grass?      For noo that life, which all hod dear,            Is gean, alas!       Hadst thoo been freeten'd by the soond      With which the mowers strip the groond,      Then fled away wi' nimble boond,            Thoo'd kept thy state:      But I, unknawin', gav a wound,            Which browt thy fate.       Sin thoo com frae thy parent spawn,      Wi' painted cooat mair fine than lawn,      And golden rings round baith ees drawn,            All gay an' blithe,      Thoo lowpt(1) the fields like onny fawn,            But met the scythe.       Frae dikes where winter watters steead(2)      Thoo com unto the dewy mead,      Regardless of the cattle's treead,            Wi' pantin' breeath,      For to restore thy freezin' bleead,            But met wi' deeath.       A Frenchman early seekin' prog,(3)      Will oftentimes ransack the bog,      To finnd a sneel, or weel-fed frog,            To give relief;      But I prefer a leg of hog,            Or roond o' beef.       But liker far to the poor frog,      I's wanderin' through the world for prog,      Where deeath gies monny a yan a jog,            An' cuts them doon;      An' though I think misen incog,            That way I's boun.       Time whets his scythe and shakes his glass,      And though I know all flesh be grass,      Like monny mair I play the ass,            Don't seem to know;      But here wad sometime langer pass,            Befoor I go.

They waited lang, the ghost didn't come,         They began to laugh an' rail,      \"If he coom oat of his den,\" says yan,         \"We'll clap a bit o' saut of his tail.\"       \"Nay, he knows better than turn oot,         When we are here to watch him,      He'd git a bullet through his lug,         Or Mungo there wad catch him.\"       When close to their heads wi' a terrible clatter         The ghost went whirrin' up,      An' owerr the woods he laughed an' shouted,         \"Bobo, bobo! who whoop, who whoop!\"       The gamkeepers all tummled doon,         Their hair thrast off their hat,      They gaped an' grean'd(4) an' roll'd aboot,         An' their hearts went pit-a-pat.       Their feaces were white as onny clout,          An' they said niver a word,      T'hey couldn't tell what the ghost was like,         Whether 'twas a beast or a bird.       They stay'd nea langer i' t' wood that neet,         Poor men were niver dafter,      They ran awa hame as fast as they could,         An' their dogs ran yelping after.       The parson then, a larned man,         Said he wad conjure the ghost;      He was sure it was nea wandrin' beast,         But a spirit that was lost.       All languages this parson knew         That onny man can chat in,      The Ebrew, Greek, an' Irish too,         As weel as Dutch an' Latin.       O! he could talk an' read an' preach,         Few men knew mair or better,      An' nearly all the bukes he read         Were printed in black letter.

The clerk was quickly by his side,         He took but little fettlin',      An' awa they went wi' right good will         To gie the ghost a settlin'.
