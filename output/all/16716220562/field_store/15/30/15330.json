Phil and Ione were attacked by nausea until, again, they had to lie down. After that came the familiar succession: the wooden animals, the tangle of vines, the vast sea, the spheres, and more blurred scenes. Then came a pause, with the nebula and the glorious suns swinging into view once again.  \"Oh, I understand!\" Ione exclaimed; \"We're swinging. The safe was so heavy that we swung too violently, too far, and back again--\"  \"And we keep going till it knocks us out, or till the old cat dies,\" added Phil.         *       *       *       *       *  However, they found that after a number of repetitions of the same program, their giddiness was becoming less; and instead of lying down in the middle of the swing, they could look about. Then it occurred to Phil to time the interval between the nebula and the mountain-range. When the exact halfway point was determined, and after several more swings, they could see dimly the windows and machinery of Tony's laboratory flash by when they passed the middle.  \"I don't mean to be a crepe-hanger, but how do you know we will stop at the right point?\" Phil asked.  \"I don't,\" replied Ione cheerfully. \"But mathematics says so. A freely oscillating segment of space would naturally come to equilibrium in a position parallel to the rest of its own space, would it not?\"  There came a swing when they did not reach the nebula on the one hand and the mountain-range on the other. After that, views dropped off from either end of the swing quite rapidly, and before many minutes, they looked into Tony's laboratory a large portion of the time. For many seconds the laboratory held; then it would gradually fade, and reappear again, only to fade into empty nothingness all around.  \"The old cat's dead,\" Phil finally announced.  They sat and stared about them as the laboratory held steady and no further intervening periods of blankness intervened. They both sighed deeply and slumped over on the ground to rest.  \"Bang! bang! bang!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Some sort of hammering woke them up. They looked about them in a daze. It was broad daylight, and things looked queer in the laboratory. There was a smell of scorched rubber and hot oil. Great loops of wire sagged down from above. Several nondescript heaps stood about that might once have been machinery, but now suggested melting snow-men, all fused into heaps. At a table sprawled a queer, misshapen figure that suggested human origin. Both of its hands were burned to cinders to the elbows. Great holes were scorched into the clothes. But the face was recognizable. Tony's playthings had got him at last.  \"Looks like something's happened in here!\" Phil gasped, in amazement.  \"I'll bet it has, too,\" Ione exclaimed. \"This is the first time it occurred to me that our recoil from throwing the safe overboard and the oscillation of our space-segment must have created a tremendous electrical field in the tetra-ordinate apparatus. The reaction is reversible, you see. The field swings the space-segment, or the swinging of the space-segment creates the field. And the field was too much for Tony.\"  At this point the door fell under the blows of the police, and the raiding squad rushed into the room.         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29069"],["title","Poisoned Air (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:       This etext was produced from Astounding Stories March 1932.

The orderly on duty dropped his feet from the desk to the floor and lifted the receiver with a muttered curse.  \"Post hospital, Aberdeen Proving Ground,\" he said sleepily, rubbing his eyes.  A burst of raucous coughing answered him. Several times it ceased for an instant and a voice tried to speak, but each time a fresh spasm of deep-chested wracking coughing interrupted.  \"Who is this?\" demanded the now aroused orderly. \"What's the matter?\"  Between intervals of coughing difficultly enunciated words reached him.  \"This is--_uch! uch!_--Lieutenant Burroughs at the--_uch!_--Michaelville range. We have been--_uch!_--caught in a cloud of poison--_uch!_ _uch!_--gas. Send an ambulance and a--_uch!_--surgeon at once. Better bring--_uch!_--gas masks.\"  \"At the Michaelville range, sir? How many men are down there?\"  \"_Uch! uch! uch!_--five--all help--_uch! uch!_--helpless. Hurry!\"  \"Yes, sir. I'll start two ambulances down at once, sir.\"  \"Don't forget the--_uch! uch!_--gas--_uch!_--masks.\"  \"No, sir; I'll send them, sir.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Five minutes later two ambulances rolled out of the garage and took the four-mile winding ribbon of concrete which separated the Michaelville water impact range from the main front of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. On each ambulance was a hastily awakened and partially clothed medical officer. For three miles they tore along the curving road at high speed. Without warning the leading machine slowed down. The driver of the second ambulance shoved home his brake just in time to keep from ramming the leading vehicle.  \"What's the matter?\" he shouted.  As he spoke he gave a muttered curse and switched on his amber fog-light. From the marshes on either side of the road a deep blanket of fog rolled up and enveloped the vehicle, almost shutting off the road from sight. The forward ambulance began to grope its way slowly forward. The senior medical officer sniffed the fog critically and shouted to his driver.  \"Stop!\" he cried. \"There's something funny about this fog. Every one put on gas masks.\"  He coughed slightly as he adjusted his mask. His orders were shouted to the ambulance in the rear but before the masks could be adjusted, every member of the crew was vying with the rest in the frequency and violence of the coughs which he could emit. The masks did not seem to shut out the poisonous fog which crept in between the masks and the men's faces and seemed to take bodily possession of their lungs.  \"I don't believe we'll ever make the last mile to Michaelville through this, Major,\" cried the driver between intervals of coughing. \"Hadn't we better turn back while we can?\"  \"Drive on!\" cried the medical officer. \"We'll keep going as long as we can. Imagine what those poor devils on the range are going through without masks of any sort.\"         *       *       *       *       *  On through the rapidly thickening fog, the two ambulances groped their way. The road seemed interminable, but at length the flood lights of the Michaelville end of the range came dimly into view. As the vehicles stopped the two surgeons jumped to the ground and groped their way forward, stretcher bearers following them closely. Presently Major Martin stumbled over a body which lay at full length on the concrete runway between the two main buildings. He stooped and examined the man with the aid of a pocket flashlight.  \"He's alive,\" he announced in muffled tones through his mask. \"Take him to the ambulance and fit a mask on him.\"  Three more unconscious men were carried to the ambulances before the prone form of Lieutenant Burroughs was found by the searchers. The lieutenant lay on his back not far from the telephone and directly under the glare of a huge arc-light. His eyes were open and he was conscious, but when he tried to speak, only a murmur came from his lips. There was a rattle in his chest and faint coughs tried in vain to force their way out between his stiffened lips.  \"Easy, Lieutenant,\" said Major Martin as he bent over him; \"don't try to talk just now. You're all right and we'll have a mask on you in a jiffy. That damned gas isn't as thick right here as it is down the road a way.\"  Two medical corps men lifted the lieutenant onto a stretcher and started to fit a mask over his face. He feebly raised a hand to stop them. His lips formed words which he could not enunciate, but Major Martin understood them.  \"Your men?\" he said between intervals of coughing. \"We've got them all in the ambulance, I think. There were four besides yourself, weren't there?\"  The lieutenant nodded.  \"Right. We have them all. Now we'll take you back to the hospital and have you fixed up in a jiffy.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The entire rescue crew were coughing violently as the ambulances left Michaelville. For a mile they drove through fog that was thicker than had been seen in Maryland for years. They reached the point where they had encountered the congealed moisture on the way out, but now there was no diminution of its density. The main post was less than two miles away when they burst out into a clear night and increased their speed.  As the two machines drew up in front of the post hospital, the driver of the leading ambulance swayed in his seat. Blindly he pulled on his emergency brake and then slumped forward in his seat, his breath coming in wheezing gasps. Major Martin hastily tore the mask from his face and glanced at it.  \"Take him in with the rest!\" he cried. \"His mask must have leaked.\"  As they entered the hospital, a sickening weakness overcame Major Martin. From all sides a black pall seemed to roll in on him and bits of ice seemed to form in his brain. He reeled and caught at the shoulder of a corps man who was passing. The orderly caught at him and looked for a moment at his livid face.  \"Sergeant Connors!\" he cried.  A technical sergeant hastened up. Major Martin forced words with difficulty through stiffening lips.  \"Call Captain Murdock,\" he wheezed, \"and have him get Captain Williams. I'm down and probably Dr. Briscoe will be down in a few minutes. Telephone the commanding officer and tell him to quarantine the whole proving ground. Have the telephone orderly wake everyone on the post and order them to close all windows in all buildings and not to venture outside until they get fresh orders. This seems to be the same stuff they had in Belgium last December.\"  As the last words came from his lips he slowly stiffened and slumped toward the ground. The sergeant and the orderly picked him up and carried him to a bed in the emergency ward. The orderly hurried away to close all of the hospital windows while Sergeant Connors took down the receiver of the telephone and began to carry out the Major's orders.         *       *       *       *       *  Dr. Bird glanced at the news-paper clipping which Operative Carnes of the United States Secret Service laid on his desk. Into his eyes came a curious glitter, sure evidence that the famous scientist's interest was aroused.  \"Last December when we discussed this matter, Doctor,\" said the detective, \"you gave it as your opinion that Ivan Saranoff was at the bottom of it and that the same plague which devastated the Meuse Valley in Belgium would eventually make an appearance in the United States. You were right.\"  Dr. Bird bounded to his feet.  \"Is Saranoff back on this side of the Atlantic?\" he demanded.  \"Officially, he is not. Every customs inspector and immigration officer has his photograph and no report of his arrest has come in, but we know Saranoff well enough to discount negative evidence where he is concerned. Whether he is here or not, the plague is.\"  \"When did it appear?\"  \"Last night at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. It has killed eight or ten and twice as many more are sick. The place is quarantined and a rigid censorship has been placed over the telephones, but it is only a matter of time before some press man will get the story. I have a car waiting below and a pass signed by the Secretary of War. Grab what apparatus you need and we'll start.\"  Dr. Bird pressed a button on his desk. A tall, willowy girl entered, notebook in hand. Carnes glanced with keen appreciation at her slim beauty.  \"Miss Andrews,\" said the doctor, \"in five minutes Mr. Carnes and I will leave here for Aberdeen Proving Ground in the Government car which is waiting below. You will see that Mr. Davis is in that car and that traveling laboratory 'Q' is ready to follow us.\"  \"Yes, Doctor.\"  \"You remember that mysterious plague in Belgium last December, do you not?\"  \"Yes, Doctor.\"  \"I was unable to get over to Belgium, but an army surgeon and two Public Health Service men went over. You will get copies of all reports they made, including especially any reports of autopsies on bodies of victims. I want all data on file in the Public Health Service or the War Department. You will then obtain a car and follow us to Aberdeen. Arrangements will be made for your admittance to the proving ground. The Belgian plague has made its appearance in the United States.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Swiftly the expression of the girl's face changed. Her dark eyes glowed with an internal fire and the immobility of her face vanished as if by magic to be replaced by an expression of fierce hatred. Her lips drew back, exposing her"]]]
