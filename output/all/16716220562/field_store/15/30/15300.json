At the age of twenty-one he studied music for a year under the Cappelmeister PABRICH, at Potsdam, and in August, 1731, he became oboist in the band of the Guards, at Hanover. In August, 1732, he married ANNA ILSE MORITZEN. She appears to have been a careful and busy wife and mother, possessed of no special faculties which would lead us to attribute to her care any great part of the abilities of her son. She could not herself write the letters which she sent to her husband during his absences with his regiment. It was her firm belief that the separations and some of the sorrows of the family came from too much learning; and while she could not hinder the education of the sons of the family, she prevented their sisters from learning French and dancing. It is but just to say that the useful accomplishments of cooking, sewing, and the care of a household, were thoroughly taught by her to her two daughters. The father, ISAAC, appears to have been of a different mould, and to him, no doubt, the chief intellectual characteristics of the family are due. His position obliged him to be often absent from Hanover, with his regiment, but his hand appears to have been always present, smoothing over difficulties, and encouraging his sons to such learning and improvement as was to be had.  His health was seriously injured by the exposures of the campaigns, and he was left, after the Seven Years' War, with a broken constitution.  After his final return home, in 1760, his daughter gives this record of him--      \"Copying music employed every vacant moment, even sometimes     throughout half the night. . . . With my brother [DIETRICH]--now a     little engaging creature of between four and five years old--he was     very much pleased, and [on the first evening of his arrival at home]     before he went to rest, the Adempken (a little violin) was taken     from the shelf and newly strung, and the daily lessons immediately     commenced. . . . I do not recollect that he ever desired any other     society than what he had opportunities of enjoying in many of the     parties where he was introduced by his profession, though far from     being of a morose disposition; he would frequently encourage my     mother in keeping up a social intercourse among a few acquaintances,     whilst his afternoon hours generally were taken up in giving lessons     to some scholars at home, who gladly saved him the troublesome     exertion of walking. . . . He also found great pleasure in seeing     DIETRICH'S improvement, who, young as he was, and of the most lively     temper imaginable, was always ready to receive his lessons, leaving     his little companions with the greatest cheerfulness to go to his     father, who was so pleased with his performances that he made him     play a solo on the Adempken in RAKE'S concert, being placed on a     table before a crowded company, for which he was very much applauded     and caressed, particularly by an English lady, who put a gold coin     in his little pocket.      \"It was not long before my father had as many scholars as he could     find time to attend. And when they assembled at my father's to make     little concerts, I was frequently called to join the second violin     in an overture, for my father found pleasure in giving me sometimes     a lesson before the instruments were laid by, after practising with     DIETRICH, for I never was missing at those hours, sitting in a     corner with my knitting and listening all the while.\"  Here, as in all her writing, CAROLINA is simple, true, direct to awkwardness, and unconsciously pathetic even in joy.  The family of ISAAC and ANNA HERSCHEL consisted of ten children. Six of these lived to adult age. They were:      1. SOPHIA ELIZABETH; born 1733, married GRIESBACH, a musician in the        Guard, by whom she had children. Five of her sons were afterwards        musicians at the court, in England, where they obtained places        through the influence of WILLIAM.      2. HENRY ANTON JACOB; born 1734, November 20.      4. FREDERIC WILLIAM (the astronomer) born 1738, November 15.      6. JOHN ALEXANDER; born 1745, November 13.      8. CAROLINA LUCRETIA; born 1750, March 16.      10. DIETRICH; born 1755, September 13.  Of this family group, the important figures to us are WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA.  JACOB was organist at the Garrison Church of Hanover in 1753, a member of the Guards' band in 1755, and first violin in the Hanover Court Orchestra in 1759. Afterwards he joined his brother WILLIAM in Bath, but again returned to Hanover. In 1771 he published in Amsterdam his Opus I., a set of six quartettes, and later, in London, he published two symphonies and six trios. He appears to have been a clever musician, and his letters to his younger brother WILLIAM are full of discussion on points of musical composition, etc. He died in 1792.  DIETRICH, the youngest brother, shared in the musical abilities of his family, and when only fifteen years old was so far advanced as to be able to supply his brother JACOB'S place in the Court Orchestra, and to give his lessons to private pupils. There is no one of the family, except the eldest daughter, whom we do not know to have possessed marked ability in music, and this taste descended truly for four generations. In the letters of Chevalier BUNSEN,[2] he describes meeting, in 1847, the eldest granddaughter of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, who, he says, \"is a musical genius.\"  Three members of the family, WILLIAM, ALEXANDER, and CAROLINA, formed a group which was inseparable for many years, and while the progress of the lives of ALEXANDER and CAROLINA was determined by the energy and efforts of WILLIAM, these two lent him an aid without which his career would have been strangely different. It is necessary to understand a little better the early life of all three.  The sons of the HERSCHEL family all attended the garrison school in Hanover until they were about fourteen years old. They were taught the ordinary rudiments of knowledge--to read, to write, to cipher--and a knowledge of French and English was added. WILLIAM especially distinguished himself in his studies, learning French very rapidly, and studying Latin and arithmetic with his master out of hours. The household life seems to have been active, harmonious, and intelligent, especially during the presence of the father, who took a great delight in the rapid progress of all his sons in music, and who encouraged them with his companionship in their studies and in their reading on all intellectual subjects.  From the _Memoir_ of CAROLINA, on which we must depend for our knowledge of this early life, we take the following paragraph:      \"My brothers were often introduced as solo performers and assistants     in the orchestra of the court, and I remember that I was frequently     prevented from going to sleep by the lively criticism on music on     coming from a concert, or by conversations on philosophical subjects,     which lasted frequently till morning, in which my father was a     lively partaker and assistant of my brother WILLIAM, by contriving     self-made instruments. . . . Often I would keep myself awake that     I might listen to their animating remarks, for it made _me so happy_     to see _them so happy_. But generally their conversation would     branch out on philosophical subjects, when my brother WILLIAM and my     father often argued with such warmth that my mother's interference     became necessary, when the names LEIBNITZ, NEWTON, and EULER     sounded rather too loud for the repose of her little ones, who     ought to be in school by seven in the morning. But it seems that     on the brothers retiring to their own room, where they shared     the same bed, my brother WILLIAM had still a great deal to say; and     frequently it happened that when he stopped for an assent or reply,     he found his hearer was gone to sleep, and I suppose it was not till     then that he bethought himself to do the same.      \"The recollection of these happy scenes confirms me in the belief,     that had my brother WILLIAM not then been interrupted in his     philosophical pursuits, we should have had much earlier proofs of     his inventive genius. My father was a great admirer of astronomy,     and had some knowledge of that science; for I remember his taking     me, on a clear frosty night, into the street, to make me acquainted     with several of the most beautiful constellations, after we had been     gazing at a comet which was then visible. And I well remember with     what delight he used to assist my brother WILLIAM in his various     contrivances in the pursuit of his philosophical studies, among     which was a neatly turned 4-inch globe, upon which the equator and     ecliptic were engraved by my brother.\"  The mechanical genius was not confined to WILLIAM, for we read that ALEXANDER used often to \"sit by us and amuse us and himself by making all sorts of things out of pasteboard, or contriving how to make a twelve-hour cuckoo clock go a week.\" This ability of ALEXANDER'S was turned later to the best account when he became his brother WILLIAM'S right hand in the manufacture of reflectors, eye-pieces, and stands in England. His abilities were great, and a purpose which might otherwise have been lacking was supplied through the younger brother's ardor in all that he undertook.  His musical talent was remarkable; he played \"divinely\" on the violoncello. He returned to Hanover in 1816, where he lived in comfortable independence, through the never-failing generosity of his brother, until his death in 1821. A notice of him in a Bristol paper says: \"Died, March 15, 1821, at Hanover, ALEXANDER HERSCHEL, Esqr., well known to the public of Bath and Bristol as a performer and elegant musician; and who for forty-seven years was the admiration of the frequenters of concerts and theatres of both those cities as principal violoncello.

Now in these early years she was a silent and persistent child, growing up with a feeling that she was uncared for and neglected, and lavishing all her childish affection, as she did all that of her womanly life, on her brother WILLIAM. Throughout her long life, \"my brother\" was WILLIAM, \"my nephew\" _his_ son.  The brothers JACOB and WILLIAM were, with their father, members of the band of the Guards in 1755, when the regiment was ordered to England, and they were absent from Hanover a year.  WILLIAM (then seventeen years old) went as oboist, and out of his scanty pay brought back to Hanover, in 1756, only one memento of his stay--a copy of LOCKE _On the Human Understanding_.  He appears to have served with the Guard during part of the campaign of 1757. His health was then delicate, and his parents \"determined to remove him from the service--a step attended by no small difficulties.\"[3]  This \"removal\" was hurriedly and safely effected, so hurriedly that the copy of LOCKE was not put in the parcels sent after him to Hamburg by his mother; \"she, dear woman, knew no other wants than good linen and clothing.\"  Thus, at last, the young WILLIAM HERSCHEL, the son of an oboe-player in the King's Guard, is launched in life for himself, in the year 1757, at the age of nineteen.  All his equipment is the \"good linen and clothing,\" a knowledge of French, Latin, and English, some skill in playing the violin, the organ, and the oboe, and an \"uncommon precipitancy\" in doing what there is to be done.  A slender outfit truly; but we are not to overlook what he said of himself on another occasion. \"I have, nevertheless, several resources in view, and do not despair of succeeding pretty well in the end.\"  From 1757 to 1760--three years--we know nothing of his life. We can imagine what it was. His previous visit to England had given him a good knowledge of the language, and perhaps a few uninfluential acquaintances. On his return he would naturally seek these out, and, by means of his music, he could gain a livelihood. We first hear of him as charged with the organization of the music of a corps of the militia of Durham, under the auspices of the EARL OF DARLINGTON. \"La manière dont il remplit cette mission, le fit connaître avantageusement.\"[4] The nature of the service of these militia corps, which were then forming all over England, is well described in the Autobiography of GIBBON. Every county-gentleman felt constrained to serve his country, and the regimental mess-rooms were filled with men of rank and fashion.  In 1760 we hear of him again. He has attracted the notice of those about him.      \"About the year 1760, as MILLER[5] was dining at Pontefract with     the officers of the Durham militia, one of them, knowing his love of     music, told him they had a young German in their band as a performer     on the hautboy, who had only been a few months in England, and yet     spoke English almost as well as a native, and who was also an     excellent performer on the violin; the officer added that if MILLER     would come into another room, this German should entertain him with     a solo. The invitation was gladly accepted, and MILLER heard a solo     of GIARDINI'S executed in a manner that surprised him. He afterwards     took an opportunity of having some private conversation with the     young musician, and asked him whether he had engaged himself for any     long period to the Durham militia. The answer was, 'Only from month     to month.' 'Leave them, then,' said the organist, 'and come and live     with me. I am a single man, and think we shall be happy together;     and, doubtless, your merit will soon entitle you to a more eligible     situation.' The offer was accepted as frankly as it was made, and     the reader may imagine with what satisfaction Dr. MILLER     must have remembered this act of generous feeling when he hears     that this young German was HERSCHEL, the Astronomer. 'My humble     mansion,' says MILLER, 'consisted, at that time, but of two rooms.     However, poor as I was, my cottage contained a library of     well-chosen books; and it must appear singular that a foreigner who     had been so short a time in England should understand even the     peculiarities of the language so well as to fix upon SWIFT for his     favorite author.'      \"He took an early opportunity of introducing his new friend at     Mr. CROPLEY'S concerts; the first violin was resigned to him; 'and     never,' says the organist, 'had I heard the concertos of CORELLI,     GEMINIANI, and AVISON, or the overtures of HANDEL performed more     chastely, or more according to the original intention of the     composers, than by Mr. HERSCHEL. I soon lost my companion; his fame     was presently spread abroad; he had the offer of pupils, and was     solicited to lead the public concerts both at Wakefield and Halifax.     A new organ for the parish church of Halifax was built about this     time, and HERSCHEL was one of the seven candidates for the     organist's place. They drew lots how they were to perform in     succession. HERSCHEL drew the third, the second fell to Dr.     WAINWRIGHT of Manchester, whose finger was so rapid that old     SNETZLER, the organ-builder, ran about the church exclaiming:     '_Te tevel! te tevel! he run over te keys like one cat; he will     not give my piphes room for to shpeak._' 'During Mr. WAINWRIGHT'S     performance,' says MILLER, 'I was standing in the middle aisle with     HERSCHEL. 'What chance have you,' said I, 'to follow this man?' He     replied, 'I don't know; I am sure fingers will not do.' On which he     ascended the organ loft, and produced from the organ so uncommon a     fulness, such a volume of slow, solemn harmony, that I could by no     means account for the effect. After this short _ex tempore_     effusion, he finished with the Old Hundredth psalm-tune, which he     played better than his opponent.      \"'_Ay, ay_,' cried old SNETZLER, '_tish is very goot, very goot     indeet; I vil luf tish man, for he gives my piphes room for to     shpeak._' Having afterwards asked Mr. HERSCHEL by what means, in the     beginning of his performance, he produced so uncommon an effect, he     replied, 'I told you fingers would not do!' and producing two pieces     of lead from his waistcoat pocket, 'one of these,' said he,     'I placed on the lowest key of the organ, and the other upon the     octave above; thus by accommodating the harmony, I produced the     effect of four hands, instead of two.'\"[6]  The dates in this extract are not so well defined as might be wished. HERSCHEL had certainly been more than a few months in England at the time of his meeting with Dr. MILLER, which was probably about 1760. The appointment as organist at Halifax was in 1765, and the pupils and public concerts must have filled up the intervening five years. During a part of this time he lived in Leeds, with the family of Mr. BULMAN, whom he afterwards provided with a place as clerk to the Octagon Chapel, in his usual generous manner.  All during his life he was placing some of the less fortunate and energetic members of his family.  We cannot be too grateful to Dr. MILLER, who, seeing his opportunity, used it. Their frank friendship does honor to both. HERSCHEL'S organ-playing, which no doubt had been begun when his brother was the organist of the garrison chapel at Hanover, must have been perfected at this time, and it was through his organ-playing that he was able to leave the needy life in Yorkshire.  He was sure to have emerged sooner or later, but every year spared to him as a struggling musician was a year saved to Astronomy.  During all this period, a constant correspondence was maintained between the family at Hanover and the absent son.  Many of WILLIAM'S letters were written in English, and addressed to his brother JACOB, and treated of such subjects as the Theory of Music, in which he was already far advanced.  His little sister was still faithful to the memory of her _dearest_ brother, and his father, whose health was steadily declining, became painfully eager for his return. In 1764 (April 2), he returned to Hanover on a very brief visit. He was attached to England, he was prospering there, and he had no inclination towards returning to a life in Hanover. His sister says:      \"Of the joys and pleasures which all felt at this long-wished-for     meeting with my--let me say my _dearest_--brother, but a small     portion could fall to my share; for with my constant attendance at     church and school, besides the time I was employed in doing the     drudgery of the scullery, it was but seldom I could make one in the     group when the family were assembled together.      \"In the first week, some of the orchestra were invited to a concert,     at which some of my brother WILLIAM'S compositions, overtures, etc.,     and some of my eldest brother JACOB'S were performed, to the great     delight of my dear father, who hoped and expected that they would     be turned to some profit by publishing them, but there was no     printer who bid high enough.      \"Sunday, the 8th, was the--to me--eventful day of my confirmation,     and I left home not a little proud and encouraged by my dear brother     WILLIAM'S approbation of my appearance in my new gown.\"  The engagement of HERSCHEL at Halifax did not long continue. In 1766 he obtained an advantageous engagement as oboist at Bath, and soon after the position of organist at the Octagon Chapel was offered to him and accepted. This was a great and important change.  Bath was then, as now, one of the most beautiful cities in England, and the resort of the fashion and rank of the kingdom,"]]]
