But--\" Billy nodded toward the body of the instructor, then spun hastily as a sound came from the rear of the shed, the _Thor_ gun coming to focus. A trap door was rising there. Three natives were looking up from under it.  \"They're all right,\" the brown native said quickly. \"They're with us.\"  Three ragged men scrambled up from below. They looked at the brown native, then at the body of the instructor on the floor. A look of fierce exultation appeared on their faces. Then they looked at Billy Kasker and at the _Thor_ gun he was holding.  \"Give the _Thor_ gun to Jim,\" the brown native said.  Without hesitation Billy Kasker handed the gun to the native who reached for it. Jim did everything but kiss the weapon. \"God, the years I've spent dreaming of the moment when I would get one of these babies into my hands! One was all I needed.\"  \"Don't stand there gloating, Jim--get moving,\" the brown native said. \"Within a month I want you not only to know how a _Thor_ gun works but to be manufacturing them by the dozens, including the large sizes. This is the gun that has been stopping us all these years--it is the gun that is going to take us out of these pig pens they call museums. Get moving!\"  \"Yes, sir.\" Jim was already gone through the trap door.         *       *       *       *       *  The brown native jerked off the instructor's clothes, then worked quickly but deftly with his knife. As he finished, the instructor's hand separated from the arm at the wrist.  \"He said no one would ever _think_ of doing anything like that,\" Billy Kasker said.  \"Nobody but one of us stinking natives.\" The brown man removed the _plasticum_ bracelet, began to work with the fingers of his left hand. \"I've spent years learning how to throw my thumb out of joint, just getting ready for the time--\"  The _plasticum_ bracelet slipped over the collapsed thumb. It fitted very snugly on his wrist. He held it up.  \"Neat, eh. This makes me one of the conquerors.\"  \"A nice fit. But we have very little time. The group will become alarmed.\"  The second native began to take the instructor's body down the trap door. The brown native swiftly slipped off his clothes and donned the garments the instructor had worn.  \"Ed, where's that _Thor_ gun model? I've got to have something that looks and feels like a genuine _Thor_ gun to turn in at the gate.\"  \"Here it is, sir.\" The third native handed a gleaming replica of the _Thor_ gun to the brown man. He slipped it into the holster. It fitted snugly.  \"How do I look, Billy?\"  Billy Kasker surveyed the brown native. He was remarkably changed. No longer did he look like one of the natives, he looked like a conqueror. \"Just a little higher on the nose with the glasses. And maybe a little less stuffing inside the brim of the hat. But--can you carry off the part of the instructor?\"  \"I can carry it off or die trying,\" the brown native said.  \"Good!\" The two shook hands, then turned and went out the door. As they left, Billy Kasker saw that Ed was mopping the last remnants of the green blood from the floor.  \"Perfect, down to the last detail,\" Billy Kasker said. \"You're a genius at planning.\"  \"You have to be a genius to stay alive. Okay, Billy. Here is where we go into our act.\"  They had moved into the street and the group had seen them. The voice that came from the brown native's mouth was the voice of the instructor, hot and angry.  \"Billy, this sort of conduct is intolerable. You know better than to wander off like this. What possible explanation can you offer for your conduct?\"  Billy Kasker was very penitent. He was embarrassed, he was humiliated, and he showed both very clearly. He had lost all of his air of easy aplomb. \"I'm very sorry, sir. I didn't think--\"  \"That's just it, you didn't think. You saw nothing in that alley, yet you asked me to come back and look. Is that the way you waste your and my time?\"  \"It won't happen again, sir,\" Billy Kasker said contritely.  \"See that it doesn't.\"  \"Yah!\" Joe Buckner gloated. \"This is one time the class president got it in the neck!\"  \"A very good point you have brought out,\" the instructor said. \"Billy has just demonstrated his unfitness to be class president. I am therefore removing him from this position and appointing you in his stead.\"  \"What?\" Joe Buckner gasped, giddy with pleasure.  Billy Kasker took his position in line. No longer did he bring up the rear. Joe Buckner now had that position of honor. The group showed some sympathy for Billy, but not very much or very long. When he lost his position as president they seemed to change their minds about him.  The group moved slowly through the city. As if nothing had happened, the instructor explained what they were seeing. When they asked questions, he answered them. Billy Kasker asked no more questions.  They finally came to the gate and the same resplendent captain greeted them. He accepted the _Thor_ gun and the holster, handed them to the guard.  \"How are things in the museum?\"  \"Everything is in good order, sir.\"  \"Good. I've had the impression they were getting a little restless lately.\"  \"I saw no signs of it.\"  \"Fine. Did you have any trouble with the group?\"  \"Very little. Billy Kasker wandered off for a few moments and I had to demote him. But it was nothing. See you next year when I bring another graduating class through to show them around.\"  The group began to separate to go to their own homes. Billy Kasker lingered a little, to speak to the instructor. \"I've already asked my folks, sir, so I know it will be all right with them, so if you would like to come home with me tonight--\"  \"Hmmmm.\"  \"Trying to suck in again,\" Joe Buckner said. \"It won't do you any good now. You're cooked for good this time!\"  Billy Kasker seemed not to hear him. His eyes were on the instructor. \"We would be very glad to have you, sir. We could talk about a great many things.\"  \"Why, Billy, in that case I will be glad to come home with you.\"  They moved away together. \"There's one thing I want made completely clear,\" Billy Kasker said.  \"What is that?\"  \"When the time comes, there is one conqueror I've got on _my_ list!\"  \"That jerk I made class president? Of course, Billy. We will be glad to save him for you alone.\" The instructor's smile was a happy one.  \"Good. That's agreed then.\" In the gathering dusk, Billy Kasker's voice was as sharp as the edge of a knife driving home into a throat from which green blood spurted....

DARWIN'S WORK, \"ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES,\" IN RELATION TO THE COMPLETE THEORY OF THE CAUSES OF THE PHENOMENA OF ORGANIC NATURE   By Thomas H. Huxley     IN the preceding five lectures I have endeavoured to give you an account of those facts, and of those reasonings from facts, which form the data upon which all theories regarding the causes of the phenomena of organic nature must be based. And, although I have had frequent occasion to quote Mr. Darwin--as all persons hereafter, in speaking upon these subjects, will have occasion to quote his famous book on the \"Origin of Species,\"--you must yet remember that, wherever I have quoted him, it has not been upon theoretical points, or for statements in any way connected with his particular speculations, but on matters of fact, brought forward by himself, or collected by himself, and which appear incidentally in his book. If a man 'will' make a book, professing to discuss a single question, an encyclopaedia, I cannot help it.  Now, having had an opportunity of considering in this sort of way the different statements bearing upon all theories whatsoever, I have to lay before you, as fairly as I can, what is Mr. Darwin's view of the matter and what position his theories hold, when judged by the principles which I have previously laid down, as deciding our judgments upon all theories and hypotheses.  I have already stated to you that the inquiry respecting the causes of the phenomena of organic nature resolves itself into two problems--the first being the question of the origination of living or organic beings; and the second being the totally distinct problem of the modification and perpetuation of organic beings when they have already come into existence. The first question Mr. Darwin does not touch; he does not deal with it at all; but he says--given the origin of organic matter--supposing its creation to have already taken place, my object is to show in consequence of what laws and what demonstrable properties of organic matter, and of its environments, such states of organic nature as those with which we are acquainted must have come about. This, you will observe, is a perfectly legitimate proposition; every person has a right to define the limits of the inquiry which he sets before himself; and yet it is a most singular thing that in all the multifarious, and, not unfrequently, ignorant attacks which have been made upon the 'Origin of Species', there is nothing which has been more speciously criticised than this particular limitation. If people have nothing else to urge against the book, they say--\"Well, after all, you see, Mr. Darwin's explanation of the 'Origin of Species' is not good for much, because, in the long run, he admits that he does not know how organic matter began to exist. But if you admit any special creation for the first particle of organic matter you may just as well admit it for all the rest; five hundred or five thousand distinct creations are just as intelligible, and just as little difficult to understand, as one.\" The answer to these cavils is two-fold. In the first place, all human inquiry must stop somewhere; all our knowledge and all our investigation cannot take us beyond the limits set by the finite and restricted character of our faculties, or destroy the endless unknown, which accompanies, like its shadow, the endless procession of phenomena. So far as I can venture to offer an opinion on such a matter, the purpose of our being in existence, the highest object that human beings can set before themselves, is not the pursuit of any such chimera as the annihilation of the unknown; but it is simply the unwearied endeavour to remove its boundaries a little further from our little sphere of action.  I wonder if any historian would for a moment admit the objection, that it is preposterous to trouble ourselves about the history of the Roman Empire, because we do not know anything positive about the origin and first building of the city of Rome! Would it be a fair objection to urge, respecting the sublime discoveries of a Newton, or a Kepler, those great philosophers, whose discoveries have been of the profoundest benefit and service to all men,--to say to them--\"After all that you have told us as to how the planets revolve, and how they are maintained in their orbits, you cannot tell us what is the cause of the origin of the sun, moon, and stars. So what is the use of what you have done?\" Yet these objections would not be one whit more preposterous than the objections which have been made to the 'Origin of Species.' Mr. Darwin, then, had a perfect right to limit his inquiry as he pleased, and the only question for us--the inquiry being so limited--is to ascertain whether the method of his inquiry is sound or unsound; whether he has obeyed the canons which must guide and govern all investigation, or whether he has broken them; and it was because our inquiry this evening is essentially limited to that question, that I spent a good deal of time in a former lecture (which, perhaps, some of you thought might have been better employed), in endeavouring to illustrate the method and nature of scientific inquiry in general. We shall now have to put in practice the principles that I then laid down.  I stated to you in substance, if not in words, that wherever there are complex masses of phenomena to be inquired into, whether they be phenomena of the affairs of daily life, or whether they belong to the more abstruse and difficult problems laid before the philosopher, our course of proceeding in unravelling that complex chain of phenomena with a view to get at its cause, is always the same; in all cases we must invent an hypothesis; we must place before ourselves some more or less likely supposition respecting that cause; and then, having assumed an hypothesis, having supposed cause for the phenomena in question, we must endeavour, on the one hand, to demonstrate our hypothesis, or, on the other, to upset and reject it altogether, by testing it in three ways. We must, in the first place, be prepared to prove that the supposed causes of the phenomena exist in nature; that they are what the logicians call 'vera causae'--true causes;--in the next place, we should be prepared to show that the assumed causes of the phenomena are competent to produce such phenomena as those which we wish to explain by them; and in the last place, we ought to be able to show that no other known causes are competent to produce those phenomena. If we can succeed in satisfying these three conditions we shall have demonstrated our hypothesis; or rather I ought to say we shall have proved it as far as certainty is possible for us; for, after all, there is no one of our surest convictions which may not be upset, or at any rate modified by a further accession of knowledge. It was because it satisfied these conditions that we accepted the hypothesis as to the disappearance of the tea-pot and spoons in the case I supposed in a previous lecture; we found that our hypothesis on that subject was tenable and valid, because the supposed cause existed in nature, because it was competent to account for the phenomena, and because no other known cause was competent to account for them; and it is upon similar grounds that any hypothesis you choose to name is accepted in science as tenable and valid.  What is Mr. Darwin's hypothesis? As I apprehend it--for I have put it into a shape more convenient for common purposes than I could find 'verbatim' in his book--as I apprehend it, I say, it is, that all the phenomena of organic nature, past and present, result from, or are caused by, the inter-action of those properties of organic matter, which we have called ATAVISM and VARIABILITY, with the CONDITIONS OF EXISTENCE; or, in other words,--given the existence of organic matter, its tendency to transmit its properties, and its tendency occasionally to vary; and, lastly, given the conditions of existence by which organic matter is surrounded--that these put together are the causes of the Present and of the Past conditions of ORGANIC NATURE.  Such is the hypothesis as I understand it. Now let us see how it will stand the various tests which I laid down just now. In the first place, do these supposed causes of the phenomena exist in nature? Is it the fact that in nature these properties of organic matter--atavism and variability--and those phenomena which we have called the conditions of existence,--is it true that they exist? Well, of course, if they do not exist, all that I have told you in the last three or four lectures must be incorrect, because I have been attempting to prove that they do exist, and I take it that there is abundant evidence that they do exist; so far, therefore, the hypothesis does not break down.  But in the next place comes a much more difficult inquiry:--Are the causes indicated competent to give rise to the phenomena of organic nature? I suspect that this is indubitable to a certain extent. It is demonstrable, I think, as I have endeavoured to show you, that they are perfectly competent to give rise to all the phenomena which are exhibited by RACES in nature. Furthermore, I believe that they are quite competent to account for all that we may call purely structural phenomena which are exhibited by SPECIES in nature. On that point also I have already enlarged somewhat. Again, I think that the causes assumed are competent to account for most of the physiological characteristics of species, and I not only think that they are competent to account for them, but I think that they account for many things which otherwise remain wholly unaccountable and inexplicable, and I may say incomprehensible. For a full exposition of the grounds on which this conviction is based, I must refer you to Mr. Darwin's work; all that I can do now is to illustrate what I have said by two or three cases taken almost at random.
