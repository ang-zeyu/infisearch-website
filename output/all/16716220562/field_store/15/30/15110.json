The main features of the motion, as shown in the diagram, required      only two arms for their expression; one arm revolving with the      average motion of the planet, and the other revolving with the      apparent motion of the sun, and always pointing in the same      direction as the single arm supposed to carry the sun. This last      fact is of course because the motion to be represented does not      really belong to the planet at all, but to the earth, and so all      the main epicyclic motions for the superior planets were the same.      As for the inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) they only appear      to oscillate like the bob of a pendulum about the sun, and so it is      very obvious that they must be really revolving round it. An      ancient Egyptian system perceived this truth; but the Ptolemaic      system imagined them to revolve round the earth like the rest, with      an artificial system of epicycles to prevent their ever getting far      away from the neighbourhood of the sun.       It is easy now to see how the Copernican system explains the main      features of planetary motion, the stations and retrogressions,      quite naturally and without any complexity.       [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Egyptian system.]       Let the outer circle represent the orbit of Jupiter, and the inner      circle the orbit of the earth, which is moving faster than Jupiter      (since Jupiter takes 4332 days to make one revolution); then      remember that the apparent position of Jupiter is referred to the      infinitely distant fixed stars and refer to fig. 12.       Let E_1, E_2, &c., be successive positions of the earth; J_1,      J_2, &c., corresponding positions of Jupiter. Produce the lines      E_1 J_1, E_2 J_2, &c., to an enormously greater circle      outside, and it will be seen that the termination of these lines,      representing apparent positions of Jupiter among the stars,      advances while the earth goes from E_1 to E_3; is almost      stationary from somewhere about E_3 to E_4; and recedes from      E_4 to E_5; so that evidently the recessions of Jupiter are      only apparent, and are due to the orbital motion of the earth. The      apparent complications in the path of Jupiter, shown in Fig. 10,      are seen to be caused simply by the motion of the earth, and to be      thus completely and easily explained.       [Illustration: FIG. 12.--True orbits of Earth and Jupiter.]       The same thing for an inferior planet, say Mercury, is even still      more easily seen (_vide_ figure 13).       The motion of Mercury is direct from M'' to M''', retrograde from      M''' to M'', and stationary at M'' and M'''. It appears to      oscillate, taking 72·5 days for its direct swing, and 43·5 for its      return swing.       [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Orbit of Mercury and Earth.]       On this system no artificiality is required to prevent Mercury's      ever getting far from the sun: the radius of its orbit limits its      real and apparent excursions. Even if the earth were stationary,      the motions of Mercury and Venus would not be _essentially_      modified, but the stations and retrogressions of the superior      planets, Mars, Jupiter, &c., would wholly cease.       The complexity of the old mode of regarding apparent motion may be      illustrated by the case of a traveller in a railway train unaware      of his own motion. It is as though trees, hedges, distant objects,      were all flying past him and contorting themselves as you may see      the furrows of a ploughed field do when travelling, while you      yourself seem stationary amidst it all. How great a simplicity      would be introduced by the hypothesis that, after all, these things      might be stationary and one's self moving.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Copernican system as frequently represented. But the cometary orbit is a much later addition, and no attempt is made to show the relative distances of the planets.]  Now you are not to suppose that the system of Copernicus swept away the entire doctrine of epicycles; that doctrine can hardly be said to be swept away even now. As a description of a planet's motion it is not incorrect, though it is geometrically cumbrous. If you describe the motion of a railway train by stating that every point on the rim of each wheel describes a cycloid with reference to the earth, and a circle with reference to the train, and that the motion of the train is compounded of these cycloidal and circular motions, you will not be saying what is false, only what is cumbrous.  The Ptolemaic system demanded large epicycles, depending on the motion of the earth, these are what Copernicus overthrew; but to express the minuter details of the motion smaller epicycles remained, and grew more and more complex as observations increased in accuracy, until a greater man than either Copernicus or Ptolemy, viz. Kepler, replaced them all by a simple ellipse.  One point I must not omit from this brief notice of the work of Copernicus. Hipparchus had, by most sagacious interpretation of certain observations of his, discovered a remarkable phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes. It was a discovery of the first magnitude, and such as would raise to great fame the man who should have made it in any period of the world's history, even the present. It is scarcely expressible in popular language, and without some technical terms; but I can try.  The plane of the earth's orbit produced into the sky gives the apparent path of the sun throughout a year. This path is known as the ecliptic, because eclipses only happen when the moon is in it. The sun keeps to it accurately, but the planets wander somewhat above and below it (fig. 9), and the moon wanders a good deal. It is manifest, however, in order that there may be an eclipse of any kind, that a straight line must be able to be drawn through earth and moon and sun (not necessarily through their centres of course), and this is impossible unless some parts of the three bodies are in one plane, viz. the ecliptic, or something very near it. The ecliptic is a great circle of the sphere, and is usually drawn on both celestial and terrestrial globes.  The earth's equator also produced into the sky, where it may still be called the equator (sometimes it is awkwardly called \"the equinoctial\"), gives another great circle inclined to the ecliptic and cutting it at two opposite points, labelled respectively [Aries symbol] and [Libra symbol], and together called \"the equinoxes.\" The reason for the name is that when the sun is in that part of the ecliptic it is temporarily also on the equator, and hence is symmetrically situated with respect to the earth's axis of rotation, and consequently day and night are equal all over the earth.  Well, Hipparchus found, by plotting the position of the sun for a long time,[2] that these points of intersection, or equinoxes, were not stationary from century to century, but slowly moved among the stars, moving as it were to meet the sun, so that he gets back to one of these points again 20 minutes 23-1/4 seconds before it has really completed a revolution, _i.e._ before the true year is fairly over. This slow movement forward of the goal-post is called precession--the precession of the equinoxes. (One result of it is to shorten our years by about 20 minutes each; for the shortened period has to be called a year, because it is on the position of the sun with respect to the earth's axis that our seasons depend.) Copernicus perceived that, assuming the motion of the earth, a clearer account of this motion could be given. The ordinary approximate statement concerning the earth's axis is that it remains parallel to itself, _i.e._ has a fixed direction as the earth moves round the sun. But if, instead of being thus fixed, it be supposed to have a slow movement of revolution, so that it traces out a cone in the course of about 26,000 years, then, since the equator of course goes with it, the motion of its intersection with the fixed ecliptic is so far accounted for. That is to say, the precession of the equinoxes is seen to be dependent on, and caused by, a slow conical movement of the earth's axis.  The prolongation of each end of the earth's axis into the sky, or the celestial north and south poles, will thus slowly trace out an approximate circle among the stars; and the course of the north pole during historic time is exhibited in the annexed diagram.  It is now situated near one of the stars of the Lesser Bear, which we therefore call the Pole star; but not always was it so, nor will it be so in the future. The position of the north pole 4000 years ago is shown in the figure; and a revolution will be completed in something like 26,000 years.[3]  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--Slow movement of the north pole in a circle among the stars. (Copied from Sir R. Ball.)]  This perception of the conical motion of the earth's axis was a beautiful generalization of Copernik's, whereby a multitude of facts were grouped into a single phenomenon. Of course he did not explain the motion of the axis itself. He stated the fact that it so moved, and I do not suppose it ever struck him to seek for an explanation.  An explanation was given later, and that a most complete one; but the idea even of seeking for it is a brilliant and striking one: the achievement of the explanation by a single individual in the way it actually was accomplished is one of the most astounding things in the history of science; and were it not that the same individual accomplished a dozen other things, equally and some still more extraordinary, we should rank that man as one of the greatest astronomers that ever lived.  As it is, he is Sir Isaac Newton.  We are to remember, then, as the life-work of Copernicus, that he placed the sun in its true place as the centre of the solar system, instead of the earth; that he greatly simplified the theory of planetary"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28613"],["title","Pioneers of Science (#5)"],["body","by this step, and also by the simpler epicyclic chain which now sufficed, and which he worked out mathematically; that he exhibited the precession of the equinoxes (discovered by Hipparchus) as due to a conical motion of the earth's axis; and that, by means of his simpler theory and more exact planetary tables, he reduced to some sort of order the confused chaos of the Ptolemaic system, whose accumulation of complexity and of outstanding errors threatened to render astronomy impossible by the mere burden of its detail.  There are many imperfections in his system, it is true; but his great merit is that he dared to look at the facts of Nature with his own eyes, unhampered by the prejudice of centuries. A system venerable with age, and supported by great names, was universally believed, and had been believed for centuries. To doubt this system, and to seek after another and better one, at a time when all men's minds were governed by tradition and authority, and when to doubt was sin--this required a great mind and a high character. Such a mind and such a character had this monk of Frauenburg. And it is interesting to notice that the so-called religious scruples of smaller and less truly religious men did not affect Copernicus; it was no dread of consequences to one form of truth that led him to delay the publication of the other form of truth specially revealed to him. In his dedication he says:--  \"If there be some babblers who, though ignorant of all mathematics, take upon them to judge of these things, and dare to blame and cavil at my work, because of some passage of Scripture which they have wrested to their own purpose, I regard them not, and will not scruple to hold their judgment in contempt.\"  I will conclude with the words of one of his biographers (Mr. E.J.C. Morton):--  \"Copernicus cannot be said to have flooded with light the dark places of nature--in the way that one stupendous mind subsequently did--but still, as we look back through the long vista of the history of science, the dim Titanic figure of the old monk seems to rear itself out of the dull flats around it, pierces with its head the mists that overshadow them, and catches the first gleam of the rising sun,    \"'... like some iron peak, by the Creator     Fired with the red glow of the rushing morn.'\"     DATES AND SUMMARY OF FACTS FOR LECTURE II   Copernicus lived from 1473 to 1543, and was contemporary with Paracelsus and Raphael.    Tycho Brahé     from 1546 to 1601.   Kepler          from 1571 to 1630.   Galileo         from 1564 to 1642.   Gilbert         from 1540 to 1603.   Francis Bacon   from 1561 to 1626.   Descartes       from 1596 to 1650.  _A sketch of Tycho Brahé's life and work._ Tycho was a Danish noble, born on his ancestral estate at Knudstorp, near Helsinborg, in 1546. Adopted by his uncle, and sent to the University of Copenhagen to study law. Attracted to astronomy by the occurrence of an eclipse on its predicted day, August 21st, 1560. Began to construct astronomical instruments, especially a quadrant and a sextant. Observed at Augsburg and Wittenberg. Studied alchemy, but was recalled to astronomy by the appearance of a new star. Overcame his aristocratic prejudices, and delivered a course of lectures at Copenhagen, at the request of the king. After this he married a peasant girl. Again travelled and observed in Germany. In 1576 was sent for to Denmark by Frederick II., and established in the island of Huen, with an endowment enabling him to devote his life to astronomy. Built Uraniburg, furnished it with splendid instruments, and became the founder of accurate instrumental astronomy. His theories were poor, but his observations were admirable. In 1592 Frederick died, and five years later, Tycho was impoverished and practically banished. After wandering till 1599, he was invited to Prague by the Emperor Rudolf, and there received John Kepler among other pupils. But the sentence of exile was too severe, and he died in 1601, aged 54 years.  A man of strong character, untiring energy, and devotion to accuracy, his influence on astronomy has been immense.     LECTURE II  TYCHO BRAHÉ AND THE EARLIEST OBSERVATORY   We have seen how Copernicus placed the earth in its true position in the solar system, making it merely one of a number of other worlds revolving about a central luminary. And observe that there are two phenomena to be thus accounted for and explained: first, the diurnal revolution of the heavens; second, the annual motion of the sun among the stars.  The effect of the diurnal motion is conspicuous to every one, and explains the rising, southing, and setting of the whole visible firmament. The effect of the annual motion, _i.e._ of the apparent annual motion, of the sun among the stars, is less obvious, but it may be followed easily enough by observing the stars visible at any given time of evening at different seasons of the year. At midnight, for instance, the position of the sun is definite, viz. due north always, but the constellation which at that time is due south or is rising or setting varies with the time of year; an interval of one month producing just the same effect on the appearance of the constellations as an interval of two hours does (because the day contains twice as many hours as the year contains months), _e.g._ the sky looks the same at midnight on the 1st of October as it does at 10 p.m. on the 1st of November.  All these simple consequences of the geocentric as opposed to the heliocentric point of view were pointed out by Copernicus, in addition to his greater work of constructing improved planetary tables on the basis of his theory. But it must be admitted that he himself felt the hypothesis of the motion of the earth to be a difficulty. Its acceptance is by no means such an easy and childish matter as we are apt now to regard it, and the hostility to it is not at all surprising. The human race, after having ridiculed and resisted the truth for a long time, is apt to end in accepting it so blindly and unimaginatively as to fail to recognize the real achievement of its first propounders, or the difficulties which they had to overcome. The majority of men at the present day have grown accustomed to hear the motion of the earth spoken of: their acceptance of it means nothing: the attitude of the paradoxer who denies it is more intelligent.  It is not to be supposed that the idea of thus explaining some of the phenomena of the heavens, especially the daily motion of the entire firmament, by a diurnal rotation of the earth had not struck any one. It was often at this time referred to as the Pythagorean theory, and it had been taught, I believe, by Aristarchus. But it was new to the modern world, and it had the great weight of Aristotle against it. Consequently, for long after Copernicus, only a few leading spirits could be found to support it, and the long-established venerable Ptolemaic system continued to be taught in all Universities.  The main objections to the motion of the earth were such as the following:--  1. The motion is unfelt and difficult to imagine.       That it is unfelt is due to its uniformity, and can be explained      mechanically. That it is difficult to imagine is and remains true,      but a most important lesson we have to learn is that difficulty of      conception is no valid argument against reality.  2. That the stars do not alter their relative positions according to the season of the year, but the constellations preserve always the same aspect precisely, even to careful measurement.       This is indeed a difficulty, and a great one. In June the earth is      184 million miles away from where it was in December: how can we      see precisely the same fixed stars? It is not possible, unless they      are at a practically infinite distance. That is the only answer      that can be given. It was the tentative answer given by Copernicus.      It is the correct answer. Not only from every position of the      earth, but from every planet of the solar system, the same      constellations are visible, and the stars have the same aspect. The      whole immensity of the solar system shrinks to practically a point      when confronted with the distance of the stars.       Not, however, so entirely a speck as to resist the terrific      accuracy of the present century, and their microscopic relative      displacement with the season of the year has now at length been      detected, and the distance of many thereby measured.  3. That, if the earth revolved round the sun, Mercury and Venus ought to show phases like the moon.       So they ought. Any globe must show phases if it live nearer the sun      than we do and if we go round it, for we shall see varying amounts      of its illuminated half. The only answer that Copernicus could give      to this was that they might be difficult to see without extra      powers of sight, but he ventured to predict that the phases would      be seen if ever our powers of vision should be enhanced.  4. That if the earth moved, or even revolved on its own axis, a stone or other dropped body ought to be left far behind.       This difficulty is not a real one, like the two last, and it is      based on an ignorance of the laws of mechanics, which had not at      that time been formulated. We know now that a ball dropped from a      high tower, so far from lagging, drops a minute trifle _in front_      of the foot of a perpendicular, because the top of the tower is      moving a trace faster than the bottom, by reason of the diurnal      rotation. But, ignoring this, a stone dropped from the lamp of a      railway carriage drops in the centre of the floor, whether the      carriage be moving steadily or standing still; a slant direction of      fall could only be detected if the carriage were being accelerated      or if the brake were applied. A body dropped from a moving carriage      shares the motion of the carriage, and starts"]]]
