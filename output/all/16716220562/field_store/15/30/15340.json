Parasites are usually small, being limited by their host. Saprophytes are not thus limited for food supply and it is possible to build up large plants such as the common mushroom group, puff-balls, etc.  The spores are the seeds or reproductive bodies of the mushroom. They are very fine, and invisible to the naked eye except when collected together in great masses. Underneath mushrooms, frequently, the grass or wood will be white or plainly discolored from the spores. The hymenium is the surface or part of the plant which bears the spores. The hymenophore is the part which supports the hymenium.  In the common mushroom, and in fact many others, the spores develop on a certain club-like cell, called basidium (plural, basidia), on each of which four spores usually develop. In morels these cells are elongated into cylindrical membranous sacs called asci, in each of which eight spores are usually developed. The spores will be found of various colors, shapes, and sizes, a fact which will be of great assistance to the student in locating strange species and genera. In germination the spores send out slender threads which Botanists call mycelium, but which common readers know as spawn.  The method and place of spore development furnish a basis for the classification of fungi. The best way to acquire a thorough knowledge of both our edible and poisonous mushrooms is to study them in the light of the primary characters employed in their classification and their natural relation to each other.  There is a wide difference of opinion as to the classification of mushrooms. Perhaps the most simple and satisfactory is that of Underwood and Cook. They arrange them under six groups:    1. Basidiomycetes--those in which the spores or reproductive bodies         are naked or external as shown in illustration 2 on page 15.    2. Ascomycetes--those in which the spores are inclosed in sacs or         asci. These sacs are very clearly represented in illustration         Figure 4 on page 18. This will include the Morels, Pezizæ,         Pyrenomycetes, Tuberaceæ, Sphairiacei, etc.    3. Physcomycetes--including the Mucorini, Saprolegniaceæ, and         Peronosporeæ. Potato rot and downy mildew on grape vines belong         to this family.    4. Myxomycetes--Slime moulds.    5. Saccharomycetes--Yeast fungi.    6. Schizomycetes--are minute, unicellular Protophytes which reproduce         mainly by transverse fission.   CLASS, FUNGI--SUB-CLASS, BASIDIOMYCETES.  This class will include all gill-bearing fungi, Polyporus, Boletus, Hydnum, etc.  Fungi of this class are divided into four natural groups:    1. Hymenomycetes.   2. Gasteromycetes.   3. Uredinæ.   4. Ustilagineæ.   GROUP 1--HYMENOMYCETES.  Under this group will be placed all fungi composed of membranes, fleshy, woody, or gelatinous, whether growing on the ground or on wood. The hymenium, or spore-bearing surface, is external at an early stage in the life of the plant. The spores are borne on basidia as explained in Figure 2, page 6. When the spores ripen they fall to the ground or are carried by the wind to a host that presents all the conditions necessary for germination; there they produce the mycelia or white thread-like vines that one may have noticed in plowing sod, in old chip piles, or decayed wood. If one will examine these threads there will be found small knots which will in time develop into the full grown mushroom. Hymenomycetes are divided into six families:    1. Agaricaceæ. Hymenium with gills.   2. Polyporaceæ. Hymenium with pores.   3. Hydnaceæ. Hymenium with spines.   4. Thelephoraceæ. Hymenium horizontal and mostly on the under surface.   5. Clavariaceæ. Hymenium on a smooth club-shaped surface.   6. Tremellaceæ. Hymenium even and superior. Gelatinous fungi.   FAMILY 1--AGARICACEAE.  [Illustration: Figure 7.--Spore-print of Agaricus arvensis.]  In the Agaricaceæ or common mushrooms, and in all other of similar structure, the spore-producing membranes are found on the under surface of the cap. They consist of thin lamellæ, or gills, attached by the upper edge to the cap and extending from the stem to the margin of the cap. Very frequently that space may be entirely utilized by shorter lamellæ, or gills, intervening between the longer, especially toward the margin of the cap. In a few species where the stem seems to be wanting, or where it is attached to the side of the cap, the lamellæ, or gills, radiate from the point of attachment or from the lateral stem to other parts of the circumference of the cap. Berkeley gives the following characteristics: Hymenium, inferior, spread over easily divisible gills or plates, radiating from a center or stem, which may be either simple or branched.  This family includes the following genera:    1. Agaricus--Gills, not melting, edge acute; including all the         sub-genera which have been elevated to the rank of genera.    2. Coprinus--Gills deliquescent, spores black.    3. Cortinarius--Gills persistent, veil spider-web-like, terrestrial.    4. Paxillus--Gills separating from the hymenophorum and decurrent.    5. Gomphidius--Gills branched and decurrent, pileus top-shaped.    6. Bolbitius--Gills becoming moist, spores colored.    7. Lactarius--Gills milky, terrestrial.    8. Russula--Gills equal, rigid, and brittle, terrestrial.    9. Marasmius--Gills thick, tough, hymenium dry.    10. Hygrophorus--Stem confluent with the hymenophorum; gills sharp         edged.    11. Cantharellus--Gills thick, branched, rounded edge.    12. Lentinus--Pileus hairy, hard, tough; gills, tough, unequal,         toothed; on logs and stumps.    13. Lenzites--Whole plant corky; gills simple or branched.    14. Trogia--Gills venose, fold-like, channelled.    15. Panus--Gills corky, with acute edge.    16. Nyctalis--Veil universal; gills broad, often parasitic.    17. Schizophyllum--Gills corky, split longitudinally.    18. Xerotus--Gills tough, fold-like.  Therefore the gill-bearing fungi are known under the family name, Agaricaceæ, or more generally known as Agarics.  [Illustration: Figure 8.--Spore-print of Hypholoma sublatertium.]  This family is divided into five series, according to the color of their spores. The spores when seen in masses possess certain colors, white, rosy, rusty, purple-brown and black. Therefore the first and most important part to be determined in locating a mushroom is to ascertain the color of the spores. To do this, take a fresh, perfect, and fully developed specimen, remove the stem from the cap. Place the cap with the gills downward on the surface of dark velvety paper, if you suspect the spores to be white. Invert a finger bowl or a bell glass over the cap to keep the air from blowing the spores away. If the spores should be colored, white paper should be used. If the specimen is left too long the spore deposit will continue upward between the gills and it may reach an eighth of an inch in height, in which case if great care is taken in removing the cap there will be a perfect likeness of the gills and also the color of the spores.  [Illustration: Figure 9.--Spore-print of a Flammula.]  There are two ways of making these spore prints quite permanent. First take a piece of thin rice paper, muscilage it and allow it to dry, then proceed as above. In this way the print will stand handling quite a little. Another way, and that used to prepare the spore-prints in these photographs, is to obtain the spore-print upon Japanese paper as in the preceding method, then by an atomizer spray the print gently and carefully with a fixative such as is used in fixing charcoal drawings. Success in making spore-prints requires both time and care, but the satisfaction they give is ample recompense for the trouble. It is more difficult to obtain good prints from the white-spored mushrooms than from those bearing colored spores, because it is hard to obtain a black paper having a dull velvety surface, and the spores will not adhere well to a smooth-finished, glossy paper. For the prints illustrated I am indebted to Mrs. Blackford.  [Illustration: Figure 10.--Spore-print of a Boletus.]  If the plant is dry it is well to moisten the fingerbowl or bell-glass on the inside before placing it over the mushroom. The spores of Boleti, and, indeed, all fungi can be caught and fixed in the same way.  From the study of these spore-prints we shall find five different colors of spores. This family is, therefore, divided into five series, determined by the color of the spores, which are always constant in color, size and shape.  The five series will be treated in the following order:    1. The white-spored Agarics.   2. The rosy-spored Agarics.   3. The rusty-spored Agarics.   4. The purple-brown-spored Agarics.   5. The black-spored Agarics.   =ANALYTICAL KEY.=  This key is largely based upon Cooke's analytical key. Its use will help to locate the plant in hand in the genus to which it belongs.  The first thing the student should do is to determine the color of the spore if it is not evident. This is best done according to the plan described on page 15.  The plant should be fresh and mature. Careful attention should be given to different stages of development. The habit of the plant should be considered; then, as soon as the color of the spores is determined, it will be an easy matter to locate the genus by means of the key.   GROUP I--HYMENOMYCETES.

The species bearing the white spores seem to be higher in type than those producing colored spores. Most of the former are firmer, while the black spored specimens soon deliquesce. The white spores are usually oval, sometimes round, and in many cases quite spiny. All white-spored specimens will be found in clean places.   _Amanita. Pers._  _Amanita_ is supposed to be derived from Mount Amanus, an ancient name of a range separating Cilicia from Syria. It is supposed that Galen first brought specimens of this fungus from that region.  The genus _Amanita_ has both a volva and veil. The spores are white and the stem is readily separable from the cap. The volva is universal at first, enveloping the young plant, yet distinct and free from the cuticle of the pileus.  This genus contains some of the most deadly poisonous mushrooms, although a few are known to be very good. There is a large number of species--about 75 being known, 42 of which have been found in this country--a few being quite common in this state. All the Amanita are terrestrial plants, mostly solitary in their habits, and chiefly found in the woods, or in well wooded grounds.  In the button stage it resembles a small egg or puff-ball, as will be seen in Figure 6, page 11, and great care should be taken to distinguish it from the latter, if one is hunting puff-balls to eat; yet the danger is not great, since the volva usually breaks before the plant comes through the ground.   _Amanita phalloides. Fr._  THE DEADLY AMANITA.  [Illustration: Figure 11.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. Showing volva at the base, cap dark.]  [Illustration: Figure 12.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. White form showing volva, scaly stem, ring.]  _Phalloides_ means phallus-like. This plant and its related species are deadly poisonous. For this reason the plant should be carefully studied and thoroughly known by every mushroom hunter. In different localities, and sometimes in the same locality, the plant will appear in very different shades of color. There are also variations in the way in which the volva is ruptured, as well as in the character of the stem.  The beginner will imagine he has a new species often, till he becomes thoroughly acquainted with all the idiosyncrasies of this plant.  The pileus is smooth, even, viscid when young and moist, frequently adorned with a few fragments of the volva, white, grayish white, sometimes smoky-brown; whether the pileus be white, oyster-color or smoky-brown, the center of the cap will be several shades darker than the margin. The plant changes from a knob or egg-shape when young, to almost flat when fully expanded. Many plants have a marked umbo on the top of the cap and the rim of the cap may be slightly turned up.  The gills are always white, wide, ventricose, rounded next to the stem, and free from it.  The stem is smooth, white unless in cases where the cap is dark, then the stem of those plants are apt to be of the same color, tapering upward as in the specimen (Fig. 11); stuffed, then hollow, inclined to discolor when handled.  The volva of this species is quite variable and more or less buried in the ground, where careful observation will reveal it.  One need never confound this species with the meadow mushroom, for the spores of that are always purple-brown, while a spore-print of this will always reveal white spores. I have seen a slight tint of pink in the gills of the A. phalloides but the spores were always white. Until one knows thoroughly both Lepiota naucina and A. phalloides before eating the former he should always hunt carefully for the remains of a volva and a bulbous base in the soil.  This plant is quite conspicuous and inviting in all of its various shades of color. It is found in woods, and along the margin of woods, and sometimes on lawns. It is from four to eight inches high and the pileus from three to five inches broad. There"]]]
