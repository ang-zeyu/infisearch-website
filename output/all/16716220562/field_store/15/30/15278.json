Redbird had even heard that while in mourning Owl Carver had predicted that Iron Knife would one day be killed by a man whose mother had also died giving birth to him. No one dared speak of these things in Iron Knife's presence.  Redbird knew she had more of the shaman in her than Iron Knife. She knew, as her father did, that right now Gray Cloud was in terrible danger.  \"Where have you been?\" Wind Bends Grass called out from the shadows. She and Redbird's sisters were already bedded down for the night on buffalo-robe pallets along the wall of the wickiup. Wind Bends Grass and her two little girls, Wild Grape and Robin's Nest, slept together for greater warmth.  \"I was down in the woods, seeing to our horses,\" Redbird lied. She had been near the horses, but only to watch for Gray Cloud.  \"I needed you here,\" Wind Bends Grass said crossly. \"I was stringing beads for a new sash for your father, and your sisters are too small to help me.\"  _Does my mother want me to string beads while Gray Cloud freezes to death?_  \"The snow was heavy on the horses' backs,\" Redbird said. \"They needed someone to brush them off.\"  \"Nonsense,\" said Wind Bends Grass, sitting up. \"You were waiting and worrying for that pale eyes boy. And meanwhile Wolf Paw came again to speak to your father today. How can you refuse the son of the mighty Black Hawk and think of marrying that boy who has no father? His mother lay with a pale eyes and got Gray Cloud. The pale eyes lived with her only five summers and then ran away. He would have run away sooner, but our people held him prisoner because of the war.\"  Redbird heard muffled giggles from the bedding beside her mother. Her little sisters thought the story of Gray Cloud's parentage funny. Wind Bends Grass struck with her hand at the two shaking bundles.  \"Wolf Paw already has a wife,\" Redbird said.  \"He is a _man_,\" said Wind Bends Grass. \"A brave. He can make two wives, three wives, _four_ wives happy.\"  Rage at her mother for belittling Gray Cloud when he might be dying boiled up inside her and almost choked her. She bit her lip and held back the angry words. She hurt too much to want to quarrel.  She took off her fur cap, wet boots and mittens and laid them near the fire. Keeping on her buffalo-hide cloak, her doeskin dress and leggings, she lay down on her own pallet, padded with blankets and prairie grass. Curling up her legs, she wrapped the heavy cloak around herself.  The wickiup was quiet, except for the popping of burning twigs.  Redbird knew that her fear for Gray Cloud, deepening as the night deepened, would keep her awake. She decided that when they were all asleep, she would go back to the wickiup of Sun Woman and watch with her.  She lay staring at the blackened ceiling that arched over her head. Partly obscured by drifting smoke, the curved poles cast deep shadows in the flickering light. Iron Knife had laid fresh branches on the fire. Smoke stung her eyes.  Sometimes she thought she saw spirit messages above her in the patterns of the twigs interwoven with the larger poles, and in the cracks in the sheets of bark that lined the inside of the wickiup. But tonight her mind was too absorbed in Gray Cloud's fate to try to read the patterns.  Over the breathing of the others she could hear the voice of the wind humming across the roof. From time to time it would rise to a howl, and the framework of the wickiup would creak and crackle under the strain. Even though there was a fire and the wickiup was tightly sealed, Redbird felt the cold seeping up from the earth. Its icy fingers touched her body through the buffalo robe. Her dread for Gray Cloud turned to heart-pounding panic.  _If I feel the cold, here in my warm wickiup, what must it be like for him?_  After the snow stopped falling, the cold of this night would be the cold that killed without mercy. Such a deepening cold often seemed to follow a great snow. After a night like this, women would find rabbit and deer lying in the drifts near the camp. The animals trying to get close to warmth had overcome their fear of people, but the cold had leeched the life from their bodies. Even the strongest animals might die. Only people, to whom Earthmaker had given the knowledge of how to shelter themselves and make fire, could withstand this death-dealing cold.  Her fists clenched on the blanket. Her heart filled up with anger. Anger against the cold, against her mother, who despised Gray Cloud, against Owl Carver, who had sent him to almost certain death. Against the spirits, who had permitted this. Out of her anger blazed up a fierce resolve.  _I will not let you take him from me._  If everyone else accepted Gray Cloud's death, she did not. She would go to him. She would go to Sun Woman and gather what medicines she might have, anything that would keep the cold from draining the last bit of warmth and strength out of Gray Cloud.  _Have you not been told what the tribe decrees for anyone who disturbs a man on a spirit journey, even to help him?_  Her anger turned to fear, and she lay there, not wanting to move, knowing that if she threw off the blankets and stood up, she would be taking the first step on a path that might be her death.  But then she thought of that terrible wind, sharp as a pale eyes' steel knife, shrieking around Gray Cloud's body. If she did something now, he might live; and if she did nothing, he was sure to die.  She had loved Gray Cloud for as long as she could remember. To be without him--she could not bear to think of it.  She had heard tales of women who died fighting beside their men. Yes, better to die with Gray Cloud, to walk the Trail of Souls into the West with him, than live a long life grieving for him.  She listened to the sounds of the sleepers, Iron Knife's rumbling snore, Wind Bends Grass's heavy breathing that sounded like her name, the rustlings and murmurings of Wild Grape and Robin's Nest.  Owl Carver still had not come in, and he might stay out there most of the night. She dared not wait any longer. She would have to face him.  Silently she pushed off her coverings and stood up. She quickly put back on her fur cap, boots and mittens.  The deepened cold bit into her cheeks like a weasel's teeth. While she had lain in the wickiup the snow, which had been falling continually for a night and a day, had stopped at last. The clouds overhead were breaking up, and she could see the full moon, round and bright as a pale eyes' silver coin. The Moon of Ice. It seemed frozen in place in the black sky. Stars glittered, little chips of ice. With her first indrawn breath the insides of her nostrils seemed to freeze, the air burned in her nose and throat. Her heart quailed for Gray Cloud.  The black figure of Owl Carver stood just where she had left him. How could he stand the cold this long?  Owl Carver turned to her. \"Where are you going?\"  \"To Sun Woman's wickiup, to watch with her.\"  She hated Owl Carver. He was the one who had sent Gray Cloud on this spirit journey, and now would do nothing to save him from death.  As if sensing her agony, he said, \"The spirits will watch over Gray Cloud.\"  She wanted to believe him, but she could not. She had begged him to help Gray Cloud, and he had commanded her to be silent. Now she had no more to say to him. She turned from Owl Carver.  He could have forbidden her to go to Sun Woman. But he would not do that. There was an understanding between Redbird and her father that she could not put into words. She knew that when he looked at her, he was torn between pride that she, the oldest of his children by Wind Bends Grass, possessed the same gifts he did, and sorrow that she was a woman, and could never be a shaman. And she knew that of all his children, he loved her best.  The snow, blown off the roofs of the wickiups, piled up in long drifts on their western sides. The east wind battered Redbird as she plodded through the winter camp toward one low, rounded black structure that rose out of the snow a bit apart from the others, on the north side of the camp.  The skinned quarters of small animals hung frozen from a rack outside Sun Woman's doorway. Redbird went up to the flap of buffalo hide and called, \"It is Redbird. May I come in?\"  Redbird heard Sun Woman undoing the sinew laces that held the flap down. She bent and entered.  In the firelight within Sun Woman's wickiup, Redbird saw agony in the tightness of the older woman's wide mouth and the clenching of her strong jaw. Gray Cloud's mother was built big, with broad shoulders and hips and large hands, but there was a helplessness now in the way she stood staring into the fire. Hanging from the curving bark wall behind her were her craft objects, a medicine bundle of deerskin, the carved figures of a naked man and a naked woman, clamshells to mold maple sugar, a horse's tail dyed red, a small drum and a flute.  Redbird spoke in a rush. \"If he dies I do not want to live.\" She feared that if she tried to address Sun Woman properly, her voice would be choked by sobs before she could say what demanded to be said.  She should not even suggest to Gray Cloud's mother that he might die. And she should not even hint to his mother of her love for Gray Cloud, when neither Sun Woman nor Owl Carver had spoken to each other of plans for their children. The band would be appalled at such rudeness.  \"Forgive me for speaking so to you,\" she said timidly.  Sun Woman smiled, but Redbird saw that there was much sadness in the smile. \"You know you can.\"  \"Yes, you are different,\" Redbird said.  _Even though the pale eyes killed your husband, you took a pale eyes into your wickiup._  This had happened more than fifteen winters ago, and Redbird knew it only as a story that her mother and other women liked to repeat while they did their work together. Sun Woman's husband, a brave named Dark Water, had been killed in a quarrel with pale eyes settlers."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28976"],["title","Shaman (#5)"],["body","spite of that, when Gray Cloud's pale eyes father came to live with the Sauk, Sun Woman had come to love him.  \"I am different, too,\" said Redbird. She wondered if Sun Woman knew how different she was. Most women lived from season to season, while Redbird sometimes thought about what the tribe might be doing, where they might be, ten summers from now.  Only two kinds of people thought the kind of long thoughts that came often to Redbird--chiefs and shamans. She sometimes imagined what it would be like to be a shaman. To live in accord with the gift Earthmaker gave her. She thought so often about it that it became a longing within her, even though she knew that such a thing could not be.  This, Redbird thought, was the most she could hope for--to become a medicine woman, like Gray Cloud's mother. A medicine woman had an important place in the band, but she was not listened to, as the shaman was.  Sun Woman reached out and laid her bare hand on top of Redbird's, which was still in a mitten. \"That is why I would be pleased if you and my son shared a wickiup.\"  Redbird was startled and, amidst her fear and grief for Gray Cloud, delighted. Truly, no mother ever spoke like this before words between parents had been exchanged. And to know that Sun Woman would accept her as her son's wife--wondrous!  But Gray Cloud might already be dead. \"How can we talk and smile so?\" she cried. \"He is up in the sacred cave, and the snow fell all last night and all day today.\"  Sun Woman shook her head. \"When I gave the boy to Owl Carver, I gave up the right to say what was to be done with him. Like Owl Carver, Gray Cloud belongs to the spirits now.\"  \"But the spirits--\" Redbird waved her hands helplessly. \"They protect as they like and they let death strike as they like.\"  A shadow of pain crossed Sun Woman's face. \"Do you say such things to hurt me?\"  Redbird was shocked. \"No!\"  \"Do you think I feel no pain?\"  Redbird felt tears filling her eyes, burning them. She wiped her face. \"I know you do.\"  Sun Woman brought her face closer to Redbird's, took Redbird's chin in her hand, and said, \"I do not show pain because I do not want to make others suffer with me. But you know what I feel.\"  Sun Woman opened her arms, and Redbird pressed her body against the bigger, older woman's. She felt Sun Woman's strength flow into her and she knew that she had found more comfort here than she ever would in the arms of her own mother.  In the firelit wickiup, Redbird looked around her, thinking that this was where Gray Cloud had been a baby. She looked at the bench where she knew he slept every night. Where he must sleep again.  \"Do you have anything to give a person who has been very cold for a long time?\" Redbird asked urgently.  \"Ah.\" Sun Woman went to the back of the wickiup and came back with a bundle of long, dark red peppers.  \"These peppers are grown far to the south, where the sacred mushroom and the bright blue stones come from. The longer you boil them, the hotter the water will get. He is to drink the water, but not swallow the peppers. If he is very cold, give him one pepper to chew on. That would bring the dead back to life. If you meet him before I do, this is how you can help him.\"  _She thinks I mean to try to meet him when he comes back._  \"I will go to him,\" Redbird said abruptly.  Sun Woman stared at her. \"You must not. If you interrupt his spirit journey it might kill him.\"  \"He has been in a cave for a night and a day, and this is the second night, colder than any night I can remember. My father watches for him, but he does not come. He could still be sitting in that cave. He has no fire. He has no food or water. The wind blows in from the river. The snow here at the camp is so deep that in some places the drifts are over my head. The cave could be full of snow. When he is suffering all this, how can you say that _I_ am a danger to him?\"  Sun Woman sat cross-legged on the rush mat floor and stared down at her hands folded in her lap. After a silence she looked up, and her grave, dark eyes held Redbird's.  \"You are a good young woman, and you love my son. But you must understand that the greater danger to Gray Cloud is not from the cold. If you try to wake Gray Cloud's body when his soul is gone from it, his spirit will never come back to his empty body. It will set its feet on the Trail of Souls and walk west, to the land of the dead.\"  Sun Woman's eyes shone, and the shadows and firelight gave her the face of an angry spirit. Redbird drew back.  \"I will not do that,\" she said. \"I promise you.\" But if she saw that Gray Cloud would surely die anyway, of freezing, would it not then be best to take the risk of waking him?  And what if he did wake on his own, but was too frozen to climb out of the cave and walk back to the camp by himself? Then he would need her help.  She decided that if she got to the cave and his spirit was still out of his body, she would do everything to help him short of waking him. She would build a fire near him. She would cover him with warm cloaks, try to warm his body if she could do that without disturbing him.  She boiled the peppers in a small tin pot set on stones over Sun Woman's low fire. After she had filled a skin with the pepper water, she rolled tinder and a pale eyes fire striker into a blanket. She put her hand on Sun Woman's snowshoes, leaning against a wall of the little wickiup, and Sun Woman nodded silently.  Redbird paddled over the snow with her head down, watching the long shadow she cast under the full moon on the sparkling white surface. Ahead, the leeward sides of the wickiups were rows of snowdrifts, all the same size. When she looked over her shoulder, their windward sides were like black holes in the snow. She could see her family's wickiup, but Owl Carver was no longer standing outside watching. She lifted her round wickerwork snowshoes high with each step. Even though she could walk over the snow, she would be exhausted, she realized, long before she pushed her way to the sacred cave.  Dogs barked. Fear made the back of her neck tingle, and she stood motionless. They might be Wolf Paw's dogs. But they did not come after her.  She heard no sounds of voices, or of people moving. She felt safe enough to keep walking.  But a feeling grew on her that someone was following her. She stopped again and listened and looked around. The wickiups were silent under their glistening blue-white hummocks. Being able to sense when she was being watched was one of the gifts she, like her father, possessed. But her eyes and ears did not confirm what her inner sense told her. She decided fear was confusing her, and she walked on.  She left the camp behind. On her right was gently rolling, snow-covered prairie. On her left were the woods that grew along the Ioway River. She saw the shadows of the horses among the trees, heard them snort and stamp their feet. Beside the woods ran the long trail leading to the bluff where the sacred cave overlooked the river. This close to the trees, she hoped, the snow would not be so deep.  A shadow appeared on the snow beside her. A bolt of terror stabbed her.  A powerful hand seized her arm. She felt paralyzed, like a rabbit about to be torn apart by a wildcat. She did not try to pull away. She could feel that the grip on her arm was too strong.  She turned slowly.  The moon was behind the man who held her, shadowing his face, but she could make out the glitter of piercing eyes, a stern mouth with strong lips under his brown fur turban.  \"Where are you going?\" Wolf Paw's fingers hurt her arm.  No words came to her. Frantically, she tried to think of some excuse for walking out so late on a night like this. He could have her killed, she thought, and terror made her feel like sinking into the snow.  But then she remembered some of the lore Sun Woman had taught her.  \"My father sent me--to look for a certain herb whose power is greatest when the moon is full.\"  He barked disdainfully. \"Gathering herbs when the snow is up to your knees?\"  \"It grows under the snow.\"  He brought his face so close to hers that his black eyes seemed to fill the world.  \"You cannot lie to me, Redbird. I see what you are doing. You are going to _him_.\"  \"No, no, I am looking for herbs.\"  \"What is _this_?\" With his free hand he tore away the blanket roll she had tied to her back and threw it into the snow. \"And _this_?\" He jerked on the water skin so hard that the strap broke, and he threw that down, too.  \"Do you need those things to help you find herbs?\" he shouted.  Trembling from head to foot, she felt herself starting to cry. She hated herself for showing such weakness in front of Wolf Paw. If she was to die, she wanted to be strong.  To her surprise, the sense that she was being watched from a distance came back again. There was someone else out here in the frozen darkness besides herself and Wolf Paw.  \"It is death to interfere with a spirit quest,\" Wolf Paw growled. \"The shaman's daughter of all people should know better than to break a holy law.\"  Her fear made her feel as cold, as breathless, as if she were already plunged into black, freezing water, swept along, an enormous weight of ice between her and the air.  \"I have done nothing.\"  \"You meant to. That is as bad.\"  She saw the hunting knife at Wolf Paw's belt. She could make a grab for it, try to stab him.  No, he was one of the tribe's mightiest braves. He would be too quick and strong for her. And, at least, up to now she had done no harm to anyone but herself. To try to murder the son of the war leader would be a great crime.  His grip on her arm still cruelly tight, he gestured back behind him toward the snow-covered camp. \"Think of your mother's weeping over what I caught you doing. Your father, his heart torn in his chest. But he, the shaman, would have to say that you must be killed.\"  Hopelessness crushed her. Now she would never be able to help Gray Cloud. He was going to die. And she was caught by Wolf Paw and"]]]
