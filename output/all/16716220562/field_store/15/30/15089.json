We are better matched, Sir Robert.”  There was something in her voice, usually so soft and pleasant, as she spoke  these words, something of steeliness and defiance that caused Alan to feel at  once happy and uncomfortable. Apparently also it caused Aylward to feel angry,  for he flashed a glance at Alan over her head of which the purport could not be  mistaken, though his pale face remained as immovable as ever. “We are  enemies. I hate you,” said that glance. Probably Barbara saw it; at any  rate before either of them could speak again, she said:    “Thank goodness, there is dinner at last. Sir Robert, will you take me in, and, Alan, will you sit on the other side of me? My uncle will show the  rest their places.”  The meal was long and magnificent; the price of each dish of it would have kept  a poor family for a month, and on the cost of the exquisite wines they might  have lived for a year or two. Also the last were well patronized by everyone  except Barbara, who drank water, and Alan, who since his severe fever took  nothing but weak whiskey and soda and a little claret. Even Aylward, a  temperate person, absorbed a good deal of champagne. As a consequence the  conversation grew animated, and under cover of it, while Sir Robert was arguing  with his neighbour on the left, Barbara asked in a low voice:    “What is the row, Alan? Tell me, I can’t wait any longer.”  “I have quarrelled with them,” he answered, staring at his mutton as though he were criticizing it. “I mean, I have left the firm and have nothing more to do with the business.”  Barbara’s eyes lit up as she whispered back:  “Glad of it. Best news I have heard for many a day. But then, may I ask why you are here?”  “I came to see you,” he replied humbly—“thought perhaps you wouldn’t mind,” and in his confusion he let his knife fall into the mutton, whence it rebounded, staining his shirt front.  Barbara laughed, that happy, delightful little laugh of hers, presumably at the  accident with the knife. Whether or no she “minded” did not appear,  only she handed her handkerchief, a costly, lace-fringed trifle, to Alan to  wipe the gravy off his shirt, which he took thinking it was a napkin, and as  she did so, touched his hand with a little caressing movement of her fingers.  Whether this was done by chance or on purpose did not appear either. At least  it made Alan feel extremely happy. Also when he discovered what it was, he kept  that gravy-stained handkerchief, nor did she ever ask for it back again. Only  once in after days when she happened to come across it stuffed away in the  corner of a despatch-box, she blushed all over, and said that she had no idea  that any man could be so foolish out of a book.    “Now that _you_ are really clear of it, I am going for them,” she said presently when the wiping process was finished. “I have only restrained myself for your sake,” and, leaning back in her chair she stared at the ceiling, lost in meditation.  Presently there came one of those silences which will fall upon dinner-parties  at times, however excellent and plentiful the champagne.  “Sir Robert Aylward,” said Barbara in that clear, carrying voice of hers, “will you, as an expert, instruct a very ignorant person? I want a little information.”  “Miss Champers,” he answered, “am I not always at your service?” and all listened to hear upon what point their hostess desired to be enlightened.  “Sir Robert,” she went on calmly, “everyone here is, I believe, what is called a financier, that is except myself and Major Vernon,  who only tries to be and will, I am sure, fail, since Nature made him something  else, a soldier and—what else did Nature make you, Alan?”    As he vouchsafed no answer to this question, although Sir Robert muttered an  uncomplimentary one between his lips which Barbara heard, or read, she  continued:  “And you are all very rich and successful, are you not, and are going to be much richer and much more successful—next week. Now what I want to ask  you is—how is it done?”  “Accepting the premises for the sake of argument, Miss Champers,” replied Sir Robert, who felt that he could not refuse the challenge, “the  answer is that it is done by finance.”  “I am still in the dark,” she said. “Finance, as I have heard of it, means floating companies, and companies are floated to earn money for  those who invest in them. Now this afternoon as I was dull, I got hold of a  book called the Directory of Directors, and looked up all your names in it,  except those of the gentlemen from Paris, and the companies that you  direct—I found out about those in another book. Well, I could not make  out that any of these companies have ever earned any money, a dividend,  don’t you call it? Therefore how do you all grow so rich, and why do  people invest in them?”  Now Sir Robert frowned, Alan coloured, two or three of the company laughed  outright, and one of the French gentlemen who understood English and had  already drunk as much as was good for him, remarked loudly to his neighbour,  “Ah! she is charming. She do touch the spot, like that ointment you give  me to-day. How do we grow rich and why do the people invest? _Mon Dieu!_  why do they invest? That is the great mystery. I say that _cette belle  demoiselle, votre nièce, est ravissante. Elle a d’esprit, mon ami  Haswell._”  Apparently her uncle did not share these sentiments, for he turned as red as  any turkey-cock, and said across the great round table:  “My dear Barbara, I wish that you would leave matters which you do not understand alone. We are here to dine, not to talk about finance.”  “Certainly, Uncle,” she answered sweetly. “I stand, or rather sit, reproved. I suppose that I have put my foot into it as usual, and the  worst of it is,” she added, turning to Sir Robert, “that I am just as ignorant as I was before.”  “If you want to master these matters, Miss Champers,” said Aylward with a rather forced laugh, “you must go into training and worship at the  shrine of”—he meant to say Mammon, then thinking that the word sounded unpleasant, substituted—“the Yellow God as we do.”  At these words Alan, who had been studying his plate, looked up quickly, and  her uncle’s face turned from red to white. But the irrepressible Barbara  seized upon them.  “The Yellow God,” she repeated. “Do you mean money or that fetish thing of Major Vernon’s with the terrible woman’s face that I saw at the office in the City. Well, to change the subject, tell us, Alan,  what is that yellow god of yours and where did it come from?”  “My uncle Austin, who was my mother’s brother and a missionary, brought it from West Africa a great many years ago. He was the first to visit  the tribe who worship it; in fact I do not think that anyone has ever visited  them since. But really I do not know all the story. Jeekie can tell you about  it if you want to know, for he is one of that people and escaped with my  uncle.”  Now Jeekie having left the room, some of the guests wished to send for him, but  Mr. Champers-Haswell objected. The end of it was that a compromise was  effected, Alan undertaking to produce his retainer afterwards when they went to  play billiards or cards.  Dinner was over at length and the diners, who had dined well, were gathered in  the billiard room to smoke and amuse themselves as they wished. It was a very  large room, sixty feet long indeed, with a wide space in the centre between the  two tables, which was furnished as a lounge. When the gentlemen entered it they  found Barbara standing by the great fireplace in this central space, a little  shape of white and silver in its emptiness.    “Forgive me for intruding on you,” she said, “and please do not stop smoking, for I like the smell. I have sat up expressly to hear Jeekie’s story of the Yellow God. Alan, produce Jeekie, or I shall go to bed at once.”  Her uncle made a movement as though to interfere, but Sir Robert said something  to him which appeared to cause him to change his mind, while the rest in some  way or another signified an enthusiastic assent. All of them were anxious to  see this Jeekie and hear his tale, if he had one to tell. So Jeekie was sent  for and presently arrived clad in the dress clothes which are common to all  classes in England and America. There he stood before them white-headed,  ebony-faced, gigantic, imperturbable. There is no doubt that his appearance  produced an effect, for it was unusual and indeed striking.    “You sent for me, Major?” he said, addressing his master, to whom he gave a military salute, for he had been Alan’s servant when he was in the Army.  “Yes, Jeekie. Miss Barbara here and these gentlemen, wish you to tell them all that you know about the Yellow God.”  The negro started and rolled his round eyes upwards till the whites of them  showed, then began in his school-book English:  “That is a private subject, Major, upon which I should prefer not to discourse before this very public company.”  A chorus of remonstrance arose and one of the Jewish gentlemen approaching  Jeekie, slipped a couple of sovereigns into his great hand, which he promptly  transferred to his pocket without seeming to notice them.    “Jeekie,” said Barbara, “don’t disappoint me.”  “Very well, miss, I fall in with your wishes. The Yellow God that all these gentlemen worship, quite another god to that of which you desire that I  should tell you. You know all about him. My god is of female sex.”    At this statement his audience burst into laughter while Jeekie rolled his eyes  again and waited till they had finished. “My god,” he went on presently, “I mean, gentlemen, the god I used to pray to, for I am a good  Christian now, has so much gold that she does not care for any more,” and  he paused.  “Then what does she care for?” asked someone.  “Blood,” answered Jeekie. “She is god of Death. Her name is Little Bonsa or Small Swimming Head; she is wife of Big Bonsa or Great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2857"],["title","A Yellow God: An Idol of Africa (#8)"],["body","Head.”  Again there was laughter, though less general—for instance, neither Sir Robert nor Mr. Champers-Haswell laughed. This merriment seemed to excite Jeekie. At any rate it caused him to cease his stilted talk and relapse into  the strange vernacular that is common to all negroes, tinctured with a racy  slang that was all his own.  “You want to hear Yellow God palaver?” he said rapidly. “Very well, I tell you, you cocksure white men who think you know everything, but  know nothing at all. My people, people of the Asiki, that mean people of  Spirits, what you call ghosts and say you no believe in, but always look for  behind door, they worship Yellow God, Bonsa Big and Bonsa Little, worship both  and call them one; only Little Bonsa on trip to this country just now and sit  and think in City office. Yellow God live long way up a great river, then turn  to the left and walk six days through big forest where dwarf people shoot you  with poisoned arrow. Then turn to the right, walk up stream where many wild  beasts. Then turn to the left again and go in canoe through swamp where you die  of fever, and across lake. Then walk over grassland and mountains. Then in  kloof of the mountains where big black trees make a roof and river fall like  thunder, find Asiki and gold house of the Yellow God. All that mountain gold,  full of gold and beneath gold house Yellow God afloat in water. She what you  call Queen, priestess, live there also, always there, very beautiful woman  called Asika with face like Yellow God, cruel, cruel. She take a husband every  year, and every year he die because she always hunt for right man but never  find him.”    “How does she kill him then?” asked Barbara.  “Oh! no, she no kill him, Miss, he kill himself at end of year, glad to get away from Asika and go to spirits. While he live he have a very good time,  plenty to eat, plenty wives, fine house, much gold as he like, only nothing to  spend it on, pretty necklace, nice paint for face. But Asika, little bit by  little bit she eat up his spirit. He see too many ghosts. The house where he  sleep with dead men who once have his billet, full of ghosts and every night  there come more and sit with him, sit all round him, look at him with great  eyes, just like you look at me, till at last when Asika finish eating up his  spirit, he go crazy, he howl like man in hell, he throw away all the gold they  give him, and then, sometimes after one week, sometimes after one month,  sometimes after one year if he be strong but never more, he run out at night  and jump into canal where Yellow God float and god get him, while Asika sit on  the bank and laugh, ’cause she hungry for new man to eat up his spirit  too.”    Jeekie’s big voice died away to a whisper and ceased. There was a silence  in the room, for even in the shine of the electric light and through the fumes  of champagne, in more than one imagination there rose a vision of that haunted  water in which floated the great Yellow God, and of some mad being casting  himself to his death beneath the moon, while his beautiful witch wife who was  “hungry for more spirits” sat upon its edge and laughed. Although  his language was now commonplace enough, even ludicrous at times, the negro had  undoubtedly the art of narration. His auditors felt that he spoke of what he  knew, or had seen, that the very recollection of it frightened him, therefore  he frightened them.    Again Barbara broke the silence which she felt to be awkward.  “Why do more ghosts come very night to sit with the queen’s husband, Jeekie?” she asked. “Where do they come from?”  “Out of the dead, miss, dead husbands of Asika from beginning of the world; what they call Munganas. Also always they make sacrifice to Yellow God.  From far, far away them poor niggers send people to be sacrifice that their  house or tribe get luck. Sometimes they send kings, sometimes great men,  sometimes doctors, sometimes women what have twin babies. Also the Asiki bring  people what is witches, or have drunk poison stuff which blacks call  _muavi_ and have not been sick, or perhaps son they love best to take  curse off their roof. All these come to Yellow God. Then Asiki doctor, they  have Death-palaver. On night of full moon they beat drum, and drum go Wow! Wow!  Wow! and doctors pick out those to die that month. Once they pick out Jeekie,  oh! good Lord, they pick out _me_,” and as he said the words he  gasped and with his great hand wiped off the sweat that started from his brow.  “But Yellow God no take Jeekie that time, no want him and I escape.”    “How?” asked Sir Robert.  “With my master, Major’s uncle, Reverend Austin, he who come try to make Asiki Christian. He snap his fingers, put on small mask of Yellow God  which he prig, Little Bonsa herself, that same face which sit in your office  now,” and he pointed to Sir Robert, “like one toad upon a stone.  Priests think that god make herself into man, want holiday, take me out into  forest to kill me and eat my life. So they let us go by and we go just as  though devil kick us—fast, fast, and never see the Asiki any more. But  Little Bonsa I bring with me for luck, tell truth I no dare leave her behind,  she not stand that; and now she sit in your office and think and think and make  magic there. That why you grow rich, because she know you worship her.”    “That’s a nice way for a baptized Christian to talk,” said Barbara, adding, “But Jeekie, what do you mean when you say that the god did not take you?”  “I mean this, miss; when victim offered to Big Yellow God, priest-men bring him to edge of canal where the great god float. Then if Yellow God want  him, it turn and swim across water.”  “Swim across water! I thought you said it was only a mask of gold?”  “I don’t know, miss, perhaps man inside the mask, perhaps spirit. I say it swim across water in the night, always in the night, and lift itself up  and look in victim’s face. Then priest take him and kill him, sometimes  one way—sometimes another. Or if he escape and they not kill him, all  same for that Johnnie, he die in about one year, always die, no one ever live  long if Yellow God swim to him in dark and rise up and smile in his face. No  matter if it Big Bonsa or Little Bonsa, for they man and wife joined in holy  matrimony and either do trick.”  As these words left Jeekie’s lips Alan became aware of some unusual movement on his left and looking round, saw that Mr. Champers-Haswell, who  stood by him, had dropped the cigar which he held and, white as a sheet, was  swaying to and fro. Indeed in another instant he would have fallen had not Alan  caught him in his arms and supported him till others came to his assistance,  when between them they carried him to a sofa. On their way they passed a table  where spirits and soda water were set out, and to his astonishment Alan noticed  that Sir Robert Aylward, looking little if at all better than his partner, had  helped himself to half a tumbler of cognac, which he was swallowing in great  gulps. Then there was confusion and someone went to telephone the doctor, while  the deep voice of Jeekie was heard exclaiming:    “That Yellow God at work—oh yes, Little Bonsa on the job. Jeekie Christian man but no doubt she very powerful fetish and can do anything she  like to them that worship her, and you see, she sit in office of these  gentlemen. ’Spect she make Reverend Austin and me bring her to England  because she got eye on firm of Messrs. Aylward & Haswell, London, E.C. Oh,  shouldn’t wonder at all, for Bonsa know everything.”  “Oh, confound you and your fetish! Be off, you old donkey,” almost shouted Alan.  “Major,” replied the offended Jeekie, assuming his grand manner and language, “it was not I who wished to narrate this history of blood-stained superstitions of poor African. Mustn’t blame old Jeekie if they make Christian gents sick as Channel steamer.”  “Be off!” repeated Alan, stamping his foot.  So Jeekie went, but outside the door, as it chanced, he encountered one of the  Jew gentlemen who also appeared to be a little “sick.” An idea striking him, he touched his white hair with his finger and said:  “You like Jeekie’s pretty story, sir? Well, Jeekie think that if you make little present to him, like your brother in there, it please Yellow  God very much, and bring you plenty luck.”  Then acting upon some unaccustomed impulse, that Jew became exceedingly generous. In his pocket was a handful of sovereigns which he had been prepared  to stake at bridge. He grasped them all and thrust them into Jeekie’s  outstretched palm, where they seemed to melt.  “Thank you, sir,” said Jeekie. “Now I sure you have plenty luck, just like your grandpa Jacob in Book when he do his brudder in eye.”       CHAPTER IV.  ALAN AND BARBARA.   There was no bridge or billiards at the Court that night, where ordinarily the  play ran high enough. After Mr. Haswell had been carried to his room, some of  the guests, among them Sir Robert Aylward, went to bed, remarking that they  could do no good by sitting up, while others, more concerned, waited to hear  the verdict of the doctor, who must drive from six miles away. He came, and  half an hour later Barbara entered the billiard room and told Alan, who was  sitting there smoking, that her uncle had recovered from his faint, and that  the doctor, who was to stay all night, said that he was in no danger, only  suffering from a heart attack brought on apparently by over-work or excitement.    When Alan woke next morning the first thing that he heard through his open  window was the sound of the doctor’s departing dogcart. Then Jeekie  appeared and told him that Mr. Haswell was all right again, but that all night  he had shaken “like one jelly.” Alan asked what had been the matter  with him, but Jeekie only shrugged his shoulders and said that he did not  know—“perhaps Yellow God touch him up.”  At breakfast, as in her note she had said she would, Barbara appeared"]]]
