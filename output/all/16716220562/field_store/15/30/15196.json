Ha, Philibert will see to this confession!  And through this woman's torment he will rid himself of every dangerous foe he has in Venaissin.  You must stand by and wait your turn.  You must stand by, in fetters, and see this done--you, you, my master!--you, who love this woman as I loved that dead Zoraida who was not fair enough to please you!\"  Raimbaut, trapped, impotent, cried out: \"This is not possible----\"  And for all that, he knew the Saracen to be foretelling the inevitable.  Makrisi went on, quietly:  \"After the Question men will parade her, naked to the middle, through all Orange, until they reach the Marketplace, where will be four horses.  One of these horses they will harness to each arm and leg of your Biatritz.  Then they will beat these horses.  These will be strong horses.  They will each run in a different direction.\"  This infamy also was certain.  Raimbaut foresaw what he must do.  He clutched the dagger which Makrisi fondled.  \"Belhs Cavaliers, this fellow speaks the truth.  Look now, the moon is old--is it not strange to know it will outlive us?\"  And Biatritz came close to Sire Raimbaut and said: \"I understand.  If I leave this room alive it will purchase a hideous suffering for my poor body, it will bring about the ruin of many brave and innocent chevaliers.  I know.  I would perforce confess all that the masked men bade me.  I know, for in Prince Conrat's time I have seen persons who had been put to the Question----\"  She shuddered; and she re-began, without any agitation:  \"Give me the knife, Raimbaut.\"  \"Pardieu! but I may not obey you for this once,\" he answered, \"since we are informed by those in holy orders that all such as lay violent hands upon themselves must suffer eternally.\"  Then, kneeling, he cried, in an extremity of adoration:  \"Oh, I have served you all my life.  You may not now deny me this last service.  And while I talk they dig your grave!  O blind men, making the new grave, take heed lest that grave be too narrow, for already my heart is breaking in my body.  I have drunk too deep of sorrow.  And yet I may not fail you, now that honor and mercy and my love for you demand I kill you before I also die--in such a fashion as this fellow speaks of.\"  She did not dispute this.  How could she when it was an axiom in all Courts of Love that Heaven held dominion in a lover's heart only as an underling of the man's mistress?  And so she said, with a fond smile:  \"It is your demonstrable privilege.  I would not grant it, dear, were my weak hands as clean as yours.  Oh, but it is long you have loved me, and it is faithfully you have served Heaven, and my heart too is breaking in my body now that your service ends!\"  And he demanded, wearily:  \"When we were boy and girl together what had we said if any one had told us this would be the end?\"  \"We would have laughed.  It is a long while since those children laughed at Montferrat. . . . Not yet, not yet!\" she said.  \"Ah, pity me, tried champion, for even now I am almost afraid to die.\"  She leaned against the window yonder, shuddering, staring into the night.  Dawn had purged the east of stars.  Day was at hand, the day whose noon she might not hope to witness.  She noted this incuriously. Then Biatritz came to him, very strangely proud, and yet all tenderness.  \"See, now, Raimbaut! because I have loved you as I have loved nothing else in life, I will not be unworthy of your love.  Strike and have done.\"  Raimbaut de Vaquieras raised an already bloodied dagger.  As emotion goes, he was bankrupt.  He had no longer any dread of hell, because he thought that, a little later, nothing its shrewdest overseer could plan would have the power to vex him.  She, waiting, smiled.  Makrisi, seated, stretched his legs, put fingertips together with the air of an attendant amateur.  This was better than he had hoped.  In such a posture they heard a bustle of armored men, and when all turned, saw how a sword protruded through the arras.  \"Come out, Guillaume!\" people were shouting.  \"Unkennel, dog!  Out, out, and die!\"  To such a heralding Mahi de Vernoil came into the room with mincing steps such as the man affected in an hour of peril.  He first saw what a grisly burden the chest sustained.  \"Now, by the Face!\" he cried, \"if he that cheated me of quieting this filth should prove to be of gentle birth I will demand of him a duel to the death!\" The curtains were ripped from their hangings as he spoke, and behind him the candlelight was reflected by the armor of many followers.  Then de Vernoil perceived Raimbaut de Vaquieras, and the spruce little man bowed ceremoniously.  All were still.  Composedly, like a lieutenant before his captain, Mahi narrated how these hunted remnants of Lovain's army had, as a last cast, that night invaded the chateau, and had found, thanks to the festival, its men-at-arms in uniform and inefficient drunkenness.  \"My tres beau sire,\" Messire de Vernoil ended, \"will you or nill you, Venaissin is yours this morning.  My knaves have slain Philibert and his bewildered fellow-tipplers with less effort than is needed to drown as many kittens.\"  And his followers cried, as upon a signal: \"Hail, Prince of Orange!\"  It was so like the wonder-working of a dream--this sudden and heroic uproar--that old Raimbaut de Vaquieras stood reeling, near to intimacy with fear for the first time.  He waited thus, with both hands pressed before his eyes.  He waited thus for a long while, because he was not used to find chance dealing kindlily with him.  Later he saw that Makrisi had vanished in the tumult, and that many people awaited his speaking.  The lord of Venaissin began: \"You have done me a great service, Messire de Vemoil.  As recompense, I give you what I may.  I freely yield you all my right in Venaissin.  Oh no, kingcraft is not for me.  I daily see and hear of battles won, cities beleaguered, high towers overthrown, and ancient citadels and new walls leveled with the dust. I have conversed with many kings, the directors of these events, and they were not happy people.  Yes, yes, I have witnessed divers happenings, for I am old. . . .  I have found nothing which can serve me in place of honor.\"  He turned to Dona Biatritz.  It was as if they were alone.  \"Belhs Cavaliers,\" he said, \"I had sworn fealty to this Guillaume.  He violated his obligations; but that did not free me of mine.  An oath is an oath.  I was, and am to-day, sworn to support his cause, and to profit in any fashion by its overthrow would be an abominable action. Nay, more, were any of his adherents alive it would be my manifest duty to join them against our preserver, Messire de Vernoil.  This necessity is very happily spared me.  I cannot, though, in honor hold any fief under the supplanter of my liege-lord.  I must, therefore, relinquish Vaquieras and take eternal leave of Venaissin.  I will not lose the right to call myself your servant!\" he cried out--\"and that which is noblest in the world must be served fittingly.  And so, Belhs Cavaliers, let us touch palms and bid farewell, and never in this life speak face to face of trivial happenings which we two alone remember. For naked of lands and gear I came to you--a prince's daughter--very long ago, and as nakedly I now depart, so that I may retain the right to say, 'All my life long I served my love of her according to my abilities, wholeheartedly and with clean hands.'\"  \"Yes, yes! you must depart from Venaissin,\" said Dona Biatritz.  A capable woman, she had no sympathy with his exquisite points of honor, and yet loved him all the more because of what seemed to her his surpassing folly.  She smiled, somewhat as mothers do in humoring an unreasonable boy.  \"We will go to my nephew's court at Montferrat,\" she said.  \"He will willingly provide for his old aunt and her husband. And you may still make verses--at Montferrat, where we lived verses, once, Raimbaut.\"  Now they gazed full upon each other.  Thus they stayed, transfigured, neither seeming old.  Each had forgotten that unhappiness existed anywhere in the whole world.  The armored, blood-stained men about them were of no more importance than were those wantons in the tapestry. Without, dawn throbbed in heaven.  Without, innumerable birds were raising that glad, piercing, hurried morning-song which very anciently caused Adam's primal waking, to behold his mate.     BALTHAZAR'S DAUGHTER   \"_A curious preference for the artificial should be mentioned as characteristic of ALESSANDRO DE MEDICI'S poetry.  For his century was anything but artless; the great commonplaces that form the main stock of human thought were no longer in their first flush, and he addressed a people no longer childish. . . .  Unquestionably his fancies were fantastic, anti-natural, bordering on hallucination, and they betray a desire for impossible novelty; but it is allowable to prefer them to the sickly simplicity of those so-called poems that embroider with old faded wools upon the canvas of worn-out truisms, trite, trivial and idiotically sentimental patterns._\"     Let me have dames and damsels richly clad     To feed and tend my mirth,   Singing by day and night to make me glad;    Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth     Fill'd with the strife of birds,   With water-springs, and beasts that house i' the earth.    Let me seem Solomon for lore of words,   Samson for strength, for beauty Absalom.      Knights as my serfs be given;   And as I will, let music go and come;   Till, when I will, I will to enter Heaven.    ALESSANDRO DE MEDICI.--_Madrigal, from D. G. Rossetti's version_.     BALTHAZAR'S DAUGHTER  Graciosa was Balthazar's youngest child, a white, slim girl with violet eyes and strange pale hair which had the color and glitter of stardust. \"Some day at court,\" her father often thought complacently, \"she, too, will make a good match.\"  He was a necessitous lord, a smiling, supple"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/288"],["title","The Certain Hour (Dizain des Poëtes) (#7)"],["body"," who had already marketed two daughters to his advantage.  But Graciosa's time was not yet mature in the year of grace 1533, for the girl was not quite sixteen.  So Graciosa remained in Balthazar's big cheerless house and was tutored in all needful accomplishments.  She was proficient in the making of preserves and unguents, could play the harpsichord and the virginals acceptably, could embroider an altarcloth to admiration, and, in spite of a trivial lameness in walking, could dance a coranto or a saraband against any woman between two seas.  Now to the north of Balthazar's home stood a tall forest, overhanging both the highway and the river whose windings the highway followed. Graciosa was very often to be encountered upon the outskirts of these woods.  She loved the forest, whose tranquillity bred dreams, but was already a woman in so far that she found it more interesting to watch the highway.  Sometimes it would be deserted save for small purple butterflies which fluttered about as if in continuous indecision, and rarely ascended more than a foot above the ground.  But people passed at intervals--as now a page, who was a notably fine fellow, clothed in ash-colored gray, with slashed, puffed sleeves, and having a heron's feather in his cap; or a Franciscan with his gown tucked up so that you saw how the veins on his naked feet stood out like the carvings on a vase; or a farmer leading a calf; or a gentleman in a mantle of squirrel's fur riding beside a wonderful proud lady, whose tiny hat was embroidered with pearls.  It was all very interesting to watch, it was like turning over the leaves of a book written in an unknown tongue and guessing what the pictures meant, because these people were intent upon their private avocations, in which you had no part, and you would never see them any more.  Then destiny took a hand in the affair and Guido came.  He reined his gray horse at the sight of her sitting by the wayside and deferentially inquired how far it might be to the nearest inn.  Graciosa told him. He thanked her and rode on.  That was all, but the appraising glance of this sedate and handsome burgher obscurely troubled the girl afterward.  Next day he came again.  He was a jewel-merchant, he told her, and he thought it within the stretch of possibility that my lord Balthazar's daughter might wish to purchase some of his wares.  She viewed them with admiration, chaffered thriftily, and finally bought a topaz, dug from Mount Zabarca, Guido assured her, which rendered its wearer immune to terrors of any kind.  Very often afterward these two met on the outskirts of the forest as Guido rode between the coast and the hill-country about his vocation. Sometimes he laughingly offered her a bargain, on other days he paused to exhibit a notable gem which he had procured for this or that wealthy amateur.  Count Eglamore, the young Duke's favorite yonder at court, bought most of them, it seemed.  \"The nobles complain against this upstart Eglamore very bitterly,\" said Guido, \"but we merchants have no quarrel with him.  He buys too lavishly.\"  \"I trust I shall not see Count Eglamore when I go to court,\" said Graciosa, meditatively; \"and, indeed, by that time, my father assures me, some honest gentleman will have contrived to cut the throat of this abominable Eglamore.\"  Her father's people, it should be premised, had been at bitter feud with the favorite ever since he detected and punished the conspiracy of the Marquis of Cibo, their kinsman.  Then Graciosa continued:  \"Nevertheless, I shall see many beautiful sights when I am taken to court. . . .  And the Duke, too, you tell me, is an amateur of gems.\"  \"Eh, madonna, I wish that you could see his jewels,\" cried Guido, growing fervent; and he lovingly catalogued a host of lapidary marvels.  \"I hope that I shall see these wonderful jewels when I go to court,\" said Graciosa wistfully.  \"Duke Alessandro,\" he returned, his dark eyes strangely mirthful, \"is, as I take it, a catholic lover of beauty in all its forms.  So he will show you his gems, very assuredly, and, worse still, he will make verses in your honor.  For it is a preposterous feature of Duke Alessandro's character that he is always making songs.\"  \"Oh, and such strange songs as they are, too, Guido.  Who does not know them?\"  \"I am not the best possible judge of his verses' merit,\" Guido estimated, drily.  \"But I shall never understand how any singer at all came to be locked in such a prison.  I fancy that at times the paradox puzzles even Duke Alessandro.\"  \"And is he as handsome as people report?\"  Then Guido laughed a little.  \"Tastes differ, of course.  But I think your father will assure you, madonna, that no duke possessing such a zealous tax-collector as Count Eglamore was ever in his lifetime considered of repulsive person.\"  \"And is he young?\"  \"Why, as to that, he is about of an age with me, and in consequence old enough to be far more sensible than either of us is ever likely to be,\" said Guido; and began to talk of other matters.  But presently Graciosa was questioning him again as to the court, whither she was to go next year and enslave a marquis, or, at worst, an opulent baron.  Her thoughts turned toward the court's predominating figure.  \"Tell me of Eglamore, Guido.\"  \"Madonna, some say that Eglamore was a brewer's son.  Others--and your father's kinsmen in particular--insist that he was begot by a devil in person, just as Merlin was, and Plato the philosopher, and puissant Alexander.  Nobody knows anything about his origin.\" Guido was sitting upon the ground, his open pack between his knees.  Between the thumb and forefinger of each hand he held caressingly a string of pearls which he inspected as he talked.  \"Nobody,\" he idly said, \"nobody is very eager to discuss Count Eglamore's origin now that Eglamore has become indispensable to Duke Alessandro.  Yes, it is thanks to Eglamore that the Duke has ample leisure and needful privacy for the pursuit of recreations which are reputed to be curious.\"  \"I do not understand you, Guido.\"  Graciosa was all wonder.  \"It is perhaps as well,\" the merchant said, a trifle sadly.  Then Guido shrugged.  \"To be brief, madonna, business annoys the Duke.  He finds in this Eglamore an industrious person who affixes seals, draughts proclamations, makes treaties, musters armies, devises pageants, and collects revenues, upon the whole, quite as efficiently as Alessandro would be capable of doing these things.  So Alessandro makes verses and amuses himself as his inclinations prompt, and Alessandro's people are none the worse off on account of it.\"  \"Heigho, I foresee that I shall never fall in love with the Duke,\" Graciosa declared.  \"It is unbefitting and it is a little cowardly for a prince to shirk the duties of his station.  Now, if I were Duke I would grant my father a pension, and have Eglamore hanged, and purchase a new gown of silvery green, in which I would be ravishingly beautiful, and afterward-- Why, what would you do if you were Duke, Messer Guido?\"  \"What would I do if I were Duke?\" he echoed.  \"What would I do if I were a great lord instead of a tradesman?  I think you know the answer, madonna.\"  \"Oh, you would make me your duchess, of course.  That is quite understood,\" said Graciosa, with the lightest of laughs.  \"But I was speaking seriously, Guido.\"  Guido at that considered her intently for a half-minute.  His countenance was of portentous gravity, but in his eyes she seemed to detect a lurking impishness.  \"And it is not a serious matter that a peddler of crystals should have dared to love a nobleman's daughter?  You are perfectly right.  That I worship you is an affair which does not concern any person save myself in any way whatsoever, although I think that knowledge of the fact would put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger. . . . Indeed, I am not certain that I worship you, for in order to adore wholeheartedly, the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect.  Now, your nails are of an ugly shape, like that of little fans; your mouth is too large; and I have long ago perceived that you are a trifle lame in spite of your constant care to conceal the fact.  I do not admire these faults, for faults they are undoubtedly.  Then, too, I know you are vain and self-seeking, and look forward contentedly to the time when your father will transfer his ownership of such physical attractions as heaven gave you to that nobleman who offers the highest price for them.  It is true you have no choice in the matter, but you will participate in a monstrous bargain, and I would prefer to have you exhibit distaste for it.\"  And with that he returned composedly to inspection of his pearls.  \"And to what end, Guido?\"  It was the first time Graciosa had completely waived the reticence of a superior caste.  You saw that the child's parted lips were tremulous, and you divined her childish fits of dreading that glittering, inevitable court-life shared with an unimaginable husband.  But Guido only grumbled whimsically.  \"I am afraid that men do not always love according to the strict laws of logic.  I desire your happiness above all things; yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by anything that troubles me is another matter.\"  \"But I am not untroubled, Guido----\" she began swiftly.  Graciosa broke off in speech, shrugged, flashed a smile at him.  \"For I cannot fathom you, Ser Guido, and that troubles me.  Yes, I am very fond of you, and yet I do not trust you.  You tell me you love me greatly.  It pleases me to have you say this.  You perceive I am very candid this morning, Messer Guido.  Yes, it pleases me, and I know that for the sake of seeing me you daily endanger your life, for if my father heard of our meetings he would have you killed.  You would not incur such hare-brained risks unless you cared very greatly; and yet, somehow, I do not believe it is altogether for me you care.\"  Then Guido was in train to protest an all-mastering and"]]]
