[Illustration]  =The Bibliomania.=   MY DEAR SIR,  When the poetical Epistle of Dr. Ferriar, under the popular title of \"THE BIBLIOMANIA,\" was announced for publication, I honestly confess that, in common with many of my book-loving acquaintance, a strong sensation of fear and of hope possessed me: of fear, that I might have been accused, however indirectly, of having contributed towards the increase of this Mania; and of hope, that the true object of book-collecting, and literary pursuits, might have been fully and fairly developed. The perusal of this elegant epistle dissipated alike my fears and my hopes; for, instead of caustic verses, and satirical notes,[3] I found a smooth, melodious, and persuasive panegyric; unmixed, however, with any rules for the choice of books, or the regulation of study.       [Footnote 3: There are, nevertheless, some satirical      allusions which one could have wished had been suppressed.      For instance:            He turns where PYBUS rears his atlas-head           Or MADOC'S mass conceals its veins of lead;       What has Mr. Pybus's gorgeous book in praise of the late      Russian Emperor Paul I. (which some have called the      chef-d'oeuvre of Bensley's press[A]) to do with Mr.      Southey's fine Poem of Madoc?--in which, if there are \"veins      of lead,\" there are not a few \"of silver and gold.\" Of the      extraordinary talents of Mr. Southey, the indefatigable      student in ancient lore, and especially in all that regards      Spanish Literature and Old English Romances, this is not the      place to make mention. His \"_Remains of Henry Kirk White_,\"      the sweetest specimen of modern biography, has sunk into      every heart, and received an eulogy from every tongue. Yet      is his own life            \"The more endearing song.\"       Dr. Ferriar's next satirical verses are levelled at Mr.      THOMAS HOPE.            \"The lettered fop now takes a larger scope,           With classic furniture, design'd by HOPE.           (HOPE, whom upholsterers eye with mute despair,           The doughty pedant of an elbow chair.\")       It has appeared to me that Mr. Hope's magnificent volume on      \"_Household Furniture_\" has been generally misunderstood,      and, in a few instances, criticised upon false      principles.--The first question is, does the _subject_ admit      of illustration? and if so, has Mr. Hope illustrated it      properly? I believe there is no canon of criticism which      forbids the treating of such a subject; and, while we are      amused with archæological discussions on Roman tiles and      tesselated pavements, there seems to be no absurdity in      making the decorations of our sitting rooms, including      something more than the floor we walk upon, a subject at      least of temperate and classical disquisition. Suppose we      had found such a treatise in the volumes of Gronovius and      Montfaucon? (and are there not a few, apparently, as      unimportant and confined in these rich volumes of the      Treasures of Antiquity?) or suppose something similar to Mr.      Hope's work had been found among the ruins of Herculaneum?      Or, lastly, let us suppose the author had printed it only as      a _private_ book, to be circulated as a present! In each of      these instances, should we have heard the harsh censures      which have been thrown out against it? On the contrary, is      it not very probable that a wish might have been expressed      that \"so valuable a work ought to be made public.\"       Upon what principle, _a priori_, are we to ridicule and      condemn it? I know of none. We admit Vitruvius, Inigo Jones,      Gibbs, and Chambers, into our libraries: and why not Mr.      Hope's book? Is decoration to be confined only to the      exterior? and, if so, are works, which treat of these only,      to be read and applauded? Is the delicate bas-relief, and      beautifully carved column, to be thrust from the cabinet and      drawing room, to perish on the outside of a smoke-dried      portico? Or, is not _that_ the most deserving of      commendation which produces the most numerous and pleasing      associations of ideas? I recollect, when in company with the      excellent DR. JENNER,            ----[clarum et venerabile nomen           Gentibus, et multum nostræ quod proderat urbi]       and a half dozen more friends, we visited the splendid      apartments in Duchess Street, Portland Place, we were not      only struck with the appropriate arrangement of every thing,      but, on our leaving them, and coming out into the dull foggy      atmosphere of London, we acknowledged that the effect      produced upon our minds was something like that which might      have arisen had we been regaling ourselves on the silken      couches, and within the illuminated chambers, of some of the  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28540"],["title","Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (#2)"],["body","    enchanted palaces described in the Arabian Nights'      Entertainments. I suspect that those who have criticised Mr.      Hope's work with asperity have never seen his house.       These sentiments are not the result of partiality or      prejudice, for I am wholly unacquainted with Mr. Hope. They      are delivered with zeal, but with deference. It is quite      consolatory to find a gentleman of large fortune, of      respectable ancestry, and of classical attainments, devoting      a great portion of that leisure time which hangs like a      leaden weight upon the generality of fashionable people, to      the service of the Fine Arts, and in the patronage of merit      and ingenuity. How much the world will again be indebted to      Mr. Hope's taste and liberality may be anticipated from the      \"_Costume of the Ancients_,\" a work which has recently been      published under his particular superintendence.]       [Footnote A: This book is beautifully executed, undoubtedly,      but being little more than a thin folio pamphlet devoid of      _typographical_ embellishment--it has been thought by some      hardly fair to say this of a press which brought out so many      works characterized by magnitude and various elegance. B.B.]  To say that I was not gratified by the perusal of it would be a confession contrary to the truth; but to say how ardently I anticipated an amplification of the subject, how eagerly I looked forward to a number of curious, apposite, and amusing anecdotes, and found them not therein, is an avowal of which I need not fear the rashness, when the known talents of the detector of Stern's plagiarisms[4] are considered. I will not, however, disguise to you that I read it with uniform delight, and that I rose from the perusal with a keener appetite for       \"The small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold.\"       _Dr. Ferriar's Ep._ v. 138.       [Footnote 4: In the fourth volume of the Transactions of the      Manchester Literary Society, part iv., p. 45-87, will be      found a most ingenious and amusing Essay, entitled      \"_Comments on Sterne_,\" which excited a good deal of      interest at the time of its publication. This discovery may      be considered, in some measure, as the result of the      BIBLIOMANIA. In my edition of Sir Thomas More's Utopia, a      suggestion is thrown out that even Burton may have been an      imitator of Boisatuau [Transcriber's Note: Boiastuau]: see      vol. II. 143.]  Whoever undertakes to write down the follies which grow out of an excessive attachment to any particular pursuit, be that pursuit horses,[5] hawks, dogs, guns, snuff boxes,[6] old china, coins, or rusty armour, may be thought to have little consulted the best means of ensuring success for his labours, when he adopts the dull vehicle of _Prose_ for the commnication [Transcriber's Note: communication] of his ideas not considering that from _Poetry_ ten thousand bright scintillations are struck off, which please and convince while they attract and astonish. Thus when Pope talks of allotting for       \"Pembroke[7] Statues, dirty Gods and Coins;      Rare monkish manuscripts for Hearne[8] alone;      And books to Mead[9] and butterflies to Sloane,\"[10]  when he says that       These Aldus[11] printed, those Du S[=u]eil has bound[12]  moreover that       For Locke or Milton[13] 'tis in vain to look;      These shelves admit not any modern book;  he not only seems to illustrate the propriety of the foregoing remark, by shewing the immense superiority of verse to prose, in ridiculing reigning absurdities, but he seems to have had a pretty strong foresight of the BIBLIOMANIA which rages at the present day. However, as the ancients tell us that a Poet cannot be a _manufactured_ creature, and as I have not the smallest pretensions to the \"rhyming art,\" [although in former times[14] I did venture to dabble with it] I must of necessity have recourse to _Prose_; and, at the same time, to your candour and forbearance in perusing the pages which ensue.       [Footnote 5: It may be taken for granted that the first book      in this country which excited a passion for the _Sports of      the field_ was Dame Juliana Berners, or Barnes's, work, on      _Hunting and Hawking_, printed at St. Alban's, in the year      1486; of which Lord Spencer's copy is, I believe, the only      perfect one known. It was formerly the Poet Mason's, and is      mentioned in the quarto edition of Hoccleve's Poems, p. 19,      1786. See too Bibl. Mason. Pt. iv. No. 153. Whether the      forementioned worthy lady was really the author of the work      has been questioned. Her book was reprinted by Wynkyn de      Worde in 1497, with an additional Treatise on _Fishing_. The      following specimen, from this latter edition, ascertains the      general usage of the French language with our huntsmen in      the 15th century.            Beasts of Venery.            Where so ever ye fare by frith or by fell,           My dear child, take heed how Trystram do you tell.           How many manner beasts of Venery there were:           Listen to your dame and she shall you _lere_.           Four manner beasts of Venery there are.           The first of them is the _Hart_; the second is the _Hare_;           The _Horse_ is one of them; the _Wolf_; and not one _mo_.            Beasts of the Chace.            And where that ye come in plain or in place           I shall tell you which be beasts of enchace.           One of them is the _Buck_; another is the _Doe_;           The _Fox_; and the _Marteron_, and the wild _Roe_;           And ye shall see, my dear child, other beastes all:           Where so ye them find _Rascal_ ye shall them call.            Of the hunting of the Hare.            How to speke of the haare how all shall be wrought:           When she shall with houndes be founden and sought.           The fyrst worde to the ho[=u]dis that the hunter shall             out pit           Is at the kenell doore whan he openeth it.           That all maye hym here: he shall say \"_Arere!_\"           For his houndes would come to hastily.           That is the firste worde my sone of Venery.           And when he hath couplyed his houndes echoon           And is forth wyth theym to the felde goon,           And whan he hath of caste his couples at wyll           Thenne he shall speke and saye his houndes tyll           \"_Hors de couple avant, sa avant!_\" twyse soo:           And then \"_So ho, so ho!_\" thryes, and no moo.       And then say \"_Sacy avaunt, so how_,\" I thou praye, etc. The      following are a few more specimens--\"_Ha cy touz cy est      yll_--_Venez ares sa how sa_--_La douce la eit a venuz_--_Ho      ho ore, swet a lay, douce a luy_--_So how, so how, venez      acoupler!!!_\"       Whoever wishes to see these subjects brought down to later      times, and handled with considerable dexterity, may consult      the last numbers of the Censura Literaria, with the      signature J.H. affixed to them. Those who are anxious to      procure the rare books mentioned in these bibliographical      treatises, may be pretty safely taxed with being infected by      the BIBLIOMANIA. What apology my friend Mr. Haslewood, the      author of them, has to offer in extenuation of the mischief      committed, it is _his_ business, and not mine, to consider;      and what the public will say to his curious forthcoming      reprint of the ancient edition of Wynkyn De Worde _on      Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing_, 1497 (with wood cuts), I      will not pretend to divine!       In regard to Hawking, I believe the enterprising Colonel      Thornton in [Transcriber's Note: is] the only gentleman of      the present day who keeps up this custom of \"good old      times.\"       The Sultans of the East seem not to have been insensible to      the charms of Falconry, if we are to judge from the evidence      of Tippoo Saib having a work of this kind in his library;      which is thus described from the Catalogue of it just      published in a fine quarto volume, of which only 250 copies      are printed.       \"_Sh[=a]bb[=a]r N[=a]meh_, 4to. a Treatise on Falcony;      containing Instructions for selecting the best species of      Hawks, and the method of teaching them; describing their      different qualities; also the disorders they are subject to,      and method of cure. Author unknown.\"--Oriental Library of      Tippoo Saib, 1809, p. 96.]       [Footnote 6: Of _Snuff boxes_ every one knows what a      collection the great Frederick, King of Prussia, had--many      of them studded with precious stones, and decorated with      enamelled portraits. Dr. C. of G----, has been represented      to be the most successful rival of Frederick, in this \"line      of collection,\" as it is called; some of his boxes are of      uncommon curiosity. It may gratify a Bibliographer to find      that there are other MANIAS besides that of the book; and      that even physicians are not exempt from these diseases.       Of _Old China_, _Coins_, and _Rusty Armour_, the names of      hundreds present themselves in these departments; but to the      more commonly-known ones of Rawle and Grose, let me add that      of the late Mr. John White, of Newgate-Street; a catalogue      of whose curiosities [including some very uncommon books]      was published in the year 1788, in three parts, 8vo. Dr.      Burney tells us that Mr. White \"was in possession of a      valuable collection of ancient rarities, as well as natural      productions, of the most curious and extraordinary kind; no      one of which however was more remarkable than the obliging      manner in which he allowed them to be viewed and examined by      his friends.\"--_History of Music_, vol.
