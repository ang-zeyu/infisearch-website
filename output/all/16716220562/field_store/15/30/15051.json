She cast her eyes down, her hands clasped before her.  \"Simon, do not torment me. I know that you cannot marry me. My uncle has told me who you are--your ancient noble house, your vast holdings. Perhaps you mean to be kind to me by speaking of marriage, but a man of your rank has too many obligations. You cannot marry as you choose. So, please, speak of it no more.\"  _But what if we could get married?_  The thought arose unbidden in her mind as she stared down at the brown pine needles. She wanted to drive it out again, but could not stop herself from seeing what it might be like.  Marriage, a home, a fixed, secure abode where she might live out her life in serene, peaceful occupations. Raising children, spinning, embroidering, managing a household. What so many women, rich and poor, had. What she had not known since she was a young girl--a _place_, a _family_. And to be the wife of a man like Simon--kind, brave, handsome, well spoken.  She understood suddenly why it was always so easy for her to forget Sophia Karaiannides and become Sophia Orfali. She did what was given her to do, but in the core of her heart what she longed for was to be someone like Sophia Orfali, who truly had a place in the world. Sophia Orfali, for all that she was a mask, was more real than Sophia Karaiannides.  It was too painful for her, the unexpected longing for the love she could never have, the grief for Simon, whom she was going to murder.  \"Let us get back, you to your scudiero and I to my escort,\" she said. She started walking toward the road.  He stepped in front of her. \"Sophia, wait.\"  She felt something in her chest like a ball of iron. She had her tears well under control for the moment, but she had to get away from him. Otherwise she would not be able to stop herself from crying.  \"Please,\" he said again. She felt herself forced to look up at him. His thin face, so grave, so intelligent.  \"I beg you to believe me. I do want you desperately. Love is of the spirit, and it is of the body too. But I am not proposing marriage just to possess you. I want to marry you because I love you.\"  She stood looking at this handsome young man and breathing the fragrance of pine-scented air, and she thought of David. What she felt for David drew no line between body and spirit. If she had all the things she had just been longing for--a husband, a family, a home--and David appeared out of nowhere and looked at her with those glowing eyes of his and told her to come with him, she would abandon everything for him. When she looked at David, she saw a pillar of pure fire burning inside him. There was a power in him that called out to everything that was strong in her and demanded that she accept no other man for her mate.  \"You think that my title, my family, is an obstacle to our marrying,\" Simon said. \"But it is not. If you knew who I really am, you might not want to marry _me_.\"  She laughed a little at the thought of him not being who he so obviously was. \"Are you some peasant lad who stole the place of the true Simon de Gobignon, then?\"  \"It is something like that.\"  \"In God's name, Simon, what are you talking about?\"  His nostrils flared. He drew air in a great gulp through his mouth. He took a step toward her, and she tensed, lest he seize her again, but he kept his hands at his sides.  \"The last Count de Gobignon was a traitor to his king, to his countrymen, to his own vassals. He betrayed a whole army of crusaders into the hands of the Saracens. He died in disgrace. His grave is unmarked. So foul was his treachery that no man of good family in France will permit his daughter to marry me.\"  Sophia found that hard to believe. There must be many great barons in France who would forget the crime of the father, no matter how horrible, when the son was so attractive and, especially, so rich.  \"Simon, you have so much to offer a wife.\" She would have laughed at the absurdity of all this, but the tortured expression clearly mirrored a tortured soul.  \"Oh, surely, there are barons who would sell their daughters to the devil for a bit of land,\" he agreed. \"I meant that I could not marry the women I chose. But there is worse, Sophia. I could lose everything if what I am about to tell you were known, but that is the least of it. It puts my life in your hands and the lives of my mother and--my father.\"  _Your life is already in my hands_, she thought, her eyes hurting from looking so intensely into his. But then the full meaning of what he had said bore in on her.  _His father?_  \"Simon, are you telling me that you are not--\"  \"I am not the son of the Count de Gobignon. My father was a troubadour, the Sire Roland de Vency, with whom my mother fell in love while Amalric de Gobignon was still alive. She succeeded in passing me off as the count's son, but we three, my mother, Roland, and I, know the secret. And my confessor. And now you.\"  She shook her head, bewildered. She felt no doubt that what he was telling her was true. The pain in his face was like that of a man who had stripped his very skin off to reveal himself to her. It tore at her heart to see him suffering so much.  \"But how could this happen, Simon?\"  \"It is too long a tale for today. Perhaps one day I can tell you all of it. But do you believe me now? Truly there is no barrier of family between you and me, Sophia. Unless you set one there, knowing that I am--I am a bastard and an impostor. Could you think of marrying me?\"  The tears she had been holding back, for an hour it seemed, burst suddenly from her eyes, as sobs welled up in her throat. And yet, she wanted to laugh as well, at the irony of it. To think that he was ashamed of his pretense. If he had any idea of _her_ pretense, and David's, he would probably kill her on the spot.  His face, coming nearer and nearer. All his finery was a red and purple blur before her tear-filled eyes. His hands were reaching for her.  _He loves me. He really loves me. He really does want to marry me._  If he had taken that strange Saracen sword of his out and run her through with it, he could not have hurt her more. She had been thinking about sending David to kill him, and he had just entrusted all of himself, his family, everything he possessed, his body and his soul, to her.  If David went after him, this time one of them--Simon or David--would surely die. The luck of the Monaldeschi palace encounter could not protect both a second time.  She felt Simon's hands on her shoulders. She pulled away from him.  \"Sophia!\" She heard the anguish in his voice.  Tartars and Muslims were a thousand leagues away. If Christians and Tartars were destined to join forces and destroy Islam, it would happen. She willed herself to believe that. And if it was not destined, it would not happen.  David and Simon were here. To say anything to David about Simon's mission to France was to doom one man, perhaps both. It might be the man who loved her, or it might be the man she loved. And she did not want either to die.  \"Sophia, I beg you, speak to me! Are you turning against me?\"  She wiped her streaming eyes to see Simon standing before her, his arms hanging at his sides, his face agonized.  _I cannot doom this young man._  She took deep breaths to calm herself enough to speak to him.  \"Simon, I pray that God will bless and protect you.\" She stifled a sob. \"I cannot marry you. You must forget me.\"  He scrambled to his feet, his arms outstretched. \"Do not turn from me, Sophia. I would rather have you kill me.\"  \"No!\" It came out of her as a scream. She turned and started to run, holding up the hem of her long skirt to keep from tripping. Her anguish was like a giant's hand that had seized her heart and was crushing it.  She ran like a hunted animal, tripping on rocks, turning her ankle in hollow places. She could only hope she was running toward the road.  \"Sophia!\"  She looked back over her shoulder. He was following her out of the forest, but at a distance. He was walking, staggering like a wounded man.  \"Forgive me, Simon!\" She ran on.  A pine branch struck her across the face, and she cried out in pain. But she felt that she deserved it. She ducked under the branch and kept running, seeing brighter light among the dark rows of tree trunks now. The road must be that way.  She forced her way through a tangle of shrubbery and was out on the road. Simon's scudiero, standing with their string of horses, stared at her wide-eyed. The huge Riccardo, Sophia's escort, was with him, talking. They were standing with their backs to a roadside statue of the Virgin in a little protective shed.  At the sight of Sophia, Riccardo rushed to her, looming over her protectively. \"Madonna! What has happened to you? Dio mio! Did he--\"  His eyes were wide with outrage, but there was anxiety in his face too. He must be wondering whether he would have to fight a nobleman.  \"I am not hurt--he did nothing. He did nothing!\" Sophia babbled, choking down sobs. \"Mount quickly, Riccardo, and let us go from here.\"  He held her horse, and she threw herself into the saddle. She spurred on without waiting to see if Riccardo was ready to follow.  When they came to a turning in the road, she looked back once. The scudiero stood alone with the horses. Simon had not yet emerged from the pine forest. She started to cry again. The pain in her chest was worse than ever. She silenced Riccardo's questions.  \"I cannot talk about it. He did no wrong to me. No harm. That is all you need to know.\"  _I cannot talk to anyone about it, ever. I am going to betray David. I pray God I never see Simon de Gobignon again._     XLVIII   Just as Sophia and Riccardo arrived at the Porta Maggiore in the city wall of Orvieto, the air around them seemed to glow and crackle. A cold wind blew across the road leading up to the gate. Sophia spurred her bay, but the horse hardly needed encouragement to gallop the last few paces to the shelter"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28518"],["title","Mex (#0)"],["body","William Logan, though he hails from Dodger territory,     tells a quiet story from down near the Mexican border, where men are     very close to ancestral memories and to the things which dwell in     the shadows. Logan is one of the more interesting of the newer     writers._   mex  _by ... WILLIAM LOGAN_    Perhaps it was just as well that I  did not tell them what I was....   What they called me, that was what started it. I'm as good an American as the next fellow, and maybe a little bit better than men like that, big men drinking in a bar who can't find anything better to do than to spit on a man and call him Mex. As if a Mexican is something to hide or to be ashamed of. We have our own heroes and our own strength and we don't have to bend down to men like that, or any other men. But when they called me that I saw red and called them names back.  \"Mex kid,\" one of the men said, a big red-haired bully with his sleeves rolled back and muscles like ropes on the big hairy arms. \"Snot-nosed little Mex brat.\"  I called him a name. He only laughed back at me and turned his back, waving a hand for the bartender. Maybe in a big city in the North it would be different and probably it would not: this toleration we hear about is no more good than an open fight, and there must be understanding instead. But here near the border, just on the American side of the border, a Mexican is called fair game, and a seventeen-year-old like me is less than nothing to them, to the white ones who go to the big bars.  I thought carefully about what to do, and finally when I had made my mind up I went for him and tried to hit him. But other men held me back, and I was kicking and shouting with my legs off the ground. When I stopped they put me down, so I started for the big red-haired man again and they had to stop me again. The red-haired man was laughing all this time. I wanted to run, back to my own family in their little house, and yet running would have been wrong; I was too angry to run, so I stayed.  \"My sister,\" I said. \"My sister is a witch and I will get her to put a curse on you.\" I was very angry, you must understand this.  And of course they had no idea that my sister is a real witch, and her curses are real, and only last year Manuel Valdez had died from the effects of her curse. Of all people, sometimes I wish I were my sister most of all, to curse people and see them shrivel and sicken and choke and die.  \"Go ahead, half-pint,\" one of the other men yelled. \"Get your sister to put a curse on me. I bet she knows who I am; I been with every Mex girl this side of the border.\"  This made me see red; my sister is pure and must be pure, since she is a witch. And she is not like some of the others even aside from that. I have heard her talk about them and I know.  I called him a name and ran up to him and hit him; my fist against his solid side felt good, but some other men pulled me off again. Yet it was impossible to leave. This was wrong for me, and I had to make it right. \"I shall get my father to fight you, since he is a giant ten feet tall.\"  The men laughed at me, not knowing, of course, that my father is a giant ten feet tall in truth, and my mother a sweet siren like those in the books, the old books, with spells in her eyes and a strange power. They did not know I was not a daydreaming child but a man who told truth.  And they laughed; I grew angry again and told them many things, calling them names in Spanish, which they did not understand. That only made them laugh the more.  Finally I left; it was necessary for me to leave, since I was not wanted. But it was necessary, too, for me to make things right. Nights later they were dead for what they had said and done.  For I tell the truth always, and I had told them about my sister and my father and my mother. But one thing I had not told them.  I am sorry they could never know I was the winged thing that frightened and killed them, one by one....
