You see, we know all about your little plan to desert your comrades, held by the Aranians as hostages, and to grasp all the glory of your findings for yourself. But--the plan doesn't work. We're going back.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Tipene's face drained a dirty yellow--a Zenian can never be actually pale.  \"You ... how....\" he floundered.  \"A menore, under your pillow,\" I explained crisply. \"But that doesn't matter, now. You will guide us to the spot where you found the Aranian city, and establish communication with the Aranians. When that's done, I'll give you further orders.\"  \"And if I won't?\" breathed Tipene, his teeth clenched in a shaking rage.  \"But you will. Otherwise, we'll permit you to continue your explorations on this interesting little sphere--minus your protective suit.\"  Tipene stared at me with horror-stricken eyes. I think he saw that I meant exactly what I said--and I was not bluffing.  \"I--I'll do it,\" he said.  \"Then watch the river carefully,\" I ordered. \"Kincaide, lift her just enough so we can get a good view of the river. Tipene will tell you where to set her down.\"  Navigating visually, Kincaide followed the winding course of the river, covering in a few minutes a distance it had taken the scientists a day to navigate.  \"There--there is the place,\" said Tipene suddenly. \"Just this side of the patch of vegetation.\"  \"Very good. And remember what happens if you play any tricks,\" I nodded grimly. \"Descend to within a few yards of the ground, Mr. Kincaide; we'll drop Tipene through the trap.\"  Correy hurried the prisoner away, and I ordered the trap in the bottom of the _Ertak's_ hull to be opened.  \"Now,\" I informed Tipene, \"we'll let you down and you will establish communication with the Aranians. Tell them you have brought back, not tribute, but an enemy powerful enough to blast their entire city out of existence. It will be a simple matter for you to picture what an atomic grenade or one of the ship's rays will do. We'll arrange a little demonstration, if they're not convinced. And tell them that if they don't want to be wiped out, to bring Inverness and Brady to us, unharmed, as fast as their eight long legs will manage.\"  \"They won't do it,\" whined Tipene. \"They were very angry over the killing of those others. I'm just risking my life without the possibility of gain.\"  \"You obey my orders, or you go down and stay there,\" I said abruptly. \"Which?\"  \"I'll do as you say,\" he said, and the cage dropped with him swiftly.         *       *       *       *       *  As soon as he was on the ground he reached up and adjusted his menore, peering around anxiously. For several minutes nothing happened, and then, the length of the ship away, one of the great trap-doors flew open. Out of it came one of the spiders, not rust-red like those we had seen, but faded to a dirty yellow. Close behind him were two of the rust-red Aranians, which fell in one on each side of the yellow chap.  The first Aranian, I presumed--and rightly--was one of the old learned members of the race. As he scuttled closer to the cowering Tipene, I saw that, amidst the bristles which covered his head and thorax, was a menore.  The three great spiders approached the ship warily, watching it constantly with huge, glittering eyes. A safe distance away they paused, and the old one fixed his attention on Tipene.  Evidently, what Tipene emanated caused the old fellow to become very angry; I could see his legs quivering, and his withered old mandibles fairly clattered.  \"He says he won't do it!\" Tipene called up to me, excitedly. \"Says we can't reach them underground, and that they'll kill their hostages if we try to harm them.\"  \"Ask him if there are any tunnels between the ship and the river,\" I commanded. \"We'll demonstrate what we can do if he harms Inverness and Brady.\"  The two were in silent communion for a moment, and Tipene looked up and shook his head.  \"No,\" he shouted. \"No tunnels there. The water would seep into them.\"  \"Then tell him to watch!\"  I stepped back and pressed an attention signal.  \"Mr. Hendricks?\"  \"Yes, sir!\"  \"Open up with the starboard tube, full power, concentrated beam, at any spot halfway between here and the river. At once.\"  \"At once, sir!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The ray generators hummed instantly, their note deepening a moment later. The ray bit into the dry, sandy soil, boring steadily into the earth, making an opening over twice the height of a man in diameter.  The fine, reddish-brown dust of disintegration hung swirling above the mouth of the tunnel at first, and then, as the ray cut deeper into the earth, settled quickly and disappeared.  \"Cease operation, Mr. Hendricks!\" I commanded. \"Keep the generators on, and stand by for further orders.\"  As soon as Hendricks' quick acknowledgment came back, I called down to Tipene.  \"Tell your friend to inspect the little hole we drilled,\" I said. \"Tell him to crawl down into it, if he wishes to see how deep it is. And then inform him that we have several ray tubes like this one, and that if he does not immediately produce his hostages, unharmed, we'll rise above his city and blast out a crater big enough to bury the _Ertak_.\"  Tipene nodded and communicated with the aged Aranian, who had cowered from the shaft in the earth disintegrated by our ray, and who now, very cautiously, approached it, flanked by his two far from eager guards.  At the lip of the slanting tunnel he paused, peered downward, and then, circling cautiously, approached the lidded tunnel whence he had emerged.  \"He agrees,\" Tipene called up sullenly. \"He will deliver Inverness and Brady to us. But we must come and get them; he says they have barricaded themselves in one of the cubicles, and will not permit any Aranian to approach. They still have their atomic pistols; the Aranians did not realize they were weapons.\"  \"Very well; tell him a party from the ship will be ready in a few seconds. You will go with us as interpreter; you understand how to communicate with them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I pressed Correy's attention signal and he answered instantly.  \"Pick five good men for a landing party, two of them portable disintegrator ray operators, with equipment. The others will be provided with _ethon_ lamps, pistols, and atomic grenades. Get the men to the trap as quickly as possible, please.\"  \"Immediately, sir!\"  I had the cage drawn up, and by the time I had secured my own equipment and returned, Correy was waiting with his men.  \"One second, Mr. Correy, and we'll leave,\" I said, calling the navigating room. \"Mr. Kincaide, I'm leaving you in command. We are going into the Aranian city to pick up Inverness and Brady. I anticipate no trouble, and if there is no trouble, we shall return within an hour. If we are not back within three hours, blast this entire area with atomic grenades, and riddle it with the rays. Is that clear?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Kincaide.  \"And then proceed immediately to Base and report. I have made an entry in the log regarding this expedition, as official evidence, if needed.\"  \"Right, sir,\" said Kincaide, who was as near a perfect officer as I have ever seen.  \"Mr. Correy, you've heard my orders. So have you, men. We're going underground, into a veritable warren of these spider creatures. If any of you wish to refuse this service, you have my permission to withdraw.\"  Not a man moved. Correy hardly repressed a grin. He knew the men he had picked for the job.  \"Good!\" I said, and signaled to the cage operator. Swiftly we dropped to earth, where Tipene and our three hairy guides awaited us.         *       *       *       *       *  The descent into the white-lined tunnel was a terrifying experience. The lining was tough and fibrous, a sort of coarse material corresponding to the silk of a spider of normal size, although these strands were as large as my little finger, and strong as cables.  A close inspection of our guides added nothing to my confidence or bravery; their eight beady eyes, set at strategic spots about their heads, seemed unwinkingly ominous. And their mandibles, with fangs folded back like the blades of a pocket-knife, paired with their bristly palps, seemed like very capable weapons.  The Aranians ran ahead of us, our _ethon_ lamps making strange and distorted shadows on the curving walls of the tunnel. Correy and I herded the unwilling Tipene just ahead of us, and the five picked men brought up the rear.  About forty feet down, the floor of the tunnel curved sharply and leveled off; a short distance farther on a number of other level tunnels merged with it, and the shape changed; from a tube perfectly circular in cross-section, it became a flattened oval, perhaps half again the height of a man, and at least three times that dimension in width.  Our party was joined by scores of other Aranians, who darted in from side passages; some going ahead, some closing in behind us, until the tunnel was filled with the peculiar brittle sound of their walking.  \"They don't lack for numbers,\" muttered Correy softly. \"Think they'll make trouble, sir?\"  \"Your guess is as good as mine. I showed them what the ray would do; I believe it threw a scare into the old chap. Did you tell them what we would do if they played any tricks, Tipene?\"  \"Certainly; my own life is endangered, isn't it?\" snapped the Zenian.  \"It certainly is,\" I told him grimly. \"And not only by the spiders, if you make any suspicious moves.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We went on without further conversation, until we came to the beginning of the cubicles Tipene had mentioned.  Each of these was closed, or could be closed, by a circular door such as those which concealed the outer entrance to the tunnels, save that these were swung on a side hinge. From the central passage we were following, smaller ones branched off in all directions: to the left, to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29309"],["title","The Death-Traps of FX-31 (#4)"],["body","; upward and downward. And all were lined with the cubicles, from which a constantly increasing army of Aranians emerged to accompany us.  We had gone but a short distance into the \"city\" when our ancient guide paused, turning to stare down a deserted passage.  \"He says,\" grunted Tipene--as near a grunt as the high-pitched Zenian voice is capable of, \"that they're down there. He asks that we go and get them; he is afraid. They have killed two of the Aranians already with their atomic pistols.\"  \"For which I don't blame them in the least,\" said Correy. \"I'd get as many as I could before I let them sink their mandibles into me.\"  \"But I thought they were hostages, and being treated as such?\"  \"The Aranians got tired of waiting; some of the younger ones tried to do their own executing,\" explained Tipene. \"The whole brood of them is in an ugly mood, the old fellow tells me. We were fools to come!\"  I didn't argue the matter. You can't argue such a matter with a man like Tipene. Instead, I lifted my voice in a shout which echoed down the long corridors.  \"Brady! Inverness! Can you hear us?\"  For a moment there was no reply, and then, as our _ethon_ lights played hopefully along the passage, a circular door opened, and Inverness, his pistol drawn, peered out at us. A moment later, both he and Brady were running toward us.  \"Hanson!\" cried Inverness. \"Man, but we're glad to see a human face again--but why did you come? Now they've got us all.\"  \"But they'll let us all go,\" I said, with a confidence I did not feel. \"I've demonstrated to one of their leaders just what the _Ertak_ can do--and will do--if we aren't aboard, safe and unhurt, in three hours.\"  \"The young bloods don't obey well, though,\" said Brady, shaking his head. \"Look at them, milling around there in the central passage! They didn't see your demonstration, whatever it was. They started for us some time back, and we had to rip a couple of them to pieces, and barricade ourselves.\"  \"Well,\" said Correy grimly, \"we'll soon find out. Ready to start back, sir?\"         *       *       *       *       *  I turned to Tipene, who was staring at the packed mass of Aranians, who choked the tunnel in both directions.  \"Tell them to make way,\" I commanded. \"We're leaving.\"  \"I've--I've been in communication with him,\" moaned Tipene. \"And he hasn't any power over these youngsters. They want blood. Blood! They say the ship won't dare do anything so long as so many of us are here.\"  \"It will, though,\" I snapped. \"Kincaide will obey my orders to the letter. It'll be a wholesale slaughter, if we're not there by the specified time.\"  \"I know! I know!\" groaned Tipene. \"But I can't make them understand that. They can't appreciate the meaning of such discipline.\"  \"I believe that,\" put in Brady. \"Their state of society is still low in the scale. You shouldn't have come, Commander. Better the two of us than the whole group.\"  \"It may not be so simple as they think. Mr. Correy, shall we make a dash for it?\"  \"I'd be in favor of that, sir!\" he grinned.  \"Very well, you take three of the enlisted men, Mr. Correy, and give us a brisk rear-guard action when we get into the main passage--if we do. Use the grenades if you have to, but throw them as fast as possible, or we'll have the roof coming down on us.  \"The two ray operators and myself will try to open a way, backed up by Inverness and Brady. Understand, everybody?\" The men took the places I had indicated, nodding, and we stood at the mouth of the side tunnel, facing the main passage which intersected it at a right angle. The mouth of the passage was blocked by a crowded mass of the spider creatures, evidently eager to pounce on us, but afraid to start an action in those narrow quarters.  As we came toward them, the Aranians packed about the entrance gave way grudgingly, all save two or three. Without an instant's hesitation, I lifted my pistol and slashed them into jerking pulp.  \"Hold the ray,\" I ordered the two men by my side, \"until we need it. They'll get a surprise when it goes into action.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We needed it the moment we turned into the main corridor, for here the passage was broad, and in order to prevent the creatures from flanking us, we had to spread our front and rear guards until they were no more than two thin lines.  Seeing their advantage, the Aranians rushed us. At a word from me, the ray operators went into action, and I did what I could with my comparatively ineffective pistol. Between us, we swept the passage clean as far as we could see--which was not far, for the reddish dust of disintegration hung in the quiet air, and the light of our _ethon_ lamps could not pierce it.  For a moment I thought we would have clear sailing; Correy and his men were doing fine work behind us, and our ray was sweeping everything before us.  Then we came to the first of the intersecting passages, and a clattering horde of Aranians leaped out at us. The ray operators stopped them, but another passage on the opposite side was spewing out more than I could handle with my pistol.  Two of the hairy creatures were fairly upon me before the ray swung to that side and dissolved them into dust. For an instant the party stopped, checked by these unexpected flank attacks.  And there would be more of these sallies from the hundreds of passages which opened off the main corridor; I had no doubt of that. And there the creatures had us: our deadly ray could not reach them out ahead; we must wait until we were abreast, and then the single ray could work upon but one side. Correy needed every man he had to protect our rear, and my pistol was not adequate against a rush at such close quarters. That fact had just been proved to me with unpleasant emphasis.  It was rank folly to press on; the party would be annihilated.  \"Down this passage, men,\" I ordered the two ray operators. \"We'll have to think up a better plan.\"  They turned off into the passage they had swept clean with their ray, and the rest of the party followed swiftly. A few yards from the main corridor the passage turned and ran parallel to the corridor we had just left. Doors opened off this passage on both sides, but all the doors were open, and the cubicles thus revealed were empty.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well, sir,\" said Correy, when we had come to the dead end of the passage, \"now what?\"  \"I don't know,\" I confessed. \"If we had two ray machines, we could make it. But if I remember correctly, it's seven hundred yards, yet, to the first of the tunnels leading to the surface--and that means several hundred side passages from which they can attack. We can't make it.\"  \"Well, we can try again, anyway, sir,\" Correy replied stoutly. \"Better to go down fighting than stay here and starve, eh?\"  \"If you'll pardon me, gentlemen,\" put in Inverness, \"I'd like to make a suggestion. We can't return the way we came in; I'm convinced of that. It was the sheerest luck that Commander Hanson wasn't brought down a moment ago--luck, and excellent work on the part of the two ray operators.  \"But an analysis of our problem shows that our real objective is to reach the surface, and that need not be done the most obvious way, by returning over the course by which we entered.\"  \"How, then?\" I asked sharply.  \"The disintegrator ray you have there should be able to cut a passage for us,\" said Inverness. \"Then all we need do is protect our rear while the operators are working. Once on the surface, we'll be able to fight our way to the ship, will we not?\"  \"Of course! You should be in command, Inverness, instead of myself.\" His was the obvious solution to our difficulty; once proposed, I felt amazingly stupid that the thought had not occurred to me.  I gave the necessary orders to the ray men, and they started immediately, boring in steadily at an angle of about forty-five degrees.  The reddish dust came back to us in choking clouds, and the Aranians, perhaps guessing what we were doing--at least one of their number had seen how the ray could tunnel in the ground--started working around the angle of the passage.         *       *       *       *       *  At first they came in small groups, and our pistols readily disposed of them, but as the dust filled the air, and it became increasingly difficult to see their spidery bodies, they rushed us in great masses.  Correy and I, shoulder to shoulder, fired at the least sign of movement in the cloud of dust. A score of times the rushes of the Aranians brought a few of them scuttling almost to our feet; inside of a few minutes the passage was choked, waist high, with the riddled bodies--and still they came!  \"We're through, sir!\" shouted one of the ray operators. \"If you can hold them off another fifteen minutes, we'll have the hole large enough to crawl through.\"  \"Work fast!\" I ordered. Even with Inverness, Brady, and the three of the _Ertak's_ crew doing what they could in those narrow quarters, we were having a hard time holding back the horde of angry, desperate Aranians. Tipene was useless; he was cowering beside the ray operators, chattering at them, urging them to hurry.  Had we had good light, our task would have been easy, but the passage was choked now with dust. Our _ethon_ lamps made little more than a dismal glow. The clattering Aranians were almost within leaping distance before we could see them; indeed, more than one was stopped in mid-air by a spray from one pistol or another.  \"Ready, sir,\" gasped the ray man who had spoken before. \"I think we've got it large enough, now.\"  \"Good!\" I brought down two scuttling Aranians, so close that their twitching legs fell in an untidy heap almost at my feet. \"You go first, and protect our advance. Then the rest of you; Mr. Correy and I will bring up the--\"  \"No!\" screamed Tipene, shouldering aside the ray men. \"I....\" He disappeared into the slanting shaft, and the two ray men followed quickly. The three members of the crew went next; then Brady and"]]]
