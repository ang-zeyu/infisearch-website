She hung her head.  \"But it is true, Redbird, you have done nothing,\" Wolf Paw said more softly. \"I am the only one who knows that you were about to break the law.\"  _Sun Woman knows. But Wolf Paw will never learn that from me._  \"I do not want you to die, Redbird,\" said the low voice from the figure towering over her.  She looked up at him. Was he going to be merciful?  He said, \"It makes me angry that you throw your life away for that fatherless pale eyes boy. To wed the son of Black Hawk would bring you honor.\"  She understood now. He was going to offer to spare her life, if she would marry him and give up Gray Cloud. He did not understand that she would rather be dead twice over than spend her life mourning Gray Cloud and married to Wolf Paw.  She was about to tell him so when she heard a rumble, almost like thunder, from the trees nearer the camp. With much whinnying and cracking of shrubbery, all the band's horses burst out of the woods and ran, floundering and kicking up clouds of snow, out on the prairie.  \"Be still,\" Wolf Paw cautioned in a low voice, \"until we see what frightened them.\" He stood with his head high, listening.  Whatever it was, she was grateful that it had taken Wolf Paw's mind off her.  She heard a crashing in the forest, branches breaking, snow crunching. Something large was coming toward them.  She turned. Through the trees she saw a bulky, hunched figure. It seemed to be a large animal, but it was walking on its hind legs. It came forward slowly, a step at a time. Its forelimbs swung at its sides. It was a little taller than a man.  It looked very much like a bear. A new fear, greater than the fear of what Wolf Paw might do, assailed her.  A bear in coldest winter, when all of that people withdrew to their dens and slept? Once in a while, she had heard, a very hungry bear would awaken and forage for food and then go back to sleep again. Such a bear would kill anything it met. She tensed herself to run, though she knew she could never outrun a hungry bear.  The shambling tread of the bear, or whatever it was, had brought it closer, and she saw that it was all white, glittering in the moonlight like a snowdrift.  She glanced at Wolf Paw and saw his eyes glisten as they widened. The look on his shadowed face was one she never thought to see on him--fear.  He sucked in a shuddering breath. The hand that had held her arm suddenly released her.  No wonder Wolf Paw was afraid. This was a white bear, a spirit bear. Its eyes, reflecting the moonlight, seemed to glow.  Wolf Paw uttered a terrified, inarticulate cry. She turned to see him racing over the snow. Were she not so frightened herself, she might have laughed to see how his knees flew up, first one, then the other, as white clouds sprayed from his snowshoes. Strong as he was, he could never outrun a bear. Especially not this bear.  As for herself, she was surely doomed. She thought, _May this be a better death than drowning under the ice_.  And she turned to face the spirit bear.     3  Claw Marks   The white bear was out of the forest now. Redbird had seen bears run, and she knew it could cover the distance that separated them in a few bounds.  It did not seem to be looking at her, and she wondered if it saw her. It sparkled in the moonlight. Its breath came in huge frosty clouds, obscuring its head. Did spirit bears breathe?  She looked around again to see where Wolf Paw was. He had become a small, dark spot against the white at the edge of the village. His snowshoes had carried him far quickly. She, too, would have run, if she could run like Wolf Paw.  She did not think Wolf Paw a coward. His courage was well known. Facing a being like this, the bravest man in the world would run.  _It doesn't seem to see me. Maybe it is best to stand still._  She trembled from head to foot, unable to decide what to do. She felt dizzy, as if she might collapse into the snow. The bright light that seemed to come from the bear dazzled her.  But would a spirit bear attack people in the night and kill them? Devils and cannibal giants would, but she had never heard of a spirit doing any such thing.  She was learning to be a medicine woman, and a medicine woman must deal unafraid with the beings of the other world. Talk the bad spirits out of a sick person's body and call upon the good spirits to aid in healing.  She took a deep breath. Whether this be a good spirit or a devil, she would stand here holding herself proudly. Wolf Paw, if he looked back, would see the maiden he had threatened standing in the place he had run from.  The white bear took a step toward her.  In spite of her fear, she made herself look at the spirit as it came on. It walked so slowly. Perhaps, after all, she could run away from it.  Under the pointed snout she saw eyes that seemed to glow out of a shadowed face.  It was a man she was facing.  She saw that its path was taking it past her. It--he--did not seem to see her at all. But he was close enough now for her to see the face under the bear's skull. The large, round eyes, the long, thin features ending in a pointed chin, the bony beak of a nose, the down-curving, tender mouth. His face was covered with a mask of frost.  Gray Cloud.  How could she have forgotten that when he walked out of the camp yesterday he had worn a black bear's skin draped over his arms and shoulders? Snow and frost had turned the fur white. The night and her terror had tricked her into thinking she saw a white bear spirit. Wolf Paw, the seasoned warrior, had been tricked and terrified, too.  Gray Cloud was alive!  A scream tried to force its way out of her chest, but her windpipe was so tight that all she managed was a gasp.  Joy blazed up in her like a summer campfire.  But no--he could not be alive and look like that. What she was seeing must be the ghost of Gray Cloud, or his dead body walking. The cold and snow had killed him there in the sacred cave, and this shuffling, frozen husk was all that was left of him.  \"Gray Cloud,\" she whispered, unable to speak aloud, \"talk to me.\"  If he walked right past her without seeing her, he must be still on his spirit journey. She had always heard that the bodies of men on a spirit journey remained motionless, sitting or lying down. But she was certain that Gray Cloud was not fully awake.  She stood staring at him, her mouth open, as he shambled on past her.  She slowly turned to follow him, and now she was facing into the moonlight and seeing the shadows of the snow-covered wickiups. He was walking in that frighteningly slow, measured way toward the village. Wolf Paw was nowhere to be seen.  The feeling came to her again of other eyes upon her. Besides Wolf Paw, besides the strange creature Gray Cloud had become, someone else seemed to be out here in the snow-covered field with her. She shuddered.  She looked around to see if she could guess where the secret watcher might be hiding. Someone might be crouching behind one of the long snowdrifts that rippled across the prairie like waves on a lake. Or in the trees by the river.  She must not let herself be caught out here. She picked up the blanket roll and water skin that Wolf Paw had thrown into the snow and padded on her snowshoes after the lumbering white figure. She must hurry and try to get to a place where her presence would be unnoticed, or if noticed, not questioned.  Her legs ached. She did not have the strength to run. Gray Cloud had left a trail of two shallow furrows in the snow where he had pushed his legs through and the snow had fallen in behind him. On her snowshoes she pressed on behind him.  Even though the snowshoes helped her, her legs ached. She wanted to throw down her burdens of blanket roll and water skin, but they were too valuable for her to let them be lost out here. Merciless pain shot up from her shins through her knees to her hips. Still, the miseries felt by her body could not touch the joy of her spirit. Gray Cloud lived.  A wall of fur coated with white snow loomed up before her. As Gray Cloud lumbered along, she quickly stepped to the side and hurried around him.  She turned for a closer look at him. His steaming breath obscured his face. He stopped. He swayed, and the bear's skull fell back from his lolling head. She screamed, a sound that rang distantly in her ears.  Gray Cloud dropped to his knees, then fell forward on his face, sending up a great puff of powdery snow that glittered in the moonlit air.  The silence after his fall was as stunning as thunder. Redbird felt tears stream from her eyes--and freeze at once on her cheeks. That he should have lived through two nights of blizzard and cold, that he should come down alive from the sacred cave, only to die within sight of the village under her very eyes, was more than she could stand.  \"Oh, no!\" she whispered. \"He must not die.\"  She fell to her knees beside him.  He lay face down, half buried. She put her hands under his shoulder and pushed to raise his head. He was heavy, but her fear and her love for him made her strong enough to move him. She lifted his upper body and turned him on his side, and she saw the beloved features, frost-white. Hope made her heart beat faster as little clouds of warm air puffed from his nostrils. But his breathing was ragged and shallow. She had to get him in out of the cold. Gasping with the effort, she rolled him over on his back.  She would have to try to drag him to the village.  Sobbing with near-exhaustion, she sat by his head, shoved her hands under his shoulders and tried to stand, pulling him up with her.  All at once there was no weight on her arms. Someone else was there, lifting Gray Cloud.  She looked up, thankful, yet afraid she might see Wolf Paw returned to do them harm.  No, it was Iron Knife.  Seeing the broad face of her half brother, a cry of relief burst from her throat.  \"Oh, Iron Knife! It is so good you are here.\"  He smiled grimly, grunting as he hauled"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28976"],["title","Shaman (#7)"],["body"," Cloud to his feet. Gray Cloud's eyes were shut, his mouth hanging open.  \"Lucky for Wolf Paw that Gray Cloud came when he did,\" Iron Knife said. \"I was getting an arrow ready for Wolf Paw.\" He jerked his head at the bow slung over his shoulder.  \"Even the son of Black Hawk?\" She vividly remembered Wolf Paw's threats, but the thought of Iron Knife murdering him horrified her.  \"Do you think I'd let him drown my sister?\" Iron Knife put an arm around Gray Cloud's shoulders, bent down and picked him up under the knees, bearskin cloak and all. Blowing a cloud of steam out of his mouth, he straightened, cradling Gray Cloud in his arms. Though Gray Cloud was nearly as tall as Iron Knife, he was much lighter.  It was Iron Knife, she realized, whose eyes she had felt on her after Wolf Paw ran away.  They started off for the camp. She heard the voices of men and women raised, calling to one another. Wolf Paw must have given the alarm.  \"How did you know I was out here?\" she asked. \"You were sleeping when I left the wickiup.\"  \"Father woke me,\" Iron Knife said, striding stolidly along, his calf-high outer moccasins of buffalo hide breaking through the snow. \"He knew what you were going to do. He told me to go after you, to see you came to no harm.\"  As they plowed steadily onward, Redbird saw figures moving about in the village. They must be terribly sleepy, she thought. Dawn was still a long way off. Still, more and more people were running back and forth among the wickiups. They were crowding in this direction, coming to meet Gray Cloud and Iron Knife and Redbird. A mass of people, dark against the moonlit snow.  In the front rank walked Owl Carver himself. The sacred necklace of megis shells swung on his chest. In one hand he held his medicine stick, a cedar staff decorated with feathers and beads, topped with the carved head of an owl. His long white hair spread out over his shoulders.  She could hear a murmuring of voices, and above them, the shaman, her father, singing:      \"Let the people welcome him.     He has walked the spirit trail.     He comes back     From the sky,     From the water,     From under the earth.     He comes back from the seven directions.     Let the people welcome him.\"  Owl Carver was dancing as he approached them, a slow, heavy shuffle alternating with sidesteps, his upper body rising and falling. His hands, one holding his medicine stick, the other a yellow and red gourd rattle, were lifted high over his head. The necklace of small black and white shells bounced on his chest.  Iron Knife, carrying Gray Cloud, came to a stop before Owl Carver. Redbird, not wanting people to know how she cared for Gray Cloud, drew away from Iron Knife and tried to melt into the crowd.  Taking a few more steps, Owl Carver placed himself facing east, with Iron Knife and Gray Cloud on his right. He danced in a sunwise circle around them, from east to south to west to north, bobbing his head and singing.      \"The Great Wise One has sent him.     He has walked the spirit trail.     He brings wisdom     From the sky,     From the water,     From under the earth.     He comes back from the seven directions.     The Great Wise One has sent him.\"  Nine times Owl Carver danced around Gray Cloud and Iron Knife in the circle that represented the sun, the horizon and the cycles of life and the seasons.  Then in his normal voice, not breaking step, he said, \"Bring him to my medicine wickiup.\"  He turned abruptly and danced through the crowd that had gathered. The people parted to let him through and they stared at Gray Cloud's body in Iron Knife's arms.  The people who had followed Owl Carver had stamped down a path through the village. No longer needing Sun Woman's snowshoes, Redbird bent and unstrapped them from her feet. She was suddenly so exhausted by her efforts and by the fear and sleeplessness of two days that she could hardly stumble along behind Iron Knife. She felt that at any moment she might faint.  The light of the full moon, shining down from directly overhead and reflecting on the snow, seemed to make the whole village almost as bright as day. Sighing, Redbird looked up and saw Wolf Paw staring at her from beside the path.  His black eyes pierced her like arrowheads. Under his sharp nose his mouth was tight.  She nodded her head at him, hoping he would understand that she was saying that they should keep each other's secrets.  \"Redbird!\" A hand seized her arm roughly, and pain shot through up to her shoulder.  Her mother, Wind Bends Grass, glared at her furiously.  \"Why did you leave our wickiup?\"  Redbird felt that if she stopped walking to talk she would never be able to move again. She pulled her arm free. Her sisters, clinging to either side of her mother, stared up wide-eyed at her as if she herself had returned from a spirit journey.  Her mother walked beside her, scolding her in a shrill voice, but her words meant nothing to Redbird. She only wanted to see Gray Cloud brought safely to the shaman's wickiup.  Someone else took her arm, squeezing it gently, and she looked up into Sun Woman's face. Tears streaked the strong cheekbones.  \"You saved his life,\" Sun Woman said, so softly only Redbird could hear the words.  \"I did nothing,\" Redbird protested. Silently, Sun Woman took the snowshoes, the water bag and the blanket roll from her.  Owl Carver stopped at the doorway of the medicine wickiup. He danced from one foot to the other, shaking his staff.  He nodded at Iron Knife, and motioned him to carry Gray Cloud into the dark interior.  Redbird followed. The owl-headed stick barred her way.  \"Go with your mother,\" Owl Carver said softly. \"You have done enough this night.\"  She could not tell whether he was praising or reproaching her.  _Will he live?_ she wanted to ask. But his solemn face forbade her to speak.  She turned away from his remoteness and faced her mother's anger. Her heart was still full of terror for Gray Cloud, but she knew that the instant she lay down she would fall into an exhausted sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  It seemed that no time had passed when Wind Bends Grass shook her awake.  \"Your father calls the people together,\" she said in a voice still hard with anger.  Redbird's eyelids felt as if they were made of stone. She forced herself to sit up, and then with immense effort got to her feet.  She was still fully dressed, even in her fur cloak and mittens. She had collapsed in the wickiup without removing anything. The wickiup was now empty. Her mother and her sisters had gone ahead without her.  Her heart hammered in her chest. Owl Carver might be calling the people to tell them that Gray Cloud was dead.  Outside, the air was still deathly cold, but the sun was a bright yellow disk rising above the distant gray line of trees that marked the bluffs overlooking the Great River. The light made her blink, and she turned away from it. She stumbled in the direction all the other people were going--to the medicine wickiup in the center of the camp circle.  She found that the open area before the wickiup was crowded, and she could not get close. The spaces between nearby wickiups were also filled with people, all waiting for Owl Carver to speak.  She seated herself between two women, both of whom had small children on their laps. Redbird knew one of the mothers, Water Flows Fast, a stout woman with a round, cheerful face and shrewd eyes.  Water Flows Fast said, \"You are the daughter of Owl Carver. You should go up and sit close to him.\" Redbird sliced her hand flat across her body to say no. She knew Water Flows Fast to be a keen observer and a gossip, always looking for signs of trouble in other people's families. The less Redbird said to her, the better.  Redbird looked over her shoulder and saw that now there were many more people packed in behind her. Everyone was talking at once, and the hundreds of voices beating upon her ears made her head hurt. About five hundred people were here, everyone in this camp, which was one of four that made up the British Band of the Sauk and Fox tribes that would come together in Saukenuk after the winter snow and ice melted.  The medicine wickiup was built on a low hill in the center of the camp, and when Owl Carver appeared, everyone who was standing sat down. Redbird's eyes devoured Owl Carver's face, trying to read in it whether Gray Cloud was alive or dead.  Another man emerged from the medicine wickiup to stand beside Owl Carver. His head was bare even on this terribly cold day, and he wore his hair in the manner of a brave, his dark brown scalp shaved except for a long black scalplock that coiled down the side of his face. His eyes were shadowed and sad-looking, and there were heavy blue-black pouches under them. His cheekbones jutted out and his mouth was wide, curving down at the corners where it met deep furrows that ran from nose to chin.  Redbird's heart beat faster as she saw that to honor this moment he had attached a string of eagle feathers to his scalplock and wore strings of small white beads around the rim of each ear. He stood with his arms folded under a buffalo robe, skin side out, painted with a red hand proclaiming that he had killed and scalped his first enemy while still a boy.  His sombre gaze fell upon Redbird like a stone striking her from a great height. She felt as if the war chief of the British Band knew every one of her secrets. She ducked her head and looked down at her mittened hands in her lap.  Owl Carver raised his arms, and the people fell silent.  \"I have called on Black Hawk, our war chief, to see Gray Cloud, and he has heard great prophecies from Gray Cloud's lips,\" the shaman cried in a high, chanting voice.  Then Gray Cloud had lived through the night!  Owl Carver blurred in Redbird's sight, and if she had not already been seated, she might have collapsed. Relief made her heart swell up in her chest, feeling as if it might burst.  The people around her murmured in surprise,"]]]
