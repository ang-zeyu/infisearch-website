Flickers!    Flickers!    Flickers!     APPLIANCES FOR AIR PLANES   What  \"SKID\"  was to our forefathers on the ground,  \"PITCH\"  is to their sons in the air.  The popularity of the large, unwieldy, slow, expensive Dirigible over the light, swift Plane is mainly due to the former's immunity from pitch.  Collison's forward-socketed Air Van renders it impossible for any plane to pitch. The C. F. S. is automatic, simple as a shutter, certain as a power hammer, safe as oxygen. Fitted to any make of plane.
