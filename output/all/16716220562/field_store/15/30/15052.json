Mr. Sherlock Holmes         Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings,       save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all       night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the       hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left       behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood,       bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.”       Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch       across. “To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the       C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just       such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to       carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.        “Well, Watson, what do you make of it?”        Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no       sign of my occupation.        “How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in       the back of your head.”        “I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in       front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of       our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss       him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir       becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an       examination of it.”        “I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my       companion, “that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical       man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of       their appreciation.”        “Good!” said Holmes. “Excellent!”        “I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a       country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on       foot.”        “Why so?”        “Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has       been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town       practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so       it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with       it.”        “Perfectly sound!” said Holmes.        “And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should       guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose       members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which       has made him a small presentation in return.”        “Really, Watson, you excel yourself,” said Holmes, pushing back       his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in       all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own       small achievements you have habitually underrated your own       abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you       are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius       have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear       fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”        He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words       gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his       indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had       made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think       that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way       which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands       and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with       an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and       carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a       convex lens.        “Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his       favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two       indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several       deductions.”        “Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I       trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have       overlooked?”        “I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were       erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be       frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided       towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this       instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he       walks a good deal.”        “Then I was right.”        “To that extent.”        “But that was all.”        “No, no, my dear Watson, not all—by no means all. I would       suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more       likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when       the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words       ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”        “You may be right.”        “The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a       working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our       construction of this unknown visitor.”        “Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing       Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”        “Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”        “I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has       practised in town before going to the country.”        “I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look       at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable       that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends       unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the       moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the       hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there       has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from       a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching       our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the       occasion of the change?”        “It certainly seems probable.”        “Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the _staff_       of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London       practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not       drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the       hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a       house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior       student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So       your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin       air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under       thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of       a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger       than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”        I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his       settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.        “As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I,       “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars       about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small       medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the       name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our       visitor. I read his record aloud.          “Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.         House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.         Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology, with         essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’  Corresponding member         of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of ‘Some Freaks of         Atavism’ (_Lancet_ 1882).  ‘Do We Progress?’ (_Journal of         Psychology_, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of         Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”        “No mention of that local hunt, Watson,” said Holmes with a       mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely       observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As       to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable,       unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is       only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only       an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country,       and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his       visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”        “And the dog?”        “Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master.       Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle,       and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s       jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in       my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It       may have been—yes, by Jove, it _is_ a curly-haired spaniel.”        He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the       recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his       voice that I glanced up in surprise.    "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2852"],["title","The Hound of the Baskervilles (#1)"],["body","    “My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”        “For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our       very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I       beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your       presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment       of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is       walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.       What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock       Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!”        The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had       expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin       man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two       keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from       behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a       professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was       dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was       already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head       and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes       fell upon the stick in Holmes’s hand, and he ran towards it with       an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not       sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I       would not lose that stick for the world.”        “A presentation, I see,” said Holmes.        “Yes, sir.”        “From Charing Cross Hospital?”        “From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”        “Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Holmes, shaking his head.        Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment.       “Why was it bad?”        “Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your       marriage, you say?”        “Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all       hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home       of my own.”        “Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Holmes.       “And now, Dr. James Mortimer—”        “Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”        “And a man of precise mind, evidently.”        “A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the       shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr.       Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not—”        “No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.”        “Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in       connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much,       Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or       such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any       objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A       cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would       be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my       intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”        Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are       an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am       in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make       your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”        The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the       other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers       as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.        Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the       interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume,       sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of       examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here       last night and again today?”        “No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of       doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I       recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am       suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary       problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest       expert in Europe—”        “Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?”       asked Holmes with some asperity.        “To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur       Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”        “Then had you not better consult him?”        “I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a       practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone.       I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”        “Just a little,” said Holmes. “I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would       do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly       what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my       assistance.”     Chapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles         “I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.        “I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.        “It is an old manuscript.”        “Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”        “How can you say that, sir?”        “You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all       the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert       who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.       You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.       I put that at 1730.”        “The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his       breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir       Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three       months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say       that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.       He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as       unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very       seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did       eventually overtake him.”        Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it       upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of       the long _s_ and the short. It is one of several indications       which enabled me to fix the date.”        I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded       script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in       large, scrawling figures: “1742.”        “It appears to be a statement of some sort.”        “Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the       Baskerville family.”        “But I understand that it is something more modern and practical       upon which you wish to consult me?”        “Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be       decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and       is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I       will read it to you.”        Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,       and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer       turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking       voice the following curious, old-world narrative:          “Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been         many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo         Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also         had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it         occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you         believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may         also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy         but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed.  Learn         then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but         rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul         passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not         again be loosed to our undoing.              “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the             history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most             earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of             Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be             gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.              This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing             that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there             was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his             name a by-word through the West.  It chanced that this Hugo             came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known             under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held             lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,             being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,             for she feared his evil name.  So it came to pass that one             Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and             wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off             the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he             well knew.  When they had brought her to the Hall the             maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his             friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly             custom.  Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her             wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths             which came up to her from below, for they say that the             words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were             such as might blast the man who said them.  At last in the             stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted             the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the             growth of ivy which covered (an"]]]
