TRESHAM.                           --But add to that,      The worthiness and grace and dignity      Of your proposal for uniting both      Our Houses even closer than respect      Unites them now--add these, and you must grant      One favour more, nor that the least,--to think      The welcome I should give;--'tis given!  My lord,      My only brother, Austin:  he's the king's.      Our cousin, Lady Guendolen--betrothed      To Austin:  all are yours.       MERTOUN.                    I thank you--less      For the expressed commendings which your seal,      And only that, authenticates--forbids      My putting from me... to my heart I take      Your praise... but praise less claims my gratitude,      Than the indulgent insight it implies      Of what must needs be uppermost with one      Who comes, like me, with the bare leave to ask,      In weighed and measured unimpassioned words,      A gift, which, if as calmly 'tis denied,      He must withdraw, content upon his cheek,      Despair within his soul.  That I dare ask      Firmly, near boldly, near with confidence      That gift, I have to thank you.  Yes, Lord Tresham,      I love your sister--as you'd have one love      That lady... oh more, more I love her!  Wealth,      Rank, all the world thinks me, they're yours, you know,      To hold or part with, at your choice--but grant      My true self, me without a rood of land,      A piece of gold, a name of yesterday,      Grant me that lady, and you... Death or life?       GUENDOLEN.  [apart to AUSTIN].  Why, this is loving,      Austin!       AUSTIN.    He's so young!       GUENDOLEN.  Young?  Old enough, I think, to half surmise      He never had obtained an entrance here,      Were all this fear and trembling needed.       AUSTIN.                                   Hush!      He reddens.       GUENDOLEN.  Mark him, Austin; that's true love!      Ours must begin again.       TRESHAM.                We'll sit, my lord.      Ever with best desert goes diffidence.      I may speak plainly nor be misconceived      That I am wholly satisfied with you      On this occasion, when a falcon's eye      Were dull compared with mine to search out faults,      Is somewhat.  Mildred's hand is hers to give      Or to refuse.       MERTOUN.     But you, you grant my suit?      I have your word if hers?       TRESHAM.                   My best of words      If hers encourage you.  I trust it will.      Have you seen Lady Mildred, by the way?       MERTOUN.  I... I... our two demesnes, remember, touch,      I have beer used to wander carelessly      After my stricken game:  the heron roused      Deep in my woods, has trailed its broken wing      Thro' thicks and glades a mile in yours,--or else      Some eyass ill-reclaimed has taken flight      And lured me after her from tree to tree,      I marked not whither.  I have come upon      The lady's wondrous beauty unaware,      And--and then... I have seen her.       GUENDOLEN [aside to AUSTIN].  Note that mode      Of faltering out that, when a lady passed,      He, having eyes, did see her!  You had said--      \"On such a day I scanned her, head to foot;      Observed a red, where red should not have been,      Outside her elbow; but was pleased enough      Upon the whole.\"  Let such irreverent talk      Be lessoned for the future!       TRESHAM.                     What's to say      May be said briefly.  She has never known      A mother's care; I stand for father too.      Her beauty is not strange to you, it seems--      You cannot know the good and tender heart,      Its girl's trust and its woman's constancy,      How pure yet passionate, how calm yet kind,      How grave yet joyous, how reserved yet free      As light where friends are--how imbued with lore      The world most prizes, yet the simplest, yet      The... one might know I talked of Mildred--thus      We brothers talk!       MERTOUN.           I thank you.       TRESHAM.                         In a word,      Control's not for this lady; but her wish      To please me outstrips in its subtlety      My power of being pleased:  herself creates      The want she means to satisfy.  My heart      Prefers your suit to her as 'twere its own.      Can I say more?       MERTOUN.         No more--thanks, thanks--no more!       TRESHAM.  This matter then discussed...       MERTOUN.                                 --We'll waste no breath      On aught less precious.  I'm beneath the roof      Which holds her:  while I thought of that, my speech      To you would wander--as it must not do,      Since as you favour me I stand or fall.      I pray you suffer that I take my leave!       TRESHAM.  With less regret 'tis suffered, that again      We meet, I hope, so shortly.       MERTOUN.                      We? again?--      Ah yes, forgive me--when shall... you will crown      Your goodness by forthwith apprising me      When... if... the lady will appoint a day      For me to wait on you--and her.       TRESHAM.                         So soon      As I am made acquainted with her thoughts      On your proposal--howsoe'er they lean--      A messenger shall bring you the result.       MERTOUN.  You cannot bind me more to you, my lord.      Farewell till we renew... I trust, renew      A converse ne'er to disunite again.       TRESHAM.  So may it prove!       MERTOUN.                    You, lady, you, sir, take      My humble salutation!       GUENDOLEN and AUSTIN.    Thanks!       TRESHAM.                          Within there!           [Servants enter.  TRESHAM conducts MERTOUN to the door.            Meantime AUSTIN remarks,]                                                       Well,      Here I have an advantage of the Earl,      Confess now!  I'd not think that all was safe      Because my lady's brother stood my friend!      Why, he makes sure of her--\"do you say yes--      She'll not say, no,\"--what comes it to beside?      I should have prayed the brother, \"speak this speech,      For Heaven's sake urge this on her--put in this--      Forget not, as you'd save me, t'other thing,--      Then set down what she says, and how she looks,      And if she smiles, and\" (in an under breath)      \"Only let her accept me, and do you      And all the world refuse me, if you dare!\"       GUENDOLEN.  That way you'd take, friend Austin?  What a shame      I was your cousin, tamely from the first      Your bride, and all this fervour's run to waste!      Do you know you speak sensibly to-day?      The Earl's a fool.       AUSTIN.             Here's Thorold.  Tell him so!       TRESHAM [returning].  Now, voices, voices!  'St! the lady's first!      How seems he?--seems he not... come, faith give fraud      The mercy-stroke whenever they engage!      Down with fraud, up with faith!  How seems the Earl?      A name! a blazon! if you knew their worth,      As you will never! come--the Earl?       GUENDOLEN.                          He's young.       TRESHAM.  What's she? an infant save in heart and brain.      Young!  Mildred is fourteen, remark!  And you...      Austin, how old is she?       GUENDOLEN.               There's tact for you!      I meant that being young was good excuse      If one should tax him...       TRESHAM.                  Well?       GUENDOLEN.                       --With lacking wit.       TRESHAM.  He lacked wit?  Where might he lack wit, so please you?       GUENDOLEN.  In standing straighter than the steward's rod      And making you the tiresomest harangue,      Instead of slipping over to my side      And softly whispering in my ear, \"Sweet lady,      Your cousin there will do me detriment      He little dreams of:  he's absorbed, I see,      In my old name and fame--be sure he'll leave      My Mildred, when his best account of me      Is ended, in full confidence I wear      My grandsire's periwig down either cheek.      I'm lost unless your gentleness vouchsafes\"...       TRESHAM... \"To give a best of best accounts, yourself,      Of me and my demerits.\"  You are right!      He should have said what now I say for him.      Yon golden creature, will you help us all?      Here's Austin means to vouch for much, but you      --You are... what Austin only knows!  Come up,      All three of us:  she's in the library      No doubt, for the day's wearing fast.  Precede!       GUENDOLEN.  Austin, how we must--!       TRESHAM.                            Must what?  Must speak truth,      Malignant tongue!  Detect one fault in him!      I challenge you!       GUENDOLEN.        Witchcraft's a fault in him,      For you're bewitched.       TRESHAM.               What's urgent we obtain      Is, that she soon receive him--say, to-morrow--,      Next day at furthest.       GUENDOLEN.             Ne'er instruct me!       TRESHAM.                                   Come!      --He's out of your good graces, since forsooth,      He stood not as he'd carry us by storm      With his perfections!  You're for the composed      Manly assured becoming confidence!      --Get her to say, \"to-morrow,\" and I'll give you...      I'll give you black Urganda, to be spoiled      With petting and snail-paces.  Will you?  Come!             SCENE III.           --MILDRED'S Chamber.  A Painted Window overlooks the Park            MILDRED and GUENDOLEN       GUENDOLEN.  Now, Mildred, spare those pains.  I have not left      Our talkers in the library, and climbed      The wearisome ascent to this your bower      In company with you,--I have not dared...      Nay, worked such prodigies as sparing you      Lord Mertoun's pedigree before the flood,      Which Thorold seemed in very act to tell      --Or bringing Austin to pluck up that most      Firm-rooted heresy--your suitor's eyes,      He would maintain, were grey instead of blue--      I think I brought him to contrition!--Well,      I have not done such things, (all to deserve      A minute's quiet cousin's talk with you,)      To be dismissed so coolly.

GUENDOLEN.                               There, there!      Do I not comprehend you'd be alone      To throw those testimonies in a heap,      Thorold's enlargings, Austin's brevities,      With that poor silly heartless Guendolen's      Ill-time misplaced attempted smartnesses--      And sift their sense out? now, I come to spare you      Nearly a whole night's labour.  Ask and have!      Demand, he answered!  Lack I ears and eyes?      Am I perplexed which side of the rock-table      The Conqueror dined on when he landed first,      Lord Mertoun's ancestor was bidden take--      The bow-hand or the arrow-hand's great meed?      Mildred, the Earl has soft blue eyes!       MILDRED.                               My brother--      Did he... you said that he received him well?       GUENDOLEN.  If I said only \"well\" I said not much.      Oh, stay--which brother?       MILDRED.                  Thorold! who--Who else?       GUENDOLEN.  Thorold (a secret) is too proud by half,--      Nay, hear me out--with us he's even gentler      Than we are with our birds.  Of this great House      The least retainer that e'er caught his glance      Would die for him, real dying--no mere talk:      And in the world, the court, if men would cite      The perfect spirit of honour, Thorold's name      Rises of its clear nature to their lips.      But he should take men's homage, trust in it,      And care no more about what drew it down.      He has desert, and that, acknowledgment;      Is he content?       MILDRED.        You wrong him, Guendolen.       GUENDOLEN.  He's proud, confess; so proud with brooding o'er      The light of his interminable line,      An ancestry with men all paladins,      And women all...       MILDRED.          Dear Guendolen, 'tis late!      When yonder purple pane the climbing moon      Pierces, I know 'tis midnight.       GUENDOLEN.                      Well, that Thorold      Should rise up from such musings, and receive      One come audaciously to graft himself      Into this peerless stock, yet find no flaw,      No slightest spot in such an one...       MILDRED.                             Who finds      A spot in Mertoun?       GUENDOLEN.          Not your brother; therefore,      Not the whole world.       MILDRED.              I am weary, Guendolen.      Bear with me!       GUENDOLEN.     I am foolish.       MILDRED.                      Oh no, kind!      But I would rest.       GUENDOLEN.         Good night and rest to you!      I said how gracefully his mantle lay      Beneath the rings of his light hair?       MILDRED.                              Brown hair.       GUENDOLEN.  Brown? why, it IS brown:  how could you know that?       MILDRED.  How? did not you--Oh, Austin 'twas, declared      His hair was light, not brown--my head!--and look,      The moon-beam purpling the dark chamber!  Sweet,      Good night!       GUENDOLEN.  Forgive me--sleep the soundlier for me!           [Going, she turns suddenly.]                                                           Mildred!      Perdition! all's discovered!  Thorold finds      --That the Earl's greatest of all grandmothers      Was grander daughter still--to that fair dame      Whose garter slipped down at the famous dance!           [Goes.]       MILDRED.  Is she--can she be really gone at last?      My heart!  I shall not reach the window.  Needs      Must I have sinned much, so to suffer.           [She lifts the small lamp which is suspended before the Virgin's            image in the window, and places it by the purple pane.]                                              There!           [She returns to the seat in front.]      Mildred and Mertoun!  Mildred, with consent      Of all the world and Thorold, Mertoun's bride!      Too late!  'Tis sweet to think of, sweeter still      To hope for, that this blessed end soothes up      The curse of the beginning; but I know      It comes too late:  'twill sweetest be of all      To dream my soul away and die upon.           [A noise without.]      The voice!  Oh why, why glided sin the snake      Into the paradise Heaven meant us both?           [The window opens softly.  A low voice sings.]         There's a woman like a dew-drop, she's so purer than the purest;        And her noble heart's the noblest, yes, and her sure faith's the          surest:        And her eyes are dark and humid, like the depth on depth of lustre        Hid i' the harebell, while her tresses, sunnier than the wild-grape          cluster,        Gush in golden tinted plenty down her neck's rose-misted marble:        Then her voice's music... call it the well's bubbling, the bird's          warble!            [A figure wrapped in a mantle appears at the window.]         And this woman says, \"My days were sunless and my nights were          moonless,        Parched the pleasant April herbage, and the lark's heart's outbreak          tuneless,        If you loved me not!\"  And I who--(ah, for words of flame!) adore          her,        Who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her--            [He enters, approaches her seat, and bends over her.]         I may enter at her portal soon, as now her lattice takes me,        And by noontide as by midnight make her mine, as hers she makes me!            [The EARL throws off his slouched hat and long cloak.]       My very heart sings, so I sing, Beloved!       MILDRED.  Sit, Henry--do not take my hand!       MERTOUN.                                    'Tis mine.      The meeting that appalled us both so much      Is ended.       MILDRED.   What begins now?       MERTOUN.                     Happiness      Such as the world contains not.       MILDRED.                         That is it.      Our happiness would, as you say, exceed      The whole world's best of blisses:  we--do we      Deserve that?  Utter to your soul, what mine      Long since, Beloved, has grown used to hear,      Like a death-knell, so much regarded once,      And so familiar now; this will not be!       MERTOUN.  Oh, Mildred, have I met your brother's face?      Compelled myself--if not to speak untruth,      Yet to disguise, to shun, to put aside      The truth, as--what had e'er prevailed on me      Save you to venture?  Have I gained at last      Your brother, the one scarer of your dreams,      And waking thoughts' sole apprehension too?      Does a new life, like a young sunrise, break      On the strange unrest of our night, confused      With rain and stormy flaw--and will you see      No dripping blossoms, no fire-tinted drops      On each live spray, no vapour steaming up,      And no expressless glory in the East?      When I am by you, to be ever by you,      When I have won you and may worship you,      Oh, Mildred, can you say \"this will not be\"?       MILDRED.  Sin has surprised us, so will punishment.       MERTOUN.  No--me alone, who sinned alone!       MILDRED.                                   The night      You likened our past life to--was it storm      Throughout to you then, Henry?       MERTOUN.                        Of your life      I spoke--what am I, what my life, to waste      A thought about when you are by me?--you      It was, I said my folly called the storm      And pulled the night upon.  'Twas day with me--      Perpetual dawn with me.       MILDRED.                 Come what, come will,      You have been happy:  take my hand!       MERTOUN [after a pause].             How good      Your brother is!  I figured him a cold--      Shall I say, haughty man?       MILDRED.                   They told me all.      I know all.       MERTOUN.     It will soon be over.       MILDRED.                            Over?      Oh, what is over? what must I live through      And say, \"'tis over\"?  Is our meeting over?      Have I received in presence of them all      The partner of my guilty love--with brow      Trying to seem a maiden's brow--with lips      Which make believe that when they strive to form      Replies to you and tremble as they strive,      It is the nearest ever they approached      A stranger's... Henry, yours that stranger's... lip--      With cheek that looks a virgin's, and that is...      Ah God, some prodigy of thine will stop      This planned piece of deliberate wickedness      In its birth even! some fierce leprous spot      Will mar the brow's dissimulating!  I      Shall murmur no smooth speeches got by heart,      But, frenzied, pour forth all our woeful story,      The love, the shame, and the despair--with them      Round me aghast as round some cursed fount      That should spirt water, and spouts blood.  I'll not     ...Henry, you do not wish that I should draw      This vengeance down?  I'll not affect a grace      That's gone from me--gone once, and gone for ever!       MERTOUN.  Mildred, my honour is your own.  I'll share      Disgrace I cannot suffer by myself.      A word informs your brother I retract      This morning's offer; time will yet bring forth      Some better way of saving both of us.       MILDRED.  I'll meet their faces, Henry!       MERTOUN.                                 When? to-morrow!      Get done with it!       MILDRED.           Oh, Henry, not to-morrow!      Next day!  I never shall prepare my words      And looks and gestures sooner.--How you must      Despise me!       MERTOUN.     Mildred, break it if you choose,      A heart the love of you uplifted--still      Uplifts, thro' this protracted agony,      To heaven! but Mildred, answer me,--first pace      The chamber with me--once again--now, say      Calmly the part, the... what it is of me      You see contempt (for you did say contempt)      --Contempt for you in!  I would pluck it off      And cast it from me!--but no--no, you'll not      Repeat that?--will you, Mildred, repeat that?       MILDRED.  Dear Henry!       MERTOUN.               I was scarce a boy--e'e"]]]
