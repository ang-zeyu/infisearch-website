Right about then I realized I had a big decision to make. With Billy out of the fight and Fats gone I was the Nineport police force. All I had to do to be clear of this mess was to walk out the door and keep going. I would be safe enough.  Ned buzzed by, picked up two of the thugs, and hauled them off to the cells.  Maybe it was the sight of his blue back or maybe I was tired of running. Either way my mind was made up before I realized it. I carefully took off the Chief's gold badge and put it on in place of my old one.  \"The new Chief of Police of Nineport,\" I said to no one in particular.  \"Yes, sir,\" Ned said as he passed. He put one of the prisoners down long enough to salute, then went on with his work. I returned the salute.  The hospital meat wagon hauled away the dead and wounded. I took an evil pleasure in ignoring the questioning stares of the attendants. After the doc fixed the side of my head, everyone cleared out. Ned mopped up the floor. I ate ten aspirin and waited for the hammering to stop so I could think what to do next.         *       *       *       *       *  When I pulled my thoughts together the answer was obvious. Too obvious. I made as long a job as I could of reloading my gun.  \"Refill your handcuff box, Ned. We are going out.\"  Like a good cop he asked no questions. I locked the outside door when we left and gave him the key.  \"Here. There's a good chance you will be the only one left to use this before the day is over.\"  I stretched the drive over to China Joe's place just as much as I could. Trying to figure if there was another way of doing it. There wasn't. Murder had been done and Joe was the boy I was going to pin it on. So I had to get him.  The best I could do was stop around the corner and give Ned a briefing.  \"This combination bar and dice-room is the sole property of he whom we will still call China Joe until there is time for you to give me a rundown on him. Right now I got enough distractions. What we have to do is go in there, find Joe and bring him to justice. Simple?\"  \"Simple,\" Ned answered in his sharp Joe-college voice. \"But wouldn't it be simpler to make the arrest now, when he is leaving in that car, instead of waiting until he returns?\"  The car in mention was doing sixty as it came out of the alley ahead of us. I only had a glimpse of Joe in the back seat as it tore by us.  \"Stop them!\" I shouted, mostly for my own benefit since I was driving. I tried to shift gears and start the engine at the same time, and succeeded in doing exactly nothing.  So Ned stopped them. It had been phrased as an order. He leaned his head out of the window and I saw at once why most of his equipment was located in his torso. Probably his brain as well. There sure wasn't much room left in his head when that cannon was tucked away in there.  A .75 recoilless. A plate swiveled back right where his nose should have been if he had one, and the big muzzle pointed out. It's a neat idea when you think about it. Right between the eyes for good aiming, up high, always ready.  The BOOM BOOM almost took my head off. Of course Ned was a perfect shot--so would I be with a computer for a brain. He had holed one rear tire with each slug and the car flap-flapped to a stop a little ways down the road. I climbed out slowly while Ned sprinted there in seconds flat. They didn't even try to run this time. What little nerve they had left must have been shattered by the smoking muzzle of that .75 poking out from between Ned's eyes. Robots are neat about things like that so he must have left it sticking out deliberate. Probably had a course in psychology back in robot school.  Three of them in the car, all waving their hands in the air like the last reel of a western. And the rear floor covered with interesting little suitcases.  Everyone came along quietly.  China Joe only snarled while Ned told me that his name really was Stantin and the Elmira hot seat was kept warm all the time in hopes he would be back. I promised Joe-Stantin I would be happy to arrange it that same day. Thereby not worrying about any slip-ups with the local authorities. The rest of the mob would stand trial in Canal City.  It was a very busy day.  Things have quieted down a good deal since then. Billy is out of the hospital and wearing my old sergeant's stripes. Even Fats is back, though he is sober once in a while now and has trouble looking me in the eye. We don't have much to do because in addition to being a quiet town this is now an honest one.  Ned is on foot patrol nights and in charge of the lab and files days. Maybe the Policeman's Benevolent wouldn't like that, but Ned doesn't seem to mind. He touched up all the bullet scratches and keeps his badge polished. I know a robot can't be happy or sad--but Ned _seems_ to be happy.  Sometimes I would swear I can hear him humming to himself. But, of course, that is only the motors and things going around.  When you start thinking about it, I suppose we set some kind of precedent here. What with putting on a robot as a full-fledged police officer. No one ever came around from the factory yet, so I have never found out if we're the first or not.  And I'll tell you something else. I'm not going to stay in this broken-down town forever. I have some letters out now, looking for a new job.  So some people are going to be _very_ surprised when they see who their new Chief of Police is after _I_ leave.

The burned-out cities were still and dead,     the twisted bodies and twisted souls giving him their last salute in     death. And now he was alone, alone surrounded by memories, alone and     waiting ..._     happy  ending   _by MACK REYNOLDS  and FREDRIC BROWN_    Sometimes the queerly shaped Venusian trees seemed to talk  to him, but their voices were soft. They were loyal people.   There were four men in the lifeboat that came down from the space-cruiser. Three of them were still in the uniform of the Galactic Guards.  The fourth sat in the prow of the small craft looking down at their goal, hunched and silent, bundled up in a greatcoat against the coolness of space--a greatcoat which he would never need again after this morning. The brim of his hat was pulled down far over his forehead, and he studied the nearing shore through dark-lensed glasses. Bandages, as though for a broken jaw, covered most of the lower part of his face.  He realized suddenly that the dark glasses, now that they had left the cruiser, were unnecessary. He slipped them off. After the cinematographic grays his eyes had seen through these lenses for so long, the brilliance of the color below him was almost like a blow. He blinked, and looked again.  They were rapidly settling toward a shoreline, a beach. The sand was a dazzling, unbelievable white such as had never been on his home planet. Blue the sky and water, and green the edge of the fantastic jungle. There was a flash of red in the green, as they came still closer, and he realized suddenly that it must be a _marigee_, the semi-intelligent Venusian parrot once so popular as pets throughout the solar system.  Throughout the system blood and steel had fallen from the sky and ravished the planets, but now it fell no more.  And now this. Here in this forgotten portion of an almost completely destroyed world it had not fallen at all.  Only in some place like this, alone, was safety for him. Elsewhere--anywhere--imprisonment or, more likely, death. There was danger, even here. Three of the crew of the space-cruiser knew. Perhaps, someday, one of them would talk. Then they would come for him, even here.  But that was a chance he could not avoid. Nor were the odds bad, for three people out of a whole solar system knew where he was. And those three were loyal fools.  The lifeboat came gently to rest. The hatch swung open and he stepped out and walked a few paces up the beach. He turned and waited while the two spacemen who had guided the craft brought his chest out and carried it across the beach and to the corrugated-tin shack just at the edge of the trees. That shack had once been a space-radar relay station. Now the equipment it had held was long gone, the antenna mast taken down. But the shack still stood. It would be his home for a while. A long while. The two men returned to the lifeboat preparatory to leaving.  And now the captain stood facing him, and the captain's face was a rigid mask. It seemed with an effort that the captain's right arm remained at his side, but that effort had been ordered. No salute.  The captain's voice, too, was rigid with unemotion. \"Number One ...\"  \"Silence!\" And then, less bitterly. \"Come further from the boat before you again let your tongue run loose. Here.\" They had reached the shack.  \"You are right, Number ...\"  \"No. I am no longer Number One. You must continue to think of me as _Mister_ Smith, your cousin, whom you brought here for the reasons you explained to the under-officers, before you surrender your ship. If you _think_ of me so, you will be less likely to slip in your speech.\"  \"There is nothing further I can do--Mister Smith?\"  \"Nothing. Go now.\"  \"And I am ordered to surrender the--\"  \"There are no orders. The war is over, lost. I would suggest thought as to what spaceport you put into. In some you may receive humane treatment. In others--\"  The captain nodded. \"In others, there is great hatred. Yes. That is all?\"  \"That is all. And, Captain, your running of the blockade, your securing of fuel _en route_, have constituted a deed of high valor. All I can give you in reward is my thanks. But now go. Goodbye.\"  \"Not goodbye,\" the captain blurted impulsively, \"but _hasta la vista_, _auf Wiedersehen_, _until the day_ ... you will permit me, for the last time to address you and salute?\"  The man in the greatcoat shrugged. \"As you will.\"  Click of heels and a salute that once greeted the Caesars, and later the pseudo-Aryan of the 20th Century, and, but yesterday, he who was now known as _the last of the dictators_. \"Farewell, Number One!\"  \"Farewell,\" he answered emotionlessly.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Smith, a black dot on the dazzling white sand, watched the lifeboat disappear up into the blue, finally into the haze of the upper atmosphere of Venus. That eternal haze that would always be there to mock his failure and his bitter solitude.  The slow days snarled by, and the sun shone dimly, and the _marigees_ screamed in the early dawn and all day and at sunset, and sometimes there were the six-legged _baroons_, monkey-like in the trees, that gibbered at him. And the rains came and went away again.  At nights there were drums in the distance. Not the martial roll of marching, nor yet a threatening note of savage hate. Just drums, many miles away, throbbing rhythm for native dances or exorcising, perhaps, the forest-night demons. He assumed these Venusians had their superstitions, all other races had. There was no threat, for him, in that throbbing that was like the beating of the jungle's heart.  Mr. Smith knew that, for although his choice of destinations had been a hasty choice, yet there had been time for him to read the available reports. The natives were harmless and friendly. A Terran missionary had lived among them some time ago--before the outbreak of the war. They were a simple, weak race. They seldom went far from their villages; the space-radar operator who had once occupied the shack reported that he had never seen one of them.  So, there would be no difficulty in avoiding the natives, nor danger if he did encounter them.  Nothing to worry about, except the bitterness.  Not the bitterness of regret, but of defeat. Defeat at the hands of the defeated. The damned Martians who came back after he had driven them halfway across their damned arid planet. The Jupiter Satellite Confederation landing endlessly on the home planet, sending their vast armadas of spacecraft daily and nightly to turn his mighty cities into dust. In spite of everything; in spite of his score of ultra-vicious secret weapons and the last desperate efforts of his weakened armies, most of whose men were under twenty or over forty.  The treachery even in his own army, among his own generals and admirals. The turn of Luna, that had been the end.  His people would rise again. But not, now after Armageddon, in his lifetime. Not under him, nor another like him. The last of the dictators.  Hated by a solar system, and hating it.  It would have been intolerable, save that he was alone. He had foreseen that--the need for solitude. Alone, he was still Number One. The presence of others would have forced recognition of his miserably changed status. Alone, his pride was undamaged. His ego was intact.         *       *       *       *       *  The long days, and the _marigees'_ screams, the slithering swish of the surf, the ghost-quiet movements of the _baroons_ in the trees and the raucousness of their shrill voices. Drums.  Those sounds, and those alone. But perhaps silence would have been worse.  For the times of silence were louder. Times he would pace the beach at night and overhead would be the roar of jets and rockets, the ships that had roared over New Albuquerque, his capitol, in those last days before he had fled. The crump of bombs and the screams and the blood, and the flat voices of his folding generals.  Those were the days when the waves of hatred from the conquered peoples beat upon his country as the waves of a stormy sea beat upon crumbling cliffs. Leagues back of the battered lines, you could _feel_ that hate and vengeance as a tangible thing, a thing that thickened the air, that made breathing difficult and talking futile.  And the spacecraft, the jets, the rockets, the damnable rockets, more every day and every night, and ten coming for every one shot down. Rocket ships raining hell from the sky, havoc and chaos and the end of hope.  And then he knew that he had been hearing another sound, hearing it often and long at a time. It was a voice that shouted invective and ranted hatred and glorified the steel might of his planet and the destiny of a man and a people.  It was his own voice, and it beat back the waves from the white shore, it stopped their wet encroachment upon this, his domain. It screamed back at the _baroons_ and they were silent. And at times he laughed, and the _marigees_ laughed. Sometimes, the queerly shaped Venusian trees talked too, but their voices were quieter. The trees were submissive, they were good subjects.  Sometimes, fantastic thoughts went through his head. The race of trees, the pure race of trees that never interbred, that stood firm always. Someday the trees--  But that was just a dream, a fancy. More real were the _marigees_ and the _kifs_. They were the ones who persecuted him. There was the _marigee_ who would shriek \"_All is lost!_\" He had shot at it a hundred times with his needle gun, but always it flew away unharmed. Sometimes it did not even fly away.  \"_All is lost!_\"  At last he wasted no more needle darts. He stalked it to strangle it with his bare hands. That was better. On what might have been the thousandth try, he caught it and killed it, and there was warm blood on his hands and feathers were flying.  That should have ended it, but it didn't. Now there were a dozen _marigees_ that screamed that"]]]
