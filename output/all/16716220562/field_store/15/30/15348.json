The specimens of _L. c. curti_ are all females, which, in the genus _Lepus_, average larger than the males. Comparison of the measurements recorded below with those in the account by Nelson (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:129, 1909) may not reveal the full measure of difference in size between _L. c. curti_ and other subspecies because Nelson (_op. cit._) pooled males and females in obtaining the average measurements that he records. For example, he used three males and two females of _Lepus altamirae_ in obtaining an average (_op. cit._:117). The specimens of _L. c. curti_ here recorded are thought to be of full size inasmuch as the degree of fusion of bones in the skull, and the density of the cranial bones indicate full adulthood for each specimen. Reproductive-wise, there is no question as to adulthood; each of the four females was pregnant. One specimen had two embryos (each 30 millimeters long in crown-rump measurement) and each of the other specimens contained one embryo. These three embryos were 55, 60, and 105 mm. long.  Three of our specimens, including the holotype, were obtained north of the eighth pass and the other specimen, No. 35473, was obtained a few hundred yards south of the pass. Because the part of the barrier beach south of the pass was connected to the mainland, it is likely that the newly named subspecies occurs also on the adjacent mainland; however, we have examined no specimens of _Lepus californicus_ from the opposite mainland except from Matamoros, ninety miles to the north, and from Altamira, approximately one hundred and fifty miles south of our collecting locality. A specimen from Matamoros, Tamaulipas, and several from Brownsville, Texas, in size of auditory bullae, larger overall size and darker color clearly are _L. c. merriami_ and not _L. c. curti_.  The small tympanic bullae of the specimens from Padre Island were commented upon by Nelson (_op. cit._:149) who found smallness of bullae to characterize many of the specimens from the eastern part of the geographic range of _L. c. merriami_. In the northeastern part of the geographic range of _L. c. merriami_, as Nelson pointed out, the small size of the tympanic bullae was one of several evidences of intergradation there with _Lepus californicus melanotis_, the subspecies next adjacent to the north. In the light of present information, it seems that the smallness of the tympanic bullae in the specimens (3) from Padre Island may be an independent development--an adaptation to environmental conditions that reaches its fullest development on the same chain of islands eighty-odd miles southward of Matamoros. The specimens from Padre Island, although possessing small bullae, in other features, for example, larger size of other parts, are _merriami_.  The four specimens of _L. c. curti_ are in worn winter pelage and the new pelage is coming in on the thighs. Most of the specimens (6) of the _L. c. altamirae_ are in the same condition of pelage. In color and color pattern, the two subspecies are, to me, indistinguishable except that the black patch on the nape is less widely and less definitely separated into two parts by a median, longitudinal, band of buffy color.  _Lepus californicus altamirae_ was named by Nelson (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 17:109, May 18, 1904) as a black-tailed jack rabbit, _Lepus merriami altamirae_, but was later transferred by Nelson (N. Amer. Fauna, 29:124, 1909) to the white-sided section of the genus and arranged as a full species, _Lepus altamirae_. In making this transfer, Nelson (_op. cit._:125) wrote that in \"This well marked species ... the lack of a black patch on the posterior half of the ear at the tip and the white flanks (somewhat obscured in some of the original specimens) are strong characters which place it in the _callotis_ group.\" \"Posterior half of ears white without any trace of black at tip\", was the way Nelson (_op. cit._:124) described the ears in _L. altamirae_. My examination of the original series including the type, reveals that the ears do have some black at the tip of the posterior half in three of the specimens, some brown in one other specimen, and only a dusky tinge in two others. In the four specimens of _L. c. curti_ the tip of the ear is faintly brownish in one animal and dusky in three. The extent of the white flanks seems to be identical in the two series. Fortunately they are in the same pelage and same stage of molt on the hind legs. The one difference that I can detect is in the coloration of the nape. In each of the specimens of _L. altamirae_ the coloration is as described by Nelson (_op. cit._:124): \"nape with two lateral black bands extending back from base of ears, and separated by a median band of buffy.\" In _L. c. curti_ the nape is all black in one specimen and the median band of buffy is present in the other three but is narrower and more dusky than in _L. altamirae_. Since the characters (color of tip of ear and extent of white on the flank) relied upon by Nelson for placing _L. altamirae_ in the _callotis_ group are duplicated in the _californicus_ group, in _L. c. curti_, there is reason for questioning whether _altamirae_ is correctly placed, taxonomically, in the _L. callotis_ group.  Cursory examination of skulls of the _callotis_ group and the _californicus_ group indicates that the prepalatal spine (the part of the palate which extends anteriorly toward the vomer) is longer in _L. californicus_ than in _L. callotis_, _L. gaillardi_ and _L. alleni_. In this feature, _L. altamirae_ agrees with _Lepus californicus_ and differs from members of the _Lepus callotis_ group. Furthermore, the newly named _L. c. curti_, in color of ear and color of nape, is intermediate between _L. altamirae_ and _L. c. merriami_. Consequently, _Lepus merriami altamirae_ Nelson, it seems, should stand as _Lepus californicus altamirae_.  Mention should be made here of the view of Shamel (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 55:25-26, May 12, 1942) that the _californicus_ group should be divided into two groups (each group possibly amounting to something more than a species and something less than a subgenus) on the basis of a white rump and complex infolding of the enamel layer of the front of the first upper incisor _versus_ a dark rump and simple infolding of the mentioned layer of enamel. He placed _Lepus californicus merriami_ Mearns, among other subspecies, in a group different from the one in which he placed several other subspecies of _Lepus californicus_.  Specimens (skulls with accompanying skins) of the species _Lepus californicus_ in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States National Museum, representative of a gradual transition from the dark rump and simple fold in the enamel to the white rump and complex fold in the enamel are as follows: _L. c. deserticola_, No. 29733/41808, Paharanagat Valley, Nevada; Nos. 117463 and 156744, Beals Spring, Arizona. _L. c. texianus_, No. 24635/32031, Springerville, Arizona; No. 97453, Roswell, New Mexico; No. 118751, Toyah, Texas; No. 118749, Valentine, Texas; and No. 108700, Terlingua Creek, Texas. In the continuously distributed species _Lepus californicus_, along the northwest to southeast line provided by the localities of occurrence listed immediately above, there is a gradual transition from one kind of fold to the other kind and from one color of rump to the other color. It is clear that Shamel (_op. cit._) was in error in his conclusions; the kinds of black-tailed jack rabbits to which Shamel (_op. cit._) applied the name _Macrotolagus_ should stand as given below.

In each specimen of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29122"],["title","Mammals Obtained (#3)"],["body",". c. curti_ the length of the ear measured      from the notch when the animal was in the flesh was eight      millimeters more than in the dried skin.  The cranial measurements given above are taken, in so far as possible, in the same way that the measurements recorded by Nelson in his North American Fauna (No. 29, 1909) were taken. In that publication he records mostly average measurements but he records also some measurements of individual specimens. Two of these specimens are the holotypes of _Sylvilagus mansuetus_ Nelson and Romerolagus nelsoni Merriam. By attempting to duplicate Nelson's measurements on these specimens, the following opinions were formed.       \"Basilar length\" is basilar length of Hensel and the anterior      point probably was the posterior border of the alveolus of incisor      two. There is some evidence of lack of consistency with respect to      the anterior control point.       \"Length of nasals\" is the overall length, of the two nasal bones,      but in _Romerolagus_ the shorter (right) nasal alone seems to have      been measured.       \"Breadth of rostrum above premolars\" is easily duplicated in      _Lepus_ but in _Sylvilagus_ the control points are difficult to      find. Two other persons and I obtained three different      measurements, all different from Nelson's measurements, and we      thought that Nelson would have obtained different measurements by      measuring the same specimen of _Sylvilagus_ at different times.       \"Depth of rostrum in front of premolars\" seems to have been taken      perpendicular to the inferior longitudinal line of the rostrum,      approximately one-half millimeter anterior to the alveolus of the      anteriormost cheek tooth.       \"Interorbital breadth\" was taken across the supraorbital processes,      at the narrowest place, but _not_ from the notches medial to the      antorbital projections of the supraorbital processes.       \"Parietal breadth\" is the breadth, across the braincase, taken      approximately half way between the squamosal root of the zygoma and      the external auditory meatus, where there is a lateral bulge in the      squamosal bone. On each side of the skull, the calipers rest on the      squamosal bone, not on the parietal bone.       \"Diameter of bullae\" excludes the paroccipital process and was      taken from the anteriormost part of a tympanic bulla,      posterolaterally to the part of that same bulla, that is exposed at      the lateral side of the base of the paroccipital process.  _Specimens examined._--Total, four, all from Tamaulipas, Mexico, as follows: 88 mi. S and 10 mi. W Matamoros, 3; 90 mi. S and 10 mi. W Matamoros, 1.  _Transmitted February 20, 1951._   23-7414"]]]
