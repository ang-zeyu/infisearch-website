The other thing I know is, that you need not think yourself safe out of Captain Beardsley's reach even when he is at sea. As I said before, he has friends ashore to work for him while he is absent.\"  \"What can we do? What do you advise?\" asked his mother, after she had taken time to think the matter over.  \"There is but one thing we can do, and that is to wait as patiently as we can and see what is going to happen next. This last plot is not fully developed yet, and until it is we must not make a move in any direction. I am as impatient as you are, and so I think I will ride out to the field and give the overseer a chance to say a word if he feels in the humor for it.\"  \"Be very cautious, Marcy,\" said Mrs. Gray.  The young pilot replied that sleeping or waking he was always on the alert, and went out to the little log stable, which did duty as a barn, to saddle his horse. A long lane led through the negro quarter to the field in which the hands were putting in the time in clearing out fence corners and burning brush, while waiting for the early crops to get high enough for hoeing. The overseer's mule was hitched to the fence, and the overseer himself sat on a convenient stump, watching the hands at their work, and whittling the little switch that served him for a riding-whip. The man was almost a stranger to Marcy. The latter had seen and spoken to him a few times since his return from Barrington, but of course he did not like him, for he could not forget that his mother was afraid of him, and would be glad to see him leave the place. He liked him still less two minutes later, for, as he drew rein beside the overseer's perch, threw his right leg over the horn of his saddle and nodded to the man, the latter said, first looking around to make sure that none of the blacks were within hearing:  \"I was sorry to see that man ride away from the big house a while ago.\"  \"What man?\" inquired Marcy. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the front of the house was entirely concealed from view, and that the road that ran before it \"was shut out from sight by the trees and the whitewashed negro quarter. It followed then, as a matter of course, that Hanson could not have seen anybody ride away from the house. He was deep enough in the plot to know that if mother and son had not had a visitor, they ought to have had one.  \"I suspicioned it was that shiftless, do-nothing chap, Kelsey,\" replied the overseer. \"Looked sorter like his mu-el.\"  \"Oh, yes; Kelsey has been up to see us,\" answered Marcy. And then he tapped his boot with his whip and waited to see what was coming next. If the overseer wanted to talk, he might talk all he pleased; but Marcy was resolved that he would not help him along. Hanson twisted about on the stump, cleared his throat once or twice, and, seeing that the boy was not disposed to break the silence, said, as if he were almost afraid to broach the subject:  \"Have much of anything to talk about?\"  \"He talked a good deal, but didn't say much.\"  \"Mention my name?\"  \"Yes. He mentioned yours and Shelby's and Dillon's and the postmaster's.\"  \"Say anything bad about us?\" continued the overseer, after waiting in vain for the boy to go on and repeat the conversation he had held with Kelsey.  \"Not so very bad,\" answered Marcy, looking up and down the long fence to see how the work was progressing.  \"Looka-here, Mister Marcy,\" said Hanson desperately. \"Kelsey told you I was Union, didn't he? Come now, be honest.\"  \"If by being honest you mean being truthful, I want to tell you that I am never any other way,\" said the boy emphatically. \"What object could I have in denying it? I don't care a cent what your politics are so long as you mind your own business, and don't try to cram your ideas down my throat. But I'll not allow myself to be led into a discussion. Kelsey did say that you are Union; and if you are, I don't see why you stay in this country. You can't get out any too quick.\"  \"Are you going to discharge me?\"  \"No, I am not; and I sent word to Shelby and the rest that if they want you run off the place, they can come up here and do it. I shall have no hand in it.\"  Marcy could read the overseer's face a great deal better than the overseer could read Marcy's; and it would have been clear to a third party that Hanson was disappointed, and that there was something he wanted to say and was afraid to speak about. That was the money that was supposed to be concealed in the house.  \"Was that all Kelsey said to you?\" he asked, at length.  \"Oh, no. He rattled on about various things--spoke of the ease with which the _Osprey_ captured that Yankee schooner, and let fall a word or two about the battle in Charleston harbor.\"  \"Is _that_ all he said to you?\"  \"I believe he said something about being a good Confederate, and I asked him why he didn't prove it by shouldering a musket. I don't go about boasting of the great things I would do if I were only there. There's no need of it, for I have been there.\" [\"But it was because I couldn't help myself,\" he added mentally.]  \"But folks say you're Union, all the same,\" said Hanson.  \"What folks? Are they soldiers?\"  \"No. Citizens.\"  \"Then I don't care that what they say,\" replied Marcy, snapping his fingers in the air. \"When they put uniforms on and show by their actions that they mean business, I will talk to them, and not before.\"  Marcy waited patiently for the overseer to say \"money,\" and the latter waited impatiently for Marcy to say it; and when at last the boy made up his mind that he had heard all he cared to hear from Hanson, he brought his leg down from the horn of his saddle, placed his foot in the stirrup, and gathered up the reins as if he were about to ride away.  \"Kelsey didn't say nothing to get you and your maw down on me, did he?\" inquired Hanson, when he observed these movements.  \"I shouldn't like for to lose my place just because I am strong for the Union and dead against secession.\"  \"If you lose your place on that account, it'll be because Colonel Shelby and his friends will have it so,\" answered Marcy. \"You are hired to do an overseer's work; and as long as you attend to that and nothing else you will have no trouble with me. You may depend upon that.\"  \"But before you go I'd like to know, pine-plank, whether you are friendly to me or not,\" continued Hanson, who was obliged to confess to himself that he had not learned the first thing, during the interview, that could be used against Marcy or his mother.  \"I am a friend to you in this way,\" was the answer. \"If I found you out there in the woods cold and hungry, and hiding from soldiers who were trying to make a prisoner of you, I would feed and warm you; and I wouldn't care whether you had a gray jacket or a blue coat on.\"  \"He's a trifle the cutest chap I've run across in many a long day,\" muttered the overseer, as Marcy turned his filly about and rode away. \"I couldn't make him tell whether he was Union or secesh, although I give him all the chance in the world, and he didn't say \"money\" a single time. Now, what's to be done? If the money is there and Beardsley is bound to have it, he'd best be doing something before that sailor gets back, for they say he's lightning and will fight at the drop of the hat. I reckon I'd better make some excuse to ride over town so't I can see Colonel Shelby.\"  \"I think I have laid that little scheme most effectually,\" was what Marcy Gray said to himself as he rode away from the stump on which the overseer was sitting. \"They haven't got a thing out of me, and I have left the matter in their own hands. If there is anything done toward getting Hanson away from this country (and I wish to goodness there might be), Shelby and his hypocritical gang can have the fun of doing it, and shoulder all the responsibility afterward.\"  But what was the object of the plot? That was what \"banged\" Marcy, and he told his mother so after he had given her a minute description of his brief interview with the overseer. Was it possible that there were some strong Union men in the neighborhood, and that Beardsley hoped Marcy would incur their enmity by discharging Hanson on account of his alleged principles? Marcy knew better than to believe that, and so did his mother.  \"I'll tell you what I think to be the most reasonable view of the case,\" said the boy, after taking a few turns across the floor and spending some minutes in a brown study. \"Beardsley knows there is no man in the family; that we'd be only too glad to have somebody to go to for advice; and he hoped we would take that ignorant Hanson for a counselor, if he could make us believe that he was really Union. But Hanson didn't fool me, for he didn't go at it in the right way. He's secesh all over. The next thing on the program will be something else.\"  \"I trust it will not be a midnight visit from a mob,\" said his mother, who trembled at the bare thought of such a thing.  \"So do I; but if they come, we'll see what they will make by it. They might burn the house without finding anything to reward them for their trouble.\"  \"Oh, Marcy. You surely don't think they would do anything so barbarous.\"  \"They might. Think of what that Committee of Safety did at Barrington.\"  \"But what would we do?\"  \"Live in the quarter, as Elder Bowen and the other Union men in Barrington did after their houses were destroyed. And if they burned the servants' homes as well as our own, We'd throw up a shelter of some sort in the woods. I don't reckon that Julius and I have forgotten how to handle axes and build log cabins. The practice we have had in building turkey traps would stand---- Say,\" whispered Marcy suddenly, at the same time putting his arm around his mother's neck and speaking the words close to her ear, \"if a mob should come here to-night and go over the house, we'd be ruined. There are those Union flags, you know.\"  \"I never once thought of them,\" was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29387"],["title","Marcy the Blockade Runner (#5)"],["body","frightened answer. \"Suppose I had had a mob for visitors while you were at sea? Our home would be in ashes now. Those flags are dangerous things, and must be disposed of without loss of time. I am sorry you brought them home with you. Don't you think you had better destroy them while you have them in mind?\"  \"Of course I will do it if you say so, and think it will make you feel any safer; but I was intending--you see----\"  His countenance fell, and his mother was quick to notice it. \"What did you intend to do with them?\" she asked.  \"One of them used to float over the academy,\" replied Marcy. \"Dick Graham, a Missouri boy, than whom a better fellow never lived, stole it out of the colonel's room one night because he did not want to see it insulted and destroyed, as it would have been if Rodney and his friends could have got their hands upon it. He gave it to me because he knew it would some day be something to feel proud over, and said he hoped to hear that it had been run up again.\"  \"But, Marcy, you dare not hoist it here,\" exclaimed Mrs. Gray.  \"Not now; but there may come a time when I shall dare do it. The other flag--well, the other was made by a Union girl in Barrington, who had to work on it by stealth, because her sister, and every other member of her family except her father, were the worst kind of secesh. Rodney thought sure he was going to put the Stars and Bars on the tower when the Union colors were stolen, but our fellows got mine up first, and would have kept it there if they had had to fight to do it. But I'll put them in the stove if you think best.\"  \"You need not do anything of the kind,\" said Mrs. Gray, whose patriotism had been awakened by the simple narrative. \"I shall not permit a party of beardless boys to show more loyalty than I am willing to show myself.\"  \"Bully for you, mother!\" cried Marcy. \"We'll see both of them in the air before many months more have passed over our heads. Now, think of some good hiding place for them, and I'll put them there right away. Not in the ground, you know, for if the Union troops should ever come marching through here, we should want to get them out in a hurry.\"  \"How would it do to sew them up in a bed-quilt?\" said Mrs. Gray, suggesting the first \"good hiding place\" that came into her mind.  \"That's the very spot,\" replied Marcy. \"Put them in one of mine, and then I shall have the old flag over me every night.\"  No time was lost in carrying out this decision, and in a few minutes mother and son were locked in the boy's room, and busy stitching the precious pieces of bunting into one of the quilts. It never occurred to them to ask what they would do or how they would feel if some half-clad, shivering rebel should find his way into the room and walk off with that quilt without so much as saying \"by your leave.\" Probably they never dreamed that the soldiers of the Confederacy would be reduced to such straits.                                   CHAPTER III.                        BEARDSLEY BETRAYS HIMSELF.  Never before had the hours hung as heavily upon Marcy Gray's hands as they did at the period of which we write. There was literally nothing he could do--at least that he _wanted_ to do. He did not care to read anything except the newspapers, and they came only once a day; he had never learned how to lounge around and let the hours drag themselves away; he very soon grew weary of sailing about the sound in the _Fairy Belle_ with the boy Julius for a companion; and so he spent a little of his time in visiting among the neighboring planters, and a good deal more in \"pottering\" among his mother's flower beds. Visiting was the hardest work he had ever done; but he knew he couldn't shirk it without exciting talk, and there was talk enough about him in the settlement already.  To a stranger it would have looked as though he had nothing to complain of. He was cordially received wherever he went, often heard himself spoken of as \"one of our brave boys\" (although what he had done that was so very brave Marcy himself could not understand), and visitors at Mrs. Gray's house were as numerous as they ever had been; but Marcy and his mother were people who could not be easily deceived by such a show of friendship. Some of it, as they afterward learned, was genuine; while the rest was assumed for the purpose of leading them on to \"declare\" themselves. It was a mean thing for neighbors to be guilty of, but you must remember that, like Rodney Gray when he wrote that mischievous letter to Bud Goble, they did not know all the time what they were doing. Of course the high-spirited Marcy grew restive under such treatment; and when, after long waiting, the postmaster handed him a letter from Captain Beardsley, ordering him to report on board the _Osprey_ without loss of time, he did not feel as badly over it as he once thought he should. On the contrary, he appeared to be very jubilant when he showed the letter to Allison and half a score of other young rebels who were always to be found loafing around the post-office at mail time.  \"I'm off to sea again,\" said he. \"Now the Yankees had better look out.\"  \"It must be an enjoyable life, Marcy,\" replied Allison. \"You see any amount of fun and excitement, draw big prize-money in addition to your regular wages, and, better than all, you run no sort of risk. It may surprise you to know that I have been turning the matter over in my mind a good deal of late, and have come to the conclusion that I should enjoy being one of a privateer's crew. What do you think about it?\"  \"I am not acquainted with a single fellow who would enjoy it more,\" answered Marcy, who told himself that Allison was just coward enough to engage in some such disreputable business. \"You are just the lad for it. It is such fun to bring a swift vessel to and haul down the old flag in the face of men who are powerless to defend it.\"  Sharp as Marcy Gray was, his strong love for the Union and his intense hatred for the business in which he was perforce engaged, sometimes led him to come dangerously near to betraying himself. Allison looked sharply at him, but there was nothing in Marcy's face to indicate that he did not mean every word he said.  \"I am heartily glad I am going to sea again,\" continued the latter; and he told nothing but the truth. The companionship of the ignorant foreigners who composed the _Osprey's_ crew was more to his liking than daily intercourse with pretended friends who were constantly watching for a chance to get him into trouble.  \"Do you think I could get on with Captain Beardsley?\" inquired Allison.  \"You might. The crew was full when I left the schooner, but I will speak to the captain, if you would like to have me.\"  \"I really wish you would, for I am anxious to do something for the glorious cause of Southern independence. When do you sail?\"  \"I don't know. About all the captain says in his letter is that he wants me to report immediately.\"  \"Does he say whether or not the _Hollins_ has been sold yet?\"  \"Oh, yes; he speaks of that, and congratulates me on the fact that I have eight hundred and seventy-live dollars more to my credit on the schooner's books than I did when I left her at Newbern.\"  \"W-h-e-w!\" whistled Allison. \"How long did it take you to make the capture?\"  \"Four or five hours, I should say.\"  \"Eight hundred and seventy-five dollars for four or five hours' work! Marcy, you have struck a gold mine. You will be as rich as Julius Caesar in less than a year.\"  \"How long do you suppose Uncle Sam will allow such--such work to be kept up?\" exclaimed Marcy.  \"Oh, no doubt he would be glad to stop it now if he could; but when he tries it, he will find that he's got the hardest job on his hands he ever undertook. There never was a better place for carrying on such business than the waters of North Carolina. Our little inlets are too shallow to float a heavy man-of-war.\"  \"No matter how big the job may be, you will find that these small-fry privateers\" (it was right on the end of Marcy's tongue to say \"pirates\") \"will be swept from the face of the earth in less than a year; so that I shall have no chance to get rich. But I'll have to be going, for I must start for Newbern this very night. I suppose you will all be in the army by the time I get back, so good-by.\"  Allison and his friends shook hands with him, wished him another successful voyage, and Marcy mounted and rode away, his filly never breaking her lope until she turned through the gate into the yard, and drew up before the steps that led to the porch. His mother met him at the door and knew as soon as she looked at him that he had news for her.  \"Yes, I've got orders from Beardsley,\" said the boy, without waiting to be questioned. \"And if Jack were only here, and I was about to engage in some honorable business, I should be glad to go. Mother, on the day we captured the _Hollins_ we robbed somebody of fifty-six thousand dollars.\"  \"Oh, Marcy, is it not dreadful!\" said Mrs. Gray.  \"It is, for a fact. We're having a bully time now, but the day will come when we'll have to settle with the fiddler. You will see. Yes, the vessel and her cargo sold for fifty-six thousand dollars. Half of it went to the government, and half of the remainder was divided among the three officers, Beardsley getting the lion's share, I bet you. The sixteen members of the crew get an equal share of the other fourteen thousand, the difference in rank between the petty officers and foremast hands being so slight that Beardsley did not think it worth while to give one more than another; but he hints that he has got something laid by for me.\"  \"My son, it will burn your fingers,\" said Mrs. Gray.  \"I can't help it if it does. I'll have to take all he offers me, but, of course, I don't expect to keep it. Now, mother, please help me get off. The longer I fool around home the harder it will be to make a start.\"  Marcy wanted to caution his mother to look out for Hanson while he was gone; but he did not"]]]
