On this view, as we shall more plainly see in the {17} next chapter when discussing latent tendencies, we should have to look at the whole case as one of reversion to an enormously remote, lowly-organised, and multidigitate progenitor.         *       *       *       *       *  I may here allude to a class of facts closely allied to, but somewhat different from, ordinary cases of inheritance. Sir H. Holland[40] states that brothers and sisters of the same family are frequently affected, often at about the same age, by the same peculiar disease, not known to have previously occurred in the family. He specifies the occurrence of diabetes in three brothers under ten years old; he also remarks that children of the same family often exhibit in common infantile diseases the same peculiar symptoms. My father mentioned to me the case of four brothers who died between the ages of sixty and seventy, in the same highly peculiar comatose state. An instance has been already given of supernumerary digits appearing in four children out of six in a previously unaffected family. Dr. Devay states[41] that two brothers married two sisters, their first-cousins, none of the four nor any relation being an albino; but the seven children produced from this double marriage were all perfect albinoes. Some of these cases, as Mr. Sedgwick[42] has shown, are probably the result of reversion to a remote ancestor, of whom no record had been preserved; and all these cases are so far directly connected with inheritance that no doubt the children inherited a similar constitution from their parents, and, from being exposed to nearly similar conditions of life, it is not surprising that they should be affected in the same manner and at the same period of life.         *       *       *       *       *  Most of the facts hitherto given have served to illustrate the force of inheritance, but we must now consider cases, grouped as well as the subject allows into classes, showing how feeble, capricious, or deficient the power of inheritance sometimes is. When a new peculiarity first appears, we can never predict whether it will be inherited. If both parents from their birth present {18} the same peculiarity, the probability is strong that it will be transmitted to at least some of their offspring. We have seen that variegation is transmitted much more feebly by seed from a branch which had become variegated through bud-variation, than from plants which were variegated as seedlings. With most plants the power of transmission notoriously depends on some innate capacity in the individual: thus Vilmorin[43] raised from a peculiarly coloured balsam some seedlings, which all resembled their parent; but of these seedlings some failed to transmit the new character, whilst others transmitted it to all their descendants during several successive generations. So again with a variety of the rose, two plants alone out of six were found by Vilmorin to be capable of transmitting the desired character.      The weeping or pendulous growth of trees is strongly inherited in some     cases, and, without any assignable reason, feebly in other cases. I     have selected this character as an instance of capricious inheritance,     because it is certainly not proper to the parent-species, and because,     both sexes being borne on the same tree, both tend to transmit the same     character. Even supposing that there may have been in some instances     crossing with adjoining trees of the same species, it is not probable     that all the seedlings would have been thus affected. At Moccas Court     there is a famous weeping oak; many of its branches \"are 30 feet long,     and no thicker in any part of this length than a common rope:\" this     tree transmits its weeping character, in a greater or less degree, to     all its seedlings; some of the young oaks being so flexible that they     have to be supported by props; others not showing the weeping tendency     till about twenty years old.[44] Mr. Rivers fertilized, as he informs     me, the flowers of a new Belgian weeping thorn (_Crat√¶gus oxyacantha_)     with pollen from a crimson not-weeping variety, and three young trees,     \"now six or seven years old, show a decided tendency to be pendulous,     but as yet are not so much so as the mother-plant.\" According to Mr.     MacNab,[45] seedlings from a magnificent weeping birch (_Betula alba_),     in the Botanic Garden at Edinburgh, grew for the first ten or fifteen     years upright, but then all became weepers like their parent. A peach     with pendulous branches, like those of the weeping willow, has been     found capable of propagation by seed.[46] Lastly, a weeping and almost     prostrate yew (_Taxus baccata_) was found in a hedge in Shropshire; it     was a male, but one branch bore female flowers, and produced berries;     these, {19} being sown, produced seventeen trees, all of which had     exactly the same peculiar habit with the parent-tree.[47]      These facts, it might have been thought, would have been sufficient to     render it probable that a pendulous habit would in all cases be     strictly inherited. But let us look to the other side. Mr. MacNab[48]     sowed seeds of the weeping beech (_Fagus sylvanica_), but succeeded in     raising only common beeches. Mr. Rivers, at my request, raised a number     of seedlings from three distinct varieties of weeping elm; and at least     one of the parent-trees was so situated that it could not have been     crossed by any other elm; but none of the young trees, now about a foot     or two in height, show the least signs of weeping. Mr. Rivers formerly     sowed above twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash (_Fraxinus     excelsior_), and not a single seedling was in the least degree     pendulous: in Germany, M. Borchmeyer raised a thousand seedlings, with     the same result. Nevertheless, Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea Botanic     Garden, by sowing seed from a weeping ash, which was found before the     year 1780, in Cambridgeshire, raised several pendulous trees.[49]     Professor Henslow also informs me that some seedlings from a female     weeping ash in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge were at first a little     pendulous, but afterwards became quite upright: it is probable that     this latter tree, which transmits to a certain extent its pendulous     habit, was derived by a bud from the same original Cambridgeshire     stock; whilst other weeping ashes may have had a distinct origin. But     the crowning case, communicated to me by Mr. Rivers, which shows how     capricious is the inheritance of a pendulous habit, is that a variety     of another species of ash (_F. lentiscifolia_) which was formerly     pendulous, \"now about twenty years old has long lost this habit, every     shoot being remarkably erect; but seedlings formerly raised from it     were perfectly prostrate, the stems not rising more than two inches     above the ground.\" Thus the weeping variety of the common ash, which     has been extensively propagated by buds during a long period, did not,     with Mr. Rivers, transmit its character to one seedling out of above     twenty thousand; whereas the weeping variety of a second species of     ash, which could not, whilst grown in the same garden, retain its own     weeping character, transmitted to its seedlings the pendulous habit in     excess!      Many analogous facts could be given, showing how apparently capricious     is the principle of inheritance. All the seedlings from a variety of     the Barberry (_B. vulgaris_) with red leaves inherited the same     character; only about one-third of the seedlings of the copper Beech     (_Fagus sylvatica_) had purple leaves. Not one out of a hundred     seedlings of a variety of the _Cerasus padus_, with yellow fruit, bore     yellow fruit: one-twelfth of the seedlings of the variety of _Cornus     mascula_, with yellow fruit, came true:[50] and lastly, all the trees     raised by my father from a yellow-berried holly (_Ilex aquifolium_),     {20} found wild, produced yellow berries. Vilmorin[51] observed in a     bed of _Saponaria calabrica_ an extremely dwarf variety, and raised     from it a large number of seedlings; some of these partially resembled     their parent, and he selected their seed; but the grandchildren were     not in the least dwarfed: on the other hand, he observed a stunted and     bushy variety of _Tagetes signata_ growing in the midst of the common     varieties by which it was probably crossed; for most of the seedlings     raised from this plant were intermediate in character, only two     perfectly resembling their parent; but seed saved from these two plants     reproduced the new variety so truly, that hardly any selection has     since been necessary.      Flowers transmit their colour truly, or most capriciously. Many annuals     come true: thus I purchased German seeds of thirty-four named     sub-varieties of one _race_ of ten-week stocks (_Matthiola annua_), and     raised a hundred and forty plants, all of which, with the exception of     a single plant, came true. In saying this, however, it must be     understood that I could distinguish only twenty kinds out of the     thirty-four named sub-varieties; nor did the colour of the flower     always correspond with the name affixed to the packet; but I say that     they came true, because in each of the thirty-six short rows every     plant was absolutely alike, with the one single exception. Again, I     procured packets of German seed of twenty-five named varieties of     common and quilled asters, and raised a hundred and twenty-four plants;     of these, all except ten were true in the above limited sense; and I     considered even a wrong shade of colour as false.      It is a singular circumstance that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28897"],["title","The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication, Volume II (of 2) (#6)"],["body","varieties generally transmit     their colour much more truly than any other variety. This fact probably     stands in close relation with one observed by Verlot,[52] namely, that     flowers which are normally white rarely vary into any other colour. I     have found that the white varieties of _Delphinium consolida_ and of     the Stock are the truest. It is, indeed, sufficient to look through a     nurseryman's seed-list, to see the large number of white varieties     which can be propagated by seed. The several coloured varieties of the     sweet-pea (_Lathyrus odoratus_) are very true; but I hear from Mr.     Masters, of Canterbury, who has particularly attended to this plant,     that the white variety is the truest. The hyacinth, when propagated by     seed, is extremely inconstant in colour, but \"white hyacinths almost     always give by seed white-flowered plants;\"[53] and Mr. Masters informs     me that the yellow varieties also reproduce their colour, but of     different shades. On the other hand, pink and blue varieties, the     latter being the natural colour, are not nearly so true: hence, as Mr.     Masters has remarked to me, \"we see that a garden variety may acquire a     more permanent habit than a natural species;\" but it should have been     added, that this occurs under cultivation, and therefore under changed     conditions.      With many flowers, especially perennials, nothing can be more     fluctuating than the colour of the seedlings, as is notoriously the     case with verbenas, carnations, dahlias, cinerarias, and others.[54] I     sowed seed of twelve {21} named varieties of Snapdragon (_Antirrhinum     majus_), and utter confusion was the result. In most cases the     extremely fluctuating colour of seedling plants is probably in chief     part due to crosses between differently-coloured varieties during     previous generations. It is almost certain that this is the case with     the polyanthus and coloured primrose (_Primula veris_ and _vulgaris_),     from their reciprocally dimorphic structure;[55] and these are plants     which florists speak of as never come true by seed: but if care be     taken to prevent crossing, neither species is by any means very     inconstant in colour; thus I raised twenty-three plants from a purple     primrose, fertilised by Mr. J. Scott with its own pollen, and eighteen     came up purple of different shades, and only five reverted to the     ordinary yellow colour: again, I raised twenty plants from a bright-red     cowslip, similarly treated by Mr. Scott, and every one perfectly     resembled its parent in colour, as likewise did, with the exception of     a single plant, 73 grandchildren. Even with the most variable flowers,     it is probable that each delicate shade of colour might be permanently     fixed so as to be transmitted by seed, by cultivation in the same soil,     by long-continued selection, and especially by the prevention of     crosses. I infer this from certain annual larkspurs (_Delphinium     consolida_ and _ajacis_), of which common seedlings present a greater     diversity of colour than any other plant known to me; yet on procuring     seed of five named German varieties of _D. consolida_, only nine plants     out of ninety-four were false; and the seedlings of six varieties of     _D. ajacis_ were true in the same manner and degree as with the stocks     above described. A distinguished botanist maintains that the annual     species of Delphinium are always self-fertilised; therefore I may     mention that thirty-two flowers on a branch of _D. consolida_, enclosed     in a net, yielded twenty-seven capsules, with an average of 17.2 seed     in each; whilst five flowers, under the same net, which were     artificially fertilised, in the same manner as must be effected by bees     during their incessant visits, yielded five capsules with an average of     35.2 fine seed; and this shows that the agency of insects is necessary     for the full fertility of this plant. Analogous facts could be given     with respect to the crossing of many other flowers, such as carnations,     &c., of which the varieties fluctuate much in colour.      As with flowers, so with our domesticated animals, no character is more     variable than colour, and probably in no animal more so than with the     horse. Yet with a little care in breeding, it appears that races of any     colour might soon be formed. Hofacker gives the result of matching two     hundred and sixteen mares of four different colours with like-coloured     stallions, without regard to the colour of their ancestors; and of the     two hundred and sixteen colts born, eleven alone failed to inherit the     colour of their parents: Autenrieth and Ammon assert that, after two     generations, colts of a uniform colour are produced with certainty.[56]  In a few rare cases peculiarities fail to be inherited, apparently from the force of inheritance being too strong. I have been assured by breeders of the canary-bird that to get a good {22} jonquil-coloured bird it does not answer to pair two jonquils, as the colour then comes out too strong, or is even brown. So again, if two crested canaries are paired, the young birds rarely inherit this character:[57] for in crested birds a narrow space of bare skin is left on the back of the head, where the feathers are up-turned to form the crest, and, when both parents are thus characterised, the bareness becomes excessive, and the crest itself fails to be developed. Mr. Hewitt, speaking of Laced Sebright Bantams, says[58] that, \"why this should be so, I know not, but I am confident that those that are best laced frequently produce offspring very far from perfect in their markings, whilst those exhibited by myself, which have so often proved successful, were bred from the union of heavily-laced birds with those that were scarcely sufficiently laced.\"  It is a singular fact that, although several deaf-mutes often occur in the same family, and though their cousins and other relations are often in the same condition, yet their parents are very rarely deaf-mutes. To give a single instance: not one scholar out of 148, who were at the same time in the London Institution, was the child of parents similarly afflicted. So again, when a male or a female deaf-mute marries a sound person, their children are most rarely affected: in Ireland out of 203 children thus produced one alone was mute. Even when both parents have been deaf-mutes, as in the case of forty-one marriages in the United States and of six in Ireland, only two deaf and dumb children were produced. Mr. Sedgwick,[59] in commenting on this remarkable and fortunate failure in the power of transmission in the direct line, remarks that it may possibly be owing to \"excess having reversed the action of some natural law in development.\" But it is safer in the present state of our knowledge to look at the whole case as simply unintelligible.         *       *       *       *       *  With respect to the inheritance of structures mutilated by injuries or altered by disease it is difficult to come to any {23} definite conclusion. In some cases mutilations have been practised for a vast number of generations without any inherited result. Godron has remarked[60] that different races of man have from time immemorial knocked out their upper incisors, cut off joints of their fingers, made holes of immense size through the lobes of their ears or through their nostrils, made deep gashes in various parts of their bodies, and there is no reason whatever to suppose that these mutilations have ever been inherited. Adhesions due to inflammation and pits from the small-pox (and formerly many consecutive generations must have been thus pitted) are not inherited. With respect to Jews, I have been assured by three medical men of the Jewish faith that circumcision, which has been practised for so many ages, has produced no inherited effect; Blumenbach, on the other hand, asserts[61] that in Germany Jews are often born in a condition rendering circumcision difficult, so that a name is here applied to them signifying \"born circumcised.\" The oak and other trees must have borne galls from primeval times, yet they do not produce inherited excrescences; many other such facts could be adduced.  On the other hand, various cases have been recorded of cats, dogs, and horses, which have had their tails, legs, &c., amputated or injured, producing offspring with the same parts ill-formed; but as it is not at all rare for similar malformations to appear spontaneously, all such cases may be due to mere coincidence. Nevertheless, Dr. Prosper Lucas has given, on good authorities, such a long list of inherited injuries, that it is difficult not to believe in them. Thus, a cow that had lost a horn from an accident with consequent suppuration, produced three calves which were hornless on the same side of the head. With the horse, there seems hardly a doubt that bony exostoses on the legs, caused by too much travelling on hard roads, are inherited. Blumenbach records the case of a man who had his little finger on the right hand almost cut off, and which in consequence grew crooked, and his sons had the same finger on the same hand similarly crooked. A soldier, fifteen years before his marriage, lost his left eye from purulent ophthalmia, and his {24} two sons were microphthalmic on the same side.[62] In all such cases, if truthfully reported, in which the parent has had an organ injured on one side, and more than one child has been born with the same organ affected on the same side, the chances against mere coincidence are enormous. But perhaps the most remarkable and trustworthy fact is that given by Dr. Brown-S√©quard,[63] namely, that many young guinea-pigs inherited an epileptic tendency from parents which had been subjected to a particular operation, inducing in the course of a few weeks a convulsive disease like epilepsy: and"]]]
