It was one of them, one of the ruined race, the race that had perished.  For a long time they stared at the picture. At last Dorle replaced the board.  \"All these other crates,\" Nasha said. \"More pictures. And these drums. What are in the boxes?\"  \"This is their treasure,\" Tance said, almost to himself. \"Here are their pictures, their records. Probably all their literature is here, their stories, their myths, their ideas about the universe.\"  \"And their history,\" Nasha said. \"We'll be able to trace their development and find out what it was that made them become what they were.\"  Dorle was wandering around the vault. \"Odd,\" he murmured. \"Even at the end, even after they had begun to fight they still knew, someplace down inside them, that their real treasure was this, their books and pictures, their myths. Even after their big cities and buildings and industries were destroyed they probably hoped to come back and find this. After everything else was gone.\"  \"When we get back home we can agitate for a mission to come here,\" Tance said. \"All this can be loaded up and taken back. We'll be leaving about--\"  He stopped.  \"Yes,\" Dorle said dryly. \"We'll be leaving about three day-periods from now. We'll fix the ship, then take off. Soon we'll be home, that is, if nothing happens. Like being shot down by that--\"  \"Oh, stop it!\" Nasha said impatiently. \"Leave him alone. He's right: all this must be taken back home, sooner or later. We'll have to solve the problem of the gun. We have no choice.\"  Dorle nodded. \"What's your solution, then? As soon as we leave the ground we'll be shot down.\" His face twisted bitterly. \"They've guarded their treasure too well. Instead of being preserved it will lie here until it rots. It serves them right.\"  \"How?\"  \"Don't you see? This was the only way they knew, building a gun and setting it up to shoot anything that came along. They were so certain that everything was hostile, the enemy, coming to take their possessions away from them. Well, they can keep them.\"  Nasha was deep in thought, her mind far away. Suddenly she gasped. \"Dorle,\" she said. \"What's the matter with us? We have no problem. The gun is no menace at all.\"  The two men stared at her.  \"No menace?\" Dorle said. \"It's already shot us down once. And as soon as we take off again--\"  \"Don't you see?\" Nasha began to laugh. \"The poor foolish gun, it's completely harmless. Even I could deal with it alone.\"  \"You?\"  Her eyes were flashing. \"With a crowbar. With a hammer or a stick of wood. Let's go back to the ship and load up. Of course we're at its mercy in the air: that's the way it was made. It can fire into the sky, shoot down anything that flies. But that's all! Against something on the ground it has no defenses. Isn't that right?\"  Dorle nodded slowly. \"The soft underbelly of the dragon. In the legend, the dragon's armor doesn't cover its stomach.\" He began to laugh. \"That's right. That's perfectly right.\"  \"Let's go, then,\" Nasha said. \"Let's get back to the ship. We have work to do here.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was early the next morning when they reached the ship. During the night the Captain had died, and the crew had ignited his body, according to custom. They had stood solemnly around it until the last ember died. As they were going back to their work the woman and the two men appeared, dirty and tired, still excited.  And presently, from the ship, a line of people came, each carrying something in his hands. The line marched across the gray slag, the eternal expanse of fused metal. When they reached the weapon they all fell on the gun at once, with crowbars, hammers, anything that was heavy and hard.  The telescopic sights shattered into bits. The wiring was pulled out, torn to shreds. The delicate gears were smashed, dented.  Finally the warheads themselves were carried off and the firing pins removed.  The gun was smashed, the great weapon destroyed. The people went down into the vault and examined the treasure. With its metal-armored guardian dead there was no danger any longer. They studied the pictures, the films, the crates of books, the jeweled crowns, the cups, the statues.  At last, as the sun was dipping into the gray mists that drifted across the planet they came back up the stairs again. For a moment they stood around the wrecked gun looking at the unmoving outline of it.  Then they started back to the ship. There was still much work to be done. The ship had been badly hurt, much had been damaged and lost. The important thing was to repair it as quickly as possible, to get it into the air.  With all of them working together it took just five more days to make it spaceworthy.         *       *       *       *       *  Nasha stood in the control room, watching the planet fall away behind them. She folded her arms, sitting down on the edge of the table.  \"What are you thinking?\" Dorle said.  \"I? Nothing.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"I was thinking that there must have been a time when this planet was quite different, when there was life on it.\"  \"I suppose there was. It's unfortunate that no ships from our system came this far, but then we had no reason to suspect intelligent life until we saw the fission glow in the sky.\"  \"And then it was too late.\"  \"Not quite too late. After all, their possessions, their music, books, their pictures, all of that will survive. We'll take them home and study them, and they'll change us. We won't be the same afterwards. Their sculpturing, especially. Did you see the one of the great winged creature, without a head or arms? Broken off, I suppose. But those wings-- It looked very old. It will change us a great deal.\"  \"When we come back we won't find the gun waiting for us,\" Nasha said. \"Next time it won't be there to shoot us down. We can land and take the treasure, as you call it.\" She smiled up at Dorle. \"You'll lead us back there, as a good captain should.\"  \"Captain?\" Dorle grinned. \"Then you've decided.\"  Nasha shrugged. \"Fomar argues with me too much. I think, all in all, I really prefer you.\"  \"Then let's go,\" Dorle said. \"Let's go back home.\"  The ship roared up, flying over the ruins of the city. It turned in a huge arc and then shot off beyond the horizon, heading into outer space.         *       *       *       *       *  Down below, in the center of the ruined city, a single half-broken detector vane moved slightly, catching the roar of the ship. The base of the great gun throbbed painfully, straining to turn. After a moment a red warning light flashed on down inside its destroyed works.  And a long way off, a hundred miles from the city, another warning light flashed on, far underground. Automatic relays flew into action. Gears turned, belts whined. On the ground above a section of metal slag slipped back. A ramp appeared.  A moment later a small cart rushed to the surface.  The cart turned toward the city. A second cart appeared behind it. It was loaded with wiring cables. Behind it a third cart came, loaded with telescopic tube sights. And behind came more carts, some with relays, some with firing controls, some with tools and parts, screws and bolts, pins and nuts. The final one contained atomic warheads.  The carts lined up behind the first one, the lead cart. The lead cart started off, across the frozen ground, bumping calmly along, followed by the others. Moving toward the city.  To the damaged gun.     Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from _Planet Stories_ September 1952.

With the Night Mail   At nine o'clock of a gusty winter night I stood on the lower stages of one of the G. P. O. outward mail towers. My purpose was a run to Quebec in \"Postal Packet 162 or such other as may be appointed\"; and the Postmaster-General himself countersigned the order. This talisman opened all doors, even those in the despatching-caisson at the foot of the tower, where they were delivering the sorted Continental mail. The bags lay packed close as herrings in the long gray under-bodies which our G. P. O. still calls \"coaches.\" Five such coaches were filled as I watched, and were shot up the guides to be locked on to their waiting packets three hundred feet nearer the stars.  From the despatching-caisson I was conducted by a courteous and wonderfully learned official--Mr. L. L. Geary, Second Despatcher of the Western Route--to the Captains' Room (this wakes an echo of old romance), where the mail captains come on for their turn of duty. He introduces me to the Captain of \"162\"--Captain Purnall, and his relief, Captain Hodgson. The one is small and dark; the other large and red; but each has the brooding sheathed glance characteristic of eagles and aëronauts. You can see it in the pictures of our racing professionals, from L. V. Rautsch to little Ada Warrleigh--that fathomless abstraction of eyes habitually turned through naked space.  On the notice-board in the Captains' Room, the pulsing arrows of some twenty indicators register, degree by geographical degree, the progress of as many homeward-bound packets. The word \"Cape\" rises across the face of a dial; a gong strikes: the South African mid-weekly mail is in at the Highgate Receiving Towers. That is all. It reminds one comically of the traitorous little bell which in pigeon-fanciers' lofts notifies the return of a homer.  \"Time for us to be on the move,\" says Captain Purnall, and we are shot up by the passenger-lift to the top of the despatch-towers. \"Our coach will lock on when it is filled and the clerks are aboard.\"...  \"No. 162\" waits for us in Slip E of the topmost stage. The great curve of her back shines frostily under the lights, and some minute alteration of trim makes her rock a little in her holding-down slips.  Captain Purnall frowns and dives inside. Hissing softly, \"162\" comes to rest as level as a rule. From her North Atlantic Winter nose-cap (worn bright as diamond with boring through uncounted leagues of hail, snow, and ice) to the inset of her three built-out propeller-shafts is some two hundred and forty feet. Her extreme diameter, carried well forward, is thirty-seven. Contrast this with the nine hundred by ninety-five of any crack liner and you will realize the power that must drive a hull through all weathers at more than the emergency-speed of the \"Cyclonic\"!  The eye detects no joint in her skin plating save the sweeping hair-crack of the bow-rudder--Magniac's rudder that assured us the dominion of the unstable air and left its inventor penniless and half-blind. It is calculated to Castelli's \"gull-wing\" curve. Raise a few feet of that all but invisible plate three-eighths of an inch and she will yaw five miles to port or starboard ere she is under control again. Give her full helm and she returns on her track like a whip-lash. Cant the whole forward--a touch on the wheel will suffice--and she sweeps at your good direction up or down. Open the complete circle and she presents to the air a mushroom-head that will bring her up all standing within a half mile.  \"Yes,\" says Captain Hodgson, answering my thought, \"Castelli thought he'd discovered the secret of controlling aëroplanes when he'd only found out how to steer dirigible balloons. Magniac invented his rudder to help war-boats ram each other; and war went out of fashion and Magniac he went out of his mind because he said he couldn't serve his country any more. I wonder if any of us ever know what we're really doing.\"  \"If you want to see the coach locked you'd better go aboard. It's due now,\" says Mr. Geary. I enter through the door amidships. There is nothing here for display. The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and yachts disguise their tanks with decoration, but the G. P. O. serves them raw under a lick of gray official paint. The inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy themselves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the waybill over the hatch-coaming. Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. \"Pleasant run,\" says Mr. Geary, and disappears through the door which a foot-high pneumatic compressor locks after him.  \"A-ah!\" sighs the compressor released. Our holding-down clips part with a tang. We are clear.  Captain Hodgson opens the great colloid underbody-porthole through which I watch million-lighted London slide eastward as the gale gets hold of us. The first of the low winter clouds cuts off the well-known view and darkens Middlesex. On the south edge of it I can see a postal packet's light ploughing through the white fleece. For an instant she gleams like a star ere she drops toward the Highgate Receiving Towers. \"The Bombay Mail,\" says Captain Hodgson, and looks at his watch. \"She's forty minutes late.\"  \"What's our level?\" I ask.  \"Four thousand. Aren't you coming up on the bridge?\"  The bridge (let us ever bless the G. P. O. as a repository of ancientest tradition!) is represented by a view of Captain Hodgson's legs where he stands on the control platform that runs thwartships overhead. The bow colloid is unshuttered and Captain Purnall, one hand on the wheel, is feeling for a fair slant. The dial shows 4,300 feet.  \"It's steep to-night,\" he mutters, as tier on tier of cloud drops under. \"We generally pick up an easterly draught below three thousand at this time o' the year. I hate slathering through fluff.\"  \"So does Van Cutsem. Look at him huntin' for a slant!\" says Captain Hodgson. A fog-light breaks cloud a hundred fathoms below. The Antwerp Night Mail makes her signal and rises between two racing clouds far to port, her flanks blood-red in the glare of Sheerness Double Light. The gale will have us over the North Sea in half an hour, but Captain Purnall lets her go composedly--nosing to every point of the compass as she rises.  \"Five thousand--six, six thousand eight hundred\"--the dip-dial reads ere we find the easterly drift, heralded by a flurry of snow at the thousand-fathom level. Captain Purnall rings up the engines and keys down the governor on the switch before him. There is no sense in urging machinery when Æolus himself gives you good knots for nothing. We are away in earnest now--our nose notched home on our chosen star. At this level the lower clouds are laid out all neatly combed by the dry fingers of the East. Below that again is the strong westerly blow through which we rose. Overhead, a film of southerly drifting mist draws "]]]
