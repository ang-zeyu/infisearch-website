The _kifs_, the Venusian equivalent of the Terran ant, stole his food. But that did not matter; there was plenty of food. There had been a cache of it in the shack, meant to restock a space-cruiser, and never used. The _kifs_ would not get at it until he opened a can, but then, unless he ate it all at once, they ate whatever he left. That did not matter. There were plenty of cans. And always fresh fruit from the jungle. Always in season, for there were no seasons here, except the rains.  But the _kifs_ served a purpose for him. They kept him sane, by giving him something tangible, something inferior, to hate.  Oh, it wasn't hatred, at first. Mere annoyance. He killed them in a routine sort of way at first. But they kept coming back. Always there were _kifs_. In his larder, wherever he did it. In his bed. He sat the legs of the cot in dishes of gasoline, but the _kifs_ still got in. Perhaps they dropped from the ceiling, although he never caught them doing it.  They bothered his sleep. He'd feel them running over him, even when he'd spent an hour picking the bed clean of them by the light of the carbide lantern. They scurried with tickling little feet and he could not sleep.  He grew to hate them, and the very misery of his nights made his days more tolerable by giving them an increasing purpose. A pogrom against the _kifs_. He sought out their holes by patiently following one bearing a bit of food, and he poured gasoline into the hole and the earth around it, taking satisfaction in the thought of the writhings in agony below. He went about hunting _kifs_, to step on them. To stamp them out. He must have killed millions of _kifs_.  But always there were as many left. Never did their number seem to diminish in the slightest. Like the Martians--but unlike the Martians, they did not fight back.  Theirs was the passive resistance of a vast productivity that bred _kifs_ ceaselessly, overwhelmingly, billions to replace millions. Individual _kifs_ could be killed, and he took savage satisfaction in their killing, but he knew his methods were useless save for the pleasure and the purpose they gave him. Sometimes the pleasure would pall in the shadow of its futility, and he would dream of mechanized means of killing them.  He read carefully what little material there was in his tiny library about the _kif_. They were astonishingly like the ants of Terra. So much that there had been speculation about their relationship--that didn't interest him. How could they be killed, _en masse_? Once a year, for a brief period, they took on the characteristics of the army ants of Terra. They came from their holes in endless numbers and swept everything before them in their devouring march. He wet his lips when he read that. Perhaps the opportunity would come then to destroy, to destroy, _and destroy_.  Almost, Mr. Smith forgot people and the solar system and what had been. Here in this new world, there was only he and the _kifs_. The _baroons_ and the _marigees_ didn't count. They had no order and no system. The _kifs_--  In the intensity of his hatred there slowly filtered through a grudging admiration. The _kifs_ were true totalitarians. They practiced what he had preached to a mightier race, practiced it with a thoroughness beyond the kind of man to comprehend.  Theirs the complete submergence of the individual to the state, theirs the complete ruthlessness of the true conqueror, the perfect selfless bravery of the true soldier.  But they got into his bed, into his clothes, into his food.  They crawled with intolerable tickling feet.  Nights he walked the beach, and that night was one of the noisy nights. There were high-flying, high-whining jet-craft up there in the moonlight sky and their shadows dappled the black water of the sea. The planes, the rockets, the jet-craft, they were what had ravaged his cities, had turned his railroads into twisted steel, had dropped their H-Bombs on his most vital factories.  He shook his fist at them and shrieked imprecations at the sky.  And when he had ceased shouting, there were voices on the beach. Conrad's voice in his ear, as it had sounded that day when Conrad had walked into the palace, white-faced, and forgotten the salute. \"There is a breakthrough at Denver, Number One! Toronto and Monterey are in danger. And in the other hemispheres--\" His voice cracked. \"--the damned Martians and the traitors from Luna are driving over the Argentine. Others have landed near New Petrograd. It is a rout. All is lost!\"  Voices crying, \"Number One, _hail_! Number One, _hail_!\"  A sea of hysterical voices. \"Number One, _hail_! Number One--\"  A voice that was louder, higher, more frenetic than any of the others. His memory of his own voice, calculated but inspired, as he'd heard it on play-backs of his own speeches.  The voices of children chanting, \"To thee, O Number One--\" He couldn't remember the rest of the words, but they had been beautiful words. That had been at the public school meet in the New Los Angeles. How strange that he should remember, here and now, the very tone of his voice and inflection, the shining wonder in their children's eyes. Children only, but they were willing to kill and die, _for him_, convinced that all that was needed to cure the ills of the race was a suitable leader to follow.  \"_All is lost!_\"  And suddenly the monster jet-craft were swooping downward and starkly he realized what a clear target he presented, here against the white moonlit beach. They must see him.  The crescendo of motors as he ran, sobbing now in fear, for the cover of the jungle. Into the screening shadow of the giant trees, and the sheltering blackness.  He stumbled and fell, was up and running again. And now his eyes could see in the dimmer moonlight that filtered through the branches overhead. Stirrings there, in the branches. Stirrings and voices in the night. Voices in and of the night. Whispers and shrieks of pain. Yes, he'd shown them pain, and now their tortured voices ran with him through the knee-deep, night-wet grass among the trees.  The night was hideous with noise. Red noises, an almost _tangible_ din that he could nearly _feel_ as well as he could see and hear it. And after a while his breath came raspingly, and there was a thumping sound that was the beating of his heart and the beating of the night.  And then, he could run no longer, and he clutched a tree to keep from falling, his arms trembling about it, and his face pressed against the impersonal roughness of the bark. There was no wind, but the tree swayed back and forth and his body with it.  Then, as abruptly as light goes on when a switch is thrown, the noise vanished. Utter silence, and at last he was strong enough to let go his grip on the tree and stand erect again, to look about to get his bearings.  One tree was like another, and for a moment he thought he'd have to stay here until daylight. Then he remembered that the sound of the surf would give him his directions. He listened hard and heard it, faint and far away.  And another sound--one that he had never heard before--faint, also, but seeming to come from his right and quite near.  He looked that way, and there was a patch of opening in the trees above. The grass was waving strangely in that area of moonlight. It moved, although there was no breeze to move it. And there was an almost sudden _edge_, beyond which the blades thinned out quickly to barrenness.  And the sound--it was like the sound of the surf, but it was continuous. It was more like the rustle of dry leaves, but there were no dry leaves to rustle.  Mr. Smith took a step toward the sound and looked down. More grass bent, and fell, and vanished, even as he looked. Beyond the moving edge of devastation was a brown floor of the moving bodies of _kifs_.  Row after row, orderly rank after orderly rank, marching resistlessly onward. Billions of _kifs_, an army of _kifs_, eating their way across the night.  Fascinated, he stared down at them. There was no danger, for their progress was slow. He retreated a step to keep beyond their front rank. The sound, then, was the sound of chewing.  He could see one edge of the column, and it was a neat, orderly edge. And there was discipline, for the ones on the outside were larger than those in the center.  He retreated another step--and then, quite suddenly, his body was afire in several spreading places. The vanguard. Ahead of the rank that ate away the grass.  His boots were brown with _kifs_.  Screaming with pain, he whirled about and ran, beating with his hands at the burning spots on his body. He ran head-on into a tree, bruising his face horribly, and the night was scarlet with pain and shooting fire.  But he staggered on, almost blindly, running, writhing, tearing off his clothes as he ran.  This, then, was _pain_. There was a shrill screaming in his ears that must have been the sound of his own voice.  When he could no longer run, he crawled. Naked, now, and with only a few _kifs_ still clinging to him. And the blind tangent of his flight had taken him well out of the path of the advancing army.  But stark fear and the memory of unendurable pain drove him on. His knees raw now, he could no longer crawl. But he got himself erect again on trembling legs, and staggered on. Catching hold of a tree and pushing himself away from it to catch the next.  Falling, rising, falling again. His throat raw from the screaming invective of his hate. Bushes and the rough bark of trees tore his flesh.         *       *       *       *       *  Into the village compound just before dawn, staggered a man, a naked terrestrial. He looked about with dull eyes that seemed to see nothing and understand nothing.  The females and young ran before him, even the males retreated.  He stood there, swaying, and the incredulous eyes of the natives widened as they saw the condition of his body, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29206"],["title","Happy Ending (#2)"],["body","the blankness of his eyes.  When he made no hostile move, they came closer again, formed a wondering, chattering circle about him, these Venusian humanoids. Some ran to bring the chief and the chief's son, who knew everything.  The mad, naked human opened his lips as though he were going to speak, but instead, he fell. He fell, as a dead man falls. But when they turned him over in the dust, they saw that his chest still rose and fell in labored breathing.  And then came Alwa, the aged chieftain, and Nrana, his son. Alwa gave quick, excited orders. Two of the men carried Mr. Smith into the chief's hut, and the wives of the chief and the chief's son took over the Earthling's care, and rubbed him with a soothing and healing salve.  But for days and nights he lay without moving and without speaking or opening his eyes, and they did not know whether he would live or die.  Then, at last, he opened his eyes. And he talked, although they could make out nothing of the things he said.  Nrana came and listened, for Nrana of all of them spoke and understood best the Earthling's language, for he had been the special protege of the Terran missionary who had lived with them for a while.  Nrana listened, but he shook his head. \"The words,\" he said, \"the words are of the Terran tongue, but I make nothing of them. His mind is not well.\"  The aged Alwa said, \"Aie. Stay beside him. Perhaps as his body heals, his words will be beautiful words as were the words of the Father-of-Us who, in the Terran tongue, taught us of the gods and their good.\"  So they cared for him well, and his wounds healed, and the day came when he opened his eyes and saw the handsome blue-complexioned face of Nrana sitting there beside him, and Nrana said softly, \"Good day, Mr. Man of Earth. You feel better, no?\"  There was no answer, and the deep-sunken eyes of the man on the sleeping mat stared, glared at him. Nrana could see that those eyes were not yet sane, but he saw, too, that the madness in them was not the same that it had been. Nrana did not know the words for delirium and paranoia, but he could distinguish between them.  No longer was the Earthling a raving maniac, and Nrana made a very common error, an error more civilized beings than he have often made. He thought the paranoia was an improvement over the wider madness. He talked on, hoping the Earthling would talk too, and he did not recognize the danger of his silence.  \"We welcome you, Earthling,\" he said, \"and hope that you will live among us, as did the Father-of-Us, Mr. Gerhardt. He taught us to worship the true gods of the high heavens. Jehovah, and Jesus and their prophets the men from the skies. He taught us to pray and to love our enemies.\"  And Nrana shook his head sadly, \"But many of our tribe have gone back to the older gods, the cruel gods. They say there has been great strife among the outsiders, and no more remain upon all of Venus. My father, Alwa, and I are glad another one has come. You will be able to help those of us who have gone back. You can teach us love and kindliness.\"  The eyes of the dictator closed. Nrana did not know whether or not he slept, but Nrana stood up quietly to leave the hut. In the doorway, he turned and said, \"We pray for you.\"  And then, joyously, he ran out of the village to seek the others, who were gathering bela-berries for the feast of the fourth event.  When, with several of them, he returned to the village, the Earthling was gone. The hut was empty.  Outside the compound they found, at last, the trail of his passing. They followed and it led to a stream and along the stream until they came to the tabu of the green pool, and could go no farther.  \"He went downstream,\" said Alwa gravely. \"He sought the sea and the beach. He was well then, in his mind, for he knew that all streams go to the sea.\"  \"Perhaps he had a ship-of-the-sky there at the beach,\" Nrana said worriedly. \"All Earthlings come from the sky. The Father-of-Us told us that.\"  \"Perhaps he will come back to us,\" said Alwa. His old eyes misted.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Smith was coming back all right, and sooner than they had dared to hope. As soon in fact, as he could make the trip to the shack and return. He came back dressed in clothing very different from the garb the other white man had worn. Shining leather boots and the uniform of the Galactic Guard, and a wide leather belt with a holster for his needle gun.  But the gun was in his hand when, at dusk, he strode into the compound.  He said, \"I am Number One, the Lord of all the Solar System, and your ruler. Who was chief among you?\"  Alwa had been in his hut, but he heard the words and came out. He understood the words, but not their meaning. He said, \"Earthling, we welcome you back. I am the chief.\"  \"You were the chief. Now you will serve me. I am the chief.\"  Alwa's old eyes were bewildered at the strangeness of this. He said, \"I will serve you, yes. All of us. But it is not fitting that an Earthling should be chief among--\"  The whisper of the needle gun. Alwa's wrinkled hands went to his scrawny neck where, just off the center, was a sudden tiny pin prick of a hole. A faint trickle of red coursed over the dark blue of his skin. The old man's knees gave way under him as the rage of the poisoned needle dart struck him, and he fell. Others started toward him.  \"Back,\" said Mr. Smith. \"Let him die slowly that you may all see what happens to--\"  But one of the chief's wives, one who did not understand the speech of Earth, was already lifting Alwa's head. The needle gun whispered again, and she fell forward across him.  \"I am Number One,\" said Mr. Smith, \"and Lord of all the planets. All who oppose me, die by--\"  And then, suddenly all of them were running toward him. His finger pressed the trigger and four of them died before the avalanche of their bodies bore him down and overwhelmed him. Nrana had been first in that rush, and Nrana died.  The others tied the Earthling up and threw him into one of the huts. And then, while the women began wailing for the dead, the men made council.  They elected Kallana chief and he stood before them and said, \"The Father-of-Us, the Mister Gerhardt, deceived us.\" There was fear and worry in his voice and apprehension on his blue face. \"If this be indeed the Lord of whom he told us--\"  \"He is not a god,\" said another. \"He is an Earthling, but there have been such before on Venus, many many of them who came long and long ago from the skies. Now they are all dead, killed in strife among themselves. It is well. This last one is one of them, but he is mad.\"  And they talked long and the dusk grew into night while they talked of what they must do. The gleam of firelight upon their bodies, and the waiting drummer.  The problem was difficult. To harm one who was mad was tabu. If he was really a god, it would be worse. Thunder and lightning from the sky would destroy the village. Yet they dared not release him. Even if they took the evil weapon-that-whispered-its-death and buried it, he might find other ways to harm them. He might have another where he had gone for the first.  Yes, it was a difficult problem for them, but the eldest and wisest of them, one M'Ganne, gave them at last the answer.  \"O Kallana,\" he said, \"Let us give him to the _kifs_. If _they_ harm him--\" and old M'Ganne grinned a toothless, mirthless grin \"--it would be their doing and not ours.\"  Kallana shuddered. \"It is the most horrible of all deaths. And if he is a god--\"  \"If he is a god, they will not harm him. If he is mad and not a god, we will not have harmed him. It harms not a man to tie him to a tree.\"  Kallana considered well, for the safety of his people was at stake. Considering, he remembered how Alwa and Nrana had died.  He said, \"It is right.\"  The waiting drummer began the rhythm of the council-end, and those of the men who were young and fleet lighted torches in the fire and went out into the forest to seek the _kifs_, who were still in their season of marching.  And after a while, having found what they sought, they returned.  They took the Earthling out with them, then, and tied him to a tree. They left him there, and they left the gag over his lips because they did not wish to hear his screams when the _kifs_ came.  The cloth of the gag would be eaten, too, but by that time, there would be no flesh under it from which a scream might come.  They left him, and went back to the compound, and the drums took up the rhythm of propitiation to the gods for what they had done. For they had, they knew, cut very close to the corner of a tabu--but the provocation had been great and they hoped they would not be punished.  All night the drums would throb.         *       *       *       *       *  The man tied to the tree struggled with his bonds, but they were strong and his writhings made the knots but tighten.  His eyes became accustomed to the darkness.  He tried to shout, \"I am Number One, Lord of--\"  And then, because he could not shout and because he could not loosen himself, there came a rift in his madness. He remembered who he was, and all the old hatreds and bitterness welled up in him.  He remembered, too, what had happened in the compound, and wondered why the Venusian natives had not killed him. Why, instead, they had tied him here alone in the darkness of the jungle.  Afar, he heard the throbbing of the drums, and they were like the beating of the heart of night, and there was a louder, nearer sound that was the pulse of blood in his ears as the fear came to him.  The fear that he knew why they had tied him here. The horrible, gibbering fear that, for the last time, an army marched against him.  He had time to savor that fear to the uttermost, to have it become a creeping certainty that crawled into the black corners of his soul as would the soldiers of the coming army crawl into his ears and nostrils while others would eat away his eyelids to get at the eyes behind them.  And then, and"]]]
