WHO        can read the book of the past? Who can tell us the story of       Creation’s morn? It is, not written in history, neither does it       live in tradition. There is mystery here; but it is hid by the       darkness of bygone ages. There is a true history here, but we       have not learned well the alphabet used. Here are doubtless       wondrous scenes; but our stand-point is removed by time so vast,       the mist of years is so thick before us, that only the ruder       outlines can be determined. The delicate tracery, the body of the       picture, are hidden from our eye. The question as to the       antiquity and primitive history of man, is full of interest in       proportion as the solution is beset with difficulties. We       question the past; but only here and there a response is heard.       Surely bold is he who would attempt, from the few data at hand,       to reconstruct the history of times and people so far removed. We       quickly become convinced that many centuries, and tens of       centuries, have rolled away since man’s first appearance on the       earth. We become impressed with the fact, “that multitudes of       people have moved over the surface of the Earth, and sunk into       the night of oblivion, without leaving a trace of their       existence: without a memorial through which we might have at       least learned their names.”[1]        To think of ourselves, is to imagine for our own nation an       immortality. We are so great, so strong, surely nothing can move       us. Let us learn humility from the past: and when, here and       there, we come upon some reminder of a vanished people, trace the       proofs of a teeming population in ancient times, and recover       somewhat of a history, as true and touching as any that poets       sing, let us recognize the fact, that nations as well as       individuals pass away and are forgotten.        The past guards its secret well. To learn of it we must seek new       methods of inquiry. Discouraged by the difficulties in the way,       many have supposed it hidden from the present by a veil which       only thickens as time passes. In the remains of prehistoric times       they have failed to recognize the pages of history. They saw only       monuments of ancient skill and perseverance: interesting       sketches, not historical portraits. Some writers have held that       we must give up the story of the past, “whether fact or       chronology, doctrine or mythology—whether in Europe, Asia,       Africa, or America—at Thebes, or Palenque—on Lycian shore, or       Salisbury plain—lost is lost and gone is gone for evermore.” Such       is the lament of a gifted writer,[2] amongst the first to ponder       over the mysteries of the past. At the present day, with better       means at hand, a more hopeful view is taken. But here a caution       is necessary; for, in attempting to reconstruct the history of       primitive times, such is the interest which it inspires, that       many allow imagination to usurp the place of research, and write       in terms too glowing for history.[3]        The human mind is sleepless in the pursuit of knowledge. It is       ever seeking new fields of conquest. It must advance: with it,       standing still is the precursor of defeat. If necessary it       invents new methods of attack, and rests not until it gains its       objective point, or demonstrates the hopelessness of its quest.       The world needs but be informed that on a given point knowledge       is dim and uncertain, when there are found earnest minds applying       to the solution of the mystery all the energies of their natures.       All the resources of science are brought to bear; every       department of knowledge is made to contribute of its store: and       soon a mass of facts is established and a new science is added to       the department of human knowledge.        Thus, with our knowledge of prehistoric times, what so seemingly       vain as to attempt to roll back the flight of time, and learn the       condition of primeval man? All the light of ancient history makes       but little impression on the night of time. By its aid we can but       dimly see the outlines of the fortieth century back; beyond is       gloom soon lost in night. But a few short years ago, men did not       think it possible to gain further information. With the materials       at hand this could not be done. The triumph of the intellect was       simply delayed, not hopelessly repulsed. Geology was but just       beginning to make good its claim to a place among the sciences.       This unfolded to man the physical history of the world as read       from the rocks, and deals with times so vast and profound that we       speak no longer of years, but of ages. And with the aid of       Geology grand secrets were wrung from the past, and new light was       thrown on the manners and customs of primitive man. Thus the       foundation for still another science was laid, called Archæology,       or the science of Human Antiquities. These two sister sciences       are the keys by whose aid we have not only acquired much       information of a past that seemed a hopeless enigma—but, as       Columbus on the waste of waters could perceive traces of land as       yet invisible, so can the present seekers after knowledge trace       the signs of a satisfactory solution of many of the great       questions relating to the origin and history of the vanished       races of mankind.        In whatever land we commence our investigations, we quickly come       upon the evidences of an ancient life long antedating all       historical information. Ancient Egypt has been a fruitful theme       for the antiquarians pen. The traveler has moralized over the       ruins of her past greatness, and many pointed illustrations of       national growth and decay have been drawn from her history.        Here was the seat of an ancient civilization, which was in the       zenith of its power many centuries before Christ. The changes       that have passed over the earth since that time are far more       wonderful than any ascribed to the wand of the magician. Nations       have come and gone, and the land of the Pharaohs has become an       inheritance for strangers; new sciences have enriched human life,       and the fair structure of modern civilization has arisen on the       ruins of the past. Many centuries, with their burden of human       hopes and fears, have sped away into the past, since       “Hundred-gated Thebes” sheltered her teeming population, where       now are but a mournful group of ruins. Yet to-day, far below the       remorseless sands of her desert, we find the rude flint-flakes       that require us to carry back the time of man’s first appearance       in Egypt to a past so remote that her stately ruins become a       thing of yesterday in comparison to them.        In the New World, mysterious mounds and gigantic earth-works       arrest our attention. Here we find deserted mines, and there we       can trace the sites of ancient camps and fortifications. The       Indians of the prairies seem to be intruders on a fairer       civilization. We find here evidences of a teeming population. In       the presence of their imposing ruins, we can not think that       nomadic savages built them. They give evidences rather of a       people having fixed habitations and seem to imply the possession       of a higher civilization than that of the Indians. These       questions demand solution; but how shall we solve the problem?       Save here and there a deserted camp, or a burial mound,       containing perhaps articles of use or adornment, all traces have       vanished. Their earth-works and mounds are being rapidly leveled       by the plow of modern times, and the scholar of the future can       only learn from books of their mysterious builders.        In Mexico, and farther south, we find the ruins of great cities.       To the student of antiquity, these far surpass in interest the       ruined cities of the Nile or Euphrates valley. Babylon of old,       with its walls, towers, and pleasure resorts, was indeed       wonderful. In our own land cities, if not as ancient, yet fallen       in more picturesque ruin, reward the labors of the explorer.       Uxmal, Copan, and Palenque, invite our attention. Here are       hieroglyphics in abundance, but no Rosetta Stone supplies the key       by whose aid a Champollion can unravel the mystery.        The luxuriant vegetative growth of the tropics, with its fierce       storms, is every year hastening the obliteration of these ruins,       and we must improve the time well, if we would learn from them     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2873"],["title","The Prehistoric World; Or, Vanished Races (#4)"],["body","  what they have to say of the past.        The isles of the Pacific give evidence that, long before the dawn       of authentic history, man lived there. Indeed, as the islands       which gem that ocean, from their configuration and position, seem       to be but the elevated plateaus and mountain peaks of a continent       that has gone down beneath the blue wave of the Pacific, so,       throughout Polynesia can be traced the fragmentary remains of a       civilization, the greater portion of which has been completely       buried by the waters of oblivion, leaving only here and there a       trace to reconstruct, if we can, the entire structure.        The earliest remains of man are very similar in all lands. They       consist of weapons of war and of the chase, implements of       domestic use, and articles of personal adornment. Few and simple       as they are, they are capable of imparting useful information as       to early times. By their aid we become eye-witnesses of the daily       life of primitive man. We learn that though lacking in almost       every thing we consider essential for comfort and happiness, yet       they were actuated by much the same hopes and fears as the men of       the present age. The great burden of life was the same then as       now. There was the same round of daily labor made necessary by       the same ceaseless struggle for existence. Rude forts and warlike       implements show there was the same encroachment of the strong on       the weak as now.        This is a wonderful age in many respects. In none, however, more       wonderful than in the wide-spread diffusion of knowledge. The       ordinary people now understand more of nature’s secrets than the       wise men of old. They are to-day interested in researches that a       former generation would have relegated to the scholar and the man       of leisure. No department of knowledge is retained for the       researches of a favored few. The farmer, the mechanic, and the       man of business are alike interested in a knowledge of       prehistoric times. The rude implements of the past appeal to the       curiosity of all. We arise from a study of the past with clearer       ideas of man’s destiny. Impressed with the great advancement in       man’s condition from the rude savagery of the drift, to the       enlightened civilization of to-day, what may we not hope the       advancement will be during the countless ages we believe a       beneficent Providence has in store for his creature, man?        A history of the popular opinion of the antiquity of man is not       only of interest, but should teach a lesson to all who think       others are wrong because not holding the same views as they do.       Hardly fifty years have passed since scientific men began to       attribute to the human race an antiquity more remote than that       assigned them by history and tradition. At first these views met       with general opposition, much as did the theory of the present       system of astronomy when it was first proclaimed. We laugh now at       the ignorant fear’s and prejudices used to combat both.        It was claimed that the Bible taught that man had lived on the       globe scarcely six thousand years. The Bible is the book to which       the Anglo-Saxon mind clings with the greatest reverence. The       memories of childhood are associated with its pages, and its very       appearance recalls the prayers of long ago. It is not strange       then that the Christian world guards with jealous care against       any thing which may be thought to weaken the force of its       statements.        But it is human nature to go to extremes: and, when we give our       support to one way of thinking, we find it difficult to be       patient with those of the contrary opinion.        Now, the researches of some of the most eminent men and learned       divines have amply shown, that there are no data given in the       Scriptures on which to base an estimate as to the antiquity of       man. Happily the Christian mind no longer shrinks from the       conclusions reached by the scientist: and, indeed, it is the       contemplation of the stupendous periods of Geological times, and       the infinite greatness of the works of Creation as disclosed by       Astronomy, with the extreme lowness of man’s first condition as       made evident by Archæology, that lend new force to the words,       “What is man, that thou art mindful of him!”        The evidences on which we predicate an extreme antiquity for man       are necessarily cumulative. It is not from one source alone that       we obtain information, but from many. Eminent men in nearly every       department of knowledge have lent their aid to the elucidation of       this subject. It can only be understood by those who will fairly       weigh the facts that modern discoveries have unrolled before       their eyes. There are many who have not done this, and are       consequently unable to project their mental vision so far back       into the very night of time, as is now demanded for the beginning       of man’s first appearance on the earth. And, indeed, so       enormously has this period been extended—so far back does it       require us to go—that even the most enlightened investigator may       well recoil in dismay when he first perceives the almost infinite       lapse of years that are required by his calculation since the       creation of man.        At this day the scholar must be ready to explain the steps by       which he reaches his conclusions. Not necessarily explaining the       minutiæ of his journey hither, but the main outlines of his       course. This seems to call for a slight outline of Geology. The       animal and vegetable tribes which have come and gone upon the       earth, following each other like the shadows of passing clouds on       a Summer’s day, have left their remains in the rocks which at       that time were forming. A close investigation of these remains       shows that they form the record book of nature, wherein we are       permitted to read somewhat of her secrets. This had long been a       sealed book to man; but science, as we have seen, constantly       extending her domain, at length taught him the alphabet.        And the Geologist now unfolds the past age of our world with a       variety of detail, and a certainty of conclusion well calculated       to inspire us with grateful admiration.        It is no longer a question that many ages must have rolled away,       during which our world was totally unfit for life of any kind,       either animal or vegetable.        The nebular theory of Laplace, as modified by the modern       astronomers, so satisfactorily explains many of the phenomena of       the solar system, that it takes rank almost as a demonstrated       fact. According to the terms of this theory, our Earth, now so       dependent on the sun for light and warmth, was itself a glowing       orb, and as a bright star radiated its light and heat into space.       Grand conception, and probably true. It is now useless to       speculate as to how many cycles of almost infinite years had       begun and ended, before Earth’s fading fires gave notice that       they must soon expire in night.        The stages through which the Earth passed in turn await the sun,       save that there is no further beneficent luminary to give him       light and heat: when time shall have quenched his fiery glow,       death and night shall reign supreme, where now is life and light.        Time is long, and nature never hurries. She builds for infinite       years, and recks not the time of building. The human mind is far       too feeble to comprehend the duration of time that sped away and       was gone ere the slowly falling temperature of the Earth admitted       the formation of a crust over her surface. When that came, the       first great scene was closed. The star had expired, the planet       rolled in her annual course around the still glowing central sun.       Now came the formative age of the world, when the great       continents were outlined.        The atmosphere gradually freed itself from its weight of       water-vapor, the rains descended, and the ocean took form and       contour. We are concerned only with the outlines of Geology, not       with its details. It is full of the most interesting facts, but       is foreign to our present purpose. We will only say, there is a       marked progression in the scale and importance of life forms.        The lower forms of animals appear first to be followed in time by       the higher. It is true that some forms have survived through all       the changes of Geological time to the present: yet, speaking       generally, some forms of life are peculiar to each age, and the       general phase of animal life is different with each period. They       thus form epochs in the history of the world as read from the       rocks, and though the beginning and ending of each age may blend       by insensible gradations with that of the preceding and       following, yet, taken as a whole, we observe in each such       singularities of form and structure as to give name to each       particular age.        In the fullness of time man appears; and it is our pleasant task       to trace the evidence of his primitive state, his growth in       culture, and his advancement made before the dawn of history. Our       inquiry, then, is as to his prehistoric state. We use this term       in the same sense as Dr. Wilson uses it: that is, to express the       whole period disclosed to us by means of archæological evidence,       as distinguished from what is known through historical records.       We can not doubt but that this includes by far the largest       portion of man’s existence. The time embraced within historical       records, though different in"]]]
