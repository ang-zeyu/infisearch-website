Chop sufficient cold boiled ham or tongue to make a half pint, add a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a few drops of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of pepper. Trim the crusts from an entire loaf of bread, butter the end of the loaf and cut off a thin slice, and so continue until you have the desired quantity of bread.  Shred one head of Romaine or a bunch of cress. This of course must be crisp and dry. Put a layer of the chicken mixture on the buttered side of a slice of bread, put on top another slice of buttered bread, then a thick layer of the shredded cress or Romaine. Put a thick layer of the tongue mixture on another slice of bread and cover it over the cress. Press firmly together and cut the slices directly into halves the long way. Wrap in waxed paper or tie with baby ribbon. Served at afternoon teas. If well made, they are the most elaborate and dainty of all sandwiches.   Tea Biscuit Sandwiches  Put one quart of flour into a bowl; add four level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a teaspoonful of salt, and sift. Rub in two level tablespoonfuls of butter and add sufficient milk to make a dough. This dough must not be soft, but must be sufficiently stiff to handle quickly. Knead quickly and roll into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick. Cut into good-sized round biscuits; they must be at least two and a half to three inches in diameter. Brush them with milk and bake in a quick oven. When done, cut the center from each biscuit, leaving a wall one inch thick; take out the crumb. Fill this space with deviled chicken. Chop sufficient cold cooked chicken to make a pint; add gradually eight tablespoonfuls of melted butter, cream or olive oil, a dash of cayenne, a saltspoonful of white pepper, a saltspoonful of celery seed and a saltspoonful of paprika. When thoroughly mixed fill the spaces just even and send at once to the table. These are nice for porch suppers, and may be served with either tea, coffee or chocolate, or may be used as an accompaniment to mayonnaise of tomatoes.   Cheese Sandwiches No. 1  Butter thin slices of pumpernickel or brown bread; put between each two slices a very thin layer of Swiss cheese, put two together, and cut into triangles; garnish with cress.   Cheese Sandwiches No. 2  Chop fine a quarter of a pound of soft American cheese; put it into a saucepan, add the yolk of one egg beaten with two tablespoonfuls of cream, a saltspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper and half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Have ready cut and buttered a sufficient number of slices of bread, either white or whole wheat. Stir the cheese over the fire until it is thoroughly melted; take from the fire and when cool spread it between the slices of bread and butter; that is, spread it on one slice and cover with the other; press two together and cut into forms.   Cheese Sandwiches No. 3  Rub or pound until perfectly smooth or well mixed one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of soft club-house cheese, a tablespoonful of grated Parmesan, a saltspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of anchovy paste; add a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar and a half saltspoonful of pepper. Cut the bread into thin slices, toast it until it is crisp, not hard; spread this mixture on one slice, cover it with another, and cut into shapes.   Workman's Cheese Sandwiches  Cut slices of brown bread about a half inch thick. Do not remove the crusts. Take a half pint of cottage cheese; press it through a sieve; add to it two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a half teaspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of thick cream. Beat until smooth and light. Spread each slice of bread thickly with the cheese mixture, then put a very thin slice of white bread on top of the cheese, then cheese and brown bread, press together. Have the outside brown bread with a layer of cheese on each, and between the layers of cheese a slice of white bread. These are palatable, and are very much better for the average workman than bread and ham.   German Sandwiches  Put a half pound of Swiss cheese through the meat grinder; add to it the yolks of two eggs, four tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a dash of cayenne and a half teaspoonful of salt. Rub until you have a perfectly smooth paste. Put this mixture between layers of buttered rye bread and serve. Do not trim the crusts nor cut.   Honolulu Sandwiches  Put two Spanish sweet peppers (pimientos), one Neufchatel cheese, one pared and quartered apple and twelve blanched almonds through the meat grinder. These may be put through alternately, or mixed as you grind. Rub the mixture, add a half teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of paprika. Spread this between thin slices of buttered white or brown bread. Press, cut the crusts and cut into fingers.   My Favorite    ½ pound of American cheese   ½ cupful of thick sour cream   1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce   1 tablespoonful of tomato catsup   ½ teaspoonful of salt   ½ teaspoonful of paprika  Chop or mash the cheese, add gradually the cream, and when smooth add all the other ingredients. Spread this mixture on thin slices of buttered bread, cover the top with chopped cress, then cover with another slice of bread, press the two together, trim off the crusts and cut into triangles.   Creole Sandwiches  Put a half pound of American cheese through your meat grinder, add to it one Neufchatel cheese, mix well together; add one fresh peeled chopped tomato. Peel the tomato and cut it into halves; squeeze out the seeds and chop the flesh quite fine. Add one finely chopped sweet red pepper. Add a half teaspoonful of salt and a little black pepper; mix and spread between slices of white bread, or you may use one slice of white with one slice of whole wheat bread. These are usually served cut into rounds with an ordinary cake cutter. If you cut these economically you can make one good sized round sandwich and a crescent from each, or if you use a very small cutter you should make four round sandwiches.   Curry Sandwiches  Rub one Neufchatel or Philadelphia cream cheese to a paste. Add one pimiento, chopped fine; a dozen almonds put through the meat grinder; a dozen pecan meats, also ground; a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, a level teaspoonful of curry and two tablespoonfuls of desiccated grated cocoanut. Mix thoroughly, add sufficient olive oil to make a smooth paste, and spread between thin, unbuttered slices of white bread; trim the crusts and cut into long fingers. These are nice to serve with plain lettuce salad at dinner.   Deviled Cheese Sandwiches  Put one pound of American cheese through your meat chopper. Add two tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a half teaspoonful of paprika, a dash of cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of olive oil or melted butter, four tablespoonfuls of sherry and a half teaspoonful of salt. Mix until perfectly smooth, and spread between thin slices of buttered bread; trim the crusts and cut into triangles.   Roquefort Sandwiches  Mash a quarter of a pound of Roquefort cheese, adding gradually sufficient melted butter to make a paste. Spread this between slices of buttered bread, press together, trim the crusts, and cut into fingers.   Camembert Sandwiches  Spread Camembert cheese between slices of buttered whole wheat bread, trim the crusts and cut into shape. These may be served after lunch with coffee, or are exceedingly nice for picnics or for afternoons where coffee is served.   Cottage Cheese Sandwiches  These are nice for country picnics. The cottage cheese should be made rather dry. After it has drained and is quite dry, moisten it by adding either thick cream or melted butter; do not make it too soft. Add a saltspoonful of black pepper and a palatable seasoning of salt. Spread between slices of buttered whole wheat or white bread, press the two together, trim the crusts and cut into shape.   Salt-Cucumber Sandwiches  Spread the bread, and cut the slices about half an inch thick. Then cut a German or Holland cucumber into very thin slices; put these slices all over the bread. Take the center from a head of lettuce; hold it together, and slice it down in sort of shreds; put this over the cucumber, and have ready some white meat of chicken, cut into the thinnest possible slices, and cover the lettuce with chicken; then sprinkle over more shredded lettuce and a little mayonnaise; put over another slice of buttered bread; press the two together, trim into shape and serve on a napkin in a pretty wicker basket.   Cucumber Sandwiches  These are very nice to serve with a fish course in place of bread or rolls and a salad. Slice the cucumbers very thin and soak them in ice water for one or two hours. They must be crisp and brittle and made just at serving time. Beat together three tablespoonfuls of olive oil, one tablespoonful of vinegar, a saltspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper; stand this dressing on the ice until it thickens. Butter thin slices of bread, cover them with a layer of cucumbers that have been drained and dried on a napkin, sprinkle over the dressing, put on another layer of buttered bread. Press together, trim the crusts and cut into triangles. Heap these at once on a napkin and send to the table.   Curried Oyster Sandwiches  Butter a slice of bread before you take it off the loaf; cut it about a half inch thick and remove the crusts. First of all, cover each slice with a thin layer of hard-boiled egg that has been pressed through a sieve or chopped very fine. In the center of this sandwich put the soft parts of six pickled oysters. Put a tablespoonful of butter and one of flour into a little saucepan; mix without melting; add a gill of thick cream, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a teaspoonful of curry and a half teaspoonful of turmeric. Bring to boiling point; beat and stand away until perfectly cold. When you are ready to serve the sandwiches, cover each one with a thin layer of this sauce; put a slice of bread on top, press"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29329"],["title","Sandwiches (#3)"],["body","ogether, and serve. The sauce must not go over the sandwiches until you are ready to serve; and then, remember, you have but one layer between two slices of bread.   Curried Egg Sandwiches  Hard boil four eggs, remove the yolks from the whites; chop the whites very, very fine, and press the yolks through a sieve. Add to the yolks gradually four tablespoonfuls of melted butter or olive oil, a half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice, a half teaspoonful of curry, and rub until thoroughly smooth. Spread thin slices of bread, cover them with a very thin layer of the yolk mixture, then a layer of the chopped whites, another slice of buttered bread.

Curried Chicken Sandwiches  Chop sufficient cold boiled chicken to make a half pint. Rub together one tablespoonful of butter and one tablespoonful of flour; add a half cupful of cold milk, and stir over hot water until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add the chicken gradually to this, mashing and rubbing all the while. Add a level teaspoonful of curry powder, a half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of onion juice and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. When cold, spread between layers of buttered bread, trim the crusts and cut into shapes.  Almost any bits of left-over meat may be substituted for the chicken and made into sandwiches of this kind.   Crab Sandwiches  Remove the meat from six hard-boiled crabs; mix it with four tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise dressing; put it between slices of bread and butter and press two together; trim off the crusts, cut into triangles and serve at once.  Crab and lobster sandwiches should not be allowed to stand for more than an hour, and then must be wrapped carefully in a clean, damp cloth.   Cream of Chicken Sandwiches  Take sufficient white meat of chicken to make a half cup; chop and pound it; reduce it to a paste. Put a teaspoonful of granulated gelatin in two tablespoonfuls of cold water; then stand it over the fire until it has dissolved. Whip a half pint of cream to a stiff froth. Add the gelatin to the chicken; add a teaspoonful of grated horseradish and a half teaspoonful of salt. Stir this until it begins to thicken, cool and add carefully the whipped cream and stand it away until very cold. When ready to make the sandwiches, butter the bread and cut the slices a little thicker than the usual slices for sandwiches. Cover each slice with this cream mixture; trim off the crusts and cut sandwiches into fancy shapes. Garnish the top with olives cut into rings. In the center of each sandwich make just a little mound of capers, using the olives at the four corners; each sandwich may be garnished in a different way. Little pieces of celery, with the white top attached, make also a pretty garnish. These sandwiches are not covered with a second slice of bread.   Deviled Sandwiches  Chop a quarter of a pound of cold, boiled tongue very fine; add to it two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a dash of red pepper, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and a saltspoonful of paprika; mix and add the hard-boiled yolks of three eggs that have been pressed through a sieve.

Fish Sandwiches  Rub to a smooth paste a quarter of a pound of cold, boiled fish; add half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoonful of olive oil, a half saltspoonful of salt, and a half saltspoonful of black pepper. Spread the slices of bread on the loaf, cut them off about a half inch in thickness; trim off the crusts, put on each slice dainty lettuce leaves, and fill the center with the fish mixture. Cover with another layer of buttered bread from which you have trimmed the crusts, and press the two together.   Flaked Fish Sandwiches  Flake cold boiled white fleshed fish, dust it with salt and pepper and sprinkle it with lemon juice. Butter thin slices of brown bread; do not trim off the crusts. Put on one slice a layer of thin crisp cucumber, cover this with flaked fish, put a tablespoonful of mayonnaise in the center, put on another layer of chopped cress, then a slice of buttered brown bread. Press together and cut into halves.   Spanish Sandwiches  Mash the hard-boiled yolks of three eggs, add twelve boiled shrimps, either pounded in a mortar or chopped very fine.

Mix and stir in two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped parsley. Spread a thin layer of this dressing over a plain slice of bread, do not butter the bread, cover it with fish, put on top a crisp lettuce leaf, then cover with another slice of bread that has been spread with the dressing. Press, trim the crusts and cut into fingers.   French Chicken Sandwiches  Chop the white meat of one chicken very fine; pound to a paste. Add one-half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of red pepper. Cover one tablespoonful of gelatin, with a tablespoonful of cold water, soak it for about five minutes, then add to it ten tablespoonfuls of thick cream; stand this over teakettle and stir until gelatin is dissolved. Now, beat into this the chicken, stand it aside in a square pan until cold. Cut the chicken into very thin slices; put a slice on a slice of buttered bread; cover this with another slice of bread and cut into shape.   Game Sandwiches  Remove the breasts from two partridges after they have been baked or roasted. Chop the meat rather fine; reduce two sardines to a paste.

Press the two together; do not remove the crusts. Serve on a napkin in a wicker basket.   Ham Sandwiches  Chop cold boiled ham very fine. To each cupful of this ham, after it has been chopped, stir in two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, dash of red pepper and about one-half teaspoonful of onion juice. Have bread sufficiently stale to cut nicely. Remove end crust, butter and cut a very thin slice; remove the crusts, and spread with the ham paste. Serve same as tongue sandwiches.   Indian Sandwiches  Take two sardines, remove skin and bones, put them into mortar and pound fine; add a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, a dash of salt and red pepper and the hard-boiled yolks of six eggs, rubbed smooth; stir two tablespoonfuls of olive oil into the mixture at the last.
