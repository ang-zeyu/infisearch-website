Found from August to October.   _Amanita recutita. Fr._  THE FRESH-SKINNED AMANITA. POISONOUS.  Recutita, having a fresh or new skin. Pileus convex, then expanded, dry, smooth, often covered with small scales, fragments of the volva; margin almost even, gray or brownish.  The gills forming lines down the stem.  The stem stuffed, then hollow, attenuated upward, silky, white, ring distant, edge of volva not free, frequently obliterated.  Rather common where there is much pine woods. August to October.  This species differs from A. porphyria in ring not being brown or brownish.   _Amanita virosa. Fr._  THE POISONOUS AMANITA.  Virosa, full of poison. The pileus is from four to five inches broad; the entire plant white, conical, then expanded; viscid when moist; margin often somewhat lobed, even.  The gills are free, crowded.  The stem is frequently six inches long, stuffed, round, with a bulbous base, attenuated upward, squamulose, ring near apex, volva large, lax.  The spores are subglobose, 8-10µ. This is probably simply a form of A. phalloides. It is found in damp woods. August to October.   _Amanita muscaria. Linn._  THE FLY AMANITA. POISONOUS.  [Illustration: Figure 13.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ Cap reddish or orange, showing scales on the cap and at base of stem.]  Muscaria, from musca, a fly. The fly Amanita is a very conspicuous and handsome plant. It is so called because infusions of it are used to kill flies. I have frequently seen dead flies on the fully developed caps, where they had sipped of the dew upon the cap, and, like the Lotos-eaters of old, had forgotten to move away. It is a very abundant plant in the woods of Columbiana county, this state. It is also found frequently in many localities about Chillicothe. It is often a very handsome and attractive plant, because of the bright colors of the cap in contrast with the white stem and gills, as well as the white scales on the surface of the cap. These scales seem to behave somewhat differently from those of other species of Amanita. Instead of shrivelling, curling, and falling off they are inclined to adhere firmly to the smooth skin of the pileus, turning brownish, and in the maturely expanded plant appear like scattered drops of mud which have dried upon the pileus, as you will observe in Figure 13.  The pileus is three to five inches broad, globose at first, then dumb-bell in shape, convex, then expanded, nearly flat in age; margin in matured plants slightly striate; the surface of the cap is covered with white floccose scales, fragments of the volva, these scales being easily removed so that old plants are frequently comparatively smooth. The color of the young plant is normally red, then orange to pale yellow; late in the season, or in old plants, it fades to almost white. The flesh is white, sometimes stained yellow close to the cuticle.  The gills are pure white, very symmetrical, various in length, the shorter ones terminating under the cap very abruptly, crowded, free, but reaching the stem, decurrent in the form of lines somewhat broader in front, sometimes a slight tinge of yellow will be observed in the gills.  The stem is white, often yellowish with age, pithy and often hollow, becoming rough and shaggy, finally scaly, the scales below appearing to merge into the form of an obscure cup, the stem four to six inches long.  The veil covers the gills of the young plant and later is seen as a collar-like ring on the stem, soft, lax, deflexed, in old specimens it is often destroyed. The spores are white and broadly elliptical.  The history of this plant is as interesting as a novel. Its deadly properties were known to the Greeks and Romans. The pages of history record its undoing and its accessory to crime. Pliny says, alluding to this species, \"very conveniently adapted for poisoning.\" This was undoubtedly the species that Agrippina, the mother of Nero, used to poison her husband, the Emperor Claudius; and the same that Nero used in that famous banquet when all his guests, his tribunes and centurions, and Agrippina herself, fell victims to its poisonous properties.  However, it is said this mushroom is habitually eaten by certain people as an intoxicant; indeed, it is used in Kamchatka and Asiatic Russia, generally, where the Amanita drunkard takes the place of the opium fiend and the alcohol bibber in other countries. By reading Colonel George Kennan in his \"Tent-life in Siberia,\" and Cooke's \"Seven Sisters of Sleep,\" you will find a full description of the toxic employment of this fungus which will far surpass any possible imagination.  It caused the death of the Czar Alexis of Russia; also Count de Vecchi, with a number of his friends, in Washington in 1896. He was in search of the Orange Amanita and found this, and the consequences were serious.  In size, shape, and color of the cap there is similarity, but in other respects the two are very different. They may be contrasted as follows:  Orange Amanita, edible.--Cap _smooth_, gills _yellow_, stem _yellow_, wrapper _persistent_, _membranaceous_, _white_.  Fly Amanita, poisonous.--Cap _warty_, gills _white_, stem _white_, or slightly _yellowish_, wrapper _soon breaking_ into _fragments or scales_, white or sometimes yellowish brown.  Found along roadsides, wood margins, and in thin woods. It prefers poor soil, and is more abundant where poplar and hemlock grow. From June to frost.  [Illustration: Figure 14.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ One-half natural size, showing development of the plant.]   _Amanita Frostiana. Pk._  FROST'S AMANITA. POISONOUS.  [Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._  Figure 15.--Amanita Frostiana.]  Frostiana, named in honor of Charles C. Frost.  The pileus is convex, expanded, bright orange or yellow, warty, sometimes smooth, striate on the margin, pileus one to three inches broad.  The gills are free, white, or slightly tinged with yellow.  The stem is white or yellow, stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes evanescent, ring, bulbous, at the base, the bulb slightly margined by the volva. The spores globose, 8-10µ in diameter. _Peck._  Great care should be taken to distinguish this species from A. cæsarea because of its often yellow stem and gills. I found some beautiful specimens on Cemetery Hill and on Ralston's Run. It is very poisonous and should be carefully avoided, or rather, it should be thoroughly known that it may be avoided. The striations on the margin of its yellow tinge might lead one to mistake it for the Orange Amanita. It is found in shady woods and sometimes in open places where there is underbrush. June to October.   _Amanita verna. Bull._  THE SPRING AMANITA. POISONOUS.  [Illustration: Figure 16.--Amanita verna. Two-thirds natural size, showing the volva cup and the ring.]  Verna, pertaining to spring. This species is considered by some only a white variety of Amanita phalloides. The plant is always a pure white. It can only be distinguished from the white form of the A. phalloides by its closer sheathing volva and perhaps a more ovate pileus when young.  The pileus is at first ovate, then expanded, somewhat depressed, viscid when moist, even, margin naked, smooth. The gills are free.  The stem is stuffed, with advancing age hollow, equal, floccose, white, ringed, base bulbous, volva closely embracing the stem with its free margin, ring forming a broad collar, reflexed. The spores are globose, 8µ broad.  This species is very abundant on the wooded hills in this section of the state. Its pure white color makes it an attractive plant, and it should be carefully learned. I have found it before the middle of June.   _Amanita magnivelaris. Pk._  THE LARGE VEILED AMANITA. POISONOUS.  Magnivelaris is from _magnus_, large; _velum_, a veil.  The pileus is convex, often nearly plane, with even margin, smooth, slightly viscid when moist, white or yellowish-white.  The gills are free, close, white.  The stem is long, nearly equal, white, smooth, furnished with a large mebranaceous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and rooting. The spores are broadly elliptical.  This species very closely resembles Amanita verna, from which it can be distinguished by its large, persistent annulus, the elongated downward-tapering bulb of its stem, and, especially, by its elliptical spores.  It is found solitary and in the woods. I found several on Ralston's Run under beech trees. Found from July to October.   _Amanita pellucidula. Ban._  Pileus at first campanulate, then expanded, slightly viscid, fleshy in center, attenuated at the margin; color a smooth bright red, deeper at the top, shaded into clear transparent yellow at the margin; glossy, flesh white, unchanging.  The gills are ventricose, free, numerous, yellow.  The stem is stuffed, ring descending, fugacious. Peck's 44th Report.  This species differs from Amanita cæsarea in having an even margin and a white stem. It is only a form of the cæsarea. The white stem will attract the attention of the collector.   _Amanita solitaria. Bull._  THE SOLITARY AMANITA.  [Illustration: Figure 17.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size, showing the peculiar veil.]  [Illustration: Figure 18.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size, showing scaly cap and stem.]  [Illustration: Plate II. Figure 19.--Amanita solitaria.  Natural size, showing scaly cap and stem, plant white.]  Solitary, growing alone. I have found this plant in various parts of the state and have always found them growing alone. In Poke Hollow, where I found the specimens in the illustrations, I found several on the hillside on different occasions, but I have never found them growing in groups. It is quite large in size, white or whitish, very woolly or floccose. Usually the cap, stem, and the gills are covered with a floccose substance which will serve to identify the species. This fluffy exterior adheres readily to your hands or clothing. The cap is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29086"],["title","The Mushroom, Edible and Otherwise (#7)"],["body","tinged with brown, but the flesh is white and smells quite strong, not unlike chloride of lime. The annulus is frequently torn from the stem and is found adhering to the margin of the cap.  The pileus is from three to five inches broad, or more, when fully expanded, at first globose to hemispherical, as will be seen in Figures 17 and 18, convex, or plane, warty, white or whitish, the pointed scales being easily rubbed off, or washed off by heavy rains, these scales varying in size from small granules to quite large conical flakes, and differing in condition and color in different plants.  The gills are free, or are not attached by the upper part, the edges are frequently floccose where they are torn from the slight connection with the upper surface of the veil; white, or slightly tinged with cream-color, broad.  The stem is four to eight inches high, solid, becoming stuffed when old, bulbous, rooting deep in the soil, very scaly, ventricose sometimes in young plants, white, very mealy. Volva friable. Ring, large, lacerated, usually hanging to the margin of the cap, but in Figure 19 it adheres to the stem.  This is a large and beautiful plant in the woods, and easily identified because of its floccose nature and the large bulb at the base of the stem. It is not so warty and the odor is not nearly so strong as the Amanita strobiliformis. It is edible but very great caution should be used to be sure of your species. Found from July to October in woods and roadsides.   _Amanita radicata. Pk._  [Illustration: Figure 20.--Amanita radicata. Two-thirds natural size, showing scaly cap, bulbous stem and root broken off and peculiar veil.]  Radicata means furnished with a root. The root of the specimen in Figure 20 was broken off in getting it out of the ground.  The pileus is subglobose, becoming convex, dry, verrucose, white, margin even, flesh firm, white, odor resembling that of chloride of lime.  The gills are close, free, white.  The stem is solid, deeply radicating, swollen at the base or bulbous, floccose or mealy at the top, white; veil thin, floccose, or mealy, white, soon lacerated and attached in fragments to the margin of the pileus or evanescent. The spores are broadly elliptic, 7.5-10µ long, 6-7µ broad. _Peck._  This is quite a large and beautiful plant, very closely related to Amanita strobiliformis, but readily distinguished from it because of its white color, its clearly radiating stem, and small spores. The stem shows to be bulbous and the cap covered with warts. I found the plant frequently in Poke Hollow and on Ralston's Run. July and August.  [Illustration: Figure 21.--Amanita radicata.]   _Amanita strobiliformis. Fr._  THE FIR-CONE AMANITA.  [Illustration: Plate III. Figure 22.--Amanita strobiliformis.  Young plant showing veil covering the entire gill-surface of the plant. Cap covered with persistent warts, stem rough and rooting, odor strong of chloride of lime.]  [Illustration: Plate IV. Figure 23.--Amanita strobiliformis.  Showing long root.]  Strobiliformis means fir-cone form; so called from the similarity of its undeveloped form to that of the strobile of the pine.  The pileus is six to eight inches broad, when young, subglobose, then convex, expanded, nearly plane, with persistent warts, white, ash-color, sometimes yellow on the cap, the margin even and extending beyond the gills; warts hard, angular, pointed, white; flesh white, compact.  The gills are free, crowded, rounded, white, becoming yellow.  The stem is five to eight inches long, frequently longer, tapering upward, floccosely scaly, bulbous, rooting beyond the bulb; ring large, torn; volva forming concentric rings. The spores are 13-14×8-9µ.  This is one of the most stately plants in the woods. It is said to be edible, but the strong pungent odor, like chloride of lime, has deterred me from eating it. This, however, is said to disappear in cooking. It grows to be very large. Dr. Kellerman and I found a specimen in Haynes's Hollow whose stem measured over eleven inches, and cap nine inches. It is found in open woods and wood margins. Great caution should be used before the plant is eaten to know it beyond doubt. Found July to October.   _Amanita mappa. Fr._  THE DELICATE AMANITA. POISONOUS.  [Illustration: Figure 24.--Amanita mappa. Natural size, showing long smooth stem, cap yellowish-white and ring.]  Mappa means a napkin, so called from the volva. The pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, then expanded, plane, obtuse or depressed, without separable cuticle; margin nearly even; white or yellowish, usually with patches of the volva dry.  The gills are adnexed, close, narrow, shining, white.  The stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, then hollow, cylindrical, nearly smooth, bulbous, nearly globose at the base, white, almost equal above the bulb.  The volva with its free margin is acute and narrow. The ring is membranaceous, superior, soft, lax, ragged.  Its color is quite as variable and its habits are much like A. phalloides, from which it can only be distinguished by its less developed volva, which, instead of being cup-shaped, is little more than a mere rim fringing the bulb. The odor at times is very strong. It is found in open woods and under brush. Label it poisonous.   _Amanita crenulata. Pk._  [Illustration: Figure 25.--Amanita crenulata.]  Crenulata means bearing notches, referring to the crenulate form of the gills, which are very distinct.  The pileus is thin, two to two and a half inches broad, broadly ovate, becoming convex, or nearly plane, somewhat striate on the margin, adorned with a few thin whitish floccose warts or with whitish flocculent patches, whitish or grayish, sometimes tinged with yellow.  The gills are close, reaching the stem, and sometimes forming decurrent lines upon it, floccose crenulate on the edge, the short ones truncate at the inner extremity, white.  The stem is equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow, white, the annulus slight, evanescent. Spores broadly elliptic or subglobose, 7.5-10 long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single large nucleus. _Peck_, Bull. Tor. Bot. Club.  The stem is bulbous at the base but the volva is rarely seen upon it although slight patches are frequently seen on the pileus. The ring is very evanescent and soon disappears. The specimens I have received from Mrs. Blackford look good enough to eat and she speaks highly of the edible qualities of this species. So far as I know this plant is confined to the New England states. Found from September to November. It grows in low damp ground under trees.   _Amanita cothurnata. Atkinson._  THE BOOTED AMANITA.  [Illustration: Figure 26.--Amanita cothurnata. Slightly reduced from natural size, showing different stages of development.]  Cothurnata means buskined; from corthunus, a high shoe or buskin worn by actors. This species is easily separated from the other Amanitas. I shall give Prof. Atkinson's description of it in full: \"The pileus is fleshy and passes from nearly globose to hemispherical, convex, expanded, and when specimens are very old sometimes the margin is elevated. It is usually white, though specimens are found with a tinge of citron yellow in the center or of tawny yellow in the center of other specimens. The pileus is viscid, strongly so when moist. It is finely striate on the margin, and covered with numerous, white, floccose scales from the upper half of the volva, forming more or less dense patches, which may wash off in heavy rains.  The gills are rounded next the stem, and quite remote from it. The edge of the gills is often eroded or frazzly from the torn-out threads with which they were loosely connected to the upper side of the veil in the young or button stage. The spores are globose or nearly so, with a large \"nucleus\" nearly filling the spore.  The stem is cylindrical, even, and expanded below into quite a large oval bulb, the stem just above the bulb being margined by a close-fitting roll of the volva, and the upper edge of this presenting the appearance of having been sewed at the top like the rolled edge of a garment or buskin. The surface of the stem is minutely floccose, scaly or strongly so, and decidedly hollow even from a very young stage or sometimes when young with loose threads in the cavity.  A. cothurnata resembles in many points A. frostiana and it will afford the collector a very interesting study to note the points of difference. I found the two species growing on Cemetery Hill. Figure 26 is from plants collected in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fisher. Found in September and October.   _Amanita rubescens. Fr._  THE REDDISH AMANITA. EDIBLE.  [Illustration: Figure 27.--Amanita rubescens. One-third natural size, caps a dingy reddish-brown, stains reddish when bruised.]  Rubescens is from _rubesco_, to become red. It is so called because of the dingy reddish color of the entire plant, and also because when the plant is handled or bruised it quickly changes to a reddish color. It is often a large bulky plant and rather uninviting.  The pileus is four to six inches broad, dingy reddish, often becoming pale flesh color, fleshy, oval to convex, then expanded; sprinkled with small pale warts, unequal, mealy, scattered, white, easily separating; margin even, faintly striate, especially in wet weather; flesh soft, white, becoming red when broken.  The gills are white or whitish, free from the stem but reaching it and forming at times decurrent lines upon it, thin, crowded.  The stem is four or five inches long, nearly cylindrical, solid, though inclined to be soft within, tapering from the base up, with a bulbous base which often tapers abruptly below, containing reddish scales, color dull red. It has seldom any distinct evidence of a volva at the base but abundant evidence on the cap. Ring large, superior, white, and fragile.  The plant is quite variable in color, sometimes becoming almost white with a slight reddish or brownish tint. The strong"]]]
