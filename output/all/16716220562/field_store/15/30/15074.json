I make no doubt but that the      former was as thoroughly acquainted with the _vera edizione_      of the Giuntæ edition of Boccaccio's Decamerone, 1527, 4to.,      as either Haym, Orlandi, or Bandini. Paterson, with all his      skill, was mistaken in this article when he catalogued      Croft's books. See Bibl. Crofts. No. 3976: his true      edition was knocked down for 6_s._!!!]       [Footnote 29: Spenser's general acquaintance with Italian      literature has received the best illustration in Mr. Todd's      Variorum edition of the poet's works; where the reader will      find, in the notes, a constant succession of anecdotes of,      and references to, the state of anterior and contemporaneous      literature, foreign and domestic.]  In the seventeenth century, from the death of Elizabeth to the commencement of Anne's reign, it seems to have made considerable havoc; yet, such was our blindness to it that we scrupled not to engage in overtures for the purchase of Isaac Vossius's[30] fine library, enriched with many treasures from the Queen of Sweden's, which this versatile genius scrupled not to pillage without confession or apology. During this century our great reasoners and philosophers began to be in motion; and, like the fumes of tobacco, which drive the concealed and clotted insects from the interior to the extremity of the leaves, the infectious particles of the BIBLIOMANIA set a thousand busy brains a-thinking, and produced ten thousand capricious works, which, over-shadowed by the majestic remains of Bacon, Locke, and Boyle, perished for want of air, and warmth, and moisture.       [Footnote 30: \"The story is extant, and written in very      choice _French_.\" Consult Chauffepié's _Supplement to      Bayle's Dictionary_, vol. iv. p. 621. note Q. Vossius's      library was magnificent and extensive. The University of      Leyden offered not less than 36,000 florins for it. _Idem._      p. 631.]  The reign of Queen Anne was not exempt from the influence of this disease; for during this period, Maittaire[31] began to lay the foundation of his extensive library, and to publish some bibliographical works which may be thought to have rather increased, than diminished, its force. Meanwhile, Harley[32] Earl of Oxford watched its progress with an anxious eye; and although he might have learnt experience from the fatal examples of R. Smith,[33] and T. Baker,[34] and the more recent ones of Thomas Rawlinson,[35] Bridges,[36] and Collins,[37] yet he seemed resolved to brave and to baffle it; but, like his predecessors, he was suddenly crushed within the gripe of the demon, and fell one of the most splendid of his victims. Even the unrivalled medical skill of Mead[38] could save neither his friend nor himself. The Doctor survived his Lordship about twelve years; dying of the complaint called the BIBLIOMANIA! He left behind an illustrious character; sufficient to flatter and soothe those who may tread in his footsteps, and fall victims to a similar disorder.       [Footnote 31: Of MICHAEL MAITTAIRE I have given a brief      sketch in my Introduction to the _Greek and Latin Classics_,      vol. I, 148. Mr. Beloe, in the 3rd vol. of his _Anecdotes of      Literature_, p. ix., has described his merits with justice.      The principal value of Maittaire's _Annales Typographici_      consists in a great deal of curious matter detailed in the      notes; but the absence of the \"lucidus ordo\" renders the      perusal of these fatiguing and dissatisfactory. The author      brought a full and well-informed mind to the task he      undertook--but he wanted taste and precision in the      arrangement of his materials. The eye wanders over a vast      indigested mass; and information, when it is to be acquired      with excessive toil, is, comparatively, seldom acquired.      Panzer has adopted an infinitely better plan, on the model      of Orlandi; and, if his materials had been _printed_ with      the same beauty with which they appear to have been      composed, and his annals had descended to as late a period      as those of Maittaire, his work must have made us,      eventually, forget that of his predecessor. The      bibliographer is, no doubt, aware that of Maittaire's first      volume there are two editions. Why the author did not      reprint, in the second edition (1733), the facsimile of the      epigram and epistle of LASCAR prefixed to the edition of the      Anthology 1496, and the disquisition concerning the ancient      editions of Quintilian (both of which were in the first      edition of 1719), is absolutely inexplicable. Maittaire was      sharply attacked for this absurdity, in the \"Catalogus      Auctorum,\" of the \"_Annus Tertius Sæcularis Inv. Art.      Topog._\" Harlem, 1741, 8vo. p. 11. \"Rara certe Librum      augendi methodus (exclaims the author)! Satis patet auctorem      hoc eo fecisse consilio, ut et primæ et secundæ Libri sive      editioni pretium suum constaret, et una æque ac altera      Lectoribus necessaria esset.\"       The catalogue of Maittaire's library [1748, 2 parts, 8vo.],      which affords ample proof of the BIBLIOMANIA of its      collector, is exceedingly scarce. A good copy of it, even      unpriced, is worth a guinea: it was originally sold for 4      shillings; and was drawn up by Maittaire himself.]       [Footnote 32: In a periodical publication called \"_The      Director_,\" to which I contributed under the article of      \"_Bibliographiana_\" (and of which the printer of this work,      Mr. William Savage, is now the sole publisher), there was      rather a minute analysis of the famous library of HARLEY,      EARL OF OXFORD: a library which seems not only to have      revived, but eclipsed, the splendour of the Roman one formed      by Lucullus. The following is an abridgement of this      analysis:                                                            VOLUMES.       1.

Pamphlets--_Four Hundred Thousand_!       Mr. Gough says, these books \"filled thirteen handsome      chambers, and two long galleries.\" Osborne the bookseller      purchased them for £13,000: a sum little more than two      thirds of the price of the binding, as paid by Lord Oxford.      The bookseller was accused of injustice and parsimony; but      the low prices which he afterwards affixed to the articles,      and the tardiness of their sale, are sufficient refutations      of this charge. Osborne opened his shop for the inspection      of the books on Tuesday the 14th of February, 1744; for fear      \"of the curiosity of the spectators, before the sale,      producing disorder in the disposition of the books.\" The      dispersion of the HARLEIAN COLLECTION is a blot in the      literary annals of our country: had there then been such a      Speaker, and such a spirit in the House of Commons, as we      now possess, the volumes of Harley would have been reposing      with the MARBLES OF TOWNLEY!]       [Footnote 33: \"BIBLIOTHECA SMITHIANA: sive Catalogus      Librorum in quavis facultate insigniorum, quos in usum suum      et Bibliothecæ ornamentum multo ære sibi comparavit vir      clarissimus doctissimusque D. RICHARDUS SMITH, &c., Londini,      1682,\" 4to. I recommend the collector of curious and      valuable catalogues to lay hold upon the present one (of      which a more particular description will be given in another      work) whenever it comes in his way. The address \"To the      Reader,\" in which we are told that \"this so much celebrated,      so often desired, so long expected, library is now exposed      to sale,\" gives a very interesting account of the owner.      Inter alia, we are informed that Mr. Smith \"was as      constantly known every day to walk his rounds through the      shops, as to sit down to his meals, &c.;\" and that \"while      others were forming arms, and new-modelling kingdoms, _his_      great ambition was to become master of a good book.\"       The catalogue itself justifies every thing said in      commendation of the collector of the library. The      arrangement is good; the books, in almost all departments of      literature, foreign and domestic, valuable and curious; and      among the English ones I have found some of the rarest      Caxtons to refer to in my edition of Ames. What would Mr.      Bindley, or Mr. Malone, or Mr. Douce, give to have the      _creaming_ of such a collection of \"Bundles of Stitcht Books      and Pamphlets,\" as extends from page 370 to 395 of this      catalogue!

For some cause, I do not now      recollect what, Baker took his name off the books of St.      John's College, Cambridge, to which he belonged; but such      was his attachment to the place, and more especially to the      library, that he spent a great portion of the ensuing twenty      years of his life within the precincts of the same:      frequently comforted and refreshed, no doubt, by the sight      of the magnificent LARGE PAPER copies of Walton and Castell,      and of Cranmer's Bible UPON VELLUM!]       [Footnote 35: This THOMAS RAWLINSON, who is introduced in      the Tatler under the name _Tom Folio_, was a very      extraordinary character, and most desperately addicted to      book-hunting. Because his own house was not large enough, he      hired _London House_, in Aldersgate Street, for the      reception of his library; and here he used to regale himself      with the sight and the scent of innumerable black letter      volumes, arranged in \"sable garb,\" and stowed perhaps \"three      deep,\" from the bottom to the top of his house. He died in      1725; and Catalogues of his books for sale continued, for      nine succeeding years, to meet the public eye. The following      is a list of all the parts which I have ever met with; taken      from copies in Mr. Heber's possession.       _Part_ 1. _A Catalogue of choice and valuable Books in most      Faculties and Languages_: being the sixth part of the      collection made by THOS.

At the end, it would seem that a catalogue of his prints,      and MSS. missing in the last sale, were to be published the      ensuing winter.       N.B. The black-letter books are catalogued in the Gothic      letter.]       [Footnote 36: \"BIBLIOTHECÆ BRIDGESIANÆ CATALOGUS: or, A      Catalogue of the Entire Library of JOHN BRIDGES, late of      _Lincoln's Inn_, Esq., &c., which will begin to be sold, by      Auction, on Monday the seventh day of February, 1725-6, at      his chambers in _Lincoln's Inn_, No. 6.\"       From a priced copy of this sale catalogue, in my possession,      once belonging to Nourse, the bookseller in the Strand, I      find that the following was the produce of the sale:       The Amount of the books         £3730  0  0      Prints and books of Prints        394 17  6                                      -----------      Total Amount of the Sale        £4124 17  6       Two different catalogues of this valuable collection of      books were printed. The one was analysed, or a _catalogue      raisonné_; to which was prefixed a print of a Grecian      portico, &c., with ornaments and statues: the other      (expressly for the sale) was an indigested and extremely      confused one--to which was prefixed a print, designed and      engraved by A. Motte, of an oak felled, with a number of men      cutting down and carrying away its branches; illustrative of      the following Greek motto inscribed on a scroll      above--[Greek: Dryos pesousês pas anêr xyleuetai]: \"An      affecting memento (says Mr. Nichols, very justly, in his      _Anecdotes of Bowyer_, p. 557) to the collectors of great      libraries, who cannot, or do not, leave them to some public      accessible repository.\"]       [Footnote 37: In the year 1730-1, there was sold by auction,      at St. Paul's Coffee-house, in St. Paul's Church-yard      (beginning every evening at five o'clock), the library of      the celebrated Free-Thinker,       ANTHONY COLLINS, ESQ.       \"Containing a collection of several thousand volumes in      Greek, Latin, English, French, and Spanish; in divinity,      history, antiquity, philosophy, husbandry, and all polite      literature: and especially many curious travels and voyages;      and many rare and valuable pamphlets.\" This collection,      which is divided into _two parts_ (the first containing 3451      articles, the second 3442), is well worthy of being      consulted by the theologian, who is writing upon any      controverted point of divinity: there are articles in it of      the rarest occurrence. The singular character of its owner      and of his works is well known: he was at once the friend      and the opponent of Locke and Clarke, who were both anxious      for the conversion of a character of such strong, but      misguided, talents. The former, on his death-bed, wrote      Collins a letter to be delivered to him, after his decease,      which was full of affection and good advice.]       [Footnote 38: It is almost impossible to dwell on the memory      of this GREAT MAN without emotions of delight--whether we      consider him as an eminent physician, a friend to      literature, or a collector of books, pictures, and coins.      Benevolence, magnanimity, and erudition were the striking      features of his character: his house was the general      receptacle of men of genius and talent, and of every thing      beautiful, precious, or rare. His curiosities, whether      books, or coins, or pictures, were freely laid open to the      public; and the enterprising student, and experienced      antiquary, alike found amusement and a courteous reception.      He was known to all foreigners of intellectual distinction,      and corresponded both with the artisan and the potentate.      The great patron of literature, and the leader of his      profession (which he practised with a success unknown      before), it was hardly possible for unbefriended merit, if      properly introduced to him, to depart unrewarded. The      clergy, and in general, all men of learning, received his      advice _gratuitously_: and his doors were open every morning      to the _most indigent_, whom he frequently assisted with      money. Although his income, from his professional practice,      was very considerable, he died by no means a rich man--so      large were the sums which he devoted to the encouragement of      literature and the fine arts!       The sale of Dr. Mead's _books_ commenced on the 18th of      November, 1754, and again on the 7th of April, 1755: lasting      together 57 days. The sale of the _prints_ and _drawings_      continued 14 nights. The _gems_, _bronzes_, _busts_, and      _antiquities_, 8 days.

The _Spira Virgil_ of 1470, _Pfintzing's      Tewrkdrancs_, 1527, _Brandt's Stultifera Navis_, 1498, and      the _Aldine Petrarch_ of 1501, ALL UPON VELLUM. The large      paper _Olivet's Cicero_ was purchased by Dr. Askew for £14      14_s._ and was sold again at his sale for £36 15_s._ The      King of France bought the editio princeps of _Pliny Senr._      for £11 11_s._; and Mr. Willock, a bookseller, bought the      magnificently illuminated _Pliny by Jenson_ of 1472, for £18      18_s._: of which Maittaire has said so many fine things. The      _French_ books, and all the works upon the _Fine Arts_, were      of the first rarity, and value, and bound in a sumptuous      manner. Winstanley's _Prospects of Audley End_ brought £50.      An amusing account of some of the pictures will be found in      Mr. Beloe's \"_Anecdotes of Literature and Scarce Books_,\"      vol. i. 166. 71. But consult also _Nichol's Anecdotes of      Bowyer_, p. 225, &c. Of the catalogue of Dr. Mead's books      there were only six copies printed on LARGE PAPER. See Bibl.      Lort, no. 1149.]  The years 1755-6 were singularly remarkable for the mortality excited by the BIBLIOMANIA; and the well known names of Folkes,[39] and Rawlinson,[40] might have supplied a modern Holbein a hint for the introduction of a new subject in the \"_Dance of Death_.\" The close of George the Second's reign witnessed another instance of the fatality of this disease. Henley[41] \"bawled till he was hoarse\" against the cruelty of its attack; while his library has informed posterity how severely and how mortally he suffered from it.
