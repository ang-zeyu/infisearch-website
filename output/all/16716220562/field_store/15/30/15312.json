THE DINNER PARTY.  _Problem._--\"The Governor of Kgovjni wants to give a very small dinner party, and invites his father's brother-in-law, his brother's father-in-law, his father-in-law's brother, and his brother-in-law's father. Find the number of guests.\"  _Answer._--\"One.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In this genealogy, males are denoted by capitals, and females by small letters.

Of these, one is wrong, GALANTHUS NIVALIS MAJOR, who insists on inviting _two_ guests, one being the Governor's _wife's brother's father_. If she had taken his _sister's husband's father_ instead, she would have found it possible to reduce the guests to _one_.  Of the nine who send right answers, SEA-BREEZE is the very faintest breath that ever bore the name! She simply states that the Governor's uncle might fulfill all the conditions \"by intermarriages\"! \"Wind of the western sea,\" you have had a very narrow escape! Be thankful to appear in the Class-list at all! BOG-OAK and BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE use genealogies which require 16 people instead of 14, by inviting the Governor's _father's sister's husband_ instead of his _father's wife's brother_. I cannot think this so good a solution as one that requires only 14. CAIUS and VALENTINE deserve special mention as the only two who have supplied genealogies.   CLASS LIST.  I.     BEE.    CAIUS.

THE LODGINGS.  _Problem._--\"A Square has 20 doors on each side, which contains 21 equal parts. They are numbered all round, beginning at one corner. From which of the four, Nos. 9, 25, 52, 73, is the sum of the distances, to the other three, least?\"  _Answer._--\"From No. 9.\"         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration]  Let A be No. 9, B No. 25, C No. 52, and D No. 73.     Then AB = [** sqrt](12^{2} + 5^{2}) = [** sqrt]169 = 13;    AC = 21;    AD = [** sqrt](9^{2} + 8^{2}) = [** sqrt]145 = 12+    (N.B. _i.e._ \"between 12 and 13.\")    BC = [** sqrt](16^{2} + 12^{2}) = [** sqrt]400 = 20;    BD = [** sqrt](3^{2} + 21^{2}) = [** sqrt]450 = 21+;    CD = [** sqrt](9^{2} + 13^{2}) = [** sqrt]250 = 15+;   Hence sum of distances from A is between 46 and 47; from B, between 54 and 55; from C, between 56 and 57; from D, between 48 and 51. (Why not \"between 48 and 49\"? Make this out for yourselves.) Hence the sum is least for A.         *       *       *       *       *  Twenty-five solutions have been received. Of these, 15 must be marked \"0,\" 5 are partly right, and 5 right. Of the 15, I may dismiss ALPHABETICAL PHANTOM, BOG-OAK, DINAH MITE, FIFEE, GALANTHUS NIVALIS MAJOR (I fear the cold spring has blighted our SNOWDROP), GUY, H.M.S. PINAFORE, JANET, and VALENTINE with the simple remark that they insist on the unfortunate lodgers _keeping to the pavement_. (I used the words \"crossed to Number Seventy-three\" for the special purpose of showing that _short cuts_ were possible.) SEA-BREEZE does the same, and adds that \"the result would be the same\" even if they crossed the Square, but gives no proof of this. M. M. draws a diagram, and says that No. 9 is the house, \"as the diagram shows.\" I cannot see _how_ it does so. OLD CAT assumes that the house _must_ be No. 9 or No. 73. She does not explain how she estimates the distances. BEE's Arithmetic is faulty: she makes [** sqrt]169 + [** sqrt]442 + [** sqrt]130 = 741. (I suppose you mean [** sqrt]741, which would be a little nearer the truth. But roots cannot be added in this manner. Do you think [** sqrt]9 + [** sqrt]16 is 25, or even [** sqrt]25?) But AYR'S state is more perilous still: she draws illogical conclusions with a frightful calmness. After pointing out (rightly) that AC is less than BD she says, \"therefore the nearest house to the other three must be A or C.\" And again, after pointing out (rightly) that B and D are both within the half-square containing A, she says \"therefore\" AB + AD must be less than BC + CD. (There is no logical force in either \"therefore.\" For the first, try Nos. 1, 21, 60, 70: this will make your premiss true, and your conclusion false. Similarly, for the second, try Nos. 1, 30, 51, 71.)  Of the five partly-right solutions, RAGS AND TATTERS and MAD HATTER (who send one answer between them) make No. 25 6 units from the corner instead of 5. CHEAM, E. R. D. L., and MEGGY POTTS leave openings at the corners of the Square, which are not in the _data_: moreover CHEAM gives values for the distances without any hint that they are only _approximations_. CROPHI AND MOPHI make the bold and unfounded assumption that there were really 21 houses on each side, instead of 20 as stated by Balbus. \"We may assume,\" they add, \"that the doors of Nos. 21, 42, 63, 84, are invisible from the centre of the Square\"! What is there, I wonder, that CROPHI AND MOPHI would _not_ assume?  Of the five who are wholly right, I think BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE, CAIUS, CLIFTON C., and MARTREB deserve special praise for their full _analytical_ solutions. MATTHEW MATTICKS picks out No. 9, and proves it to be the right house in two ways, very neatly and ingeniously, but _why_ he picks it out does not appear. It is an excellent _synthetical_ proof, but lacks the analysis which the other four supply.   CLASS LIST.  I.     BRADSHAW OF THE FUTURE    CAIUS.    CLIFTON C.    MARTREB.  II.  MATTHEW MATTICKS.

A remonstrance has reached me from SCRUTATOR on the subject of KNOT I., which he declares was \"no problem at all.\" \"Two questions,\" he says, \"are put. To solve one there is no data: the other answers itself.\" As to the first point, SCRUTATOR is mistaken; there _are_ (not \"is\") data sufficient to answer the question. As to the other, it is interesting to know that the question \"answers itself,\" and I am sure it does the question great credit: still I fear I cannot enter it on the list of winners, as this competition is only open to human beings.   ANSWERS TO KNOT III.  _Problem._--(1) \"Two travellers, starting at the same time, went opposite ways round a circular railway. Trains start each way every 15 minutes, the easterly ones going round in 3 hours, the westerly in 2. How many trains did each meet on the way, not counting trains met at the terminus itself?\" (2) \"They went round, as before, each traveller counting as 'one' the train containing the other traveller. How many did each meet?\"  _Answers._--(1) 19. (2) The easterly traveller met 12; the other 8.         *       *       *       *       *  The trains one way took 180 minutes, the other way 120. Let us take the L. C. M., 360, and divide the railway into 360 units. Then one set of trains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30 units; the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45 units. An easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first train it will meet: it does 2-5ths of this while the other does 3-5ths, and thus meets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round. A westerly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it will meet: it does 3-5ths of this while the other does 2-5ths, and thus meets it at the end of 18 units, and so all the way round. Hence if the railway be divided, by 19 posts, into 20 parts, each containing 18 units, trains meet at every post, and, in (1), each traveller passes 19 posts in going round, and so meets 19 trains. But, in (2), the easterly traveller only begins to count after traversing 2-5ths of the journey, _i.e._, on reaching the 8th post, and so counts 12 posts: similarly the other counts 8. They meet at the end of 2-5ths of 3 hours, or 3-5ths of 2 hours, _i.e._, 72 minutes.         *       *       *       *       *  Forty-five answers have been received. Of these 12 are beyond the reach of discussion, as they give no working. I can but enumerate their names. ARDMORE, E. A., F. A. D., L. D., MATTHEW MATTICKS, M. E. T., POO-POO, and THE RED QUEEN are all wrong. BETA and ROWENA have got (1) right and (2) wrong. CHEEKY BOB and NAIRAM give the right answers, but it may perhaps make the one less cheeky, and induce the other to take a less inverted view of things, to be informed that, if this had been a competition for a prize, they would have got no marks. [N.B.--I have not ventured to put E. A.'s name in full, as she only gave it provisionally, in case her answer should prove right.]  Of the 33 answers for which the working is given, 10 are wrong; 11 half-wrong and half-right; 3 right, except that they cherish the delusion that it was _Clara_ who travelled in the easterly train--a point which the data do not enable us to settle; and 9 wholly right.  The 10 wrong answers are from BO-PEEP, FINANCIER, I. W. T., KATE B., M. A. H., Q. Y. Z., SEA-GULL, THISTLEDOWN, TOM-QUAD, and an unsigned one. BO-PEEP rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which started during the 3 hours of her trip, as well as all which started during the previous 2 hours, _i.e._, all which started at the commencements of 20 periods of 15 minutes each; and she is right in striking out the one she met at the moment of starting; but wrong in striking out the _last_ train, for she did not meet this at the terminus, but 15"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29046"],["title","The Heads of Apex (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:      This etext was produced from Astounding Stories October 1931.

It was the advertising section of the _New York Times_. Apathetically, he picked it up, knowing from the past weeks' experience that few or no jobs were being advertised. Then with a start he sat up, for in the center of the page, encased in a small box and printed in slightly larger type than the ordinary advertisement, he read the following words: \"Wanted: Soldier of Fortune, young, healthy; must have good credentials. Apply 222 Reuter Place, between two and four.\" It was to-day's advertising section he was scanning, and the hour not yet one.  Reuter Place was some distance away, he knew, a good hour's walk on hard pavement and through considerable heat. But he had made forced marches in Sonora as badly shod and on even an emptier stomach. For Justus Miles, though he might not have looked it, was a bona fide soldier of fortune, stranded in New York. Five feet eight in height, he was, loose and rangy in build, and with deceptively mild blue eyes. He had fought through the World War, served under Kemal Pasha in Turkey, helped the Riffs in Morocco, filibustered in South America and handled a machine-gun for revolutionary forces in Mexico. Surely, he thought grimly, if anyone could fill the bill for a soldier of fortune it was himself.  222 Reuter Place proved to be a large residence in a shabby neighborhood. On the sidewalk, a queue of men was being held in line by a burly cop. The door of the house opened, and an individual, broad-shouldered and with flaming red hair, looked over the crowd. Instantly Justus Miles let out a yell, \"Rusty! By God, Rusty!\" and waved his hands.  \"Hey, feller, who do you think you're shovin'?\" growled a hard-looking fellow at the head of the line, but Justus Miles paid no attention to him. The man in the doorway also let out an excited yell.  \"Well, well, if it isn't the Kid! Hey, Officer, let that fellow through: I want to speak to him.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With the door shut on the blasphemous mob, the two men wrung each other's hands. Ex-Sergeant Harry Ward, known to his intimates as \"Rusty,\" led Justus Miles into a large office and shoved him into a chair.  \"I didn't know you were in New York, kid. The last I saw of you was when we quit Sandino.\"  \"And I never suspected that 222 Reuter Place would be you, Rusty. What's the lay, old man, and is there any chance to connect?\"  \"You bet your life there's a chance. Three hundred a month and found. But the boss has the final say-so, though I'm sure he'll take you on my recommendation.\"  He opened a door, led Justus Miles through an inner room, knocked at a far door and ushered him into the presence of a man who sat behind a roll-topped desk. There was something odd about this old man, and after a moment's inspection Justus Miles saw what it was. He was evidently a cripple, propped up in a strange wheelchair. He had an abnormally large and hairless head, and his body was muffled to the throat in a voluminous cloak, the folds of which fell over and enveloped most of the wheelchair itself. The face of this old gentleman--though the features were finely molded--was swarthy: its color was almost that of a negro--or an Egyptian. He regarded the two men with large and peculiarly colored eyes--eyes that probed them sharply.  \"Well, Ward, what is it?\"  \"The man you advertised for, Mr. Solino.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Solino regarded Justus Miles critically.  \"You have been a soldier of fortune?\" he asked. He spoke English with the preciseness of an educated foreigner.  \"Yes, sir. Rusty--that is, Mr. Ward knows my record.\"  \"I was his sergeant in France, sir; saw fighting with him in Morocco, Turkey, Nicaragua--\"  \"You can vouch for him, then; his character, courage--\"  \"You couldn't get a better man, sir. If I had known he was in town I would have sent for him.\"  \"Very well; that is sufficient. But Mr.--Miles did you say?--understands he is embarking on a dangerous adventure with grave chances of losing his life?\"  \"I have faced danger and risked my life before this,\" said Justus Miles quietly.  The other nodded. \"Then that is all I am prepared to tell you at this time.\"  Justus Miles accompanied Ward to his room where the latter laid out for him a change of clothing. It was luxurious to splash in warm water and bath-salts after the enforced griminess of weeks. The clothes fitted him fairly well, the two men being of a size. Lounging in his friend's room after a substantial meal, and smoking a Turkish cigarette, he questioned Ward more closely.  \"Who is the old fellow?\"  \"I don't know. He hired me through an advertisement and then set me to employing others.\"  \"But surely you know where we are going?\"  \"Hardly more than you do. Solino did say there was a country, a city to be invaded. Whereabouts is a secret. I can't say I care for going it blind, but neither do I like starving to death. I was in about the same shape you were when you applied. Desperate.\"  Justus Miles stretched himself comfortably.  \"A spiggoty by the looks of him,\" he said; \"negro blood, no doubt. Well, fighting's my trade. I'd rather cash in fighting than sit on a park bench. I suppose the old boy will tell us more in good time, and until then we're sitting pretty, with good eats to be had; so why worry?\"  And yet if Justus Miles had been able to look ahead he might not have talked so blithely.         *       *       *       *       *  During the week that followed his employment, he saw nothing of Solino, though Ward met the old man for a few moments every day to receive his instructions. \"It puzzles me,\" he confessed to Miles, \"how the old chap lives. There's a private exit to the street from his rooms, but I could swear he never goes out. How could he in that wheelchair--no attendant. And yet he must. How would he get food?\"  Justus Miles smiled lazily. \"No mystery at all, Rusty. We're gone for hours at a time. What's to prevent him from phoning to have his meals brought in?\"  \"But I've questioned them at the restaurant and they say--\"  \"Good Lord!--is there only one restaurant in Manhattan?\"  Yet Justus Miles himself could not help feeling there was something mysterious about Solino, but just how mysterious he did not realize--until, one evening, he stood with a half dozen of his fellow adventurers in a lonely spot on the Long Island coast and watched the darkness deepen around them. \"We shall wait,\" said Solino presently, \"until the moon comes up.\"  The moon rose at about nine o'clock, flooding the beach and the heaving expanse of water with a ghostly light. From the folds of Solino's cloak, close about his muffled throat, a peculiar ray of green light flashed out over the water. In answer, a green light flashed back, and presently, something low and black, like the body of a whale half submerged, stole towards the beach. Scarcely a ripple marked its progress, and the nose of it slid up on the sand. \"Good Lord!\" whispered Miles, grasping Ward by the arm: \"it's a submarine!\"  But the craft on which the surprised soldiers of fortune gazed was not an ordinary submarine. In the first place, there was no conning tower; and, in the second, from the blunt nose projected a narrow gangway bridging the few feet of water between the mysterious craft and the dry beach. But the men had little time to indulge in amazement. \"Quick,\" said Solino; \"load those boxes onto the gangway. No need to carry them further.\" He himself wheeled his chair into the interior of the submarine, calling back, \"Hurry, hurry!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The adventurers accomplished the loading in a few minutes. \"Now,\" came the voice of their employer, \"stand on the gangway yourselves. Steady; don't move.\"  Under their feet they felt the gangway vibrate and withdraw from the land. For a moment they were in utter darkness; then a light flashed up and revealed a long, box-like room. The opening through which they had come had closed, leaving no sign of its existence.  In the center of the room stood a mechanism like a huge gyroscope, and a plunging piston, smooth and black, went up and down with frictionless ease. In front of what was evidently a control board sat a swarthy man with a large hairless head and peculiarly colored eyes. The adventurers stared in surprise, for this man, too, sat in a wheelchair, seemingly a cripple; but unlike Mr. Solino he wore no cloak, his body from the neck down being enclosed in a tubular metal container. The body must have been very small, and the legs amputated at the hips, since the container was not large and terminated on the seat of the peculiar wheel chair to which it seemed firmly attached.  Solino did not offer to introduce them to the man at the control board, who, aside from a quick look, paid them no attention. He ushered them ahead into another, though smaller cabin, and after indicating certain arrangements made for their comfort, withdrew. From the slight sway of the floor under their feet and the perceptible vibration of the craft, the adventurers knew they were under way.  \"Well, this is a rum affair and no mistake about it,\" said one of them.  \"A freak--a bloomin' freak,\" remarked another whose cockney accent proclaimed the Englishman.  \"Yuh're shore right,\" said a lean Texan. \"That hombre out there had no legs."]]]
