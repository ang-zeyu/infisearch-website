And you were infantine      When first I met you; why, your hair fell loose      On either side!  My fool's-cheek reddens now      Only in the recalling how it burned      That morn to see the shape of many a dream      --You know we boys are prodigal of charms      To her we dream of--I had heard of one,      Had dreamed of her, and I was close to her,      Might speak to her, might live and die her own,      Who knew?  I spoke.  Oh, Mildred, feel you not      That now, while I remember every glance      Of yours, each word of yours, with power to test      And weigh them in the diamond scales of pride,      Resolved the treasure of a first and last      Heart's love shall have been bartered at its worth,      --That now I think upon your purity      And utter ignorance of guilt--your own      Or other's guilt--the girlish undisguised      Delight at a strange novel prize--(I talk      A silly language, but interpret, you!)      If I, with fancy at its full, and reason      Scarce in its germ, enjoined you secrecy,      If you had pity on my passion, pity      On my protested sickness of the soul      To sit beside you, hear you breathe, and watch      Your eyelids and the eyes beneath--if you      Accorded gifts and knew not they were gifts--      If I grew mad at last with enterprise      And must behold my beauty in her bower      Or perish--(I was ignorant of even      My own desires--what then were you?) if sorrow--      Sin--if the end came--must I now renounce      My reason, blind myself to light, say truth      Is false and lie to God and my own soul?      Contempt were all of this!       MILDRED.                    Do you believe...      Or, Henry, I'll not wrong you--you believe      That I was ignorant.  I scarce grieve o'er      The past.  We'll love on; you will love me still.       MERTOUN.  Oh, to love less what one has injured!  Dove,      Whose pinion I have rashly hurt, my breast--      Shall my heart's warmth not nurse thee into strength?      Flower I have crushed, shall I not care for thee?      Bloom o'er my crest, my fight-mark and device!      Mildred, I love you and you love me.       MILDRED.                              Go!      Be that your last word.  I shall sleep to-night.       MERTOUN.  This is not our last meeting?       MILDRED.                                 One night more.       MERTOUN.  And then--think, then!       MILDRED.                          Then, no sweet courtship-days,      No dawning consciousness of love for us,      No strange and palpitating births of sense      From words and looks, no innocent fears and hopes,      Reserves and confidences:  morning's over!       MERTOUN.  How else should love's perfected noontide follow?      All the dawn promised shall the day perform.       MILDRED.  So may it be! but--                                     You are cautious, Love?      Are sure that unobserved you scaled the walls?       MERTOUN.  Oh, trust me!  Then our final meeting's fixed      To-morrow night?       MILDRED.          Farewell! stay, Henry... wherefore?      His foot is on the yew-tree bough; the turf      Receives him:  now the moonlight as he runs      Embraces him--but he must go--is gone.      Ah, once again he turns--thanks, thanks, my Love!      He's gone.  Oh, I'll believe him every word!      I was so young, I loved him so, I had      No mother, God forgot me, and I fell.      There may be pardon yet:  all's doubt beyond!      Surely the bitterness of death is past.     ACT II            SCENE.--The Library            Enter LORD TRESHAM, hastily       TRESHAM.  This way!  In, Gerard, quick!           [As GERARD enters, TRESHAM secures the door.]                                               Now speak! or, wait--      I'll bid you speak directly.           [Seats himself.]                                    Now repeat      Firmly and circumstantially the tale      You just now told me; it eludes me; either      I did not listen, or the half is gone      Away from me.  How long have you lived here?      Here in my house, your father kept our woods      Before you?       GERARD.      --As his father did, my lord.      I have been eating, sixty years almost,      Your bread.       TRESHAM.  Yes, yes.  You ever were of all      The servants in my father's house, I know,      The trusted one.  You'll speak the truth.       GERARD.                                    I'll speak      God's truth.  Night after night...       TRESHAM.                            Since when?       GERARD.                                          At least      A month--each midnight has some man access      To Lady Mildred's chamber.       TRESHAM.                    Tush, \"access\"--      No wide words like \"access\" to me!       GERARD.                             He runs      Along the woodside, crosses to the South,      Takes the left tree that ends the avenue...       TRESHAM.  The last great yew-tree?       GERARD.                             You might stand upon      The main boughs like a platform.  Then he...       TRESHAM.                                      Quick!       GERARD.  Climbs up, and, where they lessen at the top,      --I cannot see distinctly, but he throws,      I think--for this I do not vouch--a line      That reaches to the lady's casement--       TRESHAM.                               --Which      He enters not!  Gerard, some wretched fool      Dares pry into my sister's privacy!      When such are young, it seems a precious thing      To have approached,--to merely have approached,      Got sight of the abode of her they set      Their frantic thoughts upon.  Ha does not enter?      Gerard?       GERARD.  There is a lamp that's full i' the midst.      Under a red square in the painted glass      Of Lady Mildred's...       TRESHAM.              Leave that name out!  Well?      That lamp?       GERARD.  Is moved at midnight higher up      To one pane--a small dark-blue pane; he waits      For that among the boughs:  at sight of that,      I see him, plain as I see you, my lord,      Open the lady's casement, enter there...       TRESHAM.  --And stay?       GERARD.                An hour, two hours.       TRESHAM.                                    And this you saw      Once?--twice?--quick!       GERARD.                Twenty times.       TRESHAM.                              And what brings you      Under the yew-trees?       GERARD.               The first night I left      My range so far, to track the stranger stag      That broke the pale, I saw the man.       TRESHAM.                             Yet sent      No cross-bow shaft through the marauder?       GERARD.                                   But      He came, my lord, the first time he was seen,      In a great moonlight, light as any day,      FROM Lady Mildred's chamber.       TRESHAM [after a pause].      You have no cause      --Who could have cause to do my sister wrong?       GERARD.  Oh, my lord, only once--let me this once      Speak what is on my mind!  Since first I noted      All this, I've groaned as if a fiery net      Plucked me this way and that--fire if I turned      To her, fire if I turned to you, and fire      If down I flung myself and strove to die.      The lady could not have been seven years old      When I was trusted to conduct her safe      Through the deer-herd to stroke the snow-white fawn      I brought to eat bread from her tiny hand      Within a month.  She ever had a smile      To greet me with--she... if it could undo      What's done, to lop each limb from off this trunk...      All that is foolish talk, not fit for you--      I mean, I could not speak and bring her hurt      For Heaven's compelling.  But when I was fixed      To hold my peace, each morsel of your food      Eaten beneath your roof, my birth-place too,      Choked me.  I wish I had grown mad in doubts      What it behoved me do.  This morn it seemed      Either I must confess to you or die:      Now it is done, I seem the vilest worm      That crawls, to have betrayed my lady.       TRESHAM.                                No--      No, Gerard!       GERARD.      Let me go!       TRESHAM.                 A man, you say:      What man?  Young?  Not a vulgar hind?  What dress?       GERARD.  A slouched hat and a large dark foreign cloak      Wraps his whole form; even his face is hid;      But I should judge him young:  no hind, be sure!       TRESHAM.  Why?       GERARD.         He is ever armed:  his sword projects      Beneath the cloak.       TRESHAM.            Gerard,--I will not say      No word, no breath of this!       GERARD.                      Thank, thanks, my lord!           [Goes.]       TRESHAM [paces the room.  After a pause].      Oh, thoughts absurd!--as with some monstrous fact      Which, when ill thoughts beset us, seems to give      Merciful God that made the sun and stars,      The waters and the green delights of earth,      The lie!  I apprehend the monstrous fact--      Yet know the maker of all worlds is good,      And yield my reason up, inadequate      To reconcile what yet I do behold--      Blasting my sense!  There's cheerful day outside:      This is my library, and this the chair      My father used to sit in carelessly      After his soldier-fashion, while I stood      Between his knees to question him:  and here      Gerard our grey retainer,--as he says,      Fed with our food, from sire to son, an age,--      Has told a story--I am to believe!      That Mildred... oh, no, no! both tales are true,      Her pure cheek's story and the forester's!      Would she, or could she, err--much less, confound      All guilts of treachery, of craft, of... Heaven      Keep me within its hand!--I will sit here      Until thought settle and I see my course.      Avert, oh God, only this woe from me!           [As he sinks his head between his arms on the table,            GUENDOLEN'S voice is heard at the door.]       Lord Tresham!   "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2880"],["title","A Blot in the 'Scutcheon (#4)"],["body","         [She knocks.]                     Is Lord Tresham there?            [TRESHAM, hastily turning, pulls down the first book            above him and opens it.]       TRESHAM.                               Come in!           [She enters.]      Ha, Guendolen!--good morning.       GUENDOLEN.                     Nothing more?       TRESHAM.  What should I say more?       GUENDOLEN.  Pleasant question! more?      This more.  Did I besiege poor Mildred's brain      Last night till close on morning with \"the Earl,\"      \"The Earl\"--whose worth did I asseverate      Till I am very fain to hope that... Thorold,      What is all this?  You are not well!       TRESHAM.                              Who, I?      You laugh at me.       GUENDOLEN.        Has what I'm fain to hope,      Arrived then?  Does that huge tome show some blot      In the Earl's 'scutcheon come no longer back      Than Arthur's time?       TRESHAM.             When left you Mildred's chamber?       GUENDOLEN.  Oh, late enough, I told you!  The main thing      To ask is, how I left her chamber,--sure,      Content yourself, she'll grant this paragon      Of Earls no such ungracious...       TRESHAM.                        Send her here!       GUENDOLEN.  Thorold?       TRESHAM.              I mean--acquaint her, Guendolen,      --But mildly!       GUENDOLEN.     Mildly?       TRESHAM.                Ah, you guessed aright!      I am not well:  there is no hiding it.      But tell her I would see her at her leisure--      That is, at once! here in the library!      The passage in that old Italian book      We hunted for so long is found, say, found--      And if I let it slip again... you see,      That she must come--and instantly!       GUENDOLEN.                          I'll die      Piecemeal, record that, if there have not gloomed      Some blot i' the 'scutcheon!       TRESHAM.                      Go! or, Guendolen,      Be you at call,--With Austin, if you choose,--      In the adjoining gallery!  There go!           [GUENDOLEN goes.]      Another lesson to me!  You might bid      A child disguise his heart's sore, and conduct      Some sly investigation point by point      With a smooth brow, as well as bid me catch      The inquisitorial cleverness some praise.      If you had told me yesterday, \"There's one      You needs must circumvent and practise with,      Entrap by policies, if you would worm      The truth out:  and that one is--Mildred!\"  There,      There--reasoning is thrown away on it!      Prove she's unchaste... why, you may after prove      That she's a poisoner, traitress, what you will!      Where I can comprehend nought, nought's to say,      Or do, or think.  Force on me but the first      Abomination,--then outpour all plagues,      And I shall ne'er make count of them.            Enter MILDRED       MILDRED.                               What book      Is it I wanted, Thorold?  Guendolen      Thought you were pale; you are not pale.  That book?      That's Latin surely.       TRESHAM.              Mildred, here's a line,      (Don't lean on me:  I'll English it for you)      \"Love conquers all things.\"  What love conquers them?      What love should you esteem--best love?       MILDRED.                                 True love.       TRESHAM.  I mean, and should have said, whose love is best      Of all that love or that profess to love?       MILDRED.      The list's so long:  there's father's, mother's, husband's...       TRESHAM.  Mildred, I do believe a brother's love      For a sole sister must exceed them all.      For see now, only see! there's no alloy      Of earth that creeps into the perfect'st gold      Of other loves--no gratitude to claim;      You never gave her life, not even aught      That keeps life--never tended her, instructed,      Enriched her--so, your love can claim no right      O'er her save pure love's claim:  that's what I call      Freedom from earthliness.  You'll never hope      To be such friends, for instance, she and you,      As when you hunted cowslips in the woods,      Or played together in the meadow hay.      Oh yes--with age, respect comes, and your worth      Is felt, there's growing sympathy of tastes,      There's ripened friendship, there's confirmed esteem:      --Much head these make against the newcomer!      The startling apparition, the strange youth--      Whom one half-hour's conversing with, or, say,      Mere gazing at, shall change (beyond all change      This Ovid ever sang about) your soul     ...Her soul, that is,--the sister's soul!  With her      'Twas winter yesterday; now, all is warmth,      The green leaf's springing and the turtle's voice,      \"Arise and come away!\"  Come whither?--far      Enough from the esteem, respect, and all      The brother's somewhat insignificant      Array of rights!  All which he knows before,      Has calculated on so long ago!      I think such love, (apart from yours and mine,)      Contented with its little term of life,      Intending to retire betimes, aware      How soon the background must be placed for it,      --I think, am sure, a brother's love exceeds      All the world's love in its unworldliness.       MILDRED.  What is this for?       TRESHAM.                     This, Mildred, is it for!      Or, no, I cannot go to it so soon!      That's one of many points my haste left out--      Each day, each hour throws forth its silk-slight film      Between the being tied to you by birth,      And you, until those slender threads compose      A web that shrouds her daily life of hopes      And fears and fancies, all her life, from yours:      So close you live and yet so far apart!      And must I rend this web, tear up, break down      The sweet and palpitating mystery      That makes her sacred?  You--for you I mean,      Shall I speak, shall I not speak?       MILDRED.                           Speak!       TRESHAM.                                   I will.      Is there a story men could--any man      Could tell of you, you would conceal from me?      I'll never think there's falsehood on that lip.      Say \"There is no such story men could tell,\"      And I'll believe you, though I disbelieve      The world--the world of better men than I,      And women such as I suppose you.  Speak!           [After a pause.]      Not speak?  Explain then!  Clear it up then!  Move      Some of the miserable weight away      That presses lower than the grave.  Not speak?      Some of the dead weight, Mildred!  Ah, if I      Could bring myself to plainly make their charge      Against you!  Must I, Mildred?  Silent still?           [After a pause.]      Is there a gallant that has night by night      Admittance to your chamber?           [After a pause.]                                   Then, his name!      Till now, I only had a thought for you:      But now,--his name!       MILDRED.  Thorold, do you devise      Fit expiation for my guilt, if fit      There be!  'Tis nought to say that I'll endure      And bless you,--that my spirit yearns to purge      Her stains off in the fierce renewing fire:      But do not plunge me into other guilt!      Oh, guilt enough!  I cannot tell his name.       TRESHAM.  Then judge yourself!  How should I act?  Pronounce!       MILDRED.  Oh, Thorold, you must never tempt me thus!      To die here in this chamber by that sword      Would seem like punishment:  so should I glide,      Like an arch-cheat, into extremest bliss!      'Twere easily arranged for me:  but you--      What would become of you?       TRESHAM.                   And what will now      Become of me?  I'll hide your shame and mine      From every eye; the dead must heave their hearts      Under the marble of our chapel-floor;      They cannot rise and blast you.  You may wed      Your paramour above our mother's tomb;      Our mother cannot move from 'neath your foot.      We too will somehow wear this one day out:      But with to-morrow hastens here--the Earl!      The youth without suspicion.  Face can come      From Heaven and heart from... whence proceed such hearts?      I have dispatched last night at your command      A missive bidding him present himself      To-morrow--here--thus much is said; the rest      Is understood as if 'twere written down--      \"His suit finds favor in your eyes.\"  Now dictate      This morning's letter that shall countermand      Last night's--do dictate that!       MILDRED.                        But, Thorold--if      I will receive him as I said?       TRESHAM.                       The Earl?       MILDRED.  I will receive him.       TRESHAM [starting up].         Ho there!  Guendolen!           GUENDOLEN and AUSTIN enter      And, Austin, you are welcome, too!  Look there!      The woman there!       AUSTIN and GUENDOLEN.  How?  Mildred?       TRESHAM.                               Mildred once!      Now the receiver night by night, when sleep      Blesses the inmates of her father's house,      --I say, the soft sly wanton that receives      Her guilt's accomplice 'neath this roof which holds      You, Guendolen, you, Austin, and has held      A thousand Treshams--never one like her!      No lighter of the signal-lamp her quick      Foul breath near quenches in hot eagerness      To mix with breath as foul! no loosener      O' the lattice, practised in the stealthy tread,      The low voice and the noiseless come-and-go!      Not one composer of the bacchant's mien      Into--what you thought Mildred's, in a word!      Know her!       GUENDOLEN.  Oh, Mildred, look to me, at least!      Thorold--she's dead, I'd say, but that she stands      Rigid as stone and whiter!       TRESHAM.                    You have heard...       GUENDOLEN.  Too much!  You must proceed no further.
