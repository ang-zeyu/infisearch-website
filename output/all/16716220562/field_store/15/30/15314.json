And as for outside attacks, the laboratories are insulated against any the insurgent workers can make. Their weapons are poor--the green men use but clubs. No, it is not their attacks we fear but their refusal to furnish us with supplies. They worshipped us as gods, and the giving of supplies was long a religious rite. But now they doubt our divinity, and, since they no longer listen to or obey our decrees, we have no means of punishing them. Spiro is responsible for this.\"  \"Spiro?\" questioned the two men.  \"He whom we raised to the dignity of godhead on the accidental death of Bah-koo, causing a deep sleep to fall upon him in the temple and grafting his head upon the mechanical body left by the latter. Twice before we had done this with citizens of Apex, and how were we to know that Spiro would resent it? True, he was in love with Ah-eeda, but the physical passions of men die with the organisms that give them birth. For three years he dwelt with us in the laboratories, learning the wisdom of the Heads, and then,\"--Zoro's face became forbidding--\"he denounced us to the people. Though there was more or less discontent, they would never have dared defy us save for him. He told them that our curses could do no harm, that we were merely the heads of men like himself and would die if they refused to give us the wherewithal to renew blood.         *       *       *       *       *  \"But this refusal of theirs is an evil thing,\" he cried, looking at the Americans with his strangely colored eyes. \"It violates the custom of ages, and strikes at the very roots of our existence. So we held council and sent two of our number to Earth after men and weapons to enforce our demands. For years we had watched Earth, seen its myriad civilizations rise and fall, studied the coming of America to power and importance. So it was to America that Solino went, by way of the tunnel that still exists under the Atlantic--\"  \"And hired us,\" interrupted Ward, \"and brought us to the tunnel in the submarine-car where we--\"  \"Stepped into the crystal chamber,\" finished Zoro. \"That chamber is a re-vibrating device of certain rays and chemicals. The shutting of the door closed the switches and hurled your bodies to where a receiving-station on this plane integrated them again.\"  So they were not at the bottom of the ocean. They were--stupendous thought--living in a new world of matter!  \"Spiro suspected our plans,\" continued Zoro. \"He isolated us in our laboratories, and, by means of a crystal tube, went through to the tunnel, tore up a section of track, and wrecked the submarine-car. But his act was only partially successful. You two escaped death; you are here; you are ready to keep faith and fight in our service.\"  \"We are ready to fight,\" assented Miles and Ward. The situation was certainly an unusual one, and one they did not clearly understand; but theirs was the simple code of the mercenary soldier--they would fight for whoever hired them, and be loyal as long as their wages were paid.  \"Then there is no time to lose,\" exclaimed Zoro. \"Already our blood grows thin. You must go back to the wrecked submarine and retrieve your weapons.\"  \"But how?\"  \"There is a sending tube in the next compartment.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They followed Zoro through lofty rooms filled with amber light until they came to one wherein were assembled the rest of the Heads. Zoro spoke to them swiftly in a strange, flowing tongue. Then he conducted the two Americans to a crystal chamber at the end of the room and bade them enter it. The vibrant light caressed their limbs.  \"When I close this door,\" he said, \"you will find yourselves back in the tunnel. Board one of the submarine-cars on the siding and proceed to the wreck.\" He gave them detailed instructions how to operate the car. \"Then get your weapons and return. Do you understand?\"  They nodded.  \"The workers possess no arms the equal of machine-guns and bombs. They will be at your mercy. Remember that you are fighting for our lives and that, if you save them, your reward will be great. Fear nothing.\"  The door closed. After a moment there was a blinding flash, a moment of swooning darkness, and then they were staring through transparent walls into the phosphorescent gloom of the underseas crypt. Suddenly, what they had recently undergone seemed the product of an illusion, a dream. Ward shook himself vigorously. \"I guess it was real enough,\" he said. \"Let us see if the car works.\"  They ran out to the wreck and returned without trouble. The machine-gun was mounted for action and the gas-bombs slung over their shoulders in convenient bags. \"All right,\" said Miles tensely, \"let us go.\"  Again they entered the crystal chamber; again there was the flash of light and the sensation of falling into darkest space. Then, in a moment it seemed, they were stepping into the hall from which they had fled pursued by the green men--only for the second time, to be confronted by a crowd of hostile giants. \"Don't fire, Kid!\" yelled Ward. \"It's no use to kill them uselessly. Give them the bombs!\"  Disconcerted by the attack of tear-gas, the green men broke and fled. \"After them,\" panted Ward: \"we've got them on the run!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Thrilling to the lust of battle, the two Americans emerged into an open square. They had little time to note the odd buildings and strange statues. Coming towards them with leveled weapons, the nature of which they did not know, was a band of short men--that is, short in comparison with the greenish giants. Behind this company appeared still another, and another. Tear-gas was useless to stop their onward rush. \"All right,\" yelled Miles, \"it's lead they want!\"  The machine-gun spat a hail of bullets. Before the first withering blast the swarthy men recoiled in confusion. Then a second volley scattered them like chaff. Miles and Ward were conscious of no pity for the dead and wounded lying on the pavement of yellow stone. This was their profession, the stern business of which they were masters. In France they had seen worse sights, and in Nicaragua and Mexico. They swept destructively out of the square and into a long tree-lined avenue. This might be another world or dimension but its trees looked not unlike those of tropical America.  In a short while the radiating streets were cleared of crowds and the cries of the mob died away. Miles and Ward paused in the shadow of an overhanging wall and wiped their faces. \"That was quick work, all right,\" said Ward; and, even as he said it, the wall seemed to fall upon their unprotected heads and crush them into unconsciousness....         *       *       *       *       *  Out of a sick darkness they came. At first they thought they were confronting Zoro. Then, as the mists of unconsciousness cleared from aching heads, they perceived that they were in a vast hall crowded with swarthy men in short tunics, and with greenish giants wearing nothing but breech-clouts and swinging short clubs. The fierce eyes of the greenish giants were upon them, and the vengeful ones of the swarthy men. But the desire of both to rend and tear was held in check by the dominant head emerging from a tubular container mounted upon a wheelchair. The Americans stared. This was not the head of Zoro. No!  \"The head of Spiro,\" thought Miles and Ward with sinking hearts.  They had fallen into the power of the leader of the insurgent workers!  Spiro--for it was indeed he--regarded them with pitiless eyes. His English was slower and not as fluent as that of Zoro, and his words harder to understand.  \"You Americans, beings of another world, have come here at the bidding of the Heads to slay and kill for gold.\"  He paused. \"I who for three years studied your country, learned its language, history, did not believe men of your race could be so vile.\"  He paused again, and Ward broke out hotly, \"It is true that we came here to fight for gold, but who are you to speak of vileness? Have you not turned on the Heads, your benefactors, now your brothers, who raised you to their height? Are you not leading a revolt of the workers which would deny them the means of sustaining life? Are you not seeking to perpetrate--murder?\"  Spiro regarded him slowly. \"Is it possible you are in ignorance of what those means are? Listen, then, while I tell you the hideous truth. Since the dawn of our history, until the present moment, the Heads have maintained their lives by draining blood from the veins of thousands of Apexans yearly!\"  The Americans' faces whitened. \"What do you mean?\" breathed Ward.  \"I mean that the artificial blood pumped by mechanical hearts through the brains of the Heads--yes, and that is now being pumped through my own!\" cried Spiro bitterly--\"is manufactured from human blood. Human blood is the basis of it. And to get that blood every Apexan must yield his quota in the temple. Slowly but surely this practice is sapping the vitality of the race. But though the Apexans realized this they were afraid to speak against the custom. For the Heads were worshipped as gods; and when the gods spoke, blasphemers died--horribly.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Miles and Ward shuddered.  \"Even I,\" went on Spiro, \"denounced blasphemers and thought it holy that each should yield a little of his blood to the Almighty Ones. Then I woke from darkness to find myself--a Head. At first I could not understand, for I was in love with Ah-eeda--and can a machine mate? But it is true that love is largely desire, and desire of the body. With the death of the body, desire died; and it may be that pride and ambition took its place. But, for all that, there were moments when I remembered my lost manhood and dreamed of Ah-eeda. Yes, though the laboratory of the Heads revealed wonders of which I had never dreamed, though I looked into your world and studied its languages and history, though I was worshipped as a god and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29046"],["title","The Heads of Apex (#4)"],["body","life stretched ahead of me--nevertheless, I could see that the strength of my race was being sapped, its virility lost!\"  His voice broke. \"In the face of such knowledge what were immortality and power? Could they compensate for one hour of life and love as humanity lived it? So I brooded. Then one day in the temple I looked into the face of a girl about to be bled and recognized Ah-eeda. In that moment, hatred of the fiends posing as gods and draining the vitality of deluded worshippers, crystallized and drove me to action. So it was I who denounced the Heads, aroused the people!\" Spiro's voice broke; died. Miles and Ward stared at him, horrified; and after a while Miles exclaimed, \"We never suspected! We would never have fought to maintain such a thing had we known!\"  \"Nonetheless,\" said Spiro inflexibly, \"you fought for it, and many people died and more are afraid. Superstition is a hard thing to kill. Already there are those who murmur that truly the Heads are gods and have called up demons from the underworld, as they threatened they would, to smite them with thunder until once more they yield blood in the temple. But I know that without blood the Heads must die miserably and the people be freed from their vampire existence. It is true that I too shall die, but that is nothing. I die gladly. Therefore, to keep the people from sacrificing blood, to show them that you are mortal and the Heads powerless to save the demons they have raised, you must be slain in front of the great palace.  \"Yes; you, too, must die for the people!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bound and helpless, lying on their backs and staring into the gloom of the small chamber into which they had been thrown, Miles and Ward had time to ponder their desperate situation. Spiro was delaying their death until the workers of Apex would have time to gather and witness it. At first they had struggled to loosen their bonds, but such efforts served only to tighten them. Then they had tried the trick of rolling together so that the fingers of one might endeavor to undo the knots securing the other. On a memorable occasion in Turkey they had freed themselves in this manner. But the attempts proved fruitless now. The floor of the chamber was smooth, nor could they find any rough projection on which to saw the cords.  Exhausted, they finally desisted. The same thought was in both minds: Were they doomed to die in this strange world, fated never to see Earth again? Well, a soldier of fortune must expect to meet with reverses. Still, it was a tough break. After a long silence Ward said, \"How were we to know that the heads lived on the blood of the people?\"  \"Would it have made any difference if we had known?\" asked Miles.  \"Perhaps not.\" Ward tried to shrug his shoulders. \"After all, we have fought to maintain systems not much better. There is little difference, save in degree, between draining the life-blood of a race and robbing it of the fruits of its labor.\"  \"But sometimes we fought to liberate people,\" protested Miles.  \"Yes, I like to think of that. It's good to have something to our credit when we cash in. And it looks,\" he said pessimistically, \"as if our time to do so has come.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They ceased talking. Time passed cheerlessly. Finally both of them fell into a heavy slumber from which they were aroused by the sudden flashing in their eyes of a bright light, bright only in comparison with the former intense darkness. \"What's that!\" cried Ward, startled.  \"S-sh,\" said a soft voice warningly, and when their eyes became accustomed to the illumination, they were amazed to perceive the slender form of a young girl carrying a torch. She was marvelously lovely to look at, with her blue-black hair brushed straight back from a low, broad forehead and her smooth skin as dark as that of an Egyptian. Nor was she dressed unlike pictures Miles had seen of people of ancient Egypt. The embroidered plates covering the small breasts shone and glittered; bracelets and bangles flashed on bare arms and shapely ankles; while from the waist to below the knees was a skirt of rich material. On the small feet were sandals of intricate design. Besides the torch, the girl carried a slim, gleaming knife, and for a moment the adventurers were guilty of imagining she had come to slay them where they lay. But her manner quickly dispelled their fear. Sinking on her knees beside them, she said, \"Do not be afraid; Ah-eeda will not harm you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  So this was Ah-eeda, the girl of whom Spiro had spoken. Miles and Ward devoured her loveliness with their eyes; her coming flooded their bosoms with renewed hope. She continued speaking. Her English was not at all fluent, and she was often compelled to make it clear with expressions in her own tongue and with explanatory gestures. But to Miles and Ward, who knew nothing of temple training, her speaking English at all was a miracle.  \"Is it true that you are men from another world?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And you came to make the people give their blood to the Heads?\"  \"No, that is not true. We were in ignorance of what it was we fought for. Had we known the truth we would have refused to fight for the Heads.\"  \"Then, if I were to set you free, you would go back to your own world and not fight my people any more?\"  They nodded vigorously.  \"Oh, I am so glad,\" exclaimed the girl; \"I did not want to see you die!\" She looked at Miles as she spoke. \"I saw you before Spiro this afternoon. Poor Spiro!\" she murmured as she cut their bonds. It was some time before circulation was restored to their limbs. Miles asked anxiously, \"How many guards are there at the door?\"  \"Twelve,\" said the girl; \"but they are playing wong-wo in the room outside and drinking soola.\" She pantomimed her meaning. \"I came here through a secret passage beyond,\" she indicated by a wave of her hand. \"Now that you can walk, let us hurry.\" Shyly she took Miles' hand. The warm clasp of her fingers made the blood course faster in his veins.  Through a long passage they glided to another room. There were several confusing turns and dark hallways, and twice they had to cower in shadowy corners while Ah-eeda boldly advanced and held converse with occasional persons encountered, though for the most part the way was silent and deserted. At last they came to a low door opening on a narrow street and the girl put out her torch.  \"To return to our own world we must first reach the Palace of the Heads,\" said Ward. The girl nodded. \"I will guide you there. But we must hurry: the workers will soon be gathered.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Never were Miles and Ward to forget that breathless flight. The girl led them through narrow and devious byways over which dark buildings leaned, evidently avoiding the more direct and open thoroughfares. It seemed as if they were to escape without hindrance when, suddenly, out of a dimly lighted doorway, lurched the gigantic figure of a green man carrying a flare. This flare threw the figures of the fugitives into relief.  \"Ho!\" roared the green man, and came at them like a furious bull. It seemed characteristic of his kind to attack without parley. The torch dropped as he came. There was no resisting that mighty bulk. Unarmed, and with scant room to move backward, the two Americans went down; and that would have been the end of the battle if Ah-eeda, who had shrunk to one side out of the way of the combatants, had not snatched up the still flaming torch and held it against the naked back of the greenish giant. With a scream of anguish the latter ceased throttling the Americans, clapped his hands to his scorched back and rolled clear of them.  Instantly they staggered to their feet and fled down the roadway after the light-footed Ah-eeda. Behind them the screams of the green man made the night hideous. \"Damn him!\" panted Ward; \"he'll have the whole town on our heels!\" Providentially, at that moment the road debouched into the great square. This they crossed at a run, and so, for the last time, entered the Palace of the Heads. Its wide halls and chambers were practically deserted.  Past the crystal chamber where they had first materialized into this strange world they dashed, and through the far door and down the corridor to the blank wall. Already in the rear could be heard the sound of pursuit, the rising clamor of the mob. Ward hammered on the wall with both fists. \"Zoro! Zoro! let us in!\" Now the first of the mob had entered the corridor. \"Zoro! Zoro!\" Noiselessly, and just in time, the wall parted and they sprang through, Miles half carrying the slender form of Ah-eeda. The wall closed behind them, obliterating the fierce cries and footbeats of their pursuers.         *       *       *       *       *  In front of them was Zoro, his hairless head projecting from the tubular container. Ah-eeda shrank fearfully into Miles' embrace. All the other Heads were ranged back of Zoro, but there was something odd about them. The massive craniums lolled loosely to one side or another and the curiously colored eyes were glazed or filmed. Zoro held his head erect, but only with an effort, and his features were drawn and ghastly looking.  \"Yes,\" he said in a feeble voice, \"the Heads are dying. You need not tell me that you have failed. In the end force always fails. No longer will the veins of the people yield their blood to us, and without their blood we cannot live. Soon three hundred thousand years of intelligence will be no more.\" His voice faltered.  Miles and Ward had learned to feel nothing but horror and detestation of the Heads, but now in the face of their tragic end, hearing the dying words of Zoro, awe and sympathy struggled with other emotions in their hearts. These mighty intellects had lived before the days of the flood; their eyes filming now in death had seen the ancient empires of Earth rise and fall.... Sumeria, Babylon.... Stupendous thought; and"]]]
