Tying the knots in the dark, they had to be doubly careful. Then Riccardo tied the other end of the rope around his own waist and donned heavy oxhide gloves.  It was a warm April night, and Lorenzo smelled a horrid odor of garbage and excrement coming up from the pit. It was not actually a pit, but a crevice in the face of the cliff on which Orvieto was built. Lorenzo had hoped the day's heavy rain would have washed the cliffside clean. But the people of Orvieto had been dumping offal here for centuries.  \"Your final instructions?\" he said to David.  \"Ugolini's servant Guglielmo seems to have gotten safely out of the city with your horses and baggage,\" said David. \"He must not have been on any list. He will meet you at the shrine of Saint Sebastian on the road to Siena. From there you know what you have to do.\"  David grasped him by the shoulders and then patted his back. They had become good friends, Lorenzo realized. Look how David was trusting him to ride with a fortune in gems to Siena, meet the right parties, bargain with them, deliver the gems to them and come back to Orvieto with a Ghibellino army. That was much to expect of a man. Yet David seemed not to doubt that Lorenzo would do it.  Lorenzo felt warm when he thought how much David meant to him. He had come on this mission as King Manfred's man, but he was going to Siena just as much for David as for Manfred. Bringing the Sienese into the struggle might keep the French away, though, and that would help Manfred as much as it would the Muslims.  \"Lower away, then,\" Lorenzo said to Riccardo.  David stepped back. Riccardo and Lorenzo both took hold of the rope. Lorenzo stepped over the edge of the chute. His legs dangled, and he tried not to think about how much empty space was between him and the rocks at the base of Orvieto's mountain. The rope cut painfully into his waist and back. He gripped it tightly with his gloved hands and wrapped his legs around it to take some of the strain off the loop around his waist.  Grunting, Riccardo slowly lowered Lorenzo through the chute. David was standing beside Ugolini's man and had laid a protective hand on the rope. The hole in the floor was just wide enough for Lorenzo's shoulders to pass through. Then he was hanging free below the city wall, his back to the cliff, staring out at a starry black sky and the silhouettes of distant hillsides. He felt dizzy and shut his eyes.  \"Turn me,\" he whispered hoarsely up at the opening above him.  After a moment he felt his body rotating, and again he had to fight dizziness. He was facing in toward the smelly crevice, and he drew up his legs and planted his feet firmly on its walls. With the help of the rope he could walk down the cliffside. Riccardo let out the rope a little more, and Lorenzo's boot sole scraped loudly against the crumbling tufa surface, releasing a shower of pebbles.  \"Who's down there?\" a distant voice shouted, and Lorenzo felt as if someone had dumped a bucket of cold water over him. That was the guard in the tower high above. He wondered if the guard could see him down here. He tried to grip the sides of the crevice with his feet and pull himself closer to the cliff face.  \"I am taking a piss, buon'amico!\" Riccardo called up to the guard. \"Do you mind?\"  \"That place is not for pissing,\" the guard called back.  \"Would you rather I sprinkled your tower?\"  There was no answer this time, and Riccardo began whistling loudly to cover any further noises Lorenzo might make. Lorenzo hoped the guard would not come down to investigate. What if he did, and Riccardo felt he must let go of the rope?  Riccardo must have had the same thought, because he began paying out the rope more rapidly, and Lorenzo's feet flew over the crackling rock. He was like a man running furiously backward. It would be comical, he thought, were he not in danger of breaking his neck.  This was a time when he wished he had clung to a religion of some sort rather than abandoning the faith of his fathers and replacing it with nothing. It would be so comforting to pray to an all-powerful being who might be kind enough to protect him. Just _hoping_ not to get hurt seemed stupid and futile.  He felt the cliff wall beginning to slant outward a bit under his feet. The whistling from the shed had stopped. He looked up and saw that he was halfway down the side of the cliff. The backs of his legs ached from the strain of supporting his weight, and his shoulders and arms hurt too. He began to worry, not so much about whether he would fall as what he might land in when he reached the bottom.  And the smell of rot and filth all around him might choke him before he ever got down. He saw directly below him a pit of blackness surrounded by trees that were only a little less dark. The muck might be over his head; he might just sink into it.  As he reached the level of the trees he drew his knees up and then straightened them hard, giving himself a push away from the cliff. He was still being lowered, so that when he swung back to the cliff he was much farther down. This time his boots hit a coating of soft stuff on the rock, and the smell was unbearable.  _I'd rather break my neck than smother in shit._  He kicked again with his legs, and when he hit the end of the outward swing, the rope feeling as if it would cut him in two, he grabbed for a tree branch, barely visible in the darkness. It hit him in the stomach and knocked all the wind out of him, but he clung to it desperately.  Bent double over the tree limb, he looked down and saw shadows that might be forest floor as far below him as his own height. Then again, he might be seeing the tops of other trees. He drew his dagger and cut the rope around his middle but held it with one hand. He took deep, relieved breaths when the constraint was gone. He gave three sharp jerks on the rope, the signal that he was down. After a moment all tension left the rope, and he felt it falling in the darkness. Another moment and he heard rustlings, thumps, and splashes as the rope landed at the bottom of the crevice. Tomorrow's dumping, he thought, would quite conceal it.  He wondered briefly if David and Riccardo had safely left the dumping shed and were on their way back to Ugolini's. He looked down again into the darkness, realizing that if he jumped from here he might fall far enough to kill himself. Having swung away from the pile of offal, he was now more worried about breaking his neck. He pulled himself up, straddling the tree and facing in toward the trunk. He slid down to the trunk, then tried to feel about with his foot for another branch.  His feet met nothing. He swung over the side of the branch, feeling the trunk with one hand and the space below him with his feet. Still nothing. Now he was dangling from the limb, holding on with two aching hands. If he had not worn gloves, he would have no skin left on his palms.  _Well, here goes one hopeful atheist._ He let go.  He fell a short distance, feetfirst, into a pool of water. It came up over his low boots, soaking his hose. There was no smell; apparently it was a pure forest pool, probably a puddle enlarged by the recent rain. Sighing, he sloshed out of it. Small creatures hopped and scurried away from him.  _It could have been much, much worse._  Glad to feel his feet on the ground, he hoped the rest of his journey to Siena would be less exciting than the beginning.     XLVI   Friar Mathieu sat in a cushion-lined armchair in the cloistered garden of the Hospital of Santa Clara, the white wisps of his beard ruffling like feathers in the morning breeze. The dappled shade of a pear tree protected him from the June sun.  A young Franciscan, his tonsured head a gleaming pink spot surrounded by a wreath of close-cropped black hair, stood at a tall desk beside Friar Mathieu, writing on a piece of parchment.  \"All things lead to good if one looks at them aright,\" Friar Mathieu said with a chuckle. \"That murderer in black gave me the time I needed to do something needful--get the story of my journey among the Tartars written before it is lost in my failing memory. A good thing I did not land on my head.\"  Despite the pain he felt at Friar Mathieu's injuries, Simon had to smile at the old Franciscan's little joke. And indeed, he might look small and fragile huddled in his chair, but he was showing energy and zest for life. He was pulling through.  \"And behold,\" Friar Mathieu went on, lifting his bandaged right arm, \"I myself am exempted from writing. Friar Giuseppe must do the work while I sit here and explore my memory. And when I grow tired of even that little bit of work, Friar Giuseppe reads to me from the newly arrived manuscript on mathematics, called _De Computo Naturali_, by our gifted brother Friar Bacon of Oxford. I could almost be grateful to that Assassin.\"  Simon stood awkwardly, looking unhappily down at him, till Friar Mathieu motioned him to sit on the ground beside him. To make room for himself, Simon moved a pair of crutches out of the way. It was worrisome that so soon--only a few weeks after the fall that had almost killed him--Friar Mathieu had started hobbling about on crutches and had begun dictating, sitting painfully upright, to Friar Giuseppe. Even though one leg was certainly broken and there were probably a dozen other cracks in his arms and ribs, Friar Mathieu insisted that he was more likely to die if he remained in bed than if he was up and moving about.  \"You are looking well today, Father.\" He had to admit it, even though the old priest was not taking proper care of himself.  \"I am lucky this happened to me in the spring,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"The sun and air help me mend. But I fear you will not see my complete recovery, since you will have to leave Orvieto shortly.\"  \"Leave? Why, Father? Has something gone wrong?\" His first thought, as always, was for the safety of the Tartars. Ever since"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28516"],["title","The Saracen: The Holy War (#5)"],["body","terrible night in April, he dreaded leaving them out of his sight.  Instead of answering, Friar Mathieu asked Friar Giuseppe for privacy. The young priest bowed deeply and touched the old man's hand reverently before gathering up his writing materials and turning to go.  \"You have not heard, then? A courier brought the news to the pope's palace last night. All through the north, the Ghibellini are on the move. Siena, it seems, has been quietly raising an army to send against Orvieto. And the Ghibellino party has taken power in Pisa and Lucca. It appears the Ghibellini have decided to seize all of Italy before the French come in and take it.\"  _But we are French_, thought Simon, _and we have no ambitions in Italy_.  _Uncle Charles does._  In this quiet garden it was hard to believe that an army could be preparing to march against Orvieto. Or even that the attack on the Palazzo Monaldeschi had happened in the same city. Simon watched a friar in his brown robe serenely weeding. The rows of plants were already tall and thick--peas, haricots, lettuce, cabbage, carrots. At Gobignon this time of year the seedlings would not be half as high.  \"Will the Sienese besiege Orvieto?\" he asked.  _Another battle? And another attempt on the Tartars?_  \"Pope Urban will not wait to see what they do,\" said Friar Mathieu. \"He feels threatened from both north and south, and intends to move away from here as soon as possible. There is a rumor that Manfred of Sicily himself may invade the Papal States this summer.\"  Simon sprang to his feet and threw his arms wide in astonishment. \"And what about the Tartars?\"  \"They will certainly go where His Holiness goes.\"  \"God's blood!\" Simon struck his forehead with his hand. \"Forgive me, Father. But if the pope has not enough troops to keep him safe in Orvieto, surely he is in even more danger on the road. And if the Tartars are with him, we could lose everything.\"  Friar Mathieu shook his head, absently rubbing his bound right arm with his left hand. \"We can gain everything. His Holiness needs help desperately. Now he can be persuaded to give King Louis permission to join with the Tartars.\" The old Franciscan's eyes fixed on Simon's. \"You must go to the pope.\"  Simon felt the palms of his hands grow cold. \"The pope will not listen to me, Father.\"  Friar Mathieu chuckled. \"Is he more likely to listen to that fool--God forgive me--de Verceuil?\"  \"Yes,\" said Simon after a moment's thought. \"De Verceuil is a cardinal. And is it not his task to treat with the pope? Mine is to guard the ambassadors.\"  \"Are you not close to King Louis, Simon? Almost a foster son?\"  Simon hesitated. \"That is putting it a bit strongly. But he knows me well.\"  Friar Mathieu gestured with his left hand. \"Then you are the person to carry His Holiness's appeal for help to King Louis.\"  The suggestion dismayed Simon. It meant he would have to leave the Tartars for months. And just when they would be much more vulnerable to attack, following the pope from one city to another.  \"No, Father,\" he said. \"I cannot leave the Tartars.\"  Friar Mathieu shook his head patiently. \"Do you not see, Simon? If the pope does decide to approve an alliance with the Tartars, John and Philip's work is done.\"  Standing on the gravel walk of the Franciscan cloister garden, Simon felt as if the earth were shaking under him. He could not picture himself speaking to the pope as one statesman to another. Persuade the pope suddenly to take a stand, when he had vacillated for nearly a year? And yet, he told himself, he was the Count de Gobignon, and the lands he held were larger than some kingdoms.  But that only reminded him that he held the title through a lie.         *       *       *       *       *  The courtyard before the papal palace was crowded with covered wagons and open carts, horses and donkeys, men carrying crates and bales. Here and there, mailed papal archers in gold and white surcoats strode, crossbows on their shoulders, alert for pilfering. Simon asked a series of servants for the pope's majordomo and was directed to that official, clad in a glittering embroidered tunic, who stood at the center of the papal library overseeing the packing of books and scrolls. Simon summoned up all his confidence and presented himself to the man.  \"The Count de Gobignon of France?\" the horse-faced majordomo repeated. \"I will try to find His Holiness for you, Your Signory.\"  They found Pope Urban in a tiny chamber on the second floor of the palace, writing furiously at a desk that faced a window opposite the door. He was wearing a white cassock with a white linen hood drawn up over his head. On his desk Simon saw a jar of ink, a sheaf of quills, and a stack of parchment sheets. A wrought-iron stand held a black earthenware pitcher over a candle flame.  \"Holy Father--\" the majordomo began, addressing the pope's back. Simon watched with fascination the rapid movements of Pope Urban's right arm as his quill raced over the parchment, leaping after each line to the ink jar and back again.  \"Maledizione!\" the pope exclaimed. \"Not now, Ludovico. God's pity, let me get at least one letter done without you interrupting me. The Archangel Michael run you through if you speak another word to me.\"  Simon was momentarily shocked, but then recalled that the pope was a shoemaker's son. Once a bourgeois, always a bourgeois, he thought, even if one becomes God's vicar on earth. But, by God's robe, the man could write fast. In a moment he had filled a sheet of parchment with the short, unadorned black strokes of a chancery hand. Simon estimated it would take him the better part of a morning to write that much. Of course Pope Urban, being a churchman all his life, had a good deal more practice at writing.  Urban folded the parchment and poured melted red wax from the black pitcher to seal it. He took the large gold ring from his finger and stamped it into the wax. Without looking around, he handed the letter to his majordomo.  \"To Duke Alberto Baglione at Perugia by our best horses,\" said Pope Urban. \"Have Pietro Pettorini carry it; he is our fastest man.\"  \"Holiness,\" said the majordomo diffidently, taking the letter, \"the Count de Gobignon wishes to see you.\"  \"Ah!\" Urban half turned in his chair to look at Simon. Simon saw that the pope's wrinkled face was a deep pink, and his eyes glittered. Loose strands of gray hair escaping from under his hood quivered as his head shook with a slight, constant tremor. Simon had heard that men sometimes rallied in the final stages of an illness, before the slide into darkness. That, perhaps, accounted for the pope's color and energy. Simon's heart ached for the old man. This was the spiritual father of the world, and his troubles, troubles Simon had in part brought to him, were aiding whatever disease was destroying him.  \"Simon de Gobignon!\" Urban cried, raising bony hands in benediction. \"If you had not come to me, I should have sent for you.\" His pale blue eyes shifted from side to side, and Simon felt even more pain for him.  _This man should not think of traveling. It will kill him._  Urban half stood, and his majordomo rushed past Simon to turn his chair so that the pope could face his visitor. He was sitting in a simple straight-back chair without arms.  Simon stepped into the room and dropped to one knee. The pope extended his trembling right hand, and Simon kissed his gold Fisherman's Ring. On its circular face was an engraving of a bearded man whom Simon guessed must be Saint Peter, casting a net from the stern of a boat.  Seen close at hand and without the tall tiara and the crozier and the heavy robes of office, Urban was very short. Simon wondered whether he had always been a little man or whether age and the strains of his office had shrunk him.  \"Stand up, Monseigneur le Comte, s'il vous plaît,\" said the pope, changing to French. \"I am sorry there is no chair, but this is where I do all my real work, and it is best not to encourage visitors to sit. Ludovico, leave us and shut the door behind you. And do not hang about in the corridor eavesdropping.\"  Simon rose, and found himself looking down at the skullcap on top of the pope's head. Feeling awkward, he took a few steps backward until his back was against the door of the tiny chamber.  Urban said, \"I have long wanted to hear from your own lips what happened at the Palazzo Monaldeschi.\"  Simon gave the pope a detailed account of the battle. He ended with his fight with the man in black. Urban's eyes widened, and the trembling of his head grew more pronounced. When Simon told how the enemy had escaped, throwing Friar Mathieu from the cellar stairs, the pope winced in pain.  \"So,\" Urban mused, \"this murderer--doubtless sent by Manfred von Hohenstaufen--still lurks somewhere in Orvieto.\"  \"We have tried to track him down,\" said Simon. \"But the Filippeschi deny any knowledge of him, and the podesta, it seems, has not the power to make them answer our questions.\" He allowed the contempt he felt for d'Ucello to creep into his voice.  \"Open the door and see if that sneaking Ludovico is listening outside,\" Pope Urban said. His lips twitched under his flowing gray beard in what was probably a smile.  Simon went to the door, and saw no one in the corridor but a helmeted man-at-arms standing about ten paces away. Servants with a huge bed frame struggled past. He closed the door and turned again to the pope.  \"Yes,\" said Urban. \"What was I saying? Ah, yes--Simon, I expect to be in my grave before the year is out.\"  \"God forbid, Your Holiness!\"  \"God do me that kindness, you mean.\" Urban raised a deprecating hand. \"I am worn out. I am ready to go home. But I have a last task to do before I die. I must insure the destruction of the odious Manfred. I must not let him kill me before my work is done, and I must not fall into the hands of the Ghibellini. So, though it will shorten my life even more, I must leave Orvieto. Now that the Ghibellini have stirred up the Filippeschi"]]]
