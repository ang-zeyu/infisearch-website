She's so quiet and unassuming, Edna--absolutely no _hauteur_. I'm sure you will like her. I told her about you all, and she seemed _so_ interested. Quite between ourselves, I shouldn't be at all surprised if she got us invited to take part in the Pageant--she's on the Committee, you know.\"  \"If I _was_ invited, Mother, I'm not at all sure I shouldn't refuse.\"  \"You must please yourself about that, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, who, perhaps, felt but little anxiety as to the result. \"_I_ shall certainly accept if the part is at all suitable.\"  She might have said more, if Ruby had not suddenly burst into the room. Ruby was certainly the flower of the family--an extremely engaging young person of about ten, whose mischievous golden-brown eyes had long and curling lashes, and whose vivacious face was set off by a thick mane of deepest Titian red.  \"Oh, Mummy,\" she announced breathlessly, \"I've got invitations for nearly all my animals while we're away at Eastbourne! Mucius Scævola's the most popular--everybody asked him, but I think he'll feel _most_ at home with Daisy Williams. Vivian and Ada Porter will simply love to have Numa Pompilius, but nobody seems to want Tarquinius Superbus, so I shall turn him out in the garden, and he must catch worms for himself.\"  \"Dearest child,\" said her mother, \"what are these new animals of yours with the extraordinary names?\"  \"They're the same old animals, Mums. I've rechristened them since I began Roman History with Miss Heritage. Mucius Scævola's the Salamander, because they're indifferent to fire, like he was--though Miss Heritage says it wouldn't be kind to try with Mucius. Numa Pompilius is the Blind-worm--he used to be Kaa--and the Toad has changed from Nobbles to Tarquinius Superbus.\"  \"I can't understand how you can keep such unpleasant pets as reptiles,\" said Edna.  \"Because I like them,\" said Ruby simply. \"And Bobby Williams has promised, as soon as it gets warmer, to come out on the Common with me and catch lizards. _Won't_ it be lovely?\"  \"I hope you won't put one of them down anybody's neck, then, as you did to Tommy Fletcher.\"  \"That was Mucius,\" Ruby admitted cheerfully. \"But I didn't mean him to go so far down. And he was very good--he didn't bite Tommy anywhere.\"  \"Little ladies don't play such tricks,\" said her Mother. \"I hope Miss Heritage doesn't encourage your liking for these horrid creatures?\"  \"Oh, she doesn't mind, so long as I don't take them out of the aquarium, but she hates touching them herself.\"  \"Did she come in with you?\" her mother inquired, and was told that Miss Heritage had done so, and had gone upstairs, whereupon Ruby was ordered to go and take off her things, and stay quietly in the schoolroom till it was time to come down.  \"I don't know if you noticed it, Mother,\" Edna began, as soon as Ruby had consented to leave them, \"but Miss Heritage had a letter by the afternoon post which seemed to upset her. I went rather out of my way to ask her if she had had bad news of any kind, but she did not think proper to take me into her confidence. Perhaps she might be more open with _you_.\"  \"My dear,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, with much dignity, \"I take no interest whatever in Miss Heritage's private correspondence.\"  \"Nor I,\" declared Edna. \"I only thought that if she is in any trouble--She's so secretive, you know, Mums. I've tried more than once to get her to tell me what cosmetic she uses for her hands--and she never will own to using any at all!\"  \"I'm sure, Edna, you've no reason to be ashamed of your hands.\"  \"Oh, they look all right just now,\" said Edna, examining them dispassionately. \"But they _will_ turn lobster colour at the most inconvenient times. Hers never do--and it _does_ seem so unfair, considering--\" She broke off here, as Daphne Heritage entered.  \"Well, Miss Heritage?\" said Mrs. Stimpson, as the girl hesitated on seeing Edna. \"Did you wish to speak to me?\"  \"I did rather want your advice about something,\" said Daphne, who had a paper, and a small leather case in her hands; \"I thought I might find you alone. It doesn't matter--it will do quite well another time.\"  \"Don't let _me_ prevent you, Miss Heritage,\" said Edna. \"If you don't wish to speak to Mother before me, I've no desire to remain. I was just going up to change in any case.\"  She went out with a slightly huffy air, which was not entirely due to baffled curiosity, for she admired Daphne enough to resent being quietly kept at a distance.  \"It's about this,\" explained Daphne, after Edna had made her exit--\"a bill that has just been sent on to me.\" She gave the paper to Mrs. Stimpson as she spoke. \"I don't know quite what to do about it.\"  She looked very young and inexperienced as she stood there, a slim girlish figure with masses of burnished hair the colour of ripe corn, braided and coiled as closely as possible round her small head, but there was no trace of timidity or subservience in her manner. In the slight form, with the milk-white skin, delicate profile and exquisite hands, there was a distinction that struck her employer as quite absurdly out of keeping with her position.  \"The only thing to do about a bill, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, \"is to pay it. But nearly thirty pounds is a large sum for you to owe your milliner.\"  \"It's for things Mother--my adopted mother, you know--ordered for me. Stéphanie was always told to send in the account to her. But this seems to have been overlooked, and the executors have sent it on to me. Only I can't pay it myself--unless you wouldn't mind advancing me the money out of my salary.\"  \"I couldn't possibly. You forget that it would represent over a year's salary, and it's by no means certain that you will be with me so long.\"  \"I was afraid you wouldn't,\" said Daphne, with a little droop at the corners of her extremely pretty mouth. \"So I brought this to show you.\" She held out the leather case. \"It's the only jewellery I've got. It belonged to my father, I believe; he and my real mother both died when I was a baby, you know--and I never meant to part with it. But now I'm afraid I must--that is, if you think any jeweller would give as much as thirty pounds for it.\"  Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson opened the case, which was much more modern than the kind of badge or pendant it contained. This was a fairly large oval stone of a milky green, deeply engraved with strangely formed letters interlaced in a cypher, and surrounded by a border of dark blue gems which Mrs. Stimpson decided instantly must be Cabochon star sapphires of quite exceptional quality. The gold chain attached to it was antique and of fine and curious workmanship.  She was convinced that the pendant must be worth considerably more than thirty pounds, though she was no doubt right in telling Daphne that no jeweller would offer so much for an ornament that was quite out of fashion. \"Besides,\" she said, \"I don't like the idea of any governess of mine going about offering jewellery for sale. Have Edna or Ruby seen you wearing this thing?\" she asked with apparent irrelevance.  It appeared they had not; Daphne had never worn it herself, and she had only remembered its existence that afternoon, and found it hidden away at the back of her wardrobe.  \"Well,\" said Mrs. Stimpson, \"it is most unpleasant to me to see a young girl like you owing all this money to her milliner.\"  \"It isn't very pleasant for _me_,\" said Daphne ruefully; \"but if you won't advance the money, and I can't or mustn't sell the pendant, I don't very well see how I can help it.\"  \"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" said Mrs. Stimpson. \"I really _oughtn't_ to--and under ordinary circumstances I couldn't afford it, but, as it happens, a great-uncle of mine left me a small legacy not long ago, and I haven't spent quite all of it yet. So I don't mind buying this for thirty pounds myself.\"  \"Will you really?\" cried Daphne. \"How angelic of you!\"  \"I think it is,\" said Mrs. Stimpson; \"but I feel myself responsible for you, to some extent. So I'll write you a cheque for the thirty pounds, and you can send it off to this milliner person at once.\" She went to the writing-table and filled up the cheque. \"There,\" she said, handing it to Daphne, \"put it in an envelope and direct it at once--you'll find a stamp in that box, and it can go by the next post.\"  \"By the way, my dear,\" she added, as she was leaving the room, \"I needn't tell you that _I_ shall not breathe a word to a soul of our little transaction, and I should advise you, in your own interests, to keep it entirely to yourself.\"  \"I was quite wrong about Mrs. Stimpson,\" Daphne told herself reproachfully, after she had slipped the letter containing bill and cheque into the letter-box in the hall. \"She _can_ be kind sometimes, and I've been a little beast to see only the comic side of her! I daresay she won't even _wear_ that pendant.\"  But Mrs. Stimpson had every intention of wearing it that same evening. It is not often that one has the opportunity of doing a kindness and securing a real bargain at a single stroke; and she knew enough about jewels to be fully aware that, if the ornament was a trifle old-fashioned, she had not done at all badly over her purchase.  \"It really suits me very well,\" she thought, as, after putting the last touches to her evening demi-toilette, she fastened the pendant round her neck. \"Even better than I expected. It was lucky Miss Heritage came to _me_. A jeweller would have been sure to cheat her, poor child!\"  And she went down to the drawing-room"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28459"],["title","In Brief Authority (#3)"],["body"," serenely satisfied with herself.     CHAPTER II  RUSHING TO CONCLUSIONS   Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, as she sat in the drawing-room, where the curtains had been drawn and the lamps lighted, was occupied with a project which she was anxious to impart to her husband as soon as he returned. Some time before a dull rumble from the valley had informed her that his usual train was approaching Gablehurst station, and now she heard the click of the front gate, the crunch of his well-known step on the gravel, and the opening of the hall door.  \"I want to speak to you for a moment, Sidney,\" she said, opening the drawing-room door. \"Come in here before you go up to dress.\" (Mrs. Stimpson insisted on his dressing for dinner. It was customary in all really good society, and also it would prevent him from feeling awkward in evening clothes--which it never did.)  \"Very well, my dear,\" he said, entering. \"Any news with you?\" which was his invariable question.  Mr. Stimpson was short and inclined to be stout. What remained of his hair was auburn and separated in the middle by a wide parting; he had close-cut whiskers of a lighter red, which met in his moustache, and if his eyes had been narrow, instead of round and filmy like a seal's, and his mouth had been firm, and not loose and slightly open, he would not have been at all a bad caricature of his Majesty King Henry the Eighth.  \"Nothing--except, but I'll tell you about that afterwards. Sit down, do, and don't fidget.... Well, I've been thinking, Sidney, that we really ought to ask the Chevril Thistletons to a quiet little dinner. Not to meet any of our _usual_ set, of course! We could have the dear Rector, who, if he _is_ Low Church, is very well connected--and Lady Harriet Elmslie.\"  Mr. Stimpson showed no enthusiasm at the suggestion. \"Lady Elmslie, Selina!\" he cried. \"But we don't _know_ her ladyship!\"  \"I do wish you would learn to use titles correctly, Sidney! Lady _Harriet_ Elmslie--not Lady _Elmslie_! And you shouldn't speak of her, except to servants, as 'her ladyship'; that's only done by inferiors.\"  \"Well, my love, whatever may be the correct way of speaking of her, the fact remains that we haven't the honour of her acquaintance.\"  \"That's just where you're mistaken! We _have_, or at least _I_ have;\" and she described how she had come to enjoy that privilege.  \"Well,\" he admitted at the conclusion, \"she certainly seems to have made herself exceedingly affable, but it doesn't follow that she'd come and dine, even if we asked her.\"  \"She would if it was to meet the Thistletons.\"  \"Perhaps so, my love, but--er--we don't know that _they_ would come.\"  \"Of course they would, if they knew we were expecting Lady Harriet. For goodness' sake, Sidney, don't swing your foot like that--you know I can't bear it. All _you_ have to do is to find out from Mr. Thistleton what evenings the week after next would be most convenient, and _I'll_ undertake the rest!\"  \"I--I really couldn't do that, Selina. I'm a proud man, in my way, and I don't care about exposing myself unnecessarily to a rebuff.\"  \"Why should you be rebuffed? After all, he's only a junior partner!\"  \"True, my love, but that doesn't make him less stand-offish. He may be _in_ the business, but he's not _of_ it. I doubt myself whether even old Cramphorn would venture to invite him to dinner, and if he did, I'd bet a tidy sum that the Honourable Mr. Chevril Thistleton----\"  \"Mr.--_not_ the Honourable _Mr._ Thistleton, Sidney,\" corrected his wife, who had studied all such _minutiæ_ in a handbook written by a lady of unimpeachable authority. \"The term is _never_ employed in ordinary conversation, or on visiting cards. But, if you won't show a proper spirit, I shall write myself to Mrs. Thistleton and propose one or two dates.\"  \"It would be no good, my love,\" said Mr. Stimpson, brought to bay, \"because, if you _must_ know, I--er--_did_ approach the subject with Thistleton--and--well, his manner was not sufficiently encouraging to induce me to try it again. Not so fond of being made to feel as if I was no better than one of our own clerks. I get quite enough of _that_ from old Cramphorn!\"  \"You should _assert_ yourself more, Sidney, if you want people to respect you.\"  \"I'm always asserting myself--but old Cramphorn never listens! Just goes on his own way. Won't hear of any changes--what was good enough when the firm started a hundred years ago is good enough for _him_--now I'm all for _new_ ideas myself--Progress and so forth!\"  \"That's what has kept us back,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson; \"we should have been in a far better set here than we're ever likely to be now if you hadn't given yourself out as a violent Radical, when it's well known that all best Gablehurst people are Conservatives, and several who are not really entitled to be anything of the kind. As it is, I suppose I must be content to pass my life in this suburban hole and mix with none but second-rate people. But I certainly cannot expect Lady Harriet to come here and meet them, so there's an end of it. If she imagines I've no desire to pursue her acquaintance, it can't be helped, that's all! And now you had better go up and dress.\"  The whole family were assembled by the time Mr. Stimpson re-appeared--his wife was in her armchair by the standard lamp. Edna was at the writing-table revising her notes of the afternoon's lecture, and Clarence was seated close by, while Ruby was whispering earnestly to Daphne on one of the chintz couches.  \"All of you down before me, eh?\" said the head of the family after the usual salutations had been exchanged. \"But I went up long after everybody else. And not late after all--I've taught myself to dress in well under ten minutes, you see!\"  \"Wish he'd taught himself not to wear a white tie with a dinner jacket!\" grumbled Clarence to Edna in an undertone.  \"Couldn't you _tell_ him about it?\" she replied.  \"I could--but what'd be the good? He'd only turn up next time in a tail-coat and a black bow!\" said Clarence gloomily. \"The poor old governor's one of the people who never learn----!\"  Clarence's own type was that for which the latest term is \"knut.\" He was accepted both by his family, his intimates, and himself as an infallible guide on things in general. When consulted as to matters on which he happened to be entirely ignorant, and these were not a few--he had formed the habit of preserving a pregnant silence, as of one who could say a good deal on the subject if he were at liberty to speak. And this in itself denoted a certain degree of intelligence.  In appearance he was well built, though only of average height. He had small green eyes like his mother's; his light sandy hair had a natural ripple, and his pale face expressed nothing beyond an assured consciousness of his own superiority. And yet he was not without a certain sense of humour in matters which did not immediately concern himself, though, owing to particular circumstances, it was just then distinctly in abeyance.  \"What time do you get back from the City to-morrow afternoon, my boy?\" his father asked.  \"Not going up at all, Pater,\" said Clarence. \"Told them I shouldn't.\" He was thinking that after dinner would be quite time enough to break the news that, on receiving a severe wigging for general slackness, he had lost his temper, and offered to resign his post--an offer that had been accepted with disconcerting alacrity.  \"Ah, Sidney,\" said Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson, \"_Clarence_ knows how to assert himself, you see!\"  \"I merely asked,\" Mr. Stimpson explained, \"because I'm taking a Saturday off myself, and I thought we could have a round or two of golf together, eh, my boy?\"  \"I don't mind going round with you before lunch,\" said Clarence. \"Engaged for the afternoon; but, if you'll take _my_ advice, Governor, you'd better practise a bit longer with the Pro before you attempt to _play_. No good trying to run till you can walk, don't you know, what?\" (He had learnt to terminate his sentences with \"what\" as a kind of smart shibboleth.) \"Hullo, Mater!\" he broke off suddenly, as he noticed the pendant on her ample bosom, \"where did you get that thing? Out of a cracker?\"  \"Certainly not, Clarence; I am not in the habit of wearing cheap jewellery. And this cost a considerable sum, though I daresay it is worth what I paid for it.\"  \"Did you go much of a mucker for it, Mater?\"  \"If I did, Clarence, I was well able to do so, thanks to dear old Uncle Wibberley's legacy.\"  \"I must say, Mother,\" said Edna, \"it's far the most artistic thing I've ever known you buy.\"  \"It isn't _everybody's_ taste,\" remarked Mr. Stimpson, \"but I should say myself that it wasn't a bad investment. Where did you come across it, my love?\"  \"My dear Sidney,\" replied Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson with much majesty, \"as I purchased it with my own money, where I came across it, and what I paid for it are surely matters that only concern myself.\"  Daphne, who could hardly avoid hearing this conversation, was impressed by the tact and delicacy it displayed. It never occurred to her that Mrs. Wibberley-Stimpson's reticence might be inspired by other motives than a generous desire to spare her feelings. \"She really is quite a decent sort!\" she told herself.  Clarence had not been unobservant of her--indeed it would not be too much to say that he had been acutely conscious all the time of Miss Heritage's presence.  Ever since she had become a member of the household he had alternated between the desire to impress her and the dread of becoming entangled in the toils of an artful little enchantress. It was true that since her arrival in the family she had made no effort whatever to enchant him; indeed, she had treated him with easy indifference--but this, his experience of her sex and the world told him, was probably assumed. She could hardly help knowing that he was something of a \"catch\" from her point of view, and scheming to ensnare him.  Perhaps Clarence, with his now dubious prospects, felt himself rather"]]]
