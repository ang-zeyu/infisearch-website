And I should be glad to have       change of this five-pound note.”        A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the       summons of the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence       at the famous detective.        “Let me have the Hotel Directory,” said Holmes. “Thank you! Now,       Cartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all       in the immediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?”        “Yes, sir.”        “You will visit each of these in turn.”        “Yes, sir.”        “You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one       shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings.”        “Yes, sir.”        “You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of       yesterday. You will say that an important telegram has miscarried       and that you are looking for it. You understand?”        “Yes, sir.”        “But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the       _Times_ with some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy       of the _Times_. It is this page. You could easily recognize it,       could you not?”        “Yes, sir.”        “In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter,       to whom also you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three       shillings. You will then learn in possibly twenty cases out of       the twenty-three that the waste of the day before has been burned       or removed. In the three other cases you will be shown a heap of       paper and you will look for this page of the _Times_ among it.       The odds are enormously against your finding it. There are ten       shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a report by       wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only       remains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman,       No. 2704, and then we will drop into one of the Bond Street       picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the       hotel.”     Chapter 5. Three Broken Threads         Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of       detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in       which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was       entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters.       He would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest       ideas, from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at       the Northumberland Hotel.        “Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,” said the       clerk. “He asked me to show you up at once when you came.”        “Have you any objection to my looking at your register?” said       Holmes.        “Not in the least.”        The book showed that two names had been added after that of       Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle;       the other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.        “Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,” said       Holmes to the porter. “A lawyer, is he not, grey-headed, and       walks with a limp?”        “No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active       gentleman, not older than yourself.”        “Surely you are mistaken about his trade?”        “No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very       well known to us.”        “Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the       name. Excuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend       one finds another.”        “She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of       Gloucester. She always comes to us when she is in town.”        “Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have       established a most important fact by these questions, Watson,” he       continued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. “We know       now that the people who are so interested in our friend have not       settled down in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as       we have seen, very anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious       that he should not see them. Now, this is a most suggestive       fact.”        “What does it suggest?”        “It suggests—halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the       matter?”        As we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir       Henry Baskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and       he held an old and dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was       he that he was hardly articulate, and when he did speak it was in       a much broader and more Western dialect than any which we had       heard from him in the morning.        “Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,” he       cried. “They’ll find they’ve started in to monkey with the wrong       man unless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can’t find       my missing boot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the       best, Mr. Holmes, but they’ve got a bit over the mark this time.”        “Still looking for your boot?”        “Yes, sir, and mean to find it.”        “But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?”        “So it was, sir. And now it’s an old black one.”        “What! you don’t mean to say—?”        “That’s just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the       world—the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers,       which I am wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones,       and today they have sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got       it? Speak out, man, and don’t stand staring!”        An agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.        “No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear       no word of it.”        “Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I’ll see the       manager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.”        “It shall be found, sir—I promise you that if you will have a       little patience it will be found.”        “Mind it is, for it’s the last thing of mine that I’ll lose in       this den of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you’ll excuse my       troubling you about such a trifle—”        “I think it’s well worth troubling about.”        “Why, you look very serious over it.”        “How do you explain it?”        “I just don’t attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,       queerest thing that ever happened to me.”        “The queerest perhaps—” said Holmes thoughtfully.        “What do you make of it yourself?”        “Well, I don’t profess to understand it yet. This case of yours       is very complex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your       uncle’s death I am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of       capital importance which I have handled there is one which cuts       so deep. But we hold several threads in our hands, and the odds       are that one or other of them guides us to the truth. We may       waste time in following the wrong one, but sooner or later we       must come upon the right.”        We had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the       business which had brought us together. It was in the private       sitting-room to which we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked       Baskerville what were his intentions.        “To go to Baskerville Hall.”        “And when?”        “At the end of the week.”        “On the whole,” said Holmes, “I think that your decision is a       wise one. I have ample evidence that you are being dogged in       London, and amid the millions of this great city it is difficult       to discover who these people are or what their object can be. If       their intentions are evil they might do you a mischief, and we       should be powerless to prevent it. You did not know, Dr.       Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?”        Dr. Mortimer started violently. “Followed! By whom?”        “That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among       your neighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a       black, full beard?”        “No—or, let me see—why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles’s butler, is       a man with a full, black beard.”        “Ha! Where is Barrymore?”        “He is in charge of the Hall.”        “We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any       possibility he might be in London.”        “How can you do that?”        “Give me a telegraph form. ‘Is all ready for Sir Henry?’ That       will do. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the       nearest telegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a       second wire to the postmaster, Grimpen: ‘Telegram to Mr.       Barrymore to be delivered into his own hand. If absent, please       return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel.’ That       should let us know before evening whether Barrymore is at his       post in Devonshire or not.”        “That’s so,” said Baskerville. “By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is       this Barrymore, anyhow?”        “He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have       looked after the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know,       he and his wife are as respectable a couple as any in the       county.”        “At the same time,” said Baskerville, “it’s clear enough that so       long as there are none of the family at the Hall these people       have a mighty fine home and nothing to do.”        “That is true.”        “Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles’s will?” asked       Holmes.        “He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.”        “Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?”        “Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions       of his will.”        “That is very interesting.”        “I hope,” said Dr. Mortimer, “that you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2853"],["title","Quo Vadis: A Narrative of the Time of Nero (#0)"],["body","VADIS  A NARRATIVE OF THE TIME OF NERO  by Henryk Sienkiewicz   Translated from the Polish by Jeremiah Curtin         TO AUGUSTE COMTE,       Of San Francisco, Cal.,       MY DEAR FRIEND AND CLASSMATE, I BEG TO DEDICATE THIS VOLUME.       JEREMIAH CURTIN     INTRODUCTORY  IN the trilogy “With Fire and Sword,” “The Deluge,” and “Pan Michael,”  Sienkiewicz has given pictures of a great and decisive epoch in modern history. The results of the struggle begun under Bogdan Hmelnitski have been felt for more than two centuries, and they are growing daily in importance. The Russia which rose out of that struggle has become a power not only of European but of world-wide significance, and, to all human seeming, she is yet in an early stage of her career.  In “Quo Vadis” the author gives us pictures of opening scenes in the conflict of moral ideas with the Roman Empire,--a conflict from which Christianity issued as the leading force in history.  The Slays are not so well known to Western Europe or to us as they are sure to be in the near future; hence the trilogy, with all its popularity and merit, is not appreciated yet as it will be.  The conflict described in “Quo Vadis” is of supreme interest to a vast number of persons reading English; and this book will rouse, I think, more attention at first than anything written by Sienkiewicz hitherto.  JEREMIAH CURTIN  ILOM, NORTHERN GUATEMALA,  June, 1896      QUO VADIS  Quo Vadis A Narrative of the Time of Nero     Chapter I   PETRONIUS woke only about midday, and as usual greatly wearied. The evening before he had been at one of Nero’s feasts, which was prolonged till late at night. For some time his health had been failing. He said himself that he woke up benumbed, as it were, and without power of collecting his thoughts. But the morning bath and careful kneading of the body by trained slaves hastened gradually the course of his slothful blood, roused him, quickened him, restored his strength, so that he issued from the elæothesium, that is, the last division of the bath, as if he had risen from the dead, with eyes gleaming from wit and gladness, rejuvenated, filled with life, exquisite, so unapproachable that Otho himself could not compare with him, and was really that which he had been called,--arbiter elegantiarum.  He visited the public baths rarely, only when some rhetor happened there who roused admiration and who was spoken of in the city, or when in the ephebias there were combats of exceptional interest. Moreover, he had in his own “insula” private baths which Celer, the famous contemporary of Severus, had extended for him, reconstructed and arranged with such uncommon taste that Nero himself acknowledged their excellence over those of the Emperor, though the imperial baths were more extensive and finished with incomparably greater luxury.  After that feast, at which he was bored by the jesting of Vatinius with Nero, Lucan, and Seneca, he took part in a diatribe as to whether woman has a soul. Rising late, he used, as was his custom, the baths. Two enormous balneatores laid him on a cypress table covered with snow-white Egyptian byssus, and with hands dipped in perfumed olive oil began to rub his shapely body; and he waited with closed eyes till the heat of the laconicum and the heat of their hands passed through him and expelled weariness.  But after a certain time he spoke, and opened his eyes; he inquired about the weather, and then about gems which the jeweller Idomeneus had promised to send him for examination that day. It appeared that the weather was beautiful, with a light breeze from the Alban hills, and that the gems had not been brought. Petronius closed his eyes again, and had given command to bear him to the tepidarium, when from behind the curtain the nomenclator looked in, announcing that young Marcus Vinicius, recently returned from Asia Minor, had come to visit him.  Petronius ordered to admit the guest to the tepidarium, to which he was borne himself. Vinicius was the son of his oldest sister, who years before had married Marcus Vinicius, a man of consular dignity from the time of Tiberius. The young man was serving then under Corbulo against the Parthians, and at the close of the war had returned to the city. Petronius had for him a certain weakness bordering on attachment, for Marcus was beautiful and athletic, a young man who knew how to preserve a certain aesthetic measure in his profligacy; this, Petronius prized above everything.  “A greeting to Petronius,” said the young man, entering the tepidarium with a springy step. “May all the gods grant thee success, but especially Asklepios and Kypris, for under their double protection nothing evil can meet one.”  “I greet thee in Rome, and may thy rest be sweet after war,” replied Petronius, extending his hand from between the folds of soft karbas stuff in which he was wrapped. “What’s to be heard in Armenia; or since thou wert in Asia, didst thou not stumble into Bithynia?”  Petronius on a time had been proconsul in Bithynia, and, what is more, he had governed with energy and justice. This was a marvellous contrast in the character of a man noted for effeminacy and love of luxury; hence he was fond of mentioning those times, as they were a proof of what he had been, and of what he might have become had it pleased him.  “I happened to visit Heraklea,” answered Vinicius. “Corbulo sent me there with an order to assemble reinforcements.”  “Ah, Heraklea! I knew at Heraklea a certain maiden from Colchis, for whom I would have given all the divorced women of this city, not excluding Poppæa. But these are old stories. Tell me now, rather, what is to be heard from the Parthian boundary. It is true that they weary me every Vologeses of them, and Tiridates and Tigranes,--those barbarians who, as young Arulenus insists, walk on all fours at home, and pretend to be human only when in our presence. But now people in Rome speak much of them, if only for the reason that it is dangerous to speak of aught else.”  “The war is going badly, and but for Corbulo might be turned to defeat.”  “Corbulo! by Bacchus! a real god of war, a genuine Mars, a great leader, at the same time quick-tempered, honest, and dull. I love him, even for this,--that Nero is afraid of him.”  “Corbulo is not a dull man.”  “Perhaps thou art right, but for that matter it is all one. Dulness, as Pyrrho says, is in no way worse than wisdom, and differs from it in nothing.”  Vinicius began to talk of the war; but when Petronius closed his eyes again, the young man, seeing his uncle’s tired and somewhat emaciated face, changed the conversation, and inquired with a certain interest about his health.  Petronius opened his eyes again.  Health!--No. He did not feel well. He had not gone so far yet, it is true, as young Sissena, who had lost sensation to such a degree that when he was brought to the bath in the morning he inquired, “Am I sitting?” But he was not well. Vinicius had just committed him to the care of Asklepios and Kypris. But he, Petronius, did not believe in Asklepios. It was not known even whose son that Asklepios was, the son of Arsinoe or Koronis; and if the mother was doubtful, what was to be said of the father? Who, in that time, could be sure who his own father was?  Hereupon Petronius began to laugh; then he continued,--“Two years ago, it is true, I sent to Epidaurus three dozen live blackbirds and a goblet of gold; but dost thou know why? I said to myself, ‘Whether this helps or not, it will do me no harm.’ Though people make offerings to the gods yet, I believe that all think as I do,--all, with the exception, perhaps, of mule-drivers hired at the Porta Capena by travellers. Besides Asklepios, I have had dealings with sons of Asklepios. When I was troubled a little last year in the bladder, they performed an incubation for me. I saw that they were tricksters, but I said to myself: ‘What harm! The world stands on deceit, and life is an illusion. The soul is an illusion too. But one must have reason enough to distinguish pleasant from painful illusions.’ I shall give command to burn in my hypocaustum, cedar-wood sprinkled with ambergris, for during life I prefer perfumes to stenches. As to Kypris, to whom thou hast also confided me, I have known her guardianship to the extent that I have twinges in my right foot. But as to the rest she is a good goddess! I suppose that thou wilt bear sooner or later white doves to her altar.”  “True,” answered Vinicius. “The arrows of the Parthians have not reached my body, but a dart of Amor has struck me--unexpectedly, a few stadia from a gate of this city.”  “By the white knees of the Graces! thou wilt tell me of this at a leisure hour.”  “I have come purposely to get thy advice,” answered Marcus.  But at that moment the epilatores came, and occupied themselves with Petronius. Marcus, throwing aside his tunic, entered a bath of tepid water, for Petronius invited him to a plunge bath.  “Ah, I have not even asked whether thy feeling is reciprocated,” said Petronius, looking at the youthful body of Marcus, which was as if cut out of marble. “Had Lysippos seen thee, thou wouldst be ornamenting now the gate leading to the Palatine, as a statue of Hercules in youth.”  The young man smiled with satisfaction, and began to sink in the bath, splashing warm water abundantly on the mosaic which represented Hera at the moment when she was imploring Sleep to lull Zeus to rest. Petronius looked at him with the satisfied eye of an artist.  When Vinicius had finished and yielded himself in turn to the epilatores, a lector came in with a bronze tube at his breast and rolls of paper in the tube.  “Dost wish to listen?” asked Petronius.  “If it is thy creation, gladly!” answered the young tribune; “if not, I prefer conversation. Poets seize people at present on every street corner.”  “Of course they do. Thou wilt not pass any basilica, bath, library, or book-shop without seeing a poet gesticulating like a"]]]
