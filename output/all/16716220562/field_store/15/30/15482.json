The End of Time                               By Wallace West         *       *       *       *       *     [Sidenote: By millions of millions the creatures of earth slow and drop when their time-sense is mysteriously paralyzed.]   \"There is no doubt of it!\" The little chemist pushed steel-bowed spectacles up on his high forehead and peered at his dinner guest with excited blue eyes. \"Time will come to an end at six o'clock this morning.\"  Jack Baron, young radio engineer at the Rothafel Radio laboratories, and protégé of Dr. Manthis, his host, laughed heartily.  \"What a yarn you spin, Doctor,\" he said. \"Write it for the movies.\"  \"But it's true,\" insisted the older man. \"Something is paralyzing our time-sense. The final stroke will occur about daybreak.\"  \"Bosh! You mean the earth will stop rotating, the stars blink out?\"  \"Not at all. Such things have nothing to do with time. You may know your short waves, but your general education has been sadly neglected.\" The scientist picked up a weighty volume. \"Maybe this will explain what I mean. It's from Immanuel Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason.' Listen:       'Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which      inheres in things as an objective determination, and      therefore, remains, when abstraction is made of the      subjective conditions of the intuition of things. For in      the former case it would be something real, yet without      presenting to any power of perception any real object. In      the latter case, as an order of determination inherent in      things themselves, it could not be antecedent to things, as      their condition, nor discerned or intuited by means of      synthetical propositions _a priori_. But all this is quite      possible when we regard time as merely the subjective      condition under which all our intuitions take place.'  \"There. Does that make it clear?\"  \"Clear as mud,\" grinned Baron. \"Kant is too deep for me.\"  \"I'll give you another proof,\" snapped Manthis. \"Look at your watch.\"  The other drew out his timepiece. Slowly his face sobered.  \"Why, I can't see the second hand,\" he exclaimed. \"It's just a blur!\"  \"Exactly! Now look at the minute hand. Can you see it move?\"  \"Yes, quite clearly.\"  \"What time is it?\"  [Illustration: _A few remained standing like statues._]  \"Half past one. Great Scott! So that's why you spun that yarn.\" Baron hoisted his six feet one out of the easy chair. \"It's way past your bedtime. Didn't mean to keep you up.\" He stared again at his watch as if it had betrayed him. \"It seems we just finished dinner. I must have dozed off....\"  \"Nonsense,\" sniffed Manthis. \"You arrived at eight o'clock--an hour late. You and I and my daughter had dinner. Then the two of us came in here. We smoked a cigarette or two. Now it's half-past one. Do you need more proof?\"  \"Your theory's all wet somewhere,\" the younger man protested with a shaky laugh. \"If my watch isn't broken, time must be speeding up, not stopping.\"  \"That comes from depending on your senses instead of your intelligence. Think a minute. If the watch seems running double speed that would indicate that your perception of its movements had slowed down fifty per cent.\"  Baron sank back into his chair, leaned forward and gripped his curly black hair with trembling fingers. He felt dizzy and befuddled.  \"June,\" called the doctor. Then to the agitated youth he added: \"Watch my daughter when she comes in if you still think I'm crazy.\"  As he spoke the door flew open and a slim, golden-haired girl shot into the room like a motion picture character in one of those comedies which is run double speed. Jack's eyes could hardly follow her movements.  She came behind her father and threw one slim arm about his shoulders. She spoke, but her usually throaty voice was only a high-pitched squeak.  \"Can't understand you, dear,\" interrupted her father. \"Write it down.\"  \"June is using a drug which I prepared to keep her time sense normal,\" Manthis explained as the girl's pen raced over a pad. \"That's why she disappeared after dinner. I wanted you to get the full effect. Now read this.\"  \"The deadline is approaching,\" the girl's message read. \"You'd better take your injection now. It is 2:30 A.M.\"  \"All right, prepare the hypodermics,\" directed the chemist. He had to repeat this in a falsetto voice before June understood. \"Make one for Jack too.\"  June went out at express-train speed.  Baron glanced at his watch again. The minute hand was moving with the speed at which the second hand usually traveled. Three fifteen already!  When he looked up June was in the room again with two hypodermic needles. Quickly she removed her father's coat and made the injection.  \"Let her fix you up too, boy, unless you want to become a graven image,\" commanded Manthis. His voice, which started at the ordinary pitch, went up like a siren at the end as the drug took effect. Dazedly Jack held out his arm.         *       *       *       *       *  The sting of the needle was followed by a roaring in his ears like a hundred Niagaras. The room seemed to pitch and quiver. Staring down at the watch he still clutched, Jack saw the hands slow down and at last resume their accustomed pace. Gradually the unpleasant sensations died away.  \"That was a close shave,\" commented the doctor, drawing a long breath. \"I wouldn't have waited so long, except that I wanted to experience the sensation of coming back from the edge of the infinite. Not very nice! Like being pulled out of a whirlpool. It's 4:30 now. Took us an hour to return to normal, although it seemed only minutes. We have an hour and a half before the end. June, have you noticed anything unusual on the streets?\"  \"Yes,\" whispered his daughter, her usually piquant face pinched and white. \"I've been watching from the balcony. It's dreadful. The people creep about like things in a nightmare.\"  Manthis tried to reassure her. On his face was a great sadness which was, however, overshadowed by a greater scientific curiosity.  \"There's nothing we can do for them now,\" he said. \"But we must learn all we can. Let's go down and watch the city die.\"  They descended in an automatic elevator and hurried through the hotel lobby. The lights of Fifth Avenue gleamed as brightly as ever. The streets near the lower end of Central Park still were crowded. But such crowds! They moved with infinite langour. Each step required many seconds.  Yet the people apparently did not know that anything unusual was happening. Many perhaps were puzzled because their watches seemed to be misbehaving but this did not stop their conversation as they traveled home from theaters or night clubs. Two white-haired men passed by, engaged in a discussion of business affairs. Their voices were pitched so low that they were almost inaudible to the trio of watchers, while their gestures looked like the slow waving of the antennae of deep sea plants.         *       *       *       *       *  \"My God, man!\" cried Baron, at last awakening from his horror-stricken silence. \"Why didn't you warn the world? This is criminal. If what you say is true, all these people will become rooted in their tracks at six o'clock like--like characters from 'The Sleeping Beauty.'\"  \"I only discovered the danger a week ago while working out a chemical formula.\" Manthis' eyes showed the strain he was enduring. \"It was a very delicate piece of work having to do with experiments I am making on chlorophyl--quick adjustments, you know. I'd done the thing before many times, but last week I couldn't mix the ingredients fast enough to get the necessary reaction. Puzzled, I made further experiments. The result was that I discovered my perception of time was slowing down. I tested June and found the same thing. There was but one conclusion.\"  \"But the drug we are using. How did you hit on that?\"  \"I recalled that such drugs as hashish greatly speed up the time sense. An addict is able to review his entire past life or plan an elaborate crime between two heartbeats. So I collected a small supply of the stuff.\"  \"But hashish in large doses is deadly, and I've heard that users of it sooner or later develop homicidal mania--run amuck as they say in India.\"  \"True enough,\" admitted the chemist, \"but Andrev, the Russian, you know, recently worked out a formula to neutralize the deadly effects of the drug but retain its time-expanding effect for medical purposes. I've added that to the pure drug. There isn't enough of it in New York to keep all these people normal for five minutes. Why should I have frightened the poor things?\"  He relapsed into silence and the others found no heart to ask further questions as they watched the coming of the end of a world. The procession of passers-by had thinned somewhat by now. The street lights had grown dim. There was a look of increasing puzzlement on the faces of the people who remained. Something was wrong. They knew not what.         *       *       *       *       *  Floating along the sidewalk like a figure in a slow motion picture came a tiny tot of three. She was sobbing. Great tears formed with painful slowness and slid down her flushed cheeks.  \"She's lost,\" exclaimed June. \"Here, darling, I'll find your mama.\"  She picked up the child and looked up and down the street. The mother was not in sight. Automatically she turned to a policeman who stood nearby.  \"Officer,\" she said quickly, \"this girl is lost. Will you...?\"  She stiffened in dismay. The policeman was staring through her as if his eyes had not registered her approach. Slowly his gaze came into focus. A puzzled look came over his Irish face. He spoke. It was only a blurred rumble.  \"What can I do for her, Father?\" June cried, turning away from the officer in despair. \"She's dying. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29410"],["title","The End of Time (#1)"],["body","See? Couldn't we give her some of the drug?\"  \"There's only enough for us,\" her father replied firmly.  \"But she'll be quite dead in an hour!\"  \"I'm not so sure of that. Perhaps only in a state resembling catalepsy. We must wait. Jack, take her into the lobby. Put her on a sofa there.\"  Dawn was paling the blue-black sky as the radio engineer returned. The street lights fluttered fitfully and at last died. The streets had become deserted although groups still eddied slowly about the subway kiosks.  \"Five forty-five,\" whispered Manthis. \"The end should come any moment.\"  As he spoke a white-garbed street sweeper, who had been leaning on his broom at the curb ever since the onlookers had reached the sidewalk, decided to move on at last. With infinite slowness his foot came up. He poised, swung forward, then, the universal paralysis overcoming him, remained in a strangely ludicrous position for a moment before crashing downward on his face.  As far as they could see in the semidarkness, others were falling. A few, balanced with feet wide apart, remained standing like statues. Those who collapsed writhed slowly a time or two and were still.  After the thudding of the bodies had ended the silence became ghastly. Not an awakening bird twittered in the trees of Central Park. Not a sheep bleated in the inclosure. Except for their own breathing and the sighing of the wind, not a sound! Then a faraway clock boomed six notes. The noise made them start and turn pale faces toward each other.  \"Come,\" said the doctor heavily. \"It's all over. We might as well go up. We'll have to walk. All power will be off. Twenty stories!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The lobby of the Hotel Atchison, on the roof of which the penthouse apartment was located, was empty now except for a few clerks and bellboys. These sat with bowed heads before their grills or on their benches as if they had merely succumbed to the unpardonable sin of sleeping on duty. But they did not breathe.  June clung to her father's arm as they crossed noiselessly over the heavy carpet.  \"The city will be a charnel house when these bodies start to decompose.\" Baron hesitated. \"Shouldn't we get out of town while there is a chance?\"  Manthis shook his head. \"No. I'm convinced these people aren't dead. They're simply outside of time. Change cannot affect them. If I'm not mistaken they will remain just the same indefinitely.\"  \"But there will be fires throughout the city.\"  \"Not many. The electricity is off. The day is warm so no furnaces are going. Not even a rat is left to nibble matches, for the animals must be affected in the same way that humans are. The world is asleep.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After mounting interminable stairs they regained the apartment and went out on the balcony. It was full daylight now but not a smoke-plume trailed from tall chimneys. Not a bird was on the wing. Elevated trains stood on their tracks, passengers and guards asleep inside.  \"I still don't understand,\" muttered Baron. \"The sun comes up. The wind blows. How can that be if there is no time? Might this not be some plague?\"  \"In a way you are right, boy. It is a plague which has paralyzed man's sense of time. You have become involved by not remembering Kant's axiom that time is purely subjective. It exists in the mind only. It and space are the only ideas inherently in our brains. They allow us to conduct ourselves among a vast collection of things-in-themselves which time does not affect.\"  \"But--\"  \"Wait a moment. Granting that time is in the mind rather than in the outside world, what will happen if the time-sense is paralyzed? Won't the effect be similar to hypnosis whereby a man is reduced to a cataleptic state? The thought chain which usually passes ceaselessly through the brain is halted.\"  Seeing that the engineer still looked puzzled, June interposed:  \"It's something like enchantment,\" she explained. \"The old legends are full of it--the Sleeping Beauty, Brunhilde, Rip Van Winkle. I am convinced that in ancient times a few persons knew how to draw a fairy ring about those they wished to injure or protect, placing them thus outside the reach of time and change. This has now happened the world over, perhaps through some drift in the ether or germ in the brain. That is what we must find out so we can solve the mystery and take steps to reawaken the world--\"  \"Perhaps this will help,\" interrupted Manthis in his turn. \"As you know, all the great scientists--Einstein, Jeans, Pavlov--are convinced that everything in the universe is a form of vibration. Even thought, they believe, operates somewhat like a very short radio wave. What if some agency, either inside or outside the universe, began interfering on the thought-wave channel?\"  \"Granting your supposition,\"--Jack was on his own ground now--\"transmission would be impossible on that channel.\"  \"Exactly! Well, that's what I am convinced is taking place. I'm a chemist, not an engineer. I've given you the lead. You'll have to do the rest. Do you think you might locate such interference?\"  \"Possibly. I'll do my best.\"  \"Fine! Of course, if it is coming from outside the stratosphere as the cosmic rays do, there is no hope. But if someone is broadcasting such a devilish wave from an earthly station we may have a chance to stop it.  \"Now, Baron, my boy,\" he continued, dropping into a more jovial tone and leading his friend into the laboratory, \"you'll have to get busy if you intend to keep us ticking. This equipment is at your disposal.\" He waved toward a newly installed short wave radio transmitter. \"Here are storage batteries, all charged.\" He opened another door. \"I have a five kilowatt generator installed here. It is operated by a gasoline engine. If you need other equipment you can raid the Rothafel plant.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Returning to the main laboratory he indicated the work table set close to a great double window overlooking Central Park.  \"Couldn't ask for anything better, could you?\" he smiled. \"Plenty of light and air and a view of the city. Look, you can even see those poor devils lying around the subway kiosk.\" His face became bleak. Then he shrugged and tried to throw off his depression. \"June and I will help you as much as we can. We can raid stores for provisions and hashish. New let's have breakfast.\"  The next few days were filled with unending labor for the temporal castaways. From daybreak until far into the night, with radio receivers clamped over their ears, the three twisted dials, adjusted rheostats and listened in on long and short wave bands. But the ether, which once had pulsated with music and friendly voices, now was silent, except for static.  \"Makes me think of Sunday mornings when I was a boy,\" Manthis once commented. \"Only this is more quiet. It gives me the jitters.\" There was a note of hysteria in his voice.  When the doctor's nerves began to quiver in that manner, Baron always insisted that they all rest. During such recesses they ate, played cards and helped June with the housework. The younger man was continually amazed by the calmness with which the girl faced their desperate situation. Clad in a blue smock which brought out the color of her eyes, she flitted about the apartment, manufacturing delicious meals out of canned goods and always having a cheery word when the others became discouraged. Yet she never would look out the window.  \"I can't bear to see those poor souls lying about like rag dolls,\" she explained. \"The only thing that keeps me sane is the hope that we may reawaken them.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was on the evening of the third day that Baron lifted the headset from his burning ears and admitted failure.  \"We've explored everything but the super-short waves,\" he sighed. \"I'll have to get equipment from the laboratories before we start on those.\"  June nodded from where she perched on a high stool across the table. But Manthis did not hear. He was making delicate adjustments on his receiving set and listening with rapt attention.  \"I've got something,\" he cried. \"Jack. June. Plug in on my panel. Someone is talking. It's very loud. Must be close.\"  Instantly the others did as he ordered, but were able to catch only the last inflections of a ringing voice. Then silence settled once more.  \"What did he say,\" the youngsters cried in one breath.  \"Couldn't understand. Some foreign language.\" The chemist was furious with disappointment. \"But I'd recognize that voice among a thousand. We must get in touch with him. Perhaps he can help us. God knows we need assistance. Quick, Jack. You're an expert. See if you can pick up a reply.\"  Baron leaned over his instruments, heart thumping. The dreadful loneliness against which he had been fighting was broken. Others were alive!  Minutes passed and the evening light died away. They were too excited to strike a light. Shadows crept out of the corners and surrounded them. At last a faint voice grew in their ears. But again the words were unintelligible.  \"Sounds a little like Greek,\" puzzled the girl, \"but it isn't.\"  Baron adjusted the direction finder and made scribbled calculations.  \"Coming from the southeast and far away,\" he breathed.  \"I caught a word then,\" gasped the doctor. \"'Ganja,' it was.\"  \"What does that tell us?\" snapped Jack, his nerves jumping.  \"Ganja is the Hindu word for hashish, that's all. My Lord, man, don't you understand? The station is in India. Those who operate it are using Andrev's solution as we are. I--\"  \"Listen!\" shouted Jack.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a grinding and clashing in the receivers. Then a new voice, harsh and strained with excitement, almost burst their eardrums.  \"Beware! Beware!\" it screamed. \"Do not trust him. He is a devil and has put the world asleep. His mind is rotten with hashish. He is a demon from--\" Then came a dull, crunching sound. The voice screamed and died away.  In the darkened"]]]
