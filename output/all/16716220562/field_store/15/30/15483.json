June crept close to him and threw an arm around his shaking shoulders. \"Can't you see? Their time-sense expanded too. Like us they were unaffected. But unlike us they use the pure drug. Hashish smokers are without exception homicidal maniacs, vicious criminals. God!\"  \"Are they responsible for the end of time?\" queried Jack.  \"I don't know. Perhaps some master mind among them is back of it--some engineering wizard who has succumbed to the drug so recently, or who has such a strong constitution that his intelligence has not been destroyed.\"  The little doctor dragged off his headset, disarranging his sparse gray hair. His face was tired and worn but his jaw thrust forward pugnaciously.  \"We're making headway,\" he cried. \"We know the probable author of the catastrophe is a drug addict and that he is located nearby. We know he has no scruples, for the man who warned us undoubtedly was killed. And I'm convinced those extremely short wave bands hold the secret. Let's knock off for the day. We look like ghosts. To-morrow morning you and June get what equipment you need from across the river. I'll stay here on guard. You'd better raid a drug-store and get some more of our life-saver, too. It's listed under Cannabis Indica.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The next morning dawned clear and cold. It was early October and there was a chill in the apartment. Baron swung his legs over the edge of the davenport in the living room and stared out at the frost-covered trees of Central Park. The leaves were falling before the brisk wind and forming little eddying mounds over the forms of those lying about the streets. Jack shivered at the thought of the millions and millions of victims of the disaster who littered the Earth. They seemed to accuse him of still being alive. Well, if Manthis was right, perhaps all could be revived before winter set in.  June was singing as he and the doctor came to breakfast. Apparently she wished to forget the events of the previous night, so they laughed and joked as though they intended to go on a picnic rather than across a dead city.  The hotel lobby was as they last had seen it when they descended. The bellboys still nodded on their benches. A travelling salesman was hunched over a week-old Times as if he would awake in a few minutes, glance about guiltily and resume his reading. The child they had rescued still lay on the divan. Her golden hair framed her cheeks like a halo. One arm was thrown above her head. She seemed ready to awake, though she had not breathed for days.  \"It all makes me feel so lonely,\" whispered June, clinging to the engineer's arm. \"I want to cry--or whistle to keep up my courage.\"  \"Don't worry,\" Jack replied softly, patting her hand and speaking with more assurance than he felt. \"We'll find a way out.\"  She squeezed his arm and smiled at him with new courage. For months, in fact ever since his first visit to the Manthis apartment, Baron had admired the doctor's charming daughter. Although nothing had been said of love between them they often had gone to a dance or the theater together, while a firm friendship had been cemented. Now their closer association and the unflinching bravery which she showed was ripening this into a stronger bond.         *       *       *       *       *  They went out into the crisp morning, stepped across the body of a street sweeper who lay in the gutter, and entered the doctor's automobile. Through the silent city they drove, Baron watching carefully to avoid striking stalled cars or grotesquely sprawling bodies.  There was a tangle of wrecked automobiles in the center of the Queensboro Bridge and they were forced to push them apart to get through. While they were engaged in this arduous work, a drifting ferry bumped into a pier, shaking the dreaming captain into a semblance of life at the wheel.  \"I used to like fairy tales,\" moaned June. \"They're dreadful, really.\"  She clung to him like a frightened child. He drew her close and kissed her.  \"I love you, June,\" he whispered, as though fearful that the sleeping drivers of the tangled cars might overhear. \"Don't be afraid.\"  \"I'm not--now,\" she smiled through eyes filled with tears. \"I've loved you for months, Jack. Whatever happens, we have each other.\"  He helped her back into the car and drove on in silence. At last the Rothafel plant gloomed before them, forbidding as an Egyptian tomb. With a feeling that he was entering some forbidden precinct, Jack led the way to his office. Somehow, without its usual bustle and bright lights, it seemed alien.  Once inside he forgot his hesitation and set about collecting equipment--queerly shaped neon tubes, reflectors, coils, electrodes. Soon there was a pile of material glinting on top of his desk.  They were exploring a deep cabinet with the aid of a flashlight when a strange clicking sound made them whirl simultaneously. In a corner of the room a deeper blot of shadow caught their eyes. Jack snapped on the flash. In the small circle of light a long, cadaverous face appeared. Thin lips were drawn back over wide-spaced yellow teeth. Black eyes stared unwinkingly into the light. The flash wavered as the engineer tried to get his nerves under control.  \"It's nothing,\" he assured the trembling girl. \"A night watchman caught as he was making his rounds, probably. Don't get excited.\" He wet his lips.  \"He's alive!\" screamed June. \"The eyelids! They moved!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Yes, I'm alive,\" boomed a hoarse voice. \"I thought I was the only man God had spared. Pardon me for frightening you. I was so thunderstruck....\"  The stranger stepped forward. He was dressed in a long black topcoat, high collar and string tie. The clicking noise was explained when he rubbed his long white hands together, making the knuckles pop like tiny firecrackers.  \"Ivan Solinski, at your service.\" He smiled with what evidently was intended to be warmth, again showing those rows of teeth like picket fences. \"I suppose we're all here on the same mission: to find a solution for the mystery of the world's paralysis.\" The apparition lit a long and bloated cigarette and through the acrid smoke surveyed them quizzically.  \"I'm Jack Baron, formerly on the staff here, and this is June Manthis, daughter of Dr. Frank Manthis, head of the chemical research department.\" The engineer winced as Solinski enfolded his hand in a clammy grip.  \"Ah yes, I know the doctor by hearsay. A great scientist. He has a lovely daughter\"--bowing deeply to June as he let his beady eyes wander over her face and figure. \"Perhaps we can join forces, although I must admit I have abandoned hope. It is God's will.\" He rolled his eyes toward heaven, then riveted them once more upon June.  \"Why, certainly.\" Jack was striving to overcome his growing dislike. \"We'll be driving back in a few minutes. Would you care to come with us?\"  \"No.\" The pupilless eyes skittered toward Baron for a moment. \"I know the doctor's address. I will come to visit you soon. Now I must be going.\" Solinski turned as if to depart, then strode to the desk and looked down at the mass of equipment. \"Ah, super-short wave tubes, I see. Very clever.\" His dexterous fingers lingered over them a moment. Then he bowed and was gone.         *       *       *       *       *  The two remained staring at the empty doorway.  \"I--I wish he'd been dead--sleeping,\" whispered June at last, twisting her handkerchief with trembling fingers. \"He--I didn't like the way he kept looking at me.\"  \"He seemed all right to me.\" Jack tried to forget his own prejudice. \"He's willing to help us.\"  \"Might he not be one of the hashish addicts? Those eyes--the pupils were mere pinpoints--and those evil-smelling cigarettes.\"  \"Then why should he have offered to help?\" puzzled Jack. \"He could have killed us.\"  \"Nevertheless I hope we've seen the last of him. Are you about through? Let's get out of this awful place. He looked like a mummy!\"  They drove back to the apartment so completely preoccupied that both forgot to obtain the drug which the doctor had requested.  \"Yes, I've heard of him,\" Manthis said after he had been informed of the encounter. \"A naturalized Russian. Used to do quite a bit of valuable work in various fields of physics. But he was some sort of radical--seems to me an old-fashioned anarchist--and not popular. He dropped out of sight several years ago. I presumed he was dead.\"  They soon had the new equipment installed and again began exploring the wave bands, beginning with the comparatively lengthy ones and working down into those only slightly longer than light. It was tedious work, but all were by now as adept as Jack in combing the ether and their task progressed rapidly. Despite the labor, however, nothing could be heard. There was only the universal, breathless silence. At times they moved to the commercial bands and tried to pick up the stations they had heard on the previous day, but even there they met with failure.         *       *       *       *       *  By the evening of the third day they had left the wave bands which could be measured in meters and were exploring those strange and almost wholly uncharted depths of the ether which must be calculated in centimeters. There at last luck favored them. It was Jack who caught a strange pulsating tone on the three-centimeter band. It rose and fell, rose and fell, then died away like the keening of a lost soul.  \"Listen,\" he whispered. \"Plug in here. I've found something.\"  June and the doctor followed his instructions. Delicately fingering the coils, Baron picked up the sound again, only to lose it. Then it came once more. This time he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29410"],["title","The End of Time (#3)"],["body","it as it changed to the five centimeter band. Back and forth it went as though weaving an intricate and devilish web.  \"What do you make of it?\" queried the doctor at last.  \"Don't know.\" Jack bit his lips. \"It's no natural phenomenon, I'll swear. Somebody is manipulating a broadcasting station of terrific power not far from here and playing with that wave as a helmsman brings a sailing ship into the wind and lets her pay off again.\"  \"What do we do now?\" The little chemist, finding his theory apparently confirmed, was at a loss. \"Could we wreck that station?\"  \"Fat chance!\" The engineer laughed bitterly as he reached for a cigarette. \"Whoever has conceived that bit of hellishness is well guarded. The three of us wouldn't have a ghost of a show. What I can't understand is--\"  \"No use talking about theories now.\" Manthis sat down, crushed. Dropping his head in his bands, he pulled his few hairs as though that might drag out an idea. \"What's to be done? Do you realise that we hold more responsibility than ever man has held before? Caesar! Napoleon! They were pikers. We have to save a world.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Silence greeted his outburst. The scratching of a match as June lit a cigarette sounded like an explosion. Then the smoke eddied undisturbed while the three stared vacantly into space, trying to think.  \"Couldn't we\"--the girl swallowed hesitantly as she realized her ignorance of radio engineering--\"couldn't we interfere with that wave? Interfere with the wave which already is breaking up the thought waves. Cancel its power. Oh, Jack, you must know what I mean.\"  \"With this dinky, five-kilowatt station? We couldn't reach Yonkers against the power they've got. By Jove!\" He leaped to his feet as a new thought struck him. \"Maybe we could just wake up New York. Get help from the police then! Smash that other station afterwards!\"  \"But we don't know whether interference would break the spell,\" interposed the practical doctor. \"And it will take a lot of practise to follow that wave. It jumps back and forth like a grasshopper.\"  \"And if we don't do it right the first time, whoever is operating that station will be down on us like a ton of brick,\" admitted Jack.  \"Let's get the child we saved,\" suggested June. \"We can bring her up here. Then we'll need only a little power, just enough to be effective in this room, to bring her to life if we can. They wouldn't hear our wave.\"  \"Great!\" Jack bent over and kissed her. \"You're a real help. I'll be back in a minute.\" He dashed out. Soon they heard his step on the stairs and he reappeared, tenderly bearing his golden-haired burden.  \"Now, June,\" he commanded briskly, \"place her in a comfortable position on the work table while I get ready.\" He began arranging equipment and connecting it with the bank of storage batteries.  \"Shall I adjust a headset for her?\" asked the impatient doctor.  \"Be yourself!\" Jack placed a crooked vacuum tube near the child's head and clamped two flat electrodes on her temples. \"This wave must act directly on the brain. The sense of hearing has nothing to do with it.  \"All right, Sleeping Beauty.\" He stretched the kinks out of his aching back. \"Let's see what we can do for you. Pardon me, Doctor, if I seemed rude. This is ticklish work. Pick up the outside wave for me. Thanks. Now I've got our dinky sending station set on the same wave length at a different frequency. It's adjusted so that as I keep in touch through this tuning coil, our wave will fluctuate over the same path as the other. It should take six or eight hours to overcome the effect on her, I judge. Here we go. June, you'd better get yourself and your dad some food. Doctor, you examine the kid from time to time. In an hour or so June can relieve me.\"  He pressed a switch. The tubes filled with a green glow.         *       *       *       *       *  Two hours passed, and the sun was sinking behind the trees of the park in a bloody haze when Jack at last signaled for June to handle the dials. For a time he guided her slim fingers. Then, as she caught the trick, he rose and stretched his cramped muscles.  \"Don't lose the wave for a moment or we'll have to start all over again,\" he warned. \"Now for dinner!\"  She nodded and, frowning slightly, bent over the dials.  At that moment there came a heavy knock on the apartment door.  \"Who's that?\" gasped Manthis, his face turning grey.  \"Probably Solinski,\" replied Jack, feeling his spine crawl as he remembered the moldy Russian. \"Fine time he chose for a visit.\"  \"Shall I let him in?\"  \"Don't see what else there is to do.\"  \"Good evening,\" cried their guest as Manthis opened the door. \"Ah, Dr. Manthis, I believe. I have heard so much about your work.\" His hoarse yet ringing voice made the little man start violently and caused June to shake her head in annoyance as the sound interfered with the humming of the vagrant wave. \"Sorry I could not come earlier.\" Solinski advanced into the laboratory, giving the effect of driving the chemist before him. \"Trying to revive one of the sufferers, I see. May God aid you in this noble work.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He spread the tails of his long coat and sat down. As he talked his eyes flashed about the room, taking in every detail and at last fastening on June's fresh beauty like those of a vampire. \"Not,\" he boomed as he lighted a cigarette, \"not that I believe it possible--\"  Catching an agonized glance from Jane, Jack interrupted:  \"You'll have to speak softly, sir. This is ticklish work.\"  \"I beg your pardon.\" The Russian lowered his voice so that it squeaked piercingly like a rusty hinge. He wrung his hands audibly.  \"Perhaps we'd better move into the living room,\" suggested the doctor, hovering in the background. \"There we can talk without interrupting.\"  Their guest unfolded joint by joint like a collapsible rule.  \"Of course, if you think I'm spying,\" he grated.  \"Not at all,\" protested Jack, although he longed to strike the brute across the face. \"It's just that voices of certain pitches interfere. Surely you have seen radio operators go all to pieces when spoken to.\"  Ungraciously Solinski allowed himself to be ushered into the outer room. Once there he disposed his lean form on another chair, unctuously refused a highball, and, forgetting his momentary anger, soon was deep in a scientific discussion of the problems involved in revivifying the world.  He mentioned the nearby radio station but declared that he had been unable to locate it despite a careful search. Dismissing this he turned to other topics, displaying a vast knowledge of all departments of scientific achievement and, despite his depressing personality, holding his bearer's attention so closely they forgot the passage of time until the clock struck ten.  \"Time for daily injection,\" said the doctor. \"Do you use Andrev's solution too, sir?\"  \"Naturally,\" replied the other, lighting one cigarette from the butt of another.  Manthis hurried into the laboratory. A few moments later he reappeared in the doorway and called to Jack in an agitated voice. As the younger man joined him he closed the door and turned a white face to him.  \"The drug is almost gone,\" Manthis said. \"Didn't you obtain a new supply?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"We--I forgot it,\" admitted Jack, feeling his own face grow pale. \"The shock of running across Solinski at the laboratory upset me.\"  \"Well, that's all right, then. It gave me a turn, but we have plenty of time.\" The doctor laughed shakily. \"Run down to the nearest drug store. There should be a supply there. Better take a flashlight.\"  He pushed open the door, then shrank back. Leaning against the jamb was the Russian. His manner had changed subtly. His thin lips spread from ear to ear in a wolfish grin. His fingers clicked like castanets.  \"Ah,\" he purred. \"So you have used up the last of your solution?\"  \"What's that to you?\" The doctor was gripped by cold unreasoning fear.  \"Only that you will be unable to obtain more. Since my first meeting with your daughter I have had my men collect all the Cannabis Indica in the city.\"  \"Your men!\" Manthis was thunderstruck.  \"Certainly, you old fool. Do you think I'm a bungling theorist like yourself? Who do you think is operating that short-wave station? I am. Who do you think put the world to sleep? I did. Who do you think will wake it? I will.\"  Solinski's figure appeared to expand. He took deep drafts from his cigarette. The smoke seemed to impel some terrific force into his gaunt frame.  \"So it was your voice I heard!\" cried Manthis bitterly. \"And those awful tales about you were true. A hashish smoker! A person whose mind is rotting, in control of the world!\" He seemed about to leap at the other, and his chubby figure, in that attitude, would have seemed ludicrous if it had not been tragic. \"It shall not be!\" he shouted.  \"Now see here, Doctor\"--Solinski assumed a friendly tone--\"you're making a grave mistake. I have something to offer better than you ever dreamed of.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Just this. How would you like to be assistant to the King of the World?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Crazy already,\" sneered the doctor, squinting up at his tormentor.  \"Crazy or not, when the world awakes I will be its king.\"  \"Why, damn you, I thought you were an anarchist and wanted to do away with kings and governments,\" sputtered the little man.  Solinski burst into a gale of fiendish laughter.  \"An anarchist is merely a capitalist without money or power,\" he quoted.  \"What do you want of us?\" demanded Manthis, playing for time.  \"Very simple. This: I intend soon to begin awakening those who will serve me, first in New York and then throughout the world. When I have a skeleton government built up, I will withdraw the wave and allow the people to revive. Clever, isn't it? Especially for such a madman as you think me.\" He snapped his fingers and leered cunningly at them.  The doctor choked but "]]]
