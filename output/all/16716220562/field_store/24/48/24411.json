Half a pound of shelled sweet almonds.   A quarter of a pound of shelled bitter almonds.   The whites of three eggs.   Twenty-four large tea-spoonfuls of powdered loaf-sugar.   A tea-spoonful of rose-water.   A large tea-spoonful of mixed spice, nutmeg, mace and cinnamon.  Blanch and pound your almonds, beat them very smooth, and mix the sweet and bitter together; do them, if you can, the day before you make the maccaroons. Pound and sift your spice. Beat the whites of three eggs till they stand alone; add to them, very gradually, the powdered sugar, a spoonful at a time, beat it in very hard, and put in, by degrees, the rose-water and spice. Then stir in, gradually, the almonds. The mixture must be like a soft dough; if too thick, it will be heavy; if too thin, it will run out of shape. If you find your almonds not sufficient, prepare a few more, and stir them in. When it is all well mixed and stirred, put some flour in the palm of your hand, and taking up a lump of the mixture with a knife, roll it on your hand with the flour into a small round ball; have ready an iron or tin pan, buttered, and lay the maccaroons in it, as you make them up. Place them about two inches apart, in case of their spreading. Bake them about eight or ten minutes in a moderate oven; they should be baked of a pale brown colour. If too much baked, they will lose their flavour; if too little, they will be heavy. They should rise high in the middle, and crack on the surface. You may, if you choose, put a larger proportion of spice. [Footnote: Cocoa-nut cakes may be made in a similar manner, substituting for the pounded almonds half a pound of finely-grated cocoa-nut. They mast be made into small round balls with a little flour laid on the palm of the hand, and baked a few minutes. They are very fine.]   APEES.    A pound of flour, sifted.   Half a pound of butter.   Half a glass of wine, and a table-spoon of rose-water mixed.   Half a pound of powdered white sugar.   A nutmeg, grated.   A tea-spoonful of beaten cinnamon and mace.   Three table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.  Sift the flour into a broad pan, and cut up the butter in it. Add the carraways, sugar, and spice, and pour in the liquor by degrees, mixing it well with a knife; add enough of cold water to make it a stiff dough. Spread some flour on your pasteboard, take out the dough, and knead it very well with your hands. Cut it into small pieces, and knead each separately, then put them all together, and knead the whole in one lump. Roll it out in a sheet about a quarter of an inch thick. Cut it out in round cakes, with the edge of a tumbler, or a tin of that size. Butter an iron pan, and lay the cakes in it, not too close together. Bake them a few minutes in a moderate oven, till they are very slightly coloured, but not brown. If too much baked, they will entirely lose their flavour. Do not roll them out too thin.   JUMBLES.    Three eggs.   Half a pound of flour, sifted.   Half a pound of butter.   Half a pound of powdered loaf-sugar.   A table-spoonful of rose-water.   A nutmeg grated.   A tea-spoonful of mixed mace and cinnamon.  Stir the sugar and butter to a cream. Beat the eggs very light. Throw them, all at once, into the pan of flour. Put in, at once, the butter and sugar, and then add the spice and rose-water. If you have no rose-water, substitute six or seven drops of strong essence of lemon, or more if the essence is weak. Stir the whole very hard, with a knife.  Spread some flour on your paste-board, and flour your hands well. Take up with your knife, a portion of the dough, and lay it on the board. Roll it lightly with your hands, into long shin rolls, which must be cut into equal lengths, curled up into rings, and laid gently into an iron or tin pan, buttered, not too close to each other, as they spread in baking. Bake them in a quick oven about five minutes, and grate loaf-sugar over them when cool.   KISSES.    One pound of the best loaf sugar, powdered and sifted.   The whites of four eggs.   Twelve drops of essence of lemon.   A tea-cup of currant jelly.  Beat the whites of four eggs till they stand alone. Then heat in, gradually, the sugar, a tea-spoonful at a time. Add the essence of lemon, and beat the whole very hard.  Lay a wet sheet of paper on the bottom of a square tin pan. Drop on it, at equal distances, a small tea-spoonful of stiff currant jelly. [Footnote: It is better to put a little of the beaten white of egg and sugar at first under the currant jelly.] With a large spoon, pile some of the beaten white of egg and sugar, on each lump of jelly, so as to cover it entirely. Drop on the mixture as evenly as possible, so as to make the kisses of a round smooth shape.  Set them in a cool open, and as soon as they are coloured, they are done. Then take them out and place them two bottoms together. Lay them lightly on sieve, and dry them in a cool oven, till the two bottoms stick fast together, so as to form one ball or oval.   SPANISH BUNS.    Four eggs.   Three quarters of a pound of flour, sifted.   Half a pound of powdered white sugar.   Two wine-glasses and a half of rich milk.   Six ounces of fresh butter.   A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.   A table-spoonful of rose-water.   A grated nutmeg.   A large tea-spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon.  Sift half a pound of flour into a broad pan, and sift a quarter of a pound, separately, into a deep plate, and set it aside. Put the milk into a soup-plate, cut up the butter, and set it on the stove or near the fire to warm, but do not let it get too hot. When the butter is very soft, stir it all through the milk with a knife, and set it away to cool. Beat the eggs very light, and mix the milk and butter with them, all at once; then pour all into the pan of flour. Put in the spice, and the rose-water, or if you prefer it, eight drops of essence of lemon. Add the yeast, of which an increased quantity will be necessary, if it is not very strong and fresh. Stir the whole very hard, with a knife. Add the sugar gradually. If the sugar is not stirred in slowly, a little at a time, the buns will be heavy. Then, by degrees, sprinkle in the renaming quarter of a pound of flour. Stir all well together; butter a square iron pan, and put in the mixture. Cover it with a cloth, and set it near the fire to rise. It will probably not be light in less than five hours. When it is risen very high, and is covered with bubbles, bake it in a moderate oven, about a quarter of an hour or more in proportion to its thickness.  When it is quite cool, cut it in squares, and grate loaf-sugar over them. This quantity will make twelve or fifteen buns.  They are best the day they are baked.  You may, if you choose, bake them separately, in small square tins, adding to the baiter half a pound of currants or chopped raisins, well floured, and stirred in at the last.  In making buns, stir the yeast well before you put it in, having first poured off the beer or thin part from the top. If your yeast is not good, do not attempt to make buns with it, as they will never be light.  Buns may be made in a plainer way, with the following ingredients, mixed in the above manner.     Half a pound of flour, sifted into a pan.   A quarter of a pound of flour, sifted in a plate, and set aside to     sprinkle in at the last.   Three eggs, well beaten.   A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.   Three wine-glasses of milk.   A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.   A quarter of a pound of butter, cut up, and warmed in the milk.   RUSK.    A quarter of a pound of powdered sugar.   A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.   One pound of flour sifted.   One egg.   Three wine-glasses of milk.   A wine-glass and a half of the best yeast.   A table-spoonful of rose-water.   A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.  Sift your flour into a pan. Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm them a little, so as to soften the butter, but not to melt it entirely. Beat your egg; pour the milk and butter into your pan of flour, then the egg, then the rose-water and spice, and lastly the yeast. Stir all well together with a knife.  Spread some flour on your paste-board: lay the dough on it, and knead it well. Then divide it into small pieces of an equal size, and knead each piece into a little thick round cake. Butter an iron pan, lay the cakes in it, and set them in a warm place to rise. Prick the tops with a fork. When they are quite light, bake them in a moderate oven.   INDIAN POUND CAKE.    Eight eggs.   One pint of powdered sugar.   One pint of Indian meal, sifted, and half a pint of wheat-flour.   Half a pound of butter.   One nutmeg, grated,--and a tea-spoonful of cinnamon.   Half a glass of mixed wine and brandy.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the eggs very light. Stir the meal and eggs, alternately, into the butter and sugar. Add the spice and liquor. Stir all well. Butter a tin pan, put in the mixture, and bake it in a moderate oven.  This cake should be eaten while fresh.   CUP CAKE.    Five eggs.   Two large tea-cups full of molasses.   The same of brown sugar rolled fine.   The same of fresh butter.   One cup of rich milk.   Five cups of flour sifted.   Half a cup of powdered allspice and cloves.   Half a cup of ginger.  Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm them slightly. Warm also the molasses, and stir it into the milk and butter: then stir in, gradually, the sugar, and set it away to get cool.  Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the mixture alternately with the flour. Add the ginger and other spice, and stir the whole very hard.  Butter small tins, nearly fill them with the mixture, and bake the cakes in a moderate oven.    LOAF CAKE.    Two pounds of sifted flour, setting aside half a pound to     sprinkle in at the last.   One pound of fresh butter.   One pound of powdered sugar.   Four eggs.   One pound of raisins, stoned, and cut in half.   One pound of currants, washed and dried."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6677"],["title","Seventy-Five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes and Sweetmeats, (#8)"],["body","a pint of milk.   Half a glass of wine.   Half a glass of brandy.   A tablespoon of mixed spice, mace, nutmeg, and cinnamon.   Half a pint of the best brewer's yeast; or more, if the     yeast is not very strong.  Cut up the butter in the milk, and warm it till the butter is quite soft; then stir it together, and set it away to cool. It must not be made too warm. After you have beaten the eggs, mix them with the butter and milk, and stir the whole into the pan of flour. Add the spice and liquor, and stir in the sugar gradually. Having poured off the thin part from the top, stir the yeast, and pour it into the mixture. Then sprinkle in the remainder of the flour.  Have ready the fruit, which must be well floured, stir it gradually into the mixture. Butter a large tin pan, and put the cake into it. Cover it, and set in a warm place for five or six hours to rise. When quite light, bake it in a moderate oven.   SUGAR BISCUITS.    Three pounds of flour, sifted.   One pound of butter.   A pound and a half of powdered sugar.   Half a pint of milk.   Two table-spoonfuls of brandy.   A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in water.   Four table-spoonfuls of carraway seeds.  Cut the butter into the flour. Add the sugar and carraway seeds. Pour in the brandy, and then the milk. Lastly, put in the pearl-ash. Stir all well with a knife, and mix it thoroughly, till it becomes a lump of dough.  Flour your paste-board, and lay the dough on it. Knead it very well. Divide it into eight or ten pieces, and knead each piece separately. Then put them all together, and knead them very well in one lump.  Cut the dough in half, and roll it out into sheets, about half an inch thick. Beat the sheets of dough very hard, on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Cut them out into round cakes with the edge of a tumbler. Butter iron pans, and lay the cakes in them. Bake them a very pale brown. If done too much, they will lose their taste.  These cakes kept in a stone jar, closely covered from the air, will continue perfectly good for several months.   MILK BISCUITS.    Two pounds of flour, sifted.   Half a pound of butter.   Two eggs.   Six wine-glasses of milk.   Two wine-glasses of the best brewer's yeast, or three     of good home-made yeast.  Cut the butter into the milk, and warm it slightly on the top of the stove, or near the fire. Sift the flour into a pan, and pour the milk and butter into it. Beat the eggs, and pour them in also. Lastly the yeast. Mix all well together with a knife.  Flour your paste-board, put the lump of dough on it, and knead it very hard. Then cut the dough in small pieces, and knead them into round balls. Stick the tops of them with a fork.  Lay them in buttered pans and set them to rise. They will probably be light in an hour. When they are quite light, put them in a moderate oven and bake them.  They are best when quite fresh.   BUTTER BISCUITS.    Half a pound of butter.   Two pounds of flour, sifted   Half a pint of milk, or cold water.   A salt-spoonful of salt.  Cut up the butter in the flour, and put the salt to it. Wet it to a stiff dough with the milk or water. Mix it well with a knife.  Throw some flour on the paste-board, take the dough out of the pan, and knead it very well.  Roll it out into a large thick sheet, and beat it very hard on both sides with the rolling-pin. Beat it a long time.  Cut it out with a tin, or cup, into small round thick cakes. Beat each cake on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Prick them, with a fork. Put them in buttered pans, and bake them of a light brown in a slow oven.   GINGERBREAD NUTS    Two pounds of flour, sifted.   One pound of fresh butter.   One quart of sugar-house molasses.   Two ounces of ginger, or more, if it is not very strong.   Twelve dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted   Six dozen cloves, powdered and sifted.   Half an ounce of cinnamon, powdered and sifted.   A half tea-spoonful of pearl-ash or salaeratus, dissolved in a     little vinegar.  Cut up the butter in the flour, and mix it with the ginger and other spice. Wet the whole with the molasses, and stir all well together with a knife. Then add the dissolved pearl-ash or salaeratus.  Throw some flour on your paste-board, take the dough (a large handful at a time) and knead it in separate cakes. Then put all together, and knead It very hard for a long time, in one large lump. Cut the lump in half, roll it out in two even sheets, about half an inch thick, and cut it out in little cakes, with a very small tin, about the size of a cent. Lay them in buttered pans, and bake them in a moderate oven, taking care they do not scorch, as gingerbread is more liable to burn than any other cake,  You may, if you choose, shape the gingerbread nuts, by putting flour in your hand, taking a very small piece of the dough, and rolling it into a little round ball.   COMMON GINGERBREAD.    A pint of molasses.   One pound of fresh butter.   Two pounds and a half of flour, sifted.   A pint of milk,   A small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, or less if it is strong.   A tea-cup full of ginger.  Cut the butter into the flour. Add the ginger. Having dissolved the pearl-ash in a little vinegar, stir it with the milk and molasses alternately into the other ingredients. Stir it very hard for a long lime, till it is quite light.  Put some flour on your paste-board, take out small portions of the dough, and make it with your hand into long rolls. Then curl up the rolls into round cakes, or twist two rolls together, or lay them in straight lengths or sticks side by side, and touching each other. Put them carefully in buttered pans, and bake them in a moderate oven, not hot enough to burn them. If they should get scorched, scrape off with a knife, or grater, all the burnt parts, before you put the cakes away.  You can, if you choose, cut out the dough with tins, in the shape of hearts, circles, ovals, &c. or you may bake it all in one, and cut it in squares when cold.  If the mixture appears to be too thin, add, gradually, a little more sifted flour.   LAFAYETTE GINGERBREAD    Five eggs.   Half a pound of brown sugar.   Half a pound of fresh butter.   A pint of sugar-house molasses   A pound and a half of flour.   Four table-spoonfuls of ginger.   Two large sticks of cinnamon, powered and sifted.   Three dozen grains of allspice, powdered and sifted.   Three dozen of cloves, powdered and sifted.   The juice and grated peel of two large lemons.   A little pearl-ash or salaeratus.  Stir the butter and sugar to a cream. Beat the eggs very well. Pour the molasses, at once, into the butter and sugar. Add the ginger and other spice, and stir all well together.  Put in the egg and flour alternately, stirring all the time. Stir the whole very hard, and put in the lemon at the last. When the whole is mixed, stir it till very light.  Butter an earthen pan, or a thick tin or iron one, and put the gingerbread in it. Bake it in a moderate oven, an hour or more, according to its thickness. Take care that it do not burn.  Or you may bake it in small cakes, or little tins.  Its lightness will be much improved by a small tea-spoonful of pearl-ash dissolved in a tea-spoonful of vinegar, and stirred lightly in at the last. [Footnote: If the pearl-ash is strong, half a tea-spoonful will be sufficient, or less even will do. It is better stir the pearl-ash in, a little at a time, and you can tell by the taste of the mixture, when there is enough.] Too much pearl-ash, will give it an unpleasant taste.  If you use pearl-ash, you must omit the lemon, as its taste will be entirely destroyed by the pearl-ash. You may substitute for the lemon, some raisins and currants, well floured to prevent their sinking.  This is the finest of all gingerbread, but should not be kept long, as in a few days it becomes very hard and stale.   A DOVER CAKE.    Half a pint of milk.   A half tea-spoonful of pearl-ash, dissolved in a little vinegar.   One pound of sifted flour.   One pound of powdered white sugar.   Half a pound of butter.   Six eggs.   One glass of brandy.   Half a glass of rose-water.   One grated nutmeg.   A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.  Dissolve the pearl-ash in vinegar. Stir the sugar and butter to a cream, and add to it gradually, the spice and liquor. Beat the eggs very light, and stir them into the butter and sugar, alternately, with the flour. Add, gradually, the milk, and stir the whole very hard.  Butter a large tin pan, and put in the mixture. Bake it two hours or more, in a moderate oven. If not thick, an hour or an hour and a half will be sufficient.  Wrap it in a thick cloth, and keep it from the air, and it will continue moist and fresh for two weeks. The pearl-ash will give it a dark colour.  It will be much improved by a pound of raisins, stoned and cut in half, and a pound of currants, well washed and dried.  Flour the fruit well, and stir it in at the last.   CRULLERS.    Half a pound of butter.   Three quarters of a pound of powdered white sugar.   Six eggs, or seven if they are small.   Two pounds of flour, sifted.   A grated nutmeg.   A tea-spoonful of powdered cinnamon.   A table-spoonful of rose-water.  Cut the butter into the flour, add the sugar and spice, and mix them well together.  Beat the eggs and pour them into the pan of flour, &c. Add the rose water, and mix the whole into a dough. If the eggs and rose-water are not found sufficient to wet it, add a very little cold water. Mix the dough very well with a knife.  Spread some flour on your paste-board, take the dough out of the pan, and knead it very well. Cut it into small pieces, and knead each separately. Put all the pieces together, and knead the whole in one lump. Roll it out into a large square sheet, about half an inch thick. Take a jagging-iron, or, If you have not one, a sharp knife; run it along the sheet, and cut the dough into long narrow slips. Twist them up in various forms. Have ready an iron pan with melted lard. Lay the crullers lightly in it, and"]]]
