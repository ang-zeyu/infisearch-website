Yous all de world to your old mammy, darlin'; and you know we must all wait de Lord's time.\"  \"Then ask Him to help me to be patient,\" she said, in a weary tone. \"And O mammy!\" she added, with a burst of bitter tears, \"ask Him to make my father love me.\"  \"I will, darlin', I will,\" sobbed Chloe, pressing the little form closer to her heart; \"an' don't you go for to be discouraged right away; for I'se sure Massa Horace must love you, fore long.\"  The tea-bell rang, and the family gathered about the table; but one chair remained unoccupied.  \"Where is Miss Elsie?\" asked Adelaide of one of the servants.  \"Dunno, missus,\" was the reply.  \"Well, then, go and see,\" said Adelaide; \"perhaps she did not hear the bell.\"  The servant returned in a moment, saying that Miss Elsie had a bad headache and did not want any supper. Mr. Horace Dinsmore paused in the conversation he was carrying on with his father, to listen to the servant's announcement. \"I hope she is not a sickly child,\" said he, addressing Adelaide; \"is she subject to such attacks?\"  \"Not very,\" replied his sister dryly, for she had seen the meeting, and felt really sorry for Elsie's evident disappointment; \"I imagine crying has brought this on.\"  He colored violently, and said in a tone of great displeasure, \"Truly, the return of a parent _is_ a cause for grief; yet I hardly expected my presence to be quite so distressing to my only child. I had no idea that she had already learned to dislike me so thoroughly.\"  \"She doesn't,\" said Adelaide, \"she has been looking and longing for your return ever since I have known her.\"  \"Then she has certainly been disappointed in me; her grief is not at all complimentary, explain it as you will.\"  Adelaide made no reply, for she saw that he was determined to put an unfavorable construction upon Elsie's conduct, and feared that any defence she could offer would only increase his displeasure.  It was a weary, aching head the little girl laid upon her pillow that night, and the little heart was sad and sore; yet she was not altogether comfortless, for she had turned in her sorrow to Him who has said, \"Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not,\" and she had the sweet assurance of _His_ love and favor.  It was with a trembling heart, hoping yet fearing, longing and yet dreading to see her father, that Elsie descended to the breakfast-room the next morning. She glanced timidly around, but he was not there.  \"Where is papa, Aunt Adelaide?\" she asked.  \"He is not coming down to breakfast, as he feels quite fatigued with his journey,\" replied her aunt; \"so you will not see him this morning, and perhaps not at all to-day, for there will be a good deal of company here this afternoon and evening.\"  Elsie sighed, and looked sadly disappointed. She found it very difficult to attend to her lessons that morning, and every time the door opened she started and looked up, half hoping it might be her papa.  But he did not come; and when the dinner hour arrived, the children were told that they were to dine in the nursery, on account of the large number of guests to be entertained in the dining-room. The company remained until bedtime; she was not called down to the parlor; and so saw nothing of her father that day.  But the next morning Chloe told her the children were to breakfast with the family, as all the visitors had left excepting one or two gentlemen. So Elsie went down to the breakfast-room, where, to her surprise, she found her papa sitting alone, reading the morning paper.  He looked up as she entered.  \"Good-morning, papa,\" she said, in half-trembling tones.  He started a little--for it was the first time he had ever been addressed by that title, and it sounded strange to his ears--gave her a glance of mingled curiosity and interest, half held out his hand, but drawing it back again, simply said, \"Good-morning, Elsie,\" and returned to his paper.  Elsie stood irresolutely in the middle of the floor, wanting, yet not daring to go to him.  But just at that instant the door opened, and Enna, looking rosy and happy, came running in, and rushing up to her brother, climbed upon his knee, and put her arms around his neck, saying, \"Good-morning, brother Horace. I want a kiss.\"  \"You shall have it, little pet,\" said he, throwing down his paper.  Then, kissing her several times and hugging her in his arms, he said, \"_You_ are not afraid of me, are you? nor sorry that I have come home?\"  \"No, indeed,\" said Enna.  He glanced at Elsie as she stood looking at them, her large soft eyes full of tears. She could not help feeling that Enna had her place, and was receiving the caresses that should have been lavished upon herself.  \"Jealous,\" thought her father; \"I cannot bear jealous people;\" and he gave her a look of displeasure that cut her to the heart, and she turned quickly away and left the room to hide the tears she could no longer keep back.  \"I am envious,\" she thought, \"jealous of Enna. Oh! how wicked!\" And she prayed silently, \"Dear Saviour, help me! take away these sinful feelings.\"  Young as she was, she was learning to have some control over her feelings, and in a few moments she had so far recovered her composure as to be able to return to the breakfast-room and take her place at the table, where the rest were already seated, her sweet little face sad indeed and bearing the traces of tears, but quite calm and peaceful.  Her father took no further notice of her, and she did not dare trust herself to look at him. The servants filled her plate, and she ate in silence, feeling it a great relief that all were too busily engaged in talking and eating to pay any attention to her. She scarcely raised her eyes from her plate, and did not know how often a strange gentleman, who sat nearly opposite, fixed his upon her.  As she left the room at the conclusion of the meal, he asked, while following her with his eyes, \"Is that one of your sisters, Dinsmore?\"  \"No,\" said he, coloring slightly; \"she is my daughter.\"  \"Ah, indeed!\" said his friend. \"I remember to have heard that you had a child, but had forgotten it. Well, you have no reason to be ashamed of her; she is lovely, perfectly lovely! has the sweetest little face I ever saw.\"  \"Will you ride, Travilla?\" asked Mr. Dinsmore hastily, as though anxious to change the subject.  \"I don't care if I do,\" was the reply, and they went out together.  Some hours later in the day Elsie was at the piano in the music-room practising, when a sudden feeling that some one was in the room caused her to turn and look behind her.  Mr. Travilla was standing there.  \"Excuse me,\" said he, bowing politely, \"but I heard the sound of the instrument, and, being very fond of music, I ventured to walk in.\"  Elsie was very modest, and rather timid, too, but also very polite; so she said, \"No excuse is necessary; but will you not take a seat, sir? though I fear my music will not afford you any pleasure, for you know I am only a little girl, and cannot play very well yet.\"  \"Thank you,\" said he, taking a seat by her side. \"And now will you do me the favor to repeat the song I heard you singing a few moments since?\"  Elsie immediately complied, though her cheeks burned, and her voice trembled at first from embarrassment; but it grew stronger as she proceeded and in the last verse was quite steady and full. She had a very fine voice for a child of her age; its sweetness was remarkable both in singing and speaking; and she had also a good deal of musical talent, which had been well cultivated, for she had had good teachers, and had practised with great patience and perseverance. Her music was simple, as suited her years, but her performance of it was very good indeed.  Mr. Travilla thanked her very heartily, and complimented her singing; then asked for another and another song, another and another piece, chatting with her about each, until they grew quite familiar, and Elsie lost all feeling of embarrassment.  \"Elsie, I think, is your name, is it not?\" he asked after a little.  \"Yes, sir,\" said she, \"Elsie Dinsmore.\"  \"And you are the daughter of my friend, Mr. Horace Dinsmore?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Your papa has been absent a long time, and I suppose you must have quite forgotten him.\"  \"No, sir, not _forgotten_, for I never had seen him.\"  \"Indeed!\" said he, in a tone of surprise; \"then, since he is an entire stranger to you, I suppose you cannot have much affection for him?\"  Elsie raised her large, dark eyes to his face, with an expression of astonishment. \"Not love papa, my own dear papa, who has no child but me? Oh! sir, how could you think that?\"  \"Ah! I see I was mistaken,\" said he, smiling; \"I thought you could hardly care for him at all; but do you think that he loves you?\"  Elsie dropped her face into her hands, and burst into an agony of tears.  The young gentleman looked extremely vexed with himself.  \"My poor little girl, my poor, dear little girl,\" he said, stroking her hair, \"forgive me. I am very, _very_ sorry for my thoughtless question. Do be comforted, my poor child, for whether your papa loves you now or not, I am quite sure he soon will.\"  Elsie now dried her tears, rose and closed the instrument. He assisted her, and then asked if she would not take a little walk with him in the garden. She complied, and, feeling really very sorry for the wound he had so thoughtlessly inflicted, as well as interested in his little companion, he exerted all his powers to entertain her--talked with her about the plants and flowers, described those he had seen in foreign lands, and related incidents of travel, usually choosing those in which her father had borne a part, because he perceived that they were doubly interesting to her.  Elsie, having been thrown very much upon her own resources for amusement, and having a natural love for books, and constant access to her grandfather's well-stocked library, had read many more, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6448"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 03 (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.      MYSTERIES OF PARIS  By EUGENE SUE  VOLUME THREE  [Illustration: THE RECITATION]     PART III.  NIGHT.     CHAPTER I.  IN THE NOTARY'S OFFICE.   Brain, or heart of the land, which you will, as large cities are, Paris may claim to have nerves, muscles, and arteries centering in it, which but few capitals, by right of size, passions, horrors, loves, charms, mysteries, in a word, can reveal. To trace its emotions, impulses, secrets, wounds, cankers, joys, the following pages are devoted.  We must begin by taking up the further ends of threads which will soon lead us deep into its labyrinths, not without events on the way, only surpassed by those we shall meet in the mazes themselves.  In the year 1819, a singular project, incited by the current stories of left-handed marriages and loving episodes, as in the case of the Prince of Capua and Miss Penelope Smith, was put into operation by one Sarah Seyton, widow of the Earl of M'Gregor. Her brother, the Honorable Tom Seyton, assisted her to the utmost, fully prepared to aid his sister in matrimonially entangling any crown-wearer whomsoever; he was perfectly willing to participate with her in all the schemes and intrigues that might be useful toward the success of her endeavor to become the wife of a sovereign, however humble in possessions and power; but he would far rather have killed the sister whom he so devotedly loved, than he would have seen her become the mistress of a prince, even with the certainty of a subsequent marriage in reparation.  The matrimonial inventory drawn up by Tom, with the aid of the _Almanach de Gotha_, had a very satisfactory aspect. The Germanic Confederation, especially, furnished a numerous contingency of young presumptive sovereigns, the first to whom the adventurers meant to pay attention being thus designated in the diplomatic and infallible Almanac of Gotha for the year of 1819:           _Genealogy of the Sovereigns of Europe and their Families._                                  GEROLSTEIN.           Grand-Duke MAXIMILIAN RUDOLPH, born December 10th, 1764.      Succeeded his father, CHARLES FREDERIC RUDOLPH, April 21st 1785.          Widower January, 1808, of Louisa, daughter of Prince JOHN                            AUGUSTUS of Burglen.                                     SON,                   GUSTAVUS RUDOLPH, born April 17th, 1803.                                    MOTHER,             Grand-Duchess JUDITH, dowager widow of the Grand-Duke                  CHARLES FREDERIC RUDOLPH, April 21st, 1785.   Tom had sense enough to inscribe first on his list the youngest of the princes whom he desired for his brother-in-law, thinking that extreme youth was more easily seduced than riper age.  The Countes M'Gregor was not only favored with the introduction of the Marquis d'Harville (a friend of the grand-duke, to whom he had rendered great services in 1815, and a little of a suitor of the lady's while she was in Paris) and of the British Ambassador in Paris, but with that of her own personal appearance. To rare beauty and a singular aptitude of acquiring various accomplishments, was added a seductiveness all the more dangerous, because she possessed a mind unbending and calculating, a disposition cunning and selfish, a deep hypocrisy, a stubborn and despotic will--all hidden under the specious gloss of a generous, warm, and impassioned nature. Physically her organization was as deceptive as it was morally. Her large black eyes--which, by turns languished and beamed with beauty beneath their ebon lashes--could feign to admiration all the kindling fires of voluptuousness. And yet, the burning impulses of love beat not in her frozen bosom; never could a surprise of either the heart or the senses disturb the stern and pitiless schemes of this intriguing, egotistical, and ambitious girl.  Fortunately for her, her plans were assisted by one Dr. Polidori, a learned but hypocritical man, who hoped to be the future Richelieu over the puppet he trusted to convert Prince Rudolph into. The lady and her brother combined with Polidori against the youthful prince, whose only ally was his true friend, an English baronet, Sir Walter Murphy.  The Countess M'Gregor drove things to the end, and, during a brief absence of the grand-duke, was secretly married to Prince Rudolph. In time, about to become a mother, the artful woman began to clamor for an acknowledgment of the union. She braved exposure, hoping to force the prince into giving her the station she sought. All was discovered, easily, therefore. But the old duke was all-powerful within his realm: the clandestine union was pronounced null and void, and the countess expelled. Her latest act of vengeance was to inform Rudolph that their child had died. This was in 1827. But this assurance was on a par with her former falseness: the child, a girl, was handed over to Jacques Ferrand, a miserly notary in Paris, whose housekeeper got rid of it to a rogue known as Pierre Tournemine. When he at last ran to the end of his tether, and was sentenced to imprisonment in the Rochefort-hulks for forgery, he induced a woman called Gervais, but nicknamed the Screech-Owl (Chouette), to take the girl, now five or six years old, who brought the little creature up in the midst of as much cruelty as degradation.  Meanwhile the countess nursed the idea of wedding Prince Rudolph in a more secure manner. When, in time, he became grand-duke, she was more eager than ever to enjoy what she considered her own. Though he had married, she hoped; and, the second wife having died childless, the Countess M'Gregor followed Rudolph into Prance, where he traveled _incognito_ as Count Duren. As a last resort to force the grand-duke into her ambitious aims, she sought for a girl of the age that her own would have been, to pass it off as their child. By chance, the woman to whom she applied was La Chouette, and hardly had she spoken of the likeness which the counterfeit would have to bear to the supposed _suppressed_ child, than the woman recognized the very girl whom she had kept for years by her, or in view.  Yes, the offspring of Prince Rudolph and the countess was a common girl of the town, known as Fleur-de-Marie (the Virgin's Flower), for her touching religious beauty, as La Goualeuse (the Songstress), for her vocal ability, and La Pegriotte (Little Thief), out of La Chouette's anger that she would not be what she styled her.  She had long shunned her sad sisters in shame, and, indeed, in all her life had known but one friend. This was a sewing-girl known as Rigolette, or Miss Dimpleton, from her continual smiles; a maid with no strong ideas of virtue, but preserved from the miry path which poor Fleur-de-Marie had been forced to use, merely by being too hard-worked to have leisure to be bad.  Prince Rudolph entertained the most profound aversion for the mother of his child, yet for the latter he mourned still, fifteen or eighteen years after her reported decease. Weary of life, save for doing good, he took a deep liking for playing the part of a minor providence, be it said in all reverence.  Known to society as the grand-duke, otherwise Count Duren, he had humble lodgings in No. 7, Rue du Temple, as a fan-painter, plain M. Rudolph. To mask the large sums which on occasion he dispensed in charity, he was wont to give out that he was the agent of wealthy persons who trusted him in their alms-giving.  Events brought him into immediate contact with Fleur-de-Marie, and Rigolette (who lived in his own house in the Rue du Temple).  The former he had rescued from her wretchedness and provided with a home on a farm at Bouqueval, whence she had been abducted by Chouette and comrades of hers, by orders of Jacques Ferrand, who wanted her put out of the way.  The wretches who had undertaken to drown the girl with Ferrand's housekeeper (become dangerous to him, as one aware of too many of his secrets) murdered the latter, but the former, swept from their sight by the Seine's current, had been saved by a former prison-mate of hers, a girl of twenty, so wild in manner as to have won the nickname of Louve (Wolf).  Snatched from death, the exhausted girl now lay, but a little this side of life's confines, in the house of Dr. Griffon, at Asnières, under his care and that of the Count of St. Rémy, two gentlemen who had seen her escape.  Rudolph was seeking her all this while, yet not so busily that he forgot his avenger's course. Chief among social oppressors, whose cunning baffled the law, and verified the old saying of \"what is everybody's business is nobody's business,\" Jacques Ferrand stood.  He withheld a large sum of money, intrusted _verbally_ to him, from its owner, the Baroness Fermont, and impoverished her and her daughter; he had seduced his servant Louise Morel, caused her imprisonment on a charge of child-murder, driving her father, a working jeweler, insane, and menacing the destruction of the whole family--but Rudolph was at hand to support them.  His cashier, François Germain, also was in prison, thanks to him. The youth--who had saved some money, and deposited it with a banker out of town--had no sooner heard that Louise Morel's father was in debt (a means of Ferrand's triumph over the girl), than he gave her some of his employer's money, thinking to replace it with his own immediately after. But while he was away to draw the deficit from his banker's, the notary discovered the loss, and had him arrested as a thief.  The notary, whose cunning had earned him a high reputation for honesty, strictness, and parsimony, was, at this moment, therefore, at the climax of inward delight. His chief accomplice removed (his only other being the Dr. Polidori already mentioned) he believed he had nothing to fear. Louise Morel had been replaced by a new servant, much more tempting to a man of the notary's sensual cravings than that first poor victim had been.  We usher the reader, at the clerks'"]]]
