The difference between you and me, Mr. Temple, is that you are thinking of what this boy did a week ago, and I am thinking of what _he is going to do to-morrow_.\"  The boys had the last word in this affair and it was blazoned forth with a commanding emphasis which shamed \"old John's\" most wrathful utterance. It was Roy Blakeley's idea, and it was exactly like him.  He invited the whole troop (Tom included) up to Camp Solitaire and there, before the sun was too low, they printed in blazing red upon a good-sized board the words    TRESPASSING PROHIBITED   UNDER PENALTY OF THE LAW  When darkness had fallen this was erected upon two uprights projecting above the top of Temple's board fence.  \"He'll be sure to see it,\" commented Roy, \"and it's what he always needed.\"  When a carpenter arrived on the scene the next morning to put up such a sign, as per instructions, he went back and told John Temple that there was a very good one there already, and asked what was the use of another.  It was the kind of thing that Roy Blakeley was in the habit of doing--a good turn with a dash of pepper in it.     CHAPTER VII  \"ON MY HONOR\"    During the next few days a dreadful document appeared which had to do with Tom, though he never saw it and only heard of it indirectly. Whence it emanated and what became of it he never knew, but he knew it was originated by the \"rich guys\" and that Mrs. Bennett and John Temple and the Probation Officer and the Judge had something to do with it.  It said that \"Whereas one Thomas Slade, aged fourteen, son of William Slade, whereabouts unknown, and Annie Slade, deceased, was an unprotected minor, etc., etc., that said Thomas Slade should therefore be brought into court by somebody or other at a certain particular time, for commitment as a city charge,\" and so forth and so on. There was a good deal more to it than this, but this was the part of it which Tom heard of, and he rose in rebellion.  He had been sleeping, sometimes at Mrs. O'Connor's and sometimes up at Camp Solitaire with Roy, as the fancy took him. When the news of what was under way fell like a thunderbolt upon him, in a frenzy of apprehension he went to Mr. Ellsworth.  Mr. Ellsworth himself went to court on the fatal day. The judge asked what facilities the \"Scout movement\" had for handling a boy like Tom Slade and whether they had an \"institution.\" He thought Tom might be placed under the supervision of competent people in the Home for Wayward Boys. The Probation Officer said that was just the place for Tom for he had a \"vicious proclivity.\" Tom thought presently he would be accused of having stolen that, whatever it was. Happily, though, in the end, he was committed to Mr. Ellsworth's care and he and Tom went forth together.  \"Now Tom,\" said the Scoutmaster, \"you and I are going to have a little pow-wow--you know what a pow-wow is? Well, then I'll tell you. When the Indians get together to chin about important matters, they call it a pow-wow. They usually hold it sitting around a camp fire, and we'll do that too when we get to Salmon River, for the Indians haven't got anything on us. But we'll have our first pow-wow right now walking along the street. What do you say?\"  \"Yer--yessir.\"  \"You heard the judge say you haven't any relations and, in a way, he was right, but he was mistaken, too, for a scout is a brother to every other scout and you've got lots of brothers, thousands of them; or will have when you get to be a scout. And after you get to be a scout, why you'll have a pretty big pack to carry. The question is, can you carry it?\"  \"Yessir.\"  \"You'll have to carry the pack for all these brothers of yours. If _you_ make a slip--tell a lie or throw a stone or interfere with Ching Wo--everybody'll say it's the Boy Scouts. Just the same as if Roy Blakeley should send a flash message wrong. The telegraph operator would give us the laugh and say the Scouts didn't know what they were doing. You and I'd get the blame as well as Roy. So you see, Roy's got a pretty big pack to carry, but he manages to stagger along with it.  \"You may have noticed that the Scouts are great fellows for laughing. If there's any laughing to be done, we're going to be the ones to do it. We don't let anybody else have the laugh. That's our middle name--laughter.  \"There's one other little thing, and then I'll tell you the main thing I want to say--flash it, as you fellows would say. We have to be careful about talking. Stick your tongue out a little way between your teeth and say them.\"  \"Them,\" said Tom.  \"The first thing for you to do is to make a list of all the words you use that begin with 'th' and say them that way. You know we have troop calls and patrol calls and all sorts of calls, and we've got to be able to make them just right--see?\"  \"Sure-yessir.\"  \"Now you take that word you use so much--'ye-re.' 'Yes' is better because it's only got three letters and you can flash it quicker. So one of the first things to do is to make the school books work overtime (there's only two or three weeks more) and get all those words just right; _them, those, three_--because if you said 'tree' and meant 'three' it might throw everything endways. We have a lot to do with trees in the summertime, and you want to be able to say'three' just right, for another reason.  [Illustration: OUTSIDE SCHMITT'S GROCERY THEY FOUND A \"BOY WANTED\" SIGN.]  \"There are three parts to the Scout Oath and we don't want to get those three parts mixed with trees. So whenever you're thinking of the oath, say _three_ and whenever you're thinking of going to Salmon River Grove, say tree.\"  The boy was much impressed.  \"But, Tom, the immediate thing to do is to go down to Schmitt's Grocery and take down that sign he's got outside.\"  \"I told Roy Blakeley I wouldn't take down no more signs.\"  \"You can tell Roy you took this one down with me--just for a stunt.\"  Outside Schmitt's Grocery they found a \"Boy Wanted\" sign, and then Tom understood. He hesitated a little when Mr. Ellsworth went in, for his relations with Mr. Schmitt had not been altogether cordial.  \"How'd do, Mr. Schmitt,\" said the scoutmaster breezily. \"How's the Russian advance?\"  \"Dem Roosians vill gett all vot's coming to dem,\" said Mr. Schmitt.  \"Yes? Well, how about this boy?\"  \"Veil, vot about him?\"  \"He wants to take down that sign out there.\"  \"Och! I know dot poy!\"  \"No, you don't; this is a different fellow--a Boy Scout.\"  \"Veil, if dis iss der kind of a poy scouts--\"  \"Now, look here, Mr. Schmitt, don't you say anything about the Boy Scouts. Who stopped your runaway horse for you last week?\"  \"I didn't say noddings about dem--\"  \"Well, a scout is a brother to every other scout, and if you say anything against one you say it against all.\"  He winked significantly at Mr. Schmitt. \"Come back here, I want to speak to you,\" said he.  They retired to the rear of the store, where Mr. Schmitt leaned his arm affectionately over the big wheel of the coffee-grinder and listened, all attention.  Tom overheard the words, \"fresh air,\" \"Boys' Home,\" \"something to do,\" \"appeal to honor,\" \"sense of responsibility,\" and more or less about woods and country and about a \"boy to-day being a man to-morrow,\" and about \"working with him,\" and other odds and ends which he did not understand.  \"Veil, it's a goot ting, I'll say dot mooch,\" said Mr. Schmitt, as they returned to the front of the store. \"Dere is too mooch cities--dey don't got no chance.\"  \"Tom,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, \"I've been telling Mr. Schmitt about that signal work. (He was wondering what the light was.) And I've told him about your wanting to earn a little money before camping time. He's going to start you in on three dollars and a half a week, school-days after three and all day Saturdays and Saturday nights. He asked me if you could deliver goods and I told him there wasn't a boy in town who could \"deliver the goods\" like you. Remember the pack you've got to carry for the whole troop. If you fall down, you'll queer the troop-Roy Blakeley and all of us.  \"Mr. Schmitt's a busy man and he has no time to think of what you were doing a few days ago, so don't you think about that either. You can't follow a trail looking backward--you have to keep your squinters ahead. Isn't that so, Mr. Schmitt?\"  \"You can'd look forwards vile you are going packwards,\" said Mr. Schmitt. \"You come aroundt at dree o'clock, to-morrow.\"  \"Now, Tom,\" said Mr. Ellsworth, as they left the store, \"my idea is for you to stay at Mrs. O'Connor's, and give her your money every week. Roy says he'd like to have you go up several nights a week and stay at Camp Solitaire, so I think maybe three dollars a week to Mrs. O'Connor will be all right. Then she'll save the other fifty cents for you and by the time we start for Salmon River you'll have enough, or pretty near enough, for a uniform.  \"For instance, you might go up to Camp Solitaire every other night and eat plum-duff and eggs with Roy. He says they've got chickens enough up there to keep the camp going. He uses so many eggs, one way or another, I should think he'd ashamed to look a hen in the face. And remember about the colors coming down at sunset. Uncle Sam's a regular old maid about such things, you know. And don't forget page--what was it?\"  \"Tree--three hundred and seventy-five,\" said Tom.  \"That'll tell you all about the flag. Then I want you to turn to page 28 in the Handbook and study our law. We have our own home-made laws same as everything else, plum-duff and fishing rods--all home-made.\"  Tom laughed.  \"I'll want to know what you think of those laws. I think they're pretty good; Roy thinks they're great, but then Roy's half crazy----\"  \"No, he isn't.\"  \"He doesn't know as much as he thinkgs he does,\" the scoutmaster came back.  \"He knows all "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6655"],["title","Tom Slade : Boy Scout of the Moving Pictures (#7)"],["body","dem--them signs backwards.\"  \"You'll beat him out at it,\" said the scoutmaster. \"Anyway, he's going to post you about the sign and the salute, and that leaves only the knots. You take a squint at those knots in the Handbook. I can improve on two of them, but I won't tell you how. You've got to get the hang of four of them, and I want you to see if you can't do all this by Sunday afternoon. But remember, Mr. Schmitt comes first.\"  Mr. Ellsworth blew into Mrs. O'Connor's with the same breezy pleasantry that he had shown Mr. Schmitt, to the great edification and delight of Sadie McCarren. He created quite a sensation in Barrell Alley and Mrs. O'Connor, good woman that she was, fell in with his plan enthusiastically.  The next morning Tom was up at six, wrestling with the O'Connor clothes-line, and by half past seven he had mastered the reef-knot and the weaver's knot, which latter he used to fasten two loose ends of the broken line for permanent use, and he wondered whether this by-product of his early morning practice might pass as a \"good turn.\"  Before he went to school, Mrs. Beaman, a neighbor, came in and said that after long consultation with her husband she had decided to offer three dollars for the Slade possessions, and in the absence of Bill Slade, the estate was settled up in Tom's interest on that basis. So he went forth feeling he and John Temple were alike in at least one thing-they were both capitalists.  Mr. Ellsworth was somewhat of a stickler for form and organization, and it was a pleasant scene which took place the following Sunday afternoon under the big elm up at Camp Solitaire. The ceremony of investing a Tenderfoot was always held on a Sunday because he believed it made it more impressive, and whenever possible it was held out of doors.  The First Bridgeboro Troop was highly organized and all its ceremonies emphasized the patrol. The two patrols, the Ravens and the Silver Foxes (and later the Elks) participated in the investing ceremony, but it was the affair particularly of the patrol into which the Tenderfoot was to enter, and this idea was worked out in the ceremony.  Each patrol stood grouped about its flag, and a little apart, near the national colors, stood Mr. Ellsworth and Worry Sage, Troop Scribe, armed with a book and fountain pen. Down near the signal pedestal was Roy's sister, Esther, in company with her mother and one or two servants from the house. Carl, the gardener, was there, too, to watch the ceremony.  Roy Blakeley, as sponsor for the new member, stepped forward with Tom.  \"Whom have you here?\" Mr. Ellsworth said, in accordance with their regular form.  \"An applicant for membership in our Troop and a voice in our councils,\" answered Roy.  \"Is he worthy to be a member of our Troop?\"  \"I come as his friend and his brother,\" said Roy, \"and to certify that he is as desirable to us as we to him.\"  \"Has he made satisfactory proof of the tests?\"  \"He has.\"  \"And is he prepared to take the oath?\"  \"He is prepared.\"  \"Raise your right hand in the Scout Salute,\" Mr. Ellsworth said to Tom.  Then Worry Sage stepped forward and repeated the oath, Tom following him, line by line:    On my honor I will do my best--   To do my duty to God and my country, and to obey the scout law;   To help other people at all times;   To keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally     straight.  \"How say you? Is this applicant familiar with the law?\" asked the scoutmaster.  \"He is familiar with the law and finds it good.\"  \"Let the law be read.\"  Worry Sage read the first law, which was the one Tom broke when he stole Mary Temple's ball.  \"You find this law good?\" asked the scout-master.  \"Yes sir, I do.\"  Then Worry read the next one, \"A Scout is loyal. He is loyal to all to whom loyalty is due; his scout leader, his home and parents and country.\"  \"You find this law good?\"  There was a slight pause.  \"Do I have to obey that one?\" said he. \"Do I have ter be loyal ter him?\"  Mr. Ellsworth stepped forward amid a tense silence and laid his hand on Tom's shoulder. \"I think you have been loyal to your mother already, Tom,\" he said in a low tone, \"as for your father,\" he hesitated; \"yes, I think you must be loyal to him too. There weren't any Boy Scouts when he was a boy, Tom. We must remember that.\"  \"All right,\" said Tom.  \"You find this law good?\" asked the scoutmaster, resuming the ceremonial form.  \"Yes--I do. I'll be--loyal.\"  The reading of the law completed, he stepped back with Roy to the Silver Fox emblem.  The Silver Fox patrol leader asked, \"Do you promise to stand faithful to this emblem, and to these your brother scouts of the Silver Fox Patrol?\"  And then, \"Are you familiar with the patrol call which is the voice of the silver fox, and with the patrol sign, which is the head of the silver fox, and do you promise to use this call and this sign and no other so that your name may be honorable in all the Troop, and among all troops?\"  And Tom answered, \"I promise.\"  Mr. Ellsworth pinned the Tenderfoot Badge on his breast.  Tom Slade of Barrel Alley had become a Scout. He could not see where the trail led, but that he had hit the right one he felt sure.    CHAPTER VIII  STUNG!    \"Got the linen thread?\"  \"Right here in the tin cup.\"  \"All right, put the tin cup in the pint measure and the pint measure in the coffee-pot; now put the coffee-put in the kettle and the kettle in the duffel-bag. Then put the duffel-bag in the corner.\"  \"Where'll I put the corner?\" laughed Tom.  \"There we are,\" said Roy, \"all ready before the Ravens have started to pack. They ought to be called the 'Snails.'\"  They were up at Camp Solitaire, the whole patrol, and the standing of the duffel-bag in the corner of the tent was the last act of a busy day.  \"I'll be sorry to see Camp Solitaire break up,\" said Tom. \"We've had some good sport up here.\"  \"There hasn't been much 'solitaire' to it lately,\" said Eddie Ingram.  \"Well, down it comes in the morning,\" said Roy. \"What are we going to catch, the three-thirty?\"  \"I bet the Ravens won't be ready,\" said one of the boys.  \"It would be just like them,\" observed an-other.  \"And we'll have to wait for the five-fifteen.\"  Just then Esther Blakeley came running out from the house.  \"I saw Walter Harris,\" said she, panting from running and excitement, \"and he told me to tell you that if the Ravens aren't at the station not to wait for them but go right along on the three-thirty and they'll see you later at Salmon River Grove.\"  \"What did I tell you!\" laughed Roy. \"Can you beat the Snail Patrol?\"  \"Hurrah for the Turtles!\" shouted Westy.  \"I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't show up till the next day.\"  \"Or next week,\" said Tom.  The Ravens were not on hand for the three-thirty next day and the Silver Foxes went without them, bag and baggage.  \"They're some rear guard, all right,\" said Roy.  \"Bet they're still buying fishing-tackle,\" said Westy.  \"The Also Ran Patrol,\" commented Dorry Benton.  \"The Last Gasp Patrol,\" said another boy.  \"The Tardy Turtles,\" ventured Tom.  \"We'll have our tent up before they leave Bridgeboro--you see,\" said Roy. \"Somebody ought to set a fire-cracker off underneath that patrol--they're hopeless.\"  Salmon River Grove was about an hour out on the train. Some of the wealthier of the Bridge-boro people had cottages there. The Bennetts had a pretty bungalow in the village and here, in a hammock on the wide veranda, Connover was wont to loll away the idle summer hours in cushioned ease, reading books about boys who dwelt in the heavens above and in the earth beneath and in the waters under the earth. They went down in submarines, these boys, and up in airships, and to the North Pole and the South Pole and the Desert of Sahara. They were all Boy Scouts and it was from these books that Mrs. Bennett gleaned her notions of scouting.  It was a dangerous season for Connover, for in the spring his fancy softly turned to thoughts of scouting, but Mrs. Bennett stood guard against these perils with a tennis racquet and a bottle of cod liver oil and a backgammon board and an automatic piano. And so by hook or crook Connover was tided over the dangerous season, and allowed to read the _Dan Dreadnought Series_ as a sort of compromise.  But the show place at Salmon River Grove was Five Oaks, the magnificent new estate of John Temple with its palatial rubble-stone residence, its garage and hot-houses and \"No Trespassing\" signs, of which latter he had the finest collection of any man in the state. The latest edition of these did not say \"No Trespassing\" at all, but simply, \"Keep out.\" These signs stood about the newly graded lawns seeming to shake their fists at the curious who peered at the great tur-retted structure.  Mr. Blakeley, Roy's father, also owned an extensive tract of woods a little way from the village and here the First Bridgeboro Troop was monarch of all it surveyed from the day school closed until almost the day it opened; and here Mr. Ellsworth spent the happy days of a well-earned vacation, going into town occasionally as business demanded.  From Salmon River Grove Station the Silver Fox Patrol had to hike it out for about three miles, and when they hit Camp Ellsworth (as the boys insisted upon calling it) there was the Ravens' tent pitched under the trees, and the Ravens' flag flying, and the Ravens' fire crackling away, and the Ravens themselves gathered about it. On a tree was displayed a glaring sign done in charcoal, which read,  The Follow-Afters are cordially invited to dine with the Rapid Ravens. Supper is ready and      WAITING.  When Mr. Ellsworth came out from Bridgeboro at seven o'clpck, he declined to be interviewed as to what he might know of this affair. But whatever he knew, it was evident that the whole plan was known in another quarter, for the very next day the \"mail-hiker\" (who was Dorry Benton) brought up from Salmon River Village a post card addressed to Roy, which read,  \"MR. SMARTY:  \"Perhaps you know by this"]]]
