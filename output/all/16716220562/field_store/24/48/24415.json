Was this mere sentimentalism, a four-in-the-morning tribute to the pathos of the flying years, or did she really fill my soul and stand guard over it so that no successor could enter in and usurp her place?  I had no answer, unless the fact that I replaced the photograph in its drawer was one. I felt that this thing could not be decided now. It was more difficult than I had thought.  All my gloom had returned by the time I was in bed. Hours seemed to pass while I tossed restlessly aching for sleep.  When I woke my last coherent thought was still clear in my mind. It was a passionate vow that, come what might, if those Irish eyes were to haunt me till my death, I would play the game loyally with Cynthia.   II  The telephone bell rang just as I was getting ready to call at Marlow Square and inform Mrs Drassilis of the position of affairs. Cynthia, I imagined, would have broken the news already, which would mitigate the embarrassment of the interview to some extent; but the recollection of my last night's encounter with Mrs Drassilis prevented me from looking forward with any joy to the prospect of meeting her again.  Cynthia's voice greeted me as I unhooked the receiver.  'Hullo, Peter! Is that you? I want you to come round here at once.'  'I was just starting,' I said.  'I don't mean Marlow Square. I'm not there. I'm at the Guelph. Ask for Mrs Ford's suite. It's very important. I'll tell you all about it when you get here. Come as soon as you can.'  My rooms were conveniently situated for visits to the Hotel Guelph. A walk of a couple of minutes took me there. Mrs Ford's suite was on the third floor. I rang the bell and Cynthia opened the door to me.  'Come in,' she said. 'You're a dear to be so quick.'  'My rooms are only just round the corner.' She shut the door, and for the first time we looked at one another. I could not say that I was nervous, but there was certainly, to me, a something strange in the atmosphere. Last night seemed a long way off and somehow a little unreal. I suppose I must have shown this in my manner, for she suddenly broke what had amounted to a distinct pause by giving a little laugh. 'Peter,' she said, 'you're embarrassed.' I denied the charge warmly, but without real conviction. I was embarrassed. 'Then you ought to be,' she said. 'Last night, when I was looking my very best in a lovely dress, you asked me to marry you. Now you see me again in cold blood, and you're wondering how you can back out of it without hurting my feelings.'  I smiled. She did not. I ceased to smile. She was looking at me in a very peculiar manner.  'Peter,' she said, 'are you sure?'  'My dear old Cynthia,' I said, 'what's the matter with you?'  'You are sure?' she persisted.  'Absolutely, entirely sure.' I had a vision of two large eyes looking at me out of a photograph. It came and went in a flash.  I kissed Cynthia.  'What quantities of hair you have,' I said. 'It's a shame to cover it up.' She was not responsive. 'You're in a very queer mood today, Cynthia,' I went on. 'What's the matter?'  'I've been thinking.'  'Out with it. Something has gone wrong.' An idea flashed upon me. 'Er--has your mother--is your mother very angry about--'  'Mother's delighted. She always liked you, Peter.'  I had the self-restraint to check a grin.  'Then what is it?' I said. 'Tired after the dance?'  'Nothing as simple as that.'  'Tell me.'  'It's so difficult to put it into words.'  'Try.'  She was playing with the papers on the table, her face turned away. For a moment she did not speak.  'I've been worrying myself, Peter,' she said at last. 'You are so chivalrous and unselfish. You're quixotic. It's that that is troubling me. Are you marrying me just because you're sorry for me? Don't speak. I can tell you now if you will just let me say straight out what's in my mind. We have known each other for two years now. You know all about me. You know how--how unhappy I am at home. Are you marrying me just because you pity me and want to take me out of all that?'  'My dear girl!'  'You haven't answered my question.'  'I answered it two minutes ago when you asked me if--'  'You do love me?'  'Yes.'  All this time she had been keeping her face averted, but now she turned and looked into my eyes with an abrupt intensity which, I confess, startled me. Her words startled me more.  'Peter, do you love me as much as you loved Audrey Blake?'  In the instant which divided her words from my reply my mind flew hither and thither, trying to recall an occasion when I could have mentioned Audrey to her. I was convinced that I had not done so. I never mentioned Audrey to anyone.  There is a grain of superstition in the most level-headed man. I am not particularly level-headed, and I have more than a grain in me. I was shaken. Ever since I had asked Cynthia to marry me, it seemed as if the ghost of Audrey had come back into my life.  'Good Lord!' I cried. 'What do you know of Audrey Blake?'  She turned her face away again.  'Her name seems to affect you very strongly,' she said quietly.  I recovered myself.  'If you ask an old soldier,' I said, 'he will tell you that a wound, long after it has healed, is apt to give you an occasional twinge.'  'Not if it has really healed.'  'Yes, when it has really healed--when you can hardly remember how you were fool enough to get it.'  She said nothing.  'How did you hear about--it?' I asked.  'When I first met you, or soon after, a friend of yours--we happened to be talking about you--told me that you had been engaged to be married to a girl named Audrey Blake. He was to have been your best man, he said, but one day you wrote and told him there would be no wedding, and then you disappeared; and nobody saw you again for three years.'  'Yes,' I said: 'that is all quite true.'  'It seems to have been a serious affair, Peter. I mean--the sort of thing a man would find it hard to forget.'  I tried to smile, but I knew that I was not doing it well. It was hurting me extraordinarily, this discussion of Audrey.  'A man would find it almost impossible,' I said, 'unless he had a remarkably poor memory.'  'I didn't mean that. You know what I mean by forget.'  'Yes,' I said, 'I do.'  She came quickly to me and took me by the shoulders, looking into my face.  'Peter, can you honestly say you have forgotten her--in the sense I mean?'  'Yes,' I said.  Again that feeling swept over me--that curious sensation of being defiant against myself.  'She does not stand between us?'  'No,' I said.  I could feel the effort behind the word. It was as if some subconscious part of me were working to keep it back.  'Peter!'  There was a soft smile on her face; as she raised it to mine I put my arms around her.  She drew away with a little laugh. Her whole manner had changed. She was a different being from the girl who had looked so gravely into my eyes a moment before.  'Oh, my dear boy, how terribly muscular you are! You've crushed me. I expect you used to be splendid at football, like Mr Broster.'  I did not reply at once. I cannot wrap up the deeper emotions and put them back on their shelf directly I have no further immediate use for them. I slowly adjusted myself to the new key of the conversation.  'Who's Broster?' I asked at length.  'He used to be tutor to'--she turned me round and pointed--'to _that_.'  I had seen a picture standing on one of the chairs when I entered the room but had taken no particular notice of it. I now gave it a closer glance. It was a portrait, very crudely done, of a singularly repulsive child of about ten or eleven years old.  _Was_ he, poor chap! Well, we all have our troubles, don't we! Who _is_ this young thug! Not a friend of yours, I hope?'  'That is Ogden, Mrs Ford's son. It's a tragedy--'  'Perhaps it doesn't do him justice. Does he really squint like that, or is it just the artist's imagination?'  'Don't make fun of it. It's the loss of that boy that is breaking Nesta's heart.'  I was shocked.  'Is he dead? I'm awfully sorry. I wouldn't for the world--'  'No, no. He is alive and well. But he is dead to her. The court gave him into the custody of his father.'  'The court?'  'Mrs Ford was the wife of Elmer Ford, the American millionaire. They were divorced a year ago.'  'I see.'  Cynthia was gazing at the portrait.  'This boy is quite a celebrity in his way,' she said. 'They call him \"The Little Nugget\" in America.'  'Oh! Why is that?'  'It's a nickname the kidnappers have for him. Ever so many attempts have been made to steal him.'  She stopped and looked at me oddly.  'I made one today, Peter,' she said. I went down to the country, where the boy was, and kidnapped him.'  'Cynthia! What on earth do you mean?'  'Don't you understand? I did it for Nesta's sake. She was breaking her heart about not being able to see him, so I slipped down and stole him away, and brought him back here.'  I do not know if I was looking as amazed as I felt. I hope not, for I felt as if my brain were giving way. The perfect calmness with which she spoke of this extraordinary freak added to my confusion.  'You're joking!'  'No; I stole him.'  'But, good heavens! The law! It's a penal offence, you know!'  'Well, I did it. Men like Elmer Ford aren't fit to have charge of a child. You don't know him, but he's just an unscrupulous financier, without a thought above money. To think of a boy growing up in that tainted atmosphere--at his most impressionable age. It means death to any good there is in him.'  My mind was still grappling feebly with the legal aspect of the affair.  'But, Cynthia, kidnapping's kidnapping, you know! The law doesn't take any notice of motives. If you're caught--'  She cut through my babble.  'Would you have been afraid to do it, Peter?'  'Well--' I began. I had not considered the point before.  'I don't believe you would. If I asked you to do it for my sake--'  'But, Cynthia, kidnapping, you know! It's such an infernally low-down game.'  'I played it. Do"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6683"],["title","The Little Nugget (#7)"],["body","despise _me_?'  I perspired. I could think of no other reply.  'Peter,' she said, 'I understand your scruples. I know exactly how you feel. But can't you see that this is quite different from the sort of kidnapping you naturally look on as horrible? It's just taking a boy away from surroundings that must harm him, back to his mother, who worships him. It's not wrong. It's splendid.'  She paused.  'You _will_ do it for me, Peter?' she said.  'I don't understand,' I said feebly. 'It's done. You've kidnapped him yourself.'  'They tracked him and took him back. And now I want _you_ to try.' She came closer to me. 'Peter, don't you see what it will mean to me if you agree to try? I'm only human, I can't help, at the bottom of my heart, still being a little jealous of this Audrey Blake. No, don't say anything. Words can't cure me; but if you do this thing for me, I shall be satisfied. I shall _know_.'  She was close beside me, holding my arm and looking into my face. That sense of the unreality of things which had haunted me since that moment at the dance came over me with renewed intensity. Life had ceased to be a rather grey, orderly business in which day succeeded day calmly and without event. Its steady stream had broken up into rapids, and I was being whirled away on them.  'Will you do it, Peter? Say you will.'  A voice, presumably mine, answered 'Yes'.  'My dear old boy!'  She pushed me into a chair, and, sitting on the arm of it, laid her hand on mine and became of a sudden wondrously business-like.  'Listen,' she said, 'I'll tell you what we have arranged.'  It was borne in upon me, as she began to do so, that she appeared from the very beginning to have been extremely confident that that essential part of her plans, my consent to the scheme, could be relied upon as something of a certainty. Women have these intuitions.   III  Looking back, I think I can fix the point at which this insane venture I had undertaken ceased to be a distorted dream, from which I vaguely hoped that I might shortly waken, and took shape as a reality of the immediate future. That moment came when I met Mr Arnold Abney by appointment at his club.  Till then the whole enterprise had been visionary. I gathered from Cynthia that the boy Ogden was shortly to be sent to a preparatory school, and that I was to insinuate myself into this school and, watching my opportunity, to remove him; but it seemed to me that the obstacles to this comparatively lucid scheme were insuperable. In the first place, how were we to discover which of England's million preparatory schools Mr Ford, or Mr Mennick for him, would choose? Secondly, the plot which was to carry me triumphantly into this school when--or if--found, struck me as extremely thin. I was to pose, Cynthia told me, as a young man of private means, anxious to learn the business, with a view to setting up a school of his own. The objection to that was, I held, that I obviously did not want to do anything of the sort. I had not the appearance of a man with such an ambition. I had none of the conversation of such a man.  I put it to Cynthia.  'They would find me out in a day,' I assured her. 'A man who wants to set up a school has got to be a pretty brainy sort of fellow. I don't know anything.'  'You got your degree.'  'A degree. At any rate, I've forgotten all I knew.'  'That doesn't matter. You have the money. Anybody with money can start a school, even if he doesn't know a thing. Nobody would think it strange.'  It struck me as a monstrous slur on our educational system, but reflection told me it was true. The proprietor of a preparatory school, if he is a man of wealth, need not be able to teach, any more than an impresario need be able to write plays.  'Well, we'll pass that for the moment,' I said. 'Here's the real difficulty. How are you going to find out the school Mr Ford has chosen?'  'I have found it out already--or Nesta has. She set a detective to work. It was perfectly easy. Ogden's going to Mr Abney's. Sanstead House is the name of the place. It's in Hampshire somewhere. Quite a small school, but full of little dukes and earls and things. Lord Mountry's younger brother, Augustus Beckford, is there.'  I had known Lord Mountry and his family well some years ago. I remembered Augustus dimly.  'Mountry? Do you know him? He was up at Oxford with me.'  She seemed interested.  'What kind of a man is he?' she asked.  'Oh, quite a good sort. Rather an ass. I haven't seen him for years.'  'He's a friend of Nesta's. I've only met him once. He is going to be your reference.'  'My what?'  'You will need a reference. At least, I suppose you will. And, anyhow, if you say you know Lord Mountry it will make it simpler for you with Mr Abney, the brother being at the school.'  'Does Mountry know about this business? Have you told him why I want to go to Abney's?'  'Nesta told him. He thought it was very sporting of you. He will tell Mr Abney anything we like. By the way, Peter, you will have to pay a premium or something, I suppose. But Nesta will look after all expenses, of course.'  On this point I made my only stand of the afternoon.  'No,' I said; 'it's very kind of her, but this is going to be entirely an amateur performance. I'm doing this for you, and I'll stand the racket. Good heavens! Fancy taking money for a job of this kind!'  She looked at me rather oddly.  'That is very sweet of you, Peter,' she said, after a slight pause. 'Now let's get to work.'  And together we composed the letter which led to my sitting, two days later, in stately conference at his club with Mr Arnold Abney, M.A., of Sanstead House, Hampshire.  Mr Abney proved to be a long, suave, benevolent man with an Oxford manner, a high forehead, thin white hands, a cooing intonation, and a general air of hushed importance, as of one in constant communication with the Great. There was in his bearing something of the family solicitor in whom dukes confide, and something of the private chaplain at the Castle.  He gave me the key-note to his character in the first minute of our acquaintanceship. We had seated ourselves at a table in the smoking-room when an elderly gentleman shuffled past, giving a nod in transit. My companion sprang to his feet almost convulsively, returned the salutation, and subsided slowly into his chair again.  'The Duke of Devizes,' he said in an undertone. 'A most able man. Most able. His nephew, Lord Ronald Stokeshaye, was one of my pupils. A charming boy.'  I gathered that the old feudal spirit still glowed to some extent in Mr Abney's bosom.  We came to business.  'So you wish to be one of us, Mr Burns, to enter the scholastic profession?'  I tried to look as if I did.  'Well, in certain circumstances, the circumstances in which I--ah--myself, I may say, am situated, there is no more delightful occupation. The work is interesting. There is the constant fascination of seeing these fresh young lives develop--and of helping them to develop--under one's eyes; in any case, I may say, there is the exceptional interest of being in a position to mould the growing minds of lads who will some day take their place among the country's hereditary legislators, that little knot of devoted men who, despite the vulgar attacks of loudmouthed demagogues, still do their share, and more, in the guidance of England's fortunes. Yes.'  He paused. I said I thought so, too.  'You are an Oxford man, Mr Burns, I think you told me? Ah, I have your letter here. Just so. You were at--ah, yes. A fine college. The Dean is a lifelong friend of mine. Perhaps you knew my late pupil, Lord Rollo?--no, he would have been since your time. A delightful boy. Quite delightful ... And you took your degree? Exactly. _And_ represented the university at both cricket and Rugby football? Excellent. _Mens sana in_--ah--_corpore_, in fact, _sano_, yes!'  He folded the letter carefully and replaced it in his pocket.  'Your primary object in coming to me, Mr Burns, is, I gather, to learn the--ah--the ropes, the business? You have had little or no previous experience of school-mastering?'  'None whatever.'  'Then your best plan would undoubtedly be to consider yourself and work for a time simply as an ordinary assistant-master. You would thus get a sound knowledge of the intricacies of the profession which would stand you in good stead when you decide to set up your own school. School-mastering is a profession, which cannot be taught adequately except in practice. \"Only those who--ah--brave its dangers comprehend its mystery.\" Yes, I would certainly recommend you to begin at the foot of the ladder and go, at least for a time, through the mill.'  'Certainly,' I said. 'Of course.'  My ready acquiescence pleased him. I could see that he was relieved. I think he had expected me to jib at the prospect of actual work.  'As it happens,' he said, 'my classical master left me at the end of last term. I was about to go to the Agency for a successor when your letter arrived. Would you consider--'  I had to think this over. Feeling kindly disposed towards Mr Arnold Abney, I wished to do him as little harm as possible. I was going to rob him of a boy, who, while no moulding of his growing mind could make him into a hereditary legislator, did undoubtedly represent a portion of Mr Abney's annual income; and I did not want to increase my offence by being a useless assistant-master. Then I reflected that, if I was no Jowett, at least I knew enough Latin and Greek to teach the rudiments of those languages to small boys. My conscience was satisfied.  'I should be delighted,' I said.  'Excellent. Then let us consider that as--ah--settled,' said Mr Abney.  There was a pause. My companion began to fiddle a little uncomfortably with an ash-tray. I wondered what was the matter, and then it came to me. We were about to become sordid. The discussion of terms was upon us.  And as I realized this, I saw simultaneously how I could throw one more sop to my exigent conscience. After "]]]
