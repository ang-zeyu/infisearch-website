O Antonio, Ferdinand is at the porch, and inquiring for us.  _Isaac_. Who? Don Ferdinand! he's not inquiring for me, I hope.  _Don Ant_. Fear not, my love; I'll soon pacify him.  _Isaac_. Egad, you won't. Antonio, take my advice, and run away; this Ferdinand is the most unmerciful dog, and has the cursedest long sword! and, upon my, soul, he comes on purpose to cut your throat.  _Don Ant_. Never fear, never fear.  _Isaac_. Well, you may stay if you will; but I'll get some one to marry me: for by St. Iago, he shall never meet me again, while I am master of a pair of heels. [_Runs out_.--DONNA LOUISA _lets down her veil_.]   _Enter_ DON FERDINAND.  _Don Ferd_. So, sir, I have met with you at last.  _Don Ant_. Well, sir.  _Don Ferd_. Base, treacherous man! whence can a false, deceitful soul, like yours, borrow confidence, to look so steadily on the man you've injured!  _Don Ant_. Ferdinand, you are too warm: 'tis true you find me on the point of wedding one I loved beyond my life; but no argument of mine prevailed on her to elope.--I scorn deceit, as much as you. By heaven I knew not that she had left her father's till I saw her!  _Don Ferd_. What a mean excuse! You have wronged your friend, then, for one, whose wanton forwardness anticipated your treachery--of this, indeed, your Jew pander informed me; but let your conduct be consistent, and since you have dared to do a wrong, follow me, and show you have a spirit to avow it.  _Don. Louisa_. Antonio, I perceive his mistake--leave him to me.  _Paul_. Friend, you are rude, to interrupt the union of two willing hearts.  _Don Ferd_. No, meddling priest! the hand he seeks is mine.  _Paul_. If so, I'll proceed no further. Lady, did you ever promise this youth your hand? [_To_ DONNA LOUISA, _who shakes her head_.]  _Don Ferd_. Clara, I thank you for your silence--I would not have heard your tongue avow such falsity; be't your punishment to remember that I have not reproached you.   _Enter_ DONNA CLARA, _veiled_.  _Don. Clara_. What mockery is this?  _Don Ferd_. Antonio, you are protected now, but we shall meet. [_Going_, DONNA CLARA _holds one arm, and_ DONNA LOUISA _the other_.]  DUET.  _Don. Louisa_.   Turn thee round, I pray thee,   Calm awhile thy rage.  _Don. Clara_.   I must help to stay thee,   And thy wrath assuage.  _Don. Louisa_.   Couldst thou not discover   One so dear to thee?  _Don. Clara_.   Canst thou be a lover,   And thus fly from me? [_Both unveil_.]  _Don Ferd_. How's this? My sister! Clara, too--I'm confounded.  _Don. Louisa_. 'Tis even so, good brother.  _Paul_. How! what impiety? did the man want to marry his own sister?  _Don. Louisa_. And ar'n't you ashamed of yourself not to know your own sister?  _Don. Clara_. To drive away your own mistress----  _Don. Louisa_. Don't you see how jealousy blinds people?  _Don. Clara_. Ay, and will you ever be jealous again?  _Don Ferd_. Never--never!--You, sister, I know will forgive me--but how, Clara, shall I presume----  _Don. Clara_. No, no; just now you told me not to tease you--\"Who do you want, good signor?\" \"Not you, not you!\" Oh you blind wretch! but swear never to be jealous again, and I'll forgive you.  _Don Ferd_. By all----  _Don. Clara_. There, that will do--you'll keep the oath just as well. [_Gives her hand_.]  _Don. Louisa_. But, brother, here is one to whom some apology is due.  _Don Ferd_. Antonio, I am ashamed to think----  _Don Ant_. Not a word of excuse, Ferdinand--I have not been in love myself without learning that a lover's anger should never be resented. But come--let us retire, with this good father, and we'll explain to you the cause of this error.  GLEE AND CHORUS.    Oft does Hymen smile to hear   Wordy vows of feign'd regard;   Well, he knows when they're sincere,   Never slow to give reward   For his glory is to prove   Kind to those who wed for love.

Be sure, now, let everything be in the best order--let all my servants have on their merriest faces: but tell them to get as little drunk as possible, till after supper.--[_Exeunt_ SERVANTS.] So, Lopez, where's your master? shan't we have him at supper?  _Lop_. Indeed, I believe not, sir--he's mad, I doubt! I'm sure he has frighted me from him.  _Don Jer_. Ay, ay, he's after some wench, I suppose: a young rake! Well, well, we'll be merry without him. [_Exit_ LOPEZ.]   _Enter a_ SERVANT.  _Ser_. Sir, here is Signor Isaac. [_Exit_.]   _Enter_ ISAAC.  _Don Jer_. So, my dear son-in-law--there, take my blessing and forgiveness. But where's my daughter? where's Louisa?  _Isaac_. She's without, impatient for a blessing, but almost afraid to enter.  _Don Jer_. Oh, fly and bring her in.--[_Exit_ ISAAC.] Poor girl, I long to see her pretty face.  _Isaac_. [_Without_.] Come, my, charmer! my trembling angel!   _Re-enter_ ISAAC _with_ DUENNA; DON JEROME _runs to meet them; she kneels_.  _Don Jer_. Come to my arms, my--[_Starts back_.] Why, who the devil have we here?  _Isaac_. Nay, Don Jerome, you promised her forgiveness; see how the dear creature droops!  _Don Jer_. Droops indeed! Why, Gad take me, this is old Margaret! But where's my daughter? where's Louisa?  _Isaac_. Why, here, before your eyes--nay, don't be abashed, my sweet wife!  _Don Jer_. Wife with a vengeance! Why, zounds! you have not married the Duenna!  _Duen_. [_Kneeling_.] Oh, dear papa! you'll not disown me, sure!  _Don Jer_. Papa! papa! Why, zounds! your impudence is as great as your ugliness!  _Isaac_. Rise, my charmer, go throw your snowy arms about his neck, and convince him you are----  _Duen_. Oh, sir, forgive me! [_Embraces him_.]  _Don Jer_. Help! murder!   _Enter_ SERVANTS.  _Ser_. What's the matter, sir?  _Don Jer_. Why, here, this damned Jew has brought an old harridan to strangle me.  _Isaac_. Lord, it is his own daughter, and he is so hard-hearted he won't forgive her!   _Enter_ DON ANTONIO _and_ DONNA LOUISA; _they kneel_.  _Don Jer_. Zounds and fury! what's here now? who sent for you, sir, and who the devil are you?  _Don Ant_. This lady's husband, sir.  _Isaac_. Ay, that he is, I'll be sworn; for I left them with a priest, and was to have given her away.  _Don Jer_. You were?  _Isaac_. Ay; that's my honest friend, Antonio; and that's the little girl I told you I had hampered him with.  _Don Jer_. Why, you are either drunk or mad--this is my daughter.  _Isaac_. No, no; 'tis you are both drunk and mad, I think--here's your daughter.  _Don Jer_. Hark ye, old iniquity! will you explain all this, or not?  _Duen_. Come then, Don Jerome, I will--though our habits might inform you all. Look on your daughter, there, and on me.  _Isaac_. What's this I hear?  _Duen_. The truth is, that in your passion this morning you made a small mistake; for you turned your daughter out of doors, and locked up your humble servant.  _Isaac_. O Lud! O Lud! here's a pretty fellow, to turn his daughter out of doors, instead of an old Duenna!  _Don Jer_. And, O Lud! O Lud! here's a pretty fellow, to marry an old Duenna instead of my daughter! But how came the rest about?  _Duen_. I have only to add, that I remained in your daughter's place, and had the good fortune to engage the affections of my sweet husband here.  _Isaac_. Her husband! why, you old witch, do you think I'll be your husband now? This is a trick, a cheat! and you ought all to be ashamed of yourselves.  _Don Ant_. Hark ye, Isaac, do you dare to complain of tricking? Don Jerome, I give you my word, this cunning Portuguese has brought all this upon himself, by endeavouring to overreach you, by getting your daughter's fortune, without making any settlement in return.  _Don Jer_. Overreach me!  _Don. Louisa_. 'Tis so, indeed, sir, and we can prove it to you.  _Don Jer_. Why, Gad, take me, it must be so, or he never could put up with such a face as Margaret's--so, little Solomon, I wish you joy of your wife, with all my soul.  _Don. Louisa_. Isaac, tricking is all fair in love--let you alone for the plot!  _Don Ant_. A cunning dog, ar'n't you? A sly little villain, eh?  _Don. Louisa_. Roguish, perhaps; but keen, devilish keen!  _Don Jer_. Yes, yes; his aunt always called him little Solomon.  _Isaac_. Why, the plagues of Egypt upon you all! but do you think I'll submit to such an imposition?  _Don Ant_. Isaac, one serious word--you'd better be content as you are; for, believe me, you will find that, in the opinion of the world, there is not a fairer subject for contempt and ridicule than a knave become the dupe of his own art.  _Isaac_. I don't care--I'll not endure this. Don Jerome, 'tis you have done this--you would be so cursed positive about the beauty of her you locked up, and all the time I told you she was as old as my mother, and as ugly as the devil.  _Duen_. Why, you little insignificant reptile!----  _Don Jer_. That's right!--attack him, Margaret.  _Duen_. Dare such a thing as you pretend to talk of beauty?--A walking rouleau?--a body that seems to owe all its consequence to the dropsy! a pair of eyes like two dead beetles in a wad of brown dough! a beard like an artichoke, with dry, shrivelled jaws that would disgrace the mummy of a monkey?  _Don Jer_. Well done, Margaret!  _Duen_. But you shall know that I have a brother who wears a sword-- and, if you don't do me justice--  _Isaac_. Fire seize your brother, and you too! I'll fly to Jerusalem to avoid you!  _Duen_. Fly where you will, I'll follow you.  _Don Jer_. Throw your snowy arms about him, Margaret.--[_Exeunt_ ISAAC _and_ DUENNA.] But, Louisa, are you really married to this modest gentleman?  _Don. Louisa_. Sir, in obedience to your commands, I gave him my hand within this hour.  _Don Jer_. My commands!  _Don Ant_. Yes, sir; here is your consent, under your own hand.  _Don Jer_.

Yet, after publishing an account of Lycurgus the lawgiver and Numa the king, I thought I might, not without reason, ascend as high as to Romulus, being brought by my history so near to his time. Considering therefore with myself  Whom shall I set so great a man to face? Or whom oppose?  who's equal to the place?  (as Aeschylus expresses it), I found none so fit as him that peopled the beautiful and far-famed city of Athens, to be set in opposition with the father of the invincible and renowned city of Rome.  Let us hope that Fable may, in what shall follow, so submit to the purifying processes of Reason as to take the character of exact history.  In any case, however, where it shall be found contumaciously slighting credibility, and refusing to be reduced to anything like probable fact, we shall beg that we may meet with candid readers, and such as will receive with indulgence the stories of antiquity.  Theseus seemed to me to resemble Romulus in many particulars.  Both of them, born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage, had the repute of being sprung from the gods.  Both warriors; that by all the world's allowed.  Both of them united with strength of body an equal vigor mind; and of the two most famous cities of the world the one built Rome, and the other made Athens be inhabited.  Both stand charged with the rape of women; neither of them could avoid domestic misfortunes nor jealousy at home; but towards the close of their lives are both of them said to have incurred great odium with their countrymen, if, that is, we may take the stories least like poetry as our guide to the truth.  The lineage of Theseus, by his father's side, ascends as high as to Erechtheus and the first inhabitants of Attica.  By his mother's side he was descended of Pelops.  For Pelops was the most powerful of all the kings of Peloponnesus, not so much by the greatness of his riches as the multitude of his children, having married many daughters to chief men, and put many sons in places of command in the towns round about him. One of whom named Pittheus, grandfather to Theseus, was governor of the small city of the Troezenians, and had the repute of a man of the greatest knowledge and wisdom of his time; which then, it seems, consisted chiefly in grave maxims, such as the poet Hesiod got his great fame by, in his book of Works and Days.  And, indeed, among these is one that they ascribe to Pittheus,--  Unto a friend suffice A stipulated price;  which, also, Aristotle mentions.  And Euripides, by calling Hippolytus \" scholar of the holy Pittheus,\" shows the opinion that the world had of him.  Aegeus, being desirous of children, and consulting the oracle of Delphi, received the celebrated answer which forbade him the company of any woman before his return to Athens.  But the oracle being so obscure as not to satisfy him that he was clearly forbid this, he went to Troezen, and communicated to Pittheus the voice of the god, which was in this manner,--  Loose not the wine-skin foot, thou chief of men, Until to Athens thou art come again.  Pittheus, therefore, taking advantage from the obscurity of the oracle, prevailed upon him, it is uncertain whether by persuasion or deceit, to lie with his daughter Aethra.  Aegeus afterwards, knowing her whom he had lain with to be Pittheus's daughter, and suspecting her to be with child by him, left a sword and a pair of shoes, hiding them under a great stone that had a hollow in it exactly fitting them; and went away making her only privy to it, and commanding her, if she brought forth a son who, when he came to man's estate, should be able to lift up the stone and take away what he had left there, she should send him away to him with those things with all secrecy, and with injunctions to him as much as possible to conceal his journey from every one; for he greatly feared the Pallantidae, who were continually mutinying against him, and despised him for his want of children, they themselves being fifty brothers, all sons of Pallas.  When Aethra was delivered of a son, some say that he was immediately named Theseus, from the tokens which his father had put @ under the stone; others that he received his name afterwards at Athens, when Aegeus acknowledged him for his son.  He was brought up under his grandfather Pittheus, and had a tutor and attendant set over him named Connidas, to whom the Athenians, even to this time, the day before the feast that is dedicated to Theseus, sacrifice a ram, giving this honor to his memory upon much juster grounds than to Silanio and Parrhasius, for making pictures and statues of Theseus.  There being then a custom for the Grecian youth, upon their first coming to man's estate, to go to Delphi and offer first-fruits of their hair to the god, Theseus also went thither, and a place there to this day is yet named Thesea, as it is said, from him.  He clipped only the fore part of his head, as Homer says the Abantes did.%  And this sort of tonsure was from him named Theseis.  The Abantes first used it, not in imitation of the Arabians, as some imagine, nor of the Mysians, but because they were a warlike people, and used to close fighting, and above all other nations accustomed to engage hand to hand; as Archilochus testifies in these verses: --  Slings shall not whirl, nor many arrows fly, When on the plain the battle joins; but swords, Man against man, the deadly conflict try, As is the practice of Euboea's lords Skilled with the spear.--  Therefore that they might not give their enemies a hold by their hair, they cut it in this manner.  They write also that this was the reason why Alexander gave command to his captains that all the beards of the Macedonians should be shaved, as being the readiest hold for an enemy.  Aethra for some time concealed the true parentage of Theseus, and a report was given out by Pittheus that he was begotten by Neptune; for the Troezenians pay Neptune the highest veneration.  He is their tutelar god, to him they offer all their first-fruits, and in his honor stamp their money with a trident.  Theseus displaying not only great strength of body, but equal bravery, and a quickness alike and force of understanding, his mother Aethra, conducting him to the stone, and informing him who was his true father, commanded him to take from thence the tokens that Aegeus had left, and to sail to Athens.  He without any difficulty set himself to the stone and lifted it up; but refused to take his journey by sea, though it was much the safer way, and though his mother and grandfather begged him to do so.  For it was at that time very dangerous to go by land on the road to Athens, no part of it being free from robbers and murderers.  That age produced a sort of men, in force of hand, and swiftness of foot, and strength of body, excelling the ordinary rate, and wholly incapable of fatigue; making use, however, of these gifts of nature to no good or profitable purpose for mankind, but rejoicing and priding themselves in insolence, and taking the benefit of their superior strength in the exercise of inhumanity and cruelty, and in seizing, forcing, and committing all manner of outrages upon every thing that fell into their hands; all respect for others, all justice, they thought, all equity and humanity, though naturally lauded by common people, either out of want of courage to commit injuries or fear to receive them, yet no way concerned those who were strong enough to win for themselves.  Some of these, Hercules destroyed and cut off in his passage through these countries, but some, escaping his notice while he was passing by, fled and hid themselves, or else were spared by him in contempt of their abject submission; and after that Hercules fell into misfortune, and, having slain Iphitus, retired to Lydia, and for a long time was there slave to Omphale, a"]]]
