Having gone about a quarter of a league along certain mountains, we found none, nor did we recognize any resemblance to the description of the harbor he had given us. Accordingly, he had not himself been there, but probably two or three of his men had been there, guided by some savages, partly by land and partly by little streams, while he awaited them in his shallop at the mouth of a little river in the Bay of St. Lawrence.[68] These men, upon their return, brought him several small pieces of copper, which he showed us when he returned from his voyage. Nevertheless, we found in this harbor two mines of what seemed to be copper according to the report of our miner, who considered it very good, although it was not native copper.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE MAP.

There is a creek extending from near      Spencer's Island between the rocky elevations to Advocate's Harbor, or      nearly so, which Champlain does not appear to have seen, or at least      he does not represent it on his map. This point, thus made an island      by the creek, has an elevation of five hundred feet, at the base of      which was the copper mine which they discovered.--_Vide_ note 67.] _G_.

All the land which we have seen in coasting along from the little passage of Long Island is rocky, and there is no place except Port Royal where vessels can lie in Safety. The land is covered with pines and birches, and, in my opinion, is not very good.  On the 20th of May,[70] we set out from the Port of Mines to seek a place adapted for a permanent stay, in order to lose no time, purposing afterwards to return, and see if we could discover the mine of pure copper which Prevert's men had found by aid of the savages. We sailed west two leagues as far as the cape of the two bays, then north five or six leagues; and we crossed the other bay,[71] where we thought the copper mine was, of which we have already spoken: inasmuch as there are there two rivers, [72] the one coming from the direction of Cape Breton, and the other from Gaspé or Tregatté, near the great river St. Lawrence. Sailing west some six leagues, we arrived at a little river,[73] at the mouth of which is rather a low cape, extending out into the sea; and a short distance inland there is a mountain,[74] having the shape of a Cardinal's hat. In this place we found an iron mine. There is anchorage here only for shallops. Four leagues west south-west is a rocky point [75] extending out a short distance into the water, where there are strong tides which are very dangerous. Near the point we saw a cove about half a league in extent, in which we found another iron mine, also very good. Four leagues farther on is a fine bay running up into the main land;[76] at the extremity of which there are three islands and a rock; two of which are a league from the cape towards the west, and the other is at the mouth of the largest and deepest river we had yet seen, which we named the river St. John, because it was on this saint's day that we arrived there.[77] By the savages it is called Ouygoudy. This river is dangerous, if one does not observe carefully certain points and rocks on the two sides. It is narrow at its entrance, and then becomes broader. A certain point being passed, it becomes narrower again, and forms a kind of fall between two large cliffs, where the water runs so rapidly that a piece of wood thrown in is drawn under and not seen again. But by waiting till high tide you can pass this fall very easily. [78] Then it expands again to the extent of about a league in some places, where there are three islands. We did not explore it farther up.[79] But Ralleau, secretary of Sieur de Monts, went there some time after to see a savage named Secondon, chief of this river, who reported that it was beautiful, large, and extensive, with many meadows and fine trees, as oaks, beeches, walnut-trees, and also wild grapevines. The inhabitants of the country go by this river to Tadoussac, on the great river St. Lawrence, making but a short portage on the journey. From the river St. John to Tadoussac is sixty-five leagues.[80] At its mouth, which is in latitude 45° 40', there is an iron mine.[81]         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING MAP.

Sieur de Poutrincourt came near getting lost here, but he came back to our barque at last, when we had already gone to search for him about the island, which is three leagues distant from the main land. Farther west are other islands; among them one six leagues in length, called by the savages Manthane,[83] south of which there are among the islands several good harbors for vessels. From the Magpie Islands we proceeded to a river on the main land called the river of the Etechemins,[84] a tribe of savages so called in their country. We passed by so many islands that we could not ascertain their number, which were very fine. Some were two leagues in extent, others three, others more or less. All of these islands are in a bay,[85] having, in my estimation, a circuit of more than fifteen leagues. There are many good places capable of containing any number of vessels, and abounding in fish in the season, such as codfish, salmon, bass, herring, halibut, and other kinds in great numbers. Sailing west-north-west three leagues through the islands, we entered a river almost half a league in breadth at its mouth, sailing up which a league or two we found two islands: one very small near the western bank; and the other in the middle, having a circumference of perhaps eight or nine hundred paces, with rocky sides three or four fathoms high all around, except in one small place, where there is a sandy point and clayey earth adapted for making brick and other useful articles. There is another place affording a shelter for vessels from eighty to a hundred tons, but it is dry at low tide. The island is covered with firs, birches, maples, and oaks. It is by nature very well situated, except in one place, where for about forty paces it is lower than elsewhere: this, however, is easily fortified, the banks of the main land being distant on both sides some nine hundred to a thousand paces. Vessels could pass up the river only at the mercy of the cannon on this island, and we deemed the location the most advantageous, not only on account of its situation and good foil, but also on account of the intercourse which we proposed with the savages of these coasts and of the interior, as we should be in the midst of them. We hoped to pacify them in the course of time, and put an end to the wars which they carry on with one another, so as to derive service from them in future, and convert them to the Christian faith. This place was named by Sieur de Monts the Island of St. Croix. [86] Farther on, there is a great bay, in which are two islands, one high and the other flat; also three rivers, two of moderate size, one extending towards the east, the other towards the north, and the third of large size, towards the west. The latter is that of the Etechemins, of which we spoke before. Two leagues up this there is a waterfall, around which the savages carry their canoes some five hundred paces by land, and then re-enter the river. Passing afterwards from the river a short distance overland, one reaches the rivers Norumbegue and St. John. But the falls are impassable for vessels, as there are only rocks and but four or five feet of water.[87] In May and June, so great a number of herring and bass are caught there that vessels could be loaded with them. The soil is of the finest sort, and there are fifteen or twenty acres of cleared land, where"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6749"],["title","Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 02 (#7)"],["body"," de Monts had some wheat sown, which flourished finely. The savages come here sometimes five or six weeks during the fishing Season. All the rest of the country consists of very dense forests. If the land were cleared up, grain would flourish excellently. This place is in latitude 45° 20',[88] and 17° 32' of the deflection of the magnetic needle.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING MAP.

It could not have been in May, since Champlain Set     out from Port Mouton on his exploring expedition on the 19th of May,     which must have been a month previous to this.  54. What is now called the Petit Passage, the narrow strait between Long     Island and Digby Neck.  55. Gulliver's Hole, about two leagues south-west of Digby Strait.  56. Champlain here names the whole harbor or basin Port Royal, and not the     place of habitation afterward so called. The first settlement was on     the north side of the bay in the present hamlet of Lower Granville, not     as often alleged at Annapolis.--_Vide_ Champlain's engraving or map of     Port Royal.  57. \"Équille.\" A name, on the coasts between Caen and Havre, of the fish     called lançon at Granville and St. Malo, a kind of malacopterygious     fish living on sandy shores and hiding in the sand at low tide.--     _Littré_. A species of sand eel. This stream is now known as the     Annapolis River. Lescarbot calls it Rivière du Dauphin.  58. This island is situated at the point where the Annapolis River flows     into the bay, or about nine miles from Digby, straight. Champlain on     his map gives it no name, but Lescarbot calls it Biencourville. It is     now called Goat Island.  59. Lescarbot calls it Claudiane. It is now known as Bear Island. It was     Sometimes called Ile d'Hébert, and likewise Imbert Island. Laverdière     suggests that the present name is derived from the French pronunciation     of the last syllable of Imbert.  60. At present known as Bear River; Lescarbot has it Hebert, and     Charlevoix, Imbert.  61. On modern maps called Moose River, and sometimes Deep Brook. It is a     few miles east of Bear River.  62. The latitude is here overstated: it should be 44° 39' 30\".  63. On the preceding year, M. Prevert of St. Malo had made a glowing report     ostensively based on his own observations and information which he had     obtained from the Indians, in regard to certain mines alleged to exist     on the coast directly South of Northumberland Strait, and about the     head of the Bay of Fundy. It was this report of Prevert that induced     the present search.  64. Along the Bay of Fundy nearly parallel to the basin of Port Royal would     better express the author's meaning.  65. Cape Chignecto, the point where the Bay of Fundy is bifurcated; the     northern arm forming Chignecto Bay, and the southern, the Bay of Mines     or Minas Basin.  66. Isle Haute, or high island.--_Vide Charlevoix's Map_. On Some maps this     name has been strangely perverted into Isle Holt, Isle Har, &c. Its     height is 320 feet.  67. This was Advocate's Harbor. Its distance from Cape Chignecto is greater     than that stated in the text. Further on, Champlain calls it two     leagues, which is nearly correct. Its latitude is about 45° 20'. By     comparing the Admiralty charts and Champlain's map of this harbor, it     will be seen that important changes have taken place since 1604. The     tongue of land extending in a south-easterly direction, covered with     trees and shrubbery, which Champlain calls a sand-bank, has entirely     disappeared. The ordinary tides rise here from thirty-three to     thirty-nine feet, and on a sandy shore could hardly fail to produce     important changes.  68. According to the Abbé Laverdière, the lower part of the Gulf was     sometimes called the Bay of St. Lawrence.  69. They had just crossed the Bay of Mines. From the place where they     crossed it to its head it is not far from fifteen leagues, and it is     about the same distance to Port Royal, from which he may here estimate     the distance inland.  70. Read June.--_Vide antea_, note 53.  71. Chignecto Bay. Charlevoix has Chignitou _ou Beau Bassin_. On De Laet's     Map of 1633, on Jacob von Meur's of 1673, and Homenn's of 1729, we have     B. de Gennes. The Cape of Two Bays was Cape Chignecto.  72. The rivers are the Cumberland Basin with its tributaries coming from     the east, and the Petitcoudiac (_petit_ and _coude_, little elbow, from     the angle formed by the river at Moncton, called the Bend), which flows     into Shepody Bay coming from the north or the direction of Gaspé.     Champlain mentions all these particulars, probably as answering to the     description given to them by M. Prevert of the place where copper mines     could be found.  73. Quaco River, at the mouth of which the water is shallow: the low cape     extending out into the sea is that on which Quaco Light now stands,     which reaches out quarter of a mile, and is comparatively low. The     shore from Goose River, near where they made the coast, is very high,     measuring at different points 783, 735, 650, 400, 300, 500, and 380     feet, while the \"low cape\" is only 250 feet, and near it on the west is     an elevation of 400 feet. It would be properly represented as \"rather a     low cape\" in contradistinction to the neighboring coast. Iron and     manganese are found here, and the latter has been mined to some extent,     but is now discontinued, as the expense is too great for the present     times.  74. This mountain is an elevation, eight or ten miles inland from Quaco,     which may be seen by vessels coasting along from St. Martin's Head to     St. John: it is indicated on the charts as Mt. Theobald, and bears a     striking resemblance, as Champlain suggests, to the _chapeau de     Cardinal_.  75. McCoy's Head, four leagues west of Quaco: the \"cove\" may be that on the     east into which Gardner's Creek flows, or that on the west at the mouth     of Emmerson's Creek.  76. The Bay of St. John, which is four leagues south-west of McCoy's     Head. The islands mentioned are Partridge Island at the mouth of the     harbor, and two smaller ones farther west, one Meogenes, and the other     Shag rock or some unimportant islet in its vicinity. The rock mentioned     by Champlain is that on which Spit Beacon Light now stands.  77. The festival of St. John the Baptist occurs on the 24th of June; and,     arriving on that day, they gave the name of St. John to the river,     which has been appropriately given also to the city at its mouth, now     the metropolis of the province of New Brunswick.  78. Champlain was under a missapprehension about passing the fall at the     mouth of the St. John at high tide. It can in fact only be passed at     about half tide. The waters of the river at low tide are about twelve     feet higher than the waters of the sea. At high tide, the waters of the     sea are about five feet higher than the waters of the river.     Consequently, at low tide there is a fall outward, and at high tide     there is a fall inward, at neither of which times can the fall be     passed. The only time for passing the fall is when the waters of the     sea are on a level with the waters of the river. This occurs twice     every tide, at the level point at the flood and likewise at the ebb.     The period for passing lasts about fifteen or twenty minutes, and of     course occurs four times a day. Vessels assemble in considerable     numbers above and below to embrace the opportunity of passing at the     favoring moment. There are periods, however, when the river is swollen     by rains and melting snow, at which the tides do not rise as high as     the river, and consequently there is a constant fall outward, and     vessels cannot pass until the high water subsides.  79. They ascended the river only a short distance into the large bay just     above the falls, near which are the three islands mentioned in the     text.  80. The distance from the mouth of the river St. John to Tadoussac in a     direct line is about sixty-five leagues. But by the winding course of     the St. John it would be very much greater.  81. Champlain's latitude is inexact. St. John's Harbor is 45° 16'.  82. _Margos_, magpies. The four islands which Champlain named the Magpies     are now called the Wolves, and are near the mouth of Passamaquoddy     Bay. Charlevoix has _Oiseaux_, the Birds.  83. Manan. Known as the Grand Manan in contradistinction to the Petit     Manan, a small island still further west. It is about fourteen or     fifteen miles long, and about six in its greatest width. On the south     and eastern side are Long Island, Great Duck, Ross, Cheyne, and White"]]]
