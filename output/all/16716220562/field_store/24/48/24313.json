In his own limited experience, Lawry could recall many instances where haste had made waste; but the foolish conduct of Mr. Sherwood in attempting to navigate the _Woodville_ in water with which he was totally unacquainted was the most impressive example of the worth of the proverb, and he felt that the steamer, in his own possession, would always mean \"haste and waste\" to him.  \"I have often heard my father speak of the folly of unconsidered action and blind haste,\" said Bertha. \"He lost a valued friend in the steamship _Arctic_, which was sunk, and hundreds of lives sacrificed, by running at full speed in a dense fog. In her case, haste was not only a terrible waste of property, but of life.\"  \"That will be worth remembering, Lawry, when you are in command of a steamer,\" added Mr. Sherwood.  \"I don't think I ever shall be in such a position,\" replied Lawry modestly.  \"I am afraid you never will be on board of the _Woodville_.\"  \"I'm pretty sure she can be raised, though I may not have the means to do it myself,\" continued Lawry.  \"You shall have all the means you want, my boy,\" replied Mr. Sherwood. \"We owe you a debt of gratitude which we shall never be able to pay, and if you want anything, don't fail to call upon me.\"  \"If you need any help, Lawry, I'm with you,\" said Ethan French.  \"Thank you; I dare say I shall want all the help I can get,\" answered Lawry, as he took his leave of the family.  \"I'm the owner of a steamboat!\" thought he. \"I'm a lucky fellow, and I shall make my fortune in the _Woodville_. I can take out parties, or I can run her on a day route from Burlington up the lake; and there is towing enough to keep me busy all summer.\"  Excited by the brightest visions of the future, he came in sight of his father's cottage. It looked poorer and meaner than it had ever looked before; and perhaps he thought it was hardly a fit abode for a steamboat proprietor. When he saw the tall mast of the ferry-boat, with the sail flapping idly in the wind, he was reminded of the events which had occurred on board of her that afternoon. It was mortifying to think that his father had even been tempted to steal; but he was rejoiced to know that he had been induced to return the six thousand dollars to the owner.  Lawry had not seen his father since he left the landing-place to board the _Woodville_. He was not at the house when the party landed, after the catastrophe, and Lawry was glad he was not there, for his absence assured the anxious son that he had gone in search of Mr. Randall. Amid the exciting events which had followed the painful discovery that his father intended to steal the six thousand dollars, the young pilot had not thought of the matter, for his mind was entirely relieved by Mr. Wilford's promise to give up the money.  Lawry went into the house; his father had not yet returned, and his mother asked him a hundred questions about the steamboat disaster, as she set the table for supper. When the meal was ready, Mrs. Wilford went to the door and blew a tin horn, which was intended to summon the ferryman to his tea.  \"I think father has not got back yet,\" said Lawry.  \"Where has he gone?\"  \"Up to the village, I believe,\" replied Lawry, who had determined not to tell his mother of the great temptation to which his father had almost yielded.  \"What has he gone up there for?\" inquired Mrs. Wilford, who perhaps saw in the anxious looks of her son that something had been concealed from her.  \"He had a little business up there,\" answered the young pilot. \"I think we had better not wait for him, for he may not be back for some time. I haven't shown you this paper, mother,\" he continued, wishing to draw off her attention from his father, as he handed her the bill of sale of the _Woodville_, and seated himself at the table.  \"What is it, Lawry?\"  \"It is a bill of sale of the little steamer.\"  \"A what?\" demanded Mrs. Wilford, as she paused with the teapot suspended over a cup.  \"A bill of sale of the new steamer.\"  \"What, the one that was sunk?\"  \"Yes; Mr. Sherwood has given her to me, just as she lies.\"  \"Humph! He might as well have given you a five-acre lot at the bottom of the lake. What in the world can you do with a steamboat smashed to pieces and sunk?\"  \"I can raise her.\"  \"You may as well think of raising the Goblins on which she sank.\"  \"She can be raised, mother.\"  \"Perhaps she can, but you can't raise her.\"  \"I shall try, at any rate,\" replied Lawry confidently.  The conversation was interrupted by the arrival of the ferryman. The son cast an anxious glance at his father, as the latter took his accustomed place at the table. A forced smile played about the lips of Mr. Wilford; but Lawry interpreted it as an effort to overcome the sense of humiliation his father must feel at having his dishonest intentions discovered by his son.  \"Well, Lawry, I found him,\" said Mr. Wilford.  \"Did you? I'm very glad you did,\" replied the son.  \"Who?\" asked Mrs. Wilford.  \"The bank man--the one that lost the money,\" replied the ferryman.  \"What did you want of him?\"  \"We found his money after he had gone.\"  \"Did you? I'm so glad! And neither of you said a word to me about it.\"  \"I gave it back to him, and it's all right now.\"  Unhappily, it was not all right; and the ferryman had scarcely uttered the words before a knock was heard at the door. Without awaiting the movements of Mrs. Wilford, who rose from the table to open the door, the visitors entered. Mr. Wilford turned deadly pale, for the first person that passed the threshold was the sheriff, whose face was familiar to the ferryman. He was followed by Mr. Randall and a constable.  Lawry's heart sank within him when he saw who the visitors were. He feared that his father, in spite of his statement to the contrary, had been led to appropriate the six thousand dollars. It was a moment of agony to him, and he would have given his right, title, and interest in the sunken steamer for the assurance that his parent was an honest man.  \"I come on rather unpleasant business, Mr. Wilford,\" the sheriff began; \"but I suppose I may as well speak out first as last.\"  \"Goodness! what can you want here!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wilford.  \"Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Wilford,\" said the sheriff. \"It may be all right, for what I know. Mr. Randall, here, has lost a large sum of money, and he thinks he has been robbed. I'm sure I hope it's all right.\"  \"Why, husband!\" ejaculated Mrs. Wilford; \"didn't you just say--\"  \"I didn't say anything,\" interposed the ferryman.  Lawry was quite as pale as his father. He would rather have been accused of the crime himself than had it charged upon his father; he would rather have gone to prison himself than had him dragged away on such an infamous accusation. The sheriff's encouraging words that it might be all right, had no force or comfort for him. Lawry knew that his father was guilty, and he was in despair.  Mrs. Wilford had only heard that the money was lost, at first; and then, from her husband, that it had been found and restored to the owner. It was plain that he had told her a falsehood; that if he had found the money, it was still in his possession. The case was too plain to need much reflection. Mr. Randall and the sheriff knew less than the ferryman, less than his wife and his son; but in the good woman's estimation, it was far worse to be guilty than it was to be detected.  It would be difficult to fathom the motives which induced John Wilford to tell his wife and son that the money had been restored to the owner. Perhaps he had some plan by which he hoped to escape detection and punishment for his crime; or it may be that he told the falsehood to satisfy Lawry for the present moment. His calculations, whatever they may have been, were exceedingly stupid and ill digested. There was an utter want of skill and judgment in his operations. He was not a strong-minded man, and his guilt seemed to have paralyzed his weak faculties. His failure to be rich in the path of dishonesty was even more signal than his honest but weak efforts in a legitimate business.  \"What did he just say?\" asked the sheriff, whose attention was attracted by Mrs. Wilford's words, but more by the sharp manner of her husband as he interrupted her.  \"What is your business with me?\" demanded the ferryman of the sheriff, earnestly.  \"What did he say?\" repeated the sheriff.  \"If my husband has been doing anything wrong, I'm sorry for it,\" replied Mrs. Wilford.  \"Mr. Randall thinks he has taken his money,\" added the sheriff. \"If you can tell me what your husband just said, it might throw some light on the matter.\"  \"Oh, husband!\" cried the poor wife, throwing herself into a chair and weeping bitterly.  \"Mr. Randall knows I haven't taken his money,\" protested the ferryman stoutly.  \"Don't cry, marm,\" said the sheriff, moved by the distress of the afflicted wife. \"Nothing has been proved yet, and for all I know, your husband may be as honest as any man in Essex County.\"  \"I've always been an honest man, and I always expect to be,\" added the culprit. \"I haven't got the money. If any of you think I have, why don't you do something about it--not try to frighten my wife?\"  Mr. Wilford was searched by the sheriff and constable, but the money was not upon his person. The house was then carefully examined, but with no different result.  \"Do you know anything about this business, Lawry?\" said the sheriff, when the search was completed.  \"I don't think he had anything to do with it,\" interposed Mr. Randall. \"The boy helped me look for the pocketbook, and behaved very handsomely; but I didn't like the looks of his father.\"  \"What did your father say just before we came?\" asked the sheriff.  Lawry was stupefied with grief and shame. He knew not what to say, and he dropped his head upon the table, and sobbed like a little child.  \"Things look bad, Mr. Wilford. Your wife and Lawry know more than they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6572"],["title","Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain. A Story for Young People (#7)"],["body","willing to tell,\" continued the officer.  \"You have scared them half out of their wits,\" replied the ferryman, trying to smile.  \"It isn't likely we can find out anything here,\" said the constable. \"If he has got the money, he has hid it round the house somewhere.\"  Adopting this suggestion, the officers, followed by Mr. Randall, left the cottage to examine the vicinity. The constable was a shrewd man, and for a country locality, quite distinguished as a thief-taker. The shower early in the afternoon had left the ground in condition to receive the tracks of every individual who had been near the ferry.  The sharp officer examined all the marks in the earth, and finally followed the footsteps of John Wilford, through a corn-field, above the cottage.  Mrs. Wilford and Lawry wept as though their hearts would break, while the ferryman, trembling with apprehension, paced the kitchen.  \"What are you crying for?\" said he impatiently.  \"Oh, John!\" sobbed his wife.  \"Nothing has been proved.\"  \"Yes, there has. You told me you had given the money to Mr. Randall.\"  \"You told me you would restore it to the owner, when I gave you the pocketbook,\" added Lawry.  \"Lawry, if you say a word about it, you shall go to jail with me,\" said Mr. Wilford angrily.     CHAPTER VII  \"THE FERRYMAN'S CRIME\"   Mr. Wilford, in spite of his faults and peculiarities, was a kind father, and never before had been heard to utter such terrible words as those which had just passed his lips. It was a consolation to Lawry and his mother to believe that the words were only a threat which was never intended to be executed, and only made to awe the youth into silence. It was needless; for, right or wrong, the son would have died rather than betray his father.  John Wilford's operations in hiding the money were as transparent as his efforts to quiet the suspicions of his family. The constable followed his tracks in the soft ground of the corn-field till he came to a stump in one corner of the lot. It was decayed and hollow, and in one of the cavities the pocketbook was discovered. Mr. Randall laughed for joy when it was handed up to him. Its contents were undisturbed, and not a dollar of the money was missing. The party walked back to the house, having been absent less than half an hour. The ferryman was just coming out as they entered the gate.  \"I hope you are satisfied,\" said he, confident that the officers would never think of crossing the corn-field in search of the lost treasure.  \"I'm satisfied, Mr. Wilford,\" said the sheriff.  \"Don't you think it is a mean thing to come here and accuse me of robbing one of my passengers?\" continued the ferryman.  \"I don't think so.\"  \"In my opinion, Mr. Randall hasn't lost any money. I don't believe a man would throw his coat down anywhere if there was six thousand dollars in the pocket.\"  \"But the money was lost, whether you believe it or not,\" interposed the bank director, irritated by this charge.  \"I've heard of such a thing as men losing money to cheat their creditors, or something of that sort,\" added the ferryman.  \"Don't talk so, husband,\" said Mrs. Wilford, who, with Lawry, had come out of the house when they heard the voice of the sheriff, anxious to learn the result of the search.  \"Don't you think that's mean, to accuse a man of cheating his creditors, after you have stolen his money?\" retorted Mr. Randall.  \"What right have you to say I stole your money?\" demanded Mr. Wilford, with a show of intense indignation.  \"Because you did.\"  \"Can you prove it?\"  \"I think I can.\"  \"No, you can't. I don't believe you lost any money. It's only a trick to cheat the bank or your creditors.\"  \"We shall see.\"  \"Don't talk so, husband,\" repeated Mrs. Wilford.  \"Keep still, wife. When a man hasn't done anything, it's hard to be charged with stealing six thousand dollars. They can't prove anything.\"  \"Yes, we can, Mr. Wilford,\" interposed the sheriff. \"It becomes my duty to arrest you, though I would rather have done it when your family were not present.\"  \"Arrest me! What for?\" exclaimed John Wilford. \"You can't prove anything.\"  \"Yes, we can,\" replied the sheriff.  \"What can you prove?\"  \"I think it would be better for you not to talk so much,\" added the sheriff, in a low tone. \"Come with me, and I will do my duty as quietly as possible.\"  \"Come with you! What for?\" said Mr. Wilford, in a loud tone. \"I didn't steal the money.\"  \"It's a plain case. It's no use for you to deny it any longer.\"  \"But I didn't.\"  \"We have found the money, just where you put it.\"  \"Found--what!\" stammered the guilty man.  \"Oh, husband!\" groaned Mrs. Wilford.  \"Oh, father!\" sobbed Lawry.  \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilford,\" said the kind-hearted officer; \"but it's all as plain as daylight. He took the money and hid it in a stump in the corn-field, where we found it.\"  \"What shall we do?\" cried Mrs. Wilford.  \"It's a bad business, marm, but I can't help it. I must do my duty.\"  Mr. Wilford leaned on the garden-fence, with his gaze fixed upon the ground. He could not look the loved ones in the face, after the crime he had committed. The smaller children, who had been at play around the house, were now gathered about the group, unable fully to comprehend the terrible misfortune which had befallen them; though, as they gazed on Lawry and their mother, they could not help realizing that something very sad had happened.  \"I'm ready to go with you,\" said John Wilford to the sheriff, for the scene was too affecting and humiliating.  \"Oh, husband, why did you do it?\" exclaimed Mrs. Wilford, as she grasped one of his arms, clinging to him like a true woman, in spite of his shame and infamy.  \"I don't know why I did it. I was crazy. I wanted to be rich,\" replied the unhappy man.  \"I wish you had given back the money, as you said you did.\"  \"I wish I had now.\"  \"Can nothing be done?\" continued Mrs. Wilford, appealing to the sheriff. \"Must he go with you?\"  \"He must; my duty is as plain as it can be.\"  The poor woman suggested various expedients to avoid the fearful consequences; she appealed to the bank director, and begged him not to prosecute her husband. Mr. Randall, though he had been greatly irritated by the cruel insinuations of the culprit, was not a malignant man; and he was disposed to grant the petition of the disconsolate wife. He had recovered his money, and had no malice against the ferryman. But the sheriff declared that no such arrangement could be tolerated. The matter had been placed in his hands, and, as a sworn officer of the law, he should be obliged to arrest the offender.  In vain Mrs. Wilford pleaded for her husband; in vain Lawry pleaded for his father; the sheriff, kind and considerate as he had shown himself to be, was inexorable in the discharge of his duty. There was no alternative; and John Wilford must go to jail. The poor wife, when she found that her tears and her pleadings were unavailing, submitted to the stern necessity. She insisted that her husband should be allowed to change his dress, which the sheriff readily granted; and in a short time the culprit appeared in his best clothes. It was a sad parting between him and his family, and even the ferryman wept as he passed out from beneath his humble roof, not again to come beneath its friendly shelter for many, many weary months.  Mrs. Wilford and Lawry were stunned by the heavy blow. The light of earthly joys seemed suddenly to have gone out, and left them in the gloom and woe of disgrace. There was nothing to be said at such a time, and they sobbed in silence, until the sound of the ferry-horn roused Lawry from his lethargy of grief. Some one wished to cross the lake, and had given the usual signal with the tin horn, placed on a post for the purpose, at the side of the road.  \"There is no ferryman here now,\" said Mrs. Wilford gloomily.  \"I will go, mother,\" replied Lawry.  \"It may be many a day before your father comes back,\" added Mrs. Wilford, as she wiped away her tears. \"It is a great deal worse than a funeral.\"  \"We can't help it, mother, and I suppose we must make the best of it.\"  \"I suppose we must; but I don't know what we are going to do.\"  \"We shall do well enough, mother. I will attend to the ferry; but poor father--\"  Lawry, finding he could not speak without a fresh flow of tears, hastened out of the house. There were two wagons waiting for him; and when they were embarked in the boat, he pushed off, and trimmed the sail for the gentle breeze that was blowing up the lake. The passengers asked for his father; but Lawry could only tell them that he had gone away: the truth was too painful for him to reveal. He returned to his desolate home when he had ferried the wagons over the lake. There was nothing but misery in that humble abode, and but little sleep for those who were old enough to comprehend the sadness and shame of their situation.  Before morning the news of John Wilford's crime had been circulated through the village of Port Rock and its vicinity. Some knew that the ferryman was lazy and thriftless, and wondered he had not robbed somebody before. Others had always regarded him as a person of no sagacity or forethought, but did not think he would steal. Many pitied his family, and some said that Lawry was \"as smart as two of his father,\" and that his mother and the children would be well provided for.  The intelligence went to the mansion of Mr. Sherwood, and there it touched the hearts of true friends. Though none of them knew much about the ferryman and his family, yet for Lawry's sake they were deeply interested in them.  After breakfast Mr. Sherwood went down to the ferry-house; and the young pilot, with many tears and sobs, told him the whole of the sad story of his father's crime. The rich man was full of sympathy, but nothing could be done. He volunteered to be the culprit's bail, and to provide him with the best counsel in the State. But John Wilford was guilty, and nothing could wipe out this terrible truth.  Mr. Sherwood did all he had"]]]
