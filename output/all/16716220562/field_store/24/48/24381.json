The following account by an eye-witness will not be     uninteresting: \"Especially it yieldeth store of pearls, those gems     which the Latin writers call _Uniones_, because _nulli duo reperiuntur     discreti_, they always are found to grow in couples. In this Island     there are many rich Merchants who have thirty, forty, fifty _Blackmore_     slaves only to fish out of the sea about the rocks these pearls....     They are let down in baskets into the Sea, and so long continue under     the water, until by pulling the rope by which they are let down, they     make their sign to be taken up.... From _Margarita_ are all the Pearls     sent to be refined and bored to _Carthagena_, where is a fair and     goodly street of no other shops then of these Pearl dressers. Commonly     in the month of _July_ there is a ship or two at most ready in the     Island to carry the King's revenue, and the Merchant's pearls to     _Carthagena_. One of these ships is valued commonly at three score     thousand or four score thousand ducats and sometimes more, and     therefore are reasonable well manned; for that the _Spaniards_ much     fear our _English_ and the _Holland_ ships.\"--_Vide New Survey of the     West Indies_, by Thomas Gage, London, 1677, p. 174.  21. _Caymans_, Crocodiles.  22.

At the time that Champlain was at the isthmus, in 1599-1601, the gold     and silver of Peru were brought to Panama, then transported on mules a     distance of about four leagues to a river, known as the Rio Chagres,     whence they were conveyed by water first to Chagres, and thence along     the coast to Porto-bello, and there shipped to Spain.      Champlain refers to a ship-canal in the following words: \"One might     judge, if the territory four leagues in extent lying between Panama and     this river were cut through, he could pass from the south sea to that     on the other side, and thus shorten the route by more than fifteen     hundred leagues. From Panama to the Straits of Magellan would     constitute an island, and from Panama to New Foundland another, so that     the whole of America would be in two islands.\"--_Vide Brief Discours     des Choses Plus Rémarquables_, par Sammuel Champlain de Brovage, 1599,     Quebec ed., Vol. I. p 141. This project of a ship canal across the     isthmus thus suggested by Champlain two hundred and eighty years ago is     now attracting the public attention both in this country and in Europe.     Several schemes are on foot for bringing it to pass, and it will     undoubtedly be accomplished, if it shall be found after the most     careful and thorough investigation to be within the scope of human     power, and to offer adequate commercial advantages.      Some of the difficulties to be overcome are suggested by Mr. Marsh in     the following excerpt--      \"The most colossal project of canalization ever suggested, whether we     consider the physical difficulties of its execution, the magnitude and     importance of the waters proposed to be united, or the distance which     would be saved in navigation, is that of a channel between the Gulf of     Mexico and the Pacific, across the Isthmus of Darien. I do not now     speak of a lock-canal, by way of the Lake of Nicaragua, or any other     route,--for such a work would not differ essentially from other canals     and would scarcely possess a geographical character,--but of an open     cut between the two seas. The late survey by Captain Selfridge, showing     that the lowest point on the dividing ridge is 763 feet above the     sea-level, must be considered as determining in the negative the     question of the possibility of such a cut, by any means now at the     control of man; and both the sanguine expectations of benefits, and the     dreary suggestions of danger from the realization of this great dream,     may now be dismissed as equally chimerical.\"--_Vide The Earth as     Modified by Human Action_, by George P.

No positive evidence is known to exist as to the time when Champlain     was ennobled. It seems most likely to have been in acknowledgment of     his valuable report made to Henry IV. after his visit to the West     Indies.  26. Amyar de Chastes died on the 13th of May, 1603, greatly respected and     beloved by his fellow-citizens. He was charged by his government with     many important and responsible duties. In 1583, he was sent by Henry     III., or rather by Catherine de Médicis, to the Azores with a military     force to sustain the claims of Antonio, the Prior of Crato, to the     throne of Portugal. He was a warm friend and supporter of Henry IV.,     and took an active part in the battles of Ivry and Arques. He commanded     the French fleet on the coasts of Brittany; and, during the long     struggle of this monarch with internal enemies and external foes, he     was in frequent communication with the English to secure their     co-operation, particularly against the Spanish. He accompanied the Duke     de Boullon, the distinguished Huguenot nobleman, to England, to be     present and witness the oath of Queen Elizabeth to the treaty made with     France.      On this occasion he received a valuable jewel as a present from the     English queen. He afterwards directed the ceremonies and entertainment     of the Earl of Shrewsbury, who was deputed to receive the ratification     of the before-mentioned treaty by Henry IV. _Vide Busk's His.

He had been associated with     Chauvin in the Canada trade, and continued to visit the St Lawrence for     this purpose almost yearly for thirty years.      He was greatly respected by Champlain, and was closely associated with     him till 1629. After the English captured Quebec, he appears to have     retired, forced to do so by the infirmities of age.  29. Jean Parmentier, of Dieppe, author of the _Discorso d'un gran capitano_     in Ramusio, Vol. III., p. 423, wrote in the year 1539, and he says the     Bretons and Normans were in our northern waters thirty-five years     before, which would be in 1504. _Vide_ Mr. Parkman's learned note and     citations in _Pioneers of France in the New World_, pp. 171, 172. The     above is doubtless the authority on which the early writers, such as     Pierre Biard, Champlain, and others, make the year 1504 the period when     the French voyages for fishing commenced.  30. _Vide Voyage of Iohn Alphonse of Xanctoigne_, Hakluyt, Vol. III., p.     293.  31.

The Duke of Sully's disapprobation is expressed in the following words:     \"The colony that was sent to Canada this year, was among the number of     those things that had not my approbation; there was no kind of riches     to be expected from all those countries of the new world, which are     beyond the fortieth degree of latitude.

Taking a more southerly course than he had originally intended, De Monts came in sight of La Hève on the 8th of May, and on the 12th entered Liverpool harbor, where he found Captain Rossignol, of Havre de Grâce, carrying on a contraband trade in furs with the Indians, whom he arrested, and confiscated his vessel.  The next day they anchored at Port Mouton, where they lingered three or four weeks, awaiting news from Pont Gravé, who had in the mean time arrived at Canseau, the rendezvous agreed upon before leaving France. Pont Gravé had there discovered several Basque ships engaged in the fur-trade. Taking possession of them, he sent their masters to De Monts. The ships were subsequently confiscated and sent to Rochelle.  Captain Fouques was despatched"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6653"],["title","Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 01 (#8)"],["body"," Canseau in the vessel which had been taken from Rossignol, to bring forward the supplies which had been brought over by Pont Gravé. Having transshipped the provisions intended for the colony, Pont Gravé proceeded through the Straits of Canseau up the St. Lawrence, to trade with the Indians, upon the profits of which the company relied largely for replenishing their treasury.  In the mean time Champlain was sent in a barque of eight tons, with the secretary Sieur Ralleau, Mr. Simon, the miner, and ten men, to reconnoitre the coast towards the west. Sailing along the shore, touching at numerous points, doubling Cape Sable, he entered the Bay of Fundy, and after exploring St. Mary's Bay, and discovering several mines of both silver and iron, returned to Port Mouton and made to De Monts a minute and careful report.  De Monts immediately weighed anchor and sailed for the Bay of St. Mary, where he left his vessel, and, with Champlain, the miner, and some others, proceeded to explore the Bay of Fundy. They entered and examined Annapolis harbor, coasted along the western shores of Nova Scotia, touching at the Bay of Mines, passing over to New Brunswick, skirting its whole southeastern coast, entering the harbor of St. John, and finally penetrating Passamaquoddy Bay as far as the mouth of the river St. Croix, and fixed upon De Monts's Island [34] as the seat of their colony. The vessel at St. Mary's with the colonists was ordered to join them, and immediately active measures were taken for laying out gardens, erecting dwellings and storehouses, and all the necessary preparations for the coming winter. Champlain was commissioned to design and lay out the town, if so it could be called.  When the work was somewhat advanced, he was sent in a barque of five or six tons, manned with nine sailors, to search for a mine of pure copper, which an Indian named Messamoüet had assured them he could point out to them on the coast towards the river St. John. Some twenty-five miles from the river St. Croix, they found a mine yielding eighteen per cent, as estimated by the miner; but they did not discover any pure copper, as they had hoped.  On the last day of August, 1604, the vessel which had brought out the colony, together with that which had been taken from Rossignol, took their departure for the shores of France. In it sailed Poutrincourt, Ralleau the secretary of De Monts, and Captain Rossignol.  From the moment of his arrival on the coast of America, Champlain employed his leisure hours in making sketches and drawings of the most important rivers, harbors, and Indian settlements which they had visited.  While the little colony at De Monts's Island was active in getting its appointments arranged and settled, De Monts wisely determined, though he could not accompany it himself, nevertheless to send out an expedition during the mild days of autumn, to explore the region still further to the south, then called by the Indians Norumbegue. Greatly to the satisfaction of Champlain, he was personally charged, with this important expedition. He set out on the 2d of September, in a barque of seventeen or eighteen tons, with twelve sailors and two Indian guides. The inevitable fogs of that region detained them nearly a fortnight before they were able to leave the banks of Passamaquoddy. Passing along the rugged shores of Maine, with its endless chain of islands rising one after another into view, which they called the Ranges, they at length came to the ancient Pemetiq, lying close in to the shore, having the appearance at sea of seven or eight mountains drawn together and springing from the same base. This Champlain named _Monts Déserts_, which we have anglicized into Mount Desert, [35] an appellation which has survived the vicissitudes of two hundred and seventy-five years, and now that the island, with its salubrious air and cool shades, its bold and picturesque scenery, is attracting thousands from the great cities during the heats of summer, the name is likely to abide far down into a distant and indefinite future.  Leaving Mount Desert, winding their way among numerous islands, taking a northerly direction, they soon entered the Penobscot, [36] known by the early navigators as the river Norumbegue. They proceeded up the river as far as the mouth of an affluent now known as the Kenduskeag, [37] which was then called, or rather the place where it made a junction with the Penobscot was called by the natives, _Kadesquit_, situated at the head of tide-water, near the present site of the city of Bangor. The falls above the city intercepted their further progress. The river-banks about the harbor were fringed with a luxurious growth of forest trees. On one side, lofty pines reared their gray trunks, forming a natural palisade along the shore. On the other, massive oaks alone were to be seen, lifting their sturdy branches to the skies, gathered into clumps or stretching out into long lines, as if a landscape gardener had planted them to please the eye and gratify the taste. An exploration revealed the whole surrounding region clothed in a similar wild and primitive beauty.  After a leisurely survey of the country, they returned to the mouth of the river. Contrary to what might have been expected, Champlain found scarcely any inhabitants dwelling on the borders of the Penobscot. Here and there they saw a few deserted wigwams, which were the only marks of human occupation. At the mouth of the river, on the borders of Penobscot Bay, the native inhabitants were numerous. They were of a friendly disposition, and gave their visitors a cordial welcome, readily entered into negotiations for the sale of beaver-skins, and the two parties mutually agreed to maintain a friendly intercourse in the future.  Having obtained from the Indians some valuable information as to the source of the Penobscot, and observed their mode of life, which did not differ from that which they had seen still further east, Champlain departed on the 20th of September, directing his course towards the Kennebec. But, encountering bad weather, he found it necessary to take shelter under the lee of the island of Monhegan.  After sailing three or four leagues farther, finding that his provisions would not warrant the continuance of the voyage, he determined, on the 23d of September, to return to the settlement at Saint Croix, or what is now known as De Monts's Island, where they arrived on the 2d day of October, 1604.  De Monts's Island, having an area of not more than six or seven acres, is situated in the river Saint Croix, midway between its opposite shores, directly upon the dividing line between the townships of Calais and Robinston in the State of Maine. At the northern end of the island, the buildings of the settlement were clustered together in the form of a quadrangle with an open court in the centre. First came the magazine and lodgings of the soldiers, then the mansion of the governor, De Monts, surmounted by the colors of France. Houses for Champlain and the other gentlemen, [38] for the curé, the artisans and workmen, filled up and completed the quadrangle. Below the houses, gardens were laid out for the several gentlemen, and at the southern extremity of the island cannon were mounted for protection against a sudden assault.  In the ample forests of Maine or New Brunswick, rich in oak and maple and pine, abounding in deer, partridge, and other wild game, watered by crystal fountains springing from every acre of the soil, we naturally picture for our colonists a winter of robust health, physical comfort, and social enjoyment. The little island which they had chosen was indeed a charming spot in a summer's day, but we can hardly comprehend in what view it could have been regarded as suitable for a colonial plantation. In space it was wholly inadequate; it was destitute of wood and fresh water, and its soil was sandy and unproductive. In fixing the location of their settlement and in the construction of their houses, it is obvious that they had entirely misapprehended the character of the climate. While the latitude was nearly the same, the temperature was far more rigorous than that of the sunny France which they had left. The snow began to fall on the 6th of October. On the 3d of December the ice was seen floating on the surface of the water. As the season advanced, and the tide came and went, huge floes of ice, day after day, swept by the island, rendering it impracticable to navigate the river or pass over to the mainland. They were therefore imprisoned in their own home. Thus cut off from the game with which the neighboring forests abounded, they were compelled to subsist almost exclusively upon salted meats. Nearly all the forest trees on the island had been used in the construction of their houses, and they had consequently but a meagre supply of fuel to resist the chilling winds and penetrating frosts. For fresh water, their only reliance was upon melted snow and ice. Their store-house had not been furnished with a cellar, and the frost left nothing untouched; even cider was dispensed in solid blocks. To crown the gloom and wretchedness of their situation, the colony was visited with disease of a virulent and fatal character. As the malady was beyond the knowledge, so it baffled the skill of the surgeons. They called it _mal de la terre_. Of the seventy-nine persons, composing the whole number of the colony, thirty-five died, and twenty others were brought to the verge of the grave. In May, having been liberated from the baleful influence of their winter prison and revived by the genial warmth of the vernal sun and by the fresh meats obtained from the savages, the disease abated, and the survivors gradually regained their strength.  Disheartened by the bitter experiences of the winter, the governor, having fully determined to abandon his present establishment, ordered two boats to be constructed, one of fifteen and the other of seven tons, in which to transport"]]]
