What tasteful curtains! and the drawers--as good as mahogany. You must have spent heaps of money here.\"  \"Oh, pray don't remind me of it! I had four hundred and twenty-six francs when I left prison, and almost all is gone.\"  \"When you left prison?\"  \"Yes; it is quite a story. But you do not, I hope, think I was in prison for any crime?\"  \"Certainly not; but how was it?\"  \"After the cholera, I found myself alone in the world; I was then, I believe, about ten years of age.\"  \"Until that time, who had taken care of you?\"  \"Oh, very good people; but they died of the cholera (here the large black eyes became tearful); the little they left was sold to discharge two or three small debts, and I found that no one would shelter me. Not knowing what to do I went to the guard-house, opposite where I had resided, and said to the sentinel: 'Soldier, my parents are dead, and I do not know where to go. What must I do?' The sub-officer came and took me to the magistrate, who sent me to prison as a vagabond, which I was allowed to quit at sixteen years of age.\"  \"But your parents?\"  \"I do not know who was my father; I was six years old when I lost my mother, who had taken me from the Foundling Hospital, where she had been compelled at first to place me. The kind people of whom I have spoken lived in our house; they had no children, and seeing me an orphan, took care of me.\"  \"And how did they live? What was their condition in life?\"  \"Papa Cretu, so I always called him, was a house-painter, and the female who lived with him worked at her needle.\"  \"Then they were tolerably well off?\"  \"Oh, as well off as most people in their station. Though not married, they called each other husband and wife. They had their ups and downs; to-day in abundance, if there was plenty of work; to-morrow straitened, if there was not any; but that did not prevent them from being contented and gay (at this remembrance Miss Dimpleton's face brightened). There was nowhere near a house like it--always cheerful, always singing; and with all that, good and kind beyond belief! What was theirs, was for others also. Mamma Cretu was a plump body of thirty, clean as a new penny, lively as an eel, merry as a finch. Her husband was a regular jolly old King Cole; he had a large nose, a large mouth, always a paper cap on his head, and a face so droll--oh, so droll, that you could not look at him without laughing! When he returned home after work he did nothing but sing, make faces, and gambol like a child. He made me dance, and jump upon his knees; he played with me as if he were my own age, and his wife entirely spoilt me. Both required of me but one thing--to be good-humored; and in that, thank God! I never disappointed them; so they baptized me, Dimpleton (not Simpleton, neighbor!) and the cap fitted. As to gayety, they set me the example: never did I see them sad. If they uttered reproaches at all, it was the wife said to her husband: 'Stop, Cretu, you make me laugh too much!' or he said to her 'Hold your tongue, Ramonette (I do not know why he called her Ramonette), you will make me ill, you are so funny!' And as for me, I laughed to see them laugh. That's how I was brought up, and how my character was formed; I trust I have profited by it!\"  \"To perfection, neighbor! Then they never quarreled?\"  \"Never; oh, the biggest kind of never! Sunday, Monday, sometimes Tuesday, they had, as they called it, an outing, and took me always with them. Papa Cretu was a very good workman; when employed, he could earn what he pleased, and so could his wife too. As soon as they had sufficient for the Sunday and Monday, and could live till then, well or ill, they were satisfied. After that if they were on short allowance, they were still contented. I remember that when we had only bread and water, Papa Cretu used to take out of his library--\"  \"He had a library?\"  \"So he called a little chest, where he put his collections of new songs: for he bought all the new songs, and knew them all. When there was nothing in the house but bread, he would take from his library an old cookery-book, and say to us: 'Let us see what we will have to eat today--this or that?' and he would read to us a list of many good things. Each chose their dish. Papa Cretu would then take an empty stewpan, and with the drollest manner, and the funniest jests in the world, pretend to put in all the ingredients necessary to make a good stew, and seemed to pour it into a plate, also empty, which he would place on the table, always with grimaces that made us hold our sides, then taking his book again, he would read, for example, the receipt for a good fricassee of chicken that we had chosen, and that made our mouths water; we then eat our bread (while he read) laughing like so many mad things.\"  \"And were they in debt?\"  \"Not at all! As long as they had money they feasted: when they had none they dined on _water-color_ as Papa Cretu called it.\"  \"And did they not think of the future?\"  \"Oh, yes, they thought of it; but then our present and future were like Sunday and Monday--summer we spent gayly and happily outside the City, the winter we got over at home.\"  \"Since these poor people agreed so well together, why did they not marry?\"  \"One of their friends once asked the same question, before me.\"  \"Well?\"  \"They answered: 'If we should ever have children, we will marry; but we are very well as we are. What is the good of compelling us to do that which we now do willingly? Besides, it is expensive, and we have no money to spare.' But see how I am gossiping! as I always do on the subject of those good people, who were so kind to me, for I never tire of speaking of them. Here, neighbor, be civil enough to take my shawl, which is on the bed, and fasten it under the collar of my dress with this large pin, and we will then go, for we shall be some time selecting all you wish to purchase for the Morels.\"  Rudolph hastened to obey the instructions; he took from the bed a large plaid shawl, and carefully arranged it on his neighbor's lovely shoulders.  \"Now then, lift up the collar a little, press the dress and shawl close together and stick in the pin. Above all, take care not to prick me.\"  The prince executed the given instructions with zealous nicety; then he observed, smilingly, to the grisette, \"Oh, Miss Dimpleton, I must not be your _femme de chambre_--there is danger in it!\"  \"Yes, yes,\" answer Miss Dimpleton, gayly, \"there is great danger of my having a pin run into me! But now,\" added she, after they had left the room and locked the door after them; \"here, neighbor, take the key; it is so very heavy, that I always fear it will tear my pocket. It is quite a pistol for size!\" And then she laughed merrily.  Rudolph accordingly took possession of an enormous key--such a one as is sometimes seen in those allegorical representations where the vanquished offer the keys of their cities to the conquerors. Although Rudolph believed himself sufficiently changed by years not to be recognized by Polidori, he yet pulled up the collar of his coat before passing the door of the quack Bradamanti.  \"Neighbor, don't forget to tell M. Pipelet that some goods will be brought here, which must be taken to your room,\" said Miss Dimpleton.  \"You are right, neighbor; we will step into the lodge as we pass by.\"  Pipelet, his everlasting immense hat, as usual, on his head, dressed in his green coat, was sitting gravely before a table, on which were spread pieces of leather and fragments of old shoes; he was occupied in putting a new sole to a boot, which he did with that serious and meditative air which characterized all his doings. Anastasia was absent from the lodge.  \"Well, M. Pipelet,\" said Miss Dimpleton, \"I trust things will be better now! Thanks to my neighbor, the poor Morels were rescued from trouble just as those heartless bailiffs were about to drag the unhappy man to prison.\"  \"Oh! these bailiffs are really without hearts, or manners either, mademoiselle,\" added Pipelet, in an angry voice, flourishing the boot he was repairing, in which he had thrust his left hand and arm.  \"No! I do not fear to repeat, in the face of heaven and man, that they are without manners; they took advantage of the darkness of the staircase to make rude remarks on my wife's very person. On hearing the cries of her offended modesty, in spite of myself, I yielded to the impulse of my temper. I do not disguise it, my first movement was to remain perfectly motionless.\"  \"But afterward you followed them, I hope, M. Pipelet?\" said Miss Dimpleton, who had some trouble to preserve a serious air.  \"I thought of it,\" answered Pipelet, with a deep sigh; \"but when those shameless ruffians passed before my door, my blood rose, and I could not hinder myself from putting my hand before my eyes, to hide the monsters from my sight! But that does not surprise me; I knew something unfortunate would happen to me to-day, for I dreamed--last night--of Monster Cabrion!\"  Miss Dimpleton smiled, as Pipelet's painful sighs were mingled with the taps of the hammer, which he vigorously applied to the sole of the old boot.  \"You truly acted the part of a wise man, my dear M. Pipelet, that of despising offenses, and holding it beneath you to revenge them. But let us forget these miserable bailiffs. Will you be kind enough to do me a favor?\" asked Rudolph.  \"Man is born to assist his fellow-man,\" replied Pipelet, in a sententious and melancholy tone: \"and more particularly so when his fellow-man is so good a lodger as yourself.\"  \"It will be necessary to take up to my room different things which will be brought here presently for the Morels.\"  \"Be assured I will take charge of them,\" replied Pipelet, \"and faithfully carry out your wishes.\"  \"And afterward,\" said Rudolph, sadly, \"you must obtain a priest to watch by the little girl the Morels have lost in the night. Go and register her death, and order a decent funeral. Here is money; spare not,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6602"],["title","Mysteries of Paris â€” Volume 02 (#7)"],["body"," for Morel's benefactress, whose mere agent I am, wishes all to go well.\"  \"Make your mind quite easy, sir,\" replied Pipelet; \"directly my wife comes back, I will go to the mayor, the church, and the ham-and-beef shop--to the church for the soul of the dead, to the cook-shop for the body of the living,\" added Pipelet, philosophically and poetically. \"You may consider it done--already done, in both cases, my good sir.\"  At the entrance, Rudolph and Miss Dimpleton found themselves face to face with Anastasia, who had returned from market, bearing a heavy basket of provisions.  \"Well done!\" exclaimed the portress, looking at them both with a knowing and significant air; \"already arm-in-arm! That's your sort! Young people will be young people--and where's the harm? To a pretty lass, a handsome lad! If you don't enjoy yourselves while young, you will find it difficult to do so when you get old! My poor dear Alfred and I, for instance, when we were young, didn't we go the pace--But now, oh, dear! oh, dear!--Well, never mind; go along, my dears, and make yourselves happy while you can. Love forever!\" The old woman disappeared in the darkness of the alley, calling out, \"Alfred, do not grumble, old darling. Here is 'Stasie who brings you good things--rare dainties!\"  The young couple had left the house.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *  To the mind of Rudolph, for Miss Dimpleton was too little prone to mournful impressions to long reflect on the matter, the troubles of the Morels had ceased; but in the grim reality, a calamity, ten fold severer than their direst poverty, was gathering and forming nearer them, ready to burst upon their heads almost before the gay young couple would return from their stroll. What this great evil was, and what fate befalls other characters yet to be introduced, will presently be revealed, in shadow and by sunshine.  The Slasher, the Schoolmaster, the Screech-Owl, Hoppy, and the other wretches whose misdeeds blacken these pages, form the foil; while Fleur-de-Marie, Clemence d'Harville, Miss Dimpleton, and Mrs. George are the gems which will be seen to shed their luster and charm over the no less interesting pages of the Second Division of this work, entitled, \"_Part Second:_ NOON.\"     PART II.  NOON.   CHAPTER I.  THE ARREST.   To the snow of the past night had succeeded a very sharp wind; so that the pavement of the streets, usually muddy, was almost dry, as Rudolph and Miss Dimpleton directed their steps toward the extensive and singular bazaar called the Temple. The girl leaned without ceremony upon the arm of her cavalier, with as little restraint as though they had been intimate for a long time.  \"Isn't Mrs. Pipelet funny,\" said the grisette to Rudolph, \"with the odd remarks she makes?\"  \"Indeed, neighbor, I think she is quite right.\"  \"In what?\"  \"Why when she said: 'Young people will be young people--and where's the harm?--Love forever!'\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well! I mean to say that I perfectly agree with her.\"  \"Agree with her!\"  \"Yes, I should like nothing better than to pass my youth with you, taking '_Love forever_!' for my motto.\"  \"I believe it: you are not difficult to please.\"  \"Where is the harm? We are neighbors.\"  \"If we were not neighbors, I should not walk out with you in this way.\"  \"Then allow me to hope--\"  \"Hope what?\" \"That you will learn to love me.\"  \"I love you already.\"  \"Really?\"  \"To be sure I do and for a very simple reason. You are good and lively; although poor yourself, you do all you can for those unfortunate Morels, in interesting rich people in their behalf; you have a face that pleases me much, and a well-turned figure, which is agreeable and flattering to me, as I shall frequently accept your arm. Here are, I think, many reasons that I should love you.\"  Then interrupting herself to enjoy a hearty laugh, Miss Dimpleton cried: \"Look! look at that fat woman, with her old furrowed shoes; one could imagine her drawn along by two cats without tails!\" And again she laughed merrily.  \"I prefer looking at you, neighbor; I am so happy in thinking you already love me.\"  \"I tell you so, because it is so; if you did not please me, I should say so all the same. I cannot reproach myself with having ever deceived or flattered any one; when people please me, I tell them so at once.\"  Then, interrupting herself again, to stop before a shop-window, the grisette exclaimed:  \"Oh, look at that beautiful clock, and those two pretty vases! I have already saved up three francs and a half toward buying some like them. In five or six years I may be able to manage it.\"  \"Saved up, neighbor? Then you earn--\"  \"At least thirty sous a day--sometimes forty, but I only reckon upon thirty; it is more prudent, and I regulate my expenses accordingly,\" said Miss Dimpleton, with an air as important as though it related to the transactions of a financier.  \"But with thirty sous a day, how can you manage to live?\"  \"The reckoning is not difficult; shall I explain it to you, neighbor? You appear rather extravagant, so it may serve you as an example.\"  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"Thirty sous a day will make forty-five francs a month, will it not?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, then, by that account I have twelve francs for lodging, and twenty-three francs for living.\"  \"Twenty-three francs for a month's living!\"  \"Yes, quite as much. I acknowledge that, for a person like myself, it is enormous; but then, you see, I refuse myself nothing.\"  \"Oh, you little glutton!\"  \"Ah, but I also include food for my birds.\"  \"Certainly, if you reckon for three, it is less extravagant. But let me hear the detail of your every-day management, that I may benefit by the instruction.\"  \"Listen then. A pound of bread, that is four sous; milk, two sous-- that makes six; four sous for vegetables in winter, or fruit and salad in summer (I dote on salad and vegetables, because they do not soil the hands)--there is already ten sous; three sous for butter or oil and vinegar, as seasoning--thirteen sous; two pailfuls of water (oh, that is my luxury!) that will make fifteen sous; add to that two sous for chickweed and hempseed for my two birds, which usually share with me my bread and milk--that is twenty-two or twenty-three francs a month, neither more nor less.\"  \"And do you never eat meat?\"  \"Oh, Lord! Meat indeed! that costs ten to twelve sous a pound; how can I think of that? Besides, it smells of the kitchen, of the stewpan; instead of which, milk, fruit, and vegetables require no cooking. I will tell you a dish I am very fond of, not troublesome, and which I make to perfection.\"  \"Hold up the dish!\"  \"I put fine potatoes in the oven of my stove; when they are done, I mash them with a little butter and milk, and a pinch of salt. It is a meal for the gods! If you are well behaved I will let you taste them some day.\"  \"Prepared by your pretty hands, it cannot fail to be excellent. But let us see neighbor; we have already reckoned twenty-three francs for living, and twelve francs for lodging--that makes thirty-five francs a month.\"  \"Well, then, out of the forty-five or fifty francs I earn, there remain to me ten or fifteen francs for wood and oil during winter, as well as for my dress and washing--that is to say for soap--as, excepting my sheets, I wash for myself: that is another luxury--a laundress would pretty well ruin me; and as I also iron very well, I thereby save my money. During the five winter months I burn a load and a half of wood, and four or five sous-worth of oil in the day for my lamp; that makes nearly eighteen francs a year for my light and fire.\"  \"So that there remain to you more than a hundred francs for your clothing?\"  \"Yes; and it is from that I have saved the three francs and a half.\"  \"But your dresses--your shoes and stockings--this pretty cap?\"  \"My caps I only wear when I go out, and that does not ruin me, for I make them myself; at home I am satisfied with my hair. As to my dresses and boots--is there not the Temple?\"--\"Oh, yes, that contentment, excellent Temple! Well, you buy there--\"  \"Very good and pretty dresses. You must know that rich ladies are accustomed to give their old dresses to their waiting maids--when I say old, I mean that maybe they have worn them in their carriages a month or two--and their servants go and sell them to people who keep shops at the Temple for almost nothing. Thus, you see, I have a nice merino dress that I bought for fifteen francs, which perhaps cost sixty; it has hardly been put on and is beautifully fine. I altered it to fit me, and I flatter myself it does me credit.\"  \"Indeed you do it much credit! Thanks to the resources of the Temple, I begin to think you can manage to dress respectably with a hundred francs a year.\"  \"To be sure I can. Why, I can buy charming dresses for five or six francs; and boots, the same that I have on now, and almost new, for two or three francs. Look! would not any one say that they were made for me?\" said Miss Dimpleton, stooping and showing the tip of her pretty little foot, very nicely set off by the well-made and well-fitting boot.  \"The foot is charming, truly; but you must find a difficulty in fitting it. After that you will doubtless tell me that they sell children's shoes at the Temple.\"  \"You are a sad flatterer, neighbor; however, after what I have told you, you will acknowledge that a girl, quite alone and well, can live respectably on thirty sous a day? I must tell you, by-the-by, the four hundred and fifty francs which I brought from prison assisted materially in establishing me. When once known that I possessed furniture, it inspired confidence and I had work intrusted to me to take home; but it was necessary to wait a long time before I could meet with employment. Fortunately I kept sufficient money to live upon for three months, without earning anything.\"  \"Spite of your gay, heedless manner, allow me to say that you possess a great deal of good sense, neighbor.\"  \"Nay, when one is alone in the world, and"]]]
