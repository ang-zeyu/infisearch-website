The existing deficiencies were the more difficult to supply, because, as Van Beneden remarks with regard to the Decapoda, from the often incredible difference in the development of the most nearly allied forms, these must be separately studied—usually family by family, and frequently genus by genus—nay, sometimes, as in the case of _Penëus_, even species by species; and because these investigations, in themselves troublesome and tedious, often depend for their success upon a lucky chance.  But although the satisfactory completion of the “Genealogical tree of the Crustacea” appeared to be an undertaking for which the strength and life of an individual would hardly suffice, even under more favourable circumstances than could be presented by a distant island, far removed from the great market of scientific life, far from libraries and museums—nevertheless its practicability became daily less doubtful in my eyes, and fresh observations daily made me more favourably inclined towards the Darwinian theory.  In determining to state the arguments which I derived from the consideration of our Crustacea in favour of Darwin’s views, and which (together with more general considerations and observations in other departments), essentially aided in making the correctness of those views seem more and more palpable to me, I am chiefly influenced by an expression of Darwin’s: “Whoever,” says he (‘Origin of Species’ page 482), “is led to believe that species are mutable, will do a good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction.” To the desire expressed in these words I respond, for my own part, with the more pleasure, as this furnishes me with an opportunity of publicly giving expression in words to the thanks which I feel most deeply to be due from me to Darwin for the instructions and suggestions for which I am so deeply indebted to his book. Accordingly I throw this sand-grain with confidence into the scale against “the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed,” without troubling myself as to whether the priests of orthodox science will reckon me amongst dreamers and children in knowledge of the laws of nature.     CHAPTER II. THE SPECIES OF MELITA.   A false supposition, when the consequences proceeding from it are followed further and further, will sooner or later lead to absurdities and palpable contradictions. During the period of tormenting doubt—and this was by no means a short one—when the pointer of the scales oscillated before me in perfect uncertainty between the _pro_ and the _con_, and when any fact leading to a quick decision would have been most welcome to me, I took no small pains to detect some such contradictions among the inferences as to the class of Crustacea furnished by the Darwinian theory. But I found none, either then, or subsequently. Those which I thought I had found were dispelled on closer consideration, or actually became converted into supports for Darwin’s theory.  Nor, so far as I am aware, have any of the _necessary_ consequences of Darwin’s hypotheses been proved by any one else, to stand in clear and irreconcilable contradiction. And yet, as the most profound students of the animal kingdom are amongst Darwin’s opponents, it would seem that it ought to have been an easy matter for them to crush him long since beneath a mass of absurd and contradictory inferences, if any such were to be drawn from his theory. To this want of demonstrated contradictions I think we may ascribe just the same importance in Darwin’s favour, that his opponents have attributed to the absence of demonstrated intermediate forms between the species of the various strata of the earth. Independently of the reasons which Darwin gives for the preservation of such intermediate forms being only exceptional, this last mentioned circumstance will not be regarded as of very great significance by any one who has traced the development of an animal upon larvae fished from the sea, and had to seek in vain for months, and even years, for those transitional forms, which he nevertheless knew to be swarming around him in thousands.  A few examples may show how contradictions might come forth as necessary results of the Darwinian hypotheses.  It seems to be a necessity for all crabs which remain for a long time out of the water (but why is of no consequence to us here), that air shall penetrate from behind into the branchial cavity. Now these crabs, which have become more or less estranged from the water, belong to the most different families—the Raninidæ (_Ranina_), Eriphinæ (_Eriphia gonagra_), Grapsoidæ (_Aratus, Sesarma,_ etc.), Ocypodidæ (_Gelasimus, Ocypoda_), etc., and the separation of these families must doubtless be referred to a much earlier period than the habit of leaving the water displayed by some of their members. The arrangements connected with aerial respiration, therefore, could not be inherited from a common ancestor, and could scarcely be accordant in their construction. If there were any such accordance not referable to accidental resemblance among them, it would have to be laid in the scale as evidence against the correctness of Darwin’s views. I shall show hereafter how in this case the result, far from presenting such contradictions, was rather in the most complete harmony with what might be predicted from Darwin’s theory.  Fig. 1. Melita exilii n. sp., male, enlarged. The large branchial lamellæ are seen projecting between the legs. Fig. 1. _Melita exilii_ n. sp., male, enlarged. The large branchial lamellæ are seen projecting between the legs.  A second example.—We are already acquainted with four species of _Melita_ (_M. valida, setipes, anisochir,_ and _Fresnelii_), and I can add a fifth (Fig. 1), in which the second pair of feet bears upon one side a small hand of the usual structure, and on the other an enormous clasp-forceps. This want of symmetry is something so unusual among the Amphipoda, and the structure of the clasp-forceps differs so much from what is seen elsewhere in this order, and agrees so closely in the five species, that one must unhesitatingly regard them as having sprung from common ancestors belonging to them alone among known species. But one of these species, _M. Fresnelii,_ discovered by Savigny, in Egypt, is said to want the secondary flagellum of the anterior antennae, which occurs in the others. From the trustworthiness of all Savigny’s works there can scarcely be a doubt as to the correctness of this statement. Now, if the presence or absence of the secondary flagellum possessed the significance of a distinctive generic character, which is usually ascribed to it, or if there were other important differences between _Melita Fresnelii_ and the other species above-mentioned, which would make it seem natural to separate _M. Fresnelii_ as a distinct genus, and to leave the others united with the rest of the species of _ Melita_—that is to say, in the sense of the Darwinian theory, if we assume that all the other _Melitæ_ possessed common ancestors, which were not at the same time the ancestors of _M. Fresnelii_—this would stand in contradiction to the conclusion, derived from the structure of the clasp-forceps, that _M. Fresnelii_ and the four other species above-mentioned possessed common ancestors, which were not also the ancestors of the remaining species of _Melita._ It would follow—  From the structure of the clasp-forceps: From the presence or absence of the secondary flagellum. _M. palmata, etc., M. exilii, etc., M. Fresnelli._ _M. palmata, etc., M. exilii, etc., M. Fresnelii._  As, in the first case, among the Crabs, a typical agreement of arrangements produced independently of each other would have been a very suspicious circumstance for Darwin’s theory, so also, in the second, would any difference more profound than that of very nearly allied species. Now it seems to me that the secondary flagellum can by no means furnish a reason for doubting the close relationship of _M. Fresnelii_ to _M. exilii,_ etc., which is indicated by the peculiar structure of the unpaired clasp-forceps. In the first place we must consider the possibility that the secondary flagellum, which is not always easy to detect, may only have been overlooked by Savigny, as indeed Spence Bate supposes to have been the case. If it is really deficient it must be remarked that I have found it in species of the genera _ Leucothoë, Cyrtophium_ and _Amphilochus,_ in which genera it was missed by Savigny, Dana and Spence Bate—that a species proved by the form of the Epimera (_coxæ_ Sp. B.) of the caudal feet (_uropoda_ Westw.), etc., to be a true _Amphithoë_[1] possesses it—that in many species of _Cerapus_ it is reduced to a scarcely perceptible rudiment—nay, that it is sometimes present in youth and disappears (although perhaps not without leaving some trace) at maturity, as was found by Spence Bate to be the case in _ Acanthonotus Owenii_ and _Atylus carinatus,_ and I can affirm with regard to an _Atylus_ of these seas, remarkable for its plumose branchiæ—and that from all this, at the present day when the increasing number of known Amphipoda and the splitting of them into numerous genera thereby induced, compels us to descend to very minute distinctive characters, we must nevertheless hesitate before employing the secondary flagellum as a generic character. The case of _Melita Fresnelii_ therefore cannot excite any doubts as to Darwin’s theory.   [1] I accept this and all the other genera of Amphipoda here  mentioned, with the limits given to them by Spence Bate (‘Catalogue of  Amphipodous Crustacea’).     CHAPTER III. MORPHOLOGY OF CRUSTACEA—NAUPLIUS-LARVÆ.   If the absence of contradictions among the inferences deduced from them for a narrow and consequently easily surveyed department must prepossess us in favour of Darwin’s views, it must be welcomed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6475"],["title","Facts and Arguments for Darwin (#2)"],["body"," a positive triumph of his theory if far-reaching conclusions founded upon it should _subsequently_ be confirmed by facts, the existence of which science, in its previous state, by no means allowed us to suspect. From many results of this kind upon which I could report, I select as examples, two, which were of particular importance to me, and relate to discoveries the great significance of which in the morphology and classification of the Crustacea will not be denied even by the opponents of Darwin.  Considerations upon the developmental history of the Crustacea had led me to the conclusion that, if the higher and lower Crustacea were at all derivable from common progenitors, the former also must once have passed through Nauplius-like conditions. Soon afterwards I discovered Naupliiform larvæ of Shrimps (‘Archiv für Naturgeschichte’ 1860, i, p. 8), and I must admit that this discovery gave me the first decided turn in Darwin’s favour.  The similar number of segments[1] occurring in the Crabs and Macrura, Amphipoda and Isopoda, in which the last seven segments are always different from the preceding ones in the appendages with which they are furnished, could only be regarded as an inheritance from the same ancestors. And if at the present day the majority of the Crabs and Macrura, and indeed the Stalk-eyed Crustacea in general, pass through Zoëa-like developmental states, and the same mode of transformation was to be ascribed to their ancestors, the same thing must also apply, if not to the immediate ancestors of the Amphipoda and Isopoda, at least to the common progenitors of these and the Stalk-eyed Crustacea. Any such assumption as this was, however, very hazardous, so long as not a single fact properly relating to the Edriophthalma could be adduced in its support, as the structure of this very coherent group seemed to be almost irreconcilable with many peculiarities of the _Zoëa._ Thus, in my eyes, this point long constituted one of the chief difficulties in the application of the Darwinian views to the Crustacea, and I could scarcely venture to hope that I might yet find traces of this passage through the Zoëa-form among the Amphipoda or Isopoda, and thus obtain a positive proof of the correctness of this conclusion. At this point Van Beneden’s statement that a cheliferous Isopod (_Tanais Dulongii_), belonging, according to Milne-Edwards, to the same family as the common _Asellus aquaticus,_ possesses a carapace like the Decapoda, directed my attention to these animals, and a careful examination proved that these Isopods have preserved, more truly than any other adult Crustacea, many of the most essential peculiarities of the _Zoëae,_ especially their mode of respiration. Whilst in all other Oniscoida the abdominal feet serve for respiration, these in our cheliferous Isopod (Fig. 2) are solely motory organs, into which no blood-corpuscle ever enters, and the chief seat of respiration is, as in the _Zoëae,_ in the lateral parts of the carapace, which are abundantly traversed by currents of blood, and beneath which a constant stream of water passes, maintained, as in _Zoëae_ and the adult Decapoda, by an appendage of the second pair of maxillæ, which is wanting in all other Edriophthalma.  Tanais dubius Fig. 2. _Tanais dubius_ (?) Kr. hermaphrodite, magnified, showing the orifice of entrance (_x_) into the cavity overarched by the carapace, in which an appendage of the second pair of maxillæ (_f_) plays. On four feet (_i, k, l, m_) are the rudiments of the lamellæ which subsequently form the brood-cavity.   For both these discoveries, it may be remarked in passing, science is indebted less to a happy chance than immediately to Darwin’s theory.  Species of _Penëus_ live in the European seas, as well as here, and their _Nauplius_-brood has no doubt repeatedly passed unnoticed through the hands of the numerous naturalists who have investigated those seas, as well as through my own,[2] for it has nothing which could attract particular attention amongst the multifarious and often wonderful _Nauplius_-forms. When I, fancying from the similarity of its movements that it was a young _Penëus-Zoëa,_ had for the first time captured such a larva, and on bringing it under the microscope found a _Nauplius_ differing _toto cœlo_ from this _Zoëa,_ I might have thrown it aside as being completely foreign to the developmental series which I was tracing, if the idea of early Naupliiform stages of the higher Crustacea, which indeed I did not believe to be still extant, had not at the moment vividly occupied my attention.  And if I had not long been seeking among the Edriophthalma for traces of the supposititious _Zoëa_-state, and seized with avidity upon everything that promised to made this refractory Order serviceable to me, Van Beneden’s short statement could hardly have affected me so much in the manner of an electric shock, and impelled me to a renewed study of the _Tanaides,_ especially as I had once before plagued myself with them in the Baltic, without getting any further than my predecessors, and I have not much taste for going twice over the same ground.   [1] Like Claus I do not regard the eyes of the Crustacea as limbs, and  therefore admit no ocular segment; on the other hand I count in the  median piece of the tail, to which the character of a segment is often  denied. In opposition to its interpretation as a segment of the body,  only the want of limbs can be cited; in its favour we have the  relation of the intestine, which usually opens in this piece, and  sometimes even traverses its whole length, as in _Microdeutopus_ and  some other Amphipoda. In _Microdeutopus,_ as Spence Bate has already  pointed out, one is even led to regard small processes of this tubular  caudal piece as rudimentary members. Bell also (‘British Stalk-eyed  Crustacea’ p. xx), states that he observed limbs of the last segment  in _Palæmon serratus_ in the form of small moveable points.     The attempt has often been made to divide the body of the higher     Crustacea into small sections composed of equal numbers of     segments, these sections consisting of 3, 5 or 7 segments. None of     these attempts has ever met with general acceptance; my own     investigations lead me to a conception which nearly approaches Van     Beneden’s. I assume four sections of 5 segments each—the primitive     body, the fore-body, the hind-body, and the middle-body. The     primitive body includes the segments which the naupliiform larva     brings with it out of the egg; it is afterwards divided, by the     younger sections which become developed in its middle, into the     head and tail. To this primitive body belong the two pairs of     antennæ, the mandibles and the caudal feet (“posterior pair of     pleopoda,” Sp. B.). Even in the mature animal the fact that these     terminal sections belong to one another is sometimes betrayed by     the resemblance of their appendages, especially that of the outer     branch of the caudal feet, with the outer branch (the so-called     scale) of the second pair of antennæ. Like the antennæ, the caudal     feet may also become the bearers of high sensorial apparatus, as is     shown by the ear of _Mysis._     The sequence of the sections of the body in order of time seems     originally to have been, that first the fore-body, then the     hind-body, and finally the middle-body was formed. The fore-body     appears, in the adult animal, to be entirely or partially     amalgamated with the head; its appendages (_siagonopoda_ Westw.)     are all or in part serviceable for the reception of food, and     generally sharply distinguished from those of the following group.     The segments of the middle-body seem always to put forth limbs     immediately after their own appearance, whilst the segments of the     hind-body often remain destitute of feet through long portions of     the larval life or even throughout life (as in many female     Diastylidæ), a reason, among many others, for not, as is usual,     regarding the middle-body of the Crustacea as equivalent to the     constantly footless abdomen of Insects. The appendages of the     middle-body (_pereiopoda_) seem never, even in their youngest form,     to possess two equal branches, a peculiarity which usually     characterises the appendages of the hind-body. This is a     circumstance which renders very doubtful the equivalence of the     middle-body of the Malacostraca with the section of the body which     in the Copepoda bears the swimming feet and in the Cirripedia the     cirri.     The comprehension of the feet of the hind-body and tail in a single     group (as “fausses pattes abdominales,” or as “pleopoda”) seems not     to be justifiable. When there is a metamorphosis, they are probably     always produced at different periods, and they are almost always     quite different in structure and function. Even in the Amphipoda,     in which the caudal feet usually resemble in appearance the last     two pairs of abdominal feet, they are in general distinguished by     some sort of peculiarity, and whilst the abdominal feet are     reproduced in wearisome uniformity throughout the entire order, the     caudal feet are, as is well-known, amongst the most variable parts     of the Amphipoda.    [2] Mecznikow has recently found Naupliiform shrimp-larvæ in the sea  near Naples.     CHAPTER IV. SEXUAL PECULIARITIES AND DIMORPHISM.   Our  _Tanais,_ which in nearly all the particulars of its structure is an extremely remarkable animal, furnished me with a second fact worthy of notice in connection with the theory of the origin of species by natural selection.  When hand-like or cheliform structures occur in the Crustacea, these are usually more strongly developed in the males than in the females, often becoming enlarged in the former to quite a disproportionate size, as we have already seen to be the case in _Melita._ A better known example of such gigantic chelæ is "]]]
