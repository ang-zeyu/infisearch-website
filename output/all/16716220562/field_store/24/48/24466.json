They were the     remains of Spanish vessels, which had sailed to settle Cape Breton.     From these same ships had come some sheep and cattle, which had     multiplied on Sable Island; and this was for some time a resource for     these poor exiles. Fish was their next food; and, when their clothes     were worn out, they made new ones of seal-skin. At last, after a lapse     of seven years, the king, having heard of their adventure, obliged     Chedotel, the pilot, to go for them; but he found only twelve, the rest     having died of their hardships. His majesty desired to see those, who     returned in the same guise as found by Chedotel, covered with     seal-skin, with their hair and beard of a length and disorder that made     them resemble the pretended river-gods, and so disfigured as to inspire     horror. The king gave them fifty crowns apiece, and sent them home     released from all process of law.\"--_Shea's Charlevoix_, New York,     1866, Vol. I. p. 244. See also _Sir William Alexander and American     Colonization_, Prince Society, 1873, p. 174; _Murdoch's Nova Scotia_,     Vol. I. p. 11; _Hakluyt_, Vol. II. pp. 679. 697.  22. This cape still bears the same name, and is the western point of the     bay at the mouth of a river, likewise of the same name, in the county     of Lunenberg, Nova Scotia. It is an abrupt cliff, rising up one hundred     and fifty feet above the level of the sea. It could therefore be seen     at a great distance, and appears to have been the first land sighted by     them on the coast of La Cadie. A little north of Havre de Grâce, in     Normandy, the port from which De Monts and Champlain had sailed, is to     be seen the high, commanding, rocky bluff, known as _Cap de la Hève_.     The place which they first sighted, similar at least in some respects,     they evidently named after this bold and striking headland, which may,     perhaps, have been the last object which they saw on leaving the shores     of France. The word _Hève_ seems to have had a local meaning, as may be     inferred from the following excerpt: \"A name, in Lower Normandy, for     cliffs hollowed out below, and where fishermen search for crabs.\"--     _Littré_. The harbor delineated on Champlain's local map is now called     Palmerston Bay, and is at the mouth of Petit River. The latitude of     this harbor is about 44° 15'. De Laet's description is fuller than that     of Champlain or Lescarbot.--_Vide Novus Orbis_, 1633, p. 51.  23. Liverpool, which for a long time bore the name of Port Rossignol; the     lake at the head of the river, about ten miles long and two or three     wide, the largest in Nova Scotia, still bears that appellation. The     latitude is 44° 2' 30\".  24. \"Lequel ils appelèrent _Le Port du Mouton_, à l'occasion d'un mouton     qui s'estant nové revint à bord, et fut mangé de bonne guerre.\"--     _Histoire de la Nouvelle-France_, par Marc Lescarbot, Paris, 1612,     Qvat. Liv. p. 449. It still bears the name of Port Mouton, and an     island in the bay is called Mouton Island.  25. _Baye de Toutes-isles_. Lescarbot calls it \"La Baye des Iles:\" and     Charlevoix, \"Baye de toutes les Isles.\" It was the bay, or rather the     waters, that stretch along the shores of Halifax County, between Owl's     Head and Liscomb River.  26. The confiscated provisions taken in the vessels of the Basque     fur-traders and in that of Rossignol were, according to Lescarbot,     found very useful. De Monts had given timely notice of his monopoly;     and, whether it had reached them or not, they were doubtless wrong in     law. Although De Monts treated them with gentleness, nevertheless it is     not unlikely that a compromise would have been better policy than an     entire confiscation of their property, as these Basques afterwards, on     their return to France, gave him serious inconvenience. They were     instrumental mainly in wresting from him his charter of La Cadie.  27. _Le Port du Cap Negré_. This port still bears the name of Negro     Harbor. It is situated at the mouth of the Clyde, the small river     referred to in the text.  28. Near Cape Sable Island, at what is now known as Barrington Harbor.  29. This is still called Cape Sable, and is the southern point of Sable     Island, or, more properly, the cluster of rock, and islets that     surround its southern extremity.  30. _Isle aux Cormorans_. It is difficult to distinguish with certainty the     island here referred to, but it was probably Hope Island, as this lies     directly in their way in crossing the bay, six leagues wide, which is     now known as Townsend Bay. The bird here mentioned was the common     cormorant. _Graculus carbo_, of a glossy greenish-black color, back and     wings bronzy-gray; about three feet in length, and is common on our     northern Atlantic coast: eminently gregarious, particularly in the     breeding season, congregating in vast flocks. At the present time, it     breeds in great numbers in Labrador and Newfoundland, and in the winter     migrates as far south as the Middle States. They feed principally upon     fish, lay commonly two eggs, of a pale greenish color, overlaid with a     white chalky substance.--_Vide Cones's Key to Nor. Am. Birds_. Boston,     1872. p. 302.  31. A cluster of islands now known as the Tousquet or Tusket Islands.     Further on, Champlain says they named them _Isles aux loups marins_.     Sea-Wolf Islands. About five leagues south of them is an island now     called Seal Island. The four more which he saw a little further on were     probably in Townsend Bay.  32. This is the Auk, family _Alcidae_, and must not be confounded with the     penguin of the southern hemisphere, although it is described by the     early navigators of the Northern Atlantic under that appellation. In     Anthony Parkhurst's letter to Hakluyt, 1578, he says: \"These birds are     also called Penguins, and cannot flie, there is more meate in one of     these then in a goose: the Frenchmen that fish neere the grand baie, do     bring small store of flesh with them, but victuall themselves alwayes     with these birds.\"--_Hakluyt_, London, ed. 1810, Vol. III. p. 172.     Edward Haies, in his report of the voyage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert in     1583, say's: \"We had sight of an Island named Penguin, of a foule there     breeding in abundance, almost incredible, which cannot flie, their     wings not able to carry their body, being very large (not much lesse     then a goose), and exceeding fat: which the Frenchmen use to take     without difficulty upon that Island, and to barrell them up with salt.\"     _Idem_, p. 191.      The Auk is confined to the northern hemisphere, where it represents the     penguins of the southern. Several species occur in the Northern     Atlantic in almost incredible numbers: they are all marine, feed on     fish and other animal substances exclusively, and lay from one to three     eggs on the bare rocks. Those seen by Champlain and other early     navigators were the Great Auk. _Alca impennis_, now nearly extinct. It     was formerly found on the coast of New England, as is proved not only     by the testimony of the primitive explorers, but by the remains found     in shell-heaps. The latest discovery was of one found dead near     St. Augustine, in Labrador, in 1870. A specimen of the Great Auk is     preserved in the Cambridge Museum.--_Vide Coues's Key to North Am.     Birds_, Boston, 1872. p. 338.  33. The sea-wolf or _loup marin_ of Champlain is the marine mammiferous     quadruped of the family Phocidae, known as the seal. Sea-wolf was a     name applied to it by the early navigators.--_Vide Purchas's Pilgrims_,     London, 1625. Vol. IV. p. 1385. Those here mentioned were the common     seal, _Phoca vitulina_, which are still found on the coasts of Nova     Scotia, vulgarly known as the harbor seal. They are thinly distributed     as far south as Long Island Sound, but are found in great numbers in     the waters of Labrador and Newfoundland, where they are taken for the     oil obtained from them, and for the skins, which are used for various     purposes in the arts.  34. The names given to these birds were such, doubtless, as were known to     belong to birds similar in color, size, and figure in Europe. Some of     them were probably misapplied. The name alone is not sufficient for     identification.  35. This cape, near the entrance to Yarmouth, still bears the same name,     from _fourchu_, forked. On a map of 1755, it is called Forked Cape, and     near it is Fork Ledge and Forked Harbor.--_Memorials of English and     French Commissaries_, London, 1755.  36. It still retains the name given to it by Champlain. It forms a part of     the western limit of St. Mary's Bay, and a line drawn from it to the     St. Croix, cutting the Grand Manan, would mark the entrance of the Bay     of Fundy.  37. The Bay of Fundy was thus first named \"Baye Françoise\" by De Monts, and     continued to be so called, as will appear by reference to the early     maps, as that of De Laet, 1633; Charlevoix, 1744; Rouge, 1778. It first     appears distinctly on the carte of Diego Homem of 1558, but without     name. On Cabot's Mappe-Monde, in \"Monuments de la Géographie,\" we find     _rio fondo_, which may represent the Bay of Fundy, and may have     suggested the name adopted by the English, which it still retains. Sir     William Alexander's map, 1624, has Argal's Bay; Moll's map, 1712, has     Fundi Bay; that of the English and French Commissaries, 1755, has Bay     of Fundy, or Argal.  38. This strait, known by the name Petit Passage, separates Long Island     from Digby Neck.  39. A place called Little River, on Digby Neck.  40. Now known as Sandy Cove.  41. Lescarbot says of this iron mine, and of the silver mine above, that     they were proved not to be abundant.  42. This was probably near Rossway.  43. This was clearly Smith Creek"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6749"],["title","Voyages of Samuel De Champlain — Volume 02 (#5)"],["body","Smelt River, which rises near Annapolis     Basin, or the Port Royal Basin of the French.  44. He here doubtless refers to North Creek, at the north-eastern extremity     of St. Mary's Bay.  45. Now Weymouth Harbor, on the south-eastern shore of St. Mary's Bay, at     the mouth of Sissibou River, and directly opposite Sandy Cove, near the     iron mine mentioned above.  46. The distance across the bay at this point, as here stated, is nearly     accurate.  47. This is clearly a mistake; the true latitude at the Petit Passage is     44° 23'. It may here be remarked that Champlain's latitudes are very     inaccurate, often varying more than half a degree; doubtless owing to     the imperfection of the instruments which were employed in taking them.  48. They had been occupied in this exploration about three weeks, Lescarbot     says a month, but this is an overstatement. By a careful examination of     the text, it will appear that they departed from Port Mouton on the     19th of May, and that several days after their return, not less than     nine, they were again in St. Mary's Bay, on the 16th of June. They had     been absent, therefore, about twenty-one days. The latitude of Port     Mouton, stated a little below to be 44°, is in fact 43° 57'.  49. This bay, still retaining its ancient appellation, was so named by     Champlain on his first visit. \"Ceste baye fut nommée la baye Saincte     Marie.\"--_Champlain's Voyages_, 1632, Quebec ed., Vol. V. p. 716.  50. Nicholas Aubry, a young Parisian of good family, \"vn certain homme     d'Église,\" as Lescarbot says, probably not long in holy orders, had     undertaken this voyage with De Monts to gratify his desire to see the     New World, though quite against the wishes of his friends, who had sent     in vain to Honfleur to prevent his embarkation. After the search made     by De Monts, with the sounding of trumpets and the discharge of cannon,     they left St. Mary's Bay, having given up all expectation of his     recovery. Some two weeks afterward, an expedition was Sent out to     St. Mary's Bay, conducted by De Champdoré, an experienced pilot, with a     mineralogist, to search for silver and iron ore. While Some of the     party were on a fishing excursion, they rescued him, as stated in the     text. The safe return of the young and too venturesome ecclesiastic     gave great relief to De Monts, as Lescarbot says a Protestant was     charged to have killed him, because they quarrelled sometimes about     their religion.--_Vide Histoire de Nouvelle-France_, par Mare     Lescarbot, Paris, 1612, Qvat. Liv. p. 453.  51. The partridge-berry, Mitchella, a trailing evergreen, bearing scarlet     berries, edible but nearly tasteless, which remain through the winter.     It is peculiar to America, and this is probably the first time it was     noticed by any historical writer.  52.

JOHN, AND WHAT WE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE PORT OF MINES AND THE SAME.--THE ISLAND CALLED BY THE SAVAGES MANTHANE.--THE RIVER OF THE ETECHEMINS, AND SEVERAL FINE ISLANDS THERE.-- ST. CROIX ISLAND, AND OTHER NOTEWORTHY OBJECTS ON THIS COAST.  Some days after, Sieur de Monts decided to go and examine the coasts of Baye Françoise. For this purpose, he set out from the vessel on the 16th of May,[53] and we went through the strait of Long Island.[54] Not having found in St. Mary's Bay any place in which to fortify ourselves except at the cost of much time, we accordingly resolved to see whether there might not be a more favorable one in the other bay. Heading north-east six leagues, there is a cove where vessels can anchor in four, five, six, and seven fathoms of water. The bottom is sandy. This place is only a kind of roadstead.[55] Continuing two leagues farther on in the same direction, we entered one of the finest harbors I had seen along all these coasts, in which two thousand vessels might lie in security. The entrance is eight hundred paces broad; then you enter a harbor two leagues long and one broad, which I have named Port Royal.[56] Three rivers empty into it, one of which is very large, extending eastward, and called Rivière de l'Équille,[57] from a little fish of the size of an _esplan?_, which is caught there in large numbers, as is also the herring, and several other kinds of fish found in abundance in their season. This river is nearly a quarter of a league broad at its entrance, where there is an island [58] perhaps half a league in circuit, and covered with wood like all the rest of the country, as pines, firs, spruces, birches, aspens, and some oaks, although the latter are found in small numbers in comparison with the other kinds. There are two entrances to the above river, one on the north, the other on the south side of the island. That on the north is the better, and vessels can there anchor under shelter of the island in five, six, seven, eight, and nine fathoms. But it is necessary to be on one's guard against some shallows near the island on the one side, and the main land on the other, very dangerous, if one does not know the channel.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING MAP.

It has there a breadth of sixty paces, and about a fathom and a half of water. The country bordering the river is filled with numerous oaks, ashes, and other trees. Between the mouth of the river and the point to which we ascended there are many meadows, which are flooded at the spring tides, many little streams traversing them from one side to the other, through which shallops and boats can go at full tide. This place was the most favorable and agreeable for a settlement that we had seen. There is another island [59] within the port, distant nearly two leagues from the former. At this point is another little stream, extending a considerable distance inland, which we named Rivière St. Antoine. [60] Its mouth is distant from the end of the Bay of St. Mary some four leagues through the woods. The remaining river is only a small stream filled with rocks, which cannot be ascended at all on account of the small amount of water, and which has been named Rocky Brook. [61] This place is in latitude [62] 45°; and 17° 8' of the deflection of the magnetic needle.         *       *       *       *       *  CHAMPLAIN'S DESCRIPTION OF THE MAP  PORT ROYAL  _The figures indicate fathoms of water_.  _A_.

Heading north-east, and sailing eight or ten leagues along the coast of Port Royal,[64] we crossed a part of the bay Some five or six leagues in extent, when we arrived at a place which we called the Cape of Two Bays;[65] and we passed by an island a league distant therefrom, a league also in circuit, rising up forty or forty-five fathoms. [66] It is wholly surrounded by great rocks, except in one place which is sloping, at the foot of which slope there is a pond of salt water, coming from under a pebbly point, having the form of a spur. The surface of the island is flat, covered with trees, and containing a fine spring of water. In this place is a copper mine. Thence we proceeded to a harbor a league and a half distant, where we supposed the copper mine was, which a certain Prevert of St. Malo had discovered by aid of the savages of the country. This port is in latitude 45° 40', and is dry at low tide. [67] In order to enter it, it is necessary to place beacons, and mark out a sand-bank at the entrance, which borders a channel that extends along the main land. Then you enter a bay nearly a league in length, and half a league in breadth. In some places, the bottom is oozy and sandy, where vessels may get aground. The sea falls and rises there to the extent of four or five fathoms. We landed to see whether we could find the"]]]
