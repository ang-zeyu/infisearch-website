Well, sir, you must get my father's consent to walk with me in the garden. But by no means inform him of my kindness to you.  _Isaac_. No, to be sure, that would spoil all: but, trust me when tricking is the word--let me alone for a piece of cunning; this very day you shall be out of his power.  _Duen_. Well, I leave the management of it all to you; I perceive plainly, sir, that you are not one that can be easily outwitted.  _Isaac_. Egad, you're right, madam--you're right, i'faith.   _Re-enter_ MAID.  _Maid_. Here's a gentleman at the door, who begs permission to speak with Signor Isaac.  _Isaac_. A friend of mine, ma'am, and a trusty friend--let him come in--[_Exit_ MAID.] He's one to be depended on, ma'am.   _Enter_ DON CARLOS.  So coz. [_Talks apart with_ DON CARLOS.]  _Don Car_. I have left Donna Clara at your lodgings, but can nowhere find Antonio.  _Isaac_. Well, I will search him out myself. Carlos, you rogue, I thrive, I prosper!  _Don Car_. Where is your mistress?  _Isaac_. There, you booby, there she stands.  _Don Car_. Why, she's damned ugly!  _Isaac_. Hush! [_Stops his mouth_.]  _Duen_. What is your friend saying, signor?  _Isaac_. Oh, ma'am, he is expressing his raptures at such charms as he never saw before. Eh, Carlos?  _Don Car_. Ay,--such as I never saw before, indeed!  _Duen_. You are a very obliging gentleman. Well, Signor Isaac, I believe we had better part for the present. Remember our plan.  _Isaac_. Oh, ma'am, it is written in my heart, fixed as the image of those divine beauties. Adieu, idol of my soul!--yet once more permit me----[_Kisses her_.]  _Duen_. Sweet, courteous sir, adieu!  _Isaac_. Your slave eternally! Come, Carlos, say something civil at taking leave.  _Don Car_. I'faith, Isaac, she is the hardest woman to compliment I ever saw; however, I'll try something I had studied for the occasion.  SONG.    Ah! sure a pair was never seen   So justly form'd to meet by nature!   The youth excelling so in mien,   The maid in ev'ry grace of feature.   Oh, how happy are such lovers,   When kindred beauties each discovers;   For surely she   Was made for thee,   And thou to bless this lovely creature!    So mild your looks, your children thence   Will early learn the task of duty--   The boys with all their father's sense,   The girls with all their mother's beauty!   Oh, how happy to inherit   At once such graces and such spirit!   Thus while you live   May fortune give   Each blessing equal to your merit! [_Exeunt_.]     SCENE III.--_A Library in_ DON JEROME'S _House_.  DON JEROME _and_ DON FERDINAND _discovered_.   _Don Jer_. Object to Antonio! I have said it. His poverty, can you acquit him of that?  _Don Ferd_. Sir, I own he is not over rich; but he is of as ancient and honourable a family as any in the kingdom.  _Don Jer_. Yes, I know the beggars are a very ancient family in most kingdoms; but never in great repute, boy.  _Don Ferd_. Antonio, sir, has many amiable qualities.  _Don Jer_. But he is poor; can you clear him of that, I say? Is he not a gay, dissipated rake, who has squandered his patrimony?  _Don Ferd_. Sir, he inherited but little; and that his generosity, more than his profuseness, has stripped him of; but he has never sullied his honour, which, with his title, has outlived his means.  _Don Jer_. Psha! you talk like a blockhead! nobility, without an estate, is as ridiculous as gold lace on a frieze coat.  _Don Ferd_. This language, sir, would better become a Dutch or English trader than a Spaniard.  _Don Jer_. Yes; and those Dutch and English traders, as you call them, are the wiser people. Why, booby, in England they were formerly as nice, as to birth and family, as we are: but they have long discovered what a wonderful purifier gold is; and now, no one there regards pedigree in anything but a horse. Oh, here comes Isaac! I hope he has prospered in his suit.  _Don Ferd_. Doubtless, that agreeable figure of his must have helped his suit surprisingly.  _Don Jer_. How now? [DON FERDINAND _walks aside_.]   _Enter_ ISAAC.  Well, my friend, have you softened her?  _Isaac_. Oh, yes; I have softened her.  _Don Jer_. What, does she come to?  _Isaac_. Why, truly, she was kinder than I expected to find her.  _Don Jer_. And the dear little angel was civil, eh?  _Isaac_. Yes, the pretty little angel was very civil.  _Don Jer_. I'm transported to hear it! Well, and you were astonished at her beauty, hey?  _Isaac_. I was astonished, indeed! Pray, how old is Miss?  _Don Jer_. How old? let me see--eight and twelve--she is twenty.  _Isaac_. Twenty?  _Don Jer_. Ay, to a month.  _Isaac_. Then, upon my soul, she is the oldest-looking girl of her age in Christendom!  _Don Jer_. Do you think so? But, I believe, you will not see a prettier girl.  _Isaac_. Here and there one.  _Don Jer_. Louisa has the family face.  _Isaac_. [_Aside_.] Yes, egad, I should have taken it for a family face, and one that has been in the family some time, too.  _Don Jer_. She has her father's eyes.  _Isaac_. [_Aside_.]Truly, I should have guessed them to have been so! If she had her mother's spectacles, I believe she would not see the worse.  _Don Jer_. Her aunt Ursula's nose, and her grandmother's forehead, to a hair.  _Isaac_. [_Aside_.]Ay, 'faith, and her grandfather's chin, to a hair.  _Don Jer_. Well, if she was but as dutiful as she's handsome--and hark ye, friend Isaac, she is none of your made-up beauties--her charms are of the lasting kind.  _Isaac_. I'faith, so they should--for if she be but twenty now, she may double her age before her years will overtake her face.  _Don Jer_. Why, zounds, Master Isaac! you are not sneering, are you?  _Isaac_. Why now, seriously, Don Jerome, do you think your daughter handsome?  _Don Jer_. By this light, she's as handsome a girl as any in Seville.  _Isaac_. Then, by these eyes, I think her as plain a woman as ever I beheld.  _Don Jer_. By St. Iago! you must be blind.  _Isaac_. No, no; 'tis you are partial.  _Don Jer_. How! have I neither sense nor taste? If a fair skin, fine eyes, teeth of ivory, with a lovely bloom, and a delicate shape,--if these, with a heavenly voice and a world of grace, are not charms, I know not what you call beautiful.  _Isaac_. Good lack, with what eyes a father sees! As I have life, she is the very reverse of all this: as for the dimity skin you told me of, I swear 'tis a thorough nankeen as ever I saw! for her eyes, their utmost merit is not squinting--for her teeth, where there is one of ivory, its neighbour is pure ebony, black and white alternately, just like the keys of a harpsichord. Then, as to her singing, and heavenly voice--by this hand, she has a shrill, cracked pipe, that sounds for all the world like a child's trumpet.  _Don Jer_. Why, you little Hebrew scoundrel, do you mean to insult me? Out of my house, I say!  _Don Ferd_. [_Coming forward_.] Dear sir, what's the matter?  _Don Jer_. Why, this Israelite here has the impudence to say your sister's ugly.  _Don Ferd_. He must be either blind or insolent.  _Isaac_. [_Aside_.]So, I find they are all in a story. Egad, I believe I have gone too far!  _Don Ferd_. Sure, sir, there must be some mistake; it can't be my sister whom he has seen.  _Don Jer_. 'Sdeath! you are as great a fool as he! What mistake can there be? Did not I lock up Louisa, and haven't I the key in my own pocket? and didn't her maid show him into the dressing-room? and yet you talk of a mistake! No, the Portuguese meant to insult me--and, but that this roof protects him, old as I am, this sword should do me justice.  _Isaac_. I[_Aside_.] must get off as well as I can--her fortune is not the less handsome.  DUET.  _Isaac_.   Believe me, good sir, I ne'er meant to offend;   My mistress I love, and I value my friend   To win her and wed her is still my request,   For better for worse--and I swear I don't jest.  _Don Jer_.   Zounds! you'd best not provoke me, my rage is so high!  _Isaac_.   Hold him fast, I beseech you, his rage is so high!   Good sir, you're too hot, and this place I must fly.  _Don Jer_.   You're a knave and a sot, and this place you'd best fly.  _Isaac_. Don Jerome, come now, let us lay aside all joking, and be serious.  _Don Jer_. How?  _Isaac_. Ha! ha! ha! I'll be hanged if you haven't taken my abuse of your daughter seriously.  _Don Jer_. You meant it so, did not you?  _Isaac_. O mercy, no! a joke--just to try how angry it would make you.  _Don Jer_. Was that all, i'faith? I didn't know you had been such a wag. Ha! ha! ha! By St. Iago! you made me very angry, though. Well, and you do think Louisa handsome?  _Isaac_. Handsome! Venus de Medicis was a sybil to her.  _Don Jer_. Give me your hand, you little jocose rogue! Egad, I thought we had been all off.  _Don Ferd_. [_Aside_.] So! I was in hopes this would have been a quarrel; but I find the Jew is too cunning.  _Don Jer_. Ay, this gust of passion has made me dry--I am seldom ruffled. Order some wine in the next room--let us drink the poor girl's health. Poor Louisa! ugly, eh! ha! ha! ha! 'twas a very good joke, indeed!  _Isaac_. [_Aside_.] And a very true one, for all that.  _Don Jer_, And, Ferdinand, I insist upon your drinking success to my friend.  _Don Ferd_. Sir, I will drink success to my friend with all my heart.  _Don Jer_. Come, little Solomon, if any sparks of anger had remained, this would be the only way to quench them.  TRIO.   A bumper of good liquor   Will end a contest quicker   Than justice, judge, or vicar;   So fill a cheerful glass,   And let good humour pass.   But if more deep the quarrel,   Why, sooner drain the barrel   Than be the hateful fellow   That's crabbed when he's mellow.   A bumper, &c. [_Exeunt_.]     SCENE IV.--ISAAC'S _Lodgings_.  _Enter_ DONNA LOUISA.   _Don. Louisa_. Was ever truant daughter so whimsically circumstanced as I am? I have sent my intended husband to look after my lover--the man of my father's choice is gone to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6731"],["title","The Duenna: A Comic Opera (#5)"],["body","me the man of my own: but how dispiriting is this interval of expectation!  SONG.    What bard, O Time, discover,   With wings first made thee move?   Ah! sure it was some lover   Who ne'er had left his love!   For who that once did prove   The pangs which absence brings,   Though but one day   He were away,   Could picture thee with wings?   What bard, &c.   _Enter_ DON CARLOS.  So, friend, is Antonio found?  _Don Car_. I could not meet with him, lady; but I doubt not my friend Isaac will be here with him presently.  _Don. Louisa_. Oh, shame! you have used no diligence. Is this your courtesy to a lady, who has trusted herself to your protection?  _Don Car_. Indeed, madam, I have not been remiss.  _Don. Louisa_. Well, well; but if either of you had known how each moment of delay weighs upon the heart of her who loves, and waits the object of her love, oh, ye would not then have trifled thus!  _Don Car_. Alas, I know it well!  _Don. Louisa_. Were you ever in love, then?  _Don Car_. I was, lady; but, while I have life, I will never be again.  _Don. Louisa_. Was your mistress so cruel?  _Don Car_. If she had always been so, I should have been happier.  SONG.    Oh, had my love ne'er smiled on me,   I ne'er had known such anguish;   But think how false, how cruel she,   To bid me cease to languish;   To bid me hope her hand to gain,   Breathe on a flame half perish'd;   And then with cold and fixed disdain,   To kill the hope she cherish'd.    Not worse his fate, who on a wreck,   That drove as winds did blow it,   Silent had left the shatter'd deck,   To find a grave below it.   Then land was cried--no more resign'd,   He glow'd with joy to hear it;   Not worse his fate, his woe, to find   The wreck must sink ere near it!  _Don. Louisa_. As I live, here is your friend coming with Antonio! I'll retire for a moment to surprise him. [_Exit_.]   _Enter_ ISAAC _and_ DON ANTONIO.  _Don Ant_. Indeed, my good friend, you must be mistaken. Clara d'Almanza in love with me, and employ you to bring me to meet her! It is impossible!  _Isaac_. That you shall see in an instant. Carlos, where is the lady?-- [DON CARLOS _points to the door_.] In the next room, is she?  _Don Ant_. Nay, if that lady is really here, she certainly wants me to conduct her to a dear friend of mine, who has long been her lover.  _Isaac_. Psha! I tell you 'tis no such thing--you are the man she wants, and nobody but you. Here's ado to persuade you to take a pretty girl that's dying for you!  _Don Ant_. But I have no affection for this lady.  _Isaac_. And you have for Louisa, hey? But take my word for it, Antonio, you have no chance there--so you may as well secure the good that offers itself to you.  _Don Ant_. And could you reconcile it to your conscience to supplant your friend?  _Isaac_. Pish! Conscience has no more to do with gallantry than it has with politics. Why, you are no honest fellow if love can't make a rogue of you; so come--do go in and speak to her, at least.  _Don Ant_, Well, I have no objection to that.  _Isaac_. [_Opens the door_.] There--there she is--yonder by the window--get in, do.--[_Pushes him in, and half shuts the door_.] Now, Carlos, now I shall hamper him, I warrant! Stay, I'll peep how they go on. Egad, he looks confoundedly posed! Now she's coaxing him. See, Carlos, he begins to come to--ay, ay, he'll soon forget his conscience.  _Don Car_. Look--now they are both laughing!  _Isaac_. Ay, so they are--yes, yes, they are laughing at that dear friend he talked of--ay, poor devil, they have outwitted him.  _Don Car_, Now he's kissing her hand.  _Isaac_, Yes, yes, faith, they're agreed--he's caught, he's entangled. My dear Carlos, we have brought it about. Oh, this little cunning head! I'm a Machiavel--a very Machiavel!  _Don Car_, I hear somebody inquiring for you--I'll see who it is. [_Exit_.]   _Re-enter_ DON ANTONIO _and_ DONNA LOUISA.  _Don Ant_. Well, my good friend, this lady has so entirely convinced me of the certainty of your success at Don Jerome's, that I now resign my pretensions there.  _Isaac_. You never did a wiser thing, believe me; and, as for deceiving your friend, that's nothing at all--tricking is all fair in love, isn't it, ma'am?  _Don. Louisa_. Certainly, sir; and I am particularly glad to find you are of that opinion.  _Isaac_. O Lud! yes, ma'am--let any one outwit me that can, I say! But here, let me join your hands. There you lucky rogue! I wish you happily married from the bottom of my soul!  _Don. Louisa_. And I am sure, if you wish it, no one else should prevent it.  _Isaac_. Now, Antonio, we are rivals no more; so let us be friends, will you?  _Don Ant_. With all my heart, Isaac.  _Isaac_. It is not every man, let me tell you, that would have taken such pains, or been so generous to a rival.  _Don Ant_. No, 'faith, I don't believe there's another beside yourself in all Spain.  _Isaac_. Well, but you resign all pretensions to the other lady?  _Don Ant_. That I do, most sincerely.  _Isaac_. I doubt you have a little hankering there still.  _Don Ant_. None in the least, upon my soul.  _Isaac_. I mean after her fortune.  _Don Ant_. No, believe me. You are heartily welcome to every thing she has.  _Isaac_. Well, i'faith, you have the best of the bargain, as to beauty, twenty to one. Now I'll tell you a secret--I am to carry off Louisa this very evening.  _Don. Louisa_. Indeed!  _Isaac_. Yes, she has sworn not to take a husband from her father's hand--so I've persuaded him to trust her to walk with me in the garden, and then we shall give him the slip.  _Don. Louisa_. And is Don Jerome to know nothing of this?  _Isaac_. O Lud, no! there lies the jest. Don't you see that, by this step, I over-reach him? I shall be entitled to the girl's fortune, without settling a ducat on her. Ha! ha! ha! I'm a cunning dog, an't I? a sly little villain, eh?  _Don Ant_. Ha! ha! ha! you are indeed!  _Isaac_. Roguish, you'll say, but keen, eh? devilish keen?  _Don Ant_. So you are indeed--keen--very keen.  _Isaac_. And what a laugh we shall have at Don Jerome's when the truth comes out I hey?  _Don. Louisa_. Yes, I'll answer for it, we shall have a good laugh, when the truth comes out, Ha! ha! ha!   _Re-enter_ DON CARLOS.  _Don Car_. Here are the dancers come to practise the fandango you intended to have honoured Donna Louisa with.  _Isaac_. Oh, I shan't want them; but, as I must pay them, I'll see a caper for my money. Will you excuse me?  _Don. Louisa_. Willingly.  _Isaac_. Here's my friend, whom you may command for any service. Madam, our most obedient--Antonio, I wish you all happiness.-- [_Aside_.] Oh, the easy blockhead! what a tool I have made of him!-- This was a masterpiece! [_Exit_.]  _Don. Louisa_. Carlos, will you be my guard again, and convey me to the convent of St. Catherine?  _Don Ant_. Why, Louisa--why should you go there?  _Don. Louisa_. I have my reasons, and you must not be seen to go with me; I shall write from thence to my father; perhaps, when he finds what he has driven me to, he may relent.  _Don Ant_. I have no hope from him. O Louisa! in these arms should be your sanctuary.  _Don. Louisa_. Be patient but for a little while--my father cannot force me from thence. But let me see you there before evening, and I will explain myself.  _Don Ant_. I shall obey.  _Don. Louisa_. Come, friend. Antonio, Carlos has been a lover himself.  _Don Ant_. Then he knows the value of his trust.  _Don Car_. You shall not find me unfaithful.  TRIO.    Soft pity never leaves the gentle breast   Where love has been received a welcome guest;   As wandering saints poor huts have sacred made,   He hallows every heart he once has sway'd,   And, when his presence we no longer share,   Still leaves compassion as a relic there. [_Exeunt_.]     ACT III.  SCENE I.--_A Library in_ DON JEROME'S _House_.   Enter_ DON JEROME _and_ SERVANT.  _Don Jer_. Why, I never was so amazed in my life! Louisa gone off with Isaac Mendoza! What! steal away with the very man whom I wanted her to marry--elope with her own husband, as it were--it is impossible!  _Ser_. Her maid says, sir, they had your leave to walk in the garden, while you were abroad. The door by the shrubbery was found open, and they have not been heard of since. [_Exit_.]  _Don Jer_. Well, it is the most unaccountable affair! 'sdeath! there is certainly some infernal mystery in it I can't comprehend!   _Enter_ SECOND SERVANT, _with a letter_.  _Ser_. Here is a letter, sir, from Signor Isaac. [_Exit_.]  _Don Jer_. So, so, this will explain--ay, Isaac Mendoza--let me see-- [_Reads_.]  _Dearest Sir,  You must, doubtless, be much surprised at my flight with your daughter!_--yes, 'faith, and well I may--_I had the happiness to gain her heart at our first interview_--The devil you had!--_But, she having unfortunately made a vow not to receive a husband from your hands, I was obliged to comply with her whim!_--So, so!--_We shall shortly throw ourselves at your feet, and I hope you will have a blessing ready for one, who will then be your son-in-law_. ISAAC MENDOZA.  A whim, hey? Why, the devil's in the girl, I think! This morning, she would die sooner than have him, and before evening she runs away with him! Well, well, my will's accomplished--let the motive be what it will--and the Portuguese, sure, will never deny to fulfil the rest of the article.   _Re-enter_ SERVANT, _with another letter_.  _Ser_. Sir, here's a man below, who says he brought this from my young lady, Donna Louisa. [_Exit_.]  _Don Jer_. How! yes, it's my daughter's hand, indeed! Lord, there was no occasion for them both to write; well, let's see what she says-- [_Reads_.]  _My dearest father,  How shall I entreat your pardon for the rash step I have taken--how confess the motive?_--Pish! hasn't Isaac just told me the motive?--one would think they weren't together when they wrote.--_If I have a spirit too resentful of ill usage, I have also a heart as easily affected by kindness_.--So, so, here the whole matter"]]]
