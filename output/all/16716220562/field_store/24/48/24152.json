So strange a misadventure who has seen? But if my sight deceives me not, between These rugged rocks, half-lit by the moon's ray And the declining day, It seems, or is it fancy? that I see A human dwelling?  CLARIN.  So it seems to me, Unless my wish the longed-for lodging mocks.  ROSAURA.  A rustic little palace 'mid the rocks Uplifts its lowly roof, Scarce seen by the far sun that shines aloof. Of such a rude device Is the whole structure of this edifice, That lying at the feet Of these gigantic crags that rise to greet The sun's first beams of gold, It seems a rock that down the mountain rolled.  CLARIN.  Let us approach more near, For long enough we've looked at it from here; Then better we shall see If those who dwell therein will generously A welcome give us.  ROSAURA.  See an open door (Funereal mouth 'twere best the name it bore), From which as from a womb The night is born, engendered in its gloom.  [The sound of chains is heard within.]  CLARIN.  Heavens!  what is this I hear?  ROSAURA.  Half ice, half fire, I stand transfixed with fear.  CLARIN.  A sound of chains, is it not? Some galley-slave his sentence here hath got; My fear may well suggest it so may be.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE II.  SIGISMUND, [in the tower.]  ROSAURA, CLARIN.  SIGISMUND [within].  Alas!  Ah, wretched me!  Ah, wretched me!  ROSAURA.  Oh what a mournful wail! Again my pains, again my fears prevail.  CLARIN.  Again with fear I die.  ROSAURA.  Clarin!  CLARIN.      My lady!  ROSAURA.            Let us turn and fly The risks of this enchanted tower.  CLARIN.      For one, I scarce have strength to stand, much less to run.  ROSAURA.  Is not that glimmer there afar -- That dying exhalation -- that pale star -- A tiny taper, which, with trembling blaze Flickering 'twixt struggling flames and dying rays, With ineffectual spark Makes the dark dwelling place appear more dark? Yes, for its distant light, Reflected dimly, brings before my sight A dungeon's awful gloom, Say rather of a living corse, a living tomb; And to increase my terror and surprise, Drest in the skins of beasts a man there lies: A piteous sight, Chained, and his sole companion this poor light. Since then we cannot fly, Let us attentive to his words draw nigh, Whatever they may be.  [The doors of the tower open wide, and SIGISMUND is discovered in chains and clad in the skins of beasts.  The light in the tower increases.]  SIGISMUND.  Alas!  Ah, wretched me!  Ah, wretched me! Heaven, here lying all forlorn, I desire from thee to know, Since thou thus dost treat me so, Why have I provoked thy scorn By the crime of being born?-- Though for being born I feel Heaven with me must harshly deal, Since man's greatest crime on earth Is the fatal fact of birth -- Sin supreme without appeal. This alone I ponder o'er, My strange mystery to pierce through; Leaving wholly out of view Germs my hapless birthday bore, How have I offended more, That the more you punish me? Must not other creatures be Born?  If born, what privilege Can they over me allege Of which I should not be free? Birds are born, the bird that sings, Richly robed by Nature's dower, Scarcely floats -- a feathered flower, Or a bunch of blooms with wings -- When to heaven's high halls it springs, Cuts the blue air fast and free, And no longer bound will be By the nest's secure control:-- And with so much more of soul, Must I have less liberty? Beasts are born, the beast whose skin Dappled o'er with beauteous spots, As when the great pencil dots Heaven with stars, doth scarce begin From its impulses within-- Nature's stern necessity, To be schooled in cruelty,-- Monster, waging ruthless war:-- And with instincts better far Must I have less liberty? Fish are born, the spawn that breeds Where the oozy sea-weeds float, Scarce perceives itself a boat, Scaled and plated for its needs, When from wave to wave it speeds, Measuring all the mighty sea, Testing its profundity To its depths so dark and chill:-- And with so much freer will, Must I have less liberty? Streams are born, a coiled-up snake When its path the streamlet finds, Scarce a silver serpent winds 'Mong the flowers it must forsake, But a song of praise doth wake, Mournful though its music be, To the plain that courteously Opes a path through which it flies:-- And with life that never dies, Must I have less liberty? When I think of this I start, Aetna-like in wild unrest I would pluck from out my breast Bit by bit my burning heart:-- For what law can so depart From all right, as to deny One lone man that liberty -- That sweet gift which God bestows On the crystal stream that flows, Birds and fish that float or fly?  ROSAURA.  Fear and deepest sympathy Do I feel at every word.  SIGISMUND.  Who my sad lament has heard? What!  Clotaldo!  CLARIN [aside to his mistress].      Say 'tis he.  ROSAURA.  No, 'tis but a wretch (ah, me!) Who in these dark caves and cold Hears the tale your lips unfold.  SIGISMUND.  Then you'll die for listening so, That you may not know I know That you know the tale I told.  [Seizes her.]  Yes, you'll die for loitering near: In these strong arms gaunt and grim I will tear you limb from limb.  CLARIN.  I am deaf and couldn't hear:-- No!  ROSAURA.      If human heart you bear, 'Tis enough that I prostrate me. At thy feet, to liberate me!  SIGISMUND.  Strange thy voice can so unbend me, Strange thy sight can so suspend me, And respect so penetrate me! Who art thou? for though I see Little from this lonely room, This, my cradle and my tomb. Being all the world to me, And if birthday it could be, Since my birthday I have known But this desert wild and lone, Where throughout my life's sad course I have lived, a breathing corse, I have moved, a skeleton; And though I address or see Never but one man alone, Who my sorrows all hath known, And through whom have come to me Notions of earth, sky, and sea; And though harrowing thee again, Since thou'lt call me in this den, Monster fit for bestial feasts, I'm a man among wild beasts, And a wild beast amongst men. But though round me has been wrought All this woe, from beasts I've learned Polity, the same discerned Heeding what the birds had taught, And have measured in my thought The fair orbits of the spheres; You alone, 'midst doubts and fears, Wake my wonder and surprise -- Give amazement to my eyes, Admiration to my ears. Every time your face I see You produce a new amaze: After the most steadfast gaze, I again would gazer be. I believe some hydropsy Must affect my sight, I think Death must hover on the brink Of those wells of light, your eyes, For I look with fresh surprise, And though death result, I drink. Let me see and die:  forgive me; For I do not know, in faith, If to see you gives me death, What to see you not would give me; Something worse than death would grieve me, Anger, rage, corroding care, Death, but double death it were, Death with tenfold terrors rife, Since what gives the wretched life, Gives the happy death, despair!  ROSAURA.  Thee to see wakes such dismay, Thee to hear I so admire, That I'm powerless to inquire, That I know not what to say: Only this, that I to-day, Guided by a wiser will, Have here come to cure my ill, Here consoled my grief to see, If a wretch consoled can be Seeing one more wretched still. Of a sage, who roamed dejected, Poor, and wretched, it is said, That one day, his wants being fed By the herbs which he collected, \"Is there one\" (he thus reflected) \"Poorer than I am to-day?\" Turning round him to survey, He his answer got, detecting A still poorer sage collecting Even the leaves he threw away. Thus complaining to excess, Mourning fate, my life I led, And when thoughtlessly I said To myself, \"Does earth possess One more steeped in wretchedness?\" I in thee the answer find. Since revolving in my mind, I perceive that all my pains To become thy joyful gains Thou hast gathered and entwined. And if haply some slight solace By these pains may be imparted,* Hear attentively the story Of my life's supreme disasters. I am ....

CLOTALDO, Soldiers, SIGISMUND, ROSAURA, CLARIN.  CLOTALDO [within].  Warders of this tower, Who, or sleeping or faint-hearted, Give an entrance to two persons Who herein have burst a passage . . . .  ROSAURA.  New confusion now I suffer.  SIGISMUND.  'Tis Clotaldo, who here guards me; Are not yet my miseries ended?  CLOTALDO [within].  Hasten hither, quick! be active! And before they can defend them, Kill them on the spot, or capture!  [Voices within.]  Treason!  CLARIN.      Watchguards of this tower, Who politely let us pass here, Since you have the choice of killing Or of capturing, choose the latter.  [Enter CLOTALDO and Soldiers; he with a pistol, and all with their faces covered.]  CLOTALDO [aside to the Soldiers].  Keep your faces all well covered, For it is a vital matter That we should be known by no one, While I question these two stragglers.  CLARIN.  Are there masqueraders here?  CLOTALDO.  Ye who in your ignorant rashness Have passed through the bounds and limits Of this interdicted valley, 'Gainst the edict of the King, Who has publicly commanded None should dare descry the wonder That among these rocks is guarded, Yield at once your arms and lives, Or this pistol, this cold aspic Formed of steel, the penetrating Poison of two balls will scatter, The report and fire of which Will the air astound and startle.  SIGISMUND.  Ere you wound them, ere you hurt them, Will my life, O tyrant master, Be the miserable victim Of these wretched chains that clasp me; Since in them, I vow to God, I will tear myself to fragments With my hands, and with my teeth, In these rocks here, in these caverns, Ere I yield to their misfortunes, Or lament their sad disaster."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6363"],["title","Life Is a Dream (#3)"],["body","ALDO.  If you know that your misfortunes, Sigismund, are unexampled, Since before being born you died By Heaven's mystical enactment; If you know these fetters are Of your furies oft so rampant But the bridle that detains them, But the circle that contracts them. Why these idle boasts?  The door [To the Soldiers.] Of this narrow prison fasten; Leave him there secured.  SIGISMUND.  Ah, heavens, It is wise of you to snatch me Thus from freedom! since my rage 'Gainst you had become Titanic, Since to break the glass and crystal Gold-gates of the sun, my anger On the firm-fixed rocks' foundations Would have mountains piled of marble.  CLOTALDO.  'Tis that you should not so pile them That perhaps these ills have happened,  [Some of the SOLDIERS lead SIGISMUND into his prison, the doors of which are closed upon him.]          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE IV.  ROSAURA, CLOTALDO, CLARIN, Soldiers.  ROSAURA.  Since I now have seen how pride Can offend thee, I were hardened Sure in folly not here humbly At thy feet for life to ask thee; Then to me extend thy pity, Since it were a special harshness If humility and pride, Both alike were disregarded.  CLARIN.  If Humility and Pride Those two figures who have acted Many and many a thousand times In the \"autos sacramentales\", Do not move you, I, who am neither Proud nor humble, but a sandwich Partly mixed of both, entreat you To extend to us your pardon.  CLOTALDO.  Ho!  SOLDIERS.  My lord?  CLOTALDO.  Disarm the two, And their eyes securely bandage, So that they may not be able To see whither they are carried.  ROSAURA.  This is, sir, my sword; to thee Only would I wish to hand it, Since in fine of all the others Thou art chief, and I could hardly Yield it unto one less noble.  CLARIN.  Mine I'll give the greatest rascal Of your troop: [To a Soldier.] so take it, you.  ROSAURA.  And if I must die, to thank thee For thy pity, I would leave thee This as pledge, which has its value From the owner who once wore it; That thou guard it well, I charge thee, For although I do not know What strange secret it may carry, This I know, that some great mystery Lies within this golden scabbard, Since relying but on it I to Poland here have travelled To revenge a wrong.  CLOTALDO [aside.]  Just heavens! What is this?  Still graver, darker, Grow my doubts and my confusion, My anxieties and my anguish.-- Speak, who gave you this?  ROSAURA.      A woman.  CLOTALDO.  And her name?  ROSAURA.      To that my answer Must be silence.  CLOTALDO.  But from what Do you now infer, or fancy, That this sword involves a secret?  ROSAURA.  She who gave it said:  \"Depart hence Into Poland, and by study, Stratagem, and skill so manage That this sword may be inspected By the nobles and the magnates Of that land, for you, I know, Will by one of them be guarded,\"-- But his name, lest he was dead, Was not then to me imparted.  CLOTALDO [aside].  Bless me, Heaven! what's this I hear? For so strangely has this happened, That I cannot yet determine If 'tis real or imagined. This is the same sword that I Left with beauteous Violante, As a pledge unto its wearer, Who might seek me out thereafter, As a son that I would love him, And protect him as a father. What is to be done (ah, me!) In confusion so entangled, If he who for safety bore it Bears it now but to dispatch him, Since condemned to death he cometh To my feet?  How strange a marvel! What a lamentable fortune! How unstable! how unhappy! This must be my son -- the tokens All declare it, superadded To the flutter of the heart, That to see him loudly rappeth At the breast, and not being able With its throbs to burst its chamber, Does as one in prison, who, Hearing tumult in the alley, Strives to look from out the window; Thus, not knowing what here passes Save the noise, the heart uprusheth To the eyes the cause to examine -- They the windows of the heart, Out through which in tears it glances. What is to be done?  (O Heavens!) What is to be done?  To drag him Now before the King were death; But to hide him from my master, That I cannot do, according To my duty as a vassal. Thus my loyalty and self-love Upon either side attack me; Each would win.  But wherefore doubt? Is not loyalty a grander, Nobler thing than life, than honour? Then let loyalty live, no matter That he die; besides, he told me, If I well recall his language, That he came to revenge a wrong, But a wronged man is a lazar,-- No, he cannot be my son, Not the son of noble fathers. But if some great chance, which no one Can be free from, should have happened, Since the delicate sense of honour Is a thing so fine, so fragile, That the slightest touch may break it, Or the faintest breath may tarnish, What could he do more, do more, He whose cheek the blue blood mantles, But at many risks to have come here It again to re-establish? Yes, he is my son, my blood, Since he shows himself so manly. And thus then betwixt two doubts A mid course alone is granted: 'Tis to seek the King, and tell him Who he is, let what will happen. A desire to save my honour May appease my royal master; Should he spare his life, I then Will assist him in demanding His revenge; but if the King Should, persisting in his anger, Give him death, then he will die Without knowing I'm his father.-- [To ROSAURA and CLARIN.] Come, then, come then with me, strangers. Do not fear in your disasters That you will not have companions In misfortune; for so balanced Are the gains of life or death, That I know not which are larger.  [Exeunt.]        *     *     *     *     *   SCENE V.  A HALL IN THE ROYAL PALACE.  [Enter at one side ASTOLFO and Soldiers, and at the other the INFANTA ESTRELLA and her Ladies.  Military music and salutes within.]  ASTOLFO.  Struck at once with admiration At thy starry eyes outshining, Mingle many a salutation, Drums and trumpet-notes combining, Founts and birds in alternation; Wondering here to see thee pass, Music in grand chorus gathers All her notes from grove and grass: Here are trumpets formed of feathers, There are birds that breathe in brass. All salute thee, fair Senora, Ordnance as their Queen proclaim thee, Beauteous birds as their Aurora, As their Pallas trumpets name thee, And the sweet flowers as their Flora; For Aurora sure thou art, Bright as day that conquers night -- Thine is Flora's peaceful part, Thou art Pallas in thy might, And as Queen thou rul'st my heart.  ESTRELLA.  If the human voice obeying Should with human action pair, Then you have said ill in saying All these flattering words and fair, Since in truth they are gainsaying This parade of victory, 'Gainst which I my standard rear, Since they say, it seems to me, Not the flatteries that I hear, But the rigours that I see. Think, too, what a base invention From a wild beast's treachery sprung,-- Fraudful mother of dissension -- Is to flatter with the tongue, And to kill with the intention.  ASTOLFO.  Ill informed you must have been, Fair Estrella, thus to throw Doubt on my respectful mien: Let your ear attentive lean While the cause I strive show. King Eustorgius the Fair, Third so called, died leaving two Daughters, and Basilius heir; Of his sisters I and you Are the children -- I forbear To recall a single scene Save what's needful.  Clorilene, Your good mother and my aunt, Who is now a habitant Of a sphere of sunnier sheen, Was the elder, of whom you Are the daughter; Recisunda, Whom God guard a thousand years, Her fair sister (Rosamunda Were she called if names were true) Wed in Muscovy, of whom I was born.  'Tis needful now The commencement to resume. King Basilius, who doth bow 'Neath the weight of years, the doom Age imposes, more inclined To the studies of the mind Than to women, wifeless, lone, Without sons, to fill his throne I and you our way would find. You, the elder's child, averred, That the crown you stood more nigh: I, maintaining that you erred, Held, though born of the younger, I, Being a man, should be preferred. Thus our mutual pretension To our uncle we related, Who replied that he would mention Here, and on this day he stated, What might settle the dissension. With this end, from Muscovy I set out, and with that view, I to-day fair Poland see, And not making war on you, Wait till war you make on me. Would to love -- that God so wise -- That the crowd may be a sure Astrologue to read the skies, And this festive truce secure Both to you and me the prize, Making you a Queen, but Queen By my will, our uncle leaving You the throne we'll share between -- And my love a realm receiving Dearer than a King's demesne.  ESTRELLA.  Well, I must be generous too, For a gallantry so fine; This imperial realm you view, If I wish it to be mine 'Tis to give it unto you. Though if I the truth confessed, I must fear your love may fail -- Flattering words are words at best, For perhaps a truer tale Tells that portrait on your breast.  ASTOLFO.  On that point complete content Will I give your mind, not here, For each sounding instrument [Drums are heard.] Tells us that the King is near, With his Court and Parliament.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE VI.
