This strange affray, What can it mean, magnanimous Prince? would you So bright a blade imbrue In blood that age already doth congeal? Back to its sheath return the shining steel.  SIGISMUND.  Yes, when it is bathed red In his base blood.  ASTOLFO.  This threatened life hath fled For sanctuary to my feet; I must protect it in that poor retreat.  SIGISMUND.  Protect your own life, then, for in this way, Striking at it, I will the grudge repay I owe you for the past.  ASTOLFO.  I thus defend My life; but majesty will not offend.

Did you not then respect These snow-white hairs?  CLOTALDO.  My lord will recollect They scarce deserved it, being mine.  SIGISMUND.  Who dares To ask of me do I respect white hairs? Your own some day My feet may trample in the public way, For I have not as yet revenged my wrong, Your treatment so unjust and my sad state so long. [Exit.]  BASILIUS.  But ere that dawn doth break, You must return to sleep, where when you wake All that hath happened here will seem -- As is the glory of the world -- a dream.

Ah, how rarely fate doth lie When it some misfortune threatens!* Dubious when 'tis good that's promised, When 'tis evil, ah, too certain!-- What a good astrologer Would he be, whose art foretelleth Only cruel things; for, doubtless, They would turn out true for ever! This in Sigismund and me Is exemplified, Estrella, Since between our separate fortunes Such a difference is presented. In his case had been foreseen Murders, miseries, and excesses, And in all they turned out true, Since all happened as expected. But in mine, here seeing, lady, Rays so rare and so resplendent That the sun is but their shadow. And even heaven a faint resemblance, When fate promised me good fortune, Trophies, praises, and all blessings, It spoke ill and it spoke well; For it was of both expressive, When it held out hopes of favour, But disdain alone effected.

Oh, I doubt not these fine speeches Are quite true, although intended Doubtless for that other lady, She whose portrait was suspended From your neck, when first, Astolfo, At this Court here you addressed me. This being so, 'tis she alone Who these compliments deserveth. Go and pay them to herself, For like bills that are protested In the counting-house of love, Are those flatteries and finesses Which to other kings and ladies Have been previously presented.          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE XI.

For where bright Estrella enters Shadow cannot be, or star Where the sun; I go to fetch it.-- [Aside.]  Pardon, beautiful Rosaura, This offence; the absent never, Man or woman, as this shows, Faith of plighted vows remember. [Exit.]  [ROSAURA comes forward.] ROSAURA [aside].  Not a single word I heard, Being afraid they might observe me.  ESTRELLA.  Oh, Astrea!  ROSAURA.  My good lady!  ESTRELLA.  Nothing could have pleased me better Than your timely coming here. I have something confidential To entrust you with.  ROSAURA.  You honour Far too much my humble service.  ESTRELLA.  Brief as is the time, Astrea, I have known you, you already Of my heart possess the keys 'Tis for this and your own merits That I venture to entrust you With what oft I have attempted From myself to hide.  ROSAURA.  Your slave!  ESTRELLA.  Then concisely to express it, Know, Astolfo, my first cousin ('Tis enough that word to mention, For some things may best be said When not spoken but suggested), Soon expects to wed with me, If my fate so far relenteth, As that by one single bliss All past sorrows may be lessened. I was troubled, the first day That we met, to see suspended From his neck a lady's portrait. On the point I urged him gently, He so courteous and polite Went immediately to get it, And will bring it here.  From him I should feel quite disconcerted To receive it.  You here stay, And request him to present it Unto you.  I say no more. You are beautiful and clever, You must know too what is love. [Exit.]          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE XII.  ROSAURA.  Would I knew it not!  O help me Now, kind heaven! for who could be So prudential, so collected, As to know how best to act In so painful a dilemma? Is there in the world a being, Is there one a more inclement Heaven has marked with more misfortunes, Has 'mid more of sorrow centred?-- What, bewildered, shall I do, When 'tis vain to be expected That my reason can console me, Or consoling be my helper? From my earliest misfortune Everything that I've attempted Has been but one misery more -- Each the other's sad successor, All inheritors of themselves. Thus, the Phoenix they resemble, One is from the other born, New life springs where old life endeth, And the young are warmly cradled By the ashes of the elder. Once a wise man called them cowards, Seeing that misfortunes never Have been seen to come alone. But I call them brave, intrepid, Who go straight unto their end, And ne'er turn their backs in terror:-- By the man who brings them with him Everything may be attempted, Since he need on no occasion Have the fear of being deserted. I may say so, since at all times, Whatsoever life presented, I, without them, never saw me, Nor will they grow weary ever, Till they see me in death's arms, Wounded by fate's final weapon. Woe is me! but what to-day Shall I do in this emergence?-- If I tell my name, Clotaldo, Unto whom I am indebted For my very life and honour, May be with me much offended; Since he said my reparation Must in silence be expected. If I tell not to Astolfo Who I am, and he detects me How can I dissemble then? For although a feigned resemblance Eyes and voice and tongue might try, Ah, the truthful heart would tremble, And expose the lie.  But wherefore Study what to do?  'Tis certain That however I may study, Think beforehand how to nerve me, When at last the occasion comes, Then alone what grief suggesteth I will do, for no one holds In his power the heart's distresses. And thus what to say or do As my soul cannot determine, Grief must only reach to-day Its last limit, pain be ended, And at last an exit make From the doubts that so perplex me How to act: but until then Help me, heaven, oh, deign to help me!          *     *     *     *     *   SCENE XIII.  ASTOLFO, with the portrait; and ROSAURA.  ASTOLFO.  Here then is the portrait, Princess: But, good God!  ROSAURA.  Your Highness trembles; What has startled, what surprised you?  ASTOLFO.  Thee, Rosaura, to see present.  ROSAURA.  I Rosaura?  Oh, your Highness Is deceived by some resemblance Doubtless to some other lady; I'm Astrea, one who merits Not the glory of producing An emotion so excessive.  ASTOLFO.  Ah, Rosaura thou mayst feign, But the soul bears no deception, And though seeing thee as Astrea, As Rosaura it must serve thee.  ROSAURA.  I, not knowing what your Highness Speaks of, am of course prevented From replying aught but this, That Estrella (the bright Hesper Of this sphere) was pleased to order That I here should wait expectant For that portrait, which to me She desires you give at present: For some reason she prefers It through me should be presented -- So Estrella -- say, my star -- Wishes -- so a fate relentless Wills -- in things that bring me loss -- So Estrella now expecteth.  ASTOLFO.  Though such efforts you attempt, Still how badly you dissemble, My Rosaura!  Tell the eyes In their music to keep better Concert with the voice, because Any instrument whatever Would be out of tune that sought To combine and blend together The true feelings of the heart With the false words speech expresses.  ROSAURA.  I wait only, as I said, For the portrait.  ASTOLFO.  Since you're bent then To the end to keep this tone, I adopt it, and dissemble. Tell the Princess, then, Astrea, That I so esteem her message, That to send to her a copy Seems to me so slight a present, How so highly it is valued By myself, I think it better To present the original, And you easily may present it, Since, in point of fact, you bring it With you in your own sweet person.  ROSAURA.  When it has been undertaken By a man, bold, brave, determined, To obtain a certain object, Though he get perhaps a better, Still not bringing back the first He returns despised:  I beg, then. That your highness give the portrait; I, without it, dare not venture.  ASTOLFO.  How, then, if I do not give it Will you get it?  ROSAURA.  I will get it Thus, ungrateful. [She attempts to snatch it.[  ASTOLFO.  'Tis in vain.  ROSAURA.  It must ne'er be seen, no, never In another woman's hands.  ASTOLFO.  Thou art dreadful.  ROSAURA.  Thou deceptive.  ASTOLFO.

THE PRINCIPLES OF AESTHETICS  BY  DEWITT H. PARKER  PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN    PREFACE  This book has grown out of lectures to students at the University of Michigan and embodies my effort to express to them the nature and meaning of art. In writing it, I have sought to maintain scientific accuracy, yet at the same time to preserve freedom of style and something of the inspiration of the subject. While intended primarily for students, the book will appeal generally, I hope, to people who are interested in the intelligent appreciation of art.  My obligations are extensive,--most directly to those whom I have cited in foot-notes to the text, but also to others whose influence is too indirect or pervasive to make citation profitable, or too obvious to make it necessary. For the broader philosophy of art, my debt is heaviest, I believe, to the artists and philosophers during the period from Herder to Hegel, who gave to the study its greatest development, and, among contemporaries, to Croce and Lipps. In addition, I have drawn freely upon the more special investigations of recent times, but with the caution desirable in view of the very tentative character of some of the results. To Mrs. Robert M. Wenley I wish to express my thanks for her very careful and helpful reading of the page proof.  The appended bibliography is, of course, not intended to be in any sense adequate, but is offered merely as a guide to further reading; a complete bibliography would itself demand almost a volume.

The average man, who may exercise considerable taste in personal adornment, in the decoration of the home, or in the choice of poetry and painting, is at a loss when called upon to tell what art is or to explain why he calls one thing \"beautiful\" and another \"ugly.\" Even the artist and the connoisseur, skilled to produce or accurate in judgment, are often wanting in clear and consistent ideas about their own works or appreciations. Here, as elsewhere, we meet the contrast between feeling and doing, on the one hand, and knowing, on the other. Just as practical men are frequently unable to describe or justify their most successful methods or undertakings, just as many people who astonish us with their fineness and freedom in the art of living are strangely wanting in clear thoughts about themselves and the life which they lead so admirably, so in the world of beauty, the men who do and appreciate are not always the ones who understand.  Very often, moreover, the artist and the art lover justify their inability to understand beauty on the ground that beauty is too subtle a thing for thought. How, they say, can one hope to distill into clear and stable ideas such a vaporous and fleeting matter as Aesthetic feeling? Such men are not only unable to think about beauty, but skeptical as to the possibility of doing so,--contented mystics, deeply feeling, but dumb.  However, there have always been artists and connoisseurs who have striven to reflect upon their appreciations and acts, unhappy until they have understood and justified what they were doing; and one meets with numerous art-loving people whose intellectual curiosity is rather quickened than put to sleep by just that element of elusiveness in beauty upon which the mystics dwell. Long acquaintance with any class of objects leads naturally to the formation of some definition or general idea of them, and the repeated performance of the same type of act impels to the search for a principle that can be communicated to other people in justification of what one is doing and in defense of the value which one attaches to it. Thoughtful people cannot long avoid trying to formulate the relation of their interest in beauty, which absorbs so much energy and devotion, to other human interests, to fix its place in the scheme of life. It would be surprising, therefore, if there had been no Shelleys or Sidneys to define the relation between poetry and science, or Tolstoys to speculate on the nature of all art; and we should wonder if we did not everywhere hear intelligent people discussing the relation of utility and goodness to beauty, or asking what makes a poem or a picture great.  Now the science of aesthetics is an attempt to do in a systematic way what thoughtful art lovers have thus always been doing haphazardly. It is an effort to obtain a clear general idea of beautiful objects, our judgments upon them, and the motives underlying the acts which create them,--to raise the aesthetic life, otherwise a matter of instinct and feeling, to the level of intelligence, of understanding. To understand art means to find an idea or definition which applies to it and to no other activity, and at the same time to determine its relation to other elements of human nature; and our understanding will be complete if our idea includes all the distinguishing characteristics of art, not simply enumerated, but exhibited in their achieved relations.  How shall we proceed in seeking such an idea of art? We must follow a twofold method: first, the ordinary scientific method of observation, analysis, and experiment; and second, another and very different method, which people of the present day often profess to avoid, but which is equally necessary, as I shall try to show, and actually employed by those who reject it. In following the first method we treat beautiful things as objects given to us for study, much as plants and animals are given to the biologist. Just as the biologist watches the behavior of his specimens, analyzes them into their various parts and functions, and controls his studies through carefully devised experiments, arriving at last at a clear notion of what a plant or an animal is--at a definition of life; so the student of aesthetics observes works of art and other well-recognized beautiful things, analyzes their elements and the forms of connection of these, arranges experiments to facilitate and guard his observations from error and, as a result, reaches the general idea for which he is looking,--the idea of beauty.  A vast material presents itself for study of this kind: the artistic attempts of children and primitive men; the well-developed art of civilized nations, past and present, as creative process and as completed work; and finally, the everyday aesthetic appreciations of nature and human life, both by ourselves and by the people whom we seek out for study. Each kind of material has its special value. The first has the advantage of the perspicuity which comes from simplicity, similar for our purposes to the value of the rudimentary forms of life for the biologist. But this advantage of early art may be overestimated; for the nature of beauty is better revealed in its maturer manifestations, even as the purposes of an individual are more fully, if not more clearly, embodied in maturity than in youth or childhood.  Yet a purely objective method will not suffice to give us an adequate idea of beauty. For beautiful things are created by men, not passively discovered, and are made, like other things which men make, in order to realize a purpose. Just as a saw is a good saw only when it fulfills the purpose of cutting wood, so works of art are beautiful only because they embody a certain purpose. The beautiful things which we study by the objective method are selected by us from among countless other objects and called beautiful because they have a value for us, without a feeling for which we should not know them to be beautiful at all. They are not, like sun and moon, independent of mind and will and capable of being understood in complete isolation from man. No world of beauty exists apart from a purpose that finds realization there. We are, to be sure, not always aware of the existence of this purpose when we enjoy a picture or a poem or a bit of landscape; yet it is present none the less. The child is equally unaware of the purpose of the food which pleases him, yet the purpose is the ground of his pleasure; and we can understand his hunger only through a knowledge of it.  The dependence of beauty upon a relation to purpose is clear from the fact that in our feelings and judgments about art we not only change and disagree, but correct ourselves and each other. The history of taste, both in the individual and the race, is not a mere process, but a progress, an evolution. \"We were wrong in calling that poem beautiful,\" we say; \"you are mistaken in thinking that picture a good one\"; \"the eighteenth century held a false view of the nature of poetry\"; \"the English Pre-Raphaelites confused the functions of poetry and painting\"; \"to-day we understand what the truly pictorial is better than Giotto did\"; and so on. Now nothing can be of worth to us, one thing cannot be better than another, nor can we be mistaken as to its"]]]
