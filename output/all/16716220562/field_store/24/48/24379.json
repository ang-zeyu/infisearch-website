An old writer gives us some idea of the vast quantities of salt exported    from France by the amount sent to a single country.     \"Important denique sexies mille vel circiter centenarios salis, quorum    singuli constant centenis modiis, ducentenas ut minimum & vicenas    quinas, vel & tricenas, pro salis ipsius candore puritateque, libras    pondo pendentibus, sena igitur libras centenariorum millia, computatis    in singulos aureis nummis tricenis, centum & octoginta reserunt aureorum    millia.\"--_Belguae Descrtptio_, a Lud. Gvicciardino, Amstelodami, 1652,    p. 244.     TRANSLATION.--They import in fine 6000 centenarii of salt, each one of    which contains 100 bushels, weighing at least 225 or 230 pounds,    according to the purity and whiteness of the salt; therefore six    thousand centenarii, computing each at thirty golden nummi, amount to    180,000 aurei.     It may not be easy to determine the value of this importation in money,    since the value of gold is constantly changing, but the quantity    imported may be readily determined, which was according to the above    statement, 67,500 tons.     A treaty of April 30, 1527, between Francis I. of France and Henry VIII.    of England, provided as follows:--\"And, besides, should furnish unto the    said _Henry_, as long as hee lived, yearly, of the Salt of _Brouage_,    the value of fifteene thousand Crownes.\"--_Life and Raigne of Henry    VIII._, by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, London, 1649, p. 206.     Saintonge continued for a long time to be the source of large exports of    salt. De Witt, writing about the year 1658, says they received in    Holland of \"salt, yearly, the lading of 500 or 600 ships, exported from    Rochel, Maran, Brouage, the Island of Oleron, and Ree.\"--_Republick of    Holland_, by John De Witt, London, 1702, p. 271.

Philippe Emanuel de Lorraine, Duc de Mercoeur, born at Nomény,     September 9, 1558, was the son of Nicolas, Count de Vaudemont, by his     second wife, Jeanne de Savoy, and was half-brother of Queen Louise, the     wife of Henry III. He was made governor of Brittany in 1582. He     embraced the party of the League before the death of Henry III.,     entered into an alliance with Philip II., and gave the Spaniards     possession of the port of Blavet in 1591. He made his submission to     Henry IV. in 1598, on which occasion his only daughter Françoise,     probably the richest heiress in the kingdom, was contracted in marriage     to César, Duc de Vendôme, the illegitimate son of Henry IV. by     Gabrielle d'Estrées, the Duchess de Beaufort. The Duc de Mercoeur died     at Nuremburg, February 19, 1602.--_Vide Birch's Memoirs of Queen     Elizabeth_, Vol. I., p. 82; _Davila's His. Civil Warres of France_, p.     1476.  14.

He distinguished himself at the battles of     Dreux, Saint-Denis, Montcontour, and in the famous siege of     Rochelle in 1573. After the death of Henry III., he was the first     to recognize Henry IV., whom he served with the same zeal as he     had his five predecessors. He took part in the brilliant battle of     Arques in 1589. In the following year, he so distinguished himself     at Ivry that Henry IV., inviting him to sup with him after this     memorable battle, addressed to him these flattering words, \"Il est     juste que vous soyez du festin, après m'avoir si bien servi à mes     noces.\" At the siege of the Château de Camper, in Upper Brittany,     he received a musket shot which fractured his arm, and died of the     wound on the 19th of August, 1595, at the age of seventy-three     years. \"Ce grand capitaine qui avoit si bien mérité du Roi et de     la nation, emporta dans le tombeau les regrets des Officiers & des     soldats, qui pleurerent amérement la perte de leur Général.

He was early appointed governor of     Saintonge, and of the Fortress of Brouage, which he successfully     defended in 1585 against the attack of the King of Navarre and the     Prince de Condé. He assisted at the battle of Coutras in 1587. He     served as a lieutenant-general in Brittany from 1592 to 1596. In     1594, he planned with Brissac, his brother-in-law, then governor     of Paris for the League, for the surrender of Paris to Henry     IV. For this he was offered the baton of a Marshal of France by     the king, which he modestly declined, and begged that it might be     given to Brissac. In 1578, through the influence or authority of     Henry III., he married the heiress, Jeanne de Cosse-Brissac,     sister of Charles de Cosse-Brissac, _postea_, a lady of no     personal attractions, but of excellent understanding and     character.  --_Vide Courcelle's Histoire Généalogique des Pairs de     France_, Vol.  II.; _Birch's Memoirs of Queen Elizabeth_, Vol. I.,     pp. 163, 191; _Freer's Henry III._, p. 162; _De Mezeray's     His.

The service of Champlain as quarter-master in the war in Brittany commenced probably with the appointment of Marshal d'Aumont to the command of the army in 1592, and, if we are right in this conjecture, it covered a period of not far from six years. The activity of the army, and the difficulty of obtaining supplies in the general destitution of the province, imposed upon him constant and perplexing duty. But in the midst of his embarrassments he was gathering up valuable experience, not only relating to the conduct of war, but to the transactions of business under a great variety of forms. He was brought into close and intimate relations with men of character, standing, and influence. The knowledge, discipline, and self-control of which he was daily becoming master were unconsciously fitting him for a career, humble though it might seem in its several stages, but nevertheless noble and potent in its relations to other generations.  At the close of the war, the army which it had called into existence was disbanded, the soldiers departed to their homes, the office of quarter-master was of necessity vacated, and Champlain was left without employment.  Casting about for some new occupation, following his instinctive love of travel and adventure, he conceived the idea of attempting an exploration of the Spanish West Indies, with the purpose of bringing back a report that should be useful to France. But this was an enterprise not easy either to inaugurate or carry out. The colonial establishments of Spain were at that time hermetically sealed against all intercourse with foreign nations. Armed ships, like watch-dogs, were ever on the alert, and foreign merchantmen entered their ports only at the peril of confiscation. It was necessary for Spain to send out annually a fleet, under a convoy of ships of war, for the transportation of merchandise and supplies for the colonies, returning laden with cargoes of almost priceless value. Champlain, fertile in expedient, proposed to himself to visit Spain, and there form such acquaintances and obtain such influence as would secure to him in some way a passage to the Indies in this annual expedition.  The Spanish forces, allies of the League in the late war, had not yet departed from the coast of France. He hastened to the port of Blavet, [18] where they were about to embark, and learned to his surprise and gratification that several French ships had been chartered, and that his uncle, a distinguished French mariner, commonly known as the _Provençal Cappitaine_, had received orders from Marshal de Brissac to conduct the fleet, on which the garrison of Blavet was embarked, to Cadiz in Spain. Champlain easily arranged to accompany his uncle, who was in command of the \"St. Julian,\" a strong, well-built ship of five hundred tons.  Having arrived at Cadiz, and the object of the voyage having been accomplished, the French ships were dismissed, with the exception of the \"St. Julian,\" which was retained, with the Provincial Captain, who had accepted the office of pilot-general for that year, in the service of the King of Spain.  After lingering a month at Cadiz, they proceeded to St. Lucar de Barameda, where Champlain remained three months, agreeably occupied in making observations and drawings of both city and country, including a visit to Seville, some fifty miles in the interior.  In the mean time, the fleet for the annual visit to the West Indies, to which we have already alluded, was fitting out at Saint Lucar, and about to sail under the command of Don Francisco Colombo, who, attracted by the size and good sailing qualities of the \"Saint Julian,\" chartered her for the voyage. The services of the pilot-general were required in another direction, and, with the approbation of Colombo, he gave the command of the \"Saint Julian\" to Champlain. Nothing could have been more gratifying than this appointment, which assured to Champlain a visit to the more important Spanish colonies under the most favorable circumstances.  He accordingly set sail with the fleet, which left Saint Lucar at the beginning of January, 1599.  Passing the Canaries, in two months and six days they sighted the little island of Deseada, [19] the _vestibule_ of the great Caribbean archipelago, touched at Guadaloupe, wound their way among the group called the Virgins, turning to the south made for Margarita, [20] then famous for its pearl fisheries, and from thence sailed to St. Juan de Porto-rico. Here the fleet was divided into three squadrons. One was to go to Porto-bello, on the Isthmus of Panama, another to the coast of South America, then called Terra Firma, and the third to Mexico, then known as New Spain. This latter squadron, to which Champlain was attached, coasted along the northern shore of the island of Saint Domingo, otherwise Hispaniola, touching at Porto Platte, Mancenilla, Mosquitoes, Monte Christo, and Saint Nicholas. Skirting the southern coast of Cuba, reconnoitring the Caymans, [21] they at length cast anchor in the harbor of San Juan d'Ulloa, the island fortress near Vera Cruz. While here, Champlain made an inland journey to the City of Mexico, where he remained a month. He also sailed in a _patache_, or advice-boat, to Porto-bello, when, after a month, he returned again to San Juan d'Ulloa. The squadron then sailed for Havana, from which place Champlain was commissioned to visit, on public business, Cartagena, within the present limits of New Grenada, on the coast of South America. The whole _armada_ was finally collected together at Havana, and from thence took its departure for Spain, passing through the channel of Bahama, or Gulf of Florida, sighting Bermuda and the Azores, reaching Saint Lucar early in March, 1601, after an absence from that port of two years and two months. [22]  On Champlain's return to France, he prepared an elaborate report of his observations and discoveries, luminous with sixty-two illustrations sketched by his own hand. As it was his avowed purpose in making the voyage to procure information that should be valuable to his government, he undoubtedly communicated it in some form to Henry IV. The document remained in manuscript two hundred and fifty-seven years, when it was first printed at London in an English translation by the Hakluyt Society, in 1859. It is an exceedingly interesting and valuable tract, containing a lucid description of the peculiarities, manners, and customs of the people, the soil, mountains, and rivers, the trees, fruits, and plants, the animals, birds, and fishes, the rich mines found at different points, with frequent allusions to the system of colonial management, together with the character and sources of the vast wealth which these settlements were annually yielding to the Spanish crown.  The reader of this little treatise will not fail to see the drift and tendency of Champlain's mind and character unfolded on nearly every page. His indomitable perseverance, his careful observation, his honest purpose and amiable spirit are at all times apparent. Although a"]]]
