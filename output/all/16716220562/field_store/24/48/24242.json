Hold out your hands.\"  \"And if I refuse?\"  \"You won't refuse,\" put in Arnold Baxter, and, lowering his pistol, he leaped behind Tom and caught him by the arms. At the same time Dan attacked the lad in front and poor Tom was soon handcuffed. Then he was led out of the cabin by a rear way, a door was opened, and he was thrust into the blackness of the hold. But ere this was accomplished he let out one long, loud cry for help which reached Sam's ears quite plainly.  \"Hi! what are you doing to my brother?\" ejaculated the younger Rover. He had brought the rowboat close up alongside the schooner.  \"I don't know what's up,\" answered the mate of the _Peacock_. \"Better come aboard and see.\"  \"He has fallen down the hatchway!\" cried Captain Langless. \"Poor chap! he's hurt himself quite badly.\" And he disappeared, as if going to Tom's assistance.  If Sam had been in a quandary before, he was doubly so now. Had Tom really fallen, or had he been attacked?  \"I can't leave him alone,\" he thought, and without further hesitation leaped up the side of the schooner with the agility of a cat.  It was a fatal movement, for scarcely had he reached the deck when he was pounced upon by Captain Langless and held fast until Arnold Baxter appeared.  \"Let me go!\" cried Sam, but his protest proved of no avail. A lively scuffle followed, but the lad was no match for the men, and in the end he found himself handcuffed and thrown into the hold beside Tom.  \"Tie the rowboat fast to the stern,\" ordered Arnold Baxter, and this was done.  The going down of the wind was only temporary, and now a slight breeze sprang up.  \"We are in luck!\" said the captain of the schooner.  \"We must keep away from the yacht,\" returned Arnold Baxter.  Soon the schooner's sails were filling and she continued on her course, dragging the small boat behind her. Aleck Pop saw the movement and grew much perplexed.  \"Dat don't look right to me, nohow!\" he muttered. \"'Pears lak da was bein' tuk along sumway!\"  Aleck was not much of a sailor, but he had been out enough to know how to handle the yacht under ordinary circumstances, and now he did his best to follow the _Peacock_.  With the glass he watched eagerly for the reappearance of Sam and Tom, and his face became a study when fully half an hour passed and they failed to show themselves.  \"Da is in trouble, suah!\" he told himself. \"Now wot's dis yeah niggah to do?\"  He lashed the wheel fast and sought advice from Luke Peterson, who was feeling stronger every minute. The burly lumberman shook his head dubiously.  \"In trouble for certain,\" was his comment. \"Didn't hear any pistol shots, did ye?\"  \"Didn't heah nuffin, sah.\"  \"They wouldn't remain on board of that craft of their own free will.\"  \"Don't specs da would, sah. De question is, sah: wot's to do?\" And Aleck scratched his woolly head thoughtfully.  \"I don't know, excepting to keep the schooner in sight, if possible, and see if something doesn't turn up. If you sight a steamer or a steam tug let me know, and I'll try to get help.\"  So it was arranged, and Aleck returned to the wheel. The _Swallow_ was going along smoothly, and he did what he could to make the sails draw as much as possible. Peterson now discovered the medicine chest of the yacht, and from this got another dose of liquor, which afforded him the temporary strength of which he was in so much need.  The coming of night found the two vessels far out upon the waters of Lake Erie and nearly half a mile apart. Peterson now came on deck, to keep an eye on things while Aleck prepared supper. It promised to remain clear, but, as there would be no moon, Peterson was afraid that they would lose sight of the _Peacock_ in the gathering darkness.  Supper was soon served, the lumberman eating first, and then Aleck cleared away the few dishes and tidied up generally. The colored man was much downcast.  \"Fust it was Dick, an' now it am de whole t'ree of 'em,\" he remarked. \"I'se afraid dar is gwine ter be a bad endin' to dis yeah trip.\"  \"We will have to take what comes,\" answered Peterson. \"But I have taken a fancy to those boys, and I'll stick by you to the end.\"  Slowly the darkness of night settled over the waters of the lake, and with the going down of the sun the stars came forth, one after another. During the last few hours several sail had been seen at a distance, but none had come close enough to be hailed.  \"We are going to lose her in the darkness, after all,\" announced the lumberman, at about eight o'clock. \"It's hard for me to see her, even now.\"  Half an hour later the _Peacock_ disappeared in the gloom, and the chase, for the time being, came to an end.     CHAPTER X.  THE ESCAPE FROM THE HOLD.   \"Sam, is that you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"We are trapped!\"  \"It looks like it--or rather feels like it. I can't see a thing.\"  \"Nor I. Did you find out anything about Dick?\"  \"No.\"  A groan came from the opposite end of the hold.  \"Here I am. How in the world did you get here?\"  \"Dick, after all!\" ejaculated Tom, and there was a slight trace of joy in his tone. \"Are you O. K., old man?\"  \"Hardly. They dosed me with drugs until my mind is topsy-turvy.\"  \"I'm glad you are alive,\" came from Sam. \"Where are you?\"  \"Here, lying on a couple of boxes. Look out how you move about, or you may hurt yourselves.\"  Handcuffed as they were, Tom and Sam felt their way along through the dark hold until they reached their elder brother's side. They grasped his hands warmly.  \"I'm glad we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" remarked Tom, and this was his younger brother's sentiment, too.  \"How did you get here?\" asked Dick, and each told his story from beginning to end, and then the elder Rover had to relate his own adventures.  \"I knew that old doctor wasn't telling the truth,\" burst out Tom. \"Oh, but won't we have an account to settle with all of those chaps, if ever we get out of this scrape.\"  \"Don't let us hurrah until we are out of the woods,\" added Dick soberly. \"We are in the hands of a desperate gang, to my way of reasoning.\"  \"The Baxters are certainly bad enough.\"  \"And any boat captain who would go into this game with them is probably just as bad. Whom did you leave on the yacht?\"  \"Aleck, and the lumberman who was on the raft with you.\"  \"I wonder if they will follow this schooner?\"  No one could answer this question, and for several minutes there was a silence. During that time they heard heavy footsteps cross and recross the deck, but that was all. Presently the schooner began to rock slightly.  \"The wind is coming up,\" said Tom. \"We are moving ahead again.\"  \"That's bad for us--if the schooner manages to run away from the yacht,\" rejoined Dick.  Soon the motion of the _Peacock_ showed that the schooner was bowling along rapidly. They heard the creaking of tackle as additional sails were hoisted, and felt certain that the craft was making the best run at her command.  The hold had not been opened up for a long time, consequently the air was foul as well as stifling from the heat.  \"I'd give something for some fresh air,\" said Sam. \"How is it with you, Dick?\"  \"I want fresh air and a drink of water. I am as dry as a bale of cotton.\"  \"Haven't they given you anything since you came on board?\" asked Tom.  \"Not a thing.\"  \"The inhuman wretches! Oh, I wish I had Dan Baxter here--I'd punch his head good for him.\"  \"Ditto the head of his rascally father,\" returned Dick. \"I would like to know just where they intend to take me--or rather all of us, now. They certainly can't expect to keep us on board this craft.\"  \"Perhaps they'll ship us to Canada.\"  \"Hardly, since they couldn't land on the Canadian shore without an inspection of the vessel.\"  \"They have some plan up their sleeve, that's certain.\"  Slowly the hours wore away, until all sounds on deck ceased, and they knew it must be well along in the night. Still the schooner kept on her course.  All of the boys had been working at their bonds, but without success. They wished they had a light, but neither Sam nor Tom had a match, and Dick's pockets were entirely bare. Tom and Sam were likewise minus their pistols, Arnold Baxter having taken the weapons away before placing them in the hold.  The night proved to be a truly horrible one for the boys, for the hold was overrun with rats, who became altogether too familiar. At first one of the pests ran over Tom's legs.  \"A rat!\" he cried. \"Hi, scat!\" And the frisky rodent scampered off, but speedily returned, followed by several others. After that they had a lively time of it for half an hour, when the rats left them as suddenly as they had appeared.  The storm, and their various adventures, had tired the boys out, and soon, in spite of the surroundings, one after another fell into a light doze. The sleep did all of them good, especially Dick, who declared on awakening that he felt almost as well as ever.  \"Only I'm as hungry as a bear,\" he added.  \"Ditto myself,\" came from Tom. \"I move we try to break out of this dingy hole.\"  \"All right; but where shall we break to?\" put in Sam. \"I can't see much more than I could last night.\"  The matter was talked over, and presently they scattered, to feel along the ribbed walls of the hold.  For a long time nobody felt anything of importance, but at last Sam let out a soft cry:  \"I've found something of a door!\"  \"Good for you,\" answered Tom. \"Can you open it?\"  \"No, there seems to be a bar or something on the other side.\"  The others rejoined the youngest Rover, and made out the door quite plainly, for there was a broad crack at the top and at the side opposite the hinges. There was a bar, true enough.  \"If we had something that we could slip into that crack, we might move the bar,\" observed Dick.  \"I slipped on a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/646"],["title","The Coral Island: A Tale of the Pacific Ocean (#0)"],["body","{Book cover: cover.jpg}      The Coral Island: A Tale of the Pacific Ocean   {A coral island: p0.jpg}  BY  ROBERT MICHAEL BALLANTYNE, AUTHOR OF \"HUDSON'S BAY; OR, EVERY-DAY LIFE IN THE WILDS OF NORTH AMERICA; \"SNOW-FLAKES AND SUN-BEAMS; OR, THE YOUNG FUR-TRADERS;\" \"UNGAVA: A TALE OF THE ESQUIMAUX,\" ETC., ETC.

Roving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my heart, the very sunshine of my existence. In childhood, in boyhood, and in man's estate, I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world.  It was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night in which I was born on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean. My father was a sea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had been a marine. Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_ father had followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an admiral in the royal navy. At anyrate we knew that, as far back as our family could be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great watery waste. Indeed this was the case on both sides of the house; for my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so spent the greater part of her life upon the water.  Thus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition. Soon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring life, purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home. It was not long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me. For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength, so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a man; all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise. One day I took advantage of my dear mother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door. Ah, how vividly I remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body! From this time forth my rambles became more frequent, and, as I grew older, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting vessel, and let me go to sea.  For some years I was happy in visiting the sea-ports, and in coasting along the shores of my native land. My Christian name was Ralph, and my comrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the passion which I always evinced for travelling. Rover was not my real name, but as I never received any other I came at last to answer to it as naturally as to my proper name; and, as it is not a bad one, I see no good reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph Rover. My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got on very well together. They did, indeed, very frequently make game of and banter me, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying that Ralph Rover was a \"queer, old-fashioned fellow.\" This, I must confess, surprised me much, and I pondered the saying long, but could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my old-fashionedness lay. It is true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke except when spoken to. Moreover, I never could understand the jokes of my companions even when they were explained to me: which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much grief; however, I tried to make up for it by smiling and looking pleased when I observed that they were laughing at some witticism which I had failed to detect. I was also very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind. But in all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural, and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me \"an old-fashioned fellow.\"  Now, while engaged in the coasting trade, I fell in with many seamen who had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess that my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild adventures in foreign lands,--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the appalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had seen both on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and strange people they had visited. But of all the places of which they told me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral Islands of the Southern Seas. They told me of thousands of beautiful fertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the coral insect, where summer reigned nearly all the year round,--where the trees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit,--where the climate was almost perpetually delightful,--yet where, strange to say, men were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles to which the gospel of our Saviour had been conveyed. These exciting accounts had so great an effect upon my mind, that, when I reached the age of fifteen, I resolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.  I had no little difficulty at first in prevailing on my dear parents to let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the truth of what I said, and gave his consent. My dear mother, seeing that my father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes. \"But oh, Ralph,\" she said, on the day I bade her adieu, \"come back soon to us, my dear boy, for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may not have many years to live.\"  I will not take up my reader's time with a minute account of all that occurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents. Suffice it to say, that my father placed me under the charge of an old mess-mate of his own, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South Seas in his own ship, the Arrow. My mother gave me her blessing and a small Bible; and her last request was, that I would never forget to read a chapter every day, and say my prayers; which I promised, with tears in my eyes, that I would certainly do.  Soon afterwards I went on board the Arrow, which was a fine large ship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.     CHAPTER II.   The departure--The sea--My companions--Some account of the wonderful sights we saw on the great deep--A dreadful storm and a frightful wreck.  It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvass to the breeze, and sailed for the regions of the south. Oh, how my heart bounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors, while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor! The captain shouted--the men ran to obey--the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and the shore gradually faded from my view, while I stood looking on with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.  The first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on deck, and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever, and would require its services no more.  \"There, lass,\" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was completed--\"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we shan't ask you to kiss the mud again for many a long day to come!\"  And so it was. That anchor did not \"kiss the mud\" for many long days afterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!  There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special favourites. Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face. He had had a good education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild and quiet in disposition. Jack was a general favourite, and had a peculiar fondness for me. My other companion was Peterkin Gay. He was little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years old. But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could not have been so much beloved as he was.  \"Hallo! youngster,\" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder, the day I joined the ship, \"come below and I'll show you your berth. You and I are to be mess-mates, and I think we shall be good friends, for I like the look o' you.\"  Jack was right. He and I and Peterkin afterwards became the best and stanchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.  I"]]]
