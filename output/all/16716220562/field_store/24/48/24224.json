Just then a kind of glimmering     Attracting his attention,   The worm became too small a thing     For more than passing mention:   The throng of hungry hens and rude     He skilfully evaded.   Said he, \"I' faith, if this be food,     I saw the prize ere they did.\"    It was a large and costly pearl,     Belonging in a necklace,   And dropped by some neglectful girl:     Some people are so reckless!   The cock assumed an air forlorn,     And cried, \"It's really cruel.   I thought it was a grain of corn:     It's nothing but a jewel.\"    He turned again to where his clan     In one astounding tangle   With eager haste together ran     To slay the helpless angle,   And sighed, \"He was of massive size.     I should have used discretion.   Too late! Around the toothsome prize     A bargain-sale's in session.\"    The worm's remarks upon his plight     Have never been recorded,   But any one may know how slight     Diversion it afforded;   For worms and human beings are     Unanimous that, when pecked,   To be the prey of men they far     Prefer to being hen-pecked.    THE MORAL: When your dinner comes     Don't leave it for your neighbors,   Because you hear the sound of drums     And see the gleam of sabres;   Or, like the cock, you'll find too late     That ornaments external   Do not for certain indicate     A bona fide kernel.            THE ABBREVIATED FOX                 AND        HIS SCEPTICAL COMRADES    A certain fox had a Grecian nose     And a beautiful tail. His friends   Were wont to say in a jesting way     A divinity shaped his ends.   The fact is sad, but his foxship had     A fault we should all eschew:   He was so deceived that he quite believed     What he heard from friends was true.    One day he found in a sheltered spot     A trap with stalwart springs   That was cunningly planned to supply the demand    For some of those tippet things.   The fox drew nigh, and resolved to try     The way that the trap was set:   (When the trap was through with this interview     There was one less tippet to get!)    The fox returned to his doting friends     And said, with an awkward smile,   \"My tail I know was _comme il faut_,     And served me well for a while.\"   When his comrades laughed at his shortage aft     He added, with scornful bow,   \"Pray check your mirth, for I hear from Worth     They're wearing them shorter now.\"    But one of his friends, a bookish chap,     Replied, with a thoughtful frown,   \"You know to-day the publishers say     That the short tale won't go down;   And, upon my soul, I think on the whole,    That the publishers' words are true.   I should hate, good sir, to part my fur     In the middle, as done by you.\"    And another added these truthful words     In the midst of the eager hush,   \"We can part our hair 'most anywhere     So long as we keep the brush.\"    THE MORAL is this: It is never amiss     To treasure the things you've penned:   Preserve your tales, for, when all else fails,     They'll be useful things--in the end.          THE HOSPITABLE CALEDONIAN                 AND          THE THANKLESS VIPER    A Caledonian piper     Who was walking on the wold   Nearly stepped upon a viper     Rendered torpid by the cold;   By the sight of her admonished,     He forbore to plant his boot,   But he showed he was astonished     By the way he muttered \"Hoot!\"    Now this simple-minded piper     Such a kindly nature had   That he lifted up the viper     And bestowed her in his plaid.   \"Though the Scot is stern, at least he     No unhappy creature spurns,   'Sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,'\"     Quoth the piper (quoting Burns).    This was unaffected kindness,     But there was, to state the fact,   Just a slight _soupcon_ of blindness     In his charitable act.   If you'd watched the piper, shortly     You'd have seen him leap aloft,   As this snake, of ways uncourtly,     Bit him suddenly and oft.    There was really no excuse for     This, the viper's cruel work,   And the piper found a use for     Words he'd never learned at kirk;   But the biting was so thorough     That although the doctors tried,   Not the best in Edinburgh     Could assist him, and he died.    And THE MORAL is: The piper     Of the matter made a botch;   One can hardly blame the viper     If she took a nip of Scotch,   For she only did what he did,     And _his_ nippie wasn't small,   Otherwise, you see, he needed     Not have seen the snake at all.            THE IMPETUOUS BREEZE                 AND          THE DIPLOMATIC SUN    A Boston man an ulster had,     An ulster with a cape that fluttered:   It smacked his face, and made him mad,     And polyglot remarks he uttered:       \"I bought it at a bargain,\" said he,       \"I'm tired of the thing already.\"    The wind that chanced to blow that day     Was easterly, and rather strong, too:   It loved to see the galling way     That clothes vex those whom they belong to:       \"Now watch me,\" cried this spell of weather,       \"I'll rid him of it altogether.\"    It whirled the man across the street,     It banged him up against a railing,   It twined the ulster round his feet,     But all of this was unavailing:       For not without resource it found him:       He drew the ulster closer round him.    \"My word!\" the man was heard to say,     \"Although I like not such abuse, it's   Not strange the wind is strong to-day,     It always is in Massachusetts.       Such weather threatens much the health of       Inhabitants this Commonwealth of.\"    The sun, emerging from a rift     Between the clouds, observed the victim,   And how the wind beset and biffed,     Belabored, buffeted, and kicked him.       Said he, \"This wind is doubtless new here:       'Tis quite the freshest ever blew here.\"    And then he put forth all his strength,     His warmth with might and main exerted,   Till upward in its tube at length     The mercury most nimbly spurted.       Phenomenal the curious sight was,       So swift the rise in Fahrenheit was.    The man supposed himself at first     The prey of some new mode of smelting:   His pulses were about to burst,     His every limb seemed slowly melting,       And, as the heat began to numb him,       He cast the ulster wildly from him.    \"Impulsive breeze, the use of force,\"     Observed the sun, \"a foolish act is,   Perceiving which, you see, of course.     How highly efficacious tact is.\"       The wondering wind replied, \"Good gracious!       You're right about the efficacious.\"    THE MORAL deals, as morals do,     With tact, and all its virtues boasted,   But still I can't forget, can you,     That wretched man, first chilled, then roasted?       Bronchitis seized him shortly after,       And that's no cause for vulgar laughter."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/644"],["title","The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (#0)"],["body","HAUNTED MAN AND THE GHOST’S BARGAIN     CHAPTER I The Gift Bestowed   Everybody said so.  Far be it from me to assert that what everybody says must be true. Everybody is, often, as likely to be wrong as right. In the general experience, everybody has been wrong so often, and it has taken, in most instances, such a weary while to find out how wrong, that the authority is proved to be fallible. Everybody may sometimes be right; “but _that’s_ no rule,” as the ghost of Giles Scroggins says in the ballad.  The dread word, GHOST, recalls me.  Everybody said he looked like a haunted man. The extent of my present claim for everybody is, that they were so far right. He did.  Who could have seen his hollow cheek; his sunken brilliant eye; his black-attired figure, indefinably grim, although well-knit and well-proportioned; his grizzled hair hanging, like tangled sea-weed, about his face,—as if he had been, through his whole life, a lonely mark for the chafing and beating of the great deep of humanity,—but might have said he looked like a haunted man?  Who could have observed his manner, taciturn, thoughtful, gloomy, shadowed by habitual reserve, retiring always and jocund never, with a distraught air of reverting to a bygone place and time, or of listening to some old echoes in his mind, but might have said it was the manner of a haunted man?  Who could have heard his voice, slow-speaking, deep, and grave, with a natural fulness and melody in it which he seemed to set himself against and stop, but might have said it was the voice of a haunted man?  Who that had seen him in his inner chamber, part library and part laboratory,—for he was, as the world knew, far and wide, a learned man in chemistry, and a teacher on whose lips and hands a crowd of aspiring ears and eyes hung daily,—who that had seen him there, upon a winter night, alone, surrounded by his drugs and instruments and books; the shadow of his shaded lamp a monstrous beetle on the wall, motionless among a crowd of spectral shapes raised there by the flickering of the fire upon the quaint objects around him; some of these phantoms (the reflection of glass vessels that held liquids), trembling at heart like things that knew his power to uncombine them, and to give back their component parts to fire and vapour;—who that had seen him then, his work done, and he pondering in his chair before the rusted grate and red flame, moving his thin mouth as if in speech, but silent as the dead, would not have said that the man seemed haunted and the chamber too?  Who might not, by a very easy flight of fancy, have believed that everything about him took this haunted tone, and that he lived on haunted ground?  His dwelling was so solitary and vault-like,—an old, retired part of an ancient endowment for students, once a brave edifice, planted in an open place, but now the obsolete whim of forgotten architects; smoke-age-and-weather-darkened, squeezed on every side by the overgrowing of the great city, and choked, like an old well, with stones and bricks; its small quadrangles, lying down in very pits formed by the streets and buildings, which, in course of time, had been constructed above its heavy chimney stacks; its old trees, insulted by the neighbouring smoke, which deigned to droop so low when it was very feeble and the weather very moody; its grass-plots, struggling with the mildewed earth to be grass, or to win any show of compromise; its silent pavements, unaccustomed to the tread of feet, and even to the observation of eyes, except when a stray face looked down from the upper world, wondering what nook it was; its sun-dial in a little bricked-up corner, where no sun had straggled for a hundred years, but where, in compensation for the sun’s neglect, the snow would lie for weeks when it lay nowhere else, and the black east wind would spin like a huge humming-top, when in all other places it was silent and still.  His dwelling, at its heart and core—within doors—at his fireside—was so lowering and old, so crazy, yet so strong, with its worm-eaten beams of wood in the ceiling, and its sturdy floor shelving downward to the great oak chimney-piece; so environed and hemmed in by the pressure of the town yet so remote in fashion, age, and custom; so quiet, yet so thundering with echoes when a distant voice was raised or a door was shut,—echoes, not confined to the many low passages and empty rooms, but rumbling and grumbling till they were stifled in the heavy air of the forgotten Crypt where the Norman arches were half-buried in the earth.  You should have seen him in his dwelling about twilight, in the dead winter time.  When the wind was blowing, shrill and shrewd, with the going down of the blurred sun. When it was just so dark, as that the forms of things were indistinct and big—but not wholly lost. When sitters by the fire began to see wild faces and figures, mountains and abysses, ambuscades and armies, in the coals. When people in the streets bent down their heads and ran before the weather. When those who were obliged to meet it, were stopped at angry corners, stung by wandering snow-flakes alighting on the lashes of their eyes,—which fell too sparingly, and were blown away too quickly, to leave a trace upon the frozen ground. When windows of private houses closed up tight and warm. When lighted gas began to burst forth in the busy and the quiet streets, fast blackening otherwise. When stray pedestrians, shivering along the latter, looked down at the glowing fires in kitchens, and sharpened their sharp appetites by sniffing up the fragrance of whole miles of dinners.  When travellers by land were bitter cold, and looked wearily on gloomy landscapes, rustling and shuddering in the blast. When mariners at sea, outlying upon icy yards, were tossed and swung above the howling ocean dreadfully. When lighthouses, on rocks and headlands, showed solitary and watchful; and benighted sea-birds breasted on against their ponderous lanterns, and fell dead. When little readers of story-books, by the firelight, trembled to think of Cassim Baba cut into quarters, hanging in the Robbers’ Cave, or had some small misgivings that the fierce little old woman, with the crutch, who used to start out of the box in the merchant Abudah’s bedroom, might, one of these nights, be found upon the stairs, in the long, cold, dusky journey up to bed.  When, in rustic places, the last glimmering of daylight died away from the ends of avenues; and the trees, arching overhead, were sullen and black. When, in parks and woods, the high wet fern and sodden moss, and beds of fallen leaves, and trunks of trees, were lost to view, in masses of impenetrable shade. When mists arose from dyke, and fen, and river. When lights in old halls and in cottage windows, were a cheerful sight. When the mill stopped, the wheelwright and the blacksmith shut their workshops, the turnpike-gate closed, the plough and harrow were left lonely in the fields, the labourer and team went home, and the striking of the church clock had a deeper sound than at noon, and the churchyard wicket would be swung no more that night.  When twilight everywhere released the shadows, prisoned up all day, that now closed in and gathered like mustering swarms of ghosts. When they stood lowering, in corners of rooms, and frowned out from behind half-opened doors. When they had full possession of unoccupied apartments. When they danced upon the floors, and walls, and ceilings of inhabited chambers, while the fire was low, and withdrew like ebbing waters when it sprang into a blaze. When they fantastically mocked the shapes of household objects, making the nurse an ogress, the rocking-horse a monster, the wondering child, half-scared and half-amused, a stranger to itself,—the very tongs upon the hearth, a straddling giant with his arms a-kimbo, evidently smelling the blood of Englishmen, and wanting to grind people’s bones to make his bread.  When these shadows brought into the minds of older people, other thoughts, and showed them different images. When they stole from their retreats, in the likenesses of forms and faces from the past, from the grave, from the deep, deep gulf, where the things that might have been, and never were, are always wandering.  When he sat, as already mentioned, gazing at the fire. When, as it rose and fell, the shadows went and came. When he took no heed of them, with his bodily eyes; but, let them come or let them go, looked fixedly at the fire. You should have seen him, then.  When the sounds that had arisen with the shadows, and come out of their lurking-places at the twilight summons, seemed to make a deeper stillness all about him. When the wind was rumbling in the chimney, and sometimes crooning, sometimes howling, in the house. When the old trees outside were so shaken and beaten, that one querulous old rook, unable to sleep, protested now and then, in a feeble, dozy, high-up “Caw!” When, at intervals, the window trembled, the rusty vane upon the turret-top complained, the clock beneath it recorded that another quarter of an hour was gone, or the fire collapsed and fell in with a rattle.  —When a knock came at his door, in short, as he was sitting so, and roused him.  “Who’s that?” said he. “Come in!”  Surely there had been no figure leaning on the back of his chair; no face looking over it. It is certain that no gliding footstep touched the floor, as he lifted up his head, with a start, and spoke. And yet there was no mirror in the room on whose surface his own form could have cast its shadow for a moment; and, Something had passed darkly and gone!  “I’m humbly fearful, sir,” said a fresh-coloured busy man, holding the door open with his foot for the admission of himself and a wooden tray he carried, and letting it go again by very gentle and careful degrees, when he and the tray had got in, lest it should close noisily, “that it’s a good bit past the time to-night.
