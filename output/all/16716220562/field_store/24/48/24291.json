A light and lively air, touched by a hand which seemed to hesitate, like the submissive voice of an inferior, fearing to interrupt his master's meditations, introduced a stanza or two applicable to the subject.  \"And what though thou, O scroll,\" he said, apostrophizing the letter, which lay on the table before his master, \"dost speak with the tongue of the stranger? Hath not the cuckoo a harsh note, and yet she tells us of green buds and springing flowers? What if thy language be that of the stoled priest, is it not the same which binds hearts and hands together at the altar? And what though thou delayest to render up thy treasures, are not all pleasures most sweet, when enhanced by expectation? What were the chase, if the deer dropped at our feet the instant he started from the cover--or what value were there in the love of the maiden, were it yielded without coy delay?\"  The song of the bard was here broken short by the entrance of the priest, who, hasty in obeying the summons of his impatient master, had not tarried to lay aside even the stole, which he had worn in the holy service; and many of the elders thought it was no good omen, that, so habited, a priest should appear in a festive assembly, and amid profane minstrelsy.  The priest opened the letter of the Norman Baron, and, struck with surprise at the contents, lifted his eyes in silence.  \"Read it!\" exclaimed the fierce Gwenwyn.  \"So please you,\" replied the more prudent chaplain, \"a smaller company were a fitter audience.\"  \"Read it aloud!\" repeated the Prince, in a still higher tone; \"there sit none here who respect not the honour of their prince, or who deserve not his confidence. Read it, I say, aloud! and by Saint David, if Raymond the Norman hath dared--\"  He stopped short, and, reclining on his seat, composed himself to an attitude of attention; but it was easy for his followers to fill up the breach in his exclamation which prudence had recommended.  The voice of the chaplain was low and ill-assured as he read the following epistle:--     \"Raymond Berenger, the noble Norman Knight, Seneschal    of the Garde Doloureuse, to Gwenwyn, Prince of Powys,    (may peace be between them!) sendeth health.  \"Your letter, craving the hand of our daughter Eveline Berenger, was safely delivered to us by your servant, Jorworth ap Jevan, and we thank you heartily for the good meaning therein expressed to us and to ours. But, considering within ourselves the difference of blood and lineage, with the impediments and causes of offence which have often arisen in like cases, we hold it fitter to match our daughter among our own people; and this by no case in disparagement of you, but solely for the weal of you, of ourselves, and of our mutual dependants, who will be the more safe from the risk of quarrel betwixt us, that we essay not to draw the bonds of our intimacy more close than beseemeth. The sheep and the goats feed together in peace on the same pastures, but they mingle not in blood, or race, the one with the other. Moreover, our daughter Eveline hath been sought in marriage by a noble and potent Lord of the Marches, Hugo de Lacy, the Constable of Chester, to which most honourable suit we have returned a favourable answer. It is therefore impossible that we should in this matter grant to you the boon you seek; nevertheless, you shall at all times find us, in other matters, willing to pleasure you; and hereunto we call God, and Our Lady, and Saint Mary Magdalene of Quatford, to witness; to whose keeping we heartily recommend you.  \"Written by our command, at our Castle of Garde Doloureuse, within the Marches of Wales, by a reverend priest, Father Aldrovand, a black monk of the house of Wenlock; and to which we have appended our seal, upon the eve of the blessed martyr Saint Alphegius, to whom be honour and glory!\"  The voice of Father Einion faltered, and the scroll which he held in his hand trembled in his grasp, as he arrived at the conclusion of this epistle; for well he knew that insults more slight than Gwenwyn would hold the least word it contained, were sure to put every drop of his British blood into the most vehement commotion. Nor did it fail to do so. The Prince had gradually drawn himself up from the posture of repose in which he had prepared to listen to the epistle; and when it concluded, he sprung on his feet like a startled lion, spurning from him as he rose the foot-bearer, who rolled at some distance on the floor. \"Priest,\" he said, \"hast thou read that accursed scroll fairly? for if thou hast added, or diminished, one word, or one letter, I will have thine eyes so handled, that thou shalt never read letter more!\"  The monk replied, trembling, (for he was well aware that the sacerdotal character was not uniformly respected among the irascible Welshmen,) \"By the oath of my order, mighty prince, I have read word for word, and letter for letter.\"  There was a momentary pause, while the fury of Gwenwyn, at this unexpected affront, offered to him in the presence of all his Uckelwyr, (_i.e._ noble chiefs, literally men of high stature,) seemed too big for utterance, when the silence was broken by a few notes from the hitherto mute harp of Cadwallon. The Prince looked round at first with displeasure at the interruption, for he was himself about to speak; but when he beheld the bard bending over his harp with an air of inspiration, and blending together, with unexampled skill, the wildest and most exalted tones of his art, he himself became an auditor instead of a speaker, and Cadwallon, not the Prince, seemed to become the central point of the assembly, on whom all eyes were bent, and to whom each ear was turned with breathless eagerness, as if his strains were the responses of an oracle.  \"We wed not with the stranger,\"--thus burst the song from the lips of the poet. \"Vortigern wedded with the stranger; thence came the first wo upon Britain, and a sword upon her nobles, and a thunderbolt upon her palace. We wed not with the enslaved Saxon-- the free and princely stag seeks not for his bride the heifer whose neck the yoke hath worn. We wed not with the rapacious Norman--the noble hound scorns to seek a mate from the herd of ravening wolves. When was it heard that the Cymry, the descendants of Brute, the true children of the soil of fair Britain, were plundered, oppressed, bereft of their birthright, and insulted even in their last retreats?--when, but since they stretched their hand in friendship to the stranger, and clasped to their bosoms the daughter of the Saxon? Which of the two is feared?--the empty water-course of summer, or the channel of the headlong winter torrent?--A maiden smiles at the summer-shrunk brook while she crosses it, but a barbed horse and his rider will fear to stem the wintry flood. Men of Mathravel and Powys, be the dreaded flood of winter--Gwenwyn, son of Cyverliock!--may thy plume be the topmost of its waves!\"  All thoughts of peace, thoughts which, in themselves, were foreign to the hearts of the warlike British, passed before the song of Cadwallon like dust before the whirlwind, and the unanimous shout of the assembly declared for instant war. The Prince himself spoke not, but, looking proudly around him, flung abroad his arm, as one who cheers his followers to the attack.  The priest, had he dared, might have reminded Gwenwyn, that the Cross which he had assumed on his shoulder, had consecrated his arm to the Holy War, and precluded his engaging in any civil strife. But the task was too dangerous for Father Einion's courage, and he shrunk from the hall to the seclusion of his own convent. Caradoc, whose brief hour of popularity was past, also retired, with humbled and dejected looks, and not without a glance of indignation at his triumphant rival, who had so judiciously reserved his display of art for the theme of war, that was ever most popular with the audience.  The chiefs resumed their seats no longer for the purpose of festivity, but to fix, in the hasty manner customary among these prompt warriors, where they were to assemble their forces, which, upon such occasions, comprehended almost all the able-bodied males of the country,--for all, excepting the priests and the bards, were soldiers,--and to settle the order of their descent upon the devoted marches, where they proposed to signalize, by general ravage, their sense of the insult which their Prince had received, by the rejection of his suit.     CHAPTER THE THIRD     The sands are number'd, that make up my life;   Here must I stay, and here my life must end.      HENRY VI. ACT. I. SCENE IV.   When Raymond Berenger had despatched his mission to the Prince of Powys, he was not unsuspicious, though altogether fearless, of the result. He sent messengers to the several dependants who held their fiefs by the tenure of _cornage_, and warned them to be on the alert, that he might receive instant notice of the approach of the enemy. These vassals, as is well known, occupied the numerous towers, which, like so many falcon-nests, had been built on the points most convenient to defend the frontiers, and were bound to give signal of any incursion of the Welsh, by blowing their horns; which sounds, answered from tower to tower, and from station to station, gave the alarm for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6490"],["title","The Betrothed (#8)"],["body"," defence. But although Raymond considered these precautions as necessary, from the fickle and precarious temper of his neighbours, and for maintaining his own credit as a soldier, he was far from believing the danger to be imminent; for the preparations of the Welsh; though on a much more extensive scale than had lately been usual, were as secret, as their resolution of war had been suddenly adopted.  It was upon the second morning after the memorable festival of Castell-Coch, that the tempest broke on the Norman frontier. At first a single, long, and keen bugle-blast, announced the approach of the enemy; presently the signals of alarm were echoed from every castle and tower on the borders of Shropshire, where every place of habitation was then a fortress. Beacons were lighted upon crags and eminences, the bells were rung backward in the churches and towns, while the general and earnest summons to arms announced an extremity of danger which even the inhabitants of that unsettled country had not hitherto experienced.  Amid this general alarm, Raymond Berenger, having busied himself in arranging his few but gallant followers and adherents, and taken such modes of procuring intelligence of the enemy's strength and motions as were in his power, at length ascended the watch- tower of the castle, to observe in person the country around, already obscured in several places by the clouds of smoke, which announced the progress and the ravages of the invaders. He was speedily joined by his favourite squire, to whom the unusual heaviness of his master's looks was cause of much surprise, for till now they had ever been blithest at the hour of battle. The squire held in his hand his master's helmet, for Sir Raymond was all armed, saving the head.  \"Dennis Morolt,\" said the veteran soldier, \"are our vassals and liegemen all mustered?\"  \"All, noble sir, but the Flemings, who are not yet come in.\"  \"The lazy hounds, why tarry they?\" said Raymond. \"Ill policy it is to plant such sluggish natures in our borders. They are like their own steers, fitter to tug a plough than for aught that requires mettle.\"  \"With your favour,\" said Dennis, \"the knaves can do good service notwithstanding. That Wilkin Flammock of the Green can strike like the hammers of his own fulling-mill.\"  \"He will fight, I believe, when he cannot help it,\" said Raymond; \"but he has no stomach for such exercise, and is as slow and as stubborn as a mule.\"  \"And therefore are his countrymen rightly matched against the Welsh,\" replied Dennis Morolt, \"that their solid and unyielding temper may be a fit foil to the fiery and headlong dispositions of our dangerous neighbours, just as restless waves are best opposed by steadfast rocks.--Hark, sir, I hear Wilkin Flammock's step ascending the turret-stair, as deliberately as ever monk mounted to matins.\"  Step by step the heavy sound approached, until the form of the huge and substantial Fleming at length issued from the turret-door to the platform where they \"were conversing. Wilkin Flammock was cased in bright armour, of unusual weight and thickness, and cleaned with exceeding care, which marked the neatness of his nation; but, contrary to the custom of the Normans, entirely plain, and void of carving, gilding, or any sort of ornament. The basenet, or steel-cap, had no visor, and left exposed a broad countenance, with heavy and unpliable features, which announced the character of his temper and understanding. He carried in his hand a heavy mace.  \"So, Sir Fleming,\" said the Castellane, \"you are in no hurry, methinks, to repair to the rendezvous.\"  \"So please you,\" answered the Fleming, \"we were compelled to tarry, that we might load our wains with our bales of cloth and other property.\"  \"Ha! wains?--how many wains have you brought with you?\"  \"Six, noble sir,\" replied Wilkin.  \"And how many men?\" demanded Raymond Berenger.  \"Twelve, valiant sir,\" answered Flammock.  \"Only two men to each baggage-wain? I wonder you would thus encumber yourself,\" said Berenger.  \"Under your favour, sir, once more,\" replied Wilkin, \"it is only the value which I and my comrades set upon our goods, that inclines us to defend them with our bodies; and, had we been obliged to leave our cloth to the plundering clutches of yonder vagabonds, I should have seen small policy in stopping here to give them the opportunity of adding murder to robbery. Gloucester should have been my first halting-place.\"  The Norman knight gazed on the Flemish artisan, for such was Wilkin Flammock, with such a mixture of surprise and contempt, as excluded indignation. \"I have heard much,\" he said, \"but this is the first time that I have heard one with a beard on his lip avouch himself a coward.\"  \"Nor do you hear it now,\" answered Flammock, with the utmost composure--\"I am always ready to fight for life and property; and my coming to this country, where they are both in constant danger, shows that I care not much how often I do so. But a sound skin is better than a slashed one, for all that.\"  \"Well,\" said Raymond Berenger, \"fight after thine own fashion, so thou wilt but fight stoutly with that long body of thine. We are like to have need for all that we can do.--Saw you aught of these rascaille Welsh?--have they Gwenwyn's banner amongst them?\"  \"I saw it with the white dragon displayed,\" replied Wilkin; \"I could not but know it, since it was broidered in my own loom.\"  Raymond looked so grave upon this intelligence, that Dennis Morolt, unwilling the Fleming should mark it, thought it necessary to withdraw his attention. \"I can tell thee,\" he said to Flammock, \"that when the Constable of Chester joins us with his lances, you shall see your handiwork, the dragon, fly faster homeward than ever flew the shuttle which wove it.\"  \"It must fly before the Constable comes up, Dennis Morolt,\" said Berenger, \"else it will fly triumphant over all our bodies.\"  \"In the name of God and the Holy Virgin!\" said Dennis, \"what may you mean, Sir Knight?--not that we should fight with the Welsh before the Constable joins us?\"--He paused, and then, well understanding the firm, yet melancholy glance, with which his master answered the question, he proceeded, with yet more vehement earnestness--\"You cannot mean it--you cannot intend that we shall quit this castle, which we have so often made good against them, and contend in the field with two hundred men against thousands?-- Think better of it, my beloved master, and let not the rashness of your old age blemish that character for wisdom and warlike skill, which your former life has so nobly won.\"  \"I am not angry with you for blaming my purpose, Dennis,\" answered the Norman, \"for I know you do it in love to me and mine. But, Dennis Morolt, this thing must be--we must fight the Welshmen within these three hours, or the name of Raymond Berenger must be blotted from the genealogy of his house.\"  \"And so we will--we will fight them, my noble master,\" said the esquire; \"fear not cold counsel from Dennis Morolt, where battle is the theme. But we will fight them under the walls of the castle, with honest Wilkin Flammock and his crossbows on the wall to protect our flanks, and afford us some balance against the numerous odds.\"  \"Not so, Dennis,\" answered his master--\"In the open field we must fight them, or thy master must rank but as a mansworn knight. Know, that when I feasted yonder wily savage in my halls at Christmas, and when the wine was flowing fastest around, Gwenwyn threw out some praises of the fastness and strength of my castle, in a manner which intimated it was these advantages alone that had secured me in former wars from defeat and captivity. I spoke in answer, when I had far better been silent; for what availed my idle boast, but as a fetter to bind me to a deed next to madness? If, I said, a prince of the Cymry shall come in hostile fashion before the Garde Doloureuse, let him pitch his standard down in yonder plain by the bridge, and, by the word of a good knight, and the faith of a Christian man, Raymond Berenger will meet him as willingly, be he many or be he few, as ever Welshman was met withal.\"  Dennis was struck speechless when he heard of a promise so rash, so fatal; but his was not the casuistry which could release his master from the fetters with which his unwary confidence had bound him. It was otherwise with Wilkin Flammock. He stared--he almost laughed, notwithstanding the reverence due to the Castellane, and his own insensibility to risible emotions. \"And is this all?\" he said. \"If your honour had pledged yourself to pay one hundred florins to a Jew or to a Lombard, no doubt you must have kept the day, or forfeited your pledge; but surely one day is as good as another to keep a promise for fighting, and that day is best in which the promiser is strongest. But indeed, after all, what signifies any promise over a wine flagon?\"  \"It signifies as much as a promise can do that is given elsewhere. The promiser,\" said Berenger, \"escapes not the sin of a word- breaker, because he hath been a drunken braggart.\"  \"For the sin,\" said Dennis, \"sure I am, that rather than you should do such a deed of dole, the Abbot of Glastonbury would absolve you for a florin.\"  \"But what shall wipe out the shame?\" demanded Berenger--\"how shall I dare to show myself again among press of knights, who have broken my word of battle pledged, for fear of a Welshman and his naked savages? No! Dennis Morolt, speak on it no more. Be it for weal or wo, we fight them to-day, and upon yonder fair field.\"  \"It may be,\" said Flammock, \"that Gwenwyn may have forgotten the promise, and so fail to appear to claim it in the appointed space; for, as we heard, your wines of France flooded his Welsh brains deeply.\"  \"He again alluded to it on the morning after it was made,\" said the Castellane--\"trust me, he will not forget what will give him such a chance of removing me from his path for ever.\"  As he spoke, they observed that large clouds of dust, which had"]]]
