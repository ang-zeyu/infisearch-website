He realizes your feelings as well as I do, in spite of his apparent gruffness.  The cool air will do you good.\"  \"If you will be so kind, I am sure we shall appreciate it,\" said Frank.  The lieutenant left the cabin.  Frank, espying something at one end of the room, walked over to investigate.  He came back to Jack, holding something gingerly in his hand.  \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed.  \"What is it?\" asked Jack.  Frank held the object up before his friend's eyes.  \"Look at it!\" he exclaimed.  \"Do you know what it is?\"  Jack took a long look and then stepped suddenly back, exclaiming:  \"Put it down, quick!  Do you want to blow us all up?\"  \"What do you suppose it's doing here?\" asked Frank, still holding the object out at arm's length.  \"How should I know?  But I suppose all submarines carry them.  I have heard that many have been planted by submarines.\"  For the object that Frank held in his hand was a small melinite floating mine!  \"I suppose this would blow any ship to kingdom come, wouldn't it?\" asked the lad.  \"I should say it would; so you had better put it down unless you want to send us all there.\"  Frank leaned close to his chum, and whispered rapidly:  \"See if you can't find a gun around before the lieutenant comes back.  Quick!  A revolver, rifle, or anything!\"  \"What for?\" demanded Jack, in surprise.  \"Never mind what, for.  Look quick, while I hide this thing under my coat.\"  Without knowing what Frank had on his mind, Jack did as requested.  After rummaging through the lieutenant's desk, he at last straightened up with a heavy revolver in his hand.  \"Will this do?\" he asked.  \"All right,\" replied Frank, \"but a rifle would be safer.\"  \"Safer?  What do you mean?\"  \"Sh-h-h,\" whispered Frank.  Footsteps were heard on the outside.  Jack hastily shoved the revolver into his pocket.  Frank by this time had concealed his explosive under his coat.  It bulged out a bit, but the lad folded his arms in front of him, and the bulge was not noticeable.  Lieutenant Stein entered the room.  \"It's all right,\" he said. \"Captain Von Cromp has given his consent.  If you wish, I will conduct you up.\"  \"Thanks,\" said Jack, and the two lads followed the officer. Captain Von Cromp was on the bridge when the two boys emerged from below, and he walked over to them.  \"I regret,\" he said, \"that you should have had to witness what you have; but it is the fortune of war, you know.\"  \"I have heard that before,\" said Frank dryly.  \"Tell me, would you have blamed us had we put up a more stubborn fight below a while ago?\"'  \"No,\" was the reply.  \"I could blame you for nothing you did to an enemy in time of war and especially under such a stress of excitement.\"  Lieutenant Stein bade the boys good-night and went below.  After some further talk, Captain Von Cromp followed him, and the boys were left alone on the submarine, save for the single man on look out.  Frank walked up to the latter and engaged him lit conversation. A few moments later he turned Away, saying to the sailor that he and his friend \"would take a turn or two about before going below.\"  Walking swiftly up to Jack, Frank said in a low voice:  \"See if you can't find that small boat they used to pick us up.\"  \"What--?\" began Jack, but Frank interrupted him.  \"Never mind the reason,\" he said.  \"Help me find it, that's all. We'll have to hurry.  Where do you suppose they put it?\"  A few moments later they came upon the little craft, now above water, placed where the sea could not reach it when the submarine was submerged.  Luckily it was out of view of the German on the bridge, and the two lads succeeded in unloosening it and getting it overboard without being seen.  Then Frank walked quickly back to the spot where the periscope protruded from below.  Opening his coat he took the explosive out and, drawing a handkerchief from his pocket, tied it to the diminutive mine and hung the latter on the tube.  \"Now for this German,\" he said to himself.  \"It wouldn't do for him to see that before I am ready.\"  He approached the man once more and asked several questions.  \"Well,\" he said finally, \"I guess I shall have to say good-night.\"  The German's reply was choked in his throat.  Frank sprang forward, flung one arm around the man's, neck, and with the other clutched him by the throat, to prevent an outcry.  Then he freed one arm and struck out heavily.  The German fell without a murmur.  Frank ran across the deck to where he had left Jack.  \"Into the boat quick!\" he exclaimed.  Jack needed no further urging.  Frank dropped lightly in after him, and soon they were rowing rapidly away.  \"Give me that gun,\" said Frank after they had pulled some distance from the submarine.  \"What are you going to do with it?\" asked Jack.  \"I'll show you,\" replied Frank grimly.  \"Give me the gun!\"  Without another word Jack passed the weapon to his friend.  \"Now,\" said Frank, \"lower yourself over the side of the boat and when I say dive, dive!\"  \"See here,\" said Jack, taking Frank by the arm. \"Have you gone crazy?  What do you think you are going to do?\"  \"I don't think anything about it,\" replied Frank, more quietly now.  \"I know what I am going to do.\"  \"Well, what is it then?  Out with it.\"  \"Do you see that object hanging to the periscope tube on the submarine?\" asked Frank.  \"Yes, I see it.  Why?\"  \"Don't you know what it is?\"  \"No; what is it?\"  \"Well, that's the little plaything I found in Lieutenant Stein's cabin.  I'm going to bore a little hole through it with this gun you were kind enough to get for me.\"  \"Good Heavens!\" exclaimed Jack  \"You'll blow tip the submarine with all on board!\"  \"My idea exactly,\" replied Frank carefully.  \"But--\" protested Jack.  \"The fortune of war, you know,\" said Frank, with some sarcasm. \"You heard Captain Von Cromp say he wouldn't blame us for anything we might do.  Besides, they didn't give the poor fellows on that British battleship any warning, did they?\"  \"No,\" said Jack, \"but--\"  \"Well, there are no buts here.  You climb overboard and get ready to dive.  When this bullet goes through that little plaything there will be an explosion that will kick up considerable excitement hereabouts.  That's why I asked you if you couldn't get a rifle.  We could have gone a little farther away then.\"  \"Now see here,\" said Jack.  \"I guess those fellows have it coming to them.  They don't deserve any better than they will get.  As you say, 'the fortune of war.'  I'm not kicking about that.  What I want to know is if you can hit that thing.\"  \"Hit it?  Of course I can hit it.  You dive when I say the word, and when you come up, if you do, come up, I'll guarantee you won't see any submarine.\"  \"But how about you?\" demanded Jack.  \"If I dive before you fire, how are you going to get away before the explosion?\"  \"I don't calculate I'll get away before it, but I'll be in the water the minute I fire.  I won't wait to see whether I hit it or not.  However, I'll drop the revolver in the boat, so in case I miss the first time, it will be dry enough to use again.\"  \"But--\" began Jack.  Frank stood up in the boat and pointed the revolver directly at the submarine.  \"No more words,\" he said quietly. \"Are you ready?\"  Jack lowered himself over the edge of the boat, still holding to it with his hands.  \"Yes, I'm ready,\" he said, \"but--\"  \"Then dive!\" cried Frank and pulled the trigger.  With a single movement he dropped the revolver into the bottom of the boat, and plunged deep into the sea himself.      CHAPTER VII  OFF ON A LONG CRUISE  At the very instant the lad disappeared beneath the water there was a flash of fire above the submarine, followed by a violent explosion-fearful, terrific.  The upper work of X-9 was blown high into the air and came down in splinters, scattered to the four winds of heaven.  The deck was rent and open up with a great, yawning scam, through which the ocean rushed, driving the craft below the waves as though it had been drawn down by some mighty whirlpool.  A minute later, where had been one of Germany's most terrible fighters, there was only a seething flood of water covered with floating wreckage.  The force of the explosion sent the water spouting high in the air like giant gushers.  The sea boiled and lashed out angrily at what was left of the German craft.  Not a living figure was to be seen upon the wreckage.  The deadly melinite had done its work.  Beneath the waters of the North Sea, where Frank and Jack had sought what shelter they could, the water tossed them about at will, in spite of their frantic efforts to hold themselves steady and remain below the surface.  Frank, not having time to take such a long breath as Jack, because of the suddenness with which he had dived, was the first to come to the surface.  He was tossed high on the still angry waves, but by a Herculean effort, the lad managed to keep his head above water.  His first thought was of the small boat he had so recently left. Glancing around, he saw it floating, bottom up, about a hundred yards away.  He swam rapidly toward it; and as he hurried along, a head suddenly bobbed up directly in front of him.  It was Jack, struggling and gasping.  Frank swam rapidly to him, and lent what assistance he could.  Soon Jack was swimming easily with his friend toward the little upturned boat.  They laid hold of the little craft, and after a struggle, succeeded in righting it and clambering aboard, where they sat down, wet and weak,  Then, for the first time, Jack turned his eyes toward the spot where so short a time ago had been the German submarine.  He saw the mass of floating wreckage.  \"Gone,\" he said simply, \"and the poor fellows with it.\"  He turned to Frank.  \"You certainly did a good job.  I never knew that you were so handy with a gun.\"  \"I am a pretty fair shot,\" Frank admitted modestly.  \"But if you had missed the first time--?\" began Jack.  \"I couldn't miss,\" replied Frank quietly.  \"I knew that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6337"],["title","The Boy Allies under Two Flags (#6)"],["body"," I pulled the trigger.  Some way, I felt certain the bullet would go true.  Why, I hardly even aimed.\"  \"Well,\" said Jack, \"I'm sure I don't ever want you blazing away at me.\"  \"I guess we might as well get away from this spot,\" said Frank. \"I wonder where we are?\"  Jack stood up in the boat and looked long across the sea.  Dawn was just breaking, and in the faint morning light he could see a considerable distance.  \"No land in sight,\" he said finally, and sat down again.  \"At a guess, though, I should say we must still be off the coast of Holland.\"  \"Yes; but how are we going to tell which way the coast of Holland is?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know.  We'll just have to take a chance at it till the sun comes up, and then we can get our bearings.  We'll have to be very careful though, for there are likely to be mines floating about.  If we had some oars we could row a bit it would warm us up.\"  But no oars were in sight, either near the boat or among the floating wreckage.  \"They must be at the bottom of the sea,\" said Frank, in some despair.  \"I should have thought to have made them fast.\"  \"Never mind that,\" said Jack.  \"The question now is, what are we going to do?\"  \"Well, you know as much about it as I do,\" replied Frank.  \"What are we going to do?\"'  \"It looks to me as though we should have to drift and take a chance of being, picked up,\" returned Jack.  \"Or be blown up by a floating mine,\" said Frank.  \"That's a chance we shall have to take,\" said Jack calmly.  \"You should have thought of that before you bored a hole through that mine on the submarine.\"  Frank did not reply.  At length he rose to his feet and took off his coat.  Then he turned to Jack.  \"Give me yours,\" he said briefly.  Jack obeyed without question.  Tying the two coats securely together, Frank loosened one of the thwarts in the little boat.  He pulled some strong string from his pocket and soon had improvised a little sail.  Then tying one sleeve to a cleat on one side and another sleeve to a cleat on the other he soon had his sail bellying before the stiff breeze.  \"It's pretty low,\" he said, leaning back and surveying his work, \"but it may move us along a little.\"  \"How do we know we are going in the right direction?\" asked Jack.  \"We don't; but we might as well be moving as to stay here.  We'll let her have her head and keep her steady as she goes.\"  Slowly the little craft, before the freshening wind began to make headway.  \"This does beat lying still,\" said Jack.  \"I don't believe I would have thought of rigging up such a sail as that.\"  \"I guess you would if I hadn't,\" replied Frank.  \"Now you try and take a little snooze, while I keep a lookout for a vessel of some kind.\"  \"All right; only, you wake me up in a couple of hours and I'll stand watch.\"  Frank agreed to this, and Jack rolled over in the bottom of the boat, where, in spite of his wet clothing and the chilling wind, he was soon fast asleep.  He was completely exhausted, and any kind of a bed would have felt good to him right then.  Frank, holding the rudder of the boat, sat silent, with his eyes scanning the distant horizon for the sign of a ship.  But his watch was vain.  Not even the smoke of a patrolling vessel did he see in the distance.  His two hours of watch up, he shook Jack vigorously.  The latter was up in an instant, and soon Frank was occupying his place in the bottom of the boat.  For an hour Jack scanned the horizon without making out a ship; then, directly ahead, he saw a cloud of smoke.  \"Must be a ship!\" he muttered to himself, and turned to arouse Frank.  Then he drew back, muttering: \"No, there is no need to wake him!  He's tired out.  \"Besides, the ship may not sight us, in which case he would be bitterly disappointed.\"  Slowly the cloud of smoke grew larger, until at length Jack was certain that the vessel was bearing down on them.  As it drew closer, he saw that the approaching ship was a cruiser; and as it drew still closer, that it was British.  Then he bent over and aroused Frank.  \"Look!\" he said, pointing across the water, \"what do you think of that?\"  Frank was wide awake in an instant  \"A British cruiser,\" he ejaculated, \"and coming right toward us. If she keeps on her course we are sure to be seen.\"  Frank sprang to the little sail and tore it down.  Then each lad picked up a coat, and standing at his full height, waved the garment and yelled lustily.  For some moments this was unrewarded.  Then the boys saw signs of excitement aboard the cruiser, and a big gun boomed--  \"She's seen us!\" cried Frank, and dropped into a seat, laughing happily.  Both lads watched silently the oncoming cruiser.  \"Can you make her out?\" asked Frank at length.  Jack rose and looked sharply across the water.  \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"She is the Cumberland.\"  A small boat was lowered from the cruiser and put off toward them.  Soon it scraped alongside the boys' craft, and they were taken aboard where they were received with expressions of great surprise, both by the officer in command and by members of the boat's crew.  \"How did you get away out here?\" asked the surprised boatswain.  Briefly Jack explained.  \"By Jove!\" exclaimed the officer when the lad had concluded his story.  \"You certainly have seen excitement.  And so you blew up the German submarine?\"  \"My friend here did,\" replied Jack, indicating Frank.  \"Sure,\" said the boatswain, \"Captain Marcus will be glad to hear the yarn.  It's a good one you can spin.\"  The little boat now drew up against the cruise and quickly all clambered aboard.  As Jack came over the rail, a man of great height--fully six feet five inches--greeted him.  He was smooth-faced and ruddy, and the fane-anchor on his collar proclaimed him captain.  \"Captain Marcus?\" queried Jack, as he leaped to the deck.  \"At your service,\" came the reply in a hearty sailor-like voice.  \"I am Lieutenant Jack Templeton, scout cruiser Sylph, sir,\" said Jack, \"and this,\" turning to Frank, \"is Lieutenant Frank Chadwick of the same vessel.\"  \"What are you doing in a dingy in the middle of the North Sea?\" demanded the captain.  Briefly once more Jack explained.  \"The Sylph sunk!\" exclaimed Captain Marcus.  \"And what of my old friend Lord Hastings?\"  \"Gone down with his ship, sir,\" replied Jack, Patiently.  \"Hastings dead!\" cried the commander of the Cumberland.  \"It is impossible!\"  \"No, sir,\" said Frank.  \"It is true.\"  For a moment the commander bowed his head in reverence.  Then he raised his eyes and looked at the boys.  \"He was my very good friend,\" he said simply, and motioned the boys to follow him below.  Inside the cabin of the commander of the Cumberland, the captain motioned the lads to seats.  \"Now we shall see what is to be done with   you,\" he said.  \"At present, because of the loss of the Sylph, you are, of course, unattached.  How would you like to go with me?\"  \"Where to, sir?\" asked Jack.  \"I'll explain,\" replied the captain.  \"Until yesterday the Cumberland was one of the blockading fleet off Heligoland.  You can understand, therefore, that I have already heard of you lads. I have been ordered to patrol the west coast of Africa, and, if I mistake not, there will be fighting.  I have recently lost two of my midshipmen through illness.  You may have their places.  What do you say?\"  Both lads had taken a great liking to Captain Marcus at first sight, but it was Jack who made answer for both:  \"Thank you, sir. We shall be glad to go with you.\"      CHAPTER VIII  PATROLLING THE SOUTH SEA  The boys learned from Captain Marcus that they had reckoned rightly and that at the moment they were off the port of Amsterdam, Holland.  \"Our course,\" the captain explained, \"will take us through the English channel into the Atlantic, thence south to the African coast.  How far south we shall go, I cannot say at present.\"  He called a midshipman to show the boys to the cabin which was to be their quarters while on the Cumberland.  It was very comfortable, but not much like the one they had aboard the Sylph. \"However,\" said Jack, \"it's plenty good enough for anyone.\"  For several days the boys were not assigned to duty, Captain Marcus declaring that they needed, a chance to rest up after their strenuous experience with the submarine.  He introduced them to all the officers, with whom they speedily became favorites.  It was very evident to both the boys that their relationship to Lord Hastings was well known to Captain Marcus and they felt that the many little favors shown them was because of this.  They frequently talked of their former commander and friend and their hearts were sad at his untimely end.  In spite of their new surroundings, the days that they sailed southward were somewhat monotonous, and the boys were more than pleased when the Cumberland put into Lisbon, Portugal, for coal. Here they were given a day ashore and bought a number of things that they greatly needed as all their effects had gone down with the Sylph.  Continuing her journey, the Cumberland sailed south through and past the Tropic of Cancer, almost to the equator, without a sign of an enemy.  It was in fact just a day's sail from the equator before the Cumberland sighted another ship.  Quickly the wireless was put to working and it was found that the approaching vessel was the small British cruiser Dwarf.  The cruisers came to anchor a short distance apart and the commanders of the two ships exchanged visits.  Upon Captain Marcus' return aboard the Cumberland, both ships immediately got under way, the Dwarf taking the lead.  \"Something up!\" said Jack to Frank, as they stood leaning over the rail.  \"You are right,\" replied Frank, \"and I'll bet you a little red apple I can tell you what it is.\"  \"You can?\" exclaimed Jack in surprise.  \"Let's have it then.\"  \"In my spare moments,\" explained Frank, \"I have been making a study of the maps and charts.  We are now almost in the Gulf of Guinea.  A small but nevertheless very deep, river called the Cameroon, empties into the gulf.  Do you"]]]
