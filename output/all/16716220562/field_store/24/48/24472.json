No explanation, and the p'lice say there aren't any clues.\"  He twisted at a little black mustache and began to hum.  \"Know where Ranjoor Singh is by any chance?\" asked Kirby.  \"Give me three guesses--no, two. One--he's raising hell with all the police in Delhi. Two--he's at the scene of the murder, doing detective work on his own. I heard he'd driven away--and, anyhow, it's his squadron. Man's probably his second cousin, twenty or thirty times removed.\"  \"Send somebody to find him!\" ordered Kirby.  \"Say you want to have a word with him?\"  Kirby nodded, and Warrington swaggered out, humming to himself exactly as he hoped to be humming when his last grim call should come, the incarnation of efficiency, awake and very glad. A certain number of seconds after he had gone two mounted troopers clattered out toward the bazaar. Ten minutes later Warrington returned.  \"D Squadron's squattin' on its hunkers in rings an' lookin' gloomy,\" he said, as if he were announcing some good news that had a touch of humor in it. \"By the look of 'em you'd say they'd been passed over for active service and were meditatin' matrimony.\"  \"By gad, Warrington! You don't know how near that guess is to the truth!\"  Kirby's lips were smiling, but his voice was hard. Warrington glanced quickly at him once and then looked serious.  \"You mean--\"  \"Yes,\" said Kirby.  \"Has it broken yet?\"  \"No.\"  \"Is it goin' to break?\"  \"Looks like it. Looks to me as if it's all been prearranged. Our crowd are sparring for time, and the Prussians are all in a hurry. Looks that way to me.\"  \"And you mean--there's a chance--even a chance of us--of Outram's Own bein' out of it? Beg your pardon, sir, but are you serious?\"  \"Yes,\" said Kirby, and Warrington's jaw fell.  \"Any details that are not too confidential for me to know?\" asked Warrington.  \"Tell you all about it after I've had a word with Ranjoor Singh.\"  \"Hadn't I better go and help look for him?\"  \"Yes, if you like.\"  So, within another certain number of split seconds, Captain Charlie Warrington rode, as the French say, belly-to-the-earth, and the fact that the monsoon chose that instant to let pour another Noah's deluge seemed to make no difference at all to his ardor or the pace to which he spurred his horse.  An angry police officer grumbled that night at the club about the arrogance of all cavalrymen, but of one Warrington in particular.  \"Wanted to know, by the Big Blue Bull of Bashan, whether I knew when a case was serious or not! Yes, he did! Seemed to think the murder of one sowar was the only criminal case in all Delhi, and had the nerve to invite me to set every constable in what he termed my parish on the one job. What did I say? Told him to call to-morrow, of course--said I'd see. Gad! You should have heard him swear then--thought his eyes 'ud burn holes in my tunic. Went careering out of the office as if war had been declared.\"  \"Talking of war,\" said somebody, nursing a long drink under the swinging punkah, \"do you suppose--\"  So the manners of India's pet cavalry were forgotten at once in the vortex of the only topic that had interest for any one in clubdom, and it was not noticed whether Warrington or his colonel, or any other officer of native cavalry looked in at the club that night.         *       *       *       *       *  Warrington rode into the rain at the same speed at which he had galloped to the police station, overhauled one of the mounted troopers whom he himself had sent in search of Ranjoor Singh, rated him soundly in Punjabi for loafing on the way, and galloped on with the troop-horse laboring in his wake. He reined in abreast of the second trooper, who had halted by a cross-street and was trying to appear to enjoy the deluge.  \"Any word?\" asked Warrington.  \"I spoke with two who said he entered by that door-that small door down the passage, sahib, where there is no light. It is a teak door, bolted and with no keyhole on the outside.\"  \"Good for you,\" said Warrington, glancing quickly up and down the wet street, where the lamps gleamed deceptively in pools of running water. There seemed nobody in sight; but that is a bold guess in Delhi, where the shadows all have eyes.  He gave a quiet order, and trooper number one passed his reins to number two.  \"Go and try that door. Kick it in if you can--but be quick, and try not to be noisy!\"  The trooper swung out of the saddle and obeyed, while Warrington and the other man faced back to back, watching each way against surprise. In India, as in lands less \"civilized,\" the cavalry are not allowed to usurp the functions of police, and the officer or man who tries it does so at his own risk. There came a sound of sudden thundering on teak that ceased after two minutes.  \"The door is stout. There is no answer from within,\" said the trooper.  \"Then wait here on foot,\" commanded Warrington. \"Get under cover and watch. Stay here until you're relieved, unless something particularly worth reporting happens; in that case, hurry and report. For instance\"--he hesitated, trying to imagine something out of the unimaginable--\"suppose the risaldar-major were to come out, then give him the message and come home with him. But--oh, suppose the place takes fire, or there's a riot, or you hear a fight going on inside--then hurry to barracks--understand?\"  The wet trooper nodded and saluted.  \"Get into a shadow, then, and keep as dry as you can,\" ordered Warrington. \"Come on!\" he called to the other man.  And a second later he was charging through the street as if he rode with despatches through a zone of rifle fire. Behind him clattered a rain-soaked trooper and two horses.  Colonel Kirby stepped out of his bathroom just as Warrington arrived, and arranged his white dress-tie before the sitting-room mirror.  \"Looks fishy to me, sir,\" said Warrington, hurrying in and standing where the rain from his wet clothes would do least harm.  There was a space on the floor between two tiger-skins where the matting was a little threadbare. Messengers, orderlies or servants always stood on that spot. After a moment, however, Kirby's servant brought Warrington a bathroom mat.  \"How d'ye mean?\"  Warrington explained.  \"What did the police say?\"  \"Said they were busy.\"  \"Now, I could go to the club,\" mused Kirby, \"and see Hetherington, and have a talk with him, and get him to sign a search-warrant. Armed with that, we could--\"  \"Perhaps persuade a police officer to send two constables with it to-morrow morning!\" said Warrington, with a grin.  \"Yes,\" said Kirby.  \"And if we do much on our own account we'll fall foul of the Indian Penal Code, which altereth every week,\" said Warrington.  \"If it weren't for the fact that I particularly want a word with him,\" said Kirby, giving a last tweak to his tie and reaching out for his mess-jacket that the servant had laid on a chair, \"there'd not be much ground that I can see for action of any kind. He has a right to go where he likes.\"  That point of view did not seem to have occurred to Warrington before; nor did he quite like it, for he frowned.  \"On the other hand,\" said Kirby, diving into his mess-jacket and shrugging his neat shoulders until they fitted into it as a charger fits into his skin, \"under the circumstances--and taking into consideration certain private information that has reached me--if I were supposed to be behind a bolted door in the bazaar, I'd rather appreciate it if Ranjoor Singh, for instance, were to--ah--take action of some kind.\"  \"Exactly, sir.\"  \"Hallo--what's that?\"         *       *       *       *       *  A motor-car, driven at racing speed, thundered up the lane between the old stacked cannon and came to a panting standstill by the colonel's outer door. A gruff question was answered gruffly, and a man's step sounded on the veranda. Then the servant flung the door wide, and a British soldier stepped smartly into the room, saluted and held out a telegram.  Kirby tore it open. His eyes blazed, but his hands were steady. The soldier held out a receipt book and a pencil, and Kirby took time to scribble his initials in the proper place. Warrington, humming to himself, began to squeeze the rain out of his tunic to hide impatience. The soldier saluted, faced about and hurried to the waiting car. Then Kirby read the telegram. He nodded to Warrington. Warrington, his finger-ends pressed tight into his palms and his forearms quivering, raised one eyebrow.  \"Yes,\" said Kirby.  \"War, sir?\"  \"War.\"  \"We're under orders?\"  \"Not yet. It says, 'War likely to be general. Be ready.' Here, read it for yourself.\"  \"They wouldn't have sent us that if--\"  \"Addressed to O.C. troops. They had those ready written out and sent one to every O.C. on the list the second they knew.\"  \"Well, sir?\"  \"Leave the room, Lal Singh!\"  The servant, who was screwing up his courage to edge nearer, did as he was told.  Kirby stood still, facing the mirror, with both arms behind him.  \"They're certain to send native Indian troops to Europe,\" he said.  \"We're ready, sir! We're ready to a shoe-string! We'll go first!\"  \"We'll be last, Warrington, supposing we go at all, unless we find Ranjoor Singh! They'll send us to do police work in Bengal, or to guard the Bombay docks and watch the other fellows go. I'm going to the club. You'd better come with me. Hurry into dry clothes.\" He glanced at the clock. \"We'll just have time to drive past the house where you say he's supposed to be, if you hurry.\"  The last three words were lost, for Captain Warrington had turned into a thunderbolt and disappeared; the noise of his going was as when a sudden windstorm slams all the doors at once. A moment later he could be heard shouting from outside his quarters to his servant to be ready for him.  He certainly bathed, for the noise of the tub overturning when he was done with it was unmistakable. And eight minutes after his departure he was back again, dressed, cloaked and ready.  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6751"],["title","The Winds of the World (#8)"],["body","your pistol, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" said Kirby.  \"Thought I'd bring mine along. You never know, you know.\"  Together they climbed into the colonel's dog-cart, well smothered under waterproofs. Kirby touched up another of his road-devouring walers, the sais grabbed at the back seat and jumped for his life, and they shot out of the compound, down the line of useless cannon and out into the street, taking the corner as the honor of the regiment required. Then the two big side-lamps sent their shafts of light straight down the metaled, muddy road, and the horse settled down between them to do his equine \"demdest\"; there was a touch on the reins he recognized.         *       *       *       *       *  They reached the edge of the bazaar to find the crowd stirring, although strangely mute.  \"They'll have got the news in an hour from now,\" said Kirby. \"They can smell it already.\"  \"Wonder how much truth there is in all this talk about German merchants and propaganda.\"  \"_H-rrrrr-ummm_!\" said Kirby.  \"Steady, sir! Lookout!\"  The near wheel missed a native woman by a fraction of an inch, and her shrill scream followed them. But Kirby kept his eyes ahead, and the shadows continued to flash by them in a swift procession until Warrington leaned forward, and then Kirby leaned back against the reins.  \"There he is, sir!\"  They reined to a halt, and a drenched trooper jumped up behind to kneel on the back seat and speak in whispers.  \"No sign of him at all?\" asked Kirby.  \"No, sahib. But there has been a light behind a shutter above there. It comes and goes. They light it and extinguish it.\"  \"Has anybody come out of that door?\"  \"No, sahib.\"  \"None gone in?\"  \"None.\"  \"Any other door to the place?\"  \"There may be a dozen, sahib. That is an old house, and it backs up against six others.\"  \"What we suffer from in this country is information,\" said Warrington, beginning to hum to himself.  But Kirby signed to the trooper, and the man began to scramble out of the cart.  \"Between now and our return, report to the club if anything happens,\" called Warrington.  The whip swished, the horse shot forward, and they were off again as if they would catch up with the hurrying seconds. People scattered to the right and left in front of them; a constable at a street crossing blew his whistle frantically; once the horse slipped in a deep puddle, and all but came to earth; but they reached the club without mishap and drove up the winding drive at a speed more in keeping with convention.  \"Oh, hallo, Kirby! Glad you've come!\" said a voice.  \"Evening, sir!\"  Kirby descended, almost into the arms of a general in evening dress. They walked into the club together, leaving the adjutant wondering what to do. He decided to follow them at a decent distance, still humming and looking happy enough for six men.  \"You'll be among the first,\" said the general. \"Are you ready, Kirby--absolutely ready?\"  \"Yes,\"  \"The wires are working to the limit. It isn't settled yet whether troops go from here via Canada or the Red Sea--probably won't be until the Navy's had a chance to clear the road. All that's known--yet--is that Belgium's invaded, and that every living man Jack who can be hurried to the front in time to keep the Germans out of Paris will be sent. Hold yourself ready to entrain any minute, Kirby.\"  \"Is martial law proclaimed yet?\" asked Kirby in a voice that the general seemed to think was strained, for he looked around sharply.  \"Not yet. Why?\"  \"Information, sir. Anything else?\"  \"No. Good night.\"  \"Good night, sir.\"  Kirby nearly ran into Warrington as he hurried back toward the door.  \"Find a police officer!\" he ordered.  \"They all passed you a minute ago, sir,\" answered Warrington. \"They're headed for police headquarters. Heard one of 'em say so.\"  Kirby pulled himself together. A stranger would not have noticed that he needed it, but Warrington at his elbow saw the effort and was glad.  \"Go to police headquarters, then,\" he ordered. \"Try to get them to bring a dozen men and search, that house; but don't say that Ranjoor Singh's in there.\"  \"Where'll I find you, sir?\"  \"Barracks. Oh, by the way, we're a sure thing for the front.\"  \"I knew there was some reason why I kept feelin' cheerful!\" said Warrington. \"The risaldar-major looks like gettin' left.\"  \"Unless,\" said Kirby, \"you can get the police to act to-night--or unless martial law's proclaimed at once, and I can think of an excuse to search the house with a hundred men myself. Find somebody to give you a lift. So long.\"  Kirby swung into his dog-cart, the sais did an acrobatic turn behind, and again the horse proceeded to lower records. Zigzag-wise, through streets that were growing more and yet more thronged instead of silent, they tore barrackward, missing men by a miracle every twelve yards. Kirby's eyes were on a red blotch, now, that danced and glowed above the bazaar a mile ahead. It reminded him of pain.  Presently the horse sniffed smoke, and notified as much before settling down into his stride again. The din of hoarse excitement reached Kirby's ears, and in a moment more a khaki figure leaped out of a shadow and a panting trooper snatched at the back seat, was grabbed by the sais, and swung up in the rear.  \"Sahib--\"  \"All right. I know,\" said Kirby, though he did not know how he knew.  They raced through another dozen streets until the glare grew blinding and the smoke nearly choked him. Then they were stopped entirely by the crowd, and Colonel Kirby sat motionless; for he had a nearly perfect view of a holocaust. The house in which Ranjoor Singh was supposed to be was so far burned that little more than the walls was standing.     The North Wind hails from the Northern snows,     (His voice is loud--oh, listen ye!)   He cried of death--the death he knows--     Of the mountain death. (Oh, listen ye!)   Who looks to the North for love looks long!   Who goes to the North for gain goes wrong!   Men's hearts are hard, and the goods belong     To the strong in the North! (Oh, listen ye!)   Whose lot is fair--who loves his life--   Walks wide, stays wide of the Northern knife!     (Ye men o' the world, oh, listen ye!)  YASMINI'S SONG.     CHAPTER VI   There were police and to spare now, nor any doubt of it. Even the breath of war's beginning could not keep them elsewhere when a fire had charge in the densest quarters of the danger zone. The din of ancient Delhi roared skyward, and the Delhi crowd surged and fought to be nearer to the flame; but the police already had a cordon around the building, and another detachment was forcing the swarms of men and women into eddying movement in which something like a system developed presently, for there began to be a clear space in which the fire brigade could work.  \"Any bodies recovered?\" asked Colonel Kirby, leaning from the seat of his high dogcart to speak to the English fireman who stood sentry over the water-plug.  \"No, sir. The fire had too much headway before the alarm went in. When we got here the whole lower part was red-hot.\"  \"Any means of escape from the building from the rear?\"  \"As many as from a rat-run, sir. That house is as old as Delhi--about; and there are as any galleries up above connecting with houses at the rear as there are run-holes from cellar to cellar.\"  \"Any chance for anybody down in the cellar?\"  \"Doubt it, sir. The fire started there; the water'll do what the fire left undone. Pretty bad trap, sir, I should say, if you asked me.\"  \"No reports of escape or rescue?\"  \"None that I've heard tell of.\"  \"And the house seems doomed, eh? Be some days before they can sort the debris over?\"  \"Lucky if we save the ten houses nearest it! Look, sir! There she goes!\"  The roof fell in, sending five separate volumes of red sparks up into the cloudy night as floor after floor collapsed beneath the weight. The thunder of it was almost drowned in a roar of delight, for the crowd, sensing the new spirit of its masters, was in a mood for the terrible. Then silence fell, as if that had been an overture.  Out of the silence and through the sea of hot humanity, the white of his dress-shirt showing through the unbuttoned front of a military cloak, Warrington rode a borrowed Arab pony, the pony's owner's sais running beside him to help clear a passage. Warrington was still humming to himself as he dismissed both sais and pony and climbed up beside Kirby in the dog-cart.  \"If Ranjoor Singh's in that house, he's in a predicament,\" he said cheerfully. \"I went to police headquarters, and the first officer I spoke to told me to go to hell. So I went into the next office, where all the big panjandrums hide--and some of the little ones--and they told me what you know, sir, that the house is in flames and every policeman who can be spared is on the job, so I came to see. If Ranjoor Singh's in there--but I don't believe he is!\"  \"Why don't you?\"  \"I don't believe the Lord 'ud send us active service--not a real red war against a real enemy--and play a low-down trick on Ranjoor Singh. Ranjoor Singh's a gentleman. It wouldn't be sportsmanlike to let him die before the game begins.\"  For a minute or two they watched the sparks go up and the crowd striking at the rats that still seemed to find some place of exit.  \"There's a place below there that isn't red--hot yet,\" said Kirby. \"Those rats are not cooked through. Did you tell the police that you wanted a search warrant?\"  \"Yes. Might as well argue with an ant-heap. All of 'em too busy tryin' for commissions in the Volunteers to listen. They've got it all cut an' dried--somebody in the basement upset a lamp, according to them--nobody up-stairs--nobody to turn in the alarm until the fire had complete charge! They offer to prove it when the fire's out and they can sort the ashes.\"  \"Um-m-m! Tell 'em a trooper of ours saw a light there?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What did they say?\"  \"'Doubtless the lamp that was kicked over!'\"  Colonel Kirby clucked to his horse and worked a way out to the edge of the crowd with the"]]]
