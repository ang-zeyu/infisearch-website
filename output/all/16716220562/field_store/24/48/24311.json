He looked more moody and discontented than usual. Instead of hastening to do the work which was waiting for him, he stood before the window, looking out into the garden. Mrs. Wilford told him the gentleman would be impatient, and he finally left the house and walked down to the ferry-boat.  \"I wonder what your father is thinking about,\" said Mrs. Wilford, as the door closed behind him.  \"I don't know,\" replied Lawry; \"he don't seem to be thinking that people won't wait forever for him. I guess I'll go up to Mr. Sherwood's, and see when he wants me.\"  \"You must fix up a little before you go,\" replied the prudent mother. \"They are very grand people up at Mr. Sherwood's, and you must look as well as you can.\"  \"I'll put on my best clothes,\" added Lawry.  In half an hour he had changed his dress, and looked like another boy. Mrs. Wilford adjusted a few stray locks of his hair, and as he put on his new straw hat, and left the house, her eye followed him with a feeling of motherly pride. He was a good boy, and had the reputation of being a very smart boy, and she may be pardoned for the parental vanity with which she regarded him. While he visits the house of Mr. Sherwood, we will follow his father down to the ferry, where the bank director was impatiently waiting his appearance.  After the shower the sun had come out brightly, and the wind had abated so that there was hardly breeze enough to ruffle the waters of the lake. It was intensely warm, and Mr. Randall had taken off his coat again, but he was careful to keep it on his arm. At the approach of the ferryman he went into the boat, where he was followed by the vehicle that had been waiting so long for a passage across the lake.  John Wilford pushed off the boat with a pole, and trimmed the sail, which was the motive power of the craft when there was any wind. The ferry-boat was a large bateau, or flatboat, the slope at the ends being so gradual that a wagon could pass down over it to the bottom of the boat. This inclined plane was extended by a movable platform about six feet wide, which swung horizontally up and down, like a great trap-door. When the ferry-boat touched the shore, this platform was let down upon the ground, forming a slope on which carriages were driven into and out of the bateau.  The wind was very light, and the clumsy craft moved very slowly--so slowly that the passage promised to be a severe trial to the patience of Mr. Randall, who hoped to reach Shoreham by five o'clock. He was not in a very amiable frame of mind; he was angry at the delay in starting, and he was vexed because the wind would not blow. He walked nervously from the forward platform to the after one, with his coat still on his arm.  \"We shall not get over to-night,\" said he impatiently, as he stopped by the side of the ferryman, and threw his coat down upon the platform, while he wiped the perspiration from his brow.  \"Yes, I guess we shall,\" replied John Wilford.  \"I'll give you a dollar if you will land me at Pointville by three o'clock.\"  \"I can't make the wind blow, if you would give me a hundred dollars.\"  \"Can't you use the pole or the oars?\" said the bank director petulantly; \"you kept me waiting half an hour before you started.\"  \"I couldn't help that,\" replied John Wilford.  Mr. Randall walked to the forward platform, fretting with impatience at the indifference of the ferryman. He stood for a few moments gazing at the Vermont shore, and appeared to be engaged in estimating the distance yet to be accomplished. The calculation was not satisfactory, and the bank director's wrath was on the increase. With hasty step he walked aft again.  \"I think we shall have more wind in a minute,\" said John Wilford, as he stepped down from the platform and adjusted the sheet.  \"If we don't, I shall go crazy,\" replied Mr. Randall.  When he had placed one foot on the platform, by some means the drop, true to its name, went down and splashed in the water. The bank director stepped back in season to save himself from a cold bath or a watery grave, as the case might be.  \"My coat! save my coat!\" shouted Mr. Randall, as the garment rolled off the platform into the water.  \"Why didn't you hold on to it?\" said John Wilford.  \"Save my coat! There is six thousand dollars in the pocket,\" groaned the unhappy bank director.     CHAPTER III  SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS   Within half a mile of the ferryman's cottage, at Port Rock, was the summer residence of Mr. Sherwood, who, two years before, had become the husband of Bertha Grant, of Woodville. The scenery in the vicinity was beautiful, and the mansion commanded a splendid view of the Adirondack Mountains and of the lake.  Mr. Sherwood was an enthusiastic admirer of the scenery of Lake Champlain. His constant visits at Woodville had given him a taste for aquatic sports, in which he was disposed to indulge on a larger scale than ever had been known at Woodville. He had been remarkably fortunate in his financial operations, and was already a wealthy man. Though he did not retire from active business, he had taken a partner, which enabled him to spend a part of his time during the summer at his country house on the lake.  Mr. Grant had gone to Europe a second time, to be absent during the summer, and Miss Fanny and Fanny Jane had accepted Bertha's invitation to spend a few weeks at Port Rock. A splendid time had been promised them by Mrs. Sherwood, who had made extensive preparations for their visit. The arrangements included a novelty which offered a very brilliant prospect to the party, and excited the imagination even of the older ones to the highest pitch.  This novelty was nothing less than a miniature steamboat, which had already been christened the _Woodville_, in honor of the home of the owner's lady. She was a splendid little craft, and as perfect in her machinery and appointments as any steamer that ever floated. She was a side-wheel boat, sixty feet in length, by twelve feet beam. Forward there were a regular wheel-house, a small kitchen, and other rooms usually found in a steamer. Abaft the wheels there were a saloon and two staterooms. Of course all these apartments, as well as the cabin below, were very contracted in their dimensions; but they were fitted up in the most elegant style.  The _Woodville_ had cost a great deal of money; but her owner expected to realize a full return for it in the enjoyment she would afford him, his wife, and their friends. She had been sent up the Hudson, and through the canal to Whitehall, and thence to Port Henry, where she had arrived on the day before Lawry Wilford's return to Port Rock.  On board of the little steamer there is an old friend of our readers. He may be found in the engine-room; and as he rubs up the polished iron of the machinery, he is thinking of Fanny Jane Grant, with whom he escaped from the Indians in Minnesota, and whom he expects on board with Mr. Sherwood's party. The young man, now sixteen years of age, is the engineer of the _Woodville_. Though he has been but two years learning the trade of machinist, he is as thoroughly acquainted with every part of a marine-engine as though he had spent his lifetime in studying it.  The engine of the _Woodville_ was built at the works where Ethan French was learning his trade, and he had been employed in its construction. As he was a frequent visitor at Woodville, he had petitioned for the situation he now held. At first, Mr. Sherwood was not willing to trust him; but Ethan's employers declared that he was a man in everything but years, and was fully competent to manage the engine, and even to build one after the designs were made. He had come up from New York in the steamer. He had seen Mr. Sherwood at Port Henry, on his arrival, and had been ordered to have the boat in readiness to start on the following morning, when the family would be passengers.  Mr. Sherwood had already selected Lawry Wilford as the pilot of the _Woodville_. He was small in stature, and would look better in the wheel-house than a full-grown man. He had often met the young pilot, and had been greatly pleased with his energy and decision. Lawry had been employed by Miss Fanny several times to row her on the lake; and he had served her so faithfully that her influence was not wanting in procuring for him the situation.  Lawry, not yet informed of the honorable and responsible position which had been awarded to him, walked up to Mr. Sherwood's house. He had heard Miss Fanny speak of the _Woodville_, while in the boat with him, and had listened with delight to her enthusiastic description of the beautiful craft. He was quite as anxious to see her as any of the party who were more directly interested in her.  \"Can I see Mr. Sherwood?\" asked Lawry.  \"He has gone away,\" replied the man.  \"Where has he gone?\"  \"To Port Henry; he went in the carriage, and is coming back in the new steamboat.\"  \"Has he got a pilot?\" continued Lawry anxiously.  \"I don't know; he expected you, I believe; but when you didn't come back, he couldn't wait any longer. I heard him say he could pilot her himself, and I suppose he is going to do so.\"  \"I'm sorry I didn't see him; I have but just got home,\" replied Lawry.  He wanted to pilot the beautiful little steamer up from Port Henry. He wanted to see her; wanted to make her acquaintance, for she promised to be the belle of the lake. He was sorry to lose the chance, for it might prove to be a valuable one to him. Mr. Sherwood was very liberal, and he hoped he would not engage another pilot. It was no use to complain, and Lawry walked back to the ferry, where he could see the steamer when she arrived. When he reached the landing-place, the ferry-boat was about halfway across the lake, and his attention was attracted by the strange movements of those on board of her. His father was laboring at the steering-oar with a zeal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6572"],["title","Haste and Waste; Or, the Young Pilot of Lake Champlain. A Story for Young People (#3)"],["body","indicated that some unusual event had occurred. The ferry-boat was thrown up into the wind, and while Lawry was waiting to ascertain what the matter was, his father leaped into the water.  It was now evident to Lawry that something serious had happened, and he sprang into the small keel-boat, used for conveying foot-passengers across the lake, which was fastened to a stake on the shore. Taking the oars, he pulled with all his might toward the ferry-boat. He was a stout boy, and handled his oars very skillfully; but before  he could reach the scene of the excitement, his father had returned to the bateau.  \"There's your coat,\" said John Wilford.  Mr. Randall seized the garment with convulsive energy, and with trembling hands felt for the pocketbook in which the six thousand dollars had been kept.  \"It is gone!\" gasped he; and he seemed ready to sink down in the bottom of the boat when he discovered his loss.  \"Gone!\" exclaimed John Wilford.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Lawry.  \"I've lost my pocketbook with six thousand dollars in it,\" groaned the bank director.  \"How did you lose it?\" demanded Lawry.  \"That drop came down and let my coat into the lake; but I don't see how my pocketbook could get out of the coat.\"  \"I don't believe the money was in the pocket,\" added the ferryman.  \"Yes, it was,\" persisted Mr. Randall.  \"I don't see how it could fall out of the pocket,\" said John Wilford.  \"Nor I; but the money is gone,\" answered the bank director, with a vacant stare. \"I'm ruined!\"  \"Well, I can't help it. I've done all I could for you. I tried to save it; and if I get the rheumatism for a month or two, it will be a bad job for me.\"  \"Wasn't the pocketbook in the pocket when you picked up the coat?\" asked Mr. Randall, walking up to the ferryman.  \"How should I know?\" replied John Wilford. \"I gave you the coat just as I found it.\"  \"I don't believe the pocketbook would sink,\" added the director. \"There was nothing but paper in it.\"  \"Of course it wouldn't sink, then,\" interposed the owner of the vehicle in the ferry-boat.  \"I don't think it would,\" said Mr. Randall.  \"I know it wouldn't,\" protested the stranger. \"I dropped my pocketbook into the lake once, and it floated ten minutes before I could get it again.\"  \"Then it must be floating about on the water,\" added Lawry. \"I will try to find it.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" said Mr. Randall.  They got into the boat, and Lawry pulled about the spot where the coat had fallen into the water for half an hour without discovering the pocketbook.  \"I suppose I must give it up,\" sighed the director.  \"I'm sure it's not on the water,\" replied Lawry.  \"Do you suppose it would sink?\"  \"I don't know; the gentleman in the ferry-boat says it wouldn't.\"  \"Stop a minute, boy, and I will soon find out,\" continued the unfortunate loser of the money.  He took all the money and papers out of his wallet, and stuffed it with pieces of newspaper which Lawry gave him. Having thus prepared the wallet, which he said was of the same material as the lost pocketbook, he placed it on the surface of the water, holding his hand underneath to save it, in case the trial should result differently from his anticipations. It floated, and he removed his hand from under it to exhibit his confidence in the law he had tested.  \"That's plain enough,\" said he. \"My pocketbook hasn't gone to the bottom.\"  \"It certainly has not,\" replied Lawry.  \"Then where is it?--that's the next question.\"  \"Are you sure it was in your pocket when you got into the ferry-boat?\"  \"Just as sure as I am that I sit here.\"  \"You were very careless about your coat on board of the sloop.\"  \"I know I was.\"  \"I don't see how a man could throw down his coat with six thousand dollars in the pocket,\" said Lawry.  \"I know I'm careless; but I'm so used to carrying money that I don't think much about it. I always carry it in a pocket inside of my vest,\" continued the director, putting his hand in the place indicated; \"but this is a new vest, and hasn't any such pocket. Things don't look all right to me. Is the ferryman your father?\"  \"Yes, sir; he is.\"  \"Well, the money's gone,\" added Mr. Randall. \"We will go back to the ferry-boat.\"  \"Did you find it?\" asked John Wilford, as the bank director stepped into the bateau.  \"No; but I'm certain it has not gone to the bottom.\"  \"Where is it, then?\"  \"I don't know; can you tell me?\"  Mr. Randall looked at the ferryman very sharply. His manner indicated that he had some suspicions.  \"How can I tell you?\" replied John Wilford.  \"The money was in the coat pocket when you picked it up in the water--I know it was.\"  \"Do you mean to say I took it out?\" demanded the ferryman angrily.  \"If you didn't, I don't see what has become of it.\"  \"Do you mean to accuse my father of stealing?\" said Lawry indignantly.  \"I don't accuse him of anything; but here are the facts, and you can all see for yourselves.\"  \"You throw your coat down anywhere. It would have gone overboard from the sloop if I hadn't saved it; and it won't do for so careless a man as you are to accuse anybody of stealing your money,\" added Lawry angrily.  \"Very likely you lost it out of the pocket before you got into the ferry-boat.\"  \"Never mind him, Lawry. I haven't got his pocketbook,\" interposed the ferryman.  \"I know you haven't, father; and it makes me mad to hear him accuse you of stealing it.\"  \"Mr. Randall, if you think I've got your money, I want you to satisfy yourself on the point at once,\" continued John Wilford, turning to the director.  \"I hope you haven't.\"  \"But you think I have. Search me, then.\"  Greatly to the indignation of Lawry, Mr. Randall did search the ferryman; turned out his pockets, and examined every part of his wet garments. The pocketbook was not upon his person; and the loser, in spite of the laws of specific gravity, which he had just demonstrated, was almost compelled to believe that his money had gone to the bottom of the lake.     CHAPTER IV  THE STEAMER \"WOODVILLE\"   Mr. Randall, now that his money was lost, declared that he had no business in Shoreham, and it was useless for him to go there. The six thousand dollars belonged to his bank, and, having an opportunity to put this sum in circulation, where it would be \"kept out\" for several weeks, he was making this journey to accomplish the business. He facetiously remarked that it was likely to be kept out longer than was desirable.  Lawry was so sure Mr. Randall had dropped the pocketbook on the shore before he got into the ferry-boat, that he insisted upon returning to Pork Rock and having the ground searched. Though the bank director was satisfied that the pocketbook was safe in his possession when he entered the bateau, he was willing to return, since the object of his journey had been defeated, and Lawry pulled him back to the landing-place. The ground under the tree, and over which Mr. Randall had walked while waiting for the ferryman, was carefully examined, but the lost pocketbook could not be found.  The bank director had very little to say after he left the ferry-boat; but he was very thoughtful, as a man who had lost six thousand dollars might reasonably be. After the search on shore was completed, he walked off toward the village without mentioning his intentions, but he looked as though he purposed to do something.  \"What's the matter, Lawry?\" asked Mrs. Wilford, who had been watching the movements of Mr. Randall and her son from the window, as she came out of the house.  \"The gentleman has lost his money--six thousand dollars,\" replied Lawry.  \"Lost it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wilford, recalling the conversation with her husband at dinner.  \"His coat fell overboard, and the pocketbook dropped out.\"  \"Fell into the lake,\" added she, with a feeling of relief.  \"Yes; father swam out and got the coat, but the money was gone.\"  Mrs. Wilford returned to the house. Perhaps she had some misgivings, and felt more than before that those who make haste to be rich are often ruined; but she said nothing. Lawry was perplexed at the disappearance of the money. Mr. Randall had proved that a pocketbook with nothing but paper in it would not sink within a reasonable time. If the lost treasure had fallen into the water, he would certainly have found it. If it had been dropped on shore or in the ferry-boat, it would not have disappeared so strangely.  Lawry was so positive that the pocketbook was still in the ferry-boat, or on the shore, that he renewed the search, and carefully scrutinized every foot of ground between the house and the landing-place, but with no better success than before. By this time the ferry-boat, which had been favored by a good wind during the last half-hour, returned.  \"What do you suppose became of that pocketbook, father?\" asked Lawry, as he stepped into the boat.  \"I don't know. I don't believe he lost any pocketbook,\" replied John Wilford.  \"He says he did, and I saw it myself.\"  \"Perhaps you did, but I don't believe there was any six thousand dollars in it. If there had been, he wouldn't have thrown it about as he did.\"  \"He says there was six thousand dollars in the pocketbook.\"  \"I don't believe it. It's a likely story that a man would throw down his coat, with all that money in the pocket, on the drop. In my opinion it's some trick to cheat his creditors out of their just due.\"  \"It don't seem possible.\"  \"That's the truth, you may depend upon it. That's the way men make money.\"  Lawry was by no means satisfied with this explanation. He went into the boat, and carefully searched every part of it. His father watched him with considerable interest, declaring that it was useless to look for what had not been lost.  \"You had better go up and see Mr. Sherwood now,\" said Mr. Wilford.  \"I have been up, and he was not at home.\"  \"You better go again, then.\"  \"He has gone to Port Henry after the new steamer.\"  \"Has he got a pilot?\"  \"Not that I know of.\"  \"He can't get one at Port Henry,\" said the ferryman.  \"I suppose he is going to pilot her himself.\" "]]]
