Rose became strongly attached to her, and the little girl fully returned her affection.  Elsie was very sensitive and affectionate, and felt keenly the want of sympathy and love, for which, at the time of Rose's coming, she had no one to look to but poor old Chloe, who loved her with all her heart.  It is true, Adelaide sometimes treated her almost affectionately, and Lora, who had a very strong sense of justice, occasionally interfered and took her part when she was very unjustly accused, but no one seemed really to care for her, and she often felt sad and lonely. Mr. Dinsmore, though her own grandfather, treated her with entire neglect, seemed to have not the slightest affection for her, and usually spoke of her as \"old Crayson's grandchild.\" Mrs. Dinsmore really disliked her, because she looked upon her as the child of a stepson for whom she had never felt any affection, and also as the future rival of her own children; while the governess and the younger members of the family, following the example of their elders, treated her with neglect, and occasionally even with abuse. Miss Day, knowing that she was in no danger of incurring the displeasure of her superiors by so doing, vented upon her all the spite she dared not show to her other pupils; and continually she was made to give up her toys and pleasures to Enna, and even sometimes to Arthur and Walter. It often cost her a struggle, and had she possessed less of the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, her life had been wretched indeed.  But in spite of all her trials and vexations, little Elsie was the happiest person in the family; for she had in her heart that peace which the world can neither give nor take away; that joy which the Saviour gives to His own, and no man taketh from them. She constantly carried all her sorrows and troubles to Him, and the coldness and neglect of others seemed but to drive her nearer to that Heavenly Friend, until she felt that while possessed of His love, she could not be unhappy, though treated with scorn and abuse by all the world.     \"The good are better made by ill,     As odors crushed are sweeter still;\"  And even so it seemed to be with little Elsie; her trials seemed to have only the effect of purifying and making more lovely her naturally amiable character.  Elsie talked much and thought more of her absent and unknown father, and longed with an intensity of desire for his return home. It was her dream, by day and by night, that he had come, that he had taken her to his heart, calling her \"his own darling child, his precious little Elsie;\" for such were the loving epithets she often heard lavished upon Enna, and which she longed to hear addressed to herself. But from month to month, and year to year, that longed-for return had been delayed until the little heart had grown sick with hope deferred, and was often weary with its almost hopeless waiting. But to return.  \"Elsie,\" said Adelaide, as Miss Allison and the little girl entered the breakfast-room on the morning after Elsie's disappointment, \"the fair is not over yet, and Miss Allison and I are going to ride out there this afternoon; so, if you are a good girl in school, you may go with us.\"  \"Oh! thank you, dear Aunt Adelaide,\" exclaimed the little girl, clapping her hands with delight; \"how kind you are! and I shall be so glad.\"  Miss Day frowned, and looked as if she wanted to reprove her for her noisy demonstrations of delight, but, standing somewhat in awe of Adelaide, said nothing.  But Elsie suddenly relapsed into silence, for at that moment Mrs. Dinsmore entered the room, and it was seldom that she could utter a word in her presence without being reproved and told that \"children should be seen and not heard,\" though her own were allowed to talk as much as they pleased.  Miss Day seemed cross, Mrs. Dinsmore was moody and taciturn, complaining of headache, and Mr. Dinsmore occupied with the morning paper; and so the meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. Elsie was glad when it was over, and hastening to the school-room, she began her tasks without waiting for the arrival of the regular hour for study.  She had the room entirely to herself, and had been busily engaged for half an hour in working out her examples, when the opening of the door caused her to look up, and, to her dismay, Arthur entered. He did not, however, as she feared, begin his customary course of teasing and tormenting, but seated himself at his desk, leaning his head upon his hand in an attitude of dejection.  Elsie wondered what ailed him, his conduct was so unusual, and she could not help every now and then sending an inquiring glance toward him, and at length she asked, \"What is the matter, Arthur?\"  \"Nothing much,\" said he, gruffly, turning his back to her.  Thus repulsed, she said no more, but gave her undivided attention to her employment; and so diligent was she, that Miss Day had no excuse whatever for fault-finding this morning. Her tasks were all completed within the required time, and she enjoyed her promised ride with her aunt and Miss Allison, and her visit to the fair, very much indeed.  It was still early when they returned; and finding that she had nearly an hour to dispose of before tea-time, Elsie thought she would finish a drawing which she had left in her desk in the school-room. While searching for it and her pencil, she heard Lora's and Arthur's voices on the veranda.  She did not notice what they were saying, until her own name struck her ear.  \"Elsie is the only person,\" Lora was saying, \"who can, and probably will, help you; for she has plenty of money, and she is so kind and generous; but, if I were you, I should be ashamed to ask her, after the way you acted toward her.\"  \"I wish I hadn't teased her so yesterday,\" replied Arthur, disconsolately, \"but it's such fun, I can't help it sometimes.\"  \"Well, I know I wouldn't ask a favor of anybody I had treated so,\" said Lora, walking away.  Elsie sat still a few moments, working at her drawing and wondering all the time what it was Arthur wanted, and thinking how glad she would be of an opportunity of returning him good for evil. She did not like, though, to seek his confidence, but presently hearing him heave a deep sigh, she rose and went out on the veranda.  He was leaning on the railing in an attitude of dejection, his head bent down and his eyes fixed on the floor. She went up to him, and laying her hand softly on his shoulder, said, in the sweet, gentle tones natural to her. \"What ails you, Arthur? Can I do anything for you? I will be very glad if I can.\"  \"No--yes--\" he answered hesitatingly; \"I wouldn't like to ask you after--after--\"  \"Oh! never mind,\" said Elsie, quickly; \"I do not care anything about that now. I had the ride to-day, and that was better still, because I went with Aunt Adelaide and Miss Allison. Tell me what you want.\"  Thus encouraged, Arthur replied, \"I saw a beautiful little ship yesterday when I was in the city; it was only five dollars, and I've set my heart on having it, but my pocket money's all gone, and papa won't give me a cent until next month's allowance is due; and by that time the ship will be gone, for it's such a beauty somebody'll be sure to buy it.\"  \"Won't your mamma buy it for you?\" asked Elsie.  \"No, she says she hasn't the money to spare just now. You know it's near the end of the month, and they've all spent their allowances except Louise, and she says she'll not lend her money to such a spendthrift as I am.\"  Elsie drew out her purse, and seemed just about to put it into his hand; but, apparently changing her mind, she hesitated a moment, and then returning it to her pocket, said, with a half smile, \"I don't know, Arthur; five dollars is a good deal for a little girl like me to lay out at once. I must think about it a little.\"  \"I don't ask you to _give_ it,\" he replied scornfully; \"I'll pay it back in two weeks.\"  \"Well, I will see by to-morrow morning,\" she said, darting away, while he sent an angry glance after her, muttering the word \"stingy\" between his teeth.  Elsie ran down to the kitchen, asking of one and another of the servants as she passed, \"Where's Pompey?\" The last time she put the question to Phoebe, the cook, but was answered by Pompey himself. \"Here am Pomp, Miss Elsie; what does little missy want wid dis chile?\"  \"Are you going to the city to-night, Pompey?\"  \"Yes, Miss Elsie, I'se got some arrants to do for missus an' de family in ginral, an' I ben gwine start in 'bout ten minutes. Little missy wants sumpin', eh?\"  Elsie motioned to him to come close to her, and then putting her purse into his hands, she told him in a whisper of Arthur's wish, and directed him to purchase the coveted toy, and bring it to her, if possible, without letting any one else know anything about it. \"And keep half a dollar for yourself, Pompey, to pay you for your trouble,\" she added in conclusion.  \"Tank you, little missy,\" he replied, with a broad grin of satisfaction; \"dat be berry good pay, and Pomp am de man to do dis business up for you 'bout right.\"  The tea-bell rang, and Elsie hastened away to answer the summons. She looked across the table at Arthur with a pleasant smile on her countenance, but he averted his eyes with an angry scowl; and with a slight sigh she turned away her head, and did not look at him again during the meal.  Pompey executed his commission faithfully; and when Elsie returned to her own room after her evening hour with Miss Rose, Chloe pointed out the little ship standing on the mantel.  \"Oh! it's a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6440"],["title","Elsie Dinsmore (#5)"],["body","y,\" cried Elsie, clapping her hands and dancing up and down with delight; \"how Arthur will be pleased! Now, mammy, can you take it to the school-room, and put it on Master Arthur's desk, without anybody seeing you?\"  \"Ole Chloe'll try, darlin,\" she said, taking it in her hands.  \"Oh! wait one moment,\" exclaimed Elsie, and taking a card, she wrote on it, \"A present to Arthur, from his niece Elsie.\" Then laying it on the deck of the little vessel. \"There, mammy,\" she said, \"I think that will do; but please look out first to see whether any one is in the hall.\"  \"Coast all clear, darlin',\" replied Chloe, after a careful survey; \"all de chillens am in bed before dis time, I spec.\" And taking a candle in one hand and the little ship in the other, she started for the school-room. She soon returned with a broad grin of satisfaction on her black face, saying, \"All right, darlin', I put him on Massa Arthur's desk, an' nobody de wiser.\"  So Elsie went to bed very happy in the thought of the pleasure Arthur would have in receiving her present.  She was hurrying down to the breakfast-room the next morning, a little in advance of Miss Rose, who had stopped to speak to Adelaide, when Arthur came running up behind her, having just come in by a side door from the garden, and seizing her round the waist, he said, \"Thank you, Elsie; you're a real good girl! She sails beautifully. I've been trying her on the pond. But it mustn't be a _present;_ you must let me pay you back when I get my allowance.\"  \"Oh! no, Arthur, that would spoil it all,\" she answered quickly; \"you are entirely welcome, and you know my allowance is so large that half the time I have more money than I know how to spend.\"  \"I should like to see the time that would be the case with me,\" said he, laughing. Then in a lower tone, \"Elsie, I'm sorry I teased you so. I'll not do it again soon.\"  Elsie answered him with a grateful look, as she stepped past him and quietly took her place at the table.  Arthur kept his word, and for many weeks entirely refrained from teasing Elsie, and while freed from that annoyance she was always able to have her tasks thoroughly prepared; and though her governess was often unreasonable and exacting, and there was scarcely a day in which she was not called upon to yield her own wishes or pleasures, or in some way to inconvenience herself to please Walter or Enna, or occasionally the older members of the family, yet it was an unusually happy winter to her, for Rose Allison's love and uniform kindness shed sunshine on her path. She had learned to yield readily to others, and when fretted or saddened by unjust or unkind treatment, a few moments alone with her precious Bible and her loved Saviour made all right again, and she would come from those sweet communings looking as serenely happy as if she had never known an annoyance. She was a wonder to all the family. Her grandfather would sometimes look at her as, without a frown or a pout, she would give up her own wishes to Enna, and shaking his head, say, \"She's no Dinsmore, or she would know how to stand up for her own rights better than that. _I_ don't like such tame-spirited people. She's not Horace's child; it never was an easy matter to impose upon or conquer him. He was a boy of spirit.\"  \"What a strange child Elsie is?\" Adelaide remarked to her friend one day. \"I am often surprised to see how sweetly she gives up to all of us; really she has a lovely temper. I quite envy her; it was always hard for me to give up my own way.\"  \"I do not believe it was easy for her at first,\" said Rose. \"I think her sweet disposition is the fruit of a work of grace in her heart. It is the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which God alone can bestow.\"  \"I wish I had it, then,\" said Adelaide, sighing.  \"You have only to go to the right source to obtain it, dear Adelaide,\" replied her friend, gently.  \"And yet,\" said Adelaide, \"I must say I sometimes think that, as papa says, there is something mean-spirited and cowardly in always giving up to other people.\"  \"It would indeed be cowardly and wrong to give up _principle_,\" replied Rose, \"but surely it is noble and generous to give up our own wishes to another, where no principle is involved.\"  \"Certainly, you are right,\" said Adelaide, musingly. \"And now I recollect that, readily as Elsie gives up her own wishes to others on ordinary occasions, I have never known her to sacrifice principle; but, on the contrary, she has several times made mamma excessively angry by refusing to romp and play with Enna on the Sabbath, or to deceive papa when questioned with regard to some of Arthur's misdeeds; yet she has often borne the blame of his faults, when she might have escaped by telling of him. Elsie is certainly very different from any of the rest of us, and if it is piety that makes her what she is, I think piety is a very lovely thing.\"  Elsie's mornings were spent in the school-room; in the afternoon she walked, or rode out, sometimes in company with her young uncles and aunts, and sometimes alone, a negro boy following at a respectful distance, as a protector. In the evening there was almost always company in the parlor, and she found it pleasanter to sit beside the bright wood-fire in her own room, with her fond old nurse for a companion, than to stay there, or with the younger ones in the sitting-room or nursery. If she had no lesson to learn, she usually read aloud to Chloe, as she sat knitting by the fire, and the Bible was the book generally preferred by both; and then when she grew weary of reading, she would often take a stool, and sitting down close to Chloe, put her head in her lap, saying, \"Now, mammy, tell me about mamma.\"  And then for the hundredth time or more the old woman would go over the story of the life and death of her \"dear young missus,\" as she always called her; telling of her beauty, her goodness, and of her sorrows and sufferings during the last year of her short life.  It was a story which never lost its charm for Elsie; a story which the one never wearied of telling, nor the other of hearing. Elsie would sit listening, with her mother's miniature in her hand, gazing at it with tearful eyes, then press it to her lips, murmuring, \"My own mamma; poor, dear mamma.\" And when Chloe had finished that story she would usually say, \"Now, mammy, tell me all about papa.\"  But upon this subject Chloe had very little information to give. She knew him only as a gay, handsome young stranger, whom she had seen occasionally during a few months, and who had stolen all the sunshine from her beloved young mistress' life, and left her to die alone; yet she did not blame him when speaking to his child, for the young wife had told her that he had not forsaken her of his own free choice; and though she could not quite banish from her own mind the idea that he had not been altogether innocent in the matter, she breathed no hint of it to Elsie; for Chloe was a sensible woman, and knew that to lead the little one to think ill of her only remaining parent would but tend to make her unhappy.  Sometimes Elsie would ask very earnestly, \"Do you thing papa loves Jesus, mammy?\" And Chloe would reply with a doubtful shake of the head, \"Dunno, darlin'; but ole Chloe prays for him ebery day.\"  \"And so do I,\" Elsie would answer; \"dear, dear papa, how I wish he would come home!\"  And so the winter glided away, and spring came, and Miss Allison must soon return home. It was now the last day of March, and her departure had been fixed for the second of April. For a number of weeks Elsie had been engaged, during all her spare moments, in knitting a purse for Rose, wishing to give her something which was the work of her own hands, knowing that as such it would be more prized by her friend than a costlier gift. She had just returned from her afternoon ride, and taking out her work she sat down to finish it. She was in her own room, with no companion but Chloe, who sat beside her knitting as usual.  Elsie worked on silently for some time, then suddenly holding up her purse, she exclaimed, \"See, mammy, it is all done but putting on the tassel! Isn't it pretty? and won't dear Miss Allison be pleased with it?\"  It really was very pretty indeed, of crimson and gold, and beautifully knit, and Chloe, looking at it with admiring eyes, said, \"I spec she will, darlin'. I tink it's berry handsome.\"  At this moment Enna opened the door and came in.  Elsie hastily attempted to conceal the purse by thrusting it into her pocket, but it was too late, for Enna had seen it, and running toward her, cried out, \"Now, Elsie, just give that to me!\"  \"No, Enna,\" replied Elsie, mildly, \"I cannot let you have it, because it is for Miss Rose.\"  \"I will have it,\" exclaimed the child, resolutely, \"and if you don't give it to me at once I shall just go and tell mamma.\"  \"I will let you take it in your hand a few moments to look at it, if you will be careful not to soil it, Enna,\" said Elsie, in the same gentle tone; \"and if you wish, I will get some more silk and beads, and make you one just like it; but I cannot give you this, because I would not have time to make another for Miss Rose.\"  \"No, I shall just have that one; and I shall have it to keep,\" said Enna, attempting to snatch it out of Elsie's hand.  But Elsie held it up out of her reach, and after trying several times in vain to get it, Enna left the room, crying and screaming with passion.  Chloe locked the door, saying, \"Great pity, darlin', we forgot to do dat 'fore Miss Enna came. I'se 'fraid she gwine bring missus for make you gib um up.\"  Elsie sat down to her work again, but she was very pale, and her little hands trembled with agitation, and her soft eyes were full of tears.  Chloe's fears were but too well founded; for the next moment hasty steps were heard in the passage, and the handle of the door was laid hold of with no very gentle grasp; and then, as it refused to yield to her touch, Mrs. Dinsmore's voice was heard in an angry"]]]
