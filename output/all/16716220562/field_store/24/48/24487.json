I believe,’ said Mr. Snitchey, looking at his partner, ‘that I speak for Self and Craggs?’  Mr. Craggs having signified assent, Mr. Snitchey, somewhat freshened by his recent eloquence, observed that he would take a little more beef and another cup of tea.  ‘I don’t stand up for life in general,’ he added, rubbing his hands and chuckling, ‘it’s full of folly; full of something worse.  Professions of trust, and confidence, and unselfishness, and all that!  Bah, bah, bah! We see what they’re worth.  But, you mustn’t laugh at life; you’ve got a game to play; a very serious game indeed!  Everybody’s playing against you, you know, and you’re playing against them.  Oh! it’s a very interesting thing.  There are deep moves upon the board.  You must only laugh, Dr. Jeddler, when you win—and then not much.  He, he, he!  And then not much,’ repeated Snitchey, rolling his head and winking his eye, as if he would have added, ‘you may do this instead!’  ‘Well, Alfred!’ cried the Doctor, ‘what do you say now?’  ‘I say, sir,’ replied Alfred, ‘that the greatest favour you could do me, and yourself too, I am inclined to think, would be to try sometimes to forget this battle-field and others like it in that broader battle-field of Life, on which the sun looks every day.’  ‘Really, I’m afraid that wouldn’t soften his opinions, Mr. Alfred,’ said Snitchey.  ‘The combatants are very eager and very bitter in that same battle of Life.  There’s a great deal of cutting and slashing, and firing into people’s heads from behind.  There is terrible treading down, and trampling on.  It is rather a bad business.’  ‘I believe, Mr. Snitchey,’ said Alfred, ‘there are quiet victories and struggles, great sacrifices of self, and noble acts of heroism, in it—even in many of its apparent lightnesses and contradictions—not the less difficult to achieve, because they have no earthly chronicle or audience—done every day in nooks and corners, and in little households, and in men’s and women’s hearts—any one of which might reconcile the sternest man to such a world, and fill him with belief and hope in it, though two-fourths of its people were at war, and another fourth at law; and that’s a bold word.’  Both the sisters listened keenly.  ‘Well, well!’ said the Doctor, ‘I am too old to be converted, even by my friend Snitchey here, or my good spinster sister, Martha Jeddler; who had what she calls her domestic trials ages ago, and has led a sympathising life with all sorts of people ever since; and who is so much of your opinion (only she’s less reasonable and more obstinate, being a woman), that we can’t agree, and seldom meet.  I was born upon this battle-field. I began, as a boy, to have my thoughts directed to the real history of a battle-field.  Sixty years have gone over my head, and I have never seen the Christian world, including Heaven knows how many loving mothers and good enough girls like mine here, anything but mad for a battle-field. The same contradictions prevail in everything.  One must either laugh or cry at such stupendous inconsistencies; and I prefer to laugh.’  Britain, who had been paying the profoundest and most melancholy attention to each speaker in his turn, seemed suddenly to decide in favour of the same preference, if a deep sepulchral sound that escaped him might be construed into a demonstration of risibility.  His face, however, was so perfectly unaffected by it, both before and afterwards, that although one or two of the breakfast party looked round as being startled by a mysterious noise, nobody connected the offender with it.  Except his partner in attendance, Clemency Newcome; who rousing him with one of those favourite joints, her elbows, inquired, in a reproachful whisper, what he laughed at.  ‘Not you!’ said Britain.  ‘Who then?’  ‘Humanity,’ said Britain.  ‘That’s the joke!’  ‘What between master and them lawyers, he’s getting more and more addle-headed every day!’ cried Clemency, giving him a lunge with the other elbow, as a mental stimulant.  ‘Do you know where you are?  Do you want to get warning?’  ‘I don’t know anything,’ said Britain, with a leaden eye and an immovable visage.  ‘I don’t care for anything.  I don’t make out anything.  I don’t believe anything.  And I don’t want anything.’  Although this forlorn summary of his general condition may have been overcharged in an access of despondency, Benjamin Britain—sometimes called Little Britain, to distinguish him from Great; as we might say Young England, to express Old England with a decided difference—had defined his real state more accurately than might be supposed.  For, serving as a sort of man Miles to the Doctor’s Friar Bacon, and listening day after day to innumerable orations addressed by the Doctor to various people, all tending to show that his very existence was at best a mistake and an absurdity, this unfortunate servitor had fallen, by degrees, into such an abyss of confused and contradictory suggestions from within and without, that Truth at the bottom of her well, was on the level surface as compared with Britain in the depths of his mystification.  The only point he clearly comprehended, was, that the new element usually brought into these discussions by Snitchey and Craggs, never served to make them clearer, and always seemed to give the Doctor a species of advantage and confirmation.  Therefore, he looked upon the Firm as one of the proximate causes of his state of mind, and held them in abhorrence accordingly.  ‘But, this is not our business, Alfred,’ said the Doctor.  ‘Ceasing to be my ward (as you have said) to-day; and leaving us full to the brim of such learning as the Grammar School down here was able to give you, and your studies in London could add to that, and such practical knowledge as a dull old country Doctor like myself could graft upon both; you are away, now, into the world.  The first term of probation appointed by your poor father, being over, away you go now, your own master, to fulfil his second desire.  And long before your three years’ tour among the foreign schools of medicine is finished, you’ll have forgotten us.  Lord, you’ll forget us easily in six months!’  ‘If I do—But you know better; why should I speak to you!’ said Alfred, laughing.  ‘I don’t know anything of the sort,’ returned the Doctor.  ‘What do you say, Marion?’  Marion, trifling with her teacup, seemed to say—but she didn’t say it—that he was welcome to forget, if he could.  Grace pressed the blooming face against her cheek, and smiled.  ‘I haven’t been, I hope, a very unjust steward in the execution of my trust,’ pursued the Doctor; ‘but I am to be, at any rate, formally discharged, and released, and what not this morning; and here are our good friends Snitchey and Craggs, with a bagful of papers, and accounts, and documents, for the transfer of the balance of the trust fund to you (I wish it was a more difficult one to dispose of, Alfred, but you must get to be a great man and make it so), and other drolleries of that sort, which are to be signed, sealed, and delivered.’  ‘And duly witnessed as by law required,’ said Snitchey, pushing away his plate, and taking out the papers, which his partner proceeded to spread upon the table; ‘and Self and Craggs having been co-trustees with you, Doctor, in so far as the fund was concerned, we shall want your two servants to attest the signatures—can you read, Mrs. Newcome?’  ‘I an’t married, Mister,’ said Clemency.  ‘Oh!  I beg your pardon.  I should think not,’ chuckled Snitchey, casting his eyes over her extraordinary figure.  ‘You _can_ read?’  ‘A little,’ answered Clemency.  ‘The marriage service, night and morning, eh?’ observed the lawyer, jocosely.  ‘No,’ said Clemency.  ‘Too hard.  I only reads a thimble.’  ‘Read a thimble!’ echoed Snitchey.  ‘What are you talking about, young woman?’  Clemency nodded.  ‘And a nutmeg-grater.’  ‘Why, this is a lunatic! a subject for the Lord High Chancellor!’ said Snitchey, staring at her.  —‘If possessed of any property,’ stipulated Craggs.  Grace, however, interposing, explained that each of the articles in question bore an engraved motto, and so formed the pocket library of Clemency Newcome, who was not much given to the study of books.  ‘Oh, that’s it, is it, Miss Grace!’ said Snitchey.  ‘Yes, yes.  Ha, ha, ha!  I thought our friend was an idiot.  She looks uncommonly like it,’ he muttered, with a supercilious glance.  ‘And what does the thimble say, Mrs. Newcome?’  ‘I an’t married, Mister,’ observed Clemency.  ‘Well, Newcome.  Will that do?’ said the lawyer.  ‘What does the thimble say, Newcome?’  How Clemency, before replying to this question, held one pocket open, and looked down into its yawning depths for the thimble which wasn’t there,—and how she then held an opposite pocket open, and seeming to descry it, like a pearl of great price, at the bottom, cleared away such intervening obstacles as a handkerchief, an end of wax candle, a flushed apple, an orange, a lucky penny, a cramp bone, a padlock, a pair of scissors in a sheath more expressively describable as promising young shears, a handful or so of loose beads, several balls of cotton, a needle-case, a cabinet collection of curl-papers, and a biscuit, all of which articles she entrusted individually and separately to Britain to hold,—is of no consequence.  Nor how, in her determination to grasp this pocket by the throat and keep it prisoner (for it had a tendency to swing, and twist itself round the nearest corner), she assumed and calmly maintained, an attitude apparently inconsistent with the human anatomy and the laws of gravity. It is enough that at last she triumphantly produced the thimble on her finger, and rattled the nutmeg-grater: the literature of both those trinkets being obviously in course of wearing out and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/676"],["title","The Battle of Life (#4)"],["body","away, through excessive friction.  ‘That’s the thimble, is it, young woman?’ said Mr. Snitchey, diverting himself at her expense.  ‘And what does the thimble say?’  ‘It says,’ replied Clemency, reading slowly round as if it were a tower, ‘For-get and For-give.’  Snitchey and Craggs laughed heartily.  ‘So new!’ said Snitchey.  ‘So easy!’ said Craggs.  ‘Such a knowledge of human nature in it!’ said Snitchey.  ‘So applicable to the affairs of life!’ said Craggs.  ‘And the nutmeg-grater?’ inquired the head of the Firm.  ‘The grater says,’ returned Clemency, ‘Do as you—wold—be—done by.’  ‘Do, or you’ll be done brown, you mean,’ said Mr. Snitchey.  ‘I don’t understand,’ retorted Clemency, shaking her head vaguely.  ‘I an’t no lawyer.’  ‘I am afraid that if she was, Doctor,’ said Mr. Snitchey, turning to him suddenly, as if to anticipate any effect that might otherwise be consequent on this retort, ‘she’d find it to be the golden rule of half her clients.  They are serious enough in that—whimsical as your world is—and lay the blame on us afterwards.  We, in our profession, are little else than mirrors after all, Mr. Alfred; but, we are generally consulted by angry and quarrelsome people who are not in their best looks, and it’s rather hard to quarrel with us if we reflect unpleasant aspects.  I think,’ said Mr. Snitchey, ‘that I speak for Self and Craggs?’  ‘Decidedly,’ said Craggs.  ‘And so, if Mr. Britain will oblige us with a mouthful of ink,’ said Mr. Snitchey, returning to the papers, ‘we’ll sign, seal, and deliver as soon as possible, or the coach will be coming past before we know where we are.’  If one might judge from his appearance, there was every probability of the coach coming past before Mr. Britain knew where _he_ was; for he stood in a state of abstraction, mentally balancing the Doctor against the lawyers, and the lawyers against the Doctor, and their clients against both, and engaged in feeble attempts to make the thimble and nutmeg-grater (a new idea to him) square with anybody’s system of philosophy; and, in short, bewildering himself as much as ever his great namesake has done with theories and schools.  But, Clemency, who was his good Genius—though he had the meanest possible opinion of her understanding, by reason of her seldom troubling herself with abstract speculations, and being always at hand to do the right thing at the right time—having produced the ink in a twinkling, tendered him the further service of recalling him to himself by the application of her elbows; with which gentle flappers she so jogged his memory, in a more literal construction of that phrase than usual, that he soon became quite fresh and brisk.  How he laboured under an apprehension not uncommon to persons in his degree, to whom the use of pen and ink is an event, that he couldn’t append his name to a document, not of his own writing, without committing himself in some shadowy manner, or somehow signing away vague and enormous sums of money; and how he approached the deeds under protest, and by dint of the Doctor’s coercion, and insisted on pausing to look at them before writing (the cramped hand, to say nothing of the phraseology, being so much Chinese to him), and also on turning them round to see whether there was anything fraudulent underneath; and how, having signed his name, he became desolate as one who had parted with his property and rights; I want the time to tell.  Also, how the blue bag containing his signature, afterwards had a mysterious interest for him, and he couldn’t leave it; also, how Clemency Newcome, in an ecstasy of laughter at the idea of her own importance and dignity, brooded over the whole table with her two elbows, like a spread eagle, and reposed her head upon her left arm as a preliminary to the formation of certain cabalistic characters, which required a deal of ink, and imaginary counterparts whereof she executed at the same time with her tongue.  Also, how, having once tasted ink, she became thirsty in that regard, as tame tigers are said to be after tasting another sort of fluid, and wanted to sign everything, and put her name in all kinds of places.  In brief, the Doctor was discharged of his trust and all its responsibilities; and Alfred, taking it on himself, was fairly started on the journey of life.  ‘Britain!’ said the Doctor.  ‘Run to the gate, and watch for the coach. Time flies, Alfred.’  ‘Yes, sir, yes,’ returned the young man, hurriedly.  ‘Dear Grace! a moment!  Marion—so young and beautiful, so winning and so much admired, dear to my heart as nothing else in life is—remember!  I leave Marion to you!’  ‘She has always been a sacred charge to me, Alfred.  She is doubly so, now.  I will be faithful to my trust, believe me.’  ‘I do believe it, Grace.  I know it well.  Who could look upon your face, and hear your voice, and not know it!  Ah, Grace!  If I had your well-governed heart, and tranquil mind, how bravely I would leave this place to-day!’  ‘Would you?’ she answered with a quiet smile.  ‘And yet, Grace—Sister, seems the natural word.’  ‘Use it!’ she said quickly.  ‘I am glad to hear it.  Call me nothing else.’  ‘And yet, sister, then,’ said Alfred, ‘Marion and I had better have your true and steadfast qualities serving us here, and making us both happier and better.  I wouldn’t carry them away, to sustain myself, if I could!’  ‘Coach upon the hill-top!’ exclaimed Britain.  ‘Time flies, Alfred,’ said the Doctor.  Marion had stood apart, with her eyes fixed upon the ground; but, this warning being given, her young lover brought her tenderly to where her sister stood, and gave her into her embrace.  ‘I have been telling Grace, dear Marion,’ he said, ‘that you are her charge; my precious trust at parting.  And when I come back and reclaim you, dearest, and the bright prospect of our married life lies stretched before us, it shall be one of our chief pleasures to consult how we can make Grace happy; how we can anticipate her wishes; how we can show our gratitude and love to her; how we can return her something of the debt she will have heaped upon us.’  The younger sister had one hand in his; the other rested on her sister’s neck.  She looked into that sister’s eyes, so calm, serene, and cheerful, with a gaze in which affection, admiration, sorrow, wonder, almost veneration, were blended.  She looked into that sister’s face, as if it were the face of some bright angel.  Calm, serene, and cheerful, the face looked back on her and on her lover.  ‘And when the time comes, as it must one day,’ said Alfred,—‘I wonder it has never come yet, but Grace knows best, for Grace is always right—when _she_ will want a friend to open her whole heart to, and to be to her something of what she has been to us—then, Marion, how faithful we will prove, and what delight to us to know that she, our dear good sister, loves and is loved again, as we would have her!’  Still the younger sister looked into her eyes, and turned not—even towards him.  And still those honest eyes looked back, so calm, serene, and cheerful, on herself and on her lover.  ‘And when all that is past, and we are old, and living (as we must!) together—close together—talking often of old times,’ said Alfred—‘these shall be our favourite times among them—this day most of all; and, telling each other what we thought and felt, and hoped and feared at parting; and how we couldn’t bear to say good bye—’  ‘Coach coming through the wood!’ cried Britain.  ‘Yes!  I am ready—and how we met again, so happily in spite of all; we’ll make this day the happiest in all the year, and keep it as a treble birth-day.  Shall we, dear?’  ‘Yes!’ interposed the elder sister, eagerly, and with a radiant smile. ‘Yes!  Alfred, don’t linger.  There’s no time.  Say good bye to Marion. And Heaven be with you!’  He pressed the younger sister to his heart.  Released from his embrace, she again clung to her sister; and her eyes, with the same blended look, again sought those so calm, serene, and cheerful.  ‘Farewell, my boy!’ said the Doctor.  ‘To talk about any serious correspondence or serious affections, and engagements and so forth, in such a—ha ha ha!—you know what I mean—why that, of course, would be sheer nonsense.  All I can say is, that if you and Marion should continue in the same foolish minds, I shall not object to have you for a son-in-law one of these days.’  ‘Over the bridge!’ cried Britain.  ‘Let it come!’ said Alfred, wringing the Doctor’s hand stoutly.  ‘Think of me sometimes, my old friend and guardian, as seriously as you can! Adieu, Mr. Snitchey!  Farewell, Mr. Craggs!’  ‘Coming down the road!’ cried Britain.  ‘A kiss of Clemency Newcome for long acquaintance’ sake!  Shake hands, Britain!  Marion, dearest heart, good bye!  Sister Grace! remember!’  The quiet household figure, and the face so beautiful in its serenity, were turned towards him in reply; but Marion’s look and attitude remained unchanged.  The coach was at the gate.  There was a bustle with the luggage.  The coach drove away.  Marion never moved.  ‘He waves his hat to you, my love,’ said Grace.  ‘Your chosen husband, darling.  Look!’  The younger sister raised her head, and, for a moment, turned it.  Then, turning back again, and fully meeting, for the first time, those calm eyes, fell sobbing on her neck.  ‘Oh, Grace.  God bless you!  But I cannot bear to see it, Grace!  It breaks my heart.’     Part the Second   SNITCHEY AND CRAGGS had a snug little office on the old Battle Ground, where they drove a snug little business, and fought a great many small pitched battles for a great many contending parties.  Though it could hardly be said of these conflicts that they were running fights—for in truth they generally proceeded at a snail’s pace—the part the Firm had in them came so far within the general denomination, that now they took a shot at this Plaintiff, and now aimed a chop at that Defendant, now made a heavy charge at an estate in Chancery, and now had some light"]]]
