What for?”  “If I bring little money.”  “Does he beat you hard?”  “Si, signor, with a stick.”  “He must be a bad man,” said Henry, indignantly.  “How much money must you carry home?”  “Two dollars.”  “But it isn’t your fault, if people will not give you money.”  “Non importa. He beat me.”  “He ought to be beaten himself.”  Phil shrugged his shoulders. Like most boys of his class, to him the padrone seemed all-powerful. The idea that his oppressive taskmaster should be punished for his cruelty had never dawned upon him. Knowing nothing of any law that would protect him, he submitted to it as a necessity, from which there was no escape except by running away. He had not come to that yet, but some of his companions had done so, and he might some day.  After this conversation he played another tune. Mrs. Leigh drew out her purse, and gave him fifty cents. Phil took his fiddle under his arm, and, following the servant, who now reappeared, emerged into the street, and moved onward.    CHAPTER II  PHIL AND HIS PROTECTOR  To a certain extent Phil was his own master; that is, he was at liberty to wander where he liked, provided he did not neglect his business, and returned to the lodging-house at night with the required sum of money. But woe to him if he were caught holding back any of the money for his own use. In that case, he would be beaten, and sent to bed without his supper, while the padrone, according to the terms of his contract with the distant parent would withhold from the amount due the latter ten times the sum kept by the boy. In the middle of the day he was allowed to spend three cents for bread, which was the only dinner allowed him. Of course, the boys were tempted to regale themselves more luxuriously, but they incurred a great risk in doing so. Sometimes the padrone followed them secretly, or employed others to do so, and so was able to detect them. Besides, they traveled, in general, by twos and threes, and the system of espionage was encouraged by the padrone. So mutual distrust was inspired, and the fear of being reported made the boys honest.  Phil left the house of Mr. Leigh in good spirits. Though he had earned nothing before, the fifty cents he had just received made a good beginning, and inspired in him the hope of getting together enough to save him a beating, for one night at least.  He walked down toward Sixth Avenue, and turning the corner walked down town. At length he paused in front of a tobacconist’s shop, and began to play. But he had chosen an unfortunate time and place. The tobacconist had just discovered a deficiency in his money account, which he suspected to be occasioned by the dishonesty of his assistant. In addition to this he had risen with a headache, so that he was in a decidedly bad humor. Music had no charms for him at that moment, and he no sooner heard the first strains of Phil’s violin than he rushed from the shop bareheaded, and dashed impetuously at the young fiddler.  “Get away from my shop, you little vagabond!” he cried. “If I had my way, you should all be sent out of the country.”  Phil was quick to take a hint. He saw the menace in the shopkeeper’s eyes, and, stopping abruptly, ran farther down the street, hugging his fiddle, which he was afraid the angry tobacconist might seize and break. This, to him, would be an irreparable misfortune and subject him to a severe punishment, though the fault would not be his.  Next he strolled into a side street, and began to play in front of some dwelling-houses. Two or three young children, who had been playing in the street, gathered about him, and one of them gave him a penny. They were clamorous for another tune, but Phil could not afford to work for nothing, and, seeing no prospects of additional pay, took his violin, and walked away, much to the regret of his young auditors, who, though not rich, were appreciative. They followed him to the end of the block, hoping that he would play again, but they were disappointed.  Phil played two or three times more, managing to obtain in all twenty-five cents additional. He reached the corner of Thirteenth Street just as the large public school, known as the Thirteenth Street School, was dismissed for its noon intermission.  “Give us a tune, Johnny,” cried Edward Eustis, one of the oldest boys.  “Yes, a tune,” joined in several others.  This was an invitation to which Phil was always willing to respond. Besides, he knew from experience that boys were more generous, in proportion to their means, than those of larger growth, and he hoped to get enough from the crowd around him to increase his store to a dollar.  The boys gathered around the little minstrel, who struck up an Italian tune, but without the words.  “Sing, sing!” cried the boys.  Phil began to sing. His clear, fresh voice produced a favorable impression upon the boys.  “He’s a bully singer,” said one. “I can’t sing much better myself.”  “You sing! Your singing would be enough to scare a dozen tom cats.”  “Then we should be well matched. Look here, Johnny, can’t you sing something in English?”  Phil, in response to this request, played and sang “Shoo Fly!” which suiting the boys’ taste, he was called upon to repeat.  The song being finished, Edward Eustis took off his cap, and went around the circle.  “Now, boys, you have a chance to show your liberality,” he said. “I’ll start the collection with five cents.”  “That’s ahead of me,” said James Marcus. “Justice to a large and expensive family will prevent me contributing anything more than two cents.”  “The smallest favors thankfully received,” said Edward.  “Then take that, and be thankful,” said Tom Lane, dropping in a penny.  “I haven’t got any money,” said Frank Gaylord, “but here’s an apple;”  and he dropped a large red apple into the cap.  Phil; watching with interest the various contributions, was best pleased with the last. The money he must carry to the padrone. The apple he might keep for himself, and it would vary agreeably his usual meager fare.  “The biggest contribution yet,” said Edward.  “Here, Sprague, you are liberal. What’ll you give?”  “My note at ninety days.”  “You might fail before it comes due.”  “Then take three cents. ‘Tis all I have; ‘I can no more, though poor the offering be.’”  “Oh, don’t quote Shakespeare.”  “It isn’t Shakespeare; it’s Milton.”  “Just as much one as the other.”  “Here, Johnny,” said Edward, after going the rounds, “hold your hands, and I’ll pour out the money. You can retire from business now on a fortune.”  Phil was accustomed to be addressed as Johnny, that being the generic name for boy in New York. He deposited the money in his pocket, and, taking his fiddle, played once more in acknowledgment of the donation. The boys now dispersed, leaving Phil to go on his way. He took out the apple with the intention of eating it, when a rude boy snatched it from his hand.  “Give it back,” said Phil, angrily.  “Don’t you wish you may get it?” said the other, holding it out of his reach.  The young musician had little chance of redress, his antagonist was a head taller than himself, and, besides, he would not have dared lay down his fiddle to fight, lest it might be broken.  “Give it to me,” he said, stamping his foot.  “I mean to eat it myself,” said the other, coolly. “It’s too good for the likes of you.”  “You’re a thief.”  “Don’t you call me names, you little Italian ragamuffin, or I’ll hit you,” said the other, menacingly.  “It is my apple.”  “I’m going to eat it.”  But the speaker was mistaken. As he held the apple above his head, it was suddenly snatched from him. He looked around angrily, and confronted Edward Eustis, who, seeing Phil’s trouble from a little distance, had at once come to his rescue.  “What did you do that for?” demanded the thief.  “What did you take the boy’s apple for?”  “Because I felt like it.”  “Then I took it from you for the same reason.”  “Do you want to fight?” blustered the rowdy.  “Not particularly.”  “Then hand me back that apple,” returned the other.  “Thank you; I shall only hand it to the rightful owner--that little Italian boy. Are you not ashamed to rob him?”  “Do you want to get hit?”  “I wouldn’t advise you to do it.”  The rowdy looked at the boy who confronted him. Edward was slightly smaller, but there was a determined look in his eye which the bully, who, like those of his class generally, was a coward at heart, did not like. He mentally decided that it would be safer not to provoke him.  “Come here, Johnny, and take your apple,” said Edward.  Phil advanced, and received back his property with satisfaction.  “You’d better eat it now. I’ll see that he doesn’t disturb you.”  Phil followed the advice of his new friend promptly. He had eaten nothing since seven o’clock, and then only a piece of dry bread and cheese, and the apple, a rare luxury, he did not fail to relish. His would-be robber scowled at him meanwhile, for he had promised himself the pleasure of dispatching the fruit. Edward stood by till the apple was eaten, and then turned away. The rowdy made a movement as if to follow Phil, but Edward quickly detected him, and came back.  “Don’t you dare touch him,” he said, significantly, “or you’ll have to settle accounts with me. Do you see that policeman? I am going to ask him to have an eye on you. You’d better look out for yourself.”  The other turned at the caution, and seeing the approach of one of the Metropolitan police quickly vanished. He had a wholesome fear of these guardians of the public peace, and did not care to court their attention.  Edward turned away, but in a moment felt a hand tugging at his coat.

I am glad I was by to save you from that bully.”    CHAPTER III  GIACOMO  After eating the apple Phil decided to buy his frugal dinner. He, therefore, went into a baker’s shop, and bought two penny rolls and a piece of cheese. It was not a very luxurious repast, but with the apple it was better than usual. A few steps from the shop door he met another Italian boy, who was bound to the same padrone.  “How much money have you, Giacomo?” asked Phil, speaking, of course, in his native tongue.  “Forty cents. How much have you?”  “A dollar and twenty cents.”  “You are very lucky, Filippo.”  “A rich signora gave me fifty cents for playing to her sick boy. Then I sang for some schoolboys, and they gave me some money.”  “I am afraid the padrone will beat me to-night.”  “He has not beat me for a week.”  “Have you had dinner, Filippo?”  “Yes, I had some bread and cheese, and an apple.”  “Did you buy the apple?”  “No; one of the schoolboys gave it to me. It was very good,” said Phil, in a tone of enjoyment. “I had not eaten one for a long time.”  “Nor I. Do you remember, Filippo, the oranges we had in Italy?”  “I remember them well.”  “I was happy then,” said Giacomo, sighing. “There was no padrone to beat me, and I could run about and play. Now I have to sing and play all day. I am so tired sometimes,--so tired, Filippo.”  “You are not so strong as I, Giacomo,” said Phil, looking with some complacency at his own stout limbs.  “Don’t you get tired, Filippo?”  “Yes, often; but I don’t care so much for that. But I don’t like the winter.”  “I thought I should die with cold sometimes last winter,” said Giacomo, shuddering. “Do you ever expect to go back to Italy, Filippo?”  “Sometime.”  “I wish I could go now. I should like to see my dear mother and my sisters.”  “And your father?”  “I don’t want to see him,” said Giacomo, bitterly. “He sold me to the padrone. My mother wept bitterly when I went away, but my father only thought of the money.”  Filippo and Giacomo were from the same town in Calabria. They were the sons of Italian peasants who had been unable to resist the offers of the padrone, and for less than a hundred dollars each had sold his son into the cruelest slavery. The boys were torn from their native hills, from their families, and in a foreign land were doomed to walk the streets from fourteen to sixteen hours in every twenty-four, gathering money from which they received small benefit. Many times, as they trudged through the streets, weary and hungry, sometimes cold, they thought with homesick sadness of the sunny fields in which their earliest years had been passed, but the hard realities of the life they were now leading soon demanded their attention.  Naturally light-hearted, Filippo, or Phil, bore his hard lot more cheerfully than some of his comrades. But Giacomo was more delicate, and less able to bear want and fatigue. His livelier comrade cheered him up, and Giacomo always felt better after talking with Phil.  As the two boys were walking together, a heavy hand was laid on the shoulder of each, and a harsh voice said: “Is this the way you waste your time, little rascals?”  Both boys started, and looking up, recognized the padrone. He was a short man, very dark with fierce black eyes and a sinister countenance. It was his habit to walk about the streets from time to time, and keep a watch, unobserved, upon his young apprentices, if they may be so called. If he found them loitering about, or neglecting their work, they were liable to receive a sharp reminder.  The boys were both startled at his sudden appearance, but after the first start, Phil, who was naturally courageous, recovered his self-possession. Not so with Giacomo, who was the more afraid because he knew he had gained but little money thus far.  “We are not wasting our time, padrone,” said Phil, looking up fearlessly.  “We will see about that. How long have you been together?”  “Only five minutes.”  “How much money have you, Filippo?”  “A dollar and twenty cents.”  “Good; you have done well. And how is it with you, Giacomo?”  “I have forty cents.”  “Then you have been idle,” said the padrone, frowning.  “No, signore,” said the boy, trembling. “I have played, but they did not give me much money.”  “It is not his fault,” said Phil, coming boldly to the defense of his friend.  “Attend to your own affairs, little scrape-grace,” said the padrone, roughly. “He might have got as much as you.”  “No, padrone; I was lucky. A kind lady gave me fifty cents.”  “That is not my affair. I don’t care where you get the money. But if you don’t bring home all I expect, you shall feel the stick.”  These last words were addressed to Giacomo, who understood their import only too well. In the miserable lodging where he herded with thirty or forty others scarcely a night passed without the brutal punishment of one or more unfortunate boys, who had been unsuccessful in bringing home enough to satisfy the rapacity of the padrone. But of this an account will hereafter be given.  “Now, go to work, both of you,” said the padrone, harshly.  The two boys separated. Giacomo went uptown, while Phil kept on his way toward the Astor House. The padrone made his way to the nearest liquor shop, where he invested a portion of the money wrung from the hard earnings of his young apprentices.  Toward the close of the afternoon Phil found himself in front of the Astor House. He had played several times, but was not fortunate in finding liberal auditors. He had secured but ten cents during this time, and it seemed doubtful whether he would reach the sum he wanted. He crossed over to the City Hall Park, and, feeling tired, sat down on one of the benches. Two bootblacks were already seated upon it.  “Play us a tune, Johnny,” said one.  “Will you give me pennies?” asked Phil doubtfully, for he did not care, with such a severe taskmaster, to work for nothing.  “Yes, we’ll give you pennies.”  Upon this, Phil struck up a tune.  “Where’s your monkey?” asked one of the boys.  “I have no monkey.”  “If you want a monkey, here’s one for you,” said Tim Rafferty, putting his hand on his companion’s shoulder.  “He’s too big,” said Phil, laughing.  “Hould yer gab, Tim Rafferty,” said the other. “It’s you that’ll make a better monkey nor I. Say, Johnny, do you pay your monkeys well?”  “Give me my pennies,” said Phil, with an eye to business.  “Play another tune, then.”  Phil obeyed directions. When he had finished, a contribution was taken up, but it only amounted to seven cents. However, considering the character of the audience, this was as much as could be expected.  “How much have you made to-day, Johnny?” asked Tim.  “A dollar,” said Phil.  “A dollar! That’s more nor I have made. I tell you what, boys, I think I’ll buy a fiddle myself. I’ll make more money that way than blackin’ boots.”  “A great fiddler you’d make, Tim Rafferty.”  “Can’t I play, then? Lend me your fiddle, Johnny, till I try it a little.”  Phil shook his head.  “Give it to me now; I won’t be hurtin’ it.”  “You’ll break it.”  “Then I’ll pay for it.”  “It isn’t mine.”  “Whose is it, then?”  “The padrone’s.”  “And who’s the padrone?”  “The man I live with. If the fiddle is broken, he will beat me.”  “Then he’s an ould haythen, and you may tell him so, with Tim Rafferty’s compliments. But I won’t hurt it.”  Phil, however, feared to trust the violin in unskillful hands. He knew the penalty if any harm befell it, and he had no mind to run the risk. So he rose from the seat, and withdrew to a little distance, Tim Rafferty following, for, though he cared little at first, he now felt determined to try the fiddle.  “If you don’t give it to me I’ll put a head on you,” he said.  “You shall not have it,” said Phil, firmly, for he, too, could be determined.  “The little chap’s showing fight,” said Tim’s companion. “Look out, Tim; he’ll mash you.”  “I can fight him wid one hand,” said Tim.  He advanced upon our young hero, who, being much smaller, would probably have been compelled to yield to superior force but for an interference entirely unexpected by Tim.    CHAPTER IV  AN INVITATION TO SUPPER  Tim had raised his fist to strike the young fiddler, when he was suddenly pushed aside with considerable force, and came near measuring his length on the ground.  “Who did that?” he cried, angrily, recovering his equilibrium.  “I did it,” said a calm voice.  Tim recognized in the speaker Paul Hoffman, whom some of my readers will remember as “Paul the Peddler.” Paul was proprietor of a necktie stand below the Astor House, and was just returning home to supper.  He was a brave and manly boy, and his sympathies were always in favor of the oppressed. He had met Phil before, and talked with him, and seeing him in danger came to his assistance.  “What made you push me?” demanded Tim, fiercely.  “What were you going to do to him?” rejoined Paul, indicating the Italian boy.  “I was only goin’ to borrer his fiddle.”  “He would have broken it,” said Phil.  “You don’t know how to play,” said Paul. “You would have broken his fiddle, and then he would be beaten.”  “I would pay for it if I did,” said Tim.  “You say so, but you wouldn’t. Even if you did, it would take time, and the boy would have suffered.”  “What business is that of yours?” demanded Tim, angrily.  “It is always my business when I see a big boy teasing a little one.”  “You’ll get hurt some day,” said Tim, suddenly.  “Not by you,” returned Paul, not particularly alarmed.  Tim would have gladly have punished Paul on the spot for his interference, but he did not consider it prudent to provoke hostilities. Paul was as tall as himself, and considerably stronger. He therefore wisely confined himself to threatening words.  “Come along with me, Phil,” said Paul, kindly, to the little fiddler.  “Thank you for saving me,” said Phil, gratefully. “The padrone would beat "]]]
