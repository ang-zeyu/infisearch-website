Quit the room, and send Agatha here.\"  \"She has left, madam, and so has the cook, and Martha went away behind Benjamin; when I leave, you will be alone.\"  \"They have dared to leave?\"  \"They dared not stay, madam.\"  \"Leave me, Jacob Armitage, and shut the door when you go out.\" Jacob still hesitated. \"Obey me instantly,\" said the old lady; and the forester, finding all remonstrance useless, went out, and obeyed her last commands by shutting the door after him.  Jacob found Agatha and the other maid in the court-yard; he took up their packages, and, as he promised, accompanied them to Gossip Allwood, who kept a small ale-house about a mile distant.  \"But, mercy on us! what will become of the children?\" said Agatha, as they walked along, her fears for herself having up to this time made her utterly forgetful of them. \"Poor things! and Martha has left them.\"  \"Yes, indeed; what will become of the dear babes?\" said the cook, half crying.  Now Jacob, knowing that the children of such a Malignant as Colonel Beverley would have sorry treatment if discovered, and knowing also that women were not always to be trusted, determined not to tell them how they were disposed of. He therefore replied,  \"Who would hurt such young children as those? No, no, they are safe enough; even the troopers would protect them.\"  \"I should hope so,\" replied Agatha.  \"You may be sure of that; no man would hurt babies,\" replied Jacob. \"The troopers will take them with them to Lymington, I suppose. I've no fear for them; it's the proud old lady whom they will be uncivil to.\"  The conversation here ended, and in due time they arrived at the inn. Jacob had just put the bundles down on the table, when the clattering of horses' hoofs was heard. Shortly afterward, the troopers pulled their horses up at the door, and dismounted. Jacob recognized the party he had met in the forest, and among them Southwold. The troopers called for ale, and remained some time in the house, talking and laughing with the women, especially Agatha, who was a very good-looking girl. Jacob would have retreated quietly, but he found a sentinel posted at the door to prevent the egress of any person. He reseated himself, and while he was listening to the conversation of the troopers he was recognized by Southwold, who accosted him. Jacob did not pretend not to know him, as it would have been useless; and Southwold put many questions to him as to who were resident at Arnwood. Jacob replied that the children were there, and a few servants, and he was about to mention Miss Judith Villiers, when a thought struck him--he might save the old lady.  \"You are going to Arnwood, I know,\" said Jacob, \"and I have heard who you are in search of. Well, Southwold, I'll give you a hint. I may be wrong; but if you should fall in with an old lady or something like one when you go to Arnwood, mount her on your crupper and away with her to Lymington as fast as you can ride. You understand me?\" Southwold nodded significantly, and squeezed Jacob's hand.  \"One word, Jacob Armitage; if I succeed in the capture by your means, it is but fair that you should have something for your hint. Where can I find you the day after to-morrow?\"  \"I am leaving the country this night, and I must go. I am in trouble, that's the fact; when all is blown over, I will find you out. Don't speak to me any more just now.\" Southwold again squeezed Jacob's hand, and left him. Shortly afterward the order was given to mount, and the troopers set off.  Armitage followed slowly and unobserved. They arrive at the mansion and surrounded it. Shortly afterward he perceived the glare of torches, and in a quarter of an hour more thick smoke rose up in the dark but clear sky; at last the flames burst forth from the lower windows of the mansion, and soon afterward they lighted up the country round to some distance.  \"It is done,\" thought Jacob; and he turned to bend his hasty steps toward his own cottage, when he heard the galloping of a horse and violent screams; a minute afterward James Southwold passed him with the old lady tied behind him, kicking and struggling as hard as she could. Jacob smiled as he thought that he had by his little stratagem saved the old woman's life, for that Southwold imagined that she was King Charles dressed up as an old woman was evident; and he then returned as fast as he could to the cottage.  In half an hour Jacob had passed through the thick woods which were between the mansion and his own cottage, occasionally looking back, as the flames of the mansion rose higher and higher, throwing their light far and wide. He knocked at the cottage-door; Smoker, a large dog cross-bred between the fox and blood-hound, growled till Jacob spoke to him, and then Edward opened the door.  \"My sisters are in bed and fast asleep, Jacob,\" said Edward, \"and Humphrey has been nodding this half hour; had he not better go to bed before we go back?\"  \"Come out, Master Edward,\" replied Jacob, \"and look.\" Edward beheld the flames and fierce light between the trees and was silent.  \"I told you that it would be so, and you would all have been burned in your beds, for they did not enter the house to see who was in it, but fired it as soon as they had surrounded it.\"  \"And my aunt!\" exclaimed Edward, clasping his hands.  \"Is safe, Master Edward, and by this time at Lymington.\"  \"We will go to her to-morrow.\"  \"I fear not; you must not risk so much, Master Edward. These Levelers spare nobody, and you had better let it be supposed that you are all burned in the house.\"  \"But my aunt knows the contrary, Jacob.\"  \"Very true; I quite forgot that.\" And so Jacob had. He expected that the old woman would have been burned, and then nobody would have known of the existence of the children; he forgot, when he planned to save her, that she knew where the children were.  \"Well, Master Edward, I will go to Lymington to-morrow and see the old lady; but you must remain here, and take charge of your sisters till I come back, and then we will consider what is to be done. The flames are not so bright as they were.\"  \"No. It is my house that these Roundheads have burned down,\" said Edward, shaking his fist.  \"It was your house, Master Edward, and it was your property, but how long it will be so remains to be seen. I fear that it will be forfeited.\"  \"Woe to the people who dare take possession of it!\" cried Edward; \"I shall, if I live, be a man one of these days.\"  \"Yes, Master Edward, and then you will reflect more than you do now, and not be rash. Let us go into the cottage, for it's no use remaining out in the cold; the frost is sharp to-night.\"  Edward slowly followed Jacob into the cottage. His little heart was full. He was a proud boy and a good boy, but the destruction of the mansion had raised up evil thoughts in his heart--hatred to the Covenanters, who had killed his father and now burned the property--revenge upon them (how he knew not); but his hand was ready to strike, young as he was. He lay down on the bed, but he could not sleep. He turned and turned again, and his brain was teeming with thoughts and plans of vengeance. Had he said his prayers that night he would have been obliged to repeat, \"Forgive us as we forgive them who trespass against us.\" At last, he fell fast asleep, but his dreams were wild, and he often called out during the night and woke his brother and sisters.     CHAPTER III.   The next morning, as soon as Jacob had given the children their breakfast, he set off toward Arnwood. He knew that Benjamin had stated his intention to return with the horse and see what had taken place, and he knew him well enough to feel sure that he would do so. He thought it better to see him if possible, and ascertain the fate of Miss Judith. Jacob arrived at the still smoking ruins of the mansion, and found several people there, mostly residents within a few miles, some attracted by curiosity, others busy in collecting the heavy masses of lead which had been melted from the roof, and appropriating them to their own benefit; but much of it was still too hot to be touched, and they were throwing snow on it to cool it, for it had snowed during the night. At last, Jacob perceived Benjamin on horseback riding leisurely toward him, and immediately went up to him.  \"Well, Benjamin, this is a woeful sight. What is the news from Lymington?\"  \"Lymington is full of troopers, and they are not over-civil,\" replied Benjamin. \"And the old lady--where is she?\"  \"Ah, that's a sad business,\" replied Benjamin, \"and the poor children, too. Poor Master Edward! he would have made a brave gentleman.\"  \"But the old lady is safe,\" rejoined Jacob. \"Did you see her?\"  \"Yes, I saw her; they thought she was King Charles--poor old soul.\"  \"But they have found out their mistake by this time?\"  \"Yes, and James Southwold has found it out too,\" replied Benjamin; \"to think of the old lady breaking his neck!\"  \"Breaking his neck? You don't say so! How was it?\"  \"Why, it seems that Southwold thought that she was King Charles dressed up as an old woman, so he seized her and strapped her fast behind him, and galloped away with her to Lymington; but she struggled and kicked so manfully, that he could not hold on, and off they went together, and he broke his neck.\"  \"Indeed! A judgment--a judgment upon a traitor,\" said Jacob.  \"They were picked up, strapped together as they were, by the other troopers, and carried to Lymington.\"  \"Well, and where is the old lady, then? Did you see and speak to her?\"  \"I saw her, Jacob, but I did not speak to her. I forgot to say that, when "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6471"],["title","The Children of the New Forest (#4)"],["body","broke Southwold's neck, she broke her own too.\"  \"Then the old lady is dead?\"  \"Yes, that she is,\" replied Benjamin; \"but who cares about her? it's the poor children that I pity. Martha has been crying ever since.\"  \"I don't wonder.\"  \"I was at the Cavalier, and the troopers were there, and they were boasting of what they had done, and called it a righteous work. I could not stand that, and I asked one of them if it were a righteous work to burn poor children in their beds? So he turned round, and struck his sword upon the floor, and asked me whether I was one of them--'Who are you, then?' and I--all my courage went away, and I answered, I was a poor rat-catcher. 'A rat-catcher; are you? Well, then, Mr. Ratcatcher, when you are killing rats, if you find a nest of young ones, don't you kill them too? or do you leave them to grow, and become mischievous, eh?' 'I kill the young ones, of course,' replied I. 'Well, so do we Malignants whenever we find them.' I didn't say a word more, so I went out of the house as fast as I could.\"  \"Have you heard any thing about the king?\" inquired Jacob.  \"No, nothing; but the troopers are all out again, and, I hear, are gone to the forest.\"  \"Well, Benjamin, good-by, I shall be off from this part of the country--it's no use my staying here. Where's Agatha and cook?\"  \"They came to Lymington early this morning.\"  \"Wish them good-by for me, Benjamin.\"  \"Where are you going, then?\"  \"I can't exactly say, but I think London way. I only staid here to watch over the children; and now that they are gone, I shall leave Arnwood forever.\"  Jacob, who was anxious, on account of the intelligence he had received of the troopers being in the forest, to return to the cottage, shook hands with Benjamin, and hastened away. \"Well,\" thought Jacob, as he wended his way, \"I'm sorry for the poor old lady, but still, perhaps, it's all for the best. Who knows what they might do with these children! Destroy the nest as well as the rats, indeed! they must find the nest first.\" And the old forester continued his journey in deep thought.  We may here observe that, blood-thirsty as many of the Levelers were, we do not think that Jacob Armitage had grounds for the fears which he expressed and felt; that is to say, we believe that he might have made known the existence of the children to the Villiers family, and that they would never have been harmed by any body. That by the burning of the mansion they might have perished in the flames, had they been in bed, as they would have been at that hour, had he not obtained intelligence of what was about to be done, is true; but that there was any danger to them on account of their father having been such a stanch supporter of the king's cause, is very unlikely, and not borne out by the history of the times: but the old forester thought otherwise; he had a hatred of the Puritans, and their deeds had been so exaggerated by rumor, that he fully believed that the lives of the children were not safe. Under this conviction, and feeling himself bound by his promise to Colonel Beverley to protect them, Jacob resolved that they should live with him in the forest, and be brought up as his own grandchildren. He knew that there could be no better place for concealment; for, except the keepers, few people knew where his cottage was; and it was so out of the usual paths, and so imbosomed in lofty trees, that there was little chance of its being seen, or being known to exist. He resolved, therefore, that they should remain with him till better times; and then he would make known their existence to the other branches of the family, but not before. \"I can hunt for them, and provide for them,\" thought he, \"and I have a little money, when it is required; and I will teach them to be useful; they must learn to provide for themselves. There's the garden, and the patch of land: in two or three years, the boys will be able to do something. I can't teach them much; but I can teach them to fear God. We must get on how we can, and put our trust in Him who is a father to the fatherless.\"  With such thoughts running in his head, Jacob arrived at the cottage, and found the children outside the door, watching for him. They all hastened to him, and the dog rushed before them, to welcome his master. \"Down, Smoker, good dog! Well, Mr. Edward, I have been as quick as I could. How have Mr. Humphrey and your sisters behaved? But we must not remain outside to-day, for the troopers are scouring the forest, and may see you. Let us come in directly, for it would not do that they should come here.\"  \"Will they burn the cottage down?\" inquired Alice, as she took Jacob's hand.  \"Yes, my dear, I think they would, if they found that you and your brothers were in it; but we must not let them see you.\"  They all entered the cottage, which consisted of one large room in front, and two back rooms for bedrooms. There was also a third bedroom, which was behind the other two, but which had not any furniture in it.  \"Now, let's see what we can have for dinner--there's venison left, I know,\" said Jacob; \"come, we must all be useful. Who will be cook?\"  \"I will be cook,\" said Alice, \"if you will show me how.\"  \"So you shall, my dear,\" said Jacob, \"and I will show you how. There's some potatoes in the basket in the corner, and some onions hanging on the string; we must have some water--who will fetch it?\"  \"I will,\" said Edward, who took a pail, and went out to the spring.  The potatoes were peeled and washed by the children--Jacob and Edward cut the venison into pieces--the iron pot was cleaned; and then the meat and potatoes put with water into the pot, and placed on the fire.  \"Now I'll cut up the onions, for they will make your eyes water.\"  \"I don't care,\" said Humphrey, \"I'll cut and cry at the same time.\"  And Humphrey took up a knife, and cut away most manfully, although he was obliged to wipe his eyes with his sleeve very often.  \"You are a fine fellow, Humphrey,\" said Jacob. \"Now we'll put the onions in, and let it all boil up together. Now you see, you have cooked your own dinner; ain't that pleasant?\"  \"Yes,\" cried they all; \"and we will eat our own dinners as soon as it is ready.\"  \"Then, Humphrey, you must get some of the platters down which are on the drawer; and, Alice, you will find some knives in the drawer. And let me see, what can little Edith do? Oh, she can go to the cupboard and find the salt-cellar. Edward, just look out, and if you see any body coming or passing, let me know. We must put you on guard till the troopers leave the forest.\"  The children set about their tasks, and Humphrey cried out, as he very often did, \"Now, this is jolly!\"  While the dinner was cooking, Jacob amused the children by showing them how to put things in order; the floor was swept, the hearth was made tidy. He shewed Alice how to wash out a cloth, and Humphrey how to dust the chairs. They all worked merrily, while little Edith stood and clapped her hands.  But just before dinner was ready, Edward came in and said, \"Here are troopers galloping in the forest!\" Jacob went out, and observed that they were coming in a direction that would lead near to the cottage.  He walked in, and, after a moment's thought, he said, \"My dear children, those men may come and search the cottage; you must do as I tell you, and mind that you are very quiet. Humphrey, you and your sisters must go to bed, and pretend to be very ill. Edward, take off your coat and put on this old hunting-frock of mine. You must be in the bedroom attending your sick brother and sisters. Come, Edith, dear, you must play at going to bed, and have your dinner afterward.\"  Jacob took the children into the bedroom, and, removing the upper dress, which would have betrayed that they were not the children of poor people, put them in bed, and covered them up to the chins with the clothes. Edward had put on the old hunting-shirt, which came below his knees, and stood with a mug of water in his hand by the bedside of the two girls. Jacob went to the outer room, to remove the platters laid out for dinner; and he had hardly done so when he heard the noise of the troopers, and soon afterward a knock at the cottage-door.  \"Come in,\" said Jacob.  \"Who are you, my friend?\" said the leader of the troop, entering the door.  \"A poor forester, sir,\" replied Jacob, \"under great trouble.\"  \"What trouble, my man?\"  \"I have the children all in bed with the small-pox.\"  \"Nevertheless, we must search your cottage.\"  \"You are welcome,\" replied Jacob; \"only don't frighten the children, if you can help it.\"  The man, who was now joined by others, commenced his search. Jacob opened all the doors of the rooms, and they passed through. Little Edith shrieked when she saw them; but Edward patted her, and told her not to be frightened. The troopers, however, took no notice of the children; they searched thoroughly, and then came back to the front room.  \"It's no use remaining here,\" said one of the troopers. \"Shall we be off! I'm tired and hungry with the ride.\"  \"So am I, and there's something that smells well.\" said another. \"What's this, my good man?\" continued he, taking off the lid of the pot.  \"My dinner for a week,\" replied Jacob. \"I have no one to cook for me now, and can't light a fire every day.\"  \"Well, you appear to live well, if you have such a mess as that every day in the week. I should like to try a spoonful or two.\"  \"And welcome, sir,\" replied Jacob; \"I will cook some more for myself.\"  The troopers took him at his word; they sat down to the table, and very soon the whole contents of the kettle had disappeared. Having satisfied themselves, they got up, told him that his rations were so good that they hoped to call again; and, laughing heartily, they mounted their horses, and rode away.  \"Well,\" said Jacob, \"they are very welcome to the dinner; I little thought to get off so cheap.\" As soon as they were out of sight, Jacob called to Edward and the children to get up again,"]]]
