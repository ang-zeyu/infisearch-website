[Illustration: THE SAUCEPAN THROWN IN DEFIANCE]     THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS    _IN THREE VOLUMES_   VOLUME TWO    By EUGENE SUE     [Illustration]  THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS     CHAPTER XXXVIII.  THE EXECUTION.   The surprised lapidary rose and opened the door. Two men entered the garret. One of them was tall and thin, with a face mean and pimpled, surrounded by thick, grayish whiskers; he held in his hand a stout loaded cane, and wore a shapeless hat and a large green greatcoat, covered with mud, and buttoned close up to the neck; the black velvet collar, much worn, exposed to view his long, bare, red throat, which resembled a vulture's. This man was one Malicorne. The other was short and thick-set, his countenance equally mean, and his hair red. He was dressed with an attempt at finery, quite ridiculous. Bright studs fastened the front of his shirt, whose cleanliness was more than doubtful; a long gold chain, passed across his second-hand plaid stuff waistcoat, was left to view by a velveteen jacket, of a yellowish-gray color. This man's name was Bourdin.  \"Oh, what a stink of misery and death is here!\" said Malicorne, stopping at the threshold.  \"The fact is, it does not smell of musk. What habits!\" repeated Bourdin, turning up his nose in disgust and disdain. He then advanced toward the artisan, who looked at him with mingled surprise and indignation.  Through the half-open door was seen Hoppy's evil, watchful, and cunning face, who, having followed the strangers, unknown to them, was narrowly watching and listening attentively.  \"What do you want?\" challenged the lapidary, roughly, disgusted with the rudeness of the two men.  \"Jerome Morel,\" responded Bourdin.  \"I am he.\"  \"Working jeweler?\"  \"The same.\"  \"Are you quite sure?\"  \"Once more, I am that person; you annoy me--what do you want? Explain, or leave the room!\"  \"Oh, you are coming the _bounce_, are you? I say, Malicorne,\" said this man, turning toward his companion, \"there is no catch here; it is not like the haul at Viscount de Saint-Remy's.\"  \"No, but when there is much, the door is shut against you, as we found in the Rue de---. The bird had watched the net, and would not be taken; while such vermin as these stick to their _cribs_ like a snail to his shell.\"  \"It is my opinion that they only require to be jugged to cram themselves.\"  \"Still the costs will be more than ever the creditor _wolf_ will get here; however, that's his look-out.\"  \"Hold!\" said Morel with indignation; \"if you were not drunk, as you surely are, I should be very angry. Instantly leave my room!\"  \"How very sharp you are this morning, old lopsides!\" cried Malicorne, insultingly alluding to the deformity in the lapidary's person.  \"Do you hear, Malicorne?--he has the impudence to call this place a _room_--a hole where I would not put my dog.\"  \"For heaven's sake!\" cried Madeleine, so alarmed, that till then she had not spoken a word, \"call for assistance; perhaps they are thieves. Take care of the diamonds!\"  In truth, seeing these two strangers, of doubtful appearance, approach nearer and nearer to the bench on which lay the jewels, Morel, fearing some evil intention, ran forward, and with both hands covered the precious stones.  Hoppy, always on the watch, and listening, hearing Madeleine's words, and seeing the movement of the artisan, said to himself; \"They say he is a cutter of false stones; if so, he would not fear their being stolen. Just as well to know that. _I take!_ Then again, Mother Mathieu, who comes here so often, is a dealer in _real_; and those she has in her casket are real diamonds. I will put the Owl up to this!\" added Red Arm's son.  \"If you do not leave this room instantly, I will call the police,\" said Morel.  The children, frightened at this scene, began to cry, while the old idiot started upright in her bed.  \"If any one has a right to call the police, we're the men. Do you hear, Mister Sideways?\" said Bourdin.  \"You'll see the police lend a hand to take you, if you don't go quietly,\" added Malicorne; \"we have not the magistrate with us, it is true; but if you wish to enjoy his society, you shall have a taste of one, just out of his bed, quite hot and heavy. Bourdin will go and fetch him.\"  \"To prison! Me?\" cried the astounded Morel.  \"Yes, to Clichy.\"  \"To Clichy!\" repeated the artisan, with a wild look.  \"Is he hard of hearing?\" asked Malicorne.  \"Well, then, to the debtor's prison, if you like that better,\" explained Bourdin.  \"You--you--are--can it be?--the lawyer! Oh, my God!\"  The artisan, pale as death, fell back on his stool, unable to utter another word.  \"We are the officers who are to take you, if we can; do you understand now, old fellow?\"  \"Morel, it is for the bill in the hands of Louise's master! We are all lost!\" said Madeleine, with a sorrowful voice.  \"This is the warrant,\" said Malicorne, taking from his dirty pocket-book a stamped writ.  After having mumbled over in the usual way a part of this document, in a voice hardly intelligible, he pronounced distinctly the last words, unfortunately too well understood by the artisan.--  \"As final judgment, the court condemns Jerome Morel to pay to Pierre Petit-Jean, merchant,[Footnote: The crafty notary incompetent to proceed in his own name, had got from the unfortunate Morel a blank acceptance, and had introduced a third party's name.] by all his goods, and even with his body, the sum of thirteen hundred francs, with lawful interest, dated from the day of the protest; and he is besides condemned to pay all other and extra costs. Given and judged at Paris, the 30th of September,\" etc., etc.  \"And Louise, then? Louise!\" cried Morel, almost distracted, without appearing to have heard what had just been read. \"Where is she? She must have left the lawyer, since he sends me to prison. Louise! my child! what has become of her?\"  \"Who is this Louise?\" said Bourdin.  \"Let him alone,\" said Malicorne. \"Don't you see he's coming the artful?\" Then, approaching Morel, he added: \"Come, to the right-about-face, march; I want to breathe the air, I am poisoned here!\"  \"Morel, do not go!\" said Madeleine, wildly. \"Kill them, the thieves! Oh, you are a coward! You will let them take you, and abandon us to our fate.\"  \"Act as though you were at home, madame,\" said Bourdin, sarcastically; \"but if your husband lifts his hand against me, I will give him something to remember it by,\" continued he, twisting his loaded stick round and round.  Occupied solely with thoughts of Louise, Morel heard nothing of what was said. Suddenly, an expression of bitter joy lighting up his face, he cried out, \"Louise has quitted the lawyer's house. I shall go to prison with a light heart!\" But then, glancing round him, he exclaimed, \"But my wife, and her mother, and my poor children--who will support them? They will not trust me with stones to cut in prison; for it will be supposed that my own misconduct has sent me there. Does this lawyer desire the death of all of us?\"  \"Once for all, let us be off!\" said Bourdin; \"I am sick of all this. Come, dress yourself and march.\"  \"My good gentleman, forgive what I have just said to you,\" cried Madeleine, still in bed; \"you will not have the cruelty to take away Morel; what do you think will become of me, with my five children, and my idiot mother? There she is, huddled up on her mattress. She is foolish, my good gentlemen; she is quite out of her mind.\"  \"The old woman that is shorn?\"  \"Sure enough she is shaved,\" said Malicorne; \"I thought she had on a white scull-cap.\"  \"My dear children, throw yourselves at the feet of these two gentlemen,\" said Madeleine, hoping, by a last effort, to soften the bailiffs, \"entreat them not to take away your poor father--our only hope.\" But in spite of the order of their mother, the children, frightened and crying, dared not leave their beds.  At the unusual noise, and the sight of the two bailiffs, whom she did not know, the idiot began to utter deafening howls, crouching herself against the wall. Morel appeared careless to all that was passing around him; the blow was so frightful, so unexpected, the consequences of this arrest appeared so terrible, that he could scarcely believe in its reality. Already weakened by privations of every description, his strength failed him; he remained pale and haggard, seated on his stool, as though incapable of speech or motion, his head drooping on his breast, and his arms hanging listlessly down.  \"Confound it! when will all this end?\" cried Malicorne; \"think you that we come here for fun? Off with you, or I shall make you!\" So saying, the bailiff put his hand on the artisan's shoulder, and shook him roughly. The threat and action alarmed the children; the three little boys left their mattress half naked, and came, in a flood of tears, to throw themselves at the feet of the bailiffs, and, with clasped hands, cried, in tones of touching earnestness, \"Pray, pray do not kill father.\"  At sight of these unhappy children, shivering with cold and fear, Bourdin, in spite of his natural callousness, and the constant sight of scenes like the present, felt something akin to compassion; his companion, unpitying, brutally disengaged his leg from the grasp of the kneeling supplicants.  \"Hands off, you young ragamuffins! A pretty business ours would be truly, if we had always to do with such beggars!\"  A fearful addition was made to the horrors of this scene. The elder of the little girls, who had remained in the straw with her sick sister, cried out, \"Oh, mother, mother! I do not know what is the matter with Adele! She is quite cold, and she stares so at me and she don't breathe!\"  The poor consumptive child had just quietly expired, without a murmur, her looks resting on her sister, whom she tenderly loved.  No language can describe the heart-rending cry of anguish uttered by the diamond-cutter's wife at this frightful announcement, for she understood it all. It was one of those"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6602"],["title","Mysteries of Paris — Volume 02 (#1)"],["body","ling, convulsive screams, torn from the depth of a mother's heart.  \"My sister seems as though she were dead!\" continued the child. \"Oh, how she frightens me! She still looks at me, but how cold her face is!\" Saying this, the poor child suddenly rose from the side of her dead sister, and, running terrified, threw herself into the arms of her mother; while the distracted parent, forgetful that her paralyzed limbs were incapable of sustaining her, made a violent effort to rise, and ran toward the corpse; but her strength failed her, and she fell on the floor, uttering a last cry of despair. That cry found an echo in Morel's heart, and roused him from his stupor; with one step he reached the bed's side, snatching from it his child, four years old. She was dead! Cold and want had hastened her end, although her complaint, brought on by the want of common necessaries, was beyond cure. Her poor little limbs were already cold and stiff. Morel, his gray hair almost standing on end with despair and fright, remained motionless, holding his dead child in his arms, whom he contemplated with fixed, tearless eyes, bloodshot with agony.  \"Morel! Morel! give my Adele to me!\" shrieked the unhappy mother, holding out her arms toward her husband; \"it is not true that she is dead: you shall see--I will warm her in my arms!\"  The idiot's curiosity was excited by the haste with which the two bailiffs approached the lapidary, who would not part with the body of his infant. The old woman ceased to howl, rose from her bed, slowly approached Morel, and passing her hideous and stupid face over his shoulder, gazed vacantly on the corpse of her grandchild. The features of the idiot retained their usual expression of ferocity. After a little time, she uttered a sort of hoarse, hollow groan, like a hungry beast, and returning to her bed, she threw herself upon it, crying out, \"I am hungry! I am hungry!\"  \"You see, gentlemen, this poor little girl, just four years old-- Adele; yes, she was named Adele. Only last night, she fondly returned my caresses--and now--look at her! You will, perhaps, say that I have one less to feed, and that I ought not to murmur,\" said the artisan, with a haggard look.  The poor man's reason began to totter under so many repeated shocks.  \"Morel, I want my child; I will have her!\" said Madeleine.  \"True, true,\" replied the lapidary, \"each in turn, that is but fair!\" He went and laid the child in the arms of his wife. Then, hiding his face between his hands, he groaned bitterly. Madeleine, almost as frenzied as her husband, laid the child in the straw of her couch, and watched it with a sort of savage jealousy; while the other children were kneeling round in tears.  The bailiffs, for a moment softened by the death of the child, soon returned to their accustomed brutality of conduct. \"Oh, look here, my friend,\" said Malicorne to the lapidary, \"your child is dead; it is unfortunate, but we are all mortal; we cannot help it, nor can you, so there's an end of it. We have an extra job to do to-day--a _swell_ to grab.\"  Morel did not hear the man. Completely lost in mournful contemplation, the artisan said to himself, in a hollow and broken voice: \"It will be necessary to bury my poor little girl--to watch her here till they come to carry her away. But how?--we have nothing! And the coffin!-- who will give us credit? Oh, a little coffin for a child of four years old ought not to cost much! And then we shall want no bearers! One can take it under his arm. Ha! ha! ha!\" added he, with a frightful burst of laughter, \"how lucky I am! She might perhaps have lived to be eighteen, Louise's age, and no one would have given me credit for a large coffin!\"  \"Egad! this chap seems as though he would lose his senses!\" said Bourdin to Malicorne. \"Look at him; he quite frightens me! and how the old idiot howls with hunger! What a queer lot!\"  \"We must, however, make a finish; although the arrest of this beggar is only for seventy-six francs, seventy-five centimes, it is only right that we should swell the costs to two hundred and forty or fifty francs. It is the _wolf_ who pays.\"  \"You mean who has to _fork out_--for this poor devil here will have to pay the fiddler, since it is he that must dance.\"  \"By the time he has paid his creditor two thousand five hundred francs, for principal, interest, costs, and all, he will be warm.\"  \"It will not be then as now, for it freezes,\" said the bailiff, blowing his fingers. \"Come, old fellow, pack up and let us be off; you can blubber as you go along. Who the devil can help the youngun's kicking the bucket!\"  \"Besides, when people are so poor, they have no right to have children.\"  \"A good idea!\" said Malicorne. Then slapping Morel on the shoulder, he continued: \"Come, come, old boy, we can wait no longer; since you cannot pay, off to prison with you!\"  \"Prison!\" said a pure, youthful voice; \"Morel to prison!\" A young, bright, rosy brunette suddenly entered the garret.  \"Oh, Miss Dimpleton!\" said one of the children, crying; \"you are so good; save papa! they want to take him to prison, and little sister is dead.\"  \"Adele dead!\" exclaimed the girl, whose large, brilliant black eyes were veiled in tears. \"Your father to prison? This cannot be.\" Stupefied by surprise, she looked alternately at the lapidary, his wife, and the bailiffs.  \"My pretty girl,\" said Bourdin approaching Miss Dimpleton, \"you're cool, you must try to make this poor man listen to reason; his little girl is dead, but nevertheless he must come with us to Clichy--to the debtors' prison. We are sheriffs' officers.\"  \"It is, then, all true,\" said the girl.  \"Quite true. The mother has the little one in her bed--they cannot take it from her; and while she is hugging it there, the father ought to take the opportunity of slipping out.\"  \"My God! my God! what misery,\" said Miss Dimpleton. \"What is to be done?\"  \"Pay, or go to prison! there is no other way, unless you have notes for two or three thousand francs to lend them,\" said Malicorne, in a careless tone; \"if you have them, _shell out_, and we will _cut_, devilish glad to get away.\"  \"Oh, this is dreadful!\" said Miss Dimpleton, with indignation; \"daring to jest with such dreadful misfortunes.\"  \"Well then, joking aside,\" replied the other bailiff, \"if you would do some good, endeavor to prevent the woman from seeing us take away her husband. You will thus save each of them a very disagreeable quarter of an hour.\"  The advice was good, though coarsely given, and Miss Dimpleton, following it, approached Madeleine, who, distracted with grief, did not appear to notice the young girl, as she knelt down beside the bed with the children.  Meanwhile, Morel had only recovered from his temporary delirium to sink under the most painful reflections. Having become calm, he could view far too clearly the horror of his situation. The notary must be pitiless, since he had gone to such extremity; the bailiffs did but do their duty. The artisan was therefore resigned.  \"Come, come, let's be marching some time to-day,\" said Bourdin to him.  \"I cannot leave these diamonds here, my wife is half mad,\" said Morel, pointing to the stones scattered upon the bench; \"the person for whom I work will come for them this morning, or in the course of the day. Their amount is considerable.\"  \"Good!\" said Hoppy, who still remained near the half-open door: \"good, good! Screech-Owl shall know that.\"  \"Grant me only till to-morrow,\" urged Morel, \"that I may restore the diamonds.\"  \"Impossible! We must go immediately.\"  \"But I cannot, by leaving the diamonds here, run the risk of their being lost.\"  \"Take them with you, a coach waits at the door, which you will have to pay for, with the other expenses. We can call on the owner of the stones; if he is not at home you can place them in the registry at Clichy; they will be as safe there as in the bank. Come, make haste; we will slip away before your wife or children are aware of it.\"  \"Grant me only till to-morrow, that I may bury my child!\" entreated Morel, with a supplicating voice, half stifled with the sobs he endeavored to restrain.  \"No! we have already lost more than an hour waiting here.\"  \"This burying still worries you, then?\" added Malicorne.  \"Oh! yes, it makes me sad,\" said Morel, with bitterness; \"you so much fear to grieve people. Well, then, a last farewell!\"  \"There, again! confound you, make haste!\" said Malicorne, with brutal impatience.  \"How long have you had the order to arrest me?\"  \"The judgment was signed four months since; but it was only yesterday that our officer received instructions from the lawyer to put it in execution.\"  \"Yesterday only. Why was it delayed so long?\"  \"How can I tell? Come, pack up.\"  \"Yesterday! and Louise not yet here! Where can she be? what has become of her?\" said the lapidary, taking from the bench a card-box filled with cotton, in which he arranged the jewels. \"But never mind that; in prison I shall have plenty of time for thinking.\"  \"Come, pack up the duds to take with you, and make haste and dress yourself.\"  \"I have no clothes to pack up: I have only these diamonds to take away, and place in the prison registry.\"  \"Well, then, dress yourself.\"  \"I have no other clothes than these.\"  \"Going out in these rags?\" said Bourdin.  \"You will be ashamed of me, doubtless,\" said the lapidary, bitterly.  \"No, it is of no consequence, since we go in your coach,\" answered Malicorne.  \"Father, father! mother is calling you,\" said one of the children.  \"You hear?\" muttered Morel, rapidly, appealing to one of the bailiffs; \"do not be inhuman; grant me a last favor. I have not the courage to say farewell to my wife and children; it would break my heart. If they see you take me away they will run after me, and I would avoid that. I therefore beg of you to say aloud that you will return in three or four days, and pretend to go away; you can wait for me on the landing below; I will come to you in less than five minutes. That will spare "]]]
