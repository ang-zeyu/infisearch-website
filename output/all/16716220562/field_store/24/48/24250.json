Every now and then I add a new trick. I will teach you some.”  “I might leave you and set up on my own hook when I have learned,”  suggested Harry, with a smile.  “It will be some time before you look old enough for a magician. When you are, I’ll give you my blessing and send you out.”  Meanwhile they had been jogging along, and were already in the main street of Conway. The professor drew up in front of the village hotel, and a groom came forward and took his horse.  “Wait a minute my friend,” said the professor. “Harry, you can help me take my implements out of the back of the wagon.”  These “implements” were of a heterogeneous character, but all would come in use in the evening. A number of boys watched their transfer with mingled awe and curiosity.  “What’s them?” Harry heard one ask another, in a half-whispered tone.  “Those,” said the professor, in an impressive tone, turning toward the boys. “Those are paraphernalia!”  The boys looked more awestruck than ever. All inwardly resolved to go to the Town Hall that evening, and get a nearer view of the articles which had such a grand name.  After a while Harry came downstairs from the room assigned him, and stood on the piazza.  One of the boys drew near him cautiously.  “Are you the magician’s son?” he asked.  “No,” answered Harry, smiling.  “Do you come from Madagascar?”  “I have not been there recently.”  “Are all the people there magicians?”  “Not quite all.”  This information was rather scanty, but it was whispered about among the boys, the first boy boasting that he had a talk with the young man magician. If Harry had heard himself called thus, he would have been very much amused.  Directly after supper Harry went with his employer to assist in preparing the stage for the evening performance. Though novice, he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of his employer, who congratulated himself on having secured so efficient an assistant. Half an hour before the performance he stationed himself in the entry, provided with tickets. He sat at a small table, and received the crowd. Though new to the business, he managed to make change rapidly. He found his position one in which he had a chance to study human nature.  During the evening Harry was called upon to assist the professor in some of his tricks. Some boys would have been embarrassed upon finding themselves objects of general attention, but Harry was by temperament cool and self-possessed. He had been fond of declamation at school, and this had accustomed him, to some extent, to a public appearance.  The entertainment was in two parts, with an intermission of ten minutes.  “I wish you were a singer,” said the professor, when they were standing behind the screen.  “Why?” asked Harry.  “Because the audience sometimes gets impatient during the intermission. If I could put you on for a song, it would help quiet them.”  “I can sing a little,” said Harry, modestly.  “What can you sing?”  “How would ‘The Last Rose of Summer’ do?”  “Capital. Can you sing it?”  “I can try.”  “You are sure you won’t break down? That would make a bad impression.”  “I can promise you I won’t break down, sir.”  “Then I’ll give you a trial. Are you ready to appear at once?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Wait, then, till I announce you.”  The professor came from behind the screen, and, addressing the audience, said: “Ladies and gentlemen, lest you should find the necessary intermission tedious, I am happy to announce to you that the young vocalist, Master Harry Vane, has kindly consented to favor you with one of his popular melodies. He has selected by request, ‘The Last Rose of Summer.’”  Harry could hardly refrain from laughing when he heard this introduction.  “One would think I was a well-known singer,” he said to himself.  He came forward, and, standing before the audience, with his face a little flushed, made a graceful bow. Then, pausing an instant, he commenced the song announced. He had not sung two lines before the professor, who waited the result with some curiosity and some anxiety, found that he could sing. His voice was high, clear, and musical, and his rendition was absolutely correct. The fact was, Harry had taken lessons in a singing school at home, and had practiced privately also, so that he had reason to feel confidence in himself.  The song was listened to with earnest attention and evident enjoyment by all. When the last strain died away, and Harry made his farewell bow, there was an enthusiastic burst of applause, emphasized by the clapping of hands and the stamping of feet.  “You did yourself proud, my boy!” said the gratified Professor. “They want you on again.”  This seemed evident from the noise.  “Can’t you sing something else?”  “Very well, sir.”  Harry was certainly pleased with this evidence of popular favor. He had never before sung a solo before an audience, and, although he had felt that he could, he was glad to find that he had not overestimated his powers.  Once more he stood before the audience.  “I thank you for your kindness,” he said. “I will now sing you a comic song.”  He sang a song very popular at that time, the words and air of which were familiar to all. While it did not afford him so good a chance to show his musical capacity, it was received with much greater favor than the first song.  There was a perfect whirlwind of applause, and a third song was called for.  “I would rather not sing again, professor,” said Harry.  “You needn’t. They would keep you singing all the evening if you would allow it. Better leave off when they are unsatisfied.”  “Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “Master Vane thanks you for your kind applause, but he makes it an unvarying rule never to sing but two songs in an evening. He never broke that rule but once, and that was at the special request of the governor-general of Canada. I shall now have the pleasure of performing for your amusement, one of my most popular experiments.”  “Well, you have pleased the people, and that is the main point. By Jove! my boy, you’ve got a lovely voice.”  “I am glad you think so, sir.”  “You will prove a very valuable addition to my entertainments. I mean to show my appreciation, too. How much did I agree to give you?”  “Five dollars a week if business was good.”  “It’s bound to be good. I’ll raise your wages to ten dollars a week, if you’ll agree to sing one song, and two, if called for, at each of my evening entertainments.”  “I’ll do it, sir,” said Harry, promptly. “It’s a surprise to me, though, to find my voice so valuable to me.”  “It’s a popular gift, my boy; and all popular gifts are valuable. When I get my new bill printed, I must have your name on it.”  They left Conway about noon the next day.  The Foxes, were destined to hear of Harry’s success. The Conway _Citizen_ was taken in the family, and, much to their astonishment, this is what they found, prominently placed, in the next number:  “The magical entertainment of Professor Hemenway, on Thursday evening, was even more successful than usual. He had had the good fortune to secure the services of a young vocalist named Harry Vane, who charmed both young and old by two popular selections. His voice and execution are both admirable, and we predict for him a brilliant future.”  Mr. Fox read this aloud in evident wonder and excitement.  “Did you ever hear the like?” he said.  “Who’d have thought it?” chimed in Mrs. Fox.     CHAPTER VIII  A LIBERAL OFFER   Then commenced a round of travel--what the professor called a professional tour. By day they traveled in the wagon, carrying their paraphernalia with them, stopping at the principal towns, and giving evening entertainments. At many of these places the magician was well known, and his tricks were not new. But he had an attraction in his young assistant, who was regularly advertised on the posters as the “celebrated young vocalist, whose songs are everywhere received with admiring applause.”  Indeed it was very near the truth. Harry was really a fine singer, and his fresh, attractive face and manly appearance won him a welcome in all the towns on their route. Sometimes a young girl in the audience threw him a bouquet. This made him blush and smile, and the donor felt rewarded.  Where was it going to end? Was he to continue in the service of the professor, and in time become himself a magician and a traveling celebrity? Harry was not sure about it. He saw that it would pay him better than most kinds of business, and he also discovered that Professor Hemenway was even better off than he had represented. Yet, he was not quite ready to select the same profession, but, being only sixteen, felt that he could afford to remain in it a while longer.  One day the professor gave him a surprise.  “Harry,” he said, as they were jogging along a dusty road, “do you think you would like to travel?”  “I am traveling now,” answered Harry, with a smile.  “True, but I don’t mean that. Would you like to go on a long journey?”  “I should like nothing better,” replied Harry, promptly.  “I’ll tell you what I’ve been thinking about. I recently read in some paper that a man in my line had made a trip to Australia, and reaped a rich harvest. Everywhere he was received with enthusiasm, and made as much money, in one month as he would do here in four. Now why shouldn’t I go to Australia?”  Harry’s eyes sparkled.  “It would be a fine thing to do,” he said.  “Then you would be willing to accompany me?”  “I would thank you for taking me,” answered the boy.  “That is well!” said the professor, in a tone of satisfaction. “I confess I shouldn’t like to go alone. It would be a great undertaking, but with a companion it would seem different. But, is there anyone who would object to your going?”  “Yes,” answered Harry, smiling, “Mr. Fox, my ‘guardeen,’ would.”  “We won’t mind Mr. Fox. Very well, then, Harry, we will consider it settled. I shall rely on you to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6461"],["title","Facing the World (#7)"],["body","me by your singing there as you do here. As to your wages, I may be able to pay you more.”  “Never mind about that, professor. It will cost you a good deal to get us there. I am perfectly willing to work for the same sum I do now, or even less, on account of the extension of the trip.”  “Then you leave that matter to me. I won’t take advantage of your confidence, but you shall prosper if I do.”  “How soon do you propose to go, professor?” asked Harry, with interest.  “As soon as possible. I shall ascertain when the first packet leaves Boston, and we will take passage in her.”  The professor’s decision pleased Harry. He had been a good scholar in geography--indeed, it was his favorite study--and had, besides, read as many books of travel as he could lay his hands on. Often he had wondered if it ever would be his fortune to see some of the distant countries of which he read with so much interest. Though he had cherished vague hopes, he had never really expected it. Now, however, the unattainable seemed within his grasp. He would not have to wait until he was a rich man, but when still a boy he could travel to the opposite side of the world, paying his expenses as he went along.  Two weeks passed. Each day they halted in some new place, and gave an evening performance. This life of constant motion had, at first, seemed strange to Harry. Now he was accustomed to it. He never felt nervous when he appeared before an audience to sing, but looked upon it as a matter of course.  At last they reached Boston. They were to give two entertainments at a hall at the south end. It was the first large city in which Harry had sung, but he received a welcome no less cordial than that which had been accorded to him in country towns.  They were staying at a modest hotel, comfortable, but not expensive. Harry was sitting in the reading room, when a servant brought in a card. It bore the rather remarkable name of    “DR. MENDELSSOHN BROWN.”  “A gentleman to see you, Mr. Vane,” said the servant.  Harry rose and surveyed the stranger in some surprise. He had long hair, of a reddish yellow, with an abundant beard of the same hue. His suit of worn black fitted him poorly, but Dr. Brown evidently was not a devotee of dress. No tailor could ever point to him, and say with pride: “That man’s clothes were made at my shop.”  “Do I speak to Mr. Harry Vane, the young vocalist?” asked the stranger, with a deferential smile.  “That’s my name,” answered our hero.  “You are alone?”  “Yes, sir,” said Harry, a little puzzled.  “It is well. I will come to business at once. You have probably heard of me, eh?”  “Probably I have, but I do not remember names well.”  “The name of Mendelssohn Brown, is pretty well known, I flatter myself,” said the visitor, complacently. “To be brief--I heard you sing last evening, and was much pleased with your rendition of the various selections.”  Harry bowed.  “I am about to form a juvenile Pinafore company, and would like to have you take the leading part. You would make an excellent _Admiral_. I propose to take my opera company all over the United States. I should be willing to pay you, as the star performer, twenty-five dollars a week.”  Harry opened his eyes in amazement.  “Do you think me capable of singing in opera?” he asked.  “Yes, after being trained by your humble servant. What do you say?”  “I thank you for your flattering offer, Dr. Brown, but I don’t feel at liberty to leave Professor Hemenway.”  The doctor frowned.  “Let me tell you, you stand in your own light, Mr. Vane,” he said, impatiently. “There is some difference between a common juggler, like the Magician of Madagascar,”--the doctor laughed ironically--“and a well-known musical director, who could make you famous. Does Hemenway pay you as much as I offer?”  “No, sir.”  “I thought so. Then how can you hesitate?”  “We are about to make an Australian tour,” answered Harry, “and, apart from all other considerations, I am glad to have a chance to travel.”  “Couldn’t you put it off?”  “No, sir.”  “Then,” said Dr. Brown, rather crestfallen, “I can only bid you good-morning. I think you are making a mistake.”  “Perhaps, after I return from Australia, I might be ready to accept your offer.”  “It will be too late,” said the doctor, gloomily.  “Twenty-five dollars a week is large pay,” thought Harry, “but I don’t believe I should ever get it. Dr. Brown doesn’t look much like a capitalist.”  Half an hour later Professor Hemenway entered the hotel.  “Well, my boy,” he said, “the die is cast! Next Saturday we sail from Long Wharf, bound for Australia.”  “But professor, I have just had an offer of twenty-five dollars a week to sing in Pinafore.”  “And have accepted!” exclaimed the magician in dismay.  “No; I respectfully declined. I would rather go with you.”  “You shan’t regret it, Harry!” said the professor, relieved. “If I am prosperous, you shall share in my prosperity.”  “Thank you, professor; I am sure of that. What is the name of our vessel?”  “The Nantucket. It’s a good, solid-looking craft, and I think it will bear us in safety to our destination.”     CHAPTER IX  THE PASSENGERS   The Nantucket, Capt. Jabez Hill, master, was a large vessel, stanch and strong, and bore a good record, having been in service six years, and never having in that time met a serious disaster. It was a sailing vessel, and primarily intended to convey freight, but had accommodations for six passengers. Of these it had a full complement. Harry and the professor I name first, as those in whom we are most interested.  Next came John Appleton, a business man from Melbourne, who had visited the United States on business. He was a plain, substantial-looking person, of perhaps forty-five. Next came Montgomery Clinton, from Brooklyn, a young man of twenty-four, foolishly attired, who wore an eyeglass and anxiously aped the Londen swell, though born within sight of Boston State house. Harry regarded him with considerable amusement, and though he treated him with outward respect, mentally voted him very soft. Fifth on the list was a tall, sallow, thin individual, with a melancholy countenance, who was troubled with numerous symptoms, and was persuaded that he had not long to live. He was from Pennsylvania. He carried with him in his trunk a large assortment of pills and liquid medicines, one or another of which he took about once an hour. This gentleman’s name was Marmaduke Timmins. Last came a tall, lean Yankee, the discoverer and proprietor of a valuable invention, which it was his purpose to introduce into Australia. Mr. Jonathan Stubbs, for this was his name, was by no means an undesirable addition to the little circle, and often excited a smile by his quaintly put and shrewd observations on topics of passing interest.  It was the third day at sea, when Harry, who had suffered but little from seasickness, came on deck, after a good dinner, and saw the dudish passenger, till now invisible, holding himself steady with an effort, and gazing sadly out upon the wild waste of waters without the help of his eyeglass.  “How do you feel, Mr. Clinton?” asked Harry.  “Horribly, Mr. Vane,” answered Clinton, with a languid shudder. “I never thought it was such a bore, crossing the ocean, don’t you know. I’ve a great idea of offering the captain a handsome sum to land somewhere, I don’t care where.”  “I don’t think we shall go near any land, Mr. Clinton. I think you will have to make the best of it.”  Hearing a step behind him, Harry turned, and his eyes rested on the melancholy countenance of Marmaduke Timmins, the chronic invalid.  “Good-morning, Mr. Timmins,” said our hero. “I hope you stand the voyage well?”  “I’ve had several new symptoms since I came on board,” responded Mr. Timmins, gloomily, “and I’ve made a dreadful discovery.”  “What is it?” inquired Montgomery Clinton, in alarm.  “I find I’ve mislaid or forgotten to bring my box of Remedial pills. I don’t know what I shall do without them.”  “I’ve got a box of Brandeth’s pills downstairs,” said Clinton. “You’re welcome to a part of them, I’m sure.”  “They wouldn’t do! What can you be thinking of, young man? Do you think there’s no difference between pills?”  “I’m sure I can’t tell, don’t you know?”  “Young man, you are sadly ignorant,” said Timmins, severely. “I’ve got five other kinds of pills downstairs, for different maladies I am subject to, but none of them will take the place of Remedial pills.”  “Will any of them cure seasickness?” asked the dude, eagerly.  “I can give you a remedy for seasickness, Mr. Clinton,” said Mr. Holdfast, the mate, who chanced to overhear the inquiry.  “What is it, Mr. Holdfast? I shall be really grateful, I assure you, if you can cure that beastly malady.”  “Swallow a piece of raw salt pork about an inch square,” said the mate gravely, “and follow it up by a glass of sea water, taken at a gulp.”  “That’s horrid, awfully horrid!” gasped Clinton, shuddering, and looking very pale. “It actually makes me sick to think of it, don’t you know,” and he retreated to the cabin, with one hand pressed on his stomach.  “That young man’s a fool!” said Mr. Timmins. “He knows no more about pills than a baby.”  “Nor do I, Mr. Timmins,” said Harry, smiling.  “I pity you then. My life has been saved several times by pills.”  “I’d rather live without them.”  Marmaduke sadly shook his head as he walked away.  “That man’s a walking drug store,” said the mate, looking after him. “I’d rather go to Davy’s locker, and be done with it, than to fill myself up with pills and potions.”  “You’re looking chipper, my boy,” said a newcomer, in a nasal voice. “Haven’t been seasick, I guess.”  Harry recognized the voice of the Yankee inventor, Jonathan Stubbs.  “No, sir; I have had very little trouble.”  “I’m goin’ to get up a cure for seasickness when I have time--a kind of a self-acting, automatic belt--I guess there’d be plenty of money in it.”  “It would be a great blessing, Mr. Stubbs. Poor Mr. Clinton would no doubt be glad to "]]]
