As ye hear” (and in fact the singing still went on, only now I heard a man's voice joining in the catch) “our house is full of company. But straw is clean bedding, and the mare I'll help to put in stall.”  “Agreed,” I said, “on one condition--that you send out a maid to me with a cup of mulled sack: for this cold eats me alive.”  To this he consented: and stepping back into a side room with the other fellow, returned in a minute alone, and carrying a lantern which, in spite of the moon, was needed to guide a stranger across that ruinous yard. The flare, as we pick'd our way along, fell for a moment on an open cart shed and, within, on the gilt panels of a coach that I recogniz'd. In the stable, that stood at the far end of the court, I was surprised to find half a dozen horses standing, ready saddled, and munching their fill of oats. They were ungroom'd, and one or two in a lather of sweat that on such a night was hard to account for. But I asked no questions, and my companion vouchsafed no talk, though twice I caught him regarding me curiously as I unbridled the mare in the only vacant stall. Not a word pass'd as he took the lantern off the peg again, and led the way up a ramshackle ladder to the loft above. He was a fat, lumbering fellow, and made the old timbers creak. At the top he set down the light, and pointed to a heap of straw in the corner.  “Yon's your bed,” he growled; and before I could answer, was picking his way down the ladder again.  I look'd about, and shiver'd. The eaves of my bedchamber were scarce on speaking terms with the walls, and through a score of crannies at least the wind poured and whistled, so that after shifting my truss of straw a dozen times I found myself still the centre of a whirl of draught. The candle-flame, too, was puffed this way and that inside the horn sheath. I was losing patience when I heard footsteps below; the ladder creak'd, and the red hair and broad shoulders of a chambermaid rose into view. She carried a steaming mug in her hand, and mutter'd all the while in no very choice talk.  The wench had a kind face, tho'; and a pair of eyes that did her more credit than her tongue.  “And what's to be my reward for this, I want to know?” she panted out, resting her left palm on her hip.  “Why, a groat or two,” said I, “when it comes to the reckoning.”  “Lud!” she cried, “what a dull young man!”  “Dull?”  “Aye--to make me ask for a kiss in so many words:” and with the back of her left hand she wiped her mouth for it frankly, while she held out the mug in her right.  “Oh!” I said, “I beg your pardon, but my wits are frozen up, I think. There's two, for interest: and another if you tell me whom your master entertains to-night, that I must be content with this crib.”  She took the kisses with composure and said---  “Well--to begin, there's the gentlefolk that came this afternoon with their own carriage and heathenish French servant: a cranky old grandee and a daughter with more airs than a peacock: Sir Something-or-other Killigew--Lord bless the boy!”  For I had dropp'd the mug and split the hot sack all about the straw, where it trickled away with a fragrance reproachfully delicious.  “Now I beg your pardon a hundred times: but the chill is in my bones worse than the ague;” and huddling my shoulders up, I counterfeited a shivering fit with a truthfulness that surpris'd myself.  “Poor lad!”  “--And 'tis first hot and then cold all down my spine.”  “There, now!”  “-And goose flesh and flushes all over my body.”  “Dear heart-and to pass the night in this grave of a place!”  “--And by morning I shall be in a high fever: and oh! I feel I shall die of it!”  “Don't--don't!” The honest girl's eyes were full of tears. “I wonder, now--” she began: and I waited, eager for her next words. “Sure, master's at cards in the parlor, and 'll be drunk by midnight. Shalt pass the night by the kitchen fire, if only thou make no noise.”  “But your mistress--what will she say?”  “Is in heaven these two years: and out of master's speaking distance forever. So blow out the light and follow me gently.”  Still feigning to shiver, I follow'd her down the ladder, and through the stable into the open. The wind by this time had brought up some heavy clouds, and mass'd them about the moon: but 'twas freezing hard, nevertheless. The girl took me by the hand to guide me: for, save from the one bright window in the upper floor, there was no light at all in the yard. Clearly, she was in dread of her master's anger, for we stole across like ghosts, and once or twice she whisper'd a warning when my toe kick'd against a loose cobble. But just as I seem'd to be walking into a stone wall, she put out her hand, I heard the click of a latch, and stood in a dark, narrow passage.  The passage led to a second door that open'd on a wide, stone-pav'd kitchen, lit by a cheerful fire, whereon a kettle hissed and bubbled as the vapor lifted the cover. Close by the chimney corner was a sort of trap, or buttery hatch, for pushing the hot dishes conveniently into the parlor on the other side of the wall. Besides this, for furniture, the room held a broad deal table, an oak dresser, a linen press, a rack with hams and strings of onions depending from it, a settle and a chair or two, with (for decoration) a dozen or so of ballad sheets stuck among the dish covers along the wall.  “Sit,” whisper'd the girl, “and make no noise, while I brew a rack-punch for the men-folk in the parlor.” She jerked her thumb toward the buttery hatch, where I had already caught the mur-mer of voices.  I took up a chair softly, and set it down between the hatch and the fireplace, so that while warming my knees I could catch any word spoken more than ordinary loud on the other side of the wall. The chambermaid stirr'd the fire briskly, and moved about singing as she fetch'd down bottles and glasses from the dresser----      “Lament ye maids an' darters        For constant Sarah Ann,      Who hang'd hersel' in her garters        All for the love o' man,      All for the--”  She was pausing, bottle in hand, to take the high note: but hush'd suddenly at the sound of the voices singing in the room upstairs---      “Vivre en tout cas      C'est le grand soulas      Des honnetes gens!”  “That's the foreigners,” said the chambermaid, and went on with her ditty----      “All for the love of a souljer      Who christening name was Jan.”  A volley of oaths sounded through the buttery hatch.  “--And that's the true-born Englishmen, as you may tell by their speech. 'Tis pretty company the master keeps, these days.”  She was continuing her song, when I held up a finger for silence. In fact, through the hatch my ear had caught a sentence that set me listening for more with a still heart.  “D--n the Captain,” the landlord's gruff voice was saying; “I warn'd 'n agen this fancy business when sober, cool-handed work was toward.”  “Settle's way from his cradle,” growl'd another; “and times enough I've told 'n: 'Cap'n,' says I, 'there's no sense o' proportions about ye.' A master mind, sirs, but 'a 'll be hang'd for a hen-roost, so sure as my name's Bill Widdicomb.”  “Ugly words-what a creeping influence has that same mention o' hanging!”  piped a thinner voice.  “Hold thy complaints, Old Mortification,” put in a speaker that I recogniz'd for Black Dick; “sure the pretty maid upstairs is tender game. Hark how they sing!”  And indeed the threatened folk upstairs were singing their catch very choicely, with a girl's clear voice to lead them---      “Comment dit papa       --Margoton, ma mie?”  “Heathen language, to be sure,” said the thin voice again, as the chorus ceased: “thinks I to mysel' 'they be but Papisters,' an' my doubting mind is mightily reconcil'd to manslaughter.”  “I don't like beginning 'ithout the Cap'n,” observed Black Dick: “though I doubt something has miscarried. Else, how did that young spark ride in upon the mare?”  “An' that's what thy question should ha' been, Dick, with a pistol to his skull.”  “He'll keep till the morrow.”  “We'll give Settle half-an-hour more,” said the landlord: “Mary!” he push'd open the hatch, so that I had barely time to duck my head out of view, “fetch in the punch, girl. How did'st leave the young man i' the loft?'  “Asleep, or nearly,” answer'd Mary--      “Who hang'd hersel' in her gar-ters,      All for the love o' man--”  “--Anon, anon, master: wait only till I get the kettle on the boil.”  The hatch was slipp'd to again. I stood up and made a step toward the girl.  “How many are they?” I ask'd, jerking a finger in the direction of the parlor.  “A dozen all but one.”  “Where is the foreign guests' room?”  “Left hand, on the first landing.”  “The staircase?”  “Just outside the door.”  “Then sing--go on singing for your life.”  “But--”  “Sing!”  “Dear heart, they'll murder thee! Oh! for pity's sake, let go my wrist---      “'Lament, ye maids an' darters--'”  I stole to the door and peep'd out. A lantern hung in the passage, and showed the staircase directly in front of me. I stay'd for a moment to pull off my boots, and, holding them in my left hand, crept up the stairs. In the kitchen, the girl was singing and clattering the glasses together. Behind the door, at the head of the stairs, I heard voices talking. I slipp'd on my boots again and tapp'd on the panel.  “Come in!”  Let me try to describe that on which my eyes rested as I push'd the door wide. 'Twas a long room, wainscoted half up the wall in some dark wood, and in daytime lit by one window only, which now was hung with red curtains. By the fireplace, where a brisk wood fire was crackling, lean'd the young gentlewoman I had met at Hungerford, who, as she now turn'd her eyes upon me, ceas'd fingering the guitar or mandoline that she held against her waist, and raised her pretty head not without curiosity.  But 'twas on the table in the centre of the chamber that my gaze settled; and on two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6438"],["title","Fables for the Frivolous (#0)"],["body","the Michigan State University Online Digital Collection http://digital.lib.msu.edu/onlinecolls/collection.cfm?CID=3           FABLES FOR THE FRIVOLOUS  _(With Apologies to La Fontaine)_  By GUY WETMORE CARRYL  With Illustrations by Peter Newell   1898     FABLES FOR THE FRIVOLOUS   TO MY FATHER      NOTE: I have pleasure in acknowledging the courteous permission the editors to reprint in this form such of the following fables were originally published in Harper's periodicals, in _Life_, and _Munsey's Magazine_.

He also drove some iron pegs     Securely in the coping,   To tear the bare, defenceless legs     Of brats who, upward groping,       Might steal, despite the risk of fall,       The grapes that grew upon the wall.    One day a fox, on thieving bent,     A crafty and an old one,   Most shrewdly tracked the pungent scent     That eloquently told one       That grapes were ripe and grapes were good       And likewise in the neighborhood.    He threw some stones of divers shapes     The luscious fruit to jar off:   It made him ill to see the grapes     So near and yet so far off.       His throws were strong, his aim was fine,       But \"Never touched me!\" said the vine.    The farmer shouted, \"Drat the boys!\"   And, mounting on a ladder,   He sought the cause of all the noise;   No farmer could be madder,     Which was not hard to understand     Because the glass had cut his hand.    His passion he could not restrain,     But shouted out, \"You're thievish!\"   The fox replied, with fine disdain,     \"Come, country, don't be peevish.\"       (Now \"country\" is an epithet       One can't forgive, nor yet forget.)    The farmer rudely answered back     With compliments unvarnished,   And downward hurled the _bric-a-brac_     With which the wall was garnished,       In view of which demeanor strange,       The fox retreated out of range.    \"I will not try the grapes to-day,\"     He said. \"My appetite is   Fastidious, and, anyway,     I fear appendicitis.\"       (The fox was one of the _elite_       Who call it _site_ instead of _seet_.)    The moral is that if your host     Throws glass around his entry   You know it isn't done by most     Who claim to be the gentry,       While if he hits you in the head       You may be sure he's underbred.           THE PERSEVERING TORTOISE                 AND         THE PRETENTIOUS HARE    Once a turtle, finding plenty     In seclusion to bewitch,   Lived a _dolce far niente_     Kind of life within a ditch;   Rivers had no charm for him,     As he told his wife and daughter,   \"Though my friends are in the swim,     Mud is thicker far than water.\"    One fine day, as was his habit,     He was dozing in the sun,   When a young and flippant rabbit     Happened by the ditch to run:   \"Come and race me,\" he exclaimed,     \"Fat inhabitant of puddles.   Sluggard! You should be ashamed.     Such a life the brain befuddles.\"    This, of course, was banter merely,     But it stirred the torpid blood   Of the turtle, and severely     Forth he issued from the mud.   \"Done!\" he cried. The race began,     But the hare resumed his banter,   Seeing how his rival ran     In a most unlovely canter.    Shouting, \"Terrapin, you're bested!     You'd be wiser, dear old chap,   If you sat you down and rested     When you reach the second lap.\"   Quoth the turtle, \"I refuse.     As for you, with all your talking,   Sit on any lap you choose.     _I_ shall simply go on walking.\"    Now this sporting proposition     Was, upon its face, absurd;   Yet the hare, with expedition,     Took the tortoise at his word,   Ran until the final lap,     Then, supposing he'd outclassed him,   Laid him down and took a nap     And the patient turtle passed him!    Plodding on, he shortly made the     Line that marked the victor's goal;   Paused, and found he'd won, and laid the     Flattering unction to his soul.   Then in fashion grandiose,     Like an after-dinner speaker,   Touched his flipper to his nose,     And remarked, \"Ahem! Eureka!\"    And THE MORAL (lest you miss one)     Is: There's often time to spare,   And that races are (like this one)     Won not always by a hair.          THE PATRICIAN PEACOCKS                  AND         THE OVERWEENING JAY    Once a flock of stately peacocks     Promenaded on a green,   There were twenty-two or three cocks,     Each as proud as seventeen,   And a glance, however hasty,     Showed their plumage to be tasty;   Wheresoever one was placed, he     Was a credit to the scene.    Now their owner had a daughter     Who, when people came to call,   Used to say, \"You'd reelly oughter     See them peacocks on the mall.\"   Now this wasn't to her credit,     And her callers came to dread it,   For the way the lady said it     Wasn't _recherche_ at all.    But a jay that overheard it     From his perch upon a fir   Didn't take in how absurd it     Was to every one but her;   When they answered, \"You don't tell us!\"     And to see the birds seemed zealous   He became extremely jealous,     Wishing, too, to make a stir.    As the peacocks fed together     He would join them at their lunch,   Culling here and there a feather     Till he'd gathered quite a bunch;   Then this bird, of ways perfidious,     Stuck them on him most fastidious   Till he looked uncommon hideous,     Like a Judy or a Punch.    But the peacocks, when they saw him,     One and all began to haul,   And to harry and to claw him     Till the creature couldn't crawl;   While their owner's vulgar daughter,     When her startled callers sought her,   And to see the struggle brought her,     Only said, \"They're on the maul.\"    It was really quite revolting     When the tumult died away,   One would think he had been moulting     So dishevelled was the jay;   He was more than merely slighted,     He was more than disunited,   He'd been simply dynamited     In the fervor of the fray.    And THE MORAL of the verses     Is: That short men can't be tall.   Nothing sillier or worse is     Than a jay upon a mall.   And the jay opiniative     Who, because he's imitative,   Thinks he's highly decorative     Is the biggest jay of all.            THE ARROGANT FROG                 AND         THE SUPERIOR BULL    Once, on a time and in a place     Conducive to malaria,   There lived a member of the race     Of _Rana Temporaria_;       Or, more concisely still, a frog       Inhabited a certain bog.    A bull of Brobdingnagian size,     Too proud for condescension,   One morning chanced to cast his eyes     Upon the frog I mention;       And, being to the manner born,       Surveyed him with a lofty scorn.    Perceiving this, the bactrian's frame     With anger was inflated,   Till, growing larger, he became     Egregiously elated;       For inspiration's sudden spell       Had pointed out a way to swell.    \"Ha! ha!\" he proudly cried, \"a fig     For this, your mammoth torso!   Just watch me while I grow as big     As you--or even more so!\"       To which magniloquential gush       His bullship simply answered \"Tush!\"    Alas! the frog's success was slight,     Which really was a wonder,   In view of how with main and might     He strove to grow rotunder!       And, standing patiently the while,       The bull displayed a quiet smile.  [Illustration: \"HE STROVE TO GROW ROTUNDER\"]    But ah, the frog tried once too oft     And, doing so, he busted;   Whereat the bull discreetly coughed     And moved away, disgusted,       As well he might, considering       The wretched taste that marked the thing.        THE MORAL: Everybody knows       How ill a wind it is that blows.           THE DOMINEERING EAGLE                 AND       THE INVENTIVE BRATLING    O'er a small suburban borough     Once an eagle used to fly,   Making observations thorough     From his station in the sky,   And presenting the appearance     Of an animated V,   Like the gulls that lend coherence     Unto paintings of the sea.    Looking downward at a church in     This attractive little shire,   He beheld a smallish urchin     Shooting arrows at the spire;   In a spirit of derision,     \"Look alive!\" the eagle said;   And, with infinite precision,     Dropped a feather on his head.    Then the boy, annoyed distinctly     By the freedom of the bird,   Voiced his anger quite succinctly     In a single scathing word;   And he sat him on a barrow,     And he fashioned of this same   Eagle's feather such an arrow     As was worthy of the name.    Then he tried his bow, and, stringing"]]]
