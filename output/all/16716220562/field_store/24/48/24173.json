Beneath it, reclining in a long cane chair, lay Madame de Stämer. I think she was asleep; at any rate, she gave no sign, but lay there motionless, as Harley and I walked in through the open French window followed by Colonel Menendez.  Odd and unimportant details sometimes linger long in the memory. And I remember noticing that a needle of sunlight, piercing a crack in the gaily-striped awning rested upon a ring which Madame wore, so that the diamonds glittered like sparks of white-hot fire.     CHAPTER VI  THE BARRIER    Colonel Menendez conducted us to a long, lofty library in which might be detected the same note of un-English luxury manifested in the other appointments of the house. The room, in common with every other which I had visited in Cray’s Folly, was carried out in oak: doors, window frames, mantelpiece, and ceiling representing fine examples of this massive woodwork. Indeed, if the eccentricity of the designer of Cray’s Folly were not sufficiently demonstrated by the peculiar plan of the building, its construction wholly of granite and oak must have remarked him a man of unusual if substantial ideas.  There were four long windows opening on to a veranda which commanded a view of part of the rose garden and of three terraced lawns descending to a lake upon which I perceived a number of swans. Beyond, in the valley, lay verdant pastures, where cattle grazed. A lark hung carolling blithely far above, and the sky was almost cloudless. I could hear a steam reaper at work somewhere in the distance. This, with the more intimate rattle of a lawn-mower wielded by a gardener who was not visible from where I stood, alone disturbed the serene silence, except that presently I detected the droning of many bees among the roses. Sunlight flooded the prospect; but the veranda lay in shadow, and that long, oaken room was refreshingly cool and laden with the heavy perfume of the flowers.  From the windows, then, one beheld a typical English summer-scape, but the library itself struck an altogether more exotic note. There were many glazed bookcases of a garish design in ebony and gilt, and these were laden with a vast collection of works in almost every European language, reflecting perhaps the cosmopolitan character of the colonel’s household. There was strange Spanish furniture upholstered in perforated leather and again displaying much gilt. There were suits of black armour and a great number of Moorish ornaments. The pictures were fine but sombre, and all of the Spanish school.  One Velasquez in particular I noted with surprise, reflecting that, assuming it to be an authentic work of the master, my entire worldly possessions could not have enabled me to buy it. It was the portrait of a typical Spanish cavalier and beyond doubt a Menendez. In fact, the resemblance between the haughty Spanish grandee, who seemed about to step out of the canvas and pick a quarrel with the spectator, and Colonel Don Juan himself was almost startling. Evidently, our host had imported most of his belongings from Cuba.  “Gentlemen,” he said, as we entered, “make yourselves quite at home, I beg. All my poor establishment contains is for your entertainment and service.”  He drew up two long, low lounge chairs, the arms provided with receptacles to contain cooling drinks; and the mere sight of these chairs mentally translated me to the Spanish Main, where I pictured them set upon the veranda of that hacienda which had formerly been our host’s residence.  Harley and I became seated and Colonel Menendez disposed himself upon a leather-covered couch, nodding apologetically as he did so.  “My health requires that I should recline for a certain number of hours every day,” he explained. “So you will please forgive me.”  “My dear Colonel Menendez,” said Harley, “I feel sure that you are interrupting your siesta in order to discuss the unpleasant business which finds us in such pleasant surroundings. Allow me once again to suggest that we postpone this matter until, shall we say, after dinner?”  “No, no! No, no,” protested the Colonel, waving his hand deprecatingly. “Here is Pedro with coffee and some curaçao of a kind which I can really recommend, although you may be unfamiliar with it.”  I was certainly unfamiliar with the liqueur which he insisted we must taste, and which was contained in a sort of square, opaque bottle unknown, I think, to English wine merchants. Beyond doubt it was potent stuff; and some cigars which the Spaniard produced on this occasion and which were enclosed in little glass cylinders resembling test-tubes and elaborately sealed, I recognized to be priceless. They convinced me, if conviction had not visited me already, that Colonel Don Juan Sarmiento Menendez belonged to that old school of West Indian planters by whom the tradition of the Golden Americas had been for long preserved in the Spanish Main.  We discussed indifferent matters for a while, sipping this wonderful curaçao of our host’s. The effect created by the Colonel’s story faded entirely, and when, the latter being unable to conceal his drowsiness, Harley stood up, I took the hint with gratitude; for at that moment I did not feel in the mood to discuss serious business or indeed business of any kind.  “Gentlemen,” said the Colonel, also rising, in spite of our protests, “I will observe your wishes. My guests’ wishes are mine. We will meet the ladies for tea on the terrace.”  Harley and I walked out into the garden together, our courteous host standing in the open window, and bowing in that exaggerated fashion which in another might have been ridiculous but which was possible in Colonel Menendez, because of the peculiar grace of deportment which was his.  As we descended the steps I turned and glanced back, I know not why. But the impression which I derived of the Colonel’s face as he stood there in the shadow of the veranda was one I can never forget.  His expression had changed utterly, or so it seemed to me. He no longer resembled Velasquez’ haughty cavalier; gone, too, was the debonnaire bearing, I turned my head aside swiftly, hoping that he had not detected my backward glance.  I felt that I had violated hospitality. I felt that I had seen what I should not have seen. And the result was to bring about that which no story of West Indian magic could ever have wrought in my mind.  A dreadful, cold premonition claimed me, a premonition that this was a doomed man.  The look which I had detected upon his face was an indefinable, an indescribable look; but I had seen it in the eyes of one who had been bitten by a poisonous reptile and who knew his hours to be numbered. It was uncanny, unnerving; and whereas at first the atmosphere of Colonel Menendez’s home had seemed to be laden with prosperous security, now that sense of ease and restfulness was gone--and gone for ever.  “Harley,” I said, speaking almost at random, “this promises to be the strangest case you have ever handled.”  “Promises?” Paul Harley laughed shortly. “It _is_ the strangest case, Knox. It is a case of wheels within wheels, of mystery crowning mystery. Have you studied our host?”  “Closely.”  “And what conclusion have you formed?”  “None at the moment; but I think one is slowly crystalizing.”  “Hm,” muttered Harley, as we paced slowly on amid the rose trees. “Of one thing I am satisfied.”  “What is that?”  “That Colonel Menendez is not afraid of Bat Wing, whoever or whatever Bat Wing may be.”  “Not afraid?”  “Certainly he is not afraid, Knox. He has possibly been afraid in the past, but now he is resigned.”  “Resigned to what?”  “Resigned to death!”  “Good God, Harley, you are right!” I cried. “You are right! I saw it in his eyes as we left the library.”  Harley stopped and turned to me sharply.  “You saw this in the Colonel’s eyes?” he challenged.  “I did.”  “Which corroborates my theory,” he said, softly; “for _I_ had seen it elsewhere.”  “Where do you mean, Harley?”  “In the face of Madame de Stämer.”  “What?”  “Knox”--Harley rested his hand upon my arm and looked about him cautiously--“_she knows._”  “But knows what?”  “That is the question which we are here to answer, but I am as sure as it is humanly possible to be sure of anything that whatever Colonel Menendez may tell us to-night, one point at least he will withhold.”  “What do you expect him to withhold?”  “The meaning of the sign of the Bat Wing.”  “Then you think he knows its meaning?”  “He has told us that it is the death-token of Voodoo.”  I stared at Harley in perplexity.  “Then you believe his explanation to be false?”  “Not necessarily, Knox. It may be what he claims for it. But he is keeping something back. He speaks all the time from behind a barrier which he, himself, has deliberately erected against me.”  “I cannot understand why he should do so,” I declared, as he looked at me steadily. “Within the last few moments I have become definitely convinced that his appeal to you was no idle one. Therefore, why should he not offer you every aid in his power?”  “Why, indeed?” muttered Harley.  “The same thing,” I continued, “applies to Madame de Stämer. If ever I have seen love-light in a woman’s eyes I have seen it in hers, to-day, whenever her glance has rested upon Colonel Menendez. Harley, I believe she literally worships the ground he walks upon.”  “She does, she does!” cried my companion, and emphasized the words with beats of his clenched fist. “It is utterly, damnably mystifying. But I tell you, she knows, Knox, she knows!”  “You mean she knows that he is a doomed man?”  Harley nodded rapidly.  “They both know,” he replied; “but there is something which they dare not divulge.”  He glanced at me swiftly, and his bronzed face wore a peculiar expression.  “Have you had an opportunity of any private conversation with Miss Val Beverley?” he enquired.  “Yes,” I said. “Surely you remember that you found me chatting with her when you returned from your inspection of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6385"],["title","Simple Italian Cookery (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.     SIMPLE ITALIAN COOKERY  Antonia Isola     CONTENTS   Soups Macaroni and other Pastes Rice, Etc. Sauces Eggs Fish Vegetables Meats Salads Desserts Index     SOUPS   BEEF SOUP STOCK (_Brodo di Carne_)    1 pound of round of beef   2 quarts of water   2 small, new carrots, or 1/2 of an old carrot   1/2 pound of beef bones   2 small potatoes   1 onion   1 tomato, fresh or canned   Parsley  Boil the beef, bones, and vegetables in two quarts of water over a slow fire--adding pepper and salt. Skim occasionally, and after two hours add two tablespoons of sherry; then strain through fine soup-strainer or cheese-cloth. This is the basis of all the following soups, except when otherwise stated.  To make this stock richer, add a turkey leg to above receipt; boil one and a half hours, then add one-half a pound of finely chopped beef. Cook for half an hour longer, then strain.  To make meat jelly, add a little gelatine to the soup stock five minutes before straining.  To give a good dark color to the stock, add a few drops of \"caramel,\" which is prepared in the following manner:  Put three tablespoons of granulated sugar into a saucepan with a little water, and until the sugar has become dark and reddish; then add a little more water and boil again until the sugar is melted. Strain and pour into a bottle when the caramel will keep perfectly for several weeks.   CHICKEN BROTH (_Brodo di Capone_)  This is made like the meat stock, substituting a fowl in place of the beef and bones.   RICE SOUP (_Minestra di Riso_)    Meat stock   2 tablespoons of rice  Cover the rice with water and boil for ten minutes; then drain and add to the stock (after it has been strained), and boil for five or ten minutes more.   STRACCIATELLA SOUP (_Minestra di Stracciatella_)    1 egg   1/2 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese   1 tablespoon bread crumbs  Beat the egg, yolk and white together; add salt and the cheese, grated, and the bread crumbs; mix well together and add to the boiling stock (strained). Stir well with a fork to prevent the egg from setting, and boil for four or five minutes.   VEGETABLE CHOWDER (_Minestrone alla Milanese_)    1/2 quart of stock   2 slices of lean pork, or a ham bone   2 tomatoes, fresh or canned   1 cup of rice   2 tablespoons of dried beans   1 tablespoon of peas, fresh or canned   2 onions  Put into the stock the slices of pork, cut into small pieces; or, if desired, a ham bone may be substituted for the pork. Add the tomatoes, cut into small pieces also, the onions, in small pieces, and the rice. Boil all together until the rice is cooked. Then add the beans and the peas and cook a little longer. The soup is ready when it is thick. If desired, this chowder can be made with fish broth instead of the stock, and with the addition of shrimps which have been taken from their shells.  This dish can be served hot or cold.   FISH BROTH (_Brodo di Pesce_)    1 liberal pound of fresh codfish, or any other lean fish for boiling   1 quart of water   1 onion   Parsley   Salt and pepper  Boil until fish is thoroughly cooked; strain and serve.   CODFISH SOUP (_Zuppa di Merluzzo_)  Take one-half pound of salt codfish that has been soaked, cut it up into squares, but not small.  Prepare in a saucepan four tablespoons of good olive-oil, and one small onion cut into pieces. Cook the onion in the oil over a slow fire, without allowing the onion to become colored, then add a small bunch of parsley stems, a small piece of celery, a bay-leaf, and a small sprig of thyme. Cool for a few moments, then add two tomatoes, skinned and with the seeds removed, and cut into slices, two tablespoons of dry white wine, and one medium-sized potato, peeled and cut into slices, and, lastly, one cup of water.  When the potato is half cooked, add the codfish, then one-half tablespoon more of olive-oil. Remove the parsley stems, and put in instead one-half tablespoon of chopped-up parsley; add a good pinch of pepper, and some salt, if needed. When the vegetables are thoroughly cooked pour the soup over pieces of toasted or fried bread, and serve.   LENTIL SOUP (_Brodo di Lenticchie_)    3 tablespoons of dried lentils   1/2 tablespoon of butter   2 tablespoons of cream   Meat stock  Cover the lentils with water and boil until they are quite soft. Pass them through a colander or a sieve. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the lentils and cream, mixing well, then add a ladleful of the stock, and boil for a few minutes; then add the rest of the desired amount of stock, a ladleful at a time.   VEGETABLE SOUP (_Zuppa alla Primaverile_)  Take some cabbage, carrots, celery, onions, turnips, lettuce, squash, potatoes, beans, and peas. Chop each into very small pieces, wash and drain. Take a saucepan, put in a heaping tablespoon of butter; chop up another small piece of onion and add to butter and fry until onion is golden; then add all the vegetables, salt, and pepper, and cover the saucepan. When the vegetables are half cooked, and their juice has become absorbed, dissolve one tablespoon of tomato paste in one-third of a cup of hot water, and add. Instead of the tomato paste there may be added to the onion, before putting in the vegetables, one tomato, peeled and cut into small pieces. When the tomato is cooked add the vegetables. Then add water, a little at a time, until you have sufficient quantity for two persons. Take a slice of bread and cut into small squares or diamonds--toast or fry as desired--put these into the soup plates, and pour the soup (without straining) over them.   LETTUCE SOUP (_Zuppa di Lattuga_)    1 small lettuce   Meat stock   2 potatoes   The leaves of a head of celery   2 tablespoons of peas, fresh or canned   1 heaping tablespoon of flour  Put the potatoes, cold boiled, into the stock when it boils, add the celery leaves, the lettuce chopped up, the peas, and the flour mixed well with a little cold stock or water. Boil for one hour and a half, and serve with little squares of fried bread.   PUMPKIN SOUP (_Zuppa di Zucca_)    1 slice of pumpkin   2 tablespoons of butter   1/2 cup of water   1-1/2 cups of milk   1 tablespoon of sugar  Peel the pumpkin and remove the seeds, cut into small pieces, and put into a saucepan with the butter, the sugar, a pinch of salt, and the water. Boil for two hours, then drain and put back into the saucepan with the milk, which has been boiled. Allow it to come to a boil, and then serve it with squares of fried bread.   POTATO SOUP (_Zuppa alla Provinciale_)    2 large potatoes   3 tablespoons of cream or milk   2 tablespoons of butter   2 yolks of eggs   Soup stock  Boil the potatoes, then rub them through a sieve. Put them into a saucepan with the butter, a little salt, and the cream or milk. Simmer until it is thick, then add the yolks of the two eggs to form it into a paste. Turn out onto the bread-board, cut into small dice, and throw them into the stock, which must be boiling. If desired, before serving sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese into the soup.     MACARONI AND OTHER PASTES   MACARONI WITH TOMATO SAUCE (_Maccheroni al Sugo_)    2 quarts of water   3/4 pound of macaroni  Boil the water until it makes big bubbles. Add salt, then break the macaroni and put it in. Cover the saucepan and boil for fifteen minutes. The saucepan should not be too small, otherwise the macaroni will stick to the bottom.  Prepare the sauce as follows:  Take a good slice of ham fat, and chop very fine with it a piece of onion, a piece of celery, and some parsley. Then put this into a frying-pan and cook until the grease is colored. (If desired, add a small lump of butter.) When well colored add two tablespoons of tomato paste dissolved in a little hot water. Boil all together for fifteen minutes.  Drain the macaroni, and put it into the frying-pan with the sauce, mix well with fork and spoon over the fire, so that the macaroni will be thoroughly seasoned, then add three tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese, mix again, and serve.  If no tomato paste is available make the tomato sauce as follows:  Chop up fine one-quarter of an onion, a piece of celery the length of a finger, two or three basil-leaves, and a small bunch of parsley. Slice seven or eight tomatoes (fresh or canned), add salt and pepper, and put all on together to cook in four tablespoons of good olive-oil. Stir occasionally, and when it becomes as thick as cream, strain, and add the macaroni as before directed.   MACARONI WITH MEAT AND SAUCE (_Maccheroni al sugo di Carne_)  Take one-half pound of beef without fat. Prepare the ham fat as in the preceding receipt, chopped up with onion, celery, and parsley. Cut the meat into several pieces, put it with the fat, etc., into a frying-pan. Add salt and pepper. Cook until the meat is colored, then add two tablespoons of wine, white or red. When the wine is absorbed add two tablespoons of tomato paste dissolved in hot water. (Or tomato sauce as in preceding.) Boil all together for five minutes, with cover on the saucepan, then add one cup of boiling water, and allow it to simmer until the meat is thoroughly cooked--about one-half an hour. Boil and strain the macaroni as before, and pour over it the sauce from the meat. Mix well, and serve with the meat in the middle and the macaroni around it, with cheese (grated Parmesan) sprinkled over it.  This dish can be made with veal or mutton instead of the beef.   MACARONI WITH BUTTER AND CHEESE (_Maccheroni al Burro_)  Boil and drain the macaroni. Take four tablespoons of table-butter, three tablespoons of grated Parmesan cheese, add to the macaroni in the saucepan, mix well over the fire, and serve.   SICILIAN MACARONI WITH EGGPLANT  Slice one eggplant and put it under a weighted plate to extract the bitter juices. Then fry the slices delicately in lard.
