To Which are Added Other Tales (#2)"],["body","while Fanny tied up her bunches of flowers, she would repeat some verses from the Holy Scriptures, such as this, \"O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.\" And afterwards she would repeat such pretty lines as these:--    \"Not worlds on worlds, in varied form,      Need we, to tell a God is here;    The daisy, saved from winter's storm,      Speaks of his hand in lines as clear.    \"For who but He who formed the skies,      And poured the day-spring's living flood,    Wondrous alike in all He tries,      Could rear the daisy's simple bud!    \"Mould its green cup, its wiry stem,      Its fringed border nicely spin;    And cut the gold-embossed gem,      That, shrined in silver, shines within;    \"And fling it, unrestrained and free,      O'er hill, and dale, and desert sod,    That man, where'er he walks, may see,      In every step the trace of God.\"   \"And I, too, have had my daisy given to me,\" poor Mrs. Newton would say, with tearful eyes, as she gazed on her little flower-girl; \"I too have my daisy, and though it may be little cared for in the world, or trodden under foot of men, yet will it ever bear, I trust, the trace of God.\"  But it happened the very morning that the gentleman had given Fanny the half-sovereign in mistake, Mrs. Newton's money was quite spent; and she was much troubled, thinking the child must go the next morning to the garden without money to pay for her flowers, for she did not think it likely she would sell enough to buy what they required, and pay for them also; so she told Fanny she must ask Mr. Simpson to let her owe him for a day or two until she got a little money she expected.  Fanny went therefore, and said this to the kind man at the garden; and he put his hand on her head, and said, \"My pretty little girl, you may owe me as long as you please, for you are a good child, and God will prosper you.\"  So Fanny went back in great delight, and told this to Mrs. Newton; and to cheer her still more, she chose for her morning verse, the advice that our Lord gave to all those who were careful and troubled about the things of this life \"Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, oh ye of little faith?\"  And then she repeated some verses which both she and Mrs. Newton liked very much.    \"Lo! the lilies of the field,   How their leaves instruction yield!   Hark to nature's lesson, given   By the blessed birds of heaven.    \"Say with richer crimson glows,   The kingly mantle than the rose;   Say are kings more richly dressed,   Than the lily's glowing vest!  \"Grandmother I forget the next verse,\" said Fanny, interrupting herself; \"I know it is something about lilies not spinning; but then comes this verse--    \"Barns, nor hoarded store have we\"--  \"It is not the lilies, grandmother, but the blessed birds that are speaking now--    \"Barns, nor hoarded store have we,   Yet we carol joyously;   Mortals, fly from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.\"  Poor Mrs. Newton clasped her thin hands, and looked up, and prayed like the disciples, \"Lord, increase our faith!\"  \"Eh!\" said she, afterwards, \"is it not strange that we can trust our Lord and Saviour with the care of our souls for eternity, and we cannot trust Him with that of our bodies for a day.\"  Well! this was poor Mrs. Newton's state on that day, when the gentleman gave Fanny the half-sovereign instead of sixpence, for her flowers.  When the little flower-girl came back from her race with her two sixpences, she found the old vegetable-seller had got her three or four pennies more, by merely showing her basket, and telling why it was left at his stall; and so every one left a penny for the honest child, and hoped the gentleman would reward her well. The old man at the stall said it was very shabby of him only to give her sixpence; but when she went home with three sixpences and told Mrs. Newton this story, she kissed her little girl very fondly, but said the gentleman was good to give her sixpence, for he had no right to give her anything, she had only done her duty.  \"But, grandmother,\" said Fanny, \"when I saw that pretty half-sovereign dropping down to his purse, I could not help wishing he would give it to me.\"  \"And what commandment did you break then, my child?\"  \"Not the eighth--if I had kept the half-sovereign I should have broken it,\" said Fanny, \"for that says, thou shalt not steal--what commandment did I break, grandmother; for I did not steal?\"  \"When we desire to have what is not ours Fanny, what do we do? we covet; do we not?\"  \"Oh! yes--thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods,\" cried Fanny, \"that is the tenth commandment; and that half-sovereign was my neighbor's goods, and that fat gentleman was my neighbor. But, grandmother, it is very easy to break the tenth commandment.\"  \"Very easy indeed, my dear,\" said Mrs. Newton, with first a faint smile, and then a deep sigh, \"therefore,\" she added, \"we ought always to pray like David, 'Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity.'\"  There is a very common saying, that when things are at the worst they mend. It is hard to say when matters are at the worst; poor Mrs. Newton knew they might yet be worse with her; but certainly, they were very bad; and a few days after this, as Fanny was tying up her flowers as usual, she lay on her bed thinking what she was to do, and praying that God would direct her to some way of providing for the poor child.  While she was thinking and praying, tears stole down her face; Fanny saw them, and stopped her work, and looked sorrowfully at her--  \"Now you are crying again, grandmother, she said,\" and that's what makes me break the tenth commandment, for I can't help wishing the gentleman had given me that half-sovereign. But I will say the verses again to-day about the lilies and birds; for you know I said that morning--    'Mortals fly from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow,'  and when I came back with my three sixpences, you said God _had_ provided for the morrow, for you had only two or three pennies in the house when I went out.\"  \"And how many pennies, pray, have you in the house to-day?\" said a rather gruff voice at the door.  Mrs. Newton and Fanny started; but there, standing at the door, Fanny saw the fat gentleman who had given her the half-sovereign.  \"So you have been wishing for my gold, you little rogue,\" he said, looking as if he meant to frighten her. \"Never mind,\" he added, smiling, \"you are a good child, and did what was right; and I always meant to bring it back to you, but I have been kept rather busy these few days past. There it is for you, and try not to break the tenth commandment again.\" Then turning to Mrs. Newton, he said, \"We should not expect rewards, ma'am, for doing our duty, but if children do not meet with approbation when they do right, they may be discouraged, and perhaps think there is no use in being good: for they are silly little creatures, you know, and do not always recollect that God will reward the just one day if men do not.\"  \"Oh! sir!\" said poor Mrs. Newton, but the tears streamed down, and she could not say a word more. And there Fanny sat gazing on the half-sovereign, as if she was half stupefied.  \"Well, take up that bit of gold, and do what you like with it,\" said the fat gentleman; \"and then run off to sell your flowers, for we must not be idle because we have got enough for to-day. But do what you like with that money.\"  Fanny rose up from her seat, and looking very much as if she was moving in her sleep, with her wondering eyes fixed on the shining piece that lay in her hand, she walked slowly over to Mrs. Newton, and putting it into hers, said,--  \"May I go to the grocer's now, grandmother, and get you the tea for your breakfast?\"  \"Yes, my love,\" said Mrs. Newton, kissing her, \"and take care of this, and bring back the change carefully.\" Then turning to the gentleman, she said, \"I am not young, sir, and I am very, very poorly; I find it hard to go without my tea, but it is a luxury I have been obliged latterly to forego.\"  \"But could you not get tea on credit, from the grocer?\" said the gentleman.  \"Oh! yes, I believe so; but there would be no use in getting credit;\" said Mrs. Newton, \"for I am not certain of being better able to pay next week than I am this week; and when I have not the money to pay for what I wish to get, it is better to do without it, than to add to one's anxieties by running in debt. Do you not think so, sir?\"  \"Ma'am,\" said the old gentleman, sitting down, and resting his large silver-topped stick between his knees, \"it is of very little consequence what I think; but if you wish to know this, I will tell you that I think very well both of you and your little girl, who, as I have heard, for I have made inquiries about you both, is a dependant on your bounty. You have trained her up well, though I wouldn't praise the child to her face; and so take as much tea as you like till you hear from me again, and your grocer need be in no trouble about his bill.\"  So after the fat gentleman had made this rather bluff, but honest-hearted speech, and poor Mrs. Newton had wept, and thanked him in language that sounded more polite, the good old gentleman told her his whole history.  He began the world very poor, and without relations able to assist him; he was at last taken into the employment of a young merchant in the city; he had a turn for business, and having been able to render some important services to this young man, he was finally, to his own surprise, and that of every one else, taken into partnership.  \"During all this time,\" said he, \"I was attached from my boyhood to the daughter of the poor schoolmaster who first"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6757"],["title","Fanny, the Flower-Girl; or, Honesty Rewarded. To Which are Added Other Tales (#3)"],["body","me to read; I would not marry her while I was poor, for I thought that would be to make her wretched instead of happy; but when I was taken into partnership I thought my way was clear; I went off to Bethnal Green, and told Mary, and our wedding-day was settled at once. Well, we were glad enough, to be sure; but a very few days after, my partner called me into the private room, and said he wanted to consult me. He seemed in high spirits, and he told me he had just heard of a famous speculation, by which we could both make our fortunes at once. He explained what it was, and I saw with shame and regret, that no really honest man could join in it: I told him so; I told him plainly I would have nothing to do with it. You may think what followed; the deeds of partnership were not yet signed, and in short, in two or three days more I found myself poor Jack Walton again--indeed, poorer than I was before I was made one of the firm of Charters and Walton, for I had lost my employment.  \"Often and often I used to think that David said, he had never seen the righteous forsaken; yet I was suffering while the unrighteous were prospering. It was a sinful, and a self-righteous thought, and I was obliged to renounce it; when, after some time of trial, a gentleman sent for me--a man of wealth, and told me his son was going into business on his own account; that he had heard of my character, and of the cause of my leaving Mr. Charters; that he thought I would be just such a steady person as he wished his son to be with. In short, I began with him on a handsome salary; was soon made his partner; married Mary, and had my snug house in the country. Mr. Charters succeeded in that speculation; entered into several others, some of which were of a more fraudulent nature, failed, and was ruined. He ran off to America, and no one knows what became of him. I have left business some years. I purchased a nice property in the country, built a Church upon it, and have ever thanked God, who never forsakes those who wish to act righteously.  \"It pleased God to take all my sweet children from me--every state has its trials--the youngest was just like your little flower-girl.\"  Mrs. Newton was much pleased with this story; she then told her own, and little Fanny's. The fat gentleman's eyes were full of tears when she ended; when he was going away he put another half-sovereign into her hand, and saying, \"The first was for the child,\" walked out of the house.  A short time afterwards, a clergyman came to see Mrs. Newton--she was surprised; he sat and talked with her some time, and seemed greatly pleased with her sentiments, and all she told him of herself and Fanny. He then told her that he was the clergyman whom Mr. Walton, on the recommendation of the bishop of the diocese, had appointed to the church he had built; that Mr. Walton had sent him to see her, and had told him, if he was satisfied with all he saw and heard, to invite Mrs. Newton and the little flower-girl to leave London, and go and live in one of the nice widows' houses, which good Mr. Walton had built, near the pretty village where he lived.  Then there was great joy in poor Mrs. Newton's humble abode; Mrs. Newton was glad for Fanny's sake, and Fanny was glad for Mrs. Newton's sake, so both were glad, and both said--    \"Mortals fly from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.\"  But the only difference was, that Mrs. Newton said it with watery eyes and clasped hands, lying on her bed and looking up to heaven; and Fanny--merry little thing!--said it frisking and jumping about the room, clapping her hands together, and laughing her joy aloud.  Well, there was an inside place taken in the B---- coach, for Mrs. Newton and Fanny; and not only that, but kind Mrs. Walton sent up her own maid to London, to see that everything was carefully done, as the poor woman was ill, and help to pack up all her little goods; and, with her, she sent an entire new suit of clothes for the flower-girl.  They set off, and when they got near to the village the coachman stopped, and called out to know if it were the first, or the last of the red cottages he was to stop at; and Mrs. Walton's maid said, \"The last,--the cottage in the garden.\" So they stopped at such a pretty cottage, with a little garden before and behind it. Mr. Walton had known what it was to be poor, and so, when he grew rich, he had built these neat houses, for those who had been rich and become poor. They were intended chiefly for the widows of men of business, whose character had been good, but who had died without being able to provide for their families. He had made an exception in Mrs. Newton's case, and gave her one of the best houses, because it had a pretty garden, which he thought others might not care for so much.  They went inside, and there was such a neat kitchen, with tiles as red as tiles could be; a little dresser, with all sorts of useful things; a nice clock ticking opposite the fire-place, and a grate as bright as blacklead could make it. And then there was such a pretty little room at one side, with a rose tree against the window; and a little shelf for books against the wall; and a round table, and some chairs, and an easy couch. And there were two nice bedrooms overhead; and, better than all these, was a pretty garden. Oh! how happy was the little flower-girl; and how thankful was poor Mrs. Newton! The first thing she did was to go down on her knees and thank God.  Then Fanny was to go to the school, for Mrs. Walton had her own school, as well as the national school; but Fanny did not know enough to go to it, so she was sent to the national school first, and afterwards she went to the other, where about a dozen girls were instructed in all things that would be useful to them through life--whether they were to earn their bread at service, or to live in their own homes as daughters, wives, or mothers.  But every morning, before she went out, she did everything for her dear, good grandmother. She made her breakfast; she arranged her room; and she gathered some fresh flowers in the garden, and put them on the table in the little parlor. Oh! how happy was Fanny when she looked back, and saw how nice everything looked, and then went out singing to her school--    \"Barns, nor hoarded store have we,   Yet we carol joyously;   Mortals flee from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.\"  But God will not provide for the morrow, where people will do nothing to provide for themselves; and so Fanny, the flower-girl, knew, for surely God had blessed the labor of her childish hands.  Thus passed time away; and Fanny, under the instruction that she had at church, at school, and at home, \"grew in grace, and in the knowledge and love of God, and of Jesus Christ our Lord.\"  Good Mrs. Newton was much better in health, and used to walk about sometimes without any support but Fanny's arm, and so time went on till Fanny came to be about fifteen; and then Mrs. Newton, who was not always free from \"doubt and sorrow,\" began to think what was to become of her if she were to die.  So one day, when kind Mr. Walton, whom Fanny used once to call the fat gentleman, came in to see her, Mrs. Newton told him that she was beginning to feel anxious that Fanny should be put in a way of earning her own bread, in case she should be taken from her.  Mr. Walton listened to her, and then he said,--  \"You are very right and prudent, Mrs. Newton, but never mind that; I have not forgotten my little flower-girl, and her race after me that hot morning; if you were dead, I would take care of her; and if we both were dead, Mrs. Walton would take care of her; and if Mrs. Walton were dead, God would take care of her. I see you cannot yet learn the little lines she is so fond of--    \"'Mortals flee from doubt and sorrow,   God provideth for the morrow.'\"  Well, not very long after this conversation came a very warm day, and in all the heat of the sun came Mr. Walton, scarcely able to breathe, into Mrs. Newton's cottage; he was carrying his hat in one hand, and a newspaper in the other, and his face was very red and hot.  \"Well, Mrs. Newton,\" said he, \"what is all this about?--I can't make it out; here is your name in the paper!\"  \"My name, sir!\" said Mrs. Newton, staring at the paper.  \"Aye, indeed is it,\" said Mr. Walton, putting on his spectacles, and opening the paper at the advertisement side,--\"see here!\"  And he began to read,--  \"If Mrs. Newton, who lived about fifteen years ago near the turnpike on the P---- road, will apply to Messrs. Long and Black, she will hear of something to her advantage. Or should she be dead, any person who can give information respecting her and her family, will be rewarded.\"  Mrs. Newton sat without the power of speech--so much was she surprised; at last she said, \"It is Fanny's father!--I know, I am sure it can be no one else!\"  Mr. Walton looked surprised, for he had never thought of this; he was almost sorry to think his little flower-girl should have another protector. At length he said it must be as Mrs. Newton thought, and he would go up to London himself next day, and see Mr. Long and Mr. Black. So he went; and two days afterwards, when Fanny had returned from Mrs. Walton's school, and was sitting with Mrs. Newton in the little shady arbor they had made in the garden, and talking over early days, when they used to sit in another arbor, and Fanny used to learn her first lessons from flowers, then came Mr. Walton walking up the path towards them, and with him was a fine-looking man, of about forty-five years of age.  Mrs. Newton trembled, for when she looked in his face she remembered the features; and she said to herself, \"Now, if he takes my Fanny from me?--and if he should be a bad man?\" But when this man came nearer, he stepped hastily beyond Mr. Walton, and catching Mrs. Newton's hands, he was just going to drop on his knees before her, when he saw Fanny staring at him; and a father's feelings overcame "]]]
