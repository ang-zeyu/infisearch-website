I felt, rather than saw, his rush toward me; leap'd aside; and brought down my chair with a crash on his skull. He went down like a ninepin, but scrambled up in a trice, and was running for the window.  There was a shout below as the Captain thrust the lattice open: another, and the two dark forms had clambered through the purple square of the casement, and dropped into the bowling-green below.  By this, I had made my way across the room, and found Anthony sunk against the wall, with his feet outstretched. There was something he held out toward me, groping for my hand and at the same time whispering in a thick, choking voice--  “Here, Jack, here: pocket it quick!”  'Twas a letter, and as my fingers closed on it they met a damp smear, the meaning of which was but too plain.  “Button it--sharp--in thy breast: now feel for my sword.”  “First let me tend thy hurt, dear lad.”  “Nay--quickly, my sword! 'Tis pretty, Jack, to hear thee say 'dear lad.' A cheat to die like this--could have laugh'd for years yet. The dice were cogg'd--hast found it?”  I groped beside him, found the hilt, and held it up.  “So--'tis thine, Jack: and my mare, Molly, and the letter to take. Say to Delia--Hark! they are on the stairs. Say to--”  With a shout the door was flung wide, and on the threshold stood the Watch, their lanterns held high and shining in Anthony's white face, and on the black stain where his doublet was thrown open.  In numbers they were six or eight, led by a small, wrynecked man that held a long staff, and wore a gilt chain over his furr'd collar. Behind, in the doorway, were huddled half a dozen women, peering: and Master Davenant at the back of all, his great face looming over their shoulders like a moon.  “Now, speak up, Master Short!”  “Aye, that I will--that I will: but my head is considering of affairs,”  answered Master Short--he of the wryneck. “One, two, three--” He look'd round the room, and finding but one capable of resisting (for the potboy was by this time in a fit), clear'd his throat, and spoke up--  “In the king's name, I arrest you all--so help me God! Now what's the matter?”  “Murder,” said I, looking up from my work of staunching Anthony's wound.  “Then forbear, and don't do it.”  “Why, Master Short, they've been forbearin' these ten minutes,” a woman's voice put in.  “Hush, and hear Master Short: he knows the law, an' all the dubious maxims of the same.”  “Aye, aye: he says forbear i' the King's name, which is to say, that other forbearing is neither law nor grace. Now then, Master Short!”  Thus exhorted, the man of law continued--  “I charge ye as honest men to disperse!”  “Odds truth, Master Short, why you've just laid 'em under arrest!”  “H'm, true: then let 'em stay so--in the king's name--and have done with it.”  Master Short, in fact, was growing testy: but now the women push'd by him, and, by screaming at the sight of blood, put him out of all patience. Dragging them back by the skirts, he told me he must take the depositions, and pull'd out pen and ink horn.  “Sirs,” said I, laying poor Anthony's head softly back, “you are too late: whilst ye were cackling my friend is dead.”  “Then, young man, thou must come along.”  “Come along?”  “The charge is _homocidium_, or manslaying, with or without malice prepense--”  “But--” I look'd round. The potboy was insensible, and my eyes fell on Master Davenant, who slowly shook his head.  “I'll say not a word,” said he, stolidly: “lost twenty pound, one time, by a lawsuit.”  “Pack of fools!” I cried, driven beyond endurance. “The guilty ones have escap'd these ten minutes. Now stop me who dares!”  And dashing my left fist on the nose of a watchman who would have seized me, I clear'd a space with Anthony's sword, made a run for the casement, and dropp'd out upon the bowling-green.  A pretty shout went up as I pick'd myself off the turf and rush'd for the back door. 'Twas unbarr'd, and in a moment I found myself tearing down the passage and out into the Corn Market, with a score or so tumbling downstairs at my heels, and yelling to stop me. Turning sharp to my right, I flew up Ship Street, and through the Turl, and doubled back up the High Street, sword in hand. The people I pass'd were too far taken aback, as I suppose, to interfere. But a many must have join'd in the chase: for presently the street behind me was thick with the clatter of footsteps and cries of “A thief--a thief! Stop him!”  At Quater Voies I turn'd again, and sped down toward St. Aldate's, thence to the left by Wild Boar Street, and into St. Mary's Lane. By this, the shouts had grown fainter, but were still following. Now I knew there was no possibility to get past the city gates, which were well guarded at night. My hope reach'd no further than the chance of outwitting the pursuit for a while longer. In the end I was sure the potboy's evidence would clear me, and therefore began to enjoy the fun. Even my certain expulsion from College on the morrow seem'd of a piece with the rest of events and (prospectively) a matter for laughter. For the struggle at the “Crown” had unhinged my wits, as I must suppose and you must believe, if you would understand my behavior in the next half hour.  A bright thought had struck me: and taking a fresh wind, I set off again round the corner of Oriel College, and down Merton Street toward Master Timothy Carter's house, my mother's cousin. This gentleman--who was town clerk to the Mayor and Corporation of Oxford--was also in a sense my guardian, holding it trust about L200 (which was all my inheritance), and spending the same jealously on my education. He was a very small, precise lawyer, about sixty years old, shaped like a pear, with a prodigious self-important manner that came of associating with great men: and all the knowledge I had of him was pick'd up on the rare occasions (about twice a year) that I din'd at his table. He had early married and lost an aged shrew, whose money had been the making of him: and had more respect for law and authority than any three men in Oxford. So that I reflected, with a kind of desperate hilarity, on the greeting he was like to give me.  This kinsman of mine had a fine house at the east end of Merton Street as you turn into Logic Lane: and I was ten yards from the front door, and running my fastest, when suddenly I tripp'd and fell headlong.  Before I could rise, a hand was on my shoulder, and a voice speaking in my ear--  “Pardon, comrade. We are two of a trade, I see.”  'Twas a fellow that had been lurking at the corner of the lane, and had thrust out a leg as I pass'd. He was pricking up his ears now to the cries of “Thief--thief!” that had already reach'd the head of the street, and were drawing near.  “I am no thief,” said I.  “Quick!” He dragged me into the shadow of the lane. “Hast a crown in thy pocket?”  “Why?”  “Why, for a good turn. I'll fog these gentry for thee. Many thanks, comrade,” as I pull'd out the last few shillings of my pocket money. “Now pitch thy sword over the wall here, and set thy foot on my hand. 'Tis a rich man's garden, t'other side, that I was meaning to explore myself; but another night will serve.”  “'Tis Master Carter's,” said I; “and he's my kinsman.”  “The devil!--but never mind, up with thee! Now mark a pretty piece of play. 'Tis pity thou shouldst be across the wall and unable to see.”  He gave a great hoist: catching at the coping of the wall, I pull'd myself up and sat astride of it.  “Good turf below--ta-ta, comrade!”  By now, the crowd was almost at the corner. Dropping about eight feet on to good turf, as the fellow had said, I pick'd myself up and listen'd.  “Which way went he?” call'd one, as they came near.  “Down the street!” “No: up the lane!'” “Hush!” “Up the lane, I'll be sworn.” “Here, hand the lantern!” &c., &c.  While they debated, my friend stood close on the other side of the wall: but now I heard him dash suddenly out, and up the lane for his life. “There he goes!” “Stop him!” the cries broke out afresh. “Stop him, i' the king's name!” The whole pack went pelting by, shouting, stumbling, swearing.  For two minutes or more the stragglers continued to hurry past by ones and twos. As soon as their shouts died away, I drew freer breath and look'd around.  I was in a small, turfed garden, well stock'd with evergreen shrubs, at the back of a tall house that I knew for Master Carter's. But what puzzled me was a window in the first floor, very brightly lit, and certain sounds issuing therefrom that had no correspondence with my kinsman's reputation.      “It was a frog leap'd into a pool--      Fol--de--riddle, went souse in the middle!      Says he, This is better than moping in school.      With a--”  “--Your Royal Highness, have some pity! What hideous folly! Oh, dear, dear--”      “With a fa-la-tweedle-tweedle,      Tiddifol-iddifol-ido!”  “--Your Royal Highness, I _cannot_ sing the dreadful stuff! Think of my grey hairs!”  “Tush! Master Carter--nonsense; 'tis choicely well sung. Come, brother, the chorus!”    “With a fa-la--”   And the chorus was roar'd forth, with shouts of laughter and clinking of glasses. Then came an interval of mournful appeal, and my kinsman's voice was again lifted----      “He scattered the tadpoles, and set 'em agog,      Hey! nod-noddy-all head and no body!      Oh, mammy! Oh, minky!--”  “--O, mercy, mercy! it makes me sweat for shame.”  Now meantime I had been searching about the garden, and was lucky enough to find a tool shed, and inside of this a ladder hanging, which now I carried across and planted beneath the window. I had a shrewd notion of what I should find at the top, remembering now to have heard that the Princes Rupert and Maurice were lodging with Master Carter: but the truth beat all my fancies.  For climbing softly up and looking in, I beheld my poor kinsman perch'd on his chair a-top of the table, in the midst of glasses, decanters, and desserts: his wig askew, his face white, save where, between the eyes, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6437"],["title","The Splendid Spur (#5)"],["body","medlar had hit and broken, and his glance shifting wildly between the two princes, who in easy postures, loose and tipsy, lounged on either side of him, and beat with their glasses on the board.  “Bravissimo! More, Master Carter--more!”      “O mammy, O nunky, here's cousin Jack Frog--      With a fa-la--”  I lifted my knuckles and tapp'd on the pane; whereon Prince Maurice starts up with an oath, and coming to the window, flings it open.  “Pardon, your Highness,” said I, and pull'd myself past him into the room, as cool as you please.  'Twas worth while to see their surprise. Prince Maurice ran back to the table for his sword: his brother (being more thoroughly drunk) dropped a decanter on the floor, and lay back staring in his chair. While as for my kinsman, he sat with mouth wide and eyes starting, as tho' I were a very ghost. In the which embarrassment I took occasion to say, very politely--  “Good evening, nunky!”  “Who the devil is this?” gasps Prince Rupert.  “Why the fact is, your Highnesses,” answered I, stepping up and laying my sword on the table, while I pour'd out a glass, “Master Timothy Carter here is my guardian, and has the small sum of L200 in his possession for my use, of which I happen to-night to stand in immediate need. So you see--” I finished the sentence by tossing off a glass. “This is rare stuff!” I said.  “Blood and fury!” burst out Prince Rupert, fumbling for his sword, and then gazing, drunk and helpless.  “Two hundred pound! Thou jackanapes--” began Master Carter.  “I'll let you off with fifty to-night,” said I.  “Ten thousand--!”  “No, fifty. Indeed, nunky,” I went on, “'tis very simple. I was at the 'Crown' tavern--”  “At a tavern!”  “Aye, at a game of dice--”  “Dice!”  “Aye, and a young man was killed--”  “Thou shameless puppy! A man murder'd!”  “Aye, nunky; and the worst is they say 'twas I that kill'd him.”  “He's mad. The boy's stark raving mad!” exclaim'd my kinsman. “To come here in this trim!”  “Why, truly, nunky, thou art a strange one to talk of appearances. Oh, dear!” and I burst into a wild fit of laughing, for the wine had warm'd me up to play the comedy out. “To hear thee sing      “'With a fa--la--tweedle--tweedle!'  and--Oh, nunky, that medlar on thy face is so funny!”  “In Heaven's name, stop!” broke in the Prince Maurice. “Am I mad, or only drunk? Rupert, if you love me, say I am no worse than drunk.”  “Lord knows,” answer'd his brother. “I for one was never this way before.”  “Indeed, your Highnesses be only drunk,” said I, “and able at that to sign the order that I shall ask you for.”  “An order!”  “To pass the city gates to-night.”  “Oh, stop him somebody,” groan'd Prince Rupert: “my head is whirling.”  “With your leave,” I explain'd, pouring out another glassful: “tis the simplest matter, and one that a child could understand. You see, this young man was kill'd, and they charg'd me with it; so away I ran, and the Watch after me; and therefore I wish to pass the city gates. And as I may have far to travel, and gave my last groat to a thief for hoisting me over Master Carter's wall--”  “A thief--my wall!” repeated Master Carter. “Oh well is thy poor mother in her grave!”  “--Why, therefore I came for money,” I wound up, sipping the wine, and nodding to all present.  'Twas at this moment that, catching my eye, the Prince Maurice slapp'd his leg, and leaning back, broke into peal after peal of laughter. And in a moment his brother took the jest also; and there we three sat and shook, and roar'd unquenchably round Master Carter, who, staring blankly from one to another, sat gaping, as though the last alarm were sounding in his ears.  “Oh! oh! oh! Hit me on the back, Maurice!”  “Oh! oh! I cannot--'tis killing me--Master Carter, for pity's sake, look not so; but pay the lad his money.”  “Your Highness----”  “Pay it I say; pay it: 'tis fairly won.”  “Fifty pounds!”  “Every doit,” said I: “I'm sick of schooling.”  “Be hang'd if I do!” snapp'd Master Carter.  “Then be hang'd, sir, but all the town shall hear to-morrow of the frog and the pool! No, sir: I am off to see the world----      “'Says he: “This is better than moping in school!”'”  “Your Highnesses,” pleaded the unhappy man, “if, to please you, I sang that idiocy, which, for fifty years now, I had forgotten----”  “Exc'll'nt shong,” says Prince Rupert, waking up; “less have't again!”         *       *       *       *       *  To be short, ten o'clock was striking from St. Mary's spire when, with a prince on either side of me, and thirty guineas in my pocket (which was all the loose gold he had), I walked forth from Master Carter's door. To make up the deficiency, their highnesses had insisted on furnishing me with a suit made up from the simplest in their joint wardrobes--riding-boots, breeches, buff-coat, sash, pistols, cloak, and feather'd hat, all of which fitted me excellently well. By the doors of Christ Church, before we came to the south gate, Prince Rupert, who had been staggering in his walk, suddenly pull'd up, and leaned against the wall.  “Why--odd's my life--we've forgot a horse for him!” he cried.  “Indeed, your Highness,” I answered, “if my luck holds the same, I shall find one by the road.” (How true this turned out you shall presently hear.)  There was no difficulty at the gate, where the sentry recogniz'd the two princes and open'd the wicket at once. Long after it had clos'd behind me, and I stood looking back at Oxford towers, all bath'd in the winter moonlight, I heard the two voices roaring away up the street:      “It was a frog leap'd into a pool--”  At length they died into silence; and, hugging the king's letter in my breast, I stepped briskly forward on my travels.     CHAPTER IV.  I TAKE THE ROAD.   So puffed up was I by the condescension of the two princes, and my head so busy with big thoughts, that not till I was over the bridges and climbing the high ground beyond South Hincksey, with a shrewd northeast wind at my back, could I spare time for a second backward look. By this, the city lay spread at my feet, very delicate and beautiful in a silver network, with a black clump or two to southward, where the line of Bagley trees ran below the hill. I pulled out the letter that Anthony had given me. In the moonlight the brown smear of his blood was plain to see, running across the superscription:  “_To our trusty and well beloved Sir Ralph Hopton, at our Army in Cornwall--these._”  'Twas no more than I look'd for; yet the sight of it and the king's red seal, quicken'd my step as I set off again. And I cared not a straw for Dr. Kettle's wrath on the morrow.  Having no desire to fall in with any of the royal outposts that lay around Abingdon, I fetched well away to the west, meaning to shape my course for Faringdon, and so into the great Bath road. 'Tis not my purpose to describe at any length my itinerary, but rather to reserve my pen for those more moving events that overtook me later. Only in the uncertain light I must have taken a wrong turn to the left (I think near Besselsleigh) that led me round to the south: for, coming about daybreak to a considerable town, I found it to be, not Faringdon, but Wantage. There was no help for it, so I set about enquiring for a bed. The town was full, and already astir with preparations for cattle-fair; and neither at the “Bear” nor the “Three Nuns” was there a bed to be had. But at length at the “Boot” tavern--a small house, I found one just vacated by a couple of drovers, and having cozen'd the chambermaid to allow me a clean pair of sheets, went upstairs very drowsily, and in five minutes was sleeping sound.  I awoke amid a clatter of voices, and beheld the room full of womankind.  “He's waking,” said one.  “Tis a pity, too, to be afflicted thus--and he such a pretty young man!”  This came from the landlady, who stood close, her hand shaking my shoulder roughly.  “What's amiss?” I asked, rubbing my eyes.  “Why, 'tis three of the afternoon.”  “Then I'll get up, as soon as you retire.”  “Lud! we've been trying to wake thee this hour past; but 'twas sleep--sleep!”  “I'll get up, I tell you.”  “Thought thee'd ha' slept through the bed and right through to the floor,” said the chambermaid by the door, tittering.  “Unless you pack and go, I'll step out amongst you all!”  Whereat they fled with mock squeals, calling out that the very thought made them blush: and left me to dress.  Downstairs I found a giant's breakfast spread for me, and ate the hole, and felt the better for it: and thereupon paid my scot, resisting the landlady's endeavor to charge me double for the bed, and walked out to see the town.  “Take care o' thysel',” the chambermaid bawled after me; “nor flourish thy attainments abroad, lest they put thee in a show!”  Dark was coming on fast: and to my chagrin (for I had intended purchasing a horse) the buying and selling of the fair were over, the cattle-pens broken up, and the dealers gather'd round the fiddlers, ballad singers, and gingerbread stalls. There were gaming booths, too, driving a brisk trade at Shovel-board, All-fours, and Costly Colors; and an eating tent, whence issued a thick reek of cooking and loud rattle of plates. Over the entrance, I remember, was set a notice: “_Dame Alloway from Bartholomew Fair. Here are the best geese, and she does them as well as ever she did_.” I jostled my way along, keeping tight hold on my pockets, for fear of cut-purses; when presently, about halfway down the street, there arose the noise of shouting. The crowd made a rush toward it; and in a minute I was left alone, standing before a juggler who had a sword halfway down his throat, and had to draw it out again before he could with any sufficiency curse the defection of his audience; but offered to pull out a tooth for me if I wanted it.  I left him, and running after the crowd soon learn'd the cause of this tumult.  'Twas a meagre old rascal that someone had charged with picking pockets: and they were dragging him off to be duck'd.
