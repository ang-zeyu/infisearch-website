When,--have mercy, Lord, on us!   The whole face turned upon me full.     And I spread myself beneath it,     As when the bleacher spreads, to seethe it   In the cleansing sun, his wool,--   Steeps in the flood of noontide whiteness     Some denied, discoloured web--   So lay I, saturate with brightness.     And when the flood appeared to ebb,   Lo, I was walking, light and swift,     With my senses settling fast and steadying,   But my body caught up in the whirl and drift     Of the vesture's amplitude, still eddying   On, just before me, still to be followed,     As it carried me after with its motion:   What shall I say?--as a path were hollowed     And a man went weltering through the ocean,   Sucked along in the flying wake   Of the luminous water-snake.   Darkness and cold were cloven, as through   I passed, upborne yet walking too.   And I turned to myself at intervals,--   \"So he said, so it befalls.   \"God who registers the cup     \"Of mere cold water, for his sake   \"To a disciple rendered up,     \"Disdains not his own thirst to slake   \"At the poorest love was ever offered:   \"And because my heart I proffered,   \"With true love trembling at the brim,   \"He suffers me to follow him   \"For ever, my own way,--dispensed   \"From seeking to be influenced   \"By all the less immediate ways     \"That earth, in worships manifold,   \"Adopts to reach, by prayer and praise,     \"The garment's hem, which, lo, I hold!\"     X    And so we crossed the world and stopped.     For where am I, in city or plain,     Since I am 'ware of the world again?   And what is this that rises propped   With pillars of prodigious girth?   Is it really on the earth,   This miraculous Dome of God?   Has the angel's measuring-rod   Which numbered cubits, gem from gem,   'Twixt the gates of the New Jerusalem,   Meted it out,--and what he meted,   Have the sons of men completed?   --Binding, ever as he bade,   Columns in the colonnade   With arms wide open to embrace   The entry of the human race   To the breast of... what is it, yon building,   Ablaze in front, all paint and gilding,   With marble for brick, and stones of price   For garniture of the edifice?   Now I see; it is no dream;   It stands there and it does not seem;   For ever, in pictures, thus it looks,   And thus I have read of it in books   Often in England, leagues away,   And wondered how these fountains play,   Growing up eternally   Each to a musical water-tree,   Whose blossoms drop, a glittering boon,   Before my eyes, in the light of the moon,   To the granite layers underneath.   Liar and dreamer in your teeth!   I, the sinner that speak to you,   Was in Rome this night, and stood, and knew   Both this and more. For see, for see,   The dark is rent, mine eye is free   To pierce the crust of the outer wall,   And I view inside, and all there, all,   As the swarming hollow of a hive,   The whole Basilica alive!   Men in the chancel, body and nave,   Men on the pillars' architrave,   Men on the statues, men on the tombs   With popes and kings in their porphyry wombs,   All famishing in expectation   Of the main-altar's consummation.   For see, for see, the rapturous moment   Approaches, and earth's best endowment   Blends with heaven's; the taper-fires   Pant up, the winding brazen spires   Heave loftier yet the baldachin; [Footnote: Canopy over the High Altar.]   The incense-gaspings, long kept in,   Suspire in clouds; the organ blatant   Holds his breath and grovels latent,   As if God's hushing finger grazed him,   (Like Behemoth when he praised him)   At the silver bell's shrill tinkling,   Quick cold drops of terror sprinkling   On the sudden pavement strewed   With faces of the multitude.   Earth breaks up, time drops away,   In flows heaven, with its new day   Of endless life, when He who trod,   Very man and very God,   This earth in weakness, shame and pain,   Dying the death whose signs remain   Up yonder on the accursed tree,--   Shall come again, no more to be   Of captivity the thrall,   But the one God, All in all,   King of kings, Lord of lords,   As His servant John received the words,   \"I died, and live for evermore!\"     XI    Yet I was left outside the door.   \"Why sit I here on the threshold-stone   \"Left till He return, alone   \"Save for the garment's extreme fold   \"Abandoned still to bless my hold?\"   My reason, to my doubt, replied,   As if a book were opened wide,   And at a certain page I traced   Every record undefaced,   Added by successive years,--   The harvestings of truth's stray ears   Singly gleaned, and in one sheaf   Bound together for belief.   Yes, I said--that he will go   And sit with these in turn, I know.   Their faith's heart beats, though her head swims   Too giddily to guide her limbs,   Disabled by their palsy-stroke   From propping mine. Though Rome's gross yoke   Drops off, no more to be endured,   Her teaching is not so obscured   By errors and perversities,   That no truth shines athwart the lies:   And he, whose eye detects a spark   Even where, to man's, the whole seems dark,   May well see flame where each beholder   Acknowledges the embers smoulder.   But I, a mere man, fear to quit   The clue God gave me as most fit   To guide my footsteps through life's maze,   Because himself discerns all ways   Open to reach him: I, a man   Able to mark where faith began   To swerve aside, till from its summit   Judgment drops her damning plummet,   Pronouncing such a fatal space   Departed from the founder's base:   He will not bid me enter too,   But rather sit, as now I do,   Awaiting his return outside.   --'Twas thus my reason straight replied   And joyously I turned, and pressed   The garment's skirt upon my breast,   Until, afresh its light suffusing me,   My heart cried--What has been abusing me   That I should wait here lonely and coldly,   Instead of rising, entering boldly,   Baring truth's face, and letting drift   Her veils of lies as they choose to shift?   Do these men praise him? I will raise   My voice up to their point of praise!   I see the error; but above   The scope of error, see the love.--   Oh, love of those first Christian days!   --Fanned so soon into a blaze,   From the spark preserved by the trampled sect,   That the antique sovereign Intellect   Which then sat ruling in the world,   Like a change in dreams, was hurled   From the throne he reigned upon:   You looked up and he was gone.   Gone, his glory of the pen!   --Love, with Greece and Rome in ken,   Bade her scribes abhor the trick   Of poetry and rhetoric,   And exult with hearts set free,   In blessed imbecility   Scrawled, perchance, on some torn sheet   Leaving Sallust incomplete   Gone, his pride of sculptor, painter!   --Love, while able to acquaint her   While the thousand statues yet   Fresh from chisel, pictures wet   From brush, she saw on every side,   Chose rather with an infant's pride   To frame those portents which impart   Such unction to true Christian Art.   Gone, music too! The air was stirred   By happy wings: Terpander's* bird   *[Footnote: Terpander, a famous Lesbian musician and lyric poet, 670 B.C.]   (That, when the cold came, fled away)   Would tarry not the wintry day,--   As more-enduring sculpture must,   Till filthy saints rebuked the gust   With which they chanced to get a sight   Of some dear naked Aphrodite   They glanced a thought above the toes of,   By breaking zealously her nose off.   Love, surely, from that music's lingering,   Might have filched her organ-fingering,   Nor chosen rather to set prayings   To hog-grunts, praises to horse-neighings.   Love was the startling thing, the new:   Love was the all-sufficient too;   And seeing that, you see the rest:   As a babe can find its mother's breast   As well in darkness as in light,   Love shut our eyes, and all seemed right.   True, the world's eyes are open now:   --Less need for me to disallow   Some few that keep Love's zone unbuckled,   Peevish as ever to be suckled,   Lulled by the same old baby-prattle   With intermixture of the rattle,   When she would have them creep, stand steady   Upon their feet, or walk already,   Not to speak of trying to climb.   I will be wise another time,   And not desire a wall between us,     When next I see a church-roof cover   So many species of one genus,     All with foreheads bearing _lover_   Written above the earnest eyes of them;     All with breasts that beat for beauty,   Whether sublimed, to the surprise of them,     In noble daring, steadfast duty,   The heroic in passion, or in action,--   Or, lowered for sense's satisfaction,   To the mere outside of human creatures,   Mere perfect form and faultless features.   What? with all Rome here, whence to levy     Such contributions to their appetite,   With women and men in a gorgeous bevy,     They take, as it were, a padlock, clap it tight   On their southern eyes, restrained from     feeding   On the glories of their ancient reading,   On the beauties of their modern singing,   On the wonders of the builder's bringing,   On the majesties of Art around them,--     And, all these loves, late struggling incessant,   When faith has at last united and bound them,     They offer up to God for a present?   Why, I will, on the whole, be rather proud of it,--     And, only taking the act in reference   To the other recipients who might have allowed it,     I will rejoice that God had the preference.     XII    So I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6670"],["title","Christmas Eve (#3)"],["body","up my new resolves:     Too much love there can never be.   And where the intellect devolves     Its function on love exclusively,   I, a man who possesses both,   Will accept the provision, nothing loth,   --Will feast my love, then depart elsewhere,   That my intellect may find its share.   And ponder, O soul, the while thou departest,   And see them applaud the great heart of the artist,   Who, examining the capabilities     Of the block of marble he has to fashion     Into a type of thought or passion,--   Not always, using obvious facilities,   Shapes it, as any artist can,   Into a perfect symmetrical man,   Complete from head to foot of the life-size,   Such as old Adam stood in his wife's eyes,--   But, now and then, bravely aspires to consummate   A Colossus by no means so easy to come at,   And uses the whole of his block for the bust,     Leaving the mind of the public to finish it,   Since cut it ruefully short he must:   On the face alone he expends his devotion,     He rather would mar than resolve to diminish it,   --Saying, \"Applaud me for this grand notion   \"Of what a face may be! As for completing it     \"In breast and body and limbs, do that, you!\"   All hail! I fancy how, happily meeting it,     A trunk and legs would perfect the statue,   Could man carve so as to answer volition.     And how much nobler than petty cavils,     Were a hope to find, in my spirit-travels,   Some artist of another ambition,   Who, having a block to carve, no bigger,   Has spent his power on the opposite quest,     And believed to begin at the feet was best--   For so may I see, ere I die, the whole figure!     XIII    No sooner said than out in the night!   My heart lighter and more light:   And still, as before, I was walking swift,     With my senses settling fast and steadying,   But my body caught up in the whirl and drift     Of the vesture's amplitude, still eddying   On just before me, still to be followed,     As it carried me after with its motion,   --What shall I say?--as a path, were hollowed,     And a man went weltering through the ocean,   Sucked along in the flying wake   Of the luminous water-snake.     XIV    Alone! I am left alone once more--     (Save for the garment's extreme fold     Abandoned still to bless my hold)   Alone, beside the entrance-door   Of a sort of temple,-perhaps a college,   --Like nothing I ever saw before   At home in England, to my knowledge.   The tall old quaint irregular town!     It may be... though which, I can't affirm... any     Of the famous middle-age towns of Germany:   And this flight of stairs where I sit down,   Is it Halle, Weimar, Cassel, Frankfort   Or Gottingen, I have to thank for't?   It may be Gottingen,--most likely.   Through the open door I catch obliquely   Glimpses of a lecture-hall;     And not a bad assembly neither,   Ranged decent and symmetrical     On benches, waiting what's to see there:   Which, holding still by the vesture's hem,   I also resolve to see with them,   Cautious this time how I suffer to slip   The chance of joining in fellowship   With any that call themselves his friends;     As these folk do, I have a notion.     But hist--a buzzing and emotion!   All settle themselves, the while ascends   By the creaking rail to the lecture-desk,     Step by step, deliberate     Because of his cranium's over-freight,   Three parts sublime to one grotesque,   If I have proved an accurate guesser,   The hawk-nosed high-cheek-boned Professor.   I felt at once as if there ran   A shoot of love from my heart to the man--   That sallow virgin-minded studious     Martyr to mild enthusiasm,   As he uttered a kind of cough-preludious     That woke my sympathetic spasm,   (Beside some spitting that made me sorry)   And stood, surveying his auditory   With a wan pure look, well-nigh celestial,--     Those blue eyes had survived so much!     While, under the foot they could not smutch,   Lay all the fleshly and the bestial.   Over he bowed, and arranged his notes,   Till the auditory's clearing of throats   Was done with, died into a silence;     And, when each glance was upward sent,     Each bearded mouth composed intent,   And a pin might be heard drop half a mile hence,--   He pushed back higher his spectacles,   Let the eyes stream out like lamps from cells,   And giving his head of hair--a hake     Of undressed tow, for colour and quantity--   One rapid and impatient shake,     (As our own Young England adjusts a jaunty tie   When about to impart, on mature digestion,   Some thrilling view of the surplice-question)   --The Professor's grave voice, sweet though hoarse,   Broke into his Christmas-Eve discourse.     XV    And he began it by observing     How reason dictated that men   Should rectify the natural swerving,     By a reversion, now and then,   To the well-heads of knowledge, few   And far away, whence rolling grew   The life-stream wide whereat we drink,   Commingled, as we needs must think,   With waters alien to the source;   To do which, aimed this eve's discourse;   Since, where could be a fitter time   For tracing backward to its prime   This Christianity, this lake,   This reservoir, whereat we slake,   From one or other bank, our thirst?   So, he proposed inquiring first   Into the various sources whence     This Myth of Christ is derivable;   Demanding from the evidence,     (Since plainly no such life was livable)   How these phenomena should class?   Whether 'twere best opine Christ was,   Or never was at all, or whether   He was and was not, both together--   It matters little for the name,   So the idea be left the same.   Only, for practical purpose' sake,   'Twas obviously as well to take   The popular story,--understanding     How the ineptitude of the time,   And the penman's prejudice, expanding     Fact into fable fit for the clime,   Had, by slow and sure degrees, translated it     Into this myth, this Individuum,--   Which, when reason had strained and abated it   Of foreign matter, left, for residuum,   A Man!--a right true man, however,   Whose work was worthy a man's endeavour:   Work, that gave warrant almost sufficient     To his disciples, for rather believing   He was just omnipotent and omniscient,     As it gives to us, for as frankly receiving   His word, their tradition,--which, though it meant   Something entirely different   From all that those who only heard it,   In their simplicity thought and averred it,   Had yet a meaning quite as respectable:   For, among other doctrines delectable,   Was he not surely the first to insist on     The natural sovereignty of our race?--     Here the lecturer came to a pausing-place.   And while his cough, like a drouthy piston,   Tried to dislodge the husk that grew to him,   I seized the occasion of bidding adieu to him,   The vesture still within my hand.     XVI    I could interpret its command.   This time he would not bid me enter   The exhausted air-bell of the Critic.   Truth's atmosphere may grow mephitic   When Papist struggles with Dissenter,   Impregnating its pristine clarity,   --One, by his daily fare's vulgarity,     Its gust of broken meat and garlic;   --One, by his soul's too-much presuming   To turn the frankincense's fuming     And vapours of the candle starlike   Into the cloud her wings she buoys on.     Each, that thus sets the pure air seething,     May poison it for healthy breathing--   But the Critic leaves no air to poison;   Pumps out with ruthless ingenuity   Atom by atom, and leaves you--vacuity.   Thus much of Christ does he reject?   And what retain? His intellect?   What is it I must reverence duly?   Poor intellect for worship, truly,   Which tells me simply what was told     (If mere morality, bereft     Of the God in Christ, be all that's left)   Elsewhere by voices manifold;   With this advantage, that the stater     Made nowise the important stumble     Of adding, he, the sage and humble,   Was also one with the Creator.   You urge Christ's followers' simplicity:     But how does shifting blame, evade it?   Have wisdom's words no more felicity?     The stumbling-block, his speech--who laid it?   How comes it that for one found able   To sift the truth of it from fable,   Millions believe it to the letter?   Christ's goodness, then--does that fare better?   Strange goodness, which upon the score     Of being goodness, the mere due   Of man to fellow-man, much more     To God,--should take another view   Of its possessor's privilege,   And bid him rule his race! You pledge   Your fealty to such rule? What, all--   From heavenly John and Attic Paul,   And that brave weather-battered Peter,   Whose stout faith only stood completer   For buffets, sinning to be pardoned,   As, more his hands hauled nets, they hardened,--   All, down to you, the man of men,   Professing here at Gottingen,   Compose Christ's flock! They, you and I,   Are sheep of a good man! And why?   The goodness,--how did he acquire it?   Was it self-gained, did God inspire it?   Choose which; then tell me, on what ground   Should its possessor dare propound   His claim to rise o'er us an inch?     Were goodness all some man's invention,     Who arbitrarily made mention   What we should follow, and whence flinch,--   What qualities might take the style     Of right and wrong,--and had such guessing     Met with as general acquiescing   As graced the alphabet erewhile,   When A got leave an Ox to be,   No Camel (quoth the Jews) like G*,--   *[Footnote: Gimel, the Hebrew G, means camel.]   For thus inventing thing and title   Worship were that man's fit requital.   But if the common conscience must   Be ultimately judge, adjust   Its apt name to each quality   Already known,--I would decree   Worship for such mere demonstration     And simple work of nomenclature,     Only the day I praised, not nature,   But Harvey, for the circulation.   I would praise such a Christ, with pride   And joy, that he, as none beside,   Had taught us how to keep the mind"]]]
