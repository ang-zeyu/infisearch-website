It is caused by decay of tissue from old age and is generally aggravated by repeated brushing. A peculiar feature of the complaint is the lack of veracity on the part of the patient in reference to the cause of his uneasiness. Another invariable symptom is his aversion to outdoor exercise; under various pretexts, which it is the duty of his medical adviser firmly to combat, he will avoid even a gentle walk in the streets.  V. Of the waistcoat science recognizes but one disease--  Porriggia, an affliction caused by repeated spilling of porridge. It is generally harmless, chiefly owing to the mental indifference of the patient. It can be successfully treated by repeated fomentations of benzine.  VI. Mortificatio Tilis, or Greenness of the Hat, is a disease often found in connection with Phosphorescentia (mentioned above), and characterized by the same aversion to outdoor life.  VII. Sterilitas, or Loss of Fur, is another disease of the hat, especially prevalent in winter. It is not accurately known whether this is caused by a falling out of the fur or by a cessation of growth. In all diseases of the hat the mind of the patient is greatly depressed and his countenance stamped with the deepest gloom. He is particularly sensitive in regard to questions as to the previous history of the hat.  Want of space precludes the mention of minor diseases, such as--  VIII. Odditus Soccorum, or oddness of the socks, a thing in itself trifling, but of an alarming nature if met in combination with Contractio Pantalunae. Cases are found where the patient, possibly on the public platform or at a social gathering, is seized with a consciousness of the malady so suddenly as to render medical assistance futile.      SURGICAL CASES  It is impossible to mention more than a few of the most typical cases of diseases of this sort.  I. Explosio, or Loss of Buttons, is the commonest malady demanding surgical treatment. It consists of a succession of minor fractures, possibly internal, which at first excite no alarm. A vague sense of uneasiness is presently felt, which often leads the patient to seek relief in the string habit--a habit which, if unduly indulged in, may assume the proportions of a ruling passion. The use of sealing-wax, while admirable as a temporary remedy for Explosio, should never be allowed to gain a permanent hold upon the system. There is no doubt that a persistent indulgence in the string habit, or the constant use of sealing-wax, will result in--  II. Fractura Suspendorum, or Snapping of the Braces, which amounts to a general collapse of the system. The patient is usually seized with a severe attack of explosio, followed by a sudden sinking feeling and sense of loss. A sound constitution may rally from the shock, but a system undermined by the string habit invariably succumbs.  III. Sectura Pantalunae, or Ripping of the Trousers, is generally caused by sitting upon warm beeswax or leaning against a hook. In the case of the very young it is not unfrequently accompanied by a distressing suppuration of the shirt. This, however, is not remarked in adults. The malady is rather mental than bodily, the mind of the patient being racked by a keen sense of indignity and a feeling of unworthiness. The only treatment is immediate isolation, with a careful stitching of the affected part.  In conclusion, it may be stated that at the first symptom of disease the patient should not hesitate to put himself in the hands of a professional tailor. In so brief a compass as the present article the discussion has of necessity been rather suggestive than exhaustive. Much yet remains to be done, and the subject opens wide to the inquiring eye. The writer will, however, feel amply satisfied if this brief outline may help to direct the attention of medical men to what is yet an unexplored field.     _The Poet Answered_   Dear sir:  In answer to your repeated questions and requests which have appeared for some years past in the columns of the rural press, I beg to submit the following solutions of your chief difficulties:--  Topic I.--You frequently ask, where are the friends of your childhood, and urge that they shall be brought back to you. As far as I am able to learn, those of your friends who are not in jail are still right there in your native village. You point out that they were wont to share your gambols. If so, you are certainly entitled to have theirs now.  Topic II.--You have taken occasion to say:     \"Give me not silk, nor rich attire, Nor gold, nor jewels rare.\"  But, my dear fellow, this is preposterous. Why, these are the very things I had bought for you. If you won't take any of these, I shall have to give you factory cotton and cordwood.  Topic III.--You also ask, \"How fares my love across the sea?\" Intermediate, I presume. She would hardly travel steerage.  Topic IV.--\"Why was I born? Why should I breathe?\" Here I quite agree with you. I don't think you ought to breathe.  Topic V.--You demand that I shall show you the man whose soul is dead and then mark him. I am awfully sorry; the man was around here all day yesterday, and if I had only known I could easily have marked him so that we could pick him out again.  Topic VI.--I notice that you frequently say, \"Oh, for the sky of your native land.\" Oh, for it, by all means, if you wish. But remember that you already owe for a great deal.  Topic VII.--On more than one occasion you wish to be informed, \"What boots it, that you idly dream?\" Nothing boots it at present--a fact, sir, which ought to afford you the highest gratification.     _The Force of Statistics_   They were sitting on a seat of the car, immediately in front of me. I was consequently able to hear all that they were saying. They were evidently strangers who had dropped into a conversation. They both had the air of men who considered themselves profoundly interesting as minds. It was plain that each laboured under the impression that he was a ripe thinker.  One had just been reading a book which lay in his lap.  \"I've been reading some very interesting statistics,\" he was saying to the other thinker.  \"Ah, statistics\" said the other; \"wonderful things, sir, statistics; very fond of them myself.\"  \"I find, for instance,\" the first man went on, \"that a drop of water is filled with little ... with little ... I forget just what you call them ... little--er--things, every cubic inch containing--er--containing ... let me see....\"  \"Say a million,\" said the other thinker, encouragingly.  \"Yes, a million, or possibly a billion ... but at any rate, ever so many of them.\"  \"Is it possible?\" said the other. \"But really, you know there are wonderful things in the world. Now, coal ... take coal....\"  \"Very, good,\" said his friend, \"let us take coal,\" settling back in his seat with the air of an intellect about to feed itself.  \"Do you know that every ton of coal burnt in an engine will drag a train of cars as long as ... I forget the exact length, but say a train of cars of such and such a length, and weighing, say so much ... from ... from ... hum! for the moment the exact distance escapes me ... drag it from....\"  \"From here to the moon,\" suggested the other.  \"Ah, very likely; yes, from here to the moon. Wonderful, isn't it?\"  \"But the most stupendous calculation of all, sir, is in regard to the distance from the earth to the sun. Positively, sir, a cannon-ball--er--fired at the sun....\"  \"Fired at the sun,\" nodded the other, approvingly, as if he had often seen it done.  \"And travelling at the rate of ... of....\"  \"Of three cents a mile,\" hinted the listener.  \"No, no, you misunderstand me,--but travelling at a fearful rate, simply fearful, sir, would take a hundred million--no, a hundred billion--in short would take a scandalously long time in getting there--\"  At this point I could stand no more. I interrupted--\"Provided it were fired from Philadelphia,\" I said, and passed into the smoking-car.     _Men Who have Shaved Me_   A barber is by nature and inclination a sport. He can tell you at what exact hour the ball game of the day is to begin, can foretell its issue without losing a stroke of the razor, and can explain the points of inferiority of all the players, as compared with better men that he has personally seen elsewhere, with the nicety of a professional. He can do all this, and then stuff the customer's mouth with a soap-brush, and leave him while he goes to the other end of the shop to make a side bet with one of the other barbers on the outcome of the Autumn Handicap. In the barber-shops they knew the result of the Jeffries-Johnson prize-fight long before it happened. It is on information of this kind that they make their living. The performance of shaving is only incidental to it. Their real vocation in life is imparting information. To the barber the outside world is made up of customers, who are to be thrown into chairs, strapped, manacled, gagged with soap, and then given such necessary information on the athletic events of the moment as will carry them through the business hours of the day without open disgrace.  As soon as the barber has properly filled up the customer with information of this sort, he rapidly removes his whiskers as a sign that the man is now fit to talk to, and lets him out of the chair.  The public has grown to understand the situation. Every reasonable business man is willing to sit and wait half an hour for a shave which he could give himself in three minutes, because he knows that if he goes down town without understanding exactly why Chicago lost two games straight he will appear an ignoramus.  At times, of course, the barber prefers to test his customer with a question or two. He gets him pinned in the chair, with his head well back, covers the customer's face with soap, and then planting his knee on his chest and holding his hand firmly across the customer's mouth, to prevent all utterance and to force him to swallow the soap,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6340"],["title","Literary Lapses (#7)"],["body"," he asks: \"Well, what did you think of the Detroit-St. Louis game yesterday?\" This is not really meant for a question at all. It is only equivalent to saying: \"Now, you poor fool, I'll bet you don't know anything about the great events of your country at all.\" There is a gurgle in the customer's throat as if he were trying to answer, and his eyes are seen to move sideways, but the barber merely thrusts the soap-brush into each eye, and if any motion still persists, he breathes gin and peppermint over the face, till all sign of life is extinct. Then he talks the game over in detail with the barber at the next chair, each leaning across an inanimate thing extended under steaming towels that was once a man.  To know all these things barbers have to be highly educated. It is true that some of the greatest barbers that have ever lived have begun as uneducated, illiterate men, and by sheer energy and indomitable industry have forced their way to the front. But these are exceptions. To succeed nowadays it is practically necessary to be a college graduate. As the courses at Harvard and Yale have been found too superficial, there are now established regular Barbers' Colleges, where a bright young man can learn as much in three weeks as he would be likely to know after three years at Harvard. The courses at these colleges cover such things as: (1) Physiology, including Hair and its Destruction, The Origin and Growth of Whiskers, Soap in its Relation to Eyesight; (2) Chemistry, including lectures on Florida Water; and How to Make it out of Sardine Oil; (3) Practical Anatomy, including The Scalp and How to Lift it, The Ears and How to Remove them, and, as the Major Course for advanced students, The Veins of the Face and how to open and close them at will by the use of alum.  The education of the customer is, as I have said, the chief part of the barber's vocation. But it must be remembered that the incidental function of removing his whiskers in order to mark him as a well-informed man is also of importance, and demands long practice and great natural aptitude. In the barbers' shops of modern cities shaving has been brought to a high degree of perfection. A good barber is not content to remove the whiskers of his client directly and immediately. He prefers to cook him first. He does this by immersing the head in hot water and covering the victim's face with steaming towels until he has him boiled to a nice pink. From time to time the barber removes the towels and looks at the face to see if it is yet boiled pink enough for his satisfaction. If it is not, he replaces the towels again and jams them down firmly with his hand until the cooking is finished. The final result, however, amply justifies this trouble, and the well-boiled customer only needs the addition of a few vegetables on the side to present an extremely appetizing appearance.  During the process of the shave, it is customary for the barber to apply the particular kind of mental torture known as the third degree. This is done by terrorizing the patient as to the very evident and proximate loss of all his hair and whiskers, which the barber is enabled by his experience to foretell. \"Your hair,\" he says, very sadly and sympathetically, \"is all falling out. Better let me give you a shampoo?\" \"No.\" \"Let me singe your hair to close up the follicles?\" \"No.\" \"Let me plug up the ends of your hair with sealing-wax, it's the only thing that will save it for you?\" \"No.\" \"Let me rub an egg on your scalp?\" \"No.\" \"Let me squirt a lemon on your eyebrows?\" \"No.\"  The barber sees that he is dealing with a man of determination, and he warms to his task. He bends low and whispers into the prostrate ear: \"You've got a good many grey hairs coming in; better let me give you an application of Hairocene, only cost you half a dollar?\" \"No.\" \"Your face,\" he whispers again, with a soft, caressing voice, \"is all covered with wrinkles; better let me rub some of this Rejuvenator into the face.\"  This process is continued until one of two things happens. Either the customer is obdurate, and staggers to his feet at last and gropes his way out of the shop with the knowledge that he is a wrinkled, prematurely senile man, whose wicked life is stamped upon his face, and whose unstopped hair-ends and failing follicles menace him with the certainty of complete baldness within twenty-four hours--or else, as in nearly all instances, he succumbs. In the latter case, immediately on his saying \"yes\" there is a shout of exultation from the barber, a roar of steaming water, and within a moment two barbers have grabbed him by the feet and thrown him under the tap, and, in spite of his struggles, are giving him the Hydro-magnetic treatment. When he emerges from their hands, he steps out of the shop looking as if he had been varnished.  But even the application of the Hydro-magnetic and the Rejuvenator do not by any means exhaust the resources of the up-to-date barber. He prefers to perform on the customer a whole variety of subsidiary services not directly connected with shaving, but carried on during the process of the shave.  In a good, up-to-date shop, while one man is shaving the customer, others black his boots; brush his clothes, darn his socks, point his nails, enamel his teeth, polish his eyes, and alter the shape of any of his joints which they think unsightly. During this operation they often stand seven or eight deep round a customer, fighting for a chance to get at him.  All of these remarks apply to barber-shops in the city, and not to country places. In the country there is only one barber and one customer at a time. The thing assumes the aspect of a straight-out, rough-and-tumble, catch-as-catch-can fight, with a few spectators sitting round the shop to see fair play. In the city they can shave a man without removing any of his clothes. But in the country, where the customer insists on getting the full value for his money, they remove the collar and necktie, the coat and the waistcoat, and, for a really good shave and hair-cut, the customer is stripped to the waist. The barber can then take a rush at him from the other side of the room, and drive the clippers up the full length of the spine, so as to come at the heavier hair on the back of the head with the impact of a lawn-mower driven into long grass.     _Getting the Thread of It_   Have you ever had a man try to explain to you what happened in a book as far as he has read? It is a most instructive thing. Sinclair, the man who shares my rooms with me, made such an attempt the other night. I had come in cold and tired from a walk and found him full of excitement, with a bulky magazine in one hand and a paper-cutter gripped in the other.  \"Say, here's a grand story,\" he burst out as soon as I came in; \"it's great! most fascinating thing I ever read. Wait till I read you some of it. I'll just tell you what has happened up to where I am--you'll easily catch the thread of it--and then we'll finish it together.\"  I wasn't feeling in a very responsive mood, but I saw no way to stop him, so I merely said, \"All right, throw me your thread, I'll catch it.\"  \"Well,\" Sinclair began with great animation, \"this count gets this letter....\"  \"Hold on,\" I interrupted, \"what count gets what letter?\"  \"Oh, the count it's about, you know. He gets this letter from this Porphirio.\"  \"From which Porphirio?\"  \"Why, Porphirio sent the letter, don't you see, he sent it,\" Sinclair exclaimed a little impatiently--\"sent it through Demonio and told him to watch for him with him, and kill him when he got him.\"  \"Oh, see here!\" I broke in, \"who is to meet who, and who is to get stabbed?\"  \"They're going to stab Demonio.\"  \"And who brought the letter?\"  \"Demonio.\"  \"Well, now, Demonio must be a clam! What did he bring it for?\"  \"Oh, but he don't know what's in it, that's just the slick part of it,\" and Sinclair began to snigger to himself at the thought of it. \"You see, this Carlo Carlotti the Condottiere....\"  \"Stop right there,\" I said. \"What's a Condottiere?\"  \"It's a sort of brigand. He, you understand, was in league with this Fra Fraliccolo....\"  A suspicion flashed across my mind. \"Look here,\" I said firmly, \"if the scene of this story is laid in the Highlands, I refuse to listen to it. Call it off.\"  \"No, no,\" Sinclair answered quickly, \"that's all right. It's laid in Italy ... time of Pius the something. He comes in--say, but he's great! so darned crafty. It's him, you know, that persuades this Franciscan....\"  \"Pause,\" I said, \"what Franciscan?\"  \"Fra Fraliccolo, of course,\" Sinclair said snappishly. \"You see, Pio tries to....\"  \"Whoa!\" I said, \"who is Pio?\"  \"Oh, hang it all, Pio is Italian, it's short for Pius. He tries to get Fra Fraliccolo and Carlo Carlotti the Condottiere to steal the document from ... let me see; what was he called?...Oh, yes ... from the Dog of Venice, so that ... or ... no, hang it, you put me out, that's all wrong. It's the other way round. Pio wasn't clever at all; he's a regular darned fool. It's the Dog that's crafty. By Jove, he's fine,\" Sinclair went on; warming up to enthusiasm again, \"he just does anything he wants. He makes this Demonio (Demonio is one of those hirelings, you know, he's the tool of the Dog)...makes him steal the document off Porphirio, and....\"  \"But how does he get him to do that?\" I asked.  \"Oh, the Dog has Demonio pretty well under his thumb, so he makes Demonio scheme round till he gets old Pio--er--gets him under his thumb, and then, of course, Pio thinks that Porphirio--I mean he thinks that he has Porphirio--er--has him under his thumb.\"  \"Half a minute, Sinclair,\" I said, \"who did you say was under the Dog's thumb?\"  \"Demonio.\"  \"Thanks. I was mixed in the thumbs. Go on.\"  \"Well, just when things are like this....\"  \"Like what?\"  \"Like I said.\"  \"All right.\"  \"Who should turn up and thwart the whole scheme, but this Signorina Tarara in her domino....\"  \"Hully Gee!\" I said, \"you make my head ache.
