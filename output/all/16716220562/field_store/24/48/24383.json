One man would have been enough, goodness knows, to do the job in hand, for there were only six or seven pieces of furniture. They got in each other's way a good deal and spat tobacco juice, while poor helpless, inefficient Bill Slade stood by watching them.  From various windows and doors the neighbors watched them too, and some congratulated themselves that their own rents were paid, while others wondered what would become of poor Tom now.  This was the scene which greeted Tom as he came down Barrel Alley from school.  \"Wot are they doin'?\" he asked.  \"Can't you see wot they're a-doin'?\" roared his father. \"'Tain't them that's doin' it neither, it's _you--you done it!!_ It's _you_ took the roof from over my head, you and old John Temple!\" Advancing menacingly, he poured forth a torrent of abuse at his wretched son.  \"The two o' yez done it! You wid yer rocks and him wid his dirty marshals and judges! I'll get the both o' yez yet! Ye sneakin' rat!\"  He would have struck Tom to the ground if Mrs. O'Connor, a mournful figure in shoddy black, had not crossed the street and forced her way between them.  \"'Twas _you_ done it, Bill Slade, and not him, and don't you lay yer hand on him--mind that! 'Twas you an' your whiskey bottle done it, you lazy loafer, an' the street is well rid o' you. Don't you raise your hand agin me, Bill Slade--I'm not afraid o' the likes o' you. I tell you 'twas _you_ sent the poor boy's mother to her grave--you and your whiskey bottle!\"  \"I--I--ain't scared uv him!\" said Tom.  \"You stay right here now and don't be foolish, and me an' you'll go over an' have a cup o' coffee.\"  Just then one of the men emerged bearing in one arm the portrait of the late Mrs. Slade and in the other hand Bill Slade's battered but trusty beer can. The portrait he laid face up on the table and set the can on it.  Perhaps it is expecting too much to assume that a city marshal would have any sense of the fitness of things, but it was an unfortunate moment to make such a mistake. As Mrs. O'Connor lifted the pail a dirty ring remained on the face of the portrait.  \"D'yer see wot yer done?\" shrieked Tom, rushing at the marshal. \"D'yer see wot yer done?\"  There was no stopping him. With a stream of profanity he rushed at the offending marshal, grabbing him by the neck, and the man's head shook and swayed as if it were in the grip of a mad dog.  It was in vain that poor Mrs. O'Connor attempted to intercede, catching hold of the infuriated boy and calling,  \"Oh, Tommy, for the dear Lord's sake, stop and listen to me!\"  Tom did not even hear.  The marshal, his face red and his eyes staring, went down into the mud of Barrel Alley and the savage, merciless pounding of his face could be heard across the way.  While the other marshals pulled Tom off his half-conscious victim, the younger contingent came down the street escorting a sauntering blue-coat, who swung his club leisurely and seemed quite master of the situation.  \"He kilt him, he kilt him!\" called little Sadie McCarren.  Tom, his scraggly hair matted, his face streaming, his chest heaving, and his ragged clothing bespattered, stood hoisting up his suspender, safe in the custody of the other two marshals.  \"Take this here young devil around to the station,\" said one of the men, \"for assault and battery and interferin' with an officer of the law in the performance of his dooty.\"  \"Come along, Tom,\" said the policeman; \"in trouble again, eh?\"  \"Can't yer leave him go just this time?\" pleaded Mrs. O'Connor. \"He ain't himself at all--yer kin see it.\"  \"Take him in,\" said the rising victim, \"for interferin' with an officer of the law in the performance of dooty.\"  \"Where's his folks?\" the policeman asked, not unkindly.  It was then the crowd discovered that Bill Slade had disappeared.  \"I'll have to take you along,\" said the officer.  Tom said never a word. He had played his part in the proceedings, and he was through.  \"Couldn't yer leave him come over jist till I make him a cup o' coffee?\" Mrs. O'Connor begged.  \"They'll give him his dinner at the station, ma'am,\" the policeman answered.  Mrs. O'Connor stood there choking as Tom was led up the street, the full juvenile force of Barrel Alley thronging after him.  \"Wouldn' yer leave me pull my strap up?\" he asked the policeman.  The officer released his arm, taking him by the neck instead, and the last that Mrs. O'Connor saw Tom was hauling his one rebellious strand of suspender up into place.  \"Poor lad, I don't know what'll become uv him now,\" said Mrs. O'Connor, pausing on her doorstep to speak with a neighbor.  \"And them things over there an' night comin' on,\" said her companion. \"I wisht that alarm clock was took away--seems as if 'twas laughin' at the whole thing--like.\"  \"'Tain't only his bein' arrested,\" said Mrs. O'Connor, \"but ther' ain't no hope for him at all, as I kin see. Ther's no one can in_floo_ence him.\"  In Court, the next morning, the judge ruled out all reference to the disfigurement of Mrs. Slade's portrait as being \"incompetent and irrelevant,\" and when the \"assault and battery\" could not be made to seem \"an act done in self-defense and by reason of the imminent peril of the accused,\" Tom was taken to the \"jug\" to spend the balance of the day and to ponder on the discovery that a \"guy\" has no right to \"slam\" a marshal just because he sets a dirty beer can on his mother's picture.  His first enterprise after his liberation was a flank move on Schmitt's Grocery where he stole a couple of apples and a banana, which latter he ate going along the street. These were his only luncheon. The banana skin he threw on the pave-ment.  In a few moments he heard footsteps behind him and, turning, saw a small boy coming along dangling the peel he had dropped. The boy was a jaunty little fellow, wearing a natty spring suit. It was, in fact, \"Pee-wee\" Harris, Tenderfoot, who was just starting out to cover Provision 5 of the Second Class Scout requirements, for he was going to be a Second Class Scout before camping-time, or know the reason why.  \"You drop that?\" he asked pleasantly.  \"Ye-re, you kin have it,\" said Tom cynically.  \"Thanks,\" said Pee-wee, and the banana peel went sailing over the fence into Temple's lot.  \"First thing you know somebody'd get a free ride on that thing,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Ye-re?\" said Tom sneeringly.  \"And if anybody got anything free near John Temple's property----\"  \"Dere's where yer said it, kiddo,\" said Tom, approvingly.  \"So long,\" said Pee-wee, and went gaily on, walking a little, then running a little, then walk-ing again, until Tom thought he must be crazy. Happening just at that minute to finish one of his apples (or rather one of Schmitt's apples) he let fly the core straight for the back of Pee-wee's head.  Then a most extraordinary thing, happened. Without so much as turning round, Pee-wee raised his hand, caught the core, threw it over into the lot, and then, turning, laughed, \"Thanks, good shot!\"  Tom had always supposed that the back of a person's head was a safe target, and he could not comprehend the instinct which was so alert and highly-tuned that it could work entirely independent of the eyes. But this was merely one of Pee-wee's specialties, and his amazing progress from Tenderfoot to Star Scout is a story all by itself.  Tom hoisted himself onto the board fence and attacked the other apple. Just then along came \"Sweet Caporal\" demanding the core.  \"Gimme it 'n' I'll put yer wise ter sup'm.\"  Tom made the speculation.  \"Wop Joe's around de corner wid his pushcart? wot d'ye say we give him de spill?\"  They were presently joined by \"Slats\" Corbett, and the \"Two Aces,\" Jim and Jake Mattenberg, and shortly thereafter Wop Joe's little candystand was carried by assault.  The gum-drops and chocolate bars which did not find their way into the pockets of the storming host, were strewn about the street, the whistle of the peanut-roaster was broken off and Tom went scooting down the street tooting it vigorously.  This affair scattered the gang for the time, and presently Tom and \"Sweet Caporal\" found themselves together. They got an empty bottle from an ash wagon, broke it and distributed the pieces along Broad Street, which they selected as a sort of \"mine area\" for the embarrassment of auto traffic.  Tom then shuffled into the Public Library, ostensibly to read, but in fact to decorate the books according to his own theories of art, and was ejected because he giggled and scuffed his feet and interfered with the readers.  It would not be edifying to follow Tom's shuffling footsteps that afternoon, nor to enumerate the catalogue of unseemly phrase and vicious mischief which filled the balance of the day. He wound up his career of glory by one of the most contemptible things which he had ever done. He went up at dusk and tacked his quarantine sign to the outer gate of the Bennett place.  \"Gee, I hope they're all home,\" he said.  They _were_ all at home and Mrs. Bennett, whom he hated, was busy with preparation and happy anticipations for her unsuspecting son. That the wretched plan did not succeed was due to no preparatory omission on the part of Tom, but because something happened which changed the whole face of things.     CHAPTER IV  CAMP SOLITAIRE    Tom's visit to the Library reminded him that it was here \"them regiment fellers\" met, and since it was near the Bennett place he decided to loiter thereabout, partly for the ineffable pleasure of beholding the side-tracking of Connover's party, and partly in the hope of seeing Mr. Ellsworth again.  So he shuffled around a little before dark and did sentinel duty between the two places. He wanted something to eat very much indeed, and he surmised that such a sympathetic fellow as young Mr. Ellsworth would \"give him the lend of a nickel\" especially if he were tipped off in regard to the coming ball game.  Standing outside, Tom heard the uproarious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6655"],["title","Tom Slade : Boy Scout of the Moving Pictures (#3)"],["body","through the basement windows and wondered what it was all about. Strange that fellows could be enjoying themselves so thoroughly who were not up to some kind of mischief.  Presently, the basement door opened and the scouts began to come out. Tom loitered in the shadow across the way.  The first group paused on the sidewalk bent on finishing their discussion as to whether \"whipping\" was as good as splicing for two strands of rope. One boy insisted that splicing was the only way if you knew how to do it, but that you had to whittle a splicing needle.  \"I wouldn't trust _my_ weight on any double whipping,\" said another fellow. \"The binding wouldn't stand salt water--not unless you tarred it.\"  \"If _my_ little snow-white hand is going to grab that loop, it'll be spliced,\" said the first speaker.  Another boy came out and said _he_ could jump the gap without any rope at all; it was only seven feet, and what was the use of a rope anyway? Then someone said that Pee-wee would do it scout pace, and there was a great laugh. The group went on up the street.  Then out came the renowned Pee-wee himself in hot pursuit of them, running a little, walking a little, according to his habit.  Two more boys came out and one of them said it was going to rain to-morrow. Tom wondered how he knew. Then three or four of the Ravens appeared and one said it would be a great stunt if they could work that on the Silver Foxes at midnight.  Tom didn't know what the Silver Foxes were (he knew there were no foxes in Bridgeboro), and he had no notion what \"that\" meant, but he liked the idea of doing it at midnight. He would like to be mixed up in something which was done at midnight himself.  But his trusty pal, Mr. Ellsworth, did not appear. Whether he was absent that evening, Tom never knew. The last ones to emerge from the Library basement, were a couple of boys who were talking about dots and dashes.  \"You want to make your dot flares shorter,\" one said.  \"Shall I tell you what I'm going to say?\" the other asked.  \"No, sure not, let me dope it out.\"  \"Well, then, get on the job as soon as you reach home.\"  \"All right, then I won't say good-night till later. So long.\"  \"See you to-morrow.\"  How these two expected to say good night without seeing each other Tom could not imagine, but he thought it had something to do with \"dot flares\"; in any event, it was something very mysterious and was to be done that night. He rather liked the idea of it.  The two boys separated, one going up toward Blakeley's Hill and pausing to glance at the quarantine sign on the Bennett house as he passed. Tom was rather surprised that he noticed it since he seemed to be in a hurry, but he followed, resolved to \"slam\" the fellow if he took it down.  Then there came into his head the bright idea that if he followed this boy up the hill to an unfrequented spot he could hold him up for a nickel.  A little way up the hill the boy suddenly turned and stood waiting for him. Tom was hardly less than amazed at this for he had thought that his pursuit was not known. When they came face to face Tom saw that it was none other than the \"half-baked galook\" Roy Blakeley.  He wore the full Scout regalia which fitted him to perfection, and upon his left breast Tom could see a ribbon with something bright depending from it, which seemed to be in the shape of a bird. He had a trim figure and stood very straight, and about his neck was a looselyknotted scarf of a silvery gray color, showing quite an expanse of bare throat. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, and on one wrist he wore a leather band.  \"What are you following me for?\" he asked.  \"Who's follerin' yer?\"  \"You are.\"  \"I ain't follerin' yer neither.\"  \"Yes, you are.\"  \"Yer mean ter tell me I'm lyin'?\" shouted Tom, advancing with a threatening air.  \"Sure.\"  Tom's hulking form was within a few inches' of Blakeley and he thrust forward his lowered head and held his clenched fist conveniently ready at his side, but Roy did not budge. On the contrary, he seemed rather amused. He did not scare worth a cent.  \"Yer want me ter hand ye one?\"  \"No, sure not.\"  \"Well then, was I lyin'?\"  \"Surest thing you know.\"  There was a pause.  \"Gimme a nickel 'n' I'll leave ye off,\" said Tom magnanimously.  The boy laughed and asked, \"What do you want the nickel for?\"  \"Fer a cup o' coffee.\"  Roy paused a minute, biting his lip ruminatively, frankly contemplating him.  \"I can make you a better cup of coffee,\" said he, \"than any lunch wagon juggler in this town. You're halfway up the hill now; come on up the rest of the way--just for a stunt. Ever up on the hill?\"  Tom hesitated.  \"Come on, you're not in a hurry to get home, are you? I'll give you some plum-duff I made and you can have a belt axe to chop it with if you want to. Come on, just for a stunt.\"  \"Who's up dere?\"  \"Just 'Yours sincerely.'\"  \"Yer live in de big house, don'cher?\"  \"Not fer me; guess again. Nay, nay, my boy, _I_ live in Camp Solitaire, with a ring round it. Anybody steps inside that ring gets his wrist slapped and two demerits. I let the house stay there on account of my mother and father and the cat. Don't you worry, you won't get within two hundred feet of the house. The house and I don't speak.\"  Tom, half suspicious but wanting a cup of coffee, shuffled along at Roy's side. The scout's offhand manner and rather whimsical way of talking took the wind out of his belligerence, and he allowed himself so far to soften toward this \"rich guy\" as to say,  \"Me an' our house don't speak neither; we wuz chucked.\"  \"Chucked?\"  \"Ye-re, put out. Old John Temple done it, but I'm hunk all right.\"  \"When was that?\"  \"Couple o' days ago.\"  He told the story of the eviction and his companion listened as they plodded up the hill.  \"Well,\" said Roy, \"I haven't slept indoors for two weeks, and I'm not going to for the next six weeks. And the best way to get hunk on a fellow that puts you out of a house is just to sleep outdoors. They can't put you out of there very well. Camp, and you've got the laugh on them!\"  \"Gee, I thought nobuddy but poor guys slep' outdoors.\"  \"It's the poor guys that sleep _indoors,_\" said Roy.  \"Don' de wind git on ye?\"  \"Sure--gets all over you; it's fine.\"  \"My father give _me_ a raw hand-out, all right, and then some more.\"  \"Well, there's no use fighting your pack.\"  \"Yer what?\"  \"Your pack--as Dan Beard says.\"  \"Who's he--one o' your crowd?\"  \"You bet he is. 'Fighting your pack' is scrapping with your job--with what can't be helped--kind of. See?\"  They walked along in silence, Tom's half-limping sideways gait in strange contrast with his companion's carriage, and soon entered the spacious grounds of the big old-fashioned house which crowned the summit of Blakeley's Hill, one of the show places of the town.  \"Can you jump that hedge?\" said Roy, as he leaped over it. \"This'll be your first sleep outdoors, won't it? If you wake up all of a sudden and hear a kind of growling don't get scared--it's only the trees.\"  Under a spacious elm, a couple of hundred feet from the house, was a little tent with a flag-pole near it.  \"That's where Old Glory hangs out, but she goes to bed at sunset. That's what gives her such rosy cheeks. We'll hoist her up and give her the salute in the morning.\"  Near the tent was a small fire place of stones, with a rough bench by it and a chair fashioned from a grocery box. Before the entrance stood two poles and on a rough board across these were painted the words, CAMP SOLITAIRE, as Tom saw by the light of the lantern which Roy held up for a moment.  The tent was furnished with a cot, blankets, mosquito-netting, several books on a little shelf, and magazines strewn about with BOYS' LIFE on their covers. On the central upright was a little shelf with a reflector for the lantern, and close to the pole a rickety steamer chair with a cushion or two. The place looked very inviting.  \"Now this out here,\" said Roy, \"is my signal pedestal. You know Westy Martin, don't you? He's patrol leader, and he and I are trying out the Morse code; you'll see me hand him one to-night. We're trying it by searchlight first, then, later we'll get down to the real fire works. He lives out on the Hillside Road a little way.\"  The signal pedestal was a little tower with a platform on top reached by a ladder.  \"Doesn't need to be very high, you see, because you can throw a searchlight way up, but we use it daytimes for flag work. Here's the searchlight,\" Roy added, unwrapping it from a piece of canvas. \"Belongs on the touring car, but I use it. I let my father use it on the car sometimes--if he's good.  \"Now for the coffee. Sit right down on that parlor chair, but don't lean too far back. Like it strong? No? Right you are. Wait a minute, the lantern's smoking. Never thought what you were up against to-night, did you? You're kidnapped and don't know it. By the time we're through the eats Westy'll be home and we'll say good-night to him.  \"Can you beat that valley for signalling? Westy's nearly as high up as we are. Now for the fire and then the plum-duff. Don't be afraid of it-you can only die once. Wish I had some raisin pudding, but my mother turned me down on raisins to-day.\"  He sat down on the ground near Tom, scaled his hat into the tent, drew his knees up, and breathed a long, exaggerated sigh of fatigue after his few minutes' exertion.  \"Let's see, what was I going to ask you? Oh, yes; how'd you get hunk on John Temple?\"  \"Put a quarantine sign on Sissy Bennett's house.\"  \"What?\"  \"Sure; didn't yer see it?\"  \"What for?\"  \"He's a rich guy, ain't he?\"  Roy looked at him, puzzled.  \"Dere's a gang comin' over from Hillside ter s'prise him to-night.\"  \"In a car?\"  \"Ye-re. An' I put de sign up fer ter sidetrack 'em.\"  \"You did?\"  In the glare of the glowing fire Roy looked straight at Tom. \"How will that--what good--\" he began; then paused and continued to look curiously at him with the same concentrated gaze with which he would have studied a trail"]]]
