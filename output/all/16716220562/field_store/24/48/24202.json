Now you better go out and forget it all, and busy yourself about something.\"  \"I've got to practice,\" said Polly with a yawn, and stretching her arms. \"I haven't done a bit this whole afternoon, and Monsieur comes tomorrow.\"  \"Best fly at it, then,\" said Mrs. Fisher, smiling at her. So Polly, with a parting glance at the figure on the little bed, went downstairs and into the big drawing-room, wishing that Phronsie was there, as usual, where she dearly loved to stay, tucked up in a big damask-covered chair, one of her dolls in her arms, waiting patiently till the practice hour should be over.  But when Phronsie at last turned over, and said without a bit of warning, \"I want something to eat, I do.\" with an extremely injured expression, Mother Fisher was so thankful that she had no time to question her, if, indeed, she had considered it wise to do so. And Sarah was called, and laughed with delight at the summons, and ran off to get the tray ready, Phronsie watching her with hungry eyes in which the dew of sleep still lingered. But old Mr. King was not so patient.  When he saw, as he soon did, his visits to the side of the little bed being as frequent as Polly's own, that Phronsie was really awake and sitting up, he could keep still no longer, but putting his arms around her, fumed out:  \"Oh, that careless Joanna! Poor lamb! There, there! Grandpapa will take care of his little girl himself, after this.\"  \"I'm hungry,\" announced Phronsie, looking up into his face. \"Indeed I am, Grandpapa dear, very hungry.\"  \"Oh, to think of it! Yes, Pet\"--soothing her. \"Where is that Sarah? Can't some one get this poor child a bit to eat?\" he cried irascibly.  \"Sarah will hurry just as fast as she can,\" said Mrs. Fisher, coming up with a dainty white gown over her arm. \"Phronsie must be a good girl and wait patiently.\"  Phronsie wriggled her toes under the bedclothes.  \"I wish you'd take me, Grandpapa dear,\" she said, holding up her arms.  \"So I will--so I will, Pet!\" cried old Mr. King, very much delighted; and lifting her up to rest her head on his shoulder, he walked up and down the room. \"There, there, dear! Oh, why doesn't that Sarah hurry!\"--when in walked that individual with a big tray, and on it everything that a hungry child could be supposed to desire. But Phronsie had no eyes for anything but the glass of milk.  \"Oh, Grandpapa,\" she piped out at sight of it, \"Sarah's got me some milk,\" and she gave a happy little crow.  \"So she has,\" he laughed as gayly, \"Well, now, we'll sit right down here and have some of these good things,\" and, Mrs. Fisher drawing up a big easy chair in front of the table where Sarah deposited the tray, he sat down, with Phronsie on his knee. \"Now, child----\"  \"Oh, Grandpapa, may I have the milk?\" she begged, holding out a trembling hand.  \"Bless you, yes, child.\" He put the glass into her hand. \"Take care, Phronsie, don't drink so fast.\"  \"Honey will choke herself,\" cried Sarah, in alarm, holding up warning black fingers. \"Oh, my! she's done drunk it mos' all up a'ready.\"  \"There, there, Phronsie!\" Grandpapa took hold of the glass.  \"Phronsie,\" said Mother Fisher, and it was her hand that took the glass away from the eager lips. \"You must eat a roll now, or a little bit of toast.\"  \"But I want some more milk,\" said Phronsie, and her lips quivered.  \"Not yet, Phronsie.\" Mother Fisher was cutting up the toast, and now held up a morsel on the spoon. \"See how very nice it is.\"  \"We'll play it is five-o'clock tea,\" said old Mr. King, at his wit's end to bring the smiles into her face. Phronsie turned and gave him one look, then buried her face in his waistcoat and cried as hard as she could.  \"There, there!\" The old gentleman got up to his feet and began to pace the floor again, his white hair bent over her face, his hand patting her back gently. \"Don't cry, poor little lamb.\" And as a sudden thought struck him, \"Just look at your mother, Phronsie; you are making her sick.\"  Up popped Phronsie's yellow head, the tears trailing off from the round cheeks till they fell on the floor. There stood Mother Fisher, quite still.  \"I'm sorry, Mamsie,\" said Phronsie, and she put out a little hand, \"I'll eat the toast.\" So down old Mr. King sat again, with her on his lap, and Mother Fisher cut up more toast, and Phronsie opened her mouth obediently, and after the first mouthful she smiled: \"I like it, I do.\" And Mother Fisher smiled too, and said, \"I knew you would, Phronsie.\" And Grandpapa laughed, he was so happy, and Sarah kept crying, \"Bress de Lawd! yer maw knew best.\" And pretty soon Mrs. Fisher nodded to old Mr. King, and he said, \"Now for the rest of the milk, Phronsie,\" and the glass was put into her happy hand.  And then more toast, and more laughing, for Grandpapa by that time told a funny story, and everything got so very merry that the gayety brought all the rest of the houseful of children up to see if Phronsie were really awake.  \"Why didn't you tell us before?\" cried Joel, in a dudgeon, revolving around the table. \"She's been eating ever so long, and we thought she was asleep.\"  \"That's the reason she's had a little peace,\" retorted the old gentleman.  \"Catch them telling you, Joe!\" said Percy Whitney, glad to pitch in with a word.  \"Well, you didn't know it, either,\" said Joel, in great satisfaction. \"Say, Phronsie, where were you all this morning?\"  \"Ugh!\" cried Van, with a warning dig in his ribs.  \"Let me alone,\" cried Joel, squaring around on him savagely.  \"Look at Phronsie's face,\" said Percy, with a superior manner, as if no one needed to tell him when to speak.  Polly was on her knees cuddling up Phronsie's toes, and begging to feed her, when she felt her give a shiver, and try to hide her face on her neck.  \"Don't, Joey,\" begged Polly. But Joel, not hearing her, and hating to be dictated to by Percy, cried out persistently:  \"Say, Phron, what were you doing all the morning?\"  Phronsie at this gave a loud sob. \"Take me, Polly,\" was all she said. So Polly sat down on the floor, and Phronsie snuggled up closer into her neck, and was rocked back and forth to her heart's content, while Joel, perfectly aghast at the mischief he had done, was taken in tow by Mother Fisher, to sob out, his head in her lap, that he \"didn't mean to, he didn't mean to.\"  \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed old Mr. King, in dismay, \"this is a pretty state of things! Polly, my child\"--he leaned over her--\"can't you think up something to get us out of it?\"  \"I'm going to talk about the garden party,\" cried Polly, an inspiration seizing her. \"Oh, Phronsie, now you must sit up; you can't think what plans we have for it.\" But Phronsie burrowed deeper in her nest.  \"If you don't sit up, Phronsie,\" said Polly quite decidedly, \"I shall have to put you off from my lap, and go out of the room.\"  \"Oh, no, no, Polly!\" cried Phronsie, clutching her around the neck.  \"Yes, I shall, Phronsie,\" declared Polly, in her most decided fashion, \"so you must sit right up, and hear all about it. Now, Jasper, you begin.\"  So Phronsie sat up and let Polly wipe her face; and then she folded her hands in her lap, while Jasper began:  \"You see that we thought that we'd take the Wistaria arbor, Father, if you'd let us, for our post office. May we?\"  \"Yes, yes, certainly,\" said the old gentleman, who would have been quite willing to promise anything just then.  \"Oh, that's no end jolly!\" cried Jasper, throwing back his dark hair from his forehead with a quick thrust. \"Now we can do splendidly. Polly, only think!\" His eyes shone, and Polly screamed out, \"Oh, Grandpapa, how lovely!\" and the others joined in, not quite knowing what they were so happy about, until Joel popped up his head from his mother's lap to hear what all the noise was about over there.  \"I'm going to be postmaster,\" he announced, wiping the tears off with the back of his hand, and plunging across the room.  \"No, sir-ee!\" declared Ben, seizing his jacket-end, \"don't think it, Joe. Jasper is going to fill that important office.\"  \"Yes, Jasper is,\" shouted Percy and Van together, delighted at anything that could keep Joel out. Davie stood perfectly still in the midst of the uproar.  \"Why couldn't Joey be a letter carrier, to help give out the letters?\" he said at last, in the midst of the noise. \"Couldn't he, Ben?\" and he ran to twitch that individual's sleeve.  \"Hey--what?\"  \"Couldn't he be the one to give out some of the letters, and help Jasper?\" asked David anxiously.  \"I don't know--yes, maybe\"--as he saw David's face fall. \"You best ask Jasper, he's to be the postmaster.\"  So David ran over and precipitated himself into the middle of the group, with his question; when immediately the rest began to clamor to help Jasper give out the letters, so the babel was worse than at first.  Phronsie by this time was begging with the others, while she sat straight in Polly's lap, with very red cheeks and wide eyes. Now she slipped out, and rushed up to Jasper.  \"And I, too, Japser; I want to give out letters, too,\" she cried, dreadfully excited.  \"So you shall, Pet,\" he cried, seizing her to toss her up in the air, the others all circling around them, Phronsie's happy little crows going up high above the general din.  \"Well, I think if we are going to have such a fine post office, we'll have to work pretty hard to write the letters,\" said Polly, after they had sobered down a bit.  \"Ugh!\" cried Joel with a grimace, \"I'm not going to write a single scrap of one.\"  \"Indeed you are,\" retorted Polly; \"everybody has absolutely got to write some letters. Why, we must have a bushel of them.\"  \"Oh, Polly Pepper!\" cried the others, \"a bushel of letters!\"  \"And no one can have a letter who doesn't write some,\" announced Polly firmly--\"the very idea! So we must all work like everything to get ready for the post office.\"     III  CLEM FORSYTHE"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6418"],["title","Five Little Peppers and their Friends (#4)"],["body","sat on the stairs, halfway down the long flight. It was the same staircase on which Jasper had found her, with Polly waiting patiently on the lower step, when she first came to Grandpapa King's. Now she held Clorinda in her arms, tightly pressed to her bosom.  \"I do wish,\" she said softly, \"that I could see my poor little girl, I do.\"  Clorinda not replying, Phronsie smoothed down the pink gown.  \"It wasn't very nice at that little girl's house\"--and a troubled expression swept over her face--\"but the little girl was nice, and she hadn't any child.\"  Clorinda's countenance expressed no sorrow, but stared up at her mother unblinkingly. Phronsie bent over and dropped a kiss on the red lips.  \"Maybe she'll come again some day, if I watch by the big gate.\"  \"My goodness me!\" Polly, running along the upper hall, peered over the railing. \"What are you doing, Phronsie, sitting down in the middle of the stairs?\"  \"I'm thinking,\" said Phronsie, looking up.  \"Well, I should say!\" cried Polly, running down to sit beside her. \"Oh, Pet, I've an invite for you.\" She seized Phronsie's hand and cuddled it in both of her own. \"It's perfectly splendid.\"  \"What's an 'invite'?\" asked Phronsie, coming slowly out of her thoughts, to peer into Polly's face.  \"Oh, I forgot, Mamsie didn't want me to say that,\" said Polly, with a little blush. \"Well, it's an invitation, Pet, and to Miss Mary Taylor's, to go with us girls this afternoon to work on our fancy things for the fair. Only think of that, Phronsie Pepper!\" And Polly threw her arms around the small figure, and hugged her, to the imminent danger of both falling down the rest of the flight.  \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, \"we almost went over.\"  \"Can I really go, Polly?\" cried Phronsie, as soon as she could get her breath, \"when you all take your bags and work on things?\" She set Clorinda carefully down on the stair above, and stood up to look into Polly's face.  \"Yes, child. Take care, you'll tumble over backward,\" warned Polly, with a restraining hand. \"And oh, Phronsie! I'm going to make you a little silk bag, and you can take your pin-cushion to work on.\"  This was such a height of bliss that it quite overcame Phronsie, and she sat down on her stair again to think it over. To have a little silk bag to hang on her arm to carry her work in, just as Polly and the other girls did when they went to each other's houses with their fancy work, was more than she ever imagined was coming to her till she got as big as they were. And to put her \"cushion-pin\" in it, and go to Miss Mary Taylor's with them all, sent her into such a dream of delight that she sat quite still, her hands in her lap.  \"Don't you like it, Pet?\" cried Polly, disappointed at her silence.  Phronsie drew a long breath, then stood up and began to hop up and down on her stair.  \"Oh, Polly,\" she cried, clapping her hands, \"I'm going to have a little silk bag, I truly am, Polly, all my own--oh!\"  \"My goodness me, Phronsie!\" cried Polly, seizing her arms, \"you'll roll down and break your neck, most likely.\"  \"And I'll take my cushion-pin\"--Phronsie leaned over and put her face close to Polly's cheek--\"and I'll sew on it for the poor children, I will,\" and she began to hop up and down again.  \"Take care, and stop dancing,\" laughed Polly.  \"And it shall be a pink bag,\" said Phronsie, dreadfully excited; \"make it a pink bag, do, Polly.\"  \"Oh, I don't know that I can do that,\" said Polly slowly, \"because you know I took my piece of pink ribbon Auntie gave me, for that sachet case I'm making for the fair. But never mind, child\"--as she saw a sorry little droop to Phronsie's mouth--\"I'll find another somewhere, and it will be nice, even if it isn't pink.\"  \"It will be nice,\" echoed Phronsie confidently, as long as Polly said so, and she clasped her hands.  \"And come on, Pet, we'll go and find the ribbon and make the bag now, so as to be all ready.\" Polly flew up from her stair. \"Pick up your doll, and give me your hand. Here we are!\"--as they ran up to the top.  \"I very much wish you wouldn't call her my doll,\" panted Phronsie, as they reached the last step; \"she's my child, Polly.\"  \"I know; I won't forget,\" laughed Polly. \"Now, says I, Phronsie, for my piece-box!\"  The invitation of Miss Mary Taylor to all the girls who were getting up the fair for the poor children's week, plunged them into such a state of excitement that those who had been lagging over their fancy work now spirited up on it, or ran down-street to get more materials and begin anew. One of these was Clem Forsythe.  \"Oh, dear me!\" cried Polly, looking up from the floor of her room, where Phronsie and she had thrown themselves, the piece-box of ribbons between them, \"here comes Clem up the drive; now I 'most know she wants me to help her on that sofa-pillow,\" and she twitched a square of yellow silk into a tighter tangle. \"How in the world did that spool get in here?\" she exclaimed, in vexation.  \"I'll get it out, let me,\" begged Phronsie, dropping a fascinating bunch of gay ribbons she was sorting in the hope of finding a pink one.  \"Oh, you can't, child,\" cried Polly, her impatient fingers making sad work of the snarl. \"There, I'll break the old thing, there's no other way\"--as Clem ran over the stairs and into the room.  \"Oh, I'm so glad to find you!\" panted Clem. \"Dear me! what _are_ you doing?\" And not waiting for an answer, she plunged on: \"I stopped at Alexia's--thought you might be there. And she's just as mad as can be because I was coming over here for you. You see, her aunt has something for her to do this morning. I'm tickled to death that for once I got ahead of her. Whew! I'm so hot! I ran every step of the way.\" She threw herself down on the floor beside the two. \"My, what a sight of ribbons, Polly Pepper!\"  \"I'm going to have a silk bag, Clem,\" confided Phronsie, dropping the little bunch of ribbons in her lap, to lean over to look into the tall girl's face, \"and I'm going to take my cushion-pin in it.\"  \"Are you, really?\" said Clem. \"Oh, Polly, you see, I want you to----\"  \"Yes, I am.\" Phronsie nodded her yellow head. \"Polly is going to make it right now, she is.\"  \"Is she? Oh, dear!\" Clem gave a groan. \"Oh, Polly, I did want you to----\"  \"You see, I promised her this,\" Polly was guilty of interrupting. \"She's been invited to Miss Mary's this afternoon with us girls, and she wants a silk bag to carry her work in, too, the same as we big girls have, don't you, Pet?\" Polly stopped long enough in the final tussle with the snarl to set a kiss on Phronsie's round cheek.  \"Yes, I do, Polly,\" laughed Phronsie, with a wriggle of delight, \"and I'm going to carry my cushion-pin in it, I am.\"  \"So you see I can't help you on your sofa-pillow, Clem,\" said Polly hurriedly, feeling dreadfully ashamed to have to say no.  \"Oh, I don't want any help on it,\" said Clem; \"I finished that old thing, Polly.\"  \"Finished your sofa-pillow, Clem!\" Polly dropped her snarl in her lap. \"Why, how could you?--and you hadn't the dog worked, except one leg, and none of the filling in.\"  \"Oh, I don't mean I finished it in that way,\" said Clem carelessly. \"I mean I'm done with it forever. I just hate that old dog, Polly, and so I gave the whole thing to our second girl, and she's going to work it for Christmas and send it to her mother.\"  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, \"and now you won't give anything to the fair,\" and her mouth drooped sorrowfully.  \"Oh, yes, I will, too,\" declared Clem cheerfully; \"I'll give something ten times better than that old dog sitting up on a cushion. And nobody would have bought it when it was done, except my mother--I'd made her--so what's the use of finishing it? Anyway, I've given it to Bridget; and now I'm going to make the most elegant thing--you can't guess, Polly Pepper.\"  \"What is it?\" cried Polly, with sparkling eyes.  \"Oh, that's telling,\" said Clem, in a tantalizing way. \"You must guess.\"  \"Polly,\" said Phronsie, with a gentle little twitch on her arm, \"can you find any pink ribbon?\"  \"Yes, yes; I mean no, not yet,\" said Polly, in a preoccupied way, her eyes on Clem's face. \"Oh, I can't guess; it might be anything, you know, Clem.\"  \"But it isn't; I mean it's something,\" declared Clem, in great triumph. \"Oh, do hurry, you're so slow, Polly; it's too elegant for anything!\"  Polly leaned her face in her hands, and her elbows on her knees. \"Mm, mm--oh, I know!\" She brought up suddenly, nearly overthrowing Phronsie, who had bent anxiously over her. \"Take care, Pet, I came near bumping your nose. It's a workbag.\"  \"A workbag!\" exclaimed Clem, in great scorn. \"Well, I guess not, Polly Pepper. What I'm going to make is ever so much better than an old workbag. Guess again.\"  At the mention of the workbag, Phronsie had gently pulled Polly's arm. But Polly was too deep in thought to notice, and she wrinkled her brows, and bent her head again in her hands. What could it possibly be that Clem was to make?  \"Well, I think it is a sachet bag, then,\" she said at last.  \"An old sachet bag, when all the girls are making oceans of 'em! I should think you'd be perfectly ashamed, Polly Pepper, to sit there and guess such things. I'm going to make a most beautiful, embroidered handkerchief case, with little violets all----\"  \"Why, you can't, Clem Forsythe!\" Polly flew to her feet, sending the ribbon box flying, and nearly oversetting Phronsie. \"You ought not to do any such thing,\" she ran on passionately, a little red spot coming on either cheek, \"when you know it'll be just like mine. It would be too mean for anything.\"  \"It won't be just like it,\" said Clem, twisting uncomfortably, and not looking up into Polly's face, \"for mine is to be a wreath, and yours is a bunch.\"  \"But it'll be the same thing,\" cried Polly, too angry to think what she was saying, \"and you're perfectly mean and hateful to copy mine.\"  \"Polly,\" cried Phronsie, in a distressed little voice. She had gotten up to her feet, and now hurried over to hold Polly's gown. \"Oh, don't, Polly,"]]]
