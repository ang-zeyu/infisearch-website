Yet did this man prove victor for he had a wondrous hold which none of the others knew. And when he had won, so turned he to watch and join in the archery. And as he watched came there knaves to him and mocked him.  \"Faith though you wrestle well,\" one spoke, \"it doth not make you an archer. For here you find true archery than which none can do better.\"  \"And I carry a club I would fain try on your thick skull,\" said another who was even less gentle spoken.  \"Of a good time, my friend, and you may,\" replied the lone knave.  \"No such time befits the same as now,\" replied the first knave.  \"If they will wait for my trial with bow and arrow I would be the last to keep you waiting.\" So spoke the stranger.  So then one of the knaves hurried away and received permission.  \"Then furnish me a club,\" said the stranger.  \"Here then is mine,\" offered the third knave.  Yet, forsooth, the club was but a sorry one and so the unknown would not use it.  \"Then show you a coward's heart,\" replied he who would strive with him. And then the three rushed upon the stranger and would do him hurt.  So now came bearing down on the three none other than Allan who had overheard the parley.  \"For shame, knaves. No true men would treat stranger so. He asks nothing more than is fair. Give him a club of his choosing.\"  \"Of a faith, young master, this quarrel is none of yours, and warrants no interference. Leave this fellow to us, and we shall give him clubbing of his choosing.\" And the man who addressed the boy, though he looked not straight at him, growled surlily.  \"I shall give you a thrashing, fool, unless you do my bidding,\" replied the boy, hotly.  But the three surly brutes moved uneasily. And then came Sir Percival forward.  \"What have we here?\" he asked.  So Allan waited for the men to say. But they, now frightened, made no spoken word.  \"These knaves would play foul tricks on this strange fellow. This one, would strive with him and yet would not offer other club than this. And when the stranger asked to have one of his choice they called him coward and would beat him.\"  \"And I doubt not, fools, this club you offer will not stand one blow.\" So Sir Percival brought it down on the first knave's head, and, lo, though the blow was not a hard one, yet did the club break in two.  \"So methought. Now go you Allan and get club that will do. And then will you, stranger, give this villain a sound trouncing.\" And Sir Percival stayed so that the troublemakers did not depart.  So Allan brought a club which suited the stranger.  Now did the two battle long and well. Both the stranger and he who fought with him were of great strength and each was exceeding quick.  As wood struck wood and each tried to get full blow upon the other, so turned all eyes upon the two. And except for glancing blows neither could bring the other down. And though the sparks flew, yet each held his club and was hardly hurt. So now they rested for a few moments.  And while they waited, the stranger turned to Allan and spoke.  \"I thank you for your brave upstanding of me, young master. And I hope some day I may serve you equally well.\"  \"You are a worthy man. Serve me now by trouncing the knave who battles with you.\"  \"I can but try, yet right skillful is the fellow.\"  So they turned to again. Yet this time the stranger fought the better. Soon the other was forced back, foot by foot. And even as the stranger seemed to have all the best of it, his foot seeming slipped, and he went to his knees.  Fiercely the other came upon him. Yet as he came closer the stranger's club moved swiftly. From out the seeming victor's hand flew his mighty club and next second found him clubbed to the ground, senseless.  Now the stranger sat himself down for he needed rest sorely. But only for a little while and thereafter he turned to try his skill with bow and arrow. And though he had shown skill in all of the other feats he proved his mastery here. For he was wondrous expert in his archery.  \"Here you, is fair target,\" he finally suggested after many trials. And went to distant tree and removed from bough upon it, all its leaves but one.  \"Shoot you all at this. And if you bring it down I will call you skillful.\"  But only one would try for it. And he came close but missed.  Now did the stranger raise his own bow. Nor did he seem to take aim but let the arrow fly. And the arrow carried the twig and leaf with it to the ground.  \"Of a truth,\" said King Arthur, \"a right worthy knave is that and I would speak to him.\"  So they brought the stranger before the king.  \"Thou hast done exceeding well, this day, fellow. Tell us then the banner that you serve.\"  \"That I cannot do. For, sire, such are my master's commands. Yet may I say no knight is more true and worthy.\"  \"Then must we wait for your master's coming. Go thou hence and tell your master he can be proud of thee. And take you this bag of gold besides such other prizes as are yours.\" So as the knave stood there, the King turned to Sir Dagonet, his jester, who was making himself heard.  \"A fool speaks, sire. Yet claim I, like master like man. So then must this fellow's master be right skillful to hold him. And since this master is not you, nor Sir Launcelot, then I pick him to be Sir Tristram.\"  \"Fool's reasoning, yet hath it much sense,\" said the King.  Now the stranger left. But ere departing, he turned to Allan.  \"I trust, young master, I shall see you again. As to who I am, know you for your own keeping--fools ofttimes reason best of all.\"  The yeoman rode far into the forest. Then when he came to a lone habitation he dismounted. A knight seated near the small window at the further wall greeted him as he entered.  \"How did the day turn out? No doubt they trounced you well.\"  \"No, master, no trouncing did I get. Instead, the good King spoke pleasantly unto me, gave me this bag of gold, and commended me to my master. Furthermore, see you these prizes that are mine?\"  \"Aye,\" the yeoman continued, not a bit grieved at the knight's banter, \"I even heard the King's fool remark that since the man was so good, the master need must be. And then and there he hazarded a shrewd guess that if this master were not the King, nor Sir Launcelot, then it must need be you.\"  \"Then truly am I in good company. Now then tell me what news is there of tomorrow?\"  \"The King of Northgalis desires your aid. That I heard him say. Sir Launcelot is to joust for Cadoris as is Sir Palomides, and these two, of a truth, make it one-sided.\"  \"Worthy Gouvernail, prove again my faith in you. Procure for me a shield, one that holds no insignia, so that I may enter the lists unbeknownst to any. I would not have them know I am Tristram, so that it may be my good fortune to joust with many knights who know me not.\"  \"That, good master, is not hard. I know a place where I can obtain a black shield, one that holds no other remembrance upon it. It should serve your purpose well.\"  \"By my faith, did ever better knave serve master? Right proud of you am I, Gouvernail. And would that I too had bags of gold I could give you for your loyal service.\"  \"Nay, master, such service as I give I measure not by aught that you can pay.\"  \"That do I know full well, else had you left me long since, for little have I paid,\" Sir Tristram answered, soft spoken and with great affection.     CHAPTER EIGHT  Sir Tristram's Prowess   So the next day Sir Tristram, carrying the black shield, went forth to enter the lists. And none knew him. The great conflict had already begun when he arrived. He found himself a place among those knights who jousted for Northgalis. And very soon all perceived that this knight with the black shield was skillful and strong. Well and lustily did he battle and none could withstand him. Yet did he not meet with Sir Launcelot nor with Sir Palomides, on this first day. Nor did any know him, but all marveled at his worth and bravery.  So, as the day was done, this Unknown and his servant, Gouvernail, rode back into the forest. And none followed him for he was a brave knight and all respected him and his desire to stay unknown. Yet did the judges declare the side of Northgalis victor and as for single knight, the most worthy was the Unknown. And he was called \"the Knight of the Black Shield.\"  Now as the judges' duties were done, King Arthur showed how wroth he was that strange knight had carried off such great honors.  \"Yet do we hope tomorrow shall show other reckoning than this. For good Launcelot shall be there and so shall we.\"  On the morn the heralds called forth the brave knights once again. And with the call came the \"Knight of the Black Shield.\"  Sir Palomides was await for him, eager and alert, to be the first to joust. And so they, like great hounds, went at each other. And truly, Sir Tristram found his foe a worthy one. Long did they joust without either besting the other until he of the black shield by great skill and fine force brought down a mighty blow and did smite Sir Palomides over his horse's croup. But now as the knight fell King Arthur was there and he rode straight at the unknown knight shouting, \"Make thee ready for me!\" Then the brave sovereign, with eager heart, rode straight at him and as he came, his horse reared high. And such was the King's strength he unhorsed Sir Tristram.  Now, while the latter was on foot, rode full tilt upon him, Sir Palomides, and would have borne him down but that Sir Tristram was aware of his coming, and so lightly stepping aside, he grasped the arm of the rider and pulled him from his horse. The two dashed against each other on foot and with their swords battled so well that kings and queens and knights and their ladies stood and beheld them. But finally the Unknown smote his foe three mighty blows so that he fell upon the earth groveling. Then did they all truly wonder at his skill for Sir Palomides was thought by many"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6582"],["title","In the Court of King Arthur (#5)"],["body","be the most skillful knight in Britain.  A knight now brought horse for Sir Tristram, for now, all knew that it must be he. So too was horse brought for Sir Palomides. Great was the latter's ire and he came at Sir Tristram again. Full force, he bore his lance at the other. And so anew they fought. Yet Sir Tristram was the better of the two and soon with great strength he got Sir Palomides by the neck with both hands and so pulled him clean out of his saddle. Then in the presence of them all, and well they marveled at his deed, he rode ten paces carrying the other in this manner and let him fall as he might.  Sir Tristram turned now again and saw King Arthur with naked sword ready for him. The former halted not, but rode straight at the King with his lance. But as he came, the King by wondrous blow sent his weapon flying and for a moment Sir Tristram was stunned. And as he sat there upon his horse the King rained blows upon him and yet did the latter draw forth his sword and assail the King so hard that he need must give ground. Then were these two divided by the great throng. But Sir Tristram, lion hearted, rode here and there and battled with all who would. And of the knights who opposed him he was victor of eleven. And all present marveled at him, at his strength and at his great deeds.  Yet had he not met Sir Launcelot, who elsewhere was meeting with all who would strive with him. Not many, however, would joust with him for he was known as the very bravest and most skillful. So as he sat there all at ease, there came the great acclaim for the Knight of the Black Shield. Nor did Sir Launcelot know him to be Sir Tristram. But he got his great lance and rushed toward the cry. When he saw this strange knight he called to him, \"Knight of the Black Shield, prepare for me.\"  And then came such jousting as had never been seen. For each knight bowed low his head and came at the other like the wind. When they met it was very like thunder. Flashed lance on shields and armor so that sparks flew. And each would not give to the other one step but by great skill with shield did avoid the best of each other's blows.  Then did Sir Tristram's lance break in two, and Sir Launcelot, through further ill fortune, wounded Sir Tristram in his left side. But notwithstanding, the wounded knight brought forth his sword and rushed daringly at the other with a force that Sir Launcelot could not withstand, and gave him a fearful blow. Low in his saddle sagged Sir Launcelot, exceeding weak for many moments. Now Sir Tristram left him so and rode into the forest. And after him followed Gouvernail, his servant.  Sore wounded was Sir Tristram yet made he light of it. Sir Launcelot on his part recovered soon and turned back to the tourney, and thereafter did wondrous deeds and stood off many knights, together and singly.  Now again was the day done and the tournament, too. And to Sir Launcelot was given full honor as victor of the field. But naught would Sir Launcelot have of this. He rode forthwith to his King.  \"Sire, it is not I but this knight with the Black Shield who has shown most marvelous skill of all. And so I will not have these prizes for they do not belong to me.\"  \"Well spoken, Sir Launcelot and like thy true self,\" replied the King. \"So since this knight is gone, will you go forth with us within the fortnight in search for him. And unless we are in great error we shall find this Knight of the Black Shield no more, no less, than Sir Tristram.\"     CHAPTER NINE  The Kitchen Boy   Among all those who came to the court of King Arthur at this Pentecost seeking hospitality, were two strangers in especial, who because of being meanly garbed and of a seeming awkwardness brought forth the mockery and jest of Sir Kay the Seneschal. Nor did Sir Kay mean harm thereby, for he was knight who held no villainy. Yet was his tongue overly sharp and too oft disposed to sting and mock.  Too, the manner of their coming was strange. One was a youth of handsome mien. Despite his ill garb, he seemed of right good worship. Him, our young page Allan found fallen in a swoon, very weak and near unto death, asprawl on the green about a mile from the castle. Thinking that the man was but a villain, he would fain have called one of the men-at-arms to give him aid, but that something drew him to closer view. And then the boy felt certain that this was no villain born for his face bespoke gentle breeding. So he himself hastened for water and by much use of it the man soon opened his eyes and found himself. So he studied the lad as he helped him to greater ease but either through his great weakness or no desire he did not speak.  \"Stranger,\" said Allan to the man, \"if there is aught that I can do for you or if I can help you in any way I give you offer of service. Mayhap of the many knights who are here, there is one whose aid you may justly claim.\"  The stranger held answer for many moments, then he spoke.  \"There are those here, lad, whose service I may well accept for they hold ties of blood to me. But I would not. Rather, if your patience will bear with me, I would fain have your help so that I can appear in the presence of the King this day. For so it is ordained and by appearing there I shall find some part of my row accomplished. On this holy day, I have boon to ask from your King.\"  \"So shall I and right gladly lead you there. Good sir, my name is Allan. I am page to Sir Percival, and I would bespeak your name.\"  \"I beg of thee, Allan, think not that I am churlish and yet must I withhold my name. For it is part of the vow I have made. Nor, forsooth, am I therefore the less grateful.\"  \"No offense take I, friend. So when you feel disposed I shall guide your steps for audience with our good King.\"  The stranger, weak and spent, leaning mightily on his young friend made his way to the great hall. And as we have recounted, though all were struck by oddness and meanness of the stranger's clothes, yet only Sir Kay made point to taunt him. Yet did he make no answer to these taunts but waited with a great meekness for his turn before the King. And that he should wait with such meekness was strange for he seemed to be a high born knight.  There were many who sought audience with the King and it was long before the stranger's turn came. Weak he still was, but he made no complaint, and when others would crowd before him so that they could speak the sooner to King Arthur, he did not chide them but permitted it. At last Sir Launcelot came forward, for he had observed this and made each of them find the place which was first theirs, so that the stranger's turn came as it should. Weak though he was he walked with a great firmness to the dais, and none there saw his poor clothes for the fineness of him. The King turned to him and he nodded kindly.  \"Speak, friend. In what way can we be of service to thee?\"  \"Sire,\" said the stranger, \"I come to ask of thee three boons. One I ask this day and on this day one year I shall come before you and crave your favor for the other two.\"  \"If the boon you ask, stranger, is aught we can grant, we shall do so cheerfully, for on this day we heed all prayers.\"  \"I ask very little, sire. This and no more do I wish--that you give me food and drink for one year and that on this day a year hence I shall make my other two prayers.\"  \"It is indeed little you ask. Food and drink we refuse none. It is here. Yet while your petition might well beseem a knave, thou seemeth of right good worship, a likely youth, too, none fairer, and we would fain your prayer had been for horse and armor. Yet may you have your wish. Sir Kay,\" and the King turned to his Seneschal, \"see you to it that this stranger finds his wish satisfied.\"  So the King turned to others present, for of those who sought audience there were many. And so forgot all of the fair youth for many a day.  Sir Kay laughed mockingly at the unknown.  \"Of a truth this is villain born. For only such would ask for food and drink of the King. So therefore he shall find place in our kitchen. He shall help there, he shall have fat broth to satisfy himself and in a year no hog shall be fatter. And we shall know him as the Kitchen Boy.\"  \"Sir Kay,\" frowned Sir Launcelot, \"I pray you cease your mocking. It is not seemly. This stranger, whosoever he may be, has right to make whatsoever request he wishes.\"  \"Nay, Sir Launcelot, of a truth, as he is, so has he asked.\"  \"Yet I like not your mocking,\" said Sir Launcelot as he looked frowningly at Sir Kay, while next to him stood Sir Gawaine and Sir Percival, neither of whom could scarce contain himself.  \"It is well, we know you, Sir Kay. Or, by our guardian saints we would make you answer for your bitter tongue. But that we know it belies a heart of kindness we would long since have found quarrel with you.\" So spoke Sir Percival and Sir Gawaine nodded in assent.  \"Stay not any quarrel for any seeming knowledge of me, kind friends,\" frowned back Sir Kay.  But the two knights moved away. Sir Kay was of great shame. And so to cover it he turned to the stranger in great fury. \"Come then to your kennel, dog,\" he said.  Out flashed the sword of Sir Gawaine. Yet did Sir Launcelot withhold him.  \"Sir, I beg you to do me honor of feasting with us this day?\"  \"I thank you Sir Launcelot. Yet must I go with Sir Kay and do his bidding. There do be knights well worth their places at the Round Table. And I note right well that they set high example to those who are still but lads and who are to become knights in good time. So to you all I give my thanks.\"  Then followed the stranger after Sir Kay while the three knights and Allan watched him go and marveled at his meekness.     CHAPTER TEN  Pentecost   And so in turn came the second stranger before King Arthur. Poorly clothed, too, yet had his coat once been rich cloth of gold. Now it sat most crookedly upon him and was cut in many places so that it but barely hung upon his shoulders.  \"Sire,\" said the stranger, \"you"]]]
