Glooskap came first of all into this country, into Nova Scotia, Maine, Canada, into the land of the Wabanaki, next to sunrise. There were no Indians here then (only wild Indians very far to the west).  First born were the Mikumwess, the Oonabgemessuk, the small Elves, little men, dwellers in rocks.  And in this way he made Man: He took his bow and arrows and shot at trees, the basket-trees, the Ash. Then Indians came out of the bark of the Ash-trees. And then the Mikumwees said ... called tree-man.... [Footnote: The relater, an old woman, was quite unintelligible at this point.]  Glooskap made all the animals. He made them at first very large. Then he said to Moose, the great Moose who was as tall as Ketawkqu's, [Footnote: A giant, high as the tallest pines, or as the clouds.] \"What would you do should you see an Indian coming?\" Moose replied, \"I would tear down the trees on him.\" Then Glooskap saw that the Moose was too strong, and made him smaller, so that Indians could kill him.  Then he said to the Squirrel, who was of the size of a Wolf, \"What would you do if you should meet an Indian?\" And the Squirrel answered, \"I would scratch down trees on him.\" Then Glooskap said, \"You also are too strong,\" and he made him little. [Footnote: Another account states that Glooskap took the Squirrel in his hands and smoothed him down.]  Then he asked the great White Bear what he would do if he met an Indian; and the Bear said, \"Eat him.\" And the Master bade him go and live among rocks and ice, where he would see no Indians.  So he questioned all the beasts, changing their size or allotting their lives according to their answers.  He took the Loon for his dog; but the Loon absented himself so much that he chose for this service two wolves,--one black and one white, [Footnote: Dogs are used for beasts of burden, to draw sledges, in the North.] But the Loons are always his tale-bearers. Many years ago a man very far to the North wished to cross a bay, a great distance, from one point to another. As he was stepping into his canoe he saw a man with two dogs,--one black and one white,--who asked to be set across. The Indian said, \"You may go, but what will become of your dogs?\" Then the stranger replied, \"Let them go round by land.\" \"Nay,\" replied the Indian, \"that is much too far.\" But the stranger saying nothing, he put him across. And as they reached the landing place there stood the dogs. But when he turned his head to address the man, he was gone. So he said to himself, \"I have seen Glooskap.\"  Yet again,--but this was not so many years ago,--far in the North there were at a certain place many Indians assembled. And there was a frightful commotion, caused by the ground heaving and rumbling; the rocks shook and fell, they were greatly alarmed, and lo! Glooskap stood before them, and said, \"I go away now, but I shall return again; when you feel the ground tremble, then know it is I.\" So they will know when the last great war is to be, for then Glooskap will make the ground shake with an awful noise.  Glooskap was no friend of the Beavers; he slew many of them. Up on the Tobaic are two salt-water rocks (that is, rocks by the ocean-side, near a freshwater stream). The Great Beaver, standing there one day, was seen by Glooskap miles away, who had forbidden him that place. Then picking up a large rock where he stood by the shore, he threw it all that distance at the Beaver, who indeed dodged it; but when another came, the beast ran into a mountain, and has never come forth to this day. But the rocks which the master threw are yet to be seen.  This very interesting tradition was taken down by Mrs. W. Wallace Brown from a very old Passamaquoddy Indian woman named Molly Sepsis, who could not speak a word of English, with the aid of another younger woman named Sarah.  It will be observed that it is said in the beginning that Glooskap produced the first human beings from, the ash-tree. Ash and Elm in the Edda were the Adam and Eve of the human race. There were no intelligent men on earth--    \"Until there came three   mighty and benevolent   Aesir to the world   from their assembly   nearly powerless,   Ash and Embla (Ash and Elm),   void of destiny.    \"Spirit they possessed not,   sense they had not,   blood nor motive powers,   nor goodly color.   Spirit gave Odin,   sense gave Hoenir,   blood gave Lodur,   and good color.\" [Footnote: _The Edda of Saemund_, translated by Benjamin Thorpe. London: Trubner & Co. 1866. Voluspa, v. 17, 18.]  It is certain, however, that the _ash_ was the typic tree of all life, since the next verse of the Voluspa is devoted to Yggdrasil, the tree of existence, or of the world itself. It may be observed that in the Finnish poem of Kalevala it is by the destruction of the great oak that Wainamoien, aided by the hero of the sea, causes all things to grow. The early clearing away of trees, as a first step towards culture, may be symbolized in the shooting of arrows at the ash.  The wolf, as a beast for the deity to ride, is strongly Eddaic.    \"Magic songs they sung,   rode on wolves,   the god (Odin) and gods.\" [Footnote: _Rognnir og regin._ Odin and the Powers. Note by B. Thorpe to the _Hrafnagalar Odins_, in Edda, p.30.]  We have here within a few lines, accordingly, the elm as the parent of mankind, and wolves as the beasts of transport for the supreme deity, both in the Indian legend and in the Edda.  As Glooskap is directly declared in one tradition to keep by him as an attendant a being who is the course of the sun and of the seasons, it may be assumed that the black and white wolf represent day and night.  Again, great stress is laid in the Glooskap legend upon the fact that the last great day of battle with Malsum the Wolf and the frost-giants, stone-giants, and other powers of evil, shall be announced by an earthquake.    \"Trembles Yggdrasil's   Ash yet standing,   groans that aged tree....   and the Wolf runs....   The monster's kin goes   all with the Wolf....   The stony hills are dashed together,   The giantesses totter.   Then arises Hlin's second grief   When Odin goes   with the wolf to fight.\"  Word for word, ash-tree, giantesses, the supreme god fighting with a wolf, and falling hills, are given in the Indian myth. This is not the Christian Day of Judgment, but the Norse.  In this myth Glooskap has two wolves, one black and the other white. This is an indication of day and night, since he is distinctly stated to have as an attendant Kulpejotei, who typifies the course of the seasons. In the Eddas (Ragnarok) we are told that one wolf now follows the sun, another the moon; one Fenris, the other Moongarm:--    \"The moon's devourer   In a troll's disguise.\"  The magic arrows of Glooskap are of course worldwide, and date from the shafts of Abaris and those used among the ancient Jews for divination. But it may be observed that those of the Indian hero are like the \"Guse arrows,\" described in Oervarodd's Saga, which always hit their mark and return to the one who shoots them. [Footnote: _The Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia._ By Svent Nilsson. Edited by Sir John Lubbock, 1868.]  It is important here to compare this _old_ Algonquin account of the Creation with that of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, as given by David Cusick, himself an Indian:--  \"There was a woman who was with child, with twins. She descended from the higher world, and was received on the turtle. While she was in the distress of travail, one of the infants in her womb was moved by an evil desire, and determined to pass out under the side of the parent's arm, and the other infant endeavored in vain to prevent his design. They entered the dark world by compulsion, and their mother expired in a few minutes. One of them possessed a gentle disposition, and was named Enigorio, the Good Mind. The other possessed an insolence of character, and was called Enigonhahetgea; that is, the Bad Mind. The Good Mind was not content to remain in a dark situation, and was desirous to create a great light in the dark world; but the Bad Mind was desirous that the world should remain in its original state. The Good Mind, determined to prosecute his design, began the work of creation. Of his mother's head he made the sun, of her body the moon. After he had made creeks and rivers, animals and fishes, he formed two images of the dust of the ground in his own likeness, male and female, and by his breathing into their nostrils he gave them living souls, and named them _ea gwe howe_, that is a real people; and he gave the Great Island all the animals--of game for the inheritance of the people.... The Bad Mind, while his brother was making the universe, went through the island, and made numerous high mountains and falls of water and great steeps, and also created reptiles which would be injurious to mankind; but the Good Mind restored the island to its former condition. The Bad Mind made two images of clay in the form of mankind, but while he was giving them existence they became _apes_. The Good Mind discovered his brother's contrivances, and aided in giving them living souls.  Finding that his brother continually thwarted him, the Good Mind admonished him to behave better. The Bad Mind then offered a challenge to his brother, on condition that the victor should rule the universe. The Good Mind was willing. He falsely mentioned that whipping with flags [bulrushes] would destroy his _temporal_ life, and earnestly solicited his brother to observe the instrument of death, saying that by using deer-horns he would expire. [This is very obscure in Cusick's Indian-English.] On the day appointed the battle began; it lasted for two days; they tore up the trees and mountains; at last the Good Mind gained the victory by using the horns. The last words uttered by the Bad"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6803"],["title","Algonquin Legends of New England (#5)"],["body","were that he would have equal power over the souls of mankind after their death, and so sank down to eternal doom and became the Evil Spirit.\"  Contrasted with this hardly heathen cosmogony, which shows recent Bible influence throughout, the Algonquin narrative reads like a song from the Edda. That the latter is the original and the older there can be no doubt. Between the \"Good Mind,\" making man \"from the dust of the earth,\" and Glooskap, rousing him by magic arrows from the ash-tree, there is a great difference. It may be observed that the fight with horns is explained in another legend in this book, called the Chenoo, and that these horns are the magic horns of the Chepitch calm, or Great Serpent, who is somewhat like the dragon.  In the Algonquin story, two Loons are Glooskap's \"tale-bearers,\" which occasion him great anxiety by their prolonged absences. This is distinctly stated in the Indian legend, as it is of Odin's birds in the Edda. Odin has, as news-bringers, two ravens.    \"Hugin and Munin   Fly each day   over the spacious earth.   I fear for Hugin   that he comes not back,   yet more anxious am I   for Munin.\"  The Loons, indeed, occasioned Glooskap so much trouble by absences that he took wolves in their place. The ravens of the Edda are probably of biblical origin. But it is a most extraordinary coincidence that the Indians have a corresponding perversion of Scripture, for they say that Glooskap, when he was in the ark, that is as Noah, sent out a white dove, which returned to him colored black, and became a raven. This is not, however, related as part of the myth.  The Ancient History of the Six Nations, by David Cusick, gives us in one particular a strange coincidence with the Edda. It tells us that the Bad Mind, the principle of Evil, forced himself out into life, as Cusick expresses it in his broken Indian-English, \"under the side of the parent's arm;\" that is, through the armpit. In the Edda (Vafthrudnismal, 33) we are told of the first beings born on earth that they were twins, begotten by the two feet of a giant, and born out of his armpit.    \"Under the armpit grew,   't is said of the Hrimthurs,   a girl and boy together;   foot with foot begat,   of that wise Jotun,   a six-headed son.\"  There are in these six lines six coincidences with red Indian mythology: (1.) The Evil principle as a Jotun's first-born in the one and the Bad Mind in the other are born of the mother's armpit. (2.) In one of the tales of Lox, the Indian devil, also a giant, we are told that his feet are male and female. (3.) In both faiths this is the first birth on earth. (4.) The six-headed demon appears in a Micmac tale. (5.) There is in both the Eddaic and the Wabanaki account a very remarkable coincidence in this: that there is a Titanic or giant birth of twins on earth, followed by the creation of man from the ash-tree. (6.) The Evil principle, whether it be the Wolf-Lox, in the Wabanaki myths, or Loki in the Norse, often turns himself into a woman. Thus the male and female sex of the first-born twins is identified.  According to the Edda, the order of births on earth was as follows:--  First, two giants were born from the mother's armpit.  Secondly, the dwarfs were created.  Thirdly, man was made from the ash-tree.  According to the Wabanaki, this was the order:--  First, two giants were born, _one_ from his mother's armpit.  Secondly, the dwarfs (Mikumwessuk) were created from the bark of the ash-tree.  Thirdly, man was made from the _trunk_ of the ash.  The account of the creation of the dwarfs is wanting in the present manuscript.     _Of the Great Deeds which Glooskap did for Men; how he named the Animals, and who they were that formed his Family._  (Passamaquoddy.)   _Woodenit atbk-hagen Gloosekap_: [Footnote: Passamaquoddy.] this is a story of Glooskap. It is told in traditions of the old time that Glooskap was born in the land of the Wabanaki, which is nearest to the sunrise; but another story says that he came over the sea in a great stone canoe, and that this canoe was an island of granite covered with trees. When the great man, of all men and beasts chief ruler, had come down from this ark, he went among the Wabanaki. [Footnote: This part of the legend is from a very singular and I may add almost unintelligible manuscript, _Storey about Glooscap_, written in English by a Passamaquoddy Indian. The word _ark_ which occurs in it reminds me that the Indian from whom I obtained it once asked me if I did not think that Glooskap was the same as Noah. This sentence is as follows in the Indian-English of the original: \"Gloosecap hat left from ark come crosse even wiht wabnocelel.\"] And calling all the animals he gave them each a name: unto the Bear, _mooin_; and asked him what he would do if he should meet with a man. The Bear said, \"I fear him, and I should run.\" Now in those days the Squirrel (_mi-ko_) was greater than the Bear. Then Glooskap took him in his hands, and smoothing him down he grew smaller and smaller, till he became as we see him now. In after-days the Squirrel was Glooskap's dog, and when he so willed, grew large again and slew his enemies, however fierce they might be. But this time, when asked what he would do should he meet with a man, Mi-ko replied, \"I should run up a tree.\"  Then the Moose, being questioned, answered, standing still and looking down, \"I should run through the woods.\" And so it was with Kwah-beet the Beaver, [Footnote: This is very obscure in the original manuscript. It reads \"Herask beaber did do anything just look behager.\"] and Glooskap saw that of all created beings the first and greatest was Man.  Before men were instructed by him, they lived in darkness; it was so dark that they could not even see to slay their enemies. [Footnote: This was read to me by an Indian from a wampum record, now kept at Sebayk. I do not think I am mistaken in the phrase. It probably refers to ignorance of warlike weapons.] Glooskap taught them how to hunt, and to build huts and canoes and weirs for fish. Before he came they knew not how to make weapons or nets. He the Great Master showed them the hidden virtues of plants, roots, and barks, and pointed out to them such vegetables as might be used for food, as well as what kinds of animals, birds, and fish were to be eaten. And when this was done he taught them the names of all the stars. He loved mankind, and wherever he might be in the wilderness he was never very far from any of the Indians. He dwelt in a lonely land, but whenever they sought him they found him. [Footnote: This is from the Rand manuscript. The writer remarks that these expressions were the very words of a Micmac Indian named Stephen Flood, \"who had no idea that he was using almost the identical expressions of Holy Writ with reference to God.\"] He traveled far and wide: there is no place in all the land of the Wabanaki where he left not his name; hills, rocks and rivers, lakes and islands, bear witness to him.  Glooskap was never married, yet as he lived like other men he lived not alone. There dwelt with him an old woman, who kept his lodge; he called her Noogumee, \"my grandmother.\" (Micmac.) With her was a youth named Abistariaooch, or the Martin. (M.) And Martin could change himself to a baby or a little boy, a youth or a young man, as befitted the time in which he was to act; for all things about Glooskap were very wonderful. This Martin ate always from a small birch-bark dish, called _witch-kwed-lakun-cheech_ (M.), and when he left this anywhere Glooskap was sure to find it, and could tell from its appearance all that had befallen his family. And Martin was called by Glooskap Uch-keen (M.), \"my younger brother.\" The Lord of men and beasts had a belt which gave him magical power and endless strength. And when he lent this to Martin, the younger brother could also do great deeds, such as were only done in old times.  Martin lived much with the Mikumwess or Elves, or Fairies, and is said to have been one of them.     _How Win-pe the Sorcerer, having stolen Glooskap's Family, was by him pursued, and how, Glooskap for a Merry Jest cheated the Whale. Of the Song of the Clams, and how the Whale smoked a Pipe._  (Micmac.)   _N'kah-ne-oo_. In old times (P.), in the beginning of things, men were as animals and animals as men; how this was, no one knows. But it is told that all were at first men, and as they gave themselves up to this and that desire, and to naught else, they became beasts. But before this came to pass, they could change to one or the other form; yet even as men there was always something which showed what they were.  Now Glooskap lived on an island named Aja-lig-un-mechk, and with him were many Indians with the names and natures of animals and birds.  These men, but most of all Pulowech, the Partridge, having acquired power themselves, became jealous of Glooskap, and made up their minds to depart when he was away, taking with them Martin and the grandmother. For they had great hope that Glooskap, being left alone on the island, would perish, because they knew not his power. There is another story which says that he was living at the mouth of the Oolostook, at a place called Menogwes (St. John, N. B.), and went away into the forest as far as Goolwahgik (Juan), and had been gone six weeks, when he returned home and found the old woman, whose name was Mooinarkw, [Footnote: Mr. Rand translates this Micmac word as Mrs. Bear.] and Martin had been taken away. Following their tracks to the shore he saw one of his greatest enemies, a terrible sorcerer named Win-pe, just pushing off in his canoe. And with him were his wife and child and Dame Bear and Martin. They were still within call, and Glooskap cried from the shore to the grandmother to send back his dogs, which were not larger than mice, and, as some stories tell us, were squirrels. So she took a _woltes-takun_, which is a small wooden platter, and on such Indian dice are tossed. This she put in the water,"]]]
