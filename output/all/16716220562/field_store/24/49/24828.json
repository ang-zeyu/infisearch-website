I will lay down my life that man may be restored to his former position, so that he can again take up the part he was to play.\" The price was paid; the plan of man's redemption was effected; the divine image was again stamped upon the man, so that in Christ Jesus he could again come out and in his life's play reveal the character of God to the world.  Reader, this brings us down to your day and mine. We have our part to play in life. That part is to display the divine perfections. Through Christ this is possible. Oh, what responsibility! Will we play our part well? Again the eyes of earth, heaven, and hell are turned upon us. The apostle says, \"We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.\" 1 Cor. 4:9. \"Men\" includes both good and bad; likewise the term \"angels\" includes both good and bad angels. So, as I have said, earth, heaven, and hell are spectators. To live life as it should be lived is to act out our part upon the stage of life in such a way as to honor God and demonstrate his character before this mighty host of spectators.  Such is man. Through him the righteous character of God is made visible to the world. God himself is invisible; but since he comes into our heart and life, and since our life is physical and visible, his holiness becomes visible in our holy living. This is how to live. He who lives on a lower plane than perfect holiness is not living to God's requirements.  God did not redeem man at such a great price merely for man's sake. He redeemed him for his own glory. Redeemed man is God's purchased possession, that 'he should show forth the virtues of him who hath called him out of darkness into his marvelous light' (see marginal reading of 1 Pet. 2:9). Here again we learn that the mission of man is to show forth in his daily life the true, holy virtues of his Maker and Redeemer. This should be the first business of our life--living solely, purposely, and earnestly for God. We are beings in whom God dwells and through whom God is to display his own holy perfections. This is wonderful; this is weighty. There is, I repeat, great responsibility on man. But unless he feels it, he will never fill to the full the measure of life. Oh, how delighted is the loving heart of God to find in this world a being in whom he can dwell and through whom he can reveal his own beautiful life! Shall we yield ourselves to him? Shall we invite him into our hearts? Shall we consecrate our lives to him that he may hide our life in his life? Yes, dear Lord, we are thine, wholly thine, now and forever. Take full possession; live in us; reign in our hearts; use every faculty of our beings to thy own glory. Thy will be done in us and with us as it is done in heaven.  Jesus will gather his holy angels before him and address them thus: \"Do you behold Brother--? He is a pilgrim and stranger down there in the earth. He is my child. I have washed him in my blood and clothed him with the beautiful garments of salvation. His heart is pure and full of love. He is dead to sin and the world. He loves my will, and his daily meat and drink is to do it. He loves my Word and has hid it in his heart. He keeps all my commandments. He seeks my glory. He often communes with me. He is fervent in spirit and zealous in good works. His good deeds and prayers I bottle up here in heaven, See that beautiful mansion yonder with its gates of gold and walls of jasper, its floors of transparent glass, its corridors of chalcedony, and colonades of topaz and beryl. That mansion is to be his home when his pilgrimage in that under-world is done. By his holy walk and devoted life he is now confessing me before men, and I take great delight in telling you that he is my child and in confessing him before you and my Father on his throne. Just as I have said in my Word, he that will confess me before men, him will I confess before my Father and the holy angels.\"  Redeemed man is a light in the world. In the darkness of this world he is a dispeller of gloom. His life shines, shedding its peaceful rays of light wherever he goes.  Man's life, when meeting the fullest purpose of God, is used as a magnifying-glass through which others may look and see the beauties of divine perfections. Alas! it is to be lamented that the life of many who profess to be followers of Jesus is such that it blurs the perfections of God.  In concluding this chapter, let me give you a few rules for daily living-- rules which, if followed, will make your life a conveyancer of light, peace, and holiness from God to the world.  Live such a life that the pure and devoted will be pleased to have you come again.  Live so near to God that every man that meets you is made a little better by having met you.  Live such a life each day that the world can see in you the true way of life.  Be such a light that others can see the way to walk.     SOME USE TO JESUS.     O Christ, the way, the truth, the life,   Keep me safe mid the raging strife;   Help me a warrior brave to be   And take the battle-field for thee.    I fear not the swift arrow's power   Since thou art my high, strong-built tower;   The darts may have a bitter sting,   I shelter 'neath thy feathery wing.    Before me the Goliaths tall   Must quickly flee or headlong fall;   The foe is bruised beneath my feet;   In thee the victory is complete.    Jesus, to thee I give up all,   To live or die, to stand or fall.   The sparrows have thy kindly care;   I'm more than they, then need I fear?    I have a refuge from all harm   Within thy strong encircling arm;   Thou keepest me by day and night,   And guidest my weak steps aright.    The hairs on my unworthy head   Are numbered all, thy Book has said.   Gathered, like the defenseless brood,   My soul is kept in quietude.    As kind and loving parents would   Give to their children all things good,   So from thy presence angels bring   Unto thy child each needful thing.    Sometimes thou hidest thy sweet face;   The way is dark, I can not trace.   Thou doest best; I'll not repine,   But say, \"Thy will be done, not mine.\"    Since them art good, so good, to me,   I beg to be some use to thee:   Intensify thy love divine   Within my heart, that I may shine    A little brighter, Lord, for thee,   That others thy great love may see.   Oh, crucified let all self be,   That thou mayst shine thy light through me.    I would not be so dazzling bright   That all the world might see my light,   But in some quiet nook of thine,   An out-of-way place, there I'd shine.    'Tis not for me to shine afar,   Like blazing sun or brilliant star;   Just help me at my door to be   A little candle-light for thee.     GODLY LIVING.   When some one is spoken of as living a worldly life, it is meant that he lives in a worldly manner, or in a manner like the world. Likewise, when some one is spoken of as living a godly life, it is meant that he lives in a godly manner, or in a manner like God. To many this is a hard saying, but it is possible for man to live just such a life; in fact, it is the only right way of life. A godly life is the only true life. Such a life is demanded by the Scriptures. We are to live \"soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world\" (Tit.2:12).  God's dear children are told to be \"followers of him\" (Eph. 5:1). In some translations this reads, \"Be ye imitators of God,\" and in some others, \"Be ye mimickers of God.\" From this we understand that to be a follower of God is to live or act in a manner like him. Again, it is said of those who abide in Christ, that they should walk even as he walked. Our manner of life should be as was the life of Jesus. It is said of Christ that \"when he was reviled, he reviled not again.\" Although he was treated most shamefully by his enemies, he did not seek to avenge himself. When insulting remarks were made to him, he gave no reply. To live a godly life is to live in the same manner. When Christians are reviled, they bless; when they are persecuted, they suffer meekly and patiently. When Jesus was being put to death by his enemies, he prayed the Father to forgive them. When a man who had come to take Jesus had his ear cut off, Jesus in his tender compassion healed this bitter persecutor's wound. This is the true spirit of godliness.  The full standard of godliness is attained to only when the whole tenor of the life is in simplicity and godly sincerity. The apostle Paul said in testimony that his rejoicing was this: the testimony of his conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, he had had his conduct in the world. A godly life is wholly free from ostentation; every act is done in purest simplicity and truest sincerity. As God scrutinizes every act by his all-seeing eye, he discovers no impure motive, as vain-glory or lifting up of self; for all is in godly sincerity.  The grace of godliness in the Christian character is capable of cultivation and increase. There is a law in both the material and spiritual that exercise is conducive to growth. The Spirit-filled apostle said, \"Exercise thyself unto godliness.\" In the Emphatic this reads, \"Train thyself for piety.\" Here is something for every soul that has any aspiration to be more godly in life. Train yourself for piety. To become of deeper piety and more godly is the joy of the Christian heart. By training we become more pious. The lawn-tender forms an espalier by intertwining the branches of the vine. He keeps intertwining them as they grow, and by such training forms a latticework made of shrubbery. The soul intertwined with the meek and lowly life of Jesus will form a character of deep piety and sincere godliness. The daily life should be intertwined with the life of Jesus. Let there be no reaching out for anything outside of him. For a proper development of the Christian graces there must be a constant training or intertwining of the soul with God.

The athlete takes such exercises and eats such foods as will most properly develop and strengthen his muscles. The soul that has any longings for more of God must exercise to have its yearnings gratified. To be conscious of a growing up into Christ, to feel the soul intertwining more and more with the life of God, is fulness of joy and perfect happiness. Christian reader, is there an ardent flame of pure love in your heart? Do you walk with Jesus in a devout, trustful, reverential spirit? Do you oftentimes find your mind contemplating the wonders of creation and the glories of salvation? Is your soul habituated to breathe in the atmosphere of heaven deeply? Is that holy awe filling you? Is that tender sensibility of spiritual things filling your heart? Is that fine, keen edge upon your soul that gives such avidity for holy things? Is to become more godly a sincere desire of your heart? Then diligently perform all the duties that belong to a godly life. Some give great diligence for a time and make spiritual gain and then lose it all in a day of slackness. But do not slack, be constant, be persevering, be encouraged, reach forth, press forward,--and the prize of meekness, peace, and godliness will crown your life.     SOMETHING TO DO.   There is so much to do that every one is needed to help in doing it. In this great, busy world of life there is something for every one to do. The command is, \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\" Think over these words for a moment. Does not your heart feel that they imply great earnestness in life? They mean a life of labor--a life of service. \"Do with your might\" implies putting your whole heart into your work. Do it in just such a manner as shows you expect to make a success of it.  God has a work for every one that comes into the world. This world is going to be made a little better by your having come into it, or it will be made worse. Which shall it be? No one can do the work of another, since every one is given all he can do. It is true we are told to bear one another's burdens. I am to help you bear your burdens; that is a part of my work. You are to help me. We need the help of each other. But I can not do what you ought to do; for I have all I can do. What you neglect to do will have to go undone. If some one stops to do what you ought to do, just as large a rent is made in his life's work as would have been made in yours, but the reflection is on you.  A father who had five sons left them a certain work to do. He gave to each his portion according to his ability. Upon his return he found that four of them had done their part and done it well, but one had only partially done his. Consequently, there was a neglected spot--a dropped stitch-- which constantly showed itself. If we fail to do the work in life that God in his wisdom has assigned us, there will be in the Father's great plan a blank space, a neglected part, that will show through all eternity. Is your life or mine going to be the dropped stitch in the great web of human life? Down in our heart there is a No for an answer, is there not?  Let not the precious moments of your life flee away unimproved. Jesus is our example. He went about doing good. Everywhere he went, he left evidences that he had passed along that way. O pilgrim on life's journey, what are you leaving along the way to show in after-years that you have passed along? Is it flowers you are strewing? Is it sunshine to cheer and lighten the hearts of others? Sad indeed if there is none to say, \"He did me good.\"  It matters not how small may be the part of his great work the Father has assigned you, do that little and do it well and do it with all the earnestness of your heart. It is your part, and you should do it with as much earnestness and interest as those who are engaged in the greater works do their parts. If your part is not done well, there will not be completeness in the divine plan. A single stitch dropped shows a blemish in the garment. In the sight of God the most menial task is as sacred as that of the highest order, and when well done as greatly meets his approval.  That is a beautiful thought expressed by the Mohammed Bible. It tells of Gabriel's being sent to earth to do two things. One was to keep King Solomon from becoming so much engaged with the affairs of his kingdom as to neglect the hour of prayer. The other was to give assistance to a little ant that was trying to bear its load of food up a hillside. To Gabriel the one duty was as important as the other because both came in the plan of God. \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.\" Think these words over again. Let them have the full force of meaning to your heart. Take as much interest in helping the little child get the tangle out of the string as in building a church edifice.  Many are working, but alas! how few are doing their best! So much time and labor are being wasted; so many things are being done that had as well not be done. God wants not only our service but our best service. We are under obligation to do our best every day. If we let a day pass by without doing what we could and in the best way we could, our work is not perfectly done.  God pours his blessings out upon us, but the blessing is not to end with itself. Remember these words: \"Freely ye have received, freely give.\" Seek to be blessed of God, that you may pass the blessing on to others. Leave some footprints here upon the sands of time, so that in after-years they may guide some one to a noble deed and better way. When you reach the end of life, you can experience no greater consolation than to know you have done what you could. Improve the moments of time while you have them. They are passing swiftly. They will not wait for you. Some people are going to do, but behold, the opportunity passes before they are ready. Opportunities do not wait. Do good while you may. You are going to give the flower tomorrow, but tomorrow the flower may have faded. You intended to speak a kind word yesterday, but thought you would defer until another day. But the strain was so great the life went out, and your kind word came too late. Today is the day to save the lost. Tomorrow may be too late. How sad that a soul through all eternity will be crying out, \"You were going to help me, but you came too late.\" O God! help us to be up and doing while it is called today. What work you are going to do, do it now as the poet urges in the following beautiful lines:    \"Let's not be living in the past,    On what we have been doing,   Nor building castles in the air    And after them pursuing.   'Work in my vineyard, go today':    The Master's time is narrow   For yesterday we'll see no more--    We may not see tomorrow.    \"If for discouragements you look,    You certainly shall find them,   But they are not discouragements    Except to those who mind them.   The future for itself will care,    We'll not its trouble borrow;   Sufficient evil is today,    Then think not of the morrow.    \"Let's cast our bread upon the flood,    In many days to gather,   But then at eve hold out the hand    For present blessings rather.   We hide the seed deep in the ground    And watch the closing furrow,   When, lo! the field's already white,    Not waiting for the morrow.    \"The sower and the reaper both    May now rejoice together,   For what they sow and gather in    Is fruit that lives forever.   The saint rejoices evermore,    E'en in the midst of sorrow;   He knows the weeping's but a night,    Joy cometh on the morrow.\"  Man was made to labor. He is so constituted that he can not find true rest and enjoyment in idleness. How much the Bible says about good works! We are \"created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.\" Jesus purifies unto \"himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\" We are told by the scriptures to \"be careful to maintain good works\" to \"be not weary in well-doing,\" and to \"do good unto all men.\" Time is given us to spend in usefulness, not in idleness. Money lost may be regained, but a moment never.  As Christians we have the mind of Jesus. With such a mind we can not be contented unless we are doing the will of God and making the proper use of the moments he gives us. Mind is the same quality whether it be in Jesus, in angels, or in men, and it is governed by the same laws. It is true that after man's transgression he was told that in the sweat of his face he should eat bread, but this does not imply that the disposition to labor is a result of the fall. The disposition to labor that we find in man's constitution is not the fruit of corruption in his nature, but is a part of his original constitution. We find this disposition in the mind of angels. They are ministering spirits. They are doing the will of God. How often we read in the Book that tells of heaven how angels have visited this transitory world of ours on errands of help, mercy, and consolation. They have closed the mouths of lions, opened prison doors, stilled the waves, whispered comforting words, rolled away the stone, and ministered strength and help to the needy.  Man is not designed for prayer and praise only; he is designed for service as well. His mission is twofold: he is to adore and praise his Creator and to serve his fellow men. Some have symbolized the two functions of man's life by the ascending and descending of the angels on the ladder that Jacob saw in his dream. They ascended to God and descended to man. Life should be spent in praising God and in serving man for God's sake.  There is something to do. There is much to do. There is too much to do for us to idle away one moment of time. A full and well-spent life is one which is spent in doing good out of pure love to God and "]]]
