I don't believe you'd hurt a fly, although you do look so like a pirate. You've probably got a goody little conscience, so white and soft that you'd die of shame to have people see it.\"  \"Excuse me, Lady Macbeth,\" he said, laughing; \"I don't wish to underrate your powers of depravity, but which of your soul-destroying sins would you prefer to forget, if indeed any of them are shocking enough to trouble your excessively hardened conscience?  \"Well, I must admit,\" said Madeline, seriously, \"that I wouldn't care to forget anything I've done, not even my faults and follies. I should be afraid if they were taken away that I shouldn't have any character left.\"  \"Don't put it on that ground,\" said Henry, \"it's sheer vanity that makes you say so. You know your faults are just big enough to be beauty-spots, and that's why you'd rather keep 'em.\"  She reflected a moment, and then said, decisively--  \"That's a compliment. I don't believe I like 'em from you. Don't make me any more.\"  Perhaps she did not take the trouble to analyse the sentiment that prompted her words. Had she done so, she would doubtless have found it in a consciousness when in his presence of being surrounded with so fine and delicate an atmosphere of unspoken devotion that words of flattery sounded almost gross.  They paused before a gate. Pushing it open and passing within, she said, \"Good-night.\"  \"One word more. I have a favour to ask,\" he said. \"May I take you to the picnic?\"  \"Why, I think no escort will be necessary,\" she replied; \"we go in broad daylight; and there are no bears or Indians at Hemlock Hollow.\"  \"But your basket. You'll need somebody to carry your basket.\"  \"Oh yes, to be sure, my basket,\" she exclaimed, with an ironical accent. \"It will weigh at least two pounds, and I couldn't possibly carry it myself, of course. By all means come, and much obliged for your thoughtfulness.\"  But as she turned to go in she gave him a glance which had just enough sweetness in it to neutralize the irony of her words. In the treatment of her lovers, Madeline always punctured the skin before applying a drop of sweetness, and perhaps this accounted for the potent effect it had to inflame the blood, compared with more profuse but superficial applications of less sharp-tongued maidens.  Henry waited until the graceful figure had a moment revealed its charming outline against the lamp-lit interior, as she half turned to close the door. Love has occasional metaphysical turns, and it was an odd feeling that came over him as he walked away, being nothing less than a rush of thankfulness and self-congratulation that he was not Madeline. For, if he had been she, he would have lost the ecstasy of loving her, of worshipping her. Ah, how much she lost, how much all those lose, who, fated to be the incarnations of beauty, goodness, and grace, are precluded from being their own worshippers! Well, it was a consolation that she didn't know it, that she actually thought that, with her little coquetries and exactions, she was enjoying the chief usufruct of her beauty. God make up to the haughty, wilful darling in some other way for missing the passing sweetness of the thrall she held her lovers in!  When Burr reached home, he found his sister Laura standing at the gate in a patch of moonlight.  \"How pretty you look to-night!\" he said, pinching her round cheek.  The young lady merely shrugged her shoulders, and replied dryly--  \"So she let you go home with her.\"  \"How do you know that?\" he asked, laughing at her shrewd guess.  \"Because you're so sweet, you goosey, of course.\"  But, in truth, any such mode of accounting for Henry's favourable comment on her appearance was quite unnecessary. Laura, with her petite, plump figure, sloe-black eyes, quick in moving, curly head, and dark, clear cheeks, carnation-tinted, would have been thought by many quite as charming a specimen of American girlhood as the stately pale brunette who swayed her brother's affections.  \"Come for a walk, chicken! It is much too pretty a night to go indoors,\" he said.  \"Yes, and furnish ears for Madeline's praises, with a few more reflected compliments for pay, perhaps,\" she replied, contemptuously. \"Besides,\" she added, \"I must go into the house and keep father company. I only came out to cool off after baking the cake. You'd better come in too. These moonlight nights always make him specially sad, you know.\"  The brother and sister had been left motherless not long before, and Laura, in trying to fill her mother's place in the household, so far as she might, was always looking out that her father should have as little opportunity as possible to brood alone over his companionless condition.     CHAPTER II.   That same night toward morning Henry suddenly awoke from a sound sleep. Drowsiness, by some strange influence, had been completely banished from his eyes, and in its stead he became sensible of a profound depression of spirits. Physically, he was entirely comfortable, nor could he trace to any sensation from without either this sudden awakening or the mental condition in which he found himself. It was not that he thought of anything in particular that was gloomy or discouraging, but that all the ends and aims, not only of his own individual life, but of life in general, had assumed an aspect so empty, vain, and colourless, that he felt he would not rise from his bed for anything existence had to offer. He recalled his usual frame of mind, in which these things seemed attractive, with a dull wonderment that so baseless a delusion should be so strong and so general. He wondered if it were possible that it should ever again come over him.  The cold, grey light of earliest morning, that light which is rather the fading of night than the coming of day, filled the room with a faint hue, more cheerless than pitchiest darkness. A distant bell, with slow and heavy strokes, struck three. It was the dead point in the daily revolution of the earth's life, that point just before dawn, when men oftenest die; when surely, but for the force of momentum, the course of nature would stop, and at which doubtless it will one day pause eternally, when the clock is run down. The long-drawn reverberations of the bell, turning remoteness into music, full of the pathos of a sad and infinite patience, died away with an effect unspeakably dreary. His spirit, drawn forth after the vanishing vibrations, seemed to traverse waste spaces without beginning or ending, and aeons of monotonous duration. A sense of utter loneliness--loneliness inevitable, crushing, eternal, the loneliness of existence, encompassed by the infinite void of unconsciousness--enfolded him as a pall. Life lay like an incubus on his bosom. He shuddered at the thought that death might overlook him, and deny him its refuge. Even Madeline's face, as he conjured it up, seemed wan and pale, moving to unutterable pity, powerless to cheer, and all the illusions and passions of love were dim as ball-room candles in the grey light of dawn.  Gradually the moon passed, and he slept again.  As early as half-past eight the following forenoon, groups of men with very serious faces were to be seen standing at the corners of the streets, conversing in hushed tones, and women with awed voices were talking across the fences which divided adjoining yards. Even the children, as they went to school, forgot to play, and talked in whispers together, or lingered near the groups of men to catch a word or two of their conversation, or, maybe, walked silently along with a puzzled, solemn look upon their bright faces.  For a tragedy had occurred at dead of night which never had been paralleled in the history of the village. That morning the sun, as it peered through the closed shutters of an upper chamber, had relieved the darkness of a thing it had been afraid of. George Bayley sat there in a chair, his head sunk on his breast, a small, blue hole in his temple, whence a drop or two of blood had oozed, quite dead.  This, then, was what he meant when he said that he had made arrangements for leaving the village. The doctor thought that the fatal shot must have been fired about three o'clock that morning, and, when Henry heard this, he knew that it was the breath of the angel of death as he flew by that had chilled the genial current in his veins.  Bayley's family lived elsewhere, and his father, a stern, cold, haughty-looking man, was the only relative present at the funeral. When Mr. Lewis undertook to tell him, for his comfort, that there was reason to believe that George was out of his head when he took his life, Mr. Bayley interrupted him.  \"Don't say that,\" he said. \"He knew what he was doing. I should not wish any one to think otherwise. I am prouder of him than I had ever expected to be again.\"  A choir of girls with glistening eyes sang sweet, sad songs at the funeral, songs which, while they lasted, took away the ache of bereavement, like a cool sponge pressed upon a smarting spot. It seemed almost cruel that they must ever cease. And, after the funeral, the young men and girls who had known George, not feeling like returning that day to their ordinary thoughts and occupations, gathered at the house of one of them and passed the hours till dusk, talking tenderly of the departed, and recalling his generous traits and gracious ways.  The funeral had taken place on the day fixed for the picnic. The latter, in consideration of the saddened temper of the young people, was put off a fortnight.     CHAPTER III.   About half-past eight on the morning of the day set for the postponed picnic, Henry knocked at Widow Brand's door. He had by no means forgotten Madeline's consent to allow him to carry her basket, although two weeks had intervened.  She came to the door herself. He had never seen her in anything that set off her dark eyes and olive complexion more richly than the simple"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7052"],["title","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process (#3)"],["body","dress of white, trimmed with a little crimson braid about the neck and sleeves, which she wore to-day. It was gathered up at the bottom for wandering in the woods, just enough to show the little boots. She looked surprised at seeing him, and exclaimed--  \"You haven't come to tell me that the picnic is put off again, or Laura's sick?\"  \"The picnic is all right, and Laura too. I've come to carry your basket for you.\"  \"Why, you're really very kind,\" said she, as if she thought him slightly officious.  \"Don't you remember you told me I might do so?\" he said, getting a little red under her cool inspection.  \"When did I?\"  \"Two weeks ago, that evening poor George spoke in meeting.\"  \"Oh!\" she answered, smiling, \"so long ago as that? What a terrible memory you have! Come in just a moment, please; I'm nearly ready.\"  Whether she merely took his word for it, or whether she had remembered her promise perfectly well all the time, and only wanted to make him ask twice for the favour, lest he should feel too presumptuous, I don't pretend to know. Mrs. Brand set a chair for him with much cordiality. She was a gentle, mild-mannered little lady, such a contrast in style and character to Madeline that there was a certain amusing fitness in the latter's habit of calling her \"My baby.\"  \"You have a very pleasant day for your picnic, Mr. Burr,\" said she.  \"Yes, we are very lucky,\" replied Henry, his eyes following Madeline's movements as she stood before the glass, putting on her hat, which had a red feather in it.  To have her thus add the last touches to her toilet in his presence was a suggestion of familiarity, of domesticity, that was very intoxicating to his imagination.  \"Is your father well?\" inquired Mrs. Brand, affably.  \"Very well, thank you, very well indeed,\" he replied  \"There; now I'm ready,\" said Madeline. \"Here's the basket, Henry. Good-bye, mother.\"  They were a well-matched pair, the stalwart young man and the tall, graceful girl, and it is no wonder the girl's mother stood in the door looking after them with a thoughtful smile.  Hemlock Hollow was a glen between wooded bluffs, about a mile up the beautiful river on which Newville was situated, and boats had been collected at the rendezvous on the river-bank to convey the picnickers thither. On arriving, Madeline and Henry found all the party assembled and in capital spirits; There was still just enough shadow on their merriment to leave the disposition to laugh slightly in excess of its indulgence, than which no condition of mind more favourable to a good time can be imagined.  Laura was there, and to her Will Taylor had attached himself. He was a dapper little black-eyed fellow, a clerk in the dry-goods store, full of fun and good-nature, and a general favourite, but it was certainly rather absurd that Henry should be apprehensive of him as a rival. There also was Fanny Miller, who had the prettiest arm in Newville, a fact discovered once when she wore a Martha Washington toilet at a masquerade sociable, and since circulated from mouth to mouth among the young men. And there, too, was Emily Hunt, who had shocked the girls and thrown the youth into a pleasing panic by appearing at a young people's party the previous winter in low neck and short sleeves. It is to be remarked in extenuation that she had then but recently come from the city, and was not familiar with Newville etiquette. Nor must I forget to mention Ida Lewis, the minister's daughter, a little girl with poor complexion and beautiful brown eyes, who cherished a hopeless passion for Henry. Among the young men was Harry Tuttle, the clerk in the confectionery and fancy goods store, a young man whose father had once sent him for a term to a neighbouring seminary, as a result of which classical experience he still retained a certain jaunty student air verging on the rakish, that was admired by the girls and envied by the young men.  And there, above all, was Tom Longman. Tom was a big, hulking fellow, good-natured and simple-hearted in the extreme. He was the victim of an intense susceptibility to the girls' charms, joined with an intolerable shyness and self-consciousness when in their presence. From this consuming embarrassment he would seek relief by working like a horse whenever there was anything to do. With his hands occupied he had an excuse for not talking to the girls or being addressed by them, and, thus shielded from the, direct rays of their society, basked with inexpressible emotions in the general atmosphere of sweetness and light which they diffused. He liked picnics because there was much work to do, and never attended indoor parties because there was none. This inordinate taste for industry in connection with social enjoyment on Tom's part was strongly encouraged by the other young men, and they were the ones who always stipulated that he should be of the party when there was likely to be any call for rowing, taking care of horses, carrying of loads, putting out of croquet sets, or other manual exertion. He was generally an odd one in such companies. It would be no kindness to provide him a partner, and, besides, everybody made so many jokes about him that none of the girls quite cared to have their names coupled with his, although they all had a compassionate liking for him.  On the present occasion this poor slave of the petticoat had been at work preparing the boats all the morning.  \"Why, how nicely you have arranged everything!\" said Madeline kindly, as she stood on the sand waiting for Henry to bring up a boat.  \"What?\" replied Tom, laughing in a flustered way.  He always laughed just so and said \"what?\" when any of the girls spoke to him, being too much confused by the fact of being addressed to catch what was said the first time.  \"It's very good of you to arrange the boats for us, Madeline repeated.  \"Oh, 'tain't anything, 'tain't anything at all,\" he blurted out, with a very red face.  \"You are going up in our boat, ain't you, Longman?\" said Harry Tuttle.  \"No, Tom, you're going with us,\" cried another young man.  \"He's going with us, like a sensible fellow,\" said Will Taylor, who, with Laura Burr, was sitting on the forward thwart of the boat, into the stern of which Henry was now assisting Madeline.  \"Tom, these lazy young men are just wanting you to do their rowing for them,\" said she. \"Get into our boat, and I'll make Henry row you.\"  \"What do you say to that, Henry?\" said Tom, snickering.  \"It isn't for me to say anything after Madeline has spoken,\" replied the young man.  \"She has him in good subjection,\" remarked Ida Lewis, not over-sweetly.  \"All right, I'll come in your boat, Miss Brand, if you'll take care of me,\" said Tom, with a sudden spasm of boldness, followed by violent blushes at the thought that perhaps be had said something too free. The boat was pushed off. Nobody took the oars.  \"I thought you were going to row?\" said Madeline, turning to Henry, who sat beside her in the stern.  \"Certainly,\" said he, making as if he would rise. \"Tom, you just sit here while I row.\"  \"Oh no, I'd just as lief row,\" said Tom, seizing the oars with feverish haste.  \"So would I, Tom; I want a little exercise,\" urged Henry with a hypocritical grin, as he stood up in an attitude of readiness.  \"Oh, I like to row. 'I'd a great deal rather. Honestly,\" asseverated Tom, as he made the water foam with the violence of his strokes, compelling Henry to resume his seat to preserve his equilibrium.  \"It's perfectly plain that you don't want to sit by me, Tom. That hurts my feelings,\" said Madeline, pretending to pout.  \"Oh no, it isn't that,\" protested Tom. \"Only I'd rather row; that is, I mean, you know, it's such fun rowing.\"  \"Very well, then,\" said Madeline, \"I sha'n't help you any more; and here they all are tying their boats on to ours.\"  Sure enough, one of the other boats had fastened its chain to the stern of theirs, and the others had fastened to that; their oarsmen were lying off and Tom was propelling the entire flotilla.  \"Oh, I can row 'em all just as easy's not,\" gasped the devoted youth, the perspiration rolling down his forehead.  But this was a little too bad, and Henry soon cast off the other boats, in spite of the protests of their occupants, who regarded Tom's brawn and muscle as the common stock of the entire party, which no one boat had a right to appropriate.  On reaching Hemlock Hollow, Madeline asked the poor young man for his hat, and returned it to him adorned with evergreens, which nearly distracted him with bashfulness and delight, and drove him to seek a safety-valve for his excitement in superhuman activity all the rest of the morning, arranging croquet sets, hanging swings, breaking ice, squeezing lemons, and fetching water.  \"Oh, how thirsty I am!\" sighed Madeline, throwing down her croquet mallet.  \"The ice-water is not yet ready, but I know a spring a little way off where the water is cold as ice,\" said Henry.  \"Show it to me this instant,\" she cried, and they walked off together, followed by Ida Lewis's unhappy eyes.  The distance to the spring was not great, but the way was rough, and once or twice he had to help her over fallen trees and steep banks. Once she slipped a little, and for, a single supreme moment he held her whole weight in his arms. Before, they had been talking and laughing gaily, but that made a sudden silence. He dared not look at her for some moments, and when he did there was a slight flush tingeing her usually colourless cheek.  His pulses were already bounding wildly, and, at this betrayal that she had shared his consciousness at that moment, his agitation was tenfold increased. It was the first time she had ever shown a sign of confusion in his presence. The sensation of mastery, of power over her, which it gave, was so utterly new that it put a sort of madness in his blood. Without a word they came to the spring and pretended to drink. As she turned to go back, he lightly caught her fingers in a detaining clasp, and"]]]
