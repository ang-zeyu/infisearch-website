WILHELM TELL.     ACT I.  SCENE I.     A high, rocky shore of the lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz.    The lake makes a bend into the land; a hut stands at a short    distance from the shore; the fisher boy is rowing about in his    boat. Beyond the lake are seen the green meadows, the hamlets,    and arms of Schwytz, lying in the clear sunshine. On the left    are observed the peaks of the Hacken, surrounded with clouds; to    the right, and in the remote distance, appear the Glaciers. The    Ranz des Vaches, and the tinkling of cattle-bells, continue for    some time after the rising of the curtain.  FISHER BOY (sings in his boat). Melody of the Ranz des Vaches.     The clear, smiling lake wooed to bathe in its deep,    A boy on its green shore had laid him to sleep;         Then heard he a melody          Flowing and soft,         And sweet, as when angels          Are singing aloft.    And as thrilling with pleasure he wakes from his rest,    The waters are murmuring over his breast;         And a voice from the deep cries,          \"With me thou must go,         I charm the young shepherd,          I lure him below.\"  HERDSMAN (on the mountains). Air.--Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.          Farewell, ye green meadows,          Farewell, sunny shore,         The herdsman must leave you,          The summer is o'er.    We go to the hills, but you'll see us again,     When the cuckoo is calling, and wood-notes are gay,    When flowerets are blooming in dingle and plain,     And the brooks sparkle up in the sunshine of May.         Farewell, ye green meadows,          Farewell, sunny shore,         The herdsman must leave you,          The summer is o'er.  CHAMOIS HUNTER (appearing on the top of a cliff). Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.     On the heights peals the thunder, and trembles the bridge,    The huntsman bounds on by the dizzying ridge,         Undaunted he hies him          O'er ice-covered wild,         Where leaf never budded,          Nor spring ever smiled;    And beneath him an ocean of mist, where his eye    No longer the dwellings of man can espy;         Through the parting clouds only          The earth can be seen,         Far down 'neath the vapor          The meadows of green.     [A change comes over the landscape. A rumbling, cracking    noise is heard among the mountains. Shadows of clouds sweep    across the scene.     [RUODI, the fisherman, comes out of his cottage. WERNI, the    huntsman, descends from the rocks. KUONI, the shepherd, enters,    with a milk pail on his shoulders, followed by SERPI, his assistant.  RUODI. Bestir thee, Jenni, haul the boat on shore. The grizzly Vale-king [1] comes, the glaciers moan, The lofty Mytenstein [2] draws on his hood, And from the Stormcleft chilly blows the wind; The storm will burst before we are prepared.  KUONI. 'Twill rain ere long; my sheep browse eagerly, And Watcher there is scraping up the earth.  WERNI. The fish are leaping, and the water-hen Dives up and down. A storm is coming on.  KUONI (to his boy). Look, Seppi, if the cattle are not straying.  SEPPI. There goes brown Liesel, I can hear her bells.  KUONI. Then all are safe; she ever ranges farthest.  RUODI. You've a fine yoke of bells there, master herdsman.  WERNI. And likely cattle, too. Are they your own?  KUONI. I'm not so rich. They are the noble lord's Of Attinghaus, and trusted to my care.  RUODI. How gracefully yon heifer bears her ribbon!  KUONI. Ay, well she knows she's leader of the herd, And, take it from her, she'd refuse to feed.  RUODI. You're joking now. A beast devoid of reason.  WERNI. That's easy said. But beasts have reason too-- And that we know, we men that hunt the chamois. They never turn to feed--sagacious creatures! Till they have placed a sentinel ahead, Who pricks his ears whenever we approach, And gives alarm with clear and piercing pipe.  RUODI (to the shepherd). Are you for home?  KUONI.           The Alp is grazed quite bare.  WERNI. A safe return, my friend!  KUONI.               The same to you? Men come not always back from tracks like yours.  RUODI. But who comes here, running at topmost speed?  WERNI. I know the man; 'tis Baumgart of Alzellen.  CONRAD BAUMGARTEN (rushing in breathless). For God's sake, ferryman, your boat!  RUODI.                    How now? Why all this haste?  BAUMGARTEN.            Cast off! My life's at stake! Set me across!  KUONI.         Why, what's the matter, friend?  WERNI. Who are pursuing you? First tell us that.  BAUMGARTEN (to the fisherman). Quick, quick, even now they're close upon my heels! The viceroy's horsemen are in hot pursuit! I'm a lost man should they lay hands upon me.  RUODI. Why are the troopers in pursuit of you?  BAUMGARTEN. First save my life and then I'll tell you all.  WERNI. There's blood upon your garments--how is this?  BAUMGARTEN. The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg.  KUONI. How! What! The Wolfshot? [3] Is it he pursues you?  BAUMGARTEN. He'll ne'er hunt man again; I've settled him.  ALL (starting back). Now, God forgive you, what is this you've done!  BAUMGARTEN. What every free man in my place had done. I have but used mine own good household right 'Gainst him that would have wronged my wife--my honor.  KUONI. And has he wronged you in your honor, then?  BAUMGARTEN. That he did not fulfil his foul desire Is due to God and to my trusty axe.  WERNI. You've cleft his skull, then, have you, with your axe?  KUONI. Oh, tell us all! You've time enough, before The boat can be unfastened from its moorings.  BAUMGARTEN. When I was in the forest, felling timber, My wife came running out in mortal fear: \"The seneschal,\" she said, \"was in my house, Had ordered her to get a bath prepared, And thereupon had taken unseemly freedoms, From which she rid herself and flew to me.\" Armed as I was I sought him, and my axe Has given his bath a bloody benediction.  WERNI. And you did well; no man can blame the deed.  KUONI. The tyrant! Now he has his just reward! We men of Unterwald have owed it long.  BAUMGARTEN. The deed got wind, and now they're in pursuit. Heavens! whilst we speak, the time is flying fast.     [It begins to thunder.  KUONI. Quick, ferrymen, and set the good man over.  RUODI. Impossible! a storm is close at hand, Wait till it pass! You must.  BAUMGARTEN.                 Almighty heavens! I cannot wait; the least delay is death.  KUONI (to the fisherman). Push out. God with you! We should help our neighbors; The like misfortune may betide us all.     [Thunder and the roaring of the wind.  RUODI. The south wind's up! [4] See how the lake is rising! I cannot steer against both storm and wave.  BAUMGARTEN (clasping him by the knees). God so help you, as now you pity me!  WERNI. His life's at stake. Have pity on him, man!  KUONI. He is a father: has a wife and children.     [Repeated peals of thunder.  RUODI. What! and have I not, then, a life to lose, A wife and child at home as well as he? See, how the breakers foam, and toss, and whirl, And the lake eddies up from all its depths! Right gladly would I save the worthy man, But 'tis impossible, as you must see.  BAUMGARTEN (still kneeling). Then must I fall into the tyrant's hands, And with the port of safety close in sight! Yonder it lies! My eyes can measure it, My very voice can echo to its shores. There is the boat to carry me across, Yet must I lie here helpless and forlorn.  KUONI. Look! who comes here?  RUODI.             'Tis Tell, brave Tell, of Buerglen. [5]     [Enter TELL, with a crossbow.  TELL. Who is the man that here implores for aid?  KUONI. He is from Alzellen, and to guard his honor From touch of foulest shame, has slain the Wolfshot! The imperial seneschal, who dwelt at Rossberg. The viceroy's troopers are upon his heels; He begs the boatman here to take him over, But he, in terror of the storm, refuses.  RUODI. Well, there is Tell can steer as well as I. He'll be my judge, if it be possible.     [Violent peals of thunder--the lake becomes more tempestuous.  Am I to plunge into the jaws of hell? I should be mad to dare the desperate act.  TELL. The brave man thinks upon himself the last. Put trust in God, and help him in his need!  RUODI. Safe in the port, 'tis easy to advise. There is the boat, and there the lake! Try you!  TELL. The lake may pity, but the viceroy will not. Come, venture, man!  SHEPHERD and HUNTSMAN.            Oh, save him! save him! save him!  RUODI. Though 'twere my brother, or my darling child, I would not go. It is St. Simon's day,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788"],["title","Wilhelm Tell (#1)"],["body"," lake is up, and calling for its victim.  TELL. Naught's to be done with idle talking here. Time presses on--the man must be assisted. Say, boatman, will you venture?  RUODI.                  No; not I.  TELL. In God's name, then, give me the boat! I will With my poor strength, see what is to be done!  KUONI. Ha, noble Tell!  WERNI.          That's like a gallant huntsman!  BAUMGARTEN. You are my angel, my preserver, Tell.  TELL. I may preserve you from the viceroy's power But from the tempest's rage another must. Yet you had better fall into God's hands, Than into those of men.    [To the herdsman.              Herdsman, do thou Console my wife, should aught of ill befall me. I do but what I may not leave undone.     [He leaps into the boat.  KUONI (to the fisherman). A pretty man to be a boatman, truly! What Tell could risk you dared not venture on.  RUODI. Far better men than I would not ape Tell. There does not live his fellow 'mong the mountains.  WERNI (who has ascended a rock). He pushes off. God help thee now, brave sailor! Look how his bark is reeling on the waves!  KUONI (on the shore). The surge has swept clean over it. And now 'Tis out of sight. Yet stay, there 'tis again Stoutly he stems the breakers, noble fellow!  SEPPI. Here come the troopers hard as they can ride!  KUONI. Heavens! so they do! Why, that was help, indeed.     [Enter a troop of horsemen.  FIRST HORSEMAN. Give up the murderer! You have him here!  SECOND HORSEMAN. This way he came! 'Tis useless to conceal him!  RUODI and KUONI. Whom do you mean?  FIRST HORSEMAN (discovering the boat).           The devil! What do I see?  WERNI (from above). Is't he in yonder boat ye seek? Ride on, If you lay to, you may o'ertake him yet.  SECOND HORSEMAN. Curse on you, he's escaped!  FIRST HORSEMAN (to the shepherd and fisherman).                You helped him off, And you shall pay for it. Fall on their herds! Down with the cottage! burn it! beat it down!                   [They rush off.  SEPPI (hurrying after them). Oh, my poor lambs!  KUONI (following him).           Unhappy me, my herds!  WERNI. The tyrants!  RUODI (wringing his hands).        Righteous Heaven! Oh, when will come Deliverance to this devoted land?                    [Exeunt severally.    SCENE II.     A lime-tree in front of STAUFFACHER'S house at Steinen,    in Schwytz, upon the public road, near a bridge.     WERNER STAUFFACHER and PFEIFFER, of Lucerne, enter into    conversation.  PFEIFFER. Ay, ay, friend Stauffacher, as I have said, Swear not to Austria, if you can help it. Hold by the empire stoutly as of yore, And God preserve you in your ancient freedom!     [Presses his hand warmly and is going.  STAUFFACHER. Wait till my mistress comes. Now do! You are My guest in Schwytz--I in Lucerne am yours.  PFEIFFER. Thanks! thanks! But I must reach Gersau to-day. Whatever grievances your rulers' pride And grasping avarice may yet inflict, Bear them in patience--soon a change may come. Another emperor may mount the throne. But Austria's once, and you are hers forever.                    [Exit.     [STAUFEACHER sits down sorrowfully upon a bench    under the lime tree. Gertrude, his wife, enters,    and finds him in this posture. She places herself    near him, and looks at him for some time in silence.  GERTRUDE. So sad, my love! I scarcely know thee now. For many a day in silence I have marked A moody sorrow furrowing thy brow. Some silent grief is weighing on thy heart; Trust it to me. I am thy faithful wife, And I demand my half of all thy cares.     [STAUFFACHER gives her his hand and is silent.  Tell me what can oppress thy spirits thus? Thy toil is blest--the world goes well with thee-- Our barns are full--our cattle many a score; Our handsome team of sleek and well-fed steeds, Brought from the mountain pastures safely home, To winter in their comfortable stalls. There stands thy house--no nobleman's more fair! 'Tis newly built with timber of the best, All grooved and fitted with the nicest skill; Its many glistening windows tell of comfort! 'Tis quartered o'er with scutcheons of all hues, And proverbs sage, which passing travellers Linger to read, and ponder o'er their meaning.  STAUFFACHER. The house is strongly built, and handsomely, But, ah! the ground on which we built it totters.  GERTRUDE. Tell me, dear Werner, what you mean by that?  STAUFFACHER. No later since than yesterday, I sat Beneath this linden, thinking with delight, How fairly all was finished, when from Kuessnacht The viceroy and his men came riding by. Before this house he halted in surprise: At once I rose, and, as beseemed his rank, Advanced respectfully to greet the lord, To whom the emperor delegates his power, As judge supreme within our Canton here. \"Who is the owner of this house?\" he asked, With mischief in his thoughts, for well he knew. With prompt decision, thus I answered him: \"The emperor, your grace--my lord and yours, And held by one in fief.\" On this he answered, \"I am the emperor's viceregent here, And will not that each peasant churl should build At his own pleasure, bearing him as freely As though he were the master in the land. I shall make bold to put a stop to this!\" So saying he, with menaces, rode off, And left me musing, with a heavy heart, On the fell purpose that his words betrayed.  GERTRUDE. Mine own dear lord and husband! Wilt thou take A word of honest counsel from thy wife? I boast to be the noble Iberg's child, A man of wide experience. Many a time, As we sat spinning in the winter nights, My sisters and myself, the people's chiefs Were wont to gather round our father's hearth, To read the old imperial charters, and To hold sage converse on the country's weal. Then heedfully I listened, marking well What or the wise men thought, or good man wished, And garnered up their wisdom in my heart. Hear then, and mark me well; for thou wilt see, I long have known the grief that weighs thee down. The viceroy hates thee, fain would injure thee, For thou hast crossed his wish to bend the Swiss In homage to this upstart house of princes, And kept them stanch, like their good sires of old, In true allegiance to the empire. Say. Is't not so, Werner? Tell nee, am I wrong?  STAUFFACHER. 'Tis even so. For this doth Gessler hate me.  GERTRUDE. He burns with envy, too, to see thee living Happy and free on thy inheritance, For he has none. From the emperor himself Thou holdest in fief the lands thy fathers left thee. There's not a prince in the empire that can show A better title to his heritage; For thou hast over thee no lord but one, And he the mightiest of all Christian kings. Gessler, we know, is but a younger son, His only wealth the knightly cloak he wears; He therefore views an honest man's good fortune With a malignant and a jealous eye. Long has he sworn to compass thy destruction As yet thou art uninjured. Wilt thou wait Till he may safely give his malice scope? A wise man would anticipate the blow.  STAUFFACHER. What's to be done?  GERTRUDE.           Now hear what I advise. Thou knowest well, how here with us in Schwytz, All worthy men are groaning underneath This Gessler's grasping, grinding tyranny. Doubt not the men of Unterwald as well, And Uri, too, are chafing like ourselves, At this oppressive and heart-wearying yoke. For there, across the lake, the Landenberg Wields the same iron rule as Gessler here-- No fishing-boat comes over to our side But brings the tidings of some new encroachment, Some outrage fresh, more grievous than the last. Then it were well that some of you--true men-- Men sound at heart, should secretly devise How best to shake this hateful thraldom off. Well do I know that God would not desert you, But lend his favor to the righteous cause. Hast thou no friend in Uri, say, to whom Thou frankly may'st unbosom all thy thoughts?  STAUFFACHER. I know full many a gallant fellow there, And nobles, too,--great men, of high repute, In whom I can repose unbounded trust.                   [Rising.  Wife! What a storm of wild and perilous thoughts Hast thou stirred up within my tranquil breast? The darkest musings of my bosom thou Hast dragged to light, and placed them full before me, And what I scarce dared harbor e'en in thought, Thou speakest plainly out, with fearless tongue. But hast thou weighed well what thou urgest thus? Discord will come, and the fierce clang of arms, To scare this valley's long unbroken peace, If we, a feeble shepherd race, shall dare Him to the fight that lords it o'er the world. Even now they only wait some fair pretext For setting loose their savage warrior hordes, To scourge and ravage this devoted land, To lord it o'er us with the victor's rights, And 'neath the show of lawful chastisement, Despoil us of our chartered liberties.  GERTRUDE. You, too, are men; can wield a battle-axe As well as they. God ne'er deserts the brave.  STAUFFACHER. Oh wife! a horrid, ruthless fiend is war, That strikes at once the shepherd and his flock.  GERTRUDE. Whate'er great heaven inflicts we must endure; No heart of noble temper brooks injustice.  STAUFFACHER. This house--thy pride--war, unrelenting war, Will burn it down.  GERTRUDE.           And did I think this heart Enslaved and fettered to the things of earth, With my own hand I'd hurl the kindling torch.  STAUFFACHER. Thou hast faith in human kindness, wife; but war Spares not the tender infant in its cradle.  GERTRUDE. There is a friend to innocence in heaven Look forward, Werner--not behind you, now!  STAUFFACHER. We men may perish bravely, sword in hand; But oh, what fate, my Gertrude, may be thine?  GERTRUDE. None are so weak, but one last choice is left. A spring from yonder bridge, and I am free!  STAUFFACHER (embracing her). Well may he fight for hearth and home that clasps A heart so rare as thine against his own! What are the hosts of emperors to him! Gertrude, farewell! I will to Uri straight. There lives my worthy comrade, Walter Furst, His thoughts and mine upon these times are one."]]]
