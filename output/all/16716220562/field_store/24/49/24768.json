[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/697"],["title","The Light Princess (#3)"],["body","of her misfortune was discovered was as follows.  One summer evening, during the carnival of the country, she had been taken upon the lake by the king and queen, in the royal barge.  They were accompanied by many of the courtiers in a fleet of little boats. In the middle of the lake she wanted to get into the lord chancellor's barge, for his daughter, who was a great favourite with her, was in it with her father.  Now though the old king rarely condescended to make light of his misfortune, yet, Happening on this occasion to be in a particularly good humour, as the barges approached each other, he caught up the princess to throw her into the chancellor's barge.  He lost his balance, however, and, dropping into the bottom of the barge, lost his hold of his daughter; not, however, before imparting to her the downward tendency of his own person, though in a somewhat different direction; for, as the king fell into the boat, she fell into the water.  With a burst of delighted laughter she disappeared in the lake. A cry of horror ascended from the boats.  They had never seen the princess go down before.  Half the men were under water in a moment; but they had all, one after another, come up to the surface again for breath, when--tinkle, tinkle, babble, and gush! came the princess's laugh over the water from far away.  There she was, swimming like a swan.  Nor would she come out for king or queen, chancellor or daughter.  She was perfectly obstinate.  But at the same time she seemed more sedate than usual.  Perhaps that was because a great pleasure spoils laughing.  At all events, after this, the passion of her life was to get into the water, and she was always the better behaved and the more beautiful the more she had of it.  Summer and winter it was quite the same; only she could not stay so long in the water when they had to break the ice to let her in.  Any day, from morning till evening in summer, she might be descried--a streak of white in the blue water--lying as still as the shadow of a cloud, or shooting along like a dolphin; disappearing, and coming up again far off, just where one did not expect her.  She would have been in the lake of a night, too, if she could have had her way; for the balcony of her window overhung a deep pool in it; and through a shallow reedy passage she could have swum out into the wide wet water, and no one would have been any the wiser.  Indeed, when she happened to wake in the moonlight she could hardly resist the temptation.  But there was the sad difficulty of getting into it.  She had as great a dread of the air as some children have of the water.  For the slightest gust of wind would blow her away; and a gust might arise in the stillest moment. And if she gave herself a push towards the water and just failed of reaching it, her situation would be dreadfully awkward, irrespective of the wind; for at best there she would have to remain, suspended in her nightgown, till she was seen and angled for by someone from the window.  \"Oh! if I had my gravity,\" thought she, contemplating the water, \"I would flash off this balcony like a long white sea-bird, headlong into the darling wetness.  Heigh-ho!\"  This was the only consideration that made her wish to be like other people.  Another reason for her being fond of the water was that in it alone she enjoyed any freedom.  For she could not walk out without a cortege, consisting in part of a troop of light horse, for fear of the liberties which the wind might take with her.  And the king grew more apprehensive with increasing years, till at last he would not allow her to walk abroad at all without some twenty silken cords fastened to as many parts of her dress, and held by twenty noblemen.  Of course horseback was out of the question.  But she bade good-by to all this ceremony when she got into the water.  And so remarkable were its effects upon her, especially in restoring her for the time to the ordinary human gravity, that Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck agreed in recommending the king to bury her alive for three years; in the hope that, as the water did her so much good, the earth would do her yet more.  But the king had some vulgar prejudices against the experiment, and would not give his consent.  Foiled in this, they yet agreed in another recommendation; which, seeing that one imported his opinions from China and the other from Thibet, was very remarkable indeed.  They argued that, if water of external origin and application could be so efficacious, water from a deeper source might work a perfect cure; in short, that if the poor afflicted princess could by any means be made to cry, she might recover her lost gravity.  But how was this to be brought about?  Therein lay all the difficulty--to meet which the philosophers were not wise enough.  To make the princess cry was as impossible as to make her weigh.  They sent for a professional beggar; commanded him to prepare his most touching oracle of woe; helped him out of the court charade box, to whatever he wanted for dressing up, and promised great rewards in the event of his success.  But it was all in vain.  She listened to the mendicant artist's story, and gazed at his marvellous make up, till she could contain herself no longer, and went into the most undignified contortions for relief, shrieking, positively screeching with laughter.  When she had a little recovered herself, she ordered her attendants to drive him away, and not give him a single copper; whereupon his look of mortified discomfiture wrought her punishment and his revenge, for it sent her into violent hysterics, from which she was with difficulty recovered.  But so anxious was the king that the suggestion should have a fair trial, that he put himself in a rage one day, and, rushing up to her room, gave her an awful whipping.  Yet not a tear would flow.  She looked grave, and her laughing sounded uncommonly like screaming--that was all.  The good old tyrant, though he put on his best gold spectacles to look, could not discover the smallest cloud in the serene blue of her eyes.    9.  Put Me in Again.  It must have been about this time that the son of a king, who lived a thousand miles from Lagobel set out to look for the daughter of a queen.  He travelled far and wide, but as sure as he found a princess, he found some fault in her.  Of course he could not marry a mere woman, however beautiful; and there was no princess to be found worthy of him. Whether the prince was so near perfection that he had a right to demand perfection itself, I cannot pretend to say.  All I know is, that he was a fine, handsome, brave, generous, well-bred, and well-behaved youth, as all princes are.  In his wanderings he had come across some reports about our princess; but as everybody said she was bewitched, he never dreamed that she could bewitch him.  For what indeed could a prince do with a princess that had lost her gravity?  Who could tell what she might not lose next?  She might lose her visibility, or her tangibility; or, in short, the power of making impressions upon the radical sensorium; so that he should never be able to tell whether she was dead or alive.  Of course he made no further inquiries about her.  One day he lost sight of his retinue in a great forest.  These forests are very useful in delivering princes from their courtiers, like a sieve that keeps back the bran. Then the princes get away to follow their fortunes.  In this way they have the advantage of the princesses, who are forced to marry before they have had a bit of fun.  I wish our princesses got lost in a forest sometimes.  One lovely evening, after wandering about for many days, he found that he was approaching the outskirts of this forest; for the trees had got so thin that he could see the sunset through them; and he soon came upon a kind of heath.  Next he came upon signs of human neighbourhood; but by this time it was getting late, and there was nobody in the fields to direct him.  After travelling for another hour, his horse, quite worn out with long labour and lack of food, fell, and was unable to rise again.  So he continued his journey on foot.  At length he entered another wood--not a wild forest, but a civilized wood, through which a footpath led him to the side of a lake.  Along this path the prince pursued his way through the gathering darkness.  Suddenly he paused, and listened. Strange sounds came across the water.  It was, in fact, the princess laughing.  Now there was something odd in her laugh, as I have already hinted; for the hatching of a real hearty laugh requires the incubation of gravity; and perhaps this was how the prince mistook the laughter for screaming.  Looking over the lake, he saw something white in the water; and, in an instant, he had torn off his tunic, kicked off his sandals, and plunged in.  He soon reached the white object, and found that it was a woman.  There was not light enough to show that she was a princess, but quite enough to show that she was a lady, for it does not want much light to see that.  Now I cannot tell how it came about,--whether she pretended to be drowning, or whether he frightened her, or caught her so as to embarrass her,--but certainly he brought her to shore in a fashion ignominious to a swimmer, and more nearly drowned than she had ever expected to be; for the water had got into her throat as often as she had tried to speak.  At the place to which he bore her, the bank was only a foot or two above the water; so he gave her a strong lift out of the water, to lay her on the bank.  But, her gravitation ceasing the moment she left the water, away she went up into the air, scolding and screaming.  \"You naughty, naughty, NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY man!\" she cried.  No one had ever succeeded in putting her into a passion before.--When the prince saw her ascend, he thought he must have been bewitched, and have mistaken a great swan for a lady.  But the princess caught hold of the topmost cone upon a lofty fir."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/697"],["title","The Light Princess (#4)"],["body","came off; but she caught at another; and, in fact, stopped herself by gathering cones, dropping them as the stalks gave way.  The prince, meantime, stood in the water, staring, and forgetting to get out.  But the princess disappearing, he scrambled on shore, and went in the direction of the tree.  There he found her climbing down one of the branches towards the stem.  But in the darkness of the wood, the prince continued in some bewilderment as to what the phenomenon could be; until, reaching the ground, and seeing him standing there, she caught hold of him, and said,--  \"I'll tell papa.\"  \"Oh no, you won't!\" returned the prince.  \"Yes, I will,\" she persisted.  \"What business had you to pull me down out of the water, and throw me to the bottom of the air?  I never did you any harm.\"  \"Pardon me.  I did not mean to hurt you.\"  \"I don't believe you have any brains; and that is a worse loss than your wretched gravity.  I pity you.\"  The prince now saw that he had come upon the bewitched princess, and had already offended her.  But before he could think what to say next, she burst out angrily, giving a stamp with her foot that would have sent her aloft again but for the hold she had of his arm,--  \"Put me up directly.\"  \"Put you up where, you beauty?\" asked the prince.  He had fallen in love with her almost, already; for her anger made her more charming than any one else had ever beheld her; and, as far as he could see, which certainly was not far, she had not a single fault about her, except, of course, that she had not any gravity.  No prince, however, would judge of a princess by weight.  The loveliness of her foot he would hardly estimate by the depth of the impression it could make in mud.  \"Put you up where, you beauty?\" asked the prince.  \"In the water, you stupid!\" answered the princess.  \"Come, then,\" said the prince.  The condition of her dress, increasing her usual difficulty in walking, compelled her to cling to him; and he could hardly persuade himself that he was not in a delightful dream, notwithstanding the torrent of musical abuse with which she overwhelmed him.  The prince being therefore in no hurry, they came upon the lake at quite another part, where the bank was twenty-five feet high at least; and when they had reached the edge, he turned towards the princess, and said,--  \"How am I to put you in?\" \"That is your business,\" she answered, quite snappishly.  \"You took me out--put me in again.\"  \"Very well,\" said the prince; and, catching her up in his arms, he sprang with her from the rock.  The princess had just time to give one delighted shriek of laughter before the water closed over them.  When they came to the surface, she found that, for a moment or two, she could not even laugh, for she had gone down with such a rush, that it was with difficulty she recovered her breath.  The instant they reached the surface--  \"How do you like falling in?\" said the prince.  After some effort the princess panted out,--  \"Is that what you call FALLING IN?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the prince, \"I should think it a very tolerable specimen.\"  \"It seemed to me like going up,\" rejoined she.  \"My feeling was certainly one of elevation too,\" the prince conceded.  The princess did not appear to understand him, for she retorted his question:--  \"How do YOU like falling in?\" said the princess.  \"Beyond everything,\" answered he; \"for I have fallen in with the only perfect creature I ever saw.\"  \"No more of that: I am tired of it,\" said the princess.  Perhaps she shared her father's aversion to punning.  \"Don't you like falling in then?\" said the prince.  \"It is the most delightful fun I ever had in my life,\" answered she. \"I never fell before.  I wish I could learn.  To think I am the only person in my father's kingdom that can't fall!\"  Here the poor princess looked almost sad.  \"I shall be most happy to fall in with you any time you like,\" said the prince, devotedly.  \"Thank you.  I don't know.  Perhaps it would not be proper.  But I don't care.  At all events, as we have fallen in, let us have a swim together.\"  \"With all my heart,\" responded the prince.  And away they went, swimming, and diving, and floating, until at last they heard cries along the shore, and saw lights glancing in all directions.  It was now quite late, and there was no moon.  \"I must go home,\" said the princess.  \"I am very sorry, for this is delightful.\"  \"So am I,\" returned the prince.  \"But I am glad I haven't a home to go to--at least, I don't exactly know where it is.\"  \"I wish I hadn't one either,\" rejoined the princess; \"it is so stupid! I have a great mind,\" she continued, \"to play them all a trick.  Why couldn't they leave me alone?  They won't trust me in the lake for a single night!--You see where that green light is burning?  That is the window of my room.  Now if you would just swim there with me very quietly, and when we are all but under the balcony, give me such a push--up you call it-as you did a little while ago, I should be able to catch hold of the balcony, and get in at the window; and then they may look for me till to-morrow morning!\"  \"With more obedience than pleasure,\" said the prince, gallantly; and away they swam, very gently.  \"Will you be in the lake to-morrow night?\" the prince ventured to ask.  \"To be sure I will.  I don't think so.  Perhaps,\" was the princess's somewhat strange answer.  But the prince was intelligent enough not to press her further; and merely whispered, as he gave her the parting lift, \"Don't tell.\"  The only answer the princess returned was a roguish look.  She was already a yard above his head.  The look seemed to say, \"Never fear. It is too good fun to spoil that way.\"  So perfectly like other people had she been in the water, that even yet the prince could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw her ascend slowly, grasp the balcony, and disappear through the window.  He turned, almost expecting to see her still by his side.  But he was alone in the water.  So he swam away quietly, and watched the lights roving about the shore for hours after the princess was safe in her chamber.  As soon as they disappeared, he landed in search of his tunic and sword, and, after some trouble, found them again.  Then he made the best of his way round the lake to the other side.  There the wood was wilder, and the shore steeper-rising more immediately towards the mountains which surrounded the lake on all sides, and kept sending it messages of silvery streams from morning to night, and all night long. He soon found a spot whence he could see the green light in the princess's room, and where, even in the broad daylight, he would be in no danger of being discovered from the opposite shore.  It was a sort of cave in the rock, where he provided himself a bed of withered leaves, and lay down too tired for hunger to keep him awake.  All night long he dreamed that he was swimming with the princess.    10.  Look at the Moon.  Early the next morning the prince set out to look for something to eat, which he soon found at a forester's hut, where for many following days he was supplied with all that a brave prince could consider necessary. And having plenty to keep him alive for the present, he would not think of wants not yet in existence.  Whenever Care intruded, this prince always bowed him out in the most princely manner.  When he returned from his breakfast to his watch-cave, he saw the princess already floating about in the lake, attended by the king and queen whom he knew by their crowns--and a great company in lovely little boats, with canopies of all the colours of the rainbow, and flags and streamers of a great many more.  It was a very bright day, and soon the prince, burned up with the heat, began to long for the cold water and the cool princess.  But he had to endure till twilight; for the boats had provisions on board, and it was not till the sun went down that the gay party began to vanish.  Boat after boat drew away to the shore, following that of the king and queen, till only one, apparently the princess's own boat, remained.  But she did not want to go home even yet, and the prince thought he saw her order the boat to the shore without her.  At all events, it rowed away; and now, of all the radiant company, only one white speck remained.  Then the prince began to sing. And this is what he sung:--    \"Lady fair,   Swan-white,   Lift thine eyes,   Banish night   By the might   Of thine eyes.    Snowy arms,   Oars of snow,   Oar her hither,   Plashing low.   Soft and slow,   Oar her hither.    Stream behind her   O'er the lake,   Radiant whiteness!   In her wake   Following, following for her sake.   Radiant whiteness!    Cling about her,   Waters blue;   Part not from her,   But renew   Cold and true   Kisses round her.    Lap me round,   Waters sad,   That have left her.   Make me glad,   For ye had   Kissed her ere ye left her.\"  Before he had finished his song, the princess was just under the place where he sat, and looking up to find him.  Her ears had led her truly.  \"Would you like a fall, princess?\" said the prince, looking down.  \"Ah! there you are!  Yes, if you please, prince,\" said the princess, looking up.  \"How do you know I am a prince, princess?\" said the prince.  \"Because you are a very nice young man, prince,\" said the princess.  \"Come up then, princess.\"  \"Fetch me, prince.\"  The prince took off his scarf, then his sword-belt, then his tunic, and tied them all together, and let them down.  But the line was far too short.  He unwound his turban, and added it to the rest, when it was all but long enough; and his purse completed it.  The princess just managed to lay hold of the knot of money, and was beside him in a moment.  This rock was much higher than the other, and the splash and the dive were tremendous.  The princess was in ecstasies of delight, and their swim was delicious.  Night after night they met, and swam about in the dark clear lake; where such was the prince's gladness, that (whethe"]]]
