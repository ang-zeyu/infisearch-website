Hey?\" He turned up his head and looked at her, and Polly's hand shook worse than ever when the little snapping eyes were full on her face, and she had all she could do to keep from running out of the room and up on deck where she could breathe freely.  \"I am so sorry,\" she managed to gasp, feeling if she didn't say something, she should surely run. \"Does your head feel better?\" And she smoothed his hot forehead gently just as Phronsie always did Grandpapa's when it ached. And when she thought of Phronsie, then it was all she could do to keep the tears back. Where could she be? And would Jasper never come back?  And just then in ran Tom with a great clatter, complaining noisily every step of the way. \"I told you you'd much better get off to your stateroom, Granddad!\" he exclaimed. \"Here, I'll help you down there.\" And he laid a hasty hand on the feeble old arm.  \"I think he is sick,\" said Polly, gently. Jasper came hurrying in. \"Phronsie is all right,\" he had time to whisper to Polly.  \"Oh, Jasper!\" the colour rushed into her cheek that had turned quite white. \"I am so glad.\"  \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Tom, abruptly. \"It's only one of his crotchets. You don't know; he gets up plenty of 'em on occasion.\"  \"What did you want a sovereign for?\" asked the old gentleman, querulously, taking his sharp little eyes off Polly to fasten them on his grandson's face. \"Say, I _will_ know.\"  \"And I say no matter,\" retorted Tom, roughly. \"And you ought to come down to your state-room where you belong. Come, Granddad!\" And he tried again to lay hold of his arm. But the little old gentleman sank back, and looked up at Polly again. \"I think I'll stay here,\" he said.  \"I say,\" began the boy, in an embarrassed way, \"this is dreadfully rough on you,\" and then he looked away from Polly to Jasper. \"And if you knew him as well as I do,\" nodding his head at his Grandfather, \"you wouldn't get in such a funk.\"  Polly was busy smoothing the hot forehead under the white hair, and appeared not to notice a word he said.  \"Your Grandfather really appears ill,\" said Jasper. \"And the doctor might give him something to help him.\"  Tom burst into a short laugh and kicked his heel against the table. \"Hoh! hoh! I say, you don't know him; oh, what muffs you are! He's well enough, only he's determined not to go to his state-room where he belongs, but to kick up a row here.\"  \"Very well,\" said Jasper, coolly, \"since you are determined to do nothing for his relief, I shall take it upon myself to summon the doctor.\" He stepped to a table a bit further off, and touched the electric button back of it.  \"Here, don't do that,\" remonstrated Tom, springing forward. But it was too late, and the steward who attended to calls on the library stepped in.  \"It isn't the hour for giving out books,\" he began.  Tom was stamping his foot impatiently, and scowling at Jasper, alternately casting longing glances out the nearest port-hole.  \"It isn't books we want,\" said Jasper, quickly, \"but this old gentleman\"--whose head was now heavily sunken on his breast, and whose cheek was quite white--\"appears to be very ill, and to need the doctor.\"  \"Is that so?\" The steward leaned over and peered into the old face. \"Well, he doesn't look just right, and that's a fact. Is he your father?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said Jasper, quickly, \"I don't know who he is. But, do hurry, for he's sick, and needs the doctor at once.\"  \"I'll get Dr. Jones.\" Off ran the steward toward the surgeon's cabin.  \"See what you've done,\" cried Tom, in a towering passion. \"Kicked up a pretty mess--when I tell you I've seen my Grandfather just as bad a hundred times.\"  Jasper made no reply, and Polly continued to stroke gently the poor head.  \"Well--well--well!\" exclaimed Mr. King, coming in, \"to be sure, it's very stupid in me not to think of looking in the library for both of you before. O dear me--bless me!\" And he came to a dead stop of astonishment.  \"Father,\" cried Jasper, \"this poor man seems very ill.\"  \"Oh, yes,\" breathed Polly, pitifully, \"he really is, Grandpapa.\" And she put out her hand to seize one of Mr. King's. \"And Jasper has sent for the doctor.\"  \"And none too soon, I should say,\" remarked Mr. King, grimly, with a keen glance into the old man's face. \"Raise his feet a little higher, Jasper; put a pillow under them; there, that's it. Well, the doctor should be hurried up.\" He glanced quickly around. \"Here, you boy,\" seeing Tom, \"run as you never have run before, and tell the doctor to come quickly.\"  \"There isn't any need,\" began Tom.  \"Do you _go_!\" commanded Mr. King, pointing to the door. And Tom went.  \"Father, that boy is his grandson,\" said Jasper, pointing to the sick man.  Mr. King stared into Jasper's face, unable to make a reply.  \"He is,\" declared Polly. \"Oh, Grandpapa, he really is!\" Then she buried her flushed face up against Mr. King's arm.  \"There is no need to waste words,\" said Mr. King, finding his tongue. \"There, there, Polly, child,\" fondling her brown head, \"don't feel badly. I'm sure you've done all you could.\"  \"'Twas Jasper; he did it all--I couldn't do anything,\" said Polly.  \"Oh, Polly, you did everything,\" protested Jasper.  \"Yes, yes, I know, you both did,\" said Mr. King. \"Well, here's the doctor, thank the Lord!\"  And then when nobody wanted them, the library seemed to be full of people, and the news spreading out to the decks, many of the passengers got out of their steamer chairs, and tried to swarm into the two doorways.  Tom, who never knew how he summoned Dr. Jones, being chiefly occupied in astonishment at finding that he obeyed a command from a perfect stranger, did not come back to the library, but kept himself with the same amazed expression on his face, idly kicking his heels in a quiet corner of the deck near by. He never thought of such a thing as being worried over his Grandfather, for he couldn't remember when the old gentleman hadn't been subject to nervous attacks; but somehow since \"a row,\" as he expressed it, \"had been kicked up,\" it was just as well to stay in the vicinity and see the end of it. But he wasn't going inside--no, not he!  After awhile, Tom was just beginning to yawn, and to feel that no one could expect him to waste time like that, and probably his Grandfather was going to sleep it out on the sofa, and the stupid doctor would find that there was nothing the matter, only the old man was nervous. \"And I'm going back to the fellows,\" decided Tom, shaking his long legs.  \"Oh, here you are!\" cried Jasper, running up to him. \"Come quickly,\" seizing his arm.  \"Hey, here, what are you about?\" roared Tom at him, shaking off the hand.  \"You must excuse me for wasting no ceremony,\" said Jasper, sternly. It struck Tom that he looked very much like the old gentleman who had told him to _go!_ \"Your Grandfather is very ill; something is the matter with his heart, and the doctor has sent me for you. He says he may not live an hour.\" It was necessary to tell the whole of the dreadful truth, for Tom was still staring at him in defiance.     II  TWO ENGLISH FRIENDS   \"I don't want you,\" muttered the old gentleman, feebly, turning his head away from Tom, and then he set his lips tightly together. But he held to Polly's hand.  \"You would better go out,\" Dr. Jones nodded to Tom. \"It excites him.\"  The second time Tom was told to go. He stood quite still. \"He's my Grandfather!\" he blurted out.  \"Can't help it,\" said Dr. Jones, curtly; \"he's my patient. So I tell you again it is imperative that you leave this room.\" Then he turned back to his work of making the sick man comfortable without taking any more notice of the boy.  Tom gave a good long look at as much of his Grandfather's face as he could see, then slunk out, in a dazed condition, trying to make himself as small as possible. Jasper found him a half hour afterward, hanging over the rail away from curious eyes, his head buried on his arms.  \"I thought you'd like to know that your Grandfather is better,\" said Jasper, touching the bent shoulder.  \"Get away, will you?\" growled Tom, kicking out his leg, unmindful where it struck.  \"And the doctor has gotten him into his state-room, and he is as comfortable as he could be made.\" Jasper didn't add that Dr. Jones had asked him to come back, and that the old man was still insisting that Polly should hold his hand.  \"In that case,\" declared Tom, suddenly twitching up his head, \"I will go down there.\" His face was so drawn that Jasper started, and then looked away over the sea, and did not appear to notice the clenched hand down by the boy's side.  \"I--I--didn't know he was sick.\" Tom brought it out in gusts, and his face worked worse than ever in his efforts not to show his distress. The only thing he could do was to double up his hand tighter than ever, as he tried to keep it back of him.  \"I understand,\" nodded Jasper, still looking off over the blue water.  \"And now I'll go down,\" said Tom, drawing a long breath and starting off. Oh! and Dr. Jones had said the last thing to Jasper as he rushed off with the good news to Tom, \"On no account let that boy see his Grandfather. I won't answer for the consequences if you do.\"  \"See here,\" Jasper tore his gaze off from the shimmering water. \"The doctor doesn't--doesn't think you ought to see your Grandfather now.\"  \"Hey!\" cried Tom, his drawn lips flying open, and his big blue eyes distending in anger. \"He's my Grandfather. I rather think I shall do as I've a mind to,\" and he plunged off.  \"Tom!\" Jasper took long steps after him. \"Beg your pardon, this is no time for thinking of anything but your Grandfather's life. Dr. Jones said you were not to see him at present.\" The truth must be told, for in another moment"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6987"],["title","Five Little Peppers Abroad (#2)"],["body","boy would have been off on the wings of the wind.  \"And do you think that I will mind in the least what that beastly doctor says?\" cried Tom, getting redder and redder in the face, his rage was so great. \"Hoh! no, sir.\"  \"Then your Grandfather's life will be paid as a sacrifice,\" said Jasper calmly. And he stood quite still; and surveyed the boy before him.  Neither spoke. It seemed to Jasper an age that they stood there in silence. At last Tom wavered, put out his hand unsteadily, leaned against a steamer chair, and turned his face away.  \"Let us do a bit of a turn on the deck,\" said Jasper, suddenly, overcoming by a mighty effort his repugnance to the idea.  Tom shook his head, and swallowed hard.  \"Oh, yes,\" said Jasper, summoning all the cheerfulness he could muster to his aid. \"Come, it's the very thing to do, if you really want to help your Grandfather.\"  Tom raised his head and looked at him. \"I never supposed the old man was sick,\" he said brokenly, and down went his head again, this time upon his hands, which were grasping the top of the chair.  \"I don't believe you did,\" answered Jasper. \"But come, Tom, let's walk around the deck; we can talk just as well meanwhile.\"  Two or three young men, with cigarettes in their mouths, came sauntering up. \"Tom Selwyn, you're a pretty fellow--\"  Tom raised his head and looked at them defiantly.  \"To give us the slip like this,\" cried one, with a sneer, in which the others joined, with a curious look at Jasper.  \"Well, come on now,\" said one. \"Yes--yes--come along,\" said another; \"we've waited long enough for you to get back.\"  \"I'm not coming,\" declared Tom, shortly.  \"Not coming back? Well--\" One of the young men said something under his breath, and the first speaker turned on his heel, tossing his cigarette over the railing.  \"No,\" said Tom, \"I'm not coming. Did you hear me?\"  \"I believe I had that pleasure,\" said the last named, \"as I am not deaf. Come on, fellows; our little boy has got to wait on his Grandpappy. Good-by, kid!\" He snapped his fingers; the other two laughed derisively, and sauntered off down the deck as they came.  Tom shook with passion. \"I'd like to walk,\" he said, drawing a long breath, and setting off unsteadily.  \"All right,\" said Jasper, falling into step beside him.  Meantime the old gentleman, in his large handsome state-room, showed no sign of returning to the consciousness that had come back for a brief moment. And he held to Polly's hand so tightly, as she sat at the head of the berth, that there was no chance of withdrawing her fingers had she so desired. And Father Fisher with whom Dr. Jones had of course made acquaintance, before the steamer fairly sailed, sat there keeping watch too, in a professional way, the ship's doctor having called him in consultation over the case. And Phronsie, who had been in deep penitence because she had wandered off from the library with another little girl, to gaze over the railing upon the steerage children below, thereby missing Polly, was in such woe over it all that she was allowed to cuddle up against Polly's side and hold her other hand. And there she sat as still as a mouse, hardly daring to breathe. And Mr. King, feeling as if, after all, the case was pretty much under his supervision, came softly in at intervals to see that all was well, and that the dreadful boy was kept out.  And the passengers all drifted back to their steamer chairs, glad of some new topic to discuss, for the gossip they had brought on board was threadbare now, as they were two days at sea. And the steamer sailed over the blue water that softly lapped the stout vessel's side, careless of the battle that had been waged for a life, even then holding by slender threads. And Fanny Vanderburgh, whose grandfather was a contemporary in the old business days in New York with Mr. King, and who sat with her mother at the next table to the King party, spent most of her time running to Mrs. Pepper's state-room, or interviewing any one who would be able to give her the slightest encouragement as to when she could claim Polly Pepper.  \"O dear me!\" Fanny cried, on one such occasion, when she happened to run across Jasper. \"I've been down to No. 45 four times this morning, and there's nobody there but that stupid Matilda, and she doesn't know or won't tell when Polly will get through reading to that tiresome old man. And they won't let me go to his state-room. Mrs. Fisher and your father are there, too, or I'd get them to make Polly come out on deck. We all want her for a game of shuffle-board.\"  Jasper sighed. So did he long for a game of shuffle-board. Then he brought himself up, and said as brightly as he could: \"Mr. Selwyn begs Polly to stay, and won't have any one else read to him, Miss Vanderburgh, so I don't see as it can be helped. He's been very sick, you know.\"  Fanny Vanderburgh beat the toe of her boot on the deck floor. \"It's a perfect shame. And that horrible old man, he's so seedy and common--just think of it--and spoiling all our fun!\"  Jasper looked off over the sea, and said nothing.  \"As for that dreadful boy, his grandson, I think he's a boor. Goodness me--I hope nobody will introduce him. I'm sure I never'll recognise him afterward.\"  Jasper turned uneasily. \"Please, Mr. King, do make Polly listen to reason,\" begged Fanny. \"There isn't another girl on board I care to go with--at least not in the way I would with her. The Griswolds are well enough to play games with, and all that; but you know what I mean. Do make her come out with us this morning, and listen to reason,\" she repeated, winding up helplessly.  \"But I think she is just right,\" said Jasper, stoutly.  \"Right!\" cried Fanny, explosively; \"oh, how can you say so, Mr. Jasper! Why, she is losing just every bit of the fun.\"  \"I know it,\" said Jasper, with a twinge at the thought. \"Well, there is nothing more to be said or done, Miss Vanderburgh, since Polly has decided the matter. Only I want you to remember that I think she is just right about it.\"  Fanny Vanderburgh pouted her pretty lips in vexation. \"At least, don't try to get that dreadful boy into our own set to play games,\" she cried venomously, \"for I won't speak to him. He's a perfect boor. 'Twas only yesterday he brushed by me like a clumsy elephant, and knocked my book out of my hand, and never even picked it up. Think of that, Mr. King!\"  \"I know--that was dreadful,\" assented Jasper, in dismay at the obstacle to the plan he had formed in his own mind, to do that very thing he was now being warned against. \"But you see, Miss Vanderburgh, he's all upset by his Grandfather's sickness.\"  \"And I should think he would be,\" cried Fanny Vanderburgh, with spirit. \"Mrs. Griswold says she's heard him domineering over the old man, and then his Grandfather would snarl and scold like everything. She has the next state-room, you know. I don't see how those Selwyns can afford such a nice cabin,\" continued Fanny, her aristocratic nose in the air, \"they look so poor. Anyway that boy is a perfect beast, Mr. King.\"  \"He's very different now,\" said Jasper, quickly. \"He had no idea his Grandfather was so poorly. Now I'll tell you, Miss Vanderburgh,\" Jasper turned sharply around on his heel so that he faced her. It was necessary with a girl like her to state plainly what he had to say, and to keep to it. \"I am going to ask Tom Selwyn to play games with all us young people. If it distresses you, or any one else, so that you cannot join, of course I will withdraw, and I know Polly will, and we will get up another circle that will play with him.\"  It was almost impossible to keep from laughing at Fanny's face, but Jasper was very grave as he waited for an answer. \"O dear me, Mr. Jasper,\" she cried, \"haven't I told you I don't really care for any one on board but Polly Pepper, and Mamma doesn't want me to mix up much with those Griswolds?\" She lowered her voice and glanced over her shoulder. \"It would make it so awkward if they should be much in New York, and we should meet. So of course I've got to do as Polly and you do. Don't you see?--it's awfully hard on me, though,\" and she clasped her hands in vexation.  \"Very well, then,\" said Jasper; \"now that's decided. And seeing it is, why the next thing to do, is to bring Tom down, and we'll get up a game of shuffle-board at once. He's not needed by his Grandfather now.\" He didn't think it necessary to add, \"for the old gentleman won't see him, and Tom is forbidden the room by the doctor.\"  Fanny's aristocratic nose went up in alarm, and her whole face was overspread with dismay. It was one thing to anticipate evil, and quite another to find it precipitated upon one. \"I--I don't--believe I can play this morning, Mr. Jasper,\" she began hurriedly, for the first time in her young life finding herself actually embarrassed. She was even twisting her fingers.  \"Very well,\" said Jasper, coolly, \"then I understand that you will not play with us at any time, for, as we begin to-day, we shall keep on. I will set about getting up another party at once.\" He touched his yacht cap lightly, and turned off.  \"I'll go right down on the lower deck with you now.\" Fanny ran after him, her little boot heels clicking excitedly on the hard floor. \"The steward has marked it all for us. I got him to, while I ran to find Polly so as to engage the place,\" she added breathlessly.  \"That's fine,\" said Jasper, a smile breaking over the gloom on his face; \"now we'll have a prime game, Miss Vanderburgh.\"  Fanny swallowed hard the lump in her throat, and tried to look pleasant. \"Do you go and collect the Griswolds,\" cried Jasper, radiantly, \"and I'll be back with Tom,\" and he plunged off. It was all done in a minute. And the thing that had been worrying him--how to get Tom into good shape, and to keep him there--seemed fixed in the best way possible. But Tom wouldn't go. Nothing that Jasper could do or say would move him out of the gloom into which he was cast, and at last Jasper ran down for a hurried"]]]
