Equality of territory or of resources there, of course, cannot be; nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves.  But no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights.  Mankind is looking now for freedom of life, not for equipoises of power.  And there is a deeper thing involved than even equality of rights among organized nations.  No peace can last, or ought to last, which does not recognize and accept the principle that Governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed, and that no right anywhere exists to hand people about from sovereignty to sovereignty as if they were property.  I take it for granted, for instance, if I may venture upon a single example, that statesmen everywhere are agreed that there should be a united, independent, and autonomous Poland, and that henceforth inviolable security of life, of worship, and of industrial and social development should be guaranteed to all peoples who have lived hitherto under the power of Governments devoted to a faith and purpose hostile to their own.  I speak of this, not because of any desire to exalt an abstract political principle which has always been held very dear by those who have sought to build up liberty in America, but for the same reason that I have spoken of the other conditions of peace which seem to me clearly indispensable--because I wish frankly to uncover realities.   CRUSHED PEOPLES WILL REVOLT  Any peace which does not recognize and accept this principle will inevitably be upset.  It will not rest upon the affections or the convictions of mankind.  The ferment of spirit of whole populations will fight subtly and constantly against it, and all the world will sympathize.  The world can be at peace only if its life is stable, and there can be no stability where the will is in rebellion, where there is not tranquillity of spirit and a sense of justice, of freedom, and of right.  So far as practicable, moreover, every great people now struggling toward a full development of its resources and of its powers should be assured a direct outlet to the great highways of the sea.  Where this cannot be done by the cession of territory, it can no doubt be done by the neutralization of direct rights of way under the general guarantee which will assure the peace itself.  With a right comity of arrangement no nation need be shut away from free access to the open paths of the world's commerce.  And the paths of the sea must alike in law and in fact be free. The freedom of the seas is the sine qua non of peace, equality, and cooperation.  No doubt a somewhat radical reconsideration of many of the rules of international practice hitherto sought to be established may be necessary in order to make the seas indeed free and common in practically all circumstances for the use of mankind, but the motive for such changes is convincing and compelling.  There can be no trust or intimacy between the peoples of the world without them.  The free, constant, unthreatened intercourse of nations is an essential part of the process of peace and of development.  It need not be difficult to define or to secure the freedom of the seas if the Governments of the world sincerely desire to come to an agreement concerning it.   REQUIRES LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS  It is a problem closely connected with the limitation of naval armaments and the cooperation of the navies of the world in keeping the seas at once free and safe.  And the question of limiting naval armaments opens the wider and perhaps more difficult question of the limitation of armies and of all programs of military preparation.  Difficult and delicate as these questions are, they must be faced with the utmost candor and decided in a spirit of real accommodation if peace is to come with healing in its wings and come to stay.  Peace cannot be had without concession and sacrifice.  There can be no sense of safety and equality among the nations if great preponderating armies are henceforth to continue here and there to be built up and maintained.  The statesmen of the world must plan for peace, and nations must adjust and accommodate their policy to it as they have planned for war and made ready for pitiless contest and rivalry.  The question of armaments, whether on land or sea, is the most immediately and intensely practical question connected with the future fortunes of nations and of mankind.  I have spoken upon these great matters without reserve and with the utmost explicitness because it has seemed to me to be necessary if the world's yearning desire for peace was anywhere to find free voice and utterance.  Perhaps I am the only person in high authority among all the peoples of the world who is at liberty to speak and hold nothing back.  I am speaking as an individual, and yet I am speaking also, of course, as the responsible head of a great Government, and I feel confident that I have said what the people of the United States would wish me to say.  May I not add that I hope and believe that I am in effect speaking for liberals and friends of humanity in every nation and of every program of liberty?  I would fain believe that I am speaking for the silent mass of mankind everywhere who have as yet had no place or opportunity to speak their real hearts out concerning the death and ruin they see to have come already upon the persons and the homes they hold most dear.   SEES WORLD-WIDE MONROE DOCTRINE  And in holding out the expectation that the people and Government of the United States will join the other civilized nations of the world in guaranteeing the permanence of peace upon such terms as I have named, I speak with the greater boldness and confidence because it is clear to every man who can think that there is in this promise no breach in either our traditions or our policy as a nation, but a fulfilment, rather, of all that we have professed or striven for.  I am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world; that no nation should seek to extend its policy over any other nation or people, but that every people should be left free to determine its own policy, its own way of development, unhindered, unthreatened, unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.  I am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power, catch them in a net of intrigue and selfish rivalry, and disturb their own affairs with influences intruded from without.  There is no entangling alliance in a concert of power.  When all unite to act in the same sense and with the same purpose, all act in the common interest and are free to live their own lives under a common protection.  I am proposing government by the consent of the governed; that freedom of the seas which in international conference after conference representatives of the United States have urged with the eloquence of those who are the convinced disciples of liberty; and that moderation of armaments which makes of armies and navies a power for order merely, not an instrument of aggression or of selfish violence.  These are American principles, American policies.  We can stand for no others.  And they are also the principles and policies of forward-looking men and women everywhere, of every modern nation, of every enlightened community.  They are the principles of mankind, and must prevail.     II  THE SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH GERMANY  Message to the Congress February 3, 1917    Gentlemen of the Congress:  The Imperial German Government, on the 31st of January, announced to this Government and to the Governments of the other neutral nations that on and after the first day of February, the present month, it would adopt a policy with regard to the use of submarines against all shipping seeking to pass through certain designated areas of the high seas to which it is clearly my duty to call your attention.  Let me remind the Congress that on the 18th of April last, in view of the sinking on the 24th of March of the cross-Channel passenger-steamer Sussex by a German submarine, without summons or warning, and the consequent loss of the lives of several citizens of the United States who were passengers aboard her, this Government addressed a note to the Imperial German Government in which it made the following declaration:      If it is still the purpose of the Imperial German Government to     prosecute relentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels     of commerce by the use of submarines without regard to what the     Government of the United States must consider the sacred and     indisputable rules of international law and the universally     recognized dictates of humanity, the Government of the United States     is at last forced to the conclusion that there is but one course it     can pursue.  Unless the German Government should now immediately     declare and effect an abandonment of its present methods of submarine     warfare against passenger and freight-carrying vessels the Government     of the United States can have no choice but to sever diplomatic     relations with the German Empire altogether.   GERMANY'S U-BOAT PLEDGE  In reply to this declaration the German Government gave this Government the following assurances:      The German Government is prepared to do its utmost to confine the     operations of war for the rest of its duration to the fighting     forces of the belligerents, thereby insuring the freedom of the seas,     a principle upon which the German Government believes, now as before,     to be in agreement with the Government of the United States.      The German Government, guided by this idea, notifies the Government     of the United States that the German naval forces have received the     following orders:      In accordance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6870"],["title","Why We Are at War : Messages to the Congress January to April 1917 (#2)"],["body","the general principles of visit and search and     destruction of merchant vessels recognized by international law,     such vessels, both within and without the area declared as naval     war zone, shall not be sunk without warning and without saving     human lives, unless these ships attempt to escape or offer resistance.      But neutrals cannot expect that Germany, forced to fight for her     existence, shall, for the sake of neutral interest, restrict the use     of an effective weapon if her enemy is permitted to continue to apply     at will methods of warfare violating the rules of international law.     Such a demand would be incompatible with the character of neutrality,     and the German Government is convinced that the Government of the     United States does not think of making such a demand, knowing that     the Government of the United States has repeatedly declared that it     is determined to restore the principle of the freedom of the seas     from whatever quarter it has been violated.   HOW THE UNITED STATES REPLIED  To this the Government of the United States replied on the 8th of May, accepting, of course, the assurances given, but adding:      The Government of the United States feels it necessary to state that     it takes it for granted that the Imperial German Government does not     intend to imply that the maintenance of its newly announced policy     is in any way contingent upon the course or result of diplomatic     negotiations between the Government of the United States and any     other belligerent Government, notwithstanding the fact that certain     passages in the Imperial Government's note of the 4th instant might     appear to be susceptible to that construction.  In order, however,     to avoid any possible misunderstanding, the Government of the United     States notifies the Imperial Government that it cannot for a moment     entertain, much less discuss, a suggestion that respect by German     naval authorities for the rights of citizens of the United States     upon the high seas should in any way or in the slightest degree be     made contingent upon the conduct of any other Government affecting     the rights of neutrals and non-combatants.  Responsibility in such     matters is single, not joint; absolute, not relative.  To this note of the 8th of May the Imperial German Government made no reply.  On the 31st of January, the Wednesday of the present week, the German Ambassador handed to the Secretary of State, along with a formal note, a memorandum which contains the following statement:   GERMANY'S NEW POLICY      The Imperial Government, therefore, does not doubt that the Government     of the United States will understand the situation thus forced upon     Germany by the Entente Allies' brutal methods of war and by their     determination to destroy the Central Powers, and that the Government     of the United States will further realize that the now openly     disclosed intentions of the Entente Allies give back to Germany the     freedom of action which she reserved in her note addressed to the     Government of the United States on May 4, 1916.      Under these circumstances Germany will meet the illegal measures     of her enemies by forcibly preventing, after February 1, 1917,     in a zone around Great Britain, France, Italy, and in the eastern     Mediterranean all navigation, that of neutrals included, from and     to France, etc.  All ships met within the zone will be sunk.  I think that you will agree with me that, in view of this declaration, which suddenly and without prior intimation of any kind deliberately withdraws the solemn assurance given in the Imperial Government's note of the 4th of May, 1916, this Government has no alternative consistent with the dignity and honor of the United States but to take the course which, in its note of the 18th of April, 1916, it announced that it would take in the event that the German Government did not declare and effect an abandonment of the methods of submarine warfare which it was then employing and to which it now purposes again to resort.   ALL RELATIONS BROKEN OFF  I have, therefore, directed the Secretary of State to announce to his Excellency the German ambassador that all diplomatic relations between the United States and the German Empire are severed, and that the American ambassador at Berlin will immediately be withdrawn, and, in accordance with this decision, to hand to his Excellency his passports.  Notwithstanding this unexpected action of the German Government, this sudden and deeply deplorable renunciation of its assurances, given this Government at one of the most critical moments of tension in the relations of the two Governments, I refuse to believe that it is the intention of the German authorities to do in fact what they have warned us they will feel at liberty to do.  I cannot bring myself to believe that they will indeed pay no regard to the ancient friendship between their people and our own or to the solemn obligations which have been exchanged between them and destroy American ships and take the lives of American citizens in the wilful prosecution of the ruthless naval program they have announced their intention to adopt.  Only actual overt acts on their part can make me believe it even now.   WILL PROTECT AMERICAN RIGHTS  If this inveterate confidence on my part in the sobriety and prudent foresight of their purpose should unhappily prove unfounded, if American ships and American lives should, in fact, be sacrificed by their naval commanders in heedless contravention of the just and reasonable understandings of international law and the obvious dictates of humanity, I shall take the liberty of coming again before the Congress to ask that authority be given me to use any means that may be necessary for the protection of our seamen and our people in the prosecution of their peaceful and legitimate errands on the high seas.  I can do nothing less.  I take it for granted that all neutral Governments will take the same course.  I do not desire any hostile conflict with the Imperial German Government.  We are the sincere friends of the German people and earnestly desire to remain at peace with the Government which speaks for them.  We shall not believe that they are hostile to us until we are obliged to believe it; and we purpose nothing more than the reasonable defense of the undoubted rights of our people.  We wish to serve no selfish ends.  We seek merely to stand true alike in thought and in action to the immemorial principles of our people which I sought to express in my address to the Senate only two weeks ago--seek merely to vindicate our right to liberty and justice and an unmolested life.  These are bases of peace, not war.  God grant we may not be challenged to defend them by acts of wilful injustice on the part of the Government of Germany.     III  REQUEST FOR A GRANT OF POWER  Message to the Congress February 26, 1917    Gentlemen of the Congress:  I have again asked the privilege of addressing you because we are moving through critical times, during which it seems to me to be my duty to keep in close touch with the Houses of Congress so that neither counsel nor action shall run at cross-purposes between us.  On the 3d of February I officially informed you of the sudden and unexpected action of the Imperial German Government in declaring its intention to disregard the promises it had made to this Government in April last and undertake immediate submarine operations against all commerce, whether of belligerents or of neutrals, that should seek to approach Great Britain and Ireland, the Atlantic coasts of Europe, or the harbors of the eastern Mediterranean, and to conduct those operations without regard to the established restrictions of international practice, without regard to any considerations of humanity, even, which might interfere with their object.   AMERICAN COMMERCE SUFFERS, BUT OTHER NEUTRALS FARE WORSE  That policy was forthwith put into practice.  It has now been in active exhibition for nearly four weeks.  Its practical results are not fully disclosed.  The commerce of other neutral nations is suffering severely, but not, perhaps, very much more severely than it was already suffering before the 1st of February, when the new policy of the Imperial Government was put into operation.  We have asked the co-operation of the other neutral Governments to prevent these depredations, but I fear none of them has thought it wise to join us in any common course of action.  Our own commerce has suffered, is suffering, rather in apprehension than in fact, rather because so many of our ships are timidly keeping to their home ports than because American ships have been sunk.  Two American vessels have been sunk, the Housatonic and the Lyman M. Law. The case of the Housatonic, which was carrying foodstuffs consigned to a London firm, was essentially like the case of the Frye, in which, it will be recalled, the German Government admitted its liability for damages, and the lives of the crew, as in the case of the Frye, were safeguarded with reasonable care.   THE RUTHLESS SINKING OF SCHOONER \"LYMAN M. LAW\"  The case of the Law, which was carrying lemon-box staves to Palermo, disclosed a ruthlessness of method which deserves grave condemnation, but was accompanied by no circumstances which might not have been expected at any time in connection with the use of the submarine against merchantmen as the German Government has used it.  In sum, therefore, the situation we find ourselves in with regard to the actual conduct of the German submarine warfare against commerce and its effects upon our own ships and people is substantially the same that it was when I addressed you on the 3d of February, except for the tying up of our shipping in our own ports because of the unwillingness of our ship-owners to risk their vessels at sea without insurance or adequate protection, and the very "]]]
