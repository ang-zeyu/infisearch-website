Where will you find a cooler spot?\"  \"Oh, it's cool enough anywhere! Let's go back,\" she replied, starting to return as she spoke. She saw his excitement, and, being herself a little confused, had no idea of allowing a scene to be precipitated just then. She flitted on before with so light a foot that he did not overtake her until she came to a bank too steep for her to surmount without aid. He sprang up and extended her his hand. Assuming an expression as if she were unconscious who was helping her, she took it, and he drew her up to his side. Then with a sudden, audacious impulse, half hoping she would not be angry, half reckless if she were, he clasped her closely in his arms, and kissed her lips. She gasped, and freed herself.  \"How dared you do such a thing to me?\" she cried.  The big fellow stood before her, sheepish, dogged, contrite, desperate, all in one.  \"I couldn't help it,\" he blurted out. The plea was somehow absurdly simple, and yet rather unanswerable. Angry as she was, she really couldn't think of anything to say, except--  \"You'd better help it,\" with which rather ineffective rebuke she turned away and walked toward the picnic ground. Henry followed in a demoralized frame. His mind was in a ferment. He could not realize what had happened. He could scarcely believe that he had actually done it. He could not conceive how he had dared it. And now what penalty would she inflict? What if she should not forgive him? His soul was dissolved in fears. But, sooth to say, the young lady's actual state of mind was by no means so implacable as he apprehended. She had been ready to be very angry, but the suddenness and depth of his contrition had disarmed her. It took all the force out of her indignation to see that he actually seemed to have a deeper sense of the enormity of his act than she herself had. And when, after they had rejoined the party, she saw that, instead of taking part in the sports, he kept aloof, wandering aimless and disconsolate by himself among the pines, she took compassion on him and sent some one to tell him she wanted him to come and push her in the swing. People had kissed her before. She was not going to leave the first person who had seemed to fully realize the importance of the proceeding to suffer unduly from a susceptibility which did him so much credit. As for Henry, he hardly believed his ears when he heard the summons to attend her. At that the kiss which her rebuke had turned cold on his lips began to glow afresh, and for the first time he tasted its exceeding sweetness; for her calling to him seemed to ratify and consent to it. There were others standing about as he came up to where Madeline sat in the swing, and he was silent, for he could not talk of indifferent things.  With what a fresh charm, with what new sweet suggestions of complaisance that kiss had invested every line and curve of her, from hat-plume to boot-tip! A delicious tremulous sense of proprietorship tinged his every thought of her. He touched the swing-rope as fondly as if it were an electric chain that could communicate the caress to her. Tom Longman, having done all the work that offered itself, had been wandering about in a state of acute embarrassment, not daring to join himself to any of the groups, much less accost a young lady who might be alone. As he drifted near the swing, Madeline said to Henry--  \"You may stop swinging me now. I think I'd like to go out rowing.\" The young man's cup seemed running over. He could scarcely command his voice for delight as he said--  \"It will be jolly rowing just now. I'm sure we can get some pond-lilies.\"  \"Really,\" she replied, airily, \"you take too much for granted. I was going to ask Tom Longman to take me out.\"  She called to Tom, and as he came up, grinning and shambling, she indicated to him her pleasure that he should row her upon the river. The idea of being alone in a small boat for perhaps fifteen minutes with the belle of Newville, and the object of his own secret and distant adoration, paralysed Tom's faculties with an agony of embarrassment. He grew very red, and there was such a buzzing in his ears that he could not feel sure he heard aright, and Madeline had to repeat herself several times before he seemed to fully realize the appalling nature of the proposition. As they walked down to the shore she chatted with him, but he only responded with a profusion of vacant laughs. When he had pulled out on the river, his rowing, from his desire to make an excuse for not talking, was so tremendous that they cheered him from the shore, at the same time shouting--  \"Keep her straight! You're going into the bank!\"  The truth was, that Tom could not guide the boat because he did not dare to look astern for fear of meeting Madeline's eyes, which, to judge from the space his eyes left around her, he must have supposed to fill at least a quarter of the horizon, like an aurora, in fact. But, all the same, he was having an awfully good time, although perhaps it would be more proper to say he would have a good time when he came to think it over afterward. It was an experience which would prove a mine of gold in his memory, rich enough to furnish for years the gilding to his modest day-dreams. Beauty, like wealth, should make its owners generous. It is a gracious thing in fair women at times to make largesse of their beauty, bestowing its light more freely on tongue-tied, timid adorers than on their bolder suitors, giving to them who dare not ask. Their beauty never can seem more precious to women than when for charity's sake they brighten with its lustre the eyes of shy and retiring admirers.  As Henry was ruefully meditating upon the uncertainty of the sex, and debating the probability that Madeline had called him to swing her for the express purpose of getting a chance to snub him, Ida Lewis came to him, and said--  \"Mr. Burr, we're getting up a game of croquet. Won't you play?\"  \"If I can be on your side,\" he answered, civilly.  He knew the girl's liking for him, and was always kind to her. At his answer her face flushed with pleasure, and she replied shyly--  \"If you'd like to, you may.\"  Henry was not in the least a conceited fellow, but it was impossible that he should not understand the reason why Ida, who all the morning had looked forlorn enough, was now the life of the croquet-ground, and full of smiles and flushes. She was a good player, and had a corresponding interest in beating, but her equanimity on the present occasion was not in the least disturbed by the disgraceful defeat which Henry's awkwardness and absence of mind entailed on their aide.  But her portion of sunshine for that day was brief enough, for Madeline soon returned from her boat-ride, and Henry found an excuse for leaving the game and joining her where she sat on the ground between the knees of a gigantic oak sorting pond-lilies, which the girls were admiring. As he came up, she did not appear to notice him. As soon as he had a chance to speak without being overheard, he said, soberly--  \"Tom ought to thank me for that boat-ride, I suppose.\"  \"I don't know what you mean,\" she answered, with assumed carelessness.  \"I mean that you went to punish me.\"  \"You're sufficiently conceited,\" she replied. \"Laura, come here; your brother is teasing me.\"  \"And do you think I want to be teased to?\" replied that young lady, pertly, as she walked off.  Madeline would have risen and left Henry, but she was too proud to let him think that she was afraid of him.. Neither was she afraid, but she was confused, and momentarily without her usual self-confidence. One reason for her running off with Tom had been to get a chance to think. No girl, however coolly her blood may flow, can be pressed to a man's breast, wildly throbbing with love for her, and not experience some agitation in consequence. Whatever may be the state of her sentiments, there is a magnetism in such a contact which she cannot at once throw off. That kiss had brought her relations with Henry to a crisis. It had precipitated the necessity of some decision. She could no longer hold him off, and play with him. By that bold dash he had gained a vantage-ground, a certain masterful attitude which he had never held before. Yet, after all, I am not sure that she was not just a little afraid of him, and, moreover, that she did not like him all the better for it. It was such a novel feeling that it began to make some things, thought of in connection with him, seem more possible to her mind than they had ever seemed before. As she peeped furtively at this young man, so suddenly grown formidable, as he reclined carelessly on the ground at her feet, she admitted to herself that there was something very manly in the sturdy figure and square forehead, with the curly black locks hanging over it. She looked at him with a new interest, half shrinking, half attracted, as one who might come into a very close relation with herself. She scarcely knew whether the thought was agreeable or not.  \"Give me your hat,\" she said, \"and I'll put some lilies in it.\"  \"You are very good,\" said he, handing it to her.  \"Does it strike you so?\" she replied, hesitatingly. \"Then I won't do it. I don't want to appear particularly good to you. I didn't know just how it would seem.\"  \"Oh, it won't seem very good; only about middling,\" he urged, upon which representation she took the hat.  He watched her admiringly as she deftly wreathed the lilies around it, holding it up, now this way and now that, while she critically inspected the effect.  Then her caprice changed. \"I've half a mind to drop it into the river. Would you jump after it?\" she said, twirling it by the brim, and looking over the steep bank, near which she sat, into the deep, dark water almost perpendicularly below.  \"If it were anything of yours instead of mine, I would jump quickly enough,\" he replied.  She looked at him with a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7052"],["title","Dr. Heidenhoff's Process (#5)"],["body","gleam in her eyes.  \"You mustn't talk chaff to me, sir; we'll see,\" and, snatching a glove from her pocket, she held it out over the water. They were both of them in that state of suppressed excitement which made such an experiment on each other's nerve dangerous. Their eyes met, and neither flinched. If she had dropped it, he would have gone after it.  \"After all,\" she said, suddenly, \"that would be taking a good deal of trouble to get a mitten. If you are so anxious for it, I will give it to you now;\" and she held out the glove to him with an inscrutable face.  He sprang up from the ground. \"Madeline, do you mean it?\" he asked, scarcely audibly, his face grown white and pinched. She crumpled the obnoxious glove into her pocket.  \"Why, you poor fellow!\" she exclaimed, the wildfire in her eyes quenched in a moment with the dew of pity. \"Do you care so much?\"  \"I care everything,\" he said, huskily.  But, as luck would have it, just at that instant Will Taylor came running up, pursued by Laura, and threw himself upon Madeline's protection. It appeared that he had confessed to the possession of a secret, and on being requested by Laura to impart it had flatly refused to do so.  \"I can't really interfere to protect any young man who refuses to tell a secret to a young lady,\" said Madeline, gravely. \"Neglect to tell her the secret, without being particularly asked to do so, would be bad enough, but to refuse after being requested is an offence which calls for the sharpest correction.\"  \"And that isn't all, either,\" said Laura, vindictively flirting the switch with which she had pursued him. \"He used offensive language.\"  \"What did he say?\" demanded Madeline, judicially.  \"I asked him if he was sure it was a secret that I didn't know already, and he said he was; and I asked him what made him sure, and he said because if I knew it everybody else would. As much as to say I couldn't keep a secret.\"  \"This looks worse and worse, young man,\" said the judge, severely. \"The only course left for you is to make a clean breast of the affair, and throw yourself on the mercy of the court. If the secret turns out to be a good one, I'll let you off as easily as I can.\"  \"It's about the new drug-clerk, the one who is going to take George Bayley's place,\" said Will, laughing.  \"Oh, do tell, quick!\" exclaimed Laura.  \"I don't care who it is. I sha'n't like him,\" said Madeline. \"Poor George! and here we are forgetting all about him this beautiful day!\"  \"What's the new clerk's name?\" said Laura, impatiently.  \"Harrison Cordis.\"  \"What?\"  \"Harrison Cordis.\"  \"Rather an odd name,\" said Laura. \"I never heard it.\"  \"No,\" said Will; \"he comes all the way from Boston.\"  \"Is he handsome?\" inquired Laura.  \"I really don't know,\" replied Will. \"I presume Parker failed to make that a condition, although really he ought to, for the looks of the clerk is the principal element in the sale of soda-water, seeing girls are the only ones who drink it.\"  \"Of course it is,\" said Laura, frankly. \"I didn't drink any all last summer, because poor George's sad face took away my disposition. Never mind,\" she added, \"we shall all have a chance to see how he looks at church to-morrow;\" and with that the two girls went off together to help set the table for lunch.  The picnickers did not row home till sunset, but Henry found no opportunity to resume the conversation with Madeline which had been broken off at such an interesting point.     CHAPTER IV.   The advent of a stranger was an event of importance in the small social world of Newville. Mr. Harrison Cordis, the new clerk in the drug-store, might well have been flattered by the attention which he excited at church the next day, especially from the fairer half of the congregation. Far, however, from appearing discomposed thereby, he returned it with such interest that at least half the girls thought they had captivated him by the end of the morning service. They all agreed that he was awfully handsome, though Laura maintained that he was rather too pretty for a man. He was certainly very pretty. His figure was tall, slight, and elegant. He had delicate hands and feet, a white forehead, deep blue, smiling eyes, short, curly, yellow, hair, and a small moustache, drooping over lips as enticing as a girl's. But the ladies voted his manners yet more pleasing than his appearance. They were charmed by his easy self-possession, and constant alertness as to details of courtesy. The village beaus scornfully called him \"cityfied,\" and secretly longed to be like him. A shrewder criticism than that to which he was exposed would, however, have found the fault with Cordis's manners that, under a show of superior ease and affability, he was disposed to take liberties with his new acquaintances, and exploit their simplicity for his own entertainment. Evidently he felt that he was in the country.  That very first Sunday, after evening meeting, he induced Fanny Miller, at whose father's house he boarded, to introduce him to Madeline, and afterward walked home with her, making himself very agreeable, and crowning his audacity by asking permission to call. Fanny, who went along with them, tattled of this, and it produced a considerable sensation among the girls, for it was the wont of Newville wooers to make very gradual approaches. Laura warmly expressed to Madeline her indignation at the impudence of the proceeding, but that young lady was sure she did not see any harm in it; whereupon Laura lost her temper a little, and hinted that it might be more to her credit if she did. Madeline replied pointedly, and the result was a little spat, from which Laura issued second best, as people generally did who provoked a verbal strife with Madeline. Meanwhile it was rumoured that Cordis had availed himself of the permission that he had asked, and that he had, moreover, been seen talking with her in the post-office several times.  The drug-store being next door to the post-office, it was easy for him, under pretence of calling for the mail, to waylay there any one he might wish to meet. The last of the week Fanny Miller gave a little tea-party, to make Cordis more generally acquainted. On that occasion he singled out Madeline with his attentions in such a pronounced manner that the other girls were somewhat piqued. Laura, having her brother's interest at heart, had much more serious reasons for being uneasy at the look of things. They all remarked how queerly Madeline acted that evening. She was so subdued and quiet, not a bit like herself. When the party broke up, Cordis walked home with Madeline and Laura, whose paths lay together.  \"I'm extremely fortunate,\" said he, as he was walking on with Laura, after leaving Madeline at her house, \"to have a chance to escort the two belles of Newville at once.\"  \"I'm not so foolish as I look, Mr. Cordis,\" said she, rather sharply. She was not going to let him think he could turn the head of every Newville girl as he had Madeline's with his city airs and compliments.  \"You might be, and not mind owning it,\" he replied, making an excuse of her words to scrutinise her face with a frank admiration that sent the colour to her cheeks, though she was more vexed than pleased.  \"I mean that I don't like flattery.\"  \"Are you sure?\" he asked, with apparent surprise.  \"Of course I am. What a question!\"  \"Excuse me; I only asked because I never met any one before who didn't.\"  \"Never met anybody who didn't like to be told things about themselves which they knew weren't true, and were just said because somebody thought they were foolish enough to believe 'em?\"  \"I don't expect you to believe 'em yourself,\" he replied; \"only vain people believe the good things people say about them; but I wouldn't give a cent for friends who didn't think better of me than I think of myself, and tell me so occasionally, too.\"  They stood a moment at Laura's gate, and just then Henry, coming home from the gun-shop of which he was foreman, passed them, and entered the house. \"Is that your brother?\" asked Cordis.  \"Yes.\"  \"It does one's eyes good to see such a powerful looking young man. Is your brother married, may I ask?\"  \"He is not.\"  \"In coming into a new circle as I have done, you understand, Miss Burr, I often feel a certain awkwardness on account of not knowing the relations between the persons I meet,\" he said, apologizing for his questions.  Laura saw her opportunity, and promptly improved it.  \"My brother has been attentive to Miss Brand for a long time. They are about as good as engaged. Good-evening, Mr. Cordis.\"  It so happened that several days after this conversation, as Madeline was walking home one afternoon, she glanced back at a crossing of the street, and saw Harrison Cordis coming behind her on his way to tea. At the rate she was walking she would reach home before he overtook her, but, if she walked a very little slower, he would overtake her. Her pace slackened. She blushed at her conduct, but she did not hurry.  The most dangerous lovers women have are men of Cordis's feminine temperament. Such men, by the delicacy and sensitiveness of their own organizations, read women as easily and accurately as women read each other. They are alert to detect and interpret those smallest trifles in tone, expression, and bearing, which betray the real mood far more unmistakably than more obvious signs. Cordis had seen her backward glance, and noted her steps grow slower with a complacent smile. It was this which emboldened him, in spite of the short acquaintance, to venture on the line he did.  \"Good-evening, Miss Brand,\" he said, as he over took her. \"I don't really think it's fair to begin to hurry when you hear somebody trying to overtake you.  \"I'm sure I didn't mean to,\" she replied, glad to have a chance to tell the truth, without suspecting, poor girl, that he knew very well she was telling it.  \"It isn't safe to,\" he said, laughing. \"You can't tell who it may be. Now, it might have been Mr. Burr, instead of"]]]
