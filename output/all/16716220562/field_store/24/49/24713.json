They were ever a fierce and a malignant house.\"  \"We will not, with my consent,\" said Burley, \"engage in a siege which may consume time. We must rush forward, and follow our advantage by occupying Glasgow; for I do not fear that the troops we have this day beaten, even with the assistance of my Lord Ross's regiment, will judge it safe to await our coming.\"  \"Howbeit,\" said Poundtext, \"we may display a banner before the Tower, and blow a trumpet, and summon them to come forth. It may be that they will give over the place into our mercy, though they be a rebellious people. And we will summon the women to come forth of their stronghold, that is, Lady Margaret Bellenden and her grand-daughter, and Jenny Dennison, which is a girl of an ensnaring eye, and the other maids, and we will give them a safe conduct, and send them in peace to the city, even to the town of Edinburgh. But John Gudyill, and Hugh Harrison, and Miles Bellenden, we will restrain with fetters of iron, even as they, in times bypast, have done to the martyred saints.\"  \"Who talks of safe conduct and of peace?\" said a shrill, broken, and overstrained voice, from the crowd.  \"Peace, brother Habakkuk,\" said Macbriar, in a soothing tone, to the speaker.  \"I will not hold my peace,\" reiterated the strange and unnatural voice; \"is this a time to speak of peace, when the earth quakes, and the mountains are rent, and the rivers are changed into blood, and the two-edged sword is drawn from the sheath to drink gore as if it were water, and devour flesh as the fire devours dry stubble?\"  While he spoke thus, the orator struggled forward to the inner part of the circle, and presented to Morton's wondering eyes a figure worthy of such a voice and such language. The rags of a dress which had once been black, added to the tattered fragments of a shepherd's plaid, composed a covering scarce fit for the purposes of decency, much less for those of warmth or comfort. A long beard, as white as snow, hung down on his breast, and mingled with bushy, uncombed, grizzled hair, which hung in elf-locks around his wild and staring visage. The features seemed to be extenuated by penury and famine, until they hardly retained the likeness of a human aspect. The eyes, grey, wild, and wandering, evidently betokened a bewildered imagination. He held in his hand a rusty sword, clotted with blood, as were his long lean hands, which were garnished at the extremity with nails like eagle's claws.  \"In the name of Heaven! who is he?\" said Morton, in a whisper to Poundtext, surprised, shocked, and even startled, at this ghastly apparition, which looked more like the resurrection of some cannibal priest, or druid red from his human sacrifice, than like an earthly mortal.  \"It is Habakkuk Mucklewrath,\" answered Poundtext, in the same tone, \"whom the enemy have long detained in captivity in forts and castles, until his understanding hath departed from him, and, as I fear, an evil demon hath possessed him. Nevertheless, our violent brethren will have it, that he speaketh of the spirit, and that they fructify by his pouring forth.\"  Here he was interrupted by Mucklewrath, who cried in a voice that made the very beams of the roof quiver--\"Who talks of peace and safe conduct? who speaks of mercy to the bloody house of the malignants? I say take the infants and dash them against the stones; take the daughters and the mothers of the house and hurl them from the battlements of their trust, that the dogs may fatten on their blood as they did on that of Jezabel, the spouse of Ahab, and that their carcasses may be dung to the face of the field even in the portion of their fathers!\"  \"He speaks right,\" said more than one sullen voice from behind; \"we will be honoured with little service in the great cause, if we already make fair weather with Heaven's enemies.\"  \"This is utter abomination and daring impiety,\" said Morton, unable to contain his indignation.  \"What blessing can you expect in a cause, in which you listen to the mingled ravings of madness and atrocity?\"  \"Hush, young man!\" said Kettledrummle, \"and reserve thy censure for that for which thou canst render a reason. It is not for thee to judge into what vessels the spirit may be poured.\"  \"We judge of the tree by the fruit,\" said Poundtext, \"and allow not that to be of divine inspiration that contradicts the divine laws.\"  \"You forget, brother Poundtext,\" said Macbriar, \"that these are the latter days, when signs and wonders shall be multiplied.\"  Poundtext stood forward to reply; but, ere he could articulate a word, the insane preacher broke in with a scream that drowned all competition.  \"Who talks of signs and wonders? Am not I Habakkuk Mucklewrath, whose name is changed to Magor-Missabib, because I am made a terror unto myself and unto all that are around me?--I heard it--When did I hear it?--Was it not in the Tower of the Bass, that overhangeth the wide wild sea?--And it howled in the winds, and it roared in the billows, and it screamed, and it whistled, and it clanged, with the screams and the clang and the whistle of the sea-birds, as they floated, and flew, and dropped, and dived, on the bosom of the waters. I saw it--Where did I see it?--Was it not from the high peaks of Dunbarton, when I looked westward upon the fertile land, and northward on the wild Highland hills; when the clouds gathered and the tempest came, and the lightnings of heaven flashed in sheets as wide as the banners of an host?--What did I see?--Dead corpses and wounded horses, the rushing together of battle, and garments rolled in blood.--What heard I?--The voice that cried, Slay, slay--smite--slay utterly--let not your eye have pity! slay utterly, old and young, the maiden, the child, and the woman whose head is grey--Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain!\"  \"We receive the command,\" exclaimed more than one of the company. \"Six days he hath not spoken nor broken bread, and now his tongue is unloosed:--We receive the command; as he hath said, so will we do.\"  Astonished, disgusted, and horror-struck, at what he had seen and heard, Morton turned away from the circle and left the cottage. He was followed by Burley, who had his eye on his motions.  \"Whither are you going?\" said the latter, taking him by the arm.  \"Any where,--I care not whither; but here I will abide no longer.\"  \"Art thou so soon weary, young man?\" answered Burley. \"Thy hand is but now put to the plough, and wouldst thou already abandon it? Is this thy adherence to the cause of thy father?\"  \"No cause,\" replied Morton, indignantly--\"no cause can prosper, so conducted. One party declares for the ravings of a bloodthirsty madman; another leader is an old scholastic pedant; a third\"--he stopped, and his companion continued the sentence--\"Is a desperate homicide, thou wouldst say, like John Balfour of Burley?--I can bear thy misconstruction without resentment. Thou dost not consider, that it is not men of sober and self-seeking minds, who arise in these days of wrath to execute judgment and to accomplish deliverance. Hadst thou but seen the armies of England, during her Parliament of 1640, whose ranks were filled with sectaries and enthusiasts, wilder than the anabaptists of Munster, thou wouldst have had more cause to marvel; and yet these men were unconquered on the field, and their hands wrought marvellous things for the liberties of the land.\"  \"But their affairs,\" replied Morton, \"were wisely conducted, and the violence of their zeal expended itself in their exhortations and sermons, without bringing divisions into their counsels, or cruelty into their conduct. I have often heard my father say so, and protest, that he wondered at nothing so much as the contrast between the extravagance of their religious tenets, and the wisdom and moderation with which they conducted their civil and military affairs. But our councils seem all one wild chaos of confusion.\"  \"Thou must have patience, Henry Morton,\" answered Balfour; \"thou must not leave the cause of thy religion and country either for one wild word, or one extravagant action. Hear me. I have already persuaded the wiser of our friends, that the counsellors are too numerous, and that we cannot expect that the Midianites shall, by so large a number, be delivered into our hands. They have hearkened to my voice, and our assemblies will be shortly reduced within such a number as can consult and act together; and in them thou shalt have a free voice, as well as in ordering our affairs of war, and protecting those to whom mercy should be shown--Art thou now satisfied?\"  \"It will give me pleasure, doubtless,\" answered Morton, \"to be the means of softening the horrors of civil war; and I will not leave the post I have taken, unless I see measures adopted at which my conscience revolts. But to no bloody executions after quarter asked, or slaughter without trial, will I lend countenance or sanction; and you may depend on my opposing them, with both heart and hand, as constantly and resolutely, if attempted by our own followers, as when they are the work of the enemy.\"  Balfour waved his hand impatiently.  \"Thou wilt find,\" he said, \"that the stubborn and hard-hearted generation with whom we deal, must be chastised with scorpions ere their hearts be humbled, and ere they accept the punishment of their iniquity. The word is gone forth against them, 'I will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my Covenant.' But what is done shall be done gravely, and with discretion, like that of the worthy James Melvin, who executed judgment on the tyrant and oppressor, Cardinal Beaton.\"  \"I own to you,\" replied Morton, \"that I feel still more abhorrent at cold-blooded and premeditated cruelty, than at that which is practised in the heat of zeal and resentment.\"  \"Thou art yet but a youth,\" replied Balfour, \"and hast not learned how"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6940"],["title","Old Mortality, Volume 2. (#2)"],["body","in the balance are a few drops of blood in comparison to the weight and importance of this great national testimony. But be not afraid; thyself shall vote and judge in these matters; it may be we shall see little cause to strive together anent them.\"  With this concession Morton was compelled to be satisfied for the present; and Burley left him, advising him to lie down and get some rest, as the host would probably move in the morning.  \"And you,\" answered Morton, \"do not you go to rest also?\"  \"No,\" said Burley; \"my eyes must not yet know slumber. This is no work to be done lightly; I have yet to perfect the choosing of the committee of leaders, and I will call you by times in the morning to be present at their consultation.\"  He turned away, and left Morton to his repose.  The place in which he found himself was not ill adapted for the purpose, being a sheltered nook, beneath a large rock, well protected from the prevailing wind. A quantity of moss with which the ground was overspread, made a couch soft enough for one who had suffered so much hardship and anxiety. Morton wrapped himself in the horse-man's cloak which he had still retained, stretched himself on the ground, and had not long indulged in melancholy reflections on the state of the country, and upon his own condition, ere he was relieved from them by deep and sound slumber.  The rest of the army slept on the ground, dispersed in groups, which chose their beds on the fields as they could best find shelter and convenience. A few of the principal leaders held wakeful conference with Burley on the state of their affairs, and some watchmen were appointed who kept themselves on the alert by chanting psalms, or listening to the exercises of the more gifted of their number.      CHAPTER II.                 Got with much ease--now merrily to horse.                                              Henry IV. Part I.  With the first peep of day Henry awoke, and found the faithful Cuddie standing beside him with a portmanteau in his hand.  \"I hae been just putting your honour's things in readiness again ye were waking,\" said Cuddie, \"as is my duty, seeing ye hae been sae gude as to tak me into your service.\"  \"I take you into my service, Cuddie?\" said Morton, \"you must be dreaming.\"  \"Na, na, stir,\" answered Cuddie; \"didna I say when I was tied on the horse yonder, that if ever ye gat loose I would be your servant, and ye didna say no? and if that isna hiring, I kenna what is. Ye gae me nae arles, indeed, but ye had gien me eneugh before at Milnwood.\"  \"Well, Cuddie, if you insist on taking the chance of my unprosperous fortunes\"--  \"Ou ay, I'se warrant us a' prosper weel eneugh,\" answered Cuddie, cheeringly, \"an anes my auld mither was weel putten up. I hae begun the campaigning trade at an end that is easy eneugh to learn.\"  \"Pillaging, I suppose?\" said Morton, \"for how else could you come by that portmanteau?\"  \"I wotna if it's pillaging, or how ye ca't,\" said Cuddie, \"but it comes natural to a body, and it's a profitable trade. Our folk had tirled the dead dragoons as bare as bawbees before we were loose amaist.--But when I saw the Whigs a' weel yokit by the lugs to Kettledrummle and the other chield, I set off at the lang trot on my ain errand and your honour's. Sae I took up the syke a wee bit, away to the right, where I saw the marks o'mony a horsefoot, and sure eneugh I cam to a place where there had been some clean leatherin', and a' the puir chields were lying there buskit wi' their claes just as they had put them on that morning--naebody had found out that pose o' carcages--and wha suld be in the midst thereof (as my mither says) but our auld acquaintance, Sergeant Bothwell?\"  \"Ay, has that man fallen?\" said Morton.  \"Troth has he,\" answered Cuddie; \"and his een were open and his brow bent, and his teeth clenched thegither, like the jaws of a trap for foumarts when the spring's doun--I was amaist feared to look at him; however, I thought to hae turn about wi' him, and sae I e'en riped his pouches, as he had dune mony an honester man's; and here's your ain siller again (or your uncle's, which is the same) that he got at Milnwood that unlucky night that made us a' sodgers thegither.\"  \"There can be no harm, Cuddie,\" said Morton, \"in making use of this money, since we know how he came by it; but you must divide with me.\"  \"Bide a wee, bide a wee,\" said Cuddie. \"Weel, and there's a bit ring he had hinging in a black ribbon doun on his breast. I am thinking it has been a love-token, puir fallow--there's naebody sae rough but they hae aye a kind heart to the lasses--and there's a book wi'a wheen papers, and I got twa or three odd things, that I'll keep to mysell, forby.\"  \"Upon my word, you have made a very successful foray for a beginner,\" said his new master.  \"Haena I e'en now?\" said Cuddie, with great exultation. \"I tauld ye I wasna that dooms stupid, if it cam to lifting things.--And forby, I hae gotten twa gude horse. A feckless loon of a Straven weaver, that has left his loom and his bein house to sit skirling on a cauld hill-side, had catched twa dragoon naigs, and he could neither gar them hup nor wind, sae he took a gowd noble for them baith--I suld hae tried him wi' half the siller, but it's an unco ill place to get change in--Ye'll find the siller's missing out o' Bothwell's purse.\"  \"You have made a most excellent and useful purchase, Cuddie; but what is that portmanteau?\"  \"The pockmantle?\" answered Cuddie, \"it was Lord Evandale's yesterday, and it's yours the day. I fand it ahint the bush o' broom yonder--ilka dog has its day--Ye ken what the auld sang says,            'Take turn about, mither, quo' Tam o' the Linn.'  \"And, speaking o' that, I maun gang and see about my mither, puir auld body, if your honour hasna ony immediate commands.\"  \"But, Cuddie,\" said Morton, \"I really cannot take these things from you without some recompense.\"  \"Hout fie, stir,\" answered Cuddie, \"ye suld aye be taking,--for recompense, ye may think about that some other time--I hae seen gay weel to mysell wi' some things that fit me better. What could I do wi' Lord Evandale's braw claes? Sergeant Bothwell's will serve me weel eneugh.\"  Not being able to prevail on the self-constituted and disinterested follower to accept of any thing for himself out of these warlike spoils, Morton resolved to take the first opportunity of returning Lord Evandale's property, supposing him yet to be alive; and, in the meanwhile, did not hesitate to avail himself of Cuddie's prize, so far as to appropriate some changes of linen and other triffling articles amongst those of more value which the portmanteau contained.  He then hastily looked over the papers which were found in Bothwell's pocket-book. These were of a miscellaneous description. The roll of his troop, with the names of those absent on furlough, memorandums of tavern-bills, and lists of delinquents who might be made subjects of fine and persecution, first presented themselves, along with a copy of a warrant from the Privy Council to arrest certain persons of distinction therein named. In another pocket of the book were one or two commissions which Bothwell had held at different times, and certificates of his services abroad, in which his courage and military talents were highly praised. But the most remarkable paper was an accurate account of his genealogy, with reference to many documents for establishment of its authenticity; subjoined was a list of the ample possessions of the forfeited Earls of Bothwell, and a particular account of the proportions in which King James VI. had bestowed them on the courtiers and nobility by whose descendants they were at present actually possessed; beneath this list was written, in red letters, in the hand of the deceased, Haud Immemor, F. S. E. B. the initials probably intimating Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell. To these documents, which strongly painted the character and feelings of their deceased proprietor, were added some which showed him in a light greatly different from that in which we have hitherto presented him to the reader.  In a secret pocket of the book, which Morton did not discover without some trouble, were one or two letters, written in a beautiful female hand. They were dated about twenty years back, bore no address, and were subscribed only by initials. Without having time to peruse them accurately, Morton perceived that they contained the elegant yet fond expressions of female affection directed towards an object whose jealousy they endeavoured to soothe, and of whose hasty, suspicious, and impatient temper, the writer seemed gently to complain. The ink of these manuscripts had faded by time, and, notwithstanding the great care which had obviously been taken for their preservation, they were in one or two places chafed so as to be illegible.  \"It matters not,\" these words were written on the envelope of that which had suffered most, \"I have them by heart.\"  With these letters was a lock of hair wrapped in a copy of verses, written obviously with a feeling, which atoned, in Morton's opinion, for the roughness of the poetry, and the conceits with which it abounded, according to the taste of the period:  Thy hue, dear pledge, is pure and bright, As in that well-remember'd night, When first thy mystic braid was wove, And first my Agnes whisper'd love. Since then, how often hast thou press'd The torrid zone of this wild breast, Whose wrath and hate have sworn to dwell With the first sin which peopled hell; A breast whose blood's a troubled ocean, Each throb the earthquake's wild commotion!--O, if such clime thou canst endure, Yet keep thy hue unstain'd and pure, What conquest o'er each erring thought Of that fierce realm had Agnes wrought! I had not wander'd wild and wide, With such an angel for my guide; Nor heaven nor earth could then reprove me, If she had lived, and lived to love me. Not then this world's wild joys had been To me one savage hunting-scene, My sole"]]]
