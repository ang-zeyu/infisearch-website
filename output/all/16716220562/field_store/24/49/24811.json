Insensible itself, it is the organ of touch. It feels the pressure of a hair, yet bears the weight of the body. It yields to every motion of that which it wraps and holds in place. It hides from view the delicate organs within, yet the faintest tint of a thought shines through, while the soul paints upon it, as on a canvas, the richest and rarest of colors.

THE SKIN is a tough, thin, close-fitting garment for the protection of the tender flesh. Its perfect elasticity beautifully adapts it to every motion of the body. We shall learn hereafter that it is more than a mere covering, being an active organ, which does its part in the work of keeping in order the house in which we live. It oils itself to preserve its smoothness and delicacy, replaces itself as fast as it wears out, and is at once the perfection of use and beauty.  1. STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.  CUTIS AND CUTICLE.--What we commonly call the skin--viz., the part raised by a blister--is only the cuticle [Footnote: _Cuticula_, little skin. It is often styled the scarfskin, and also the epidermis (_epi_, upon; and _derma_, skin).] or covering of the cutis or true skin. The latter is full of nerves and blood vessels, while the former neither bleeds [Footnote: We notice this in shaving; for if a razor goes below the cuticle, it is followed by pain and blood. So insensible is this outer layer that we can run a pin through the thick mass at the roots of the nails without discomfort.] nor gives rise to pain, neither suffers from heat nor feels the cold.  The cuticle is composed of small, flat cells or scales. These are constantly shed from the surface in the form of scurf, dandruff, etc., but are as constantly renewed from the cutis [Footnote: We see how rapidly this change goes on by noticing how soon a stain of any kind disappears from the skin. A snake throws off its cuticle entire, and at regular intervals.] below.  Under the microscope, we can see the round cells of the cuticle, and how they are flattened and hardened as they are forced to the surface. The immense number of these cells surpasses comprehension. In one square inch of the cuticle, counting only those in a single layer, there are over a billion horny scales, each complete in itself.--HARTING.  FIG. 22.  [Illustration: A _represents a vertical section of the Cuticle._ B, _lateral view of the cells._ C, _flat side of scales like_ d, _magnified 250 diameters, showing the nucleated cells transformed into broad scales._]  VALUE OF THE CUTICLE.--In the palm of the hand, the sole of the foot, and other parts especially liable to injury, the cuticle is very thick. This is a most admirable provision for their protection. [Footnote: We can hold the hand in strong brine with impunity, but the smart will quickly tell us when there is even a scratch in the skin. Vaccine matter must be inserted beneath the cuticle to take effect. This membrane doubtless prevents many poisonous substances from entering the system.] By use, it becomes callous and horny. The boy who goes out barefoot for the first time, \"treading as if on eggs,\" can soon run where he pleases among thistles and over stones. The blacksmith handles hot iron without pain, while the mason lays stones and works in lime, without scratching or corroding his flesh.  THE COMPLEXION.--In the freshly made cells on the lower side of the cuticle, is a pigment composed of tiny grains. [Footnote: These grains are about 1/2000 of an inch in diameter, and, curiously enough, do not appear opaque, but transparent and nearly colorless.--MARSHALL.] In the varying tint of this coloring matter, lies the difference of hue between the blonde and the brunette, the European and the African. In the purest complexion, there is some of this pigment, which, however, disappears as the fresh, round, soft cells next the cutis change into the old, flat, horny scales at the surface.  Scars are white, because this part of the cuticle is not restored. The sun has a powerful effect upon the coloring matter, and so we readily \"tan\" on exposure to its rays. If the color gathers in spots, it forms freckles. [Footnote: This action of the sun on the pigment of the skin is very marked. Even among the Africans, the skin is observed to lose its intense black color in those who live for many months in the shades of the forest. It is said that Asiatic and African women confined within the walls of the harem, and thus secluded from the sun, are as fair as Europeans. Among the Jews who have settled in Northern Europe, are many of light complexion, while those who live in India are as dark as the Hindoos. Intense heat also increases this coloring matter, and thus a furnace-man's skin, even where protected by clothing, becomes completely bronzed. The black pigment has been known to disappear during severe illness, and a lighter color to be developed in its place. Among the negroes, are sometimes found people who have no complexion, _i. e._, there is no coloring matter in their skin, hair, or the iris of their eyes. These persons are called Albinos.]  II. HAIR AND NAILS.  The Hair and the Nails are modified forms of the cuticle.  FIG. 23.

FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS ABROAD  by  MARGARET SIDNEY   Illustrated by FANNY Y. CORY     PREFACE  When the friends of the Pepper family found that the author was firm in her decision to continue their history no further, they brought their appeals for the details of some of those good times that made the \"little brown house\" an object-lesson.  In these appeals, the parents were as vigorous as the young people for a volume of the stories that Polly told, to keep the children happy in those hard days when her story-telling had to be a large factor in their home-life; and also for a book of their plays and exploits, impossible to be embodied in the continued series of their history, so that all who loved the \"Five Little Peppers\" might the better study the influences that shaped their lives.  Those requests were complied with; the author realising that the detailed account held values, by which stronger light might be thrown on the family life in the \"little brown house.\"  And now the pressure is brought to bear for a book showing the Little Peppers over the ocean, recorded in \"Five Little Peppers Midway.\" And the author is very glad to comply again; for foreign travel throws a wholly different side-light upon the Pepper family. So here is the book.  It is in no sense to be taken as a story written for a guide-book,--although the author lives in it again her repeated enjoyment of the sights and scenes which are accurately depicted. A \"Baedeker,\" if carefully studied, is really all that is needed as a constant companion to the traveller; while for supplementary helps and suggestions, there are many valuable books along the same line. This volume is given up to the Peppers; and they must live their own lives and tell their own story while abroad just as they choose.  As the author has stated many times, her part is \"simply to set down what the Peppers did and said, without trying to make them say or do anything in particular.\" And so over the ocean they are just as much the makers of their own history as when they first opened the door of the \"little brown house\" to                                   MARGARET SIDNEY.

I've searched just everywhere for her.\" And she gave a little sigh, and pushed up the brown rings of hair under her sailor cap.  \"Don't worry, Polly,\" said Jasper, with a reassuring smile. \"She's with Matilda, of course. Come, Polly, let's you and I have a try at the shuffle-board by ourselves, down on the lower deck.\"  \"No, we can't,\" said Polly, with a dreadful longing at her heart for the charms of a game; \"that is, until we've found Phronsie.\" And she ran down the deck. \"Perhaps she is in one of the library corners, though I thought I looked over them all.\"  \"How do you know she isn't with Matilda, Polly?\" cried Jasper, racing after, to see Polly's little blue jacket whisking ahead of him up the companion-way.  \"Because\"--Polly stopped at the top and looked over her shoulder at him--\"Matilda's in her berth. She's awfully seasick. I was to stay with Phronsie, and now I've lost her!\" And the brown head drooped, and Polly clasped her hands tightly together.  \"Oh, no, she can't be lost, Polly,\" said Jasper, cheerfully, as he bounded up the stairs and gained her side; \"why, she couldn't be!\"  \"Well, anyway, we can't find her, Jasper,\" said Polly, running on. \"And it's all my fault, for I forgot, and left her in the library, and went with Fanny Vanderburgh down to her state-room. O dear me!\" as she sped on.  \"Well, she's in the library now, most likely,\" said Jasper, cheerfully, hurrying after, \"curled up asleep in a corner.\" And they both ran in, expecting to see Phronsie's yellow head snuggled into one of the pillows.  But there was no one there except a little old gentleman on one of the sofas back of a table, who held his paper upside down, his big spectacles on the end of his nose, almost tumbling off as he nodded drowsily with the motion of the steamer.  \"O dear me!\" exclaimed Polly; \"now we shall wake him up,\" as they tiptoed around, peering in every cosey corner and behind all the tables for a glimpse of Phronsie's little brown gown.  \"No danger,\" said Jasper, with a glance over at the old gentleman; \"he's just as fast asleep as can be. Here, Polly, I think she's probably tucked up in here.\" And he hurried over to the farther side, where the sofa made a generous angle.  Just then in stalked a tall boy, who rushed up to the little old gentleman. \"Here, Granddad, wake up.\" And he shook his arm smartly. \"You're losing your glasses, and then there'll be a beastly row to pay.\"  \"O dear me!\" cried Polly aghast, as she and Jasper whirled around.  \"Hey--what--what!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, clutching his paper as he started forward. \"Oh,--why, I haven't been asleep, Tom.\"  \"Ha! Ha! tell that to the marines,\" cried Tom, loudly, dancing in derision, \"You've been sleeping like a log. You'd much better go down and get into your state-room. But give me a sovereign first.\" He held out his hand as he spoke. \"Hurry up, Granddad!\" he added impatiently.  The old gentleman put his hand to his head, and then rubbed his eyes.  \"Bustle up,\" cried the boy, with a laugh, \"or else I'll run my fist in your pocket and help myself.\"  \"Indeed, you won't,\" declared the old gentleman, now thoroughly awake.  \"Ha! Ha!\" laughed the boy. \"You see if I won't, Granddad.\" Yet he dropped his imperious tone, and waited, though impatiently, while the big pocket-book was drawn out.  \"What do you want with money on board the boat?\" demanded the old gentleman.  \"Give me a sovereign, Granddad,\" cried Tom, controlling his impatience as best he might, with many a cross look at the wrinkled old face under the white hair.  His Grandfather slowly drew out the coin, and Tom twitched it eagerly from the long, thin fingers.  \"I don't see how you can need money on board the boat,\" repeated the old gentleman.  \"Never you mind what I want it for, Grand-daddy,\" said Tom, laughing loudly and shaking the sovereign at him as he ran off; \"that's my business, and not yours.\"  Polly had not taken her eyes off their faces. Now she turned toward Jasper. \"Oh, how very dreadful!\" she gasped--then would have given everything if she had kept still, for the old gentleman whirled around and saw them for the first time.  \"Hey--who are you--and what are you listening there for--hey?\" he demanded sharply. He had little black eyes, and they now snapped in a truly dreadful way at them.  \"We came to find her little sister,\" said Jasper, politely, for Polly was quite beyond speaking.  \"Sister? I don't know anything about your sister,\" said the old gentleman, irascibly. \"And this room isn't a place for children, I can tell you,\" he added, as if he owned the library and the whole ship.  Jasper made no reply.  \"Phronsie isn't here.\" Polly clasped her hands again tighter than ever. \"And, oh, Jasper!\" and she looked at the angry old face before them with pitying eyes.  \"What I say to my grandson, Tom, and what he says to me, is our own business!\" exclaimed the old gentleman in a passion, thumping the table with his clenched hand. \"And no one else has a right to hear it.\"  \"I am so very sorry we heard it,\" said Polly, the colour which had quite gone from her cheek now rushing back. \"And we are going right away, sir.\"  \"You would much better,\" said the old man, nodding angrily. \"And you, boy, too; I suppose you think yourself better than my Tom. But you are not--not a bit of it!\" And suddenly he tried to start to his feet, but lurched heavily against the table instead.  Polly and Jasper rushed over to him. \"Lean on me, sir,\" said Jasper, putting both arms around him, while Polly ran to his other side, he was shaking so dreadfully.  The old gentleman essayed to wave them off. \"Let me alone,\" he said feebly; \"I'm going after my grandson, Tom.\" His voice sank to a whisper, and his head dropped to his breast. \"He's got money--he's always getting it, and I'm going to see what he's doing with it.\"  \"Polly,\" said Jasper, \"you help me put him back on the sofa; there, that's it,\" as the old man sank feebly down against the cushions; \"and then I'll run and find his grandson.\"  It was just the time when everybody seemed to be in the state-rooms, or out on deck in steamer chairs, so Polly sat there at the old man's head, feeling as if every minute were an hour, and he kept gurgling, \"Tom's a bad boy--he gets money all the time, and I'm going to see what he's doing with it,\" with feeble waves of his "]]]
