That Jefferson, when he penned them, foresaw the terrible results to flow from these specious and pernicious doctrines, is not to be supposed for an instant; but that his conscience troubled him may be fairly inferred from the fact that he withheld from the World for twenty years afterward the knowledge that he was their author.  It is probable that in this case, as in others, he was a victim of that casuistry which teaches that \"the end justifies the means;\" that he hoped and believed that the assertion of these baleful doctrines would act solely as a check upon any tendency to further centralization of power in the General Government and insure that strict construction of the Constitution.  Though afterward violated by himself at the same time that he for the moment threw aside his scruples touching African slavery, when he added to our domain the great French Slave Colony of Louisiana--was none the less the great aim of his commanding intellect; and that he fortuitously believed in the \"saving common sense\" of his race and country as capable of correcting an existing evil when it shall have developed into ill effects.       [Mr. Jefferson takes this very ground, in almost the same words, in      his letter, 1803, to Wilson C.  Nichols in the Louisiana Colony      purchase case, when, after proving by his own strict construction      of the Constitution that there was no power in that instrument to      make such purchase, and confessing the importance in that very case      of setting \"an example against broad construction,\" he concludes:      \"If, however, our friends shall think differently, certainly I      shall acquiesce with satisfaction; confiding that the good sense of      the country will correct the evil of construction when it shall      produce ill ejects.\"]  Be that as it may, however, the fact remains that the seeds thus sown by the hands of Jefferson on the \"sacred soil\" of Virginia and Kentucky, were dragon's teeth, destined in after years to spring up as legions of armed men battling for the subversion of that Constitution and the destruction of that Union which he so reverenced, and which he was so largely instrumental in founding--and which even came back in his own life to plague him and Madison during his embargo, and Madison's war of 1812-15, in the utterances and attitude of some of the New England Federalists.  The few Free Traders of the South--the Giles's and John Taylor's and men of that ilk--made up for their paucity in numbers by their unscrupulous ingenuity and active zeal.  They put forth the idea that the American Protective Policy was a policy of fostering combinations by Federal laws, the effect of which was to transfer a considerable portion of the profits of slave labor from the Slave States to other parts of the Union where it was massed in the hands of a few individuals, and thus created a moneyed interest which avariciously influenced the General Government to the detriment of the entire community of people, who, made restive by the exactions of this power working through the Federal Government, were as a consequence driven to consider a possible dissolution of the Union, and make \"estimates of resources and means of defense.\"  As a means also of inflaming both the poor whites and Southern slave-holders by arousing the apprehensions of the latter concerning the \"peculiar institution\" of Slavery, they craftily declared that \"If the maxim advanced by the advocates of the protecting duty system will justify Congress in assuming, or rather in empowering a few capitalists to assume, the direction of manufacturing labor, it also invests that body with a power of legislating for the direction of every other species of labor and assigning all occupations whatsoever to the care of the intelligence of mercenary combinations\"--and hence untold misery to labor.  They charged as a further means of firing the Southern heart, that this moneyed power, born of Protection, \"works upon the passion of the States it has been able to delude by computations of their physical strength and their naval superiority; and by boasting of an ability to use the weakening circumstance of negro slavery to coerce the defrauded and discontented States into submission.\"  And they declared as fundamental truths upon which they rested that \"The Federal is not a National Government; it is a league between nations.  By this league, a limited power only over persons and property was given to the representatives of the united nations.  This power cannot be further extended, under the pretext of national good, because the league does not create a national government.\"  It was the passage of the Tariff of 1824 that gave these crafty Free Traders their first great success in spreading their doctrine of Free Trade by coupling it with questions of slave labor, States Rights, and nullification, as laid down in the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions. These arguments created great excitement throughout the South --especially in South Carolina and Georgia--which was still further increased by the passage of the Tariff of 1828, since declared by eminent authority to have been \"the highest and most protective ever adopted in this country.\"       [Mr. Greeley, in his \"History of the American Conflict,\" 1864.]  Prior to the passage of this Tariff Act, excited assemblages met in some of the Southern States, and protested against it as an outrage upon their rights--arraying the South in seditious and treasonable attitude against not only the North but the Union, with threats of Secession.  At one of these meetings in South Carolina, in 1827, one of their leaders --[Dr. Thomas Cooper, President of South Carolina College.]--declared that \"a drilled and managed majority\" in the House of Representatives had determined \"at all hazards to support the claims of the Northern manufacturers, and to offer up the planting interest on the altar of monopoly.\"  He denounced the American system of Protection exemplified in that Tariff measure as \"a system by which the earnings of the South are to be transferred to the North--by which the many are to be sacrificed to the few--under which powers are usurped that were never conceded--by which inequality of rights, inequality of burthens, inequality of protection, unequal laws, and unequal taxes are to be enacted and rendered permanent--that the planter and the farmer under this system are to be considered as inferior beings to the spinner, the bleacher, and the dyer--that we of the South hold our plantations under this system, as the serfs and operatives of the North, subject to the orders and laboring for the benefit of the master-minds of Massachusetts, the lords of the spinning jenny and peers of the power-loom, who have a right to tax our earnings for their emolument, and to burthen our poverty and to swell their riches;\" and after characterizing Protection as \"a system of fraud, robbery and usurpation,\" he continued \"I have said that we shall ere long be compelled to calculate the value of our Union; and to enquire of what use to us is this most unequal alliance, by which the South has always been the loser and the North always the gainer.  Is it worth our while to continue this union of States, where the North demands to be our masters and we are required to be their tributaries? who with the most insulting mockery call the yoke they put upon our necks the 'American system!'  The question, however, is fast approaching the alternative of submission or separation.\"  Only a few days after this inflammatory speech at Columbus, S. C., inciting South Carolinians to resist the pending Protective Tariff even to the lengths of Secession, during a grand banquet at Richmond, Va., William B. Giles--another Free Trade leader--proposed, and those present drank a toast to the \"Tariff Schemer\" in which was embodied a declaration that \"The Southerners will not long pay tribute.\"  Despite these turbulent and treasonable mutterings, however, the \"Jacksonian Congress\" passed the Act--a majority of members from the Cotton and New England States voting against, while the vote of the Middle and Western Free States was almost solidly for, it.  At a meeting held soon after the enactment of the Tariff of 1828, at Walterborough Court House, S. C., an address was adopted and issued which, after reciting the steps that had been taken by South Carolina during the previous year to oppose it, by memorials and otherwise, and stating that, despite their \"remonstrances and implorations,\" a Tariff Bill had passed, not indeed, such as they apprehended, but \"ten-fold worse in all its oppressive features,\" proceeded thus:  \"From the rapid step of usurpation, whether we now act or not, the day of open opposition to the pretended powers of the Constitution cannot be far off, and it is that it may not go down in blood that we now call upon you to resist.  We feel ourselves standing underneath its mighty protection, and declaring forth its free and recorded spirit, when we say we must resist.  By all the great principles of liberty--by the glorious achievements of our fathers in defending them--by their noble blood poured forth like water in maintaining them--by their lives in suffering, and their death in honor and in glory;--our countrymen! we must resist.  Not secretly, as timid thieves or skulking smugglers--not in companies and associations, like money chafferers or stock jobbers --not separately and individually, as if this was ours and not our country's cause--but openly, fairly, fearlessly, and unitedly, as becomes a free, sovereign and independent people.  Does timidity ask WHEN?  We answer NOW!\"  These inflammatory utterances, in South Carolina especially, stirred the Southern heart more or less throughout the whole cotton belt; and the pernicious principles which they embodied found ardent advocates even in the Halls of Congress.  In the Senate, Mr. Hayne, of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7134"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 2 (#0)"],["body","GREAT CONSPIRACY                           Its Origin and History                                   Part 2                                     BY                                 JOHN LOGAN                                  CHAPTER VI.                       THE GREAT CONSPIRACY MATURING.  THE 6th of November, 1860, came and passed; on the 7th, the prevailing conviction that Lincoln would be elected had become a certainty, and before the close of that day, the fact had been heralded throughout the length and breadth of the Republic.  The excitement of the People was unparalleled.  The Republicans of the North rejoiced that at last the great wrong of Slavery was to be placed \"where the People could rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction!\"  The Douglas Democracy, naturally chagrined at the defeat of their great leader, were filled with gloomy forebodings touching the future of their Country; and the Southern Democracy, or at least a large portion of it, openly exulted that at last the long-wished-for opportunity for a revolt of the Slave Power, and a separation of the Slave from the Free States, was at hand.  Especially in South Carolina were the \"Fire-eating\" Southrons jubilant over the event.       [\"South Carolina rejoiced over the election of Lincoln, with      bonfires and processions.\"  p. 172, Arnold's \"Life of Abraham      Lincoln.\"       \"There was great joy in Charleston, and wherever 'Fire Eaters' most      did congregate, on the morning of November 7th.  Men rushed to      shake hands and congratulate each other on the glad tidings of      Lincoln's election.  * * *  Men thronged the streets, talking,      laughing, cheering, like mariners long becalmed on a hateful,      treacherous sea, whom a sudden breeze had swiftly wafted within      sight of their longed-for haven.\"  p. 332, vol. i., Greeley's      American Conflict.]  Meanwhile any number of joint resolutions looking to the calling of a Secession Convention, were introduced in the South Carolina Legislature, sitting at Columbia, having in view Secession contingent upon the \"cooperation\" of the other Slave States, or looking to immediate and \"unconditional\" Secession.  On the evening of November 7th, Edmund Ruffin of Virginia--a Secession fanatic who had come from thence in hot haste--in response to a serenade, declared to the people of Columbia that: \"The defense of the South, he verily believed, was only to be secured through the lead of South Carolina;\" that, \"old as he was, he had come here to join them in that lead;\" and that \"every day delayed, was a day lost to the Cause.\" He acknowledged that Virginia was \"not as ready as South Carolina;\" but declared that \"The first drop of blood spilled on the soil of South Carolina would bring Virginia, and every Southern State, with them.\"  He thought \"it was perhaps better that Virginia, and all other border States, remain quiescent for a time, to serve as a guard against the North.  * * *  By remaining in the Union for a time, she would not only prevent coercive legislation in Congress, but any attempt for our subjugation.\"  That same evening came news that, at Charleston, the Grand Jury of the United States District Court had refused to make any presentments, because of the Presidential vote just cast, which, they said, had \"swept away the last hope for the permanence, for the stability, of the Federal Government of these Sovereign States;\" and that United States District Judge Magrath had resigned his office, saying to the Grand Jury, as he did so: \"In the political history of the United States, an event has happened of ominous import to fifteen Slave-holding States.  The State of which we are citizens has been always understood to have deliberately fixed its purpose whenever that event should happen.  Feeling an assurance of what will be the action of the State, I consider it my duty, without delay, to prepare to obey its wishes.  That preparation is made by the resignation of the office I have held.\"  The news of the resignations of the Federal Collector and District Attorney at Charleston, followed, with an intimation that that of the Sub-Treasurer would soon be forthcoming.  On November 9th, a joint resolution calling an unconditional Secession Convention to meet at Columbia December 17th, was passed by the Senate, and on the 12th of November went through the House; and both of the United States Senators from South Carolina had now resigned their seats in the United States Senate.  Besides all these and many other incitements to Secession was the fact that at Milledgeville, Georgia, Governor Brown had, November 12th, addressed a Georgian Military Convention, affirming \"the right of Secession, and the duty of other Southern States to sustain South Carolina in the step she was then taking,\" and declaring that he \"would like to see Federal troops dare attempt the coercion of a seceding Southern State!  For every Georgian who fell in a conflict thus incited, the lives of two Federal Soldiers should expiate the outrage on State Sovereignty\"--and that the Convention aforesaid had most decisively given its voice for Secession.  It was about this time, however, that Alexander H.  Stephens vainly sought to stem the tide of Secession in his own State, in a speech (November 14) before the Georgia Legislature, in which he declared that Mr. Lincoln \"can do nothing unless he is backed by power in Congress. The House of Representatives is largely in the majority against him.  In the Senate he will also be powerless.  There will be a majority of four against him.\"  He also cogently said: \"Many of us have sworn to support it (the Constitution).  Can we, therefore, for the mere election of a man to the Presidency--and that too, in accordance with the prescribed forms of the Constitution--make a point of resistance to the Government, and, without becoming the breakers of that sacred instrument ourselves, withdraw ourselves from it?  Would we not be in the wrong?\"  But the occasional words of wisdom that fell from the lips of the few far-seeing statesmen of the South, were as chaff before the storm of Disunion raised by the turbulent Fire-eaters, and were blown far from the South, where they might have done some good for the Union cause, away up to the North, where they contributed to aid the success of the contemplated Treason and Rebellion, by lulling many of the people there, into a false sense of security.  Unfortunately, also, even the ablest of the Southern Union men were so tainted with the heretical doctrine of States-Rights, which taught the \"paramount allegiance\" of the citizen to the State, that their otherwise powerful appeals for the preservation of the Union were almost invariably handicapped by the added protestation that in any event--and however they might deplore the necessity--they would, if need be, go with their State, against their own convictions of duty to the National Union.  Hence in this same speech we find that Mr. Stephens destroyed the whole effect of his weighty and logical appeal against Secession from the Union, by adding to it, that, \"Should Georgia determine to go out of the Union I shall bow to the will of her people.  Their cause is my cause, and their destiny is my destiny; and I trust this will be the ultimate course of all.\"--and by further advising the calling of a Convention of the people to decide the matter; thus, in advance, as it were, binding himself hand and foot, despite his previous Union utterances, to do the fell bidding of the most rampant Disunionists.  And thus, in due time, it befell, as we shall see, that this \"saving clause\" in his \"Union speech,\" brought him at the end, not to that posture of patriotic heroism to which he aspired when he adjured his Georgian auditors to \"let us be found to the last moment standing on the deck (of the Republic), with the Constitution of the United States waving over our heads,\" but to that of an imprisoned traitor and defeated rebel against the very Republic and Constitution which he had sworn to uphold and defend!  The action of the South Carolina Legislature in calling an Unconditional Secession Convention, acted among the Southern States like a spark in a train of gunpowder.  Long accustomed to incendiary resolutions of Pro-Slavery political platforms, as embodying the creed of Southern men; committed by those declarations to the most extreme action when, in their judgment, the necessity should arise; and worked up during the Presidential campaign by swarming Federal officials inspired by the fanatical Secession leaders; the entire South only needed the spark from the treasonable torch of South Carolina, to find itself ablaze, almost from one end to the other, with the flames of revolt.  Governor after Governor, in State after State, issued proclamation after proclamation, calling together their respective Legislatures, to consider the situation and whether their respective States should join South Carolina in seceding from the Union.  Kentucky alone, of them all, seemed for a time to keep cool, and look calmly and reasonably through the Southern ferment to the horrors beyond.  In an address issued by Governor Magoffin of that State, to the people, he said:  \"To South Carolina and such other States as may wish to secede from the Union, I would say: The geography of this Country will not admit of a division; the mouth and sources of the Mississippi River cannot be separated without the horrors of Civil War.  We cannot sustain you in this movement merely on account of the election of Mr. Lincoln.  Do not precipitate by premature action into a revolution or Civil War, the consequences of which will be most frightful to all of us.  It may yet be avoided.  There is still hope, faint though it be.  Kentucky is a Border State, and has suffered more than all of you.  * * *  She has a right to claim that her voice, and the voice of reason, and moderation and patriotism shall be heard and heeded "]]]
