This is the stage coach and pretty soon the Indians will shoot at us!\"  \"Teddy Martin! if you're going to do that I'm not going to play!\" stormed Janet. \"You'll make Trouble fall out and get hurt. Come on, Trouble! Let us get out!\" she cried. Nicknack was going quite fast down the hill.  \"Wait till we get to the bottom,\" shouted Ted. \"G'lang there, pony!\" he cried to the goat.  \"Let me out!\" screamed Janet, \"I want to get out.\"  At the foot of the hill Teddy stopped the goat and Janet, taking Trouble with her, got out and walked back to the house.  \"What's the matter now?\" asked Mrs. Martin from the porch where she had come out to get a little fresh air.  \"Ted's playing Wild West in the goat-wagon,\" explained Janet.  \"Oh, Ted! Don't be so rough!\" begged his mother of her little son, who drove up just then.  \"Oh, I'm only playing Indians and stage coach,\" he said. \"You've got to go fast when the Indians are after you!\" and away he rode.  \"He's awful mean!\" declared Janet.  \"I don't know what's come over Ted of late,\" said Mrs. Martin to her husband, who came up the side street just then from his store.  \"What's he been doing?\" asked Mr. Martin.  \"Oh, he's been pretending he was a bucking bronco, like those Uncle Frank has on his ranch, and he tossed Trouble downstairs. But the baby didn't get hurt, fortunately. Now Ted's playing Wild West stagecoach with Nicknack and Janet got frightened and wouldn't ride.\"  \"Hum, I see,\" said Ted's father slowly. \"Our boy is getting older, I guess. He needs rougher play. Well, I think I've just the very thing to suit him, and perhaps Janet and all of us.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Mrs. Martin, as her husband drew a letter from his pocket.  \"This is an invitation from Uncle Frank for all of us to come out to his ranch in Montana for the summer,\" was the answer. \"We have been talking of going, you know, and now is a good chance. I can leave the store for a while, and I think it would do us all good--the children especially--to go West. So if you'd like it, well pack up and go.\"  \"Go where?\" asked Ted, driving around near the veranda in time to hear his father's last words.  \"Out to Uncle Frank's ranch,\" said Mr. Martin.  \"How would you like that?\" added his mother.  \"Could we have ponies to ride?\" asked Ted.  \"Yes, I think so.\"  \"Oh, what fun!\" cried Janet. \"I love a pony!\"  \"You'd be afraid of them!\" exclaimed Ted.  \"I would not! If they didn't jump up and down the way you did with Trouble on your back I wouldn't be afraid.\"  \"Pooh! that's the way bucking broncos always do, don't they, Daddy? I'm going to have a bronco!\"  \"Well, well see when we get there,\" said Daddy Martin. \"But since you all seem to like it, we'll go out West.\"  \"Can we take Nicknack?\" asked Teddy.  \"You won't need him if you have a pony,\" his father suggested.  \"No, that's so. Hurray! What fun we'll have!\"  \"Are there any Indians out there?\" asked Janet.  \"Well, a few, I guess,\" her father answered. \"But they're docile Indians--not wild. They won't hurt you. Now let's go in and talk about it.\"  The Curlytops asked all sorts of questions of their father about Uncle Frank's ranch, but though he could tell them, in a general way, what it looked like, Mr. Martin did not really know much about the place, as he had never been there.  \"But you'll find lots of horses, ponies and cattle there,\" he said.  \"And can we take Nicknack with us, to ride around the ranch?\" asked Jan, in her turn.  \"Oh, you won't want to do that,\" her father said. \"You'll have ponies to ride, I think.\"  \"What'll we do with Nicknack then?\" asked Ted.  \"We'll have to leave him with some neighbor until we come back,\" answered his father. \"I was thinking of asking Mr. Newton to take care of him. Bob Newton is a kind boy and he wouldn't harm your goat.\"  \"Yes, Bob is a good boy,\" agreed Teddy. \"I'd like him to have Nicknack.\"  \"Then, if it is all right with Mr. Newton, well take the goat over a few days before we leave for the West,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Bob will have a chance to get used to Nicknack, and Nicknack to him, before we go away.\"  \"Nicknack not come wif us?\" asked Trouble, not quite understanding what the talk was about.  \"No, we'll leave Nicknack here,\" said his father, as he cuddled the little fellow up in his lap. Trouble said nothing more just then but, afterward, Ted remembered that Baby William seemed to be thinking pretty hard about something.  A few days later, when some of the trunks had been partly packed, ready for the trip West, Mr. Martin came home early from the store and said to Jan and Ted:  \"I think you'd better get your goat ready now and take him over to Bob's house. I spoke to Mr. Newton about it, and he said there was plenty of room in his stable for a goat Bob is delighted to have him.\"  \"But hell give him back to us when we come home, won't he?\" asked Janet.  \"Oh, yes, of course! You won't lose your goat,\" said her father with a laugh.  But when they went out to the stable to harness Nicknack to the wagon, Ted and Janet rubbed their eyes and looked again.  \"Why, Nicknack is gone!\" exclaimed Ted.  \"He is,\" agreed his sister. \"Maybe Bob came and got him.\"  \"No, he wouldn't do that without telling us,\" went on Ted. \"I wonder where that goat is?\"  He looked around the stable yard and in the barn. No Nicknack was in sight.  When the Curlytops were searching they heard their mother calling to them from the house, where their father was waiting for them to come up with Nicknack. He was going over to Mr. Newton's with them.  \"Ho, Ted! Janet! Where are you?\" called Mrs. Martin.  \"Out here, Mother!\" Teddy answered.  \"Is Trouble there with you?\"  \"Trouble? No, he isn't here!\"  \"He isn't!\" exclaimed his mother. \"Where in the world can he be? Nora says she saw him going out to the barn a little while ago. Please find him!\"  \"Huh!\" exclaimed Ted. \"Trouble is gone and so is Nicknack! I s'pose they've gone together!\"  \"Well have to look,\" said Janet.     CHAPTER III  OFF FOR THE WEST   The Curlytops hurried toward the house, leaving open the empty little stable in which Nicknack was usually kept. They found their father and their mother looking around in the yard, Mrs. Martin had a worried air.  \"Couldn't you find him?\" asked Daddy Martin.  \"We didn't look--very much,\" answered Teddy. \"Nicknack is gone, and--\"  \"Nicknack gone!\" cried Mrs. Martin. \"I wonder if that little tyke of ours has gotten into trouble with him.\"  \"Nicknack wouldn't make any trouble,\" declared Jan. \"He's such a nice goat--\"  \"Yes, I know!\" said Mrs. Martin quickly. \"But it looks very much as though Trouble and Nicknack had gone off together. Is the goat's harness in the stable?\"  \"We didn't look,\" answered Teddy.  \"The wagon's gone,\" Janet said. \"I looked under the shed for that and it wasn't there.\"  \"Then I can just about guess what has happened,\" said Daddy Martin. \"Trouble heard as talking about taking Nicknack over to Mr. Newton's house, where he would be kept while we are at Uncle Frank's ranch, and the little fellow has just about taken the goat over himself.\"  \"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Mrs. Martin. \"Trouble couldn't hitch the goat to the wagon and drive off with him.\"  \"Oh, yes he could, Mother!\" said Teddy. \"He's seen me and Janet hitch Nicknack up lots of times, and he's helped, too. At first he got the straps all crooked, but I showed him how to do it, and I guess he could 'most hitch the goat up himself now all alone.\"  \"Then that's what he's done,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Come on, Curlytops, we'll go over to Mr. Newton's and get Trouble.\"  \"I hope you find him all right,\" said Mrs. Martin, with a sigh.  \"Oh, we'll find him all right--don't worry,\" her husband answered.  Laughing among themselves at the trick Trouble had played, Janet, Teddy and Mr. Martin started for the home of Mr. Newton, which was three or four long streets away, toward the edge of the town.  On the way they looked here and there, in the yards of houses where the children often went to play.  \"For,\" said Mr. Martin, \"it might be possible that when Trouble found he could drive Nicknack, which he could do, as the goat is very gentle, he might have stopped on the way to play.\"  \"Yes, he might,\" said Jan. \"He's so cute!\"  But there was no sign of the little boy, nor the goat, either.  Finally Mr. Newton's house was reached. Into the yard rushed Janet and Teddy, followed by their father. Bob Newton was making a kite on the side porch.  \"Hello, Curlytop!\" he called to Ted. \"Want to help me fly this? It's going to be a dandy!\"  \"Yes, I'll help you,\" agreed Ted. \"But is he here?\"  \"Who here?\" asked Bob, in some surprise.  \"Nicknack, our goat,\" answered Teddy.  \"What! Is he lost?\" exclaimed Bob in some dismay, for he was counting on having much fun with the goat when the Curlytops went West.  \"Nicknack--\" began Ted.  \"Have you seen Trouble?\" broke in Janet.  \"Is he lost, too?\" Bob inquired. \"Say, I guess--\"  \"Our goat and little boy seem to have gone off together,\" explained Mr. Martin to Mrs. Newton who came out on the porch just then. \"We'd been talking before Trouble about bringing Nicknack over here, and now that both are missing we thought maybe Baby William had brought the goat over himself.\"  \"Why, no, he isn't here,\" said Mrs. Newton slowly. \"You didn't see anything of Trouble and the goat, did you?\" she asked her son.  \"No. I've been here making the kite all morning, and I'd have seen Nicknack all right, and Trouble, too, if they had come here.\"  \"Well, that's funny!\" exclaimed Mr. Martin. \"I wonder where he can have gone?\"  \"Maybe Nicknack ran away with him,\" suggested Bob.  \"Oh, don't say such things!\" exclaimed his mother.  \"I don't think that can have happened,\" returned Mr. Martin, \"Nicknack is a very gentle goat, and Trouble is used to playing with him all alone. He never yet has been hurt. Of course we are not sure that the two went away together. Trouble disappeared from the house, and he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6814"],["title","The Curlytops at Uncle Frank's Ranch; Or, Little Folks on Ponyback (#3)"],["body"," last seen going toward the stable.  \"When Ted and Jan went out to get Nicknack he was gone, too, and so was the wagon and harness. So we just thought Trouble might have driven his pet over here.\"  \"Yes, I think it likely that the two went away together,\" said Mrs. Newton; \"but they're not here. Bob, put away that kite of yours and help Mr. Martin and the Curlytops look for Trouble. He may have gone to Mrs. Simpson's,\" she went on. \"He's often there you know.\"  \"Yes, but we looked in their yard coming over,\" put in Ted. \"Trouble wasn't there.\"  \"That's strange,\" murmured Bob's mother. \"Well, he can't be far, that's sure, and he can't get lost. Everybody in town knows him and the goat, and he's sure to be seen sooner or later.\"  \"I guess so,\" agreed Mr. Martin. \"His mother was a little worried, though.\"  \"Yes, I should think she would be. It's horrible to have anything happen to your children--or fear it may. I'll take off my apron and help you look.\"  \"Oh, don't bother,\" said Mr. Martin. \"We'll find him all right.\" But Mrs. Newton insisted on joining the search.  There was a barn on the Newton place--a barn in which Bob was counting on keeping Nicknack--and this place was first searched lest, perchance, Trouble might have slipped in there with the goat without anyone having seen him, having come up through a back alley.  But there was no goat inside; and Bob, the Curlytops, Mr. Martin and Mrs. Newton came out again, and looked up and down the street.  \"I'll tell you what we'd better do,\" said Bob's mother. \"Ted, you come with Bob and me. You know Trouble's ways, and where he would be most likely to go. Let Janet go with her father, and we'll go up and down the street, inquiring in all the houses we come to. Your little brother is sure to be near one of them.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" said Mr. Martin. \"Jan, you come with me. I expect your mother will be along any minute now. She won't wait at home long for us if we don't come back with Trouble.\"  So the two parties started on the search, one up and the other down the street. Bob, Teddy and Mrs. Newton inquired at a number of houses, but no one in them had seen Trouble and Nicknack that day. Nor did Janet and her father get any trace of the missing ones.  \"I wonder where he is,\" murmured Teddy, and he was beginning to feel afraid that something had happened to Trouble.  \"Let's go down the back street,\" suggested Bob. \"You know there's quite a lot of wagons and automobiles go along this main street where we've been looking. Maybe if Trouble hitched up Nicknack and went for a ride he'd turn down the back street 'cause it's quieter.\"  \"Yes, he may have done that,\" agreed Mrs. Newton.  So down the back street the three went. There were several vacant lots on this street and as the grass in them was high--tall enough to hide a small boy and a goat and wagon--Bob said they had better look in these places.  This they did. There was nothing in the first two vacant lots, but in the third--after they had stopped at one or two houses and had not found the missing ones--Teddy suddenly cried out:  \"Hark!\"  \"What'd you hear?\" asked Bob.  \"I thought I heard a goat bleating,\" was the answer.  \"Listen!\" whispered Mrs. Newton.  They kept quiet, and then through the air came the sound:  \"Baa-a-a-a-a!\"  \"That's Nicknack!\" cried Teddy, rushing forward.  \"I hope your little brother is there, too,\" said Mrs. Newton.  And Trouble was. When they got to the lower end of the vacant lot there, in a tangle of weeds, was the goat-wagon, and Nicknack was in a tangle of harness fast to it.  \"Look at Trouble!\" cried Teddy.  There lay the little fellow, sound asleep in the goat-wagon, his head pillowed on his arm, while Nicknack was bleating now and then between the bites of grass and weeds he was eating.  \"Oh, Trouble!\" cried Mrs. Newton as she took him up in her arms.  \"Yes--dis me--I's Trouble,\" was the sleepy response. \"Oh, 'lo, Teddy,\" he went on as he saw his brother. \"'Lo, Bob. You come to find me?\"  \"I should say we _did_!\" cried Bob. \"What are you doing here?\"  \"Havin' wide,\" was the answer. \"Everybody go 'way--out West--I not have a goat den. I no want Nicknack to go 'way.\"  \"Oh, I see what he means!\" exclaimed Teddy, after thinking over what his little brother said. \"He heard us talking about bringing Nicknack over to your house, Bob, to keep him for us. Trouble likes the goat and I guess he didn't want to leave him behind. Maybe he thought he could drive him away out to Montana, to Uncle Frank's ranch.\"  \"Maybe,\" agreed Bob. \"That'd be a long drive, though.\"  \"I should say so!\" agreed Mrs. Newton. \"But I guess you're right, Teddy. Your little brother started off to hide the goat and wagon so you couldn't leave it behind. He's a funny baby, all right!\"  \"And look how he harnessed him!\" exclaimed Bob.  Nicknack really wasn't harnessed. The leather straps and the buckles were all tangled up on him, but Trouble had managed to make enough of them stick on the goat's back, and had somehow got part of the harness fast to the wagon, so Nicknack could pull it along.  \"I had a nice wide,\" said Trouble, as Bob and Teddy straightened out the goat's harness. \"Den I got sleepy an' Nicknack he got hungry, so we comed in here.\"  \"And we've been looking everywhere for you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Newton. \"Well, I'm glad we've found you. Come along, now. Ted, you and Bob hurry along and tell the others. Your mother'll be worried.\"  And indeed Mrs. Martin was worried, especially when she met Mr. Martin and Janet, who had not found Trouble.  But Teddy and Bob soon met with the other searchers and told them that Baby \"William had been found.  \"Oh, what will you do next?\" cried Mrs. Martin, as she clasped the little fellow in her arms. \"Such a fright as you've given us!\"  \"No want Nicknack to go 'way!\" said Trouble.  \"I guess that's what he did it for--he thought he could hide the goat so we wouldn't leave him behind,\" said Daddy Martin. \"But we'll have to, just the same. Trouble won't miss him when we get out on the ranch.\"  So the goat and wagon were left at Bob's house, and though Trouble cried when he realized what was happening, he soon got over it.  The next few days were filled with busy preparations toward going West. Daddy Martin bought the tickets, the packing was completed, last visits to their playmates were paid by Janet and Teddy, whose boy and girl friends all said that they wished they too were going out West to a big ranch.  \"We're going to see cowboys and Indians!\" Ted told everyone.  Then came the last day in Cresco--that is the last day for some time for the Curlytops. The house was closed, Nora going to stay with friends. Skyrocket, the dog, and Turnover, the cat, were sent to kind neighbors, who promised to look after them. Bob had already started to take care of Nicknack.  \"All aboard!\" called the conductor of the train the Curlytops and the others took. \"All aboard!\"  \"All aboard for the West!\" echoed Daddy Martin, and they were off.     CHAPTER IV  THE COLLISION   \"Won't we have fun, Jan, when we get to the ranch?\"  \"I guess so, Teddy. But I don't like it about those Indians.\"  \"Oh, didn't you hear Daddy say they were tame ones--like the kind in the circus and Wild West show? They won't hurt you, Jan.\"  \"Well, I don't like 'em. They've got such funny painted faces.\"  \"Not the tame ones, Jan. Anyhow I'll stay with you.\"  The Curlytops were talking as they sat together in the railroad car which was being pulled rapidly by the engine out toward the big West, where Uncle Frank's ranch was. In the seat behind them was Mother Martin, holding Trouble, who was asleep, while Daddy Martin was also slumbering.  It was quite a long ride from Cresco to Rockville, which was in Montana. It would take the Curlytops about four days to make the trip, perhaps longer if the trains were late. But they did not mind, for they had comfortable coaches in which to travel. When they were hungry there was the dining-car where they could get something to eat, and when they were sleepy there was the sleeping-car, in which the colored porter made such funny little beds out of the seats.  Jan and Ted thought it quite wonderful. For, though they had traveled in a sleeping-car before, and had seen the porter pull out the seats, let down the shelf overhead and take out the blankets and pillows to make the bed, still they never tired of watching.  There were many other things to interest the Curlytops and Trouble on this journey to Uncle Frank's ranch. Of course there was always something to see when they looked out of the windows of the cars. At times the train would pass through cities, stopping at the stations to let passengers get off and on. But it was not the cities that interested the children most. They liked best to see the fields and woods through which they passed.  In some of the fields were horses, cows or sheep, and while the children did not see any such animals in the woods, except perhaps where the wood was a clump of trees near a farm, they always hoped they might.  Very often, when the train would rattle along through big fields, and then suddenly plunge into a forest, Jan would call:  \"Maybe we'll see one now, Ted!\"  \"Oh, maybe so!\" he would exclaim.  Then the two Curlytops would flatten their noses against the window and peer out.  \"What are you looking for?\" asked Mother Martin, the first time she saw the children do this.  \"Indians,\" answered Teddy, never turning around, for the train was still in the wood and he did not want to miss any chance.  \"Indians!\" exclaimed his mother, \"Why, what in the world put into your head the idea that we should see Indians?\"  \"Well, Uncle Frank said there were Indians out West, even if they weren't wild ones,\" answered Teddy, \"and me and Jan wants to see some.\"  \"Oh, you won't find any Indians around _here_,\" said Daddy Martin with a laugh, as he laid aside the paper he was reading. \"It is true there are some out West, but we are not there yet, and, if we were, you"]]]
