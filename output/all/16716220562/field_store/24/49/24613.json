The ground to be patrolled by the sentries is divided into three parts, each of which is entrusted to one man.  Kennedy was one of the ten privates, and his first spell of sentry-go began at eleven o'clock.  On this night there was no moon. It was as black as pitch. It is always unpleasant to be on sentry-go on such a night. The mind wanders, in spite of all effort to check it, through a long series of all the ghastly stories one has ever read. There is one in particular of Conan Doyle's about a mummy that came to life and chased people on lonely roads--but enough! However courageous one may be, it is difficult not to speculate on the possible horrors which may spring out on one from the darkness. That feeling that there is somebody--or something--just behind one can only be experienced in all its force by a sentry on an inky night at camp. And the thought that, of all the hundreds there, he and two others are the only ones awake, puts a sort of finishing touch to the unpleasantness of the situation.  Kennedy was not a particularly imaginative youth, but he looked forward with no little eagerness to the time when he should be relieved. It would be a relief in two senses of the word. His beat included that side of the camp which faces the road to Aldershot. Between camp and this road is a ditch and a wood. After he had been on duty for an hour this wood began to suggest a variety of possibilities, all grim. The ditch, too, was not without associations. It was into this that Private Jones had been hurled on a certain memorable occasion. Such a thing was not likely to happen again in the same week, and, even if it did, Kennedy flattered himself that he would have more to say in the matter than Private Jones had had; but nevertheless he kept a careful eye in that direction whenever his beat took him along the ditch.  It was about half-past twelve, and he had entered upon the last section of his two hours, when Kennedy distinctly heard footsteps in the wood. He had heard so many mysterious sounds since his patrol began at eleven o'clock that at first he was inclined to attribute this to imagination. But a crackle of dead branches and the sound of soft breathing convinced him that this was the real thing for once, and that, as a sentry of the Public Schools' Camp on duty, it behoved him to challenge the unknown.  He stopped and waited, peering into the darkness in a futile endeavour to catch a glimpse of his man. But the night was too black for the keenest eye to penetrate it. A slight thud put him on the right track. It showed him two things; first, that the unknown had dropped into the ditch, and, secondly, that he was a camp man returning to his tent after an illegal prowl about the town at lights-out. Nobody save one belonging to the camp would have cause to cross the ditch.  Besides, the man walked warily, as one not ignorant of the danger of sentries. The unknown had crawled out of the ditch now. As luck would have it he had chosen a spot immediately opposite to where Kennedy stood. Now that he was nearer Kennedy could see the vague outline of him.  \"Who goes there?\" he said.  From an instinctive regard for the other's feelings he did not shout the question in the regulation manner. He knew how he would feel himself if he were out of camp at half-past twelve, and the voice of the sentry were to rip suddenly through the silence _fortissimo_.  As it was, his question was quite loud enough to electrify the person to whom it was addressed. The unknown started so violently that he nearly leapt into the air. Kennedy was barely two yards from him when he spoke.  The next moment this fact was brought home to him in a very practical manner. The unknown, sighting the sentry, perhaps more clearly against the dim whiteness of the tents than Kennedy could sight him against the dark wood, dashed in with a rapidity which showed that he knew something of the art of boxing. Kennedy dropped his rifle and flung up his arm. He was altogether too late. A sudden blaze of light, and he was on the ground, sick and dizzy, a feeling he had often experienced before in a slighter degree, when sparring in the Eckleton gymnasium with the boxing instructor.  The immediate effect of a flush hit in the regions about the jaw is to make the victim lose for the moment all interest in life. Kennedy lay where he had fallen for nearly half a minute before he fully realised what it was that had happened to him. When he did realise the situation, he leapt to his feet, feeling sick and shaky, and staggered about in all directions in a manner which suggested that he fancied his assailant would be waiting politely until he had recovered. As was only natural, that wily person had vanished, and was by this time doing a quick change into garments of the night. Kennedy had the satisfaction of knowing--for what it was worth--that his adversary was in one of those tents, but to place him with any greater accuracy was impossible.  So he gave up the search, found his rifle, and resumed his patrol. And at one o'clock his successor relieved him.  On the following day camp broke up.         *       *       *       *       *  Kennedy always enjoyed going home, but, as he travelled back to Eckleton on the last day of these summer holidays, he could not help feeling that there was a great deal to be said for term. He felt particularly cheerful. He had the carriage to himself, and he had also plenty to read and eat. The train was travelling at forty miles an hour. And there were all the pleasures of a first night after the holidays to look forward to, when you dashed from one friend's study to another's, comparing notes, and explaining--five or six of you at a time--what a good time you had had in the holidays. This was always a pleasant ceremony at Blackburn's, where all the prefects were intimate friends, and all good sorts, without that liberal admixture of weeds, worms, and outsiders which marred the list of prefects in most of the other houses. Such as Kay's! Kennedy could not restrain a momentary gloating as he contrasted the state of affairs in Blackburn's with what existed at Kay's. Then this feeling was merged in one of pity for Fenn's hard case. How he must hate the beginning of term, thought Kennedy.  All the well-known stations were flashing by now. In a few minutes he would be at the junction, and in another half-hour back at Blackburn's. He began to collect his baggage from the rack.  Nobody he knew was at the junction. This was the late train that he had come down by. Most of the school had returned earlier in the afternoon.  He reached Blackburn's at eight o'clock, and went up to his study to unpack. This was always his first act on coming back to school. He liked to start the term with all his books in their shelves, and all his pictures and photographs in their proper places on the first day. Some of the studies looked like lumber-rooms till near the end of the first week.  He had filled the shelves, and was arranging the artistic decorations, when Jimmy Silver came in. Kennedy had been surprised that he had not met him downstairs, but the matron had answered his inquiry with the statement that he was talking to Mr Blackburn in the other part of the house.  \"When did you arrive?\" asked Silver, after the conclusion of the first outbreak of holiday talk.  \"I've only just come.\"  \"Seen Blackburn yet?\"  \"No. I was thinking of going up after I had got this place done properly.\"  Jimmy Silver ran his eye over the room.  \"I haven't started mine yet,\" he said. \"You're such an energetic man. Now, are all those books in their proper places?\"  \"Yes,\" said Kennedy.  \"Sure?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How about the pictures? Got them up?\"  \"All but this lot here. Shan't be a second. There you are. How's that for effect?\"  \"Not bad. Got all your photographs in their places?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then,\" said Jimmy Silver, calmly, \"you'd better start now to pack them all up again. And why, my son? Because you are no longer a Blackburnite. That's what.\"  Kennedy stared.  \"I've just had the whole yarn from Blackburn,\" continued Jimmy Silver. \"Our dear old pal, Mr Kay, wanting somebody in his house capable of keeping order, by way of a change, has gone to the Old Man and borrowed you. So _you're_ head of Kay's now. There's an honour for you.\"     IX  THE SENSATIONS OF AN EXILE   \"What\" shouted Kennedy.  He sprang to his feet as if he had had an electric shock.  Jimmy Silver, having satisfied his passion for the dramatic by the abruptness with which he had exploded his mine, now felt himself at liberty to be sympathetic.  \"It's quite true,\" he said. \"And that's just how I felt when Blackburn told me. Blackburn's as sick as anything. Naturally he doesn't see the point of handing you over to Kay. But the Old Man insisted, so he caved in. He wanted to see you as soon as you arrived. You'd better go now. I'll finish your packing.\"  This was noble of Jimmy, for of all the duties of life he loathed packing most.  \"Thanks awfully,\" said Kennedy, \"but don't you bother. I'll do it when I get back. But what's it all about? What made Kay want a man? Why won't Fenn do? And why me?\"  \"Well, it's easy to see why they chose you. They reflected that you'd had the advantage of being in Blackburn's with me, and seeing how a house really should be run. Kay wants a head for his house. Off he goes to the Old Man. 'Look here,' he says, 'I want somebody shunted into my happy home, or it'll bust up. And it's no good trying to put me off with an inferior article, because I won't have it. It must be somebody who's been trained from youth up by Silver.' 'Then,' says the Old Man, reflectively, 'you can't do better than take Kennedy. I happen to know that Silver has spent years in showing him the straight and narrow path. You take Kennedy.' 'All right,' says Kay; 'I always thought Kennedy a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6879"],["title","The Gold Bat (#0)"],["body","GOLD BAT      by P. G.

I bagged it first.\"  \"My dear chap, I've been waiting here a month.\"  \"When you fellows have _quite_ finished rotting about in front of that bath don't let _me_ detain you.\"  \"Anybody seen that sponge?\"  \"Well, look here\"--this in a tone of compromise--\"let's toss for it.\"  \"All right. Odd man out.\"  All of which, being interpreted, meant that the first match of the Easter term had just come to an end, and that those of the team who, being day boys, changed over at the pavilion, instead of performing the operation at leisure and in comfort, as did the members of houses, were discussing the vital question--who was to have first bath?  The Field Sports Committee at Wrykyn--that is, at the school which stood some half-mile outside that town and took its name from it--were not lavish in their expenditure as regarded the changing accommodation in the pavilion. Letters appeared in every second number of the _Wrykinian_, some short, others long, some from members of the school, others from Old Boys, all protesting against the condition of the first, second, and third fifteen dressing-rooms. \"Indignant\" would inquire acidly, in half a page of small type, if the editor happened to be aware that there was no hair-brush in the second room, and only half a comb. \"Disgusted O. W.\" would remark that when he came down with the Wandering Zephyrs to play against the third fifteen, the water supply had suddenly and mysteriously failed, and the W.Z.'s had been obliged to go home as they were, in a state of primeval grime, and he thought that this was \"a very bad thing in a school of over six hundred boys\", though what the number of boys had to do with the fact that there was no water he omitted to explain. The editor would express his regret in brackets, and things would go on as before.  There was only one bath in the first fifteen room, and there were on the present occasion six claimants to it. And each claimant was of the fixed opinion that, whatever happened subsequently, he was going to have it first. Finally, on the suggestion of Otway, who had reduced tossing to a fine art, a mystic game of Tommy Dodd was played. Otway having triumphantly obtained first innings, the conversation reverted to the subject of the match.  The Easter term always opened with a scratch game against a mixed team of masters and old boys, and the school usually won without any great exertion. On this occasion the match had been rather more even than the average, and the team had only just pulled the thing off by a couple of tries to a goal. Otway expressed an opinion that the school had played badly.  \"Why on earth don't you forwards let the ball out occasionally?\" he asked. Otway was one of the first fifteen halves.  \"They were so jolly heavy in the scrum,\" said Maurice, one of the forwards. \"And when we did let it out, the outsides nearly always mucked it.\"  \"Well, it wasn't the halves' fault. We always got it out to the centres.\"  \"It wasn't the centres,\" put in Robinson. \"They played awfully well. Trevor was ripping.\"  \"Trevor always is,\" said Otway; \"I should think he's about the best captain we've had here for a long time. He's certainly one of the best centres.\"  \"Best there's been since Rivers-Jones,\" said Clephane.  Rivers-Jones was one of those players who mark an epoch. He had been in the team fifteen years ago, and had left Wrykyn to captain Cambridge and play three years in succession for Wales. The school regarded the standard set by him as one that did not admit of comparison. However good a Wrykyn centre three-quarter might be, the most he could hope to be considered was \"the best _since_ Rivers-Jones\". \"Since\" Rivers-Jones, however, covered fifteen years, and to be looked on as the best centre the school could boast of during that time, meant something. For Wrykyn knew how to play football.  Since it had been decided thus that the faults in the school attack did not lie with the halves, forwards, or centres, it was more or less evident that they must be attributable to the wings. And the search for the weak spot was even further narrowed down by the general verdict that Clowes, on the left wing, had played well. With a beautiful unanimity the six occupants of the first fifteen room came to the conclusion that the man who had let the team down that day had been the man on the right--Rand-Brown, to wit, of Seymour's.  \"I'll bet he doesn't stay in the first long,\" said Clephane, who was now in the bath, _vice_ Otway, retired. \"I suppose they had to try him, as he was the senior wing three-quarter of the second, but he's no earthly good.\"  \"He only got into the second because he's big,\" was Robinson's opinion. \"A man who's big and strong can always get his second colours.\"  \"Even if he's a funk, like Rand-Brown,\" said Clephane. \"Did any of you chaps notice the way he let Paget through that time he scored for them? He simply didn't attempt to tackle him. He could have brought him down like a shot if he'd only gone for him. Paget was running straight along the touch-line, and hadn't any room to dodge. I know Trevor was jolly sick about it. And then he let him through once before in just the same way in the first half, only Trevor got round and stopped him. He was rank.\"  \"Missed every other pass, too,\" said Otway.  Clephane summed up.  \"He was rank,\" he said again. \"Trevor won't keep him in the team long.\"  \"I wish Paget hadn't left,\" said Otway, referring to the wing three-quarter who, by leaving unexpectedly at the end of the Christmas term, had let Rand-Brown into the team. His loss was likely to be felt. Up till Christmas Wrykyn had done well, and Paget had been their scoring man. Rand-Brown had occupied a similar position in the second fifteen. He was big and speedy, and in second fifteen matches these qualities make up for a great deal. If a man scores one or two tries in nearly every match, people are inclined to overlook in him such failings as timidity and clumsiness. It is only when he comes to be tried in football of a higher class that he is seen through. In the second fifteen the fact that Rand-Brown was afraid to tackle his man had almost escaped notice. But the habit would not do in first fifteen circles.  \"All the same,\" said Clephane, pursuing his subject, \"if they don't play him, I don't see who they're going to get. He's the best of the second three-quarters, as far as I can see.\"  It was this very problem that was puzzling Trevor, as he walked off the field with Paget and Clowes, when they had got into their blazers after the match. Clowes was in the same house as Trevor--Donaldson's--and Paget was staying there, too. He had been head of Donaldson's up to Christmas.  \"It strikes me,\" said Paget, \"the school haven't got over the holidays yet. I never saw such a lot of slackers. You ought to have taken thirty points off the sort of team you had against you today.\"  \"Have you ever known the school play well on the second day of term?\" asked Clowes. \"The forwards always play as if the whole thing bored them to death.\"  \"It wasn't the forwards that mattered so much,\" said Trevor. \"They'll shake down all right after a few matches. A little running and passing will put them right.\"  \"Let's hope so,\" Paget observed, \"or we might as well scratch to Ripton at once. There's a jolly sight too much of the mince-pie and Christmas pudding about their play at present.\" There was a pause. Then Paget brought out the question towards which he had been moving all the time.  \"What do you think of Rand-Brown?\" he asked.  It was pretty clear by the way he spoke what he thought of that player himself, but in discussing with a football captain the capabilities of the various members of his team, it is best to avoid a too positive statement one way or the other before one has heard his views on the subject. And Paget was one of those people who like to know the opinions of others before committing themselves.  Clowes, on the other hand, was in the habit of forming his views on his own account, and expressing them. If people agreed with them, well and good: it afforded strong presumptive evidence of their sanity. If they disagreed, it was unfortunate, but he was not going to alter his opinions for that, unless convinced at great length that they were unsound. He summed things up, and gave you the result. You could take it or leave it, as you preferred.  \"I thought he was bad,\" said Clowes.  \"Bad!\" exclaimed Trevor, \"he was a disgrace. One can understand a chap having his off-days at any game, but one doesn't expect a man in the Wrykyn first to funk. He mucked five out of every six passes I gave him, too, and the ball wasn't a bit slippery. Still, I shouldn't mind that so much if he had only gone for his man properly. It isn't being out of practice that makes you funk. And even when he did have a try at you, Paget, he always went high.\"  \"That,\" said Clowes thoughtfully, \"would seem to show that he was game.\"  Nobody so much as smiled. Nobody ever did smile at Clowes' essays in wit, perhaps because of the solemn, almost sad, tone of voice in which he delivered them. He was"]]]
