Collins expressed his thanks in elaborate language, but Ned went straight to the Vixen, which was then guarded by a Peruvian Indian.  He was weary of the cheap pretense of the other.  \"This is a peach of a machine,\" the alleged farmer explained, following Ned as he walked about the great planes.  \"See here! No cranking at all!  You just get into the seat, which will carry two nicely, and push this button.  That releases a spring which whirls the propellers until the spark is made, then off you go.\"  Ned admired the arrangement fully, as he was expected to do.  The Nelson was fitted out in the same way, but he did not say so. Presently the Indian left the circle created by the rope and, going into the shelter of the porch, left Collins and Ned with the alleged farmer, who announced that his name was Yerkes.  Ned thought this action on the part of the Indian was in obedience to a signal from Collins, but could not be too sure of it.  Then Collins and Yerkes trailed about after Ned as he wandered around the airship.  The boy saw the former remove certain bits of wood which blocked the wheels of the Vixen, also he saw Yerkes, testing the gasoline gauge and looking the carburetor over carefully.  \"It is all right,\" the boy thought.  \"Two hearts with but a single thought, two souls that beat as one--or the reverse anyway, they are thinking of giving me a ride in this old ice wagon!  Pretty soon they'll be asking me to get up on the seat and see how easy it is. Then one of them will slip this harness about me--the harness provided for timid riders--and I'll be off in the air--a prisoner!\"  Collins and Yerkes tinkered about the aeroplane for some moments, while Ned seemed to be studying the machine.  The boy was anxious for the decisive moment to come.  Finally Yerkes, went back to the porch and stood there in conversation with the Indian for a number of minutes.  When he returned Collins stepped forward toward the seat.  Knowing that the time for action had come, Ned sprang into the driver's seat.  Collins looked vexed at the movement, but Ned laughed down at him.  \"I won't hurt your old machine,\" the boy said.  \"Get up here, so we can see how it rides.\"  Collins obeyed, first giving Yerkes a significant look which was not lost on the watchful boy.  The harness for the visitor's seat was a peculiar one, as Ned had noted with considerable satisfaction.  There were leather cuffs for the wrists and a broad leg band which prevented the guest leaving his seat.  The cuffs held the hands close together in the lap, the idea being to prevent a timid person from grasping the arm of the driver in a moment of terror.  \"Move on over!\" Collins called, as he stepped up, \"and I'll see if I can take you out of the valley without breaking your neck.  Don't say a word to Yerkes about his race with the Nelson,\" he added, in a whisper.  \"He got beaten, and doesn't like to talk about it.\"  Ned noticed but remained where he was, so Collins reluctantly took the other seat.  As he did so Yerkes stepped forward, and the Indian stationed himself at the back of the machine, where he could give it a push down the incline which lay before it, and against which the wheels had been blocked.  As soon as Collins was fairly in the seat, Ned gave the harness a quick snap, and the click of metal told him that the cuffs had closed about Collins' wrists, that the broad strap which held him down was in position.  Then he pushed the button and the spark caught.  The Vixen moved down the incline.  Collins tried to lift his hands, but was unable to do so, so he lifted his voice instead!  Yerkes, in the whirr of the machine, doubtless mistook the voice for that of the boy, for he paid no attention to it.  \"Help!  Help!\" roared Collins.  \"Stop the machine!  He's got me tied down!  Stop it, you fool!  Stop it!\"  Yerkes and the Indian looked stolidly on with grins on their faces, and Ned stuck an elbow into Collins' ribs.  \"Keep still,\" he said, \"or I'll have to put you out of the speech habit.  I've got you just where you expected to get me, and you ought not to kick about the accommodations.\"  \"Yerkes!\" yelled Collins.  \"Why don't you stop the machine?  Catch hold of the propellers and yank them off!  Put a bullet through this young fiend!  Anything to stop the crazy thing.  I tell you he's got me tied in!\"  Then Yerkes, recognizing the voice, sprang toward the propellers. He made a brisk spring, but was too late.  The blades were just about an inch out of his reach.  Foiled in this attempt, he drew a revolver and began firing foolish shots at the machine, none of which came near the mark.  In a moment the Vixen was under full speed, the ground dropped away, and the last Ned saw of Yerkes and the Indian they were performing a dance of rage on the growing vegetables below.  Straight to the south the machine flew, the motors popping like mad.  The boy saw little crowds in the lighted streets below, looking and pointing up at the aeroplane, and then the city streets faded away into a dull mat, and there were only the silent peaks, the sea, and the deep, dim valleys.  Then Ned turned to his prisoner, who had by this time given over the useless struggle against the harness.  Collins' eyes were fixed on the moonlit Pacific, away off to the west, and the boy's eyes followed those of his captive.  A steamer was creeping into the shallow harbor at Calleo, and the dark spot on the sand showed that a crowd was there to greet her. The Vixen was too far away for Ned to see the surf boats getting ready to take off the passengers and freight, but he knew that they were there.  It was now eleven o'clock, and the moon was well up in the sky.  The ribs of the Andes lay like silver in its light.  Strain his eyes as he might, there was no indication of the Nelson.  \"Fine view!\" Ned said, presently, giving Collins a nudge in the ribs with his elbow. \"How do you like it?\"  Thomas Q. Collins was near bursting with rage.  He hitched about in his seat, but to no purpose.  \"What does this mean?\" he finally found words to say, screaming at the top of his voice, for the Vixen was now making good speed.  \"I preferred to be the host rather than the guest,\" the boy said, with a shrug of the shoulders.  \"I don't know what you mean by that,\" Collins replied.  \"You meant to capture me tonight?\" asked Ned.  \"Nothing of the kind!\" roared Collins.  \"You got Leroy and Mike in jail, and you thought you'd burst up this relief expedition by putting me out of the way,\" Ned went on.  \"Now, we'll see who'll be put out of the way.\"  \"What are you here for?\" asked Collins.  \"You know very well,\" replied Ned.  \"But it is too much exertion to talk at this speed.  Wait until we land and I'll tell you all about your intentions!  Understand?  All about your intentions.\"  \"Much you know about them,\" shrieked Collins.  Ned made no reply to this, for, away off to the southeast, he caught sight of the dipping lights of an airship which might or might not be the Nelson.     CHAPTER VII  THE BLACK BEAR IN TROUBLE   One still night on the Amazon Jack Bosworth got out a map and turned a flashlight on it.  Frank and Harry stood looking over his shoulder.  \"Right here,\" Jack said, presently, \"is where we leave the main stream of the Amazon and take to the Madeira.\"  \"How do you know that stream is the Madeira?\" asked Frank.  \"We have passed so many large tributaries that I'm all mixed up.\"  \"And why not try some other stream?\" Harry questioned.  \"I've heard that the Madeira is full of falls and rapids.\"  \"Anyway,\" Jack insisted, \"it takes us away up into the Andes, almost to Lake Titicaca, and that's all any stream will do.  As for the falls and rapids, do you expect any stream to creep down from that great plateau without jumping off occasionally?\"  \"All right,\" Frank cut in.  \"Go your own way to destruction!  But how do you know that rippling sheet of water off there,\" swinging an arm to the south, \"is the Madeira river?  It looks like a lake to me.\"  \"I found out while you were asleep this morning,\" Jack replied.  \"A chap came along in a launch and I asked him all about it.  He said he had just come from the Andes, and advised me to turn back.\"  \"Kind-hearted little fellow, eh?\" laughed Harry.  \"He wasn't very little,\" answered Jack.  \"He was six feet two, and was coming out with a finger off and a cut across a cheek bone which will last him for a spell, I guess.  He cut his finger off because a poisoned arrow struck it.\"  \"Cannibals?\" asked Harry, with a laugh.  \"The same,\" replied Jack.  \"Said they chased him for miles.\"  \"We'll curb their appetites with lead,\" Harry observed.  \"If we see them first,\" added Jack.  So the Black Bear was turned into the Madeira river, which is something like seven hundred miles long, and drains the wooded country where the black sheep of the land of Brazil live.  Away up in the hills it is fed by the Beni river, which has its source in the mountains east of Lake Titicaca.   More than once the boys were obliged to haul their motor boat out on a rocky \"bench,\" take it to pieces, carry it and most of the stock around rapids, and then put it together and load up again. Still, they made good time, and on the evening of the third day found themselves at the junction with the Beni river.  They were now in a wild and dangerous country.  The forests swarmed with wild game, the thickets were full of serpents, and the trees were often crowded with monkeys.   For two days they had seen no natives.  This was suspicious as it was certain that they had penetrated to the home of the cannibal tribes so greatly dreaded by hunters and explorers.  It was on the evening of the 21st of August that Jack sent the Black Bear into a little creek, shut off the power, and turned to put up the panels.  It was not very warm, but the atmosphere was sticky and heavy with the breath of the woods.  \"We'll smother in there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6905"],["title","The Boy Aviators in Africa; Or, an Aerial Ivory Trail (#0)"],["body","BOY AVIATORS IN AFRICA  OR  AN AERIAL IVORY TRAIL  By Captain Wilbur Lawton     CONTENTS         I  A REUNION       II  THE STOLEN IVORY      III  THE DARK CONTINENT       IV  THE WITCH-DOCTOR        V  THE POOL OF DEATH       VI  A SNAP-SHOT FIEND IN TROUBLE      VII  A TRAITOR IN CAMP     VIII  A BATTLE IN THE AIR       IX  THE VOICE OF THE MOUNTAIN        X  THE ARAB'S CACHE       XI  THE AGE OF SIKASO      XII  IN THE HANDS OF SLAVE-TRADERS     XIII  GORILLAS--AND AN AERIAL TOW-LINE      XIV  AN ESCAPE--AND WHAT CAME OF IT       XV  THE FLYING MEN      XVI  FOOLING AN ARAB CHIEF     XVII  THE \"ROGUE\" ELEPHANT    XVIII  A LINK FROM THE PAST      XIX  FRIENDS IN NEED       XX  THE SMOKE READER      XXI  THE CHUMS RESCUED BY AEROPLANE     XXII  LUTHER BARR'S TRICK    XXIII  ABOARD \"THE BRIGAND\"     XXIV  THE BOY AVIATORS HOLD A WINNING HAND     CHAPTER I  A REUNION   \"Here, Harry, catch hold.\"  \"Ouch--I dropped that cartridge box on my pet corn.\"  \"Say, you fellows, are we going to Africa or are we on a Coney Island picnic?\"  \"Be serious now, Billy Barnes, you may be all right as a reporter, but as a shipping clerk you're no more good than a cold storage egg.\"  \"Well, I'm doing the best I can,\" was the indignant reply, \"here--I've got it all down: Box 10--  One waterproof tent, one rubber-blanket, tent-pegs, ropes, more ropes.--Say, Frank, what in the name of the 'London Times' and jumping horn-toads do you want so much rope for?\"  \"To tie up a certain young reporter named William Barnes when he gets too fresh,\" was the laughing reply.  The three boys sat about a heaped, confused collection of ammunition, cooking-utensils, rifles, and camp \"duffle\" in general, one evening late in May.  The eldest of the group, a sunny-faced, clear eyed lad of about sixteen, held in his hand a notebook from which he called out the inventory of the articles piled about him as his brother, a youth of fourteen, sorted them out.  The third member of the trio was a short, stocky chap of possibly seventeen, with sharp, blue eyes that gleamed behind a pair of huge spectacles.  He was examining a camera with care; from time to time turning his attention to an open notebook that lay beside him in which he was supposed to be entering the list as the other called it off.  The place where the boys were busying themselves was the upper floor of a large garage in the rear of the Chester residence, on Madison Avenue, New York City, which had been turned into a workshop for the two young Chesters--Frank and Harry--already well known to our readers as The Boy Aviators.  The well set-up lad who was so industriously calling off the equipment that lay scattered about was Frank Chester, and the ready classifier of the mixed-up outfit was Harry, his younger brother.  The third member of the group was Billy Barnes, the young reporter, already down to us as the chronicler of the Chester boys' adventures in Nicaragua and the depths of the Everglades of Florida.  Since the boys' return from Florida on the U. S. torpedo boat, the Tarantula, they had been busy putting into shape the rough working plans of the African hunting expedition they had planned as a sort of vacation.  The ample bonus the government had awarded them for their singularly clever work in rescuing Lieutenant Chapin, the inventor of Chapinite, by their aeroplane Golden Eagle II, had supplied them with ample funds for their trip.  As for Billy Barnes (or \"Our Special Staff Correspondent, William Barnes,\" as he was now known), besides the sum realized from the sale of the rubies the boys found in the Quesal Cave in Nicaragua, the money the youthful scribe had made on writing up the boys' Florida adventures had provided him with a good fat nest-egg.  The natural stimulus given to the red-blooded Chester boys by Mr. Roosevelt's hunting adventures had a good deal to do, with their resolution to go to Africa.  And now--after several weeks of work on getting together as good an outfit as was procurable--they were putting what Billy called \"the finishing touches\" on their accoutrements.  Stacked in corners of the room were big chests painted blue and marked with the boys' names and neatly numbered in white painted characters.  These cases contained the different sections of the Golden Eagle II, the aeroplane equipped with wireless, that had made history in Florida.  There were twenty of these cases besides the ones labeled \"Camp Outfit,\" \"Medical,\" \"Armory Chest,\" \"Grub Chest,\" and several nondescript ones containing the odds and ends that an expedition of the kind they planned would find indispensable.  In some smaller boxes also were packed yards and yards of bright-colored cloth and calico, spangles, cheap jewelry and brass ornaments for use among the natives.  In making up their outfit the boys had taken the advice of a well-known African traveler who had retired from his adventurous life to purchase a place in New Jersey, where he intended to spend his remain days.  Through a mutual friend the boys obtained an introduction to him and his advice in selecting the outfit had been simply invaluable.   \"Go easy, carry lots of quinine, don't waste ammunition, and count ten before you pick a quarrel with a native,\" had been his simply laid-down rules for getting along in Africa, and these rules the boys had determined to adhere to strictly.  \"Say, is this going to be a hunting trip or an invasion of Africa?\" inquired Billy, quizzically as Harry sorted out and Frank read off ceaselessly the apparently interminable inventory of the supplies of the Chester party.  \"I'm getting writer's cramp.\"  \"A hunting party of course,\" laughed Frank, \"but you know that hunters who go into the bush depending on their rifles usually come out a good deal thinner than when they went in.  \"That's so,\" assented Billy, \"but when we have a sixty-mile aeroplane like the Golden Eagle II we can easily fly out to civilization in case of necessity.\"  \"Yes, if we have enough gasoline,\" assented Harry, \"but how much can we carry into the bush?\"  \"Just enough for our purposes and no more,\" replied Frank, readily, \"fortunately the soluble tablets of picric and glycerine will help out our supply materially.  A few of these tablets dissolved in gasoline render the efficiency of one ordinary gallon equal to three; but I don't care to use them except in a case of absolute necessity as they are very hard on an engine.\"  \"Then we can count on every gallon we carry being of triple efficiency?\" asked Billy.  \"Certainly,\" replied Frank, who had invented the tablets in question, and which were an extremely useful addition to the equipment of the modern aviator.  As the boys worked on and the equipment, as it was classified, was packed away in the cases assigned to each class of articles, there came a sharp knock at the door of the garage building and a servant entered with a special delivery letter to Frank.  The boy tore it open eagerly and then gave a low whistle of astonishment.  \"Read it out, Harry,\" he said, handing the missive to his brother. \"It concerns all of us.\"  Harry took it and read as follows:  DEAR FRANK AND HARRY:  Shall be in town to-morrow morning with my father and Mr. Luther Barr, the well-known ivory importer.  He has a communication of importance for you.  What it is I am afraid to trust to writing, but you will know full details when you see us.  Will you call at the Waldorf at ten-thirty and have breakfast?  We can discuss the matter over the meal.  All I can say now is that if the Golden Eagle is still in shape for her old-time stunts there is work ahead of her that will prove harder than anything she has yet tackled.  However, I know you are not the chaps to balk at a little danger--particularly when exciting adventures are in the wind.  So long, then, till to-morrow:                          \"LATHROP EASLEY\"  \"Well, what do you know about that?\" gasped Billy Barnes, \"here we are fixing up for a nice little holiday trip to rest our shattered nerves, and here comes, a job along that looks as if we should have to work all summer.\"  \"It certainly is curious,\" replied Frank musingly.  \"What can Lathrop mean?  Who is Luther Barr?  I have heard the name but I cannot place him.\"  \"Lathrop says he is an ivory importer,\" suggested Harry.  \"Easy to find out,\" said the resourceful Billy.  \"Where's the 'phone book?\"  Frank handed the volume to him from its hook beside the instrument.  \"Ah--here we are,\" exclaimed Billy, as he ran his finger triumphantly down the \"B\" list.  \"Barr, Luther--that's our man, eh?  Ivory importer, offices No. 42 Wall Street--home, White Plains.\"  \"White Plains, that's where Lathrop's folks live,\" exclaimed Harry. \"That's where he first became associated with the Golden Eagle.\"  \"And turned out to be a good partner,\" added Frank.  \"A jim dandy,\" agreed Billy.  \"I tell you boys, I've got a good nose for news and if there isn't some sort of a story back of Mr. Luther Barr and Lathrop's letter I'll eat my hat without sauce.\"  Any acceptance of the young reporter's generous offer was interrupted by a sudden noise in the usually quiet street.  \"I tell you the fare's a dollar!\" the boys heard an angry voice declaim.  \"'Tain't nothing of the kind or I'm a lubber--fifty cents is all I'll pay.  I'll be horn-swoggled if you get a cent more, yer deep-sea pirate,\" was the indignant phrased reply.  Something in the voice was strangely familiar but the \"horn-swoggled\" settled it.  \"Ben Stubbs,\" gasped all the boys simultaneously and rushed out of the garage to the street.  Here they found a stoutly-built, crisp-bearded man with a face tanned to what Billy called a \"weathered oak finish,\" arguing loudly with a taxicab chauffeur.  The man was obdurate over his fare and just at, the boys came on the scene was suggesting that his equally determined passenger get back in the cab and take a ride to the police station.  \"The sergeant will settle our dispute,\" he said angrily.  \"What's the trouble, Ben?\""]]]
