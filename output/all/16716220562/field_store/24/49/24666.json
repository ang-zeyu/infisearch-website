And the mountains and the sea stretched away endlessly, and earth took on the look of a great rug woven with invisible stripes.  Up, up, up, until the air became thin and the lungs staggered for breath.  Then the motors were shut off and the ocean and the mountain chains seemed to rise up to meet the aeroplane, sailing at the speed of the fastest express.  Over the water and down until even Jimmie clutched Ned's arm and gave forth an exclamation of alarm.  Then a turn of a lever sent the Nelson skimming over Calleo and back toward Lima.  Avoiding the vacant space where the Nelson had rested before, Leroy, under Ned's directions, landed on the dry sand some distance away.  \"Of course that other chap will find us when he comes back,\" Ned said, when the boys stood on solid ground again, \"but we'll try to make him think we're hanging around Peru just for the fun of it.\"  \"Perhaps he won't come back,\" suggested Leroy.  \"Then I'll lose my chance of showing him what the Nelson can do.\"  \"I have an idea that he'll be back by morning,\" Ned replied.  In this the boy was right, for the white aeroplane showed in a couple of hours, just about dawn, circled around the city, hovered for a moment over the Nelson, and then went off to the north again.  \"It is a certainty that she is here to butt into our game!\" Jimmie said, as the white planes disappeared.  \"She'll start when we start, an' stop when we stop, an' there won't be any getting away from her. How does she get into the air so quick after we cut loose?  That's what I'd like to know.\"  \"Some system of signals, undoubtedly,\" Ned answered.  \"Now,\" he continued, \"we'll cuddle up in our blankets here and sleep as long as the natives will let us.  Who'll keep awake?\"  Each one wanted to be the one to stand guard, but the point was decided by the appearance of Mike and Pedro, who had watched the maneuvers of the Nelson, had noted her landing place, and hastened forward.  Thus relieved of the care of the machine, the three boys hastened to the hotel and were soon sound asleep.  It was noon when Ned awoke, brought out of a deep slumber by an impatient knocking at his door.  He was out of bed in an instant and, clad only in his pajamas, opened the door and looked out.  Mr. Thomas Q. Collins stood in the corridor with a look of alarm on his face.  \"Thought I'd never get you out,\" he said, stepping, uninvited, into the room and taking a chair.  \"Thought that you ought to know what's been going on.\"  Ned had little confidence in Collins.  The fellow's strange conduct of the night before naturally made the boy suspicious.  After requesting a ride in the Nelson, or, at least, the company of the Boy Scouts to the place where the machine had been left, he had disappeared without a word of explanation.  It seemed to Ned that he had good grounds for the belief that Collins had spied around until he had learned that the aeroplane was going up, and had then communicated the information to the man on the white machine.  At least, the strange aviator had shown in the air directly after the disappearance of Collins.  But it was no part of Ned's purpose to permit Collins to see that he was suspected.  It was rather his idea to keep on good terms with the fellow and watch him for any evidences of treachery.  He therefore greeted him cordially and asked:  \"Something interesting going on in the city?  We did not return until nearly dawn, and I've been asleep ever since.\"  \"You haven't heard about the attack on our aeroplane, then?\" asked Collins, looking Ned over keenly.  The boy tried not to exhibit the least emotion or excitement at the disturbing question.  Leaning back in the chair he had taken, he asked:  \"The curiosity of the people got the better of their courtesy, eh? I have been afraid of that.  Well, I hope the Nelson was not seriously injured.\"  Thomas Q. Collins had the appearance of one who had expected to unwrap a great sensation and had failed.  His face was a study.  \"Well, no,\" he replied.  \"The fact is, when the rush was made the aeroplane shot up into the air.\"  \"Then one of the boys must have been there,\" Ned said, calmly, although his heart was beating like a drum.  \"The little fellow was there, the one you call Jimmie,\" was the reply.  \"And he went into the air alone?\"  \"No; at the last minute a Peruvian Indian who has been hanging about the machine ever since you came here went with him.\"  \"Then there is no danger,\" Ned replied, really feeling relieved at the thought that Jimmie was not alone in the aeroplane.  \"The lad will bring the Nelson back in good time.  Anyway, he is entitled to a little excursion, 'all by his lonely,' as he puts it.\"  \"He can operate the machine?\"  \"Certainly.  He can handle the Nelson easily.\"  Thomas Q. Collins regarded Ned steadily for a moment, his brusque, salesmanship manner all gone, and then asked:  \"'Where are you going from here?\"  The fellow was showing his hand at last!  Or was this just natural curiosity?  At that moment Ned was more interested in discovering something about the attack on the Nelson than in fighting off personal and impertinent questions, so he said:  \"We haven't made up our minds as to our future course.  By the way, what was the cause of the attack on the aeroplane?\"  \"Oh,\" replied Collins, frowning slightly, \"there were a lot of people gathered about the ropes, and one of your guards was a little coarse in protecting your property, and there was a blow struck, then the mob rushed the roped-in enclosure.  I think there was no one seriously injured.\"  \"I wonder if the other aviator is also having trouble with his machine?\" asked Ned, anxious to know what Collins would say about the white aeroplane.  \"I don't know about that,\" Collins replied.  \"In fact, the other fellow went off to the south soon after the departure of the Nelson.\"  \"Chased Jimmie up, eh?\"  \"Well, anxious for a race, it seemed to me.\"  \"Has the Nelson returned?\" asked Ned, then.  Collins shook his head.  \"If you'll excuse me, then,\" Ned said, presently.  \"I'll dress and take breakfast and go down to see what's doing.\"  \"Your breakfast will be luncheon, I guess,\" laughed Collins.  \"I was on my way to the dining room when I thought of you.  If you don't mind I'll wait for you in the lobby.  These natives are not very good table companions.  I'm sick for the sight of my own countrymen, anyway, and I can't tell you how glad I am to see you here.\"  Collins went out and closed the door and Ned set about his toilet. He did not know what to make of the alleged steam pump salesman.  At times he appeared to be perfectly frank and honest, then there would come to his eyes a look of half-concealed cunning and greed which put the boy on his guard.  However, Ned thought, the correct way to fathom the fellow's intentions would be to remain in his company as much as possible. So the boy bathed and dressed and went down to Collins in the lobby with a cheerful face.  During the meal Collins talked incessantly of the country and his prospects in South America.  Ned listened, saying little, even in the short spaces of silence.  He was waiting for the fellow to strike some chord which tuned with his actions of the night before. At last it came.  \"I'm thinking of going over to Asuncion,\" he said, when the meal was nearly over.  \"There are mines over that way, and I may stand a chance of selling a pump.  Rotten luck in Peru, and I can't afford to spend all this expense money and not sell a thing.  I hear that there are a few Americans over in Paraguay,\" he added, tentatively, smiling over at Ned.  \"I know very little about the country,\" Ned said, coolly, fearful that Collins would drop that line of conversation, \"and I never heard that foreigners of any sort were made welcome in Paraguay.  I don't think we'll go out of our way any to visit that hot little republic.\"  Collins looked disappointed.  Ned could see that.  In a moment he tried again to bring the subject out, but Ned seemed entirely indifferent.  When the two left the hotel and walked in the direction of the sand lot where the Nelson had been left, the boy was fully satisfied that Collins was in league with his enemies.  For all he knew, the fellow might be the very man who was trying to get Lyman's concession away from him.  This might be the man who was bribing the crooked military chief to make it impossible for the cattle man to carry out his contract.  \"What time did the Nelson leave?\" Ned asked, as they drew near a little group of natives standing on the sand lot.  \"Not far from nine,\" was the reply.  \"I didn't think Jimmie would be out that early,\" laughed Ned.  \"He is a little sleepy head, ordinarily.\"  Pushing their way into the center of the little crowd, Ned and Collins found Leroy and Mike Dougherty engaged in a heated debate with a police officer who was threatening arrest.  Ned stepped back so as not to attract the attention of the boys, and kept his eyes fixed on Collins.  In a moment he saw that gentleman give an impatient gesture which seemed to urge the officer on.  Ned thought fast for a moment.  He was considering whether or not he had been brought there for the purpose of getting into a row in defense of his chums and being arrested with them.  He was heartily glad that the Nelson was out of the way, although he would have been better pleased had he been safe aboard of her.  \"These Peruvian officers are too fresh!\" Collins said, in a moment. \"What do you mean by molesting these boys?\" he added, in Spanish, turning to the officer.  \"They are charged with assault,\" the latter replied.  \"By whom?\" asked Ned, also speaking in Spanish.  \"They struck half a dozen citizens,\" was the indefinite reply.  \"We must take them to jail.\"  \"I'll give you a bump in the eye if you come near me!\" Leroy put in, as he searched the sky eagerly for some sign of the Nelson.  \"That wouldn't help matters any,\" Ned said, speaking in English. \"Go along with the officer, and I'll pay "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6904"],["title","Boy Scouts in an Airship; Or, The Warning from the Sky (#7)"],["body","fine.\"  Collins looked annoyed at this cautious advice.  He came nearer to Ned and whispered:  \"The courts are slow and uncertain here.  It may be weeks before the boys will be restored to liberty if they are locked up.  If we could get them away into the mountains until the Nelson returns that would end the whole affair.\"  \"And so you want to get me mixed up in it, too!\" thought Ned, as the officer glared at him.  \"You want to get me on a charge of resisting arrest!  When we get out of here, Mr. Thomas Q. Collins, I'll see that you get what's coming to you!\"  If Collins could have known what was passing in Ned's mind, could have understood how suspicious the boy was of him, he would not have urged the lads, in English, to cut and run.  By doing so he merely confirmed Ned's unfavorable opinion of him.  From that moment Ned knew him for what he was, and resolved to get him out of the way in some manner.  Leroy and Mike paid little attention to what Collins said, as a shake of the head from Ned gave them to understand what was passing in his mind.  In a moment Ned stepped to the side of the policeman.  \"You are all right, officer,\" he said.  \"You are only doing your duty.  The boys will go with you, and I'll pay their fines.\"  But, as Ned discovered, it is easier to get into jail in Peru than it is to get out.     CHAPTER VI  NED IS GUILTY OF LARCENY   Night came on and no Nelson showed in the sky.  Ned wandered restlessly about the rather handsome city, anxious for the aeroplane as well as for the boys who were in the city prison.  Collins was always with him, at first, expressing sympathy and suggesting plans for getting the prisoners out on bail.  The complainant in the case, it was claimed by the officers, was too badly injured to appear in court.  Ned grew sick of the constant talking of the fellow at last, and went to his room, saying that he was due for a little sleep.  But the boy, as may well be imagined, did not sleep.  Instead, he sat by his window watching the sky.  Where had Jimmie gone with the machine?  This question was always in his mind.  Had he met with an accident and was he lying, crushed from a long fall, in some mountain canyon?  Had the pursuing aeroplane overtaken him and destroyed or captured the Nelson?  It was not like the little fellow to disappear so utterly.  Even supposing he was afraid to return to Lima, he ought to understand how anxious his friends would be and signal them from the upper air. Surely, Ned reasoned, this would be safe, for the hostile machine could not approach the Nelson in speed, and, after giving a reassuring signal, the boy could disappear in the mountains again.  It was dark now in the room where Ned was, and he sat looking out at the sky in the hope of seeing the welcome lights of the aeroplane. Presently, he saw a flicker of light off to the east.  It increased in size rapidly, and Ned knew that it was an airship he saw approaching at wonderful speed, but he had no means of knowing whether it was Jimmie on the Nelson or the hostile aviator.  If it was Jimmie, he thought, there would be a signal directly.  He waited eagerly, but no signal showed.  Presently the airship drifted off to the north, and Ned saw the glint of moonlight on white planes.  It was the hostile ship, sure enough, but why had she abandoned pursuit of the Nelson?  Ned resolved to secure a closer view of the airship, but the next question was how to avoid Collins, who was at that moment pacing to and fro in front of the hotel.  The alleged salesman would be apt to accost him as soon as he appeared and insist on going with him.  He had had enough of Collins.  He had no doubt that the fellow was in the conspiracy against him.  It seemed reasonable that he had been warned by wire of the approach of the Boy Scouts, and had hastened to Lima to intercept them.  Ned thought over the situation deliberately, and then a daring smile came to his face.  \"I wonder if I can?\"  He chuckled as he asked himself the question.  \"I wonder if I can?\"  He paced his room for a moment, and then continued.  \"If he goes with me, there will be less suspicion, provided I am right in my estimate of the fellow.  We may be even left alone with the aeroplane!  Ah, that would be too good to come true!\"  The boy watched the sky to the east from the roof as well as from his window, but there were no signs of the aeroplane which Jimmie had taken away.  \"The little rascal knows what he is doing!\" Ned told himself, \"but I wish he would let me know, too!  I reckon I'll take a chance on the plan.  I'll try anything once, as the Bowery boys say.\"  Having settled the vexed question in his own mind, Ned went whistling down the broad stairway and came out in the lobby.  Just as he had figured, Collins sat where he could keep an eye on the front entrance.  When Ned appeared the fellow arose and stepped over to him.  \"There is nothing new, I'm afraid,\" Collins said.  \"I've just been over to the police station, and nothing can be done tonight.\"  Ned thought that Collins must have made pretty good time to get over to the police station and back during the short space of time he had been out of sight, but he did not say so.  \"Anything new about the aeroplane?\" asked Ned.  \"I saw the white one come back.\"  \"Perhaps she can give us the information we want about your ship, or, perhaps the aviator can,\" he added with a laugh.  \"Why not go and see?\" asked Ned, his heart bounding with hope and excitement as he noted how eagerly Collins took the bait.  \"Can we get a motor-car here?  The machine must be quite a distance away.\"  \"It does look that way,\" Collins replied, with a yawn, \"and we may as well take a car, if we can find one.  I hope you don't mind my going with you.\"  \"Why, I wouldn't go alone!\" Ned replied, speaking with perfect truth, as Collins discovered later on.  \"You don't know how glad I am to find you up and ready for a little adventure!\"  Collins, in turn, told how pleased he was to be of service, and the two found a motor-car and started off, taking a road which ran along a level strip of land which lay between the sand and the mountains. They had proceeded a couple of miles when a motor-car appeared in sight just ahead of them, traveling toward the city.  Collins arose in his seat and waved his hand frantically.  \"I believe that's Sherman!\" he cried.  \"Sherman's here for a rival steam pump firm, but I'll be good to him, especially as there is nothing doing in the way of trade.  Hey, there, Sherm!\" he shouted as the two cars drew nearer.  \"Pull up and give an account of yourself!\"  Sherman was a dark-faced, black-haired, bewhiskered fellow of perhaps forty.  He was dressed in a dark business suit and wore glasses.  The two men talked shop for a moment, and then Collins asked:  \"Where have you been?\"  \"Just out for a ride,\" was the reply.  \"You saw the airship come down?\"  \"Of come, but I'm not interested in airships.\"  \"Then you haven't been out there?\"  \"Hardly.  It doesn't interest me--this aviation craze.\"  \"Then you don't know whether the aviator is out there or not?\" continued Collins.  \"Why, yes, I do know about that,\" Sherman replied.  \"I heard this driver of mine talking Spanish with a shoofer we met, and learned from the mix-up in tongues that the aviator has gone to the city, leaving a couple of natives in charge of the machine.\"  Ned's heart bounded so fiercely that he feared that Collins would hear its quick beats!  The aviator was not there.  Only two Peruvians, timid chaps at best!  Mr. Thomas Q. Collins might receive his reward for his treachery sooner than he imagined, the boy thought!  \"Well, so long!\" Collins cried.  \"We'll see you in the city tonight.\"  The cars parted, each going its separate way, and Ned and Collins were soon within sight of the white aeroplane, which lay in a valley a short distance from the road.  The spot where it lay was well irrigated, and fruits and vegetables were growing all around the rope which had been strung about the machine.  The aviator had evidently paid a good price for the privilege of landing there.  A short distance away from the site of the machine was a small house, a tiny affair, with plenty of porches and a flat roof.  As the two men left the car and advanced toward the machine a man left the porch and walked in their direction.  \"Probably the farmer,\" Collins said.  \"We may have to pay for the privilege of looking over the machine.\"  Much to the amazement of the boy, the man who approached from the porch spoke to the two in English.  \"What do you want?\" he asked.  Ned waited for Collins to make a reply.  If Collins really was in the conspiracy against Lyman, he would probably show his hand within the next few minutes.  Just as Ned anticipated Collins gave the other a sly signal before he opened his mouth.  Ned was not supposed to see this evidence of a common understanding, but his watchful eyes caught not only that but the answering sign of the other.  \"We came up to look over the machine,\" Collins said.  \"Well, you keep away from it,\" the other replied, fixing his eyes keenly on the face of the boy.  \"This lad,\" Collins said, then, motioning toward Ned, \"knows something about an aeroplane, and wants to inspect this one.\"  A sly wink followed the remark.  It was getting rather cheap to Ned. The collusion between the two was so evident that their attempts to conceal it appeared very slazy.  \"Yes,\" Ned put in, \"I'd like to look the machine over.\"  \"You came in that other aeroplane?\" was asked.  Ned nodded, and Collins broke in:  \"He's an expert, but he has no machine just at present.  A member of his party took his machine away this morning,\" he added, with a chuckle.  \"So Rowan said,\" the alleged farmer replied.  \"Rowan?\" repeated Ned.  \"Is that the name of the aviator who runs this machine?\"  \"Yes; he is a New York man.  Do you know him?\"  Ned replied that he had heard of him, knew him to be a splendid operator, but had never met him.  After some further"]]]
