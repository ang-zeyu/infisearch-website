The country, whenever there was controversy, was agitated to its deepest foundations.  That is known, perhaps, not to gentlemen who live up in Maine or Massachusetts, or where you are foreign to all this agitation; but known to all people where disturbance might have been effective in consequences.  I felt it, and had to carry my life in my hand by the month, as did my friends surrounding me.  \"I say that all through last winter (that of 1860-61) War had been inaugurated in all those parts of the Country where disturbed elements could have efficient result.  In January (1861), a year ago, I stood in the hall of the House of Representatives of my State, and there was War then, and angry faces and hostile men were gathered; and we knew then well that the Southern States had determined to withdraw themselves from the Federal Union.  \"I happened to be one of those men who said, 'they shall not do it;' and it appears to me that the whole argument is between that class of men and the class of men who said they would let them do it.  * * *  When this doctrine was started here of disintegrating the Cotton States from the rest of the Confederacy, I opposed it at once.  I saw immediately that War was to be invoked.  * * *  \"I will not say these things were understood by gentlemen of the Republican Party * * * but I, having been accepted and received as a Democrat of the old school from the olden time, and HAVING FAST SOUTHERN SYMPATHIES, I DID KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM. * * * I KNOW THAT SECESSION WAS A THING DETERMINED UPON.  * * * I was advised of and understood the whole programme, KNEW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE IN ITS DETAILS; and I being advised, made war against it.  * * *  \"War had been, in fact, inaugurated.  What is War?  Was it the firing on our flag at Sumter?  Was that the first adversary passage?  To say so, is trifling with men's judgments and information.  No, sir; when they organized a Government, and set us at defiance, they commenced War; and the various steps they took afterwards, by organizing their troops, and forming their armies, and advancing upon Sumter; all these were merely acts of War; but War was inaugurated whenever they undertook to say they would maintain themselves as a separate and independent government; and, after that time, every man who gave his assistance to them was a Traitor, according to the highest Law.\"  The following letter, written by one of the most active of the Southern conspirators in 1858, during the great Douglas and Lincoln Debate of that year, to which extended reference has already been made, is of interest in this connection, not only as corroborative evidence of the fact that the Rebellion of the Cotton States had been determined on long before Mr. Lincoln was elected President, but as showing also that the machinery for \"firing the Southern heart\" and for making a \"solid South\" was being perfected even then.  The subsequent split in the Democratic Party, and nomination of Breckinridge by the Southern wing of it, was managed by this same Yancey, simply as parts of the deliberate programme of Secession and Rebellion long before determined on by the Cotton Lords of the Cotton States.                            \"MONTGOMERY, June 15, 1858.  \"DEAR SIR:--Your kind favor of the 13th is received.  \"I hardly agree with you that a general movement can be made that will clean out the Augean Stable.  If the Democracy were overthrown it would result in giving place to a greedier and hungrier swarm of flies.  \"The remedy of the South is not in such a process.  It is in a diligent organization of her true men for prompt resistance to the next aggression.  It must come in the nature of things.  No National Party can save us.  No Sectional Party can ever do it.  But if we could do as our fathers did--organize 'Committees of Safety' all over the Cotton States (and it is only in them that we can hope for any effective movement), we shall fire the Southern heart, instruct the Southern mind, give courage to each other, and at the proper moment, by one organized, concerted action, we can precipitate the Cotton States into a revolution.  \"The idea has been shadowed forth in the South by Mr. Ruffin; has been taken up and recommended in the Advertiser under the name of 'League of United Southerners,' who, keeping up their old relations on all other questions, will hold the Southern issues paramount, and influence parties, legislatures and statesmen.  I have no time to enlarge, but to suggest merely.  \"In haste, yours, etc.                          \"W. L. YANCEY.  \"To JAMES S. SLAUGHTER.\"   At Jackson, Mississippi, in the fall of the same year (1858) just after the great Debate between Douglas and Lincoln had closed, Jefferson Davis had already raised the standard of Revolution, Secession and Disunion, during the course of a speech, in which he said: \"If an Abolitionist be chosen President of the United States, you will have presented to you the question of whether you will permit the Government to pass into the hands of your avowed and implacable enemies?  Without pausing for an answer, I will state my own position to be, that such a result would be a species of revolution by which the purposes of the Government would be destroyed, and the observance of its mere forms entitled to no respect. In that event, in such a manner as should be most expedient, I should deem it your duty to provide for your safety, outside of the Union with those who have already shown the will, and would have acquired the power to deprive you of your birthright, and to reduce you to worse than the Colonial dependence of your fathers.\"  The \"birthright\" thus referred to was of course, the alleged right to have Slaves; but what was this \"worse than Colonial dependence\" to which, in addition to the peril supposed to threaten the Southern \"birthright,\" the Cotton States of Mississippi were reduced? \"Dependence\" upon whom, and with regard to what?  Plainly upon the North; and with regard, not to Slavery alone--for Jefferson Davis held, down to the very close of the War, that the South fought \"not for Slavery\"--but as to Tariff Legislation also.  There was the rub! These Cotton Lords believed, or pretended to believe, that the High Tariff Legislation, advocated and insisted upon both by the Whigs and Republicans for the Protection of the American Manufacturer and working man, built up and made prosperous the North, and elevated Northern laborers; at the expense of the South, and especially themselves, the Cotton Lords aforesaid.  We have already seen from the utterances of leading men in the South Carolina, Secession Convention, \"that\"--as Governor Hicks, himself a Southern man, said in his address to the people of Maryland, after the War broke out \"neither the election of Mr. Lincoln, nor the non-execution of the Fugitive Slave Law, nor both combined, constitute their grievances.  They declare that THE REAL CAUSE of their discontent DATES AS FAR BACK AS 1833.\"  And what was the chief cause or pretext for discontent at that time? Nothing less than the Tariff.  They wanted Free Trade, as well as Slavery.  The balance of the Union wanted Protection, as well as Freedom.  The subsequent War, then, was not a War waged for Slavery alone, but for Independence with a view to Free Trade, as set forth in the \"Confederate Constitution,\" as soon as that Independence could be achieved.  And the War on our part, while for the integrity of the Union in all its parts --for the life of the Nation itself, and for the freedom of man, should also have brought the triumph of the American idea of a Protective Tariff, whose chief object is the building up of American manufactures and the Protection of the Free working-man, in the essential matters of education, food, clothing, rents, wages, and work.  It is mentioned in McPherson's History of the Rebellion, p. 392, that in a letter making public his reasons for going to Washington and taking his seat in Congress, Mr. James L. Pugh, a Representative from Alabama, November 24, 1860, said: \"The sole object of my visit is to promote the cause of Secession.\"  From the manner in which they acted after reaching Washington, it is not unreasonable to suppose that most of those persons representing, in both branches of Congress, the Southern States which afterwards seceded, came to the National Capital with a similar object in view--taking their salaries and mileages for services supposed to be performed for the benefit of the very Government they were conspiring to injure, and swearing anew the sacred oath to support and defend the very Constitution which they were moving heaven and earth to undermine and destroy!       [As a part of the history of those times, the following letter is      not without interest:       \"OXFORD, December 24, 1860.       \"MY DEAR SIR:--I regretted having to leave Washington without      having with you a full conference as to the great events whose      shadows are upon us.  The result of the election here is what the      most sanguine among us expected; that is, its general result is so.      It is as yet somewhat difficult to determine the distinctive      complexion of the convention to meet on the 7th of January.  The      friends of Southern Independence, of firm and bona fide resistance,      won an overwhelming victory; but I doubt whether there is any      precise plan.       \"No doubt a large majority of the Convention will be for separate      Secession.  But unless intervening events work important changes of      sentiment, not all of those elected as resistance men will be for      immediate and separate Secession.  Our friends in Pontotoc, Tippah,      De Soto and Pauola took grounds which fell far short of that idea,      though their resolutions were very firm in regard to Disunion and      an ultimate result.       \"In the meantime the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7135"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 3 (#7)"],["body","sentiment among the people is growing      every day more intense.       \"Upon the whole, you have great cause for gratification in the      action of your State.       \"The submissionists are routed, horse, foot, and dragoons, and any      concession by the North will fail to restore that sacred attachment      to the Union which was once so deeply radicated in the hearts of      our people.  What they want now, is wise and sober leading.  I      think that there might be more of dignity and prudent foresight in      the action of our State than have marked the proceedings of South      Carolina.  I have often rejoiced that we have you to rest upon and      confide in.  I do not know what we could do without you.  That God      may preserve you to us, and that your mind may retain all its vigor      to carry us through these perilous times, is my most fervent      aspiration.       \"I am as ever, and forever, your supporter, ally and friend.                                \"L. Q. C. LAMAR.       \"COL. JEFF.  DAVIS, Washington, D. C.\"]   This was but a part of the deliberate, cold-blooded plan mapped out in detail, early in the session succeeding the election of Mr. Lincoln, in a secret Caucus of the Chief Plotters of the Treason.  It was a secret conference, but the programme resolved on, soon leaked out.  The following, which appeared in the Washington National Intelligencer on Friday, January 11, 1861, tells the story of this stage of the Great Conspiracy pretty clearly:  \"The subjoined communication, disclosing the designs of those who have undertaken to lead the movement now threatening a permanent dissolution of the Union, comes to us from a distinguished citizen of the South [understood to be Honorable Lemuel D. Evans, Representative from Texas in the 34th Congress, from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1857] who formerly represented his State with great distinction in the popular branch of Congress.  \"Temporarily sojourning in this city he has become authentically informed of the facts recited in the subjoined letter, which he communicates to us under a sense of duty, and for the accuracy of which he makes himself responsible.  \"Nothing but assurances coming from such an intelligent, reliable source could induce us to accept the authenticity of these startling statements, which so deeply concern not only the welfare but the honor of the Southern people.  \"To them we submit, without present comment, the programme to which they are expected to yield their implicit adhesion, without any scruples of conscience as without any regard for their own safety.                      \"'WASHINGTON, January 9, 1861.  \"'I charge that on last Saturday night (January 5th), a Caucus was held in this city by the Southern Secession Senators from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.  It was then and there resolved in effect to assume to themselves the political power of the South, and, to control all political and military operations for the present, they telegraphed to complete the plan of seizing forts, arsenals, and custom-houses, and advised the Conventions now in session, and soon to assemble, to pass Ordinances for immediate Secession; but, in order to thwart any operations of the Government here, the Conventions of the Seceding States are to retain their representations in the Senate and the House.  \"'They also advised, ordered, or directed the assembling of a Convention of delegates from the Seceding States at Montgomery on the 13th of February.  This can of course only be done by the revolutionary Conventions usurping the powers of the people, and sending delegates over whom they will lose all control in the establishment of a Provisional Government, which is the plan of the dictators.  \"'This Caucus also resolved to take the most effectual means to dragoon the Legislatures of Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas, and Virginia into following the Seceding States.  Maryland is also to be influenced by such appeals to popular passion as have led to the revolutionary steps which promise a conflict with the State and Federal Governments in Texas.  \"'They have possessed themselves of all the avenues of information in the South--the telegraph, the press, and the general control of the postmasters.  They also confidently rely upon defections in the army and navy.  \"'The spectacle here presented is startling to contemplate.  Senators entrusted with the representative sovereignty of the States, and sworn to support the Constitution of the United States, while yet acting as the privy councillors of the President, and anxiously looked to by their constituents to effect some practical plan of adjustment, deliberately conceive a Conspiracy for the overthrow of the Government through the military organizations, the dangerous secret order, the 'Knights of the Golden Circle,' 'Committees of Safety,' Southern leagues, and other agencies at their command; they have instituted as thorough a military and civil despotism as ever cursed a maddened Country.  \"'It is not difficult to foresee the form of government which a Convention thus hurriedly thrown together at Montgomery will irrevocably fasten upon a deluded and unsuspecting people.  It must essentially be 'a Monarchy founded upon military principles,' or it cannot endure. Those who usurp power never fail to forge strong chains.  \"'It may be too late to sound the alarm.  Nothing may be able to arrest the action of revolutionary tribunals whose decrees are principally in 'secret sessions.'  But I call upon the people to pause and reflect before they are forced to surrender every principle of liberty, or to fight those who are becoming their masters rather than their servants.                                    \"' EATON\"  \"As confirming the intelligence furnished by our informant we may cite the following extract from the Washington correspondence of yesterday's Baltimore Sun:  \"'The leaders of the Southern movement are consulting as to the best mode of consolidating their interests into a Confederacy under a Provisional Government.  The plan is to make Senator Hunter, of Virginia, Provisional President, and Jefferson Davis Commander-in-Chief of the army of defense.  Mr. Hunter possesses in a more eminent degree the philosophical characteristics of Jefferson than any other statesman now living.  Colonel Davis is a graduate of West Point, was distinguished for gallantry at Buena Vista, and served as Secretary of War under President Pierce, and is not second to General Scott in military science or courage.'  \"As further confirmatory of the above, the following telegraphic dispatch in the Charleston Mercury of January 7, 1861, is given:  \"'[From our Own Correspondent.]  \"'WASHINGTON, January 6.--The Senators from those of the Southern States which have called Conventions of their people, met in caucus last night, and adopted the following resolutions:  \"'Resolved, That we recommend to our respective States immediate Secession.  \"'Resolved, That we recommend the holding of a General Convention of the said States, to be holden in the city of Montgomery, Alabama, at some period not later than the 15th day of February, 1861.'  \"These resolutions were telegraphed this evening to the Conventions of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.  A third resolution is also known to have been adopted, but it is of a confidential character, not to be divulged at present.  There was a good deal of discussion in the caucus on the question of whether the Seceding States ought to continue their delegations in Congress till the 4th of March, to prevent unfriendly legislation, or whether the Representatives of the Seceding States should all resign together, and leave a clear field for the opposition to pass such bills, looking to Coercion, as they may see fit.  It is believed that the opinion that they should remain prevailed.\"  Furthermore, upon the capture of Fernandina, Florida, in 1862, the following letter was found and published.  Senator Yulee, the writer, was present and participated as one of the Florida Senators, in the traitorous \"Consultation\" therein referred to--and hence its especial value:   \"WASHINGTON, January 7, 1861.  \"My DEAR SIR:--On the other side is a copy of resolutions adopted at a consultation of the Senators from the Seceding States--in which Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, and Florida were present.  \"The idea of the meeting was that the States should go out at once, and provide for the early organization of a Confederate Government, not later than 15th February.  This time is allowed to enable Louisiana and Texas to participate.  It seemed to be the opinion that if we left here, force, loan, and volunteer Bills might be passed, which would put Mr. Lincoln in immediate condition for hostilities; whereas, by remaining in our places until the 4th of March, it is thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied, and disable the Republicans from effecting any legislation which will strengthen the hands of the incoming Administration.  \"The resolutions will be sent by the delegation to the President of the Convention.  I have not been able to find Mr. Mallory (his Senatorial colleague) this morning.  Hawkins (Representative from Florida) is in Connecticut.  I have therefore thought it best to send you this copy of the resolutions.                 \"In haste, yours truly                                    \"D. L.
