Who will give warrant that I shall not abuse your insane desire?”  “Your own nobility of character.”  “Power makes people over-bearing.”  “Be it,” I cried, “tread me underfoot.”  Wanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook her head.  “I am afraid I can’t, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you Severin, as I have loved no other man.”  *       *       *       *       *  To-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping with her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the kind that are used on dogs.  “Are these satisfactory?” said the shopkeeper.  “No, they are much too small,” replied Wanda, with a side-glance at me. “I need a large—”  “For a bull-dog, I suppose?” opined the merchant.  “Yes,” she exclaimed, “of the kind that are used in Russia for intractable slaves.”  She looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I felt a strange creeping sensation.  “Now good-by, Severin,” she said. “I have some other purchases to make, but you can’t go along.”  I left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out at a furrier’s. She beckoned me.  “Consider it well,” she began in good spirits, “I have never made a secret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated me. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually lying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me—but will this attraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends by kicking him aside.”  “Very well then, kick me aside,” I replied, “when you are tired of me. I want to be your slave.”  “Dangerous forces lie within me,” said Wanda, after we had gone a few steps further. “You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You know how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors. What would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the first object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the inventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his wails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.  “Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?”  “Be it,” I exclaimed, “and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours for good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my breast drives me on—demoniacally—relentlessly.”  “My Beloved,  I do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening the day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.  Your mistress  Wanda.”  “As my slave” was underlined. I read the note which I received early in the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal symbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted to numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the Carpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than ever. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at her door.  “Come in!”  I enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown of white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she wears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her powdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with her arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.  “Wanda!” I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to kiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.  “Slave!”  “Mistress!” I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.  “That is as it should be.”  “Oh, how beautiful you are.”  “Do I please you?” She stepped before the mirror, and looked at herself with proud satisfaction.  “I shall become mad!”  Her lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly from behind half-closed lids.  “Give me the whip.”  I looked about the room.  “No,” she exclaimed, “stay as you are, kneeling.” She went over to the fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching me with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled up the sleeve of her fur-jacket.  “Marvellous woman!” I exclaimed.  “Silence, slave!” She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me with the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and pityingly bent down to me. “Did I hurt you?” she asked, half-shyly, half-timidly.  “No,” I replied, “and even if you had, pains that come through you are a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.”  “But it doesn’t give me pleasure.”  Again I was seized with that strange intoxication.  “Whip me,” I begged, “whip me without mercy.”  Wanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. “Are you satisfied now?”  “No.”  “Seriously, no?”  “Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.”  “Yes, because you know very well that it isn’t serious,” she replied, “because I haven’t the heart to hurt you. This brutal game goes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves you would be horrified.”  “No, Wanda,” I replied, “I love you more than myself; I am devoted to you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me whatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.”  “Severin!”  “Tread me underfoot!” I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the floor before her.  “I hate all this play-acting,” said Wanda impatiently.  “Well, then maltreat me seriously.”  An uncanny pause.  “Severin, I warn you for the last time,” began Wanda.  “If you love me, be cruel towards me,” I pleaded with upraised eyes.  “If I love you,” repeated Wanda. “Very well!” She stepped back and looked at me with a sombre smile. _“Be then my slave, and know what it means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.”_ And at the same moment she gave me a kick.  “How do you like that, slave?”  Then she flourished the whip.  “Get up!”  I was about to rise.  “Not that way,” she commanded, “on your knees.”  I obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.  The blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one cut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They came from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to lay down my life.  She stopped. “I am beginning to enjoy it,” she said, “but enough for to-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far your strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and writhe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want to go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you lose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being. But now get up.”  I seized her hand to press it to my lips.  “What impudence.”  She shoved me away with her foot.  “Out of my sight, slave!”  *       *       *       *       *  After having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I awoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.  How much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I actually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped was certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red stripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.  My dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I disappointed in the realization of my dream?  No, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me. Oh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the remotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What happiness to be her slave!  *       *       *       *       *  She calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing on the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. “I am ashamed of myself,” she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her head against my breast.  “Why?”  “Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,” she said with quivering voice, “I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be reasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be your wife.”  “My mistress,” I exclaimed, “and I your slave!”  “Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,” interrupted Wanda. “I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except wearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.”  *       *       *       *       *  The little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his bolt struck midnight.  I rose, and wanted to leave.  Wanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman. She began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so comprehensible, so convincing—  And it told me more than I dared to understand.  A languid abandonment pervaded Wanda’s entire being. What a voluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed eyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the white powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her with every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_ in which she carelessly nestled.  “Please,” I stammered, “but you will be angry with me.”  “Do with me what you will,” she whispered.  “Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.”  “Haven’t I forbidden you,” said Wanda sternly, “but you are incorrigible.”  “Oh, I am so terribly in love.” I had sunken on my knees, and was burying my glowing face in her lap.  “I really believe,” said Wanda thoughtfully, “that your madness is nothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way of life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you would be completely sane.”  “Well then, make me sane,” I murmured. My hands were running through her hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose and fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all my senses into confusion.  And I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she wanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had long since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought to free myself.  “What is the matter?” asked Wanda.  “I am suffering agonies.”  “You are suffering—” she broke out into a loud amused laughter.  “You laugh!” I moaned, “have you no idea—”  She was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands, and with a violent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6870"],["title","Why We Are at War : Messages to the Congress January to April 1917 (#0)"],["body","WE ARE AT WAR  Messages to the Congress January to April, 1917 by Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, with the President's proclamation of war April 6, 1917 and his message to the American people April 15, 1917.

PUBLISHERS' NOTE    This book presents in convenient form the memorable messages to the Congress read by President Wilson in January, February, and April, 1917.  They should be read together, for only in this way is it possible to appreciate both the forbearance and the logic of events reflected in these consecutive chapters of history.  While the great war message of April 2d is obviously the most momentous, its full significance is not made clear unless it is read as the climax of the preceding messages and also in connection with the President's proclamation of a state of war on April 6th and his message to the American people of April 15th.  While the approval of President Wilson was very naturally requested and obtained for the publication of these messages in collected form, the Publishers are responsible for the title and for captions.  They have felt that they are rendering a service of permanent value by collecting and presenting these historic documents in the same form in which they have published President Wilson's When a Man Comes to Himself, On Being Human, and The President of the United States.     I  A WORLD LEAGUE FOR PEACE  Message to the Senate January 22, 1917    Gentlemen of the Senate:  On the 18th of December last I addressed an identic note to the Governments of the nations now at war, requesting them to state, more definitely than they had yet been stated by either group of belligerents, the terms upon which they would deem it possible to make peace.  I spoke on behalf of humanity and of the rights of all neutral nations like our own, many of whose most vital interests the war puts in constant jeopardy.  The Central Powers united in a reply which stated merely that they were ready to meet their antagonists in conference to discuss terms of peace.   ENTENTE REPLY WAS MORE DEFINITE  The Entente Powers have replied much more definitely and have stated, in general terms, indeed, but with sufficient definiteness to imply details, the arrangements, guarantees, and acts of reparation which they deem to be the indispensable conditions of a satisfactory settlement.  We are that much nearer a definite discussion of the peace which shall end the present war.  We are that much nearer the discussion of the international concert which must thereafter hold the world at peace.  In every discussion of the peace that must end this war it is taken for granted that that peace must be followed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtually impossible that any such catastrophe should ever overwhelm us again.  Every lover of mankind, every sane and thoughtful man, must take that for granted.  I have sought this opportunity to address you because I thought that I owed it to you, as the council associated with me in the final determination of our international obligations, to disclose to you, without reserve, the thought and purpose that have been taking form in my mind in regard to the duty of our Government in these days to come when it will be necessary to lay afresh and upon a new plan the foundations of peace among the nations.   DECLARES PEACE IS NOT FAR OFF  It is inconceivable that the people of the United States should play no part in that great enterprise.  To take part in such a service will be the opportunity for which they have sought to prepare themselves by the very principles and purposes of their polity and the approved practices of their Government, ever since the days when they set up a new nation in the high and honorable hope that it might in all that it was and did show mankind the way to liberty.  They cannot, in honor, withhold the service to which they are now about to be challenged.  They do not wish to withhold it.  But they owe it to themselves and to the other nations of the world to state the conditions under which they will feel free to render it.  That service is nothing less than this--to add their authority and their power to the authority and force of other nations to guarantee peace and justice throughout the world.  Such a settlement cannot now be long postponed.  It is right that before it comes this Government should frankly formulate the conditions upon which it would feel justified in asking our people to approve its formal and solemn adherence to a league for peace.  I am here to attempt to state those conditions.   MUST NOT SERVE SELFISH AIMS  The present war must first be ended; but we owe it to candor and to a just regard for the opinion of mankind to say that so far as our participation in guarantees of future peace is concerned it makes a great deal of difference in what way and upon what terms it is ended. The treaties and agreements which bring it to an end must embody terms which will create a peace that is worth guaranteeing and preserving, a peace that will win the approval of mankind; not merely a peace that will serve the several interests and immediate aims of the nations engaged.  We shall have no voice in determining what those terms shall be, but we shall, I feel sure, have a voice in determining whether they shall be made lasting or not by the guarantees of a universal covenant, and our judgment upon what is fundamental and essential as a condition precedent to permanency should be spoken now, not afterward, when it may be too late.  No covenant of co-operative peace that does not include the peoples of the New World can suffice to keep the future safe against war, and yet there is only one sort of peace that the peoples of America could join in guaranteeing.  The elements of that peace must be elements that engage the confidence and satisfy the principles of the American Governments, elements consistent with their political faith and the practical convictions which the peoples of America have once for all embraced and undertaken to defend.   WORLD ALLIANCE IS NECESSARY  I do not mean to say that any American Government would throw any obstacle in the way of any terms of peace the Governments now at war might agree upon, or seek to upset them when made, whatever they might be.  I only take it for granted that mere terms of peace between the belligerents will not satisfy even the belligerents themselves.  Mere agreements may not make peace secure.  It will be absolutely necessary that a force be created as a guarantor of the permanency of the settlement so much greater than the force of any nation now engaged in any alliance hitherto formed or projected that no nation, no probable combination of nations, could face or withstand it.  If the peace presently to be made is to endure it must be a peace made secure by the organized major force of mankind.  The terms of the immediate peace agreed upon will determine whether it is a peace for which such a guarantee can be secured.  The question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this:  Is the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace or only for a new balance of power?  If it be only a struggle for a new balance of power, who will guarantee, who can guarantee, the stable equilibrium of the new arrangement?   NO VICTORY FOR EITHER SIDE  Only a tranquil Europe can be a stable Europe.  There must be not only a balance of power, but a community of power; not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace.  Fortunately, we have received very explicit assurances on this point. The statesmen of both of the groups of nations now arrayed against one another have said, in terms that could not be misinterpreted, that it was no part of the purpose they had in mind to crush their antagonists.  But the implications of these assurances may not be equally clear to all--may not be the same on both sides of the water. I think it will be serviceable if I attempt to set forth what we understand them to be.  They imply, first of all, that it must be a peace without victory. It is not pleasant to say this.  I beg that I may be permitted to put my own interpretation upon it and that it may be understood that no other interpretation was in my thought.  I am seeking only to face realities and to face them without soft concealments.  Victory would mean peace forced upon the loser, a victor's terms imposed upon the vanquished.  It would be accepted in humiliation, under duress, at an intolerable sacrifice, and would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory, upon which terms of peace would rest, not permanently, but only as upon quicksand.  Only a peace between equals can last; only a peace the very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit. The right state of mind, the right feeling between nations, is as necessary for a lasting peace as is the just settlement of questions of territory or of racial and national allegiance.   MUST EQUALIZE RIGHTS OF NATIONS  The equality of nations upon which peace must be founded, if it is to last, must be an equality of rights; the guarantees exchanged must neither recognize nor imply a difference between big nations and small, between those that are powerful and those that are weak.  Right must be based upon the common strength, not upon the individual strength, of the"]]]
