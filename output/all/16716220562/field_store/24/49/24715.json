Sae he wad have said naething till Lord Evandale wakened the next morning; only he tauld me about it,\" (here Jenny looked a little down,) \"just to vex me about Cuddie.\"  \"Poh, you silly girl,\" said Edith, assuming some courage, \"it is all a trick of that fellow to teaze you.\"  \"Na, madam, it canna be that, for John Gudyill took the other dragoon (he's an auld hard-favoured man, I wotna his name) into the cellar, and gae him a tass o' brandy to get the news out o' him, and he said just the same as Tam Halliday, word for word; and Mr Gudyill was in sic a rage, that he tauld it a' ower again to us, and says the haill rebellion is owing to the nonsense o' my Leddy and the Major, and Lord Evandale, that begged off young Milnwood and Cuddie yesterday morning, for that, if they had suffered, the country wad hae been quiet--and troth I am muckle o' that opinion mysell.\"  This last commentary Jenny added to her tale, in resentment of her mistress's extreme and obstinate incredulity. She was instantly alarmed, however, by the effect which her news produced upon her young lady, an effect rendered doubly violent by the High-church principles and prejudices in which Miss Bellenden had been educated. Her complexion became as pale as a corpse, her respiration so difficult that it was on the point of altogether failing her, and her limbs so incapable of supporting her, that she sunk, rather than sat, down upon one of the seats in the hall, and seemed on the eve of fainting. Jenny tried cold water, burnt feathers, cutting of laces, and all other remedies usual in hysterical cases, but without any immediate effect.  \"God forgie me! what hae I done?\" said the repentant fille-de-chambre. \"I wish my tongue had been cuttit out!--Wha wad hae thought o' her taking on that way, and a' for a young lad?--O, Miss Edith--dear Miss Edith, haud your heart up about it, it's maybe no true for a' that I hae said--O, I wish my mouth had been blistered! A' body tells me my tongue will do me a mischief some day. What if my Leddy comes? or the Major?--and she's sitting in the throne, too, that naebody has sate in since that weary morning the King was here!--O, what will I do! O, what will become o' us!\"  While Jenny Dennison thus lamented herself and her mistress, Edith slowly returned from the paroxysm into which she had been thrown by this unexpected intelligence.  \"If he had been unfortunate,\" she said, \"I never would have deserted him. I never did so, even when there was danger and disgrace in pleading his cause. If he had died, I would have mourned him--if he had been unfaithful, I would have forgiven him; but a rebel to his King,--a traitor to his country,--the associate and colleague of cut-throats and common stabbers,--the persecutor of all that is noble,--the professed and blasphemous enemy of all that is sacred,--I will tear him from my heart, if my life-blood should ebb in the effort!\"  She wiped her eyes, and rose hastily from the great chair, (or throne, as Lady Margaret used to call it,) while the terrified damsel hastened to shake up the cushion, and efface the appearance of any one having occupied that sacred seat; although King Charles himself, considering the youth and beauty as well as the affliction of the momentary usurper of his hallowed chair, would probably have thought very little of the profanation. She then hastened officiously to press her support on Edith, as she paced the hall apparently in deep meditation.  \"Tak my arm, madam; better just tak my arm; sorrow maun hae its vent, and doubtless\"--  \"No, Jenny,\" said Edith, with firmness; \"you have seen my weakness, and you shall see my strength.\"  \"But ye leaned on me the other morning. Miss Edith, when ye were sae sair grieved.\"  \"Misplaced and erring affection may require support, Jenny--duty can support itself; yet I will do nothing rashly. I will be aware of the reasons of his conduct--and then--cast him off for ever,\" was the firm and determined answer of her young lady.  Overawed by a manner of which she could neither conceive the motive, nor estimate the merit, Jenny muttered between her teeth, \"Odd, when the first flight's ower, Miss Edith taks it as easy as I do, and muckle easier, and I'm sure I ne'er cared half sae muckle about Cuddie Headrigg as she did about young Milnwood. Forby that, it's maybe as weel to hae a friend on baith sides; for, if the whigs suld come to tak the Castle, as it's like they may, when there's sae little victual, and the dragoons wasting what's o't, ou, in that case, Milnwood and Cuddie wad hae the upper hand, and their freendship wad be worth siller--I was thinking sae this morning or I heard the news.\"  With this consolatory reflection the damsel went about her usual occupations, leaving her mistress to school her mind as she best might, for eradicating the sentiments which she had hitherto entertained towards Henry Morton.      CHAPTER IV.            Once more into the breach--dear friends, once more!                                                   Henry V.  On the evening of this day, all the information which they could procure led them to expect, that the insurgent army would be with early dawn on their march against Tillietudlem. Lord Evandale's wounds had been examined by Pike, who reported them in a very promising state. They were numerous, but none of any consequence; and the loss of blood, as much perhaps as the boasted specific of Lady Margaret, had prevented any tendency to fever; so that, notwithstanding he felt some pain and great weakness, the patient maintained that he was able to creep about with the assistance of a stick. In these circumstances he refused to be confined to his apartment, both that he might encourage the soldiers by his presence, and suggest any necessary addition to the plan of defence, which the Major might be supposed to have arranged upon something of an antiquated fashion of warfare. Lord Evandale was well qualified to give advice on such subjects, having served, during his early youth, both in France and in the Low Countries. There was little or no occasion, however, for altering the preparations already made; and, excepting on the article of provisions, there seemed no reason to fear for the defence of so strong a place against such assailants as those by whom it was threatened.  With the peep of day, Lord Evandale and Major Bellenden were on the battlements again, viewing and re-viewing the state of their preparations, and anxiously expecting the approach of the enemy. I ought to observe, that the report of the spies had now been regularly made and received; but the Major treated the report that Morton was in arms against the government with the most scornful incredulity.  \"I know the lad better,\" was the only reply he deigned to make; \"the fellows have not dared to venture near enough, and have been deceived by some fanciful resemblance, or have picked up some story.\"  \"I differ from you, Major,\" answered Lord Evandale; \"I think you will see that young gentleman at the head of the insurgents; and, though I shall be heartily sorry for it, I shall not be greatly surprised.\"  \"You are as bad as Claverhouse,\" said the Major, \"who contended yesterday morning down my very throat, that this young fellow, who is as high-spirited and gentleman-like a boy as I have ever known, wanted but an opportunity to place himself at the head of the rebels.\"  \"And considering the usage which he has received, and the suspicions under which he lies,\" said Lord Evandale, \"what other course is open to him? For my own part, I should hardly know whether he deserved most blame or pity.\"  \"Blame, my lord?--Pity!\" echoed the Major, astonished at hearing such sentiments; \"he would deserve to be hanged, that's all; and, were he my own son, I should see him strung up with pleasure--Blame, indeed! But your lordship cannot think as you are pleased to speak?\"  \"I give you my honour, Major Bellenden, that I have been for some time of opinion, that our politicians and prelates have driven matters to a painful extremity in this country, and have alienated, by violence of various kinds, not only the lower classes, but all those in the upper ranks, whom strong party-feeling, or a desire of court-interest, does not attach to their standard.\"  \"I am no politician,\" answered the Major, \"and I do not understand nice distinctions. My sword is the King's, and when he commands, I draw it in his cause.\"  \"I trust,\" replied the young lord, \"you will not find me more backward than yourself, though I heartily wish that the enemy were foreigners. It is, however, no time to debate that matter, for yonder they come, and we must defend ourselves as well as we can.\"  As Lord Evandale spoke, the van of the insurgents began to make their appearance on the road which crossed the top of the hill, and thence descended opposite to the Tower. They did not, however, move downwards, as if aware that, in doing so, their columns would be exposed to the fire of the artillery of the place. But their numbers, which at first seemed few, appeared presently so to deepen and concentrate themselves, that, judging of the masses which occupied the road behind the hill from the closeness of the front which they presented on the top of it, their force appeared very considerable. There was a pause of anxiety on both sides; and, while the unsteady ranks of the Covenanters were agitated, as if by pressure behind, or uncertainty as to their next movement, their arms, picturesque from their variety, glanced in the morning sun, whose beams were reflected from a grove of pikes, muskets, halberds, and battle-axes. The armed mass occupied, for a few minutes, this fluctuating position, until three or four horsemen, who seemed to be leaders, advanced from the front, and occupied the height a little"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6940"],["title","Old Mortality, Volume 2. (#6)"],["body","to the Castle. John Gudyill, who was not without some skill as an artilleryman, brought a gun to bear on this detached group.  \"I'll flee the falcon,\"--(so the small cannon was called,)--\"I'll flee the falcon whene'er your honour gies command; my certie, she'll ruffle their feathers for them!\"  The Major looked at Lord Evandale.  \"Stay a moment,\" said the young nobleman, \"they send us a flag of truce.\"  In fact, one of the horsemen at that moment dismounted, and, displaying a white cloth on a pike, moved forward towards the Tower, while the Major and Lord Evandale, descending from the battlement of the main fortress, advanced to meet him as far as the barricade, judging it unwise to admit him within the precincts which they designed to defend. At the same time that the ambassador set forth, the group of horsemen, as if they had anticipated the preparations of John Gudyill for their annoyance, withdrew from the advanced station which they had occupied, and fell back to the main body.  The envoy of the Covenanters, to judge by his mien and manner, seemed fully imbued with that spiritual pride which distinguished his sect. His features were drawn up to a contemptuous primness, and his half-shut eyes seemed to scorn to look upon the terrestial objects around, while, at every solemn stride, his toes were pointed outwards with an air that appeared to despise the ground on which they trode. Lord Evandale could not suppress a smile at this singular figure.  \"Did you ever,\" said he to Major Bellenden, \"see such an absurd automaton? One would swear it moves upon springs--Can it speak, think you?\"  \"O, ay,\" said the Major; \"that seems to be one of my old acquaintance, a genuine puritan of the right pharisaical leaven.--Stay--he coughs and hems; he is about to summon the Castle with the but-end of a sermon, instead of a parley on the trumpet.\"  The veteran, who in his day had had many an opportunity to become acquainted with the manners of these religionists, was not far mistaken in his conjecture; only that, instead of a prose exordium, the Laird of Langcale--for it was no less a personage--uplifted, with a Stentorian voice, a verse of the twenty-fourth Psalm:  \"Ye gates lift up your heads! ye doors, Doors that do last for aye, Be lifted up\"--  \"I told you so,\" said the Major to Evandale, and then presented himself at the entrance of the barricade, demanding to know for what purpose or intent he made that doleful noise, like a hog in a high wind, beneath the gates of the Castle.  \"I come,\" replied the ambassador, in a high and shrill voice, and without any of the usual salutations or deferences,--\"I come from the godly army of the Solemn League and Covenant, to speak with two carnal malignants, William Maxwell, called Lord Evandale, and Miles Bellenden of Charnwood.\"  \"And what have you to say to Miles Bellenden and Lord Evandale?\" answered the Major.  \"Are you the parties?\" said the Laird of Langcale, in the same sharp, conceited, disrespectful tone of voice.  \"Even so, for fault of better,\" said the Major.  \"Then there is the public summons,\" said the envoy, putting a paper into Lord Evandale's hand, \"and there is a private letter for Miles Bellenden from a godly youth, who is honoured with leading a part of our host. Read them quickly, and God give you grace to fructify by the contents, though it is muckle to be doubted.\"  The summons ran thus: \"We, the named and constituted leaders of the gentlemen, ministers, and others, presently in arms for the cause of liberty and true religion, do warn and summon William Lord Evandale and Miles Bellenden of Charnwood, and others presently in arms, and keeping garrison in the Tower of Tillietudlem, to surrender the said Tower upon fair conditions of quarter, and license to depart with bag and baggage, otherwise to suffer such extremity of fire and sword as belong by the laws of war to those who hold out an untenable post. And so may God defend his own good cause!\"  This summons was signed by John Balfour of Burley, as quarter-master general of the army of the Covenant, for himself, and in name of the other leaders.  The letter to Major Bellenden was from Henry Morton. It was couched in the following language:  \"I have taken a step, my venerable friend, which, among many painful consequences, will, I am afraid, incur your very decided disapprobation. But I have taken my resolution in honour and good faith, and with the full approval of my own conscience. I can no longer submit to have my own rights and those of my fellow-subjects trampled upon, our freedom violated, our persons insulted, and our blood spilt, without just cause or legal trial. Providence, through the violence of the oppressors themselves, seems now to have opened a way of deliverance from this intolerable tyranny, and I do not hold him deserving of the name and rights of a freeman, who, thinking as I do, shall withold his arm from the cause of his country. But God, who knows my heart, be my witness, that I do not share the angry or violent passions of the oppressed and harassed sufferers with whom I am now acting. My most earnest and anxious desire is, to see this unnatural war brought to a speedy end, by the union of the good, wise, and moderate of all parties, and a peace restored, which, without injury to the King's constitutional rights, may substitute the authority of equal laws to that of military violence, and, permitting to all men to worship God according to their own consciences, may subdue fanatical enthusiasm by reason and mildness, instead of driving it to frenzy by persecution and intolerance.  \"With these sentiments, you may conceive with what pain I appear in arms before the house of your venerable relative, which we understand you propose to hold out against us. Permit me to press upon you the assurance, that such a measure will only lead to the effusion of blood--that, if repulsed in the assault, we are yet strong enough to invest the place, and reduce it by hunger, being aware of your indifferent preparations to sustain a protracted siege. It would grieve me to the heart to think what would be the sufferings in such a case, and upon whom they would chiefly fall.  \"Do not suppose, my respected friend, that I would propose to you any terms which could compromise the high and honourable character which you have so deservedly won, and so long borne. If the regular soldiers (to whom I will ensure a safe retreat) are dismissed from the place, I trust no more will be required than your parole to remain neuter during this unhappy contest; and I will take care that Lady Margaret's property, as well as yours, shall be duly respected, and no garrison intruded upon you. I could say much in favour of this proposal; but I fear, as I must in the present instance appear criminal in your eyes, good arguments would lose their influence when coming from an unwelcome quarter. I will, therefore, break off with assuring you, that whatever your sentiments may be hereafter towards me, my sense of gratitude to you can never be diminished or erased; and it would be the happiest moment of my life that should give me more effectual means than mere words to assure you of it. Therefore, although in the first moment of resentment you may reject the proposal I make to you, let not that prevent you from resuming the topic, if future events should render it more acceptable; for whenever, or howsoever, I can be of service to you, it will always afford the greatest satisfaction to                                      \"Henry Morton.\"  Having read this long letter with the most marked indignation, Major Bellenden put it into the hands of Lord Evandale.  \"I would not have believed this,\" he said, \"of Henry Morton, if half mankind had sworn it! The ungrateful, rebellious traitor! rebellious in cold blood, and without even the pretext of enthusiasm, that warms the liver of such a crack-brained fop as our friend the envoy there. But I should have remembered he was a presbyterian--I ought to have been aware that I was nursing a wolf-cub, whose diabolical nature would make him tear and snatch at me on the first opportunity. Were Saint Paul on earth again, and a presbyterian, he would be a rebel in three months--it is in the very blood of them.\"  \"Well,\" said Lord Evandale, \"I will be the last to recommend surrender; but, if our provisions fail, and we receive no relief from Edinburgh or Glasgow, I think we ought to avail ourselves of this opening, to get the ladies, at least, safe out of the Castle.\"  \"They will endure all, ere they would accept the protection of such a smooth-tongued hypocrite,\" answered the Major indignantly; \"I would renounce them for relatives were it otherwise. But let us dismiss the worthy ambassador.--My friend,\" he said, turning to Langcale, \"tell your leaders, and the mob they have gathered yonder, that, if they have not a particular opinion of the hardness of their own skulls, I would advise them to beware how they knock them against these old walls. And let them send no more flags of truce, or we will hang up the messenger in retaliation of the murder of Cornet Grahame.\"  With this answer the ambassador returned to those by whom he had been sent. He had no sooner reached the main body than a murmur was heard amongst the multitude, and there was raised in front of their ranks an ample red flag, the borders of which were edged with blue. As the signal of war and defiance spread out its large folds upon the morning wind, the ancient banner of Lady Margaret's family, together with the royal ensign, were immediately hoisted on the walls of the Tower, and at the same time, a round of artillery was discharged against the foremost ranks of the insurgents, by which they sustained some loss. Their leaders instantly withdrew them to the shelter of the brow of the hill.  \"I think,\" said John Gudyill, while he busied himself in re-charging his guns, \"they hae fund the falcon's neb a bit ower hard for them--It's no"]]]
