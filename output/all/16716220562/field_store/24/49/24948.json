Elisha consecrated Jehu, King of Israel, on condition that he exterminate the house of Ahab; Elisha was Louis XVIII.; Jehu was Cadoudal; the house of Ahab, the Revolution. That is why these pillagers of diligences, who filched the government money to support the war in the Vendée, were called the Companions of Jehu.”  “Sir, I am happy to learn something at my age.”  “Oh, sir! One can always learn, at all times and at all ages; during life one learns man; in death one learns God.”  “But, after all,” my interlocutor said to me with a gesture of impatience, “may I know in what I can assist you?”  “Thus, sir. Four of these young men, leaders of the Companions of Jehu, were executed at Bourg, on the Place du Bastion.”  “In the first place, sir, in Bourg executions do not take place at the Bastion; they execute on the Fair grounds.”  “Now, sir--these last fifteen or twenty years, it is true--since Peytel. But before, especially during the Revolution, they executed on the Place du Bastion.”  “That is possible.”  “It is so. These four young men were called Guyon, Leprêtre, Amiet, and Hyvert.”  “This is the first time I have heard those names.”  “Yet their names made a certain noise at Bourg.”  “Are you sure, sir, that these men were executed here?”  “I am positive.”  “From whom have you derived your information?”  “From a man whose uncle, then in command of the gendarmerie, was present at the execution.”  “Will you tell me this man’s name?”  “Charles Nodier.”  “Charles Nodier, the novelist, the poet?”  “If he were a historian I would not be so insistent, sir. Recently, during a trip to Varennes, I learned what dependence to place upon historians. But precisely because he is a poet, a novelist, I do insist.”  “You are at liberty to do so; but I know nothing of what you desire to learn, and I dare even assert that, if you have come to Bourg solely to obtain information concerning the execution of--what did you call them?”  “Guyon, Leprêtre, Amiet, and Hyvert.”  “You have undertaken a futile voyage. For these last twenty years, sir, I have been searching the town archives, and I have never seen anything relating to what you have just told me.”  “The town archives are not those of the registrar, sir; perhaps at the record office I may be able to find what I am seeking.”  “Ah! sir, if you can find anything among those archives you will be a very clever man! The record office is a chaos, a veritable chaos. You would have to spend a month here, and then--then--”  “I do not expect to stay here more than a day, sir; but if in that day I should find what I am seeking will you permit me to impart it to you?”  “Yes, sir; yes, sir; and you will render me a great service by doing so.”  “No greater than the one I asked of you. I shall merely give you some information about a matter of which you were ignorant, that is all.”  You can well understand that on leaving my magistrate, my honor was piqued. I determined, cost what it might, to procure this information about the Companions of Jehu. I went back to Milliet, and cornered him.  “Listen,” he said. “My brother-in-law is a lawyer.”  “He’s my man! Let’s go find the brother-in-law.”  “He’s in court at this hour.”  “Then let us go to court.”  “Your appearance will create a sensation, I warn you.”  “Then go alone--tell him what we want, and let him make a search. I will visit the environs of the town to base my work on the localities. We will meet at four o’clock at the Place du Bastion, if you are agreed.”  “Perfectly.”  “It seems to me that I saw a forest, coming here.”  “The forest of Seillon.”  “Bravo!”  “Do you need a forest?”  “It is absolutely indispensable to me.”  “Then permit me--”  “What?”  “I am going to take you to a friend of mine, M. Leduc, a poet who in his spare moments is an inspector.”  “Inspector of what?”  “Of the forest.”  “Are there any ruins in the forest?”  “The Chartreuse, which is not in the forest, but merely some hundred feet from it.”  “And in the forest?”  “There is a sort of hermitage which is called La Correrie, belonging to the Chartreuse, with which it communicates by a subterranean passage.”  “Good! Now, if you can provide me with a grotto you will overwhelm me.”  “We have the grotto of Ceyzeriat, but that is on the other side of the Reissouse.”  “I don’t mind. If the grotto won’t come to me, I will do like Mahomet--I will go to the grotto. In the meantime let us go to M. Leduc.”  Five minutes later we reached M. Leduc’s house. He, on learning what we wanted, placed himself, his horse, and his carriage at my disposal. I accepted all. There are some men who offer their services in such a way that they place you at once at your ease.  We first visited the Chartreuse. Had I built it myself it could not have suited me better. A deserted cloister, devastated garden, inhabitants almost savages. Chance, I thank thee!  From there we went to the Correrie; it was the supplement of the Chartreuse. I did not yet know what I could do with it; but evidently it might be useful to me.  “Now, sir,” I said to my obliging guide, “I need a pretty site, rather gloomy, surrounded by tall trees, beside a river. Have you anything like that in the neighborhood?”  “What do you want to do with it?”  “To build a château there.”  “What kind of a château?”  “Zounds! of cards! I have a family to house, a model mother, a melancholy young girl, a mischievous brother, and a poaching gardener.”  “There is a place called Noires-Fontaines.”  “In the first place the name is charming.”  “But there is no château there.”  “So much the better, for I should have been obliged to demolish it.”  “Let us go to Noires-Fontaines.”  We started; a quarter of an hour later we descended at the ranger’s lodge.  “Shall we take this little path?” said M. Leduc; “it will take us where you want to go.”  It led us, in fact, to a spot planted with tall trees which overshadowed three or four rivulets.  “We call this place Noires-Fontaines,” M. Leduc explained.  “And here Madame de Montrevel, Amélie and little Edouard will dwell. Now what are those villages which I see in front of me?”  “Here, close at hand, is Montagnac; yonder, on the mountain side, Ceyzeriat.”  “Is that where the grotto is?”  “Yes. But how did you know there was a grotto at Ceyzeriat?”  “Never mind, go on. The name of those other villages, if you please.”  “Saint-Just, Tréconnas, Ramasse, Villereversure.”  “That will do.”  “Have you enough?”  “Yes.”  I drew out my note-book, sketched a plan of the locality and wrote about in their relative positions the names of the villages which M. Leduc had just pointed out to me.  “That’s done!” said I.  “Where shall we go now?”  “Isn’t the church of Brou near this road?”  “Yes.”  “Then let us go to the church of Brou.”  “Do you need that in your novel?”  “Yes, indeed; you don’t imagine I am going to lay my scene in a country which contains the architectural masterpiece of the sixteenth century without utilizing that masterpiece, do you?”  “Let us go to the church of Brou.”  A quarter of an hour later the sacristan showed us into this granite jewel-case which contains the three marble gems called the tombs of Marguerite of Austria, Marguerite or Bourbon, and of Philibert le Beau.  “How is it,” I asked the sacristan, “that all these masterpieces were not reduced to powder during the Revolution?”  “Ah! sir, the municipality had an idea.”  “What was it?”  “That of turning the church into a storage house for fodder.”  “Yes, and the hay saved the marble; you are right, my friend, that _was_ an idea.”  “Does this idea of the municipality afford you another?” asked M. Leduc.  “Faith, yes, and I shall have poor luck if I don’t make something out of it.”  I looked at my watch. “Three o’clock! Now for the prison. I have an appointment with M. Milliet at four on the Place du Bastion.”  “Wait; there is one thing more.”  “What is that?”  “Have you noticed Marguerite of Austria’s motto?”  “No; where is it?”  “Oh, all over. In the first place, look above her tomb.”  “‘Fortune, infortune, fort’une.’”  “Exactly.”  “Well, what does this play of words mean?”  “Learned men translate it thus: ‘Fate persecutes a woman much.’”  “Explain that a little.”  “You must, in the first place, assume that it is derived from the Latin.”  “True, that is probable.”  “Well, then: ‘Fortuna infortunat--’”  “Oh! Oh! ‘Infortunat.’”  “Bless me!”  “That strongly resembles a solecism!”  “What do you want?”  “An explanation.”  “Explain it yourself.”  “Well; ‘Fortuna, infortuna, forti una.’ ‘Fortune and misfortune are alike to the strong.’”  “Do you know, that may possibly be the correct translation?”  “Zounds! See what it is not to be learned, my dear sir; we are endowed with common-sense, and that sees clearer than science. Have you anything else to tell me?”  “No.”  “Then let us go to the prison.”  We got into the carriage and returned to the city, stopping only at the gate of the prison. I glanced out of the window.  “Oh!” I exclaimed, “they have spoiled it for me.”  “What! They’ve spoiled it for you?”  “Certainly, it was not like this in my prisoners’ time. Can I speak to the jailer?”  “Certainly.”  “Then let us consult him.”  We knocked at the door. A man about forty opened it. He recognized M. Leduc.  “My dear fellow,” M. Leduc said to him, “this is one of my learned friends--”  “Come, come,” I exclaimed, interrupting him, “no nonsense.”  “Who contends,” continued M. Leduc, “that the prison is no longer the same as it was in the last century?”  “That is true, M. Leduc, it was torn down and rebuilt in 1816.”  “Then the interior arrangements are no longer the same?”  “Oh! no, sir, everything was changed.”  “Could I see the old plan?”  “M. Martin, the architect, might perhaps be able to find one for you.”  “Is he any relation to M. Martin, the lawyer?”  “His brother.”  “Very well, my friend, then I can get my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7079"],["title","The Companions of Jehu (#4)"],["body","an.”  “Then we have nothing more to do here?” inquired M. Leduc.  “Nothing.”  “Then I am free to go home?”  “I shall be sorry to leave you, that is all.”  “Can you find your way to the Bastion without me?”  “It is close by.”  “What are you going to do this evening?”  “I will spend it with you, if you wish.”  “Very good! You will find a cup of tea waiting for you at nine.”  “I shall be on hand for it.”  I thanked M. Leduc. We shook hands and parted.  I went down the Rue des Lisses (meaning Lists, from a combat which took place in the square to which it leads), and skirting the Montburon Garden, I reached the Place du Bastion. This is a semicircle now used as the town marketplace. In the midst stands the statue of Bichat by David d’Angers. Bichat, in a frockcoat--why that exaggeration of realism?--stands with his hand upon the heart of a child about nine or ten years old, perfectly nude--why that excess of ideality? Extended at Bichat’s feet lies a dead body. It is Bichat’s book “Of Life and of Death” translated into bronze. I was studying this statue, which epitomizes the defects and merits of David d’Angers, when I felt some one touch my shoulder. I turned around; it was M. Milliet. He held a paper in his hand.  “Well?” I asked.  “Well, victory!”  “What is that you have there?”  “The minutes of the trial and execution.”  “Of whom?”  “Of your men.”  “Of Guyon, Leprêtre, Amiet--!”  “And Hyvert.”  “Give it to me.”  “Here it is.”  I took it and read:    REPORT OF THE DEATH AND EXECUTION OF LAURENT GUYON, ETIENNE   HYVERT, FRANÇOIS AMIET, ANTOINE LEPRÊTRE. Condemned the twentieth   Thermidor of the year VIII., and executed the twenty-third   Vendemiaire of the year IX.    To-day, the twenty-third Vendemiaire of the year IX., the   government commissioner of the tribunal, who received at eleven   of the evening the budget of the Minister of Justice, containing   the minutes of the trial and the judgment which condemns to   death Laurent Guyon, Etienne Hyvert, François Amiet and Antoine   Leprêtre;--the decision of the Court of Appeals of the sixth   inst., rejecting the appeal against the sentence of the   twenty-first Thermidor of the year VIII., I did notify by letter,   between seven and eight of the morning, the four accused that   their sentence of death would take effect to-day at eleven o’clock.   In the interval which elapsed before eleven o’clock, the four   accused shot themselves with pistols and stabbed themselves with   blows from a poinard in prison. Leprêtre and Guyon, according   to public rumor, were dead; Hyvert fatally wounded and dying;   Amiet fatally wounded, but still conscious. All four, in this   state, were conveyed to the scaffold, and, living or dead, were   guillotined. At half after eleven, the sheriff, Colin, handed in   the report of their execution to the Municipality for registration   upon the death roll:    The captain of gendarmerie remitted to the Justice of the Peace   a report of what had occurred in the prison, of which he was a   witness. I, who was not present, do certify to what I have learned   by hearsay only.      (Signed) DUBOST, _Clerk_.    Bourg, 23d Vendemiaire of the year IX.  Ah! so it was the poet who was right and not the historian! The captain of gendarmerie, who remitted the report of the proceedings in the prison to the Justice of the Peace, at which he was present, was Nodier’s uncle. This report handed to the Justice of the Peace was the story which, graven upon the young man’s mind, saw the light some forty years later unaltered, in that masterpiece entitled “Souvenirs de la Révolution.” The entire series of papers was in the record office. M. Martin offered to have them copied for me; inquiry, trial and judgment.  I had a copy of Nodier’s “Souvenirs of the Revolution” in my pocket. In my hand I held the report of the execution which confirmed the facts therein stated.  “Now let us go to our magistrate,” I said to M. Milliet.  “Let us go to our magistrate,” he repeated.  The magistrate was confounded, and I left him convinced that poets know history as well as historians--if not better.  ALEX. DUMAS.     PROLOGUE. THE CITY OF AVIGNON  We do not know if the prologue we are going to present to our readers’ eyes be very useful, nevertheless we cannot resist the desire to make of it, not the first chapter, but the preface of this book.  The more we advance in life, the more we advance in art, the more convinced we become that nothing is abrupt and isolated; that nature and society progress by evolution and not by chance, and that the event, flower joyous or sad, perfumed or fetid, beneficent or fatal, which unfolds itself to-day before our eyes, was sown in the past, and had its roots sometimes in days anterior to ours, even as it will bear its fruits in the future.  Young, man accepts life as it comes, enamored of yestereen, careless of the day, heeding little the morrow. Youth is the springtide with its dewy dawns and its beautiful nights; if sometimes a storm clouds the sky, it gathers, mutters and disperses, leaving the sky bluer, the atmosphere purer, and Nature more smiling than before. What use is there in reflecting on this storm that passes swift as a caprice, ephemeral as a fancy? Before we have discovered the secret of the meteorological enigma, the storm will have disappeared.  But it is not thus with the terrible phenomena, which at the close of summer, threaten our harvests; or in the midst of autumn, assail our vintages; we ask whither they go, we query whence they come, we seek a means to prevent them.  To the thinker, the historian, the poet, there is a far deeper subject for reflection in revolutions, these tempests of the social atmosphere which drench the earth with blood, and crush an entire generation of men, than in those upheavals of nature which deluge a harvest, or flay the vineyards with hail--that is to say, the fruits of a single harvest, wreaking an injury, which can at the worst be repaired the ensuing year; unless the Lord be in His days of wrath.  Thus, in other days, be it forgetfulness, heedlessness or ignorance perhaps--(blessed he who is ignorant! a fool he who is wise!)--in other days in relating the story which I am going to tell you to-day I would, without pausing at the place where the first scene of this book occurs, have accorded it but a superficial mention, and traversing the Midi like any other province, have named Avignon like any other city.  But to-day it is no longer the same; I am no longer tossed by the flurries of spring, but by the storms of summer, the tempests of autumn. To-day when I name Avignon, I evoke a spectre; and, like Antony displaying Cæsar’s toga, say:    “Look! in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through;   See what a rent the envious Casca made;   Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed--”  So, seeing the bloody shroud of the papal city, I say: “Behold the blood of the Albigenses, and here the blood of the Cevennais; behold the blood of the Republicans, and here the blood of the Royalists; behold the blood of Lescuyer; behold the blood of Maréchal Brune.”  And I feel myself seized with a profound sadness, and I begin to write, but at the first lines I perceive that, without suspecting it, the historian’s chisel has superseded the novelist’s pen in my hand.  Well, let us be both. Reader, grant me these ten, fifteen, twenty pages to the historian; the novelist shall have the rest.  Let us say, therefore, a few words about Avignon, the place where the first scene of the new book which we are offering to the public, opens. Perhaps, before reading what we have to say, it would be well to cast a glance at what its native historian, François Nouguier, says of it.  “Avignon,” he writes, “a town noble for its antiquity, pleasing in its site, superb for its walls, smiling for the fertility of its soil, charming for the gentleness of its inhabitants, magnificent for its palace, beautiful in its broad streets, marvellous in the construction of its bridge, rich because of its commerce, and known to all the world.”  May the shade of François Nouguier pardon us if we do not at first see his city with the same eyes as he does. To those who know Avignon be it to say who has best described it, the historian or the novelist.  It is but just to assert in the first place that Avignon is a town by itself, that is to say, a town of extreme passions. The period of religious dissensions, which culminated for her in political hatreds, dates from the twelfth century. After his flight from Lyons, the valleys of Mont Ventoux sheltered Pierre de Valdo and his Vaudois, the ancestors of those Protestants who, under the name of the Albigenses, cost the Counts of Toulouse, and transferred to the papacy, the seven châteaux which Raymond VI. possessed in Languedoc.  Avignon, a powerful republic governed by podestats, refused to submit to the King of France. One morning Louis VIII., who thought it easier to make a crusade against Avignon like Simon de Montfort, than against Jerusalem like Philippe Auguste; one morning, we say, Louis VIII. appeared before the gates of Avignon, demanding admission with lances at rest, visor down, banners unfurled and trumpets of war sounding.  The bourgeois refused. They offered the King of France, as a last concession, a peaceful entrance, lances erect, and the royal banner alone unfurled. The King laid siege to the town, a siege which lasted three months, during which, says the chronicler, the bourgeois of Avignon returned the French soldiers arrow for arrow, wound for wound, death for death.  The city capitulated at length. Louis VIII. brought the Roman Cardinal-Legate, Saint-Angelo, in his train. It was he who dictated the terms, veritable priestly terms, hard and unconditional. The Avignonese were commanded to demolish their ramparts, to fill their moats, to raze three hundred towers, to sell their vessels, and to burn their engines and machines of war. They had moreover to pay an"]]]
