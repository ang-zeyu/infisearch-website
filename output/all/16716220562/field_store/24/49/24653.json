The Lord Jesus ain't dead--no, no; He died once, but He rose--He's alive for evermore. Don't you ask no strange questions, Mercy, child.\"  \"Oh! but I must--I must,\" answered Cecile, now grown desperate. She threw her sampler on the floor, rose to her feet, and confronted the old woman with her eyes full of tears. \"Whether I'm Mercy or not don't matter, but I'm a very, very careworn little girl--I'm a little girl with a deal, a great deal of care on my mind--and I want Jesus most terrible bad to help me. Mistress Bell, dear Mistress Bell, when you die and see Jesus, won't you ask Him, won't you be certain sure to ask Him to guide me too?\"  \"Why, my darling, He's sure to guide you. There ain't no fear, my dear life. He's sure, sure to take my Mercy, too, to the Celestial City when the right time comes.\"  \"But I don't want Him to take me to the Celestial City. I haven't got to look for nobody in the Celestial City. 'Tis away to France, down into the south of France I've got to go. Will you ask Jesus to come and guide me down into the Pyrenees in the south of France, please, Mistress Bell?\"  \"I don't know nothing of no such outlandish place,\" said old Mrs. Bell, once more irritated and thrown off her bearings, and just at this moment, to Cecile's serious detriment, Lydia Purcell entered.  Lydia was in one of her worst tempers, and old Mrs. Bell, rendered cross for the moment, spoke unadvisedly:  \"Lydia, I do think you're bringing up the child Mercy like a regular heathen. She asks me questions as 'ud break her poor father, my son Robert's heart ef he was to hear. She's a good child, but she's _that_ puzzling. You bid her mind her sampler, and not worry an old woman, Lydia Purcell.\"  Lydia's eyes gazed stormily at Cecile.  \"I'll bid her see and do what she's told,\" she said, going up to the little girl and giving her a shake. \"You go out of the house this minute, miss, and don't let me never see you slinking into this yere room again without my leave.\" She took the child to the door and shut it on her.  Mrs. Bell began to remonstrate feebly. \"Lydia, don't be harsh on my little Mercy,\" she began. \"I like to have her along o' me. I'm mostly alone, and the child makes company.\"  \"Yes, but you have no time for her this morning, for, as I've told you a score of times already to-day, Mr. Preston is coming,\" replied Lydia.  Now Mr. Preston was Mrs. Bell's attorney, and next to her religion, which was most truly real and abiding in her poor old heart, she loved her attorney.     CHAPTER VIII.  \"THE UNION.\"   Lydia had just then plenty of cause for anxiety; for that kind of anxiety which such a woman would feel. She was anxious about the gold she had been so carefully saving, putting by here a pound and there a pound, until the bank held a goodly sum sufficient to support her in comfort in the not very distant day when her residence in Warren's Grove would come to an end.  Whenever Mrs. Bell died, Lydia knew she must look out for a fresh home, and that day could surely now not be very distant.  The old woman had seen her eighty-fifth birthday. Death must be near one so feeble, who was also eighty-five years of age. Lydia would be comfortably off when Mrs. Bell died, and she often reflected with satisfaction that this money, as she enjoyed it, need trouble her with no qualms of conscience--it was all the result of hard work, of patient industry. In her position she could have been dishonest, and it would be untrue to deny that the temptation to be dishonest when no one would be the wiser, when not a soul could possibly ever know, had come to her more than once. But she had never yet yielded to the temptation. \"No, no,\" she had said to her own heart, \"I will enjoy my money by and by with clean hands. It shall be good money. I'm a hard woman, but nothing mean nor unclean shall touch me.\" Lydia made these resolves most often sitting by Mercy's grave. For week after week did she visit this little grave, and kept it bright with flowers and green with all the love her heart could ever know.  But all the same it was about this money which surely she had a right to enjoy, and feel secure and happy in possessing, that Lydia was so anxious now.  She had ground for her fears. As I said before Lydia Purcell had once done a foolish thing. Now her folly was coming home to her. She had been tempted to invest two hundred pounds in an unlimited company. Twenty per cent. she was to receive for this money. This twenty per cent. tempted her. She did the deed, thinking that for a year or two she was safe enough.  But this very morning she had been made uneasy by a letter from Mr. Preston, her own and Mrs. Bell's man of business.  He knew she had invested this money. She had done so against his will.  He told her that ugly rumors were afloat about this very company. And if it went, all Lydia's money, all the savings of her life would be swept away in its downfall.  When he called, which he did that same morning, he could but confirm her fears.  Yes, he would try and sell out for her. He would go to London for the purpose that very day.  Lydia, anxious about her golden calf, the one idol of her life, was not a pleasant mistress of the farm. She was never particularly kind to the children; but now, for the next few days, she was rough and hard to everyone who came within her reach.  The dairymaid and the cook received sharp words, which, fortunately for themselves, they were powerful enough to return with interest. Poor old Mrs. Bell cowered lonely and sad by her fireside. Now and then she asked querulously for Mercy, but no Mercy, real or imaginary, ever came near her; and then her old mind would wander off from the land of Beulah, where she really lived, right across to the Celestial City at the other side of the river. Mrs. Bell was too old and too serene to be rendered really unhappy by Lydia's harsh ways! Her feet were already on the margin of the river, and earth's discords had scarcely power to touch her.  But those who did suffer, and suffer most from Lydia's bad temper, were the children.  They were afraid to stay in her presence. The weather had suddenly turned cold, wet, and wintry. Cecile dared not take Maurice out into the sleet showers which were falling about every ten minutes. All the bright and genial weather had departed. Their happy days in the woods and fields were over, and there was nothing for them but to spend the whole day in their attic bedroom. Here the wind howled fiercely. The badly-fitting window in the roof not only shook, but let in plenty of rain. And Maurice cried from cold and fright. In his London home he had never undergone any real roughing. He wanted a fire, and begged of Cecile to light one; and when she refused, the little spoiled unhappy boy nearly wept himself sick. Cecile looked at Toby, and shook her head despondingly, and Toby answered her with more than one blink from his wise and solemn eyes.  Neither Cecile nor Toby would have fretted about the cold and discomfort for themselves, but both their hearts ached for Maurice.  One day the little boy seemed really ill. He had caught a severe cold, and he shivered, and crouched up now in Cecile's arms with flushed cheeks. His little hands and feet, however, were icy cold. How Cecile longed to take him down to Mrs. Bell's warm room. But she was strictly forbidden to go near the old lady.  At last, rendered desperate, she ventured to do for Maurice what nothing would have induced her to do for herself. She went downstairs, poked about until she found Lydia Purcell, and then in a trembling voice begged from her a few sticks and a little coal to build a fire in the attic bedroom.  Lydia stared at the request, then she refused it.  \"That grate would not burn a fire even if you were to light it,\" she said partly in excuse.  \"But Maurice is so cold. I think he is ill from cold, and you don't like us to stay in the kitchen,\" pleaded the anxious little sister.  \"No, I certainly can't have children pottering about in my way here,\" replied Lydia Purcell. \"And do you know, Cecile--for if you don't 'tis right you should--all that money I was promised for the care of you and your brother, and the odious dog, has never come. You have been living on me for near three months now, and not a blessed sixpence have I had for my trouble. That uncle, or cousin, or whoever he is, in France, has not taken the slightest notice of my letter. There's a nice state of things--and you having the impudence to ask for a fire up in yer very bedroom. What next, I wonder?\"  \"I can't think why the money hasn't come,\" answered Cecile, puckering her brows; \"that money from France always did come to the day--always exactly to the day, it never failed. Father used to say our cousin who had bought his vineyard and farm was reliable. I can't think, indeed, why the money is not here long ago, Mrs. Purcell.\"  \"Well, it han't come, child, and I have got Mr. Preston to write about it, and if he don't have an answer soon and a check into the bargain, out you and Maurice will have to go. I'm a poor woman myself, and I can't afford to keep no beggar brats. That'll be worse nor a fire in your bedroom, I guess, Cecile.\"  \"If the money don't come, where'll you send us, Mrs. Purcell, please?\" asked Cecile, her face very pale.  \"Oh! 'tis easy to know where, child--to the Union, of course.\"  Cecile had never heard of the Union.  \"Is it far away? and is it a nice place?\" she asked innocently.  Lydia laughed and held up her hands.  \"Of all the babies, Cecile D'Albert, you beat them hallow,\" she said. \"No, no, I'll tell you nothing about the Union. You wait till you see it. You're so queer, maybe you'll like it. There's no saying--and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6899"],["title","The Children's Pilgrimage (#8)"],["body"," Maurice'll get his share of the fire. Oh, yes, he'll get his share.\"  \"And Toby! Will Toby come too?\" asked Cecile.  \"Toby! bless you, no. There's a yard of rope for Toby. He'll be managed cheaper than any of you. Now go, child, go!\"     CHAPTER IX.  \"THE ADVENT OF THE GUIDE.\"   Cecile crept upstairs again very, very slowly, and sat down by Maurice's side.  \"Maurice, dear,\" she said to her little brother, \"I ha' no good news for you. Aunt Lydia won't allow no fire, and you must just get right into bed, and I'll lie down and put my arms round you, and Toby shall lie at your feet. You'll soon be warm then, and maybe if you're a very good boy, and don't cry, I'll make up a little fairy tale for you, Maurice.\"  But Maurice was sick and very miserable, and he was in no humor even to be comforted by what at most times he considered the nicest treat in the world--a story made up by Cecile.  \"I hate Aunt Lydia Purcell,\" he said; \"I hate her, Cecile.\"  \"Oh, don't! Maurice, darling. Father often said it was wrong to hate anyone, and maybe Aunt Lydia does find us very expensive. Do you know, Maurice, she told me just now that our cousin in France has never sent her any money all this time? And you know how reliable our cousin always was; and Aunt Lydia says if the money does not come soon, she will send us away, quite away to another home. We are to go to a place called 'The Union.' She says it is not very far away, and that it won't be a bad home. At least, you will have a fire to warm yourself by there, Maurice.\"  \"Oh!\" said Maurice excitedly, \"don't you _hope_ our cousin in France won't send the money, Cecile? Couldn't you write, or get someone to write to him, telling him not to send the money?\"  \"I don't know writing well enough to put it in a letter, Maurice, and, besides, it would not be fair to Aunt Lydia, after her having such expense with us all these months. Don't you remember that delicious apple pie, Maurice, and the red, red apples to eat with bread in the fields? 'Tis only the last few days Aunt Lydia has got really unkind, and perhaps we are very expensive little children. Besides, Maurice, darling, I did not like to tell you at first, but there is one dreadful, dreadful thing about the Union. However nice a home it might be for you and me, we could not take Toby with us, Maurice. Aunt Lydia said Toby would not be taken in.\"  \"Then what would become of our dog?\" asked Maurice, opening his velvety brown eyes very wide.  \"Ah! that I don't understand. Aunt Lydia just laughed, and said Toby should have a yard of rope, and 'twould be cheaper than the Union. I can't in the least find out what she meant.\"  But here Maurice got very red, so red, down below his chin, and into his neck, and even up to the roots of his hair, that Cecile gazed at him in alarm, and feared he had been taken seriously ill.  \"Oh, Cecile!\" he gasped. \"Oh! oh! oh!\" and here he buried his head on his sister's breast.  \"What is it, Maurice? Maurice, speak to me,\" implored his sister. \"Maurice, are very ill? Do speak to me, darling?\"  \"No, Cecile, I'm not ill,\" said the little boy, when he could find voice after his agitation. \"But, oh! Cecile, you must never be angry with me for hating Aunt Lydia again. Cecile, Aunt Lydia is the dreadfullest woman in all the world. _Do_ you know what she meant by a yard of rope?\"  \"No, Maurice; tell me,\" asked Cecile, her face growing white.  \"It means, Cecile, that our dog--our darling, darling Toby--is to be hung, hung till he dies. Our Toby is to be murdered, Cecile, and Aunt Lydia is to be his murderer. That's what it means.\"  \"But, Maurice, how do you know? Maurice, how can you tell?\"  \"It was last week,\" continued the little boy, \"last week, the day you would not come out, Toby and me were in the wood, and we came on a dog hanging to one of the trees by a bit of rope, and the poor dog was dead, and a big boy stood by. Toby howled when he saw the dog, and the big boy laughed; and I said to him, 'What is the matter with the poor dog?' And the dreadful boy laughed again, Cecile, and he said, 'I've been giving him a yard of rope.'  \"And I said, 'But he's dead.'  \"And the boy said, 'Yes, that was what I gave it him for.' That boy was a murderer, and I would not stay in the wood all day, and that is what Aunt Lydia will be; and I hate Aunt Lydia, so I do.\"  Here Maurice went into almost hysterical crying, and Cecile and Toby had both as much as they could do for the next half hour to comfort him.  When he was better, and had been persuaded to get into bed, Cecile said:  \"Me and you need not fret about Toby, Maurice, for our Toby shan't suffer. We won't go into no Union wherever it is, and if the money don't come from France, why, we'll run away, me and you and Toby.\"  \"We'll run away,\" responded Maurice with a smile, and sleepy after his crying fit, and comforted by the warmth of his little bed, he closed his eyes and dropped asleep. His baby mind was quite happy now, for what could be simpler than running away?  Cecile sat on by her little brother's side, and Toby jumped into her lap. Toby had gone through a half hour of much pain. He had witnessed Maurice's tears, Cecile's pale face, and had several times heard his own name mentioned. He was too wise a dog not to know that the children were talking about some possible fate for him, and, by their tones and great distress, he guessed that the fate was not a pleasant one. He had his anxious moments during that half hour. But when Maurice dropped asleep and Cecile sat droopingly by his side, instantly this noble-natured mongrel dog forgot himself. His mission was to comfort the child he loved. He jumped on Cecile's lap, thereby warming her. He licked her face and hands, he looked into her eyes, his own bright and moist with a great wealth of canine love.  \"Oh, Toby,\" said the little girl, holding him very tight, \"Toby! I'd rather have a yard of rope myself than that you should suffer.\"  Toby looked as much as to say:  \"Pooh, that's a trivial matter, don't let's think of it,\" and then he licked her hands again.  Cecile began to wonder if it would not be better for them not to wait for that letter from France. There was no saying, now that Aunt Lydia was really proved to be a wicked woman, what she might do, if they gave her time after the letter arrived. Would it not be best for Cecile, Maurice, and Toby to set off at once on that mission into France? Would it not be wisest, young as Cecile was, to begin the great search for Lovedy without delay? The little girl thought she had better secure her purse of money, and set off at once. But oh! she was so ignorant, so ignorant, and so young. Should she, Maurice, and Toby go east, west, north, or south? She had a journey before her, and she did not know a step of the way.  \"Oh, Toby,\" she said again to the watchful dog, \"if only I had a guide. I do want a guide so dreadfully. And there is a guide called Jesus, and He loves everybody, and He guides people and little children, and perhaps dogs like you, Toby, right across to the New Jerusalem and the Celestial City. But I want Him to guide us into the south of France. He's so kind He would take us into his arms when we were tired and rest us. You and me, Toby, are strong, but Maurice is only a baby. If Jesus would guide us, He would take Maurice into His arms now and then. But Mistress Bell says she never heard of Jesus guiding anybody into the south of France, into the Pyrenees. Oh, how I wish He would!\"  \"Yes,\" answered Toby, by means of his expressive eyes, and wagging his stumpy tail, \"I wish He would.\"  That night when Cecile and Maurice were asleep, and all the house was still, a messenger of kingly aspect came to the old farm.  Had Cecile opened her eyes then, and had she been endowed with power to tear away the slight film which hides immortal things from our view, she would have seen the Guide she longed for. For Jesus came down, and in her sleep took Mrs. Bell across the river. Without a pang the old pilgrim entered into rest, and no one knew in that slumbering household the moment she went home.  But I think--it may be but a fancy of mine--still I think Jesus did more. I think He went up still higher in that old farmhouse. I think He entered an attic bedroom and bent over two sleeping children, and smiled on them, and blessed them, and said to the anxious heart of one, \"Certainly I will be with thee. I will guide My little lamb every step of the way.\"  For Cecile looked so happy in her childish slumbers. Every trace of care had left her brow. The burden of responsibility was gone from her heart.  I think, before He left the room, Jesus stooped down and gave her a kiss of peace.     CHAPTER X.  \"TOPSY-TURVY.\"   It may have seemed a strange thing, but, nevertheless, it was a fact, that one who appeared to make no difference to anybody while she was alive should yet be capable of causing quite a commotion the moment she was dead.  This was the case with old Mrs. Bell. For years she had lived in her pleasant south room, basking in the sun in summer, and half sleeping by the fire in winter. She never read; she spoke very little; she did not even knit, and never, by any chance, did she stir outside those four walls. She was in a living tomb, and was forgotten there. The four walls of her room were her grave. Lydia Purcell, to all intents and purposes, was mistress of all she surveyed.  But from the moment it was discovered that Mrs. Bell was dead--from the moment it was known that the time had come to shut her up in four much smaller walls--the aspect of everything was changed. She was no longer a person of no importance.  No importance! Her name was in everybody's mouth. The servants talked of her. The villagers whispered, and came and asked to look at her; and then they commented on the peaceful old face, and one or two shed tears and inwardly breathed a prayer that their last end might be like hers.  The house was full of subdued bustle and decorous"]]]
