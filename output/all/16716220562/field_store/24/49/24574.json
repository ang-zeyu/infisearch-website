I'll go down to the office and see if we can't have a state-room together. But where is he going to live when he gets to England?\"  \"Where is he going to live? Why, at Windles, of course. Where else?\"  \"But I thought you were letting Windles for the summer?\"  Mrs. Hignett stared.  \"Letting Windles!\" She spoke as one might address a lunatic. \"What put that extraordinary idea into your head?\"  \"I thought father said something about your letting the place to some American.\"  \"Nothing of the kind!\"  It seemed to Sam that his aunt spoke somewhat vehemently, even snappishly, in correcting what was a perfectly natural mistake. He could not know that the subject of letting Windles for the summer was one which had long since begun to infuriate Mrs. Hignett. People had certainly asked her to let Windles. In fact people had pestered her. There was a rich fat man, an American named Bennett, whom she had met just before sailing at her brother's house in London. Invited down to Windles for the day, Mr. Bennett had fallen in love with the place and had begged her to name her own price. Not content with this, he had pursued her with his pleadings by means of the wireless telegraph while she was on the ocean, and had not given up the struggle even when she reached New York. He had egged on a friend of his, a Mr. Mortimer, to continue the persecution in that city. And, this very morning, among the letters on Mrs. Hignett's table, the buff envelope of a cable from Mr. Bennett had peeped out, nearly spoiling her breakfast. No wonder, then, that Sam's allusion to the affair had caused the authoress of \"The Spreading Light\" momentarily to lose her customary calm.  \"Nothing will induce me ever to let Windles,\" she said with finality, and rose significantly. Sam, perceiving that the audience was at an end--and glad of it--also got up.  \"Well, I think I'll be going down and seeing about that state-room,\" he said.  \"Certainly. I am a little busy just now, preparing notes for my next lecture.\"  \"Of course, yes. Mustn't interrupt you. I suppose you're having a great time, gassing away--I mean--well, good-bye!\"  \"Good-bye!\"  Mrs. Hignett, frowning, for the interview had ruffled her and disturbed that equable frame of mind which is so vital to the preparation of lectures on Theosophy, sat down at the writing-table and began to go through the notes which she had made overnight. She had hardly succeeded in concentrating herself when the door opened to admit the daughter of Erin once more.  \"Ma'am there was a gentleman.\"  \"This is intolerable!\" cried Mrs. Hignett. \"Did you tell him that I was busy?\"  \"I did not. I loosed him into the dining-room.\"  \"Is he a reporter from one of the newspapers?\"  \"He is not. He has spats and a tall-shaped hat. His name is Bream Mortimer.\"  \"Bream Mortimer!\"  \"Yes, ma'am. He handed me a bit of a kyard, but I dropped it, being slippy from the dishes.\"  Mrs. Hignett strode to the door with a forbidding expression. This, as she had justly remarked, was intolerable. She remembered Bream Mortimer. He was the son of the Mr. Mortimer who was the friend of the Mr. Bennett who wanted Windles. This visit could only have to do with the subject of Windles, and she went into the dining-room in a state of cold fury, determined to squash the Mortimer family once and for all.  Bream Mortimer was tall and thin. He had small, bright eyes and a sharply curving nose. He looked much more like a parrot than most parrots do. It gave strangers a momentary shock of surprise when they saw Bream Mortimer in restaurants eating roast beef. They had the feeling that he would have preferred sun-flower seeds.  \"Morning, Mrs. Hignett.\"  \"Please sit down.\"  Bream Mortimer sat down. He looked as though he would rather have hopped on to a perch, but he sat down. He glanced about the room with gleaming, excited eyes.  \"Mrs. Hignett, I must have a word with you alone!\"  \"You _are_ having a word with me alone.\"  \"I hardly know how to begin.\"  \"Then let me help you. It is quite impossible. I will never consent.\"  Bream Mortimer started.  \"Then you have heard!\"  \"I have heard about nothing else since I met Mr. Bennett in London. Mr. Bennett talked about nothing else. Your father talked about nothing else. And now,\" cried Mrs. Hignett fiercely, \"you come and try to reopen the subject. Once and for all nothing will alter my decision. No money will induce me to let my house.\"  \"But I didn't come about that!\"  \"You did not come about Windles?\"  \"Good Lord, no!\"  \"Then will you kindly tell me why you have come?\"  Bream Mortimer looked embarrassed. He wriggled a little and moved his arms as if he were trying to flap them.  \"You know,\" he said, \"I'm not a man who butts into other people's affairs.\" ... He stopped.  \"No?\" said Mrs. Hignett.  Bream began again.  \"I'm not a man who gossips with servants.\"  \"No?\"  \"I'm not a man who....\"  Mrs. Hignett was never a very patient woman.  \"Let us take all your negative qualities for granted,\" she said curtly. \"I have no doubt that there are many things which you do not do. Let us confine ourselves to issues of definite importance. What is it, if you have no objection to concentrating your attention on that for a moment, that you wish to see me about?\"  \"This marriage.\"  \"What marriage?\"  \"Your son's marriage.\"  \"My son is not married.\"  \"No, but he's going to be. At eleven o'clock this morning at the Little Church Round the Corner!\"  Mrs. Hignett stared.  \"Are you mad?\"  \"Well, I'm not any too well pleased, I'm bound to say,\" admitted Mr. Mortimer. \"You see, darn it all, I'm in love with the girl myself!\"  \"Who is this girl?\"  \"Have been for years. I'm one of those silent, patient fellows who hang around and look a lot, but never tell their love....\"  \"Who is this girl who has entrapped my son?\"  \"I've always been one of those men who....\"  \"Mr. Mortimer! With your permission we will take your positive qualities, also, for granted. In fact, we will not discuss you at all. You come to me with this absurd story....\"  \"Not absurd. Honest fact. I had it from my valet, who had it from her maid, and, though I'm not a man who gossips with servants, I'm bound to say....\"  \"Will you please tell me who is the girl my misguided son wishes to marry?\"  \"I don't know that I'd call him misguided,\" said Mr. Mortimer, as one desiring to be fair, \"I think he's a right smart picker! She's such a corking girl, you know. We were children together, and I've loved her for years. Ten years at least. But you know how it is--somehow one never seems to get in line for a proposal. I thought I saw an opening in the summer of nineteen-twelve, but it blew over. I'm not one of these smooth, dashing guys, you see, with a great line of talk. I'm not....\"  \"If you will kindly,\" said Mrs. Hignett impatiently, \"postpone this essay in psycho-analysis to some future occasion I shall be greatly obliged. I am waiting to hear the name of the girl my son wishes to marry.\"  \"Haven't I told you?\" said Mr. Mortimer, surprised. \"That's odd. I haven't! It's funny how one doesn't do the things one thinks one does. I'm the sort of man...\"  \"What is her name?\"  \"Bennett.\"  \"Bennett? Wilhelmina Bennett? The daughter of Mr. Rufus Bennett? The red-haired girl I met at lunch one day at your father's house?\"  \"That's it. You're a great guesser. I think you ought to stop the thing.\"  \"I intend to.\"  \"Fine!\"  \"The marriage would be unsuitable in every way. Miss Bennett and my son do not vibrate on the same plane.\"  \"That's right. I've noticed it myself.\"  \"Their auras are not the same colour.\"  \"If I've thought that once,\" said Bream Mortimer, \"I've thought it a hundred times. I wish I had a dollar for every time I've thought it. Not the same colour! That's the whole thing in a nutshell.\"  \"I am much obliged to you for coming and telling me of this. I shall take immediate steps.\"  \"That's good! But what's the procedure? How are you going to form a flying-wedge and buck-centre? It's getting late. She'll be waiting at the church at eleven. With bells on,\" said Mr. Mortimer.  \"Eustace will not be there.\"  \"You think you can fix it?\"  \"Eustace will not be there,\" repeated Mrs. Hignett.  Bream Mortimer hopped down from his chair.  \"Well, you've taken a weight off my mind.\"  \"A mind, I should imagine, scarcely constructed to bear great weights.\"  \"I'll be going. Haven't had breakfast yet. Too worried to eat breakfast. Relieved now. This is where three eggs and a rasher of ham get cut off in their prime. I feel I can rely on you.\"  \"You can!\"  \"Then I'll say good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye.\"  \"I mean really good-bye. I'm sailing for England on Saturday on the _Atlantic_.\"  \"Indeed? My son will be your fellow-traveller.\"  Bream Mortimer looked somewhat apprehensive.  \"You won't tell him that I was the one who spilled the beans?\"  \"I beg your pardon.\"  \"You won't wise him up that I threw a spanner into the machinery?\"  \"I do not understand you.\"  \"You won't tell him that I crabbed his act--gave the thing away--gummed the game?\"  \"I shall not mention your chivalrous intervention.\"  \"Chivalrous?\" said Bream Mortimer doubtfully. \"I don't know that I'd call it absolutely chivalrous. Of course, all's fair in love and war. Well, I'm glad you're going to keep my share in the business under your hat. It might have been awkward meeting him on board.\"  \"You are not likely to meet Eustace on board. He is a very indifferent sailor and spends most of his time in his cabin.\"  \"That's good! Saves a lot of awkwardness. Well, good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye. When you reach England remember me to your father.\"  \"He won't have forgotten you,\" said Bream Mortimer confidently. He did not see how it was humanly possible for anyone to forget this woman. She was like a celebrated chewing-gum. The taste lingered.  Mrs. Hignett was a woman of instant and decisive action.

By the time the door had closed behind Bream Mortimer she had at her disposal no fewer than seven, all good. It took her but a moment to select the best and simplest. She tip-toed softly to her son's room. Rhythmic snores greeted her listening ears. She opened the door and went noiselessly in.     CHAPTER TWO   The White Star liner _Atlantic_ lay at her pier with steam up and gangway down ready for her trip to Southampton. The hour of departure was near and there was a good deal of mixed activity going on. Sailors fiddled about with ropes. Junior officers flitted to and fro. White-jacketed stewards wrestled with trunks. Probably the captain, though not visible, was also employed on some useful work of a nautical nature and not wasting his time. Men, women, boxes, rugs, dogs, flowers and baskets of fruit were flowing on board in a steady stream.  The usual drove of citizens had come to see the travellers off. There were men on the passenger-list who were being seen off by fathers, by mothers, by sisters, by cousins, and by aunts. In the steerage there was an elderly Jewish lady who was being seen off by exactly thirty-seven of her late neighbours in Rivington Street. And two men in the second cabin were being seen off by detectives, surely the crowning compliment a great nation can bestow. The cavernous customs shed was congested with friends and relatives, and Sam Marlowe, heading for the gang-plank, was only able to make progress by employing all the muscle and energy which Nature had bestowed upon him, and which during the twenty-five years of his life he had developed by athletic exercise. However, after some minutes of silent endeavour, now driving his shoulder into the midriff of some obstructing male, now courteously lifting some stout female off his feet, he had succeeded in struggling to within a few yards of his goal, when suddenly a sharp pain shot through his right arm and he spun round with a cry.  It seemed to Sam that he had been bitten, and this puzzled him, for New York crowds, though they may shove and jostle, rarely bite.  He found himself face to face with an extraordinarily pretty girl.  She was a red-haired girl with the beautiful ivory skin which goes with red hair. Her eyes, though they were under the shadow of her hat, and he could not be certain, he diagnosed as green, or maybe blue, or possibly grey. Not that it mattered, for he had a catholic taste in feminine eyes. So long as they were large and bright, as were the specimens under his immediate notice, he was not the man to quibble about a point of colour. Her nose was small, and on the very tip of it there was a tiny freckle. Her mouth was nice and wide, her chin soft and round. She was just about the height which every girl ought to be. Her figure was trim, her feet tiny, and she wore one of those dresses of which a man can say no more than that they look pretty well all right.  Nature abhors a vacuum. Samuel Marlowe was a susceptible young man, and for many a long month his heart had been lying empty, all swept and garnished, with \"Welcome\" on the mat. This girl seemed to rush in and fill it. She was not the prettiest girl he had ever seen. She was the third prettiest. He had an orderly mind, one capable of classifying and docketing girls. But there was a subtle something about her, a sort of how-shall-one-put-it, which he had never encountered before. He swallowed convulsively. His well-developed chest swelled beneath its covering of blue flannel and invisible stripe. At last, he told himself, he was in love, really in love, and at first sight, too, which made it all the more impressive. He doubted whether in the whole course of history anything like this had ever happened before to anybody. Oh, to clasp this girl to him and--  But she had bitten him in the arm. That was hardly the right spirit. That, he felt, constituted an obstacle.  \"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" she cried.  Well, of course, if she regretted her rash act ... After all, an impulsive girl might bite a man in the arm in the excitement of the moment and still have a sweet, womanly nature....  \"The crowd seems to make Pinky-Boodles so nervous.\"  Sam might have remained mystified, but at this juncture there proceeded from a bundle of rugs in the neighbourhood of the girl's lower ribs a sharp yapping sound, of such a calibre as to be plainly audible over the confused noise of Mamies who were telling Sadies to be sure and write, of Bills who were instructing Dicks to look up old Joe in Paris and give him their best, and of all the fruit-boys, candy-boys, magazine-boys, American-flag-boys, and telegraph boys who were honking their wares on every side.  \"I hope he didn't hurt you much. You're the third person he's bitten to-day.\" She kissed the animal in a loving and congratulatory way on the tip of his black nose. \"Not counting bell-boys, of course,\" she added. And then she was swept from him in the crowd and he was left thinking of all the things he might have said--all those graceful, witty, ingratiating things which just make a bit of difference on these occasions.  He had said nothing. Not a sound, exclusive of the first sharp yowl of pain, had proceeded from him. He had just goggled. A rotten exhibition! Perhaps he would never see this girl again. She looked the sort of girl who comes to see friends off and doesn't sail herself. And what memory of him would she retain? She would mix him up with the time when she went to visit the deaf-and-dumb hospital.  Sam reached the gang-plank, showed his ticket, and made his way through the crowd of passengers, passengers' friends, stewards, junior officers, and sailors who infested the deck. He proceeded down the main companion-way, through a rich smell of india-rubber and mixed pickles, as far as the dining-saloon: then turned down the narrow passage leading to his stateroom.  Staterooms on ocean liners are curious things. When you see them on the chart in the passenger-office, with the gentlemanly clerk drawing rings round them in pencil, they seem so vast that you get the impression that, after stowing away all your trunks, you will have room left over to do a bit of entertaining--possibly an informal dance or something. When you go on board you find that the place has shrunk to the dimensions of an undersized cupboard in which it would be impossible to swing a cat. And then, about the second day out, it suddenly expands again. For one reason or another the necessity for swinging cats does not arise and you find yourself quite comfortable.  Sam, balancing himself on the narrow, projecting ledge which the chart in the passenger-office had grandiloquently described as a lounge, began to feel the depression which marks the second phase. He almost wished now that he had not been so energetic in having his room changed in order to enjoy the company of his cousin Eustace. It was going to be a tight fit. Eustace's bag was already in the cabin, and it seemed to take up the entire fairway. Still, after all, Eustace was a good sort, and would be a cheerful companion. And Sam realised that if that girl with the red hair was not a passenger on the boat he was going to have need of diverting society.  A footstep sounded in the passage outside. The door opened.  \"Hullo, Eustace!\" said Sam.  Eustace Hignett nodded listlessly, sat down on his bag and emitted a deep sigh. He was a small, fragile-looking young man with a pale, intellectual face. Dark hair fell in a sweep over his forehead. He looked like a man who would write _vers libre_, as indeed he did. \"Hullo!\" he said, in a hollow voice.  Sam regarded him blankly. He had not seen him for some years, but, going by his recollections of him at the University, he had expected something cheerier than this. In fact, he had rather been relying on Eustace to be the life and soul of the party. The man sitting on the bag before him could hardly have filled that role at a gathering of Russian novelists.  \"What on earth's the matter?\" said Sam.  \"The matter?\" Eustace Hignett laughed mirthlessly. \"Oh, nothing. Nothing much. Nothing to signify. Only my heart's broken.\" He eyed with considerable malignity the bottle of water in the rack above his head, a harmless object provided by the White Star Company for clients who might desire to clean their teeth during the voyage.  \"If you would care to hear the story?\" he said.  \"Go ahead.\"  \"It is quite short.\"  \"That's good.\"  \"Soon after I arrived in America I met a girl....\"  \"Talking of girls,\" said Marlowe with enthusiasm. \"I've just seen the only one in the world that really amounts to anything. It was like this. I was shoving my way through the mob on the dock, when suddenly....\"  \"Shall I tell you my story, or will you tell me yours?\"  \"Oh, sorry! Go ahead.\"  Eustace Hignett scowled at the printed notice on the wall informing occupants of the stateroom that the name of their steward was J. B. Midgeley.  \"She was an extraordinarily pretty girl....\"  \"So was mine. I give you my honest word I never in all my life saw such....\"  \"Of course, if you would prefer that I postponed my narrative?\" said Eustace coldly.  \"Oh, sorry! Carry on.\"  \"She was an extraordinarily pretty girl....\"  \"What was her name?\"  \"Wilhelmina Bennett. She was an extraordinarily pretty girl and highly intelligent. I read her all my poems and she appreciated them immensely. She enjoyed my singing. My conversation appeared to interest her. She admired my....\"  \"I see. You made a hit. Now get on with the rest of the story.\"  \"Don't bustle me,\" said Eustace querulously.  \"Well, you know, the voyage only takes eight days.\"  \"I've forgotten where I was.\"  \"You were saying what a devil of a chap she thought you. What happened? I suppose, when you actually came to propose, you found she was engaged to some other johnny?\"  \"Not at all. I asked her to be my wife, and she consented. We both agreed that a quiet wedding was what we"]]]
