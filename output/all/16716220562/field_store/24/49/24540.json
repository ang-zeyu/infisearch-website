All is hot and fierce and passionate, ardent and unashamed in its exulting and importunate desire for life and love. And, do you know that the scarlet lilies are woven petal by petal from my heart's blood, these little quivering birds are my soul made incarnate music, these heavy perfumes are my emotions dissolved into aerial essence, this flaming blue and gold sky is the 'very me,' that part of me that incessantly and insolently, yes, and a little deliberately, triumphs over that other part--a thing of nerves and tissues that suffers and cries out, and that must die to-morrow perhaps, or twenty years hence.\"  Then there was her humour, which was part of her strange wisdom, and was always awake and on the watch.  In all her letters, written in exquisite English prose, but with an ardent imagery and a vehement sincerity of emotion which make them, like the poems, indeed almost more directly, un-English, Oriental, there was always this intellectual, critical sense of humour, which could laugh at one's own enthusiasm as frankly as that enthusiasm had been set down.  And partly the humour, like the delicate reserve of her manner, was a mask or a shelter.  \"I have taught myself,\" she writes to me from India, \"to be commonplace and like everybody else superficially.  Every one thinks I am so nice and cheerful, so 'brave,' all the banal things that are so comfortable to be.  My mother knows me only as 'such a tranquil child, but so strong-willed.'  A tranquil child!\" And she writes again, with deeper significance: \"I too have learnt the subtle philosophy of living from moment to moment.  Yes, it is a subtle philosophy, though it appears merely an epicurean doctrine: 'Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die.'  I have gone through so many yesterdays when I strove with Death that I have realised to its full the wisdom of that sentence; and it is to me not merely a figure of speech, but a literal fact.  Any to-morrow I might die.  It is scarcely two months since I came back from the grave:  is it worth while to be anything but radiantly glad? Of all things that life or perhaps my temperament has given me I prize the gift of laughter as beyond price.\"  Her desire, always, was to be \"a wild free thing of the air like the birds, with a song in my heart.\"  A spirit of too much fire in too frail a body, it was rarely that her desire was fully granted.  But in Italy she found what she could not find in England, and from Italy her letters are radiant.  \"This Italy is made of gold,\" she writes from Florence, \"the gold of dawn and daylight, the gold of the stars, and, now dancing in weird enchanting rhythms through this magic month of May, the gold of fireflies in the perfumed darkness--'aerial gold.'  I long to catch the subtle music of their fairy dances and make a poem with a rhythm like the quick irregular wild flash of their sudden movements.  Would it not be wonderful?  One black night I stood in a garden with fireflies in my hair like darting restless stars caught in a mesh of darkness.  It gave me a strange sensation, as if I were not human at all, but an elfin spirit.  I wonder why these little things move me so deeply?  It is because I have a most 'unbalanced intellect,' I suppose.\"  Then, looking out on Florence, she cries, \"God! how beautiful it is, and how glad I am that I am alive to-day!\"  And she tells me that she is drinking in the beauty like wine, \"wine, golden and scented, and shining, fit for the gods; and the gods have drunk it, the dead gods of Etruria, two thousand years ago.  Did I say dead?  No, for the gods are immortal, and one might still find them loitering in some solitary dell on the grey hillsides of Fiesole.  Have I seen them?  Yes, looking with dreaming eyes, I have found them sitting under the olives, in their grave, strong, antique beauty--Etruscan gods!\"  In Italy she watches the faces of the monks, and at one moment longs to attain to their peace by renunciation, longs for Nirvana; \"then, when one comes out again into the hot sunshine that warms one's blood, and sees the eager hurrying faces of men and women in the street, dramatic faces over which the disturbing experiences of life have passed and left their symbols, one's heart thrills up into one's throat.  No, no, no, a thousand times no! how can one deliberately renounce this coloured, unquiet, fiery human life of the earth?\"  And, all the time, her subtle criticism is alert, and this woman of the East marvels at the women of the West, \"the beautiful worldly women of the West,\" whom she sees walking in the Cascine, \"taking the air so consciously attractive in their brilliant toilettes, in the brilliant coquetry of their manner!\"  She finds them \"a little incomprehensible,\" \"profound artists in all the subtle intricacies of fascination,\" and asks if these \"incalculable frivolities and vanities and coquetries and caprices\" are, to us, an essential part of their charm?  And she watches them with amusement as they flutter about her, petting her as if she were a nice child, a child or a toy, not dreaming that she is saying to herself sorrowfully:  \"How utterly empty their lives must be of all spiritual beauty IF they are nothing more than they appear to be.\"  She sat in our midst, and judged us, and few knew what was passing behind that face \"like an awakening soul,\" to use one of her own epithets.  Her eyes were like deep pools, and you seemed to fall through them into depths below depths.  ARTHUR SYMONS.    FOLK SONGS    PALANQUIN BEARERS    Lightly, O lightly we bear her along,   She sways like a flower in the wind of our song;   She skims like a bird on the foam of a stream,   She floats like a laugh from the lips of a dream.   Gaily, O gaily we glide and we sing,   We bear her along like a pearl on a string.    Softly, O softly we bear her along,   She hangs like a star in the dew of our song;   She springs like a beam on the brow of the tide,   She falls like a tear from the eyes of a bride.   Lightly, O lightly we glide and we sing,   We bear her along like a pearl on a string.    WANDERING SINGERS    (Written to one of their Tunes)    Where the voice of the wind calls our wandering feet,   Through echoing forest and echoing street,   With lutes in our hands ever-singing we roam,   All men are our kindred, the world is our home.    Our lays are of cities whose lustre is shed,   The laughter and beauty of women long dead;   The sword of old battles, the crown of old kings,   And happy and simple and sorrowful things.    What hope shall we gather, what dreams shall we sow?   Where the wind calls our wandering footsteps we go.   No love bids us tarry, no joy bids us wait:   The voice of the wind is the voice of our fate.    INDIAN WEAVERS    Weavers, weaving at break of day,   Why do you weave a garment so gay? . . .   Blue as the wing of a halcyon wild,   We weave the robes of a new-born child.    Weavers, weaving at fall of night,   Why do you weave a garment so bright? . . .   Like the plumes of a peacock, purple and green,   We weave the marriage-veils of a queen.    Weavers, weaving solemn and still,   What do you weave in the moonlight chill? . . .   White as a feather and white as a cloud,   We weave a dead man's funeral shroud.    COROMANDEL FISHERS    Rise, brothers, rise, the wakening skies pray        to the morning light,   The wind lies asleep in the arms of the dawn        like a child that has cried all night.   Come, let us gather our nets from the shore,        and set our catamarans free,   To capture the leaping wealth of the tide, for        we are the sons of the sea.    No longer delay, let us hasten away in the        track of the sea-gull's call,   The sea is our mother, the cloud is our brother,        the waves are our comrades all.   What though we toss at the fall of the sun        where the hand of the sea-god drives?   He who holds the storm by the hair, will hide        in his breast our lives.    Sweet is the shade of the cocoanut glade, and        the scent of the mango grove,   And sweet are the sands at the full o' the        moon with the sound of the voices we love.   But sweeter, O brothers, the kiss of the spray        and the dance of the wild foam's glee:   Row, brothers, row to the blue of the verge,        where the low sky mates with the sea.    THE SNAKE-CHARMER    Whither dost thou hide from the magic of my flute-call?   In what moonlight-tangled meshes of perfume,   Where the clustering keovas guard the squirrel's slumber,   Where the deep woods glimmer with the jasmine's bloom?    I'll feed thee, O beloved, on milk and wild red honey,   I'll bear thee in a basket of rushes, green and white,   To a palace-bower where golden-vested maidens   Thread with mellow laughter the petals of delight.    Whither dost thou loiter, by what murmuring hollows,   Where oleanders scatter their ambrosial fire?   Come, thou subtle bride of my mellifluous wooing,   Come, thou silver-breasted moonbeam of desire!    CORN-GRINDERS    O LITTLE MOUSE, WHY DOST THOU CRY   WHILE MERRY STARS LAUGH IN THE SKY?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah, who will ease my bitter pain?   He went to seek a millet-grain   In the rich farmer's granary shed;   They caught him in a baited snare,   And slew my lover unaware:   Alas! alas! my lord is dead.    O LITTLE DEER, WHY DOST THOU MOAN,   HID IN THY FOREST-BOWER ALONE?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah! who will quiet my lament?    At fall of eventide he went   To drink beside the river-head;   A waiting hunter threw his dart,   And struck my lover through the heart.   Alas! alas! my lord is dead.    O LITTLE BRIDE, WHY DOST THOU WEEP   WITH ALL THE HAPPY WORLD ASLEEP?    Alas! alas! my lord is dead!   Ah, who will stay these hungry tears,   Or still the want of famished years,   And crown with love my marriage-bed?   My soul burns with the quenchless fire   That lit my lover's funeral pyre:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/680"],["title","The Golden Threshold (#2)"],["body","   Alas! alas! my lord is dead.    VILLAGE-SONG    Honey, child, honey, child, whither are you going?   Would you cast your jewels all to the breezes blowing?   Would you leave the mother who on golden grain has fed you?   Would you grieve the lover who is riding forth to wed you?    Mother mine, to the wild forest I am going,   Where upon the champa boughs the champa buds are blowing;   To the koil-haunted river-isles where lotus lilies glisten,   The voices of the fairy folk are calling me: O listen!    Honey, child, honey, child, the world is full of pleasure,   Of bridal-songs and cradle-songs and sandal-scented leisure.   Your bridal robes are in the loom, silver and saffron glowing,   Your bridal cakes are on the hearth: O whither are you going?    The bridal-songs and cradle-songs have cadences of sorrow,   The laughter of the sun to-day, the wind of death to-morrow.   Far sweeter sound the forest-notes where forest-streams are falling;   O mother mine, I cannot stay, the fairy-folk are calling.    IN PRAISE OF HENNA    A kokila called from a henna-spray:   LIRA! LIREE! LIRA! LIREE!   Hasten, maidens, hasten away   To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.   Send your pitchers afloat on the tide,   Gather the leaves ere the dawn be old,   Grind them in mortars of amber and gold,   The fresh green leaves of the henna-tree.    A kokila called from a henna-spray:   LIRA! LIREE! LIRA! LIREE!   Hasten maidens, hasten away   To gather the leaves of the henna-tree.   The tilka's red for the brow of a bride,   And betel-nut's red for lips that are sweet;   But, for lily-like fingers and feet,   The red, the red of the henna-tree.    HARVEST HYMN         Men's Voices    Lord of the lotus, lord of the harvest,   Bright and munificent lord of the morn!   Thine is the bounty that prospered our sowing,   Thine is the bounty that nurtured our corn.   We bring thee our songs and our garlands for tribute,   The gold of our fields and the gold of our fruit;   O giver of mellowing radiance, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Surya, with cymbal and flute.    Lord of the rainbow, lord of the harvest,   Great and beneficent lord of the main!   Thine is the mercy that cherished our furrows,   Thine is the mercy that fostered our grain.   We bring thee our thanks and our garlands for tribute,   The wealth of our valleys, new-garnered and ripe;   O sender of rain and the dewfall, we hail thee,   We praise thee, Varuna, with cymbal and pipe.          Women's Voices    Queen of the gourd-flower, queen of the harvest,   Sweet and omnipotent mother, O Earth!   Thine is the plentiful bosom that feeds us,   Thine is the womb where our riches have birth.   We bring thee our love and our garlands for tribute,   With gifts of thy opulent giving we come;   O source of our manifold gladness, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Prithvi, with cymbal and drum.          All Voices    Lord of the Universe, Lord of our being,   Father eternal, ineffable Om!   Thou art the Seed and the Scythe of our harvests,   Thou art our Hands and our Heart and our Home.   We bring thee our lives and our labours for tribute,   Grant us thy succour, thy counsel, thy care.   O Life of all life and all blessing, we hail thee,   We praise thee, O Bramha, with cymbal and prayer.    INDIAN LOVE-SONG        She    Like a serpent to the calling voice of flutes,   Glides my heart into thy fingers, O my Love!   Where the night-wind, like a lover, leans above   His jasmine-gardens and sirisha-bowers;   And on ripe boughs of many-coloured fruits   Bright parrots cluster like vermilion flowers.          He    Like the perfume in the petals of a rose,   Hides thy heart within my bosom, O my love!   Like a garland, like a jewel, like a dove   That hangs its nest in the asoka-tree.   Lie still, O love, until the morning sows   Her tents of gold on fields of ivory.    CRADLE-SONG       From groves of spice,      O'er fields of rice,   Athwart the lotus-stream,      I bring for you,      Aglint with dew   A little lovely dream.       Sweet, shut your eyes,      The wild fire-flies   Dance through the fairy neem;      From the poppy-bole      For you I stole   A little lovely dream.       Dear eyes, good-night,      In golden light   The stars around you gleam;      On you I press      With soft caress   A little lovely dream.    SUTTEE    Lamp of my life, the lips of Death   Hath blown thee out with their sudden breath;   Naught shall revive thy vanished spark . . .   Love, must I dwell in the living dark?    Tree of my life, Death's cruel foot   Hath crushed thee down to thy hidden root;   Nought shall restore thy glory fled . . .   Shall the blossom live when the tree is dead?    Life of my life, Death's bitter sword   Hath severed us like a broken word,   Rent us in twain who are but one . .   Shall the flesh survive when the soul is gone?    SONGS FOR MUSIC   SONG OF A DREAM    Once in the dream of a night I stood   Lone in the light of a magical wood,   Soul-deep in visions that poppy-like sprang;   And spirits of Truth were the birds that sang,   And spirits of Love were the stars that glowed,   And spirits of Peace were the streams that flowed   In that magical wood in the land of sleep.    Lone in the light of that magical grove,   I felt the stars of the spirits of Love   Gather and gleam round my delicate youth,   And I heard the song of the spirits of Truth;   To quench my longing I bent me low   By the streams of the spirits of Peace that flow   In that magical wood in the land of sleep.    HUMAYUN TO ZOBEIDA    (From the Urdu)    You flaunt your beauty in the rose, your glory in the dawn,   Your sweetness in the nightingale, your whiteness in the swan.    You haunt my waking like a dream, my slumber like a moon,   Pervade me like a musky scent, possess me like a tune.    Yet, when I crave of you, my sweet, one tender moment's grace,   You cry, \"I SIT BEHIND THE VEIL, I CANNOT SHOW MY FACE.\"    Shall any foolish veil divide my longing from my bliss?   Shall any fragile curtain hide your beauty from my kiss?    What war is this of THEE and ME? Give o'er the wanton strife,   You are the heart within my heart, the life within my life.    AUTUMN SONG    Like a joy on the heart of a sorrow,      The sunset hangs on a cloud;   A golden storm of glittering sheaves,   Of fair and frail and fluttering leaves,      The wild wind blows in a cloud.    Hark to a voice that is calling      To my heart in the voice of the wind:   My heart is weary and sad and alone,   For its dreams like the fluttering leaves have gone,      And why should I stay behind?    ALABASTER    Like this alabaster box whose art   Is frail as a cassia-flower, is my heart,   Carven with delicate dreams and wrought   With many a subtle and exquisite thought.    Therein I treasure the spice and scent   Of rich and passionate memories blent   Like odours of cinnamon, sandal and clove,   Of song and sorrow and life and love.    ECSTASY    Cover mine eyes, O my Love!      Mine eyes that are weary of bliss   As of light that is poignant and strong      O silence my lips with a kiss,   My lips that are weary of song!    Shelter my soul, O my love!      My soul is bent low with the pain   And the burden of love, like the grace      Of a flower that is smitten with rain:   O shelter my soul from thy face!    TO MY FAIRY FANCIES    Nay, no longer I may hold you,      In my spirit's soft caresses,   Nor like lotus-leaves enfold you      In the tangles of my tresses.   Fairy fancies, fly away      To the white cloud-wildernesses,            Fly away!    Nay, no longer ye may linger      With your laughter-lighted faces,   Now I am a thought-worn singer      In life's high and lonely places.   Fairy fancies, fly away,      To bright wind-inwoven spaces,            Fly away!    POEMS    ODE TO H.H. THE NIZAM OF HYDERABAD    (Presented at the Ramzan Durbar)    Deign, Prince, my tribute to receive,   This lyric offering to your name,   Who round your jewelled scepter bind   The lilies of a poet's fame;   Beneath whose sway concordant dwell   The peoples whom your laws embrace,   In brotherhood of diverse creeds,   And harmony of diverse race:    The votaries of the Prophet's faith,   Of whom you are the crown and chief   And they, who bear on Vedic brows   Their mystic symbols of belief;    And they, who worshipping the sun,   Fled o'er the old Iranian sea;   And they, who bow to Him who trod   The midnight waves of Galilee.    Sweet, sumptuous fables of Baghdad   The splendours of your court recall,   The torches of a Thousand Nights   Blaze through a single festival;   And Saki-singers down the streets,   Pour for us, in a stream divine,   From goblets of your love-ghazals   The rapture of your Sufi wine.    Prince, where your radiant cities smile,   Grim hills their sombre vigils keep,   Your ancient forests hoard and hold   The legends of their centuried sleep;   Your birds of peace white-pinioned float   O'er ruined fort and storied plain,   Your faithful stewards sleepless guard   The harvests of your gold and grain.    God give you joy, God give you grace   To shield the truth and smite the wrong,   To honour Virtue, Valour, Worth.   To cherish faith and foster song.   So may the lustre of your days   Outshine the deeds Firdusi sung,   Your name within a nation's prayer,   Your music on a nation's tongue.    LEILI    The serpents are asleep among the poppies,   The fireflies light the soundless panther's way   To tangled paths where shy gazelles are straying,   And parrot-plumes outshine the dying day.   O soft! the lotus-buds upon the stream   Are stirring like sweet maidens when they dream.    A caste-mark on the azure brows of Heaven,   The golden moon burns sacred, solemn, bright   The winds are dancing in the forest-temple,   And swooning at the holy feet of Night.   Hush! in the silence mystic voices sing   And make the gods their incense-offering.    IN THE FOREST    Here, O my heart, let us burn the dear"]]]
