Elsa and Marvin had become engaged some few days before, and were generally to be found at this time sitting together in some shaded spot in the grounds of the Keith's Long Island home.  \"What's troubling Betty, I wonder,\" said Elsa. \"She looks worried.\"  Marvin turned his head.  \"Is that your friend, Miss Silver?\"  \"That's Betty. We were at college together. I want you to like Betty.\"  \"Then I will. When did she arrive?\"  \"Last night. She's here for a month. What's the matter, Betty? This is Marvin. I want you to like Marvin.\"  Betty Silver smiled. Her face, in repose, was rather wistful, but it lighted up when she smiled, and an unsuspected dimple came into being on her chin.  \"Of course I shall,\" she said.  Her big gray eyes seemed to search Marvin's for an instant and Marvin had, almost subconsciously, a comfortable feeling that he had been tested and found worthy.  \"What were you scowling at so ferociously, Betty?\" asked Elsa.  \"Was I scowling? I hope you didn't think it was at you. Oh, Elsa, I'm miserable! I shall have to leave this heavenly place.\"  \"Betty!\"  \"At once. And I was meaning to have the most lovely time. See what has come!\"  She held out some flimsy sheets of paper.  \"A cable!\" said Elsa.  \"Great Scott! it looks like the scenario of a four-act play,\" said Marvin. \"That's not all one cable, surely? Whoever sent it must be a millionaire.\"  \"He is. It's from my stepfather. Read it out, Elsa. I want Mr. Rossiter to hear it. He may be able to tell me where Mervo is. Did you ever hear of Mervo, Mr. Rossiter?\"  \"Never. What is it?\"  \"It's a place where my stepfather is, and where I've got to go. I do call it hard. Go on, Elsa.\"  Elsa, who had been skimming the document with raised eyebrows, now read it out in its spacious entirety.     _On receipt of this come instantly Mervo without moment    delay vital importance presence urgently required come    wherever you are cancel engagements urgent necessity hustle    have advised bank allow you draw any money you need expenses    have booked stateroom Mauretania sailing Wednesday don't fail    catch arrive Fishguard Monday train London sleep London catch    first train Tuesday Dover now mind first train no taking root    in London and spending a week shopping mid-day boat Dover    Calais arrive Paris Tuesday evening Dine Paris catch train de    luxe nine-fifteen Tuesday night for Marseilles have engaged    sleeping coupe now mind Tuesday night no cutting loose around    Paris stores you can do all that later on just now you want to    get here right quick arrive Marseilles Wednesday morning boat    Mervo Wednesday night will meet you Mervo now do you follow    all that because if not cable at once and say which part of    journey you don't understand now mind special points to be    remembered firstly come instantly secondly no cutting loose    around London Paris stores see._                                             _SCOBELL._  \"_Well!_\" said Elsa, breathless.  \"By George!\" said Marvin. \"He certainly seems to want you badly enough. He hasn't spared expense. He has put in about everything you could put into a cable.\"  \"Except why he wants me,\" said Betty.  \"Yes,\" said Elsa. \"Why does he want you? And in such a desperate hurry, too!\"  Marvin was re-reading the message.  \"It isn't a mere invitation,\" he said. \"There's no come-right-along-you'll-like-this-place-it's-fine about it. He seems to look on your company more as a necessity than a luxury. It's a sort of imperious C.Q.D.\"  \"That's what makes it so strange. We have hardly met for years. Why, he didn't even know where I was. The cable was sent to the bank and forwarded on. And I don't know where he is!\"  \"Which brings us back,\" said Marvin, \"to mysterious Mervo. Let us reason inductively. If you get to the place by taking a boat from Marseilles, it can't be far from the French coast. I should say at a venture that Mervo is an island in the Mediterranean. And a small island for if it had been a big one we should have heard of it.\"  \"Marvin!\" cried Elsa, her face beaming with proud affection. \"How clever you are!\"  \"A mere gift,\" he said modestly. \"I have been like that from a boy.\" He got up from his chair. \"Isn't there an encyclopaedia in the library, Elsa?\"  \"Yes, but it's an old edition.\"  \"It will probably touch on Mervo. I'll go and fetch it.\"  As he crossed the terrace, Elsa turned quickly to Betty.  \"Well?\" she said.  Betty smiled at her.  \"He's a dear. Are you very happy, Elsa?\"  Elsa's eyes danced. She drew in her breath softly. Betty looked at her in silence for a moment. The wistful expression was back on her face.  \"Elsa,\" she said, suddenly. \"What is it like? How does it feel, knowing that there's someone who is fonder of you than anything--?\"  Elsa closed her eyes.  \"It's like eating berries and cream in a new dress by moonlight on a summer night while somebody plays the violin far away in the distance so that you can just hear it,\" she said.  Her eyes opened again.  \"And it's like coming along on a winter evening and seeing the windows lit up and knowing you've reached home.\"  Betty was clenching her hands, and breathing quickly.  \"And it's like--\"  \"Elsa, don't! I can't bear it!\"  \"Betty! What's the matter?\"  Betty smiled again, but painfully.  \"It's stupid of me. I'm just jealous, that's all. I haven't got a Marvin, you see. You have.\"  \"Well, there are plenty who would like to be your Marvin.\"  Betty's face grew cold.  \"There are plenty who would like to be Benjamin Scobell's son-in-law,\" she said.  \"Betty!\" Elsa's voice was serious. \"We've been friends for a good long time, so you'll let me say something, won't you? I think you're getting just the least bit hard. Now turn and rend me,\" she added good-humoredly.  \"I'm not going to rend you,\" said Betty. \"You're perfectly right. I am getting hard. How can I help it? Do you know how many men have asked me to marry them since I saw you last? Five.\"  \"Betty!\"  \"And not one of them cared the slightest bit about me.\"  \"But, Betty, dear, that's just what I mean. Why should you say that? How can you know?\"  \"How do I know? Well, I do know. Instinct, I suppose. The instinct of self-preservation which nature gives hunted animals. I can't think of a single man in the world--except your Marvin, of course--who wouldn't do anything for money.\" She stopped. \"Well, yes, one.\"  Elsa leaned forward eagerly.  \"Who, Betty?\"  \"You don't know him.\"  \"But what's his name?\"  Betty hesitated.  \"Well, if I am on the witness-stand--Maude.\"  \"Maude? I thought you said a man?\"  \"It's his name. John Maude.\"  \"But, Betty! Why didn't you tell me before? This is tremendously interesting.\"  Betty laughed shortly.  \"Not so very, really. I only met him two or three times, and I haven't seen him for years, and I don't suppose I shall ever see him again. He was a friend of Alice Beecher's brother, who was at Harvard. Alice took me over to meet her brother, and Mr. Maude was there. That's all.\"  Elsa was plainly disappointed.  \"But how do you know, then--? What makes you think that he--?\"  \"Instinct, again, I suppose. I do know.\"  \"And you've never met him since?\"  Betty shook her head. Elsa relapsed into silence. She had a sense of pathos.  At the further end of the terrace Marvin Rossiter appeared, carrying a large volume.  \"Here we are,\" he said. \"Scared it up at the first attempt. Now then.\"  He sat down, and opened the book.  \"You don't want to hear all about how Jason went there in search of the Golden Fleece, and how Ulysses is supposed to have taken it in on his round-trip? You want something more modern. Well, it's an island in the Mediterranean, as I said, and I'm surprised that you've never heard of it, Elsa, because it's celebrated in its way. It's the smallest independent state in the world. Smaller than Monaco, even. Here are some facts. Its population when this encyclopaedia was printed--there may be more now--was eleven thousand and sixteen. It was ruled over up to 1886 by a prince. But in that year the populace appear to have said to themselves, 'When in the course of human events....' Anyway, they fired the prince, and the place is now a republic. So that's where you're going, Miss Silver. I don't know if it's any consolation to you, but the island, according to this gentleman, is celebrated for the unspoilt beauty of its scenery. He also gives a list of the fish that can be caught there. It takes up about three lines.\"  \"But what can my stepfather be doing there? I last heard of him in London. Well, I suppose I shall have to go.\"  \"I suppose you will,\" said Elsa mournfully. \"But, oh, Betty, what a shame!\"     CHAPTER II  MERVO AND ITS OWNER   \"By heck!\" cried Mr. Benjamin Scobell.  He wheeled round from the window, and transferred his gaze from the view to his sister Marion; losing by the action, for the view was a joy to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6955"],["title","The Prince and Betty (#1)"],["body","eye, which his sister Marion was not.  Mervo was looking its best under the hot morning sun. Mr. Scobell's villa stood near the summit of the only hill the island possessed, and from the window of the morning-room, where he had just finished breakfast, he had an uninterrupted view of valley, town, and harbor--a two-mile riot of green, gold and white, and beyond the white the blue satin of the Mediterranean. Mr. Scobell did not read poetry except that which advertised certain breakfast foods in which he was interested, or he might have been reminded of the Island of Flowers in Tennyson's \"Voyage of Maeldive.\" Violets, pinks, crocuses, yellow and purple mesembryanthemum, lavender, myrtle, and rosemary ... his two-mile view contained them all. The hillside below him was all aglow with the yellow fire of the mimosa. But his was not one of those emotional natures to which the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears. A primrose by the river's brim a simple primrose was to him--or not so much a simple primrose, perhaps, as a basis for a possible Primrosina, the Soap that Really Cleans You.  He was a nasty little man to hold despotic sway over such a Paradise: a goblin in Fairyland. Somewhat below the middle height, he was lean of body and vulturine of face. He had a greedy mouth, a hooked nose, liquid green eyes and a sallow complexion. He was rarely seen without a half-smoked cigar between his lips. This at intervals he would relight, only to allow it to go out again; and when, after numerous fresh starts, it had dwindled beyond the limits of convenience, he would substitute another from the reserve supply that protruded from his vest-pocket.         *       *       *       *       *  How Benjamin Scobell had discovered the existence of Mervo is not known. It lay well outside the sphere of the ordinary financier. But Mr. Scobell took a pride in the versatility of his finance. It distinguished him from the uninspired who were content to concentrate themselves on steel, wheat and such-like things. It was Mr. Scobell's way to consider nothing as lying outside his sphere. In a financial sense he might have taken Terence's _Nihil humanum alienum_ as his motto. He was interested in innumerable enterprises, great and small. He was the power behind a company which was endeavoring, without much success, to extract gold from the mountains of North Wales, and another which was trying, without any success at all, to do the same by sea water. He owned a model farm in Indiana, and a weekly paper in New York. He had financed patent medicines, patent foods, patent corks, patent corkscrews, patent devices of all kinds, some profitable, some the reverse.  Also--outside the ordinary gains of finance--he had expectations. He was the only male relative of his aunt, the celebrated Mrs. Jane Oakley, who lived in a cottage on Staten Island, and was reputed to spend five hundred dollars a year--some said less--out of her snug income of eighteen million. She was an unusual old lady in many ways, and, unfortunately, unusually full of deep-rooted prejudices. The fear lest he might inadvertently fall foul of these rarely ceased to haunt Mr. Scobell.  This man of many projects had descended upon Mervo like a stone on the surface of some quiet pool, bubbling over with modern enterprise in general and, in particular, with a scheme. Before his arrival, Mervo had been an island of dreams and slow movement and putting things off till to-morrow. The only really energetic thing it had ever done in its whole history had been to expel his late highness, Prince Charles, and change itself into a republic. And even that had been done with the minimum of fuss. The Prince was away at the time. Indeed, he had been away for nearly three years, the pleasures of Paris, London and Vienna appealing to him more keenly than life among his subjects. Mervo, having thought the matter over during these years, decided that it had no further use for Prince Charles. Quite quietly, with none of that vulgar brawling which its neighbor, France, had found necessary in similar circumstances, it had struck his name off the pay-roll, and declared itself a republic. The royalist party, headed by General Poineau, had been distracted but impotent. The army, one hundred and fifteen strong, had gone solid for the new regime, and that had settled it. Mervo had then gone to sleep again. It was asleep when Mr. Scobell found it.  The financier's scheme was first revealed to M. d'Orby, the President of the Republic, a large, stout statesman with even more than the average Mervian instinct for slumber. He was asleep in a chair on the porch of his villa when Mr. Scobell paid his call, and it was not until the financier's secretary, who attended the seance in the capacity of interpreter, had rocked him vigorously from side to side for quite a minute that he displayed any signs of animation beyond a snore like the growling of distant thunder. When at length he opened his eyes, he perceived the nightmare-like form of Mr. Scobell standing before him, talking. The financier, impatient of delay, had begun to talk some moments before the great awakening.  \"Sir,\" Mr. Scobell was saying, \"I gotta proposition to which I'd like you to give your complete attention. Shake him some more, Crump. Sir, there's big money in it for all of us, if you and your crowd'll sit in. Money. _Lar' monnay_. No, that means change. What's money, Crump? _Arjong_? There's _arjong_ in it, Squire. Get that? Oh, shucks! Hand it to him in French, Crump.\"  Mr. Secretary Crump translated. The President blinked, and intimated that he would hear more. Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar-stump, and proceeded.  \"Say, you've heard of _Moosieer_ Blonk? Ask the old skeesicks if he's ever heard of _Mersyaw_ Blonk, Crump, the feller who started the gaming-tables at Monte Carlo.\"  Filtered through Mr. Crump, the question became intelligible to the President. He said he had heard of M. Blanc. Mr. Crump caught the reply and sent it on to Mr. Scobell, as the man on first base catches the ball and throws it to second.  Mr. Scobell relighted his cigar.  \"Well, I'm in that line. I'm going to put this island on the map just like old Doctor Blonk put Monte Carlo. I've been studying up all about the old man, and I know just what he did and how he did it. Monte Carlo was just such another jerkwater little place as this is before he hit it. The government was down to its last bean and wondering where the Heck its next meal-ticket was coming from, when in blows Mr. Man, tucks up his shirt-sleeves, and starts the tables. And after that the place never looked back. You and your crowd gotta get together and pass a vote to give me a gambling concession here, same as they did him. Scobell's my name. Hand him that, Crump.\"  Mr. Crump obliged once more. A gleam of intelligence came into the President's dull eye. He nodded once or twice. He talked volubly in French to Mr. Crump, who responded in the same tongue.  \"The idea seems to strike him, sir,\" said Mr. Crump.  \"It ought to, if he isn't a clam,\" replied Mr. Scobell. He started to relight his cigar, but after scorching the tip of his nose, bowed to the inevitable and threw the relic away.  \"See here,\" he said, having bitten the end off the next in order; \"I've thought this thing out from soup to nuts. There's heaps of room for another Monte Carlo. Monte's a dandy place, but it's not perfect by a long way. To start with, it's hilly. You have to take the elevator to get to the Casino, and when you've gotten to the end of your roll and want to soak your pearl pin, where's the hock-shop? Half a mile away up the side of a mountain. It ain't right. In my Casino there's going to be a resident pawnbroker inside the building, just off the main entrance. That's only one of a heap of improvements. Another is that my Casino's scheduled to be a home from home, a place you can be real cosy in. You'll look around you, and the only thing you'll miss will be mother's face. Yes, sir, there's no need for a gambling Casino to look and feel and smell like the reading-room at the British Museum. Comfort, coziness and convenience. That's the ticket I'm running on. Slip that to the old gink, Crump.\"  A further outburst of the French language from Mr. Crump, supplemented on the part of the \"old gink\" by gesticulations, interrupted the proceedings.  \"What's he saying now?\" asked Mr. Scobell.  \"He wants to know--\"  \"Don't tell. Let me guess. He wants to know what sort of a rake-off he and the other somnambulists will get--the darned old pirate! Is that it?\"  Mr. Crump said that that was just it.  \"That'll be all right,\" said Mr. Scobell. \"Old man Blong's offer to the Prince of Monaco was five hundred thousand francs a year--that's somewhere around a hundred thousand dollars in real money--and half the profits made by the Casino. That's my offer, too. See how that hits him, Crump.\"  Mr. Crump investigated.  \"He says he accepts gladly, on behalf of the Republic, sir,\" he announced.  M. d'Orby confirmed the statement by rising, dodging the cigar, and kissing Mr. Scobell on both cheeks.  \"Cut it out,\" said the financier austerely, breaking out of the clinch. \"We'll take the Apache Dance as read. Good-by, Squire. Glad it's settled. Now I can get busy.\"  He did. Workmen poured into Mervo, and in a very short time, dominating the town and reducing to insignificance the palace of the late Prince, once a passably imposing mansion, there rose beside the harbor a mammoth Casino of shining stone.  Imposing as was the exterior, it was on the interior that Mr. Scobell more particularly prided himself, and not without reason. Certainly, a man with money to lose could lose it here under the most charming conditions. It had been Mr. Scobell's object to avoid the cheerless grandeur of the rival institution down the coast. Instead of one large hall sprinkled with tables, each table had a room to itself,"]]]
