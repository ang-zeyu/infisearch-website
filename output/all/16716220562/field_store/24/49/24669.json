They were navigated by Kroomen--or Krooboys as they are sometimes called--and who are a superior race to most of the natives of Africa.  Some of the paddlers and oarsmen in the boats that surrounded the Admiral Dupont were almost six feet in height and splendidly built.  \"Good looking fellows those,\" said the captain, who had joined the group of wondering young adventurers, \"but in spite of their good looks they are petty thieves, if they get the chance.\"  Of this quality, the boys were soon to get an example.  Frank had laid down his field-glasses on a deck chair and didn't give them any more thought, even when the decks were fairly swarming with half-naked, chattering, laughing Kroomen.  When he looked around for them, however, for the purpose of making out more clearly the outline of the distant mountains, the glasses had vanished.  The young leader quickly divined what had occurred and stepping to the rail he held above his head an English sovereign and a pair of glasses, borrowed, from Billy.  \"I'll give this money to the man who finds my field glasses,\" he shouted.  \"It's a long chance,\" he remarked to Harry, \"there may be some one there who understands English.  Anyway they can see that I'm willing to give money for something like the object I held up.\"  As much to Frank's astonishment as anyone else the next minute they heard a hail from a canoe containing two particularly black Kroomen.  \"Hey, boss;\" one of them was shouting, \"what you lost, eh?\"  \"Some one stole my field-glasses,\" shouted back Frank.  \"All right, American massa,\" hailed back the Krooman, \"I sail long time 'Merican ships.  I catch him for you.\"  \"Well, what do you think of that?\" demanded Billy.  \"If the Statue of Liberty had come off her perch and done a song and dance you couldn't have astonished me more than to hear that sack of coal talk English.\"  \"They take several of those fellows to sea on trading ships, that stop in here for logs from the interior,\" struck in Ben.  \"It wouldn't surprise me but what that fellow there has been in New York harbor, yes, and in San Francisco too.\"  The boys looked their astonishment.  \"They are good hard workers,\" went on Ben, \"and make good sailormen. They always come back here though in the end.  They are as home loving as a house cat.\"'  While the boys talked, their baggage was being hoisted into a lighter that lay alongside, ready for shipment ashore.  They were about ready to quit the ship when their attention was attracted by a terrific uproar among the natives alongside.  Two or three canoes had been upset and in the water half a dozen Kroomen were splashing about like big, black fish.  \"They'll drown,\" gasped Harry, as he watched the furious water battle.  \"Not them,\" sniffed Ben, \"they are as much at home in the water as they are ashore.  Hello!\" he exclaimed, suddenly pointing, \"there's your field-glasses again, Frank.\"  Sure enough, from the hands of a spluttering, half-drowned native, the Krooman who spoke English had just wrested a dripping pair of black morocco-covered field-glasses.  He held them aloft in triumph, treading water while he held the other's head under the sea as a punishment for his thievery.  \"I catch 'um, boss, I catch um,\" he kept shouting triumphantly.  A few seconds later, having half drowned the unfortunate thief, he stood dripping like a figure cut out of black basalt before the boy. As he received his recovered property Frank presented its rescuer with the sovereign.  If it had been a fortune the man could not have been more overcome with gratitude.  He sank on his knees.  \"You come ashore my boat?\" he begged.  \"Cost nothing to United States boys.\"  The adventurers assented and, having seen their baggage properly stowed on the lighter, they landed through the surf a short time later and found themselves on the flat, yellow beach facing the rather dreary  looking row of Europeans' houses.  The method of landing the surf boats and the wonderful dexterity with which the natives handle them is worth a whole chapter to itself.  But it might prove tedious reading, so suffice it to say, that with one man standing erect in the stern with a steering oar, and the others paddling like demons, the Ivory Coast boatmen invariably land their passengers, in a smother of foam which seems overwhelming, without spilling a drop of water on them.  Not a visitor to this coast but has been impressed by their wonderful skill.  \"Well, here we are,\" remarked Billy, looking about him at the novel surroundings.  \"The first thing to do,\" announced Frank, \"is to go to the house of Monsieur Desplaines, to whom Mr. Barr gave us a letter of introduction, and talk over our plans.\"  Monsieur Desplaines was the consular agent of the United States government at Assini, which is a French port, and had promised by cable to Mr. Barr to give, the young travelers all the advice that his experiences could suggest.  He had also volunteered to select for them a train of native baggage carriers, and hunters that would be reliable.  There are no roads into the heart of Africa and everything is transported by human pack-trains.  The natives of this part of the coast are strong, muscular men not easily fatigued and are capable of carrying burdens on their heads twenty-five miles or more a day without exhaustion.  As the boys started to make their way up the beach a trim figure with neatly waxed black mustaches, almost extinguished in a huge pith helmet and dressed in white duck with a red sash about the waist, emerged from the nearest house and hastened toward them.  \"Welcome to Africa!\" cried the newcomer as he approached and who, as Frank at once guessed, was M. Desplaines himself.  \"Come with me to the house and make yourselves at home.\"  The boys shook hands warmly with the little Frenchman who seemed so hospitably inclined and followed him eagerly toward the whitewashed house from which he had emerged.  \"I would have been at the steamer to meet you,\" he exclaimed apologetically; \"but she got here a day ahead of time and I was not prepared.\"  Inside the house, which was delightfully cool and darkened by jalousies from the glaring heat outside, the young adventurers were introduced to Madame Desplaines and two little girls, who constituted the family of the consular agent, who also kept the general supply store at Assini.  After dinner that evening, M. Desplaines talked long and earnestly to the boys.  Of the real object of their mission, he had of course no knowledge.  That was kept a secret even from Barr's intimates. There was too much at stake to let it leak out.  His idea was the boys had come on a hunting and exploration, much of which was to be performed by aeroplane.  He informed the boys that, acting on cabled instructions, he had laid in a good supply of gasoline by the last steamer from Sierra Leone and that arrangements for a train of carriers and for boats up the river had been made.  There was a wheezy steam launch belonging to the trading post which would tow the boats up the Bia River as far as they desired.  The Kroomen the boys engaged would take them to that point would then be abandoned, as they refused to go far from the coast.  Such was the outline of M. Desplaines' conversation with the travelers.  The evening was far advanced when already the little party was ready for bed and already their imaginations had been fired by the tales that the consular agent had told them of the interior of the wild Bambara country.  As they were saying good night to their hospitable host and hostess, there was a knock at the door.  In response to M. Desplaines shouted: \"Come in,\" a tall coal-black figure stalked into the lamp-light.  The glow shone warmly on his black skin and lit up the mighty muscles that played beneath it.  The strength of the man was evidently tremendous.  The boys, to their surprise, recognized him at once, as the rescuer of Frank's opera-glasses.  He paid no attention to Desplaines or his family, but walked straight up to Frank.  \"Hi boss, you go hunt, you go far into land of Bambara,\" he said, raising his mighty arm and pointing to the northeast.  Frank nodded.  It was a strange scene.  The boys and Ben in their hunting costumes and stout boots, M. Desplaines, short and inclined to be fat and as neatly barbered and tailored as if he had just stepped off the boulevards, Madame Desplaines and her little girls in cool, white frocks--and in the center of the group--dominating it by his impressive manner and mighty form--the huge, ebony Krooman.  \"In the land of Bambara much game,\" went on the Krooman.  \"So we have heard,\" replied Frank.  \"In the land of Bambara much danger,\" continued the Krooman, fixing his dark eyes full on Frank, \"much danger to the white boys, who fly like birds.\"  \"Why, how do you know that?\" exclaimed Frank, amazed that the Krooman should not only know their destination--which might have been a guess--but have divined the fact that they had an aeroplane.  \"Krooman know much that white man not know!\" replied the giant black.  Then, rising his finger, he counted the amazed group of adventurers who stood transfixed at the scene.  \"One--two--three--four--five go to Bambara,\" he intoned.  \"Come back one--two--three.  Two die.  Sikaso, know.\"  Before any of the astounded party could frame a question or open their lips, the huge figure had stalked to the doorway and vanished.  \"He'd make a nice, comfortable house-pet that fellow,\" said Billy, who was the first to speak.  \"One, two, three, four, five go to Bambara,\" he mimicked.  \"Come back one, two, three.  Two die. Sikaso know.  Br-r-r-r-r, he gives me the creeps.\"  They all laughed at Billy's absurd aping of the stately negro, but nevertheless none of them felt inclined for more talk that night. Somehow, the Krooman had cast a gloom on the party.  Had they known how nearly his prophecy was to come to fulfillment they might even have been tempted to abandon the expedition.     CHAPTER IV  THE WITCH-DOCTOR"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6905"],["title","The Boy Aviators in Africa; Or, an Aerial Ivory Trail (#4)"],["body","and early the next day Frank and Harry were up and stirring, and the other members of the party were not long in joining them. The almost innumerable packing cases and chests containing the duffle, ammunition, armament and the sections of the Golden Eagle were scattered about the little \"compound\" or garden of M. Desplaines' residence, having been brought ashore overnight by a crew of Kroomen.  M. Desplaines appeared while the boys were still contemplating their outfit and wondering if it would be possible to accommodate it all in the little flotilla which, it had been arranged previously, was to take them up the river to the camping place from which they were to strike out for the Ivory Mountain.  \"I really almost envy your trip,\" he said, \"although it will be fraught with danger.  Still you go well armed and provisioned, and from what I have heard of you, you are not the sort of boys to let a few obstacles upset you.\"  While they were still talking and waiting for breakfast to be announced they were joined by a singular figure.  It was that of a white man in rather shabby ducks and crowned, as was M. Desplaines, with a huge, white pith helmet.  Over one shoulder he carried a green butterfly net and under one arm he had tucked a tin box. Round his waist was a leather belt from which hung, in addition to a revolver and cartridges, a glass bottle with a wide stopper with a chloroformed sponge reposing in the bottom.  It did not need the introduction of the newcomer by M. Desplaines as Professor Ajax Wiseman, to tell the boys that Dr. Wiseman was a naturalist.  \"My dear professor, what are you doing here?\" exclaimed M. Desplaines as soon as the introductions were over.  \"I arrived this morning from Grand Bassam on a coasting schooner,\" replied the professor, carefully setting down his tin box.  \"I have a remarkable specimen of the Gladiolus Gorgeosi in there,\" he remarked importantly.  \"I am contemplating a trip into the interior via the Bia River and came to you to see if you could arrange transportation.\"  M. Desplaines looked at the boys.  \"These young men have engaged the steam launch, to tow their expedition up the river,\" he said hesitatingly; \"they are going on a hunting trip, into the interior, and have, I venture to say, one of the most complete outfits I have ever seen.\"  The naturalist looked wistfully at Frank.  \"I suppose there would not be the least objection to my availing myself of your assistance in getting up the river,\" he said, blinking behind his spectacles like an old bat who has unexpectedly emerged into the sunlight.  \"I have only two canoes and as I carry my own attendant I shall be no trouble.\"  \"We shall be delighted to accommodate you,\" rejoined Frank heartily, \"but I shall have to place one restriction on you.  When we reach our destination we must part company as we have work to do of a confidential nature.  Our employer, Mr. Barr--\"  \"Old Luther Barr,\" burst out Professor Wiseman suddenly.  \"Why, yes,\" rejoined Frank, rather taken aback, \"you know him then?\"  \"I--I have heard of him,\" replied the other with a slight hesitancy which was, however, so faint as to be hardly noticeable.  The voice of Madame Desplaines summoning them to breakfast broke off any opportunity for further questions on a matter that plainly, for some strange reason or other, seemed to have heartily interested--even disturbed--the naturalist.  Frank felt troubled for a moment at the idea of having let Professor Wiseman form a portion of their party even for a short distance.  But he dismissed the idea almost instantly.  The queer expression that passed over Professor Wiseman's face at the mention of the ivory trader's name might have simply been due to astonishment at hearing it again.  Still Frank decided to keep an eye on Professor Wiseman.  The conversation at breakfast naturally enough dealt with the little known country the boys were to penetrate.  Then it was for the first time that they heard mention of the mysterious tribe of the Flying Men who were reported to be equipped with rudimentary wings--like those of an undeveloped bat with which they managed to flit from tree top to tree top like true flyers.  \"Oh, come,\" laughed Billy, \"I've heard of tailed men and white Africans with red top-knots like Lathrop, but a race of winged men is coming it too strong.\"  \"Laugh if you like,\" declared Professor Wiseman who had brought up the subject, \"but some time ago I articulated a skeleton brought me by an Arab slave trader and found extending from the shoulder blade two distinct bony frames which had in life apparently been covered with a thin fleshy substance of leathery like tenacity stretching thence to the wrists.  I asked the slave trader where he had found the skeleton,\" went on the savant, \"and he told me he had come across it at the foot of a giant silk cotton tree in the Bambara country.\"  The boys exchanged glances.  It was to the Bambara country--the country of the legendary Flying Men--that they were bound.  \"Is any more known of this tribe?\" inquired Frank.  \"Very little except what you can pick up from the natives, which is little enough,\" replied Professor Wiseman, \"they seem to have a dislike to speaking of the Flying Men--to whites at any rate.  I think, too, they fear them.  Report has it that they live in cave-like holes in the side of a giant, black basalt cliff reached by a subterranean river.  They reach the ground by taking short flights from the holes they live in and regain the cliff dwellings by means of rope ladders formed of twisted creepers.\"  \"Then they cannot fly upward?\" asked Frank.  \"It would seem not,\" replied the naturalist, \"their wings only serve as gliders.  Possibly once in the remote ages they could fly as well as great birds but with the course of the ages and disuse their wings have dwindled.\"  As may be imagined the idea that within a short time they were to be in the country of the mysterious tribe caused a tremendous stir among the boys and when after breakfast their strange friend of the night before, Sikaso, appeared they at once overwhelmed him with questions.  But strangely enough Sikaso made no reply to their eager queries.  He shook his great bead and seemed to be embarrassed, if not by fear at any rate by reticence.  \"In Misoto Mountains many strange Ju-jus (fetishes),\" he said in an awed tone, \"Misoto Mountains no good for white boys--white boys stay away.\"  \"Not much,\" chimed in Harry, \"that's just where we are going.\"  \"You go Misoto Mountain,\" said the giant black in an astonished tone.  \"That's what we are,\" exclaimed Lathrop.  The black gazed at the ground and drew a small circle on the dust with his toe.  In the center of it he made a cross.  \"That my dukkeri (fate),\" he said slowly, \"you go, Sikaso he go too. I see it in the smoke.\"  \"Saw it in the smoke?\" repeated the amazed boys.  \"In smoke of Ju-ju fire I see it written.  I see five go, three come back, in smoke too.  I have spoken.\"  He stalked off as I suddenly as he had the night before and left the boys to gaze in a bewildered way after his huge figure as it swung down the road.  \"That fellow's the best disappearer I ever saw,\" said Billy Barnes at length.  \"I wish he'd stop that stuff about 'five go three come back,\"' said Lathrop, \"it gets on your nerves.\"  \"What could he have meant by seeing it in the smoke?\" asked Harry bewilderedly.  \"Just this,\" broke in a quiet voice behind them.  It was Professor Wiseman, who had glided up to them as silently as a cat.  \"It is a common trick among the witch doctors--of whom our friend yonder seems to be one--to divine events by means of the smoke from a fire built to the accompaniment of special incantations.\"  \"Well, that's cheerful,\" commented Billy, \"but tell us, Professor, how often do they hit it right?\"  \"Nine times out of ten, young man,\" said Professor Wiseman impressively fixing Billy with his gaze just as he would have impaled a bug or grasshopper, \"and the tenth time they come so near the truth as to be uncomfortable.\"  \"I have heard of such things, but I always put them down as impossibilities,\" gasped Frank.  \"Just travelers' tales,\" said Billy.  \"There are many things for the young to learn in Africa,\" remarked Professor Wiseman coldly and gazing at Billy with squashing intentness; \"the young do not believe many things merely because they are young--and foolish.\"  \"Gee! that was a nailer for fair,\" said Billy afterward.  \"I felt as if the Doc was running a big blue pin through me and sticking me on a bit of cork.\"  That morning, as the start for the interior was not to be made till the next day, M. Desplaines asked the boys if they would care to try a little fishing at the foot of the famous Jumbari Falls which lay on a branch of the Bari river a short distance from the town.  Of course the boys assented eagerly, but as it was found that only Frank and Harry were expert canoeists, it was agreed that the others should fish from the bank while the two young leaders trolled their lines from a native built craft.  This canoe was kept at the falls--to which they tramped the two miles overland by a narrow trail.  The falls were a magnificent sight.  From a dark red rock, fully two hundred feet in height, a great volume of water poured its roaring current into a boiling pool below.  The cliffs shot up sheer on all sides and were covered at the bottom with luxuriant green growth like seaweed, while higher up, ferns, as big as rose-bushes at home, and trees of a hundred varieties clung wherever they could find a root-hold.  As the party arrived at the top of the ravine and gazed down, the uproar of the water was so terrific as to render any speech inaudible.  M. Desplaines, who led the party, pointed to a hole in the rocks and a second later vanished into it.  At first, consternation seized on the boys who thought that an accident had happened, but seeing not hearing Professor Wiseman's reassuring laugh and noticing him plunge after M."]]]
