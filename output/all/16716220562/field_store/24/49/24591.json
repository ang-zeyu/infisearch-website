But all this fairy world has passed away, to live only as shadows in the realms of fancy and of song. SCHILLER gives expression to the poet's lament in the following lines:    Art thou, fair world, no more?     Return, thou virgin-bloom on Nature's face!   Ah, only on the minstrel's magic shore     Can we the footsteps of sweet Fable trace!   The meadows mourn for the old hallowing life;     Vainly we search the earth, of gods bereft;   Where once the warm and living shapes were rife     Shadows alone are left.  The Latin poet OV'ID, who lived at the time of the Christian era, has collected from the fictions of the early Greeks and Oriental nations, and woven into one continuous history, the pagan accounts of the Creation, embracing a description of the primeval world, and the early changes it underwent, followed by a history of the four eras or ages of primitive mankind, the deluge of Deuca'lion, and then onward down to the time of Augustus CÃ¦sar. This great work of the pagan poet, called The Metamorphoses, is not only the most curious and valuable record extant of ancient mythology, but some have thought they discovered, in every story it contains, a moral allegory; while others have attempted to trace in it the whole history of the Old Testament, and types of the miracles and sufferings of our Savior. But, however little of truth there may be in the last of these suppositions, the beautiful and impressive account of the Creation given by this poet, of the Four Ages of man's history which followed, and of the Deluge, coincides in so many remarkable respects with the Bible narrative, and with geological and other records, that we give it here as a specimen of Grecian fable that contains some traces of true history. The translation is by Dryden:    Account of the Creation.    Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball,   And heaven's high canopy, that covers all,   One was the face of Nature--if a face--   Rather, a rude and indigested mass;   A lifeless lump, unfashioned and unframed,   Of jarring elements, and CHAOS named.    No sun was lighted up the world to view,   Nor moon did yet her blunted horns renew,   Nor yet was earth suspended in the sky,   Nor, poised, did on her own foundations lie,   Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown;   But earth, and air, and water were in one.   Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable,   And water's dark abyss unnavigable.   No certain form on any was impressed;   All were confused, and each disturbed the rest.    Thus disembroiled they take their proper place;   The next of kin contiguously embrace,   And foes are sundered by a larger space.   The force of fire ascended first on high,   And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky;   Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire,   Whose atoms from inactive earth retire;   Earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng   Of ponderous, thick, unwieldy seeds along.   About her coasts unruly waters roar,   And, rising on a ridge, insult the shore.   Thus when the god--whatever god was he--   Had formed the whole, and made the parts agree,   That no unequal portions might be found,   He moulded earth into a spacious round;   Then, with a breath, he gave the winds to blow,   And bade the congregated waters flow.   He adds the running springs and standing lakes,   And bounding banks for winding rivers makes.   Some parts in earth are swallowed up; the most,   In ample oceans disembogued, are lost.   He shades the woods, the valleys he restrains   With rocky mountains, and extends the plains.    Then, every void of nature to supply,   With forms of gods Jove fills the vacant sky;   New herds of beasts sends the plains to share;   New colonies of birds to people air;   And to their cozy beds the finny fish repair.   A creature of a more exalted kind   Was wanting yet, and then was Man designed;   Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast,   For empire formed and fit to rule the rest;   Whether with particles of heavenly fire   The God of nature did his soul inspire,   Or earth, but new divided from the sky,   And pliant, still retained the ethereal energy.   Thus while the mute creation downward bend   Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,   Man looks aloft, and with erected eyes   Beholds his own hereditary skies.   FOUR AGES OF MAN.  The poet now describes the Ages, or various epochs in the civilization of the human race. The first is the Golden Age, a period of patriarchal simplicity, when Earth yielded her fruits spontaneously, and spring was eternal.    The GOLDEN AGE was first, when man, yet new,   No rule but uncorrupted reason knew,   And, with a native bent, did good pursue.   Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear.   His words were simple and his soul sincere;   Needless were written laws where none oppressed;   The law of man was written on his breast.   No suppliant crowds before the judge appeared,   No court erected yet, nor cause was heard,   But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.    No walls were yet, nor fence, nor moat, nor mound;   Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound;   Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime,   The soft creation slept away their time.   The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,   And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow;   The flowers, unsown, in fields and meadows reigned,   And western winds immortal spring maintained.  The next; or the Silver Age, was marked by the change of seasons, and the division and cultivation of lands.    Succeeding times a SILVER AGE behold,   Excelling brass, but more excelled by gold.   Then summer, autumn, winter did appear,   And spring was but a season of the year;   The sun his annual course obliquely made,   Good days contracted, and enlarged the bad.   Then air with sultry heats began to glow,   The wings of wind were clogged with ice and snow;   And shivering mortals, into houses driven,   Sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven.   Those houses then were caves or homely sheds,   With twining osiers fenced, and moss their beds.   Then ploughs for seed the fruitful furrows broke,   And oxen labored first beneath the yoke.  Then followed the Brazen Age, which was an epoch of war and violence.    To this came next in course the BRAZEN AGE;   A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,   Not impious yet.  According to He'siod, the next age is the Heroic, in which the world began to aspire toward better things; but OVID omits this altogether, and gives, as the fourth and last, the Iron Age, also called the Plutonian Age, full of all sorts of hardships and wickedness. His description of it is as follows:               Hard steel succeeded then,   And stubborn as the metal were the men.   Truth, Modesty, and Shame the world forsook;   Fraud, Avarice, and Force their places took.   Then sails were spread to every wind that blew;   Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new:   Trees rudely hollowed did the waves sustain,   Ere ships in triumph plough'd the watery plain.       Then landmarks limited to each his right;   For all before was common as the light.   Nor was the ground alone required to bear   Her annual income to the crooked share;   But greedy mortals, rummaging her store,   Digged from her entrails first the precious ore;   (Which next to hell the prudent gods had laid),   And that alluring ill to sight displayed:   Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold,   Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold;   And double death did wretched man invade,   By steel assaulted, and by gold betrayed.   Now (brandished weapons glittering in their hands)   Mankind is broken loose from moral bands:   No rights of hospitality remain;   The guest by him who harbored him is slain;   The son-in-law pursues the father's life;   The wife her husband murders, he the wife;   The step-dame poison for the son prepares,   The son inquires into his father's years.   Faith flies, and Piety in exile mourns;   And Justice, here oppressed, to heaven returns.  The Scriptures assert that the wickedness of mankind was the cause of the Noachian flood, or deluge. So, also, we find that, in Grecian mythology, like causes led to the deluge of Deuca'lion. Therefore, before giving Ovid's account of this latter event, we give, from Hesiod, a curious account of   THE ORIGIN OF EVIL, AND ITS INTRODUCTION INTO THE WORLD.  It appears from the legend that, during a controversy between the gods and men, Pro-me'theus, [Footnote: In most Greek proper names ending in 'eus', the 'eus' is pronounced in one syllable; as Or'pheus, pronounced Or'phuse.] who is said to have surpassed all his fellow-men in intellectual vigor and sagacity, stole fire from the skies, and, concealing it in a hollow staff, brought it to man. Jupiter, angry at the theft of that which had been reserved from mortals for wise purposes, resolved to punish Prometheus, and through him all mankind, to show that it was not given to man to elude the wisdom of the gods. He therefore caused Vulcan to form an image of air and water, to give it human voice and strength, and make it assume the form of a beautiful woman, like the immortal goddesses themselves. Minerva endowed this new creation with artistic skill, Venus gave her the witchery of beauty, Mercury inspired her with an artful disposition, and the Graces added all their charms. But we append the following extracts from the beautifully written account by Hesiod, beginning with the command which Jupiter gave to Vulcan, the fire-god:    Thus spoke the sire, whom heaven and earth obey,   And bade the fire-god mould his plastic clay;   In-br"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6846"],["title","My Lady of the North (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team         MY LADY OF THE NORTH  The Love Story of a Gray Jacket   By Randall Parrish     Contents  CHAPTER          I.

MY LADY OF THE NORTH     MY LADY OF THE NORTH  The Love Story of a Gray-Jacket    CHAPTER I  A DESPATCH FOR LONGSTREET   It was a bare, plain interior,--the low table at which he sat an unplaned board, his seat a box, made softer by a folded blanket. His only companions were two aides, standing silent beside the closed entrance, anxious to anticipate his slightest need.  He will abide in my memory forever as I saw him then,--although we were destined to meet often afterwards,--that old gray hero, whose masterly strategy held at bay for so long those mighty forces hurled on our constantly thinning lines of defence. To me the history of war has never contained his equal, and while I live I shall love and revere him as I can love and revere no other man.  âGeneral Lee,â said one of the aides, as I passed the single sentry and drew aside the flap to step within, âthis is Captain Wayne.â  He deliberately pushed aside the mass of papers which had been engaging him, and for an embarrassing moment fixed upon me a glance that seemed to read me through and through. Then, with simple dignity, far more impressive than I can picture it in words, he arose slowly and extended his hand.  âCaptain Wayne,â he said gravely, yet retaining his grasp, and with his eyes full upon mine, âyou are a much younger man than I expected to see, yet I have selected you upon the special recommendation of your brigade commander for services of the utmost importance. I certainly do not hold your youth to be against your success, but I feel unwilling to order you to the performance of this duty, which, besides being beyond the regular requirements of the service, involves unusual risks.â  âWithout inquiring its nature,â I said hastily, âI freely offer myself a volunteer for any service which may be required either by the army or yourself.â  The kindly face brightened instantly, almost into a smile, and a new look of confidence swept into the keen gray eyes.  âI felt, even as I spoke,â he said, with a dignified courtesy I have never marked in any one else, âthat I must be doing wrong to question the willingness of an officer of your regiment, Captain Wayne, to make personal sacrifice. From our first day of battle until now the South has never once called upon them in vain. You are from the ranks, I believe?â  âI was a corporal at Manassas.â  âAh! then you have won your grade by hard service. You take with you one man?â  âSergeant Craig of my troop, sir, a good soldier, who knows the country well.â  He lowered his eyes to the numerous papers littering the table, and then, leaning over, traced lightly with a colored pencil a line across an outspread map.  âYou speak of his knowing the country well; are you aware, then, of your destination?â  âI merely inferred from what Colonel Carter said that it was your desire to re-establish communication with General Longstreet.â  âThat is true; but do you know where Longstreet is?â  âOnly that we of the line suppose him to be somewhere west of the mountains, sir. It is camp gossip that his present base of supplies is at Minersville.â  âYour conjecture is partly correct, although I have more reason to believe that the head of his column has reached Bear Fork, or will by to-morrow morning. Kindly step this way, Captain Wayne, and make note of the blue lines I have traced across this map. Here, you will observe, is Minersville, directly beyond the high ridge. You will notice that the Federal lines extend north and south directly between us, with their heavier bodies of infantry along the Wharton pike, and so disposed as to shut off all communication between us and our left wing. Now, the message I must get into Longstreet's hands is imperative; indeed, I will say to you, the very safety of this army depends upon its reaching him before his advance passes Bear Fork. There remains, therefore, no time for any long detour; the messenger who bears it must take his life in his hands and ride straight westward through the very lines of the enemy.â  He spoke these words rapidly, earnestly; then suddenly he lifted his eyes to mine, and said firmly: âI am perfectly frank with you. Are you the man?â  I felt the hot blood leap into my face, but I met his stern gaze without flinching.  âIf I live, General Lee, I shall meet his advance at Bear Fork by daybreak.â  âGod guide you; I believe you will.â  His words seemed uttered unconsciously. He turned slightly, and glanced toward the door. âMajor Holmes, will you kindly hand me the draft of that despatch?â  He took the paper from the outstretched hand of the aide, read it over slowly and with great care, wrote a word of explanation upon the margin, and then extended it to me.  âCommit that, word by word, to your memory; we must run no possible risk of its ever falling into the enemy's hands.â  I can see it now, that coarse yellow paper,--the clear, upright penmanship, the words here and there misused and corrected, the sentence scratched out, the heavy underlining of a command, and his own strangely delicate signature at the bottom.   _âHeadquarters, Army Northern Virginia,  âIn the field, near Custer House,  âSept. 22, 2 P.M.  âLieut.-Gen'l Longstreet,  âCommanding Left Wing.  âSir: You will advance your entire force by the Connelton and Sheffield pikes, so as to reach Castle Rock with your full infantry command by daybreak, September 26th. Let this supersede all other orders. I propose to attack in force in the neighborhood of Sailor's Ford, and shall expect you to advance promptly at the first sound of our artillery. It is absolutely essential that we form prompt connection of forces, and to accomplish this result will require a quick, persistent attack upon your part. You are hereby ordered to throw your troops forward without reserve, permitting them to be halted by no obstacle, until they come into actual touch with my columns. The success or failure of my plans will depend utterly upon your strict observance of these orders._  âR. E. LEE, _âGen'l Commandingâ_   I handed back the paper, and lifted my hand in salute.  âYou have memorized it?â  âWord for word, sir.â  âRepeat it to me.â  He held the paper before him as I did so, and at the close lifted his eyes again to my face.  âVery good,â he said quietly. âNow let there be no mistake; repeat it over to your companion as you proceed until he also has memorized it, and one of you must live long enough to reach Longstreet. I advise you to take the Langley road,--it is the most protected,--and not try to pass beyond the old Coulter plantation until after dark, or you will run the risk of being observed by the enemy's pickets. Beyond this I must leave all to your own discretion.â  He paused, and I still lingered, thinking he might have something more to add.  âAre you one of the Waynes of Charlottesville?â he asked gravely.  âColonel Richard Wayne was my father, sir.â  âAh, indeed! I remember him wellâ; and his face lit up with a most tender smile. âWe were together in Mexico. A Virginia gentleman of the old school. He is dead, I believe?â  âHe was killed, sir, the first year of the war.â  âI remember; it was at Antietam. And your mother? If my memory is not at fault she was a Pierpont?â  âShe is now in Richmond, sir, and the old plantation is but a ruin.â  âWar is indeed sad,â he said slowly; âand I often feel that our Southern women are compelled to bear the brunt of it. What heroines they have proven! History records no equal to the daily sacrifices I have witnessed in the past three years. God grant it may be soon ended.â  Then, as if suddenly moved by the impulse of the moment, he again extended his hand.  âWell, lad,â he said kindly, the same grave smile lighting his face, âour country needs us. We must not waste time here in conversation. I am very glad to have been permitted to meet the son of my old friend, and trust you will remember me to your mother. But now good-bye, Captain, and may He in whose hand we all are guide and guard you. I know that a Wayne of Virginia will always do his duty.â  Bareheaded and with proudly swelling heart I backed out of the tent as I might have left the throne-room of an emperor, but as I grasped the reins and swung up into saddle, I became conscious that he had followed me. Craig flung up his hand in quick, soldierly salute, and then, with a single rapid stride, the General stood at his horse's head.  âSergeant,â he said,--and I was struck by the incisive military tone of his voice, so different from the"]]]
