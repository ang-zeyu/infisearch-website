No fewer than six house-caps had fallen into the enemy's hands, and he himself had been tripped up and rolled in a puddle.  He burned to avenge this disaster.  \"Coming down to Cook's?\" he said to his ally, Painter. It was just a week since the Sheen episode.  \"All right,\" said Painter.  \"Suppose we go by the High Street,\" suggested Jackson, casually.  \"Then we'd better get a few more chaps,\" said Painter.  A few more chaps were collected, and the party, numbering eight, set off for the town. There were present such stalwarts as Borwick and Crowle, both of Dexter's, and Tomlin, of the School House, a useful man to have by you in an emergency. It was Tomlin who, on one occasion, attacked by two terrific champions of St Jude's in a narrow passage, had vanquished them both, and sent their mortar-boards miles into the empyrean, so that they were never the same mortar-boards again, but wore ever after a bruised and draggled look.  The expedition passed down the High Street without adventure, until, by common consent, it stopped at the lofty wall which bounded the playground of St Jude's.  From the other side of the wall came sounds of revelry, shrill squealings and shoutings. The Judies were disporting themselves at one of their weird games. It was known that they played touch-last, and Scandal said that another of their favourite recreations was marbles. The juniors at Wrykyn believed that it was to hide these excesses from the gaze of the public that the playground wall had been made so high. Eye-witnesses, who had peeped through the door in the said wall, reported that what the Judies seemed to do mostly was to chase one another about the playground, shrieking at the top of their voices. But, they added, this was probably a mere ruse to divert suspicion.  They had almost certainly got the marbles in their pockets all the time.  The expedition stopped, and looked itself in the face.  \"How about buzzing something at them?\" said Jackson earnestly.  \"You can get oranges over the road,\" said Tomlin in his helpful way.  Jackson vanished into the shop indicated, and reappeared a few moments later with a brown paper bag.  \"It seems a beastly waste,\" suggested the economical Painter.  \"That's all right,\" said Jackson, \"they're all bad. The man thought I was rotting him when I asked if he'd got any bad oranges, but I got them at last. Give us a leg up, some one.\"  Willing hands urged him to the top of the wall. He drew out a green orange, and threw it.  There was a sudden silence on the other side of the wall. Then a howl of wrath went up to the heavens. Jackson rapidly emptied his bag.  \"Got him!\" he exclaimed, as the last orange sped on its way. \"Look out, they're coming!\"  The expedition had begun to move off with quiet dignity, when from the doorway in the wall there poured forth a stream of mortar-boarded warriors, shrieking defiance. The expedition advanced to meet them.  As usual, the Judies had the advantage in numbers, and, filled to the brim with righteous indignation, they were proceeding to make things uncommonly warm for the invaders--Painter had lost his cap, and Tomlin three waistcoat buttons--when the eye of Jackson, roving up and down the street, was caught by a Seymour's cap. He was about to shout for assistance when he perceived that the newcomer was Sheen, and refrained. It was no use, he felt, asking Sheen for help.  But just as Sheen arrived and the ranks of the expedition were beginning to give way before the strenuous onslaught of the Judies, the latter, almost with one accord, turned and bolted into their playground again. Looking round, Tomlin, that first of generals, saw the reason, and uttered a warning.  A mutual foe had appeared. From a passage on the left of the road there had debouched on to the field of action Albert himself and two of his band.  The expedition flew without false shame. It is to be doubted whether one of Albert's calibre would have troubled to attack such small game, but it was the firm opinion of the Wrykyn fags and the Judies that he and his men were to be avoided.  The newcomers did not pursue them. They contented themselves with shouting at them. One of the band threw a stone.  Then they caught sight of Sheen.  Albert said, \"Oo er!\" and advanced at the double. His companions followed him.  Sheen watched them come, and backed against the wall. His heart was thumping furiously. He was in for it now, he felt. He had come down to the town with this very situation in his mind. A wild idea of doing something to restore his self-respect and his credit in the eyes of the house had driven him to the High Street. But now that the crisis had actually arrived, he would have given much to have been in his study again.  Albert was quite close now. Sheen could see the marks which had resulted from his interview with Drummond. With all his force Sheen hit out, and experienced a curious thrill as his fist went home. It was a poor blow from a scientific point of view, but Sheen's fives had given him muscle, and it checked Albert. That youth, however, recovered rapidly, and the next few moments passed in a whirl for Sheen. He received a stinging blow on his left ear, and another which deprived him of his whole stock of breath, and then he was on the ground, conscious only of a wish to stay there for ever.     VII  MR JOE BEVAN   Almost involuntarily he staggered up to receive another blow which sent him down again.  \"That'll do,\" said a voice.  Sheen got up, panting. Between him and his assailant stood a short, sturdy man in a tweed suit. He was waving Albert back, and Albert appeared to be dissatisfied. He was arguing hotly with the newcomer.  \"Now, you go away,\" said that worthy, mildly, \"just you go away.\"  Albert gave it as his opinion that the speaker would do well not to come interfering in what didn't concern him. What he wanted, asserted Albert, was a thick ear.  \"Coming pushing yourself in,\" added Albert querulously.  \"You go away,\" repeated the stranger. \"You go away. I don't want to have trouble with you.\"  Albert's reply was to hit out with his left hand in the direction of the speaker's face. The stranger, without fuss, touched the back of Albert's wrist gently with the palm of his right hand, and Albert, turning round in a circle, ended the manoeuvre with his back towards his opponent. He faced round again irresolutely. The thing had surprised him.  \"You go away,\" said the other, as if he were making the observation for the first time.  \"It's Joe Bevan,\" said one of Albert's friends, excitedly.  Albert's jaw fell. His freckled face paled.  \"You go away,\" repeated the man in the tweed suit, whose conversation seemed inclined to run in a groove.  This time Albert took the advice. His friends had already taken it.  \"Thanks,\" said Sheen.  \"Beware,\" said Mr Bevan oracularly, \"of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Always counter back when you guard. When a man shows you his right like that, always push out your hand straight. The straight left rules the boxing world. Feeling better, sir?\"  \"Yes, thanks.\"  \"He got that right in just on the spot. I was watching. When you see a man coming to hit you with his right like that, don't you draw back. Get on top of him. He can't hit you then.\"  That feeling of utter collapse, which is the immediate result of a blow in the parts about the waistcoat, was beginning to pass away, and Sheen now felt capable of taking an interest in sublunary matters once more. His ear smarted horribly, and when he put up a hand and felt it the pain was so great that he could barely refrain from uttering a cry. But, however physically battered he might be, he was feeling happier and more satisfied with himself than he had felt for years. He had been beaten, but he had fought his best, and not given in. Some portion of his self-respect came back to him as he reviewed the late encounter.  Mr Bevan regarded him approvingly.  \"He was too heavy for you,\" he said. \"He's a good twelve stone, I make it. I should put you at ten stone--say ten stone three. Call it nine stone twelve in condition. But you've got pluck, sir.\"  Sheen opened his eyes at this surprising statement.  \"Some I've met would have laid down after getting that first hit, but you got up again. That's the secret of fighting. Always keep going on. Never give in. You know what Shakespeare says about the one who first cries, 'Hold, enough!' Do you read Shakespeare, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" said Sheen.  \"Ah, now _he_ knew his business,\" said Mr Bevan enthusiastically. \"_There_ was ring-craft, as you may say. _He_ wasn't a novice.\"  Sheen agreed that Shakespeare had written some good things in his time.  \"That's what you want to remember. Always keep going on, as the saying is. I was fighting Dick Roberts at the National--an American, he was, from San Francisco. He come at me with his right stretched out, and I think he's going to hit me with it, when blessed if his left don't come out instead, and, my Golly! it nearly knocked a passage through me. Just where that fellow hit you, sir, he hit me. It was just at the end of the round, and I went back to my corner. Jim Blake was seconding me. 'What's this, Jim?' I says, 'is the man mad, or what?' 'Why,' he says, 'he's left-handed, that's what's the matter. Get on top of him.' 'Get on top of him? I says. 'My Golly, I'll get on top of the roof if he's going to hit me another of those.' But I kept on, and got close to him, and he couldn't get in another of them, and he give in after the seventh round.\"  \"What competition was that?\" asked Sheen.  Mr Bevan laughed. \"It was a twenty-round contest, sir, for seven-fifty aside and the Light Weight Championship of the World.\"  Sheen looked at him in astonishment. He had always imagined professional pugilists to be bullet-headed and beetle-browed to a man. He was not prepared for one of Mr Joe Bevan's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6927"],["title","The White Feather (#7)"],["body"," description. For all the marks of his profession that he bore on his face, in the shape of lumps and scars, he might have been a curate. His face looked tough, and his eyes harboured always a curiously alert, questioning expression, as if he were perpetually \"sizing up\" the person he was addressing. But otherwise he was like other men. He seemed also to have a pretty taste in Literature. This, combined with his strong and capable air, attracted Sheen. Usually he was shy and ill at ease with strangers. Joe Bevan he felt he had known all his life.  \"Do you still fight?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Mr Bevan, \"I gave it up. A man finds he's getting on, as the saying is, and it don't do to keep at it too long. I teach and I train, but I don't fight now.\"  A sudden idea flashed across Sheen's mind. He was still glowing with that pride which those who are accustomed to work with their brains feel when they have gone honestly through some labour of the hands. At that moment he felt himself capable of fighting the world and beating it. The small point, that Albert had knocked him out of time in less than a minute, did not damp him at all. He had started on the right road. He had done something. He had stood up to his man till he could stand no longer. An unlimited vista of action stretched before him. He had tasted the pleasure of the fight, and he wanted more.  Why, he thought, should he not avail himself of Joe Bevan's services to help him put himself right in the eyes of the house? At the end of the term, shortly before the Public Schools' Competitions at Aldershot, inter-house boxing cups were competed for at Wrykyn. It would be a dramatic act of reparation to the house if he could win the Light-Weight cup for it. His imagination, jumping wide gaps, did not admit the possibility of his not being good enough to win it. In the scene which he conjured up in his mind he was an easy victor. After all, there was the greater part of the term to learn in, and he would have a Champion of the World to teach him.  Mr Bevan cut in on his reflections as if he had heard them by some process of wireless telegraphy.  \"Now, look here, sir,\" he said, \"you should let me give you a few lessons. You're plucky, but you don't know the game as yet. And boxing's a thing every one ought to know. Supposition is, you're crossing a field or going down a street with your sweetheart or your wife--\"  Sheen was neither engaged nor married, but he let the point pass.  --\"And up comes one of these hooligans, as they call 'em. What are you going to do if he starts his games? Why, nothing, if you can't box. You may be plucky, but you can't beat him. And if you beat him, you'll get half murdered yourself. What you want to do is to learn to box, and then what happens? Why, as soon as he sees you shaping, he says to himself, 'Hullo, this chap knows too much for me. I'm off,' and off he runs. Or supposition is, he comes for you. You don't mind. Not you. You give him one punch in the right place, and then you go off to your tea, leaving him lying there. He won't get up.\"  \"I'd like to learn,\" said Sheen. \"I should be awfully obliged if you'd teach me. I wonder if you could make me any good by the end of the term. The House Competitions come off then.\"  \"That all depends, sir. It comes easier to some than others. If you know how to shoot your left out straight, that's as good as six months' teaching. After that it's all ring-craft. The straight left beats the world.\"  \"Where shall I find you?\"  \"I'm training a young chap--eight stone seven, and he's got to get down to eight stone four, for a bantam weight match--at an inn up the river here. I daresay you know it, sir. Or any one would tell you where it is. The 'Blue Boar,' it's called. You come there any time you like to name, sir, and you'll find me.\"  \"I should like to come every day,\" said Sheen. \"Would that be too often?\"  \"Oftener the better, sir. You can't practise too much.\"  \"Then I'll start next week. Thanks very much. By the way, I shall have to go by boat, I suppose. It isn't far, is it? I've not been up the river for some time. The School generally goes down stream.\"  \"It's not what you'd call far,\" said Bevan. \"But it would be easier for you to come by road.\"  \"I haven't a bicycle.\"  \"Wouldn't one of your friends lend you one?\"  Sheen flushed.  \"No, I'd better come by boat, I think. I'll turn up on Tuesday at about five. Will that suit you?\"  \"Yes, sir. That will be a good time. Then I'll say good bye, sir, for the present.\"  Sheen went back to his house in a different mood from the one in which he had left it. He did not care now when the other Seymourites looked through him.  In the passage he met Linton, and grinned pleasantly at him.  \"What the dickens was that man grinning at?\" said Linton to himself. \"I must have a smut or something on my face.\"  But a close inspection in the dormitory looking-glass revealed no blemish on his handsome features.     VIII  A NAVAL BATTLE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES   What a go is life!  Let us examine the case of Jackson, of Dexter's. O'Hara, who had left Dexter's at the end of the summer term, had once complained to Clowes of the manner in which his house-master treated him, and Clowes had remarked in his melancholy way that it was nothing less than a breach of the law that Dexter should persist in leading a fellow a dog's life without a dog licence for him.  That was precisely how Jackson felt on the subject.  Things became definitely unbearable on the day after Sheen's interview with Mr Joe Bevan.  'Twas morn--to begin at the beginning--and Jackson sprang from his little cot to embark on the labours of the day. Unfortunately, he sprang ten minutes too late, and came down to breakfast about the time of the second slice of bread and marmalade. Result, a hundred lines. Proceeding to school, he had again fallen foul of his house-master--in whose form he was--over a matter of unprepared Livy. As a matter of fact, Jackson _had_ prepared the Livy. Or, rather, he had not absolutely _prepared_ it; but he had meant to. But it was Mr Templar's preparation, and Mr Templar was short-sighted. Any one will understand, therefore, that it would have been simply chucking away the gifts of Providence if he had not gone on with the novel which he had been reading up till the last moment before prep-time, and had brought along with him accidentally, as it were. It was a book called _A Spoiler of Men_, by Richard Marsh, and there was a repulsive crime on nearly every page. It was Hot Stuff. Much better than Livy....  Lunch Score--Two hundred lines.  During lunch he had the misfortune to upset a glass of water. Pure accident, of course, but there it was, don't you know, all over the table.  Mr Dexter had called him--      (a) clumsy;     (b) a pig;  and had given him      (1) Advice--\"You had better be careful, Jackson\".     (2) A present--\"Two hundred lines, Jackson\".  On the match being resumed at two o'clock, with four hundred lines on the score-sheet, he had played a fine, free game during afternoon school, and Mr Dexter, who objected to fine, free games--or, indeed, any games--during school hours, had increased the total to six hundred, when stumps were drawn for the day.  So on a bright sunny Saturday afternoon, when he should have been out in the field cheering the house-team on to victory against the School House, Jackson sat in the junior day-room at Dexter's copying out portions of Virgil, Aeneid Two.  To him, later on in the afternoon, when he had finished half his task, entered Painter, with the news that Dexter's had taken thirty points off the School House just after half-time.  \"Mopped them up,\" said the terse and epigrammatic Painter. \"Made rings round them. Haven't you finished yet? Well, chuck it, and come out.\"  \"What's on?\" asked Jackson.  \"We're going to have a boat race.\"  \"Pile it on.\"  \"We are, really. Fact. Some of these School House kids are awfully sick about the match, and challenged us. That chap Tomlin thinks he can row.  \"He can't row for nuts,\" said Jackson. \"He doesn't know which end of the oar to shove into the water. I've seen cats that could row better than Tomlin.\"  \"That's what I told him. At least, I said he couldn't row for toffee, so he said all right, I bet I can lick you, and I said I betted he couldn't, and he said all right, then, let's try, and then the other chaps wanted to join in, so we made an inter-house thing of it. And I want you to come and stroke us.\"  Jackson hesitated. Mr Dexter, setting the lines on Friday, had certainly said that they were to be shown up \"tomorrow evening.\" He had said it very loud and clear. Still, in a case like this.... After all, by helping to beat the School House on the river he would be giving Dexter's a leg-up. And what more could the man want?  \"Right ho,\" said Jackson.  Down at the School boat-house the enemy were already afloat when Painter and Jackson arrived.  \"Buck up,\" cried the School House crew.  Dexter's embarked, five strong. There was room for two on each seat. Jackson shared the post of stroke with Painter. Crowle steered.  \"Ready?\" asked Tomlin from the other boat.  \"Half a sec.,\" said Jackson. \"What's the course?\"  \"Oh, don't you know _that_ yet? Up to the town, round the island just below the bridge,--the island with the croquet ground on it, _you_ know--and back again here. Ready?\"  \"In a jiffy. Look here, Crowle, remember about steering. You pull the right line if you want to go to the right and the other if you want to go to the left.\"  \"All right,\" said the injured Crowle. \"As if I didn't know that.\"  \"Thought I'd mention it. It's your fault. Nobody could tell by looking at you that you knew anything except how to eat. Ready, you chaps?\"  \"When I say 'Three,'\" said Tomlin.  It was a subject of heated discussion between the crews for weeks afterwards whether Dexter's boat did or did not go off at the word \"Two.\" Opinions were divided on the topic. But it was certain that Jackson and"]]]
