I don't suppose there's one left now. I should like to see the Old Man's face when he hears about it. Good mind to go and tell him now, only he'd have a fit. Jolly exciting, though, isn't it?'  'Well,' said Tony, 'of all the absolutely idiotic things to do! Fancy putting--there must have been at least fifty pounds' worth of silver and things. Fancy going and leaving all that overnight in the Pav!'  'Rotten!' agreed Welch. 'Wonder whose idea it was.'  'Look here, Robinson,' said Tony, 'you'd better buck up and change, or you'll be late for brekker. Come on, Welch, we'll go and inspect the scene of battle.'  Robinson trotted off, and Welch and Tony made their way to the Pavilion. There, sure enough, was the window, or rather the absence of window. A pane had been neatly removed, evidently in the orthodox way by means of a diamond.  'May as well climb up and see if there's anything to be seen,' said Welch.  'All right,' said Tony, 'give us a leg up. Right-ho. By Jove, I'm stiff.'  'See anything?'  'No. There's a cloth sort of thing covering what I suppose are the prizes. I see how the chap, whoever he was, got in. You've only got to break the window, draw a couple of bolts, and there you are. Shall I go in and investigate?'  'Better not. It's rather the thing, I fancy, in these sorts of cases, to leave everything just as it is.'  'Rum business,' said Tony, as he rejoined Welch on terra firma. 'Wonder if they'll catch the chap. We'd better be getting back to the House now. It struck the quarter years ago.'  When Tony, some twenty minutes later, shook off the admiring crowd who wanted a full description of yesterday's proceedings, and reached his study, he found there James Thomson, brother to Allen Thomson, as the playbills say. Jim was looking worried. Tony had noticed it during breakfast, and had wondered at the cause. He was soon enlightened.  'Hullo, Jim,' said he. 'What's up with you this morning? Feeling chippy?'  'No. No, I'm all right. I'm in a beastly hole though. I wanted to talk to you about it.'  'Weigh in, then. We've got plenty of time before school.'  'It's about this Aldershot business. How on earth did you manage to lick Allen like that? I thought he was a cert.'  'Yes, so did I. The 'ole thing there, as Dawkins 'ud say, was, I knocked him out. It's the sort of thing that's always happening. I wasn't in it at all except during the second round, when I gave him beans rather in one of the corners. My aunt, it was warm while it lasted. First round, I didn't hit him once. He was better than I thought he'd be, and I knew from experience he was pretty good.'  'Yes, you look a bit bashed.'  'Yes. Feel it too. But what's the row with you?'  'Just this. I had a couple of quid on Allen, and the rotter goes and gets licked.'  'Good Lord. Whom did you bet with?'  'With Allen himself.'  'Mean to say Allen was crock enough to bet against himself? He must have known he was miles better than anyone else in. He's got three medals there already.'  'No, you see his bet with me was only a hedge. He'd got five to four or something in quids on with a chap in his House at Rugby on himself. He wanted a hedge because he wasn't sure about his ankle being all right. You know he hurt it. So I gave him four to one in half-sovereigns. I thought he was a cert, with apologies to you.'  'Don't mention it. So he was a cert. It was only the merest fluke I managed to out him when I did. If he'd hung on to the end, he'd have won easy. He'd been scoring points all through.'  'I know. So _The Sportsman_ says. Just like my luck.'  'I can't see what you want to bet at all for. You're bound to come a mucker sooner or later. Can't you raise the two quid?'  'I'm broke except for half-a-crown.'  'I'd lend it to you like a shot if I had it, of course. But you don't find me with two quid to my name at the end of term. Won't Allen wait?'  'He would if it was only him. But this other chap wants his oof badly for something and he's leaving and going abroad or something at the end of term. Anyhow, I know he's keen on getting it. Allen told me.'  Tony pondered for a moment. 'Look here,' he said at last, 'can't you ask your pater? He usually heaves his money about pretty readily, doesn't he?'  'Well, you see, he wouldn't send me two quid off the reel without wanting to know all about it, and why I couldn't get on to the holidays with five bob, and I'd either have to fake up a lot of lies, which I'm not going to do--'  'Of course not.'  'Or else I must tell him I've been betting.'  'Well, he bets himself, doesn't he?'  'That's just where the whole business slips up,' replied Jim, prodding the table with a pen in a misanthropic manner. 'Betting's the one thing he's absolutely down on. He got done rather badly once a few years ago. Believe he betted on Orme that year he got poisoned. Anyhow he's always sworn to lynch us if we made fools of ourselves that way. So if I asked him, I'd not only get beans myself, besides not getting any money out of him, but Allen would get scalped too, which he wouldn't see at all.'  'Yes, it's no good doing that. Haven't you any other source of revenue?'  'Yes, there's just one chance. If that doesn't come off, I'm done. My pater said he'd give me a quid for every race I won at the sports. I got the half yesterday all right when you were up at Aldershot.'  'Good man. I didn't hear about that. What time? Anything good?'  'Nothing special. 2-7 and three-fifths.'  'That's awfully good. You ought to pull off the mile, too, I should think.'  'Yes, with luck. Drake's the man I'm afraid of. He's done it in 4-48 twice during training. He was second in the half yesterday by about three yards, but you can't tell anything from that. He sprinted too late.'  'What's your best for the mile?'  'I have done 4-47, but only once. 4-48's my average, so there's nothing to choose between us on paper.'  'Well, you've got more to make you buck up than he has. There must be something in that.'  'Yes, by Jove. I'll win if I expire on the tape. I shan't spare myself with that quid on the horizon.'  'No. Hullo, there's the bell. We must buck up. Going to Charteris' gorge tonight?'  'Yes, but I shan't eat anything. No risks for me.'  'Rusks are more in your line now. Come on.'  And, in the excitement of these more personal matters, Tony entirely forgot to impart the news of the Pavilion burglary to him.     CHAPTER III AN UNIMPORTANT BY-PRODUCT   The news, however, was not long in spreading. Robinson took care of that. On the way to school he overtook his friend Morrison, a young gentleman who had the unique distinction of being the rowdiest fag in Ward's House, which, as any Austinian could have told you, was the rowdiest house in the School.  'I say, Morrison, heard the latest?'  'No, what?'  'Chap broke into the Pav. last night.'  'Who, you?'  'No, you ass, a regular burglar. After the Sports prizes.'  'Look here, Robinson, try that on the kids.'  'Just what I am doing,' said Robinson.  This delicate reference to Morrison's tender years had the effect of creating a disturbance. Two School House juniors, who happened to be passing, naturally forsook all their other aims and objects and joined the battle.  'What's up?' asked one of them, dusting himself hastily as they stopped to take breath. It was always his habit to take up any business that might attract his attention, and ask for explanations afterwards.  'This kid--' began Morrison.  'Kid yourself, Morrison.'  'This lunatic, then.' Robinson allowed the emendation to pass. 'This lunatic's got some yarn on about the Pav. being burgled.'  'So it is. Tell you I saw it myself.'  'Did it yourself, probably.'  'How do you know, anyway? You seem so jolly certain about it.'  'Why, there's a pane of glass cut out of the window in the First room.'  'Shouldn't wonder, you know,' said Dimsdale, one of the two School House fags, judicially, 'if the kid wasn't telling the truth for once in his life. Those pots must be worth something. Don't you think so, Scott?'  Scott admitted that there might be something in the idea, and that, however foreign to his usual habits, Robinson might on this occasion be confining himself more or less to strict fact.  'There you are, then,' said Robinson, vengefully. 'Shows what a fat lot you know what you're talking about, Morrison.'  'Morrison's a fool,' said Scott. 'Ever since he got off the bottom bench in form there's been no holding him.'  'All the same,' said Morrison, feeling that matters were going against him, 'I shan't believe it till I see it.'  'What'll you bet?' said Robinson.  'I never bet,' replied Morrison with scorn.  'You daren't. You know you'd lose.'  'All right, then, I'll bet a penny I'm right.' He drew a deep breath, as who should say, 'It's a lot of money, but it's worth risking it.'  'You'll lose that penny, old chap,' said Robinson. 'That's to say,' he added thoughtfully, 'if you ever pay up.'  'You've got us as witnesses,' said Dimsdale. 'We'll see that he shells out. Scott, remember you're a witness.  'Right-ho,' said Scott.  At this moment the clock struck nine, and as each of the principals in this financial transaction, and both the witnesses, were expected to be in their places to answer their names at 8.58, they were late. And as they had all been late the day before and the day before that, they were presented, on arrival, by their generous Form Master with 200 lines apiece. Which shows more than ever how wrong it is to bet.  The news continuing to circulate, by the end of morning school it was generally known that a gang of desperadoes, numbering at least a hundred, had taken the Pavilion down, brick by brick, till only the foundations were left standing, and had gone off with every jot and tittle of the unfortunately placed Sports prizes.  At the quarter-to-eleven interval, the School had gone _en masse_ to see what it could see, and had stared"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6984"],["title","The Pothunters (#3)"],["body","the window with much the same interest as they were wont to use in inspecting the First Eleven pitch on the morning of a match--a curious custom, by the way, but one very generally observed.  Then the official news of the extent of the robbery was spread abroad. It appeared that the burglar had by no means done the profession credit, for out of a collection of prizes ranging from the vast and silver Mile Challenge Cup to the pair of fives-gloves with which the 'under twelve' disciple of Deerfoot was to be rewarded, he had selected only three. Two of these were worth having, being the challenge cup for the quarter and the non-challenge cup for the hundred yards, both silver, but the third was a valueless flask, and the general voice of the School was loud in condemning the business abilities of one who could select his swag in so haphazard a manner. It was felt to detract from the merit of the performance. The knowing ones, however, gave it as their opinion that the man must have been frightened by something, and so was unable to give the matter his best attention and do himself justice as a connoisseur.  'We had a burglary at my place once,' began Reade, of Philpott's House. 'The man--'  'That rotter, Reade,' said Barrett, also of Philpott's, 'has been telling us that burglary chestnut of his all the morning. I wish you chaps wouldn't encourage him.'  'Why, what was it? First I've heard of it, at any rate.' Dallas and Vaughan, of Ward's, added themselves to the group. 'Out with it, Reade,' said Vaughan.  'It's only a beastly reminiscence of Reade's childhood,' said Barrett. 'A burglar got into the wine-cellar and collared all the coals.'  'He didn't. He was in the hall, and my pater got his revolver--'  'While you hid under the bed.'  '--and potted at him over the banisters.'  'The last time but three you told the story, your pater fired through the keyhole of the dining-room.'  'You idiot, that was afterwards.'  'Oh, well, what does it matter? Tell us something fresh.'  'It's my opinion,' said Dallas, 'that Ward did it. A man of the vilest antecedents. He's capable of anything from burglary--'  'To attempted poisoning. You should see what we get to eat in Ward's House,' said Vaughan.  'Ward's the worst type of beak. He simply lives for the sake of booking chaps. If he books a chap out of bounds it keeps him happy for a week.'  'A man like that's bound to be a criminal of sorts in his spare time. It's action and reaction,' said Vaughan.  Mr Ward happening to pass at this moment, the speaker went on to ask Dallas audibly if life was worth living, and Dallas replied that under certain conditions and in some Houses it was not.  Dallas and Vaughan did not like Mr Ward. Mr Ward was not the sort of man who inspires affection. He had an unpleasant habit of 'jarring', as it was called. That is to say, his conversation was shaped to one single end, that of trying to make the person to whom he talked feel uncomfortable. Many of his jars had become part of the School history. There was a legend that on one occasion he had invited his prefects to supper, and regaled them with sausages. There was still one prefect unhelped. To him he addressed himself.  'A sausage, Jones?'  'If you please, sir.'  'No, you won't, then, because I'm going to have half myself.'  This story may or may not be true. Suffice it to say, that Mr Ward was not popular.  The discussion was interrupted by the sound of the bell ringing for second lesson. The problem was left unsolved. It was evident that the burglar had been interrupted, but how or why nobody knew. The suggestion that he had heard Master R. Robinson training for his quarter-mile, and had thought it was an earthquake, found much favour with the junior portion of the assembly. Simpson, on whom Robinson had been given start in the race, expressed an opinion that he, Robinson, ran like a cow. At which Robinson smiled darkly, and advised the other to wait till Sports Day and then he'd see, remarking that, meanwhile, if he gave him any of his cheek he might not be well enough to run at all.  'This sort of thing,' said Barrett to Reade, as they walked to their form-room, 'always makes me feel beastly. Once start a row like this, and all the beaks turn into regular detectives and go ferreting about all over the place, and it's ten to one they knock up against something one doesn't want them to know about.'  Reade was feeling hurt. He had objected to the way in which Barrett had spoiled a story that might easily have been true, and really was true in parts. His dignity was offended. He said 'Yes' to Barrett's observation in a tone of reserved _hauteur_. Barrett did not notice.  'It's an awful nuisance. For one thing it makes them so jolly strict about bounds.'  'Yes.'  'I wanted to go for a bike ride this afternoon. There's nothing on at the School.'  'Why don't you?'  'What's the good if you can't break bounds? A ride of about a quarter of a mile's no good. There's a ripping place about ten miles down the Stapleton Road. Big wood, with a ripping little hollow in the middle, all ferns and moss. I was thinking of taking a book out there for the afternoon. Only there's roll-call.'  He paused. Ordinarily, this would have been the cue for Reade to say, 'Oh, I'll answer your name at roll-call.' But Reade said nothing. Barrett looked surprised and disappointed.  'I say, Reade,' he said.  'Well?'  'Would you like to answer my name at roll-call?' It was the first time he had ever had occasion to make the request.  'No,' said Reade.  Barrett could hardly believe his ears. Did he sleep? Did he dream? Or were visions about?  'What!' he said.  No answer.  'Do you mean to say you won't?'  'Of course I won't. Why the deuce should I do your beastly dirty work for you?'  Barrett did not know what to make of this. Curiosity urged him to ask for explanations. Dignity threw cold water on such a scheme. In the end dignity had the best of it.  'Oh, very well,' he said, and they went on in silence. In all the three years of their acquaintance they had never before happened upon such a crisis.  The silence lasted until they reached the form-room. Then Barrett determined, in the interests of the common good--he and Reade shared a study, and icy coolness in a small study is unpleasant--to chain up Dignity for the moment, and give Curiosity a trial.  'What's up with you today?' he asked.  He could hardly have chosen a worse formula. The question has on most people precisely the same effect as that which the query, 'Do you know where you lost it?' has on one who is engaged in looking for mislaid property.  'Nothing,' said Reade. Probably at the same moment hundreds of other people were making the same reply, in the same tone of voice, to the same question.  'Oh,' said Barrett.  There was another silence.  'You might as well answer my name this afternoon,' said Barrett, tentatively.  Reade walked off without replying, and Barrett went to his place feeling that curiosity was a fraud, and resolving to confine his attentions for the future to dignity. This was by-product number one of the Pavilion burglary.     CHAPTER IV CERTAIN REVELATIONS   During the last hour of morning school, Tony got a note from Jim.  'Graham,' said Mr Thompson, the master of the Sixth, sadly, just as Tony was about to open it.  'Yes, sir?'  'Kindly tear that note up, Graham.'  'Note, sir?'  'Kindly tear that note up, Graham. Come, you are keeping us waiting.'  As the hero of the novel says, further concealment was useless. Tony tore the note up unread.  'Hope it didn't want an answer,' he said to Jim after school. 'Constant practice has made Thompson a sort of amateur lynx.'  'No. It was only to ask you to be in the study directly after lunch. There's a most unholy row going to occur shortly, as far as I can see.'  'What, about this burglary business?'  'Yes. Haven't time to tell you now. See you after lunch.'  After lunch, having closed the study door, Jim embarked on the following statement.  It appeared that on the previous night he had left a book of notes, which were of absolutely vital importance for the examination which the Sixth had been doing in the earlier part of the morning, in the identical room in which the prizes had been placed. Or rather, he had left it there several days before, and had not needed it till that night. At half-past six the Pavilion had been locked up, and Biffen, the ground-man, had taken the key away with him, and it was only after tea had been consumed and the evening paper read, that Jim, thinking it about time to begin work, had discovered his loss. This was about half-past seven.  Being a House-prefect, Jim did not attend preparation in the Great Hall with the common herd of the Houses, but was part-owner with Tony of a study.  The difficulties of the situation soon presented themselves to him. It was only possible to obtain the notes in three ways--firstly, by going to the rooms of the Sixth Form master, who lived out of College; secondly, by borrowing from one of the other Sixth Form members of the House; and thirdly, by the desperate expedient of burgling the Pavilion. The objections to the first course were two. In the first place Merevale was taking prep. over in the Hall, and it was strictly forbidden for anyone to quit the House after lock-up without leave. And, besides, it was long odds that Thompson, the Sixth Form master, would not have the notes, as he had dictated them partly out of his head and partly from the works of various eminent scholars. The second course was out of the question. The only other Sixth Form boy in the House, Tony and Welch being away at Aldershot, was Charteris, and Charteris, who never worked much except the night before an exam, but worked then under forced draught, was appalled at the mere suggestion of letting his note-book out of his hands. Jim had sounded him on the subject and had met with the reply, 'Kill my father and burn my ancestral home, and I will look on and"]]]
