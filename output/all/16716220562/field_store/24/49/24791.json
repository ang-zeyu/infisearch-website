The picture of a man terribly leaden in complexion hung in an oval frame on one white wall and steadily confronted the bureau.  From between the slats of the blinds she had a view of the road as it wended across the meadow to the woods, and again where it reappeared crossing the hill, half a mile away. It lay yellow and warm in the summer sunshine. From the long grasses of the meadow came the rhythmic click of the insects. Occasional frogs in the hidden brook made a peculiar chug-chug sound, as if somebody throttled them. The leaves of the wood swung in gentle winds. Through the dark-green branches of the pines that grew in the front yard could be seen the mountains, far to the south-east, and inexpressibly blue.  Mary's eyes were fastened upon the little streak of road that appeared on the distant hill. Her face was flushed with excitement, and the hand which stretched in a strained pose on the sill trembled because of the nervous shaking of the wrist. The pines whisked their green needles with a soft, hissing sound against the house.  At last the girl turned from the window and went to the head of the stairs. \"Well, I just know they're coming, anyhow,\" she cried argumentatively to the depths.  A voice from below called to her angrily: \"They ain't. We've never seen one yet. They never come into this neighbourhood. You just come down here and 'tend to your work insteader watching for soldiers.\"  \"Well, ma, I just know they're coming.\"  A voice retorted with the shrillness and mechanical violence of occasional housewives. The girl swished her skirts defiantly and returned to the window.  Upon the yellow streak of road that lay across the hillside there now was a handful of black dots--horsemen. A cloud of dust floated away. The girl flew to the head of the stairs and whirled down into the kitchen.  \"They're coming! They're coming!\"  It was as if she had cried \"Fire!\" Her mother had been peeling potatoes while seated comfortably at the table. She sprang to her feet. \"No--it can't be--how you know it's them--where?\" The stubby knife fell from her hand, and two or three curls of potato skin dropped from her apron to the floor.  The girl turned and dashed upstairs. Her mother followed, gasping for breath, and yet contriving to fill the air with questions, reproach, and remonstrance. The girl was already at the window, eagerly pointing. \"There! There! See 'em! See 'em!\"  Rushing to the window, the mother scanned for an instant the road on the hill. She crouched back with a groan. \"It's them, sure as the world! It's them!\" She waved her hands in despairing gestures.  The black dots vanished into the wood. The girl at the window was quivering and her eyes were shining like water when the sun flashes. \"Hush! They're in the woods! They'll be here directly.\" She bent down and intently watched the green archway whence the road emerged. \"Hush! I hear 'em coming,\" she swiftly whispered to her mother, for the elder woman had dropped dolefully upon the mattress and was sobbing. And, indeed, the girl could hear the quick, dull trample of horses. She stepped aside with sudden apprehension, but she bent her head forward in order to still scan the road.  \"Here they are!\"  There was something very theatrical in the sudden appearance of these men to the eyes of the girl. It was as if a scene had been shifted. The forest suddenly disclosed them--a dozen brown-faced troopers in blue--galloping.  \"Oh, look!\" breathed the girl. Her mouth was puckered into an expression of strange fascination, as if she had expected to see the troopers change into demons and gloat at her. She was at last looking upon those curious beings who rode down from the North--those men of legend and colossal tale--they who were possessed of such marvellous hallucinations.  The little troop rode in silence. At its head was a youthful fellow with some dim yellow stripes upon his arm. In his right hand he held his carbine, slanting upward, with the stock resting upon his knee. He was absorbed in a scrutiny of the country before him.  At the heels of the sergeant the rest of the squad rode in thin column, with creak of leather and tinkle of steel and tin. The girl scanned the faces of the horsemen, seeming astonished vaguely to find them of the type she knew.  The lad at the head of the troop comprehended the house and its environments in two glances. He did not check the long, swinging stride of his horse. The troopers glanced for a moment like casual tourists, and then returned to their study of the region in front. The heavy thudding of the hoofs became a small noise. The dust, hanging in sheets, slowly sank.  The sobs of the woman on the bed took form in words which, while strong in their note of calamity, yet expressed a querulous mental reaching for some near thing to blame. \"And it'll be lucky fer us if we ain't both butchered in our sleep--plundering and running off horses--old Santo's gone--you see if he ain't--plundering--\"  \"But, ma,\" said the girl, perplexed and terrified in the same moment, \"they've gone.\"  \"Oh, but they'll come back!\" cried the mother, without pausing her wail. \"They'll come back--trust them for that--running off horses. O John, John! why did you, why did you?\" She suddenly lifted herself and sat rigid, staring at her daughter. \"Mary,\" she said in tragic whisper, \"the kitchen door isn't locked!\" Already she was bended forward to listen, her mouth agape, her eyes fixed upon her daughter.  \"Mother,\" faltered the girl.  Her mother again whispered, \"The kitchen door isn't locked.\"  Motionless and mute they stared into each other's eyes.  At last the girl quavered, \"We better--we better go and lock it.\" The mother nodded. Hanging arm in arm they stole across the floor toward the head of the stairs. A board of the floor creaked. They halted and exchanged a look of dumb agony.  At last they reached the head of the stairs. From the kitchen came the bass humming of the kettle and frequent sputterings and cracklings from the fire. These sounds were sinister. The mother and the girl stood incapable of movement. \"There's somebody down there!\" whispered the elder woman.  Finally, the girl made a gesture of resolution. She twisted her arm from her mother's hands and went two steps downward. She addressed the kitchen: \"Who's there?\" Her tone was intended to be dauntless. It rang so dramatically in the silence that a sudden new panic seized them as if the suspected presence in the kitchen had cried out to them. But the girl ventured again: \"Is there anybody there?\" No reply was made save by the kettle and the fire.  With a stealthy tread the girl continued her journey. As she neared the last step the fire crackled explosively and the girl screamed. But the mystic presence had not swept around the corner to grab her, so she dropped to a seat on the step and laughed. \"It was--was only the--the fire,\" she said, stammering hysterically.  Then she arose with sudden fortitude and cried: \"Why, there isn't anybody there! I know there isn't.\" She marched down into the kitchen. In her face was dread, as if she half expected to confront something, but the room was empty. She cried joyously: \"There's nobody here! Come on down, ma.\" She ran to the kitchen door and locked it.  The mother came down to the kitchen. \"Oh, dear, what a fright I've had! It's given me the sick headache. I know it has.\"  \"Oh, ma,\" said the girl.  \"I know it has--I know it. Oh, if your father was only here! He'd settle those Yankees mighty quick--he'd settle 'em! Two poor helpless women--\"  \"Why, ma, what makes you act so? The Yankees haven't--\"  \"Oh, they'll be back--they'll be back. Two poor helpless women! Your father and your uncle Asa and Bill off galavanting around and fighting when they ought to be protecting their home! That's the kind of men they are. Didn't I say to your father just before he left--\"  \"Ma,\" said the girl, coming suddenly from the window, \"the barn door is open. I wonder if they took old Santo?\"  \"Oh, of course they have--of course--Mary, I don't see what we are going to do--I don't see what we are going to do.\"  The girl said, \"Ma, I'm going to see if they took old Santo.\"  \"Mary,\" cried the mother, \"don't you dare!\"  \"But think of poor old Sant, ma.\"  \"Never you mind old Santo. We're lucky to be safe ourselves, I tell you. Never mind old Santo. Don't you dare to go out there, Mary--Mary!\"  The girl had unlocked the door and stepped out upon the porch. The mother cried in despair, \"Mary!\"  \"Why, there isn't anybody out here,\" the girl called in response. She stood for a moment with a curious smile upon her face as of gleeful satisfaction at her daring.  The breeze was waving the boughs of the apple trees. A rooster with an air importantly courteous was conducting three hens upon a foraging tour. On the hillside at the rear of the grey old barn the red leaves of a creeper flamed amid the summer foliage. High in the sky clouds rolled toward the north. The girl swung impulsively from the little stoop and ran toward the barn.  The great door was open, and the carved peg which usually performed the office of a catch lay on the ground. The girl could not see into the barn because of the heavy shadows. She paused in a listening attitude and heard a horse munching placidly. She gave a cry of delight and sprang across the threshold. Then she suddenly shrank back and gasped. She had confronted three men in grey seated upon the floor with their legs stretched out and their backs against Santo's manger. Their dust-covered countenances were expanded in grins.     II   As Mary sprang backward and screamed, one of the calm men in grey, still grinning, announced, \"I knowed you'd holler.\" Sitting there comfortably the three surveyed her with amusement.  Mary caught her breath, throwing her hand up to her throat. \"Oh!\" she said, \"you--you frightened me!\"  \"We're sorry, lady, but couldn't help it no way,\" cheerfully responded another. \"I knowed you'd holler "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6979"],["title","The Little Regiment, and Other Episodes of the American Civil War (#5)"],["body","I seen you coming yere, but I raikoned we couldn't help it no way. We hain't a-troubling this yere barn, I don't guess. We been doing some mighty tall sleeping yere. We done woke when them Yanks loped past.\"  \"Where did you come from? Did--did you escape from the--the Yankees?\" The girl still stammered and trembled.  The three soldiers laughed. \"No, m'm. No, m'm. They never cotch us. We was in a muss down the road yere about two mile. And Bill yere they gin it to him in the arm, kehplunk. And they pasted me thar, too. Curious, And Sim yere, he didn't get nothing, but they chased us all quite a little piece, and we done lose track of our boys.\"  \"Was it--was it those who passed here just now? Did they chase you?\"  The men in grey laughed again. \"What--them? No, indeedee! There was a mighty big swarm of Yanks and a mighty big swarm of our boys, too. What--that little passel? No, m'm.\"  She became calm enough to scan them more attentively. They were much begrimed and very dusty. Their grey clothes were tattered. Splashed mud had dried upon them in reddish spots. It appeared, too, that the men had not shaved in many days. In the hats there was a singular diversity. One soldier wore the little blue cap of the Northern infantry, with corps emblem and regimental number; one wore a great slouch hat with a wide hole in the crown; and the other wore no hat at all. The left sleeve of one man and the right sleeve of another had been slit, and the arms were neatly bandaged with clean cloths. \"These hain't no more than two little cuts,\" explained one. \"We stopped up yere to Mis' Leavitts--she said her name was--and she bind them for us. Bill yere, he had the thirst come on him. And the fever too. We----\"  \"Did you ever see my father in the army?\" asked Mary. \"John Hinckson--his name is.\"  The three soldiers grinned again, but they replied kindly: \"No, m'm. No, m'm, we hain't never. What is he--in the cavalry?\"  \"No,\" said the girl. \"He and my uncle Asa and my cousin--his name is Bill Parker--they are all with Longstreet--they call him.\"  \"Oh,\" said the soldiers. \"Longstreet? Oh, they're a good smart ways from yere. 'Way off up nawtheast. There hain't nothing but cavalry down yere. They're in the infantry, probably.\"  \"We haven't heard anything from them for days and days,\" said Mary.  \"Oh, they're all right in the infantry,\" said one man, to be consoling. \"The infantry don't do much fighting. They go bellering out in a big swarm and only a few of 'em get hurt. But if they was in the cavalry--the cavalry--\"  Mary interrupted him without intention. \"Are you hungry?\" she asked.  The soldiers looked at each other, struck by some sudden and singular shame. They hung their heads. \"No, m'm,\" replied one at last.  Santo, in his stall, was tranquilly chewing and chewing. Sometimes he looked benevolently over at them. He was an old horse, and there was something about his eyes and his forelock which created the impression that he wore spectacles. Mary went and patted his nose. \"Well, if you are hungry, I can get you something,\" she told the men. \"Or you might come to the house.\"  \"We wouldn't dast go to the house,\" said one. \"That passel of Yanks was only a scouting crowd, most like. Just an advance. More coming, likely.\"  \"Well, I can bring you something,\" cried the girl eagerly. \"Won't you let me bring you something?\"  \"Well,\" said a soldier with embarrassment, \"we hain't had much. If you could bring us a little snack--like--just a snack--we'd--\"  Without waiting for him to cease, the girl turned toward the door. But before she had reached it she stopped abruptly. \"Listen!\" she whispered. Her form was bent forward, her head turned and lowered, her hand extended toward the men, in a command for silence.  They could faintly hear the thudding of many hoofs, the clank of arms, and frequent calling voices.  \"By cracky, it's the Yanks!\" The soldiers scrambled to their feet and came toward the door. \"I knowed that first crowd was only an advance.\"  The girl and the three men peered from the shadows of the barn. The view of the road was intersected by tree trunks and a little henhouse. However, they could see many horsemen streaming down the road. The horsemen were in blue. \"Oh, hide--hide--hide!\" cried the girl, with a sob in her voice.  \"Wait a minute,\" whispered a grey soldier excitedly. \"Maybe they're going along by. No, by thunder, they hain't! They're halting. Scoot, boys!\"  They made a noiseless dash into the dark end of the barn. The girl, standing by the door, heard them break forth an instant later in clamorous whispers. \"Where'll we hide? Where'll we hide? There hain't a place to hide!\" The girl turned and glanced wildly about the barn. It seemed true. The stock of hay had grown low under Santo's endless munching, and from occasional levyings by passing troopers in grey. The poles of the mow were barely covered, save in one corner where there was a little bunch.  The girl espied the great feed-box. She ran to it and lifted the lid. \"Here! here!\" she called. \"Get in here.\"  They had been tearing noiselessly around the rear part of the barn. At her low call they came and plunged at the box. They did not all get in at the same moment without a good deal of a tangle. The wounded men gasped and muttered, but they at last were flopped down on the layer of feed which covered the bottom. Swiftly and softly the girl lowered the lid and then turned like a flash toward the door.  No one appeared there, so she went close to survey the situation. The troopers had dismounted, and stood in silence by their horses.  A grey-bearded man, whose red cheeks and nose shone vividly above the whiskers, was strolling about with two or three others. They wore double-breasted coats, and faded yellow sashes were wound under their black leather sword-belts. The grey-bearded soldier was apparently giving orders, pointing here and there.  Mary tiptoed to the feed-box. \"They've all got off their horses,\" she said to it. A finger projected from a knot-hole near the top, and said to her very plainly, \"Come closer.\" She obeyed, and then a muffled voice could be heard: \"Scoot for the house, lady, and if we don't see you again, why, much obliged for what you done.\"  \"Good-bye,\" she said to the feed-box.  She made two attempts to walk dauntlessly from the barn, but each time she faltered and failed just before she reached the point where she could have been seen by the blue-coated troopers. At last, however, she made a sort of a rush forward and went out into the bright sunshine.  The group of men in double-breasted coats wheeled in her direction at the instant. The grey-bearded officer forgot to lower his arm which had been stretched forth in giving an order.  She felt that her feet were touching the ground in a most unnatural manner. Her bearing, she believed, was suddenly grown awkward and ungainly. Upon her face she thought that this sentence was plainly written: \"There are three men hidden in the feed-box.\"  The grey-bearded soldier came toward her. She stopped; she seemed about to run away. But the soldier doffed his little blue cap and looked amiable. \"You live here, I presume?\" he said.  \"Yes,\" she answered.  \"Well, we are obliged to camp here for the night, and as we've got two wounded men with us I don't suppose you'd mind if we put them in the barn.\"  \"In--in the barn?\"  He became aware that she was agitated. He smiled assuringly. \"You needn't be frightened. We won't hurt anything around here. You'll all be safe enough.\"  The girl balanced on one foot and swung the other to and fro in the grass. She was looking down at it. \"But--but I don't think ma would like it if--if you took the barn.\"  The old officer laughed. \"Wouldn't she?\" said he. \"That's so. Maybe she wouldn't.\" He reflected for a time and then decided cheerfully: \"Well, we will have to go ask her, anyhow. Where is she? In the house?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the girl, \"she's in the house. She--she'll be scared to death when she sees you!\"  \"Well, you go and ask her then,\" said the soldier, always wearing a benign smile. \"You go ask her and then come and tell me.\"  When the girl pushed open the door and entered the kitchen, she found it empty. \"Ma!\" she called softly. There was no answer. The kettle still was humming its low song. The knife and the curl of potato-skin lay on the floor.  She went to her mother's room and entered timidly. The new, lonely aspect of the house shook her nerves. Upon the bed was a confusion of coverings. \"Ma!\" called the girl, quaking in fear that her mother was not there to reply. But there was a sudden turmoil of the quilts, and her mother's head was thrust forth. \"Mary!\" she cried, in what seemed to be a supreme astonishment, \"I thought--I thought----\"  \"Oh, ma,\" blurted the girl, \"there's over a thousand Yankees in the yard, and I've hidden three of our men in the feed-box!\"  The elder woman, however, upon the appearance of her daughter had begun to thrash hysterically about on the bed and wail.  \"Ma!\" the girl exclaimed, \"and now they want to use the barn--and our men in the feed-box! What shall I do, ma? What shall I do?\"  Her mother did not seem to hear, so absorbed was she in her grievous flounderings and tears. \"Ma!\" appealed the girl. \"Ma!\"  For a moment Mary stood silently debating, her lips apart, her eyes fixed. Then she went to the kitchen window and peeked.  The old officer and the others were staring up the road. She went to another window in order to get a proper view of the road, and saw that they were gazing at a small body of horsemen approaching at a trot and raising much dust. Presently she recognised them as the squad that had passed the house earlier, for the young man with the dim yellow chevron still rode at their head. An unarmed horseman in grey was receiving their close attention.  As they came very near to the house she darted to the first window again. The grey-bearded officer was smiling a fine broad smile of satisfaction. \"So you got him?"]]]
