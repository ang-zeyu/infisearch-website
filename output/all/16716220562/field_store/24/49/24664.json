When it was explained to the doubters that the Nelson was capable of making a hundred miles an hour against a stiff breeze, the natives seemed to doubt the veracity of the boys.  The Peruvians knew little of airships, and when Jimmie exhibited to them daily newspapers showing how Germany was building a fleet of three hundred airships to use in case of war, they still looked incredulous.  \"Look here, fellers,\" Jimmie explained to them, later in the afternoon of the arrival, as a group of curious ones stood about the roped-in enclosure where the Nelson lay, \"I guess you don't know much about the navigation of the air.  It used to be risky; now it is no more so than riding on a railroad train.\"  \"You say it well!\"  The words were spoken in good English, seemingly in a boy's voice, and Jimmie peered through his audience in order to catch a glimpse of the speaker.  Presently, above the heads which surrounded him, the boy saw a hand and arm extended.  The palm was out, the thumb and little finger flat and crossed, the three remaining fingers held straight out.  The full salute of the Boy Scouts.  \"Say, you!\" the lad cried out, greatly pleased at finding a Boy Scout there.  \"Where did you get that?\"  \"Scouted for it!\" was the reply.  \"What does it read?\"  \"Be prepared!\"  \"Where from?\" was the next question.  \"Fox Patrol, Chicago.\"  \"You must be pretty foxy,\" Jimmie laughed, \"to get away off here.\"  The member of the Fox Patrol now made his way through the crowd and extended a hand to Jimmie.  \"You don't look as if it paid to be a Fox,\" laughed the latter.  The boy certainly did look like a tramp.  He was a lad of about sixteen, well formed as to figure and attractive as to feature, with bright blue eyes, long, fair hair, and a complexion which would have been perfect only for the grime upon it.  He blushed as Jimmie looked him over, and involuntarily turned his eyes down to his ragged clothing and broken shoes.  \"Forget that!\" Jimmie cried, in a moment.  \"I didn't mean anything by it.  Where you stopping?\"  The fact was that Jimmie suspected from the appearance of the lad that he was hungry as well as ragged and dirty.  He certainly looked hungry.  The boy hesitated before replying, his hands deep in his trousers pockets, his eyes on the ground.  Then a whimsical smile came to his face and he looked Jimmie squarely in the face.  \"No use of lyin' about it,\" he said.  \"I'm stoppin' down here at the Blue Sky Hotel.  It's a dandy place to stop at.  They never present a board bill.\"  Jimmie sat back on the rope which was drawn about the Nelson to keep meddlesome ones away from the machine and burst into a roar of laughter.  The crowd looked on stupidly, glancing from boy to boy, and then at one another, as if wondering if these Americans always went crazy when they met in a foreign land.  \"I know that Blue Sky Hotel,\" Jimmie said, presently, \"though I've never heard it called by that name before.  I had a room in one, in Central Park, New York, until a sparrow cop drove me out of it.  I liked it because I didn't have to dress for dinner there,\" he added, whimsically.  \"The feed is rather slim,\" observed the other.  \"It's run on the European plan,\" grinned Jimmie.  \"You get your sleepins, an' no one cares whether you get your eatin's or not. What's your name?\"  \"Dougherty--Mike Dougherty, Clark street, south of Van Buren!\"  \"I guess you must be French,\" Jimmie grinned.  \"You've guessed it.  Now, what's your name, and what are you boys doin' here with this old sky-ship?\"  \"I'll tell you all about it when we get back to the hotel,\" Jimmie replied.  \"Do you know any of the gazabos about here?  I want some one to watch the ginks who are watchin' the mutts who are watchin' the aeroplane.\"  Dougherty laughed at this suggestion of a treble surveillance and pointed out a lanky looking individual who was studying the machine closely from the outer side of the roped-circle.  \"That's Pedro,\" he said.  \"He's all right.  About all I've had to eat since I came here he's given me.  He's a Peruvian Indian, and in need of money.  Give him a dollar, and he'll guard your guards a month, and never leave the machine, night or day.\"  \"Does he talk United States?\"  \"Oh, just a little.\"  Pedro talked quite a little United States, as Jimmie called it, and a bargain was soon struck with him.  Then the two boys started away together.  First they visited a clothing store, where Jimmie looked at the best suits in stock, and measured Dougherty cautiously with his eyes.  A full outfit of under and outer clothing provided, they proceeded to the hotel, where Jimmie ushered his new-found friend into a commodious bathroom.  \"Remove some of your real estate,\" the boy said, \"an' hop into these new clothes.  They ain't very nobby, but the best I could get here.\"  Mike Dougherty stood looking at Jimmie for a moment as if he could not believe what he heard.  It had been a long time since he had been clean and properly clothed.  Then there came a suspicious moisture to his keen eyes and he turned away.  \"Oh, well,\" he said, with a tremble in his clear young voice, \"mebbe I'll be able to pay you back some day.  Just now I'm--\"  \"Cut it out!\" Jimmie replied.  \"You hain't got anythin' on me.  I've been there meself, an' the Boy Scout that helped me out told me to pass it along.  That's what I'm doin' now, and there's nothin' more to be said.  When you get washed and dressed, come on to No. 4, that's the second room from this tub, on the left of the corridor, an' I'll show you the rest of the bunch.\"  Jimmie went away to No. 4, where Ned and Sam Leroy were waiting for him.  Somehow, it seemed to Ned that Jimmie kept him waiting about half the time when they were in a strange city.  The little fellow had a way of wandering off alone and forgetting all about time in his delight at the strange things he saw.  When he entered No. 4 he found Ned standing near the door.  \"Were you out there before?\" Ned asked, pointing to the corridor, as Jimmie stepped inside.  \"Just got here,\" was the reply.  \"Found a Boy Scout from the Fox Patrol, Chicago, an' brought him along with me.  He's washin' some of the Peruvian scenery off his frame, now, an' will soon be along.\"  Then Jimmie told of his discovery of Mike Dougherty, of his leaving a treble guard around the Nelson, and of numerous other adventures in the city, which, not being in any way connected with this narrative, are not set down here.  \"I'm glad you brought this boy Mike here,\" Ned said, at the conclusion of the story.  \"We need some one who knows something about Lima to keep us posted.\"  \"About what?\" asked Jimmie.  \"We're spotted!\" Leroy cried out, before Ned could answer the question.  \"The wireless is swifter than the Nelson!\"  \"How do you know?\" demanded the little fellow.  \"How do you know we're spotted?\"  \"Oh, Ned's been doping it out,\" was the reply.  \"He'll tell you, I guess.\"  \"You thought you'd take the cream off the sensation!\" laughed Ned. \"Well, that is the boy of it!  All I know about it, Jimmie,\" he continued, \"is that I've been receiving telegrams which simply mean nothing.  They are from people I have never heard of, and are most mysteriously worded.\"  \"There's one that tells you to get out of the country,\" suggested Leroy.  \"Yes, but the others seem to infer that the man who sent them is out of his mind.  The three received are from Washington, San Francisco, and New Orleans.\"  \"What have the messages to do with our being spotted?\" asked Jimmie. \"I don't see any connection.\"  \"Stupid!\" cried Leroy.  \"Can't you see the wires were sent to locate Ned?  The person who delivered them to him sure wired back that they had been delivered to Ned in person--in other words, that he has reached Lima on his journey to Paraguay.\"  \"I see!\" Jimmie said, slowly.  \"It's clever, eh?\"  \"Too clever,\" Ned said.  \"I don't like the looks of it.  It means, of course, that the people who are trying to get the cattle concession away from Mr. Lyman have secret agents here.  And that means that everything we do at Lima will be watched and reported.\"  \"Reported to whom?\" asked Leroy.  \"Probably to this military person, Senor Lopez, who is on the job with both hands out,\" suggested Jimmie.  \"Well?  What about it?\"  \"I think,\" Leroy cut in, \"that we'd better be getting out of this. They can't follow us after we get up in the air.\"  Here a knock came on the door, and Jimmie admitted Mike and presented him to his chums.  The boy looked trim and handsome in his new suit, and all took a great liking to him.  While they discussed their plans another interruption took place, and then Jimmie saw Pedro at the door, beckoning excitedly to Mike Dougherty.  The boy talked with the Indian for a short time, and then turned to Ned, excitement showing in his face.  \"He says there's another airship here,\" Mike said.  \"Prowling over the mountains.\"  \"They can't follow us in the air, eh?\" cried Leroy.  \"I guess this is going some!\"     CHAPTER III  BLACK BEARS ON THE AMAZON   The handsome club room of the Black Bear Patrol, in the city of New York, was situated on the top floor of the magnificent residence of Attorney Bosworth, one of the leading corporation lawyers in the country.  Jack Bosworth, the lawyer's only son, was a member of the Black Bear Patrol, and the club room had been fitted up at his request.  It was in this room that Ned Nestor, Jimmie McGraw, Jack Bosworth, Harry Stevens, and Frank Shaw had planned their motor-boat trip down the Columbia river, as described in the first volume of this series. Jack, Harry and Frank had returned to New York from San Francisco when Ned had decided to accept the Secret Service mission to Paraguay, at the conclusion of the motor-boat vacation on the Columbia, leaving the two boats, the Black Bear and the Wolf, stored at Portland, Oregon.  One evening--the evening of the 1st of August, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6904"],["title","Boy Scouts in an Airship; Or, The Warning from the Sky (#3)"],["body"," exact--while Ned, Sam, and Jimmie were still in San Francisco, awaiting the slow action of the State department at Washington, Jack, Frank and Harry met in the club room for the purpose of \"sobbing together,\" as they expressed it.  They had left their friends in San Francisco reluctantly because of orders from home, and now they understood that they might have gone with Ned and Jimmie if they had only explained to their parents the purpose of the mission.  \"I suppose,\" Frank Shaw said, at the end of a long pause in the conversation, \"I suppose Ned and the others are out over the Andes by this time.\"  \"No,\" replied Jack.  \"I heard from Jimmie by wire today, and they are still in Frisco, and likely to remain there nearly a week longer.\"  \"If the airship was only large enough!\" sighed Harry.  \"We might still get there in time!\" Frank suggested, eagerly.  \"The Nelson wouldn't carry us if we were there,\" Jack exclaimed, in a disgusted tone.  \"I wish the Black Bear had wings!  Say, wouldn't that be a peach?  We could run over to Paraguay and scare the life out of the boys!\"  \"What good would it do if she had wings?\" demanded Frank.  \"She is in storage at Portland, Oregon.\"  \"No,\" replied Harry Stevens, whose father, a noted maker of automobiles, had presented the motor-boats to his son, \"I ordered the boats sent on here the day after we left the coast.   We can take a trip up the Hudson, anyway.\"  Jack walked thoughtfully around the room for a moment and then turned back to the others, looking moodily out of a window.  \"I've got it!\" he shouted, slapping Frank on the back.  \"I should say you had!\" remarked Frank.  \"What do you take for it?\"  \"I say I've got an idea!\" Jack explained, jumping up and down and swinging his hands over his head.  \"A peach of an idea!\"  \"Does it hurt?\" asked Harry.  \"Oh, cut out that funny stuff!\" Jack cried.  \"When will the two motor-boats be here?\"  Harry counted on the fingers of his left hand.  \"We've been home two days,\" he said, \"and we were four days getting to Chicago.  There we laid over a day, and came on here in twenty hours.  We are eight days from the Pacific coast.  That right?\"  \"It seems to be.\"  \"Well, then, it is seven days since I ordered the Black Bear and the Wolf sent on here in a special express car.  They ought to be here now.\"  \"Then,\" shouted Jack, pulling Harry around the room, \"we're all right--fit as a brass band at a free lunch!  Whoo-pee!\"  \"It must be hungry,\" Frank exclaimed, regarding Jack with seeming terror.  \"Does it ever bite when it puts out these signals of distress?\"  \"Don't get too funny!\" Jack warned.  \"Then loosen up on this alleged idea!\" Frank replied.  Jack rushed across the room and brought out an atlas of the world, which he dumped on the floor and opened.  \"Look here, fellows!\" he said, squatting over the map of South America, his chin almost on his knees.  \"We're looking,\" grinned Frank.  \"What about it?\"  \"Here we are in New York,\" Jack went on.  \"Here they are in San Francisco.  Now, they've got to sail to Paraguay, which is just about twice as far from San Francisco as is New York.  Anyway, that's the way it looks on the map.\"  \"It is all of that distance,\" Harry put in.  \"Well,\" Jack continued, \"as I said before, here we are in New York, with the mouth of the Amazon river about as far away as San Francisco, perhaps a little farther.\"  \"Well?\" demanded Harry.  \"I begin to see the point!\" Frank admitted.  \"But will the folks stand for it?\"  \"Mine will,\" Harry answered.  \"Dad didn't make the Black Bear to lie in storage.  He'll stand for it, all right.\"  \"So will mine,\" Frank said, then.  \"I'll tell him I'll send him a lot of news for his paper.\"  Frank's father was owner and editor of the Planet, one of the leading morning newspapers in the big city, and it was always a fiction of the boy's that he was going out in the interest of the paper when he wandered off on a trip with the Boy Scouts.  \"I'm afraid you can't make that work again,\" laughed Jack.  \"Ned says that you sent only four postal cards and six letters back from Panama.\"  \"Well, wasn't that going some?\" asked Frank.  \"Of course, only Ned says the postal cards carried the correspondence for the Planet, and the letters carried requests for more money!\"  \"Anyway,\" Frank insisted, \"Dad will stand for it.  What is it?\"  \"Well,\" Jack went on, \"I'm sure my Dad will let me go.  He wants me to go about all I can.  Says it brightens a fellow to rub up against the rough places of the world.\"  \"There's rough corners enough in South America,\" laughed Harry.  \"Now, let us get down to figures,\" Jack continued.  \"We ought to be able to get to the mouth of the Amazon on a fast boat, with the Black Bear and the Wolf on board, in a week or ten days-say ten days.  About that time they will be getting into Paraguay.  What do you think of it?\"  \"Fine!\" cried Harry.  \"The best ever!\" Frank responded.  \"But what then?  We can't run up to Paraguay in the Black Bear.\"  \"We can get away up in the Andes,\" answered Jack, with the map of Brazil before him.  \"See these crooked little lines?  Well, those are rivers.  Just see how far we can go in a motor boat.\"  \"But that won't bring us to the aeroplane,\" Frank objected.  \"Yes, it will,\" Harry answered.  \"They are coming back by way of the Amazon valley, and we can't miss them.  Oh, what's the use?  Suppose we begin packing?\"  \"Well, I don't know exactly what we are to do after we get up the Amazon,\" Harry laughed, \"but I'm game to go.  There are head-hunters and cannibals up there, and we may find a little amusement.\"  \"We're going after Ned and Jimmie,\" Jack explained.  \"This is a relief expedition!  After they get to Paraguay they'll snatch that Lyman person out of the cold, damp dungeon keep he is supposed to be in and then sail off over the Amazon valley.  There's where we catch up with them.  Do you suppose we can find a ship going to the mouth of the Amazon early in the morning?\"  \"You certainly are fierce when you get started!\" laughed Harry. \"Well,\" he added, \"you can't get ready any too soon to please me.\"  It was two days before the boys found a vessel going their way, and even then Jack insisted that his father bribed the owners to run off their course in order to set the boys and their motorboats down at the mouth of the Amazon river.  The boat, however, was a fast one, equal in speed to a modern ocean liner; and in ten days from the time of starting from New York--on the 12th of August--the boys were stemming the current of the great river--more like a shoreless sea there at the mouth than a river!  \"Huh!\" Frank exclaimed, as they left the island of Joannes to the south, \"this is no river!  It is a blooming sea!\"  \"Pretty near three hundred miles wide at the delta, including that big island,\" Harry said.  \"It is some river, eh?\"  \"Four thousand miles long!\" Jack contributed.  \"It is navigable for commercial purposes for 2,200 miles, and our boats can go up clear to the foot of the Andes.\"  \"Boats went there in the days of Columbus,\" Frank said.  \"A companion of Columbus first discovered this great delta.  The river fertilizes two million square miles of territory, and is the greatest water system in the world.\"  \"Why,\" Harry observed, desiring to contribute something startling to the discussion of the river, \"the current is so strong that it carries fresh water and sand five hundred miles out into the Atlantic Ocean.  It is just a fresh water river in a salt water sea for five hundred miles!\"  That night the boys kept the engines of the Black Bear going, one remaining on watch all through the dark hours.  They had plenty of gasoline in the tank, and the tender, the Wolf, was carrying a load of fuel which Jack declared would last them until the end of the year!  It may be well to state here that the Black Bear, the Boy Scout motorboat, was a specially constructed vessel, built by Harry's father for river work.  The materials were light yet strong, and the boat could easily be taken apart and put together again when occasion required.  Between the cross-grained slices of tough wood of which the craft was built were plates of steel, thus rendering the boat virtually bullet proof.  The Black Bear was constructed so that it could be almost entirely thrown open to the sunshine when so desired or closed tightly against cold or rain.  The roof could be rolled up in a bundle in the middle like the curtain of a modern desk.  The sides were composed of oblong panels which could be inserted in grooved steel uprights when it was desired to close in the interior of the boat. The motors were very powerful.  In fact, it was just such a boat as was needed on the trip the boys had in mind.  It had done excellent service on the Columbia, and nothing less could be expected of it on the Amazon.  The Wolf, which was merely a tender, was watertight in construction, being shaped like a banana, and was towed by the motor-boat.  Here the extra stocks of gasoline, provisions, and ammunition were packed.  The interior of the Wolf was about six feet by eighteen in size, while the distance from rounded floor to convex roof was about four feet.  On both sides of the interior were gasoline tanks, which also extended under the floor, lifting the bottom of the interior space three feet.  Above the tanks were spaces for provisions and ammunition.  The space between the tanks and the lockers was about two feet, and here one might ride in comfort, after getting used to the rolling of the boat.  There were tight glass panels of thick plate glass at the ends and the top.  Ventilators and loopholes, controlled by wires from the center, were cut in the ends and protected by sliding covers.  Lying in the passageway, one might look out at either end, and shoot out, too, if occasion required.  When fully loaded, the Wolf was submerged about half its height.  On the top was a staff from which floated an American flag.  The boys were very proud of the Wolf, and Jimmie had often declared,"]]]
