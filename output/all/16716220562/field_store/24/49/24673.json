The young Kentuckian from his place of concealment smiled to himself.  \"There are some things which even a Shawanoe, cannot do, and that's one of them.\"  Such was the fact; for, with that care which the trained pioneer never permits himself to forget or disregard, the lad had adopted every artifice at his command to add to the difficulty of identifying his footsteps.  The warrior straightened up with an impatient \"Ugh!\" which brought another smile to the face of the watcher, for it proved beyond question the failure of his foes.  The Shawanoe, however, had established one fact--the overrunning of the trail.  The one for whom they were searching had left the path at some point behind them.  Scant chance was there of learning the precise spot.  \"Follow me if you can,\" was the exultant thought of Jack, who carefully lowered the hammer of his rifle.  \"I'm glad that as the painter was determined on picking a quarrel with me he did not do it earlier in the day--helloa!\"  While speaking to himself, he became aware that the warriors were invisible.  They may have believed they were acting as oscillating targets for some hidden enemy, who was likely to press the trigger at any moment; and, unable even to approximate as they were his biding-place, they withdrew in their characteristic fashion.  Jack thrust his head still further from behind the tree, and finally stepped forth that he might obtain the best view he could.  But the red men had vanished like the shadows of swiftly-moving clouds. Nothing more was to be feared from that source.  But with the lifting of the peril from his own shoulders, there returned his distressing anxiety for his absent companion.  No doubt could exist that when he put his horse to his hurried flight, he had done so to escape the Indians.  Whether he had succeeded remained to be learned, but Jack felt that every probability was against it.  He might well debate as to his own duty in the premises.  His one desire was to learn what had become of Otto, the German lad, with whom he left the Settlements a couple of days before.  Neither had ever visited this section, but they were following the instructions of those who had, and the young Kentuckian knew the precise point in their journey that had been reached.  Standing as motionless as the trees beside him and amid the darkening shadows, Jack Carleton listened with the intentness of an Indian scout stealing into a hostile camp.  The soft murmur which seems to reach us when a sea-shell is held to the ear filled the air.  It was the voice of the night--the sighing of the scarcely moving wind among the multitudinous branches, the restless movements of myriads of trees--the soft embrace of millions of leaves, which, like the great ocean itself, even when the air is pulseless, is never at rest.  Jack Carleton had spent too many days and nights in the woods to be greatly impressed with the solemnity and grandeur of his surroundings.  That which would have awed his soul, if noted for the first time, had lost the power to do so from its familiarity; but while in the attitude of listening, he became conscious of another sound which did not belong to the vast forest, the throbbing air, nor the gathering darkness.     CHAPTER III  ON THE BANK OF THE MISSISSIPPI   That which reached the ears of Jack Carleton, while he stood in the woods, silent and listening, was a peculiar swashing noise, which continued a few seconds, followed by the same space of silence--the intervals being as regular as the ticking of a huge pendulum. Accompanying the sound was another, a soft, almost inaudible flow, such as one hears when standing on the bank of a vast stream of water.  He knew that both were caused by the sweep of the mighty Mississippi which was near at hand.  The reason for the first he could not understand, but that of the latter was apparent.  He had never looked upon the Father of Waters, but many a time he had rested along the Ohio and been lulled to sleep by its musical flow, even while the camp-fires of the hostile red men twinkled on the other shore.  Manifestly nothing could be done by remaining where he was, and, in the same guarded manner in which he left the trail a half hour before, he began picking his way back.  Probably he ran greater personal risk in following the beaten path, yet he was controlled by a true hunter's instinct in every movement made.  When he reached the trail, he observed that not only had the night descended, but the full moon was shining from an almost unclouded sky.  The trees, crowned with exuberant vegetation, cast deep shadows, like those of the electric light, and only here and there did the arrowy moonbeams strike the ground, redolent with the odors of fresh earth and moldering leaves.  \"Some of the warriors may be returning or groping along the trail,\" was the thought of the youth, who glided silently forward, his senses on the alert.  His misgivings, however, were much less than when watching the two Shawanoes, for with the dense gloom of the forest inclosing him on every hand, he felt that the shelter was not only secure but was of instant avail.  Less than a furlong was passed, when he caught the shimmering of water.  A few steps further and he stood for the first time on the bank of the Mississippi.  The youth felt those emotions which must come to every one when he emerges from a vast forest at night and pauses beside one of the grandest streams of the globe.  At that day its real source was unknown, but Jack, who was unusually well informed for one of his years, was aware that it rose somewhere among the snowy mountains and unexplored regions far to the northward, and that, after its winding course of hundreds of leagues, during which it received the volume of many rivers, enormous in themselves, it debouched into the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  The reflection of the turbid current showed that it was flowing swiftly.  The dark line of the forest on the other shore appeared like a solid wall of blackness, while to the north and south the view ended in the same impenetrable gloom.  Impressed and awed by the scene, the lad saw something which at first startled him by its resemblance to a man, standing in the river, with his feet braced against the bottom and his head and shoulders above the surface.  The current seemed to rush against his bared breast, from which it was cast back and aside, as though flung off by a granite rock.  Then the head bowed forward, as if the strong man sought to bathe his brain in the cooling waters, that he might be refreshed against the next shock.  A minute's scrutiny was enough to show Jack that the object was a tree, which, rolling into the river at some point, perhaps hundreds of miles above, had grown weary of its journey, and, plunging its feet into the muddy bed of the stream, had, refused to go further. The fierce current would lift the head several feet with a splash, but could hold it thus only a part of a minute, when it would dip for a brief while, to rise again and repeat the action.  The tree was what is known to-day on the Mississippi as a \"sawyer,\" and which is so dreaded by the steamers and other craft navigating the river.  Many a boat striking at full speed against them, have had their hulls pierced as if by a hundred-pound shell, and have gone to the bottom like stone.  It was the sound made by the \"sawyer\" which had puzzled Jack Carleton before he caught sight of the great river.  He could not wonder that he had failed to guess the cause of the intermittent swash which reached him through the woods.  \"And we must cross that stream,\"  murmured Jack, with half a shudder, as he looked out upon the prodigious volume rushing southward like myriads of wild horses; \"it seems to me no one can swim to the other shore, nor can a raft or boat be pushed thither.\"  The plucky boy would not have felt so distrustful and timid had the sun been shining overhead.  \"Ish dot you, Jack?\"  Young Carleton turned his head as if a war hoop had sounded in his ear.  He fairly bounded feet when he recognized his old friend at his elbow.  The good-natured German lad was grinning with delight, as he extended his chubby hand and asked:  \"How you vos?\"  \"Why, Otto!\" gasped Jack, slapping his palm against that of his friend and crushing it as if in a vise.  \"I am so glad to see you.\"  \"So I vos,\" was the grinning response; \"I'm always glad to shake hands mit myself.\"  \"But,\" said the other, looking furtively over each shoulder in turn, \"let's move away the trail, where we cannot be seen or heard.\"  The suggestion was a wise one, and acted upon without delay. The friends entered the wood, which continued quite open, and tramped steadily forward with the intention of finding place where they could start a fire and converse without danger of discovery by enemies.  The hearts of both were too full for hold their peace while stealing forward among the trees.  \"Otto,\" said Jack, \"where is the colt?\"  \"I dinks he's purty near New Orleans as soon as dis time.\"  Young Carleton looked wonderingly toward friend and asked, \"What do you mean?\"  \"I don't mean vot I don't say and derefore dinks I mean vot I vos.\"  \"So the colt went into the river?  Where were you?\"  \"Mit de colt and he vos mit me, so we bot vos mit each other.  Just feels of me.\"  Jack reached out his hand and pinched the clothing of his friend in several places.  It was saturated.  \"Ven I valks, de vater in my shoes squishes up to mine ears--don't you hear 'em?\"  \"Why don't you pour it out?\"  \"I hef done so, tree time already--I done so again once more.\"  And, without ado, the young German threw himself forward on his hands and head and kicked his feet with a vigor that sent the moisture in every direction.  Indeed the performance was conducted with so much ardor that one of the shoes flow off with considerable violence.  Otto then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6906"],["title","The Lost Trail (#3)"],["body","himself and assumed the upright posture.  \"Mine gracious,\" he exclaimed, \"where didn't dot shoe of mine went?\"  \"It just missed my face,\" replied Jack, with a laugh.  \"Dot vos lucky,\" said Otto, beginning to search for his property.  \"Yes; it might have hurt me pretty bad.\"  \"I means it vos lucky for de shoe,\" added Otto, who, in groping about, stumbled at that moment upon the missing article.  \"Bime by de vater soaks down mine shoes agin and I stands on head and kicks it out.\"  But Jack Carleton was anxious to learn what had befallen his friend since their voluntary separation some hours before, and so, while they were advancing along the shore, the story was told.  Otto, as he had agreed to do, was riding at a leisurely pace, when, without the least warning, the sharp crack of a rifle broke the stillness of, the woods on his right, and the bullet zipped so close to his forehead that it literally grazed the skin, leaving a faint mark, which was visible several days afterward.  The lad was never so frightened in all his life.  For a minute or so he was absolutely speechless, during which the horse, alarmed in a less degree than he, broke into a trot.  Otto, however, quickly regained his self-control, and fully realized his danger.  He did not glance behind him nor to the right or left.  No investigation was needed convince him of his peril.  He put the horse to a dead run, first throwing himself forward on his neck so as to offer the least possible target to his enemies.  Only the single shot was fired, and Jack counted it strange that the report failed to reach his ears.  When the fugitive had gone a considerable distance, he ventured to look back.  He thought he saw several Indians, but it was probably fancy, for had they observed he was leaving them behind (as would have been the case), they surely would have appealed to their rifles again.  Otto was in such danger from the overhanging limbs, and was so fearful that he was running a gauntlet of Indians, that he kept his head close to the mane of his steed and scarcely looked to see where they were going.  The awakening came like an electric shock, when the terrified horse made a tremendous plunge straight out into the river.  The first notice Otto received was the chilling embrace of the waters which enveloped him to the ears.  He held his rifle in his right hand, and, in his desperate efforts to save that, was swept from the back of the animal, which began swimming composedly down stream, carrying saddle, blankets and other valuable articles that were strapped to him back.  Encumbered with his heavy clothing and his gun, young Otto Relstaub had all he could do to fight his way back to land.  He escaped shipwreck as by a hair's-breadth, from the sawyer which had attracted the notice of Jack.  \"I vos swimming as hard as nefer vos,\" he explained, \"and had just got in front of the tree, ven as true as I don't live, it banged right down on top mit me and nearly knocked out my brains out.  I grabbed hold of it, when it raised up and frowed me over its head. Den I gots mad and swims ashore.\"  Jack laughed, for, though he knew his friend was prone to exaggeration, he could understand that his experience was similar, in many respects, to what he had stated.  \"After the shore reaches me,\" continued Otto, \"I turns around free, four times to find where I ain't.  I see de colt going down stream as fast as if two Indians was on his back sitting and paddling him mit paddles.  I called to him to come back and explained dot he would cotch him cold if he didn't stay too long in de vater, but he makes belief he don't hears me, and I bothers him no more.\"  \"There will be trouble at home when your father finds out the colt is lost,\" said Jack Carleton, who knew how harsh the parent of Otto was; \"it must be he returned to land further down.\"  \"Yes; bimeby he comes ashore.\"  \"Why didn't you recover him?\"  \"'Cause he swims out on de oder side and he would not wait till I could go back mit de settlements and got mine frens to come and build one boat.  I vos gone so long dot it vos night ven I comes back, and ven I sees you I dinks you vos an Indian or maybe some other loafer.\"  Jack Carleton was about to reply to this remark when both he and his friend caught sight the same moment of the star-like twinkle of a point of light.  While there was nothing specially noteworthy in this, yet both were impressed by the fact that the light was not only on the river, but was serving as a signal to some one standing on the same shore with them.     CHAPTER IV  THE VISITOR FROM THE OTHER SHORE   Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub saw the twinkling point of light, glowing like a star from the bank of darkness on the other side the Mississippi.  It shone for a minute with an intense brightness, and then, to their amazement, began revolving in a circle of a foot or more in diameter.  It sped round and round with such swiftness that it resembled a wheel of fire without the slightest break in the flaming periphery.  \"What can it mean?\" asked the mystified Jack.  \"I vos told something apout afire dot vos to jump apout in one circle,\" was the remarkable statement of Otto.  \"What was it?\"  \"I don't forgot him now,\" replied the German with the hesitating speech of one in doubt.  \"Well, you're the prize blockhead of the West,\" was the impatient comment of the young Kentuckian.  \"How you could have heard anything of that signal--as it must be--and forget it is beyond my understanding.\"  \"Dot's what I dinks.  I'll remember sometime after a few days--helloa!\"  His exclamation was caused by the blotting out of the circular fire which had caused so much speculation.  Looking toward the western bank of the Mississippi all was darkness again, the light having vanished.  Jack stooped so as to bring his head on a level with the surface of the river, and peered intently out over the moonlit surface.  \"That torch was waved by an Indian in a canoe,\" said he, in a low voice, \"and he is paddling this way.\"  Otto imitated the action of his friend, and saw that he had spoken the truth.  The outlines of a boat, dimly distinguishable, were assuming definite shape with such rapidity that there could be no doubt the craft was approaching them.  As there was no question that the fiery ring was meant for a signal, Jack Carleton concluded that a party of red men were communicating with those from whom the boys had effected so narrow an escape. Such a supposition showed the necessity of great care, and the friends, without speaking, stepped further from the edge of the stream, where they were in no danger of being seen.  As the boat came nearer, and its shape was more clearly marked, the boys discovered that only a single warrior sat within.  He was in the stern, manipulating his long, ashen paddle with such rare skill that he seemed to pay no heed to the current at all.  \"There's only one of them,\" whispered the astonished Jack.  \"How easily we can pick him off!\"  Otto brought his gun to his shoulder.  \"What do you mean?\" demanded the angry Jack.  \"Pick him off!\"  \"No, you don't.  He may be a friend.\"  \"We'll found dot out, after we don't shoot him.  Let's shoot him first,\" was the suggestion of Otto, \"and then ax him the question.\"  \"Even if an enemy--as he undoubtedly is--it would be cowardly to slay him in that fashion.  As there is only one--!\"  \"Dere!\" exclaimed the young Teuton, hardly to suppress his excitement over the recollection; \"I knowed dat I had recumlected some dings.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Dot young gentleman in dot boat is a great friend of mine.  He told me he would meet me at the crossing, if I didn't reach him pefore till it was come dark.  Dot vos vat I didn't forget till de fire pegun to whirl apout, and then I didn't remember.\"  \"Who is he?\" asked the astonished Jack.  \"Deerfoot, the Shawanoe,\" was the reply of Otto, who, with a light heart, stepped closer to the edge of the swiftly flowing river and called out:  \"Holloa, Deerfoot!  How you vos?\"  The mention of the name called up strange emotions in the breast of Jack Carleton.  For a year previous, stories had reached the settlement where he had made his home, of the wonderful Shawanoe youth, who was captured when a child, and while he was as untameable in his hatred of the whites as a spitting wildcat, but who was transformed by kindness into the most devoted friend of the pioneers.  Ned Preston, who lived at Wild Oaks, nearly a hundred miles distant from Jack's home, visited the latter a few months before, while on a hunting excursion, with his colored friend Wild-blossom Brown, and it was from him that Jack had gained many particulars of the remarkable history of the young Shawanoe.  Jack credited the statements of Deerfoot's amazing skill in the use of his bow and arrow, his wonderful fleetness of foot, and his chivalrous devotion to his friends; but when told that the youth could not only read, but could write an excellent hand, and that he was a true Christian, Jack felt many misgivings of the truth of the whole story.  Jack recalled further the statement that Deerfoot was held in such detestation by his own race that he became convinced his presence was an element of weakness rather than strength to his friends, and it was for that reason he had migrated west of the Mississippi.  The youthful warrior, seated in the stem of the canoe, gave no evidence that he saw the stubby figure of the German lad who stepped close to the water and hailed him by name.  One powerful impulse of the paddle sent the bark structure far up the bank, like the snout of some aquatic monster plunging after the lad awaiting it.  Before it came to rest, Deerfoot sprang lightly ashore, and, grasping the front of the boat, drew it still further from the river, where it was not only safe against being swept away, but could not be seen by any one passing in the neighborhood.  His next proceeding was to pick up his bow from the bottom of the canoe, after which he was prepared"]]]
