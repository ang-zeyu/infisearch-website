It was a breathless moment.  I heard the heart throbbing in my body, the very watch ticking in my pocket, and ever and anon the tinkle-tinkle of the skeleton key. Then--at last--there came a single unmistakable click.  In another minute the mahogany door and the iron gate yawned behind us; and Raffles was sitting on an office table, wiping his face, with the lantern throwing a steady beam by his side.  We were now in a bare and roomy lobby behind the shop, but separated therefrom by an iron curtain, the very sight of which filled me with despair. Raffles, however, did not appear in the least depressed, but hung up his coat and hat on some pegs in the lobby before examining this curtain with his lantern.  \"That's nothing,\" said he, after a minute's inspection; \"we'll be through that in no time, but there's a door on the other side which may give us trouble.\"  \"Another door!\" I groaned.  \"And how do you mean to tackle this thing?\"  \"Prise it up with the jointed jimmy.  The weak point of these iron curtains is the leverage you can get from below.  But it makes a noise, and this is where you're coming in, Bunny; this is where I couldn't do without you.  I must have you overhead to knock through when the street's clear. I'll come with you and show a light.\"  Well, you may imagine how little I liked the prospect of this lonely vigil; and yet there was something very stimulating in the vital responsibility which it involved.  Hitherto I had been a mere spectator.  Now I was to take part in the game. And the fresh excitement made me more than ever insensible to those considerations of conscience and of safety which were already as dead nerves in my breast.  So I took my post without a murmur in the front room above the shop. The fixtures had been left for the refusal of the incoming tenant, and fortunately for us they included Venetian blinds which were already down.  It was the simplest matter in the world to stand peeping through the laths into the street, to beat twice with my foot when anybody was approaching, and once when all was clear again.  The noises that even I could hear below, with the exception of one metallic crash at the beginning, were indeed incredibly slight; but they ceased altogether at each double rap from my toe; and a policeman passed quite half a dozen times beneath my eyes, and the man whom I took to be the jeweller's watchman oftener still, during the better part of an hour that I spent at the window.  Once, indeed, my heart was in my mouth, but only once. It was when the watchman stopped and peered through the peep-hole into the lighted shop.  I waited for his whistle--I waited for the gallows or the gaol!  But my signals had been studiously obeyed, and the man passed on in undisturbed serenity.  In the end I had a signal in my turn, and retraced my steps with lighted matches, down the broad stairs, down the narrow ones, across the area, and up into the lobby where Raffles awaited me with an outstretched hand.  \"Well done, my boy!\" said he.  \"You're the same good man in a pinch, and you shall have your reward.  I've got a thousand pounds' worth if I've got a penn'oth.  It's all in my pockets.  And here's something else I found in this locker; very decent port and some cigars, meant for poor dear Danby's business friends.  Take a pull, and you shall light up presently.  I've found a lavatory, too, and we must have a wash-and-brush-up before we go, for I'm as black as your boot.\"  The iron curtain was down, but he insisted on raising it until I could peep through the glass door on the other side and see his handiwork in the shop beyond.  Here two electric lights were left burning all night long, and in their cold white rays I could at first see nothing amiss. I looked along an orderly lane, an empty glass counter on my left, glass cupboards of untouched silver on my right, and facing me the filmy black eye of the peep-hole that shone like a stage moon on the street.  The counter had not been emptied by Raffles; its contents were in the Chubb's safe, which he had given up at a glance; nor had he looked at the silver, except to choose a cigarette case for me.  He had confined himself entirely to the shop window.  This was in three compartments, each secured for the night by removable panels with separate locks. Raffles had removed them a few hours before their time, and the electric light shone on a corrugated shutter bare as the ribs of an empty carcase.  Every article of value was gone from the one place which was invisible from the little window in the door; elsewhere all was as it had been left overnight. And but for a train of mangled doors behind the iron curtain, a bottle of wine and a cigar-box with which liberties had been taken, a rather black towel in the lavatory, a burnt match here and there, and our finger-marks on the dusty banisters, not a trace of our visit did we leave.  \"Had it in my head for long?\" said Raffles, as we strolled through the streets towards dawn, for all the world as though we were returning from a dance.  \"No, Bunny, I never thought of it till I saw that upper part empty about a month ago, and bought a few things in the shop to get the lie of the land.  That reminds me that I never paid for them; but, by Jove, I will to-morrow, and if that isn't poetic justice, what is?  One visit showed me the possibilities of the place, but a second convinced me of its impossibilities without a pal.  So I had practically given up the idea, when you came along on the very night and in the very plight for it!  But here we are at the Albany, and I hope there's some fire left; for I don't know how you feel, Bunny, but for my part I'm as cold as Keats's owl.\"  He could think of Keats on his way from a felony!  He could hanker for his fireside like another!  Floodgates were loosed within me, and the plain English of our adventure rushed over me as cold as ice.  Raffles was a burglar.  I had helped him to commit one burglary, therefore I was a burglar, too.  Yet I could stand and warm myself by his fire, and watch him empty his pockets, as though we had done nothing wonderful or wicked!  My blood froze.  My heart sickened.  My brain whirled.  How I had liked this villain!  How I had admired him!  Now my liking and admiration must turn to loathing and disgust.  I waited for the change.  I longed to feel it in my heart.  But--I longed and I waited in vain!  I saw that he was emptying his pockets; the table sparkled with their hoard.  Rings by the dozen, diamonds by the score; bracelets, pendants, aigrettes, necklaces, pearls, rubies, amethysts, sapphires; and diamonds always, diamonds in everything, flashing bayonets of light, dazzling me--blinding me--making me disbelieve because I could no longer forget.  Last of all came no gem, indeed, but my own revolver from an inner pocket. And that struck a chord.  I suppose I said something--my hand flew out.  I can see Raffles now, as he looked at me once more with a high arch over each clear eye.  I can see him pick out the cartridges with his quiet, cynical smile, before he would give me my pistol back again.  \"You mayn't believe it, Bunny,\" said he, \"but I never carried a loaded one before.  On the whole I think it gives one confidence.  Yet it would be very awkward if anything went wrong; one might use it, and that's not the game at all, though I have often thought that the murderer who has just done the trick must have great sensations before things get too hot for him.  Don't look so distressed, my dear chap. I've never had those sensations, and I don't suppose I ever shall.\"  \"But this much you have done before?\" said I hoarsely.  \"Before?  My dear Bunny, you offend me!  Did it look like a first attempt?  Of course I have done it before.\"  \"Often?\"  \"Well--no!  Not often enough to destroy the charm, at all events; never, as a matter of fact, unless I'm cursedly hard up.  Did you hear about the Thimbleby diamonds?  Well, that was the last time--and a poor lot of paste they were.  Then there was the little business of the Dormer house-boat at Henley last year.  That was mine also--such as it was.  I've never brought off a really big coup yet; when I do I shall chuck it up.\"  Yes, I remembered both cases very well.  To think that he was their author!  It was incredible, outrageous, inconceivable.  Then my eyes would fall upon the table, twinkling and glittering in a hundred places, and incredulity was at an end.  \"How came you to begin?\" I asked, as curiosity overcame mere wonder, and a fascination for his career gradually wove itself into my fascination for the man.  \"Ah! that's a long story,\" said Raffles.  \"It was in the Colonies, when I was out there playing cricket.  It's too long a story to tell you now, but I was in much the same fix that you were in to-night, and it was my only way out.  I never meant it for anything more; but I'd tasted blood, and it was all over with me.  Why should I work when I could steal?  Why settle down to some humdrum uncongenial billet, when excitement, romance, danger and a decent living were all going begging together?  Of course it's very wrong, but we can't all be moralists, and the distribution of wealth is very wrong to begin with.  Besides, you're not at it all the time.  I'm sick of quoting Gilbert's lines to myself, but they're profoundly true.  I only wonder if you'll like the life as much as I do!\"  \"Like it?\" I cried out.  \"Not I!  It's no life for me.  Once is enough!\"  \"You wouldn't give me a hand another time?\"  \"Don't ask me, Raffles.  Don't ask me, for God's sake!\"  \"Yet you said you would do anything for me! You asked me to name my crime!  But I knew at the time you didn't mean it; you didn't go back on me to-night, and that ought to satisfy me, goodness knows!  I suppose I'm ungrateful, and unreasonable, and all that.  I ought to let it end at this.  But you're the very man for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/706"],["title","The Amateur Cracksman (#4)"],["body","e, Bunny, the--very--man! Just think how we got through to-night.  Not a scratch--not a hitch! There's nothing very terrible in it, you see; there never would be, while we worked together.\"  He was standing in front of me with a hand on either shoulder; he was smiling as he knew so well how to smile.  I turned on my heel, planted my elbows on the chimney-piece, and my burning head between my hands. Next instant a still heartier hand had fallen on my back.  \"All right, my boy!  You are quite right and I'm worse than wrong. I'll never ask it again. Go, if you want to, and come again about mid-day for the cash.  There was no bargain; but, of course, I'll get you out of your scrape--especially after the way you've stood by me to-night.\"  I was round again with my blood on fire.  \"I'll do it again,\" I said, through my teeth.  He shook his head.  \"Not you,\" he said, smiling quite good-humoredly on my insane enthusiasm.  \"I will,\" I cried with an oath.  \"I'll lend you a hand as often as you like!  What does it matter now?  I've been in it once.  I'll be in it again.  I've gone to the devil anyhow.  I can't go back, and wouldn't if I could.  Nothing matters another rap!  When you want me, I'm your man!\"  And that is how Raffles and I joined felonious forces on the Ides of March.    A COSTUME PIECE  London was just then talking of one whose name is already a name and nothing more. Reuben Rosenthall had made his millions on the diamond fields of South Africa, and had come home to enjoy them according to his lights; how he went to work will scarcely be forgotten by any reader of the halfpenny evening papers, which revelled in endless anecdotes of his original indigence and present prodigality, varied with interesting particulars of the extraordinary establishment which the millionaire set up in St.  John's Wood.  Here he kept a retinue of Kaffirs, who were literally his slaves; and hence he would sally, with enormous diamonds in his shirt and on his finger, in the convoy of a prize-fighter of heinous repute, who was not, however, by any means the worst element in the Rosenthall mélange.  So said common gossip; but the fact was sufficiently established by the interference of the police on at least one occasion, followed by certain magisterial proceedings which were reported with justifiable gusto and huge headlines in the newspapers aforesaid.  And this was all one knew of Reuben Rosenthall up to the time when the Old Bohemian Club, having fallen on evil days, found it worth its while to organize a great dinner in honor of so wealthy an exponent of the club's principles.  I was not at the banquet myself, but a member took Raffles, who told me all about it that very night.  \"Most extraordinary show I ever went to in my life,\" said he.  \"As for the man himself--well, I was prepared for something grotesque, but the fellow fairly took my breath away.  To begin with, he's the most astounding brute to look at, well over six feet, with a chest like a barrel, and a great hook-nose, and the reddest hair and whiskers you ever saw.  Drank like a fire-engine, but only got drunk enough to make us a speech that I wouldn't have missed for ten pounds.  I'm only sorry you weren't there, too, Bunny, old chap.\"  I began to be sorry myself, for Raffles was anything but an excitable person, and never had I seen him so excited before.  Had he been following Rosenthall's example?  His coming to my rooms at midnight, merely to tell me about his dinner, was in itself enough to excuse a suspicion which was certainly at variance with my knowledge of A. J. Raffles.  \"What did he say?\" I inquired mechanically, divining some subtler explanation of this visit, and wondering what on earth it could be.  \"Say?\" cried Raffles.  \"What did he not say!  He boasted of his rise, he bragged of his riches, and he blackguarded society for taking him up for his money and dropping him out of sheer pique and jealousy because he had so much.  He mentioned names, too, with the most charming freedom, and swore he was as good a man as the Old Country had to show--PACE the Old Bohemians. To prove it he pointed to a great diamond in the middle of his shirt-front with a little finger loaded with another just like it: which of our bloated princes could show a pair like that?  As a matter of fact, they seemed quite wonderful stones, with a curious purple gleam to them that must mean a pot of money.  But old Rosenthall swore he wouldn't take fifty thousand pounds for the two, and wanted to know where the other man was who went about with twenty-five thousand in his shirt-front and another twenty-five on his little finger. He didn't exist.  If he did, he wouldn't have the pluck to wear them.  But _he_ had--he'd tell us why. And before you could say Jack Robinson he had whipped out a whacking great revolver!\"  \"Not at the table?\"  \"At the table!  In the middle of his speech!  But it was nothing to what he wanted to do.  He actually wanted us to let him write his name in bullets on the opposite wall, to show us why he wasn't afraid to go about in all his diamonds!  That brute Purvis, the prize-fighter, who is his paid bully, had to bully his master before he could be persuaded out of it.  There was quite a panic for the moment; one fellow was saying his prayers under the table, and the waiters bolted to a man.\"  \"What a grotesque scene!\"  \"Grotesque enough, but I rather wish they had let him go the whole hog and blaze away.  He was as keen as knives to show us how he could take care of his purple diamonds; and, do you know, Bunny, _I_ was as keen as knives to see.\"  And Raffles leaned towards me with a sly, slow smile that made the hidden meaning of his visit only too plain to me at last.  \"So you think of having a try for his diamonds yourself?\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  \"It is horribly obvious, I admit.  But--yes, I have set my heart upon them!  To be quite frank, I have had them on my conscience for some time; one couldn't hear so much of the man, and his prize-fighter, and his diamonds, without feeling it a kind of duty to have a go for them; but when it comes to brandishing a revolver and practically challenging the world, the thing becomes inevitable.  It is simply thrust upon one. I was fated to hear that challenge, Bunny, and I, for one, must take it up.  I was only sorry I couldn't get on my hind legs and say so then and there.\"  \"Well,\" I said, \"I don't see the necessity as things are with us; but, of course, I'm your man.\"  My tone may have been half-hearted.  I did my best to make it otherwise.  But it was barely a month since our Bond Street exploit, and we certainly could have afforded to behave ourselves for some time to come.  We had been getting along so nicely: by his advice I had scribbled a thing or two; inspired by Raffles, I had even done an article on our own jewel robbery; and for the moment I was quite satisfied with this sort of adventure.  I thought we ought to know when we were well off, and could see no point in our running fresh risks before we were obliged.  On the other hand, I was anxious not to show the least disposition to break the pledge that I had given a month ago. But it was not on my manifest disinclination that Raffles fastened.  \"Necessity, my dear Bunny?  Does the writer only write when the wolf is at the door?  Does the painter paint for bread alone?  Must you and I be DRIVEN to crime like Tom of Bow and Dick of Whitechapel?  You pain me, my dear chap; you needn't laugh, because you do.  Art for art's sake is a vile catchword, but I confess it appeals to me. In this case my motives are absolutely pure, for I doubt if we shall ever be able to dispose of such peculiar stones.  But if I don't have a try for them--after to-night--I shall never be able to hold up my head again.\"  His eye twinkled, but it glittered, too.  \"We shall have our work cut out,\" was all I said.  \"And do you suppose I should be keen on it if we hadn't?\" cried Raffles.  \"My dear fellow, I would rob St. Paul's Cathedral if I could, but I could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasn't looking than I could bag the apples out of an old woman's basket.  Even that little business last month was a sordid affair, but it was necessary, and I think its strategy redeemed it to some extent. Now there's some credit, and more sport, in going where they boast they're on their guard against you.  The Bank of England, for example, is the ideal crib; but that would need half a dozen of us with years to give to the job; and meanwhile Reuben Rosenthall is high enough game for you and me.  We know he's armed.  We know how Billy Purvis can fight.  It'll be no soft thing, I grant you. But what of that, my good Bunny--what of that?  A man's reach must exceed his grasp, dear boy, or what the dickens is a heaven for?\"  \"I would rather we didn't exceed ours just yet,\" I answered laughing, for his spirit was irresistible, and the plan was growing upon me, despite my qualms.  \"Trust me for that,\" was his reply; \"I'll see you through.  After all I expect to find that the difficulties are nearly all on the surface. These fellows both drink like the devil, and that should simplify matters considerably.  But we shall see, and we must take our time. There will probably turn out to be a dozen different ways in which the thing might be done, and we shall have to choose between them.  It will mean watching the house for at least a week in any case; it may mean lots of other things that will take much longer; but give me a week and I will tell you more.  That's to say, if you're really on?\"  \"Of course I am,\" I replied indignantly.  \"But why should I give you a week?  Why shouldn't we watch the house together?\"  \"Because two eyes are as good as four and take up less room.  Never hunt in couples unless you're obliged.  But don't you look offended, Bunny; there'll be plenty for you to do when the time comes, that I promise you.  You shall have your share of the fun, never fear, and a purple"]]]
