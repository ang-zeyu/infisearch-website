[Footnote: Colonel O. M. Poe, in \"Century War Book,\" vol. iii. p. 737.]  Knoxville was so situated that its outline was a sort of parallelogram of high ground, averaging a hundred and fifty feet or more above the river which ran along the town on the south. Two creeks ran through the town in little valleys, and in the northern suburbs where the land was much lower than the town it had been practicable, by damming these streams to make inundations which covered a considerable part of the northern front and added very materially to the defences. At the four corners of the parallelogram, enclosed works had been planned for use by a small garrison, and these had been partly constructed. Captain Poe, the chief engineer, had staked out infantry lines connecting these forts, with epaulements for artillery at intervals, and work had been hastened during the days from the 13th of November, as soon as Burnside's plan of holding the city had been approved. When the troops approached the city on the morning of the 17th, the position for every brigade and every battery had been assigned, and officers were in waiting to lead each to its place. All the infantry was put in line except Reilly's brigade of the Twenty-third Corps, which was placed in reserve in the streets of the town. [Footnote: Poe's Report, Official Records, vol. xxxi. pt. i. p. 295.]  The most important of the forts was at the northwest angle of the works, upon a commanding hill. It was afterward called Fort Sanders in honor of the cavalry commander who lost his life in front of its western face. This work was planned as approximately a square with sides of about a hundred yards and bastions at the corners. The eastern front had not been completed, and was now left entirely open, as the northern face connected with the infantry trench. The ditch was twelve feet wide and about eight deep, and the parapet was about twelve feet high, making its crest about twenty feet above the bottom of the ditch. The berme usually left between the bottom of the parapet slope and the ditch was cut away so as to leave no level standing-place at the top of the scarp. This was the work which Longstreet afterward assaulted. Its chief defect was due to the situation and the contour of the ground around, which made its position so prominent a salient in the lines that the flanking fire was necessarily imperfect, leaving a considerable sector without fire beyond the angle of the northwest bastion. The point of the bastion was truncated, and a single gun put in the _pan coup√©_. The three other forts were less elaborate but of similar profile.  As soon as the infantry took position, the men were set industriously to work to strengthen the defences. The first infantry trench between the forts had been a mere rifle-pit two and one half feet deep with the earth heaped in front as it was thrown out, to raise a parapet. Every hour made the line stronger, and work on it was continued till nearly every part of it was a good cover against artillery fire. The critical time was during the 18th of November, when as yet there was practically no cover between the forts. The cavalry was ordered to oppose the most determined resistance to the establishment of close investing lines by the enemy, and Sanders set his men a most inspiring example. He was a classmate of Captain Poe at West Point, and on the night of the 17th he shared Poe's blanket. Before dawn he went to the front, and passed from one to another of the little barricades held by his dismounted troopers. The Confederates increased the vigor of their attacks, and if any of our men were driven back by the hot fire, Sanders would walk deliberately up to the rail-pile and stand erect and exposed till his men rallied to him. For hours he did this, and his life seemed to be charmed, but about the middle of the afternoon he was mortally wounded, and the screen he had so resolutely interposed between the enemy and our infantry digging in the trenches was rolled aside. [Footnote: Paper by General Poe in \"Century War Book,\" vol. iii. p. 737.] The time thus gained had been precious, though it was bought at so high a price. The lines were already safe against a _coup de main_. [Footnote: Poe's Report, Official Records, vol. xxxi. pt. i. p. 296.]  Longstreet's principal lines were north of Knoxville beyond the railway and the station buildings. He also occupied a line of hills, but pushed forward strong skirmish lines and detachments to cover the making of intrenchments closer to the town. There were frequent bickering combats, but no general engagement. The enemy made efforts to destroy the pontoon bridge by sending down logs and rafts from above. These were met by an iron cable boom stretched across the river above the bridge, borne on wooden floats to keep it at the surface. [Footnote: Century War Book, vol. iii. p. 739.] Several efforts were made to drive Burnside's men from the hills covering the town on the south side of the river, but they were defeated, and communication was kept up with the valley of the French Broad River, and supplies enough were brought in to make it certain that Burnside could not be starved out, although the rations were reduced to the smallest quantity and the fewest elements which would support life.  A week passed thus, Burnside being shut off from all communication with the outer world. The 25th of November came with the almost miraculous storming of Missionary Ridge by the army under Grant at Chattanooga. Bragg retreated southward and Longstreet had no longer a possibility of rejoining him. Yet Burnside knew nothing of it, and did not dream of the more than complete justification his slow defensive campaign was having, in the tout and demoralization of the Confederate army in Georgia in Longstreet's absence. The latter was now forced to attack the fortifications or to raise the siege of Knoxville. He knew, at least by rumor, what Burnside was ignorant of,--not only the defeat of Bragg, but that a force was already moving from Grant's army to the relief of Knoxville. Bragg had also sent to him a staff officer with exhortations to prompt action. For a day or two Longstreet tried to attract Burnside's attention to the south of the river and to other parts of the lines, and then on the 28th prepared a desperate assault upon the great salient of Fort Sanders.  The artillery in the fort was under the command of Lieutenant Samuel N. Benjamin, Second U. S. Artillery, whose battery of twenty-pounder Parrotts had done good service at South Mountain and Antietam. The infantry was of Ferrero's division of the Ninth Corps. There was a slight abatis in front of the fort, and on the suggestion of Mr. Hoxie, an officer of the railway, some old telegraph wire left at the depot was used by Captain Poe to make an entanglement by fastening it between small stumps of a grove which had been felled along the slope northwest of the bastion at the salient. Longstreet's plan of assault was to attack the northwest angle of the fort with two columns of regiments, consisting of Wofford's and Humphrey's brigades of McLaws's division. Anderson's brigade was to attack the infantry trench a little east of the fort. Longstreet's instructions were to make the assault at break of day on the 29th. The columns were to move silently and swiftly without firing and endeavor to carry the parapet by the bayonet. [Footnote: Longstreet's Report, Official Records, vol. xxxi. pt. i. p. 461.] The determined advance of the enemy's rifle pits by his skirmishers in the night of the 28th gave warning of what was to be expected. The morning of the 29th was damp and foggy, but the watchful pickets detected the formation of the enemy's columns. About six o'clock the Confederate batteries opened a heavy fire on the fort, which did not reply, ammunition being too precious to be wasted. In about twenty minutes the cannonade ceased and the columns moved to the assault. The fire of our lines was concentrated upon them, and they lost heavily; but they kept on, somewhat disordered by the entanglement as well as by their losses, and came to the ditch. No doubt its depth and the high face of the parapet surprised them, for they had no scaling ladders. They jumped into the ditch and tried to scramble up the slope of the earthwork. Some got to the top, only to be shot down or captured. The guns flanking the ditch raked it with double charges of canister. Shells were lighted and thrown as hand-grenades into the practically helpless crowd below. Those who had not entered the ditch soon wavered and fell back, at first sullenly and slowly, then in despair running for life to cover. Those who remained and could walk surrendered and were marched to the southwest angle of the fort, where they were brought within the lines.  The remnants of the broken columns were rallied behind their outer lines, but no effort was made to renew the assault. They had done all that was possible for flesh and blood. The casualties in the assault had been about 1000, whilst within the fortifications only 13 killed and wounded were reported. [Footnote: Official Records, vol. xxxi. pt. i. pp. 277, 278, 344, 461, 487, 490, 519, 520.] Buckner's division had joined Longstreet a day or two before the assault, but took no active part in it. Their absence from Missionary Ridge still further reduced Bragg's army, whilst it did not give to Longstreet any practical benefit. The division of the Confederate forces had thus proved to be a great military mistake. Its only chance had been in a swift attack upon Burnside and a prompt return, and this chance had vanished with the delays in the railroad transportation of Longstreet's men to Sweetwater. Prudence dictated that the expedition should be abandoned on the 13th of November; but the fear of seeming vacillating, a weakness of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/697"],["title","The Light Princess (#0)"],["body","LIGHT PRINCESS   by  GEORGE MACDONALD    Contents     1.

What! No Children?   Once upon a time, so long ago that I have quite forgotten the date, there lived a king and queen who had no children.  And the king said to himself, \"All the queens of my acquaintance have children, some three, some seven, and some as many as twelve; and my queen has not one.  I feel ill-used.\"  So he made up his mind to be cross with his wife about it.  But she bore it all like a good patient queen as she was.  Then the king grew very cross indeed.  But the queen pretended to take it all as a joke, and a very good one too.  \"Why don't you have any daughters, at least?\" said he.  \"I don't say sons; that might be too much to expect.\"  \"I am sure, dear king, I am very sorry,\" said the queen.  \"So you ought to be,\" retorted the king; \"you are not going to make a virtue of that, surely.\"  But he was not an ill-tempered king, and in any matter of less moment would have let the queen have her own way with all his heart.  This, however, was an affair of state.  The queen smiled.  \"You must have patience with a lady, you know, dear king,\" said she.  She was, indeed, a very nice queen, and heartily sorry that she could not oblige the king immediately.    2.  Won't I, Just?  The king tried to have patience, but he succeeded very badly.  It was more than he deserved, therefore, when, at last, the queen gave him a daughter--as lovely a little princess as ever cried.  The day drew near when the infant must be christened.  The king wrote all the invitations with his own hand.  Of course somebody was forgotten.  Now it does not generally matter if somebody is forgotten, only you must mind who.  Unfortunately, the king forgot without intending to forget; and so the chance fell upon the Princess Makemnoit, which was awkward.  For the princess was the king's own sister; and he ought not to have forgotten her.  But she had made herself so disagreeable to the old king, their father, that he had forgotten her in making his will; and so it was no wonder that her brother forgot her in writing his invitations.  But poor relations don't do anything to keep you in mind of them.  Why don't they?  The king could not see into the garret she lived in, could he?  She was a sour, spiteful creature.  The wrinkles of contempt crossed the wrinkles of peevishness, and made her face as full of wrinkles as a pat of butter.  If ever a king could be justified in forgetting anybody, this king was justified in forgetting his sister, even at a christening.  She looked very odd, too.  Her forehead was as large as all the rest of her face, and projected over it like a precipice.  When she was angry, her little eyes flashed blue.  When she hated anybody, they shone yellow and green.  What they looked like when she loved anybody, I do not know; for I never heard of her loving anybody but herself, and I do not think she could have managed that if she had not somehow got used to herself.  But what made it highly imprudent in the king to forget her was that she was awfully clever.  In fact, she was a witch; and when she bewitched anybody, he very soon had enough of it; for she beat all the wicked fairies in wickedness, and all the clever ones in cleverness.  She despised all the modes we read of in history, in which offended fairies and witches have taken their revenges; and therefore, after waiting and waiting in vain for an invitation, she made up her mind at last to go without one, and make the whole family miserable, like a princess as she was.  So she put on her best gown, went to the palace, was kindly received by the happy monarch, who forgot that he had forgotten her, and took her place in the procession to the royal chapel.  When they were all gathered about the font, she contrived to get next to it, and throw something into the water; after which she maintained a very respectful demeanour till the water was applied to the child's face.  But at that moment she turned round in her place three times, and muttered the following words, loud enough for those beside her to hear:--    \"Light of spirit, by my charms,   Light of body, every part,   Never weary human arms--   Only crush thy parents' heart!\"   They all thought she had lost her wits, and was repeating some foolish nursery rhyme; but a shudder went through the whole of them notwithstanding.  The baby, on the contrary, began to laugh and crow; while the nurse gave a start and a smothered cry, for she thought she was struck with paralysis: she could not feel the baby in her arms. But she clasped it tight and said nothing.  The mischief was done.    3.  She Can't Be Ours.  Her atrocious aunt had deprived the child of all her gravity.  If you ask me how this was effected, I answer, \"In the easiest way in the world.  She had only to destroy gravitation.\"  For the princess was a philosopher, and knew all the ins and outs of the laws of gravitation as well as the ins and outs of her boot-lace.  And being a witch as well, she could abrogate those laws in a moment; or at least so clog their wheels and rust their bearings, that they would not work at all. But we have more to do with what followed than with how it was done.  The first awkwardness that resulted from this unhappy privation was, that the moment the nurse began to float the baby up and down, she flew from her arms towards the ceiling.  Happily, the resistance of the air brought her ascending career to a close within a foot of it.  There she remained, horizontal as when she left her nurse's arms, kicking and laughing amazingly.  The nurse in terror flew to the bell, and begged the footman, who answered it, to bring up the house-steps directly. Trembling in every limb, she climbed upon the steps, and had to stand upon the very top, and reach up, before she could catch the floating tail of the baby's long clothes.  When the strange fact came to be known, there was a terrible commotion in the palace.  The occasion of its discovery by the king was naturally a repetition of the nurse's experience.  Astonished that he felt no weight when the child was laid in his arms, he began to wave her up and not down, for she slowly ascended to the ceiling as before, and there remained floating in perfect comfort and satisfaction, as was testified by her peals of tiny laughter.  The king stood staring up in speechless amazement, and trembled so that his beard shook like grass in the wind. At last, turning to the queen, who was just as horror-struck as himself, he said, gasping, staring, and stammering,--  \"She can't be ours, queen!\"  Now the queen was much cleverer than the king, and had begun already to suspect that \"this effect defective came by cause.\"  \"I am sure she is ours,\" answered she.  \"But we ought to have taken better care of her at the christening.  People who were never invited ought not to have been present.\"  \"Oh, ho!\" said the king, tapping his forehead with his forefinger, \"I have it all.  I've found her out.  Don't you see it, queen?  Princess Makemnoit has bewitched her.\" \"That's just what I say,\" answered the queen.  \"I beg your pardon, my love; I did not hear you.--John! bring the steps I get on my throne with.\"  For he was a little king with a great throne, like many other kings.  The throne-steps were brought, and set upon the dining-table, and John got upon the top of them.  But he could not reach the little princess, who lay like a baby-laughter-cloud in the air, exploding continuously. \"Take the tongs, John,\" said his Majesty; and getting up on the table, he handed them to him.  John could reach the baby now, and the little princess was handed down by the tongs.    4.  Where Is She?  One fine summer day, a month after these her first adventures, during which time she had been very carefully watched, the princess was lying on the bed in the queen's own chamber, fast asleep.  One of the windows was open, for it was noon, and the day was so sultry that the little girl was wrapped in nothing less ethereal than slumber itself.  The queen came into the room, and not observing that the baby was on the bed, opened another window.  A frolicsome fairy wind, which had been watching for a chance of mischief, rushed in at the one window, and taking its way over the bed where the child was lying, caught her up, and rolling and floating her along like a piece of flue, or a dandelion seed, carried her with it through the opposite window, and away.  The queen went down-stairs, quite ignorant of the loss she had herself occasioned.  When the nurse returned, she supposed that her Majesty had carried her off, and, dreading a scolding, delayed making inquiry about her.  But hearing nothing, she grew uneasy, and went at length to the queen's boudoir, where she found her Majesty.  \"Please, your Majesty, shall I take the baby?\" said she.  \"Where is she?\" asked the queen.  \"Please forgive me.  I know it was wrong.\"  \"What do you mean?\" said the queen, looking grave.  \"Oh! don't frighten me, your Majesty!\" exclaimed the nurse, clasping her hands.  The queen saw that something was amiss, and fell down in a faint.  The nurse rushed about the palace, screaming, \"My baby! my baby!\"  Every one ran to the queen's room.  But the queen could give no orders. They soon found out, however, that the princess was missing, and in a moment the palace was like a beehive in a garden; and in one minute more the queen was brought to herself by a great shout and a clapping of hands.  They had found the princess fast asleep under a rose-bush, to which the elvish little wind-puff had carried her, finishing its mischief by shaking a shower "]]]
