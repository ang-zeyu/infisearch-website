When he had finished, he said:  \"My brother would like to remember the words as Deerfoot has spoken them; Deerfoot will print them for him.\"  And drawing a species of red chalk from the same pocket which held the Bible, he wrote for several minutes on one of the fly-leaves of the bock.  When he had finished he glanced over the words, carefully tore out the leaf and handed it across to Jack.  The latter examined the paper, and saw written in a fine, delicate hand the following words, which are preserved to this day, and which, when properly pronounced, constitute the Lord's Prayer as it has been uttered many a time by the dusky lips of the Shawanoe warrior, when his fiery nature was subdued by its blessed teachings:  \"Coe-thin-a, spim-i-key yea-taw-yan-ee, O wes-sa-yeg yey-sey-tho-yan-ae; Day-pale-i-tum-any-pay-itch tha-key, yea-issi-tay-hay-yon-ae, issi-nock-i-key, yoe-ma assis-key-kie pie-sey spin-I-key.

He did only fairly, even when corrected by Deerfoot, who added the rebuke:  \"Let my brother say them over many times in his own language, for the Great Spirit knows all tongues when he who speaks the words speaks them with his heart.\"  The consciousness that these words were uttered by one who belonged to what is generally regarded its a pagan race, brought a blush to the face of the sturdy youth that had listened to the same appeal more than once from the lips of his mother.  Under the assurance of Deerfoot, the boys stretched themselves on the leaves and branches and soon sunk into a refreshing slumber. Jack recalled that his last remembrance was of Deerfoot resting his head on his elbow, while he seemed absorbed in his book.  He lay as motionless as a figure in bronze, but no matter how much he might be enchained by the words, he could not be insensible of what was going on around him.  Both Jack and Otto slept until the light of morning was stealing through the woods.  Then, when they arose to their feet, they saw the Shawanoe broiling a couple of whitefish which he had managed to coax from the Mississippi.  He had almost finished before his friends suspected what was doing.  After greeting the warrior, the others passed through the woods to the margin of the mighty river, where they bathed their faces and hands, took a slight swallow of the somewhat muddy water and then rejoined Deerfoot, who had their breakfast ready.  \"Did my brothers see any signs that frightened them?\" asked Deerfoot, when the three had seated themselves on the ground and were partaking of their meal.  \"I took the best survey I could of the river,\" replied Jack, \"but saw nothing of friend or foe.  I don't suppose, as a rule, there are many Indians in this section.\"  \"The Shawanoes often hunt to the river, but do not cross; the Miamis come down from the north, and Deerfoot sees their footprints in the Woods.\"  \"What tribes are we likely to meet on the other side of the Mississippi?\" asked the young Kentuckian, who naturally felt much interest in the land wherein he expected to make his home.  \"There are many red men, even to the mountains which stretch far beyond the rivers and prairies, and raise their heads among the clouds.\"  Jack Carleton was surprised at this reference, which, he believed, was to the Rocky Mountains, of which little more than their simple existence was known to the rest of the Union at that day.  But the words which followed astonished him still more:  \"Beyond the mountains opens the great sea, wider than that which the pale faces came across from the Old World; beyond that great sea lies the land where He died for you and me; all the way to the shore, of the great water you will find the red men; they are like the leaves in the woods, and Deerfoot and his friends will die without ever hearing their names.\"  \"But you have spent some time on the other side the Mississippi, and must know something of your race there.\"  \"Deerfoot has seen the Osages hunting among the mountains and in the forest; has seen the Miamis, and, to the northward, may be met the Sacs and Foxes.  Far toward the ice of the North is the land of the Assiniboine and the Dacotah.\"  \"I should like to know where you gathered all that information?\" remarked the amazed Jack Carleton; \"the country beyond the Mississippi is greater than that on this side, and one of these days it will overflow with population, then what a country ours will be!\" exclaimed the young patriot, with kindling eye.  \"But you and I, Deerfoot, can never live to see that time, which is for those that come after us.\"  \"Yaw,\" said Otto, seeming to feel it his duty to say something; \"dere is enough land over dere, I 'spose, for that horse to hide a week before I don't catch him.\"  Jack intimated that he was likely to find his search extended beyond that time, while Deerfoot smiled over the simplicity of the lad, whose information was so small compared with his opportunities.  Conversing in this pleasant manner, the meal was soon finished, and they made ready to cross the river.  When the three emerged from the woods they were close to the swiftly flowing current.  Jack and Otto paused, while Deerfoot walked the few rods necessary to find the canoe that had been drawn up the bank.  Both the boys could swim the Mississippi if necessary, though, with their rifles and clothing to take care of, it was anything but a light task.  Had they been without any boat at command, they would have divested themselves of their garments and placed them and their \"luggage\" on it small float, while they swam behind and pushed it forward.  When the emigrants moved westward they halted long enough on the bank to construct a raft, sufficient to carry everything in the course of several trips back and forth.  Otto made preparation when he reached the river some days before on horseback, and, forcing the animal into the current, slipped back, grasped his tail and allowed himself to be towed across.  He might have done the same on the preceding day had he been given a few minutes in which to make preparation, and had he not been unwilling to leave his friend behind.  \"But it will beat all that,\" remarked Jack Carleton, after they had discussed the different plans, \"to be paddled over in the canoe of Deerfoot.\"  \"Yaw, but I dinks dot we should go across last, night.\"  \"What would we have gained by that?\"  \"Then we wouldn't have to go ober agin dis mornings.\"  \"True, but there is no haste called for; if it was not that I am so anxious to see mother, I would as lief spend a week on the road.\"  \"Dot wouldn't do for me, for mine fader would be looking for me wid two big gads to him--\"  \"Helloa!  Here comes Deerfoot.  What can be the matter?  He is excited over something.\"  Such was the fact, indeed, for the sagacious Shawanoe had made an annoying if not alarming discovery.     CHAPTER VII  A SURPRISED FISHERMAN   It may be said that Deerfoot the Shawanoe never lost his senses excepting when slumber stole them away.  Young as he was, he had been through some of the most terrific encounters the mind can conceive, and yet, when he stood erect in the full glare of the noonday sun, not a scratch or scar spoke of those fearful affrays in the depth of the forest, among the hills and mountains and along the Shores of the rivers of Kentucky and Ohio.  I have said that he was so hated by his own people that he felt his presence near the settlements to the eastward was more to the disadvantage than the help of his friends, and that was one of the causes which led him to bid adieu forever to his friends.  It has been intimated also that still another reason actuated him, and that reason shall appear in due time.  When Deerfoot assured Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub that they might slumber in peace, he spoke the truth; it has been shown that not the first breath of danger touched them during the darkness, and the morning meal was partaken in the same enjoyable fashion.  But before the subtle young Shawanoe reached the spot where he left his canoe, he was disturbed by discovering the imprint of moccasins along shore.  They led away from his friends and toward the canoe. A few minutes showed the latter had \"received\" some visitors since its owner left it.  It was utterly destroyed.  The knives and tomahawks of several, warriors had hacked be bark structure to pieces.  Even the paddle had been broken into a half dozen parts.  Nothing was left of which use could be made, the blanket of the owner of course being absent.  Deerfoot looked on the wreck with something like dismay, which speedily turned to anger.  The wantonness of the act roiled his feelings and stirred up the \"old Indian\" in his nature.  He surveyed the destruction for a minute or two, and then made a careful examination of the signs the perpetrators could not avoid leaving behind them.  There had been three Indiana engaged in the mischief, and the first supposition of Deerfoot was that they were the Shawanoes whom Jack Carleton saw the day previous; but a few minutes' study of the footprints betrayed a certain peculiarity (a slight turning outward of the left foot so slight, indeed, as almost to be imperceptible), which identified them as Miamis.  Deerfoot had noticed the \"sign manual\" years before, so there was no room for mistake on his part.  The party had come down from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6906"],["title","The Lost Trail (#7)"],["body","northward, most likely with other warriors, and had stumbled by mere chance upon the partially hidden canoe.  They probably investigated matters enough to learn that it was in charge of two white persons and one red one--enough to satisfy them that the single Indian was friendly to the settlers, and therefore one to be despised and harried in every way possible.  It was that discovery which undoubtedly caused them to destroy the property and steal the blanket.  They were not enough interested to seek the lives of the others, though it may be they were restrained by fear from doing so.  When Deerfoot came back to the boys, he purposely displayed some excitement in order to amuse them.  He quickly explained what he had learned, and then, in the most indifferent voice and manner, said \"The Miamis shall pay Deerfoot for his canoe.\"  \"How will you make them do that?\" asked Jack, who noticed the peculiar sparkle which the friends of the warrior always observed when his feelings were stirred.  \"I doesn't not believes dot you and dem cannot agrees mit de price,\" said Otto; \"derefore you sends for me and I tells you what de price ain't, and if dey don't agrees, den I knocks 'em ober de head--don't it?\"  \"Deerfoot will not need his brother,\" said the Indian, gravely; \"but he asks his brothers to wait till he comes back.\"  \"We'll do that,\" said Jack; \"that is, as long as there is a prospect of your return.  When shall we expect you?\"  \"Deerfoot will be with his brothers before the sun reaches yonder.\"  He pointed to the place in the sky which the orb would touch about the middle of the afternoon.  Then, warning the two to be very careful, and to keep continual watch against detection, he moved away, vanishing from sight in the woods behind them, instead of keeping close to the shore.  He wept to the southward until he once more reached the spot which contained the remains of his canoe.  He spent another minute in grimly surveying the ruins, and then, glancing down at the footprints, followed their direction.  He had determined to call the scamps to account for the injury done him.  As they belonged to the Miami tribe, it was quite likely they had a boat with them, though their hunting-grounds were east of the Mississippi, and possibly they had other property upon which the offended Shawanoe meant to levy.  He followed the trail for nearly a furlong, when it divided; two of the warriors turned to the left and went deeper into the woods, while the third continued down stream in the same general direction as before.  The sagacious Shawanoe suspected the truth; the single Indian had gone to look after a canoe or something which lay close to the river, while the others were about to engage in a hunt of so kind. The discovery pleased Deerfoot; for, beside indicating that there was a boat for him to take it showed that he had but a single red man to meet.  Within less than a hundred yards this solitary warrior was found.  A large canoe, evidently belonging to the three warriors, or possibly a larger party, lay against the bank, with one end on the land, while the other projected several yards into the river.  In the stern sat an Indian, after the fashion of a civilized man; he was astride of the end, his moccasins banging over, one on either side, his back toward shore, while he leaned forward and sleepily watched a fish-line, one end of which rested in his hand, while the other was far out in the Mississippi.  His attitude was as lazy and contented as though he were a white man.  It looked as if he had chosen the sport while his companions were off on a hunt that required more effort and exertion.  Deerfoot stood only a few seconds, when he smiled more fully than he had done for along time.  He saw his opportunity, and he proceeded straightway to \"improve\" it.  He stole forward, as quietly as a shadow, until he had gone the few yards intervening.  All that he feared was that the aboriginal fisherman might obtain a bite before the boat was reached.  If he could catch a fish on his bone hook, he would be likely to fling him into the canoe behind him and to turn himself around.  From the moment Deerfoot placed eyes on the motionless figure, he felt he was master of the situation; but, with his usual quickness, he had formed his plan and was desirous of carrying it out in spirit and in letter.  Reaching the canoe, he laid his long bow on the ground beside it; then, stooping over, he seized the gunwale with both hands and, quickly as the blow of a panther, he jerked the craft slightly more than a foot further up the bank.  The result was inevitable.  The astonished Miami sprawled forward from his seat and went down into the muddy Mississippi out of sight, doubtless frightening away the fish that was nibbling at his bait.  \"Hooh!\" he groaned, ejecting the water from his mouth as he came to view, and following it with an expression much in the nature of an expletive.  Only a couple of strokes were needed to bring him into the shallow water, when he rose to his feet and walked out upon dry land.  Up to that moment he did not know the cause of his mishap, for the author stooped down on the upper side of the craft; but as the Miami stepped out, Deerfoot rose to his full height, with his keen tomahawk grasped in his left hand--that being his best one.  The dripping warrior, to put it mildly, was astonished, when he found himself confronted by the stranger.  He stood staring and speechless, while the mouth of Deerfoot again expanded.  \"Does my brother's heart grow weary that he seeks to urge the fish to bite his hook before they are ready?\" asked the Shawanoe in the Miami tongue.  It was all clear to the victim, and, when he understood the trick that had been played upon him, his anger showed through the paint daubed on his face.  \"The Shawanoe is a fool,\" he replied.  \"His heart is filled with joy when he acts like a papoose.\"  \"But he will now act like a warrior,\" said Deerfoot, in a sterner manner.  \"The dogs of the Miamis broke the canoe of the Shawanoe and stole his blanket.\"  \"The Shawanoe is the friend of the white man,\" said the other with a sneer, though not without some misgiving, for, to use the language of the West, the young warrior \"had the drop on him.\"  He had only to make one movement in order to drive the glittering weapon through the skull of the Miami, as though it were mere card-board.  It must be confessed that he looked very much as if such was his intention.  \"Deerfoot is the friend of the white man,\" repeated the Shawanoe; \"he hoped to paddle them across the great river.  The Miami dogs have broken his canoe, so Deerfoot will take their boat.\"  The warrior showed that he was astounded by the daring of the youth. Within the canoe lay the blanket of Deerfoot, beside the rifle; powder-horn, and bullet pouch, doubtless owned by the moist fisherman.  The latter looked at his property as if he could not believe any one would dare molest that; but Deerfoot settled the question in his terse fashion.  \"Let the dog of a Miami seat himself on the ground like a squaw, and watch his Shawanoe master while he takes the canoe and all that it holds.\"  The Miami stared at his conqueror as if uncertain whether he had heard aright.  The conqueror enlightened him.  \"The dog of a Miami longs to go to the happy hunting-grounds of his fathers.\"  As he uttered the words, he quickly feinted with the hand grasping the tomahawk.  The warrior made such a sudden start to obey that his moccasins slipped on the wetter earth, his feet spread apart, as though he were learning to skate, and he sat down with such a sudden bump that it forced a grunt from him.  He hastily scrambled up, and, with a frightened glance over his shoulder, sprang forward and sat down again, though the last time was according to instructions.  It required all the self-restraint of Deerfoot to suppress his mirth over the ridiculous performance of his captive, if such he may be called.  When, the Miami seated himself with a grotesque effort at dignity, the Shawanoe placed his bow in the front of the canoe and then shoved the boat into the stream.  As it shot from the shore, he leaped in, and caught up one of the long three paddles with which it was navigated.  Dipping it beneath the surface he made one prodigious sweep, which drove the craft swiftly ahead.  While thus employed the Miami faithfully obeyed orders.  He sat immobile and silent, watching the daring young warrior making off not only with his private property, but with that which belonged to others.  The Miami must have thought to himself more than once--\"Ah, if my comrades would only appear at this moment!  They would make you change your tune very soon.\"  All at once the warrior uttered a whoop which plainly was meant as a signal to his friends.  Instantly Deerfoot laid down his paddle, and, catching up the gun, pointed it at the redskin.  The latter, in the extremity of his terror, turned a somersault backwards, and tumbled and scrambled into the woods, desperately striving to get beyond sight of the terrible youth who showed such recklessness in handling weapons.  No doubt the Miami believed his escape was a narrow one, when, the next instant, the rifle was discharged and the bullet cut through the leaves near his face.  And so, in truth, his escape was very narrow, but it was just as narrow as Deerfoot chose to make it.  He had not the remotest intention of injuring the Miami.     CHAPTER VIII  BEHIND THE TREE   The report of the gun reached the ears of Otto and Jack, and naturally caused them alarm.  They hurriedly made their way to the edge of the river and peered out from cover, not forgetting the warnings previously given by Deerfoot.  They had but to look a short distance down stream to see the Shawanoe paddling the large Indian canoe toward the other shore.  \"Well, dere!\" exclaimed Otto.  \"Deerfoot dinks as how I ain'ty forgotful, but don't he forget more than I does, when he dinks he has us in the"]]]
