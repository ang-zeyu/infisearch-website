After his arguments were exhausted he raised his voice louder. As usual, when excited by anger, he swung his lower right arm to and fro, feeling the prominent muscles with his left hand.  But Kuni remained resolute, and when be at last perceived that his opposition only increased her obstinacy, he exclaimed:  \"Then rush on to your destruction!  The day will come when you will see where you belong.  If only it doesn't arrive too late.  A man grows twelve and a woman thirty-six months older every year.\"  With these words he turned his back upon her, and the clown brought the amount of wages which was due.  Many an eye grew dim with tears when Kuni bade farewell to her companions.  Shortly after sunset she was welcomed to Frau Schurstab's house.  The first greeting was friendly, and she received nothing but kindness and indulgent treatment afterward.  She had a sunny chamber of her own, and how large and soft her bed was!  But while, when on the road with Loni's band, if they could reach no town, she had often slept soundly and sweetly on a heap of straw, here she spent one restless night after another.  During the first a series of questions disturbed her slumber.  Was it really only the desire to take her from her vagabond life which had induced Lienhard to open this house to her?  Did he not perhaps also cherish the wish to keep her near him?  He had certainly come to her with Frau Schurstab to protect her reputation.  Had it not been so he might have left the matron at home; for Loni and everybody in the company knew that she never troubled herself about gossip.  Last year she had obtained a leave of absence from Loni, who was making a tour of the little Frank towns, and spent the carnival season in revelry with a sergeant of the Nurembreg soldiers.  When the booty he had gained in Italy was squandered, she gave him his dismissal.  Her reputation among her companions was neither better nor worse than that of the other strolling players who, like her, were born on the highway, yet she was glad that Lienhard had tried to spare her.  Or had he only come with the old noblewoman on account of his own fair name?  Perhaps--her pulses again throbbed faster at the thought--he had not ventured to come alone because some feeling for her stirred in his own heart, and, spite of his beautiful young wife, he did not feel safe from her.  Then Fran Schurstab was to serve as a shield.  This conjecture flattered her vanity and reconciled her to the step which she had taken and already began to regret.  But suppose he really felt no more for her than the forester who finds a child lost in the woods, and guides it into the right path?  How would she endure that?  Yet, were it otherwise, if he was like the rest of men, if he profited by what her whole manner must betray to him, how should she face his wife, who undoubtedly would soon come to call on her aunt?  All these questions roused a tumult of unprecedented violence in her young, ardent, inexperienced soul, which was renewed each successive night.  It became more and more difficult for her to understand why she had left Loni's band and entered into relations for which she was not suited, and in which she could never, never be at ease or feel happy.  Nothing was lacking in this wealthy household, not even kindness and love.  Frau Sophia was indulgent and friendly, even when Kuni, whose heart and brain were occupied with so many other thoughts, neglected or forgot anything.  The matron's grandchildren, of whom she often had charge, soon became warmly attached to her.  While among the rope-dancers she had been fond of children, and many a little one who journeyed with the band held out its arms to her more joyously than to its own mother. There was something in her nature that attracted them.  Besides, her skilful hands could show them many a rare trick, and she could sing numerous songs new to the Schurstab boys and girls, which she had picked up here and there.  Then, too, she permitted many a prank which no one else would have allowed.  Her duties connected with the household linen and the poultry yard, its owner's pride, were so easily performed, that in her leisure hours she often voluntarily helped the housekeeper.  At first the latter eyed her askance, but she soon won her affection.  Both she and her mistress showed her as much attention as the gardener bestows upon a wild plant which he has transferred to good soil, where it thrives under his care.  She kept aloof from the servants, and neither man nor maid molested her. Perhaps this was due to foolish arrogance, for after they had learned from rumour that Kuni had danced on the tight rope, they considered themselves far superior.  The younger maids timidly kept out of her way, and Kuni surpassed them in pride and looked down upon them, because her free artist blood rebelled against placing herself on the plane of a servitor.  She did not vouchsafe them a word, yet neither did she allow any of them to render her even the most trivial service.  But she could not escape Seifried, the equerry of her mistress's eldest son.  At first, according to her custom, she had roused the handsome fellow's hopes by fiery glances which she could not restrain.  Now he felt that she cared for him, and in his honest fashion offered to make her his beloved wife; but she refused his suit, at first kindly, then angrily.  As he still persisted she begged the housekeeper, though she saw that matchmaking was her delight, to keep him away.  Even in March Frau Sophia thanked Lienhard for the new inmate of her household, who far exceeded her expectations.  In April her praise became still warmer, only she regretted that Kuni's pretty face was losing its fresh colour and her well-formed figure its roundness.  She was sorry, too, that she so often seemed lost in thought, and appeared less merry while playing with the children.  Lienhard and his young wife excused the girl's manner.  Comfortable as she was now, she was still a prisoned bird.  It would be unnatural, nay, suspicious, if she did not sometimes long for the old freedom and her former companions.  She would also remember at times the applause of the multitude.  The well-known Loni, her former employer, had besought him to win her back to his company, complaining loudly of her loss, because it was difficult to replace her with an equally skilful young artist.  It was now evident how mistaken the juggler had been when he asserted that Kuni, who was born among vagrants, would never live in a respectable family.  He, Lienhard, had great pleasure in knowing that the girl, on the road to ruin, had been saved by Frau Sophia's goodness.  Lienhard's father had died shortly after Kuni entered her new home. Every impulse to love dalliance, she felt, must shrink before this great sorrow.  The idea sustained her hopes.  She could not expect him to seek her again until the first bitterness of grief for the loss of this beloved relative had passed away.  She could wait, and she succeeded in doing so patiently.  But week after week went by and there was no change in his conduct.  Then a great anxiety overpowered her, and this did not escape his notice; for one day, while his young wife hung on his arm and added a few brief words of sympathy, he asked Kuni if she was ill or if she needed anything; but she answered curtly in the negative and hurried into the garden, where the children, with merry shouts, were helping the gardener to free the beds of crocuses and budding tulips from the pine boughs which had protected them from the frosts of winter.  Another sleepless night followed this incident.  It was useless to deceive herself.  She might as well mistake black for white as to believe that Lienhard cared for her.  To no one save his fair young wife would he grant even the smallest ray of the love of which he was doubtless capable, and in which she beheld the sun that dispensed life and light. She had learned this, for he had often met her in Frau Sophia's house since his father's funeral.  The child of the highway had never been taught to conceal her feelings and maintain timid reserve.  Her eyes had told him eloquently enough, first her deep sympathy, and afterward the emotions which so passionately stirred her heart.  Had the feelings which her glances were intended to reveal passed merely for the ardent gratitude of an impassioned soul?  Gratitude!  For what?  His lukewarm interest had tempted her from a free, gay life, full of constant excitement, into the oppressive, wearisome monotony of this quiet house, where she was dying of ennui.  How narrow, how petty, how tiresome everything seemed, and what she had bartered for it was the world, the whole wide, wide world.  As the chicken lured the fox, the hope of satisfying the fervent longing of her heart, though even once and for a few brief moments, had brought her into the snare.  But the fire which burned within had not been extinguished.  An icy wind had fanned the flames till they blazed higher and higher, threatening her destruction.  Frau Schurstab had made her attend church and go to the confessional. But the mass, whose meaning she did not understand, offered no solace to the soul which yearned for love alone.  Besides, it wearied her to remain so long in the same place, and the confession forced the girl, who had never shrunk from honestly expressing what she felt, into deception.  The priest to whom she was taken was a frequent visitor at the Schurstab house, and she would have died ere she would have confided to him the secret of her heart.  Besides, to her the feeling which animated her was no sin.  She had not summoned it.  It had taken possession of her against her will and harmed no one except herself, not even the wife who was so sure of her husband.  How could she have presumed to dispute"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5585"],["title","In the Blue Pike — Volume 02 (#2)"],["body","her the possession of Herr Lienhard's love?  Yet it seemed an insult that Frau Katharina had no fear that she could menace her happiness.  Could the former know that Kuni would have been content with so little--a tender impulse of his heart, a kiss, a hasty embrace?  That would do the other no injury.  In the circles whence she had been brought no one grudged another such things.  How little, she thought, would have been taken from the wealthy Katharina by the trifling gift which would have restored to her happiness and peace.  The fact that Lienhard, though he never failed to notice her, would not understand, and always maintained the same pleasant, aristocratic reserve of manner, she sometimes attributed to fear, sometimes to cruelty, sometimes to arrogance; she would not believe that he saw in her only a person otherwise indifferent to him, whom he wished to accustom to the mode of life which he and his friends believed to be the right path, pleasing in the sight of God.  Love, feminine vanity, the need of approval, her own pride--all opposed this view.  When the last snow of winter had melted, and the spring sunshine of April was unfolding the green leafage and opening bright flowers in the meadows, the hedges, the woods, and the gardens, she found the new home which she had entered during the frosts of February, and whose solid walls excluded every breath of air, more and more unendurable.  A gnawing feeling of homesickness for the free out-of-door life, the wandering from place to place, the careless, untrammelled people to whom she belonged, took possession of her.  She felt as though everything which surrounded her was too small, the house, the apartments, her own chamber, nay, her very clothing.  Only the hope of the first token that Lienhard was not so cold and unconquerable as he seemed, that she would at last constrain him to pass the barrier which separated them, still detained her.  Then came the day when, to avoid answering his question whether she needed anything, she had gone into the garden.  Before reaching the children, who were playing among the crocuses and tulips, she had said to herself that she must leave this house--it was foolish, nay mad, to continue to cherish the hope which had brought her hither.  She would suffer keenly in tearing it from her heart, but a wild delight seized her at the thought that this imprisonment would soon be over, that she would be free once more, entirely her own mistress, released from every restraint and consideration.  How rapturous was the idea that she would soon be roving through the fields and woods again with gay, reckless companions!  Was there anything more pleasurable than to forget herself, and devote her whole soul to the execution of some difficult and dangerous feat, to attract a thousand eyes by her bewitching grace, and, sustained by her enthusiasm, force a thousand hearts to throb anxiously and give loud applause as she flew over the rope?  Never had the children seen her more extravagantly gay than after her resolve to leave them.  Yet when, at a late hour, Kuni went to bed, the old housekeeper heard her weeping so piteously in her chamber that she rose to ask what had happened.  But the girl did not even open her door, and declared that she had probably had the nightmare.  During the next few days she sometimes appeared more cheerful and docile, sometimes more dull and troubled than her household companions had ever seen her.  Frau Schurstab shook her head over her protegee's varying moods.  But when the month of May began, and Lienhard told his aunt that Loni, who had only remained in Nuremberg during Lent to spend the time when all public performances were prohibited, had applied to the Council for permission to give exhibitions with his company Easter week in the Haller Meadows, the matron was troubled about her protegee's peace of mind.  Her nephew had had the same thought, and advised her to move to her country estate, that Kuni might see and hear nothing of the jugglers; but she had noticed the clown with other members of the company, as they passed through the streets on foot and mounted on horses and donkeys, inviting the people, with blare of trumpets and beating of drums, to witness the wonderful feats which Loni's famous band of artists would perform.  Then Kuni packed her bundle.  But when she heard the next morning that, before going to the country, Frau Schurstab would attend the christening of her youngest grandson, and spend the whole day with the daughter who was the little boy's mother, she untied it.  One sunny May morning she was left alone, as she had expected.  She could not be invited to the ceremony with the other guests, and she would not join the servants.  The housekeeper and most of the men and maids had accompanied their mistress to help in the kitchen and to wait upon the visitors.  Deep silence reigned throughout the great empty house, but Kuni's heart had never throbbed so loudly.  If Lienhard came now, her fate would be decided, and she knew that he must come.  Just before noon, he really did rap with the knocker on the outer door.  He wanted the christening gift, which Frau Schurstab had forgotten to take for the infant.  The money was in the chest in the matron's room.  Kuni led the way.  The house seemed to reel around her as she went up the stairs behind him.  The next moment, she felt, must decide her destiny.  Now he laid his hand upon the doorknob, now he opened the door.  The widow's chamber was before her.  Thick silk curtains shut out the bright May sunshine from the quiet room.  How warm and pleasant it was!  She already saw herself in imagination kneeling by his side before the chest to help him search.  While doing so, his fingers might touch hers, perhaps her hair might brush against his.  But, instead of entering, he turned to her with careless unconcern, saying:  \"It is fortunate that I have found you alone.  Will you do me a favour, girl?\"  He had intended to ask her to help him prepare a surprise for his aunt. The day after to-morrow was Frau Sophia Schurstab's birthday.  Early in the morning she must find among her feathered favourites a pair of rare India fowls, which he had received from Venice.  As Kuni did not instantly assent, because the wild tumult of her blood paralyzed her tongue, he noticed her confusion, and in an encouraging tone, gaily continued:  \"What I have to ask is not too difficult.\"  As he spoke he passed his hand kindly over her dark hair, just as he had done a few months before in the Town Hall.  Then the blood mounted to her brain.  Clasping his right hand, beneath whose touch she had just trembled, in both her own, she passionately exclaimed:  \"Ask whatever you desire.  If you wanted to trample my heart under your feet, I would not stir.\"  A look of ardent love from her sparkling blue eyes accompanied the words; but he had withdrawn his hand in astonishment, and raised a lofty barrier between them by answering coldly and sternly, \"Keep the heart and your dainty self for the equerry Seifried who is an honest man.\"  The advice, and the lofty austerity with which it was given, pierced Kuni like the thrust of a dagger.  Yet she succeeded controlling herself, and, without a word reply, preceded the harsh man into the sleeping room and silently, tearlessly, pointed the chest.  When he had taken out the money, she bowed hastily and ran down the stairs.  Probably she heard him call her name more than three times; doubtless, afterward she fancied that she remembered how his voice had sounded in beseeching, tender, at last even imperious tones through the empty corridors; but she did not turn, and hurried into her room.     CHAPTER V.  When, on the evening of the christening day, Lienhard accompanied his aunt home, Kuni was nowhere to be found.  Frau Sophia discovered in her chamber every article of clothing which she had obtained for her, even the beaver cap, the prayer-book, and the rosary which she had given. The young burgomaster, at her request, went to the manager of the rope- dancers, Loni, the next morning, but the latter asserted that he knew nothing about the girl.  The truth was that he had sent her to Wurzburg with part of his company.  From that time she had remained with the ropedancers.  At first the master had watched her carefully, that she might not run away again.  But he soon perceived this to be unnecessary; for he had never found any member of the company more zealous, or seen one make more progress in the art.  Now the only point was to keep her out of the way of other rope- dancers, English proprietors of circus companies, as well as the numerous knights and gentlemen who tried to take her from him.  Her name had become famous.  When the crier proclaimed that the \"flying maiden\" would ascend the rope to the steeple, Loni was sure of a great crowd of spectators.  Among her own profession she had obtained the nickname of crazy Kuni.  Yet even at that time, and in the midst of the freest intercourse with German, Spanish, and other officers in Flanders and Brabant, young knights and light-hearted priests on the Rhine, the Main, the Danube, the Weser, and the Elbe, whose purses the pretty, vivacious girl, with the shining raven hair and bright blue eyes, the mistress of her art, seemed to their owners worthy to empty, she had by no means forgotten Lienhard. This wrought mischief to many a gay gentleman of aristocratic lineage in the great imperial and commercial cities; for it afforded Kuni special pleasure to try her power upon Lienhard's equals in rank.  When she went on with the company, more than one patrician had good reason to remember her with regret; for she, who shared the lion's portion of her earnings with her companions or flung it to the poor, was insatiably avaricious toward these admirers.  The weaker she found many of them, the higher, in her opinion, rose the image of him who had made her feel his manly strength of resistance so"]]]
