It was a mad world in Chamu's opinion.  He went and fetched the hamal, who slunk through his task with the air of a condemned felon.  Tess smiled at the man for encouragement, but Chamu's instant jealousy was so obvious that she regretted the mistake.  \"Now call up the beggars and feed them,\" she ordered.  \"Feed them?  They will not eat.  It is contrary to caste.\"  \"Nonsense.  They have no caste.  Bring bread and feed them.\"  \"There is no bread of the sort they will eat.\"  \"I know exactly what you mean.  If I give them bread there's no profit for you--they'll eat it all;  but if I give them money you'll exact a commission from them of one pesa in five.  Isn't that so?  Go and bring the bread.\"  He decided to turn the set-back into at any rate a minor victory and went in person to the kitchen for chupatties such as the servants ate.  Then, returning to the top of the steps he intimated that the earth-defilers might draw near and receive largesse, contriving the impression that it was by his sole favor the concession was obtained.  Two of them came promptly and waited at the foot of the steps, smirking and changing attitudes to draw attention to their rags.  Chamu tossed the bread to them with expressions of disgust.  If they had cared to pretend they were holy men he would have been respectful, in degree at least, but these were professionals so hardened that they dared ignore the religious apology, which implies throughout the length and breadth of India the right to beg from place to place.  These were not even true vagabonds, but rogues contented with one victim in one place as long as benevolence should last.  \"Where is the third one?\" Tess demanded.  \"Where is Pinga?\"  They professed not to know, but she had seen all three squatting together close to the little gate five minutes before.  She ordered Chamu to go and find the missing man and he waddled off, grumbling.  At the end of five minutes he returned without him.  \"One comes on horseback,\" he announced, \"who gave the third beggar money, so that he now waits outside.\"  \"What for?\"  \"Who knows?  Perhaps to keep watch.\"  \"To watch for what?\"  \"Who knows?\"  \"Who is it on horseback?  A caller?  Some one coming for breakfast? You'd better hurry.\"  The call at breakfast-time is one of the pleasantest informalities of life in India.  It might even be the commissioner.  Tess ran to make one of those swift changes of costume with which some women have the gift of gracing every opportunity.  Chamu waddled down the steps to await with due formality, the individual, in no way resembling a British commissioner, who was leisurely dismounting at the wide gate fifty yards to the southward of that little one the beggars used.  He was a Rajput of Rajputs, thin-wristed, thin-ankled, lean, astonishingly handsome in a high-bred Northern way, and possessed of that air of utter self-assuredness devoid of arrogance which people seem able to learn only by being born to it.  His fine features were set off by a turban of rose-pink silk, and the only fault discoverable as he strode up the path between the shrubs was that his riding-boots seemed too tight across the instep.  There was not a vestige of hair on his face.  He was certainly less than twenty, perhaps seventeen years old, or even younger. Ages are hard to guess in that land.  Tess was back on the veranda in time to receive him, with different shoes and stockings, and another ribbon in her hair;  few men would have noticed the change at all, although agreeably conscious of the daintiness.  The Rajput seemed unable to look away from her but ignoring Chamu, as he came up the steps, appraised her inch by inch from the white shoes upward until as he reached the top their eyes met. Chamu followed him fussily.  Tess could not remember ever having seen such eyes.  They were baffling by their quality of brilliance, unlike the usual slumbrous Eastern orbs that puzzle chiefly by refusal to express emotion.  The Rajput bowed and said nothing, so Tess offered him a chair, which Chamu drew up more fussily than ever.  \"Have you had breakfast?\" she asked, taking the conscious risk.  Strangers of alien race are not invariably good guests, however good-looking, especially when one's husband is somewhere out of call.  She looked and felt nearly as young as this man, and had already experienced overtures from more than one young prince who supposed he was doing her an honor.  Used to closely guarded women's quarters, the East wastes little time on wooing when the barriers are passed or down. But she felt irresistibly curious, and after all there was Chamu.  \"Thanks, I took breakfast before dawn.\"  The Rajput accepted the proffered chair without acknowledging the butler's existence.  Tess passed him the big silver cigarette box.  \"Then let me offer you a drink.\"  He declined both drink and cigarette and there was a minute's silence during which she began to grow uncomfortable.  \"I was riding after breakfast--up there on the hill where you see that overhanging rock, when I caught sight of you here on the veranda. You, too, were watching the dawn--beautiful!  I love the dawn.  So I thought I would come and get to know you.  People who love the same thing, you know, are not exactly strangers.\"  Almost, if not quite for the first time Tess grew very grateful for Chamu, who was still hovering at hand.  \"If my husband had known, he would have stayed to receive you.\"  \"Oh, no! I took good care for that!  I continued my ride until after I knew he had gone for the day.\"  Things dawn on your understanding in the East one by one, as the stars come out at night, until in the end there is such a bewildering number of points of light that people talk about the \"incomprehensible East.\"  Tess saw light suddenly.  \"Do you mean that those three beggars are your spies?\"  The Rajput nodded.  Then his bright eyes detected the instant resolution that Tess formed.  \"But you must not be afraid of them.  They will be very useful--often.\"  \"How?\"  The visitor made a gesture that drew attention to Chamu.  \"Your butler knows English.  Do you know Russian?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"French?\"  \"Very little.\"  \"If we were alone--\"  Tess decided to face the situation boldly.  She came from a free land, and part of her heritage was to dare meet any man face to face;  but intuition combined with curiosity to give her confidence.  \"Chamu, you may go.\"  The butler waddled out of sight, but the Rajput waited until the sound of his retreating footsteps died away somewhere near the kitchen.  Then:  \"You feel afraid of me?\" he asked.  \"Not at all.  Why should I?  Why do you wish to see me alone?\"  \"I have decided you are to be my friend.  Are you not pleased?\"  \"But I don't know anything about you.  Suppose you tell me who you are and tell me why you use beggars to spy on my husband.\"  \"Those who have great plans make powerful enemies, and fight against odds.  I make friends where I can, and instruments even of my enemies. You are to be my friend.\"  \"You look very young to--\"  Suddenly Tess saw light again, and the discovery caused her pupils to contract a little and then dilate.  The Rajput noticed it, and laughed. Then, leaning forward:  \"How did vou know I am a woman?  Tell me.  I must know.  I shall study to act better.\"  Tess leaned back entirely at her ease at last and looked up at the sky, rather reveling in relief and in the fun of turning the tables.  \"Please tell me!  I must know!\"  \"Oh, one thing and another.  It isn't easy to explain.  For one thing, your insteps.\"  \"I will get other boots.  What else?  I make no lap.  I hold my hands as a man does.  Is my voice too high--too excitable?\"  \"No.  There are men with voices like yours.  There's a long golden hair on your shoulder that might, of course, belong to some one else, but your ears are pierced--\"  \"So are many men's.\"  \"And you have blue eyes, and long fair lashes.  I've seen occasional Rajput men with blue eyes, too, but your teeth--much too perfect for a man.\"  \"For a young man?\"  \"Perhaps not.  But add one thing to another--\"  \"There is something else.  Tell me!\"  \"You remember when you called attention to the butler before I dismissed him?  No man could do that.  You're a woman and you can dance.\"  \"So it is my shoulders?  I will study again before the mirror.  Yes, I can dance.  Soon you shall see me.  You shall see all the most wonderful things in Rajputana.\"  \"But tell me about yourself,\" Tess insisted, offering the cigarettes again. And this time her guest accepted one.  \"My mother was the Russian wife of Bubru Singh, who had no son. I am the rightful maharanee of Sialpore, only those fools of English put my father's  nephew on the throne, saying a woman can not reign.  They are no wiser than apes!  They have given Sialpore to Gungadhura who is a pig and loathes them instead of to a woman who would only laugh at them, and the brute is raising a litter of little pigs, so that even if he and his progeny were poisoned one by one, there would always be a brat left--he has so many!\"  \"And you?\"  \"First you must promise silence.\"  \"Very well.\"  \"Woman to woman!\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Womb to womb--heart to heart--?\"  \"On my word of honor.  But I promise nothing else, remember!\"  \"So speaks one whose promises are given truly!  We are already friends. I will tell you all that is in my heart now.\"  \"Tell me your name first.\"  She was about to answer when interruption came from the direction of the gate.  There was a restless horse there, and a rider using resonant strong language.  \"Tom Tripe!\" said Tess.  \"He's earlier than usual.\"  The Rajputni smiled.  Chamu appeared through the door behind them with suspicious suddenness and waddled to the gate, watched by a pair of blue eyes that should have burned holes in his back and would certainly have robbed him of all comfort had he been aware of them."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5606"],["title","Guns of the Gods: A Story of Yasmini's Youth (#4)"],["body","      Chapter Two  Thaw on Olympus  Bright spurs that add their roweled row To clanking saber's pride; Fierce eyes beneath a beetling brow; More license than the rules allow; A military stride; Years' use of arbitrary will And right to make or break; Obedience of men who drill And willy nilly foot the bill For authorized mistake; The comfort of the self-esteem Deputed power brings-- Are fickler than the shadows seem Less fruitful than the lotus-dream, And all of them have wings When blue eyes, laughing in your own, Make mockery of rules!

Tess's strange guest seemed in no hurry either, but her movements were as swift as knitting-needles.  She produced a fountain pen, and of all unexpected things, a Bank of India note for one thousand rupees--a new one, crisp and clean.  Tess did not see the signature she scrawled across its back in Persian characters, and the pen was returned to an inner pocket and the note, folded four times, was palmed in the subtle hand long before Tom Tripe came striding up the path with jingling spurs.  \"Morning, ma'am,--morning!  Don't let me intrude.  I'd a little accident, and took a liberty.  My horse cut his fetlock--nothing serious--and I set your two saises (grooms) to work on it with a sponge and water. Twenty minutes--will see it right as a trivet.  Then I'm off again--I've a job of work.\"  He stood with back to the sun and hands on his hips, looking up at Tess-- a man of fifty--a soldier of another generation, in a white uniform something like a British sergeant-major's of the days before the Mutiny.  His mutton-chop whiskers, dyed dark-brown, were military mid-Victorian, as were the huge brass spurs that jingled on black riding-boots.  A great-chested, heavy-weight athletic man, a few years past his prime.  \"Come up, Tom.  You're always welcome.\"  \"Ah!\"  His spurs rang on the stone steps, and, since Tess was standing close to the veranda rail, he turned to face her at the top.  Saluting with martinet precision before removing his helmet, he did not get a clear view of the Rajputni.  \"As I've said many times, ma'am, the one house in the world where Tom Tripe may sit down with princes and commissioners.\"  \"Have you had breakfast?\"  He made a wry face.  \"The old story, Tom?\"  \"The old story, ma'am.  A hair of the dog that bit me is all the breakfast I could swallow.\"  \"I suppose if I don't give you one now you'll have two later?\"  He nodded. \"I must.  One now would put me just to rights and I'd eat at noon.  Times when I'm savage with myself, and wait, I have to have two or three before I can stomach lunch.\"  She offered him a basket chair and beckoned Chamu.  \"Brandy and soda for the sahib.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am!\" said the soldier piously.  \"Where's your dog, Tom?\"  \"Behaving himself, I hope, ma'am, out there in the sun by the gate.\"  \"Call him.  He shall have a bone on the veranda.  I want him to feel as friendly here as you do.\"  Tom whistled shrilly and an ash-hued creature, part Great Dane and certainly part Rampore, came up the path like a catapulted phantom, making hardly any sound.  He stopped at the foot of the steps and gazed inquiringly at his master's face.  \"You may come up.\"  He was an extraordinary animal, enormous, big-jowled, scarred, ungainly and apparently aware of it.  He paused again on the top step.  \"Show your manners.\"  The beast walked toward Tess, sniffed at her, wagged his stern exactly once and retired to the other end of the veranda, where Chamu, hurrying with brandy gave him the widest possible berth.  Tess looked the other way while Tom Tripe helped himself to a lot of brandy and a little soda.  \"Now get a big bone for the dog,\" she ordered.  \"There is none,\" the butler answered.  \"Bring the leg-of-mutton bone of yesterday.\"  \"That is for soup today.\"  \"Bring it!\"  Chamu was standing between Tom Tripe and the Rajputni, with his back to the latter; so nobody saw the hand that slipped something into the ample folds of his sash.  He departed muttering by way of the steps and the garden, and the dog growled acknowledgment of the compliment.  Tess's Rajput guest continued to say nothing;  but made no move to go. Introduction was inevitable, for it was the first rule of that house that all ranks met there on equal terms, whatever their relations elsewhere. Tom Tripe had finished wiping his mustache, and Tess was still wondering just how to manage without betraying the sex of the other or the fact that she herself did not yet know her visitor's name, when Chamu returned with the bone.  He threw it to the dog from a safe distance, and was sniffed at scornfully for his pains.  \"Won't he take it?\" asked Tess.  \"Not from a black man.  Bring it here, you!\"  The great brute, with a sidewise growl and glare at the butler that made him sweat with fright, picked up the bone and, at a sign from his master, laid it at the feet of Tess.  \"Show your manners!\"  Once more he waved his stern exactly once.  \"Give it to him, ma'am.\"  Tess touched the bone with her foot, and the dog took it away, scaring Chamu along the veranda in front of him.  \"Why don't you ever call him by name, Tom?\"  \"Bad for him, ma'am.  When I say, 'Here, you!' or whistle, he obeys quick as lightning.  But if I say, 'Trotters!' which his name is, he knows he's got to do his own thinking, and keeps his distance till he's sure what's wanted.  A dog's like an enlisted man, ma'am;  ought to be taught to jump at the word of command and never think for himself until you call him out of the ranks by name.  Trotters understands me perfectly.\"  \"Speaking of names,\" said Tess, \"I'd like to introduce you to my guest, Tom, but I'm afraid--\"  \"You may call me Gunga Singh,\" said a quiet voice full of amusement, and Tom Tripe started.  He turned about in his chair and for the first time looked the third member of the party in the face.  \"Hoity-toity!  Well, I'm jiggered!  Dash my drink and dinner, it's the princess!\"  He rose and saluted cavalierly, jocularly, yet with a deference one could not doubt, showing tobacco-darkened teeth in a smile of almost paternal indulgence.  \"So the Princess Yasmini is Gunga Singh this morning, eh?  And here's Tom Tripe riding up-hill and down-dale, laming his horse and sweating through a clean tunic--with a threat in his ear and a reward promised that he'll never see a smell of--while the princess is smoking cigarettes--\"  \"In very good company!\"  \"In good company, aye;  but not out of mischief, I'll be bound!  Naughty, naughty!\" he said, wagging a finger at her.  \"Your ladyship'll get caught one of these days, and where will Tom Tripe be then?  I've got my job to keep, you know.  Friendship's friendship and respect's respect, but duty's what I'm paid to do.  Here's me, drill-master of the maharajah's troops and a pension coming to me consequent on good behavior, with orders to set a guard over you, miss, and prevent your going and coming without his highness' leave.  And here's you giving the guard the slip!  Somebody tipped his highness off, and I wish you'd heard what's going to happen to me unless I find you!\"  \"You can't find me, Tom Tripe!  I'm not Yasmini today;  I'm Gunga Singh!\"  \"Tut-tut, Your Ladyship;  that won't do!  I swore on my Bible oath to the maharajah that I left you day before yesterday closely guarded in the palace across the river.  He felt easy for the first time for a week.  Now, because they're afraid for their skins, the guard all swear by Krishna you were never in there, and that I've been bribed!  How did you get out of the grounds, miss?\"  \"Climbed the wall.\"  \"I might have remembered you're as active as a cat!  Next time I'll mount a double guard on the wall, so they'll tumble off and break their necks if they fall asleep.  But there are no boats, for I saw to it, and the bridge is watched.  How did you cross the river?\"  \"Swam.\"  \"At night?\"  The blue eyes smiled assent.  \"Missy--Your Ladyship, you mustn't do that.  Little ladies that act that way might lose the number of their mess.  There's crockadowndillies in that river--aggilators--what d'ye call the damp things?--mugger.  They snap their jaws on a leg and pull you under!  The sweeter and prettier you are the more they like you!  Besides, missy, princesses aren't supposed to swim;  it's vulgar.\"  He contrived to look the very incarnation of offended prudery, and she laughed at him with a voice like a golden bell.  He faced Tess again with a gesture of apology.  \"You'll pardon me, ma'am, but duty's duty.\"  Tess was enjoying the play immensely, shrewdly suspecting Tom Tripe of more complaisance than he chose to admit to his prisoner.  \"You must treat my house as a sanctuary, Tom.  Outside the garden wall orders I suppose are orders.  Inside it I insist all guests are free and equal.\"  The Princess Yasmini slapped her boot with a little riding-switch and laughed delightedly.  \"There, Tom Tripe!  Now what will you do?\"  \"I'll have to use persuasion, miss!  Tell me how you got into your own palace unseen and out again with a horse without a soul knowing?\"  \"'Come into my net and get caught,' said the hunter;  but the leopard is still at large.  'Teach me your tracks,' begged the hunter;  but the leopard answered, 'Learn them!' '  \"Hell's bells!\"  Tom Tripe scratched his head and wiped sweat from his collar.  The princess was gazing away into the distance, not apparently inclined to take the soldier seriously.  Tess, wondering what her guest found interesting on the horizon all of a sudden, herself picked out the third beggar's shabby outline on the same high rock from which Yasmini had confessed to watching before dawn.  \"Will your ladyship ride home with me?\" asked Tom Tripe.  \"No.\"  \"But why not?\"  \"Because the commissioner is coming and there is only one "]]]
