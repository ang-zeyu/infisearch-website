How can you expect four women to dine together alone every day, and not quarrel? We are such fools, we can't entertain each other at table.  You see I don't think much of my own sex, Mr. Hartright--which will you have, tea or coffee?--no woman does think much of her own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I do. Dear me, you look puzzled.  Why? Are you wondering what you will have for breakfast? or are you surprised at my careless way of talking? In the first case, I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with that cold ham at your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in. In the second case, I will give you some tea to compose your spirits, and do all a woman can (which is very little, by-the-bye) to hold my tongue.\"  She handed me my cup of tea, laughing gaily.  Her light flow of talk, and her lively familiarity of manner with a total stranger, were accompanied by an unaffected naturalness and an easy inborn confidence in herself and her position, which would have secured her the respect of the most audacious man breathing.  While it was impossible to be formal and reserved in her company, it was more than impossible to take the faintest vestige of a liberty with her, even in thought.  I felt this instinctively, even while I caught the infection of her own bright gaiety of spirits--even while I did my best to answer her in her own frank, lively way.  \"Yes, yes,\" she said, when I had suggested the only explanation I could offer, to account for my perplexed looks, \"I understand. You are such a perfect stranger in the house, that you are puzzled by my familiar references to the worthy inhabitants.  Natural enough: I ought to have thought of it before.  At any rate, I can set it right now.  Suppose I begin with myself, so as to get done with that part of the subject as soon as possible? My name is Marian Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are, in calling Mr. Fairlie my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my sister.  My mother was twice married: the first time to Mr. Halcombe, my father; the second time to Mr. Fairlie, my half-sister's father. Except that we are both orphans, we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible.  My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father was a rich man.  I have got nothing, and she has a fortune.  I am dark and ugly, and she is fair and pretty. Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd (with perfect justice); and everybody thinks her sweet-tempered and charming (with more justice still).  In short, she is an angel; and I am----  Try some of that marmalade, Mr. Hartright, and finish the sentence, in the name of female propriety, for yourself.  What am I to tell you about Mr. Fairlie? Upon my honour, I hardly know.  He is sure to send for you after breakfast, and you can study him for yourself. In the meantime, I may inform you, first, that he is the late Mr. Fairlie's younger brother; secondly, that he is a single man; and thirdly, that he is Miss Fairlie's guardian.  I won't live without her, and she can't live without me; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House.  My sister and I are honestly fond of each other; which, you will say, is perfectly unaccountable, under the circumstances, and I quite agree with you--but so it is.  You must please both of us, Mr. Hartright, or please neither of us: and, what is still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon our society.  Mrs. Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal virtues, and counts for nothing; and Mr. Fairlie is too great an invalid to be a companion for anybody.  I don't know what is the matter with him, and the doctors don't know what is the matter with him, and he doesn't know himself what is the matter with him.  We all say it's on the nerves, and we none of us know what we mean when we say it.  However, I advise you to humour his little peculiarities, when you see him to-day. Admire his collection of coins, prints, and water-colour drawings, and you will win his heart.  Upon my word, if you can be contented with a quiet country life, I don't see why you should not get on very well here.  From breakfast to lunch, Mr. Fairlie's drawings will occupy you. After lunch, Miss Fairlie and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out to misrepresent Nature, under your directions. Drawing is her favourite whim, mind, not mine.  Women can't draw--their minds are too flighty, and their eyes are too inattentive. No matter--my sister likes it; so I waste paint and spoil paper, for her sake, as composedly as any woman in England.  As for the evenings, I think we can help you through them. Miss Fairlie plays delightfully.  For my own poor part, I don't know one note of music from the other; but I can match you at chess, backgammon, ecarte, and (with the inevitable female drawbacks) even at billiards as well.  What do you think of the programme? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life? or do you mean to be restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure, in the humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House?\"  She had run on thus far, in her gracefully bantering way, with no other interruptions on my part than the unimportant replies which politeness required of me.  The turn of the expression, however, in her last question, or rather the one chance word, \"adventure,\" lightly as it fell from her lips, recalled my thoughts to my meeting with the woman in white, and urged me to discover the connection which the stranger's own reference to Mrs. Fairlie informed me must once have existed between the nameless fugitive from the Asylum, and the former mistress of Limmeridge House.  \"Even if I were the most restless of mankind,\" I said, \"I should be in no danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come.  The very night before I arrived at this house, I met with an adventure; and the wonder and excitement of it, I can assure you, Miss Halcombe, will last me for the whole term of my stay in Cumberland, if not for a much longer period.\"  \"You don't say so, Mr. Hartright! May I hear it?\"  \"You have a claim to hear it.  The chief person in the adventure was a total stranger to me, and may perhaps be a total stranger to you; but she certainly mentioned the name of the late Mrs. Fairlie in terms of the sincerest gratitude and regard.\"  \"Mentioned my mother's name! You interest me indescribably.  Pray go on.\"  I at once related the circumstances under which I had met the woman in white, exactly as they had occurred; and I repeated what she had said to me about Mrs. Fairlie and Limmeridge House, word for word.  Miss Halcombe's bright resolute eyes looked eagerly into mine, from the beginning of the narrative to the end.  Her face expressed vivid interest and astonishment, but nothing more.  She was evidently as far from knowing of any clue to the mystery as I was myself.  \"Are you quite sure of those words referring to my mother?\" she asked.  \"Quite sure,\" I replied.  \"Whoever she may be, the woman was once at school in the village of Limmeridge, was treated with especial kindness by Mrs. Fairlie, and, in grateful remembrance of that kindness, feels an affectionate interest in all surviving members of the family.  She knew that Mrs. Fairlie and her husband were both dead; and she spoke of Miss Fairlie as if they had known each other when they were children.\"  \"You said, I think, that she denied belonging to this place?\"  \"Yes, she told me she came from Hampshire.\"  \"And you entirely failed to find out her name?\"  \"Entirely.\"  \"Very strange.  I think you were quite justified, Mr. Hartright, in giving the poor creature her liberty, for she seems to have done nothing in your presence to show herself unfit to enjoy it. But I wish you had been a little more resolute about finding out her name.  We must really clear up this mystery, in some way.  You had better not speak of it yet to Mr. Fairlie, or to my sister. They are both of them, I am certain, quite as ignorant of who the woman is, and of what her past history in connection with us can be, as I am myself.  But they are also, in widely different ways, rather nervous and sensitive; and you would only fidget one and alarm the other to no purpose.  As for myself, I am all aflame with curiosity, and I devote my whole energies to the business of discovery from this moment.  When my mother came here, after her second marriage, she certainly established the village school just as it exists at the present time.  But the old teachers are all dead, or gone elsewhere; and no enlightenment is to be hoped for from that quarter.  The only other alternative I can think of----\"  At this point we were interrupted by the entrance of the servant, with a message from Mr. Fairlie, intimating that he would be glad to see me, as soon as I had done breakfast.  \"Wait in the hall,\" said Miss Halcombe, answering the servant for me, in her quick, ready way.  \"Mr. Hartright will come out directly.  I was about to say,\" she went on, addressing me again, \"that my sister and I have a large collection of my mother's letters, addressed to my father and to hers.  In the absence of any other means of getting information, I will pass the morning in looking over my mother's correspondence with Mr. Fairlie.  He was fond of London, and was constantly away from his country home; and she was accustomed, at such times, to write and report to him how things went on at Limmeridge.  Her letters are full of references to the school in which she took so strong an interest; and I think it more than likely that I may have discovered something when we meet again.  The luncheon hour is two, Mr. Hartright.  I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister by that time, and we will occupy the afternoon in driving round the neighbourhood and showing you all our pet points of view.  Till two o'clock, then, farewell.\"  She nodded to me with the lively grace,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/583"],["title","The Woman in White (#7)"],["body"," delightful refinement of familiarity, which characterised all that she did and all that she said; and disappeared by a door at the lower end of the room. As soon as she had left me, I turned my steps towards the hall, and followed the servant, on my way, for the first time, to the presence of Mr. Fairlie.    VII  My conductor led me upstairs into a passage which took us back to the bedchamber in which I had slept during the past night; and opening the door next to it, begged me to look in.  \"I have my master's orders to show you your own sitting-room, sir,\" said the man, \"and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the light.\"  I must have been hard to please, indeed, if I had not approved of the room, and of everything about it.  The bow-window looked out on the same lovely view which I had admired, in the morning, from my bedroom. The furniture was the perfection of luxury and beauty; the table in the centre was bright with gaily bound books, elegant conveniences for writing, and beautiful flowers; the second table, near the window, was covered with all the necessary materials for mounting water-colour drawings, and had a little easel attached to it, which I could expand or fold up at will; the walls were hung with gaily tinted chintz; and the floor was spread with Indian matting in maize-colour and red.  It was the prettiest and most luxurious little sitting-room I had ever seen; and I admired it with the warmest enthusiasm.  The solemn servant was far too highly trained to betray the slightest satisfaction.  He bowed with icy deference when my terms of eulogy were all exhausted, and silently opened the door for me to go out into the passage again.  We turned a corner, and entered a long second passage, ascended a short flight of stairs at the end, crossed a small circular upper hall, and stopped in front of a door covered with dark baize.  The servant opened this door, and led me on a few yards to a second; opened that also, and disclosed two curtains of pale sea-green silk hanging before us; raised one of them noiselessly; softly uttered the words, \"Mr. Hartright,\" and left me.  I found myself in a large, lofty room, with a magnificent carved ceiling, and with a carpet over the floor, so thick and soft that it felt like piles of velvet under my feet.  One side of the room was occupied by a long book-case of some rare inlaid wood that was quite new to me.  It was not more than six feet high, and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble, ranged at regular distances one from the other.  On the opposite side stood two antique cabinets; and between them, and above them, hung a picture of the Virgin and Child, protected by glass, and bearing Raphael's name on the gilt tablet at the bottom of the frame.  On my right hand and on my left, as I stood inside the door, were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie, loaded with figures in Dresden china, with rare vases, ivory ornaments, and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with gold, silver, and precious stones.  At the lower end of the room, opposite to me, the windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large blinds of the same pale sea-green colour as the curtains over the door.  The light thus produced was deliciously soft, mysterious, and subdued; it fell equally upon all the objects in the room; it helped to intensify the deep silence, and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the place; and it surrounded, with an appropriate halo of repose, the solitary figure of the master of the house, leaning back, listlessly composed, in a large easy-chair, with a reading-easel fastened on one of its arms, and a little table on the other.  If a man's personal appearance, when he is out of his dressing-room, and when he has passed forty, can be accepted as a safe guide to his time of life--which is more than doubtful--Mr. Fairlie's age, when I saw him, might have been reasonably computed at over fifty and under sixty years.  His beardless face was thin, worn, and transparently pale, but not wrinkled; his nose was high and hooked; his eyes were of a dim greyish blue, large, prominent, and rather red round the rims of the eyelids; his hair was scanty, soft to look at, and of that light sandy colour which is the last to disclose its own changes towards grey.  He was dressed in a dark frock-coat, of some substance much thinner than cloth, and in waistcoat and trousers of spotless white. His feet were effeminately small, and were clad in buff-coloured silk stockings, and little womanish bronze-leather slippers.  Two rings adorned his white delicate hands, the value of which even my inexperienced observation detected to be all but priceless.  Upon the whole, he had a frail, languidly-fretful, over-refined look--something singularly and unpleasantly delicate in its association with a man, and, at the same time, something which could by no possibility have looked natural and appropriate if it had been transferred to the personal appearance of a woman.  My morning's experience of Miss Halcombe had predisposed me to be pleased with everybody in the house; but my sympathies shut themselves up resolutely at the first sight of Mr. Fairlie.  On approaching nearer to him, I discovered that he was not so entirely without occupation as I had at first supposed.  Placed amid the other rare and beautiful objects on a large round table near him, was a dwarf cabinet in ebony and silver, containing coins of all shapes and sizes, set out in little drawers lined with dark purple velvet.  One of these drawers lay on the small table attached to his chair; and near it were some tiny jeweller's brushes, a wash-leather \"stump,\" and a little bottle of liquid, all waiting to be used in various ways for the removal of any accidental impurities which might be discovered on the coins.  His frail white fingers were listlessly toying with something which looked, to my uninstructed eyes, like a dirty pewter medal with ragged edges, when I advanced within a respectful distance of his chair, and stopped to make my bow.  \"So glad to possess you at Limmeridge, Mr. Hartright,\" he said in a querulous, croaking voice, which combined, in anything but an agreeable manner, a discordantly high tone with a drowsily languid utterance. \"Pray sit down.  And don't trouble yourself to move the chair, please. In the wretched state of my nerves, movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to me.  Have you seen your studio? Will it do?\"  \"I have just come from seeing the room, Mr. Fairlie; and I assure you----\"  He stopped me in the middle of the sentence, by closing his eyes, and holding up one of his white hands imploringly.  I paused in astonishment; and the croaking voice honoured me with this explanation--  \"Pray excuse me.  But could you contrive to speak in a lower key? In the wretched state of my nerves, loud sound of any kind is indescribable torture to me.  You will pardon an invalid? I only say to you what the lamentable state of my health obliges me to say to everybody.  Yes.  And you really like the room?\"  \"I could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable,\" I answered, dropping my voice, and beginning to discover already that Mr. Fairlie's selfish affectation and Mr. Fairlie's wretched nerves meant one and the same thing.  \"So glad.  You will find your position here, Mr. Hartright, properly recognised.  There is none of the horrid English barbarity of feeling about the social position of an artist in this house.  So much of my early life has been passed abroad, that I have quite cast my insular skin in that respect.  I wish I could say the same of the gentry--detestable word, but I suppose I must use it--of the gentry in the neighbourhood. They are sad Goths in Art, Mr. Hartright.  People, I do assure you, who would have opened their eyes in astonishment, if they had seen Charles the Fifth pick up Titian's brush for him.  Do you mind putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet, and giving me the next one to it? In the wretched state of my nerves, exertion of any kind is unspeakably disagreeable to me.  Yes.  Thank you.\"  As a practical commentary on the liberal social theory which he had just favoured me by illustrating, Mr. Fairlie's cool request rather amused me.  I put back one drawer and gave him the other, with all possible politeness.  He began trifling with the new set of coins and the little brushes immediately; languidly looking at them and admiring them all the time he was speaking to me.  \"A thousand thanks and a thousand excuses.  Do you like coins? Yes.  So glad we have another taste in common besides our taste for Art.  Now, about the pecuniary arrangements between us--do tell me--are they satisfactory?\"  \"Most satisfactory, Mr. Fairlie.\"  \"So glad.  And--what next? Ah! I remember.  Yes.  In reference to the consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the benefit of your accomplishments in art, my steward will wait on you at the end of the first week, to ascertain your wishes.  And--what next? Curious, is it not? I had a great deal more to say: and I appear to have quite forgotten it.  Do you mind touching the bell? In that corner.  Yes.  Thank you.\"  I rang; and a new servant noiselessly made his appearance--a foreigner, with a set smile and perfectly brushed hair--a valet every inch of him.  \"Louis,\" said Mr. Fairlie, dreamily dusting the tips of his fingers with one of the tiny brushes for the coins, \"I made some entries in my tablettes this morning.  Find my tablettes.  A thousand pardons, Mr. Hartright, I'm afraid I bore you.\"  As he wearily closed his eyes again, before I could answer, and as he did most assuredly bore me, I sat silent, and looked up at the Madonna and Child by Raphael.  In the meantime, the valet left the room, and returned shortly with a little ivory book.  Mr. Fairlie, after first relieving himself by a gentle sigh, let the book drop open with one hand, and held up the tiny brush "]]]
