Fringing the prairie billows, fretting horizon's line, Darkly green are slumb'ring wildernesses of pine, Sleeping until the zephyrs throng To kiss their silence into song.  Whispers freighted with odour swinging into the air, Russet needles as censers swing to an altar, where The angels' songs are less divine Than duo sung twixt breeze and pine.  Laughing into the forest, dimples a mountain stream, Pure as the airs above it, soft as a summer dream, O! Lethean spring thou'rt only found Within this ideal hunting ground.  Surely the great Hereafter cannot be more than this, Surely we'll see that country after Time's farewell kiss. Who would his lovely faith condole? Who envies not the Red-skin's soul,  Sailing into the cloud land, sailing into the sun, Into the crimson portals ajar when life is done? O! dear dead race, my spirit too Would fain sail westward unto you.    IN THE SHADOWS   I am sailing to the leeward, Where the current runs to seaward     Soft and slow, Where the sleeping river grasses Brush my paddle as it passes     To and fro.  On the shore the heat is shaking All the golden sands awaking     In the cove; And the quaint sand-piper, winging O'er the shallows, ceases singing     When I move.  On the water's idle pillow Sleeps the overhanging willow,     Green and cool; Where the rushes lift their burnished Oval heads from out the tarnished     Emerald pool.  Where the very silence slumbers, Water lilies grow in numbers,     Pure and pale; All the morning they have rested, Amber crowned, and pearly crested,     Fair and frail.  Here, impossible romances, Indefinable sweet fancies,     Cluster round; But they do not mar the sweetness Of this still September fleetness     With a sound.  I can scarce discern the meeting Of the shore and stream retreating,     So remote; For the laggard river, dozing, Only wakes from its reposing     Where I float.  Where the river mists are rising, All the foliage baptizing     With their spray; There the sun gleams far and faintly, With a shadow soft and saintly,     In its ray.  And the perfume of some burning Far-off brushwood, ever turning     To exhale All its smoky fragrance dying, In the arms of evening lying,     Where I sail.  My canoe is growing lazy, In the atmosphere so hazy,     While I dream; Half in slumber I am guiding, Eastward indistinctly gliding     Down the stream.    NOCTURNE   Night of Mid-June, in heavy vapours dying, Like priestly hands thy holy touch is lying Upon the world's wide brow; God-like and grand all nature is commanding The \"peace that passes human understanding\"; I, also, feel it now.  What matters it to-night, if one life treasure I covet, is not mine! Am I to measure The gifts of Heaven's decree By my desires? O! life for ever longing For some far gift, where many gifts are thronging, God wills, it may not be.  Am I to learn that longing, lifted higher, Perhaps will catch the gleam of sacred fire That shows my cross is gold? That underneath this cross--however lowly, A jewel rests, white, beautiful and holy, Whose worth can not be told.  Like to a scene I watched one day in wonder:-- A city, great and powerful, lay under A sky of grey and gold; The sun outbreaking in his farewell hour, Was scattering afar a yellow shower Of light, that aureoled  With brief hot touch, so marvellous and shining, A hundred steeples on the sky out-lining, Like network threads of fire; Above them all, with halo far outspreading, I saw a golden cross in glory heading A consecrated spire:  I only saw its gleaming form uplifting, Against the clouds of grey to seaward drifting, And yet I surely know Beneath the seen, a great unseen is resting, For while the cross that pinnacle is cresting, An Altar lies below.         .        .        .        .        .  Night of Mid-June, so slumberous and tender, Night of Mid-June, transcendent in thy splendour Thy silent wings enfold And hush my longing, as at thy desire All colour fades from round that far-off spire, Except its cross of gold.    MY ENGLISH LETTER   When each white moon, her lantern idly swinging,   Comes out to join the star night-watching band, Across the grey-green sea, a ship is bringing   For me a letter, from the Motherland.  Naught would I care to live in quaint old Britain,   These wilder shores are dearer far to me, Yet when I read the words that hand has written,   The parent sod more precious seems to be.  Within that folded note I catch the savour   Of climes that make the Motherland so fair, Although I never knew the blessed favour   That surely lies in breathing English air.  Imagination's brush before me fleeing,   Paints English pictures, though my longing eyes Have never known the blessedness of seeing   The blue that lines the arch of English skies.  And yet my letter brings the scenes I covet,   Framed in the salt sea winds, aye more in dreams I almost see the face that bent above it,   I almost touch that hand, so near it seems.  Near, for the very grey-green sea that dashes   'Round these Canadian coasts, rolls out once more To Eastward, and the same Atlantic splashes   Her wild white spray on England's distant shore.  Near, for the same young moon so idly swinging   Her threadlike crescent bends the selfsame smile On that old land from whence a ship is bringing   My message from the transatlantic Isle.  Thus loves my heart that far old country better,   Because of those dear words that always come, With love enfolded in each English letter   That drifts into my sun-kissed Western home.     CANADIAN BORN  (The following poems are from the author's second book, \"Canadian Born,\" first published in 1903.)    CANADIAN BORN   We first saw light in Canada, the land beloved of God; We are the pulse of Canada, its marrow and its blood: And we, the men of Canada, can face the world and brag That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.  Few of us have the blood of kings, few are of courtly birth, But few are vagabonds or rogues of doubtful name and worth; And all have one credential that entitles us to brag-- That we were born in Canada beneath the British flag.  We've yet to make our money, we've yet to make our fame, But we have gold and glory in our clean colonial name; And every man's a millionaire if only he can brag That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.  No title and no coronet is half so proudly worn As that which we inherited as men Canadian born. We count no man so noble as the one who makes the brag That he was born in Canada beneath the British flag.  The Dutch may have their Holland, the Spaniard have his Spain, The Yankee to the south of us must south of us remain; For not a man dare lift a hand against the men who brag That they were born in Canada beneath the British flag.    WHERE LEAPS THE STE. MARIE   I  What dream you in the night-time   When you whisper to the moon? What say you in the morning?   What do you sing at noon? When I hear your voice uplifting, Like a breeze through branches sifting, And your ripples softly drifting   To the August airs a-tune.  II  Lend me your happy laughter,   Ste. Marie, as you leap; Your peace that follows after   Where through the isles you creep. Give to me your splendid dashing, Give your sparkles and your splashing, Your uphurling waves down crashing,   Then, your aftermath of sleep.    HARVEST TIME   Pillowed and hushed on the silent plain, Wrapped in her mantle of golden grain,  Wearied of pleasuring weeks away, Summer is lying asleep to-day,--  Where winds come sweet from the wild-rose briers And the smoke of the far-off prairie fires;  Yellow her hair as the goldenrod, And brown her cheeks as the prairie sod;  Purple her eyes as the mists that dream At the edge of some laggard sun-drowned stream;  But over their depths the lashes sweep, For Summer is lying to-day asleep.  The north wind kisses her rosy mouth, His rival frowns in the far-off south,  And comes caressing her sunburnt cheek, And Summer awakes for one short week,--  Awakes and gathers her wealth of grain, Then sleeps and dreams for a year again.    LADY LORGNETTE   I  Lady Lorgnette, of the lifted lash,   The curling lip and the dainty nose, The shell-like ear where the jewels flash,   The arching brow and the languid pose, The rare old lace and the subtle scents,   The slender foot and the fingers frail,-- I may act till the world grows wild and tense,   But never a flush on your features pale. The footlights glimmer between us two,--   You in the box and I on the boards,-- I am only an actor, Madame, to you,   A mimic king 'mid his mimic lords, For you are the belle of the smartest set,              Lady Lorgnette.  II  Little Babette, with your eyes of jet,   Your midnight hair and your piquant chin, Your lips whose odours of violet   Drive men to madness and saints to sin,-- I see you over the footlights' glare   Down in the pit 'mid the common mob,-- Your throat is burning, and brown, and bare,   You lean, and listen, and pulse, and throb; The viols are dreaming between us two,   And my gilded crown is no make-believe, I am more than an actor, dear, to you,   For you called me your king but yester eve, And your heart is my golden coronet,              Little Babette.    LOW TIDE AT ST. ANDREWS   (NEW BRUNSWICK)  The long red flats stretch open to the sky, Breathing their moisture on the August air. The seaweeds cling with flesh-like fingers where The rocks give shelter that the sands deny; And wrapped in all her summer harmonies St. Andrews sleeps beside her sleeping seas.  The far-off shores swim blue and indistinct, Like half-lost memories of some old dream. The listless waves that catch each sunny gleam Are idling up the waterways land-linked, And, yellowing along the harbour's breast, The light is leaping shoreward from the west.

PREFACE  _The Story of \"Mormonism\"_ as presented in the following pages is a revised and reconstructed version of lectures delivered by Dr. James E. Talmage at the University of Michigan, Cornell University, and elsewhere.  The \"Story\" first appeared in print as a lecture report in the _Improvement Era_, and was afterward issued as a booklet from the office of the _Millennial Star_, Liverpool.  In 1910 it was issued in a revised form by the Bureau of Information at Salt Lake City, in which edition the lecture style of direct address was changed to the ordinary form of essay.  The present or third American edition has been revised and amplified by the author.  The \"Story\" has been translated and published abroad.  Already versions have appeared in Swedish, modern Greek, and Russian.  The subject matter of _The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\"_ was first presented as a lecture delivered by Dr. Talmage before the Philosophical Society of Denver.  It appeared later in the columns of the _Improvement Era_, and translations have been published in pamphlet form in the Danish and German languages.  The present publication of these two productions is made in response to a steady demand.                                                   THE PUBLISHERS.  Salt Lake City, Utah, March, 1914.    THE STORY OF \"MORMONISM\"    CHAPTER I  In the minds of many, perhaps of the majority of people, the scene of the \"Mormon\" drama is laid almost entirely in Utah; indeed, the terms \"Mormon question\" and \"Utah question\" have been often used interchangeably.  True it is, that the development of \"Mormonism\" is closely associated with the history of the long-time Territory and present State of Utah; but the origin of the system must be sought in regions far distant from the present gathering-place of the Latter-day Saints, and at a period antedating the acquisition of Utah as a part of our national domain.  The term \"origin\" is here used in its commonest application--that of the first stages apparent to ordinary observation--the visible birth of the system.  But a long, long period of preparation had led to this physical coming forth of the \"Mormon\" religion, a period marked by a multitude of historical events, some of them preceding by centuries the earthly beginning of this modern system of prophetic trust.  The \"Mormon\" people regard the establishment of their Church as the culmination of a great series of notable events.  To them it is the result of causes unnumbered that have operated through ages of human history, and they see in it the cause of many developments yet to appear. This to them establishes an intimate relationship between the events of their own history and the prophecies of ancient times.  In reading the earliest pages of \"Mormon\" history, we are introduced to a man whose name will ever be prominent in the story of the Church--the founder of the organization by common usage of the term, the head of the system as an earthly establishment--one who is accepted by the Church as an ambassador specially commissioned of God to be the first revelator of the latter-day dispensation.  This man is Joseph Smith, commonly known as the \"Mormon\" prophet.  Rarely indeed does history present an organization, religious, social, or political, in which an individual holds as conspicuous and in all ways as important a place as does this man in the development of \"Mormonism.\" The earnest investigator, the sincere truth-seeker, can ignore neither the man nor his work; for the Church under consideration has risen from the testimony solemnly set forth and the startling declarations made by this person, who, at the time of his earliest announcements, was a farmer's boy in the first half of his teens.  If his claims to ordination under the hands of divinely commissioned messengers be fallacious, forming as they form the foundation of the Church organization, the superstructure cannot stand; if, on the other hand, such declarations be true, there is little cause to wonder at the phenomenally rapid rise and the surprising stability of the edifice so begun.  Joseph Smith was born at Sharon, Vermont, in December, 1805.  He was the son of industrious parents, who possessed strong religious tendencies and tolerant natures.  For generations his ancestors had been laborers, by occupation tillers of the soil; and though comfortable circumstances had generally been their lot, reverses and losses in the father's house had brought the family to poverty; so that from his earliest days the lad Joseph was made acquainted with the pleasures and pains of hard work. He is described as having been more than ordinarily studious for his years; and when that powerful wave of religious agitation and sectarian revival which characterized the first quarter of the last century, reached the home of the Smiths, Joseph with others of the family was profoundly affected.  The household became somewhat divided on the subject of religion, and some of the members identified themselves with the more popular sects; but Joseph, while favorably impressed by the Methodists in comparison with others, confesses that his mind was sorely troubled over the contemplation of the strife and tumult existing among the religious bodies; and he hesitated.  He tried in vain to solve the mystery presented to him in the warring factions of what professed to be the Church of Christ.  Surely, thought he, these several churches, opposed as they are to one another on what appear to be the vital points of religion, cannot all be right. While puzzling over this anomaly he chanced upon this verse in the epistle of St. James:      \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that     giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and     it shall be given him.\"  In common with so many others, the earnest youth found here within the scriptures, admonition and counsel as directly applicable to his case and circumstances as if the lines had been addressed to him by name.  A brief period of hesitation, in which he shrank from the thought that a mortal like himself, weak, youthful, and unlearned, should approach the Creator with a personal request, was followed by a humble and contrite resolution to act upon the counsel of the ancient apostle.  The result, to which he bore solemn record (testifying at first with the simplicity and enthusiasm of youth, afterward confirming the declaration with manhood's increasing powers, and at last voluntarily sealing the testimony with his life's blood,) proved most startling to the sectarian world--a world in which according to popular belief no new revelation of truth was possible.  It is a surprising fact that while growth, progress, advancement, development of known truths and the acquisition of new ones, characterize every living science, the sectarian world has declared that nothing new must be expected as direct revelation from God.  The testimony of this lad is, that in response to his supplication, drawn forth by the admonition of an inspired apostle, he received a divine ministration; heavenly beings manifested themselves to him--two, clothed in purity, and alike in form and feature.  Pointing to the other, one said, \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him.\"  In answer to the lad's prayer, the heavenly personage so designated informed Joseph that the Spirit of God dwelt not with warring sects, which, while professing a form of godliness, denied the power thereof, and that he should join none of them.  Overjoyed at the glorious manifestation thus granted unto him, the boy prophet could not withhold from relatives and acquaintances tidings of the heavenly vision.  From the ministers, who had been so energetic in their efforts to convert the boy, he received, to his surprise, abuse and ridicule.  \"Visions and manifestations from God,\" said they, \"are of the past, and all such things ceased with the apostles of old; the canon of scripture is full; religion has reached its perfection in plan, and, unlike all other systems contrived or accepted by human kind, is incapable of development or growth. It is true God lives, but He cares not for His children of modern times as He did for those of ancient days; He has shut Himself away from the people, closed the windows of heaven, and has suspended all direct communication with the people of earth.\"  The persecution thus originating with those who called themselves ministers of the gospel of Christ spread throughout the community; and the sects that before could not agree together nor abide in peace, became as one in their efforts to oppose the youth who thus testified of facts, which though vehemently denounced, produced an effect that alarmed them the more.  And such a spectacle has ofttimes presented itself before the world--men who cannot tolerate one another in peace swear fidelity and mutual support in strife with a common opponent. The importance of this alleged revelation from the heavens to the earth is such as to demand attentive consideration.  If a fact, it is a full contradiction of the vague theories that had been increasing and accumulating for centuries, denying personality and parts to Deity.  In 1820, there lived one person who knew that the word of the Creator, \"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness,\" had a meaning more than in metaphor.  Joseph Smith, the youthful prophet and revelator of the nineteenth century, knew that the Eternal Father and the well-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, were in form and stature like unto perfect men; and that the human family was in very truth of divine origin.  But this wonderful vision was not the only manifestation of"]]]
