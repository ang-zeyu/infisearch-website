He had glanced behind him, because he wanted--quite naturally--to look at that long line of lights twinkling through the night. And to his distress he saw that Freddie Firefly's relations were flying helter-skelter in all directions. They had bolted out of the line and were dancing off across the meadow after a fashion that no torchlight procession ought to follow.  \"Stop! Stop!\" Chirpy Cricket called.  Even as he spoke, as many as a dozen lights flashed past him and went flittering on across the fields.  Really, the only ones besides Chirpy that had stayed in the line as they should were Mehitable Moth, who still carried her banner right behind him, and Freddie Firefly, who sat on top of the banner.  And even Freddie Firefly was becoming restless. When he saw his brothers and cousins go dancing off in the dark he couldn't help wanting to dance too.  \"You'd better hurry!\" he said to Chirpy Cricket. \"Those fellows--\" he pointed to the dozen that had just passed them--\"those fellows have got ahead of you. And it looks to me very much as if you were out of line.\"  Chirpy Cricket stared at Freddie Firefly in astonishment.  \"Do you think so?\" he exclaimed. \"I don't see how it happened.\"  \"Neither do I!\" Freddie Firefly said. \"But if I'm to stay in the procession I certainly can't sit on this banner any longer. And besides, if I'm going to call on Farmer Green's wife I shall have to travel faster than we're moving now.\"  Since they were then standing stock-still in the meadow, there was a good deal of truth in what Freddie Firefly said.  \"But you don't need to call on Mrs. Green!\" Chirpy Cricket cried. \"That's not your banner, you know. It belongs to Mehitable Moth.\"  \"I'm afraid Mrs. Green has heard I'm coming; and I don't want to disappoint her,\" Freddie replied.  And then he sprang from his perch and went zigzagging away.  One might think that Chirpy Cricket would have been quite upset by the breaking up of his torchlight procession. But being naturally cheerful, he merely smiled and said that it was plain that the Fireflies were a very flighty family.     VIII  BUSTER'S SCHEME   About the time summer was half gone, Buster Bumblebee's mother, the Queen, began to worry. She was afraid her workers were not going to make enough honey for her family's needs.  Then came a few days of steady rain, when the workers of the Bumblebee family couldn't venture away from home, on account of getting their wings wet. And of course the Queen was terribly upset.  \"I don't know what to do!\" she kept exclaiming. \"The days are already growing shorter. It's a pity the honeymakers can't work in the dark.\"  Buster Bumblebee happened to hear his mother talking in that fashion with some of the older members of the family. And he spoke up at once and said:  \"I know of a plan that might help.\"  Nobody paid the slightest attention to his remark, because the whole family thought that Buster was not only fat and lazy, but somewhat stupid as well.  \"I know of something you could do that would help,\" he persisted, in a much louder voice. \"The honey-makers could work after dark if you'd only get the Firefly family to furnish lights for them.\"  A number of Buster's relations snickered when they heard his plan. It struck them as being too silly for anything. But his mother, the Queen, looked very thoughtful.  \"I'm not sure but that this boy has a good idea,\" she observed, much to the surprise of the others. \"For a long time I've been waiting for him to say something worth listening to. And now I do believe he has had a happy thought at last.\" She turned to Buster. \"How did you chance upon this scheme?\" she asked him.  \"Oh, the notion just came to me. I didn't have to WORK, to think of it,\" Buster explained. And he wondered why everybody laughed.  You know, Buster Bumblebee was so lazy that he never would lift a finger to do a stroke of work. And now the word \"work\" had a very funny sound, coming from his mouth.  \"How could we get the Firefly family to help us? Have you thought of a way to do that?\" Buster's mother said to her son.  \"N-no, I haven't,\" he admitted. \"But I'd go straight to Freddie Firefly and tell him what's wanted.\"  \"Suppose you do that, then,\" said the Queen.  \"You wouldn't call that WORKING, would you?\" Buster inquired anxiously. Having long since promised himself that he would never work, of course he didn't want to break his word.  His relations--that is, except his mother--couldn't help tittering when Buster said that. But to tell the truth, they were beginning to be the least bit jealous of Buster Bumblebee and his plan. When the Queen frowned at them severely, each of them tried to look as if it had been somebody else that laughed.  Then the Queen assured Buster that paying a call on a person couldn't be said to be work.  \"You go and talk with Freddie Firefly,\" she directed him, \"and if your plan proves to be a success, it will then be your turn to laugh at others.\"     IX  FREDDIE'S PROMISE   Buster Bumblebee did not find Freddie Firefly very easily. It was a sunny afternoon; and if Freddie was flashing his bright light, Buster was unable to see it. But at last he spied Freddie eating a meal of pollen in the meadow.  \"How would you like to work for my mother, the Queen?\" Buster asked him.  \"I don't believe I'd care to, thank you,\" Freddie Firefly answered, with a mouth so full of food that Buster heard him only with great difficulty.  \"I'll wait a moment, until you have finished your lunch,\" said Buster.  \"You'd better not!\" Freddie Firefly told him. \"It will be dark by that time. And Chirpy Cricket tells me your family always goes to bed at sunset.\"  \"So we do!\" Buster agreed. \"But my mother, the Queen, is going to order her honey-makers to work overtime for the present. And she wants you and your family to furnish lights so they can see what they're doing.\" \"Oh! That's different!\" Freddie Firefly exclaimed. \"I thought she wanted me to help make honey. And that's something I know nothing about. ... But when it comes to furnishing a light, I'm certainly a shining success.\" Freddie then laughed heartily. And much to his surprise, Buster Bumblebee gave him several hard slaps on the back, which hurt him not a little.  \"Don't do that!\" Freddie Firefly cried.  \"I thought you were choking,\" Buster, explained.  Freddie Firefly shook his head.  \"I was joking,\" he said.  \"Well, I didn't make much of a mistake; for joking and choking sound about the same,\" Buster Bumblebee replied.  \"I hope your mother's honey-makers can tell the difference,\" Freddie Firefly grumbled. \"If they can't, I certainly don't care to spend a night in their company.\"  \"Oh, you won't have any trouble with them. They'll be working so busily that they'll hardly notice you,\" Buster Bumblebee assured him.  So Freddie Firefly promised to be at the house of the Bumblebee family, in the meadow, at dusk. And he said he would try to bring plenty of his relations with him, so that there might be one of them to light the way for each of the honey-makers.  And then Buster Bumblebee hurried away to tell his mother the news.  The Queen praised Buster for what he had done, telling him that in her opinion he would soon be the wisest person in Pleasant Valley--not even excepting old Mr. Crow and Solomon Owl.  Buster was so pleased that he made up his mind to stay awake that evening, in order to see the workers start out for the clover field after dark with Freddie Firefly and his relations. But when sunset came, Buster simply couldn't keep from falling asleep.  Not until the next morning did he know how his plan had turned out. And since it proved to be less successful than he had expected, perhaps it was just as well that he was not present to hear the remarks that were made about him.  Even Freddie Firefly said things about Buster that night that would not have been at all pleasant to listen to.     X  DRAWING LOTS   Buster Bumblebee's mother told her forty-nine honey-makers that Freddie Firefly and at least forty-eight of his relations were expected at the Bumblebees' house at dusk.  \"Each of the Fireflies will furnish each of you with a light,\" the Queen explained, \"so you'll be able to go to the clover field almost as easily as you do in the daytime. You're to work until midnight. And after that you may sleep until the trumpeter wakes you at dawn.\"  The Queen's announcement did not please the honey-makers in the least. They were an ill-tempered lot, anyhow. And when things did not go to suit them they sometimes made themselves most disagreeable.  Of course they didn't dare grumble in the Queen's hearing. But behind her back they spoke their minds quite freely.  \"It's all the fault of that boy Buster,\" they told one another. \"If he hadn't suggested his horrid plan to his mother we wouldn't have to work half the night and lose half our sleep.\"  \"I wish he was here now!\" one of the honey-makers exclaimed fiercely. \"I'd make it hot for him!\"  Usually the honey-makers began to grow very drowsy at that time of day (it was then late in the afternoon). But now they were so angry that they were not the least bit sleepy. Their own buzzing kept them awake. And the Queen was glad that it was so, because she herself never could have stopped so many of them from going to sleep. And even then, if the truth must be known, the Queen wished that she might go to bed. Never in all her life had she been up so late before.  \"I wish the Fireflies would hurry!\" she exclaimed as she stood at the front-door of her house and looked across the fast darkening field.  As she watched anxiously, the Queen soon spied a light, which kept growing brighter and brighter, until at last Freddie Firefly dropped down before her. He took off his cap and made a low bow.  \"Here I am, Queen!\" he said.  \"Where's the rest of your family?\" Buster Bumblebee's mother asked him.  \"They all had to go to a dance down by the swamp,\" Freddie Firefly explained. \"They wanted me to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5727"],["title","The Tale of Freddie Firefly (#3)"],["body","with them; but I had promised your son that I'd be here at dusk. And of course I wouldn't think of breaking my promise.\"  Well, the Queen was terribly disappointed.  \"You never can furnish enough light for my forty-nine workers!\" she cried.  \"Perhaps not!\" Freddie admitted. \"But I'd be glad to take one of them to the clover-patch to-night, just as a trial, you know.\"  The Queen said that that was a good idea. And the honey-makers, who had come outside the house, all agreed that it was a fine suggestion. But not one of them wanted to go with Freddie.  \"Then you'll have to draw lots,\" the Queen told them severely.  When the honey-makers heard that, one of them tried to slip away. But the Queen saw her and called her back.  Then they drew lots. And strange to say, the worker who had tried to escape proved to be the unlucky one who was doomed to go to the clover field with Freddie Firefly and gather clover nectar until midnight.  Unluckily for Freddie, she was the worst-tempered person in the whole Bumblebee household. And when she saw that she alone of the whole family was going to lose half her night's sleep you may be sure she felt very surly.  Freddie noticed a wicked gleam in her eyes. And he began to wish he had gone to the dance over near the swamp.     XI  PEPPERY POLLY   Freddie Firefly felt quite uncomfortable as he started off toward the clover field, together with the angry honey-maker. It had not made him feel any more at ease when the Queen of the Bumblebees told him the worker's name. It was Peppery Polly.  \"Don't go too fast!\" Peppery Polly told Freddie Firefly. \"And I'll tell you now that I'll make it warm for you if you try to play any tricks on me to-night.\"  As a matter of fact, Freddie hadn't thought of such a thing as playing a single trick on her. But Peppery Polly's warning at once put that very idea into his head. So he began to try to think of a good joke that would bother her. And before they had crossed the meadow Freddie Firefly turned to Peppery Polly Bumblebee and said:  \"That light off there must be in the farmhouse.\"  Now, never having been out at night before, his companion wanted to see all the strange sights. So she stopped at once and looked around.  \"How bright the light is!\" she said. \"Are you sure the farmhouse isn't on fire?\"  Not receiving any answer, she turned her head. And to her dismay, she couldn't see Freddie Firefly anywhere.  \"Oh! Oh! Where are you?\" she cried. She was terribly frightened to be left alone in the dark. \"Come back--please come back!\" she begged.  \"Why, here I am!\" said Freddie Firefly.  And wheeling about quickly, Peppery Polly found him clinging to a blade of grass right behind her.  Freddie had been hiding under a plantain leaf, so that she couldn't see his light. But Peppery Polly didn't know what had happened.  \"Did your light go out?\" she inquired anxiously.  \"If it did, I never noticed it,\" he replied.  \"Well, don't you dare to leave me alone, no matter what happens!\" Peppery Polly Bumblebee cried. \"If you did, I'd never be able to find my way home in the dark.\"  \"Don't worry!\" Freddie said. \"You're perfectly safe with me. ... What I'm wondering is whether I'm perfectly safe with you.\"  \"You are--so long as you behave yourself,\" she declared. \"But remember! I'll make it hot for you if you try any tricks on me! Don't forget that I carry a sting! And what's more, I know how to use it.\"  Her threat, however, failed to frighten Freddie Firefly. As soon as he saw that his companion was afraid of the dark, he ceased to be afraid of her. So he flashed his light impudently in her eyes.  \"Come on!\" he urged her with a grin which she could not see. \"Let's get to the clover field, for I like to see people work.\"  \"You do, eh?\" snapped Peppery Polly.  \"Yes! Watching others work is play for me,\" he remarked cheerfully. \"And I hope to have as much fun to-night as I would have had if I'd gone to the dance over near the swamp.\"  \"Are you fond of music?\" Peppery Polly asked him suddenly.  \"Am I?\" he exclaimed. \"I should say I was!\"  \"Then tell me how you like this,\" she said. And she began to sing the most terrible song that Freddie Firefly had ever heard in all his life.     XII  A TERRIBLE SONG   It was no wonder that Freddie Firefly grew uneasy again as he listened to the song of Peppery Polly Bumblebee, while they flew towards the clover field through the darkness. The chorus, especially, filled him with alarm. And he shuddered as the disagreeable honey-maker sang it:   \"I've never learned to take a joke;     So if you try to trick me,   My sting in you I'll quickly poke--     You'll find that it will prick ye!   It feels like fire--though twice as hot.   And I would rather sting than not!\"  \"How do you like that?\" Peppery Polly inquired, after she had finished her song.  \"You have a beautiful voice,\" Freddie Firefly hastened to tell her.  \"Yes--of course!\" she agreed. \"But I refer to the words. What do you think of them?\"  \"I think they're awful!\" Freddie Firefly cried; for his companion had scared the truth out of him before he stopped to think how it would sound.  \"Quite right!\" said Peppery Polly. \"I made up that song. And I flatter myself it's about the worst I ever heard.\" To Freddie Firefly's relief, she seemed quite pleased.  He was able to draw a deep breath again as they reached the field of red clover, where Peppery Polly Bumblebee settled quickly upon a clover-top and began sucking up the sweet nectar with her long tongue. For some time she worked busily without saying a word. And indeed, how could she have spoken with her tongue buried deep in the heart of a clover blossom?  But when she withdrew her tongue and flitted from one clover-top to another, she never failed to fix her wicked eyes on Freddie Firefly and demand \"more light--and be quick about it!\"  Since no harm had yet fallen him, he began to wonder after a while if Peppery Polly's bark was not worse than her bite--or perhaps it would be better to say that he wondered if her song was not worse than her sting. Anyhow, he knew that he was very tired of her masterful way of speaking to him. And he soon determined to play another trick on her.  \"Here's a big blossom you haven't tasted!\" he called to her suddenly. And Peppery Polly--thinking that Freddie meant a clover blossom--hastened to a bloom that Freddie pointed out to her.  She settled upon it quickly. And the next moment Peppery Polly gave a sharp cry of mingled rage and pain.  \"What's the matter?\" Freddie Firefly asked her.  \"Matter!\" she exclaimed. \"It's a thistle--and I've pricked myself badly.\"  \"Why, so it is a thistle blossom!\" said Freddie Firefly. \"It's about the same color as a clover head; and I suppose you didn't know the difference in the dark.\"  \"The question is, did YOU know the difference?\" Peppery Polly screamed--for she was terribly angry.  \"Really, I must decline to answer when you speak to me in such a tone,\" said Freddie Firefly. And he was quite surprised that the furious honey-maker didn't dart towards him and try to sink her sting into him.  But nothing of the sort happened. And Freddie soon saw that Peppery Polly was in some kind of trouble.     XIII  CAUGHT BY A THISTLE   \"You'll have to help me,\" Peppery Polly Bumblebee said to Freddie Firefly through the darkness. \"If you'd been a little less stingy with that light of yours I wouldn't have made the mistake of thinking this thistle was a clover blossom.\"  \"Well, there's nectar in it, isn't there?\" he inquired.  \"I suppose so,\" she answered. \"But I can't get it. And I'm so daubed with the sticky stuff that's spread right where I put my feet that I can't free myself.\"  Freddie flew quite close to her and flashed his light upon her. And he saw that she had spoken truly.  \"What a pity!\" he exclaimed.  \"Don't stop to talk!\" the honey-maker snapped. \"Just help me to get away from this thistle. And THEN you can talk all you want to. In fact, I'll give you something to talk about.\"  Freddie Firefly was not so dull-witted but that he knew she intended to punish him for sending her to the thistle blossom.  \"I'll go back to your house and bring somebody to help you, if I can,\" he said. \"Don't you see that it wouldn't be safe for me to try to pull you loose? I might get stuck there myself. And we'd be prisoners for the rest of the night.\"  Peppery Polly hadn't thought of that. And she was inclined to believe that there might be some such danger.  \"You may go for help,\" she said at last. \"But please remember that there's no time to lose. The Queen won't like it at all when she hears about this accident, for she expected me to fetch home a good deal of nectar before midnight.\"  \"I'll hurry. And I'll be back as soon as I can bring one of your fellow-workers with me,\" Freddie Firefly promised.  Since he was a person of his word, he went straight back to the home of the Bumblebee family in the meadow. Being used to finding his way about after dark, Freddie had no trouble reaching the Bumblebees' home. But rousing the household was an entirely different matter. Though he pounded his hardest at their door, none of the Bumblebee family heard him. Having always slept from sunset till dawn without once waking, they were wrapped in such heavy slumber that not one of them knew what was going on.  To be sure, the family trumpeter--who awakened the household each morning and was a somewhat lighter sleeper than the others--the trumpeter claimed afterward that she DREAMED that she heard somebody at the door that night. But that was all the good that came of Freddie Firefly's efforts.  After trying his best to rouse Peppery Polly's people, Freddie Firefly at last grew discouraged. He saw that the Bumblebee family was bound to sleep until dawn came, no matter what happened.  He reflected, then, that there were two things he could do. He could go back alone to the clover field and try to set that ill-tempered worker free--and no doubt get stung by her for his pains. Or he could go"]]]
