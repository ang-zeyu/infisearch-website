He graduated two years later. I wonder if they knew each other. Mr. Harold would have been a youngster, and your father a first-classman, and first-classmen HAVE been known to notice youngsters.\"  Peggy looked puzzled. Although she had always lived within ten miles of the Academy, she had never entered its gates, and knew nothing of its ways or rules. Polly was wiser, having spent a month with her aunt. She laughed as she explained:  \"A first-classman is a lordly being who is generally at odds with a second-classman, but inclined to protect a third-classman, or youngster, simply because the second-classman is inclined to make life a burden for him, just as he in turn is ready to torment the life out of a fourth- classman, or plebe. I am just beginning to understand it. It seemed perfectly ridiculous at first, but I guess some of those boys are the better for the running they get. I've only been here since the first of October, but I've learned a whole lot in four weeks. Maybe you will come over to see us some time and you will understand better then.\"  \"I'd love to, I am sure. But may I offer you something more? No? Then perhaps we would better go down to the paddock.\"  They stepped from the piazza and walked through the beautifully kept garden. On either side late autumn flowers were blooming, the box hedges were a deep, waxen green, and gave forth a rich, aromatic odor. Polly cried:  \"I just can't believe that you--you--why that you are the mistress of all this. I don't believe you can be one bit older than I am.\"  \"I was fourteen last January,\" answered Peggy simply.  \"And I fifteen last August,\" cried Polly with the frankness of her years.  \"Then you are exactly five months older than I am, aren't you?\" Peggy's smile was wonderfully winning.  \"And when I look at all this and hear you talk I feel just about five YEARS YOUNGER,\" was Polly's frank reply. \"Why I've never done a single thing in my life.''  \"Not one?\" asked Mrs. Harold, smiling significantly.  \"Oh well, nothing like all THIS,\" protested Polly.  They had now reached a large inclosure. At the further end were a number of low buildings, evidently stables. Nearer at hand, outside the inclosure, were larger buildings--barns and offices. The inclosure was still soft and green in its carpeting of turf and patches of clover. Eight or ten horses were running at large, free and halterless. Further on was another inclosure in which several brood mares were grazing quietly or frisking about with, their colts. Some had come to the high paling to gaze inquiringly at the strangers.  \"Oh, Tanta, Tanta, just look at them,\" cried Polly in a rapture. \"And which is to be mine?\"  \"None of those spindle-legs yonder,\" was Peggy's amused answer. \"They will be running at large for a long time yet. I don't even begin training them until they are a year old--at least not in anything but loving and obeying me. But most of them learn that very quickly. You must look in this paddock for Silver Star, Miss Polly. Shall I call him?\"  \"Will he really come?\" asked Polly incredulously.  For answer Peggy slipped into the paddock, saying as she shot back the bolt:  \"We used to have a much simpler fastening, but they learned how to undo it and make their escape. For that reason we are obliged to have these high fences. They have a strain of hunter blood and a six-foot barrier doesn't mean much to some of them.\"  How bonny the girl looked as she stood there. The horses which were in a little group near the buildings at the opposite end of the paddock, raised their heads inquiringly. The girl gave a long, clear whistle which was instantly answered by a chorus of loud neighs, as the group broke into a mad gallop and bore down upon her. It seemed to Mrs. Harold and Polly as though the on-rushing creatures must bear her down, but just when the speed was the maddest, when heads were tossing most wildly, and tails and manes waving like banners, Peggy cried:  \"Halt! Steady, my beauties!\" and as one the beautiful animals came to a standstill their hoofs stirring up a cloud of dust, so suddenly did they brace their forefeet. The next second they were crowding around her, nuzzling her hair, her shoulders, her hands, evidently begging in silent eloquence for some expected dainty.  Peggy carried a small linen bag. She opened it and instantly the air was filled with the soft, bubbling whinny with which a horse begs.  \"Quiet, Meteor. Be patient, Don. Wait, Queen. Oh, Shashai, will you never learn manners?\" she cried as her pet stretched his long neck and catching the little bag in his teeth snatched it from her hands, then, with all the delight of a child who has played a clever trick, away he dashed across the paddock.  \"Shashai! Shashai, how dare you! Halt!\" she called after him, but the graceful creature had no idea of halting.  For a moment Peggy looked at her guests very much as a baffled schoolmistress might look in the event of her pupil's open defiance, then cried:  \"This will never, never do. If he disobeys me once I shall never be able to do anything with him again. Please excuse me a moment. I must catch him.\"  \"Are you in the habit of chasing whirlwinds?\" asked Mrs. Harold laughing.  \"You must be able to run faster than most people,\" laughed Polly, but even as she spoke Peggy cried:  \"Star! Star! Come.\" And out from the group slipped a superb chestnut. He came close to the girl, slipping his beautiful head across her shoulder and nestling against her face with the affection of a child. She clasped her arm up around the satiny neck and said softly:  \"We must catch Shashai, Star,\" then turning like a flash, she rested one hand lightly upon his withers, gave a quick spring and sat astride the horse's back.  Polly gave a little cry and clasped her hands, her eyes sparkling with delight at this marvelous equestrian feat. Mrs. Harold was too amazed to speak.  \"After him! Four bells, Star,\" cried Peggy, and away rushed the pair as though horse and rider were one creature, Peggy's divided cloth skirt, which up to that moment Mrs. Harold had not noticed, fluttering back to reveal the nattiest little patent leather riding boots imaginable. It was one of the prettiest pictures Mrs. Harold and Polly had ever beheld.  But that race was not to end so quickly. Shashai boasted the same blood as Silver Star, and was every bit as intelligent as his older brother. Moreover he had no mind to give up his treasure-trove. He knew that little bag and its contents too well and was minded to carry it to the end of the paddock and there rend and tear it, until its contents were spilled and he could eat his companions' share as well as his own. And that was exactly what Peggy did not propose to permit, either for his well-being or in justice to the other pets.  As the extraordinary game of tag ranged around the big paddock, Polly fairly danced up and down in excitement, crying:  \"Tanta, Tanta, I didn't know any one COULD ride like that girl. Why it is more wonderful than a circus. And isn't she beautiful? Oh, I want to know her better. I am sure she must be a perfect dear. Why if I could ever ride half as well I'd be the proudest girl in the world.\"  \"And how simply and unostentatiously she does everything. Polly, I suspect we shall be the richer for several things besides a handsome horse when we return to Wilmot.\"  Meanwhile Peggy was bearing down upon the thief and his plunder, though he darted and dodged like a cat, but in an unguarded moment he gave Star the advantage and was cornered.  \"Shashai, halt! Steady. Down. My pardon.\"  Never was human speech more perfectly understood and obeyed. The game was up and the superb horse stopped, dropped upon his knees and touched the ground with his muzzle, the bag still held in his teeth.  \"Up, Shashai,\" and the horse was again upon his feet.  Peggy reached over and taking hold of his flowing forelock led him back to the gate. Nothing could have been more demure than the manner in which he minced along beside her. At the gate Peggy slipped from Star's back as snow slips from a sunny bank, and stretching forth her hand said:  \"Give it to me, Shashai.\"  The mischievous colt dropped the bag into her hand.  \"Good boy,\" and a caress rewarded the reformed one.  Then Polly's enthusiasm broke forth.  How had she ever done it? Who had taught her to ride like that? Could she, Polly, ever hope to do so?  Peggy laughed gaily, and explained Shelby's methods as best she could, giving a little outline of her life on the estate which held a peculiar interest for Mrs. Harold, who read more between the lines than Peggy guessed, and who then and there resolved to know something more of this unusual girl to whose home they had been so curiously led. She had been thrown with young people all her life and loved them dearly, and here to her experienced eyes was a rare specimen of young girlhood and her heart warmed to her.  \"I'd give anything to ride as you do,\" said Polly quite in despair of ever doing so.  \"Why I can't remember when I haven't ridden. Shelby put me on a horse when Mammy Lucy declared I was too tiny to sit in a chair, and oh, how I love it and them. It is all so easy, so free--so--I don't quite know how to express it. But I must not take any more of your time talking about myself. Please excuse me for having talked so much. I wanted you to see Silver Star's paces but I did not plan to show them in just this way. But isn't he a dear? I don't know how I can let him go away from Severndale, but he as well as the others must. We sent Columbine only a few days ago. She has the sweetest disposition of any horse I have ever trained. It nearly broke my heart to send her off. They are all relatives. Shashai and Star are half-brothers. Shashai is my very own and I shall never sell him. Would you like to try Star, Miss Polly? I can get you a riding skirt. Shall you ride cross or side?

As the Fairfield family consisted of only three members, the meeting was not large but it was highly enthusiastic. The discussion was about Patty; and as a consequence, Patty herself was taking a lively part in it.  \"But you promised me, last year, papa,\" she said, \"that if I graduated from the Oliphant School with honours, I needn't go to school this year.\"  \"But I meant in the city,\" explained her father; \"it's absurd, Patty, for you to consider your education finished, and you not yet eighteen.\"  \"But I'll soon be eighteen, papa, and so suppose we postpone this conversation until then.\"  \"Don't be frivolous, my child. This is a serious matter, and requires careful consideration and wise judgement.\"  \"That's so,\" said Nan, \"and as I have already considered it carefully, I will give you the benefit of my wise judgment.\"  Though Nan's face had assumed the expression of an owl named Solomon, there was a smile in her eyes, and Patty well knew that her stepmother's views agreed with her own, rather than with those of her father.  It was the last week in September, and the Fairfields were again in their pleasant city home after their summer in the country.  Patty and Nan were both fond of city life, and were looking forward to a delightful winter. Of course Patty was too young to be in society, but there were many simple pleasures which she was privileged to enjoy, and she and Nan had planned a series of delightful affairs, quite apart from the more elaborate functions which Nan would attend with her husband.  But Mr. Fairfield had suddenly interfered with their plans by announcing his decision that Patty should go to college.  This had raised such a storm of dissension from both Nan and Patty that Mr. Fairfield so far amended his resolution as to propose a boarding-school instead.  But Patty was equally dismayed at the thought of either, and rebelled at the suggestion of going away from home. And as Nan quite coincided with Patty in her opinions on this matter, she was fighting bravely for their victory against Mr. Fairfield's very determined opposition.  All her life Patty had deferred to her father's advice, not only willingly, but gladly; but in the matter of school she had very strong prejudices. She had never enjoyed school life, and during her last year at Miss Oliphant's she had worked so hard that she had almost succumbed to an attack of nervous prostration. But she had persevered in her hard work because of the understanding that it was to be her last year at school; and now to have college or even a boarding-school thrown at her head was enough to rouse even her gentle spirit.  For Patty was of gentle spirit, although upon occasion, especially when she felt that an injustice was being done, she could rouse herself to definite and impetuous action.  And as she now frankly told her father, she considered it unjust after she had thought that commencement marked the end of her school life, to have a college course sprung upon her unaware.  But Mr. Fairfield only laughed and told her that she was incapable of judging what was best for little girls, and that she would do wisely to obey orders without question.  But Patty had questioned, and her questions were reinforced by those of Nan, until Mr. Fairfield began to realise that it was doubtful if he could gain his point against their combined forces. And indeed a kind and indulgent father and husband is at a disadvantage when his opinion is opposed to that of his pretty, impulsive daughter and his charming, impulsive wife.  So, at this by no means the first serious discussion of the matter, Mr. Fairfield found himself weakening, and had already acknowledged to himself that he might as well prepare to yield gracefully.  \"Go on, Nan,\" cried Patty, \"give us the benefit of your wise judgment\"  \"Why, I think,\" said Nan, looking at her husband with an adorable smile, which seemed to assume that he would agree with her, \"that a college education is advisable, even necessary, for a girl who expects to teach, or indeed, to follow any profession. But I'm quite sure we don't look forward to that for Patty.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. Fairfield; \"I can't seem to see Patty teaching a district school how to shoot; neither does my imagination picture her as a woman doctor or a lady lawyer. But to my mind there are occasions in the life of a private citizeness when a knowledge of classic lore is not only beneficial but decidedly ornamental.\"  \"Now, papa,\" began Patty, \"I'm not going to spend my life as a butterfly of fashion or a grasshopper of giddiness, and you know it; but all the same, I can't think of a single occasion where I should be embarrassed at my ignorance of Sanscrit, or distressed at the fact that I was unacquainted personally with the statutes of limitation.\"  \"You're talking nonsense, Patty, and you know it. The straight truth is, that you don't like school life and school restraint. Now some girls enjoy the fun and pleasures of college life, and think that they more than compensate for the drudgery of actual study.\"  \"'An exile from home, pleasure dazzles in vain,'\" sang Patty, whose spirits had risen, for she felt intuitively that her father was about to give up his cherished plans.  \"I think,\" went on Nan, \"after you have asked for my valuable advice, you might let me give it without so many interruptions. I will proceed to remark that I am still of the opinion that there are only two reasons why a girl should go to college: Because she wants to, or because she needs the diploma in her future career.\"  \"Since you put it so convincingly, I have no choice but to agree with you,\" said her husband, smiling. \"However, if I eliminate the college suggestion, there still remains the boarding-school. I think that a superior young ladies' finishing school would add greatly to the advantages of our Patty.\"  \"It would finish me entirely, papa; your college scheme is bad enough, but a 'finishing school,' as you call it, presents to my fancy all sorts of unknown horrors.\"  \"Of course it does,\" cried Nan. \"I will now give you some more of my wise advice. A finishing school would be of no advantage at all to our Patty. I believe their principal end and aim is to teach young ladies how to enter a room properly. Now I have never seen Patty enter a room except in the most correct, decorous, and highly approved fashion. It does seem foolish then to send the poor child away for a year to practise an art in which she is already proficient.\"  \"You two are one too many for me,\" said Mr. Fairfield, laughing. \"If I had either of you alone, I could soon reduce you to a state of meek obedience; but your combined forces are too much for me, and I may as well surrender at once and completely.\"  \"No; but seriously, Fred, you must see that it is really so. Now what Patty needs in the way of education, is the best possible instruction in music, which she can have better here in New York than in any college; then she ought to go on with her French, in which she is already remarkably proficient. Then perhaps an hour a day of reading well-selected literature with a competent teacher, and I'll guarantee that a year at home will do more for Patty than any school full of masters.\"  Mr. Fairfield looked at his young wife in admiration. \"Why, Nan, I believe you're right,\" he said, \"though I don't believe it because of any change in my own opinions, but because you put it so convincingly that I haven't an argument left.\"  Nan only smiled, and went on.  \"You said yourself, Fred, that Patty disliked the routine and restraint of school life, and so I think it would be cruel to force her into it when she can be so much happier at home. Here she will have ample time for all the study I have mentioned, and still have leisure for the pleasures that she needs and deserves. I shall look after her singing lessons myself, and make sure that she practises properly. Then I shall take her to the opera and to concerts, which, though really a part of her musical education, may also afford her some slight pleasure.\"  Patty flew over to Nan and threw her arms about her neck. \"You dear old duck,\" she cried; \"there never was such a dear, lovely, beautiful stepmother on the face of the earth! And now it's all settled, isn't it, papa?\"  \"It seems to be,\" said Mr. Fairfield, smiling. \"But on your own heads be the consequences. I put Patty into your hands now, so far as her future education is concerned, and you can fix it up between you. To tell the truth, I'm delighted myself at the thought of having Patty stay home with us, but my sense of duty made me feel that I must at least put the matter before her.\"  \"And you did,\" cried Patty gleefully, \"and now I've put it behind me, and that's all there is about that. And I'll promise, papa, to study awfully hard on my French and music; and "]]]
