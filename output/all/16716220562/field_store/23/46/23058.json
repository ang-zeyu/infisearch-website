His stern, inexorable nature seemed to her worthy of hate, yet for three whole years the longing for him scarcely left her heart at peace an hour.  During this whole period she had not met him.  Not until after she had come to Augsburg, where Loni's company was to give several performances before the assembled Reichstag, did she see him again.  Once she even succeeded in attracting his gaze, and this was done in a way which afforded her great satisfaction.  His beautiful wife, clad in costly velvet robes, was walking by his side with eyes decorously downcast; but he had surely recognised her--there was no doubt of that.  Yet he omitted to inform his wife, even by a look, whom he had met here.  Kuni watched the proud couple a long time, and, with the keen insight of a loving heart, told herself that he would have pointed her out to Frau Katharina, if he did not remember her in some way--either in kindness or in anger.  This little discovery had sufficed to transfigure, as it were, the rest of the day, and awaken a throng of new hopes and questions.  Even now she did not desire to win Frau Katharina's husband from her. She freely acknowledged that the other's beauty was tenfold greater than her own; but whether the gifts of love which the woman with the cloudless, aristocratic composure could offer to her husband were not like the beggar's pence, compared with the overflowing treasure of ardent passion which she cherished for Lienhard, was a question to which she believed there could be but a single answer.  Was this lady, restricted by a thousand petty scruples, as well as by her stiff, heavy gala robes, a genuine woman at all?  Ah! if he would only for once cast aside the foolish considerations which prevented him also from being a genuine man, clasp her, whom he knew was his own, in his arms, and hold her as long as he desired, he should learn what a strong, free, fearless woman, whose pliant limbs were as unfettered as her heart, could bestow upon him to whom she gave all the love that she possessed!  And he must want something of her which was to be concealed from the wife.  She could not be mistaken.  She had never been deceived in a presentiment that was so positive.  Ever since she reached Augsburg, an inner voice had told her-- and old Brigitta's cards confirmed it--that the destiny of her life would be decided here, and he alone held her weal and woe in his hand.  Yet she had misinterpreted his conduct to his wife.  In spite of the finery which Kuni owed to the generosity of the Knight of Neckerfels, who was then a suitor for her favour, Lienhard had recognised her.  The sight recalled their last meeting and its painful termination, and therefore he had omitted to attract Frau Katharina's attention to her immediately. But, ere Kuni disappeared, he had repaired the oversight, and both desired to ascertain the fate of their former charge.  True, the wish could not be instantly fulfilled, for Lienhard's time and strength were wholly claimed by the mission intrusted to him by the Emperor and the Council.  The next afternoon Kuni ascended the rope to the steeple in the presence of many princes and dignitaries.  Firmly as ever she moved along the rope stretched through the wooden stay behind her, holding the balancing pole as she went.  The clapping of hands and shouts of applause with which the crowd greeted \"the flying maiden\" led her to kiss her hand to the right and the left, and bow to the stand which had been erected for the crowned heads, counts, nobles, and their wives.  In doing so, she looked down at the aristocratic spectators to ascertain whether the Emperor and one other were among them.  In spite of the height of the topmost window of the steeple where she stood, her keen eyes showed her that Maximilian's seat was still vacant.  As it was hung with purple draperies and richly garlanded, the monarch was evidently expected.  This pleased her, and her heart throbbed faster as she saw on the stand all the nobles who were entitled to admittance to the lists of a tournament, and, in the front row, the man whose presence she most desired.  At Lienhard's right sat his dazzlingly beautiful wife, adorned with plumes and the most superb gold ornaments; at his left was a maiden of extremely peculiar charm. According to years she was still a child, but her delicate, mobile features had a mature expression, which sometimes gave her a precocious air of superiority.  The cut of her white robe and the little laurel wreath on her brown curls reminded Kuni of the pagan Genius on an ancient work of marble which she had seen in Verona.  Neither the girl's age nor her light, airy costume harmonized with her surroundings; for the maids and matrons near her were all far beyond childhood, and wore the richest holiday costumes of heavy brocades and velvets.  The huge puffs on the upper part of the sleeves touched the cheeks of many of the wearers, and the lace ruffs on the stiff collars rendered it easy, it is true, to maintain their aristocratic, haughty dignity, but prevented any free, swift movement.  The young girl who, as Kuni afterward learned, was the daughter of Conrad Peutinger, of Augsburg, whom she had again seen that day in The Blue Pike, was then eleven years old.  She was sometimes thought to be fifteen or even sixteen; her mobile face did not retain the same expression a single instant.  When the smile which gave her a childlike appearance vanished, and any earnest feeling stirred her soul, she really resembled a mature maiden.  What a brilliant, versatile intellect must animate this remarkable creature!  Lienhard, shrewd and highly educated as he was, seemed to be completely absorbed in his neighbour; nay, in his animated conversation with her he entirely forgot the beautiful wife at his side; at least, while Kuni looked down at him, he did not bestow a single glance upon her.  Now he shook his finger mischievously at the child, but he seemed to be seeking, in mingled amusement and perplexity, to find a fitting answer.  And how brightly Lienhard's eyes sparkled as he fairly hung upon the sweet red lips of the little marvel at his left--the heart side!  A few minutes had sufficed to show the ropedancer all this, and suggest the question whether it was possible that the most faithful of husbands would thus basely neglect, for the sake of a child, the young wife whom he had won in spite of the hardest obstacles, on whose account he had so coldly and cruelly rejected her, the object of so much wooing, and who, this very day, was the fairest of all the beautiful ladies who surrounded her.  In an instant her active mind transported her to the soul of the hitherto favoured wife of the man whom she loved, and her strangely constituted woman's heart filled with resentment against the young creature below, who had not even attained womanhood, and yet seemed to gain, without effort, the prize for which she had vainly striven with painful longing.  She, whose heart had remained free from jealousy of the woman who stood between her and the man she loved, like a solid bulwark erected by Fate itself, was now suddenly overmastered by this passion.  Yet she did not turn against the person to whom Lienhard belonged, as he did to the city, or to his own family, and who was united to him by the will of Heaven, but against the mysterious young creature at his side, who changed with every passing moment.  This child--no, this maiden--must be a being of some special nature. Like the sirens of whom she had heard, she possessed the mysterious, enviable power of conquering the iron resistance of even the strongest man.  Like a flash of lightning, Kuni, whose kind heart cherished resentment against few and wished no one any evil, suddenly felt an ardent desire to drive the little witch from Lienhard's side, even by force, if necessary. Had she held a thunderbolt instead of a balance pole, she would gladly have struck down the treacherous child from her height--not only because this enchantress had so quickly won that for which she had vainly yearned, alas! how long, but because it pierced her very heart to see Frau Katharina's happiness clouded, nay, perhaps destroyed.  A bitterness usually alien to her light, gay nature had taken possession of her, as, with the last glance she cast at Lienhard, she saw him bend low over the child and, with fiery ardour, whisper something which transformed the delicate pink flush in her cheeks to the hue of the poppy.  Yes, the ropedancer was jealous of the laurel-crowned child.  She, who cared so little for law and duty, virtue and morality, now felt offended, wounded, tortured by Lienhard's conduct.  But there was no time to ponder over the reason now.  She had already delayed too long ere moving forward.  Yet even calm reflection would not have revealed the right answer to the problem.  How could she have suspected that what stirred her passionate soul so fiercely was grief at the sight of the man whom she had regarded as the stronghold of integrity, the possessor of the firmest will, the soul of inviolable fidelity, succumbing here, before the eyes of all, like a dissolute weakling, to the seductive arts of an immature kobold? These two, who gave to her, the orphaned vagrant, surrounded by unbridled recklessness, physical and mental misery, a proof that there was still in marriage real love and a happiness secure from every assault, were now, before her eyes, placing themselves on the same plane with the miserable couples whom she met everywhere.  She could not have expressed her emotions in words, but she vaguely felt that the world had become poorer, and that henceforth she must think of something more trivial when she tried to imagine the pure happiness which mortals are permitted to enjoy. She had seen the blossoms stripped from the scanty remnant of her faith in truth and goodness, which had begun to bloom afresh in her heart through the characters of this pair whose marriage"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5585"],["title","In the Blue Pike â€” Volume 02 (#4)"],["body","she had watched.  Loni had been beckoning a long time; now he waved his gay handkerchief still more impatiently, and she moved on.  Her lips forced themselves into the customary smile with difficulty. Tripping forward was an easy matter for one so free from dizziness.  She only carried the pole because it was customary to begin with the least difficult feats.  Yet, while gracefully placing one foot before the other, she said to herself--safe as she felt--that, while so much agitated, she would be wiser not to look down again into the depths below.  She did avoid it, and with a swift run gained the end of the rope without effort, and went up and down it a second time.  While, on reaching the end of her walk, she was chalking her soles again, the applause which had accompanied her during her dangerous pilgrimage still rose to her ears, and came-most loudly of all from the stand where Lienhard sat among the distinguished spectators.  He, too, had clapped his hands lustily, and shouted, \"Bravo!\"  Never had he beheld any ropedancer display so much grace, strength, and daring.  His modest protegee had become a magnificently developed woman.  How could he have imagined that the unfortunate young creature whom he had saved from disgrace would show such courage, such rare skill?  He confided his feelings, and the fact that he knew the artist, to his young neighbour, but she had turned deadly pale and lowered her eyes. While looking on she had felt as though she herself was in danger of falling into the depths.  Giddiness had seized her, and her heart, whose tendency to disease had long awakened the apprehension of the physicians, contracted convulsively.  The sight of a fellow-being hovering in mortal peril above her head seemed unendurable.  Not until she followed Lienhard's advice and avoided looking up, did she regain her calmness. Her changeful temperament soon recovered its former cheerfulness, and the friend at her side to whom the lovely child, with her precocious mental development, appeared like the fairest marvel, took care, often as he himself looked upward, that she should be guarded from a second attack of weakness.  The storm of applause from below, in which Lienhard also joined, fanned the flames of desire for admiration in Kuni's breast to a fiery glow. She would show him, too, what she could do--compel him to applaud her. She would force him away from the little temptress, and oblige him to gaze up at her whose art--she learned this daily--possessed the power to fix the attention of spectators like the thrall of the basilisk's eye. When on the rope she was no insignificant personage.  He should tremble for her as did the gray-haired, scarred captain of the foot soldiers, Mannsbach, the day before yesterday.  He had told her that his heart had throbbed more anxiously during her daring feats than on the bloodiest field of battle.  She moved forward more swiftly to the time of the lively dancing tune which the city pipers were playing.  Midway along the rope she turned, ran back to the cross-shaped trestle at the steeple window, handed the balancing pole to Loni, and received a cage filled with doves.  Each one bore around its neck a note containing an expression of homage to the Emperor Maximilian, and they were all trained to alight near the richly decorated throne which was now occupied by the chivalrous monarch.  The clown who, with a comical show of respect, offered her what she needed for her next feat, told her this.  Loni, sure of being heard by no unbidden ear, called to her from the window:  \"Art is honoured to-day, my girl.\"  The clown added jocosely:  \"Who else was ever permitted to walk over the anointed head of our lord the Emperor?\"  But Kuni would not have needed such encouragement.  Doubtless she felt flattered by the consciousness of attracting even the sovereign's glance, but what she intended to do immediately was for the purpose of compelling another person to watch her steps with fear and admiration.  Crossing her feet, she threw back her garlanded head and drew a long breath.  Then she hastily straightened herself, and with the bird cage in one hand and the winged staff of Mercury, which the clown had handed to her, in the other, she advanced to the centre of the rope.  There she opened the cage as steadily as if she had been standing on the floor of her own room.  The birds fluttered through the little door and went, with a swift flight, directly to their goal.  Then, below and beside her, from every place occupied by spectators, and from hundreds of windows, rose thunders of applause; but it seemed to her as if the roaring of the surging sea was in her ears.  Her heart throbbed under her pink silk bodice like an iron hammer, and in the proud consciousness of having probably attained already what she desired, and, besides thousands of other eyes, fixed Lienhard's upon her as if with chains and bonds, she was seized with the ambitious desire to accomplish something still more amazing.  The man to whom her heart clung, the Emperor, the countless multitude below, were all at this time subject to her in heart and mind.  They could think and feel nothing except what concerned her, her art, and her fate.  She could and would show to Lienhard, to the Emperor, to all, what they had never witnessed.  They should turn faint with sympathizing anxiety.  She would make then realize what genuine art, skill, and daring could accomplish. Everything else, even the desire for applause, was forgotten.  Though her performance might be called only a perilous feat, she felt it to be true, genuine art.  Her whole soul was merged in the desire to execute, boldly and yet gracefully, the greatest and most perfect performance attainable by a ropedancer.  With beads of perspiration on her brow, and eyes uplifted, she threw the cage aside, swung her Mercury staff aloft, and danced along the rope in waltz time, as though borne by the gods of the wind.  Whirling swiftly around, her slender figure darted in graceful curves from one end of the narrow path to the other.  Then the applause reached the degree of enthusiastic madness which she desired; even Loni clapped his hands from the steeple window.  She had never seen him do this to any of the company.  Yes, she must have accomplished her purpose well; but she would show him and the others something still more wonderful.  What she had just done was capable of many additional feats; she had tried it.  With fluttering hands and pulses she instantly loosed from her panting bosom and her hips the garland of roses and leaves twined about the upper portion of her body, and swung it around her in graceful curves as she knelt and rose on the rope.  She had often jumped rope on the low rope, turning completely around so that she faced the other way.  To repeat this performance on the one stretched to the steeple would certainly not be expected from her or from any other.  Suppose she should use the garland as a rope and venture to leap over it on this giddy height?  Suppose she should even succeed in turning around?  The rope was firm.  If her plan was successful, she would have accomplished something unprecedented; if she failed--if, while turning, she lost her balance--her scanty stock of pleasure here below would be over, and also her great grief and insatiable yearning.  One thing was certain: Lienhard would watch her breathlessly, nay, tremble for her.  Perhaps it was too much to hope that he would mourn her sincerely, should the leap cost her life; but he would surely pity her, and he could never forget the moment of the fall, and therefore herself. Loni would tear the gold circlet from his dyed black locks and, in his exaggerated manner, call himself a son of misfortune, and her the greatest artist who had ever trodden the rope.  All Augsburg, all the dignitaries of the realm, even the Emperor, would pity her, and the end of her life would be as proud and as renowned as that of the chivalrous hero who dies victor on the stricken field.  If the early part of her life had been insignificant and wretched, its close should be grand and beautiful.  Long consideration was foreign to Kuni's nature.  While these thoughts were darting with the speed of lightning through her excited brain, she stripped from the garland, with the presence of mind which her calling teaches even in serious peril, the roses which might have caught her feet, and swung it in a wide circle above her.  Then nimbly, yet careful to maintain in every movement the grace without which the most difficult feat would have seemed to her valueless, she summoned all the strength and caution she possessed, went forward at a run, and--she did not know herself just how it was done--dared the leap over the rope once, twice, and the third and fourth time even accomplished the turn successfully. It had not once cost her an effort to maintain her balance.  Again she saw Loni clapping his hands at the window, and the acclamations of the crowd, which echoed like peals of thunder from the lofty, gable- roofed houses, informed her that the boldness of the venture and the skill with which she had performed it were appreciated by these spectators.  True, she could not distinguish the voice of any individual, but she thought she knew that Lienhard was one of those who shouted \"Bravo!\" and clapped most loudly.  He must have perceived now that she was something more than a poor thief of a rosary, a useless bread-eater in the Schurstab household.  She straightened the garland again and, while preparing to take another run, repeat the feat, and, if her buoyancy held out, try to whirl around twice, which she had never failed to accomplish on the low rope, she could not resist the temptation of casting a hasty glance at Lienhard; she had never ascended to the steeple without looking at him.  Secure of herself, in the glad conciousness of success, she gazed down.  There sat the illustrious Maximilian, still clapping his"]]]
