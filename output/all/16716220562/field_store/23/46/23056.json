He was a good man who would not hurt a fly.  Yet, when he heard things and opinions which his mother had taught him to hold sacred assailed, he could become as angry as a savage brute.  The little impious blasphemer Eberbach, especially, he would have been more than ready to lash with the best hazel rod which he had ever cut for his dead father.  But honest anger affords a certain degree of enjoyment, so it was anything rather than agreeable to him to be called away.  The feather curler and his table companions wanted Kitzing wine, but it was in the cellar, and a trip there would have detained him too long from his post of listener.  So he turned angrily back into the room, and told the business men that princes, bishops, and counts were satisfied with the table wine of The Blue Pike, which had been already served to them, and the sceptre and crozier were of more importance than their twisted feathers.  \"Those are not the wisest people,\" he added sagely, \"who despise what is good to try to get better.  So stick to the excellent Blue Pike wine and say no more about it!\"  Without waiting for an answer from the astonished guests, he limped back to his window to resume his listening.  The conversation, however, had already taken a new turn, for Dr. Peutinger was describing the Roman monument which he had had put up in the courtyard of his Augsburg house, but, as this interested Dietel very little, he soon turned his attention to the high road, whence a belated guest might still come to The Blue Pike.  The landlady's little kitchen garden lay between it and the river Main, and there--no, it was no deception--there, behind the low hawthorn hedge, a human figure was moving.  One of the vagabonds had certainly slipped into the garden to steal fruit or vegetables, or even honey from the bee hives.  An unprecedented offence!  Dietel's blood boiled, for the property of The Blue Pike was as dear to him as his own.  With prompt decision he went through the entry into the yard, where he meant to unchain the butcher's dog to help him chase the abominable robber.  But some time was to elapse ere he could execute this praiseworthy intention; for before he could cross the threshold the landlord of The Pike appeared, berated him, and ordered him to be more civil in the performance of his duties.  The words were intended less for the waiter than for the feather dealer and his friends.  The latter had complained of Dietel to the landlord of The Pike, and, after he had received a reproof, they punished him for his rudeness by ordering him to fetch one jug of wine from the cellar after another.  At last, when, with many a malediction, he had brought up the fifth, his tormentors released him, but then the best time was lost.  Nevertheless he continued the pursuit and entered the little garden with the dog, but the thief had fled.  After assuring himself of this fact he stood still, rubbing his narrow forehead with the tips of his fingers.  The rogue was most probably one of the vagrants, and like a flash it entered his mind that the ropedancer, Kuni, who in her prosperous days, instead of eating meat and vegetables, preferred to satisfy her appetite with fruits and sweet dainties, might be the culprit.  Besides, when he had looked around among the guests just before, she was no longer with the other vagabonds.  Certain of having found the right trail, he instantly went to the window below which the strollers lay, thrust his head into the room from the outside, and waked the wife of the tongueless swearer.  She had fallen asleep on the floor with the sewing in her hand.  The terror with which she started up at his call bore no favourable testimony to her good conscience, but she had already recovered her bold unconcern when he imperiously demanded to know what had become of lame Kuni.  \"Ask the  other travellers--the soldiers, the musicians, the monks, for aught I care,\" was the scornful, irritating answer.  But when Dietel angrily forbade such insolent mockery, she cried jeeringly:  \"Do you think men don't care for her because she has lost her foot and has that little cough?  You ought to  know better.  \"Master Dieter has a sweetheart for every finger, though the lower part of his own body isn't quite as handsome as it might be.\"  \"On account of my foot?\" the waiter answered spitefully.  \"You'll soon find that it knows how to chase.  Besides, the Nuremberg city soldiers will help me in the search.  If you don't tell me at once where the girl went--by St. Eoban, my patron----\"  Here red-haired Gitta interrupted him in a totally different tone; she and her companions had nothing good to expect from the city soldiers.  In a very humble manner she protested that Kuni was an extraordinarily charitable creature.  In a cart standing in the meadow by the highroad lay the widow of a beggar, Nickel; whom the peasants had hung on account of many a swindling trick.  A goose and some chickens had strayed off to his premises.  The woman had just given birth to twins when Nickel was hung, and she was now in a violent fever, with frequent attacks of convulsions, and yet had to nurse the infants.  The landlady of The Pike had sent her some broth and a little milk for the children.  As for Kuni, she had gone to carry some linen from her own scanty store to the two babies, who were as naked as little frogs.  He would find her with the sick mother.  All this flowed from Gitta's lips with so much confidence that Dietel, whose heart was easily touched by such a deed of charity, though he by no means put full confidence in her, allowed himself to be induced to let the city soldiers alone for the present and test the truth of her strange statement himself.  So he prepared to go in search of the cart, but the landlord of The Pike met him at the door, and, angrily asking what ailed him that day, ordered him to fetch the Erbach, more of which was wanted inside.  Dietel went down into the cellar again, but this time he was not to leave it so speedily, for the apprentice of a Nuremberg master shoemaker, whose employer was going to the Frankfort fair with his goods, and who made common cause with the feather dealer, stole after Dietel, and of his own volition, for his own pleasure, locked him in.  The good Kitzing wine had strengthened his courage.  Besides, experience taught him that an offence would be more easily pardoned the more his master himself disliked the person against whom it was committed.

D.W.]      IN THE BLUE PIKE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 2.    CHAPTER IV.  The ropedancer, Kuni, really had been with the sick mother and her babes, and had toiled for them with the utmost diligence.  The unfortunate woman was in great distress.  The man who had promised to take her in his cart to her native village of Schweinfurt barely supported himself and his family by the tricks of his trained poodles.  He made them perform their very best feats in the taverns, under the village lindens, and at the fairs.  But the children who gazed at the four-footed artists, though they never failed to give hearty applause, frequently paid in no other coin.  He would gladly have helped the unfortunate woman, but to maintain the wretched mother and her twins imposed too heavy a burden upon the kind-hearted vagabond, and he had withdrawn his aid.  Then the ropedancer met her.  True, she herself was in danger of being left lying by the wayside; but she was alone, and the mother had her children.  These were two budding hopes, while she had nothing more to expect save the end--the sooner the better.  There could be no new happiness for her.  And yet, to have found some one who was even more needy than she, lifted her out of herself, and to have power to be and do something in her behalf pleased her, nay, even roused an emotion akin to that which, in better days, she had felt over a piece of good fortune which others envied.  Perhaps she herself might be destined to die on the highway, without consolation, the very next day; but she could save this unhappy woman from it, and render her end easier.  Oh, how rich Lienhard's gold coins made her!  Yet if, instead of three, there had been as many dozens, she would have placed the larger portion in the twins' pillows.  How it must soothe their mother's  heart!  Each one was a defence against hunger and want.  Besides, the gold had been fairly burning her hand.  It came from Lienhard.  Had it not been for Cyriax and the crowd of people in the room, she would have made him take it back--she alone knew why.  How did this happen?  Why did every fibre of her being rebel against receiving even the smallest trifle from the man to whom she would gladly have given the whole world?  Why, after she had summoned up courage and approached Lienhard to restore his gift, had she felt such keen resentment and bitter suffering when the landlord of The Blue Pike stopped her?  As she now seized his gold, it seemed as though she saw Lienhard before her.  She had already told Cyriax how she met the aristocratic Nuremberg patrician, a member of the ancient and noble Groland family, whom his native city had now made an ambassador so young.  But what secretly bound her to him had never passed her lips.  Once in her life she had felt something which placed her upon an equal footing with the best and purest of her sex--a great love for one from whom she asked nothing, nothing at all, save to be permitted to think of him and to sacrifice everything, everything for him--even life.  So strange had been the course of this love, that people would have doubted her sanity or her truthfulness had she described it to them.  While standing before St. Sebald's church in Nuremberg, the vision of the young Councillor's bride at first made a far stronger impression upon her mind than his own.  Then her gaze rested on Lienhard.  As he had chosen the fairest of women, the bride had also selected the tallest, most stately, and certainly the best and wisest of men.  During her imprisonment the image of this rare couple had been constantly before her.  Not until, through the young husband's intercession, she had regained her liberty, after he prevented her kissing his hand and, to soothe her, had stroked her hair and cheeks in the magistrate's room, did the most ardent gratitude take possession of her soul.  From this emotion, which filled heart and mind, a glowing wealth of other feelings had blossomed like buds upon a rosebush.  Everything in her nature had attracted her toward him, and the desire to devote herself to him, body and soul, shed the last drop of blood in her heart for him, completely ruled her.  His image rose before her day and night, sometimes alone, sometimes with his beautiful bride.  Not only to him, but to her also she would joyfully have rendered the most menial service, merely to be near them and to be permitted to show that the desire to prove her gratitude had become the object of her life.  When, with good counsel for the future, he dismissed her from the chief magistrate's room, he had asked her where she was to be found in case he should have anything to say to her.  It seemed as though, from mingled alarm and joy, her heart would stop beating.  If her lodgings, instead of an insignificant tavern, had been her own palace, she would gladly have opened all its gates to him, yet a feverish thrill ran through her limbs at the thought that he might seek her among her vagabond companions, and ask in return for his kindness what he would never have presumed to seek had she been the child of reputable parents, yet which, with mingled anger and happiness, she resolved not to refuse.  During the day and the night when she expected his visit, she had become aware that she, who had never cared for any man save for the gifts he bestowed, was fired with love for Lienhard.  Such ardent yearning could torture only a loving heart, yet what she felt was very unlike the love with which she was familiar in songs, and had seen in other girls; for she by no means thought with jealous rancour of the woman to whom he belonged, body and soul--his beautiful wife.  It rather seemed to her that she was his, and he would no longer be the same if he were separated from her, nay, as if her very love was hers also.  When she heard a noise outside of her little room she started, and eagerly as she yearned to see him, blissful as she thought it must be to sink upon his breast and offer him her lips to kiss, the bold ropedancer, who never cared for the opinions of others, could not shake off, even for a moment, the fear of wronging the fair wife who had a better right to him.  Instead of hating her, or even wishing to share the heart of the man she loved with his bride, she shrank from the approaching necessity of clouding her young happiness as though it were the direst misfortune.  Yet she felt that its prevention lay, not in her own hands, but in those of Fate.  Should it please Destiny to lead Lienhard to her and inspire him with a desire for her love, all resistance, she knew, would be futile.  So she began to repeat several paternosters that he might remain away from her.  But her yearning was so great that she soon desisted, and again and again went to the window with a fervent wish that he might come.  In the terrible tumult of her heart she had forgotten to eat or to drink since early morning, and at last, in the afternoon, some one knocked at the door, and the landlady called her.  While she was hurriedly smoothing her thick black hair and straightening her best gown, which she had put on for him in the morning, she heard the hostess say that Herr Groland of the Council was waiting for her downstairs.  Every drop of blood left her glowing cheeks, and the knees which never trembled on the rope shook as she descended the narrow steps.  He came forward to meet her in the entry, holding out his hand with open- hearted frankness.  How handsome and how good he was!  No one wore that look who desired aught which must be hidden under the veil of darkness. Ere her excited blood had time to cool, he had beckoned to her to follow him into the street, where a sedan chair was standing.  An elderly lady of dignified bearing looked out and met her eyes with a pleasant glance.  It was Frau Sophia, the widow of Herr Conrad Schurstab of the Council, one of the richest and most aristocratic noblewomen in the city.  Lienhard had told her about the charming prisoner who had been released and begged her to help him bring her back to a respectable and orderly life.  The lady needed an assistant who, now that it was hard for her to stoop, would inspect the linen closets, manage the poultry yard- her pride--and keep an eye on the children when they came to visit their grandmother.  So she instantly accompanied Lienhard to the tavern, and Kuni pleased her.  But it would have been difficult not to feel some degree of sympathy for the charming young creature who, in great embarrassment, yet joyously as though released from a heavy burden, raised her large blue eyes to the kind stranger.  It was cold in the street, and as Kuni had come out without any wrap, Frau Schurstab, in her friendly consideration, shortened the, conference. Lienhard Uroland had helped her with a few words, and when the sedan chair and the young Councillor moved down the street all the necessary details were settled.  The vagrant had bound herself and assumed duties, though they were very light ones.  She was to move that evening into the distinguished widow's house, not as a servant, but as the old lady's assistant.  Loni, the manager of the company of rope-dancers, had watched the negotiations from the taproom.  During their progress each of the three windows was filled with heads, but no one had been able to hear what was whispered in the street.  Just as the curious spectators were hoping that now they might perhaps guess what the aristocratic lady wanted with Kuni, the sedan chair began to move, and the young girl entered the hot room to tell Loni that she would leave the company that day forever.  \"In-de-e-ed?\"  Loni asked in astonishment, lifting the gold circlet which rested on his head.  Then he passed his hand through the coal-black hair"]]]
