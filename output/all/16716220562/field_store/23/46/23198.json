WHITNEY  Of the Council of the Twelve, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints   SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH: THE DESERET NEWS 1921    FOREWORD  Most of the contents of this volume appeared originally as a series of articles in Saturday issues of the Deseret Evening News, beginning October 26, 1918, and ending May 31, 1919. As stated by the News, these articles \"were designed to fill in some degree a spiritual void and meet a special need of those who were in the habit of attending Sunday services, but were denied that privilege by the prevalence of the influenza epidemic.\" That epidemic caused a suspension of public gatherings for several months, and even made necessary the postponement of one General Conference of the Church.  It was during this period of suspension that these contributions to the Church organ began. They were given place on the editorial page, and subsequently the News said of them: \"These 'Thoughts' have subserved a far more than temporary and passing purpose--they have stimulated study and deep reflection, and they have been greatly enjoyed and prized by the thoughtful reader everywhere.\"  Among those who uttered similar sentiments was President George H. Brimhall, of the Brigham Young University, who, in a letter to the author, expressed the hope that provision would be made for publication of the essays in book form, \"thus adding one more choice volume to Latter-day Saint literature, especially suited to the needs of students at home and missionaries abroad.\" Like expressions came from President Heber J. Grant, Senator Reed Smoot, President John A. Widtsoe, of the University of Utah, and many other prominent people.  In response to this cordial, widespread sentiment of appreciation, and under the sanction of the General Authorities of the Church, the \"Saturday Night Thoughts\" were compiled for republication, and the result is here presented.

PART ONE  OUR PLACE IN HISTORY    Saturday Night Thoughts    ARTICLE ONE.  _The Saturday Evening of Time._  _The Sixth Day._--Saturday, in Christian lands, is a day set apart for house-cleaning, a time for \"putting things to rights,\" in preparation for the Sabbath, the sacred day of rest. Preliminary to the condition of purity, order and quietness especially desirable on that day, the house, in domestic parlance, is \"upset\"--\"turned topsy-turvy.\" Furniture is moved and dusted, floors are scrubbed, windows cleaned, and stoves polished; the body is bathed, all rubbish burned, and everything done that ought to be done, so that when night is past and glorious morning dawns, the rising sun can smile approvingly on a renovated, sweet and wholesome scene, and the Lord's Day be kept, as He intended it should be, in cleanliness, which is \"next to godliness.\" Is there not something symbolical in all this--something suggestive of things higher?  _All Things Symbolical._--\"All things are in a scale,\" says Plato; \"and begin where we will, ascend and ascend. All things are symbolical; and what we call results are beginnings.\" [1] If this be true, then is there a symbolism in small things as well as in great, in endings as well as beginnings, including the ending and beginning of the week. Saturday and Sunday are both symbolical, each suggesting and pointing to something above and beyond.  _The World's Sabbath._--Who among men first recognized in the seventh day a symbol of Christ's Millennial reign, I know not. The reign itself was the theme of a revelation as early as the days of Enoch. [2] But it is obvious that the symbolism of the seventh day does not stand alone. The idea of a greater Sunday carries with it the idea of a greater Saturday, of which all lesser Saturdays are typical; a time of agitation, of strenuous toil and strife, during which all will be made ready for the blest sabbatic era, the period of universal peace. The World's Saturday Night must necessarily precede the World's Sunday Morning. [3]  _The Apocalyptic Book._--The symbolism of the Sabbath, and the symbolism of other days as well, is plainly indicated in the writings of Joseph Smith. In one place he says--or the Lord says through him: \"All things have their likeness, and are made to bear record of Me.\" [4] We need not be surprised, therefore, to find among the Prophet's teachings this--I quote now from his Key to the Apocalypse:  \"What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals? [5]  \"We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.  \"What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelations?  \"We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust of the earth; even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and judge all things--unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work in the beginning of the seventh thousand years--the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.\" [6]  Seven Great Days.--The \"days\" here referred to were not ordinary days of twenty-four hours each, based upon earth's diurnal revolutions. He who \"made the world\" before placing man upon it, had not then appointed unto Adam his reckoning. [7] They were not man's days, but God's days, each having a duration of a thousand years.  \"The book which John saw\" represented the real history of the world--what the eye of God has seen, what the recording angel has written; and the seven thousand years, corresponding to the seven seals of the Apocalyptic volume, are as seven great days during which Mother Earth will fulfill her mortal mission, laboring six days and resting upon the seventh, her period of sanctification. These seven days do not include the period of our planet's creation and preparation as a dwelling place for man. They are limited to Earth's \"temporal existence,\" that is, to Time, considered as distinct from Eternity.  _According to Kolob._--The Prophet's translation of the Book of Abraham explains that these greater days are \"after the time\" or according to the reckoning of Kolob, a mighty governing planet nearest the Celestial Throne, a planet revolving once in a thousand years. [8] This period, then, is a day upon Kolob. One might well suppose such a day to have figured in the warning given to Adam: \"In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die;\" [9] for Adam, after eating of the forbidden fruit, lived on to the age of nine hundred and thirty years. [10] St. Peter may have had the same thing in mind when he wrote: \"One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.\" [11]  _At the Week's End._--According to received chronology--admittedly imperfect, yet approximately correct--four thousand years, or four of the seven great days given to this planet as the period of its \"temporal existence,\" had passed before Christ was crucified; while nearly two thousand years "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56691"],["title","Saturday Night Thoughts (#1)"],["body","gone by since. Consequently, Earth's long week is now drawing to a close, and we stand at the present moment in the Saturday Evening of Time, at or near the end of the sixth day of human history. Is it not a time for thought, a season for solemn meditation? Morning will break upon the Millennium, the thousand years of peace, the Sabbath of the World!  _House-Cleaning in Progress._--Marvel not, therefore, that all things are in commotion. War, famine, pestilence, earthquake, tempest and tidal wave--these are among the predicted signs of the Savior's second coming. [12] Tyranny and wickedness must be overthrown, and the way prepared for Him who, though gracious and merciful to all, and forgiving to sinners who repent, \"cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.\" [13] Earth must be freed from oppression and cleansed from all iniquity. It is God's House; and He is coming to live in it, and to make of it a glorified mansion. House-cleaning is in progress, and Saturday's work must be done and out of the way, before the Lord of the Sabbath appears.

Moses 7:48, 61, 64.  3. \"Rabbinical commentators have expressed the opinion that after six millenniums of years, there will come a seventh, with rest and peace. Paul (2 Thess. 1:7) points to the coming of Christ as the time when the Saints would find 'rest;' and he also argues (Heb. 4:1-11) that there remaineth a 'rest' to the people of God. The word he uses means a 'sabbathism' or sabbath observance, and he refers to the coming of the Lord.\"--J. M. Sjodahl.  4. Moses 6:63.  5. Rev. 5 and 6.  6. D. and C. 77:6, 12.  7. Abr. 5:13.  8.

ARTICLE TWO.  _The Watch on the Tower._  _\"Haunted Houses.\"_--Several years since, a learned gentleman was lecturing in some of our Utah towns, taking for his theme \"Haunted Houses.\" That was his way of describing the situation of those who put faith in prophets, visions and revelations, as among the means whereby God communicates with man. He invited all such to come out of their \"haunted houses,\" and build for their souls \"more stately mansions,\" founded upon the rock of reason and scientific truth. The lecturer had special reference, of course, to the followers of the Prophet Joseph Smith.  _A Fundamental Belief._--A belief in prophets and in spiritual gifts, whereby come visions, revelations, and miraculous \"signs,\" following and confirming full and true belief, [1] is fundamental with the Latter-day Saints. We regard the founding of our Church as a fulfillment of prophecy, [2] and recognize in the decadence of long established systems of religion, a result of failure to be guided and governed by the teachings and warnings of men divinely inspired. \"Where there is no vision, the people perish.\" [3] Where there is no revelation, spiritual darkness reigns.  _Not a Chance World._--We are not living in a world of chance. Things do not occur haphazardly, without the care or cognizance of the omniscient and omnipotent Ruler. Not a sparrow falls to the ground without his notice. Design, not accident, governs the universe. Neither man nor Satan, though exercising to the full his free agency, can possibly thwart the Divine Will. With all their schemings and strivings, they are powerless to destroy or disarrange God's Plan, or to hinder the fulfillment of prophecy. All things, both the evil and the good, are overruled in a way to subserve one and the same great end--_What Eternal Wisdom decreed before the foundation of the world_.  _The Function of Prophecy._--The need for prophecy must be evident to any pious and reflective mind. Prophets are as watchmen on the tower, noting the time of night, telling of the approaching dawn. \"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.\" [4] This means, as I interpret it, that the all-wise Dispenser of human affairs will neither cause nor permit any event to take place, concerning which the world need to have fore-knowledge, until he has communicated with his chosen servants, his oracles among men, and has given them due notice of its approach.  To warn mankind of impending judgments; to prepare His people, and through them the world at large, for changes that must come in the carrying out of the divine program--changes necessary to human progress--is the function of those who see into the future and make known the word and will of the Universal Father.  _Time for Preparation._--Even without the Prophet Amos and his inspired utterance, we have every reason to feel assured, from what we know of the divine attributes, that God, in his dealings with man, harbors no intent to take what is known as \"a snap judgment.\" His object being to save, not to destroy, it is very far from his design that the world shall be caught unawares, that men or nations shall be involved in trouble of which they have had no warning, and for which, consequently, they could make no preparation. The promised sending of Elijah the Prophet \"before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord,\" was in order that certain things might be done which, if left undone, would cause that \"coming\" to \"smite the earth with a curse.\" [5]  Not that the Lord wishes to curse. His object, even in chastisement, is to bless. [6] But a want of preparedness can change a blessing into a curse. Messiah's glorious appearing will be a wonderful blessing to the earth and its inhabitants, provided they are made ready for it. But a lack of readiness on their part would convert the boon into a calamity. Hence the need of preparation and of previous notice. Whether weal or woe is wending its way earthward, it is only fair that men should be told of it in advance.  _The Supernatural Discredited._--But there is a proneness in human nature to discredit the Heaven-sent messenger. Almost invariably the supernatural is discounted, if not derided, by ultra-practical minds. All miracles are myths to the agnostic intellect. \"The natural man is an enemy to God.\"  _Dead Prophets Preferred._--Even those who revere the prophets of the past are tempted to ignore the prophets of the present. It seems natural to turn from What Is and bow down to What Has Been. Not only prophets, but poets, philosophers, and other wise and worthy teachers have been treated in this manner.    \"Seven cities claimed the birth of Homer, dead,   Through which the living Homer begged for bread.\"  The Savior reproved the pious unbelievers of his generation for \"garnishing the sepulchres of the righteous,\" the dead seers and revelators, and at the same time rejecting the living worthies, as their fathers had done before them. [7] A professed reverence for Moses and the old-time prophets was a prominent characteristic of those who spurned the greatest of all prophets, the very Son of God, concerning whom Moses and other seers had testified. And this same spirit, the spirit that crucified the Christ, has caused the martyrdom of His servants in all ages.  _Counterfeit and Genuine._--For the widely prevalent distrust felt toward men who come burdened with a message from on High, false prophets and the mischief they have wrought are largely responsible. But distrust, no less than credulity, can be overdone. Caution against imposition is commendable, but doubt that rejects truth is to be deprecated and condemned. All prophets are not false. There can be no counterfeit without a genuine; and to proclaim against the one is virtually to concede the existence of the other.  _A Test of Prophecy._--A simple and sure test of prophecy is furnished in the following passage of Holy Writ: \"When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously.\" [8] By this standard of judgment can be tested all that prophetic inspiration has ever uttered. Given enough time, \"the thing\" will clearly demonstrate whether or not it was \"spoken presumptuously.\"  _A Serious Situation._--Ponder upon this, ye who hear the testimonies of the Elders of Israel, preaching the restored Gospel of the Kingdom as a final witness to the nations. And when you see coming to pass, in these days of war, pestilence and calamity, the predictions of ancient and modern seers, give a thought, a serious thought to the situation. Ask yourselves if you can afford to be classed, either with those who look upon believers in spiritual gifts as deluded dupes living in \"haunted houses,\" or with those who extol the prophets of former ages, and persecute or ignore the prophets of the present time.

ARTICLE THREE.  _Concerning Names and Vocations._  _Is Not This The Farmer's Son?_--Some such paraphrase was probably in the mind, possibly upon the lips, of more than one opponent of the religion termed \"Mormonism,\" when its supposed author, Joseph Smith, started out upon his remarkable career. And it was deemed by them, no doubt, a sufficient answer to his extraordinary claims.  _True and False Standards._--\"A tree is known by its fruit.\" This proverb, accepted by the wise and just almost as a truism, seems to have no place in the philosophy of some people, especially when a servant of the Lord is the object of their critical contemplation. \"What do men say of him?\" is frequently the only criterion by which such a character is judged. And is it not manifestly unfair? When a prophet comes from God with a message "]]]
