We get most of our food in the water or in the mud under the water, as of course you know, and when the water is frozen, there isn't a scrap of anything we can get to eat. We just HAVE to come south. It isn't because we want to, but because we must! There is nothing else for us to do.”  “Then I don't see what you want to make your home in such a place for,” said practical Peter. “I should think you would make it where you can live all the year around.”  “I was born up there, and I love it just as you love the dear Old Briar-patch,” replied Mrs. Quack simply. “It is home, and there is no place like home.  Besides, it is a very beautiful and a very wonderful place in summer. There is everything that Ducks and Geese love. We have all we want of the food we love best. Everywhere is shallow water with tall grass growing in it.”  “Huh!” interrupted Peter, “I wouldn't think much of a place like that.”  “That's because you don't know what is good,” snapped Jerry Muskrat. “It would suit me,” he added, with shining eyes.  “There are the dearest little islands just made for safe nesting-places,”  continued Mrs. Quack, without heeding the interruptions. “And the days are long, and it is easy to hide, and there is nothing to fear, for two-legged creatures with terrible guns never come there.”  “If there is nothing to fear, why do you care about places to hide?”  demanded Peter.  “Well, of course, we have enemies, just as you do here, but they are natural enemies,--Foxes and Minks and Hawks and Owls,” explained Mrs. Quack. “Of course, we have to watch out for them and have places where we can hide from them, but it is our wits against their wits, and it is our own fault if we get caught.  That is perfectly fair, so we don't mind that. It is only men who are not fair.  They don't know what fairness is.”  Peter nodded that he understood, and Mrs. Quack went on. “Last summer Mr. Quack and I had our nest on the dearest little island, and no one found it. First we had twelve eggs, and then twelve of the dearest babies you ever saw.”  “Maybe,” said Peter doubtfully, thinking of his own babies.  “They grew so fast that by the time the cold weather came, they were as big as their father and mother,” continued Mrs. Quack. “And they were smart, too. They had learned how to take care of themselves just as well as I could. I certainly was proud of that family. But now I don't know where one of them is.”  Mrs. Quack suddenly choked up with grief, and Peter Rabbit politely turned his head away.     IV  MRS. QUACK CONTINUES HER STORY   When Mrs. Quack told of her twelve children and how she didn't know where one of them was, Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat knew just how badly she was feeling, and they turned their heads away and pretended that they didn't see her tears.  In a few minutes she bravely went on with her story.  “When Jack Frost came and we knew it was time to begin the long journey, Mr.  Quack and myself and our twelve children joined with some other Duck families, and with Mr. Quack in the lead, we started for our winter home, which really isn't a home but just a place to stay. For a while we had nothing much to fear.  We would fly by day and at night rest in some quiet lake or pond or on some river, with the Great Woods all about us or sometimes great marshes. Perhaps you don't know what marshes are. If the Green Meadows here had little streams of water running every which way through them, and the ground was all soft and muddy and full of water, and the grass grew tall, they would be marshes.”  Jerry Muskrat's eyes sparkled. “I would like a place like that!”  he exclaimed.  “You certainly would,” replied Mrs. Quack. “We always find lots of your relatives in such places.”  “Marshes must be something like swamps,” ventured Peter Rabbit, who had been thinking the matter over.  “Very much the same, only with grass and rushes in place of trees and bushes,” replied Mrs. Quack. “There is plenty to eat and the loveliest hiding-places. In some of these we stayed days at a time. In fact, we stayed until Jack Frost came to drive us out. Then as we flew, we began to see the homes of these terrible two-legged creatures called men, and from that time on we never knew a minute of peace, excepting when we were flying high in the air or far out over the water.  If we could have just kept flying all the time or never had to go near the shore, we would have been all right. But we had to eat.”  “Of course,” said Peter. “Everybody has to eat.”  “And we had to rest,” said Mrs. Quack.  “Certainly,” said Peter. “Everybody has to do that.”  “And to eat we had to go in close to shore where the water was not at all deep, because it is only in such places that we can get food,” continued Mrs. Quack.  “It takes a lot of strength to fly as we fly, and strength requires plenty of food. Mr. Quack knew all the best feeding-places, for he had made the long journey several times, so every day he would lead the way to one of these. He always chose the wildest and most lonely looking places he could find, as far as possible from the homes of men, but even then he was never careless. He would lead us around back and forth over the place he had chosen, and we would all look with all our might for signs of danger. If we saw none, we would drop down a little nearer and a little nearer. But with all our watchfulness, we never could be sure, absolutely sure, that all was safe. Sometimes those terrible two-legged creatures would be hiding in the very middle of the wildest, most lonely looking marshes. They would be covered with grass so that we couldn't see them.  Then, as we flew over them, would come the bang, bang, bang, bang of terrible guns, and always some of our flock would drop. We would have to leave them behind, for we knew if we wanted to live we must get beyond the reach of those terrible guns. So we would fly our hardest. It was awful, just simply awful!”  Mrs. Quack paused and shuddered, and Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat shuddered in sympathy.  “Sometimes we would have to try three or four feeding-places before we found one where there were no terrible guns. And when we did find one, we would be so tired and frightened that we couldn't enjoy our food, and we didn't dare to sleep without some one on watch all the time. It was like that every day. The farther we got, the worse it became. Our flock grew smaller and smaller. Those who escaped the terrible guns would be so frightened that they would forget to follow their leader and would fly in different directions and later perhaps join other flocks. So it was that when at last we reached the place in the sunny Southland for which we had started, Mr. Quack and I were alone. What became of our twelve children I don't know. I am afraid the terrible guns killed some. I hope some joined other flocks and escaped, but I don't know.”  “I hope they did too,” said Peter.     V  PETER LEARNS MORE OF MRS. QUACK'S TROUBLES   It often happens when we know      The troubles that our friends pass through,      Our own seem very small indeed;      You'll always find that this is true.  “My, you must have felt glad when you reached your winter home!”  exclaimed Peter Rabbit when Mrs. Quack finished the account of her long, terrible journey from her summer home in the far Northland to her winter home in the far Southland.  “I did,” replied Mrs. Quack, “but all the time I couldn't forget those to whom terrible things had happened on the way down, and then, too, I kept dreading the long journey back.”  “I don't see why you didn't stay right there. I would have,” said Peter, nodding his head with an air of great wisdom.  “Not if you were I,” replied Mrs. Quack. “In the first place it isn't a proper place in which to bring up young Ducks and make them strong and healthy. In the second place there are more dangers down there for young Ducks than up in the far Northland. In the third place there isn't room for all the Ducks to nest properly. And lastly there is a great longing for our real home, which Old Mother Nature has put in our hearts and which just MAKES us go. We couldn't be happy if we didn't.”  “Is the journey back as bad as the journey down?” asked Peter.  “Worse, very much worse,” replied Mrs. Quack sadly. “You can see for yourself just how bad it is, for here I am all alone.” Tears filled Mrs. Quack's eyes.  “It is almost too terrible to talk about,”  she continued after a minute. “You see, for one thing, food isn't as plentiful as it is in the fall, and we just have to go wherever it is to be found. Those two-legged creatures know where those feeding-grounds are just as well as we do, and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south. But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does. Sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang, bang of the terrible guns and go on, only to find that we have caught up with Jack Frost, and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice. Then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us. We just HAVE to do it.”  Mrs. Quack stopped and shivered. “It seems to me I have heard nothing but the noise of those terrible guns ever since we started,” said she. “I haven't had a good square meal for days and days, nor a good rest. That is what makes me so dreadfully nervous. Sometimes, when we had been driven from place to place until we had caught up with Jack Frost, there would be nothing but ice excepting in small places in a river where the water runs too swiftly to freeze. We would just have to drop into one of these to rest a little, because we had flown so far that our wings ached as if they would drop off. Then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5846"],["title","The Adventures of Poor Mrs. Quack (#2)"],["body","as we would think we were safe for a little while, there would come the bang of a terrible gun.  Then we would have to fly again as long as we could, and finally come back to the same place because there was no other place where we could go. Then we would have to do it all over again until night came. Sometimes I think that those men with terrible guns must hate us and want to kill every one of us. If they didn't, they would have a little bit of pity. They simply haven't any hearts at all.”  “It does seem so,” agreed Peter. “But wait until you know Farmer Brown's boy!  HE'S got a heart!” he added brightly.  “I don't want to know him,” retorted Mrs. Quack. “If he comes near here, you'll see me leave in a hurry. I wouldn't trust one of them, not one minute. You don't think he will come, do you?”  Peter sat up and looked across the Green Meadows, and his heart sank. “He's coming now, but I'm sure he won't hurt you, Mrs. Quack,”  said he.  But Mrs. Quack wouldn't wait to see. With a hasty promise to come back when the way was clear, she jumped into the air and on swift wings disappeared towards the Big River.     VI  FARMER BROWN'S BOY VISITS THE SMILING POOL   Farmer Brown's boy had heard Welcome Robin singing in the Old Orchard quite as soon as Peter Rabbit had, and that song of “Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer up!  Cheer!” had awakened quite as much gladness in his heart as it had in Peter's heart. It meant that Mistress Spring really had arrived, and that over in the Green Forest and down on the Green Meadows there would soon be shy blue, and just as shy white violets to look for, and other flowers almost if not quite as sweet and lovely. It meant that his feathered friends would soon be busy house-hunting and building. It meant that his little friends in fur would also be doing something very similar, if they had not already done so. It meant that soon there would be a million lovely things to see and a million joyous sounds to hear.  So the sound of Welcome Robin's voice made the heart of Farmer Brown's boy even more happy than it was before, and as Welcome Robin just HAD to sing, so Farmer Brown's boy just HAD to whistle. When his work was finished, it seemed to Farmer Brown's boy that something was calling him, calling him to get out on the Green Meadows or over in the Green Forest and share in the happiness of all the little people there. So presently he decided that he would go down to the Smiling Pool to find out how Jerry Muskrat was, and if Grandfather Frog was awake yet, and if the sweet singers of the Smiling Pool had begun their wonderful spring chorus.  Down the Crooked Little Path cross the Green Meadows he tramped, and as he drew near the Smiling Pool, he stopped whistling lest the sound should frighten some of the little people there. He was still some distance from the Smiling Pool when out of it sprang a big bird and on swift, whistling wings flew away in the direction of the Big River. Farmer Brown's boy stopped and watched until the bird had disappeared, and on his face was a look of great surprise.  “As I live, that was a Duck!” he exclaimed. “That is the first time I've ever known a wild Duck to be in the Smiling Pool. I wonder what under the sun could have brought her over here.”  Just then there was a distant bang in the direction of the Big River. Farmer Brown's boy scowled, and it made his face very angry-looking. “That's it,” he muttered. “Hunters are shooting the Ducks on their way north and have driven the poor things to look for any little mudhole where they can get a little rest.  Probably that Duck has been shot at so many times on the Big River that she felt safer over here in the Smiling Pool, little as it is.”  Farmer Brown's boy had guessed exactly right, as you and I know, and as Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat knew. “It's a shame, a downright shame that any one should want to shoot birds on their way to their nesting-grounds and that the law should let them if they do want to. Some people haven't any hearts; they're all stomachs. I hope that fellow who shot just now over there on the Big River didn't hit anything, and I wish that gun of his might have kicked a little sense of what is right and fair into his head, but of course it didn't.”  He grinned at the idea, and then he continued his way towards the Smiling Pool.  He hoped he might find another Duck there, and he approached the Smiling Pool very, very carefully.  But when he reached a point where he could see all over the Smiling Pool, there was no one to be seen save Jerry Muskrat sitting on the Big Rock and Peter Rabbit on the bank on the other side. Farmer Brown's boy smiled when he saw them. “Hello, Jerry Muskrat!” said he. “I wonder how a bite of carrot would taste to you.” He felt in his pocket and brought out a couple of carrots. One he put on a little tussock in the water where he knew Jerry would find it. The other he tossed across the Smiling Pool where he felt sure Peter would find it.  Presently he noticed two or three feathers on the water close to the edge of the bank. Mrs. Quack had left them there. “I believe that was a Mallard Duck,” said he, as he studied them. “I know what I'll do. I'll go straight back home and get some wheat and corn and put it here on the edge of the Smiling Pool. Perhaps she will come back and find it.”  And this is just what Farmer Brown's boy did.     VII  MRS. QUACK RETURNS   Peter Rabbit just couldn't go back to the dear Old Briar-patch. He just HAD to know if Mrs. Quack would come back to the Smiling Pool. He had seen Farmer Brown's boy come there a second time and scatter wheat and corn among the brown stalks of last summer's rushes, and he had guessed why Farmer Brown's boy had done this. He had guessed that they had been put there especially for Mrs. Quack, and if she should come back as she had promised to do, he wanted to be on hand when she found those good things to eat and hear what she would say.  So Peter stayed over near the Smiling Pool and hoped with all his might that Reddy Fox or Old Man Coyote would not take it into his head to come hunting over there. As luck would have it, neither of them did, and Peter had a very pleasant time gossiping with Jerry Muskrat, listening to the sweet voices of unseen singers in the Smiling Pool,--the Hylas, which some people call peepers,--and eating the carrot which Farmer Brown's boy had left for him.  Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun was just getting ready to go to bed behind the Purple Hills when Mrs. Quack returned. The first Peter knew of her coming was the whistle of her wings as she passed over him. Several times she circled around, high over the Smiling Pool, and Peter simply stared in open-mouthed admiration at the speed with which she flew. It didn't seem possible that one so big could move through the air so fast. Twice she set her wings and seemed to just slide down almost to the surface of the Smiling Pool, only to start her stout wings in motion once more and circle around again. It was very clear that she was terribly nervous and suspicious. The third time she landed in the water with a splash and sat perfectly still with her head stretched up, looking and listening with all her might.  “It's all right. There's nothing to be afraid of,” said Jerry Muskrat.  “Are you sure?” asked Mrs. Quack anxiously. “I've been fooled too often by men with their terrible guns to ever feel absolutely sure that one isn't hiding and waiting to shoot me.” As she spoke she swam about nervously. “Peter Rabbit and I have been here ever since you left, and I guess we ought to know,” replied Jerry Muskrat rather shortly. “There hasn't been anybody near here excepting Farmer Brown's boy, and we told you he wouldn't hurt you.”  “He brought us each a carrot,” Peter Rabbit broke in eagerly.  “Just the same, I wouldn't trust him,” replied Mrs. Quack. “Where is he now?”  “He left ever so long ago, and he won't be back to-night,” declared Peter confidently.  “I hope not,” said Mrs. Quack, with a sigh. “Did you hear the bang of that terrible gun just after I left here?”  “Yes,” replied Jerry Muskrat. “Was it fired at you?”  Mrs. Quack nodded and held up one wing. Peter and Jerry could see that one of the long feathers was missing. “I thought I was flying high enough to be safe,” said she, “but when I reached the Big River there was a bang from the bushes on the bank, and something cut that feather out of my wing, and I felt a sharp pain in my side. It made me feel quite ill for a while, and the place is very sore now, but I guess I'm lucky that it was no worse. It is very hard work to know just how far those terrible guns can throw things at you. Next time I will fly higher.”  “Where have you been since you left us?” asked Peter.  “Eight in the middle of the Big River,” replied Mrs. Quack. “It was the only safe place. I didn't dare go near either shore, and I'm nearly starved. I haven't had a mouthful to eat to-day.”  Peter opened his mouth to tell her of the wheat and corn left by Farmer Brown's boy and then closed it again. He would let her find it for herself. If he told her about it, she might suspect a trick and refuse to go near the place. He never had seen any one so suspicious, not even Old Man Coyote. But he couldn't blame her, after all she had been through. So he kept still and waited. He was learning, was Peter Rabbit. He was learning a great deal about Mrs. Quack.     VIII  MRS. QUACK HAS A GOOD MEAL AND A REST   There's nothing like a stomach full      To make the heart feel light;      To chase away the clouds of care      And make the world seem bright.  That's a fact. A full stomach makes the whole world seem different, brighter, better, and more worth living in. It is the hardest kind of hard work to be cheerful and see only the bright side of things when your stomach is empty. But once fill that empty stomach, and everything is changed. It was just that way with Mrs. Quack. For days at a time she hadn't had a full stomach because of"]]]
