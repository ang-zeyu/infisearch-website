There was no \"distance\" to \"lend enchantment to the view.\" His name and humble vocation made his marvelous claims seem impossible. It could not be that God would make a prophet out of a carpenter's son--a prophet mightier than Moses or any of the ancient seers--and give to him such a common name as Jesus, another form of Joshua. [2] It was unbelievable, absurd, to most. Therefore were they justified, as they supposed, in withholding from him recognition and honor. \"And He did not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.\"  _History Repeats._--As with the carpenter's, so with the farmer's son--each was objected to upon similar grounds. Nor was it a new thing in human experience. That which called forth criticism had occurred many times in other ages when God had raised up prophets and seers. Probably most of them were selected from among the plain people, and were comparatively unknown to men when the Lord called them.  _Moses an Exception._--Moses was a signal exception. He had been reared as a prince in the palace of the king of Egypt; but that was because Pharaoh's daughter, having found the homeless infant at the water's edge, thenceforth had charge of him and his education. Prince he was, regardless of that princely training; but he was not the only prince in Israel. They were \"a nation of kings and priests,\" though most of them walked in ways that were lowly.  _A Herdsman Prophet._--Prophets are not chosen for their worldly culture or their social position. A plain-going farmer, no less than a college professor, may be gifted with prophetic power and be called to exercise it for the good of his fellows. Amos, according to his own statement, \"was no prophet,\" nor \"a prophet's son.\" That is to say, he had not been trained in any school of the prophets, such as existed in Old Testament times. [3] He was not, like Jeremiah, the son of a priest. [4] He was a herdsman and a fruit-gatherer when the word of the Lord came to him: \"Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.\" [5]  _Prophets Foreordained._--A prophet's name, his place of birth, and the character of his everyday calling, are matters of little moment compared with other things pertaining to him. What of his state and standing before he came on earth? This is a far more important consideration. God's prophets are chosen before they are born, [6] and are sent into the world as He needs them. Their aims are high and holy. They desire the welfare and happiness of the race. Yet almost invariably their motives are misunderstood, and they and their followers are opposed and persecuted.  _The Vital Question._--Does this man come from God? That is the only question worthy of immediate attention, when a prophet, or one professing to be such appears. And his word alone need not be taken as conclusive. There are ways and means of testing a prophet's claim--and that, too, without awaiting the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of some prediction by or concerning him. Honest, prayerful men and women, with even moderate discernment, need not be deceived by any pious or impious pretender. God would not leave his children at the mercy of imposters. The sheep have a right to be protected from the wolves.  _\"Try the Spirits.\"_--\"Many false prophets are gone out into the world.\" [7] But there is a Spirit that discerns between true and false, between spurious and genuine, and anyone who seeks it aright may have \"the inspiration of the Almighty,\" which giveth to the spirit of man \"understanding.\" [8] Moreover, the Letter as well as the Spirit is a guide. What has been revealed in times past helps to interpret what is now revealed. Truth is always consistent with itself. Heaven-inspired men do not contradict one another. Their teachings harmonize and are dependable. The spirit of contention is essentially evil. [9] \"To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" [10]  _\"Old Joe Smith.\"_--Were these tests applied to Joseph Smith in the early part of the nineteenth century? Yes, by some; and they received the promised testimony of the Truth, the absolute evidence of the divinity of this Prophet's mission. But by far the greater number of those to whom he fain would have ministered, rejected him summarily and without investigation. To them he was only \"Joe Smith\"--\"Old Joe Smith\"--old indeed in wisdom, though young in earthly years, yielding up his life as a martyr at the early age of thirty-eight. His claim to being an oracle of God was deemed preposterous, blasphemous; and his religion, the pure Gospel of Christ, was denounced as the world's worst delusion and snare.  _Badges of Honor._--But bad names, wrongly bestowed, hurt the giver, rather than the receiver. Blame and ridicule, when applied to the righteous, are badges of honor, worn by true prophets and true principles in all ages. It does not do away with a man of God to pelt him with nicknames and opprobrious epithets. Persecution may end his earthly career, but it cannot confute his claim nor invalidate his testimony. The name of the martyred modern Seer, despite the clouds of calumny enveloping it, shines out from amidst the darkness that comprehended him not. His glorious Lord and Master, crucified as an imposter, put to death for maintaining that he was more than the world believed him to be, gave the only Name given under heaven whereby men can be saved.

ARTICLE FOUR.  _The Choice Seer._  _A Prenatal Naming._--Let us now take a closer view of this marvelous man, Joseph Smith, the most extraordinary character that has appeared upon our planet in the past two thousand years. His coming into the world fulfilled a prophecy uttered many centuries before his birth--a prophecy concerning \"a choice seer,\" to be raised up \"out of the loins\" of Joseph who was sold into Egypt. The seer's name was likewise to be Joseph, and this also was to be the name of his father. [1] That prophecy was fulfilled in Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \"Joseph the Seer\"--so is he designated by divine revelation. [2]  Like great Cyrus, who liberated the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, [3] the Lord's anointed in modern times, raised up to begin the work of Israel's final and complete redemption, was named and his mission outlined long before he had tabernacled in the flesh. Why he came gifted with the power of seership, was made manifest at the very beginning of his career.  _Birth and Parentage._--Joseph the Seer was born at Sharon, Vermont, two days before Christmas, in the year 1805. When only a lad, living with his parents, Joseph and Lucy Smith, honest farm folk in the backwoods of Western New York, his career as a prophet began.  _In Quest of Wisdom._--Partly from the effects of a religious revival held in his neighborhood, he became much concerned upon the subject of his soul's salvation, but was bewildered and unable to make choice of a church or creed, owing to the diverse and conflicting claims of the various Christian sects. While in this mood, he chanced upon the following passage of scripture: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\" [4] Deeply impressed with the sacred words, he forthwith resolved to ask from God the wisdom of which he stood in need.  _The First Vision._--Retiring to a grove near his father's home, he knelt in prayer to the Most High; but had scarcely begun his humble and earnest petition, when he was seized upon by a power that filled his soul with horror and paralyzed his tongue so that he could no longer speak. So terrible was the visitation, that he almost gave way to despair. Yet he continued to pray--in thought, with \"the soul's sincere desire\"--and just at the moment when he feared he must abandon himself to destruction, he saw, directly over his head, a light more brilliant than the noonday sun. In the midst of a pillar of glory he beheld two beings in human form, one of whom, pointing to the other, said: \"This is my beloved Son, hear Him.\" [5]  _All Churches Astray._--With the appearance of the Light, the boy found himself delivered from the fettering power of the Evil One. As soon as he could again command utterance, he inquired of his heavenly visitants which of all the religious denominations was right--which one was the true Church of Christ? To his astonishment, he was told that none of them was right; that they had all gone out of the way. Their creeds were an abomination, and their professors corrupt. \"They draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me; they teach for doctrine the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\" So spake the Son of God concerning the churches. [6] He declared that he did not recognize any of them; but was about to restore the Everlasting Gospel, with the powers of the Eternal Priesthood, and establish his Church once more in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56691"],["title","Saturday Night Thoughts (#3)"],["body","of mankind.  Such was Joseph Smith's first vision and revelation. It came in the spring of 1820, when he was but a few months over fourteen years of age.  _The Divine Personality._--The greater part of this wonderful manifestation was the part that did not speak--the silent revealing of the personality of God; a truth plainly taught in the Scriptures, but ignored or denied by modern Christianity. The object worshiped by the sects was defined in their theology as a being \"without body, parts or passions.\" [7] That was the popular concept of Deity throughout Christendom when Joseph Smith and \"Mormonism\" came forth. In line with this tenet and teaching, an English poet of the eighteenth century had represented God as a \"Mind\" or \"Soul\" that    Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,   Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,   Lives through all life, extends through all extent,   Spreads undivided, operates unspent. [8]  These beautiful couplets admirably describe the Spirit of the Lord--that all-pervading energy or essence which proceeds from the Divine Presence, fills the immensity of space, is everywhere present, and is immanent in all creation. But they give no adequate idea of the Great Creator, \"the father of the spirits\" of men, [9] who sent into the world his Beloved Son, \"the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person\", [10] that men might see in him the Father and worship God aright. The Son of God, walking as a man upon the earth, plainly indicated what kind of a being God is; and when his disciple, Philip, said to him, \"Lord, show us the Father,\" Jesus replied: \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.\" [11] Could anything be plainer?  But these teachings were lost upon the modern Christian world. They had turned from the truth \"unto fables\", [12] forsaking the God of their fathers, and substituting for him as an object of worship, an ideal of their own creation. And it devolved upon Joseph Smith to shatter the false doctrine of a bodiless, passionless deity, and bring back the lost knowledge of the true and living God.  _The True and Living God._--What is meant by that? Who is \"the true and living God?\" He is the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of Adam, of Enoch, of Noah, of the patriarchs and prophets and apostles of old--the God described by Moses in the first chapter of Genesis, where it is written: \"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him, male and female, created he them.\" This is equivalent to saying that God is in the form of man, and that we have a Mother as well as a Father in Heaven, in whose image or likeness we are, male and female.  Of the divine Three who hold supreme power and preside over the universe--three distinct personalities, yet one God or Godhead, one in will, wisdom, power and authority--of these, the Father and the Son, according to Joseph Smith, are personages of tabernacle. They have bodies \"as tangible as man's;\" while the Holy Ghost \"is a personage of spirit.\" [13]  _The Idol of the Sects._--Proceeding forth from them, is that all-pervading essence or influence which is immanent in all things--the light of the sun, moon and stars, the light also of the human understanding, quickening and illumining, in greater or less degree, \"every man that cometh into the world.\" In it we live, move and have our being; for it is the principle of life throughout creation. This is what the poet was describing, when he portrayed Deity as a \"Soul\" that \"warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,\" etc. And this is what the Christian sects were worshiping at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Not God, but a spirit sent forth from God; not Divinity, but an emanation from Divinity. In a word, they were practicing idolatry--or something dangerously akin to it.  _What Constitutes Idolatry?_--\"Idolatry is every worship that stops short of the Supreme.\" [14] It is \"the paying of divine homage to false gods or images; also, adoration of created or imaginary beings or natural objects or forces.\" [15] This is precisely what the ancient world was doing when the book of Genesis was written. The Canaanites worshiped the sun and moon--Baal and Ashtoreth--ascribing to them the powers of creation. The Egyptians adored the crocodile, the bull, the goat and the beetle (scarabeus). Among the Hindus the seasons were deified--spring, summer, autumn, winter; as were also the passions--love, hate, fear, anger and revenge. All these were revered as deities. Then came Moses, who had seen the living and true God, and had conversed with him face to face, receiving from him the Decalogue or Ten Commandments unto Israel. The first commandment reads: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\"  _Modern Christendom's Position._--The world in Joseph Smith's day--the Christian world at least--did not worship the heavenly bodies; did not deify beasts and reptiles, did not regard the seasons and passions as divine. Yet it had turned from the true God, ignoring or misinterpreting what Moses and the prophets had written concerning him. According to its dictum, the age of miracles was past; prophets were out of date, and angel messengers obsolete; the heavens were sealed, the canon of scripture was full, and God would never again communicate with mortals. Then came the vision of the Father and the Son--two glorious beings in the form of man--and from the hour that the boy Joseph beheld them, there was at least one person upon this planet who knew what kind of a being God is. It was a virtual reassertion of the first commandment in the Decalogue: \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\"  To worship anything that God has made and given, in lieu of the Maker and Giver, is to worship an idol. They who turn from the Creator to the creature, who forsake God and adore a gift or an emanation from God, are idolaters, almost as much as if they worshiped the sun and moon, or bowed down to goats and crocodiles.  _Like to Elijah._--To restore the acceptable worship of Jehovah, and begin a work that would sweep away idolatry and all things connected therewith, was the mission of Joseph the Seer. Against him, as against Elijah of old, the priests of Baal raged in impotent fury. Despite their tongues of slander and their weapons of violence, he accomplished all that had been given him to do. This time, however, the All-Wise permitted his servant to be sacrificed--to the end, no doubt, that his innocent blood, affixing to his testimony the red seal of martyrdom, might give added power to the great propaganda then and still in progress for Israel's redemption--the gathering of the scattered sheep preparatory to the Shepherd's coming.

ARTICLE FIVE.  _The Land of Zion._  _The Angel Moroni._--Three years after that wonderful vision in the Grove, the youthful Seer received a visitation from an angel, a messenger from the presence of the Lord. This Angel gave his name as Moroni, and declared that while in mortal life he had ministered as a prophet to an ancient people called Nephites, a branch of the house of Israel--not the Lost Tribes, as is frequently asserted by the uninformed, but a portion of the tribe of Joseph, mixed with a remnant of the tribe of Judah. The former had crossed over from Jerusalem about the year 600 B. C.; the others a few years later. These blended colonies had inhabited the Americas down to about the beginning of the fourth century of the Christian era, when the civilized though degenerate Nephites were destroyed by a savage faction known as Lamanites, ancestors of the American Indians.  _The Book of Mormon._--The Angel further stated that a record of the Nephites would be found in a hill not far from Joseph's home--a hill anciently called Cumorah; and upon that spot, four years afterward, Moroni delivered the record into his hands. It was a book of metallic plates \"having the appearance of gold,\" and covered with strange characters, \"small and beautifully engraved\"--characters known to the Nephites as \"the reformed Egyptian.\" [1]  By means of \"interpreters,\" discovered with the plates, and consisting of \"two stones in silver bows,\" the youth translated the unsealed portion of the record and, with the assistance of a few friends, published to the world the Book of Mormon. It was so named for its compiler, the Nephite prophet Mormon, whose son and survivor, Moroni, had buried the plates where Joseph Smith found them. The date of discovery was September 22nd, 1823. [2]  The Hill Cumorah is situated between Palmyra and Manchester, in the State of New York. For their belief in the Book of Mormon, the Latter-day Saints were termed \"Mormons,\" and their religion \"Mormonism.\" It proclaims itself the restored fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  _History and Prophecy._--The Book of Mormon is a sacred history of pre-historic America, and a prophecy of the wondrous future of this chosen land. It tells not only of the Nephites and Lamanites, but also of a more ancient people, the Jaredites, who came from the Tower of Babel at the time of the confusion of tongues. Becoming extinct, the Jaredites were succeeded by the Israelitish colony, led from Jerusalem by a prophet named Lehi, whose sons Nephi and Laman became, respectively, the heads of the two nations that sprang from him and were called after their names.
