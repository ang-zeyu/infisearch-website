If the woman who gave him birth wishes to make him feel new and deep gratitude, let her hasten at once to Luxemburg, where he has been for several hours in the deepest privacy.  The weal and woe of his life are at stake.\"  The letter, written in the German language, was signed \"John of Austria.\"  Panting for breath, Barbara gazed a long time into vacancy.  Then, suddenly drawing herself up proudly, she exclaimed to Lamperi: \"I'll dress my hair myself.  Yesterday Herr De la Porta offered me his travelling carriage.  The major-domo must go to him at once and say that Madame de Blomberg asks the loan of the vehicle.  Let the page Diego order post and courier horses at the same time.  The carriage must be ready in an hour.\"  \"But, Madame,\" cried the maid, raising her hands in alarm and admonition, \"the Rassinghams are expecting you.  The honour!  Every one who is well disposed in the States-General will be there.  Who knows what the party has in store for you?  And then the banquet!  What may there not be to hear!\"  \"No matter,\" replied Barbara.  \"The chaplain--I'll speak to him-must send the refusal.  No summons from Heaven could be more powerful than the call that takes me away.  Bestir yourself!  There is not an instant to lose.\"  Frau Lamperi retired with drooping head.  But when she had executed her mistress's orders and returned, Barbara laid her hand upon her shoulder, whispering: \"You can keep silence.  I am going to Luxemburg.  He who calls me is one whom you saw enter the world, the hero of Lepanto.  He wants his mother.  At last! at last!  And I--\"  Here tears stifled her voice, and obeying the desire to pour out to another the overflowing gratitude and love which had taken possession of her soul, she threw herself upon the gray-haired attendant's breast, and amid her weeping exclaimed: \"I shall see him with these eyes, I can clasp his hand, I shall hear his voice--that voice--His first cry--A thousand times, waking and sleeping, I have fancied I heard it again.  Do you remember how they took him from me, Lamperi?  \"To think that I survived it!  But now--now  If that voice lured me to the deepest abyss and called me away from paradise, I would go!\"  The maid's old eyes also overflowed, and when Barbara read her son's letter aloud, she cried: \"Of course there can be no delay, even if, instead of the Rassinghams, King Philip himself should send for you.  And I--may I go with you?  Oh, Madame, you do not know what a sweet little angel he was from his very birth!  We were not allowed to show him to you.  And it was wise, for, had you seen him, it would have broken your poor mother heart to give him up.\"  She sobbed aloud as she spoke.  Barbara permitted her to accompany her, though she had intended to take her companion, and would have preferred to travel with the woman of noble birth.  Besides, she could have confided the care of her sick guest to Lamperi more confidently than to the other.  But the faithful old soul's wish to see the boy whose entrance into the world she had been permitted to greet was too justifiable for her to be able to refuse it.  How much Barbara had to do before her departure!  Most of the time was consumed by the suffering maestro and the arrangements which she had to make for him.  She did not leave his bedside until the arrival of the sister who was to assist her companion in nursing her old friend until her return.  She certainly would not be absent long; the important things John had to say might probably require great haste, while, on the contrary, whatever needed time for execution could be comfortably despatched during his stay in the Netherlands.  So she assured Feys, who regarded her as his good angel and felt her departure painfully, that she would soon be with him again, and then gave the order to ask Hannibal Melas, in her name, to pay frequent visits to the sick maestro.  It was very hard for her to leave him and neglect the duties which she had undertaken, but in the presence of the summons addressed to her every other consideration must be silent.  When Barbara returned to her own apartments Lamperi was still busied with the packing.  Several dresses--first of all the new Brussels gown and its belongings, even the pomegranate blossoms which the garden city of Ghent had supplied as something rare in November for her mistress's adornment--were placed carefully in the largest trunk, while Barbara, overpowered by inexpressible restlessness, paced the room with hasty steps from side to side.  Only when one or another article was taken from a casket or box did she pause in her walk.  Among the things selected was the pearl necklace which Charles had given her, and the only note her royal lover had ever written, which ran, \"This evening, quia amore langueo.\"  This she laid with her own hand among the laces and pomegranate blossoms, for this cry of longing might teach her son what she had once been to his father. When John had seen her and felt how clear he was to her, he must become aware that he had another mother besides the Spanish lady whom he called \"Tia,\" and who made his underclothing; then he could no more forget her than that other woman.  Lastly, she summoned the major-domo and told him what he must do during her absence, which she thought would not exceed a week at the utmost. The guests invited for Wednesday must be notified; the women's choir must be requested to excuse her non-appearance; Sir Jasper Gordon, her most faithful admirer, an elderly Englishman, must learn that she had gone away; but, above all, writing tablet in hand, she directed him how to provide for her poor, what assistance every individual should receive, or the sums of money and wood which were to be sent to other houses to provide for the coming winter.  She also placed money at the majordomo's disposal for any very needy persons who might apply for help while she was out of reach.  Before the November sun had set she entered the La Porta travelling carriage.  The chaplain, whom she referred to the major-domo for any matters connected with the poor, gave his blessing to the departing traveller, whose cheerful vivacity, after so many severe trials, he admired, and whose \"golden heart,\" as he expressed it, had made her dear to him.  The servants gathered at the door of the house, bowing silently, and her \"Farewell, till we meet again!\" fell from her lips with joyous confidence.  While on the way she reflected, for the first time, what John could desire of her for the \"weal and woe of his life.\"  It was impossible to guess, yet whatever it might be she would not fail him.  But what could it be'  Neither during the long night journey nor by the light of day did she find a satisfactory answer.  True, she had not thought solely of her son's entreaty.  Her whole former life passed before her.  How much she had sinned and erred!  But all that she had done for the man to whom the posthorses were swiftly bearing her seemed to her free from reproach and blameless.  Every act and feeling which he had received from her had been the best of which she was capable.  Not a day, scarcely an hour, had she forgotten him; for his sake she had endured great anguish willingly, and, in spite of his mute reserve--she could say so to herself--without any bitter feeling.  How she had suffered in parting from her child she alone knew.  Fate had raised her son to the summit of earthly grandeur and saved him from every clanger. Providence had adorned him with its choicest gifts.  When she thought of the last account of him from the Duke of Ferdinandina, it seemed to her as if his life had hitherto resembled a triumphal procession, a walk through blooming gardens.  What could he mean by the \"woe\" after the \"weal\"?  John was to her the embodied fulfilment of the most ardent prayers.  The blessings she had besought for him, and for which she had placed her own heart on the rack, had become his-glory and splendour, fame and honour.  She had not been able to give them to him, and undoubtedly he owed much to his own powers and to the favour of his royal brother, but Barbara was firmly convinced that her prayers had raised him to his present grandeur.  What more could now be given to him?  Everything the human heart desires was already his.  His happiness was complete, and during recent years this, too, had cheered her heart and restored her lost capacity for the enjoyment of life.  She had been carried to the very verge of recklessness whenever bitter grief had oppressed her heart.  Her greatest sorrow had been that she was not permitted to see and embrace him, and the knowledge that another filled the place in his heart which belonged to her; but lesser troubles had also gnawed at her soul.  It had been especially hard to bear that, as the object of the greatest Emperor's love and the mother of his son, she had so long felt that she was reluctantly tolerated, and not really recognised in the circles which should have been hers also.  Moreover, the consciousness of exercising an art over which she had once attained a mastery, yet never being able to shake off the painful doubt whether the applause that greeted her performance was genuine, spoiled many a pleasant hour.  Still, all these things had probably been only the tribute which she was compelled to pay for the proud joy of being the mother of such a son.  Now she at last felt safe from these malicious little attacks.  She had gained a good social position; she was not only valued as a singer, but always sought wherever the women of Ghent were earnestly pursuing music and singing.  The invitation to the Rassinghams flung wide the doors which had formerly been closed against her, and she might be sure of not being deemed the least important "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5571"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Complete (#0)"],["body","BLOMBERG  By Georg Ebers   Translated from the German by Mary J. Safford     BOOK 1.     CHAPTER I.  The sun sometimes shone brightly upon the little round panes of the ancient building, the Golden Cross, on the northern side of the square, which the people of Ratisbon call “on the moor”; sometimes it was veiled by gray clouds. A party of nobles, ecclesiastics, and knights belonging to the Emperor’s train were just coming out. The spring breeze banged behind them the door of the little entrance for pedestrians close beside the large main gateway.  The courtiers and ladies who were in the chapel at the right of the corridor started. “April weather!” growled the corporal of the Imperial Halberdiers to the comrade with whom he was keeping; guard at the foot of the staircase leading to the apartments of Charles V, in the second story of the huge old house.  “St. Peter’s day,” replied the other, a Catalonian. “At my home fresh strawberries are now growing in the open air and roses are blooming in the gardens. Take it all in all, it’s better to be dead in Barcelona than alive in this accursed land of heretics!”  “Come, come,” replied the other, “life is life! ‘A live dog is better than a dead king,’ says a proverb in my country.”  “And it is right, too,” replied the Spaniard. “But ever since we came here our master’s face looks as if imperial life didn’t taste exactly like mulled wine, either.”  The Netherlander lowered his halberd and answered his companion’s words first with a heavy sigh, and then with the remark: “Bad weather upstairs as well as down--the very worst! I’ve been in the service thirteen years, but I never saw him like this, not even after the defeat in Algiers. That means we must keep a good lookout. Present halberds! Some one is coming down.”  Both quickly assumed a more erect attitude, but the Spaniard whispered to his comrade: “It isn’t he. His step hasn’t sounded like that since the gout--”  “Quijada!” whispered the Netherlander, and both he and the man from Barcelona presented halberds with true military bearing; but the staves of their descending weapons soon struck the flags of the pavement again, for a woman’s voice had detained the man whom the soldiers intended to salute, and in his place two slender lads rushed down the steps.  The yellow velvet garments, with ash-gray facings, and cap of the same material in the same colours, were very becoming to these youths--the Emperor’s pages--and, though the first two were sons of German and Italian counts, and the third who followed them was a Holland baron, the sentinels took little more notice of them than of Queen Mary’s pointers following swiftly at their heels.  “Of those up there,” observed the halberdier from Haarlem under his breath, “a man would most willingly stiffen his back for Quijada.”  “Except their Majesties, of course,” added the Catalonian with dignity.  “Of course,” the other repeated. “Besides, the Emperor Charles himself bestows every honour on Don Luis. I was in Algiers at the time. A hundred more like him would have made matters different, I can tell you. If it beseemed an insignificant fellow like me, I should like to ask why his Majesty took him from the army and placed him among the courtiers.”  Here he stopped abruptly, for, in spite of the gaily dressed nobles and ladies, priests, knights, and attendants who were passing up and down the corridor, he had heard footsteps on the stairs which must be those of men in high position. He was not mistaken--one was no less a personage than the younger Granvelle, the Bishop of Arras, who, notwithstanding his nine-and-twenty years, was already the favourite counsellor of Charles V; the other, a man considerably his senior, Dr. Mathys, of Bruges, the Emperor’s physician.  The bishop was followed by a secretary clad in black, with a portfolio under his arm; the leech, by an elderly assistant.  The fine features of the Bishop of Arras, which revealed a nature capable of laughter and enjoyment, now looked as grave as his companion’s--a fact which by no means escaped the notice of the courtiers in the corridor, but no one ventured to approach them with a question, although--it had begun to rain again--they stopped before going out of doors and stood talking together in low tones.  Many would gladly have caught part of their conversation, but no one dared to move nearer, and the Southerners and Germans among them did not understand the Flemish which they spoke.  Not until after the leech had raised his tall, pointed hat and the statesman had pressed his prelate’s cap closer upon his short, wavy dark hair and drawn his sable-trimmed velvet cloak around him did several courtiers hasten forward with officious zeal to open the little side door for them.  Something must be going wrong upstairs.  Dr. Mathys’s jovial face wore a very different expression when his imperial patient was doing well, and Granvelle always bestowed a friendly nod on one and another if he himself had cause to be content.  When the door had closed behind the pair, the tongues of the ecclesiastics, the secular lords, and the ladies in the corridor were again loosed; but there were no loud discussions in the various languages now mingling in the Golden Cross, far less was a gay exclamation or a peal of laughter heard from any of the groups who stood waiting for the shower to cease.  Although each individual was concerned about his own affairs, one thought, nevertheless, ruled them all--the Emperor Charles, his health, and his decisions. Upon them depended not only the destiny of the world, but also the weal and woe of the greatest as well as the humblest of those assembled here.  “Emperor Charles” was the spell by which the inhabitants of half the world obtained prosperity or ill-luck, war or peace, fulfilment or denial of the wishes which most deeply stirred their souls. Even the highest in the land, who expected from his justice or favour fresh good-fortune or the averting of impending disasters, found their way to him wherever, on his long and numerous journeys, he established his court.  Numerous petitioners had also flocked to Ratisbon, but the two great nobles who now entered the Golden Cross certainly did not belong to their number. One shook the raindrops from his richly embroidered velvet cloak and the plumes in his cap, the other from his steel helmet and suit of Milan mail, inlaid with gold. Chamberlain de Praet accosted the former, Duke Peter of Columna, in Italian; the latter, the Landgrave of Leuchtenberg, in a mixture of German and his Flemish native tongue. He had no occasion to say much, for the Emperor wished to be alone. He had ordered even crowned heads and ambassadors to be denied admittance.  The Duke of Columna gaily begged for a dry shelter until the shower was over, but the Landgrave requested to be announced to the Queen of Hungary.  The latter, however, had also declined to grant any audiences that afternoon. The royal lady, the Emperor’s favourite sister, was in her own room, adjoining her imperial brother’s, talking with Don Luis Quijada, the brave nobleman of whom the Spanish and the Netherland soldiers had spoken with equal warmth.  His personal appearance rendered it an easy matter to believe in the sincerity of their words, for the carriage of his slender, vigorous form revealed all the pride of the Castilian noble. His face, with its closely cut pointed beard, was the countenance of a true warrior, and the expression of his black eyes showed the valiant spirit of a loyal, kind, and simple heart.  The warm confidence with which Mary, the widow of the King of Hungary, who fell in the Turkish war, gazed into Quijada’s finely modelled, slightly bronzed countenance proved that she knew how to estimate his worth aright. She had sent for him to open her whole heart.  The vivacious woman, a passionate lover of the chase, found life in Ratisbon unendurable. She would have left the city long ago to perform her duties in the Netherlands--which she ruled as regent in the name of her imperial brother--and devote herself to hunting, to her heart’s content, if the condition of the monarch’s health had not detained her near him.  She pitied Charles because she loved him, yet she was weary of playing the sick nurse.  She had just indignantly informed Quijada what an immense burden of work, in spite of the pangs of the gout, her suffering brother had imposed upon himself ever since the first cock-crow. But he would take no better care of himself, and therefore it was difficult to help him. Was it not utterly unprecedented? Directly after mass he had examined dozens of papers, made notes on the margins, and affixed his signature; then he received Father Pedro de Soto, his confessor, the nuncio, the English and the Venetian ambassadors; and, lastly, had an interview with young Granvelle, the Bishop of Arras, which had continued three full hours, and perhaps might be going on still had not Dr. Mathys, the leech, put an end to it.  Queen Mary had just found him utterly exhausted, with his face buried in his hands.  “And you, too,” she added in conclusion, “can not help admitting that if this state of things continues there must be an evil end.”  Quijada bent his head in assent, and then answered modestly:  “Yet your Majesty knows our royal master’s nature. He will listen calmly to you, whom he loves, or to me, who was permitted to remain at his side as a page, or probably to the two Granvelles, Malfalconnet, and others whom he trusts, when they venture to warn him--”  “And yet keep on in his mad career,” interrupted Queen Mary with an angry gesture of the hand.  “Plus ultra--more, farther--is his motto,” observed Quijada in a tone of justification.  “Forward ceaselessly, for aught I care, so long as the stomach and the feet are sound!” replied the Queen, raising her hand to the high lace ruff, which oppressed the breathing of one so accustomed to the outdoor air. “But when, like him, a man must give"]]]
