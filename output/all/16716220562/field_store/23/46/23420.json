Nor did any amount of none too gentle prodding on the part of the warder induce him to change his position.  \"Leave him alone,\" said Chauvelin curly at last. \"I have seen all that I wished to see.\"  The cell was insufferably hot and stuffy. Chauvelin, finical and queasy, turned away with a shudder of disgust. There was nothing to be got now out of a prolonged interview with his captured foe. He had seen him: that was sufficient. He had seen the super-exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney locked up in a common cell with some of the most scrubby and abject rogues which the slums of indigent Paris could yield, having apparently failed in some undertaking which had demanded for its fulfilment not only tattered clothes and grimy hands, but menial service with a beggarly and disease-ridden employer, whose very propinquity must have been positive torture to the fastidious dandy.  Of a truth this was sufficient for the gratification of any revenge. Chauvelin felt that he could now go contentedly to rest after an evening's work excellently done.  He gave order that Mole should be put in a separate cell, denied all intercourse with anyone outside or in the depot, and that he should be guarded on sight day and night. After that he went his way.   VI  The following morning citizen Chauvelin, of the Committee of Public Safety, gave due notice to citizen Fouquier-Tinville, the Public Prosecutor, that the dangerous English spy, known to the world as the Scarlet Pimpernel, was now safely under lock and key, and that he must be transferred to the Abbaye prison forthwith and to the guillotine as quickly as might be. No one was to take any risks this time; there must be no question either of discrediting his famous League or of obtaining other more valuable information out of him. Such methods had proved disastrous in the past.  There were no safe Englishmen these days, except the dead ones, and it would not take citizen Fouquier-Tinville much thought or time to frame an indictment against the notorious Scarlet Pimpernel, which would do away with the necessity of a prolonged trial. The revolutionary government was at war with England now, and short work could be made of all poisonous spies.  By order, therefore, of the Committee of Public Safety, the prisoner, Paul Mole, was taken out of the cells of the depot and conveyed in a closed carriage to the Abbaye prison. Chauvelin had the pleasure of watching this gratifying spectacle from the windows of the Commissariat. When he saw the closed carriage drive away, with Hebert and two men inside and two others on the box, he turned to citizen Commissary Cuisinier with a sigh of intense satisfaction.  \"There goes the most dangerous enemy our glorious revolution has had,\" he said, with an accent of triumph which he did not attempt to disguise.  Cuisinier shrugged his shoulders.  \"Possibly,\" he retorted curtly. \"He did not seem to me to be very dangerous and his papers were quite in order.\"  To this assertion Chauvelin made no reply. Indeed, how could he explain to this stolid official the subtle workings of an intriguing brain? Had he himself not had many a proof of how little the forging of identity papers or of passports troubled the members of that accursed League? Had he not seen the Scarlet Pimpernel, that exquisite Sir Percy Blakeney, under disguises that were so grimy and so loathsome that they would have repelled the most abject, suborned spy?  Indeed, all that was wanted now was the assurance that Hebert--who himself had a deadly and personal grudge against the Scarlet Pimpernel--would not allow him for one moment out of his sight.  Fortunately as to this, there was no fear. One hint to Hebert and the man was as keen, as determined, as Chauvelin himself.  \"Set your mind at rest, citizen,\" he said with a rough oath. \"I guessed how matters stood the moment you gave me the order. I knew you would not take all that trouble for a real Paul Mole. But have no fear! That accursed Englishman has not been one second out of my sight, from the moment I arrested him in the late citizen Marat's lodgings, and by Satan! he shall not be either, until I have seen his impudent head fall under the guillotine.\"  He himself, he added, had seen to the arrangements for the disposal of the prisoner in the Abbaye: an inner cell, partially partitioned off in one of the guard-rooms, with no egress of its own, and only a tiny grated air-hole high up in the wall, which gave on an outside corridor, and through which not even a cat could manage to slip. Oh! the prisoner was well guarded! The citizen Representative need, of a truth, have no fear! Three or four men--of the best and most trustworthy--had not left the guard-room since the morning. He himself (Hebert) had kept the accursed Englishman in sight all night, had personally conveyed him to the Abbaye, and had only left the guard-room a moment ago in order to speak with the citizen Representative. He was going back now at once, and would not move until the order came for the prisoner to be conveyed to the Court of Justice and thence to summary execution.  For the nonce, Hebert concluded with a complacent chuckle, the Englishman was still crouching dejectedly in a corner of his new cell, with little of him visible save that naked shoulder through his torn shirt, which, in the process of transference from one prison to another, had become a shade more grimy than before.  Chauvelin nodded, well satisfied. He commended Hebert for his zeal, rejoiced with him over the inevitable triumph. It would be well to avenge that awful humiliation at Calais last September. Nevertheless, he felt anxious and nervy; he could not comprehend the apathy assumed by the factitious Mole. That the apathy was assumed Chauvelin was keen enough to guess. What it portended he could not conjecture. But that the Englishman would make a desperate attempt at escape was, of course, a foregone conclusion. It rested with Hebert and a guard that could neither be bribed nor fooled into treachery, to see that such an attempt remained abortive.  What, however, had puzzled citizen Chauvelin all along was the motive which had induced Sir Percy Blakeney to play the role of menial to Jean Paul Marat. Behind it there lay, undoubtedly, one of those subtle intrigues for which that insolent Scarlet Pimpernel was famous; and with it was associated an attempt at theft upon the murdered body of the demagogue ... an attempt which had failed, seeing that the supposititious Paul Mole had been searched and nothing suspicious been found upon his person.  Nevertheless, thoughts of that attempted theft disturbed Chauvelin's equanimity. The old legend of the crumpled roseleaf was applicable in his case. Something of his intense satisfaction would pale if this final enterprise of the audacious adventurer were to be brought to a triumphant close in the end.   VII  That same forenoon, on his return from the Abbaye and the depot, Chauvelin found that a visitor was waiting for him. A woman, who gave her name as Jeannette Marechal, desired to speak with the citizen Representative. Chauvelin knew the woman as his colleague Marat's maid-of-all-work, and he gave orders that she should be admitted at once.  Jeannette Marechal, tearful and not a little frightened, assured the citizen Representative that her errand was urgent. Her late employer had so few friends; she did not know to whom to turn until she bethought herself of citizen Chauvelin. It took him some little time to disentangle the tangible facts out of the woman's voluble narrative. At first the words: \"Child ... Chemin de Pantin ... Leridan,\" were only a medley of sounds which conveyed no meaning to his ear. But when occasion demanded, citizen Chauvelin was capable of infinite patience. Gradually he understood what the woman was driving at.  \"The child, citizen!\" she reiterated excitedly. \"What's to be done about him? I know that citizen Marat would have wished--\"  \"Never mind now what citizen Marat would have wished,\" Chauvelin broke in quietly. \"Tell me first who this child is.\"  \"I do not know, citizen,\" she replied.  \"How do you mean, you do not know? Then I pray you, citizeness, what is all this pother about?\"  \"About the child, citizen,\" reiterated Jeannette obstinately.  \"What child?\"  \"The child whom citizen Marat adopted last year and kept at that awful house on the Chemin de Pantin.\"  \"I did not know citizen Marat had adopted a child,\" remarked Chauvelin thoughtfully.  \"No one knew,\" she rejoined. \"Not even citizeness Evrard. I was the only one who knew. I had to go and see the child once every month. It was a wretched, miserable brat,\" the woman went on, her shrivelled old breast vaguely stirred, mayhap, by some atrophied feeling of motherhood. \"More than half-starved ... and the look in its eyes, citizen! It was enough to make you cry! I could see by his poor little emaciated body and his nice little hands and feet that he ought never to have been put in that awful house, where--\"  She paused, and that quick look of furtive terror, which was so often to be met with in the eyes of the timid these days, crept into her wrinkled face.  \"Well, citizeness,\" Chauvelin rejoined quietly, \"why don't you proceed? That awful house, you were saying. Where and what is that awful house of which you speak?\"  \"The place kept by citizen Leridan, just by Bassin de l'Ourcq,\" the woman murmured. \"You know it, citizen.\"  Chauvelin nodded. He was beginning to understand.  \"Well, now, tell me,\" he said, with that bland patience which had so oft served him in good stead in his unavowable profession. \"Tell me. Last year citizen Marat adopted--we'll say adopted--a child, whom he placed in the Leridans' house on the Pantin road. Is that correct?\"  \"That is just how it is, citizen. And I--\"  \"One moment,\" he broke in somewhat more sternly, as the woman's garrulity was getting on his nerves. \"As you say, I know the Leridans' house. I have had cause"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5805"],["title","The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel (#5)"],["body","send children there myself. Children of aristos or of fat bourgeois, whom it was our duty to turn into good citizens. They are not pampered there, I imagine,\" he went on drily; \"and if citizen Marat sent his--er--adopted son there, it was not with a view to having him brought up as an aristo, what?\"  \"The child was not to be brought up at all,\" the woman said gruffly. \"I have often heard citizen Marat say that he hoped the brat would prove a thief when he grew up, and would take to alcoholism like a duck takes to water.\"  \"And you know nothing of the child's parents?\"  \"Nothing, citizen. I had to go to Pantin once a month and have a look at him and report to citizen Marat. But I always had the same tale to tell. The child was looking more and more like a young reprobate every time I saw him.\"  \"Did citizen Marat pay the Leridans for keeping the child?\"  \"Oh, no, citizen! The Leridans make a trade of the children by sending them out to beg. But this one was not to be allowed out yet. Citizen Marat's orders were very stern, and he was wont to terrify the Leridans with awful threats of the guillotine if they ever allowed the child out of their sight.\"  Chauvelin sat silent for a while. A ray of light had traversed the dark and tortuous ways of his subtle brain. While he mused the woman became impatient. She continued to talk on with the volubility peculiar to her kind. He paid no heed to her, until one phrase struck his ear.  \"So now,\" Jeannette Marechal was saying, \"I don't know what to do. The ring has disappeared, and the Leridans are suspicious.\"  \"The ring?\" queried Chauvelin curtly. \"What ring?\"  \"As I was telling you, citizen,\" she replied querulously, \"when I went to see the child, the citizen Marat always gave me this ring to show to the Leridans. Without I brought the ring they would not admit me inside their door. They were so terrified with all the citizen's threats of the guillotine.\"  \"And now you say the ring has disappeared. Since when?\"  \"Well, citizen,\" replied Jeannette blandly, \"since you took poor Paul Mole into custody.\"  \"What do you mean?\" Chauvelin riposted. \"What had Paul Mole to do with the child and the ring?\"  \"Only this, citizen, that he was to have gone to Pantin last night instead of me. And thankful I was not to have to go. Citizen Marat gave the ring to Mole, I suppose. I know he intended to give it to him. He spoke to me about it just before that execrable woman came and murdered him. Anyway, the ring has gone and Mole too. So I imagine that Mole has the ring and--\"  \"That's enough!\" Chauvelin broke in roughly. \"You can go!\"  \"But, citizen--\"  \"You can go, I said,\" he reiterated sharply. \"The matter of the child and the Leridans and the ring no longer concerns you. You understand?\"  \"Y--y--yes, citizen,\" murmured Jeannette, vaguely terrified.  And of a truth the change in citizen Chauvelin's demeanour was enough to scare any timid creature. Not that he raved or ranted or screamed. Those were not his ways. He still sat beside his desk as he had done before, and his slender hand, so like the talons of a vulture, was clenched upon the arm of his chair. But there was such a look of inward fury and of triumph in his pale, deep-set eyes, such lines of cruelty around his thin, closed lips, that Jeannette Marechal, even with the picture before her mind of Jean Paul Marat in his maddest moods, fled, with the unreasoning terror of her kind, before the sternly controlled, fierce passion of this man.  Chauvelin never noticed that she went. He sat for a long time, silent and immovable. Now he understood. Thank all the Powers of Hate and Revenge, no thought of disappointment was destined to embitter the overflowing cup of his triumph. He had not only brought his arch-enemy to his knees, but had foiled one of his audacious ventures. How clear the whole thing was! The false Paul Mole, the newly acquired menial in the household of Marat, had wormed himself into the confidence of his employer in order to wrest from him the secret of the aristo's child. Bravo! bravo! my gallant Scarlet Pimpernel! Chauvelin now could see it all. Tragedies such as that which had placed an aristo's child in the power of a cunning demon like Marat were not rare these days, and Chauvelin had been fitted by nature and by temperament to understand and appreciate an execrable monster of the type of Jean Paul Marat.  And Paul Mole, the grimy, degraded servant of the indigent demagogue, the loathsome mask which hid the fastidious personality of Sir Percy Blakeney, had made a final and desperate effort to possess himself of the ring which would deliver the child into his power. Now, having failed in his machinations, he was safe under lock and key--guarded on sight. The next twenty-four hours would see him unmasked, awaiting his trial and condemnation under the scathing indictment prepared by Fouquier-Tinville, the unerring Public Prosecutor. The day after that, the tumbril and the guillotine for that execrable English spy, and the boundless sense of satisfaction that his last intrigue had aborted in such a signal and miserable manner.  Of a truth Chauvelin at this hour had every cause to be thankful, and it was with a light heart that he set out to interview the Leridans.   VIII  The Leridans, anxious, obsequious, terrified, were only too ready to obey the citizen Representative in all things.  They explained with much complacency that, even though they were personally acquainted with Jeannette Marechal, when the citizeness presented herself this very morning without the ring they had refused her permission to see the brat.  Chauvelin, who in his own mind had already reconstructed the whole tragedy of the stolen child, was satisfied that Marat could not have chosen more efficient tools for the execution of his satanic revenge than these two hideous products of revolutionary Paris.  Grasping, cowardly, and avaricious, the Leridans would lend themselves to any abomination for a sufficiency of money; but no money on earth would induce them to risk their own necks in the process. Marat had obviously held them by threats of the guillotine. They knew the power of the \"Friend of the People,\" and feared him accordingly. Chauvelin's scarf of office, his curt, authoritative manner, had an equally awe-inspiring effect upon the two miserable creatures. They became absolutely abject, cringing, maudlin in their protestations of good-will and loyalty. No one, they vowed, should as much as see the child--ring or no ring--save the citizen Representative himself. Chauvelin, however, had no wish to see the child. He was satisfied that its name was Lannoy--for the child had remembered it when first he had been brought to the Leridans. Since then he had apparently forgotten it, even though he often cried after his \"Maman!\"  Chauvelin listened to all these explanations with some impatience. The child was nothing to him, but the Scarlet Pimpernel had desired to rescue it from out of the clutches of the Leridans; had risked his all--and lost it--in order to effect that rescue! That in itself was a sufficient inducement for Chauvelin to interest himself in the execution of Marat's vengeance, whatever its original mainspring may have been.  At any rate, now he felt satisfied that the child was safe, and that the Leridans were impervious to threats or bribes which might land them on the guillotine.  All that they would own to was to being afraid.  \"Afraid of what?\" queried Chauvelin sharply.  That the brat may be kidnapped ... stolen. Oh! he could not be decoyed ... they were too watchful for that! But apparently there were mysterious agencies at work....  \"Mysterious agencies!\" Chauvelin laughed aloud at the suggestion. The \"mysterious agency\" was even now rotting in an obscure cell at the Abbaye. What other powers could be at work on behalf of the brat?  Well, the Leridans had had a warning!  What warning?  \"A letter,\" the man said gruffly. \"But as neither my wife nor I can read--\"  \"Why did you not speak of this before?\" broke in Chauvelin roughly. \"Let me see the letter.\"  The woman produced a soiled and dank scrap of paper from beneath her apron. Of a truth she could not read its contents, for they were writ in English in the form of a doggerel rhyme which caused Chauvelin to utter a savage oath.  \"When did this come?\" he asked. \"And how?\"  \"This morning, citizen,\" the woman mumbled in reply. \"I found it outside the door, with a stone on it to prevent the wind from blowing it away. What does it mean, citizen?\" she went on, her voice shaking with terror, for of a truth the citizen Representative looked as if he had seen some weird and unearthly apparition.  He gave no reply for a moment or two, and the two catiffs had no conception of the tremendous effort at self-control which was hidden behind the pale, rigid mask of the redoubtable man.  \"It probably means nothing that you need fear,\" Chauvelin said quietly at last. \"But I will see the Commissary of the Section myself, and tell him to send a dozen men of the Surete along to watch your house and be at your beck and call if need be. Then you will feel quite safe, I hope.\"  \"Oh, yes! quite safe, citizen!\" the woman replied with a sigh of genuine relief. Then only did Chauvelin turn on his heel and go his way.   IX  But that crumpled and soiled scrap of paper given to him by the woman Leridan still lay in his clenched hand as he strode back rapidly citywards. It seemed to scorch his palm. Even before he had glanced at the contents he knew what they were. That atrocious English doggerel, the signature--a five-petalled flower traced in crimson! How well he knew them!  \"We seek him here, we seek him there!\"  The most humiliating moments in Chauvelin's career were associated with that silly rhyme, and now here it was, mocking him even when he knew that his bitter enemy lay fettered and helpless, caught in a trap, out of which there was no escape possible; even though he knew for a positive"]]]
