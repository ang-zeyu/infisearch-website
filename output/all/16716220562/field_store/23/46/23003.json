Later she will probably allow us to hear the closing melody of the 'Ecce tu pulchra es', which, with such good reason, delighted the Queen of Hungary, and myself no less.\"  He seated himself at the table as he spoke, and devoted himself to the dishes offered him so eagerly that it was difficult to believe in the deep, yearning emotion that ruled him.  Only the marquise at his side and Malfalconnet, who had joined the attendant nobles, perceived that he ate more rapidly than usual, and paid no attention to the preparation of the viands.  The aged eyes, of the Emperor's watchful companion, to whom up to the close of the repast he addressed only a few scattered words, also detected something else.  Rarely, but nevertheless several times, the Emperor glanced at the boy choir, and when, in doing so, his Majesty's eyes met the singer's, it was done in a way which proved to the marquise, who had acquired profound experience at the French court, that an understanding existed between the sovereign and the artist which could scarcely date from that day.  This circumstance must be considered, and behind the narrow, wrinkled brow of the old woman, whose cradle had stood in a ducal palace, thronged a succession of thoughts and plans precisely similar to those which had filled the inind of the dressmaker and ex-maid ere she gave Barbara her farewell kiss.  What the marquise at first had merely conjectured and put together from various signs, became, by constant assiduous observation, complete cer- tainty when the singer, after a tolerably long pause, joined in Josquin's hymn to the Virgin.  In the Benedictio Mensae she remained silent, but at the first effective passage joined in the singing of the boys.  Not until the 'Tu pulchra es' did she display the full power of her art.  From the commencement she took part in the execution of this magnificent composition eagerly and with deep feeling, and when the closing bars began and the magic of her singing developed all its heart-thrilling power, the watchful lady in waiting perceived that his Majesty forgot the food and hung on Barbara's lips as though spellbound.  This was something unprecedented.  But when the monarch continued for some time to display an abstemiousness so unlike him, the marquise cast a hasty glance of inquiry at Malfalconnet.  But the affirmative answer which she expected did not come.  Had the baron's keen eve failed to notice so important a matter, or had his Majesty taken him into his confidence and commanded him to keep the secret?  That Malfalconnet was merely avoiding making common cause with the old intriguer, was a suspicion which vanity led her to reject the more positively the more frequently her countryman sought her to learn what he desired to know.  Besides, she soon required no further confirmation, for what now happened put an end to every doubt.  Barbara had to sing the \"Quia amore langueo\" again, and how it sounded this time to the listening hearer!  No voice which the Emperor Charles had ever heard had put such pure, bewitching melody into this expression of the deepest yearning.  It seemed as though the longing of the whole world was flowing to him from those fresh, young, beautifully formed red lips.  A heart which was not itself languishing for love could not pour forth to another with such convincing truth, overwhelming power, and glowing fervour the ardent longing of a soul seized by the omnipotence of love.  The mighty pressure of rising surges of yearning dashed against the monarch's heart, and with tremendous impetuosity roused on all sides the tender desires which for a long time had been gathering in his soul.  It seemed as though this \"Because I long for love\" was blending with the long-repressed and now uncontrollable yearning that filled his own breast, and he was obliged to restrain himself in order not to rush toward this gifted singer, this marvellously lovely woman, whose heart was his, and, before the eyes of all, clasp her in his embrace.  The master of dissimulation forgot himself, and--what a delight to the eyes of the marquise!--the Emperor Charles, the great epicure and thirsty drinker, left the pasty and the wine, to listen standing, with hands resting on the table and outstretched head, to Barbara's voice.  It seemed as though he feared his ear might miss a note of this song, his eye a movement of this source of melody.  But when the song ceased, and Barbara, panting for breath, returned the ardent look of gratitude and delight which beamed upon her from his eyes, the Emperor left the table, and, without noticing Count Krockow, who was just lifting the silver cover from the roast capon, the last of the five dishes ordered, went up to Barbara.  Would he really end the meal now?  The old marquise thought it impossible, but if the incredible event occurred, then things were to be expected, things----  But ere she had imagined how this unprecedented event could take place, the Emperor himself informed her, for, half addressing Barbara, half the lady in waiting, he exclaimed in a slightly muffled tone: \"Thanks, cordial thanks for this great pleasure, my dear Jungfrau!  But we wish to add to words another token of appreciation, a token of more lasting duration.--Do us the favour, Marquise de Leria, to conduct this noble artist to the upper rooms, that she may receive what we intended for her.\"  He left the hall as he spoke; but the marquise beckoned to Barbara, detained her with words of sweet flattery a short time and then, with the young girl, ascended the stairs up which the Emperor had preceded them.  Meanwhile the old noblewoman continued to talk with her; but Barbara did not listen.  While following her guide, it seemed as though the steps her light foot trod were a heavenly ladder, and at their end the gates of Paradise would open.  She felt with inexpressible delight that she had never before succeeded so well in expressing a strong feeling in music, and what her song endeavoured to tell the Emperor--no, the man whom she loved--had been understood, and found an echo in his soul.  Could there be a greater happiness?  And yet, while she was approaching him, he must be awaiting her.  She had wished to arouse his attention, his approval, his delight in her singing.  All three had become hers, and now new wishes had mastered her, and probably him also.  She desired his love, he hers, and, fearing herself, she felt the great peril into which her aged companion was conducting her.  The Emperor was indeed thegreatest and noblest of men!  The mere consciousness that he desired not only her singing, but her heart, inspired the deepest bliss.  Yet it seemed as if she ought not to cross the threshold of the room which opened before her; as if she ought to rush down the stairs and fly from him, as she had dashed away when his messengers wished to lead her to his presence.  But he was already advancing from the end of the large apartment, and the mere sight of him put an end to every further consideration and crushed her will.  Obedient to a glance from the Emperor's eyes, the marquise, bowing reverently, retreated into the corridor whence they had come and closed the door.  The clang against the jambs told Barbara that she was alone with the ruler of half the world, whom she dared to love.  But she was not granted a moment to collect her thoughts; the Emperor Charles already stood before her, and with the exclamation, \"Quia amore langueo!\" opened his arms.  She, too, was longing for love, and, as if intoxicated by the lofty feeling of being deemed worthy of the heart of this mighty sovereign, she yielded to his kisses; and as she herself threw her arm around his neck and felt--that she had a right to do so, it seemed as though an invisible hand was placing a royal crown upon her brow.  The joy which filled her little heart appeared too rich and great for it when, repeating the \"Amore langueo\" with her head upon his breast, he whispered sweet love phrases and confessed that those words, since she had sung them for the first time, had echoed through his hours of reflection, through the cares of business, through the brief hours of repose which he allowed himself, and so it must continue, and her love, her voice, and her beauty render the downward path of life the fairest portion which he had traversed.  Then Barbara, with the low exclamation, \"Because I, too, long for love,\" again offered him her lips, and he accepted the sweet invitation with impetuous passion.  Already, for the second time since her entrance, the clock on Charles's writing-table struck the quarter of an hour, and, as if startled from a deep slumber, she withdrew from his embrace and gazed, as if bewildered, toward the door.  Directly after it opened, and Don Luis Quijada with firm step entered the room.  The trusted favourite of the Emperor was always free to seek his presence.  He had returned to Ratisbon in advance of the Queen of Hungary, who would not arrive until the following morning, and, after a brief conversation with Malfalconnet and Master Adrian, the loyal nobleman had gone without delay, and at the risk of angering him, to his imperial master.  Without even rising from the divan, and still clasping the hand which Barbara attempted to withdraw as Don Luis advanced, Charles asked with stern rebuke what had caused his entrance at so late an hour.  Quijada requested a brief audience, but Charles replied that he had nothing to conceal from this companion.  A low bow followed this remark; then, with quiet dignity, the major-domo reported that the leaders of the orchestra and the boy choir had been waiting below--and with them Sir Wolf Hartschwert and an old gentleman, the father of this lady--a considerable time for her return.  So it seemed to him advisable, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5564"],["title","Barbara Blomberg â€” Volume 04 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by David Widger <widger@cecomet.net>    [NOTE: There is a short list of bookmarks, or pointers, at the end of the file for those who may wish to sample the author's ideas before making an entire meal of them.  D.W.]      BARBARA BLOMBERG  By Georg Ebers  Volume 4.     CHAPTER XVI.  \"Poor Wolf!\" old Ursel had exclaimed.  But whoever had met the young knight the following morning, as he went up the stairs to the Blombergs' rooms, would have deemed him, like Baron Malfalconnet, the happiest of mortals.  He had obeyed Dr. Hiltner's summons, and remained a long time with him. Then he went home at a rapid pace, for he longed to tell Barbara how fair a prospect for their future was opening before him.  She had showed her liking for him plainly enough yesterday when they parted.  What should prevent her from becoming his now that he could promise an ample income?  There was some one stirring in the private chapel as he passed, but he paid no heed; in former days many people from the neighbourhood prayed here frequently.  He found no one in the Blombergs' home except the father.  Barbara would certainly return immediately, the old man said.  She had gone down to the chapel a short time before.  She was not in the habit of doing so at this hour, but the great favour shown her by the Emperor had probably gone to her head, and who could wonder?  Wolf also thought it natural that so great a success should excite her powerfully: but he, too, had a similar one to relate, and, with joyful emotion, he now told the old gentleman what the syndic had offered.  The Council, which, by the establishment of the \"Convivium,\" had already provided for the fostering of the noble art of music, wished to do still more.  The project had been dear to the recently deceased Martin Luther, and the Ratisbon syndic, who had enjoyed his friendship, thought he was carrying out his wishes----  Here Wolf was interrupted, for the table groaned under the blow of the old warrior's still powerful fist, coupled with the exclamation: \"So there is still to be no rest from the accursed disturber of the peace, although he is dead!  No offence, my lad; but there can be nothing edifying to a good Christian where that Wittenberg fellow is concerned.\"  \"Only have patience,\" Wolf interposed here, secure of victory, and now, slightly vexed with himself for his imprudence in mentioning Martin Luther's name to the old hater of Turks and heretics, he explained that Dr. Hiltner, in the name of the Council, had offered him the position of Damian Feys, Barbara's teacher.  The Netherlander was going home, and the magistrate was glad to have found in him, Wolf, a native of Ratisbon who would be no less skilled in fostering music in this good city.  To bind him securely, and avoid the danger of a speedy invitation elsewhere, the position offered was provided with an annual salary hitherto unprecedented in this country, and which far exceeded that of many an imperial councillor.  This had been rendered possible through a bequest, whose interest was to be devoted to the development of music, and--if he should accept the place--to him and his future wife.  When he heard this, he would fain have instantly bestowed the most beautiful candles upon the Holy Virgin, but the scruple concerning religion had prevented his rejoicing fully; and when he told the syndic that under no circumstances could he abandon the old faith, it was done with the fear that the glittering bird would fly away from him.  But the result had been different, for Dr. Hiltner replied that religion did not enter into the matter.  He knew Wolf and his peaceful nature, and therefore hoped that he would be advised that music was a language equally intelligible to all persons of feeling, whatever tongue they spoke and whatever creed they preferred.  This opinion was also that of the Catholic maestro Feys, and he had therefore escaped all difficulty. Wolf must, of course, consider the circumstances which he would find here.  If he would accommodate himself to them, the Council would be willing to overlook his faith; besides, Hiltner, on his own authority, had given him the three days' time to reflect, for which he had asked on Barbara's account.  A long-drawn \"H'm\" from Blomberg followed this disclosure.  Then he shook his clumsy head, and, grasping his mustache with his hand, as if he wanted in that way to stop the motion of his head, he said thoughtfully: \"Not a whole thing, Wolf, rather a double one, or--if we look at it differently--it is only a half, for an honest friend of our Holy Church. The way into which they tempt you is paved with gold, but--but--I see the snares and pitfalls----\"  He rose as he spoke, muttering all sorts of unintelligible things, until he finally exclaimed, \"Yet perhaps one might----\"  Then he looked impatiently toward the door, and asked: \"Where is the girl loitering?  Would Eve probably bite the apple of temptation also?\"  \"Shall I call her?\" cried Wolf eagerly.  \"No, no,\" said the captain.  \"It is sinful to disturb even our nearest relatives at prayer.  Besides, you would not believe how the maestro's praises and the imperial gift have excited the vanity in her woman's nature.  For the first time in I know not how many years, she overslept the hour of mass.  It was probably ten o'clock when I knocked at her chamber door.  Toward eleven there was a movement in her room.  Then I opened the door to bid her good-morning, but she neither heard nor saw anything, and knelt at the priedieu as if turned to stone.  Before going to sleep and early in the morning I expect such things, but when it is almost noon!  Her porridge still stood untouched on the table here, and to-day there is no occasion for fasting.  But I did not like to disturb her, and perhaps she would still be kneeling before the Virgin's image if the maid-servant hadn't blundered in to carry a bouquet which Herr Peter Schlumperger's servant had brought.  Then Barbara started up as if a hornet had stung her.  And how she looked at me!  Once--I knew it instantly--I had gazed into such a matvellously beautiful face, such helpless blue eyes.  Afterward I remembered who and where it had been. God guard me from sinning against my own child, but that was exactly the way the young girl looked who they--it was farther back in the past than you can remember--burned here for a witch, as the halberdiers and monks led her to the place of execution.  Susanne Schindler--that was her name --was the daughter of a respectable notary's clerk, who was obliged to wander about the world a great deal, and perished in Hungary just as she reached womanhood.  Her mother had died when she was born, and an old woman had taken care of her out of friendship.  People called the lass 'beautiful Susel,' and she was wonderfully charming.  Pink and white, like the maiden in the fairy tale, and with glittering golden hair just like my Wawerl's.  The old woman with whom she lived--her aunt or some other relative--had long practised the healing of all sorts of infirmities, and when a young Spanish count, who had come here with the Emperor Charles to the Reichstag in the year '31, fell under his horse in leaping a ditch, his limbs were injured so that he could not use them. As he did not recover under the care of the Knights of St. John, who first nursed him, he went to the herb doctress, and she took charge of him, and cured him, too, although the skill of the most famous doctors and surgeons had failed to help him.  \"But, to make amends, Satan, who probably had the largest share in the miracle, visited him with the sorest evil, for 'beautiful Susel,' who was the old woman's assistant, had so bewitched the young count that he not only fell in love with her, but actually desired to make her his wife.  \"Then all the noble relatives at home interfered.  The Holy Inquisition commanded the investigation of the case, and sent a stern vicar general to direct the proceedings of the Dominicans, who had seized the temptress.  Then it came to light that 'beautiful Susel' had bewitched the luckless young count and robbed him of reason by her wicked arts.  \"The old woman, whom they had also examined, escaped her just punishment because she died of the plague, which was raging here at that time, but 'beautiful Susel' was burned, and I looked on while it was done.  \"When the Dominicans had led her to the stake, she turned toward the people who had flocked here from all quarters.  Many doubtless pitied her on account of her marvellous beauty, and because the devil had given her the mask of the most touching kindness of heart; but she gazed directly into my face with her large, blue eyes as I stood close by, and for years I saw the witch's look distinctly before me.  Yet what do we not at last forget?  And now it must happen that what reminded me of her again is my own innocent child!  Wawerl just looked into my eyes as if 'beautiful Susel' had risen from her grave.  It was not long, yet it seemed as if she shrank in terror from me, her own clear father.  She gazed up at me in helpless despair, as if she feared God and the world.  \"I have learned little about shivering, but a chill ran down my spine. Of course, I did not let her notice anything.  Poor child!  after the honour bestowed yesterday, I thought there would be nothing to-day except laughter and loud singing.  But my grandmother used to say that the grief which tortures a young girl--she herself knows not why--is the hardest to bear, and then Barbara must now make up her mind about marriage, for, besides you, there are Peter Schlumperger and young Crafft to be considered.  \"I remembered all this, and so, as usual, I took her face between my hands to give her her morning kiss.  She always offers me her lips, but to-day she turned away so that my mouth barely brushed her cheeks. 'Women's whims!' I thought, and therefore let it pass.  You can imagine how glad I should have been to hear something more"]]]
