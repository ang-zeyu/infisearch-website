Seated in a chair, apparently awaiting her turn, was a young lady, whose face was half-concealed by a thick, green veil.  When the two gentlemen were disposed of, the agent spoke to the young lady.  \"What can I do for you, miss?\" he asked.  \"I am in no hurry, sir,\" she answered, in a low voice. \"I will wait for those boys.\"  \"What's your business, boys?\" demanded the agent, shrugging his shoulders.  \"When does the next steamer start, sir?\" inquired Ben.  \"In three days.\"  \"What is the price of passage?\"  \"First-class?\"  \"No, sir, the cheapest.\"  \"One hundred dollars. Do you wish to secure passage?\"  \"Not this morning, sir.\"  The agent shrugged his shoulders again, as if to say \"I thought so,\" and turned again to the young lady.  \"Now, miss,\" he said.  \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" she said hurriedly. \"I will call again.\"  As she spoke, she left the office, following the two boys so quickly that they almost went out together.  Ben had not taken particular notice of the young lady, and was much surprised when he felt a hand laid on his arm, and, turning, his eyes fell npon her face.  \"May I speak a few words with you?\" she said.  \"Certainly,\" answered Ben politely, though he could not conceal his astonishment.  The young lady looked uneasily at Tom, and hesitated.  \"Won't you move away a few steps, Tom?\" said Ben, understanding the look.  \"Thank you,\" said the young lady, in a low voice. \"Are you intending to sail for California by the next steamer?\"  \"I should like to, miss, but I am poor, and I don't know whether I can afford the expense of a ticket.\"  \"Would you go if your ticket were paid-by a friend?\"  \"You bet I would-I mean I certainly would,\" answered Ben, correcting his phraseology, as he remembered that he was addressing a young lady, and not one of his boy friends.  \"Would you be willing to take care of me--that is, to look after me?\"  Ben was certainly surprised; but he answered promptly and with native politeness: \"It would be a pleasure to me.\"  \"You were going alone-you had no friends with you?\"  \"None at all, miss.\"  \"That is well,\" she said. \"What is your name?\"  \"Ben Stanton.\"  \"Do you live in the city?\"  \"No, miss. I came from the small town of Hampton.\"  \"Where are you staying?\"  \"Nowhere. I only arrived in the city this morning.\"  \"Will you be able to go by the next steamer?\"  Ben hesitated. It almost took away his breath--it seemed so sudden-but he reflected that there really was no reason why he should not, and he answered in the affirmative.  \"Then go back with me, and I will engage passage for us both.\"  The young lady and Ben reentered the office, Tom Cooper looking on with astonishment. She approached the counter, this time with confidence, and the agent came forward.  \"I have concluded to engage passage for myself and this lad,\" she said.  The agent regarded her with surprise.  \"Both first-class?\" he asked.  \"Certainly, sir. I should like the lad to occupy a stateroom near mine.\"  \"Very well. I will show you on the plan those that are unengaged. I cannot give either of you a stateroom to yourselves. I can give you a room with a very agreeable lady, a Mrs. Dunbar, and the boy can occupy part of the adjoining room.\"  \"Very well, sir.\"  \"What name?\" continued the agent.  \"Ida Sinclair,\" answered the young lady, with visible hesitation.  \"And the boy's name?\"  Miss Sinclair had forgotten; but Ben promptly answered for himself.  The young lady drew out her pocketbook, and produced several large bills, out of which she paid the passage money. Then, turning to Ben, she said: \"Now we will go.\"  Ben followed her out of the office, feeling completely bewildered. Well he might. The young lady had paid two hundred and fifty dollars for his passage, and for this large outlay only required him to take care of her. No wonder he thought it strange.  \"You say you are not staying at any hotel?\" said the young lady, as they emerged into the street.  \"No, Miss Sinclair.\"  \"I am staying at the Astor House, and it is important that you should be with me, as I may have some errands on which to employ you.\"  \"Is it an expensive hotel?\" asked Ben.  \"That will not matter to you, as I shall pay the bill.\"  \"Thank you, Miss Sinclair; but you are spending a great deal of money for me.\"  \"I have an object in doing so. Besides, I have no lack of money.\"  \"Shall I go with you to the hotel now?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"May I speak a moment to the boy who was with me?\"  \"Certainly.\"  \"May I tell him where I am going?\"  \"Yes, but ask him to keep it to himself.\"  \"I will, Miss Sinclair,\" and Ben was about to walk away.  \"On the whole, call the boy here,\" said Miss Sinclair. \"Tom!\" Tom Cooper answered the summons.  \"I am going to California with this lady,\" said Ben. \"She has paid my passage.\"  \"You're in luck!\" exclaimed Tom. \"Say, miss, you don't want a boy to go along to black your boots, do you?\"  Miss Sinclair smiled faintly.  \"I think not,\" she answered.  \"Tom,\" continued Ben, \"you won't say a word about my going, will you?\"  \"Not if you don't want me to. Besides, there ain't nobody to tell.\"  Miss Sinclair looked relieved. She drew out her pocketbook, and took from it a ten-dollar bill.  \"What is your name?\" she asked.  \"Tom Cooper, ma'am.\"  \"Then, Tom, allow me to offer you a small present.\"  \"Is it all for me?\" exclaimed Tom, in amazement.  \"Yes.\"  Tom thrust it into his vest pocket, and immediately executed a somersault, rather to Miss Sinclair's alarm.  \"Excuse me, ma'am,\" said Tom, assuming his natural posture; \"I couldn't help it, I felt so excited. I never was so rich before.\"  \"May I tell Tom where we are going to stop?\" asked Ben.  \"Certainly, if he will keep it to himself.\"  \"I shall be at the Astor House, Tom. Come round and see me.\"  Tom watched the two as they preceded him on their way to Broadway.  \"I wonder if I'm dreaming,\" he said to himself. \"If I am, I hope I won't wake up till I've spent this ten dollars. I guess I'll go to the Old Bowery to-night.\"     CHAPTER IX.  AT THE ASTOR HOUSE.   As they walked up to the hotel together, Miss Sinclair said: \"You are probably surprised at what has taken place, but I have strong reasons for acting as I have done.\"  \"I don't doubt it, Miss Sinclair,\" returned Ben.  \"It is desirable that I should tell you-\"  \"Don't tell me anything unless you like, Miss Sinclair. I am not troubled with curiosity.\"  \"Thank you, but in the confidential relations which we are to hold toward each other, it is necessary that you should understand my position. I will reserve my explanation, however, till we reach the hotel.\"  \"We are to stop at the Astor House?\"  \"Yes, and I wish you to put down my name and your own on the register, and obtain two rooms as near together as convenient.\"  \"Very well, Miss Sinclair.\"  \"You may put me down as from-well, from Philadelphia.\"  \"All right. Shall I put myself down from Philadelphia, too?\"  \"Not unless you choose. Your native village will answer. By the way, you are to pass for my cousin, and it will be better, therefore, that you should call me by my first name-Ida.\"  \"I wouldn't take the liberty but for your wishing it.\"  \"I do wish it-otherwise it would be difficult to pass you off as my cousin.\"  \"All right, Miss Sinclair-I mean Ida.\"  \"That is better. I shall call you Ben.\"  \"You couldn't very well call me Mr. Stanton,\" said our hero, smiling.  \"Not very well. But here we are at the hotel. We will go in together. I will go to the ladies' parlor, and you can join me there after securing rooms at the office.\"  \"Very well-Ida.\"  Of course Ben was not used to city hotels, and he was a little afraid that he should not go to work properly, but he experienced no difficulty. He stepped up to the desk, and said to the clerk:  \"I should like to engage rooms for my cousin and myself.\"  The clerk pushed the register toward him.  Ben inscribed the names. At first he could not remember his companion's last name, and it made him feel awkward. Fortunately it came to him in time.  \"We can give you rooms on the third floor. Will that do?\"  \"Yes, sir, I think so. We would like to be near together.\"  \"Very well. I can give you two rooms directly opposite to each other.\"  \"That will do, sir.\"  The clerk touched a bell, and a porter presented himself:  \"Here are the keys of sixty-six and sixty-eight,\" said the hotel clerk. \"Take this young gentleman's luggage to sixty-six, and show the lady with him to number sixty-eight.\"  Ben followed the porter, pausing at the door of the ladies' parlor, where his companion awaited him.  \"Come, Ida,\" he said, feeling a little awkward at addressing Miss Sinclair so familiarly. \"The servant is ready to show us our rooms.\"  \"Very well, Ben,\" said Miss Sinclair, smiling. She did not seem so nervous now.  As the clerk had said, the rooms were directly opposite each other. They were large and very comfortable in appearance. As Miss Sinclair entered her room she said:  \"Join me in the ladies' parlor in fifteen minutes, Ben. I have something to say to you.\"  Ben looked around him with considerable satisfaction. He had only left home that morning; he had met with a severe disappointment, and yet he was now fortunate beyond his most sanguine hopes. He had heard a great deal of the Astor House, which in Hampton and throughout the country was regarded at that time as the most aristocratic hotel in New York, and now he was actually a guest in it. Moreover, he was booked for a first-class passage to California.  \"It's like the Arabian Nights,\" thought Ben, \"and Miss Sinclair must be a fairy.\"  He took out his scanty wardrobe from the carpetbag, and put it away in one of the drawers of the bureau.  \"I might just as well enjoy all the privileges of the hotel,\" he said to himself.  He took out his brush and comb, and brushed his hair. Then he locked the door of No. 66 and went down-stairs to the ladies' parlor.  He did not have to wait long. In five minutes Miss "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5623"],["title","The Young Explorer; Or, Claiming His Fortune (#6)"],["body","made her appearance.  \"Ben,\" she said, \"here is the check for my trunk. You may take it down to the office and ask them to send for it. Then come back and I will acquaint you with some things I wish you to know.\"  Ben speedily reappeared, and at Miss Sinclair's request sat down beside her on a sofa.  \"You must know, Ben,\" she commenced, \"that I am flying from my guardian.\"  \"I hope it's all right,\" said Ben, rather frightened. He was not sure but he was making himself liable to arrest for aiding and abetting Miss Sinclair's flight.  \"You have no cause for alarm. He has no legal control over me, though by the terms of my father's will he retains charge of my property till I attain my twenty-fifth year. Before this, fourteen months must elapse. Meanwhile he is exerting all his influence to induce me to marry his son, so that the large property of which I am possessed may accrue to the benefit of his family.\"  \"He couldn't force you to marry his son, could he?\" asked Ben.  \"No, but he has made it very disagreeable to me to oppose him, and has even gone so far as to threaten me with imprisonment in a madhouse if I do not yield to his persuasions.\"  \"He must be a rascal!\" said our hero indignantly.  \"He is,\" said Miss Sinclair quietly.  \"I don't see how he can do such things in a free country.\"  \"He has only to buy over two unscrupulous physicians, and in a large city that can easily be done. On their certificate of my insanity I might any day be dragged to a private asylum and confined there.\"  \"I don't wonder you ran away, Ida.\"  \"I feel perfectly justified in doing so. Liberty and the control of my own person are dear to me, and I mean to struggle for them.\"  \"What makes you think of going to California? is it because it is so far off?\"  \"Partly; but there is another reason,\" said Miss Sinclair. \"I will not conceal from you that there is a person there whom I wish to meet.\"  \"Is it a young man?\" asked Ben shrewdly.  \"You have guessed it. Richard Dewey is the son of a former bookkeeper of my father. He is poor, but he is a gentleman, and there is a mutual attachment between us. Indeed, he asked my guardian's consent to his suit, but he was repelled with insult, and charged with being a fortune-hunter. That name would better apply to my guardian and his precious son.\"  \"Is Mr. Dewey in California?\"  \"Yes; he went out there some months since. He promised to write me regularly, but I have not heard a word from him. I know very well that he has written, and that my guardian has suppressed his letters.\"  \"That is shameful!\" said Ben warmly.  \"It is indeed; but with your help I think I can circumvent Mr. Campbell yet.\"  \"Mr. Campbell is your guardian, I suppose, Ida?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You may reply upon me to help you in every way possible, Miss Sinclair.\"  \"Ida,\" corrected the young lady.  \"I mean Ida.\"  \"That's right, Cousin Ben.\"  Now that Miss Sinclair's veil was removed, our hero could see that she was very pretty, and perhaps he felt all the more proud of being selected as her escort. But on one point he was in the dark.  \"May I ask you a question, Ida?\" he said. \"How is it that you have chosen me-a stranger, and so young-as your escort? I am only a green country boy.\"  \"Partly because I like your looks; you look honest and trustworthy.\"  \"Thank you, but I am only a boy.\"  \"That's all the better for me. It would not do for me to accept the escort of a man, and it would be awkward for me to propose it even if it would do.\"  \"At any rate, I am lucky to be selected. I hope you will be satisfied with me.\"  \"I feel sure of it.\"  \"You are spending a great deal of money for me.\"  \"You may feel surprised that I have so much money to spend independent of my guardian, but he has control only of the property left by my father. My mother left me thirty thousand dollars, of which I am sole mistress.\"  \"That is lucky for you.\"  \"Under present circumstances-yes.\"  Here two ladies entered the parlor, and the conversation was suspended.  \"I believe I will go in to dinner now,\" said Miss Sinclair. \"Will you come, Ben?\"  \"I ate dinner an hour ago.\"  \"Then you can go where you please. Meet me here at six o'clock.\"  \"All right, Ida.\"     CHAPTER X.  BEN RECEIVES A CALL.   Ben had scarcely left the room when it occurred to him that he ought to send home for the remainder of his clothes. He did not like to do so, however, without first consulting Miss Sinclair.  \"Well, Ben?\" said the young lady inquiringly.  \"I would like to write home for my clothes, if you have no objection.\"  \"Certainly; but don't say anything about me.\"  \"All right.\"  Ben went to the reading-room, and, procuring writing-materials, penned the following letter to his uncle:  \"ASTOR HOUSE, NEW YORK.  \"DEAR UNCLE JOB: Will you send me the rest of my clothes at once, by express? You may direct to this hotel, where I am now staying. The firm that I came to see turned out to be swindlers, and I was at first quite disappointed; but I have made other friends, and am to sail for California next Saturday. This may seem sudden to you. At any rate it does to me, and I don't expect to realize it till I am fairly at sea. It will be some time before I can write you, but I will send you a line from Panama, if possible. You needn't send me any more of my money, for I have with me all I shall need at present.  \"Give my love to aunt and Cousin Jenny. I should like to see you all again before I start, but I cannot spare the time. I am in good health and spirits, and I think my prospects are good. Your affectionate nephew, BEN.\"  This letter excited considerable surprise in Hampton.  \"I'm afraid Ben's gettin' extravagant,\" said Uncle Job. \"I've always heerd that the Astor House is a fashionable hotel where they charge big prices. Ben ought to have gone to a cheap place, and saved his money.\"  \"He says he's got money enough with him, father,\" said Mrs. Stanton. \"How much did he take away with him?\"  \"Seventy-five dollars.\"  \"And he had to pay his passage to California out of that?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"He won't have much left when he gets to California, then.\"  \"No, he won't.\"  \"Don't you think you'd better send him some?\"  \"No, wife. Ben says no, and I'm goin' accordin' to his directions. I suppose he knows best what he wants.\"  Sam Sturgis did not often condescend to notice Job Stanton, but his curiosity got the better of his pride, and, meeting the old man a short time afterward, he asked: \"Have you heard anythiug from Ben?\"  \"Yes, he writ me a letter from New York. I got it this mornin'?\"  \"Has he got a chance to black boots?\" asked Sam, with a sneer.  \"He's stayin' at the Astor House,\" said Job, enjoying Sam's surprise.  \"Staying at the Astor House!\" exclaimed the young aristocrat in astonishment. \"Why, that is a tip-top hotel.\"  \"I always heerd it was,\" returned Job. \"How can he afford to stay there?\"  \"He didn't say.\"  \"Oh, I understand,\" said Sam, with an air of relief. \"He's got a place to black boots, or clean knives. That must be the way of it.\"  \"I don't think it is, for he has engaged passage to Californy.\"  \"Is that so? When does he sail?\"  \"On Saturday. We're goin' to send him his clothes. Do you want to send him any word or message?\"  \"No; why should I?\"  \"I thought you was one of his friends.\"  \"Yes, I will send him a message,\" said Sam. \"Just tell him that when he has spent all his money, I'll give him the place I offered him before he left Hampton.\"  \"You're very kind,\" said Job, concealing his amusement; \"but I don't think Ben will need to take up with your offer.\"  \"I think he will,\" said Sam.  \"I wonder whether Ben is really staying at the Astor House, and paying his expenses there,\" he said to himself. \"If he is, he's a fool. I've a great mind to ask father if I may go up to New York, and see. Maybe he's only humbugging his uncle.\"  So when Sam got home he preferred a request to visit New York, and obtained permission.  We now return to the Astor House.  Miss Sinclair and Ben went in to supper together. The young lady had scarcely taken her place, and looked around her, when she started, and turned pale.  \"Ben,\" she said hurriedly, \"I must leave the table. Do you see that tall man sitting by the window?\"  \"Yes, Cousin Ida.\"  \"It is my guardian. He has not seen me yet, but I must be cautious. Direct a servant to bring me some supper in my room, and come up there yourself when you are through.\"  \"All right!\"  Miss Sinclair left the room, but Ben maintained his place. He took particular notice of the gentleman who had been pointed out to him. He was a tall, slender man, with iron-gray hair, and a stern, unpleasant look. Ben judged that her guardian had not seen Miss Sinclair, for he seemed wholly intent upon his supper.  \"I don't wonder she wanted to run away from him,\" thought our hero. Ben smiled as it flashed upon him that this young lady was running away with him.  \"I didn't expect, when I left home, to meet with any such adventure as this,\" he said to himself. \"But I do mean to help Miss Sinclair all I possibly can. It doesn't seem quite natural to call her Ida, but I will do as she wants me to.\"  Meanwhile Mr. Campbell had made inquiries at the office if a young lady from Albany was staying at the hotel.  \"No,\" said the clerk.  It will be remembered that Miss Sinclair had registered from Philadelphia, or, rather, Ben had done so for her.  \"Have you any young lady here without escort?\" asked Mr. Campbell.  \"No, sir. There is a young lady from Philadelphia, but she arrived with her cousin, a lad of fifteen or sixteen.\"  \"That cannot be the one I am in search of,\" said the unsuspecting guardian.  Of course, as the reader will readily surmise, Ida Sinclair was not the young lady's real name, but it is the name by which we shall know her for the present.  After supper Ben went to Miss Sinclair's room, as directed.  \"I think, Ben,\" she said, \"it will be best for me to take all my meals in my room during the short time I stay here. Should my guardian catch sight of me"]]]
