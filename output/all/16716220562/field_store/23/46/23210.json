We do, and you must submit. Mr. Tucker, take him and put him in the wagon, and we’ll drive over to the poorhouse.”  “What! now?” asked Philip, in dismay.  “Just so,” answered Joe Tucker. “When you’ve got your bird, don’t let him go, that’s what I say.”  “That’s the talk, dad!” said Zeke gladfully. “We’ll take down his pride, I guess, when we’ve got him home.”  Joe Tucker approached Philip, and was about to lay hold of him, when our hero started back.  “You needn’t lay hold of me, Mr. Tucker,” he said. “I will get into the wagon if Squire Pope insists upon it.”  “I’m glad you’re gettin’ sensible,” said the squire, congratulating himself on finding Philip more tractable than he expected.  “And you will go to the poorhouse peaceful, and without making a fuss?” asked Joe.  “Yes, I will go there; but I won’t stay there.”  “You won’t stay there!” ejaculated the squire.  “No, sir! In treating me as a dependent on charity, you are doing what neither you nor any other man has a right to do,” said Philip firmly.  “You don’t appear to remember that I am a selectman and overseer of the poor,” said the Squire.  “I am aware that you hold those offices; but if so, you ought to save money to the town, and not compel them to pay for my support, when I am willing and able to support myself.”  Squire Pope looked a little puzzled. This was putting the matter in a new light, and he could not help admitting to himself that Philip was correct, and that perhaps his fellow citizens might take the same view.  On the other hand, the squire was fond of having his own way, and he had now gone so far that he could not recede without loss of dignity.  “I think,” he answered stiffly, “that I understand my duty as well as a boy of fifteen. I don’t mean to keep you here long, but it is the best arrangement for the present.”  “Of course it is,” said Zeke, well pleased with the humiliation of his enemy.  “Shut up, Zeke!” said his father, observing from the squire’s expression that he did not fancy Zeke’s interference.  “All right, dad,” said Zeke good-naturedly, seeing that things had turned out as he desired.  “Jump in!” said Mr. Tucker to Philip.  Our hero, without a word, obeyed. He was firmly resolved that Squire Pope should not have his way, but he did not choose to make himself ridiculous by an ineffectual resistance which would only have ended in his discomfiture.  Seated between Mr. Tucker and the squire, he was driven rapidly toward the poorhouse.     CHAPTER IX. THE POORHOUSE.   There was no room for Zeke to ride—that is, there was no seat for him—but he managed to clamber into the back part of the wagon, where he sat, or squatted, rather uncomfortably, but evidently in the best of spirits—if any inference could be drawn from his expression.  The poorhouse was not far away. It was a three-story frame house, which badly needed painting, with a dilapidated barn, and shed near by.  A three-story farmhouse is not common in the country, but this dwelling had been erected by a Mr. Parmenter, in the expectation of making a fortune by taking summer boarders.  There was room enough for them, but they did not come. The situation was the reverse of pleasant, the soil about was barren, and there were no shade or fruit trees. It was a crazy idea, selecting such a spot for a summer boarding-house, and failure naturally resulted.  There had, indeed, been two boarders—a man and his wife—who paid one week’s board, and managed to owe six before the unlucky landlord decided that they were a pair of swindlers. He had spent more money than he could afford on his house, and went steadily behind-hand year after year, till the town—which was in want of a poorhouse—stepped in and purchased the house and farm at a bargain. So it came to be a boarding-house, after all, but in a sense not contemplated by the proprietor, and, at present, accommodated eleven persons—mostly old and infirm—whom hard fortune compelled to subsist on charity.  Mr. Tucker had this advantage, that his boarders, had no recourse except to stay with him, however poor his fare or harsh his treatment, unless they were in a position to take care of themselves.  When Philip came in sight of the almshouse—which he had often seen, and always considered a very dreary-looking building—he was strengthened in his determination not long to remain a tenant.  Mr. Tucker drove up to the front door with a flourish.  A hard-featured woman came out, and regarded the contents of the wagon with curiosity.  “Well, Abigail, can you take another boarder!” asked Mr. Tucker, as he descended from the wagon.  “Who is it?”  “Well, it ain’t likely to be Squire Pope!” said Joe facetiously; “and Zeke and I are regular boarders on the free list.”  “Is it that boy?”  “Yes; it’s Phil Gray.”  “Humph! boys are a trial!” remarked Mrs. Tucker, whose experience with Zeke had doubtless convinced her of this fact.  “I sha’n’t trouble you long, Mrs. Tucker,” said Philip. “I don’t intend to stay.”  “You don’t, hey?” retorted Joe Tucker, with a wolfish grin and an emphatic nod of the head. “We’ll see about that—won’t we, Squire Pope?”  “The boy is rather rebellious, Mrs. Tucker,” said the selectman. “He appears to think he knows better what is good for him than we do. You may look upon him as a permanent boarder. What he says is of no account.”  Philip said nothing, but he looked full at the squire with an unflinching gaze. If ever determination was written upon any face, it was on his.  “Come down there!” said Mrs. Tucker, addressing our hero. “You’re at home now.”  “Mr. Dunbar won’t know what has become of me,” said Philip, with a sudden thought. “They will be anxious. May I go back there and tell them where I am?”  “Do you think I am green enough for that?” Mr. Tucker, touching the side of his nose waggishly. “We shouldn’t be likely to set eyes on you again.”  “I will promise to come back here this evening,” said Philip.  “And will you promise to stay?” asked Squire Pope doubtfully.  “No, sir,” answered Philip boldly. “I won’t do that, but I will engage to come back. Then Mr. Tucker will have to look out for me, for I tell you and him frankly I don’t mean to stay.”  “Did you ever hear such talk, squire!” asked Mr. Tucker, with a gasp of incredulity. “He actually defies you, who are a selectman and an overseer of the poor.”  “So he does, Mr. Tucker. I’m shocked at his conduct.”  “Shall we let him go?”  “No, of course not.”  “I agree with you, squire. I know’d you wouldn’t agree to it. What shall I do about his wantin’ to run away?”  “It will be best to confine him just at first, Mr. Tucker.”  “I’ll shut him up in one of the attic rooms,” said Mr. Tucker.  “I think it will be the best thing to do, Mr. Tucker.”  Philip took all this very coolly. As to the way in which they proposed to dispose of him for the present he cared very little, as he did not intend stay till morning if there was any possible chance of getting away. The only thing that troubled him was the doubt and anxiety of his good friends, the Dunbars, when he did not return to the house.  “Squire Pope,” he said, turning to that official, “will you do me a favor?”  “Ahem! Explain yourself,” said the squire suspiciously.  “Will you call at Mr. Dunbar’s and tell them where I am.”  Now, for obvious reasons, the squire did not like to do this. He knew that the Dunbars would manifest great indignation at the arbitrary step which he had adopted, and he did not like to face their displeasure, especially as his apology would perforce be a lame one.  “I don’t think I am called upon to do you a favor, seeing how you’ve acted, Philip,” he said hesitatingly. “Besides, it would be out of my way, and I ought to get home as soon as possible.”  “Then you refuse, sir?”  “Well, I’d rather not.”  “Will you get word to them, Mr. Tucker?” asked Philip, turning to him.  “I hain’t got time,” answered Mr. Tucker, who feared that the Dunbars would come for Philip and release him in the course of the evening.  Philip was nonplused. Always considerate of the feelings of others, he was unwilling that his friends should suffer anxiety on his account.  As Mr. Tucker and Squire Pope walked away together, our hero turned to Zeke.  “I suppose it’s no use to ask you to do me a favor, Zeke?” he said.  “Do you want me to tell Frank Dunbar where you are?”  “Yes, I wish you would.”  “Then I’ll do it.”  “You’re a better fellow than I thought you were, Zeke,” said Philip, surprised.  “No, I ain’t! Do you want to know why I’m willin’ to go?”  “Why?”  “I know Frank Dunbar’ll feel bad, and I hate him.”  “So that is your object, is it, Zeke?”  “You’ve got it.”  “Well, whatever your motive may be, I shall be much obliged to you if you go. Here’s ten cents for you!”  Zeke grasped at the coin with avidity, for his father was very parsimonious, and his mother no less so, and he seldom got any ready money.  “Thank you!” said Zeke, with unusual politeness. “I’ll go right off. But, I say, don’t you tell dad where I’ve gone, or he might prevent me, and don’t you let on you’ve given me this dime, or he’d try to get it away.”  “No, I won’t say anything about it,” answered Philip.  “A curious family this is!” he thought, “There doesn’t seem to be much confidence in each other.”  Zeke sauntered away carelessly, to avert suspicion but when he had got round a bend of the road he increased his speed, never looking back,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5673"],["title","The Young Musician; Or, Fighting His Way (#7)"],["body"," lest he should see his father signaling for him.  Philip breathed a sigh of relief.  “I’ve got a messenger at last,” he said. “Now my friends will know what has become of me when I don’t come home to supper.”  He was a little curious to learn what they were going to do with him, but he was not long kept in suspense.     CHAPTER X. BAD TIDINGS.   Leaving Philip for a short time in the hands of his captor, we will follow Zeke on his errand. He didn’t have to go as far as Mr. Dunbar’s house, for he met Frank Dunbar about a quarter of a mile this side of it.  Now, between Frank Dunbar and Zeke Tucker there was no love lost. There had been a difficulty between them, originating at school, which need not be particularly referred to. Enough that it led to Zeke’s cordially disliking Frank, while the latter, who was a frank, straightforward boy, could not see anything in Mr. Tucker’s promising son to enlist either his respect or his liking.  There was a small river running through Norton, which crossed the main thoroughfare, and had to be bridged over. Frank Dunbar, fishing-line in hand, was leaning over the parapet, engaged in luring the fish from their river home. He looked up, when he saw Zeke approaching him. Not having any particular desire to hold a conversation with him, he withdrew his eyes, and again watched his line. Zeke, however, approached him with a grin of anticipated enjoyment, and hailed him in the usual style:  “Hello, Frank!”  “Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Frank Dunbar indifferently.  “Yes it’s me. I suppose you thought it was somebody else,” chuckled Zeke, though Frank could see no cause for merriment.  “Well, I see who it is now,” he responded.  “Where is Phil Gray?” inquired Zeke, chuckling again.  “Do you want to see him?” asked Frank, rather surprised.  “Oh, no! I shall see him soon enough.”  And again Zeke chuckled.  Frank looked up.  He was expecting Philip to join him, and was, in fact, waiting for him now. Zeke’s mysterious merriment suggested that he might have met Philip—possibly bore some message from him.  “Do you know anything about Phil?” asked Frank, looking fixedly at his visitor.  “I reckon I do. I know all about him,” said Zeke, with evident enjoyment.  “Well. If you have any message from him, let me hear it.”  “You can’t guess where he is,” blurted out Zeke.  “He isn’t in any trouble, is he?” asked Frank quickly.  “No; he’s safe enough. But you needn’t expect to see him tonight.”  “Why not?” demanded Frank, not yet guessing what was likely to detain his friend.  “Because he’s at our house,” chuckled Zeke. “Dad and Squire Pope have carried him to the poorhouse, and he’s goin’ to stay there for good.”  This was a surprise. In his astonishment, Frank nearly let go his rod. He was eager now to question Zeke further.  “You don’t mean to say Phil has been carried to the poorhouse against his will?” he exclaimed.  “I reckon he was anxious to go,” said Zeke.  “Where was he when your father and Squire Pope committed this outrage?” said Frank indignantly.  “I thought you’d be mad,” said Zeke, with the same unpleasant chuckle.  “Answer my question, or I’ll pitch you into the river,” said Frank sternly.  He did not mean what he said, but Zeke drew back in alarm.  “Quit now! I didn’t have nothin’ to do with it,” said Zeke hastily. “Me and him was over in Haywood’s pasture when dad come along with the squire in his wagon. Well, they made Phil get in, and that’s all of it, except I promised I’d come and tell your folks, so you needn’t get scared or nothin’ when he didn’t come back to-night.”  “He will come back to-night,” said Frank. “He won’t stay in the poorhouse.”  “Yes, he will. He can’t help himself. Dad’s goin’ to lock him up in the attic. I guess he won’t jump out of the window. Where you goin’! You ain’t got through fishin’, be you?”  “Yes, I’m through,” answered Frank, as he drew his line out of the water. “Just tell Phil when you go home that he’s got friends outside who won’t see him suffer.”  “Say, ain’t you goin’ to give me nothin’ for comin’ to tell you!” asked Zeke, who was always intent on the main chance.  Frank flung a nickel in his direction, which Zeke picked up with avidity.  “I guess it pays to run errands when you can get paid twice,” he reflected complacently.     CHAPTER XI. PHILIP’S NEW ROOM.   We return to Phil.  “Foller me, boy!” said Mr. Tucker, as he entered the house, and proceeded to ascend the front steps.  Philip had formed his plans, and without a word of remonstrance, he obeyed. The whole interior was dingy and dirty. Mrs. Tucker was not a neat woman, and everything looked neglected and slipshod.  In the common room, to the right, the door of which was partly open, Philip saw some old men and women sitting motionless, in a sort of weary patience. They were “paupers,” and dependent for comfort on the worthy couple, who regarded them merely as human machines, good to them for sixty cents a week each.  Mr. Tucker did not stop at the first landing, but turned and began to ascend a narrower and steeper staircase leading to the next story.  This was, if anything, dirtier and more squalid than the first and second. There were several small rooms on the third floor, into one of which Mr. Tucker pushed his way. “Come in,” he said. “Now you’re at home. This is goin’ to be your room.”  Philip looked around him in disgust, which he did not even take the trouble to conceal.  There was a cot-bed in the corner, with an unsavory heap of bed-clothing upon it, and a couple of chairs, both with wooden seats, and one with the back gone.  That was about all the furniture. There was one window looking out upon the front.  “So this is to be my room, is it?” asked our hero.  “Yes. How do you like it?”  “I don’t see any wash-stand, or any chance to wash.”  “Come, that’s rich!” said Mr. Tucker, appearing to be very much amused. “You didn’t think you was stoppin’ in the Fifth Avenoo Hotel, did you?”  “This don’t look like it.”  “We ain’t used to fashionable boarders, and we don’t know how to take care of ’em. You’ll have to go downstairs and wash in the trough, like the rest of the paupers do.”  “And wipe my face on the grass, I suppose?” said Philip coolly, though his heart sank within him at the thought of staying even one night in a place so squalid and filthy.  “Come, that’s goin’ too far,” said Mr. Tucker, who felt that the reputation of the boarding-house was endangered by such insinuations. “We mean to live respectable. There’s two towels a week allowed, and that I consider liberal.”  “And do all your boarders use the same towel?” asked Phil, unable to suppress an expression of disgust.  “Sartain. You don’t think we allow ’em one apiece, do you!”  “No, I don’t,” said Philip decidedly.  He had ceased to expect anything so civilized in Mr. Tucker’s establishment.  “Now you’re safe in your room, I reckon I’d better go downstairs,” said Tucker.  “I will go with you.”  “Not much you won’t! We ain’t a-goin’ to give you a chance of runnin’ away just yet!”  “Do you mean to keep me a prisoner?” demanded Philip.  “That’s just what we do, at present,” answered his genial host.  “It won’t be for long, Mr. Tucker.”  “What’s that you say? I’m master here, I’d have you to know!”  Just then a shrill voice was heard from below:  “Come down, Joe Tucker! Are you goin’ to stay upstairs all day?”  “Comin’, Abigail!” answered Mr. Tucker hastily, as he backed out of the room, locking the door behind him. Philip heard the click of the key as it turned in the lock, and he realized, for the first time in his life, that he was a prisoner.     CHAPTER XII. A PAUPER’S MEAL   Half an hour later Philip heard a pounding on the door of his room.  He was unable to open it, but he called out, loud enough for the outsider to hear:  “Who is it?”  “It’s me—Zeke,” was the answer that came back.  “Did you tell the Dunbars where I was?” asked Philip eagerly.  “Yes.”  “I shouldn’t think you had time to go there and back,” said Philip, fearing that Zeke had pocketed his money and then played him false. But, as we know, he was mistaken in this.  “I didn’t go there,” shouted Zeke. “I met Frank on the bridge.”  “What did he say?”  “He was mad,” answered Zeke, laughing. “I thought he would be.”  “Did he send any message to me?” asked Philip.  “No; he stopped fishin’ and went home.” Here the conversation was interrupted. The loud tones in which Zeke had been speaking, in order to be heard through the door, had attracted attention below.  His father came to the foot of the attic stairs and demanded suspiciously:  “What you doin’ there, Zeke?”  “Tryin’ to cheer up Phil Gray,” answered Zeke jocosely.  “He don’t need any cheerin’ up. He’s all right. I reckon you’re up to some mischief.”  “No, I ain’t.”  “Come along down.”  “All right, dad, if you say so. Lucky he didn’t hear what I was sayin’ about seein’ Frank Dunbar,” thought Zeke. “He’d be mad.”  Presently there was another caller at Philip’s room, or, rather, prison. This time it was Mr. Tucker himself. He turned the key in the lock and opened the door. Philip looked up inquiringly.  “Supper’s ready,” announced Joe. “You can come down if you want to.”  Philip was provided with an appetite, but he did not relish the idea of going downstairs and joining the rest of Mr. Tucker’s boarders. It would seem like a tacit admission that he was one of their number. Of course, he couldn’t do without eating, but he had a large apple in his pocket when captured, and he thought that this would prevent his suffering from hunger for that night, at least, and he did not mean to spend another at the Norton poorhouse. The problem of to-morrow’s supply of food might be deferred till then.  “I don’t care for any supper,” answered Philip.  “Perhaps you expect your meals will be brought up to you?” said Mr. Tucker, with a sneer.  “I haven’t thought about it particularly,” said Philip coolly.  “You may think you’re spitin’ me by not eatin’ anything,” observed Mr. Tucker, who was rather alarmed lest"]]]
