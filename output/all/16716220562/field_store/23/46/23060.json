On the way she met a gentleman in a suit of light armour, whom she recognised in the distance as the Knight of Neckerfels, who had been paying court to her before her fall.  He was walking alone and looked her directly in the face, but he did not have the slightest idea that he had met madcap Kuni.  It was only too evident that he supposed her to be a total stranger.  Yet it would have been impossible for any one to recognise her.  Mirrors were not allowed in the convent, but a bright new tin plate had showed her her emaciated face with the broad scar on the forehead, the sunken eyes, and the whole narrow head, where the hair, which grew out again very slowly, was just an ugly length.  Now the sight of the bony hand which grasped the cane brought a half-sorrowful, half-scornful, smile to her lips.  Her arm had been plump and round, but was now little larger than a stick.  Pretty Kuni, the ropedancer, no longer existed; she must become accustomed to have the world regard her as a different and far less important personage, whom Lienhard, too--and this was fortunate --would not have deemed worthy of a glance.  And yet, if the inner self is the true one, there was little change in her.  Her soul was moved by the same feelings, only there was now a touch of bitterness.  One great advantage of her temperament, it is true, had vanished with her physical beauty and strength--the capacity to hope for happiness and joy.  Perhaps it would never return; an oppressive feeling of guilt, usually foreign to her careless nature, had oppressed her ever since she had heard recently in the convent that the child on whom she had called down death and destruction was lying hopelessly ill, and would scarcely live till the joyous Whitsuntide.  This now came back to her mind.  The jubilant sense of freedom deserted her; she walked thoughtfully on until she reached the neighbourhood of Jacob Fugger's house.  A long funeral procession was moving slowly toward her.  Some very exalted and aristocratic person must be taking the journey to the grave, for it was headed by all the clergy in the city.  Choristers, in the most elaborate dress, swinging incense holders by delicate metal chains and bearing lanterns on long poles, surrounded the lofty cross.  Every one of distinction in Augsburg, all the children who attended school, and all the members of the various ecclesiastical orders and guilds in the city marched before the bier.  Kuni had never seen such a funeral procession.  Perhaps the one she witnessed in Milan, when a great nobleman was buried, was longer, but in this every individual seemed to feel genuine grief.  Even the schoolboys who, on such solemn occasions, usually play all sorts of secret pranks, walked as mournfully as if each had lost some relative who was specially dear to him.  Among the girls there were few whose rosy cheeks were not constantly wet with tears.  From the first Kuni had believed that she knew who was being borne to the grave.  Now she heard several women whispering near her mention the name of Juliane Peutinger.  A pale-faced gold embroiderer, who had recently bordered a gala dress with leaves and tendrils for the dead girl's sister, described, sobbing, the severe suffering amid which this fairest blossom of Augsburg girlhood had withered ere death finally broke the slender stem.  Suddenly she stopped; a cry of mingled astonishment, lamentation, and delight, sometimes rising, sometimes falling, ran through the crowd which had gathered along the sides of the street.  The bier was in sight.  Twelve youths bore the framework, covered with a richly embroidered blue cloth, on which the coffin rested.  It was open, and the dead girl's couch was so high that it seemed as though the sleeper was only resting lightly on the white silk pillow.  A wreath again encircled her head, but this time blossoming myrtles blended with the laurel in the brown curls that lay in thick, soft locks on the snowy pillows and the lace- trimmed shroud.  Juliane's eyes were closed.  Ah! how gladly Kuni would have kissed those long-lashed lids to win even one look of forgiveness from her whom her curse had perhaps snatched from the green spring world!  She remembered the sunny radiance with which this sleeper's eyes had sparkled as they met Lienhard's.  They were the pure mirror of the keen, mobile intellect and the innocent, loving soul of this rare child.  Now death had closed them, and Juliane's end had been one of suffering.  The pale embroiderer had said so, and the sorrowful droop of the sweet little mouth, which gave the wondrously beautiful, delicate, touching little face so pathetic an expression, betrayed it.  If the living girl had measured her own young intellect with that of grown people, and her face had worn the impress of precocious maturity, now it was that of a charming child who had died in suffering.  Kuni also felt this, and asked herself how it had been possible for her heart to cherish such fierce hatred against this little one, who had numbered only eleven years.  But had this Juliane resembled other children?  No, no!  No Emperor's daughter of her age would have been accompanied to the churchyard with such pageantry, such deep, universal grief.  She had been the jewel of a great city.  This was proclaimed by many a Greek and Latin maxim on tablets borne by the friends of the great humanist who, with joyful pride, called her his daughter.  Kuni could not read, but she heard at least one sentence translated by a Benedictine monk to the nun at his side:  \"He whose death compels those who knew him to weep, has the fairest end.\"--[Seneca, Hippol., 881.]  If this were true, Juliane's end was indeed fair; for she herself, whom the child had met only to inflict pain, had her eyes dimmed by tears, and wherever she turned she saw people weeping.  Most of those who lined the street could have had no close relations with the dead girl.  But yonder black-robed mourners who followed the bier were her parents, her brothers and sisters, her nearest relatives, the members of the Council, and the family servants.  And she, the wretched, reckless, sinful, crippled strolling player, for whom not a soul on earth cared, whose death would not have drawn even a single tear from any eye, to whom a speedy end could be only a benefit, was perhaps the cause of the premature drying up of this pure fountain of joy, which had refreshed so many hearts and animated them with the fairest hopes.  The tall lady, whose noble face and majestic figure were shrouded in a thick veil, was Juliane's mother--and she had offered the sick ropedancer a home in her wealthy household.  \"If she had only known,\" thought Kuni, \"the injury I was inflicting upon her heart's treasure, she would rather have hunted me with dogs from her threshold.\"  In spite of the veil which floated around the stately figure of the grieving mother, she could see her bosom rise and fall with her sobs of anguish.  Kuni's compassionate heart made it impossible for her to watch this sorrow longer, and, covering her face with her hands, she turned her back upon the procession and, weeping aloud, limped away as fast as her injured foot would let her.  Meanwhile she sometimes said to herself that she was the worst of all sinners because she had cursed the dead girl and called down death and destruction upon her head, sometimes she listened to the voice within, which told her that she had no reason to grieve over Juliane's death, and completely embitter her already wretched life by remorse and self-accusations; the dead girl was the sole cause of her terrible fall.  But the defiant rebellion against the consciousness of guilt, which moved her so deeply, always ceased abruptly as soon as it raised its head; for one fact was positive, if the curse she had called down upon the innocent child, who had done her no intentional wrong, had really caused Juliane's end, a whole life was not long enough to atone for the sin which she had committed.  Yet what atonement was still in her power, after the death which she had summoned had performed its terrible work of executioner?  \"Nothing, nothing at all!\" she said to herself angrily, resolving, as she had so often done with better success, to forget what had happened, cast the past into oblivion, and live in the present as before.  But ere she could attempt to fulfil this determination, the image of the tall, grief- bowed figure of the woman who had called Juliane her dear child rose before her mind, and it seemed as if a cold, heavy hand paralyzed the wings of the light-hearted temperament which had formerly borne her pleasantly over so many things.  Then she told herself that, in order not to go to perdition herself, she must vow, sacrifice, undertake everything for the salvation of the dead girl and of her own heavily burdened soul. For the first time she felt a longing to confide her feelings to some one.  If Lienhard had been within reach and disposed to listen to her, he would have understood, and known what course to advise.  True, the thought that he was not looking at her when she took the fatal leap still haunted her.  He could not have showed more offensively how little he cared for her--but perhaps he was under the influence of a spell; for she must be something to him.  This was no vain self- deception; had it not been so, would he have come in person to her couch of pain, or cared for her so kindly after the accident?  In the convent she had reached the conviction that it would be degrading to think longer of the man who, in return for the most ardent love, offered nothing but alms in jingling coin; yet her poor heart would not cease its yearning.  Meanwhile she never wearied of seeking motives that would place his conduct in a more favourable light.  Whatever he might have withheld from her, he was nevertheless the best and noblest of men, and as she limped aimlessly on,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5585"],["title","In the Blue Pike â€” Volume 02 (#8)"],["body"," conviction strengthened that the mere sight of him would dispel the mists which, on this sunny spring day, seemed to veil everything around and within her.  But he remained absent, and suddenly it seemed more disgraceful to seek him than to stand in the stocks.  Yet the pilgrimage to Compostella, of which the confessor had spoken? For the very reason that it had been described to her as unattainable, it would perhaps be rated at a high value in heaven, and restore to her while on earth the peace she had lost.  She pondered over this thought on her way to the tavern, where she found a corner to sleep, and a carrier who, on the day after the morrow, would take her to the sea for a heller pound.  Other pilgrims had also engaged passage at Antwerp for Corunna, the harbour of Compostella, and her means were sufficient for the voyage.  This assurance somewhat soothed her while she remained among people of her own calling.  But she spent a sleepless night; for again and again the dead child's image appeared vividly before her.  Rising from the soft pillows in the coffin, she shook her finger threateningly at her, or, weeping and wailing, pointed down to the flames--doubtless those of purgatory--which were blazing upward around her, and had already caught the hem of her shroud.  Kuni arose soon after sunrise with a bewildered brain.  Before setting out on her pilgrimage she wished to attend mass, and--that the Holy Virgin might be aware of her good intentions--repeat in church some of the paternosters which her confessor had imposed.  She went out with the simple rosary that the abbess had given her upon her wrist, but when she had left the tavern behind she saw a great crowd in front of the new St. Ulrich's Church, and recognised among the throngs of people who had flocked thither her companion in suffering at the convent, the keeper of the bath-house, who had been cured of her burns long before.  She had left her business to buy an indulgence for her own sins, and to purchase for the soul of her husband--whose death-bed confession, it is true, had been a long one--for the last time, but for many centuries at once, redemption from the fires of purgatory.  The Dominican friar Tetzel, from Nuremberg, was here with his coffer, and carried written promises which secured certain remission of punishment for all sins, even those committed long ago, or to be committed in the future.  The woman had experienced the power of his papers herself.  Tetzel had come to Augsburg about a year after her husband's death, and, as she knew how many sins he had committed, she put her hand into her purse to free him from the flames.  They must have burned very fiercely; for, while awake at night and in her dreams, she had often heard him wailing and complaining piteously.  But after she bought the paper he became quiet and, on the third night, she saw him with her own eyes enter the room, and heard him promise her a great happiness in return for her faithful remembrance.  The very next Sunday, Veit Haselnuss, the bath-house proprietor, a well- to-do man who owned another house besides the one where he lived, invited her to take a walk with him.  She knew instantly that her late husband was beginning to pay his debt of gratitude with this visitor and, in fact, a short time after, the worthy man asked her to be his wife, though she had three little children, and his oldest daughter by his first wife was already able to look after the housekeeping.  The wedding took place on Whitsunday, and she owed this great happiness entirely to the dispensation which had released the dead man's soul from the fires of purgatory and induced him to show his thankfulness.  Kuni listened to her companion's rapid flood of talk, until she herself enjoined silence to hear the black-robed priest who stood beside the coffer.  He was just urging his hearers, in a loud voice, to abandon the base avarice which gathers pence.  There was still time to gain, in exchange for dead florins, living salvation.  Let those who repented sin listen, and they would hear the voices of wailing parents, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, and children, who had preceded them to the other world.  Whose heart was so utterly turned to stone, whose parsimony, spite of all his love of money, was so strong that he would allow these tortured souls to burn and suffer in the flames, when it was in his power, by putting his hand into his purse, to buy a dispensation which would as surely redeem them from the fires of purgatory as his Imperial Majesty's pardon would release an imprisoned thief from jail?  Scales seemed to fall from Kuni's eyes.  She hastily forced her way to the Dominican, who was just wiping the perspiration from his brow with the hem of the white robe under his black cowl.  Coughing and panting, he was preparing his voice for a fresh appeal, meanwhile opening the iron-bound box, and pointing out to the throng the placard beside his head, which announced that the money obtained by the indulgences was intended for the Turkish war.  Then, in fluent language, he explained to the bystanders that this meant that the Holy Father in Rome intended to drive the hereditary foe of Christianity back to the steppes and deserts of the land of Asia, where he belonged.  In order to accomplish this work, so pleasing to the Lord, the Church was ready to make lavish use of the treasures of mercy intrusted to her.  Deliverance from the flames of purgatory would never be more cheaply purchased than at this opportunity.  Then he thrust his little fat hand, on which several valuable rings glittered, into the box, and held out to the bystanders a small bundle of papers like an open pack of cards.  Kuni summoned up her courage and asked whether they would also possess the power to remove a curse.  Tetzel eagerly assented, adding that he had papers which would wash the soul as white from every sin as soap would cleanse a sooty hand, even though, instead of \"curse,\" its name was \"parricide.\"  The most costly had the power to transfer scoundrels roasting in the hottest flames of purgatory to the joys of paradise, as yonder sparrow had just soared from the dust of the street to the elm bough.  Kuni timidly asked the price of an indulgence, but the Dominican unctuously explained that they were not sold like penny rolls at the baker's; the heavier the sin, the higher the fine to be paid.  First of all, she must confess sincere contrition for what had been done and inform him how, in spite of her youth, she had been led into such heinous guilt.  Kuni replied that she had long mourned her error most deeply, and then began to whisper to Tetzel how she had been induced to curse a fellow-mortal.  She desired nothing for herself.  Her sole wish was to release the dead girl from the flames of purgatory, and the curse which, by her guilt, burdened her soul.  But the Dominican had only half listened, and as many who wanted indulgences were crowding around his box, he interrupted Kuni by offering her a paper which he would make out in the name of the accursed Juliane Peutinger--if he had heard correctly.  Such cases seemed to be very familiar to him, but the price he asked was so large that the girl grew pale with terror.  Yet she must have the redeeming paper, and Tetzel lowered his price after her declaration that she possessed only five heller pounds and the convent viaticum.  Besides, she stated that she had already bargained with the carrier for the journey to the sea.  This, however, had no influence upon the Dominican, as the indulgence made the pilgrimage to Compostella unnecessary.  Since it would redeem the accursed person from the fires of purgatory, she, too, was absolved from the vow which drew her thither.  With stern decision he therefore insisted upon demanding the entire sum in her possession.  He could only do it so cheaply because her face and her lost foot showed that she was destined to suffer part of the eternal torture here on earth.  Then Kuni yielded.  The paper was made out in the name of Juliane, she gave up her little store, and returned to the inn a penniless beggar, but with a lighter heart, carrying the precious paper under the handkerchief crossed over her bosom.  But there the carrier refused her a seat without the money which she had promised him, and the landlord demanded payment for her night's lodging and the bit of food she had eaten.  Should she go back to the convent and ask for the little sum which Lienhard had left there for her?  The struggle was a hard one, but pride finally conquered.  She renounced the kindly meant gift of her only friend.  When the abbess returned the money to him, he could not help perceiving that she was no beggar and scorned to be his debtor.  If he then asked himself why, he would find the right answer.  She did not confess it to herself in plain words, but she wished to remain conscious that, whether he desired it or not, she had given her heart's best love to this one man without reward, merely because it was her pleasure to do it.  At last she remembered that she still possessed something valuable.  She had not thought of it before, because it had been as much a part of herself as her eyes or her lips, and it would have seemed utterly impossible to part with it.  This article was a tolerably heavy gold ring, with a sparkling ruby in the centre.  She had drawn it from her father's finger after he had taken his last leap and she was called to his corpse.  She did not even know whether he had received the circlet as a wedding ring from the mother of whom she had no remembrance, or where he obtained it.  But she had heard that it was of considerable value, and when she set off to sell the jewel, she did not find it very hard to gave it up.  It seemed as if her father, from the grave, was providing his poor child with the means she needed to continue to support her life.  She had heard in the convent of Graslin, the goldsmith, who had bestowed on the"]]]
