It was simply a sheet on which the letters of the alphabet, and some few words of one syllable, were printed, and it was protected in its frame by a transparent front of thin horn, through which the letters could be read, just as one sees the prints through the ground-glass of “drawing slates.”  From this horn-book Abel labored patiently in teaching George his letters.  It was no light task.  George had all the cunning and shrewdness with which he credited himself; but a denser head for any intellectual effort could hardly have been found for the seeking.  Still they struggled on, and as George went about the mill he might have been heard muttering,—  “A B C G.  No!  Cuss me for a vool!  A B C _D_.  Why didn’t they whop my letters into I when a was a boy?  A B C”—and so persevering with an industry which he commonly kept for works of mischief.  One evening he brought home a newspaper from the Heart of Oak, and when Mrs. Lake had taken the baby, he persuaded Abel to come into the round-house and give him a lesson.  Abel could read so much of it that George was quite overwhelmed by his learning.  “Thee be’s mortal larned, Abel, sartinly.  But I’ll never read like thee,” he added, despairingly.  “Drattle th’ old witch; why didn’t she give I some schooling?”  He spoke with spiteful emphasis, and Abel, too well used to his rough language to notice the uncivil reference to his mother, said with some compassion,—  “Were you never sent to school then, Gearge?”  “They should ha’ kept me there,” said George, self-defensively.  “I played moocher,” he continued,—by which he meant truant,—“and then they whopped I, and a went home to mother, and she kept un at home, the old vool!”  “Well, Gearge, thee must work hard, and I’ll teach thee, Gearge, I’ll teach thee!” said little Abel, proudly.  “And by-and-by, Gearge, we’ll get a slate, and I’ll teach thee to write too, Gearge, that I will!”  George’s small eyes gave a slight squint, as they were apt to do when he was thinking profoundly.  “Abel,” said he, “can thee read writing, my boy?”  “I think I could, Gearge,” said Abel, “if ’twas pretty plain.”  “Abel, my boy,” said George, after a pause, with a broad sweet smile upon his “voolish” face, “go to the door and see if the wind be rising at all; us mustn’t forget th’ old mill, Abel, with us larning.  Sartinly not, Abel, mun.”  Proud of the implied partnership in the care of the mill, Abel hastened to the outer door.  As he passed the inner one, leading into the dwelling-room, he could hear his mother crooning a strange, drony, old local ditty, as she put the little Jan to sleep.  As Abel went out, she was singing the first verse:—      “The swallow twitters on the barn,     The rook is cawing on the tree,     And in the wood the ringdove coos,     But my false love hath fled from me.”  Abel opened the door, and looked out.  One of those small white moths known as “millers” went past him.  The night was still,—so utterly still that no sound of any sort whatever broke upon the ear.  In dead silence and loneliness stood the mill.  Even the miller-moth had gone; and a cat ran in by Abel’s legs, as if the loneliness without were too much for her.  The sky was gray.  Abel went back to the round-house, where George was struggling to fix the candlestick securely in the wall.  “Cuss the thing!” he exclaimed, whilst the skin of his face took a mottled hue that was the nearest approach he ever made to a blush.  “The tallow’ve been a dropping, Abel, my boy.  I think ’twas the wind when you opened the door, maybe.  And I’ve been a trying to fix un more firmly. That’s all, Abel; that’s all.”  “There ain’t no signs of wind,” said Abel.  “It’s main quiet and unked too outside, Gearge.  And I do think it be like rain.  There was a miller-moth, Gearge; do that mean any thing?”  “I can’t say,” said George.  “I bean’t weatherwise myself, Abel.  But if there be no wind, there be no work, Abel; so us may go back to our larning.  Look here, my boy,” he added, as Abel reseated himself on the grain-sack which did duty as chair of instruction, and drawing, as he spoke, a letter forth to the light; “come to the candle, Abel, and see if so be thee can read this, but don’t tell any one I showed it thee, Abel.”  “Not me, Gearge,” said Abel, warmly; and he added,—“Be it from thy young ’ooman, Gearge?”  No rustic swain ever simpered more consciously or looked more foolish than George under this accusation, as he said, “Be quiet, Abel, do ’ee.”  “She be a good scholar, too!” said Abel, looking admiringly at the closely written sheet.  George could hardly disguise the sudden look of fury in his face, but he hastily covered up the letter with his hands in such a manner as only to leave the first word on the page visible.  There was a deeply cunning reason for this clever manœuvre.  George held himself to be pretty “cute,” and he reckoned that, by only showing one word at a time, he could effectually prevent any attempt on Abel’s part to read the letter himself without giving its contents to George.  Like many other cunning people, George overreached himself.  The first word was beyond Abel’s powers, though he might possibly have satisfied George’s curiosity on one essential point, by deciphering a name or two farther on.  But the clever George concluded that he had boasted beyond his ability, so he put the letter away.  Abel tried hard at the one word which George exhibited, and gazed silently at it for some time with a puzzled face.  “Spell it, mun, spell it!” cried the miller’s man, impatiently.  It was a process which he had seen to succeed, when a long word had puzzled his teacher in the newspaper, before now.  “M O E R, mower; D Y K, dik,” said Abel.  But he looked none the wiser for the effort.  “Mower dik!  What be that?” said George, peering at the word.  “Do’ee think it be Mower dik, Abel?”  “I be sure,” said Abel.  “Or do ’ee think ’tis ‘_My dear Dick_’?” suggested George, anxiously, and with a sort of triumph in his tone, as if that were quite what he expected.  “No, no.  ’Tis an O, Gearge, that second letter.  Besides, twould be _My dear Gearge_ to thee, thou knows.”  Again the look with which the miller’s man favored Abel was far from pleasant.  But he controlled his voice to its ordinary drawl (always a little slower and more simple sounding, when he specially meant mischief).  “So ’twould, Abel.  So ’twould.  What a vool I be, to be sure!  But give it to I now.  We’ll look at it another time, Abel.”  “I be very sorry, Gearge,” said Abel, who had a consciousness that the miller’s man was ill-pleased in spite of his civility.  “It be so long since I was at school, and it be such a queer word.  Do ’ee think she can have spelt un wrong, Gearge?”  “’Tis likely she have,” said George, regaining his composure.  “Abel!  Abel!  Abel!” cried the mother from the dwelling-room.  “Come to bed, child!”  “Good-night, Gearge.  I’m main sorry to be so stupid, Gearge,” said Abel, and off he ran.  Mrs. Lake was walking up and down, rocking the little Jan in her arms, who was wailing fretfully.  “I be puzzled to know what ails un,” said Mrs. Lake, in answer to Abel’s questions.  “He be quite in a way to-night.  But get thee to bed, Abel.”  And though Abel begged hard to be allowed to try his powers of soothing with the little Jan, Mrs. Lake insisted upon keeping the baby herself; and Abel undressed, and crept into the press-bed.  He fell asleep in spite of a somewhat disturbed mind.  That mysterious word and George’s evident displeasure worried him, and he was troubled also by the unusual fretfulness of the little Jan, and the sound of sorrow in his baby wail. His last waking thoughts were a strange mixture, passing into stranger dreams.  The word Moerdyk danced before his eyes, but brought no meaning with it. Jan’s cries troubled him, and with both there blended the droning of the ancient plaintive ditty, which the foster-mother sang over and over again as she rocked the child in her arms.  That wail of the baby’s must have in some strange manner recalled the first night of his arrival, when Abel found him wailing on the bed.  For the fierce eyes of the strange gentleman haunted Abel’s dreams, but in the face of the miller’s man.  The poor boy dreamed horribly of being “dropped on” by George, with fierce black eyes added to the terrors of his uncouth grimaces.  He seemed to himself to fly blindly and vainly through the mill from his tormentor, till George was driven from his thoughts by his coming suddenly upon the little Jan, wailing as he really did wail, round whose head a miller-moth was sailing slowly, and singing in a human voice:—      “The swallow twitters on the barn,     The rook is cawing on the tree,     And in the wood the ringdove coos,     But my false love hath fled from me.      Like tiny pipe of wheaten straw,     The wren his little note doth swell,     And every living thing that flies,     Of his true love doth fondly tell.      But I alone am left to pine,     And sit beneath the withy tree;     For truth and honesty be gone,     And my false love hath fled from me.”     CHAPTER VII.   ABEL GOES TO SCHOOL AGAIN.—DAME DATCHETT.—A COLUMN OF SPELLING.—ABEL PLAYS MOOCHER.—THE MILLER’S MAN CANNOT MAKE UP HIS MIND.  ABEL went to school again in the spring, and, though George would have been better pleased had he forgotten the whole affair, he remembered the word in George’s young woman’s love-letter which had puzzled him; and never was a spelling-lesson set him among the M’s that he did not hope to come across it and to be able to demand the meaning of Moerdyk from his Dame.  Without the excuse of its coming in the column of spelling set by herself, Abel dared not ask her to solve his puzzle; for never did teacher more warmly resent questions which she was unable to answer than Dame Datchett.  Abel could not fully make up his mind whether it should be looked up among two-syllabled or three-syllab"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5601"],["title","Jan of the Windmill: A Story of the Plains (#8)"],["body","words.  He decided for the former, and one day brought his spelling-book to George in the round-house.  “I’ve been a looking for that yere word, Gearge,” said he.  “There’s lots of Mo’s, but it bean’t among ’em.  Here they be.  Words of two syllables; M, Ma, Me, Mi; here they be, Mo.”  And Abel began to rattle off the familiar column at a good rate, George looking earnestly over his shoulder, and following the boy’s finger as it moved rapidly down the page.  “Mocking, Modern, Mohawk, Molar, Molly, Moment, Money, Moping, Moral, Mortal, Moses, Motive, Movement.”  “Stop a bit, mun,” cried George; “what do all they words mean?  They bothers me.”  “I knows some of ’em,” said Abel, “and I asked Dame Datchett about the others, but she do be so cross; and I thinks some of ’em bothered she too.  There’s mocking.  I knows that.  ‘What’s a modern, Dame?’ says I. ‘A muddle-headed fellow the likes of you,’ says she.  ‘What’s a mohawk, Dame?’ says I.  ‘It’s what you’ll come to before long, ye young hang-gallus,’ says she.  I was feared on her, Gearge, I can tell ’ee; but I tried my luck again.  ‘What’s a molar, Dame?’ says I.  ‘’Tis a wus word than t’other,’ says she; ‘and, if ’ee axes me any more voolish questions, I’ll break thee yead for ’ee.’  Do ’ee think ’tis a very bad word, Gearge?” added Abel, with a rather indefensible curiosity.  “I never heard un,” said George.  And this was perhaps decisive against the Dame’s statement.  “And I don’t believe un neither.  I think it bothered she.  I believe ’tis a genteel word for a man as catches oonts. They call oonts _moles_ in some parts, so p’r’aps they calls a man as catches moles a molar, as they calls a man as drives a mill a miller.”  “’Tis likely too, Gearge,” said Abel.  “Well!  Molly we knows.  And moment, and moping, and moral.”  “What’s moral?” inquired George.  “’Tis what they put at the end of Vables, Gearge.  There’s Vables at the end of the spelling-book, and I’ve read un all.  There’s the Wolf and the Lamb, and”—  “I knows now,” said George.  “’Tis like the last verse of that song about the Harnet and the Bittle.  Go on, Abel.”  “Mortal.  That’s swearing.  Moses.  That’s in the Bible, Gearge.  Motive. I thought I’d try un just once more.  ‘What’s a motive, Dame?’ says I. ‘I’ve got un here,’ says she, quite quiet-like.  But I seed her feeling under ’s chair, and I know’d ’twas for the strap, and I ran straight off, spelling-book and all, Gearge.”  “So thee’ve been playing moocher, eh?” said George, with an unpleasant twinkle in his eyes.  “What’ll Master Lake say to that?”  “Don’t ’ee tell un, Gearge!” Abel implored; “and, O Gearge! let I tell mother about the word.  Maybe she’ve heard tell of it.  Let I show her the letter, Gearge.  She’ll read it for ’ee.  She’s a scholard, is mother.”  There was no mistaking now the wrath in George’s face.  The fury that is fed by fear blazes pretty strongly at all times.  “Look ’ee, Abel, my boy,” said he, pinching Abel’s shoulder till he turned red and white with pain.  “If thee ever speaks of that letter and that word to any mortal soul, I’ll tell Master Lake thee plays moocher, and I’ll half kill thee myself.  Thee shall rue the day ever thee was born!” he added, almost beside himself with rage and terror.  And as, after a few propitiating words, Abel fled from the mill, George ground his hands together and muttered, “Motive!  I wish the old witch had motived every bone in thee body, or let me do ’t!”  Master George Sannel was indeed a little irritable at this stage of his career.  Like the miller, he had had one stroke of good luck, but capricious fortune would not follow up the blow.  He had made five pounds pretty easily.  But how to turn some other property of which he had become possessed to profit for himself was, after months of waiting, a puzzle still.  He was well aware that his own want of education was the great hindrance to his discovering for himself the exact worth of what he had got.  And to his suspicious nature the idea of letting any one else into his secret, even to gain help, was quite intolerable.  Abel seemed to be no nearer even to the one word that George had showed him, after weeks of “schooling,” and George himself progressed so slowly in learning to read that he was at times tempted to give up the effort in despair.  Of his late outburst against Abel he afterwards repented, as impolitic, and was soon good friends again with his very placable teacher.  Much of the time when he should have been at work did George spend in “puzzling” over his position.  Sometimes, as from an upper window of the mill he saw the little Jan in Abel’s arms, he would mutter,—  “If a body were to kidnap un, would they advertise he, I wonders?” and after some consideration would shake his white head doubtfully, saying, “No, they wants to get rid of un, or they wouldn’t have brought un here.”  Happily for poor little Jan, the unscrupulous rustic rejected the next idea which came to him as too doubtful of success.  “I wonder if they’d come down something handsome to them as could tell ’em the young varmint was off their hands for good and all.  ’Twould save un ten shilling a week.  Ten shilling a week!  I heard un with my own ears.  I’d a kep’ un for five, if they’d asked me.  I wonders now. Little uns like that does get stole by gipsies sometimes.  Varmer Smith’s son were, and never heard on again.  They falls into a mill-race too sometimes.  They be so venturesome.  But I doubt ’twouldn’t do.  Them as it belongs to might be glad enough to get rid of un, and save their credit and their money too by turning upon I after all.”  The miller’s man puzzled himself in vain.  He could think of no mode of action at once safe and certain of success.  He did not even know whether what he possessed had any value, or how or where to make use of it.  But a sort of dim hope of seeing his way yet kept him about the mill, and he persevered in the effort to learn to read, and kept his big ears open for any thing that might drop from the miller or his wife to throw light on the history of Jan, with whom his hopes were bound up.  Meanwhile, with a dogged patience, he bided his time.     CHAPTER VIII.   VISITORS AT THE MILL.—A WINDMILLER OF THE THIRD GENERATION.—CURE FOR WHOOPING-COUGH.—MISS AMABEL ADELINE AMMABY.—DOCTORS DISAGREE.  ONE of the earliest of Jan’s remembrances—of those remembrances, I mean, which remained with him when childhood was past—was of little Miss Amabel, from the Grange, being held in the hopper of the windmill for whooping cough.  Jan was between three and four years old at this time, the idol of his foster-mother, and a great favorite with his adopted brothers and sisters.  A quaint little fellow he was, with a broad, intellectual-looking face, serious to old-fashionedness, very fair, and with eyes “like slans.”  He was standing one morning at Mrs. Lake’s apron-string, his arms clasped lovingly, but somewhat too tightly, round the waist of a sandy kitten, who submitted with wonderful good-humor to the well-meant strangulation, his black eyes intently fixed upon the dumplings which his foster-mother was dexterously rolling together, when a strange footstep was heard shuffling uncertainly about on the floor of the round-house just outside the dwelling-room door.  Mrs. Lake did not disturb herself.  Country folk were constantly coming with their bags of grist, and both George and the miller were at hand, for a nice breeze was blowing, and the mill ground merrily.  After a few seconds, however, came a modest knock on the room-door, and Mrs. Lake, wiping her hands, proceeded to admit the knocker.  She was a smartly dressed woman, who bore such a mass of laces and finery, with a white woollen shawl spread over it, apparently with the purpose of smothering any living thing there might chance to be beneath, as, in Mrs. Lake’s experienced eyes, could be nothing less than a baby of the most genteel order.  The manners of the nurse were most genteel also, and might have quite overpowered Mrs. Lake, but that the windmiller’s wife had in her youth been in good service herself, and, though an early marriage had prevented her from rising beyond the post of nursemaid, she was fairly familiar with the etiquette of the nursery and of the servants’ hall.  “Good morning, ma’am,” said the nurse, who no sooner ceased to walk than she began a kind of diagonal movement without progression, in which one heel clacked, and all her petticoats swung, and the baby who, head downwards, was snorting with gaping mouth under the woollen coverlet, was supposed to be soothed.  “Good morning, ma’am.  You’ll excuse my intruding”—  “Not at all, mum,” said Mrs. Lake.  By which she did not mean to reject the excuse, but to disclaim the intrusion.  When the nurse was not speaking, she kept time to her own rocking by a peculiar click of her tongue against the roof of her mouth; and indeed it sometimes mingled, almost confusingly, with her conversation.  “You’re very obliging, ma’am, I’m sure,” said she, and, persuaded by Mrs. Lake, she took a seat.  “You’ll excuse me for asking a singular question, ma’am, but _was your husband’s father and grandfather both millers_?”  “They was, mum,” said Mrs. Lake.  “My husband’s father’s father built this mill where we now stands.  It cost him a deal of money, and he died with a debt upon it.  My husband’s father paid un off; and he meant to have built a house, mum, but he never did, worse luck for us.  He allus says, says he,—that’s my husband’s father, mum,—’I’ll leave that to Abel,’—that’s my maester, mum.  But nine year ago come Michaelmas”—  Mrs. Lake’s story was here interrupted by a frightful outburst of coughing from the unfortunate baby, who on the removal of the woollen shawl presented an appearance which would have been comical but for the sympathy its condition demanded.  A very red and utterly shapeless little face lay, like a crushed beet-root, in a mass of dainty laces almost voluminous enough to have"]]]
