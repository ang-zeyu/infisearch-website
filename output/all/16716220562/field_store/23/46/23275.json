Duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish.  \"I have only four patty-pans, and they are all in the cupboard.\"  Duchess set up a howl.  \"I shall die! I shall die! I have swallowed a patty-pan! Oh, my dear Ribby, I do feel so ill!\"  \"It is impossible, my dear Duchess; there was not a patty-pan.\"  \"Yes there WAS, my dear Ribby, I am sure I have swallowed it!\"  \"Let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear Duchess; where do you think you feel it?\"  \"Oh I do feel so ill ALL OVER me, my dear Ribby.\"  \"Shall I run for the doctor?\"   \"Oh yes, yes! fetch Dr. Maggotty, my dear Ribby: he is a Pie himself, he will certainly understand.\"  Ribby settled Duchess in an armchair before the fire, and went out and hurried to the village to look for the doctor.  She found him at the smithy.  Ribby explained that her guest had swallowed a patty-pan.  Dr. Maggotty hopped so fast that Ribby had to run. It was most conspicuous. All the village could see that Ribby was fetching the doctor.  But while Ribby had been hunting for the doctor--a curious thing had happened to Duchess, who had been left by herself, sitting before the fire, sighing and groaning and feeling very unhappy.  \"How COULD I have swallowed it! such a large thing as a patty-pan!\"  She sat down again, and stared mournfully at the grate. The fire crackled and danced, and something sizz-z-zled!  Duchess started! She opened the door of the TOP oven;--out came a rich steamy flavour of veal and ham, and there stood a fine brown pie,-- and through a hole in the top of the pie-crust there was a glimpse of a little tin patty-pan!  Duchess drew a long breath--   \"Then I must have been eating MOUSE! . . . No wonder I feel ill. . . . But perhaps I should feel worse if I had really swallowed a patty-pan!\" Duchess reflected--\"What a very awkward thing to have to explain to Ribby! I think I will put MY pie in the back-yard and say nothing about it. When I go home, I will run round and take it away.\" She put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when Ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep.  \"I am feeling very much better,\" said Duchess, waking up with a jump.  \"I am truly glad to hear it! He has brought you a pill, my dear Duchess!\"  \"I think I should feel QUITE well if he only felt my pulse,\" said Duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak.  \"It is only a bread pill, you had much better take it; drink a little milk, my dear Duchess!\"  \"I am feeling very much better, my dear Ribby,\" said Duchess. \"Do you not think that I had better go home before it gets dark?\"   \"Perhaps it might be wise, my dear Duchess.\"  Ribby and Duchess said good-bye affectionately, and Duchess started home. Half-way up the lane she stopped and looked back; Ribby had gone in and shut her door. Duchess slipped through the fence, and ran round to the back of Ribby's house, and peeped into the yard.  Upon the roof of the pig-stye sat Dr. Maggotty and three jackdaws. The jackdaws were eating piecrust, and the magpie was drinking gravy out of a patty-pan.  Duchess ran home feeling uncommonly silly!  When Ribby came out for a pailful of water to wash up the tea-things, she found a pink and white pie-dish lying smashed in the middle of the yard.  Ribby stared with amazement-- \"Did you ever see the like! so there really WAS a patty-pan? . . . But MY patty-pans are all in the kitchen cupboard. Well I never did! . . . Next time I want to give a party--I will invite Cousin Tabitha Twitchit!\"     THE TALE OF MR. JEREMY FISHER  [For Stephanie from Cousin B.]   Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr. Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond.  The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage.  But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold!  He was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain, splashing in the pond--   \"I will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"If I catch more than five fish, I will invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise and Sir Isaac Newton. The Alderman, however, eats salad.\"  Mr. Jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat.  The boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. It was tied to a water-plant in the middle of the pond.   Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the boat out into open water. \"I know a good place for minnows,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and fastened the boat to it.  Then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle. He had the dearest little red float. His rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end.  The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float.  \"This is getting tiresome, I think I should like some lunch,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.   He punted back again amongst the water-plants, and took some lunch out of his basket.  \"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait till the shower is over,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  A great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes.  Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich.  Once or twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash amongst the rushes at the side of the pond.  \"I trust that is not a rat,\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher; \"I think I had better get away from here.\"   Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. There was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit!  \"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!\" cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher, jerking up his rod.  But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy landed little Jack Sharp, the stickleback, covered with spines!  The stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back into the water.   And a shoal of other little fishes put their heads out, and laughed at Mr. Jeremy Fisher.  And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a MUCH worse thing happened; a really FRIGHTFUL thing it would have been, if Mr. Jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh!  A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\"--and then it turned and dived down to the bottom of the pond!   But the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's galoshes.  Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he swam with all his might to the edge of the pond.  He scrambled out on the first bank he came to, and he hopped home across the meadow with his mackintosh all in tatters.   \"What a mercy that was not a pike!\" said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. \"I have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for I am sure I should never have dared to go fishing again!\"  He put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. He could not offer them fish, but he had something else in his larder.  Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat.   And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag.  And instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _I_ think it must have been nasty!    THE STORY OF A FIERCE BAD RABBIT     This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers and his claws and his turned-up tail.  This is a nice gentle Rabbit. His mother has given him a carrot.  The bad Rabbit would like some carrot.   He doesn't say \"Please.\" He takes it!  And he scratches the good Rabbit very badly.  The good Rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole. It feels sad.   This is a man with a gun.  He sees something sitting on a bench. He thinks it is a very funny bird!  He comes creeping up behind the trees.   And then he shoots--BANG!  This is what happens--  But this is all he finds on the bench when he rushes up with his gun.   The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole . . .  . . . and it sees the bad Rabbit tearing past--without any tail or whiskers!    THE STORY OF MISS MOPPET    This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet; she thinks she has heard a mouse!  This is the Mouse peeping out behind the cupboard and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten.  This is Miss Moppet jumping just too late; she misses the Mouse and hits her own head.   She thinks it is a very hard cupboard!  The Mouse watches Miss Moppet from the top of the cupboard.  Miss Moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire.   The Mouse thinks she is looking very ill. He comes sliding down the bellpull.  Miss Moppet looks worse and worse. The Mouse comes a little nearer.  Miss Moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster. The Mouse comes VERY close.   And then all of a sudden--Miss Moppet jumps upon the Mouse!  And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet--Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse, which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet.  She ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball.   But she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/572"],["title","The Great Big Treasury of Beatrix Potter (#6)"],["body","se!  He has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard!    THE TALE OF TOM KITTEN  [Dedicated to All Pickles, --Especially to Those That Get upon My Garden Wall]     Once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were Mittens, Tom Kitten, and Moppet.  They had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  But one day their mother--Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.  First she scrubbed their faces (this one is Moppet).   Then she brushed their fur (this one is Mittens).  Then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is Tom Kitten).  Tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  Mrs. Tabitha dressed Moppet and Mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son Thomas.   Tom Kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. His mother sewed them on again.  When the three kittens were ready, Mrs. Tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  \"Now keep your frocks clean, children! You must walk on your hind legs. Keep away from the dirty ash- pit, and from Sally Henny Penny, and from the pigsty and the Puddle- ducks.\"  Moppet and Mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. Presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  When they stood up there were several green smears!   \"Let us climb up the rockery and sit on the garden wall,\" said Moppet.  They turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; Moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.  Tom Kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. He came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left.  He was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  Moppet and Mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.   While they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three Puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  They stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens. They had very small eyes and looked surprised. Then the two duck-birds, Rebeccah and Jemima Puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.   Mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. Moppet and Tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of Tom's clothes came off on the way down.  \"Come! Mr. Drake Puddle-duck,\" said Moppet. \"Come and help us to dress him! Come and button up Tom!\"  Mr. Drake Puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles.  But he put them on HIMSELF! They fitted him even worse than Tom Kitten.  \"It's a very fine morning!\" said Mr. Drake Puddle-duck.   And he and Jemima and Rebeccah Puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  Then Tabitha Twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.  She pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  \"My friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; I am affronted,\" said Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit.   She sent them upstairs; and I am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles-- which was not true.  Quite the contrary; they were not in bed: NOT in the least.  Somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  And I think that some day I shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about Tom Kitten!   As for the Puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  The clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.  And Mr. Drake Puddle-duck, and Jemima and Rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.    THE TALE OF JEMIMA PUDDLE-DUCK  [A Farmyard Tale for Ralph and Betsy]    What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  Listen to the story of Jemima Puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.  Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Rebeccah Puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to someone else-- \"I have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, Jemima. You would let them go cold; you know you would!\"  \"I wish to hatch my own eggs; I will hatch them all by myself,\" quacked Jemima Puddle-duck.  She tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  Jemima Puddle-duck became quite desperate. She determined to make a nest right away from the farm.   She set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart road that leads over the hill.  She was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.  When she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  She thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.  Jemima Puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. She ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.   She flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  She skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.  Jemima alighted rather heavily and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting place. She rather fancied a tree stump amongst some tall foxgloves.  But--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.  \"Quack?\" said Jemima Puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--\"Quack?\"  The gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at Jemima--  \"Madam, have you lost your way?\" said he. He had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. She explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place.   \"Ah! is that so? Indeed!\" said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at Jemima. He folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket.  Jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  \"Indeed! How interesting! I wish I could meet with that fowl. I would teach it to mind its own business!  \"But as to a nest--there is no difficulty: I have a sackful of feathers in my woodshed. No, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. You may sit there as long as you like,\" said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  He led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves.  It was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.  \"This is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient,\" said the hospitable gentleman.  There was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes. The gentleman opened the door and showed Jemima in.   The shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  Jemima Puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. But it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.  When she came out, the sandy- whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  He was so polite that he seemed almost sorry to let Jemima go home for the night. He promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again the next day.  He said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed.  Jemima Puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. They were greeny white and very large. The foxy gentleman admired them immensely. He used to turn them over and count them when Jemima was not there.  At last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--\"and I will bring a bag of corn with me, so that I need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. They might catch cold,\" said the conscientious Jemima.   \"Madam, I beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; I will provide oats. But before you commence your tedious sitting, I intend to give you a treat. Let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!  \"May I ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet? Sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. I will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelet,\" said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.  Jemima Puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  She went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.  And she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions out of a basket.  The collie dog Kep met her coming out, \"What are you doing with those onions? Where do you go every afternoon by yourself, Jemima Puddle-duck?\"  Jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  The collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.   He asked several questions about the wood and about the exact position of the house and shed.  Then he went out, and trotted down the village. He went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.  Jemima Puddle-duck went up the cart road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. She was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  She flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  He was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air and kept glancing uneasily round the"]]]
