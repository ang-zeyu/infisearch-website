Raban laughed heartily, and lame Jungel, chuckling, rapped on the floor with his right crutch, exclaiming:  \"Good for you!\"  Kuni was accustomed to such outbursts of merriment.  They were almost always awakened by some trifle, and this time she did not even hear the laughing.  But Cyriax struck his wife so rudely on the hand that she jerked furiously at the chain and, with a muttered oath, blew on the bruised spot.  Meanwhile Gundel was telling the group how many distinguished gentlemen had formerly paid court to Kuni.  She was as agile as a squirrel.  Her pretty little face, with its sparkling blue eyes, attracted the men as bacon draws mice.  Then, pleased to have listeners, she related how the girl had lured florins and zecchins from the purse of many a wealthy ecclesiastic.  She might have been as rich as the Fuggers if she hadn't met with the accident and had understood how to keep what she earned.  But she could not hold on to her gold.  She had flung it away like useless rubbish.  So long as she possessed anything there had been no want in Loni's company.  She, Gundel, had caught her arm more than once when she was going to fling Hungarian ducats, instead of coppers, to good-for-nothing beggars.  She had often urged her, too, to think of old age, but Kuni--never cared for any one longer than a few weeks, though there were some whom she might easily have induced to offer her the wedding ring.  She glanced at Kuni again, but, perceiving that the girl did not yet vouchsafe her even a single look, she was vexed, and, moving nearer to Cyriax, she added in a still lower tone:  \"A more inconstant, faithless, colder heart than hers I never met, even among the most disorderly of Loni's band; for, blindly as the infatuated lovers obeyed every one of her crazy whims, she laughed at the best and truest.  'I hate them all,' she would say.  'I wouldn't let one of them even touch me with the tip of his finger if I could not use their zecchins.  'With these,' she said,  'she would help the rich to restore to the poor what they had stolen from them.' She really treated many a worthy gentleman like a dog, nay, a great deal worse; for she was tender enough to all the animals that travelled with the company; the poodles and the ponies, nay, even the parrots and the doves.  She would play with the children, too, even the smallest ones--isn't that so, Peperle?--like their own silly mothers.\"  She smoothed the blind boy's golden hair as she spoke, then added, sighing:  \"But the little fellow was too young to remember it.  The rattle which she gave him at Augsburg--it was just before the accident--because she was so fond of him--Saint Kunigunde, how could we keep such worthless jewels in our sore need?--was made of pure silver.  True, the simpletons who were so madly in love with her, and with whom she played so cruelly, would have believed her capable of anything sooner than such kindness. There was a Swabian knight, a young fellow----\"  Here she stopped, for Cyriax and the other vagabonds, even the girl of whom she was speaking, had started up and were gazing at the door.  Kuni opened her eyes as wide as if a miracle had happened, and the crimson spots on her sunken cheeks betrayed how deeply she was agitated. But she had never experienced anything of this kind; for while thinking of the time when, through Lienhard Groland's intercession, she had entered the house of the wealthy old Frau Schurstab, in order to become estranged from a vagabond life, and recalling how once, when he saw her sorrowful there, he had spoken kindly to her, it seemed as if she had actually heard his own voice.  As it still appeared to echo in her ears, she suddenly became aware that the words really did proceed from his lips.  What she had heard in her dream and what now came from his own mouth, as he stood at the door, blended into one.  She would never have believed that the power of imagination could reproduce anything so faithfully.  Listening intently, she said to herself that, during the many thousand times when she had talked with him in fancy, it had also seemed as if she heard him speak.  And the same experience had befallen her eyes; for whenever memory reverted to those distant days, she had beheld him just as he now looked standing on the threshold, where he was detained by the landlady of The Pike.  Only his face had become still more manly, his bearing more dignified.  The pleasant, winning expression of the bearded lips remained unchanged, and more than once she had seen his eyes sparkle with a far warmer light than now, while he was thanking the portly woman for her cordial welcome.  While Kuni's gaze still rested upon him as if spellbound, Cyriax nudged her, stammering hurriedly:  \"They will have to pass us.  Move forward, women, in front of me.  Spread out your skirt, you Redhead!  It might be my death if yonder Nuremberg fine gentleman should see me here and recollect one thing and another.\"  As he spoke he dragged Kuni roughly from the window, flung the sack which he had brought in from the cart down before him, and made them sit on it, while he stretched himself on the floor face downward, and pretended to be asleep behind the women.  This suited Kuni.  If Lienhard Groland passed her now he could not help seeing her, and she had no greater desire than to meet his glance once more before her life ended.  Yet she dreaded this meeting with an intensity plainly revealed by the passionate throbbing of her heart and the panting of her weakened lungs.  There was a rushing noise in her ears, and her eyes grew dim.  Yet she was obliged to keep them wide open- -what might not the next moment bring?  For the first time since her entrance she gazed around the large, long apartment, which would have deserved the name of hall had it not been too low.  The heated room, filled with buzzing flies, was crowded with travellers. The wife and daughter of a feather-curler, who were on their way with the husband and father to the Reichstag, where many an aristocratic gentleman would need plumes for his own head and his wife's, had just dropped the comb with which they were arranging each other's hair.  The shoemaker and his dame from Nuremberg paused in the sensible lecture they were alternately addressing to their apprentices.  The Frankfort messenger put down the needle with which he was mending the badgerskin in his knapsack. The travelling musicians who, to save a few pennies, had begun to eat bread, cheese, and radishes, instead of the warm meals provided for the others, let their knives drop and set down the wine-jugs.  The traders, who were hotly arguing over Italian politics and the future war with Turkey, were silent.  The four monks, who had leaned their heads against the cornice of the wide, closed fireplace and, in spite of the flies which buzzed around them, had fallen asleep, awoke.  The vender of indulgences in the black cowl interrupted the impressive speech which he was delivering to the people who surrounded his coffer.  This group also --soldiers, travelling artisans, peasants, and tradesfolk with their wives, who, like most of those present, were waiting for the vessel which was to sail down the Main early the next morning--gazed toward the door. Only the students and Bacchantes,--[Travelling scholars]--who were fairly hanging on the lips of a short, slender scholar, with keen, intellectual features, noticed neither the draught of air caused by the entrance of the distinguished arrivals and their followers, nor the general stir aroused by their appearance, until Dr. Eberbach, the insignificant, vivacious speaker, recognised in one of the group the famous Nuremberg humanist, Wilibald Pirckheimer.     CHAPTER II.  At first Dietel, the old waiter, whose bullet-shaped head was covered with thick gray hair, also failed to notice them.  Without heeding their entrance, he continued,--aided by two assistants who were scarcely beyond boyhood,--to set the large and small pine tables which he had placed wherever he could find room.  The patched tablecloths which he spread over the tops were coarse and much worn; the dishes carried after him by the two assistants, whose knees bent under the burden, were made of tin, and marred by many a dent. He swung his stout body to and fro with jerks like a grasshopper, and in doing so his shirt rose above his belt, but the white napkin under his arm did not move a finger's width.  In small things, as well as great ones, Dietel was very methodical.  So he continued his occupation undisturbed till an inexperienced merchant's clerk from Ulm, who wanted to ride farther speedily, accosted him and asked for some special dish. Dietel drew his belt farther down and promptly snubbed the young man with the angry retort; \"Everybody must wait for his meal.  We make no exceptions here.\"  Interrupted in his work, he also saw the newcomers, and then cast a peevish glance at one corner of the room, where stood a table covered with fine linen and set with silver dishes, among them a platter on which early pears and juicy plums were spread invitingly.  The landlady of The Pike had arranged them daintily upon fresh vine leaves an hour before with her own plump but nimble hands.  Of course they were intended for the gentlemen from Nuremberg and their guests.  Dietel, too, now knew them, and saw that the party numbered a person no less distinguished than the far-famed and highly learned Doctor and Imperial Councillor, Conrad Peutinger.  They were riding to Cologne together under the same escort. The citizens of Nuremberg were distinguished men, as well as their guest, but Dietel had served distinguished personages by the dozen at The Blue Pike for many years--among them even crowned heads--and they had wanted"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5584"],["title","In the Blue Pike — Volume 01 (#3)"],["body","nothing.  His skill, however, was not sufficient for these city demigods; for the landlord of The Pike intended to look after their table himself.  Tomfoolery!  There was more than enough for him to do that day over yonder in the room occupied by the lansquenets and the city soldiers, where he usually directed affairs in person.  It roused Dietel's ire.  The cooking of The Blue Pike, which the landlady superintended, could vie with any in the Frank country, on the Rhine, or in Swabia, yet, forsooth, it wasn't good enough for the Nuremberg guests. The Council cook, a fat, pompous fellow, accompanied them, and had already begun to bustle about the hearth beside the hostess.  They really would have required no service at all, for they brought their own attendants.  It certainly was not Dietel's usual custom to wish any one evil, but if Gotz Berlichinger, who had recently attacked a party of Leipsic merchants at Forchheim, or Hans von Geisslingen had fallen upon them and subdued their arrogance, it would not have spoiled Dietel's appetite.  At last they moved forward.  The others might treat them as they chose; he, at least, would neither say anything to them nor bow before them as the ears did before Joseph in Holy Writ.  Nevertheless, he looked out of the corner of his eye at them as he took from the basket of the round- checked kitchen maid, who had now found her way to him, one fresh brown roll after another, and placed them beside plate after plate.  How well risen and how crusty they were!  They fairly cracked under the pressure of the thumb, yet wheat rolls had been baked specially for the Nuremberg party.  Was God's good gift too poor for the Honourables with the gold chains?  Now, even fragile little Dr. Eberbach, and the students and Bacchantes who had stood around him like disciples, intently listening to his words, bowed respectfully.  The ungodly, insolent fellows who surrounded the Dominican Jacobus, the vender of indulgences, had turned from him, while he exhorted them, as if he were an importunate beggar.  What did the merchants, artisans, and musicians know about the godless Greek and Latin writings which brought the names of Pirckheimer and Peutinger before the people, yet how reverently many of these folk now bowed before them. Only the soldiers with swords at their sides held their heads erect. They proved that they were right in calling themselves \"pious lansquenets.\"  The broad-shouldered knight, with the plumed hat and suit of mail, who walked beside them, was Sir Hans von Obernitz, the Schultheiss of Nuremberg.  He was said to be a descendant of the ancient Brandenstein race, and yet--was the world topsy-turvy?--he, too, was listening to every word uttered by Wilibald Pirckheimer and Dr. Peutinger as if it were a revelation.  The gray-haired leech and antiquary, Hartmann Schedel, whom Herr Wilibald,--spite of the gout which sometimes forced a slight grimace to distort his smooth-shaven, clever, almost over-plump face,--led by the arm like a careful son, resembled, with his long, silver locks, a patriarch or an apostle.  The young envoy of the Council, Herr Lienhard Groland, lingered behind the others and seemed to be taking a survey of the room.  What bright, keen eyes he had; how delicately cut was the oval face with the strong, very slightly hooked nose; how thick were the waving brown locks that fell upon the slender neck; how well the pointed beard suited his chin; with what austere majesty his head rose above the broad, plaited, snow-white ruff, which he must have just donned!  Now his eyes rested upon the vagrants, and Dietel perceived something which threw him completely off his balance; for the first time he changed the position of his napkin, jerking it from its place under his left arm to tuck it beneath the right one.  He had known Kuni a long time.  In her prosperous days, when she was the ornament of Loni's band and had attracted men as a ripe pear draws wasps, she had often been at the tavern, and both he and the landlord of The Pike had greeted her cordially, for whoever sought her favour was obliged to order the best and dearest of everything, not only for her and himself, but for a whole tableful of hungry guests.  When she had met him just now he would never have recognised her had she not been in Gundel's company.  True, the sight of her in this plight was not unexpected, yet it pierced him to the heart, for Kuni had been a remarkable girl, and yet was now in far greater penury than many of much less worth whom he had watched stumbling along the downward path before her.  When he saw Lienhard Groland's glance rest upon her, he noticed also how strangely her emaciated face changed colour.  Though it had just been as white as the napkin under his arm, it now flushed as red as the balsam blossoms in the window, and then paled again.  She had formerly gazed around her boldly enough, but now she lowered her eyes to the floor as modestly as any demure maiden on her way to church.  And what did this mean?  The honourable member of the Nuremberg Council must be well acquainted with the girl, for his eyes had scarcely met hers ere a strange smile flitted over his grave, manly face.  Now--was it in jest or earnest?--he even shook his finger at her.  He stopped in front of her a moment, too, and Dietel heard him exclaim:  \"So here you are!  On the highway again, in spite of everything?\"  The distance which separated them and the loud talking of the guests prevented the waiter's hearing her reply, \"The captive bird can not endure the cage long, Herr Lienhard,\" far less the words, added in a lower tone:  \"Yet flight has been over since my fall at Augsburg.  My foot lies buried there with many other things which will never return.  I can only move on wheels behind the person who takes me.\"  Then she paused and ventured to look him full in the face.  Her eyes met his beaming with a radiant light, but directly after they were dimmed by a mist of tears.  Yet she forced them back, though the deep suffering from which they sprung was touchingly apparent in the tone of her voice, as she continued:  \"I have often wished, Herr Lienhard, that the cart was my coffin and the tavern the graveyard.\"  Dietel noticed the fit of coughing which followed this speech, and the hasty movement with which the Nuremberg patrician thrust his hand into his purse and tossed Kuni three coins.  They did not shine with the dull white lustre of silver, but with the yellow glitter of gold.  The waiter's eyes were sharp and he had his own ideas about this unprecedented liberality.  The travelling companions of the aristocratic burgomaster and ambassadors of the proud city of Nuremberg had also noticed this incident.  After they had taken their seats at the handsomely ornamented table, Wilibald Pirckheimer bent toward the ear of his young friend and companion in office, whispering:  \"The  lovely wife  at  home whom  you toiled so hard to win, might, I know, rest quietly, secure in the possession of all the charms of foam- born Aphrodite, yet I warn you.  Whoever is as sure of himself as you cares little for the opinion of others.  And yet we stand high, friend Lienhard, and therefore are seen by all; but the old Argus who watches for his neighbour's faults has a hundred sharp eyes, while among the gods three are blind--Justice, Happiness, and Love.  Besides, you flung gold to yonder worthless rabble.  I would rather have given it to the travelling musicians.  They, like us humanists, are allied to the Muses and, moreover, are harmless, happy folk.\"  Lienhard Groland listened till his older friend had finished.  Then, after thanking him for his well-meant counsel, he answered, turning to the others also:  \"In better days rope-dancing was the profession of yonder poor, coughing creature.  Now, after a severe accident, she is dragging herself through life on one foot.  I once knew her, for I succeeded in saving her from terrible disgrace.\"  \"And,\" replied Wilibald Pirckheimer, \"we would rather show kindness a second and a third time to any one on whom we have be stowed a favour than to render it once to a person from whom we have received one.  This is my own experience.  But the wise man must guard against nothing more carefully than to exceed moderation in his charity.  How easily, when Caius sees Cnejus lavish gold where silver or copper would serve, he thinks of Martial's apt words: 'Who gives great gifts, expects great gifts again.'--[Martial, Epigram 5, 59, 3.]--Do not misunderstand me. What could yonder poor thing bestow that would please even a groom?  But the eyes of suspicion scan even the past.  I have often seen you open your purse, friend Lienhard, and this is right.  Whoever hath ought to give, and my dead mother used to say that: 'No one ever became a beggar by giving at the proper time.'\"  \"And life is gladdened by what one gives to another,\" remarked Conrad Peutinger, the learned Augsburg city clerk, who valued his Padua title of doctor more than that of an imperial councillor.  \"It applies to all departments.  Don't allow yourself to regret your generosity, friend Lienhard.  'Nothing becomes man better than the pleasure of giving,' says Terentius.--[Terenz.  Ad.  360]--Who is more liberal than the destiny which adorns the apple tree that is to bear a hundred fruits, with ten thousand blossoms to please our eyes ere it satisfies our appetite?\"  \"To you, if to any one, it gives daily proof of liberality in both learning and the affairs of life,\" Herr Wilibald assented.  \"If you will substitute 'God, our Lord,' for 'destiny,' I agree with you,\" observed the Abbot of St. AEgidius in Nuremberg.  The portly old prelate nodded cordially to Dr. Peutinger as he spoke. The warm, human love with which he devoted himself to the care of souls in his great parish consumed the lion's share of his time and strength. He spent only his leisure hours in the study of the ancient writers, in whom he found pleasure, and"]]]
