The twenty-eighth contains the famous _tableau_ of the reign of Louis XIV, and the twenty-ninth (1918) consists of an index to all the previous volumes.  The materials which Saint-Simon had accumulated for his great design were derived from many sources, written and oral. His written sources included, besides the Journal of Dangeau, numerous memoirs and histories which were his favourite reading, the great genealogical work of Père Anselme, published in 1674, the _Grand Dictionnaire Historique_ of Moreri, which appeared in the same year, and the work of the German genealogist Imhof, _Excellentium in Gallia Familiarum Genealogiae_ (1687), all of which no doubt had a place in his own library of 6000 volumes.  His oral sources are fairly well known to us, for he generally indicates the quarter from which he derives his information. First in importance were the three ministers, Pontchartrain, Chamillart, and Beauvillier, with all of whom he was very intimate. But both Beauvillier and Chevreuse knew how to be reticent with their young friend when occasion required, and he says that they gave him much less information than either Pontchartrain or the Maréchal de Boufflers. Another useful _liaison_--to use his favourite term--was that with the Duc and Duchesse de Villeroy, both of whom were great friends of Mme de Caylus, Mme de Maintenon’s cousin. The Duc was a son of the Maréchal de Villeroy and the Duchesse was a daughter of Louvois. Mme de Levis, a daughter of the Duc de Chevreuse, was also of some service, for she was intimate with Mme de Maintenon. The young Duchesse de Lorges, Mme de Saint-Simon’s sister-in-law, was a daughter of Chamillart, and her sister was married to that ardent courtier, the Duc de La Feuillade. Saint-Simon tells us that he generally ended his day with a visit to these ladies, from whom he often learnt something. More suspicious sources of information were the Maréchale de Rochefort, bedchamber-woman to the Dauphine, and friend in succession to all the royal favourites-in-chief; her daughter, Mme de Blansac; and the celebrated Lauzun who married another sister-in-law of Saint-Simon. A Gascon by birth and a _farceur_ by temperament, he evidently enjoyed pulling his brother-in-law’s leg, and the long chapter which Saint-Simon devotes to him just before the close of the _Memoirs_, though full of amusing and interesting matter, must not be accepted as gospel truth.  One of the most curious figures at the Court was Mme de La Chausseraye, at one time lady-in-waiting to Madame. Thanks to her _esprit_ and her talent for intrigue, she acquired great influence with various ministers and became very rich, losing large sums at cards, but recouping herself by the good things which the King and the Controller-General put in her way. The King was much diverted by her amusing conversation, and she declared that she had won and kept his favour by the sole method of hiding her intelligence and leaving him with a sense of his intellectual superiority. When it is added that she had also great credit with the royal valets, it may be imagined how useful she was to Saint-Simon, and how eagerly he cultivated her society. “J’étois sur elle sur un pied d’amitié et de recherche[3].” One can also imagine his feelings when many years after her death he learnt from her confessor that she had written “very curious” memoirs, but that by his advice she had committed them to the flames.    [3] See _Mémoires_, IV. 222-224; XIII. 90-97.  Saint-Simon’s curiosity was unbounded and he left no channel of information untapped. “Je me suis toujours instruit journellement de toutes choses par des canaux purs, directs et certains, et de toutes choses grandes et petites[4].” And among his more lowly channels were the royal valets. For, as he says, “le hasard apprend souvent par les valets les choses qu’on croit bien cachées.” He was on excellent terms with Bontemps, the King’s chief valet, who died in 1701 at the age of eighty, a man of high character, thoroughly honest and disinterested, and with Bloin, who was in the King’s service at the time of his death. Another serviceable informant, in a somewhat higher position, was Georges Maréchal, who was appointed first royal surgeon in 1703, “l’honneur et la probité même.”    [4] _Mémoires_, VII. 19. The page and a half which precedes this   throws considerable light on Saint-Simon’s sources of information.  Whenever any chance occasion offered of obtaining special information Saint-Simon pounced upon it with eager avidity. He describes, for instance, how he travelled from Fontainebleau to Paris with the Marquis de Louville, head of the French household of the King of Spain, and how he put so many questions to him that the poor man arrived _sans voix et ne pouvant plus parler_. Later he records a conversation with the Princesse des Ursins, who had also just returned from Spain. It lasted eight hours, “which seemed to him eight minutes.”  In the concluding chapter of his _Memoirs_ he claims for them accuracy and veracity. He says that the greater part is based on his own personal experience, and that the rest comes to him at first hand from the actors in the events that he narrates. “I give their names, which, as well as my intimacy with them, are beyond all suspicion. When my information comes from a less sure source I call attention to it, and when I am ignorant, I am not ashamed to avow it.”  This claim is made in all good faith, and as far as the sources of information go it is not far from the truth. But when one goes on to inquire how Saint-Simon has dealt with his sources, the result is not quite so satisfactory. For he suffers from the three failings which are the chief sources of error in a historian. Firstly, he is careless--chiefly, indeed, about figures and dates, but he sometimes copies Dangeau incorrectly. Secondly, he is uncritical. Though he does not retail mere gossip, he readily believes current stories. The ministers, the court-ladies, the valets from whom he obtained his information may have told him what they believed to be the truth, but Saint-Simon did not cross-examine them or otherwise control their statements. Moreover, some of his witnesses are evidently untrustworthy, whether from self-interest, or whether, like Lauzun, they were given to drawing upon their own invention. Thus Saint-Simon’s account of some of the events narrated in his _Memoirs_ has been disproved by modern criticism. The death, for instance, of Monsieur’s first wife, Henrietta of England, was certainly due to natural causes, and not, as Saint-Simon says, to poison.  The third and chief disturbing element which must be taken into account in judging of Saint-Simon’s veracity is prejudice--and that no mere ordinary prejudice, but rather a bundle of prejudices, all intensified to the height of passion. As we have seen, his father had instilled into him the dislike of certain families and of all Secretaries of State. It was probably too his father who implanted in him that excessive estimate of his importance as a _duc et pair_ from which sprang his contempt for the whole _bourgeoisie_, including the _noblesse de robe_, and his prejudice against the monarch who chose his ministers almost exclusively from that class. It was the same aristocratic prejudice which inspired his hatred of “the widow Scarron,” and his dislike of Villars, whom as the great-grandson of a _greffier_ he could not forgive for being made a Duke. Some, however, of his prejudices were due to nobler motives. It was Vendôme’s sloth and debauchery that blinded him to that commander’s high qualities in the field. It was his righteous indignation at the “double adultery” of Louis XIV and Mme de Montespan that filled him with hatred against their bastards. It was the scandal of the official recognition of the royal harem that still further prejudiced him against the King.  But there were also less worthy prejudices, inspired by more personal feelings. The malignant portrait of Achille de Harlay is partly a reprisal for that magistrate’s supposed partiality in the matter of Luxembourg’s dispute with his fellow dukes and peers. The estimate of the _grand_ Dauphin might have been less contemptuous but for Saint-Simon’s enmity with that _cabale de Meudon_ of which the Dauphin was the centre. Other portraits coloured by the passion of a strong antipathy are those of Père Tellier, the Cardinal de Bouillon, the Duc de Noailles, and the Maréchal de Villars. Blackest of all is the famous portrait of Cardinal Dubois. But though it shews evident signs of personal resentment and class prejudice, and though it has been alleged on the Cardinal’s behalf that an honest woman like Madame and a saint like Fénelon gave him their friendly esteem[5], Saint-Simon’s reading of his character may be mainly due to a deeper insight and a more searching analysis.    [5] Madame changed her opinion later. See below, p. 198, n. 253.  But Saint-Simon was a good lover as well as a good hater, and many of his portraits are coloured by the promptings of warm affection. His estimate of the Duc de Bourgogne is, as Sainte-Beuve has pointed out, more favourable than Fénelon’s. His finished picture of Cardinal d’Estrées and his slighter sketch of Cardinal Janson are admirable examples of kindly portraiture. To the Maréchal de Boufflers and to the Chancellor Pontchartrain and his wife he pays noble tributes of admiring friendship. His praise of Catinat, that able commander and disinterested patriot, reads like a page of Plutarch. Memorable too are the portraits of the two Dukes, Beauvillier and Chevreuse, for whom he reserved his deepest affection. He is not blind to their limitations or their failings, but he praises them with the sympathetic comprehension of one who, honest and high-minded himself, can appreciate these qualities to the full when they are displayed in the persons of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/57929"],["title","Selections from Saint-Simon (#4)"],["body","friends. The portrait of the Duc de Montfort, the son of his friend the Duc de Chevreuse, is a masterpiece of admiring sympathy[6].    [6] IV. 143.  To these two classes of favourable and unfavourable portraits, the former softened by affection, the latter exaggerated by hate, must be added a large number of portraits in which good and bad are intermingled, and which bear throughout the stamp of an impartial estimate. One of the finest of these is the Prince de Conti; less elaborate but hardly less skilful is the Cardinal de Rohan. But the palm for this class of portrait must be awarded to that of the Duke of Orleans. As one of the protagonists in Saint-Simon’s drama he is naturally a prominent figure and the general impression that we get of his character is deepened by numerous touches. But just before the close of Louis XIV’s reign he is presented in a long and leisurely digression, which forms one of the great chapters in Saint-Simon’s narrative. At the other end of the scale to this full-length and elaborately drawn portrait are the little miniatures of minor personages with which the work is interspersed. Among the most notable are Mme de Castries, the Duchesse de Gesvres, M. du Guet, Le Haquais, Toussaint Rose, one of the King’s secretaries, and Bontemps, his chief valet.  But whether the portraits are finished works of art or mere sketches, whether they are inspired by hatred or by admiration, whether they are partial or impartial, they all alike have this virtue that they are intensely alive. We know the originals both in their outward semblance and in their inmost being. While Racine is concerned only with souls, while La Bruyère’s main interest is in habits and manners as an index to character, Saint-Simon, who began his survey of humanity just before his two older contemporaries finished theirs, gives us body and soul alike. In this he resembles Balzac, but he has this advantage over the great novelist that dealing with real men and women, and not with the creatures of his imagination, he is never tempted to make the outward appearance match the inner character. Nor, as superficial judges are apt to do in real life, does he hastily infer the character from the outward appearance. He deals with both on their merits; he first calls up before us the outward man, and then he gives us his character from an independent study of his idiosyncrasies and actions. “The features of the portrait,” to borrow Montaigne’s phrase, “may go astray,” but we have before us a living man, drawn by a supreme artist. Thus the whole work, if not like Balzac’s, a complete _comédie humaine_, may be fitly called the _Comédie de Versailles_.  For Saint-Simon does not merely give us living men and women, he shews them to us in action, he reproduces their movements, their gestures, their tricks of speech. There is nothing more wonderful in the whole of French literature than his account of the _spectacle de Versailles_ after the death of Monseigneur. It is not in the literal sense a drama, for it lacks a plot to give it unity, but it is a superb dramatic _tableau_, glowing with life and throbbing with a passionate intensity.  The best commentary on this comedy is La Bruyère’s chapter _On the Court_, the essence of which is distilled in the following passage:      Il y a un pays où les joies sont visibles, mais fausses; et les     chagrins cachés, mais réels. Qui croirait que l’empressement     pour les spectacles, que les éclats et les applaudissements aux     théâtres de _Molière_ et d’_Arlequin_, les repas, la chasse,     les ballets, les carrousels, couvrissent tant d’inquiétudes, de     soins et de divers intérêts, tant de craintes et d’espérances,     de passions si vives et des affaires si sérieuses?  When La Bruyère printed this _remarque_ in the first edition of _Les Caractères_ (1688), the Court of Louis XIV, partly under the influence of Mme de Maintenon and partly as the result of the King’s serious illness in 1686, had begun to wear that aspect of seriousness and gloom which overshadowed it during the remaining years of the reign. The conversion of the King to the regular observance of Catholic practices, and the general atmosphere of piety which this conversion diffused shewed itself in various ways, and amongst others in the repression of pleasures to which with advancing years he was becoming less inclined. In the very year 1694 in which Saint-Simon began to make notes for his _Memoirs_ Bossuet attacked the stage in his well-known _Maximes et Réflexions sur la Comédie_. In 1696 the police made a sudden descent on the Hôtel de Bourgogne and summarily suppressed the Italian actors. From this time for many years the only theatre in Paris was the _Comédie Française_.  Versailles became more and more serious and gloomy. “La vie de la cour est un jeu sérieux, mélancolique,” says La Bruyère in the _remarque_ which follows that quoted above. A far worse feature was the inevitable growth of hypocrisy. “Un (faux) dévot est celui qui, sous un roi athée, serait athée.” A good story in illustration of this hypocrisy is told by Saint-Simon. On Thursday and Sunday evenings during the winter it was the King’s habit to attend the service of benediction in the chapel at Versailles, which in consequence was always filled with the ladies of the Court. But, if it became known that the King was not going to attend, the chapel was nearly empty. One evening M. de Brissac, major of the body-guard, an honest man who hated shams, came into the chapel just before the service and announced that His Majesty was not coming, whereupon all the ladies except three or four quietly withdrew, and when the King arrived he was much surprised to find the chapel empty. On Brissac’s telling him after the service what had happened, he laughed heartily, but the ladies, says Saint-Simon, would gladly have strangled Brissac. This anecdote well illustrates the hypocrisy of the age. Beneath the outward veneer of piety free thought and immorality reigned unchecked. Memoirs, letters, and sermons all confirm the truth of Saint-Simon’s picture. In his funeral oration on the Prince de Conti, who died in 1707, Massillon speaks of “un siècle, où la religion est devenue le jouet, ou de la débauche, ou d’une fausse science.” In a well-known letter written by Mme de Maintenon to the Princesse des Ursins in the same year she says, “Je vous avoue, Madame, que les femmes de ce temps-ci me sont insupportables: leur habillement insensé et immodeste, leur tabac, leur vin, leur gourmandise, leur grossièreté, leur paresse, tout cela est si opposé à mon goût, et, ce me semble, à la raison, que je ne puis le souffrir.” There was no worse specimen of her sex than the Duchesse de Berry, whose marriage Saint-Simon had done so much to promote, and of whom he says in his portrait of her, drawn at the close of Louis XIV’s reign, that “except for avarice, she was a model of all the vices[7].”    [7] _Mémoires_, ed. Chéruel, XI. 198-204.  The men were naturally no better than the women, and at the _hôtel_ in the Temple of the Grand Prior of Vendôme he and his brother, the Duc de Vendôme, especially during the years between the Peace of Ryswick (1697) and the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701), gave cynical displays of drunkenness and debauchery.  A less vicious characteristic of the society of Versailles, but one greatly at variance with the refinement which we associate with the age of Louis XIV, was the love of brutal and even cruel horse-play. We read in Saint-Simon of a poor old woman named Mme Panache, whose pockets the princes and princesses used to fill with roast and stewed meat, till the sauce ran down her petticoats. Or they would fillip her face and laugh at her fury, at not being able to tell who had struck her--for she could not see beyond the end of her nose. Another butt was the Princesse d’Harcourt, ugly, dirty, greedy, malicious, dishonest. She never missed a religious service, and was a constant communicant, generally after having played at cards--and openly cheated--till four in the morning. She certainly did not deserve much consideration, but her character hardly justified the Duchess of Burgundy and her ladies in making their way into her bedroom and pelting her with snowballs for half-an-hour[8].    [8] _Mémoires_, III, 346-351.  Practical joking, even when it was more or less friendly, often took a brutal or disgusting form. Louis XIV himself, that model of dignity and high-breeding, used to amuse himself with putting hair into the butter and tarts destined for Mlle de Montpensier and Mme de Thianges (the sister of Mme de Montespan), both of whom were very particular about their food. The Duc de Bourbon, La Bruyère’s pupil, and his Duchess especially distinguished themselves in this unpleasant fashion. The Duchess once flung a glass of water in the face of Santeul, the distinguished Latin poet, who was their habitual guest at Chantilly, and the Duke nearly killed him by emptying his snuff-box into his glass of champagne. On a par with these elementary notions of social merriment was the complete want of privacy and the lack of even ordinary decency. It is not too much to say that the standard of comfort at the Court of Versailles in the days of the _grand monarque_ was lower than that of an English labourer at the present day.  The lack of privacy which strikes the modern reader of Saint-Simon presumably did not trouble his contemporaries, to whom it would have seemed only natural. Certainly it did not trouble Louis XIV, who suffered from it more than anybody, but who seems to have delighted in the perpetual presence of his courtiers, as giving him ample opportunity of observing their goings in and goings out. It was part of the _espionnage_ which was one of the worst features of the _ancien régime_, and which shewed itself in more unpleasant forms, such as the strict police supervision exercised by that most capable of chiefs, Marc-René d’Arg"]]]
