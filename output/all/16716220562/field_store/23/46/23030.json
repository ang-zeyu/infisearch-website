Will you promise secrecy?\"  Barbara held out her hand with a significant glance; but Wolf, in a lower tone, continued: \"He expects to find in Spain the peaceful spot for which he longs.  There he will commend himself to the mercy of God, and prepare for the true life which death is to him.  There he expects to be free from time-killing business, and to grant his mind that which he has long desired and a thousand duties forced him to withhold.  There, in quiet leisure, he hopes to strive for knowledge and to penetrate deeply into all the new things which were discovered, invented, created, and improved during his reign, and of which he was permitted to learn far too little thoroughly.  He will endeavour to gain a better understanding of what stirs, fires, angers, and divides the theologians.  He desires to pursue in detail the vast new discoveries of the astronomers, which even amid the pressure of duties he had explained to him.  His inquisitive mind seeks to know the new discoveries of navigation, the distant countries which it brought to view.  He hopes to search into the plans and works of the architects of fortifications and makers of maps and, by no means least, he is anxious to become thoroughly familiar with the inventions of mechanicians, which have so long aroused his interest.\"  \"He liked to talk to me about these things, and the power of the human intellect, which now shows the true course of the sun and stars,\" Barbara interrupted with eager assent.  \"He often showed me the ingenious wheelwork of his Nuremberg clocks.  Once--I still hear the words--he compared the most delicate with the thousandfold more sublime works of God, the vast, ceaseless machinery of the universe, where there is no misplaced spring, no inaccurately adjusted cog in the wheels.  Oh, that glorious intellect!  What hours were those when he condescended to point out to a poor girl like me the eternal chronometers above our heads, repeat their names, and show the connection between the planets and the course of earthly events and human lives!  O Wolf!  how glorious it was! How my modest mind increased in strength!  And when I listened breathlessly, and he saw how I bowed in mute admiration before his greatness and called me his dear child, his attentive pupil, and pressed his lips to my burning brow, can I ever forget that?\"  She sobbed aloud as she spoke and, overwhelmed by the grief which mastered her, covered her face with her hands.  Wolf said nothing.  Another had robbed him of the woman he loved, and the greatest anguish of his life was not yet wholly conquered; but in this hour he felt that he had no right to be angry with Barbara, for it was to the greatest of great men that he had been forced to yield.  He need not feel it a disgrace to have succumbed to him.  \"Wawerl!\" he again exclaimed, \"in spite of the pleasant peace which I have found, I could envy you; for once, at least, the sun of love shone with full radiance into your soul.  Your experience proves how bright and long is the afterglow if it is only real.  This light, I believe, can never be extinguished, no matter how dense is the gloom which shadows life's pathway.\"  \"Yes, indeed, Wolf,\" she replied dully, with a sorrowful shake of the head.  \"The gloomy night of which you speak has come, and it will last on and on with unvarying darkness, from year to year, perhaps until the end. What you call light is the remembrance of a single brief month of May. Does it possess the power to render me happy?  No, my friend, a thousand times no!  It only saves me from despair.  But, in spite of everything\"-- and here her eyes sparkled radiantly--\"in spite of all this, I would not change places with any one on earth; for, however dark clouds may conceal the sun, when in quiet hours it once breaks through them, Wolf, how brilliant everything grows around me!\"  While speaking, she passed her hand across her brow and, as though seized with shame for her frank confession, exclaimed: \"But we will let this subject drop.  Only you must know one thing more.  I shall never be wholly impoverished.  What the past gave me was too rich and great; what I expect from the future is too precious for that.  It is growing up in distant Spain and, if Heaven accepted the great sacrifice which I once made for the boy whom you call Geronimo, if he receives what I besought for him at that time and on every returning day, then, Wolf, I shall bear the burden of my woe like a light garland of rose leaves.  Nay, more. Charles will regain his youth sooner than--be it in love or hate--he will ever forget me.  This child guarantees that.  It is and will always remain a bridge between us.  He, too, can not forget the son, and if he does----\"  \"No, Barbara, no,\" interrupted Wolf, carried away by her passionate warmth.  \"The Emperor Charles is constantly thinking of his fair-haired boy.  No one has told me so; but if he seeks in Spain the rest for which he longs, the thought of Geronimo--I am sure of that--is not the least powerful cause which draws him thither.\"  \"Do you really think so?\" asked Barbara with feverish anxiety.  \"Yes,\" he answered firmly.  \"This very morning he commanded Don Luis to take the child from Leganes to Villagarcia and commit the education of Geronimo to his wife, that he may find him what he expects and desires.\"  Here he paused, and Barbara inquired uneasily, \"And did he say nothing of Geronimo's mother--of me?\"  Wolf shook his head with silent compassion, and then reluctantly admitted: \"I ventured to mention you, but, with one of those looks which no one can resist--you know them--he ordered me to be silent.\"  Barbara's cheeks flamed with resentment and shame, but she only said, smiling bitterly: \"Grief is grief, and this new sorrow does not change the old one.  He knows best that I am something more than the poor officer's wife in the Saint-Gory quarter; but I look down, with just pride, on all the others who believe me to be nothing else.  Now and always, even long after I am dead, the world will be obliged to recognise the claim which elevates me far above the throng: I am the mother of an Emperor's son!\"  She had uttered these words with uplifted head; but Wolf gazed in wondering admiration into the beautiful face, radiant with proud self- satisfaction.  He wished to leave her with this image before his soul, and therefore hurriedly extended his hand and said farewell, after promising to fulfil her entreaty never to come to Brussels without showing by a visit that he remembered her.     CHAPTER XIV.  Pyramus Kogel, on his return, saw nothing of the deep impression which Wolf's visit had made upon Barbara.  She merely mentioned it, and carelessly said that the friend of her youth had been delighted with the children.  The news that reached her ears about what was happening in the world awakened her interest, it is true, but she took no trouble to ask for tidings.  When, the following year, her husband informed her that the Emperor's only son was about to conclude a second marriage, with Mary Tudor, of England, and Charles was to commit to Philip the sovereignty of the Netherlands, Spain, Naples, and Milan, she received it as if she had already known it.  What she learned through the neighbours of the increasing number of executions of obdurate heretics she deemed the wise measures of a devout and conscientious government.  To the children Barbara was a careful mother.  She rarely went to visit the Dubois couple.  Frau Traut either could not or was not allowed to tell her anything about her child, except that he was thriving under the maternal care of Dona Magdalena, to whom he had been confided.  The next winter, during which Charles reached his fifty-fourth year, his health failed so noticeably that the physicians despaired of his recovery.  The Brabant palace was constantly besieged by people of all classes inquiring about the condition of the still honoured and by many deeply beloved monarch, and Barbara almost daily asked for news of him. She usually entered the palace clad in black and closely veiled, for she had many acquaintances among the attendants.  Adrian was inaccessible, because his master could not spare him a single hour, but she saw his substitute, Ogier Bodart, who had served the Emperor in Ratisbon.  From him she learned how the sufferer passed the night, how the day promised, and whether the physician's opinion awakened hope or fear.  He even told her that his Majesty was occupying himself with his last will, the payment of his debts, the arrangement of the succession, and the choice of his burial place.  All this occupied Barbara's mind so deeply, and the long waiting to see Bodart often robbed her of so much time, that her housewifely and maternal duties suffered, yet her patient husband endured it a long while indulgently.  But once, when he summoned up courage and cautiously blamed her, she quietly admitted that he was right, but added that she had never concealed from him the tie which bound her to the Emperor Charles, and now that Death was stretching his hand toward him, she must be permitted to obtain news of his welfare.  The strong man silenced his dissatisfaction, and placed no obstacles in her way.  He was grateful for the maternal solicitude which she showed the children.  His kindly nature secretly approved of her spending a longer time in the Cathedral of St. Gudule than usual, praying for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/557"],["title","Puck of Pook's Hill (#0)"],["body","OF POOK'S HILL   by  RUDYARD KIPLING      CONTENTS   Weland's Sword    Puck's Song    A Tree Song  Young Men at the Manor    Sir Richard's Song  The Knights of the Joyous Venture    Harp Song of the Dane Women    Thorkild's Song  Old Men at Pevensey    The Runes on Weland's Sword  A Centurion of the Thirtieth    'Cities and Thrones and Powers'    A British-Roman Song  On the Great Wall    A Song to Mithras  The Winged Hats    A Pict Song  Hal o' the Draft    'Prophets have honour all over the Earth'    A Smugglers' Song  'Dymchurch Flit'    The Bee Boy's Song    A Three-Part Song  The Treasure and the Law    Song of the Fifth River    The Children's Song     WELAND'S SWORD   Puck's Song    See you the dimpled track that runs,   All hollow through the wheat?

She is not any common Earth,   Water or Wood or Air,   But Merlin's Isle of Gramarye,   Where you and I will fare.   The children were at the Theatre, acting to Three Cows as much as they could remember of Midsummer Night's Dream.  Their father had made them a small play out of the big Shakespeare one, and they had rehearsed it with him and with their mother till they could say it by heart.  They began when Nick Bottom the weaver comes out of the bushes with a donkey's head on his shoulders, and finds Titania, Queen of the Fairies, asleep.  Then they skipped to the part where Bottom asks three little fairies to scratch his head and bring him honey, and they ended where he falls asleep in Titania's arms.  Dan was Puck and Nick Bottom, as well as all three Fairies.  He wore a pointy-cloth cap for Puck, and a paper donkey's head out of a Christmas cracker--but it tore if you were not careful--for Bottom.  Una was Titania, with a wreath of columbines and a foxglove wand.  The Theatre lay in a meadow called the Long Slip.  A little mill-stream, carrying water to a mill two or three fields away, bent round one corner of it, and in the middle of the bend lay a large old Fairy Ring of darkened grass, which was the stage.  The millstream banks, overgrown with willow, hazel, and guelder-rose, made convenient places to wait in till your turn came; and a grown-up who had seen it said that Shakespeare himself could not have imagined a more suitable setting for his play.  They were not, of course, allowed to act on Midsummer Night itself, but they went down after tea on Midsummer Eve, when the shadows were growing, and they took their supper--hard-boiled eggs, Bath Oliver biscuits, and salt in an envelope--with them.  Three Cows had been milked and were grazing steadily with a tearing noise that one could hear all down the meadow; and the noise of the Mill at work sounded like bare feet running on hard ground.  A cuckoo sat on a gate-post singing his broken June tune, 'cuckoo-cuck', while a busy kingfisher crossed from the mill-stream, to the brook which ran on the other side of the meadow.  Everything else was a sort of thick, sleepy stillness smelling of meadow-sweet and dry grass.  Their play went beautifully.  Dan remembered all his parts--Puck, Bottom, and the three Fairies--and Una never forgot a word of Titania--not even the difficult piece where she tells the Fairies how to feed Bottom with 'apricocks, green figs, and dewberries', and all the lines end in 'ies'.  They were both so pleased that they acted it three times over from beginning to end before they sat down in the unthistly centre of the Ring to eat eggs and Bath Olivers.  This was when they heard a whistle among the alders on the bank, and they jumped.  The bushes parted.  In the very spot where Dan had stood as Puck they saw a small, brown, broad-shouldered, pointy-eared person with a snub nose, slanting blue eyes, and a grin that ran right across his freckled face.  He shaded his forehead as though he were watching Quince, Snout, Bottom, and the others rehearsing Pyramus and Thisbe, and, in a voice as deep as Three Cows asking to be milked, he began:       'What hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,      So near the cradle of the fairy Queen?'  He stopped, hollowed one hand round his ear, and, with a wicked twinkle in his eye, went on:       'What, a play toward?  I'll be an auditor;      An actor, too, perhaps, if I see cause.'  The children looked and gasped.  The small thing--he was no taller than Dan's shoulder--stepped quietly into the Ring.  'I'm rather out of practice,' said he; 'but that's the way my part ought to be played.'  Still the children stared at him--from his dark-blue cap, like a big columbine flower, to his bare, hairy feet.  At last he laughed.  'Please don't look like that.  It isn't my fault.  What else could you expect?' he said.  'We didn't expect any one,' Dan answered slowly. 'This is our field.'  'Is it?' said their visitor, sitting down.  'Then what on Human Earth made you act Midsummer Night's Dream three times over, on Midsummer Eve, in the middle of a Ring, and under--right under one of my oldest hills in Old England?  Pook's Hill--Puck's Hill--Puck's Hill--Pook's Hill!  It's as plain as the nose on my face.'  He pointed to the bare, fern-covered slope of Pook's Hill that runs up from the far side of the mill-stream to a dark wood.  Beyond that wood the ground rises and rises for five hundred feet, till at last you climb out on the bare top of Beacon Hill, to look over the Pevensey Levels and the Channel and half the naked South Downs.  'By Oak, Ash, and Thorn!' he cried, still laughing.  'If this had happened a few hundred years ago you'd have had all the People of the Hills out like bees in June!'  'We didn't know it was wrong,' said Dan.  'Wrong!'  The little fellow shook with laughter.  'Indeed, it isn't wrong.  You've done something that Kings and Knights and Scholars in old days would have given their crowns and spurs and books to find out. If Merlin himself had helped you, you couldn't have managed better! You've broken the Hills--you've broken the Hills! It hasn't happened in a thousand years.'  'We--we didn't mean to,' said Una.  'Of course you didn't!  That's just why you did it. Unluckily the Hills are empty now, and all the People of the Hills are gone.  I'm the only one left.  I'm Puck, the oldest Old Thing in England, very much at your service if--if you care to have anything to do with me.  If you don't, of course you've only to say so, and I'll go.'  He looked at the children, and the children looked at him for quite half a minute.  His eyes did not twinkle any more.  They were very kind, and there was the beginning of a good smile on his lips.  Una put out her hand.  'Don't go,' she said.  'We like you.' 'Have a Bath Oliver,' said Dan, and he passed over the squashy envelope with the eggs.  'By Oak, Ash and Thorn,' cried Puck, taking off his blue cap, 'I like you too.  Sprinkle a plenty salt on the biscuit, Dan, and I'll eat it with you.  That'll show you the sort of person I am.  Some of us'--he went on, with his mouth full--'couldn't abide Salt, or Horse-shoes over a door, or Mountain-ash berries, or Running Water, or Cold Iron, or the sound of Church Bells.  But I'm Puck!'  He brushed the crumbs carefully from his doublet and shook hands.  'We always said, Dan and I,' Una stammered, 'that if it ever happened we'd know ex-actly what to do; but--but now it seems all different somehow.'  'She means meeting a fairy,'said Dan.  'I never believed in 'em--not after I was six, anyhow.'  'I did,' said Una.  'At least, I sort of half believed till we learned \"Farewell, Rewards\".  Do you know \"Farewell, Rewards and Fairies\"?'  'Do you mean this?' said Puck.  He threw his big head back and began at the second line:       'Good housewives now may say,      For now foul sluts in dairies      Do fare as well as they;      And though they sweep their hearths no less  ('Join in, Una!')       Than maids were wont to do,      Yet who of late for cleanliness      Finds sixpence in her shoe?'  The echoes flapped all along the flat meadow. 'Of course I know it,' he said.  'And then there's the verse about the rings,' said Dan. 'When I was little it always made me feel unhappy in my inside.'  \"'Witness those rings and roundelays\", do you mean?' boomed Puck, with a voice like a great church organ.       'Of theirs which yet remain,      Were footed in Queen Mary's days      On many a grassy plain,      But since of late Elizabeth,      And, later, James came in,      Are never seen on any heath      As when the time hath been.  'It's some time since I heard that sung, but there's no good beating about the bush:  it's true.  The People of the Hills have all left.  I saw them come into Old England and I saw them go.  Giants, trolls, kelpies, brownies, goblins, imps; wood, tree, mound, and water spirits; heath-people, hill-watchers, treasure-guards, good people, little people, pishogues, leprechauns, night-riders, pixies, nixies, gnomes, and the rest--gone, all gone!
