Enthuse! Don't you know half the fun in life is enthusiasm?\"  \"What shall I say?\" asked Nan, laughing.  \"Oh, say it's a peach! a hummer! a lallapaloosa!\"  \"Patty, Patty! what language!\"  \"Oh, yes; I forgot I meant to stop using slang. But when any one is so lukewarm in her admiration as you are, forcible language is called for.\"  \"Well, it certainly is a lovely gown, and you never looked prettier. There! since you are fishing for compliments, are you pleased now?\"  Patty was far from being conceited over her pretty face, but she honestly liked admiration, and, indeed, she was accustomed to receive it from all who knew her. At the present moment, she was standing before a long mirror in her boudoir, putting the last touches to her new party toilette. Louise, the maid, stood by, with a fur-trimmed wrap, and Patty drew on her long gloves with a happy smile of anticipation.  \"I just feel sure I'm going to have a good time to-night,\" she said; \"it's a presentiment or premonition, or whatever you call it.\"  \"Don't flirt too desperately,\" said Nan, not without cause, for pretty Petty was by nature a coquette, and as she had many admirers she merrily led them a dance.  \"But it's so interesting to flirt, Nancy. And the boys like it,--so why not?\"  Why not, indeed? thought Nan. Patty's flirtations were harmless, roguish affairs, and prompted by mischief and good nature. Patty was a sweet, true character, and if she teased the young men a bit, it was because of her irrepressible love of fun.  \"And this is St. Valentine's night,\" went on Nan, \"so I suppose you think yourself privileged to break all the hearts you can.\"  \"Some hearts are so brittle, it's no fun to break them,\" returned Patty, carelessly, as she adjusted her headdress.  She was going to a Valentine party, where the guests were requested to come in appropriate costume.  So Patty's gown was of white lace, softly draped with white chiffon. On the modish tunic were love-knots of pale blue velvet, and a border of tiny pink rosebuds. The head-dress, of gold filigree, was a heart pierced by a dart; and on Patty's left shoulder, a dainty little figure of Cupid was wobbling rather uncertainly.  \"You'll lose that little God of War,\" said Nan.  \"I don't care if I do,\" Patty answered; \"he's a nuisance, anyway, but I wanted something Valentinish, so I perched him up there. Now, good-bye, Nancy Dancy, and I expect I'll be out pretty late.\"  \"I shall send Louise for you at twelve, and you must be ready then.\"  \"Oh, make it one. You know a Valentine party is lots of fun.\"  \"Well, half-past twelve,\" agreed Nan, \"and not a minute later!\"  Then Louise wrapped Patty in a light blue evening cloak, edged with white fur, and the happy maiden danced downstairs.  \"Good-bye, Popsy-Poppet,\" she cried, looking in at the library door.  \"Bless my soul! what a vision of beauty!\" and Mr. Fairfield laid down his paper to look at his pretty daughter.  \"Yes,\" she said, demurely, \"everybody tells me I look exactly like my father.\"  \"You flatter yourself!\" said Nan, who had followed, and who now tucked her hand through her husband's arm. \"My Valentine is the handsomest man in the world!\"  \"Oh, you turtle-doves!\" said Patty, laughing, as she ran down the steps to the waiting motor.  Unless going with a chaperon, Patty was always accompanied by the maid, Louise, who either waited for her young mistress in the dressing-room or returned for her when the party was over.  \"Shall you be late, Miss Patty?\" she asked, as they reached their destination.  \"Yes; don't wait for me, Louise. Come back about half-past twelve; I'll be ready soon after that.\"  Louise adored Patty, for she was always kind and considerate of the servants; and she thought Louise might as well have the evening to herself, as to be cooped up in a dressing-room.  The party was at Marie Homer's, a new friend, with whom Patty had but recently become acquainted.  The Homers lived in a large apartment house, called The Wimbledon, and it was Patty's first visit there. Miss Homer and her mother were receiving their guests in a ballroom, and when Patty greeted them, a large crowd had already assembled.  \"You are a true valentine, my dear,\" said Mrs. Homer, looking admiringly at Patty's garlanded gown.  \"And this is a true Valentine party,\" said Patty, as she noted the decorations of red hearts and gold darts, with Cupids of wax or bisque, here and there among the floral ornaments.  Marie Homer, who was a pretty brunette, wore a dress of scarlet and gold, trimmed with hearts and arrows.  \"I'm so glad to have you here,\" she said to Patty; \"for now I know my party will be a success.\"  \"I'm sure your parties always are,\" returned Patty, kindly, for Marie was a shy sort of girl, and Patty was glad to encourage her.  As soon as the guests had all arrived St. Valentine appeared in the doorway.  It was Mr. Homer, but he was scarcely recognisable in his garb of the good old Saint.  He wore a red gown, trimmed with ermine, and a long white beard and wig.  He carried an enormous letter-bag, from which he distributed valentines to all. They were of the old-fashioned lace paper variety, and beautiful of their kind.  Mrs. Homer explained that on the valentine of every young man was a question, and the girl whose valentine had an answer to rhyme with it, was his partner for the first dance.  The young men were requested to read their valentines aloud in turn, and the girls to read their responsive answers.  This proceeding caused much hilarity, for the lines were exceedingly sentimental, and often affectionate.  When it was Roger Farrington's turn, he read out boldly:       \"Where's the girl I love the best?\"  and Marie Homer, who chanced to hold the rhyming valentine, whispered, shyly:       \"I am sweeter than the rest!\"  \"You are, indeed!\" said Roger, as he offered his arm with his courtliest bow.  Then Kenneth Harper read:       \"Who's the fairest girl of all?\"  and Mona Galbraith read, with twinkling eyes:       \"I'll respond to that sweet call!\"  Then it was Philip Van Reypen's turn. He glanced at his valentine, and asked:       \"Who's a roguish little elf?\"  Everybody laughed when a tall, serious-faced girl responded:       \"I guess I am that, myself!\"  It was toward the last that Clifford Morse asked:       \"Who's the dearest girl I know?\"  and as Patty's line rhymed, she said, demurely:       \"Guess I am,--if YOU think so!\"  \"I'm in luck,\" said Clifford, as he led her to the dance. \"You're such a belle, Patty Fairfield, that I seldom get a whole dance with you.\"  \"Faint heart never won fair lady,\" laughed Patty, shaking her fan at him. \"I always accept invitations.\"  \"Accept mine, then, for the next dance,\" said Philip Van Reypen, who overheard her words as he was passing.  \"No programmes to-night,\" returned Patty, smiling at him. \"Ask me at dance time.\"  As no dances could be engaged ahead, except verbally, Patty was besieged by partners for every dance.  \"Oh, dear,\" she cried, as, at the fourth dance, five or six eager young men were bowing before her; \"what shall I do? I'd have to be a centipede to dance with you all! And I can't divide one dance into six parts. And I can't CHOOSE,-that would be TOO embarrassing! Let's draw lots. Lend me a coin, somebody.\"  \"Here you are,\" said Van Reypen, handing her a bright quarter.  Patty took it, and put both hands behind her.  \"You may try first, Phil, because you put up the capital. Right or left?\"  \"Right,\" said Philip, promptly.  Patty gaily brought her hands into view, and the quarter lay in her left palm.  \"Next!\" she said; \"Mr. Downing.\"  \"Left,\" chose that young man, as Patty again concealed her hands.  But that time she showed the coin in her right hand.  \"My turn now,\" said Ken Harper, \"AND, you'll please keep your hands in front of you! You don't do it right.\"  \"Do you mean that I cheat?\" cried Patty, in pretended rage.  \"Oh, no, no! nothing like that! Only, this game is always played with the fists in view.\"  So Patty held her little gloved fists in front of her, while Kenneth chose.  \"Right!\" he said, and her right hand slowly opened and showed the shining coin.  \"Were you going to take me, anyway?\" asked Kenneth, as they walked off together. \"And why did you turn down poor Van Reypen? He was awfully cut up.\"  \"Ken Harper, do you mean to insinuate that I didn't play fair?\"  \"Yes, my lady, just that. Oh, cheating never prospers. You have to put up with me, you see!\"  \"I might do worse,\" and Patty flashed him a saucy glance.  \"I wish you meant that.\"  \"Oh, I do! I DO, Ken. Truly, there are lots of worse people than you in the world.\"  \"Who?\"  \"Well,--there's Eddie Perkins.\"  \"Oh, Patty! that fop! Well, I'll bet you can't think of another.\"  \"No; I can't.\"  \"Patty, how dare you! Then you'll sit right here until you can.\"  Laughingly Kenneth stopped dancing, and led Patty to an alcove where there were a few chairs. As they sat down, Philip Van Reypen came toward them.  \"Oh, Ken,\" Patty cried, \"I've thought"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5631"],["title","Patty's Suitors (#1)"],["body","a man worse than you are! Oh, EVER so much worse! Here he is! And I simply adore bad men, so I'm going to dance with him.\"  Naughty Patty went dancing off with Van Reypen, and Ken looked after them, a little crestfallen.  \"But,\" he thought, \"there's no use being angry or even annoyed at that butterfly of a girl. She doesn't mean anything anyway. Some day, she'll wake up and be serious, but now she's only a little bundle of frivolity.\"  Kenneth had been friends with Patty for many years; far longer than any of her other young men acquaintances. He was honestly fond of her, and had a dawning hope that some time they might be more than friends. But he was a slow-going chap, and he was inclined to wait until he had a little more to offer, before he should woo the pretty butterfly.  And, too, Patty would never listen to a word of that sort of thing. She had often proclaimed in his hearing, that she intended to enjoy several years of gay society pleasures, before she would be engaged to any one.  So Kenneth idly watched her, as she circled the room with Van Reypen, and took himself off to find another partner.  \"Oh, Valentine, fair Valentine,\" said Van Reypen to Patty, as they danced.  \"Wilt thou be mine, and I'lt be thine,\" returned Patty, in mocking sing-song tones.  \"Forever may our hearts entwine,\" improvised Philip, in tune to the music.  \"Like chickwood round a punkin-vine,\" Patty finished.  \"Pshaw, that's not sentimental. You should have said, Like sturdy oak and clinging vine.\"  \"But I'm not sentimental. Who could be in a crowded ballroom, in a glare of light, and in a mad dance?\"  \"What conditions would make you feel sentimental?\"  \"Why,--let me see. Moonlight,--on a balcony,--with the right man.\"  \"I'm the right man, all right,--and you know it. And if I'm not greatly mistaken, here's moonlight and a balcony!\"  Sure enough, a long French window had been set slightly ajar to cool the overheated room, and almost before she knew it, Patty was whisked outside.  \"Oh, Philip! Don't! you mustn't! I'll take cold. I ought to have something around me.\"  \"You have,\" said Van Reypen, calmly, and as he had not yet released her from the dance he held his arms lightly round her shoulders.  Patty was angry. She knew Philip loved her,--several times he had asked her to marry him,--but this was taking an unfair advantage.  The February wind itself was not colder than the manner with which she drew away from him, and stepped back into the ballroom.  \"My dear, my dear,\" exclaimed Mrs. Homer, who chanced to be near, \"how imprudent! You should not go out without a wrap.\"  \"I know it, Mrs. Homer,\" and Patty looked so sweetly penitent that her hostess could but smile at her. \"But, truly, I just stepped out a single second to get a tiny breath of air. The room IS warm, isn't it? May I stay here by you a few moments?\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" and Mrs. Homer drew the girl down beside her on the sofa. \"You're not robust, my child, and you mustn't run foolish risks.\"  \"You're quite right, and I won't do it again. But on a night not quite so cold, that balcony, flooded with moonlight, must be a romantic spot.\"  \"It is, indeed,\" said Mrs. Homer, smiling. \"My young people think so; and I hope you will have many opportunities in the future to see it for yourself.\"  \"Your young people? Have you other children besides Marie?\"  \"Yes; I have a daughter who is away at boarding-school. And, also, I have a nephew, whose home is in this same building.\"  \"Is he here to-night?\"  \"No; Kit hates dances. Of course, that's because he doesn't dance himself. He's a musician.\"  \"Kit? What a funny name.\"  \"It's Christopher, really, Christopher Cameron; but he's such a happy-go-lucky sort of chap, we naturally call him Kit.\"  \"I think I should like him,\" said Patty. \"Would he like me?\"  \"No,\" said Mrs. Homer, her eyes twinkling at Patty's look of amazement. \"He detests girls. Even my daughters, his cousins, are nuisances, he says. Still he likes to come down here and sit on my balcony, and tease them. He lives with his parents in the apartment just above us.\"  \"He sounds an interesting youth,\" said Patty, and then, as Roger came up and asked her for a dance, she promptly forgot the musical nephew.  At supper-time, Patty's crowd of intimates gathered around her, and they occupied a pleasant corner of the dining-room.  \"What'll you have, Patsums?\" asked Roger, as a waiter brought a tray full of dainty viands.  \"Sandwiches and bouillon,\" said Patty, promptly; \"I'm honestly hungry.\"  \"The result of exercise in the open air,\" murmured Philip Van Reypen, as he took a seat directly behind her.  Patty gave an involuntary giggle, and then turned upon Philip what she meant to be an icy glare. He grinned back at her, which made her furious, and she deliberately and ostentatiously ignored him.  \"Hello, you two on the outs?\" inquired Kenneth, casually.  \"Oh, no!\" said Philip, with emphasis; \"far from it!\"  So, as Patty found it impossible to snub such cheerfulness, she concluded to forgive and forget.  \"There's something doing after supper,\" remarked Roger. \"Miss Homer dropped a hint, and even now they're fixing something in the ballroom.\"  \"What can it be?\" said Elise, craning her neck to see through a doorway.  \"It's a game,\" said Marie Homer, who had just joined the group. \"I told mother, you all considered yourselves too grown-up for games, but she said she didn't want to have the whole evening given over to dancing. So you will play it, won't you?\"  \"Sure we will!\" declared Kenneth, who admired the shy little girl.  Marie was new in their set, but they all liked her. She was timid only because she felt unacquainted, and the good-natured crowd did all they could to put her at ease.  \"Games!\" exclaimed Philip; \"why, I just love 'em! I'll play it, whatever it is.\"  \"I too,\" said Patty. \"It will be a jolly change from dancing.\"     CHAPTER II  ON THE TELEPHONE   When the young people returned to the ballroom, it presented a decidedly changed appearance. Instead of an interior scene, it was a winter landscape.  The floor was covered with snow-white canvas, not laid on smoothly, but rumpled over bumps and hillocks, like a real snow field. The numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton, like snow. Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches.  At each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful bear-skin rug.  These rugs were for prizes, one for the girls and one for the boys. And this was the game.  The girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other, and one end was called the North Pole, and the other the South Pole. Each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the Pole.  This would have been an easy matter, but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes. These were not the real thing, but smaller affairs made of pasteboard. But when they were tied on, the wearer felt clumsy indeed, and many of the girls declared they could not walk in them at all. And in addition each one was blindfolded.  However, everybody made an attempt, and at a given signal the young people started from their opposite ends of the room and endeavoured to make progress toward the goal as they blindly stumbled along.  Patty concluded to move very slowly, thinking this the surest way to make a successful trip. So she scuffled along among the other laughing girls, now and then stumbling over a hillock, which was really a hassock or a sofa cushion under the white floor covering. It was great fun, and the girls cheered each other on as they pursued their blinded way. And then about midway of the room they met the boys coming toward them. Then there was scrambling, indeed, as the explorers tried to get out of each other's way and follow their own routes.  It was a very long room, and Patty hadn't gone much more than halfway, when she concluded to give up the race as being too tiresome. She made her way to the side of the room, and reaching the wall she took off her blinding handkerchief and kicked off the snowshoes. To her great surprise she found that many of the other girls and some of the boys had done the same thing, and not half of the original contestants were still in the race. And, indeed, it proved to be much greater fun to watch those who were still blindly groping along, than to stay in the game.  At last the game was concluded, as Roger Farrington proudly planted his flag at the very spot that designated the North Pole, and not long after, Clementine Morse succeeded in safely reaching the South Pole. So the beautiful rugs were given to these two as prizes, and every one agreed that they had earned them.  Then, amid much laughter, everybody was unblindfolded, and they all sat around on the snow mounds waiting for the next game.  A big snow man was brought in and set in the centre of the room. Of course it was not real snow, but made of white plaster, gleaming all over with diamond dust. But it was the traditional type of snow man, with a top hat on, and grotesque features.  In the mouth of the figure was a cigarette, and each guest was presented with a few snowballs, made of cotton wool. The game was to knock the cigarette from the snow man's mouth with one of the snowballs.  Of course the cigarette was so arranged that the lightest touch of a ball would dislodge it, and as one cigarette was displaced, Mr. Homer supplied another.  The guests had been divided into two parties, and each side strove to collect the greater number of cigarettes.  Some balls flew very wide of the mark, while others with unerring aim would hit a cigarette squarely.  The game caused great hilarity, and everybody was anxious to throw balls. They threw in turn, each having three balls at a time.  Patty was especially deft at this, and with true aim succeeded several times.  Then when they tired of this play, a few more dances followed"]]]
