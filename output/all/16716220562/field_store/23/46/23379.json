The condition relating to state banks, while not quite so good on a percentage basis, is showing a steady reduction in the total of frozen deposits--a result much better than we had expected three months ago.  The problem of the credit of the individual was made more difficult because of another fact.  The dollar was a different dollar from the one with which the average debt had been incurred.  For this reason large numbers of people were actually losing possession of and title to their farms and homes.  All of you know the financial steps which have been taken to correct this inequality.  In addition the Home Loan Act, the Farm Loan Act and the Bankruptcy Act were passed.  It was a vital necessity to restore purchasing power by reducing the debt and interest charges upon our people, but while we were helping people to save their credit it was at the same time absolutely essential to do something about the physical needs of hundreds of thousands who were in dire straits at that very moment. Municipal and state aid were being stretched to the limit.  We appropriated half a billion dollars to supplement their efforts and in addition, as you know, we have put 300,000 young men into practical and useful work in our forests and to prevent flood and soil erosion.  The wages they earn are going in greater part to the support of the nearly one million people who constitute their families.  In this same classification we can properly place the great public works program running to a total of over three billion dollars--to be used for highways and ships and flood prevention and inland navigation and thousands of self-sustaining state and municipal improvements.  Two points should be made clear in the allotting and administration of these projects--first, we are using the utmost care to choose labor-creating, quick-acting, useful projects, avoiding the smell of the pork barrel; and secondly, we are hoping that at least half of the money will come back to the government from projects which will pay for themselves over a period of years.  Thus far I have spoken primarily of the foundation stones--the measures that were necessary to reestablish credit and to head people in the opposite direction by preventing distress and providing as much work as possible through governmental agencies. Now I come to the links which will build us a more lasting prosperity.  I have said that we cannot attain that in a nation half boom and half broke.  If all of our people have work and fair wages and fair profits, they can buy the products of their neighbors and business is good.  But if you take away the wages and the profits of half of them, business is only half as good.  It doesn't help much if the fortunate half is very prosperous--the best way is for everybody to be reasonably prosperous.  For many years the two great barriers to a normal prosperity have been low farm prices and the creeping paralysis of unemployment. These factors have cut the purchasing power of the country in half. I promised action.  Congress did its part when it passed the Farm and the Industrial Recovery Acts.  Today we are putting these two acts to work and they will work if people understand their plain objectives.  First the Farm Act:  It is based on the fact that the purchasing power of nearly half our population depends on adequate prices for farm products.  We have been producing more of some crops than we consume or can sell in a depressed world market.  The cure is not to produce so much.  Without our help the farmers cannot get together and cut production, and the Farm Bill gives them a method of bringing their production down to a reasonable level and of obtaining reasonable prices for their crops.  I have clearly stated that this method is in a sense experimental, but so far as we have gone we have reason to believe that it will produce good results.  It is obvious that if we can greatly increase the purchasing power of the tens of millions of our people who make a living from farming and the distribution of farm crops, we will greatly increase the consumption of those goods which are turned out by industry.  That brings me to the final step--bringing back industry along sound lines.  Last Autumn, on several occasions, I expressed my faith that we can make possible by democratic self-discipline in industry general increases in wages and shortening of hours sufficient to enable industry to pay its own workers enough to let those workers buy and use the things that their labor produces.  This can be done only if we permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because it is obvious that without united action a few selfish men in each competitive group will pay starvation wages and insist on long hours of work.  Others in that group must either follow suit or close up shop.  We have seen the result of action of that kind in the continuing descent into the economic Hell of the past four years.  There is a clear way to reverse that process:  If all employers in each competitive group agree to pay their workers the same wages-- reasonable wages--and require the same hours--reasonable hours-- then higher wages and shorter hours will hurt no employer. Moreover, such action is better for the employer than unemployment and low wages, because it makes more buyers for his product.  That is the simple idea which is the very heart of the Industrial Recovery Act.  On the basis of this simple principle of everybody doing things together, we are starting out on this nationwide attack on unemployment.  It will succeed if our people understand it--in the big industries, in the little shops, in the great cities and in the small villages.  There is nothing complicated about it and there is nothing particularly new in the principle.  It goes back to the basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting in a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone could even hope to bring about.  Here is an example.  In the Cotton Textile Code and in other agreements already signed, child labor has been abolished.  That makes me personally happier than any other one thing with which I have been connected since I came to Washington.  In the textile industry--an industry which came to me spontaneously and with a splendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act was signed--child labor was an old evil.  But no employer acting alone was able to wipe it out.  If one employer tried it, or if one state tried it, the costs of operation rose so high that it was impossible to compete with the employers or states which had failed to act.  The moment the Recovery Act was passed, this monstrous thing which neither opinion nor law could reach through years of effort went out in a flash.  As a British editorial put it, we did more under a Code in one day than they in England had been able to do under the common law in eighty-five years of effort.  I use this incident, my friends, not to boast of what has already been done but to point the way to you for even greater cooperative efforts this summer and autumn.  We are not going through another winter like the last.  I doubt if ever any people so bravely and cheerfully endured a season half so bitter.  We cannot ask America to continue to face such needless hardships.  It is time for courageous action, and the Recovery Bill gives us the means to conquer unemployment with exactly the same weapon that we have used to strike down child labor.  The proposition is simply this:  If all employers will act together to shorten hours and raise wages we can put people back to work.  No employer will suffer, because the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same amount for all.  But if any considerable group should lag or shirk, this great opportunity will pass us by and we will go into another desperate winter.  This must not happen.  We have sent out to all employers an agreement which is the result of weeks of consultation.  This agreement checks against the voluntary codes of nearly all the large industries which have already been submitted.  This blanket agreement carries the unanimous approval of the three boards which I have appointed to advise in this, boards representing the great leaders in labor, in industry and in social service.  The agreement has already brought a flood of approval from every state, and from so wide a cross- section of the common calling of industry that I know it is fair for all.  It is a plan--deliberate, reasonable and just--intended to put into effect at once the most important of the broad principles which are being established, industry by industry, through codes. Naturally, it takes a good deal of organizing and a great many hearings and many months, to get these codes perfected and signed, and we cannot wait for all of them to go through.  The blanket agreements, however, which I am sending to every employer will start the wheels turning now, and not six months from now.  There are, of course, men, a few of them who might thwart this great common purpose by seeking selfish advantage.  There are adequate penalties in the law, but I am now asking the cooperation that comes from opinion and from conscience.  These are the only instruments we shall use in this great summer offensive against unemployment.  But we shall use them to the limit to protect the willing from the laggard and to make the plan succeed.  In war, in the gloom of night attack, soldiers wear a bright badge on their shoulders to be sure that comrades do not fire on comrades.  On that principle, those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance.  That is why we have provided a badge of honor for this purpose, a simple design with a legend.  \"We do our part,\" and I ask that all those who join with me shall display that badge prominently.  It is essential to our purpose.  Already all the great, basic industries have come forward willingly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],["title","The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#4)"],["body","proposed codes, and in these codes they accept the principles leading to mass reemployment.  But, important as is this heartening demonstration, the richest field for results is among the small employers, those whose contribution will give new work for from one to ten people.  These smaller employers are indeed a vital part of the backbone of the country, and the success of our plans lies largely in their hands.  Already the telegrams and letters are pouring into the White House--messages from employers who ask that their names be placed on this special Roll of Honor.  They represent great corporations and companies, and partnerships and individuals.  I ask that even before the dates set in the agreements which we have sent out, the employers of the country who have not already done so--the big fellows and the little fellows--shall at once write or telegraph to me personally at the White House, expressing their intention of going through with the plan.  And it is my purpose to keep posted in the post office of every town, a Roll of Honor of all those who join with me.  I want to take this occasion to say to the twenty-four governors who are now in conference in San Francisco, that nothing thus far has helped in strengthening this great movement more than their resolutions adopted at the very outset of their meeting, giving this plan their unanimous and instant approval, and pledging to support it in their states.  To the men and women whose lives have been darkened by the fact or the fear of unemployment, I am justified in saying a word of encouragement because the codes and the agreements already approved, or about to be passed upon, prove that the plan does raise wages, and that it does put people back to work.  You can look on every employer who adopts the plan as one who is doing his part, and those employers deserve well of everyone who works for a living.  It will be clear to you, as it is to me, that while the shirking employer may undersell his competitor, the saving he thus makes is made at the expense of his country's welfare.  While we are making this great common effort there should be no discord and dispute.  This is no time to cavil or to question the standard set by this universal agreement.  It is time for patience and understanding and cooperation.  The workers of this country have rights under this law which cannot be taken from them, and nobody will be permitted to whittle them away, but, on the other hand, no aggression is now necessary to attain those rights.  The whole country will be united to get them for you.  The principle that applies to the employers applies to the workers as well, and I ask you workers to cooperate in the same spirit.  When Andrew Jackson, \"Old Hickory,\" died, someone asked, \"Will he go to Heaven?\" and the answer was, \"He will if he wants to.\"  If I am asked whether the American people will pull themselves out of this depression, I answer, \"They will if they want to.\"  The essence of the plan is a universal limitation of hours of work per week for any individual by common consent, and a universal payment of wages above a minimum, also by common consent.  I cannot guarantee the success of this nationwide plan, but the people of this country can guarantee its success.  I have no faith in \"cure-alls\" but I believe that we can greatly influence economic forces.  I have no sympathy with the professional economists who insist that things must run their course and that human agencies can have no influence on economic ills.  One reason is that I happen to know that professional economists have changed their definition of economic laws every five or ten years for a very long time, but I do have faith, and retain faith, in the strength of common purpose, and in the strength of unified action taken by the American people.  That is why I am describing to you the simple purposes and the solid foundations upon which our program of recovery is built.  That is why I am asking the employers of the nation to sign this common covenant with me--to sign it in the name of patriotism and humanity.  That is why I am asking the workers to go along with us in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness.    October 22,1933.   It is three months since I have talked with the people of this country about our national problems; but during this period many things have happened, and I am glad to say that the major part of them have greatly helped the well-being of the average citizen.  Because, in every step which your government is taking we are thinking in terms of the average of you--in the old words, \"the greatest good to the greatest number\"--we, as reasonable people, cannot expect to bring definite benefits to every person or to every occupation or business, or industry or agriculture.  In the same way, no reasonable person can expect that in this short space of time, during which new machinery had to be not only put to work, but first set up, that every locality in every one of the forty- eight states of the country could share equally and simultaneously in the trend to better times.  The whole picture, however--the average of the whole territory from coast to coast--the average of the whole population of 120,000,000 people--shows to any person willing to look, facts and action of which you and I can be proud.  In the early spring of this year there were actually and proportionately more people out of work in this country than in any other nation in the world.  Fair estimates showed twelve or thirteen millions unemployed last March.  Among those there were, of course, several millions who could be classed as normally unemployed-- people who worked occasionally when they felt like it, and others who preferred not to work at all.  It seems, therefore, fair to say that there were about 10 millions of our citizens who earnestly, and in many cases hungrily, were seeking work and could not get it. Of these, in the short space of a few months, I am convinced that at least 4 millions have been given employment--or, saying it another way, 40 percent of those seeking work have found it.  That does not mean, my friends, that I am satisfied, or that you are satisfied that our work is ended.  We have a long way to go but we are on the way.  How are we constructing the edifice of recovery--the temple which, when completed, will no longer be a temple of money-changers or of beggars, but rather a temple dedicated to and maintained for a greater social justice, a greater welfare for America--the habitation of a sound economic life?  We are building, stone by stone, the columns which will support that habitation.  Those columns are many in number and though, for a moment the progress of one column may disturb the progress on the pillar next to it, the work on all of them must proceed without let or hindrance.  We all know that immediate relief for the unemployed was the first essential of such a structure and that is why I speak first of the fact that three hundred thousand young men have been given employment and are being given employment all through this winter in the Civilian Conservation Corps Camps in almost every part of the nation.  So, too, we have, as you know, expended greater sums in cooperation with states and localities for work relief and home relief than ever before--sums which during the coming winter cannot be lessened for the very simple reason that though several million people have gone back to work, the necessities of those who have not yet obtained work is more severe than at this time last year.  Then we come to the relief that is being given to those who are in danger of losing their farms or their homes.  New machinery had to be set up for farm credit and for home credit in every one of the thirty-one hundred counties of the United States, and every day that passes is saving homes and farms to hundreds of families.  I have publicly asked that foreclosures on farms and chattels and on homes be delayed until every mortgagor in the country shall have had full opportunity to take advantage of federal credit.  I make the further request which many of you know has already been made through the great federal credit organizations that if there is any family in the United States about to lose its home or about to lose its chattels, that family should telegraph at once either to the Farm Credit Administration or the Home Owners Loan Corporation in Washington requesting their help.  Two other great agencies are in full swing.  The Reconstruction Finance Corporation continues to lend large sums to industry and finance with the definite objective of making easy the extending of credit to industry, commerce and finance.  The program of public works in three months has advanced to this point:  Out of a total appropriated for public works of three billion three hundred million, one billion eight hundred million has already been allocated to federal projects of all kinds and literally in every part of the United States and work on these is starting forward.  In addition, three hundred millions have been allocated to public works to be carried out by states, municipalities and private organizations, such as those undertaking slum clearance.  The balance of the public works money, nearly all of it intended for state or local projects, waits only on the presentation of proper projects by the states and localities themselves.  Washington has the money and is waiting for the proper projects to which to allot it.  Another pillar in the making is the Agricultural Adjustment Administration.  I have been amazed by the extraordinary degree of cooperation given to the government by the cotton farmers in the South, the wheat farmers of the West, the tobacco farmers of the Southeast, and I am confident that the corn-hog farmers of the Middle West will come through in the same magnificent fashion.  The problem we seek to solve had been steadily getting worse for twenty years, but during the last six months"]]]
