The town was in a dream, and the warrior trod lightly lest he wake it in affright, for he plainly saw that it had not slumbered long.  No grass grew in the pavement joints; recent footprints were still distinct in the dusty thoroughfares.  The visitor made his way unmolested into work-shops and smithies; tools lay as last used; on the carpenter's bench was the unfinished frame, on the floor were the shavings fresh and odorous; the wood was piled in readiness before the baker's oven; the blacksmith's forge was cold, but the shop looked as though the occupant had just gone off for a holiday.  The gallant soldier entered gardens unchallenged by owner, human guard, or watchful dog; he might have supposed the people hidden or dead in their houses; but the doors were not fastened, and he entered to explore, there were fresh ashes on the hearth; no great accumulation of the dust of time was on floors or furniture; the awful quiet compelled him to tread a-tip-toe as if threading the aisles of an unoccupied cathedral. He hastened to the graveyard, though surely the city had not been depopulated by pestilence.  No; there were a few stones newly set, some sods freshly turned in this sacred acre of God, but where can you find a cemetery of a living town with no such evidence of recent interment?  There were fields of heavy grain, the bounteous harvest rotting on the ground; there were orchards dropping their rich and rosy fruit to spoil beneath; not a hand to gather or save.  But in a suburban corner, he came across the smoldering embers of a barbecue fire, with fragments of flesh and other remnants of a feast.  Hereabout houses had been demolished; and there beyond, around the great temple that had first attracted his attention from the Iowa shore, armed men were bivouacked.  This worthy representative of our country's service was challenged by the drunken crowd, and made to give an account of himself, and to answer for having crossed the river without a permit from the head of the band.  Finding that he was a stranger, they related to him in fiendish glee their recent exploits of pillage, rapine, and murder.  They conducted him through the temple; everywhere were marks of their brutish acts; its altars of prayer were broken; the baptismal font had been so \"diligently desecrated as to render the apartment in which it was contained too noisome to abide in.\"  There in the steeple close by the \"scar of divine wrath\" left by a recent thunderbolt, were broken covers of liquor and drinking vessels.  Sickened with the sight, disgusted with this spectacle of outrage, the colonel recrossed the river at nightfall, beating upward, for the wind had freshened.  Attracted by a faint light near the bank, he approached the spot, there to find a few haggard faces surrounding one who seemed to be in the last stages of fever.  The sufferer was partially protected by something like a tent made from a couple of bed sheets; and amid such environment, the spirit was pluming itself for flight.  Making his way through this camp of misery, he heard the sobbings of children hungry and sick; there were men and women dying from wounds or disease, without a semblance of shelter or other physical comfort; wives in the pangs of maternity, ushering into the world innocent babes doomed to be motherless from their birth.  And at intervals, to the ears of those outcasts, the sick and the dying, the wind brought the soul-piercing sounds of the reveling mob in the distant city, the scrap of vulgar song, the shocking oath, shrieked from the temple tower in the madness of drunken orgies.  This, however, was but the rear remnant of the' expatriated Christian band.  The van was already far on its way toward the inviting wilderness of the all but unknown west.  But the wanderers were not wholly without friends; certain Indian tribes, the Omahas and the Potawatomis, welcomed them to their lands, inviting them to camp within their territory during the coming winter.  \"Welcome,\" said these children of the forest, \"we too have been driven from our pleasant homes east of the great river, to these damp and unhealthful bottoms; you now, white men, have been driven forth to the prairies; we are fellow-sufferers. Welcome, brothers.\"  In return much assistance was rendered by the white refugees to their, shall I say savage friends?  If it was civilization the wanderers had left, then indeed might the red men of the forest have felt proud of their distinction.  But the Indian agent, a Christian gentleman, ordered the \"Mormons\" to move on and leave the reservation which a kind government had provided for its red children.  An order from President Polk, who had been appealed to by Colonel Kane, gave the people permission to remain for a short season.  The government of Iowa had courteously assured them protection while passing through that territory.  As soon as the people were well under way, a thorough organization was effected. Remembering the toilsome desert march from Egypt to Canaan, the people assumed the name, \"Camp of Israel.\"  The camp consisted of two main divisions, and each was sub-divided into companies of hundreds, fifties, and tens, with captains to direct.  An officer with one hundred volunteers went ahead of the main body to select a route and prepare a road.  At this time, there were over one thousand wagons of the \"Mormons\" rolling westward, and the line of march soon reached from the Mississippi to Council Bluffs. There were in the company not half enough draft animals for the arduous march, and but an insufficient number of able-bodied men to tend the camps.  The women had to assist in driving teams and stock, and in other labors of the journey.  Yet with their characteristic cheerfulness the people made the best, and that proved to be a great deal, out of their lot.  When the camp halted, a city seemed to spring as if by magic from the prairie soil.  Concerts and social gatherings were usual features of the evening rests.  But another great event disturbed the equanimity of the camp. War had broken out between Mexico and the United States.  General Taylor's victories in the early stages of the strife had been all but decisive, but the Republic was on march to the western ocean and the provinces of New Mexico and California were in her path. These two provinces comprised in addition to the territory now designated by those names, Utah, Nevada, portions of Wyoming and Colorado, as also Arizona; while Oregon, then claimed by Great Britain, included Washington, Idaho, and portions of Montana and Wyoming.  It was the plan of the national administration to occupy these provinces at the earliest moment possible; and a call was made upon the \"Mormon\" refugees to contribute to the general force by furnishing a battalion of five hundred men to take part in the war with Mexico.  The surprise which the message of the government officer produced in the camp amounted almost to dismay.  Five hundred men fit to bear arms to be drafted from that camp!  What would become of the rest?  Already women and boys had been pressed into service to do the work of men; already the sick and the halt had been neglected; and many graves marked the path they had traversed, whose tenants had passed to their last sleep through lack of care.  But how long did they hesitate?  Scarcely an hour; it was the call of their country.  True, they were even then leaving the national soil, but not of their own will.  To them their country was and is the promised land, the Lord's chosen place, the land of Zion.  \"You shall have your battalion,\" said Brigham Young to Captain Allen, the muster officer, \"and if there are not young men enough, we will take the old men, and if they are not enough, we will take the women.\"  Within a week from the time President Polk's message was received, the entire force, in all five hundred and forty-nine souls, was on the march to Fort Leavenworth.  Their path from the Missouri to the Pacific led them over two thousand miles, much of this distance being measured through deserts, which prior to that time had not been trodden by civilized foot.  Colonel Cooke, the commander of the \"Mormon\" Battalion, declared, \"History may be searched in vain for an equal march of infantry.\" Many were disabled through the severity of the march, and numerous cases of sickness and death were chronicled.  General Kearney and his successor, Governor R. B. Mason, as military commandants of California, spoke in high praise of this organization, and in their official reports declared that they had made efforts to prolong the battalion's term of service; but most of the men chose to rejoin their families as soon as they could secure their honorable discharge.  But to return to the Camp of Israel: A pioneer party, consisting of a hundred and forty and four, preceded the main body; and the line of the migrating hosts soon stretched from the Missouri to the valley of the Great Salt Lake.  Wagons there were, as also some horses and men, but all too few for the journey; and a great part of the company walked the full thousand miles across the great plains and the forbidding deserts of the west.  In the Black Hills region, the pioneers were delayed a week at the Platte, a stream, which, though usually fordable at this point was now so swollen as to make fording impossible.  Here, too, their provisions were well nigh exhausted.  Game had not been plentiful, and the \"Mormon\" pioneers were threatened with the direst privations.  In their slow march they had been passed by a number of well-equipped parties, some of them from Missouri bound for the Pacific; but most of these were overtaken on the easterly side of the river.  Amongst the effects of the \"Mormon\" party was a leathern boat, which on water served the legitimate purpose of its maker and on land was made to do service as a wagon box. This, together with rafts specially constructed, was now "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],["title","The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#6)"],["body","to good use in ferrying across the river not alone themselves and their little property, but the other companies and their loads. For this service they were well paid in camp provisions.  Thus, the expatriated pioneers found themselves relieved from want with their meal sacks replenished in the heart of the wilderness.  Many may call it superstition, but some will regard it as did the thankful travelers--an interposition of Providence, and an answer to their prayers--an event to be compared, they said, to the feeding of Israel with manna in the wilderness of old.  After over three months' journeying, the pioneer company reached the valley of the Great Salt Lake; and at the first sight of it, Brigham Young declared it to be the halting place--the gathering center for the Saints.  But what was there inviting in this wilderness spread out like a scroll barren of inviting message, and empty but for the picture it presented of wondrous scenic grandeur?  Looking from the Wasatch barrier, the colonists gazed upon a scene of entrancing though forbidding beauty.  A barren, arid plain, rimmed by mountains like a literal basin, still occupied in its lowest parts by the dregs of what had once filled it to the brim; no green meadows, not a tree worthy the name, scarce a patch of greensward to entice the adventurous wanderers into the valley.  The slopes were covered with sagebrush, relieved by patches of chaparral oak and squaw-bush; the wild sunflower lent its golden hue to intensify the sharp contrasts. Off to the westward lay the lake, making an impressive, uninviting picture in its severe, unliving beauty; from its blue wastes somber peaks rose as precipitous islands, and about the shores of this dead sea were saline flats that told of the scorching heat and thirsty atmosphere of this parched region.  A turbid river ran from south to north athwart the valley, \"dividing it in twain,\" as a historian of the day has written, \"as if the vast bowl in the intense heat of the Master Potter's fires, in process of formation had cracked asunder.\"  Small streams of water started in rippling haste from the snow-caps of the mountains toward the lake, but most of them were devoured by the thirsty sands of the valley before their journey was half completed.  Such was the scene of desolation that greeted the pioneer band. A more forsaken spot they had not passed in all their wanderings. And is this the promised land?  This is the very place of which Bridger spake when he proffered a thousand dollars in gold for the first bushel of grain that could be raised here.  With such a Canaan spread out before them, was it not wholly pardonable if some did sigh with longing for the leeks and flesh-pots of the Egypt they had left, or wished to pass by this land and seek a fairer home?  Two of the three women who belonged to the party were utterly disappointed.  \"Weak, worn, and weary as I am,\" said one of these heroines, \"I would rather push on another thousand miles than stay here.\"  But the voice of their leader was heard.  \"The very place,\" said Brigham Young, and in his prophetic mind there rose a vision of what was to come.  Not for a moment did he doubt the future.  He saw a multitude of towns and cities, hamlets and villas filling this and neighboring valleys, with the fairest of all, a city whose beauty of situation, whose wealth of resource should become known throughout the world, rising from the most arid site of the burning desert before him, hard by the barren salt shores of the watery waste.  There in the very heart of the parched wilderness should stand the House of the Lord, with other temples in valleys beyond the horizon of his gaze.  Within a few hours after the arrival of the vanguard upon the banks of what is now known as City Creek--the mountain stream which today furnishes Salt Lake City part of her water supply--plows were put to work; but the hard-baked soil, never before disturbed by the efforts of man to till, refused to yield to the share.  A dam was thrown across the stream and the softening liquid was spread upon the flat that had been chosen for the first fields.  The planting season had already well nigh passed, and not a day could be lost.  Potatoes and other seed were put in, and the land was again flooded.  Such was the beginning of the irrigation system, which soon became co-extensive with the area occupied by the \"Mormon\" settlers, a system which under the blessing of Providence, has proved to be the veritable magic touch by which the desert has been made a field of richness and a garden of beauty; a system which now after many decades of successful trial is held up by the nation's wise and great ones to be the one practicable method of reclaiming our country's vast domains of arid lands.  It was on the 24th of July, 1847, that the main part of the pioneer band entered the valley of the Great Salt Lake, and that day of the year is observed as a legal holiday in Utah.  From that time to the present, the stream of immigration to these valleys has never ceased.    CHAPTER IV  The dangers of the first company's migration were surpassed by those of parties who subsequently braved the terrors of the plains.  In their enthusiasm to reach the gathering place of their people, many of the Latter-day Saints set out from Iowa, where railway facilities had their termination, with hand-carts only as a means of conveyance.  Today there are living in the smiling vales of Utah, men and women who then as boys and girls trudged wearily across the prairies, dragging the lumbering carts that contained their entire provision against starvation and freezing.  Such handcart companies were organized with care; a limited amount of freight was allowed to each division; milch cattle and a very few draft-animals, with wagons for conveying the heavier baggage and to carry the sick, were assigned.  The tale of those dreary marches has never yet been told; the song of the heroism and sacrifice displayed by these pilgrims for conscience sake is awaiting a singer worthy the theme.  Wading the streams with carts in tow, or in cases of unfordable streams, stopping to construct rafts; at times living on reduced rations of but a few ounces of meal per day; lying down at night with a prayer in the heart that they wake no more on earth, a prayer which had its fulfilment in hundreds of cases; the dying heaving their parting sighs in the arms of loved ones who were soon to follow, they journeyed on.  The inevitable catastrophes and accidents of travel robbed them of their substance.  Hostile savages stampeded their cattle, or openly attacked and plundered the trains.  But on they went, never swerving from the course.  These later companies needed no chart nor compass to guide them over the desert; the road was plain from the marks of former camps, and yet more so from the graves of friends and loved ones who had started before on the road to the earthly Zion and found that it led them to the martyr's entrance to heaven, graves that were marked perhaps but by a rude inscription cut on a pole or a board.  And even these narrow lodgings had not been left inviolate; the wolves of the plains had too often succeeded in unearthing and rending the bodies.  Every company thus made the course the plainer; each of them added to the silent population of the desert; sometimes half a score were interred at one camp, and of one company over a fourth were thus left beside the prairie road.  Now we traverse the self-same track in a day and a night, reclining on luxurious cushions of ease, covering fifty miles while dining in luxury; and we avert the ennui of the journey by berating the railway company for lack of speed.  Relief trains were continually on the way between the valley of the Salt Lake and the Missouri; and the remnants of many a company were saved from what appeared to be certain destruction by the opportune arrival of these rescuing parties.  Such relief came from those who were themselves destitute and almost starving.  Brigham Young with a few of the chief officials of the Church, and aids, returned eastward on such an errand of rescue within a few weeks after first reaching the valley.  The region to which the early settlers came was in no wise a typical land of promise; it did not flow spontaneously with milk and honey.  Drought and unseasonable frosts made the first year's farming experiments but doubtful successes, and in the succeeding spring the land was visited by the devastating plague of the Rocky Mountain crickets.  They swarmed down in innumerable hordes upon the fields, destroying the growing crops as they advanced, devouring all before them, leaving the land a desert in their track.  The people scarcely knew how to withstand the assault of this new foe; they drove the marauders into trenches there to be drowned or burned; men, women and every child that could swing a stick, were called to the ranks in this insect war; and with all their fighting, the people forgot not to pray for deliverance, and they fasted, too, for the best of reasons.  And as they watched, and prayed, and worked, they saw approaching from the north and west a veritable host of winged creatures of more formidable proportions still; and these bore down upon the fields as though coming to complete the devastation.  But see! these are of the color that betokens peace; they are the gulls, white and beautiful, advancing upon the hosts of the black destroyers.  Falling upon the people's foes, they devoured them by the thousand, and when filled to repletion, disgorged and feasted again.  And they did not stop till the crickets were destroyed.  Again the skeptic will say this was but chance; but the people accepted that chance as a providential ruling in their behalf, and reverently did they give thanks.  Today the wanton killing of a gull in Utah is an offense in law; but stronger than legal proscription, more powerful than fear of judicial penalties, is the popular"]]]
