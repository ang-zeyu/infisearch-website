She was the only one on the programme who received an encore, and to this she replied with one of her favourite canoeing poems.  The following morning the entire press of Toronto asked why this young writer was not on the platform as a professional reader; while two of the dailies even contained editorials on the subject, inquiring why she had never published a volume of her poems, and insisted so strongly that the public should hear more of her, that Mr. Frank Yeigh arranged for her to give an entire evening in Association Hall within two weeks from the date of her first appearance. It was for this first recital that she wrote the poem by which she is best known, \"The Song my Paddle Sings.\"  On this eventful occasion, owing to the natural nervousness which besets a beginner, and to the fact that she had scarcely had time to memorize her new poem, she became confused in this particular member, and forgot her lines. With true Indian impassiveness, however, she never lost her self-control, but smilingly passed over the difficulty by substituting something else; and completely won the hearts of her audience by her coolness and self-possession. The one thought uppermost in her mind, she afterwards said, was that she should not leave the platform and thereby acknowledge her defeat; and it is undoubtedly this same determination to succeed which has carried her successfully through the many years she has been before the public.  The immediate success of this entertainment caused Mr. Yeigh to undertake the management of a series of recitals for her throughout Canada, with the object of enabling her to go to England to submit her poems to a London publisher. Within two years this end was accomplished, and she spent the season of 1894 in London, and had her book of poems, \"The White Wampum,\" accepted by John Lane, of the \"Bodley Head.\" She carried with her letters of introduction from His Excellency the Earl of Aberdeen and Rev. Professor Clark, of Toronto University, which gave her a social and literary standing in London which left nothing to be desired.  In London she met many authors, artists and critics, who gave this young Canadian girl the right hand of fellowship; and she was received and asked to give recitals in the drawing-rooms of many diplomats, critics and members of the nobility.  Her book, \"The White Wampum,\" was enthusiastically received by the critics and press; and was highly praised by such papers as the Edinburgh \"Scotsman,\" \"Glasgow Herald,\" \"Manchester Guardian,\" \"Bristol Mercury,\" \"Yorkshire Post,\" \"The Whitehall Review,\" \"Pall Mall Gazette,\" the London \"Athenaeum,\" the London \"Academy,\" \"Black and White,\" \"Westminster Review,\" etc.  Upon her return to Canada she made her first trip to the Pacific Coast, giving recitals at all the cities and towns en route. Since then she has crossed the Rocky Mountains nineteen times, and appeared as a public entertainer at every city and town between Halifax and Vancouver.  In 1903 the George Morang Publishing Company, of Toronto, brought out her second book of poems, entitled \"Canadian Born,\" which was so well received that the entire edition was exhausted within the year.  About this time she visited Newfoundland, taking with her letters of introduction from Sir Charles Tupper to Sir Robert Bond, the then Prime Minister of the colony. Her recital in St. John was the literary event of the season, and was given under the personal patronage of His Excellency the Governor-General and Lady McCallum, and the Admiral of the British Flagship.  After this recital in the capital Miss Johnson went to all the small seaports and to Hearts' Content, the great Atlantic Cable station, her mission being more to secure material for magazine articles on the staunch Newfoundlanders and their fishing villages than for the purpose of giving recitals.  In 1906 she returned to England, and made her first appearance in Steinway Hall, under the distinguished patronage of Lord and Lady Strathcona, to whom she carried letters of introduction from the Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Prime Minister of Canada. On this occasion she was accompanied by Mr. Walter McRaye, who added greatly to the Canadian interest of the programme by his inimitable renditions of Dr. Drummond's Habitant poems.  The following year she again visited London, returning by way of the United States, where she and Mr. McRaye were engaged by the American Chautauquas for a series of recitals covering eight weeks, during which time they went as far as Boulder, Colorado. Then, after one more tour of Canada, she decided to give up public work, settle down in the city of her choice, Vancouver, British Columbia, and devote herself to literature only.  Only a woman of tremendous powers of endurance could have borne up under the hardships necessarily encountered in travelling through North-Western Canada in pioneer days as Miss Johnson did; and shortly after settling down in Vancouver the exposure and hardship she had endured began to tell upon her, and her health completely broke down. For more than a year she has been an invalid; and as she was not able to attend to the business herself, a trust was formed by some of the leading citizens of her adopted city for the purpose of collecting, and publishing for her benefit, her later works. Among these is a number of beautiful Indian legends which she has been at great pains to collect; and a splendid series of boys' stories, which were exceedingly well received when they ran recently in an American boys' magazine.  During the sixteen years Miss Johnson was travelling she had many varied and interesting experiences. She has driven up the old Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across the Boundary country in British Columbia in the romantic days of the early pioneers; and once she took an 850-mile drive up the Cariboo trail to the gold-fields. She was always an ardent canoeist, ran many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake, and camped in many an unfrequented place. These venturous trips she took more from her inherent love of nature and of adventure than from any necessity of her profession.  After an illness of two years' duration Miss Johnson died in Vancouver on March 7, 1913. The heroic spirit in which she endured long months of suffering is expressed in her poem entitled \"And He Said 'Fight On'\" which she wrote after she was informed by her physician that her illness would prove fatal.    Time and its ally, Dark Disarmament       Have compassed me about;   Have massed their armies, and on battle bent       My forces put to rout,   But though I fight alone, and fall, and die,       Talk terms of Peace? Not I.  It is eminently fitting that this daughter of Nature should have been laid to rest in no urban cemetery. According to her own request she was buried in Stanley Park, Vancouver's beautiful heritage of the forest primeval. A simple stone surrounded by rustic palings marks her grave and on this stone is carved the one word \"Pauline.\" There she lies among ferns and wild flowers a short distance from Siwash Rock, the story of which she has recorded in the legends of her race. In time to come a pathway to her grave will be worn by lovers of Canadian poetry who will regard it as one of the most romantic of our literary shrines.    THE WHITE WAMPUM  (The following poems are from the author's first book, \"The White Wampum,\" first published in 1895.)    OJISTOH   I am Ojistoh, I am she, the wife Of him whose name breathes bravery and life And courage to the tribe that calls him chief. I am Ojistoh, his white star, and he Is land, and lake, and sky--and soul to me.  Ah! but they hated him, those Huron braves, Him who had flung their warriors into graves, Him who had crushed them underneath his heel, Whose arm was iron, and whose heart was steel To all--save me, Ojistoh, chosen wife Of my great Mohawk, white star of his life.  Ah! but they hated him, and councilled long With subtle witchcraft how to work him wrong; How to avenge their dead, and strike him where His pride was highest, and his fame most fair. Their hearts grew weak as women at his name: They dared no war-path since my Mohawk came With ashen bow, and flinten arrow-head To pierce their craven bodies; but their dead Must be avenged. Avenged? They dared not walk In day and meet his deadly tomahawk; They dared not face his fearless scalping knife; So--Niyoh![1]--then they thought of me, his wife.  O! evil, evil face of them they sent With evil Huron speech: \"Would I consent To take of wealth? be queen of all their tribe? Have wampum ermine?\" Back I flung the bribe Into their teeth, and said, \"While I have life Know this--Ojistoh is the Mohawk's wife.\"  Wah! how we struggled! But their arms were strong. They flung me on their pony's back, with thong Round ankle, wrist, and shoulder. Then upleapt The one I hated most: his eye he swept Over my misery, and sneering said, \"Thus, fair Ojistoh, we avenge our dead.\"  And we two rode, rode as a sea wind-chased, I, bound with buckskin to his hated waist, He, sneering, laughing, jeering, while he lashed The horse to foam, as on and on we dashed. Plunging through creek and river, bush and trail, On, on we galloped like a northern gale. At last, his distant Huron fires aflame We saw, and nearer, nearer still we came.  I, bound behind him in the captive's place, Scarcely could see the outline of his face. I smiled, and laid my cheek against his back: \"Loose thou my hands,\" I said. \"This pace let slack. Forget we now that thou and I are foes. I like thee well, and wish to clasp thee close; I like the courage of thine eye and brow; I like thee better than my Mohawk now.\"  He cut the cords; we ceased our maddened haste I wound my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5625"],["title","Flint and Feather: Collected Verse (#3)"],["body"," about his tawny waist; My hand crept up the buckskin of his belt; His knife hilt in my burning palm I felt; One hand caressed his cheek, the other drew The weapon softly--\"I love you, love you,\" I whispered, \"love you as my life.\" And--buried in his back his scalping knife.  Ha! how I rode, rode as a sea wind-chased, Mad with sudden freedom, mad with haste, Back to my Mohawk and my home. I lashed That horse to foam, as on and on I dashed. Plunging thro' creek and river, bush and trail, On, on I galloped like a northern gale. And then my distant Mohawk's fires aflame I saw, as nearer, nearer still I came, My hands all wet, stained with a life's red dye, But pure my soul, pure as those stars on high-- \"My Mohawk's pure white star, Ojistoh, still am I.\"     [1] God, in the Mohawk language.    AS RED MEN DIE   Captive! Is there a hell to him like this? A taunt more galling than the Huron's hiss? He--proud and scornful, he--who laughed at law, He--scion of the deadly Iroquois, He--the bloodthirsty, he--the Mohawk chief, He--who despises pain and sneers at grief, Here in the hated Huron's vicious clutch, That even captive he disdains to touch!  Captive! But _never_ conquered; Mohawk brave Stoops not to be to _any_ man a slave; Least, to the puny tribe his soul abhors, The tribe whose wigwams sprinkle Simcoe's shores. With scowling brow he stands and courage high, Watching with haughty and defiant eye His captors, as they council o'er his fate, Or strive his boldness to intimidate. Then fling they unto him the choice;                                  \"Wilt thou Walk o'er the bed of fire that waits thee now-- Walk with uncovered feet upon the coals, Until thou reach the ghostly Land of Souls, And, with thy Mohawk death-song please our ear? Or wilt thou with the women rest thee here?\" His eyes flash like an eagle's, and his hands Clench at the insult. Like a god he stands. \"Prepare the fire!\" he scornfully demands.  He knoweth not that this same jeering band Will bite the dust--will lick the Mohawk's hand; Will kneel and cower at the Mohawk's feet; Will shrink when Mohawk war drums wildly beat.  His death will be avenged with hideous hate By Iroquois, swift to annihilate His vile detested captors, that now flaunt Their war clubs in his face with sneer and taunt, Not thinking, soon that reeking, red, and raw, Their scalps will deck the belts of Iroquois.  The path of coals outstretches, white with heat, A forest fir's length--ready for his feet. Unflinching as a rock he steps along The burning mass, and sings his wild war song; Sings, as he sang when once he used to roam Throughout the forests of his southern home, Where, down the Genesee, the water roars, Where gentle Mohawk purls between its shores, Songs, that of exploit and of prowess tell; Songs of the Iroquois invincible.  Up the long trail of fire he boasting goes, Dancing a war dance to defy his foes. His flesh is scorched, his muscles burn and shrink, But still he dances to death's awful brink.  The eagle plume that crests his haughty head Will _never_ droop until his heart be dead. Slower and slower yet his footstep swings, Wilder and wilder still his death-song rings, Fiercer and fiercer thro' the forest bounds His voice that leaps to Happier Hunting Grounds. One savage yell--                        Then loyal to his race, He bends to death--but _never_ to disgrace.    THE PILOT OF THE PLAINS   \"False,\" they said, \"thy Pale-face lover, from the land of waking morn; Rise and wed thy Redskin wooer, nobler warrior ne'er was born; Cease thy watching, cease thy dreaming,     Show the white thine Indian scorn.\"  Thus they taunted her, declaring, \"He remembers naught of thee: Likely some white maid he wooeth, far beyond the inland sea.\" But she answered ever kindly,     \"He will come again to me,\"  Till the dusk of Indian summer crept athwart the western skies; But a deeper dusk was burning in her dark and dreaming eyes, As she scanned the rolling prairie,     Where the foothills fall, and rise.  Till the autumn came and vanished, till the season of the rains, Till the western world lay fettered in midwinter's crystal chains, Still she listened for his coming,     Still she watched the distant plains.  Then a night with nor'land tempest, nor'land snows a-swirling fast, Out upon the pathless prairie came the Pale-face through the blast, Calling, calling, \"Yakonwita,     I am coming, love, at last.\"  Hovered night above, about him, dark its wings and cold and dread; Never unto trail or tepee were his straying footsteps led; Till benumbed, he sank, and pillowed     On the drifting snows his head,  Saying, \"O! my Yakonwita call me, call me, be my guide To the lodge beyond the prairie--for I vowed ere winter died I would come again, beloved;     I would claim my Indian bride.\"  \"Yakonwita, Yakonwita!\" Oh, the dreariness that strains Through the voice that calling, quivers, till a whisper but remains, \"Yakonwita, Yakonwita,     I am lost upon the plains.\"  But the Silent Spirit hushed him, lulled him as he cried anew, \"Save me, save me! O! beloved, I am Pale but I am true. Yakonwita, Yakonwita,     I am dying, love, for you.\"  Leagues afar, across the prairie, she had risen from her bed, Roused her kinsmen from their slumber: \"He has come to-night,\" she said. \"I can hear him calling, calling;     But his voice is as the dead.  \"Listen!\" and they sate all silent, while the tempest louder grew, And a spirit-voice called faintly, \"I am dying, love, for you.\" Then they wailed, \"O! Yakonwita.     He was Pale, but he was true.\"  Wrapped she then her ermine round her, stepped without the tepee door, Saying, \"I must follow, follow, though he call for evermore, Yakonwita, Yakonwita;\"     And they never saw her more.  Late at night, say Indian hunters, when the starlight clouds or wanes, Far away they see a maiden, misty as the autumn rains, Guiding with her lamp of moonlight     Hunters lost upon the plains.    THE CATTLE THIEF   They were coming across the prairie, they were     galloping hard and fast; For the eyes of those desperate riders had sighted     their man at last-- Sighted him off to Eastward, where the Cree     encampment lay, Where the cotton woods fringed the river, miles and     miles away. Mistake him? Never! Mistake him? the famous     Eagle Chief! That terror to all the settlers, that desperate Cattle     Thief-- That monstrous, fearless Indian, who lorded it over     the plain, Who thieved and raided, and scouted, who rode like     a hurricane! But they've tracked him across the prairie; they've     followed him hard and fast; For those desperate English settlers have sighted     their man at last.  Up they wheeled to the tepees, all their British     blood aflame, Bent on bullets and bloodshed, bent on bringing     down their game; But they searched in vain for the Cattle Thief: that     lion had left his lair, And they cursed like a troop of demons--for the     women alone were there. \"The sneaking Indian coward,\" they hissed; \"he     hides while yet he can; He'll come in the night for cattle, but he's scared     to face a _man_.\" \"Never!\" and up from the cotton woods rang the     voice of Eagle Chief; And right out into the open stepped, unarmed, the     Cattle Thief. Was that the game they had coveted? Scarce fifty     years had rolled Over that fleshless, hungry frame, starved to the     bone and old; Over that wrinkled, tawny skin, unfed by the     warmth of blood. Over those hungry, hollow eyes that glared for the     sight of food.  He turned, like a hunted lion: \"I know not fear,\"     said he; And the words outleapt from his shrunken lips in     the language of the Cree. \"I'll fight you, white-skins, one by one, till I     kill you _all_,\" he said; But the threat was scarcely uttered, ere a dozen     balls of lead Whizzed through the air about him like a shower     of metal rain, And the gaunt old Indian Cattle Thief dropped     dead on the open plain. And that band of cursing settlers gave one     triumphant yell, And rushed like a pack of demons on the body that     writhed and fell. \"Cut the fiend up into inches, throw his carcass     on the plain; Let the wolves eat the cursed Indian, he'd have     treated us the same.\" A dozen hands responded, a dozen knives gleamed     high, But the first stroke was arrested by a woman's     strange, wild cry. And out into the open, with a courage past     belief, She dashed, and spread her blanket o'er the corpse     of the Cattle Thief; And the words outleapt from her shrunken lips in     the language of the Cree, \"If you mean to touch that body, you must cut     your way through _me_.\" And that band of cursing settlers dropped     backward one by one, For they knew that an Indian woman roused, was     a woman to let alone. And then she raved in a frenzy that they scarcely     understood, Raved of the wrongs she had suffered since her     earliest babyhood: \"Stand back, stand back, you white-skins, touch     that dead man to your shame; You have stolen my father's spirit, but his body I     only claim. You have killed him, but you shall not dare to     touch him now he's dead. You have cursed, and called him a Cattle Thief,     though you robbed him first of bread-- Robbed him and robbed my people--look there, at     that shrunken face, Starved with a hollow hunger, we owe to you and     your race. What have you left to us of land, what have you     left of game, What have you brought but evil, and curses since     you came? How have you paid us for our game? how paid us     for our land? By a _book_, to save our souls from the sins _you_     brought in your other hand. Go back with your new religion, we never have     understood Your robbing an Indian's _body_, and mocking his     _soul_ with food. Go back with your new religion, and find--if find     you can-- The _honest_ man you have ever made from out a     _starving_ man. You say your cattle are not ours, your meat is not     our meat; When _you_ pay"]]]
