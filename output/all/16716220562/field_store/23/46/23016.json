Once only was her solitude in the midst of this great company pleasantly interrupted, for the Bishop of Arras, without troubling himself about the separation of the sexes, had sought her out and whispered that he had something to ask of her, whose details they would discuss later.  On the evening of the day after to-morrow his Majesty's most distinguished guests, with their ladies, were to assemble at his house.  If she desired to place him under the deepest obligations, she would join them there and adorn the festival with her singing.  Barbara asked in a low tone whether the Emperor would also be present, and the statesman, smiling, answered that court etiquette prohibited such things.  Yet it was not impossible that, as a special favour, his Majesty might listen for a short time in the festal hall, only he feared that the gout might interpose--the evil guest was already giving slight warnings of its approach.  Then, without waiting for a reply, the young minister went back to his royal master; but his invitation exerted a disturbing influence upon Barbara.  She would have been more than glad to accept, for the entertainments of the Bishop of Arras were unequalled in varied attractions, magnificence, and gaiety, and what a satisfaction to her ambition it would be to sing before such an audience, dine at the same table with such ladies and gentlemen!  She knew also how heavily this man's favour would weigh in the scales with the Emperor, yet to appear at the banquet without her lover's knowledge was utterly impossible, and just now she felt reluctant to ask his permission.  What heavy chains loaded the favoured woman who possessed the love of this greatest of sovereigns!  However, reflections concerning Granvelle's invitation passed away the time until the lighting of the Lindenplatz was completed.  Then the shrill blare of trumpets again rent the air, the city pipers in the towers struck up a gay march, and the entertainment began.  The gods of Olympus, led by Fame and Fortune, offered their homage to the Emperor.  A youth from the school of poets, attired as the goddess of Fame, bewailed in well-rhymed verses that for a long time no one had given her so much to do as the Emperor Charles.  His comrade, who, bearing a cornucopia in his arms, represented Fortune, assured her companion, in still more bombastic verse, that she should certainly expect far more from her, the goddess of Fame, in favour of his Majesty. This would continue until her own end and that of all the Olympians, because the Emperor Charles himself was an immortal.  He had made them both subject to him.  Fortune as well as Fame must obey his sign.  But there was another younger friend of the gods for whom, on account of the shortness of his life, they had been able to do less, but for whom they also held in readiness their best and greatest gifts.  He, too, would succeed in rendering them his subjects.  While speaking, Fortune pointed with the cornucopia and Fame with the trumpet to Duke Maurice, and besought their indulgent lord and master, the Emperor Charles, to be permitted to show some of their young favourite's possessions, by whose means he, too, would succeed in retaining them in his service.  Then Pallas Athene appeared with the university city of Leipsic, the latter laden with all sorts of symbols of knowledge.  Next came Plutus, the god of Wealth, followed by Freiberg miners bearing large specimens of silver ore in buckets and baskets; and, lastly, Mars, the god of War, leading by a long chain two camels on which rode captive and fettered Turks.  During these spectacles, which were followed by other similar ones, Barbara had been thinking of her own affairs, and gazed more frequently at her lover and his distinguished guests than at the former.  But the next group interested her more because it seemed to honour the Emperor's taste for astronomy, of which he had often talked with her.  On a long cart, drawn by powerful stallions, appeared a gigantic firmament in the shape of a hemisphere, on whose upper surface the sun, moon, and stars were seen shining in radiant light.  The moon passed through all her changes, the sun and planets moved, and from the dome echoed songs and lute-playing, which were intended to represent the music of the spheres.  Another chorus was heard from a basket of flowers of stupendous size.  Among the natural and artificial blossoms sat and lay upon leaves and in the calyxes of the flowers child genii, who flung to the Emperor beautiful bouquets, and into the laps and at the feet of the ladies in the tent smaller ones and single flowers.  Barbara, too, did not go with empty hands.  The Cupid who had thrown his to her was the little Maltese Hannibal, who sang with other boys as \"Voices of the Flowers,\" and later was to take part in the great chorus.  This friendly remembrance of her young fellow-artist cheered Barbara, and when a fight began, which was carried on by a dozen trained champions brought from Strasburg expressly for this purpose, she turned her attention to it.  At first this dealing blows at one another with blunt weapons offered her little amusement; but when shouts from the tent and the stands cheered the men from the Mark, and powerful blows incensed to fury those who were struck, the scene began to enthral her.  A handsome, agile youth, to her sincere regret, had just fallen, but swiftly recovered his elasticity, and, springing to his feet, belaboured his opponent, a clumsy giant, so skilfully and vigorously that the bright blood streamed down his ugly face and big body.  Barbara's cheeks flushed with sympathy.  That was right.  Skill and grace ought everywhere to conquer hideous rude force.  If she had been a man she would have found her greatest happiness, as her father did, in battle, in measuring her own strength with another's.  Now she was obliged to defend herself with other weapons than blunt swords, and when she saw the champions, six against six, again rush upon one another, and one side drive the other back, her vivid imagination transported her into the midst of the victors, and it seemed as if the marquise and the whole throng of arrogant dames in the tent, as well as the Ratisbon women on the stands who had insulted her by their haughty airs of virtue, were fleeing from her presence.  How repulsive these envious, hypocritical people were!  How she hated everything that threatened to estrange her lover's heart!  To them also belonged the scoundrel who, she supposed, had betrayed the sale of the star to the Emperor.  She resolved to confess to Charles how she had been led to commit this offence, which was indeed hard to forgive.  Perhaps all would then be well again, for in this unfortunate action she could recognise the sole wrong which she had ever inflicted upon her lover. She could not help attributing his humiliating manner to it alone, for her love had always remained the same, and only yesterday, after she had sung before the Duke of Saxony, Appenzelder, who never flattered, had assured her that her voice had gained in power, her expression in depth, and she herself felt that it was so.  Music was still the firmest bond that united her to her lover.  So long as her art remained faithful, he could not abandon her.  This conviction was transformed into certainty when the final performance began, and the Ratisbon choir, under the direction of Damian Feys, commenced the mighty hymn with which the composer, Jean Courtois, had greeted the Emperor Charles in Cambray:  \"Venite populi terrai\"--\"Come hither, ye nations of the earth\"--this motet for four voices called imperiously to all mankind like a joyous summons.  \"Ave Cesar, ave majestas sacra,\" sounded in solemn, religious tones the greeting to the greatest of monarchs.  It seemed to transport the listener to the summit of the cathedral, as the choir now called to the ruler that the earth was full of his renown.  The Ratisbon singers and the able Feys did their best, and this mighty act of homage of all the nations of the earth by no means failed to produce its effect upon him to whom it was addressed.  While Barbara listened, deeply agitated, she did not avert her eyes from her lover's face, which was brightly illumined by a pyramid of candles on each side of the two thrones.  Every trace of weariness, indifference, and discomfort had vanished from Charles's features.  His heart, like hers--she knew it--was now throbbing higher.  If he had just been enduring pain, this singing must have driven it away or lessened it, and he had certainly felt gratefully what power dwells in the divine art.  This noble composition, Barbara realized it, would again draw her near her lover, and the confirmation of this hope was not delayed, for as soon as the last notes of the motet and the storm of applause that followed had died away, the Emperor, amid the renewed roar of the artillery, rose and looked around him--surely for her.  The good citizens of Ratisbon!  No matter how much more bunting they had cut up in honour of the Saxon duke than of the Emperor, how bombastic were the verses composed and repeated in praise of Maurice, this paean of homage put all their efforts to shame.  It suited only one, lauded a grandeur and dignity which stood firm as indestructible cliffs, and which no one here possessed save the Emperor Charles.  Who would have ventured to apply this motet to the brave and clever Saxon, high as he, too, towered above most of his peers?  What did the nations of the earth know about him?  How small was the world still that was full of his renown!  This singing had reminded both princes of Barbara, and they looked for her.  The Emperor perceived her first, beckoned kindly to her, and, after conversing with her for a while so"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5566"],["title","Barbara Blomberg — Volume 06 (#8)"],["body","that it aroused the envy of the other ladies in the tent, he said eagerly: \"Not sung amiss for your Ratisbon, I should think.  But how this superb composition was sung six years ago at Catnbray, under the direction of Courtois himself!--that, yes, that is one of the things never to be forgotten.  Thirty-four singers, and what power, what precision, and, moreover, the great charm of novelty!  I have certainly been permitted to hear many things----\"  Here he paused; the Cardinal of Trent was approaching with the Bishop of Arras.  The younger Granvelle, with his father, had also been present at the performance of this motet of homage at Cambray, and respectfully confirmed his Majesty's remark, speaking with special warmth of the fervour and delicacy with which Jean Courtois had conducted the choir.  The cardinal had no wish to detract from the merits of the Netherland maestro, but he called the Emperor's attention to young Orlando di Lasso, the leader of the orchestra in the Lateran at Rome, who, in his opinion, was destined as a composer and conductor to cast into the shade all the musicians of his time.  He was born in Hennegau.  The goddess of Music continued to honour the Netherlands with her special favour.  During this conversation Barbara had stepped modestly aside.  Charles glanced toward her several times to address her again, but when the Bishop of Arras whispered that, before the commencement of the festival, the cardinal had received despatches from the Council and from Rome, he motioned to both prelates to follow him, and, paying no further heed to Barbara--nay, without even vouchsafing her a farewell wave of the hand-- conducted them to the rear of the tent.  Again the girl's heart ached in her abandonment.  Duke Maurice, too, had vanished.  When he saw the Emperor address her he had left the tent.  Dancing had begun, and he was now accepting the invitation of the magistrate Ambrosius Ammann to inaugurate the young people's pleasure as leader of the Polish dance.  For a time Barbara stood as if spellbound to the spot where her lover had so suddenly turned away from her.  She was again experiencing what Adrian had predicted--politics made Charles forget everything else, even love.  How would it be when war actually came?  Now, after the Emperor had showed her that he still deemed her worthy of regard, she felt for the first time thoroughly neglected, and with difficulty restrained her tears.  She would have liked to follow Charles, and at every peril whisper softly, so that he alone could hear, yet with all the sharpness of her resentment, that it was unchivalrous to leave her standing here like an outcast, and that she demanded to learn why she had forfeited his love.  The wild throbbing of her heart impeded her breathing, and, in the indignation of her soul, she longed to escape fresh humiliation and to leave the festival.  But again Baron Malfalconnet appeared as a preserver in the hour of need, and, with the profound submissiveness bordering upon mockery which he always showed her, asked why she had so speedily deprived his Majesty of the pleasure of her society.  Barbara gave way to her wrath and, while vehemently forbidding the unseemly jibe, glanced with a bitter smile toward the Emperor, who, in conversation with the two dignitaries, seemed to have forgotten everything around him.  \"The destiny of the world,\" observed the baron, \"can not be set to dance music.  The domain of your obedient admirer, Malfalconnet, on the contrary, obeys solely the heart throbs in this loyal breast; and if you, fairest of women, will allow yourself to be satisfied with so small a realm of sovereignty, it is at your disposal, together with these tolerably agile feet, which still wait in vain for the well-merited imperial gout.\"  The sharp refusal which this proposition received amused the baron instead of offending him, and passing into a more conversational tone, he proposed to her to leave this abode of ennui, where even the poor satyrs on the hangings were holding their big hands over their mouths to hide their yawns, and go with him to the dancing floor.  Barbara laid her hand on his arm and followed him to the pleasure ground under the lindens, where the pretty daughters of the Ratisbon noble families had just commenced a dance with the gentlemen belonging to their circle.  Barbara had gone to school, exchanged kisses, and was a relative or friend of most of these young girls in light gala dresses, adorned with coloured flowers, whose names Malfalconnet asked, yet, after an interval of these few weeks, she met them like a stranger.  The love which united her to the Emperor had raised her far above them.  Accustomed to give herself up entirely to the gifts which the present offered, she had turned her back on Ratisbon and its inhabitants, with whom, during this period of happiness she could easily dispense, as if they were a forgotten world.  There was no one in her native city whom she seriously missed or to whom she was strongly drawn.  That she, too, offered these people little, and was of small importance, self-love had never permitted her to realize, and therefore she felt an emotion of painful surprise when she perceived the deep gulf which separated her from her fellow-citizens of both sexes.  Now her old friends and acquaintances showed her plainly enough how little they cared for her withdrawal.  Pretty Elspet Zohrer, with whom she had contended for the recruiting officer, Pyramus Kogel, was standing opposite to her, by her partner's side, in the same row with charming little Mietz Schiltl, Anne Mirl Woller, her cousin, Marg Thun, and the others.  The Zauner, which they were dancing with a solemn dignity that aroused the baron's mirth, afforded them an opportunity to look around them, and they eagerly availed themselves of it; nay, they almost all glanced at Barbara, and then, with evident intention, away from her, after Elspet Zohrer, with a contemptuous elevation of her dainty little snub nose, had ignored her schoolmate's greeting.  Barbara drew herself up, and the air of unapproachable dignity which she assumed well suited the aristocratic gentleman at her side, whom every one knew as the most brilliant, witty, and extravagant noble at the Emperor's court.  At the same time she addressed the baron, whom she had hitherto kept at a distance, with unconstrained familiarity, and as the eyes of the mothers also rested upon her, remarks which might have driven the blood to her cheeks were made upon the intimate terms existing between the \"Emperor's sweetheart\" and the profligate and spendthrift Malfalconnet.  True, Barbara could not understand what they were saying, but it was easy enough to perceive in what way they were talking about her.  Yet what gave these women the right to condemn her?  They bore her a grudge because she had distinguished herself by her art, while their little geese were idle at home or, at most, busied themselves in the kitchen, at the spinning wheel, in dancing, and whatever was connected with it while waiting for their future husbands.  The favour which the most illustrious of mortals showed her they imputed to her as a crime.  How could they know that she was more to the Emperor than the artist whose singing enraptured him?  The girls yonder--her Woller cousins certainly--merely held aloof because their mothers commanded them to do it.  Only in the case of a few need she fear that jealousy and envy had taken possession of them.  Yet what did she care for them and their behaviour?  She looked over their heads with the air of a queen.  But what was the meaning of this?  As soon as the dance was over, a pretty young girl, scarcely seventeen years old, with blue forget-me-nots in her fair hair and on her breast, left her partner and came directly toward Barbara.  Her head drooped and she hesitated shyly as she did so, but her modest timidity was so charming that the dissolute courtier at Barbara's side felt a throb of sympathy, and gazed down at her like a benevolent fatherly friend as she held out her hand to his companion.  He did not think Martina Hiltner actually beautiful as she stood close before him, but, on the other hand, inexpressibly charming in her modest grace.  That it was she who came to Barbara so confidingly increased his good opinion of the self-reliant, hot-blooded girl who had won the Emperor's love, and therefore he was deeply angered when the latter answered Martina's greeting curtly and coldly, and, without vouchsafing her any further words, requested him to summon one of the attendants who were serving refreshments.  Malfalconnet glanced significantly toward Martina, and, while offering Barbara a goblet of lemonade, said, \"There is candied lemon and other seasoning in it, so it will probably suit your taste, exacting beauty, since you appear to dislike what is pure.\"  \"Only when poison is mixed with it,\" she answered quickly, tossing her head arrogantly.  Then, controlling herself, she added in an explanatory tone: \"In this case, Baron, your far-famed penetration deceived you.  It gave me more pain than you will believe to reject the friendly advances of this lovely child, but her father is the head of the Lutheran heresy here, and the almoner----\"  \"Then that certainly alters the case,\" the other interrupted.  \"Where the Holy Inquisition threatens, I should be capable of denying a friend thrice ere the cock crew.  But what a number of charming young faces there are on this Lindenplatz!  Here one can understand why Ratisbon, like the French Arles, is famed for the beauty of her daughters.  It was not easy for you to earn the reputation of the greatest beauty here. You have also gained that of the most cruel one.  You make me feel it. But if you wish to cast into oblivion the poisoned cup proffered just now, do me the favour to trust yourself to my guidance in the next dance.\"  \"Impossible,\" answered Barbara firmly.  \"If I were really cruel, I"]]]
