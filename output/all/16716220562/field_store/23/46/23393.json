It was not until nightfall that Dick returned to his uncle's farmhouse.  Here he found that Sam and Tom had already arrived.  Tom was lying on the sofa in the sitting room, being cared for by his Aunt Martha, who was the best of nurses whenever occasion required.  \"Didn't find any trace of the villain?\" queried Randolph Rover, with a sad shake of his head.  \"Too bad!  Too bad!  And it was your father's watch, too!\"  \"I never wanted to see Dick wear it,\" put in Mrs. Rover.  \"It was too fine for a boy.\"  \"Father told me to wear it, aunty.  He said it would remind me of him,\" answered Dick, and he turned away, for something like a tear had welled up in his eye.  \"There, there, Dick, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings,\" cried his aunt hastily.  \"I would give a good deal if you had your watch back.\"  Supper was waiting, but Dick had no appetite, and ate but little. Tom braced up sufficiently to take some toast and tea, and declared that he would be all right by morning and so he was.  \"Here is a letter for Tom from Larry Colby,\" cried Dick during the course, of the evening.  \"I declare, I forgot all about it, Tom, until this minute.\"  \"I don't blame you, Dick,\" was the reply, with a sickly smile. \"You read it for me.  The light hurts my head,\" and Tom closed his eyes to listen.  Larry Colby was a New York lad who in years gone by had been one of Tom's chums.  The letter was just such a one as any boy might write to another, and need have no place here.  Yet one paragraph interested everybody in the sitting room:  \"Next week I am to pack my trunk and go to Putnam Hall Military Academy [wrote Larry Colby].  Father says it is a very fine military, school, and he has recommended it to your uncle.\"  \"Putnam Hall Military Academy!\" mused Tom.  \"I wonder where it is?\"  \"It is over in Seneca County, on Cayuga Lake,\" replied Randolph Rover, and something like a smile appeared on his face.  \"On Cayuga Lake, uncle!\" cried Sam.  \"Why, that's a splendid location, isn't it?\"  \"Very fine.\"  \"And is that where we are to go?\" put in Tom eagerly.  \"Yes, Thomas; I might as well tell you, although I wanted to surprise you.  You are to go to Putnam Hall, and there you will have with you Lawrence Colby, Frank Harrington, and several other lads with whom you are all acquainted.\"  \"Hurrah, Uncle Randolph!\" came from Sam, and rushing up, he caught his relative around the shoulder.  \"You're the best kind of uncle, after all.\"  \"Putnam Hall is an institution of learning that has been established for some twenty years,\" went on Mr. Rover, pushing back his spectacles and laying down the agricultural work he had been perusing.  \"It is presided over by Captain Victor Putnam, an old army officer, who in his younger days used to be a schoolmaster.  He is a strict disciplinarian, and will make you toe the mark; but let me say right here, I have it from Mr. Colby that there is no schoolmaster who is kinder or more considerate of his pupils.\"  \"Is it a regular military institution like West Point?\" asked Tom.  \"Hardly, Thomas, although the students, so I am informed, dress like cadets and spend an hour or so each day in drilling, and in the summer all the school march up the lake and go into an encampment.\"  \"That just suits me!\" broke in Sam enthusiastically.  \"Hurrah for Putnam Hall!\"  \"Hurrah!\" echoed Tom faintly, and Dick nodded to show he felt as they did.  At the cheer, Sarah the cook stuck her head into the door.  \"Sure an' I thought Tom was out of his head, bedad,\" she observed.  \"Sarah, I'm going away soon--to a military academy.  I won't bother you any more,\" said Tom.  \"Won't yez now?  That will be foine.\"  Then the cook stopped short, thinking she had hurt the boy's feelings.  \"Oh, Master Tom, don't moind me.  You're not such an--an awful bother as we think,\" and then at a wave of Mrs. Rover's hand she disappeared.  After this the evening passed quickly enough, for the boys wanted to know all there was to be learned about their future boarding school.  Mr. Rover had a circular of the institution, and they pored over this.  \"Captain Victor Putnam is the head master,\" said Dick, as he read. \"He has two assistants, Josiah Crabtree and George Strong, besides two teachers who come in to give instructions in French and German if desired, also in music.  Uncle Randolph, are we to take up these branches?\"  \"I am going to leave you to select your own studies outside of the regular course, Richard.  What would be the use of taking up music, for instance, if you were not musically inclined.\"  \"I'd like to play a banjo,\" said Tom, and grinned as well as the bandage on his head, would permit.  \"I doubt if the professor of music teaches that plantation instrument,\" smiled Mrs. Rover.  Then she patted Tom's shoulder affectionately.  Now the boys were really to leave her, she was sorry to think of their going.  \"They will not take more than a hundred pupils,\" said Dick, referring to the circular again.  \"I should say that was enough. The pupils are divided into two companies, A and B, of about fifty soldiers each; and the soldiers elect their own officers, to serve during the school term.  Tom, perhaps you may turn out captain of Company B.\"  \"And you may be Major Dick Rover of the first battalion,\" returned Tom.  \"Say, but this suits me to death, Uncle Randolph.\"  \"I am glad to hear it, Thomas.  But I want you to promise me to attend to your studies.  Military matters are all well enough in their way, but I want you to have the benefits of a good education.\"  \"Oh, I fancy Captain Victor Putnam will attend to that,\" put in Sam.  The circular was read from end to end, and it was after ten o'clock before the boys got done talking about it and went to bed. Certainly the prospect was a bright one, and if poor Dick had only had his watch the three would have been in high feather.  Little did they dream, of all the startling adventures in store  for them during their term at Putnam Hall.  It must not be supposed that Mr. Randolph Rover intended to allow the theft of Dick's watch to pass without a strong effort being made to recover the article. Early in the morning he drove to the Corners, and to Oak Run and another village called Bender's, and at each place had a notice posted, mentioning the loss and offering a reward of fifty dollars for the recovery of the property and of one hundred dollars if the thief was captured in addition.  This offer, however, proved of no avail, and Dick had to leave for Putnam Hall wearing his old silver watch, which he had put aside upon the receipt of the gold timepiece.  It was a clear, sun-shiny morning when the boys started off. They had paid a last visit to the various points of interest about the place and bid good-by to Sarah, who shook hands warmly, and said farewell to the hired men, both of whom hated them to leave, for they had made matters pleasant as well as lively. Their three trunks were loaded in a farm wagon, and now Jack, one of the men-of-all-work, drove up with the two seated carriage to drive them over to Oak Run by way of the river bridge, half a mile up the stream.  \"Good-by, Uncle Randolph!\" cried one after another, as they shook hands.  \"Good-by, Aunt Martha!\" and each gave Mrs. Rover a hug and a kiss, something which brought the tears to the lady's eyes.  \"Good-by, boys, and take good care of yourselves,\" said Randolph Rover.  \"And if you can't stand it at boarding school, write, and we will send for you to come back here,\" added his wife; and then, with a crack of the whip, the carriage rolled off, and the farm was left behind.  It was to be many a day before the boys would see the place again.     CHAPTER V  ON THE WAY TO PUTNAM HALL   \"I don't think we'll want to send word to Aunt Martha to be taken back,\" observed Sam, who sat on the driver's seat with the hired man.  \"Neither do I,\" returned Tom. \"To be sure, we have a nice enough home here, but it's dreadfully slow.\"  \"There is no telling what may be in store for us,\" joined in Dick. \"Don't you remember how Fred Garrison fared at Holly School?  That institution sent out a splendid circular, and when Fred got there they almost starved him to death.\"  \"That is true.  Where is Fred now?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Mr. Colby wouldn't recommend Putnam Hall if it wasn't all right,\" remarked Tom.  \"Jack, whip up the team, or we'll miss that train.\"  \"They are going putty well now, Master Tom,\" replied the driver.  The trunks had gone on ahead, and when they reached the depot at Oak Run they found old Ricks grumbling because no one was there to check them.  \"Do you reckon I'm going to be responsible for everybody's baggage?\" he snarled as Dick approached him.  \"I'll check them as soon as I can get tickets,\" answered Dick curtly.  \"What an old bear he is!\" he whispered to Tom.  \"He didn't treat me half decently when I was over here about the watch.\"  \"If only we had a little time I would fix him,\" whispered Tom in return.  He had sobered down for several days now and was dying to play a trick on somebody.  They went into the station and procured tickets, and then found the time for the train had been changed, and it would not be along for nearly half an hour.  \"Good!  Just wait till I get back,\" said Tom.  He had noticed Ricks gathering up some waste paper around the depot, and felt tolerably certain the old fellow was about to build a bonfire of it.  Walking over to one of the stores, he entered, and asked the proprietor if he had any large firecrackers on hand.  \"Just two, sir,\" said the storekeeper, and brought them forth. Each was six inches long and thick in proportion.  \"How much?\" asked the boy.  \"Seeing as they are the last I have, I'll let you have them for fifteen cents each.\"  \"I'll give you a quarter for the two.\"  \"Very well; here you are,\" and the transfer was made on the spot. Slipping the firecrackers into his coat pocket, Tom sauntered up to old Ricks, while Sam and Dick looked on, sure that something was in the wind.  \"Ri"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5780"],["title","The Rover Boys at School; Or, The Cadets of Putnam Hall (#5)"],["body","cks, that is pretty bad news from Middletown, isn't it?\" he observed.  \"Bad news?  What do you mean?\" demanded the station master, as he threw some more waste paper on the fire, which he had just lit.  \"About that dynamite being stolen by train wreckers.  They think some of the explosive was brought up here.\"  \"Didn't hear of it.\"  \"Dynamite is pretty bad stuff to have around, so I've heard.\"  \"Awful!  Awful!  I never want to see any of it,\" answered Ricks, with a decided shake of his head.  \"If it goes off it's apt to blow everything to splinters,\" went on Dick.  \"That's so--I don't want any of it,\" and the old man began to gather up more waste paper for his fire.  Watching his chance, Tom threw one of the firecrackers into the blaze and then rejoined his brothers.  With a handful of paper Ricks again approached the blaze.  He was standing almost over it when the firecracker went off, making a tremendous report and scattering the light blazing paper in all directions.  \"Help!  I'm killed!\" yelled old Ricks, as he fell upon his back. \"Get me away from here!  There's dynamite in this fire!\"  And he rolled over, leapt to his feet, and ran off like a madman.  \"Don't be alarmed--it was only a firecracker,\" called out Tom, loud enough for all standing around to hear, and then he ran for the train, which had just come in.  Soon he and his brothers were on board and off, leaving poor Ricks to be heartily laughed at by those who had observed his sudden terror.  It was many a day before the cranky station master heard the last of his dynamite.  The boys were to ride from Oak Run to Ithaca, and there take a small steamer which ran from that city to the head of the lake, stopping at Cedarville, the nearest village to Putnam Hall.  At Cedarville one of the Hall conveyances was to meet them, to transfer both them and their baggage to the institution.  The run to Ithaca proved uneventful although the boys did not tire of looking out of the window at the beautiful panorama rushing past them.  At noon they had lunch in the dining car, a spread that Sam declared was about as good as a regular dinner.  Three o'clock in the afternoon found them at the steamboat landing, waiting for the Golden Star to take them up to Cedarville.  \"Fred Garrison, by all that's lucky!\" burst out Tom suddenly, as he rushed up to a youth of about his own age who sat on a trunk eating an apple.  \"Tom Rover!  Where are you bound?\"  \"To a boarding school called Putnam Hall.\"  \"You don't say!  Why, I am going there myself,\" and now Fred Garrison nearly wrung off Tom's hand.  \"If this isn't the most glorious news yet!\" burst in Dick.  \"Why, Larry Colby is going too!\"  \"I know it.  But he won't come until tomorrow.\"  \"And Frank Harrington is going too.\"  \"He is there, already--he wrote about it day before yesterday. That makes six of us New York, boys.\"  \"The metropolitan sextet,\" chirped in Sam.  \"Boys, we ought to form a league to stand by each other through thick or thin.\"  \"I'm with you on that,\" answered Fred.  \"As we are all newcomers, it's likely the old scholars will want to haze us, or, something like that.\"  \"Just let them try it on!\" cried Tom.  \"Yes, we must stick together by all means.\" And the compact, so far as it concerned the Rover boys and Fred Garrison, was made on the spot.  Later on Larry Colby and Frank Harrington joined them gladly.  It was not long before the Golden Star, a stanch little side-wheeler, steamed up to the dock, and the waiting crowd rushed on board and secured favorable places on deck. The baggage followed, and soon they were off, with a whistle which awoke the echoes of Cayuga Lake for miles around.  While waiting on the dock Dick had noticed three girls standing near them.  They were evidently from the rural district, but pretty and well dressed.  The boys took seats near the bow of the boat, on the upper deck, and presently the girls sat down not far away.  \"He was awfully bold, Clara; I want nothing to do with him,\" Dick heard the prettiest of the girls say.  \"He had no right to speak to us.\"  \"He had dropped his handkerchief, and he pretended I was stepping on it,\" said another of the three.  \"Oh, here he comes now!\" she went on as a youth of seventeen came into view.  He was large and bold-looking, and it was easy to see that there was a good deal of the bully about him.  He was smoking a cigarette, but on seeing the girls he threw the paper roll away.  \"How do you do again?\" he said, as he came up and tipped his hat.  At this all of the girls looked angry, and not one returned his salutation.  But, undaunted by this, the newcomer caught up a camp stool and planked himself down almost directly between the prettiest of the three and her companions.  \"Splendid day for the trip,\" he went on.  \"Won't you have some confectionery?\" and he hauled from his pocket a box of cream chocolates and held them out.  \"Thank you, but we don't wish any,\" said the youngest of the girls.  \"Won't you have some?\" asked the unknown of the eldest girl.  \"I don't want any, and I told you before not to speak to me!\" she said in a low voice, and the tears almost came into her eyes.  \"I ain't going to hurt you,\" grumbled the young fellow.  \"Can't a fellow be pleasant like?\"  \"I do not know you, sir.\"  \"Oh, that's all right.   My name is Daniel Baxter.  Sorry I haven't a card, or I would give you one,\" was the smooth rejoinder.  \"I do not wish your card,\" was the answer delivered in the most positive of tones.  \"Oh, all right.  Yes, it's a splendid trip,\" said the fellow, and drew his camp chair even closer.  The girls wished to edge away, but there was no room in the narrow bow.  The eldest girl looked around as if for help.  Her eyes met those of Dick, and she blushed.  \"Say, that fellow is a regular pill,\" whispered Tom to his elder brother.  \"Somebody ought to take him by the collar and pitch him overboard.\"  \"You are right, Tom,\" answered Dick, and then as the bully attempted to crowd still closer to the girls he suddenly arose, took a few steps forward, and caught Dan Baxter by the arm.  \"You get out of here and be quick about it,\" he said in low but firm tones.  The fellow started, and for the instant his face changed color. But then he saw that Dick was but a boy, younger and smaller than himself, and his bullying manner returned.  \"Who are you talking to?\" he demanded.  \"I am talking to you.  I told you to get out--and be quick about it.\"  \"Oh,\" cried the eldest girl, but her face took on a look of relief, for she saw that Dick was a thoroughly gentlemanly youth.  \"Who are you anyway?\" blustered Dan Baxter.  \"My name is Dick Rover, if you want, to know.\"  Dick turned to the girls.  \"He was annoying you, wasn't he?\"  \"Very much,\" answered the three promptly.  \"Then you'll get out, Daniel Baxter.\"  \"Supposing I refuse?\"  \"If you refuse, I'll pitch you out, and make a complaint to the police at our first stopping place.\"  \"You talk big!\" sneered the bully, but he was much disconcerted.  \"Don't you talk back to my brother,\" put in Tom, who had come up. \"You think you're a regular masher, as they call such silly fellows, but I don't think your game is going to work here.\"  \"That's it,\" chimed in Sam.  \"Humph! three of you, eh?\" muttered the bully.  \"We'll see about this some other time,\" and leaving his camp chair he made for the cabin and disappeared, from view.  \"He's a bad egg,\" was Tom's comment, but how thoroughly bad the Rover boys were still to learn.     CHAPTER VI  FRIENDS AND ENEMIES   \"I must thank you for ridding us of that fellow,\" said one of the girls.  \"He has annoyed us several times.\"  \"It was a pleasure to assist you,\" answered Dick, with the politeness of a dancing master, and tipped his hat; and his brothers and Fred Garrison did the same.  After this there seemed nothing to do but to be introduced, and Dick did this for the boys, while the eldest girl acted for herself and her companions.  \"My name is Dora Stanhope,\" she said.  \"These are my cousins Nellie and Grace Laning. We live at Cedarville.\"  \"Just the place we are going to!\" cried Tom.  \"We are bound for Putnam Hall.  I suppose you know the place?\"  \"We do--very well,\" answered Dora Stanhope.  \"It is less than quarter of a mile away from our farm.\"  \"And it is quite near to our place too,\" added Nellie Laning.  \"Then perhaps we'll see more of each other,\" remarked Fred Garrison.  \"Perhaps; but isn't Captain Putnam rather strict about letting you boys out?\" questioned, Dora.  \"We don't know yet--we are newcomers.\"  \"Newcomers!\" cried Nellie.  \"Then you don't know that fellow who was just here?\"  \"No.  Does he belong at Putnam Hall?\"  \"Yes.  I know nothing of him, however, further than that I have seen him several times on the Hall road.\"  Dick gave a low whistle.  \"Perhaps we've put our foot in it,\" remarked Sam in a low tone to him.  \"Never mind; we did what was right,\" answered Dick.  \"No fellow is justified in acting as Dan Baxter did.\"  \"That's right.\"  \"Tell us something about Putnam Hall, won't you?\" said Fred Garrison, after a pause.  At this the three girls laughed.  \"What should we know about that place?\" asked Dora.  \"We have never been inside, excepting at one Christmas entertainment.\"  \"But you must see some of the fellows occasionally.\"  \"Not often,\" said Grace Laning.  \"Captain Putnam does not allow his pupils to leave the grounds excepting on special occasions. But papa caught three of the pupils in our strawberry patch once.\"  \"He did?  And what happened to the fellows?\" put in Tom with deep interest.  \"Father made them pick twelve quarts of berries for him for nothing, and didn't let them eat a single one.\"  \"Great Caesar! What a fine fellow your dad--I mean your father--must be.\"  \"Of course he is fine.  The boys had no right to attempt stealing the berries.  My father would have given them some for the asking.\"  \"But they wouldn't have been half as sweet as if they were hooked on the sly,\" said Tom wisely, and everybody laughed.  \"You boys"]]]
