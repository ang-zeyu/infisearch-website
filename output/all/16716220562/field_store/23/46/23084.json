His missus was as soft-hearted a soul as ever lived, and for her to sit unmoved by the weeping of a neglected child was a proof that something was very far wrong indeed.  One or two nasty stories of what tender-hearted women had done when “crazed” by grief haunted him.  The gold seemed to grow hot at the bottom of his pocket. He wished he had got at the stranger’s name and address, in case it should be desirable to annul the bargain.  He wished the missus would cry again, that silence was worse than any thing.  He wished it did not just happen to come into his head that her grandmother went “melancholy mad” when she was left a young widow, and that she had had an uncle in business who died of softening of the brain.  He wished she would move across the room and take up the child, with an intensity that almost amounted to prayer.  And, in the votive spirit which generally comes with such moments, he mentally resolved that, if his missus would but “take to” the infant, he would humor her on all other points just now to the best of his power.  A strange fulfilment often treads on the heels of such vows.  At this moment the wailing of the baby disturbed the miller’s eldest son as he lay in the press-bed.  He was only seven years old, but he had been nurse-boy to his dead sister during the brief period of her health,—the more exclusively so, that the miller’s wife was then weakly,—and had watched by her sick cradle with a grief scarcely less than that of the mother.  He now crept out and down the coverlet to the wailing heap of clothes, with a bright, puzzled look on his chubby face.  “Mother,” he said, “mother!  Is the little un come back?”  “No, no!” she cried.  “That’s not our’n.  It’s—it’s another one.”  “Have the Lord sent us another?” said the boy, lifting the peak of the little hood from the baby’s eye, into which it was hanging, and then fairly gathering the tiny creature, by a great effort, into his arms, with the daring of a child accustomed to playing nurse to one nearly as heavy as himself.  “I do be glad of that, mother.  The Lord sent the other one in the night, too, mother; that night we slept in the round-house.  Do ’ee mind?  Whishty, whishty, love!  Eh, mother, what eyes!  Whishty, whishty, then!  _I’m_ seeing to thee, I am.”  There was something like a sob in the miller’s own throat, but his wife rose, and, running to the bed, fell on her knees, and with such a burst of weeping as is the thaw of bitter grief gathered her eldest child and the little outcast together to her bosom.  At this moment another head was poked up from the bedclothes, and the second child began to say its say, hoping, perhaps, thereby to get a share of attention and kisses as well as the other.  “I seed a lady and genle’m,” it broke forth, “and was feared of un.  They was going out of doors.  The genle’m look back at us, but the lady went right on.  I didn’ see her face.”  Matters were now in a domestic and straightforward condition, and the windmiller no longer hesitated to come in.  But he was less disposed to a hard and triumphant self-satisfaction than was common with him when his will ended well.  A poor and unsuccessful career had, indeed, something to do with the hardness of his nature, and in this flush of prosperity he felt softened, and resolved inwardly to “let the missus take her time,” and come back to her ordinary condition without interference.  “Shall un have a bit of supper, missus?” was his cheerful greeting on coming in.  “But take your time,” he added, seeing her busy with the baby, “take your time.”  By-and-by the nurse-boy took the child, and the woman bustled about the supper.  She was still but half reconciled, and slapped the plates on to the table with a very uncommon irritability.  The windmiller ate a hearty supper and washed it well down with home-made ale, under the satisfactory feeling that he could pay for more when he wanted it.  And as he began to plug his pipe with tobacco, and his wife rocked the new-comer at her breast, he said thoughtfully,—  “Do ’ee think, missus, that woman ’ud be the mother of un?”  “Mother!” cried his wife, scornfully.  “She’ve never been a mother, maester; of this nor any other one.  To see her handle it was enough for me.  The boy himself could see she never so much as looked back at un. To bring an infant out a night like this, too, and leave it with strangers.  Mother, indeed, says he!”  “Take your time, missus, take your time!” murmured the miller in his head.  He did not speak aloud, he only puffed his pipe.  “Do you suppose the genle’m be the father, missus?” he suggested, as he rose to go back to his work.  “Maybe,” said his wife, briefly; “I can’t speak one way or another to the feelings of men-folk.”  This blow was hit straight out, but the windmiller forbore reply.  He was not altogether ill-pleased by it, for the woman’s unwonted peevishness broke down in new tears over the child, whom she bore away to bed, pouring forth over it half inarticulate indignation against its unnatural parents.  “She’ve a soft heart, have the missus,” said the windmiller, thoughtfully, as he went to the outer door.  “I’m in doubts if she won’t take to it more than her own yet.  But she shall have her own time.”  The storm had passed.  The wolds lay glistening and dreary under a watery sky, but all was still.  The windmiller looked upwards mechanically.  To be weatherwise was part of his trade.  But his thoughts were not in the clouds to-night.  He brought the sample bag, without thinking of it, to the surface of his pocket, and dropped it slowly back again, murmuring, “Ten shilling a week.”  And as he turned again to his night’s work he added, with a nod of complete conviction, “It’ll more’n keep _he_.”     CHAPTER III.   THE WINDMILLER’S WORDS COME TRUE.—THE RED SHAWL.—IN THE CLOUDS.—NURSING V. PIG-MINDING.—THE ROUND-HOUSE.—THE MILLER’S THUMB.  STRANGE to say, the windmiller’s idea came true in time,—the foster-child was the favorite.  He was the youngest of the family, for the mother had no more children. This goes for something.  Then, when she had once got over her repugnance to adopting him, he did do much to heal the old grief, and to fill the empty place in her heart as well as in the cradle.  He was a frail, fretful little creature, with a very red face just fading into yellow, about as much golden down on his little pate as would furnish a moth with plumage, and eyes like sloe-berries.  It was fortunate rather than otherwise that he was so ailing for some weeks that the good wife’s anxieties came over again, and, in the triumph of being this time successful, much of the bitterness of the old loss passed away.  In a month’s time he looked healthy, if not absolutely handsome.  The windmiller’s wife, indeed, protested that he was lovely, and she never wearied of marvelling at the unnatural conduct of those who had found it in their hearts to intrust so sweet a child to the care of strangers; though it must be confessed that nothing would have pleased her less than the arrival of two doting and conscientious parents to reclaim him.  Indeed, pity had much to do with the large measure of love that she gave to the deserted child.  A meaner sentiment, too, was not quite without its influence in the predominance which he gradually gained over his foster brothers and sisters.  There was little enough to be proud of in all that could be guessed as to his parentage (the windmiller knew nothing), but there was scope for any amount of fancy; and if the child displayed any better manners or talents than the other children, Mrs. Lake would purse her lips, and say, with a somewhat shabby pride,—  “Anybody may see ’tis gentry born.”  “I’ve been thinking,” said the windmiller, one day, “that if that there woman weren’t the mother, ’tis likely the mother’s dead.”  “’Tis likely, too,” said his wife; and her kindness abounded the more towards the motherless child.  Little Abel was nurse-boy to it, as he had been to his sister.  Not much more than a baby himself, he would wrap an old shawl round the baby who was quite a baby, stagger carefully out at the door, and drop dexterously—baby uppermost—on to the short, dry grass that lay for miles about the mill.  The shawl was a special shawl, though old.  It was red, and the bright color seemed to take the child’s fancy; he was never so good as when playing upon the gay old rag.  His black eyes would sparkle, and his tiny fingers clutch at it, when the mother put it about him as he swayed in Abel’s courageous grasp.  And then Abel would spread it for him, like an eastern prayer carpet, under the shadow of the old mill.  Little need had he of any medicine, when the fresh strong air that blew about the downs was filling his little lungs for most of the day.  Little did he want toys, as he lay on his red shawl gazing upwards hour by hour, with Abel to point out every change in their vast field of view.  It is a part of a windmiller’s trade to study the heavens, and Abel may have inherited a taste for looking skywards.  Then, on these great open downs there is so much sky to be seen, you can hardly help seeing it, and there is not much else to look at.  Had they lived in a village street, or even a lane, Abel and his charge might have taken to other amusements,—to games, to grubbing in hedges, or amid the endless treasures of ditches.  But as it was, they lay hour after hour and looked at the sky, as at an open picture-book with ever-changing leaves.  “Look ’ee here!” the nurse-boy would cry.  “See to the crows, the pretty black crows!  Eh, there be a lapwing!  Lap-py, lap-py, lap-py, there he go!  Janny catch un!”             [Picture: “Look ’ee here!” the nurse-boy would cry]  And the baby would stretch his arms responsive to Abel’s expressive signs, and cry aloud for the vanishing bird.

Janny mind un!  So! so!”  And if some small gray scud, floating lower, ran past the far-away cirrus, Abel would add with a quaint seriousness, “’Tis the sheep-dog. How he runs then!  Bow-wow!”  At sunset such a flock wore golden fleeces, and to them, and to the crimson hues about them, the little Jan stretched his fingers, and crowed, as if he would have clutched the western sky as he clutched his own red shawl.  But Abel was better pleased when, in the dusk, the flock became dark gray.  “They be Master Salter’s pigs now,” said he.  For pigs in Abel’s native place were both plentiful and black; and he had herded Master Salter’s flock (five and twenty black, and three spotted) for a whole month before his services were required as nurse-boy to his sister.  But for the coming of the new baby, he would probably have gone back to the pigs.  And he preferred babies.  A baby demands attention as well as a herd of pigs, but you can get it home.  It does not run off in twenty-eight different directions, just when you think you have safely turned the corner into the village.  Master Salter’s swine suffered neglect at the hands of several successors to the office Abel had held, and Master Salter—whilst alluding to these in indignant terms as “young varments,” “gallus-birds,” and so forth—was pleased to express his regret that the gentle and trustworthy Abel had given up pig-minding for nursing.  The pigs’ loss was the baby’s gain.  No tenderer or more careful nurse could the little Jan have had.  And he throve apace.  The windmiller took more notice of him than he had been wont to do of his own children in their babyhood.  He had never been a playful or indulgent father, but he now watched with considerable interest the child who, all unconsciously, was bringing in so much “grist to the mill.”  When the weather was not fine enough for them to be out of doors, Abel would play with his charge in the round-house, and the windmiller never drove him out of the mill, as at one time he would have done.  Now and then, too, he would pat the little Jan’s head, and bestow a word of praise on his careful guardian.  It may be well, by-the-by, to explain what a round-house is.  Some of the brick or tower mills widen gradually and evenly to the base.  Others widen abruptly at the lowest story, which stands out all round at the bottom of the mill, and has a roof running all round too.  The projection is, in fact, an additional passage, encircling the bottom story of the windmill.  It is the round-house.  If you take a pill-box to represent the basement floor of a tower-mill, and then put another pill-box two or three sizes larger over it, you have got the circular passage between the two boxes, and have added a round-house to the mill.  The round-house is commonly used as a kind of store-room.  Abel Lake’s windmill had no separate dwelling-house.  His grandfather had built the windmill, and even his father had left it to the son to add a dwelling-house, when he should perhaps have extended his resources by a bit of farming or some other business, such as windmillers often add to their trade proper.  But that calamity of the broken sails had left Abel Lake no power for further outlay for many years, and he had to be content to live in the mill.  The dwelling-room was the inner part of the basement floor.  Near the door which led from this into the round-house was the ladder leading to the next story, and close by that the opening through which the sacks of grain were drawn up above.  The story above the basement held the millstones and the “smutting” machine, for cleaning dirty wheat.  The next above that held the dressing machine, in which the bran was separated from the flour.  In the next above that were the corn-bins.  To the next above that the grain was drawn up from the basement in the first instance.  The top story of all held the machinery connected with the turning of the sails.  Ladders led from story to story, and each room had two windows on opposite sides of the mill.  Use is second nature, and all the sounds which haunt a windmill were soon as familiar and as pleasant to the little Jan as if he had been born a windmiller’s son.  Through many a windy night he slept as soundly as a sailor in a breeze which might disturb the nerves of a land-lubber.  And when the north wind blew keen and steadily, and the chains jangled as the sacks of grist went upwards, and the millstones ground their monotonous music above his head, these sounds were only as a lullaby to his slumbers, and disturbed him no more than they troubled his foster-mother, to whom the revolving stones ground out a homely and welcome measure: “Dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread, dai-ly bread.”  For another sign of his being a true child of the mill, his nurse Abel anxiously watched.  Though Abel preferred nursing to pig-minding, he had a higher ambition yet, which was to begin his career as a windmiller.  It was not likely that he could be of use to his father for a year or two, and the fact that he was of very great use to his mother naturally tended to delay his promotion to the mill.  Mrs. Lake was never allowed to say no to her husband, and she seemed to be unable, and was certainly unwilling, to say it to her children. Happily, her eldest child was of so sweet and docile a temper that spoiling did him little harm; but even with him her inability to say no got the mother into difficulties.  She was obliged to invent excuses to “fub off,” when she could neither consent nor refuse.  So, when Abel used to cling about her, crying, “Mother dear, when’ll I be put t’help father in the mill?  Do ’ee ask un to let me come in now!  I be able to sweep ’s well as Gearge.  I sweeps the room for thee,”—she had not the heart or the courage to say, “I want thee, and thy father doesn’t,” but she would take the boy’s hand tenderly in hers, and making believe to examine his thumbs with a purpose, would reply, “Wait a bit, love.  Thee’s a sprack boy, and a good un, but thee’s not rightly got the miller’s thumb.”  And thus it came about that Abel was for ever sifting bits of flour through his finger and thumb, to obtain the required flatness and delicacy which marks the latter in a miller born; and playing lovingly with little Jan on the floor of the round-house, he would pass some through the baby’s fingers also, crying,—  “Sift un, Janny! sift un!  Thee’s a miller’s lad, and thee must have a miller’s thumb.”     CHAPTER IV.   BLACK AS SLANS.—VAIR AND VOOLISH.—THE MILLER AND HIS MAN.  IT was a great and important time to Abel when Jan learned to walk; but, as he was neither precocious nor behindhand in this respect, his biographer may be pardoned for not dwelling on it at any length.  He had a charming demure little face, chiefly differing from the faces of the other children of the district by an overwhelming superiority in the matter of forehead.  Mrs. Lake had had great hopes that he would differ in another respect also.  Most of the children of the neighborhood were fair.  Not fair as so many North-country children are, with locks of differing, but equally brilliant, shades of gold, auburn, red, and bronze; but white-headed, and often white-faced, with white-lashed inexpressive eyes, as if they had been bleaching through several generations.  Now, when the dark bright eyes of the little Jan first came to be of tender interest with Mrs. Lake, she fully hoped, and constantly prophesied, that he would be “as black as a rook;” a style of complexion to which she gave a distinct preference, though the miller was fair by nature as well as white by trade.  Jan’s eyes seemed conclusive.  “Black as slans they be,” said his foster-mother.  And slans meant sloe-berries where Mrs. Lake was born.  An old local saying had something perhaps to do with her views:—      “Lang and lazy,        Black and proud;     Vair and voolish,        Little and loud.”  “Fair and foolish” youngsters certainly abounded in the neighborhood to an extent which justified a wish for a change.  As to pride, meek Mrs. Lake was far from regarding it as a failing in those who had any thing to be proud of, such as black hair and a possible connection with the gentry.  And fate having denied to her any chance of being proud or aggressive on her own account, she derived a curious sort of second-hand satisfaction from seeing these qualities in those who belonged to her.  It did to some extent console her for the miller’s roughness to herself, to hear him rating George.  And she got a sort of reflected dignity out of being able to say, “My maester’s a man as will have his way.”  But her hopes were not realized.  That yellow into which the beefsteak stage of Jan’s infant complexion had faded was not destined to deepen into gipsy hues.  It gave place to the tints of the China rose, and all the wind and sunshine on the downs could not tan, though they sometimes burnt, his cheeks.  The hair on his little head became more abundant, but it kept its golden hue.  His eyes remained dark,—a curious mixture; for as to hair and complexion he was irredeemably fair.  The mill had at least one “vair and voolish” inmate, by common account, though by his own (given in confidence to intimate friends) he was “not zuch a vool as he looked.”  This was George Sannel, the miller’s man.  Master Lake had had a second hand in to help on that stormy night when Jan made his first appearance at the mill; but as a rule he only kept one man, whom he hired for a year at a time, at the mop or hiring fair held yearly in the next town.  George, or Gearge as he was commonly called, had been more than two years in the windmill, and was looked upon in all respects as “one of the"]]]
