This would be embarrassing, for it would make an investigation necessary.  “Oh, no,” answered Philip, smiling; “that never came into my mind.”  “I don’t mind bringin’ you up your supper for once,” said Tucker. “Of course, I can’t do it reg’lar, but this is the first night.”  “I suppose I shall be better able to make my escape if I eat,” thought Philip. “Probably the most sensible thing is to accept this offer.”  “How much are you to get for my board, Mr. Tucker?” he asked.  “Only sixty cents,” grumbled Tucker. “It ain’t enough, but the town won’t pay any more. You’ve no idea what appetites them paupers has.”  “You made a mistake when you agreed to take me,” said Philip gravely. “I’m very hearty, you’ll be sure to lose money on me.”  Mr. Tucker looked uneasy.  “Well, you see I expect to have you earn part of your board by doin’ chores,” he said, after a pause.  “That will give me a good chance to run away,” remarked Philip calmly. “You’ll have to let me out of this room to work, you know.”  “You wouldn’t dare to run away!” said Tucker, trying to frighten Philip by a blustering manner.  “That shows you don’t know me, Mr. Tucker!” returned our hero. “I give you fair warning that I shall run away the first chance I get.”  Philip’s tone was so calm and free from excitement that Mr. Tucker could not help seeing that he was in earnest, and he looked perplexed.  “You don’t look at it in the right light,” he said, condescending to conciliate his new boarder. “If you don’t make no trouble, you’ll have a good time, and I’ll let you off, now an’ then, to play with Zeke. He needs a boy to play with.”  Philip smiled, for the offer did not attract him very much.  “You are very kind,” he said, “but I don’t think that even that will reconcile me to staying here with you. But, if you’ll agree to let me pay you for the supper, you may bring me up some.”  “The town will pay me,” said Tucker.  “That’s just what I don’t want the town to do,” said Philip quickly. “I will make you an offer. At sixty cents a week the meals for one day will not cost over ten cents. I’ll pay you ten cents for supper and breakfast.”  “You’re a cur’us boy,” said Tucker. “You want to pay for your vittles in a free boardin’-house.”  “It isn’t free to me. At any rate, I don’t want it to be. What do you say?”  “Oh, I ain’t no objections to take your money,” said Tucker, laughing. “I didn’t know you was so rich.”  “I am not rich, but I think I can pay my board as long as I stay here.”  This Philip said because he had decided that his stay should be a very brief one.  “Just as you say!” chuckled Mr. Tucker.  As he went downstairs he reflected:  “I can take the boy’s money and charge his board to the town, too. There’s nothin’ to hender, and it’ll be so much more in my pocket. I wish the rest of the paupers would foller his example.”  He went downstairs and explained to Mrs. Tucker that he wanted Philip’s supper.  “Tell him to come down to the table like the rest of the folks!” retorted Mrs. Tucker. “He ain’t too lazy, is he?”  “No; but it’s safer to keep him in his room for the first twenty-four hours. He’s a desperate boy, but I reckon he’ll get tamed after a while.”  “I’ll desperate him!” said Mrs. Tucker scornfully. “I don’t believe in humorin’ him.”  “Nor I, Abigail. He’d like to come down, but I won’t let him. We can manage him between us.”  “I should smile if we couldn’t,” said Mrs. Tucker. “If you want any supper for him, you can get it yourself. I’ve got too much to do. No, Widder Jones, you can’t have another cup of tea, and you needn’t beg for it. One cup’s plenty for you, and it’s all we can afford.”  “Only this once,” pleaded the poor old woman. “I’ve got a headache.”  “Then another cup of tea would only make it worse. If you’ve got through your supper, go back to your seat and give more room for the rest.”  While Mrs. Tucker was badgering and domineering over her regular boarders, her husband put two slices of dry bread on a plate, poured out a cup of tea, not strong enough to keep the most delicate child awake, and surreptitiously provided an extra luxury in the shape of a thin slice of cold meat. He felt that, as he was to receive double price, he ought to deal generously by our hero.  He carried this luxurious supper to the third story, and set it down before Philip.  Philip promptly produced a dime, which Mr. Tucker pocketed with satisfaction. He waited till his young guest had finished his repast, in order himself to carry down the dishes.  There was no butter for the bread, and the tea had been sweetened scantily. However, Philip had the appetite of a healthy boy, and he ate and drank everything that had been provided.  “I’ll be up in the morning,” said Mr. Tucker. “We go to bed early here. The paupers go to roost at seven, and me and my wife and Zeke at eight. You’d better go to bed early, too.”     CHAPTER XIII. A FRIENDLY MISSION.   Philip was glad to hear that all in the almshouse went to bed so early. He had not yet given up the hope of escaping that night, though he had as yet arranged no definite plan of escape.  Meanwhile, he had an active friend outside. I refer, of course, to Frank Dunbar. Frank had no sooner heard of his friend’s captivity than he instantly determined, if it were a possible thing, to help him to escape.  He would not even wait till the next day, but determined after it was dark to visit the poor-house and reconnoiter. First, he informed his parents what had befallen Phil. Their indignation was scarcely less than his.  “Squire Pope is carrying matters with a high hand,” said the farmer. “According to my idea, he has done no less than kidnap Philip, without the shadow of a legal right.”  “Can’t he be prosecuted?” asked Frank eagerly.  “I am not sure as to that,” answered his father, “but I am confident that Philip will not be obliged to remain, unless he chooses, a dependent upon the charity of the town.”  “It is outrageous!” said Mrs. Dunbar, who was quite as friendly to Philip as her husband and son.  “In my opinion,” said Mr. Dunbar, “Squire Pope has done a very unwise thing as regards his own interests. He desires to remain in office, and the people will not be likely to reelect him if his policy is to make paupers of those who wish to maintain themselves. Voters will be apt to think that they are sufficiently taxed already for the support of those who are actually unable to maintain themselves.”  “If I were a voter,” exclaimed Frank indignantly, “I wouldn’t vote for Squire Pope, even for dog-catcher! The meanest part of it is the underhanded way in which he has taken Phil. He must have known he was acting illegally, or he would have come here in open day and required Phil to go with him.”  “I agree with you, Frank. Squire Pope may be assured that he has lost my vote from henceforth. Hitherto I have voted for him annually for selectman, knowing that he wanted the office and considering him fairly faithful.”  “Father,” said Frank, after a thoughtful pause, “do you think Philip would be justified in escaping from the poorhouse?”  “I do,” answered Mr. Dunbar. “In this free country I hold that no one ought to be made an object of charity against his will.”  “Philip is strong enough and smart enough to earn his own living,” said Frank.  “That is true. I will myself give him his board and clothes if he will stay with me and work on the farm.”  “I wish he would. He would be a splendid companion for me; but I think he wants to leave Norton, and try his fortune in some larger place.”  “I can’t blame him. If his father were living and he had a good home, I should not think it wise; but, as matters stand, it may not be a bad plan for him.”  “Father,” said Frank, after supper, “I am going out and I may not be back very early.”  “Are you going to see Philip?”  “Yes; but I want to see him alone. If possible, I will see him without attracting the attention of Joe Tucker.”  “You won’t get into any trouble, Frank?” said his mother anxiously.  “No, mother; I don’t know what trouble I can get into.”  “You may very likely fail to see Philip,” suggested his father. “I hear that Tucker and his boarders go to bed very early.”  “So much the better!” said Frank, in a tone of satisfaction. “The only one I want to see is Philip, and he isn’t likely to go to sleep very early.”  Mr. Dunbar smiled to himself.  “Frank has got some plan in his head,” he thought. “I won’t inquire what it is, for he has good common sense, and won’t do anything improper.”  About eight o’clock, Frank, after certain preparations, which will hereafter be referred to, set out for the poorhouse, which was about a mile distant.     CHAPTER XIV. PHILIP MAKES HIS ESCAPE.   It grew darker and darker in Philip’s chamber, but no one came to bring him a light. It was assumed that he would go to bed before he required one.  By seven o’clock the paupers had settled themselves for the night, and when eight o’clock struck, Mr. and Mrs. Tucker sought their beds. It was no particular trial for Joe Tucker to go to bed early, for he was naturally a lazy man, and fond of rest; while his wife, who worked a great deal harder than he, after being on her feet from four o’clock in the morning, found it a welcome relief to lie down and court friendly sleep. Zeke wasn’t always ready to go to bed. In fact, he would much rather have gone up to the village now and then, but if he had done so he would have had to stay out all night. There was one thing his parents were strict about, and that was retiring at eight o’clock.  Philip, however, did not retire at that hour. It was earlier than his usual hour for bed. Besides, he was in hopes his friend Frank would make his appearance, and help him, though he didn’t exactly understand how, to make his escape.  At half-past eight it was dark. The stars were out, and the moon was just making its appearance. Philip had opened his window softly, and was looking out, when all at once he saw a boyish"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5674"],["title","Hector's Inheritance, Or, the Boys of Smith Institute (#0)"],["body","HECTOR’S INHERITANCE  OR  THE BOYS OF SMITH INSTITUTE   By Horatio Alger, Jr.  Author of “Eric Train Boy” “Young Acrobat,” “Only an Irish Boy,” “Bound to Rise,” “The Young Outlaw,” “Driven from Home” etc.  NEW YORK      HECTOR’S INHERITANCE.     CHAPTER I. MR. ROSCOE RECEIVES TWO LETTERS.    Mr. Roscoe rang the bell, and, in answer, a servant entered the library, where he sat before a large and commodious desk.  “Has the mail yet arrived?” he asked.  “Yes, sir; John has just come back from the village.”  “Go at once and bring me the letters and papers, if there are any.”  John bowed and withdrew.  Mr. Roscoe walked to the window, and looked thoughtfully out upon a smooth, luxuriant lawn and an avenue of magnificent trees, through which carriages were driven to what was popularly known as Castle Roscoe. Everything, even to the luxuriously appointed room in which he sat, indicated wealth and the ease which comes from affluence.  Mr. Roscoe looked around him with exultation.  “And all this may be mine,” he said to himself, “if I am only bold. What is it old Pindar says? ‘Boldness is the beginning of victory.’ I have forgotten nearly all I learned in school, but I remember that. There is some risk, perhaps, but not much, and I owe something to my son---”  He was interrupted by the entrance of the servant with a small leather bag, which was used to hold mail matter, going from or coming to the house.  The servant unlocked the bag, and emptied the contents on the desk. There were three or four papers and two letters. It was the last which attracted Mr. Roscoe’s attention.  We will take the liberty of looking over Mr. Roscoe’s shoulder as he reads the first. It ran as follows:  “DEAR SIR:-I am in receipt of your favor, asking my terms for boarding pupils. For pupils of fifteen or over, I charge five hundred dollars per year, which is not a large sum considering the exceptional advantages presented by Inglewood School. My pupils are from the best families, and enjoy a liberal table. Moreover, I employ competent teachers, and guarantee rapid progress, when the student is of good, natural capacity, and willing to work.  “I think you will agree with me that it is unwise to economize when the proper training of a youth is in question, and that a cheap school is little better than no school at all.  “I have only to add that I shall be most happy to receive your young nephew, if you decide to send him to me, and will take personal pains to promote his advancement. I remain, dear sir, your obedient servant,  “DIONYSIUS KADIX.”  Mr. Roscoe threw the letter down upon the desk with an impatient gesture.  “Five hundred dollars a year!” he exclaimed. “What can the man be thinking of? Why, when I went to school, twenty-five years since, less than half this sum was charged. The man is evidently rapacious. Let me see what this other letter says.”  The second letter was contained in a yellow envelope, of cheap texture, and was much more plebeian in appearance than the first.  Again we will look over Mr. Roscoe’s shoulder, and read what it contains. It was postmarked Smithville, and the envelope was disfigured by a blot. It commenced:  “DEAR SIR:-It gives me pleasure to answer your inquiries respecting my school. I have about fifty pupils, part of whom, say one-third, are boarders. Though I say it myself, it will be hard to find any school where more thorough instruction is given. I look upon my pupils as my children, and treat them as such. My system of government is, therefore, kind and parental, and my pupils are often homesick in vacation, longing for the time to come when they can return to their studies at Smith Institute. It is the dearest wish of Mrs. Smith and myself to make our young charges happy, and to advance them, by pleasant roads over flowery meads, to the inner courts of knowledge.  “Humbug!” muttered Mr. Roscoe. “I understand what all that means.” He continued:  “I hope you will not consider three hundred dollars per annum too much for such parental care. Considering the present high price of provisions, it is really as low a price as we can afford to receive.  “I shall be glad if you consider my letter favorable and decide to place your nephew under my charge. Yours respectfully,  “SOCRATES SMITH, A. M.”  “That is more reasonable,” said Mr. Roscoe, to himself, as he laid down the letter. “Three hundred dollars I consider a fair price. At any rate, I do not propose to pay any more for Hector. I suppose the table is plain enough, but I don’t believe in pampering the appetites of boys. If he were the master of Roscoe Hall, as he thinks he is, there might be some propriety in it; but upon that head I shall soon undeceive him. I will let him understand that I am the proprietor of the estate, and that he is only a dependent on my bounty. I wonder how he will take it. I dare say he will make a fuss, but he shall soon be made to understand that it is of no use. Now to answer these letters.”  Mr. Roscoe sat down in a luxurious armchair, and, drawing pen and paper toward him, wrote first to Dr. Radix. I subjoin the letter, as it throws some light upon the character of the writer:  “ROSCOE HALL, Sept. 10th. DR. DIONYSIUS RADIX.  “My DEAR SIR:-I am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, answering my inquiries in regard to your school. Let me say at once that I find your terms too high. Five hundred dollars a year for forty weeks’ board and schooling seems to me an exorbitant price to ask. Really, at this rate, education will soon become a luxury open only to the wealthy.  “You are probably under a misapprehension in reference to my young ward. Nephew he is not, in a strict sense of the term. He was adopted--not legally, but practically--by my brother, when he was only a year old, and his origin has been concealed from him. My brother, being childless, has allowed him to suppose that he was his own son. Undoubtedly he meant to provide for him in his will, but, as often happens, put off will-making till it was too late. The estate, therefore, goes to me, and the boy is unprovided for. This does not so much matter, since I am willing to educate him, and give him a fair start in life, if he acts in a manner to suit me. I do not, however, feel called upon to pay an exorbitant price for his tuition, and, therefore, shall be obliged to forego placing him at Inglewood School. Yours, etc.,  “ALLAN ROSCOE.”  “When this letter is sent, I shall have taken the decisive step,”  thought Mr. Roscoe. “I must then adhere to my story, at whatever cost. Now for the other.”  His reply to the letter of Socrates Smith, A. M., was briefer, but likely to be more satisfactory to the recipient. It ran thus;  “SOCRATES SMITH, A. M.  “DEAR Sir:-Your letter is at hand, and I find it, on the whole, satisfactory. The price you charge-three hundred dollars per annum--is about right. I hope you are a firm disciplinarian. I do not want Hector too much indulged or pampered, though he may expect it, my poor brother having been indulgent to excess.  “Let me add, by the bye, that Hector is not my nephew, though I may inadvertently have mentioned him as such, and had no real claims upon my brother, though he has been brought up in that belief. He was adopted, in an informal way, by my brother, when he was but, an infant. Under the circumstances, I am willing to take care of him, and prepare him to earn his own living when his education is completed.  “You may expect to see me early next week. I will bring the boy with me, and enter him at once as a pupil in your school.  “Yours, etc., ALLAN ROSCOE.”  “There, that clinches it!” said Mr. Roscoe, in a tone of satisfaction. “Now for an interview with the boy.”     CHAPTER II. RESENTING AN INSULT.    A stone’s throw from the mansion was a neat and spacious carriage house. The late master of Castle Roscoe had been fond of driving, and kept three horses and two carriages. One of the latter was an old-fashioned coach; while there was, besides, a light buggy, which Hector was accustomed to consider his own. It was he, generally, who used this, for his father preferred to take a driver, and generally took an airing, either alone or with Hector, in the more stately carriage, drawn by two horses.  Hector walked across the lawn and entered the carriage house, where Edward, the coachman, was washing the carriage. As the former is to be our hero, we may pause to describe him.  He was fifteen, slenderly but strongly made, with a clear skin and dark eyes and a straightforward look. He had a winning smile, that attracted all who saw it, but his face could assume a different expression if need be. There were strong lines about his mouth that indicated calm resolution and strength of purpose. He was not a boy who would permit himself to be imposed upon, but was properly tenacious of his rights.  As he entered the carriage house, he looked about him in some surprise.  “Where is the buggy, Edward?” he asked.  “Master Guy is driving out in it.”  “How is that?” said Hector. “Doesn’t he know that it is mine? He might, at least, have asked whether I intended to use it.”  “That is what I told him.”  “And what did he say?”  “That it was just as much his as yours, and perhaps more so.”  “What could he mean?”  “He said his father had promised to give it to him.”  “Promised to give him my buggy!” exclaimed Hector, his eyes flashing.  “It’s a shame, Master Hector, so it is,” said Edward, sympathetically. He had known Hector since he was a boy of five, and liked him far better than Guy, who was a newcomer, and a boy disposed to domineer over those whom he considered his inferiors.  “I don’t intend to submit to it,” said Hector, trying, ineffectually, to curb his anger.  “I don’t blame you, Master Hector, but I’m afraid you will have a hard time. As your uncle is your guardian, of course he has power over you, and he thinks everything of that boy of his, though, to my mind, he is an unmannerly cub.”  “I don’t know how much power he has over "]]]
