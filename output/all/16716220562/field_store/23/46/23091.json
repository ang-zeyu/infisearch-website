The extreme actual distance from side to side through which the upper part of the hypocotyl passed in the course of 14½ hours was only 1/60 of an inch; it sometimes travelled at the rate of 1/50 of an inch in an hour.  Cucurbita ovifera (Cucurbitaceæ).—Radicle: a seed which had germinated on damp sand was fixed so that the slightly curved radicle, which was only .07 inch in length, stood almost vertically upwards, in which position geotropism would act at first with little power. A filament was attached near to its base, and projected at about an angle of 45° above the horizon. The general course followed during the 11 hours of observation and during the following night is shown in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 26), and was plainly due to geotropism; but it was also clear that the radicle circumnutated. By the next morning the tip had curved so much downwards that the filament, instead of projecting at 45° above the horizon, was nearly horizontal. Another germinating seed was turned upside down and covered with damp sand; and a filament was fastened to the radicle so as to project at an angle of about 50° above the horizon; this radicle was .35 of an inch in length and a little curved. The course pursued was mainly governed, as in the last case, by geotropism, but the line traced during 12 hours and magnified as before was more strongly zigzag, again showing circumnutation.  Fig. 26. Cucurbita ovifera: course followed by a radicle in bending geotropically downwards, traced on a horizontal glass, between 11.25 A.M. and 10.25 P.M.; the direction during the night is indicated by the broken line. Movement of bead magnified 14 times.  Four radicles were allowed to grow downwards over plates of smoked glass, inclined at 70° to the horizon, under the same conditions as in the cases of Æsculus, Phaseolus, and Vicia. Facsimiles are here given (Fig. 27) of two of these tracks; and a third short one was almost as plainly serpentine as that at A. It was also manifest by a greater or less amount of soot having been swept off the glasses, that the tips had pressed alternately with greater and less force on them. There must, therefore, have been movement in at least two planes at right angles to one another. These radicles were so delicate that they rarely had the power to sweep the glasses quite clean. One of them had developed some lateral or secondary rootlets, which projected a few degrees beneath the horizon; and it is an important fact that three of them left distinctly serpentine tracks on the smoked surface, showing beyond doubt that they had circumnutated like the main or primary radicle. But the tracks were so slight that they could not be traced and copied after the smoked surface had been varnished.  Fig. 27. Cucurbita ovifera: tracks left by tips of radicles in growing downwards over smoked glass-plates, inclined at 70° to the horizon.  Fig. 28. Cucurbita ovifera: circumnutation of arched hypocotyl at a very early age, traced in darkness on a horizontal glass, from 8 A.M. to 10.20 A.M. on the following day. The movement of the bead magnified 20 times, here reduced to one-half of original scale.  Fig. 29. Cucurbita ovifera: circumnutation of straight and vertical hypocotyl, with filament fastened transversely across its upper end, traced in darkness on a horizontal glass, from 8.30 A.M. to 8.30 P.M. The movement of the terminal bead originally magnified about 18 times, here only 4½ times.  Hypocotyl.—A seed lying on damp sand was firmly fixed by two crossed wires and by its own growing radicle. The cotyledons were still enclosed within the seed-coats; and the short hypocotyl, between the summit of the radicle and the cotyledons, was as yet only slightly arched. A filament (.85 of inch in length) was attached at an angle of 35° above the horizon to the side of the arch adjoining the cotyledons. This part would ultimately form the upper end of the hypocotyl, after it had grown straight and vertical. Had the seed been properly planted, the hypocotyl at this stage of growth would have been deeply buried beneath the surface. The course followed by the bead of the filament is shown in Fig. 28. The chief lines of movement from left to right in the figure were parallel to the plane of the two united cotyledons and of the flattened seed; and this movement would aid in dragging them out of the seed-coats, which are held down by a special structure hereafter to be described. The movement at right angles to the above lines was due to the arched hypocotyl becoming more arched as it increased in height. The foregoing observations apply to the leg of the arch next to the cotyledons, but the other leg adjoining the radicle likewise circumnutated at an equally early age.  The movement of the same hypocotyl after it had become straight and vertical, but with the cotyledons only partially expanded, is shown in Fig. 29. The course pursued during 12 h. apparently represents four and a half ellipses or ovals, with the longer axis of the first at nearly right angles to that of the others. The longer axes of all were oblique to a line joining the opposite cotyledons. The actual extreme distance from side to side over which the summit of the tall hypocotyl passed in the course of 12 h. was .28 of an inch. The original figure was traced on a large scale, and from the obliquity of the line of view the outer parts of the diagram are much exaggerated.  Cotyledons.—On two occasions the movements of the cotyledons were traced on a vertical glass, and as the ascending and descending lines did not quite coincide, very narrow ellipses were formed; they therefore circumnutated. Whilst young they rise vertically up at night, but their tips always remain reflexed; on the following morning they sink down again. With a seedling kept in complete darkness they moved in the same manner, for they sank from 8.45 A.M. to 4.30 P.M.; they then began to rise and remained close together until 10 P.M., when they were last observed. At 7 A.M. on the following morning they were as much expanded as at any hour on the previous day. The cotyledons of another young seedling, exposed to the light, were fully open for the first time on a certain day, but were found completely closed at 7 A.M. on the following morning. They soon began to expand again, and continued doing so till about 5 P.M.; they then began to rise, and by 10.30 P.M. stood vertically and were almost closed. At 7 A.M. on the third morning they were nearly vertical, and again expanded during the day; on the fourth morning they were not closed, yet they opened a little in the course of the day and rose a little on the following night. By this time a minute true leaf had become developed. Another seedling, still older, bearing a well-developed leaf, had a sharp rigid filament affixed to one of its cotyledons (85 mm. in length), which recorded its own movements on a revolving drum with smoked paper. The observations were made in the hot-house, where the plant had lived, so that there was no change in temperature or light. The record commenced at 11 A.M. on February 18th; and from this hour till 3 P.M. the cotyledon fell; it then rose rapidly till 9 P.M., then very gradually till 3 A.M. February 19th, after which hour it sank gradually till 4.30 P.M.; but the downward movement was interrupted by one slight rise or oscillation about 1.30 P.M. After 4.30 P.M. (19th) the cotyledon rose till 1 A.M. (in the night of February 20th) and then sank very gradually till 9.30 A.M., when our observations ceased. The amount of movement was greater on the 18th than on the 19th or on the morning of the 20th.  Cucurbita aurantia.—An arched hypocotyl was found buried a little beneath the surface of the soil; and in order to prevent it straightening itself quickly, when relieved from the surrounding pressure of the soil, the two legs of the arch were tied together. The seed was then lightly covered with loose damp earth. A filament with a bead at the end was affixed to the basal leg, the movements of which were observed during two days in the usual manner. On the first day the arch moved in a zigzag line towards the side of the basal leg. On the next day, by which time the dependent cotyledons had been dragged above the surface of the soil, the tied arch changed its course greatly nine times in the course of 14½ h. It swept a large, extremely irregular, circular figure, returning at night to nearly the same spot whence it had started early in the morning. The line was so strongly zigzag that it apparently represented five ellipses, with their longer axes pointing in various directions. With respect to the periodical movements of the cotyledons, those of several young seedlings formed together at 4 P.M. an angle of about 60°, and at 10 P.M. their lower parts stood vertically and were in contact; their tips, however, as is usual in the genus, were permanently reflexed. These cotyledons, at 7 A.M. on the following morning, were again well expanded.  Lagenaria vulgaris (var. miniature Bottle-gourd) (Cucurbitaceæ).—A seedling opened its cotyledons, the movements of which were alone observed, slightly on June 27th and closed them at night: next day, at noon (28th), they included an angle of 53°, and at 10 P.M. they were in close contact, so that each had risen 26½°. At noon, on the 29th, they included an angle of 118°, and at 10 P.M. an angle of 54°, so each had risen 32°. On the following day they were still more open, and the nocturnal rise was greater, but the angles were not measured. Two other seedlings were observed, and behaved during three days in a closely similar manner. The cotyledons, therefore, open more and more on each succeeding day, and rise each night about 30°; consequently during the first two nights of their life they stand vertically and come into contact.

Guns of the Gods    Out of the Ashes  Old Troy reaped rue in the womb of years For stolen Helen's sake; Till tenfold retribution rears Its wreck on embers slaked with tears That mended no heart-ache. The wail of the women sold as slaves Lest Troy breed sons again Dreed o'er a desert of nameless graves, The heaps and the hills that are Trojan graves Deep-runneled by the rain.  But Troy lives on. Though Helen's rape And ten-year hold were vain; Though jealous gods with men conspire And Furies blast the Grecian fire; Yet Troy must rise again. Troy's daughters were a spoil and sport, Were limbs for a labor gang, Who crooned by foreign loom and mill Of Trojan loves they cherished still, Till Homer heard, and sang,  They told, by the fire when feasters roared And minstrels waited turns, Of the might of the men that Troy adored, Of the valor in vain of the Trojan sword, With the love that slakeless burns, That caught and blazed in the minstrel mind Or ever the age of pen. So maids and a minstrel rebuilt Troy, Out of the ashes they rebuilt Troy To live in the hearts of men.     Yasmini    \"Set down my thoughts not yours if the tale is to be worth the pesa.\"  The why and wherefore of my privilege to write a true account of the Princess Yasmini's early youth is a story in itself too long to tell here; but it came about through no peculiar wisdom.  I fell in a sort of way in love with her, and that led to opportunity.  She never made any secret of the scorn with which she regards those who singe wings at her flame.  Rather she boasts of it with limit-overreaching epithets.  Her respect is reserved for those rare men and women who can meet her in unfair fight and, if not defeat her, then come close to it.  She asks no concessions on account of sex.  Men's passions are but weapons forged for her necessity;  and as for genuine love-affairs, like Cleopatra, she had but two, and the second ended in disaster to herself.  This tale is of the first one that succeeded, although fraught with discontent for certain others.  The second affair came close to whelming thrones, and I wrote of that in another book with an understanding due, as I have said, to opportunity, and with a measure of respect that pleased her.  She is habitually prompt and generous with her rewards, if far-seeing in bestowal of them.  So, during the days of her short political eclipse that followed in a palace that had housed a hundred kings, I saw her almost daily in a room--her holy of holies--where the gods of ancient India were depicted in three primal colors working miracles all over the walls and where, if governments had only known it, she was already again devising plans to set the world on fire.  There, amid an atmosphere of Indian scents and cigarette smoke, she talked and I made endless notes, while now and then, when she was meditative, her maids sang to an accompaniment of rather melancholy wooden flutes.  But whenever I showed a tendency to muse she grew indignant.  \"Of what mud are you building castles now?  Set down my thoughts not yours,\" she insisted, \"if your tale is to be worth the pesa.\"  By that she referred to the custom of all Eastern story-tellers to stop at the exciting moment and take up a collection of the country's smallest copper coins before finishing the tale.  But the reference was double-edged. A penny for my thoughts, a penny for the West's interpretation of the East was what she had in mind.  Nevertheless, as it is to the West that the story must appeal it has seemed wiser to remove it from her lips and so transpose that, though it loses in lore unfortunately, it does gain something of directness and simplicity. Her satire, and most of her metaphor if always set down as she phrased it, would scandalize as well as puzzle Western ears.  This tale is of her youth, but Yasmini's years have not yet done more than ripen her.  In a land where most women shrivel into early age she continues, somewhere perhaps a little after thirty, in the bloom of health and loveliness, younger in looks and energy than many a Western girl of twenty-five.  For she is of the East and West, very terribly endowed with all the charms of either and the brains of both.  Her quick wit can detect or invent mercurial Asian subterfuge as swiftly as appraise the rather glacial drift of Western thought;  and the wisdom of both East and West combines in her to teach a very nearly total incredulity in human virtue.  Western morals she regards as humbug, neither more nor less.  In virtue itself she believes, as astronomers for example believe in the precession of the equinox;  but that the rank and file of human beings, and especially learned human beings, have attained to the very vaguest understanding of it she scornfully disbelieves.  And with a frankness simply Gallic in its freedom from those thought-conventions with which so many people like to deceive themselves she deals with human nature on what she considers are its merits.  The result is sometimes very disconcerting to the pompous and all the rest of the host of self-deceived, but usually amusing to herself and often profitable to her friends.  Her ancestry is worth considering, since to that she doubtless owes a good proportion of her beauty and ability.  On her father's side she is Rajput, tracing her lineage so far back that it becomes lost at last in fabulous legends of the Moon (who is masculine, by the way, in Indian mythology).  All of the great families of Rajputana are her kin, and all the chivalry and derring-do of that royal land of heroines and heroes is part of her conscious heritage.  Her mother was Russian.  On that side, too, she can claim blood royal, not devoid of at least a trace of Scandinavian, betrayed by glittering golden hair and eyes that are sometimes the color of sky seen over Himalayan peaks, sometimes of the deep lake water in the valleys.  But very often her eyes seem so full of fire and their color is so baffling that a legend has gained currency to the effect that she can change their hue at will.  How a Russian princess came to marry a Rajput king is easier to understand if one recalls the sinister designs of Russian statecraft in the days when India and \"warm sea-water\" was the great objective.  The oldest, and surely the easiest, means of a perplexed diplomacy has been to send a woman to undermine the policy of courts or steal the very consciences of kings.  Delilah is a case in point.  And in India, where the veil and the rustling curtain and religion hide woman's hand without in the least suppressing her, that was a plan too easy of contrivance to be overlooked.  In those days there was a prince in Moscow whose public conduct so embittered his young wife, and so notoriously, that when he was found one morning murdered in his bed suspicion rested upon her.  She was tried in secret, as the custom was, found guilty and condemned to death. Then, on the strength of influence too strong for the czar, the sentence was commuted to the far more cruel one of life imprisonment in the Siberian mines.  While she awaited the dreaded march across Asia in chains a certain proposal was made to the Princess Sonia Omanoff, and no one who knew anything about it wondered that she accepted without much hesitation.  Less than a month after her arrest she was already in Paris, squandering paper rubles in the fashionable shops.  And at the Russian Embassy in Paris she made the acquaintance of the very first of the smaller Indian potentates who made the \"grand tour.\"  Traveling abroad has since become rather fashionable, and is even encouraged by the British-Indian Government because there is no longer any plausible means of preventing it; but Maharajah Bubru Singh was a pioneer, who dared greatly, and had his way even against the objections of a high commissioner.  In addition he had had to defy the Brahman priests who, all unwilling, are the strong supports of alien overrule;  for they are armed with the iron-fanged laws of caste that forbid crossing the sea, among innumerable other things.  Perhaps there was a hint of moral bravery behind the warrior eyes that was enough in itself and she really fell in love at first sight, as men said. But the secret police of Russia were at her elbow, too, hinting that only one course could save her from extradition and Siberian mines.  At any rate she listened to the Rajah's wooing;  and the knowledge that he had a wife at home already, a little past her prime perhaps and therefore"]]]
