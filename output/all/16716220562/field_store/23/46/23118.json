However, I have no objection to answering you. I shall lay it up.”  “For what purpose? I need not tell you that money, in itself, is of no value. It is only the representative of value. Why, then, do you allow it to remain idle?”  “How else should I employ it? I have a comfortable house well furnished: should I purchase one more expensive? My table is well provided: should I live more luxuriously? My wardrobe is well supplied: should I dress more expensively?”  “To these questions I answer, No. But it does not follow, because you have a good house, comfortable clothing, and a well-supplied table, that others are equally well provided. Have you thought to give of your abundance to those who are needy,—to promote your own happiness by advancing that of others?”  “I must confess that this is a duty which I have neglected. But there are alms-houses and benevolent societies. There cannot be much misery that escapes their notice,” said Mr. Hathaway.  “You shall judge for yourself.”  The stranger commenced unwrapping the package which he carried under his arm. It was a small mirror, with a veil hanging before it. He slowly withdrew the veil, and said, “Look!”  A change passed over the surface of the mirror. Mr. Hathaway, as he looked at it intently, found that it reflected a small room, scantily furnished; while a fire flickered in the grate. A bed stood in one corner of the room, on which reposed a sick man. By the side of it sat a woman, with a thin shawl over her shoulders, busily plying her needle. An infant boy lay in a cradle not far off, which a little girl called Alice, whose wasted form and features spoke of want and privation, was rocking to sleep.  “Would you hear what they are saying?” asked the stranger.  The merchant nodded acquiescence. Immediately there came to his ear the confused noise of voices, from which he soon distinguished that of the sick man, who asked for some food.  “We have none in the house,” said his wife. “But I shall soon get this work finished; and then I shall be able to get some.”  The husband groaned: “Oh that I should be obliged to remain idle on a sick bed, when I might be earning money for you and the children! The doctor says, that, now the fever has gone, I need nothing but nourishing food to raise me up again. But, alas! I see no means of procuring it. Would that some rich man, out of his abundance, would supply me with but a trifle from his board! To him it would be nothing; to me, every thing.”  The scene vanished; and gradually another formed itself upon the surface of the mirror.  It was a small room, neatly but not expensively furnished. There were two occupants,—a man of middle age, and a youth of a bright, intellectual countenance, which at present seemed overspread with an air of dejection.  Mr. Hathaway, to his surprise, recognized in the gentleman Mark Audley, a fellow-merchant and formerly intimate friend, who, but a few months before, had failed in business, and, too honorable to defraud his creditors, had given up all his property. Since his failure, he had been reduced to accept a clerkship.  “I am sorry, Arthur,” said he to his son, “very sorry, that I could not carry out my intention of entering you at college. I know your tastes have always led you to think of a professional career; but my sudden change of circumstances has placed it out of my power to gratify you. It is best for you to accept the situation which has been offered you, and enter Mr. Bellamy’s store. It is a very fair situation, and will suit you as well as any.”  “I believe you are right, sir,” said Arthur, respectfully; “though it will be hard to resign the hopes that I have so long cherished. I met Henry Fulham to-day. He was in my class at school, and is to enter college next fall. I couldn’t help envying him. How soon will Mr. Bellamy wish me to enter his store?”  “Day after to-morrow, I believe,—that is, with the beginning of the year; New Year’s Day being considered a holiday.”  “Very well; you may tell him that I will come at that time.”  The scene vanished as before. A change passed over the surface of the mirror. Again the merchant looked, and, to his surprise, beheld the interior of his own store. A faint light was burning, by the light of which a young man, whom he recognized as Frank Durell, one of his own clerks, was reading a letter, the contents of which seemed to agitate him powerfully.  The scene was brought so near, that he could, without difficulty, trace the lines, written in a delicate, female hand, as follows:—      “MY DEAR SON,—You are not, probably, expecting to hear from     me at this time. Alas that I should have such an occasion to     write! At the time of your father’s death, it was supposed,     that, by the sacrifice of every thing, we had succeeded in     liquidating all his debts. Even this consolation is now     denied us. I received a call from Mr. Perry this morning, who     presented for _immediate payment_ a note given by your father     for fifty dollars. Immediate payment! How, with a salary barely     sufficient to support us, can you meet such a charge? Can     any way be devised? Mr. Perry threatens, if the money is not     forthcoming, to seize our furniture. He is a hard man, and I     have no hopes of appeasing him. I do not know that you can do     any thing to retard it; but I have thought it right to acquaint     you with this new calamity.                         “Your affectionate mother,                                                        “MARY DURELL.”  The young man laid down the letter with an air of depression.  “I scarcely know how to provide for this new contingency,” said he, meditatively. “My salary is small; and it requires the strictest economy to meet my expenses. I might ask for an advance; but Mr. Hathaway is particular on that point, and I should but court a refusal. But to have my mother’s furniture taken from the house! The whole amount would hardly cover the debt. There is one resource; but alas that I should ever think of resorting to it! I could take the money from the till, and return it when I am able. But shall I ever be able? It would be no more nor less than robbery. At all events, I will not do it to-night. Who knows but something may turn up to help us?”  The young man blew out the lamp, and left the store. The picture faded.  “I will show you another picture, somewhat different from the others: it will be the last,” said the stranger.  The next scene represented the interior of a baker’s shop. The baker—a coarse-featured man, with a hard, unprepossessing aspect—was waiting on a woman thinly clad in garments more suitable for June than December. She was purchasing two loaves of bread and a few crackers. There was another customer waiting his turn. It was a gentleman, with a pleasant smile on his face.  “Make haste!” said the baker, rudely, to the woman, who was searching for her money to pay for her purchases. “I can’t stop all day; and here’s a gentleman that you keep waiting.”  “Oh! never mind me: I am in no hurry,” the gentleman said.  “I am afraid,” said the woman, in an alarmed tone, “that I have lost my money. I had it here in my pocket; but it is gone.”  “Then you may return the bread. I don’t sell for nothing.”  “Trust me for once, sir; I will pay you in a day or two; otherwise my children must go without food to-morrow.”  “Can’t help that. You shouldn’t have been so careless.”  The woman was about turning away, when the voice of the other customer arrested her steps.  “How much money have you lost?” he inquired.  “It was but half a dollar,” was the reply; “but it was of consequence to me, as I can get no more for a day or two; and how we are to live till then, Heaven knows.”  “Perhaps that will help you to decide the question.” And he took from his pocket a five-dollar bill, and handed it to her.  “Oh, sir!” said she, her face lighting up with gratitude, “this is indeed generous and noble. The blessings of those you have befriended attend you!”  She remained to make a few purchases, and then, with a light heart, departed.  The last picture faded from the mirror; and the stranger, wrapping it up, simply said,—  “You have seen how much happiness a trifling sum can produce. Will you not, out of your abundance, make a similar experiment?”  The stranger disappeared; and Mr. Hathaway awoke to find his dream terminated by the chime of the New Year’s bells.  “This is something more than a dream,” said he, thoughtfully. “I will, at all events, take counsel of the mystic vision; and it shall not be my fault if some hearts are not made happier through my means before another sun sets.”  When the merchant arose on the following morning, it was with the light heart which always accompanies the determination to do right. He was determined that the salutation of “A happy New Year” should not be with him a mere matter of lip-service.  “I believe,” said he to himself, “I will go and see my old friend, Mark Audley. If his son Arthur is really desirous of going to college, what is there to prevent my bearing the expenses? I am abundantly able, and can dispose of my money in no better way.”  As he walked along with this praiseworthy determination in his heart, his attention was drawn towards a little girl, who was gazing, with eager, wistful eyes, into the window of a neighboring shop, where were displayed, in tempting array, some fine oranges. He thought—nay, he was quite sure—that in her he recognized the little girl who figured in the first scene unfolded the evening before by the mysterious mirror. By way of ascertaining, he addressed her in pleasant tone:—  “Your name is Alice,—is it not?”  “Yes, sir,” said she, looking up, surprised, and somewhat awed.  “And your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5623"],["title","The Young Explorer; Or, Claiming His Fortune (#0)"],["body","YOUNG EXPLORER  OR  CLAIMING HIS FORTUNE  BY  HORATIO ALGER, JR.

BEN'S INHERITANCE.   \"I've settled up your father's estate, Benjamin,\" said Job Stanton. \"You'll find it all figgered out on this piece of paper. There was that two-acre piece up at Rockville brought seventy-five dollars, the medder fetched a hundred and fifty, the two cows--\"  \"How much does it all come to, Uncle Job?\" interrupted Ben, who was impatient of details.  \"Hadn't you better let me read off the items, nephew?\" asked Job, looking over his spectacles.  \"No, Uncle Job. I know you've done your best for me, and there's no need of your going through it all. How much is there left after all expenses are paid?\"  \"That's what I was a-comin' to, Ben. I make it out that there's three hundred and sixty-five dollars and nineteen cents. That's a dollar for every day in the year. It's a good deal of money, Ben.\"  \"So it is, Uncle Job,\" answered Ben, and he was quite sincere. There are not many boys of sixteen to whom this would not seem a large sum.  \"You're rich; that is, for a boy,\" added Uncle Job.  \"It's more than I expected, uncle. I want you to take fifteen dollars and nineteen cents. That'll leave me just three hundred and fifty.\"  \"Why should I take any of your money, nephew?\"  \"You've had considerable trouble in settling up the estate, and it's taken a good deal of your time, too.\"  \"My time ain't of much vally, and as to the trouble, it's a pity ef I can't take some trouble for my brother's son. No, Ben, I won't take a cent. You'll need it all.\"  \"But you said yourself it was a good deal of money for a boy, Uncle Job.\"  \"So it is, but it's all you've got. Most boys have fathers to take care of 'em, while you're alone in the world.\"  \"Yes I am alone in the world,\" said Ben sadly, his cheerful face clouding over.  \"But you've got an uncle, lad,\" continued Job Stanton, laying his hand gently on the boy's shoulder. \"He's a poor man, but as much as in him lies, he'll be your friend and helper.\"  \"I know it, Uncle Job. You've always been kind to me.\"  \"And allus will be, Ben. Now, Ben, I've got a plan for you. I don't know what you'll think of it, but it's the best I've been able to think of.\"  \"What is it, Uncle Job?\"  \"Ef you'll stay with me and help me in the shop, I'll give you a home, such as it is, and fifty dollars a year toward your clothes. Your Aunt Hannah and your Cousin Jane want you to make your home with us.\"  \"I'm very much obliged to you, Uncle Job,\" said Ben slowly.  \"You needn't be, boy. It's a sort of mutooal arrangement. It'll be as good for me as for you. You can put your money in the bank, and let it stay till you're twenty-one. Why, it'll be nigh on to five hunderd dollars by that time.\"  \"I'm much obliged to you, Uncle Job, as I said before, but there's one thing in the way.\"  \"What's that, Ben?\"  \"I don't like shoemaking.\"  \"Perhaps it isn't genteel enough for you, Ben,\" said his uncle.  \"I don't care for that, Uncle Job, but I don't like being shut up in a shop. Besides, it doesn't give steady work. Last year you were without work at least a third of the time.\"  \"So I was, Ben,\" said Job. \"I'm willin' to own that's a great drawback.\"  \"And it isn't likely to be any better hereafter. Last year was as good as the average.\"  \"It was better,\" Job admitted. \"The year before I was out of work five months.\"  \"Well, Uncle Job, I want to work at something that'll give me employment all the year round.\"  \"So do I, Ben, but I don't see what you can find, unless you go to work on a farm. You're used to that, and I guess you could find a chance before long. There's Deacon Pitkin wants a boy, and would be glad of the chance of gettin' you.\"  \"I suppose he would,\" said Ben, laughing. \"Would you advise me to go there?\"  \"Well, there might be some objections, but-\"  \"You know I wouldn't get enough to eat, Uncle Job,\" interrupted Ben. \"Why, Deacon Pitkin's the meanest man in the village.\"  \"You mustn't be hasty in your judgments, nephew.\"  \"I'm not. I know what I'm talking about. I worked for the deacon two days once. He gave me ten cents a day and board-and such board! Why, I got up from the table hungry every meal, and yet the deacon reported afterward that I was a great eater. Mrs. Pitkin cuts a small pie into eight pieces, each about two mouthfuls, and when I asked for a second piece, she asked if I was allowed to have two pieces at home.\"  \"What did you say?\" asked Uncle Job, evidently amused.  \"I said yes, and that each piece was twice as big as she gave.\"  \"I'm afraid that was rather forward, Ben. Did she say anything to that?\"  \"She said I must be very greedy, and that boys always ate more'n was good for 'em. No, Uncle Job, I don't care to work for Deacon Pitkin.\"  \"Have you formed any plans, Ben? You don't want to go on a farm, and you don't want to go into a shoeshop, and that's about all you can find to do in Hampton.\"  \"I don't mean to stay in Hampton,\" said Ben quietly.  \"Don't mean to stay in Hampton!\" exclaimed Uncle Joe, amazed.  \"No, uncle. There's a good many places besides Hampton in the world.\"  \"So there is, Ben,\" answered Uncle Job, with a disregard of grammar more excusable than his nephew's, for he had never had any special educational advantages,-\"so there is, but you don't know anybody in them other places.\"  \"It won't take me long to get acquainted,\" returned Ben, not at all disturbed by this consideration.  \"Where do you want to go?\"  \"I want to go to California.\"  \"Gracious sakes! Want to go to California!\" gasped Job. \"What put that idee into your head?\"  \"A good many people are going there, and there's a chance to get rich quick out among the gold-mines.\"  \"But you're only a boy.\"  \"I'm a pretty large boy, Uncle Job,\" said Ben complacently, \"and I'm pretty strong.\"  \"So you be, Ben, but it takes more than strength.\"  \"What more, Uncle Job?\"  \"It takes judgment.\"  \"Can't a boy have judgment?\"  \"Waal, he may have some, but you don't often find an old head on young shoulders.\"  \"I know all that, uncle, but I can work if I am a boy.\"  \"I know you're willin' to work, Ben, but it'll cost a sight of money to get out to Californy to start with.\"  \"I know that. It will take two hundred dollars.\"  \"And that's more'n half of all you've got. It seems to me temptin' Providence to spend such a sight of money for the chance of earning some on t'other side of the world, when you can get a livin' here and put all your money in the bank.\"  \"In five years it would only amount to five hundred dollars, and if I go to California, I expect to be worth a good deal more than that before two years are past.\"  \"I'm afraid you've got large idees, Ben.\"  \"You won't interfere with my going, Uncle Job?\" asked Ben anxiously.  \"I won't actooly interfere, but I'll do all I can to have you give it up.\"  \"But if my mind is set upon it, you'll let me go, won't you, uncle?\"  \"I suppose I must,\" said Job Stanton. \"A wilful lad must have his way. But you mustn't blame me if things turn out unlucky.\"  \"No, I shall only blame myself.\"  \"There's one promise you must make me,\" said his uncle.  \"What is that?\"  \"Take a week to consider whether you hadn't better take my advice and stay at home.\"  \"Yes, uncle, I'll promise that.\"  \"And you'll think it over in all its bearin's?\"  \"Yes, uncle.\"  \"It ain't best to take any important step without reflection, Ben.\" \"You're right, uncle.\"  This conversation took place in Job Stanton's little shoe-shop, only a rod distant from the small, plain house which he had occupied ever since he had been married. It was interrupted by the appearance of a pretty girl of fourteen, who, presenting herself at the door of the shop, called out:  \"Supper's ready, father.\"  \"So are we, Jennie,\" said Ben, promptly.  \"You are always ready to eat, Ben,\" said his cousin, smiling.  \"That's what Mrs. Pitkin used to think, Jennie. She used to watch every mouthful I took.\"     CHAPTER II.  DEACON PITKIN'S OFFER.   Ben's father had died three months before. He had lost his mother when ten years old, and having neither brother nor sister was left quite alone in the world. At one time his father had possessed a few thousand dollars, but by unlucky investments he had lost nearly all, so that Ben's inheritance amounted to less than four hundred dollars.  This thought troubled Mr. Stanton, and on his death-bed he spoke about it to his son.  \"I shall leave you almost destitute, Ben,\" he said. \"If I had acted more wisely it would have been different.\"  \"Don't trouble yourself about that, father,\" said Ben promptly. \"I am young and strong, and I shall be sure to get along.\"  \"You will have to work hard, and the world is a hard taskmaster.\"  \"I don't feel afraid, father. I am sure I shall succeed.\"  The dying father was cheered by Ben's confident words. Our hero was strong and sturdy, his limbs active, and his face ruddy with health. He looked like a boy who could get along. He was not a sensitive plant, and not to be discouraged by rebuffs. The father's brow cleared.  \"I am glad you are not afraid to meet what is in store for you,\" he said. \"I believe you will "]]]
