She almost wished she was standing there by the side of Pickering Dodge, one of the bright group on whom the eyes of the older people were all turned, as they waited for the first figure to begin.  \"Well, Polly\"--it was Mr. Alstyne who spoke, and he acted as if he had come to stay by her side--\"you've covered yourself with glory this evening.\"  \"Have I, sir?\" asked Polly absently, wishing there had been less of the glory, and a little more fun.  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mr. Alstyne, his keen eyes searching her face. \"Well, now, Polly, your dragons, although not exactly like any living ones extant, made me think of some I saw at the Zoo, in London. Do you want me to tell you how?\"  \"Oh! if you please,\" cried Polly, her color coming back, and beginning to forget the dance and the dancers.  \"Let us sit down here, then,\" said Mr. Alstyne, drawing her off to two chairs in a corner, \"and you shall have the tale. No pun, Polly, you know.\" And he plunged into it at once.  \"Yes, Alstyne has her all right,\" Mr. King was saying at the further end of the drawing-room to Mrs. Pepper; he spied the whole thing; \"he'll take care of her, you may depend.\"  And two more people had seen; one was Jasper. Nevertheless his partner, Alexia Rhys, thought it necessary to enlighten him.  \"Just think, Polly's given up her chance with the best dancer in the room, and sent Pickering Dodge off with that horrid Ray Simmons.\"  Jasper pretended not to hear. \"This is our figure,\" he said hastily, and they whirled off, finished it, and were back again.  \"Isn't she a goose?\" as he fanned her, and tried to introduce another subject.  \"I suppose she best pleases herself,\" said the boy indifferently. \"Why should any one else interfere in the matter?\"  \"But some one else ought to interfere,\" cried Alexia, with a little pout, provoked at his indifference; \"that's just the way she does in school all the time. Oh! I'm vexed at her, I can tell you. She's so silly--dear me, it's our turn again.\"  By the next interim she had forgotten all about Polly and whether she was having a nice time or the stupidest one imaginable, for Joel, who held dancing in great contempt, sauntered up.  \"Aren't you glad now that you didn't find out about the secret?\" cried Alexia radiantly. \"Oh! you are such a nuisance, Joey,\" she added frankly.  \"Phooh!\" exclaimed Joel, \"it wasn't worth finding out, that old secret. But it's as good as girls ever get up,\" he finished with a supercilious air.  \"It was a perfectly splendid play!\" cried Alexia, \"and much too good for a lot of boys. Goodness, Joey, I wouldn't celebrate if you four were coming home from school to our house. I'd have the jollification the night before you went back.\"  \"I wouldn't go home if 'twas to your house,\" declared Joel with equal candor. \"I'd run off to sea, first.\"  \"Come, come, you two, stop sparring,\" cried Jasper, holding out his hand; \"its our turn again, Alexia. Joel, take yourself off.\"  Alexia flashing Joel a bright, making-up smile, dashed off into the figure.  \"Good-by,\" said Joel with a smile as cheery, for he really liked her the best of all Polly's girl friends.  After the dance, supper was announced, and everybody marched out to the supper room; the dancers with their partners following.  \"Will you allow me?\" Mr. Alstyne seeing the movement, got out of his chair and offered his arm to Polly with a courtly bow.  \"Oh! don't think of me, sir,\" she began, blushing very hard. \"Joel will look out for me.\"  \"I much prefer waiting upon Miss Polly Pepper to any other lady in the room,\" said Mr. Alstyne, with another bow, courtlier than the first, \"since Mrs. Alstyne is provided for. See, Polly, Mr. King is taking her out. And your mother has her cavalier, in Mr. Cabot; and Mrs. Whitney has already gone out with Mr. Fairfax. So if you don't accept my services, I shall be entirely left out in the cold.\" He stood offering his arm, and Polly, laughing merrily, put her hand within it.  \"It's very good of you, sir,\" she said simply, as they fell into step and joined the procession.  \"I'm afraid if you had trusted to Joel's tender mercies, you would have fared hardly,\" said Mr. Alstyne, laughing. \"Look, Polly, over yonder in the corner.\" They were just passing into the supper room, and now caught sight of Joel chatting away to a very pretty little creature, in blue and white, as busily and unconcernedly as if he had done that sort of thing for years.  \"Why!\" cried Polly quite aghast, \"that can't be Joel. He just hates girls, you know, Mr. Alstyne, and never goes to parties.\"  \"He seems to be able to endure it all very well to-night,\" said her companion dryly. \"Shall I get you an ice, Miss Polly?\"  \"Yes, thank you,\" said Polly absently, not being able to take her eyes from Joel and his friend. At last, by the force of attraction, he turned and looked at her. But instead of showing self-consciousness, his round eyes surveyed her coolly, while he went on talking and laughing with the little blue-and-white thing.  \"Polly, Polly,\" exclaimed Alexia Rhys, hurrying up, while Jasper was storming the supper table for her, \"do look at Joel Pepper! He actually brought in a girl to supper!\"  \"I see,\" said Polly, gazing at the two in a fascinated way.  \"On the other hand,\" said Alexia, sending swift, bird-like glances around the supper room, \"there are Van and Percy moping off by themselves as if they hadn't a friend in the world. What a pity; they used to be so lively at parties.\"  Polly wrenched her gaze away from the astonishing sight on which it had been fixed, and following Alexia's glance, took a keen look over at the young Whitneys. \"Oh! oh! I must go to them,\" she cried remorsefully. \"Tell Mr. Alstyne, please, when he comes back, where I am,\" and without another word she dashed back of some gaily dressed ladies just entering the supper room, and was out of the door.  \"If I ever did!\" cried Alexia irritably to herself, \"see anything so queer! Now she thinks she must race after those boys. I wish I'd kept still. Jasper, she's just as funny as ever,\" as he came up with a plate of salad, and some oysters. \"Who?\" said the boy; \"is this right, Alexia?\" offering the plate.  \"Why, Polly,\" said Alexia; \"yes, that's lovely,\" with a comforted glance at the plate and its contents. \"Oh! she's gone off, Mr. Alstyne,\" to that gentleman, approaching with Polly's ice. \"You can't expect her to stay for the goodies,\" beginning to nibble at her own.  \"Where is she?\" cried Mr. Alstyne, laughing, and sweeping the room with his brown eyes. \"Oh! I see,\" his glance lighting on the Whitney boys' corner.  \"Yes, she told me to tell you,\" said Alexia, between her mouthfuls of salad and oyster, \"where she is,\" as he started.  \"Oh, Percy and Van!\" Polly was whispering hurriedly, \"I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, only it was so very dreadful, you know, to hear you go on so to each other.\"  \"We didn't mean anything,\" said Percy, pushing one foot back and forth in an embarrassed way, and looking as if he did not know what to do with his hands, which confused him more than anything else, as he had been quite sure of them on all previous occasions.  Van thrust his into his pockets, and seemed on the point of whistling, but remembering where he was, took his lips speedily out of their curves, and looked the other way.  Just then Mr. Alstyne came up.  \"Oh!\" cried Polly suddenly, the color rushing over her face. \"Could you, Mr. Alstyne, give that to some one else? Percy and Van are going to wait upon me.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Mr. Alstyne in a flash, \"nothing easier;\" and he disappeared as suddenly as he came.  \"Now, boys,\" said Polly, turning back to them and whispering busily, \"I know you won't ever say such perfectly dreadful things to each other again. And so I'm going to ask you both to get me something to eat, will you?\"  \"How do you know we won't?\" cried Percy slowly. He was sorry enough for the episode in the coach, yet couldn't resist the temptation to show he was not to be driven.  \"Because I shall then have nothing whatever to eat,\" said Polly merrily, \"for of course I can't take a bit from anybody else after refusing Mr. Alstyne's kindness. Don't you see? Oh, Percy! you wouldn't quite do that?\"  Van laughed. \"She's got us, Percy,\" he said, \"quite fast. You know you won't fight, and I won't again; we both said so a little while back; so what's the good of holding out now?\"  Percy drew himself up very slowly and decidedly. \"I won't trouble you so again, Polly,\" holding out his hand. \"Now would you like oysters?\" all in the same breath.  \"And here's mine,\" cried Van, extending his brown one. \"Can't I bring you some salad?\"  \"Yes, yes,\" cried Polly gaily, and she released their hands after a cordial grasp. \"You may bring me everything straight through, boys,\" as they rushed off, heads erect, to the crowded supper-table.  \"You've had a good time?\" asked Mrs. Pepper slowly, with a keen glance into the flushed face and sparkling eyes, as they turned up the gas in Polly's bedroom. \"Dear me! it is half-past eleven.\"  \"Splendid,\" said Polly, shaking herself free from the white gown and beginning to braid her hair for the night. \"Percy and Van were perfectly lovely, and Mr. Alstyne was so good to me. And oh! Mamsie, isn't dear Mr. King just the dearest dear, to give all this to the boys? We haven't thanked him half enough.\"  \"He is indeed,\" said Mrs. Pepper heartily. \"Why, where is Phronsie?\" looking around the room.  \"She was right back of you,\" said Polly. \"She wanted to take off her things herself. Did you ever see such a sweet\"--she began, but Mrs. Pepper did not stop to hear, hurrying out to the adjoining room, shared by the mother and her baby.  \"She isn't here,\" Polly heard her say in bewildered tones. So Polly, her long hair blown about her face, ran in, brush in hand.  \"Why, where\"--she began laughingly.  \"She wouldn't go downstairs, I don't think,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5632"],["title","Five Little Peppers Midway (#8)"],["body","Mrs. Pepper, peering in all the corners, and even meditating a look under the bed.  \"No, no,\" cried Polly, \"the lights are all turned out,\" investigating all possible and impossible nooks that a mouse could creep into. \"Where can she be? Phronsie--Phronsie!\"  \"Well, of course she is downstairs,\" declared Mrs. Pepper at last, hurrying out of the room.  \"Take a candle, Mamsie, you'll fall,\" cried Polly, and throwing on her bath wrapper, she seized the light from the mantel and hurried after her.  Half-way down she could hear Phronsie's gay little laugh, and catch the words \"Good-night, my dear Grandpapa,\" and then she came slowly out from Mr. King's sitting-room, and softly closed the door.  \"Phronsie!\" exclaimed Polly, sitting down on the middle of the stairs, the candle shaking ominously, \"how could\"--  \"Hush!\" said Mrs. Pepper, who had fumbled her way along the hall. \"Don't say anything. Oh, Phronsie dear, so you went down to bid Grandpapa good-night, did you?\"  Phronsie turned a glance of gentle surprise on her mother, and then looked up at Polly.  \"No, not exactly to bid him good-night,\" she said slowly. \"I was afraid he was sick; I heard him coughing, so I went down.\"  \"He is quite well, isn't he?\" asked Mrs. Pepper. \"Here, give me your hand, child; we must get up to bed.\"  \"Oh, yes! he is quite really and truly all well,\" declared Phronsie, breaking into another glad little laugh. \"He said he never had such a beautiful time in his life, and he is just as well as he can be. Oh, Polly!\" as she picked up her Princess gown and prepared to ascend the stairs, \"how funny you look sitting there!\"  \"Funny?\" said Polly grimly. \"I dare say, and I feel funny too, Phronsie.\"     VI  THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE   They were all sitting around the library fire; Polly under the pretext of holding Phronsie's head in her lap, was sitting on the rug beside her, the boys on either hand; old Mr. King was marching up and down the long room, and looking at them. The merriest of stories had been told, Polly urging on all the school records of jolly times, and those not so enjoyable; songs had been sung, and all sorts of nonsense aired. At last Joel sprang up and ran over to pace by the old gentleman's side.  \"Christmas was good enough,\" said the boy, by way of beginning conversation.  \"Hey?\" responded the old gentleman, looking down at him, \"I should think it was. Well, and how about the wonderful play on the twenty-first? And that was good enough, too, I dare say.\"  \"That was well enough,\" said Joel indifferently, \"I don't care for such stuff, though.\"  \"Tut--tut!\" cried Mr. King in pretended anger, \"now I won't have anything said against that wonderful production. Not a thing, sir, do you hear?\"  Joel laughed, his chubby face twinkling all over in secret amusement. \"Well, I know something better, if you'll only let us do it, sir, than a hundred old plays.\"  \"And pray what is it?\" demanded Mr. King, \"let's have it at once. But the idea of surpassing the play! Oh, no, no, it can't be done, sir!\"  \"It's to go and see the little brown house,\" said Joel, standing up on his tiptoes to a level with the old gentleman's ear, and one eye looking backward to see that nobody heard.  Mr. King started, pulled his handsome moustache thoughtfully, looked at Joel sharply, and then over at the group in the firelight.  \"They don't know anything about it,\" cried the boy in a whisper, \"don't tell them. It's my secret, and yours,\" he added generously. \"Oh! if we might only go and look at it.\"  \"It's winter,\" observed the old gentleman, and stepping to the window he put aside the draperies, to peer out into the black evening. \"Yes, it really is winter,\" he added with a shiver, to the boy who was close behind, and as if no longer in doubt about it, he added most emphatically, \"it really is winter, Joel.\"  \"Well, but you never saw anything like it, how magnificent winter is in Badgertown,\" cried Joel in an excited whisper. \"Such hills to coast down; the snow is always crisp there, sir, not like this dirty town mud. And the air is as dry as punk,\" he added artfully. \"Oh! 'twould be such a lark;\" he actually clasped his hands.  \"Badgertown isn't so very far off,\" said Mr. King thoughtfully, \"I'll think about it and see if we can manage it.\"  \"Ugh-ow!\" squealed Joel, utterly forgetful of his caution of secrecy, \"we can, we can; we can open the little brown house, and build great fires there, and\"--But he got no further. Into the midst of Van's liveliest sally, came the words \"little brown house,\" bringing all the young people to their feet, Phronsie running to the old gentleman's side, with, \"What is it, Grandpapa? He said the little brown house.\"  \"Get away!\" cried Joel crossly to the besiegers, each and all wildly clamoring. \"What is it? What are you talking about? It's my secret,\" he cried, \"and his,\" pointing with a dismayed finger to Mr. King.  \"Well, it isn't a secret any longer,\" cried Polly, flushing with excitement. \"You said 'little brown house,' we heard you just as plainly; and you re getting up something, I know you are.\" \"People don't usually select a roomful of listeners, and then shout out their secrets,\" said Jasper. \"You are in for it now, Joe, and no mistake. Go ahead, old fellow, and give us the rest of it.\"  Joel whirled away from them all in desperation. \"You might as well,\" laughed the old gentleman, \"the mischief is done now, and no mistake.\"  So Joel, thus set upon, allowed the whole beautiful plan to be wrung from him, by slow and torturing installments; how they all were to go to Badgertown, open the little brown house, and stay there--here he glanced at Mr. King--\"perhaps a week,\" he brought out suddenly, filling the time with all sorts of frolics, and playing they were there again, and really and truly living in the old home.  At last it was all out, to be received in different ways by the listeners.  \"Oh, Joe!\" cried Davie with shining eyes. \"We never could come away again if we once get there, never!\"  Polly stood quite still, a mist gathering before her glad eyes, out of which she dimly saw the little brown house arise and beckon to her.  Phronsie jumped up and down and clapped her hands in glee. \"Oh, Grandpapa, Grandpapa!\" she screamed, \"please take us to the little brown house, please!\"  That settled it. \"I do not think we need to consider it longer,\" said Mr. King, glancing at Ben, whose face told what he thought, \"children, we will go--that is, if Mrs. Pepper says yes.  \"I will ask her,\" cried Joel with a howl, springing off.  \"Come on,\" cried Jasper, \"let's all 'be in at the death.'\" And the library was deserted in a twinkling.  But mother was nowhere to be found. \"Upstairs, downstairs, and in the lady's chamber,\" they sought her wildly.  \"Oh! I forgot,\" exclaimed Polly, when at last they gathered in the wide hall, disposing themselves on the chairs and along the stairs, all tired out. \"She has gone to evening meeting with Auntie. How stupid of me not to remember that.\"  \"Well, I declare!\" cried a voice above them, and looking up they met the cold blue eyes of Mrs. Chatterton regarding them over the railing. \"Cousin Horatio, do you keep a menagerie, or a well-ordered house, I beg to inquire?\"  \"A menagerie,\" said Mr. King coolly, leaning on the balustrade at the foot of the stairs, and looking up at her. \"All sorts of strange animals wander in here, Cousin.\"  \"Hum; I understand. I'm not so dull as you think. Well, you've changed, let me tell you, vastly, and not for the better either, in the last six years. Who would ever suppose I see before me fastidious Horatio King!\" she exclaimed, lifting her long thin hands to show him their horror-stricken palms.  \"I dare say, I dare say, Cousin Eunice,\" assented Mr. King carelessly, \"but I consider all you say as a compliment.\"  \"Compliment?\" she repeated disdainfully, and added with a rising note of anger, forgetting herself, \"there's no fool like an old fool.\"  \"So I think,\" said Mr. King in the same tone as before. \"Children, come into my room now, and close the door.\" And Cousin Eunice was left to air further opinions to her own ear.  But when Mother Pepper and Mrs. Whitney did come home from the meeting, oh! what a time there was. They all fell upon her, as soon as the door opened, and the whole air was filled with \"little brown house.\" \"May we--may we?\" \"A whole week.\" \"Two days, Mamsie, do say yes,\" and Phronsie's glad little chirp \"Grandpapa wants to go, he does!\" ending every other exclamation.  \"What a babel,\" cried Mrs. Pepper, her black eyes roving over the excited group. \"Now what is it all about? Baby, you tell mother first.\"  Phronsie was not too big to jump into the comfortable lap, and while her fingers played with the bonnet strings, she laid the whole delightful plan open, the others hanging over them in ill-suppressed excitement.  \"Well, you see, Mamsie,\" she began deliberately.  \"Oh! you are so slow, Phronsie,\" exclaimed Polly, \"do hurry.\"  \"Let her take her own time,\" said Mr. King, \"go on, child.\"  \"Dear Grandpapa,\" proceeded Phronsie, turning her yellow head to look at him, her hand yet among the bonnet strings, \"is going to take us all, every single one, to see the little brown house, and just touch it once, and be sure it's there, and peek in the doors and windows and\"--  \"No, no,\" roared Joel, \"we're going to stay, and a week too,\" hopping confidently up and down.  \"Oh, Joe! not a week,\" corrected Polly with glowing cheeks, \"perhaps two days; we don't know yet.\"  \"Three--three,\" begged Van, pushing his head further into the center of the group. \"Mrs. Pepper, do say you want to stay three days,\" he begged.  \"I haven't said I wanted to go yet,\" she answered with a smile.  \"Now, every one of you keep quiet,\" commanded Mr. King, raising his hand, \"or you'll spoil the whole thing. Phronsie shall tell her story as she likes.\"  Thereupon the rest, with the shadow of his warning that the whole might be spoiled, fell back to a vigorous restraint once more.  \"P"]]]
