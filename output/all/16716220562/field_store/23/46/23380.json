It is true that in July farm commodity prices had been pushed up higher than they are today, but that push came in part from pure speculation by people who could not tell you the difference between wheat and rye, by people who had never seen cotton growing, by people who did not know that hogs were fed on corn--people who have no real interest in the farmer and his problems.  In spite, however, of the speculative reaction from the speculative advance, it seems to be well established that during the course of the year 1933 the farmers of the United States will receive 33 percent more dollars for what they have produced than they received in the year 1932.  Put in another way, they will receive $400 in 1933, where they received $300 the year before.  That, remember, is for the average of the country, for I have reports that some sections are not any better off than they were a year ago.  This applies among the major products, especially to cattle raising and the dairy industry.  We are going after those problems as fast as we can.  I do not hesitate to say, in the simplest, clearest language of which I am capable, that although the prices of many products of the farm have gone up and although many farm families are better off than they were last year, I am not satisfied either with the amount or the extent of the rise, and that it is definitely a part of our policy to increase the rise and to extend it to those products which have as yet felt no benefit.  If we cannot do this one way we will do it another.  Do it, we will.  Standing beside the pillar of the farm--the A.A.A.--is the pillar of industry--the N.R.A.  Its object is to put industry and business workers into employment and to increase their purchasing power through increased wages.  It has abolished child labor.  It has eliminated the sweat shop.  It has ended sixty cents a week paid in some mills and eighty cents a week paid in some mines.  The measure of the growth of this pillar lies in the total figures of reemployment which I have already given you and in the fact that reemployment is continuing and not stopping.  The secret of N.R.A. is cooperation.  That cooperation has been voluntarily given through the signing of the blanket codes and through the signing of specific codes which already include all of the greater industries of the nation.  In the vast majority of cases, in the vast majority of localities-- the N.R.A. has been given support in unstinted measure.  We know that there are chiselers.  At the bottom of every case of criticism and obstruction we have found some selfish interest, some private ax to grind.  Ninety percent of complaints come from misconception.  For example, it has been said that N.R.A. has failed to raise the price of wheat and corn and hogs; that N.R.A. has not loaned enough money for local public works.  Of course, N.R.A. has nothing whatsoever to do with the price of farm products, nor with public works.  It has to do only with industrial organization for economic planning to wipe out unfair practices and to create reemployment.  Even in the field of business and industry, N.R.A. does not apply to the rural communities or to towns of under twenty-five hundred population, except in so far as those towns contain factories or chain stores which come under a specific code.  It is also true that among the chiselers to whom I have referred, there are not only the big chiselers but also petty chiselers who seek to make undue profit on untrue statements.  Let me cite to you the example of the salesman in a store in a large Eastern city who tried to justify the increase in the price of a cotton shirt from one dollar and a half to two dollars and a half by saying to the customer that it was due to the cotton processing tax.  Actually in that shirt there was about one pound of cotton and the processing tax amounted to four and a quarter cents on that pound of cotton.  At this point it is only fair that I should give credit to the sixty or seventy million people who live in the cities and larger towns of the nation for their understanding and their willingness to go along with the payment of even these small processing taxes, though they know full well that the proportion of the processing taxes on cotton goods and on food products paid for by city dwellers goes 100 percent towards increasing the agricultural income of the farm dwellers of the land.  The last pillar of which I speak is that of the money of the country in the banks of the country.  There are two simple facts.  First, the federal government is about to spend one billion dollars as an immediate loan on the frozen or non-liquid assets of all banks closed since January 1, 1933, giving a liberal appraisal to those assets.  This money will be in the hands of the depositors as quickly as it is humanly possible to get it out.  Second, the Government Bank Deposit Insurance on all accounts up to $2500 goes into effect on January first.  We are now engaged in seeing to it that on or before that date the banking capital structure will be built up by the government to the point that the banks will be in sound condition when the insurance goes into effect.  Finally, I repeat what I have said on many occasions, that ever since last March the definite policy of the government has been to restore commodity price levels.  The object has been the attainment of such a level as will enable agriculture and industry once more to give work to the unemployed.  It has been to make possible the payment of public and private debts more nearly at the price level at which they were incurred.  It has been gradually to restore a balance in the price structure so that farmers may exchange their products for the products of industry on a fairer exchange basis. It has been and is also the purpose to prevent prices from rising beyond the point necessary to attain these ends.  The permanent welfare and security of every class of our people ultimately depends on our attainment of these purposes.  Obviously, and because hundreds of different kinds of crops and industrial occupations in the huge territory that makes up this Nation are involved, we cannot reach the goal in only a few months. We may take one year or two years or three years.  No one who considers the plain facts of our situation believes that commodity prices, especially agricultural prices, are high enough yet.  Some people are putting the cart before the horse.  They want a permanent revaluation of the dollar first.  It is the government's policy to restore the price level first.  I would not know, and no one else could tell, just what the permanent valuation of the dollar will be.  To guess at a permanent gold valuation now would certainly require later changes caused by later facts.  When we have restored the price level, we shall seek to establish and maintain a dollar which will not change its purchasing and debt paying power during the succeeding generation.  I said that in my message to the American delegation in London last July.  And I say it now once more.  Because of conditions in this country and because of events beyond our control in other parts of the world, it becomes increasingly important to develop and apply the further measures which may be necessary from time to time to control the gold value of our own dollar at home.  Our dollar is now altogether too greatly influenced by the accidents of international trade, by the internal policies of other nations and by political disturbance in other continents.  Therefore the United States must take firmly in its own hands the control of the gold value of our dollar.  This is necessary in order to prevent dollar disturbances from swinging us away from our ultimate goal, namely, the continued recovery of our commodity prices.  As a further effective means to this end, I am going to establish a government market for gold in the United States.  Therefore, under the clearly defined authority of existing law, I am authorizing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy gold newly mined in the United States at prices to be determined from time to time after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the President. Whenever necessary to the end in view, we shall also buy or sell gold in the world market.  My aim in taking this step is to establish and maintain continuous control.  This is a policy and not an expedient.  It is not to be used merely to offset a temporary fall in prices. We are thus continuing to move towards a managed currency.  You will recall the dire predictions made last spring by those who did not agree with our common policies of raising prices by direct means.  What actually happened stood out in sharp contrast with those predictions.  Government credit is high, prices have risen in part.  Doubtless prophets of evil still exist in our midst.  But government credit will be maintained and a sound currency will accompany a rise in the American commodity price level.  I have told you tonight the story of our steady but sure work in building our common recovery.  In my promises to you both before and after March 4th, I made two things plain:  First, that I pledged no miracles and, second, that I would do my best.  I thank you for your patience and your faith.  Our troubles will not be over tomorrow, but we are on our way and we are headed in the right direction.    June 28, 1934.   It has been several months since I have talked with you concerning the problems of government.  Since January, those of us in whom you have vested responsibility have been engaged in the fulfillment of plans and policies which had been widely discussed in previous months.  It seemed to us our duty not only to make the right path clear but also to tread that path.  As we review the achievements of this session of the Seventy-third Congress, it is made increasingly clear that its task was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5767"],["title","The Fireside Chats of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (#6)"],["body","that of completing and fortifying the work it had begun in March, l933.  That was no easy task, but the Congress was equal to it.  It has been well said that while there were a few exceptions, this Congress displayed a greater freedom from mere partisanship than any other peace-time Congress since the administration of President Washington himself.  The session was distinguished by the extent and variety of legislation enacted and by the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measures.  I mention only a few of the major enactments.  It provided for the readjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal bankruptcy acts and the Farm Relief Act.  It lent a hand to industry by encouraging loans to solvent industries unable to secure adequate help from banking institutions.  It strengthened the integrity of finance through the regulation of securities exchanges.  It provided a rational method of increasing our volume of foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreements.  It strengthened our naval forces to conform with the intentions and permission of existing treaty rights.  It made further advances towards peace in industry through the Labor Adjustment Act.  It supplemented our agricultural policy through measures widely demanded by farmers themselves and intended to avert price destroying surpluses.  It strengthened the hand of the federal government in its attempts to suppress gangster crime.  It took definite steps towards a national housing program through an act which I signed today designed to encourage private capital in the rebuilding of the homes of the nation.  It created a permanent federal body for the just regulation of all forms of communication, including the telephone, the telegraph and the radio.  Finally, and I believe most important, it reorganized, simplified and made more fair and just our monetary system, setting up standards and policies adequate to meet the necessities of modern economic life, doing justice to both gold and silver as the metal bases behind the currency of the United States.  In the consistent development of our previous efforts toward the saving and safeguarding of our national life, I have continued to recognize three related steps.  The first was relief, because the primary concern of any government dominated by the humane ideals of democracy is the simple principle that in a land of vast resources no one should be permitted to starve.  Relief was and continues to be our first consideration.  It calls for large expenditures and will continue in modified form to do so for a long time to come.  We may as well recognize that fact.  It comes from the paralysis that arose as the after-effect of that unfortunate decade characterized by a mad chase for unearned riches and an unwillingness of leaders in almost every walk of life to look beyond their own schemes and speculations.  In our administration of relief we follow two principles:  First, that direct giving shall, wherever possible, be supplemented by provision for useful and remunerative work and, second, that where families in their existing surroundings will in all human probability never find an opportunity for full self- maintenance, happiness and enjoyment, we will try to give them a new chance in new surroundings.  The second step was recovery, and it is sufficient for me to ask each and every one of you to compare the situation in agriculture and in industry today with what it was fifteen months ago.  At the same time we have recognized the necessity of reform and reconstruction--reform because much of our trouble today and in the past few years has been due to a lack of understanding of the elementary principles of justice and fairness by those in whom leadership in business and finance was placed--reconstruction because new conditions in our economic life as well as old but neglected conditions had to be corrected.  Substantial gains well known to all of you have justified our course.  I could cite statistics to you as unanswerable measures of our national progress--statistics to show the gain in the average weekly pay envelope of workers in the great majority of industries--statistics to show hundreds of thousands reemployed in private industries and other hundreds of thousands given new employment through the expansion of direct and indirect government assistance of many kinds, although, of course, there are those exceptions in professional pursuits whose economic improvement, of necessity, will be delayed.  I also could cite statistics to show the great rise in the value of farm products--statistics to prove the demand for consumers' goods, ranging all the way from food and clothing to automobiles, and of late to prove the rise in the demand for durable goods--statistics to cover the great increase in bank deposits and to show the scores of thousands of homes and of farms which have been saved from foreclosure.  But the simplest way for each of you to judge recovery lies in the plain facts of your own individual situation.  Are you better off than you were last year?  Are your debts less burdensome?  Is your bank account more secure?  Are your working conditions better?  Is your faith in your own individual future more firmly grounded?  Also, let me put to you another simple question:  Have you as an individual paid too high a price for these gains?  Plausible self- seekers and theoretical die-hards will tell you of the loss of individual liberty.  Answer this question also out of the facts of your own life.  Have you lost any of your rights or liberty or constitutional freedom of action and choice?  Turn to the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, which I have solemnly sworn to maintain and under which your freedom rests secure.  Read each provision of that Bill of Rights and ask yourself whether you personally have suffered the impairment of a single jot of these great assurances. I have no question in my mind as to what your answer will be.  The record is written in the experiences of your own personal lives.  In other words, it is not the overwhelming majority of the farmers or manufacturers or workers who deny the substantial gains of the past year.  The most vociferous of the Doubting Thomases may be divided roughly into two groups:  First, those who seek special political privilege and, second, those who seek special financial privilege.  About a year ago I used as an illustration the 90 percent of the cotton manufacturers of the United States who wanted to do the right thing by their employees and by the public but were prevented from doing so by the 10 percent who undercut them by unfair practices and un-American standards.  It is well for us to remember that humanity is a long way from being perfect and that a selfish minority in every walk of life--farming, business, finance and even government service itself--will always continue to think of themselves first and their fellow-beings second.  In the working out of a great national program which seeks the primary good of the greater number, it is true that the toes of some people are being stepped on and are going to be stepped on. But these toes belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or to gain position or riches or both by some short cut which is harmful to the greater good.  In the execution of the powers conferred on it by Congress, the administration needs and will tirelessly seek the best ability that the country affords.  Public service offers better rewards in the opportunity for service than ever before in our history--not great salaries, but enough to live on.  In the building of this service there are coming to us men and women with ability and courage from every part of the Union.  The days of the seeking of mere party advantage through the misuse of public power are drawing to a close.  We are increasingly demanding and getting devotion to the public service on the part of every member of the administration, high and low.  The program of the past year is definitely in operation and that operation month by month is being made to fit into the web of old and new conditions.  This process of evolution is well illustrated by the constant changes in detailed organization and method going on in the National Recovery Administration.  With every passing month we are making strides in the orderly handling of the relationship between employees and employers.  Conditions differ, of course, in almost every part of the country and in almost every industry.  Temporary methods of adjustment are being replaced by more permanent machinery and, I am glad to say, by a growing recognition on the part of employers and employees of the desirability of maintaining fair relationships all around.  So also, while almost everybody has recognized the tremendous strides in the elimination of child labor, in the payment of not less than fair minimum wages and in the shortening of hours, we are still feeling our way in solving problems which relate to self- government in industry, especially where such self-government tends to eliminate the fair operation of competition.  In this same process of evolution we are keeping before us the objectives of protecting on the one hand industry against chiselers within its own ranks, and on the other hand the consumer through the maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the unfair sky-rocketing of retail prices.  But, in addition to this our immediate task, we must still look to the larger future.  I have pointed out to the Congress that we are seeking to find the way once more to well-known, long-established but to some degree forgotten ideals and values.  We seek the security of the men, women and children of the nation.  That security involves added means of providing better homes for the people of the nation.  That is the first principle of our future program.  The second is to plan the use of land and water resources of this country to the end that the means"]]]
