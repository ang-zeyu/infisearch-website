An appeal was made to the executive of the state, but little encouragement was returned.  The lieutenant- governor, Lilburn W. Boggs, afterward governor, was a pronounced \"Mormon\"-hater, and throughout the period of the troubles, he manifested sympathy with the persecutors.  One of the circuit judges who was asked to issue a peace warrant refused to do so, but advised the \"Mormons\" to arm themselves and meet the force of the outlaws with organized resistance.  This advice was not pleasing to the Latter-day Saints, whose religion enjoined tolerance and peace; but they so far heeded it as to arm a small force; and when the outlaws next came upon them, the people were not entirely unprepared.  A \"Mormon\" rebellion was now proclaimed.  The people had been goaded to desperation.  The militia was ordered out, and the \"Mormons\" were disarmed.  The mob was unrestrained in its eagerness for revenge.  The \"Mormons\" engaged able lawyers to institute and maintain legal proceedings against their foes, and this step, the right to which one would think could be denied no American citizen, called forth such an uproar of popular wrath as to affect almost the entire state.  It was winter; but the inclemency of the year only suited the better the purpose of the oppressor.  Homes were destroyed, men torn from their families were brutally beaten, tarred and feathered; women with babes in their arms were forced to flee half-clad into the solitude of the prairie to escape from mobocratic violence.  Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.  Making their way across the river, most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of Clay County, and afterward established themselves in Caldwell County, therein founding the city of Far West.  County and state judges, the governor, and even the President of the United States, were appealed to in turn for redress.  The national executive, Andrew Jackson, while expressing sympathy for the persecuted people, deplored his lack of power to interfere with the administration or non-administration of state laws; the national officials could do nothing; the state officials would do naught.  But the expulsion from Jackson County was but a prelude to the tragedy soon to follow.  A single scene of the bloody drama is known as the Haun's Mill massacre.  A small settlement had been founded by \"Mormon\" families on Shoal Creek, and here on the 30th of October, 1838, a company of two hundred and forty fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score.  No respect was paid to age or sex; grey heads, and infant lips that scarcely had learned to lisp a word, vigorous manhood and immature youth, mother and maiden, fared alike in the scene of carnage, and their bodies were thrown into an old well.  In October, 1838, the Governor of Missouri, the same Lilburn W. Boggs, issued his infamous exterminating order, and called upon the militia of the state to execute it.  The language of this document, signed by the executive of a sovereign state of the Union, declared that the \"Mormons\" must be driven from the state or exterminated.  Be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with the terrible commission, that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold-blooded butchery.  But tools were not wanting, as indeed they never have been, for murder and its kindred outrages.  What the heart of man can conceive, the hand of man will find a way to execute.  The awful work was carried out with dread dispatch.  Oh, what a record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact! An official edict offering expatriation or death to a peaceable community with no crime proved against them, and guilty of no offense other than that of choosing to differ in opinion from the masses!  American school boys read with emotions of horror of the Albigenses, driven, beaten and killed, with a papal legate directing the butchery; and of the Vaudois, hunted and hounded like beasts as the effect of a royal decree; and they yet shall read in the history of their own country of scenes as terrible as these in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate.  In the dread alternative offered them, the people determined again to abandon their homes; but whither should they go? Already they had fled before the lawless oppressor over well nigh half a continent; already were they on the frontiers of the country that they had regarded as the land of promised liberty. Thus far every move had carried them westward, but farther west they could not go unless they went entirely beyond the country of their birth, and gave up their hope of protection under the Constitution, which to them had ever been an inspired instrument, the majesty of which, as they had never doubted, would be some day vindicated, even to securing for them the rights of American citizens.  This time their faces were turned toward the east; and a host numbering from ten to twelve thousand, including many women and children, abandoned their homes and fled before their murderous pursuers, reddening the snow with bloody footprints as they journeyed.  They crossed the Mississippi and sought protection on the soil of Illinois.  There their sad condition evoked for a time general commiseration.  The press of the state denounced the treatment of the people by the Missourians and vindicated the character of the \"Mormons\" as peaceable and law-abiding citizens.  College professors published expressions of their horror over the cruel crusade; state officials, including even the governor, gave substantial evidence of their sympathy and good feeling.  This lull in the storm of outrage that had so long raged about them offered a strange contrast to their usual treatment.  Let it not be thought that all the people of Illinois were their friends; from the first, opposition was manifest, but their condition was so greatly bettered that they might have thought the advent of their Zion to be near at hand.  I stated that professional men, and even college professors raised their voices in commiseration of the \"Mormon\" situation and in denouncing the \"Mormon\" oppressors.  Prof. Turner of Illinois College wrote:      Who began the quarrel?  Was it the \"Mormons?\"  Is it     not notorious on the contrary that they were hunted     like wild beasts from county to county before they     made any resistance?  Did they ever, as a body,     refuse obedience to the laws, when called upon to do     so, until driven to desperation by repeated threats     and assaults by the mob?  Did the state ever make     one decent effort to defend them as fellow-citizens     in their rights or to redress their wrongs?  Let the     conduct of its governors and attorneys and the fate     of their final petitions answer!  Have any who     plundered and openly insulted the \"Mormons\" ever     been brought to the punishment due to their crimes?     Let boasting murderers of begging and helpless     infancy answer!  Has the state ever remunerated even     those known to be innocent for the loss of either     their property or their arms?  Did either the pulpit     or the press through the state raise a note of     remonstrance or alarm?  Let the clergymen who     abetted and the editors who encouraged the mob     answer!  As a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the Missourians I quote a paragraph from the Quincy _Argus_, March 16, 1839:      We have no language sufficiently strong for the     expression of our indignation and shame at the recent     transaction in a sister state, and that state,     Missouri, a state of which we had long been proud,     alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that     we could wish her star stricken from the bright     constellation of the Union.  We say we know of no     language sufficiently strong for the expression of     our shame and abhorrence of her recent conduct.  She     has written her own character in letters of blood,     and stained it by acts of merciless cruelty and     brutality that the waters of ages cannot efface.  It     will be observed that an organized mob, aided by     many of the civil and military officers of Missouri,     with Gov. Boggs at their head, have been the     prominent actors in this business, incited too, it     appears, against the \"Mormons\" by political hatred,     and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge.     They have but too well put in execution their threats     of extermination and expulsion, and fully wreaked     their vengeance on a body of industrious and     enterprising men, who had never wronged nor wished to     wrong them, but on the contrary had ever comported     themselves as good and honest citizens, living under     the same laws, and having the same right with     themselves to the sacred immunities of life, liberty     and property.    CHAPTER III  Settling in and about the obscure village of Commerce, the \"Mormon\" refugees soon demonstrated anew the marvelous recuperative power with which they were endowed, and a city seemed to spring from the earth.  Nauvoo--the City Beautiful--was the name given to this new abiding place.  It was situated but a few miles from Quincy, in a bend of the majestic river, giving the town three water fronts.  It seemed to nestle there as if the Father of Waters was encircling it with his mighty arm.  Soon a glorious temple crowned the hill up which the city had run in its rapid growth.  Their settlements extended into Iowa, then a territory.  The governors of both Iowa and Ohio testified to the worthiness of the Latter-day Saints as citizens, and pledged them the protection of the commonwealth.  The city of Nauvoo was chartered by the state of Illinois, and the rights of local self-government were assured to its citizens.  A military organization, the \"Nauvoo Legion,\" was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5630"],["title","The Story of \"Mormonism\" and The Philosophy of \"Mormonism\" (#4)"],["body","uthorized, and the establishment of a university was provided for; both these organizations were successfully effected.  It was here that a memorial was prepared and sent to the national government, reciting the outrages of Missouri, and asking reparation.  Joseph Smith himself, the head of the delegation, had a personal interview with President Van Buren, in which the grievances of the Latter-day Saints were presented.  Van Buren replied in words that will not be forgotten, \"Your cause is just, but I can do nothing for you.\"  The peaceful conditions at first characteristic of their Illinois settlement were not to continue.  The element of political influence asserted itself and the \"Mormons\" bade fair to soon hold the balance of power in local affairs.  The characteristic unity, so marked in connection with every phase of the people's existence, promised too much; immigration into Hancock county was continuous, and the growing power of the Latter-day Saints was viewed with apprehension.  With this as the true motive, many pretexts for annoyance were found; and arrests, trials, and acquittals were common experiences of the Church officers.  A charge, which promised to prove as devoid of foundation as had the excuses for the fifty arrests preceding it, led Joseph Smith, president of the Church, and Hyrum Smith, the patriarch, to again surrender themselves to the officers of the law.  They were taken to Carthage, Joseph having declared to friends his belief that he was going to the slaughter.  Governor Ford gave to the prisoners his personal guarantee for their safety; but mob violence was supreme, more mighty than the power of the state militia placed there to guard the prison; and these men were shot to death, even while under the governor's plighted pledge of protection.  Hyrum fell first; and Joseph, appearing at one of the windows in the second story, received the leaden missiles of the besieging mob, which was led by a recreant though professed minister of the gospel.  But the brutish passion of the mob was not yet sated; propping the body against a well-curb in the jail-yard, the murderers poured a volley of bullets into the corpse, and fled. Thus was the unholy vow of the mob fulfilled, that as law could not touch the \"Mormon\" leaders, powder and ball should.  John Taylor, who became years afterward president of the Church, was in the jail at the same time; he received four bullets, and was left supposedly dead.  Joseph Smith had been more than the ecclesiastical leader; his presence and personality had been ever powerful as a stimulus to the hearts of the people; none knew his personal power better than the members of his own flock, unless indeed it were the wolves who were ever seeking to harry the fold.  It had been the boast of anti-\"Mormons\" that with Joseph Smith removed, the Church would crumble to pieces of itself.  In the personality of their leader, it was thought, lay the secret of the people's strength; and like the Philistines, the enemy struck at the supposed bond of power.  Terrible as was the blow of the fearful fatality, the Church soon emerged from its despairing state of poignant grief, and rose mightier than before.  It is the faith of this people that while the work of God on earth is carried on by men, yet mortals are but instruments in the Creator's hands for the accomplishment of divine purposes.  The death of the president disorganized the First Presidency of the Church; but the official body next in authority, the Council of the Twelve, stepped to the front, and the progress of the Church was unhindered.  The work of the ministry was not arrested; the people paused but long enough to bury their dead and clear their eyes from the blinding tears that fell.  Let us take a retrospective glance at this unusual man.  Though his opponents deny him the divine commission with which his friends believe he was charged, they all, friends and foes alike, admit that he was a great man.  Through the testimony of his life's work and the sanctifying seal of his martyrdom, thousands have come to acknowledge him all that he professed to be--a messenger from God to the people.  He is not without admirers among men who deny the truth of his principles and the faith of his people.  A historical writer of the time, Josiah Quincy, a few weeks after the martyrdom, wrote:      It is by no means improbable that some future text book     for the use of generations yet unborn, will contain a     question something like this: \"What historical American     of the nineteenth century has exerted the most powerful     influence upon the destinies of his countrymen?\"  And it     is by no means impossible that the answer to that     interrogatory may be thus written--\"Joseph Smith, the     Mormon Prophet.\"  And the reply, absurd as it doubtless     seems to most men now living, may be an obvious     commonplace to their descendants.  History deals in     surprises and paradoxes quite as startling as this.  A     man who established a religion in this age of free     debate, who was and is today accepted by hundreds of     thousands as a direct emissary from the Most High--such     a rare human being is not to be disposed of by pelting     his memory with unsavory epithets.  * * *  The most     vital questions Americans are asking each other today,     have to deal with this man and what he has left us.     * * *  Joseph Smith, claiming to be an inspired teacher,     faced adversity such as few men have been called to     meet, enjoyed a brief season of prosperity such as few     men have ever attained, and finally * * * went     cheerfully to a martyr's death.  When he surrendered     his person to Governor Ford, in order to prevent the     shedding of blood, the Prophet had a presentiment of     what was before him.  \"I am going like a lamb to the     slaughter,\" he is reported to have said, \"but I am as     calm as a summer's morning.  I have a conscience void of     offense, and shall die innocent.\"  The \"Mormon\" people regarded it as a duty to make every proper effort to bring the perpetrators of the foul assassination of their leaders to justice; sixty names were presented to the local grand jury, and of the persons so designated, nine were indicted. After a farcical semblance of a trial, these were acquitted, and thus was notice, sanctioned by the constituted authority of the law, served upon all anti-\"Mormons\" of Illinois, that they were safe in any assault they might choose to make on the subjects of their hate.  The mob was composed of apt pupils in the learning of this lesson.  Personal outrages were of every-day occurrence; husbandmen were captured in their fields, beaten, tortured, until they barely had strength left to promise compliance with the demands of their assailants,--that they would leave the state. Houses were fired while the tenants were wrapped in uneasy slumber within; indeed, one entire town, that of Morley, was by such incendiarism reduced to ashes.  Women and children were aroused in the night, and compelled to flee unclad or perish in their burning dwellings.  But what of the internal work of the Church during these trying periods?  As the winds of winter, the storms of the year's deepest night, do but harden and strengthen the mountain pine, whose roots strike the deeper, whose branches thicken, whose twigs multiply by the inclemency that would be fatal to the exotic palm, raised by man with hot-house nursing, so the new sect continued its growth, partly in spite of, partly because of, the storms to which it was subjected.  It was no green-house growth, struggling for existence in a foreign clime, but a fit plant for the soil of a free land; and there existed in the minds of unprejudiced observers not a doubt as to its vitality.  The Church soon found its equilibrium again after the shock of its cruel experience.  Brigham Young, who for a decade had been identified with the cause, who had received his full share of persecution at mobocratic hands, now stood at the head of the presiding body in the priesthood of the Church.  The effect of this man's wonderful personality, his surprising natural ability, and to the people, the proofs of his divine acceptance, were apparent from the first.  Migration from other states and from foreign shores continued to swell the \"Mormon\" band, and this but angered the oppressors the more.  The members of the Church, recognizing the inevitable long before predicted by their murdered prophet, that the march of the Church would be westward, redoubled their efforts to complete the grand temple upon which they had not ceased to work through all the storms of persecution.  This structure, solemnly dedicated to their God, they entered, and there received their anointings and their blessings; then they abandoned it to the desecration and self-condemning outrages of their foes.  For the mob's decree had gone forth, that the \"Mormons\" must leave Illinois.  After a few sanguinary encounters, the leaders of the people acceded to the demands of their assailants, and agreed to leave early in the following spring; but the departure was not speedy enough to suit, and the lawless persecution was waged the more ruthlessly.  Soon the soil of Illinois was free from \"Mormon\" tread; Nauvoo was deserted, her 20,000 inhabitants expatriated.  Colonel Thomas L. Kane, a conspicuous figure at this stage of our country's history, was traveling eastward at the time, and reached Nauvoo shortly after its evacuation.  In a lecture before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, he related his experience in this sometime abode of the Saints.  I paraphrase a portion of his eloquent address.  Sighting the city from the western shore of the mighty Mississippi, as it nestled in the river's encircling embrace, he crossed to its principal wharf, and, there to his surprise, found no soul to meet him.  The stillness that everywhere prevailed was painful, broken only by an occasional faint"]]]
