And she had thought she fooled him!  \"Which is me, then?\" she said, in a small, low voice.  \"None of 'ern! You goosie! To think you could fool ME. In the first place, I knew you wouldn't send your own photograph; and when I saw those three charming specimens, in out-of-date clothes, I knew you had ransacked your album to find them. However, I took the whole bunch down to Marie, and she vowed she had never laid eyes on one of them before. So there, now!\"  \"Then we're just back where we started from,\" said Patty, cheerfully.  \"Yes; but, if you'll come to the musicale on Friday night, we can make great progress in a short time.\"  \"I told you I'd go, if you would persuade Marie to invite me.\"  \"Nonsense! I believe she HAS invited you. I believe you're Miss Curtiss. SHE has dark hair.\"  \"Why not that other singer, Miss Fairfield?\"  \"Oh, Marie says she's a blonde. The 'raving beauty' sort. I detest that kind. I know she's vain.\"  \"Yes, she is. I hate to speak against another girl, but I know that Patty Fairfield, and she IS vain.\"  \"Well, never mind about Patty Fairfield She doesn't interest me a bit. But what about you? Will you come to the party? Oh, DO-ee, DO-ee,--now,--as my old Scotch nurse used to say. Come to your waiting knight!\"  Kit's voice was very wheedlesome, and Patty was moved to encourage him a little.  \"Do you know,--I almost think--that maybe--possibly--perhaps, I WILL go.\"  \"Really? Oh, Poppycheek, I'm SO glad! I do want to see My Girl!\"  \"YOUR girl, indeed!\"  \"Yes; mine by right of discovery.\"  \"But you haven't discovered me yet.\"  \"But I will,--on Friday night. You'll TRULY come, WON'T you?\"  \"Honest, I've never been where I wasn't invited--\"  \"But this is different----\"  \"Yes,--it IS different----\"  \"Oh, then you will come! Goody, GOODY! I'm so glad!\"  \"Don't break the telephone with your gladness! Suppose I DO come, how will you know me? How will you know that it is I?\"  \"Oh, I'll know! 'I shall know it, I shall feel it, something subtle will reveal it, for a glory round thee hovers that will lighten up the gloom.'\"  \"Oh, you ARE a poet.\"  \"I am a poet, but I didn't write that. However, it was only because the other fellow got ahead of me.\"  \"Who was he? Who wrote it?\"  \"I'll tell you Friday night. Come early, won't you?\" \"No; I always get to a party late.\"  \"Don't be too late. I want to play to you. And will you sing?\"  \"Mercy, gracious! I might go to a party without being invited, but I can't SING without being asked. You tell Marie I'm coming, will you?\"  \"You bet I will. What shall you wear?\"  \"What's your favourite colour?\"  \"Red.\"  \"Red is becoming to brunettes; but I haven't any red evening gown. How about yellow?\"  \"All right, wear yellow. I shall adore you in any colour.\"  \"Well; perhaps I'll come, and perhaps I won't. Good-night.\"  Patty hung up the receiver with a sudden click, and Mr. Kit Cameron was left very much in doubt as to whether the whole thing was a joke or not.     CHAPTER VI  PRINCESS POPPYCHEEK   On the night of the musicale at Marie Homer's, her talented cousin arrived long before any guests were expected.  \"I couldn't wait, Aunt Frances,\" he said, as Mrs. Homer greeted him. \"I'm so impatient to see My Girl.\"  Kit had told the Homers of the telephone conversations, because he was so anxious to find out his lady's name. Of course, he had not told all they said, and from his incoherent ravings about a black-haired beauty Marie never guessed he could mean Patty.  \"You're a foolish boy, Kit,\" said his Aunt.  \"I don't believe that girl is any one we know, but is some mischievous hoyden who is leading you a dance. You won't see her to-night,--if you ever do.\"  \"Then I shall think up the easiest death possible, and die it,\" declared Kit, cheerfully. \"Why, you know, Aunt Frances, I never took any interest in a girl before, except of course Marie and Bee, but this girl is so different from everybody else in the world. Her voice is like a chime of silver bells,--and her laugh----\"  \"There, there, Kit, I haven't time to listen to your rhapsodies! You're here altogether too early, and you'll have to excuse me, for I have some household matters to look after. Marie isn't quite dressed yet, so you'll have to amuse yourself for awhile. Play some sentimental music on your violin, if that fits your mood.\"  With a kindly smile at her nephew, Mrs. Homer bustled away, and Kit was left alone in the music-room.  He played some soft, low music for a time, and then Marie came in.  \"You're an old goose, Kit,\" she remarked, affectionately, \"to think that mysterious girl of yours will be here to-night. There isn't anybody who knows me well enough to come without an invitation, that I haven't already invited. I've added to my list of invitations until it now numbers about thirty, and that's all the really musical friends I have. If this girl of yours sings as well as you say, she's probably a soubrette or a chorus girl.\"  \"Nothing of the sort!\" Kit exclaimed. \"She's the sweetest, daintiest, refinedest, culturedest little thing you ever saw!\"  \"How do you know? You haven't seen her.\"  \"No, but I've talked with her. I guess I know.\" And Kit turned decidedly sulky, for he began to think it WAS rather doubtful about his seeing his girl that evening.  And then the guests began to arrive, and Mr. Kit put on a smiling face and made himself agreeable to his cousin's friends.  Patty came among the latest arrivals. She looked her prettiest in a filmy gown of pale-blue chiffon, with touches of silver embroidery. An ornament in her hair was of silver filigree, with a wisp of pale-blue feather, and her cheeks were a little pinker than usual.  Kit glanced at her as she came in, and, though he noticed that she was an extremely pretty girl, he immediately glanced away again and continued his watch for the black-eyed girl he expected. The room was well filled by this time, and Patty took a seat near the front, where sat a group of her intimate friends. They greeted her gaily, and Kit, on the other side of the room, paid no attention to them.  The programme began with a duet by Kit on his violin, and his Cousin Marie at the piano.  The man was really a virtuoso, and his beautiful playing held the audience spellbound. Patty watched him, enthralled with his music, and admiring, too, his generally worth-while appearance.  \"He does look awfully jolly,\" she thought, to herself, \"and it's plain to be seen he has brains. I wonder if he will be terribly disappointed in me, after all. I've a notion to run away.\"  For the first time in her life Patty felt shy about singing. Usually she had no trace of self-consciousness, but to-night she experienced a feeling of embarrassment she had never known before. She realized this, and scolded herself roundly for it. \"You idiot!\" she observed, mentally, to her own soul; \"if you want to make a good impression, you'd better stop feeling like a simpleton. Now brace up, and do the best you can, and behave yourself!\"  Miss Curtiss sang before Patty did. She was a sweet-faced young woman, with a beautiful and well-trained contralto voice. Patty cast a furtive glance at Kit Cameron, and found that he was looking intently at the singer. She knew perfectly well he was wondering whether this might be the girl of the telephone conversations, and she saw, too, that he decided in the negative, for he shook his head slightly, but with conviction.  Suddenly the humour of the whole situation struck Patty. The incident was not serious, but humorous, and as soon as she realised this her shyness disappeared, and the spirit of mischief once again took possession of her. She knew now she would do herself credit when she sang, and when her turn came she rose and walked slowly and gracefully to the platform which had been temporarily placed for the musicians.  Marie was to play her accompaniment, and Patty had expected to sing first a somewhat elaborate aria, using \"Beware\" as an encore.  But as she reached the platform, and as she noticed Kit Cameron's face, its expression politely interested, but in no wise enthusiastic, she suddenly changed her mind. She put the music of \"Beware\" on the piano rack, and murmured to Marie, \"This one first.\"  Marie looked puzzled, but of course she couldn't say anything as Patty stood waiting to begin.  For some reason Patty was always at her prettiest when she sang. She thoroughly enjoyed singing, and she enjoyed the evident pleasure it gave to others. She stood gracefully, her hands lightly clasped before her, and the added excitement of this particular occasion gave a flush to her cheek and a sparkle to her blue eyes that made her positively bewitching.  And then she sang the foolish little song, \"Beware,\" just as she had sung it over the telephone, coquettishly, but without artificiality or forced effect.  She scarcely dared look at Kit Cameron. A fleeting glance showed her that he was probably at that moment the most nonplussed young man in existence.  She looked away quickly, lest her voice should falter from amusement.  Luckily, all the audience were regarding Patty attentively, and had no eyes for the astonished face of Kit Cameron. He had taken no special interest in the blonde singer, but when her first notes, rang out he started in surprise. As the voice continued he knew at once it was the same voice he had heard over the telephone, but he couldn't reconcile the facts. He caught the fleeting glance she gave him, he saw the roguish smile in her eyes, and he was forced to believe that this girl was his dark-eyed unknown.  \"The little rascal!\" he said, to himself. \"The scamp! the rogue! How she has tricked me! To think she was Patty Fairfield all the time! No wonder Marie didn't know whom I was talking about! Well!\"  As the song finished no one applauded more enthusiastically than Kit Cameron.  But Patty would not look toward him, and proceeded to sing as an encore the aria she had intended to sing first.

It must be very, very full of plums, you know,\" looking up at him anxiously, \"for Polly dearly loves plums.\"  \"It shall be that plummy,\" said Jefferson convincingly, \"that you'd think you never saw such a one for richness. Oh, my! what a pie that shall be!\" exclaimed the cook, shutting up one eye to look through the other in a spasm of delight at an imaginary pie; \"so it's for Miss Mary, is it?\"  \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, \"it is. Oh, Jefferson, I'm so glad you like to have me make one,\" she clasped her hands in silent rapture, and sat down on the lowest stair to think it over a bit, Jefferson looking at her, forgetful that the under cook was fuming in the deserted domains over his delay to return. At last he said, bowing respectfully, \"If you please, Miss, it's about time to begin. Such a pie ain't done without a deal of care, and we'd best have it a-baking as soon as may be.\"  \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, getting off from her stair, and surrendering her hand to his big black palm, \"we ought to go right this very minute. But I must get my apron on;\" she stopped and looked down at her red dress.  \"Oh! you can take one of my aprons,\" said the cook, \"they're as fine, and big, and white, and I'll just put you in one of 'em and tie you up as snug; you'll come out as clean and sweet when we're through, as you are now, Miss.\"  \"Tie me up?\" laughed Phronsie in glee. \"Oh! how nice, Jefferson. Do you know I love you very much, Jefferson, you're so very good to me?\"  The big fellow drew a long breath. \"No, Miss, I'm big and black, and just fit to stay downstairs,\" he managed to say.  \"But I love you better because you are black, Jefferson,\" insisted Phronsie, \"a great deal better. You are not like everybody else, but you are just yourself,\" clinging to his hand.  \"Well, Miss, I ain't just fit for a lily to touch and that's the truth,\" looking down at his palm that the small white hand grasped closely. \"It's clean, Miss,\" he added with pardonable pride, \"but it's awful black.\"  \"I like it better black, Jefferson,\" said Phronsie again, \"really and truly I do, because then it's your very, very own,\" in a tone that thrilled him much as if a queen had knighted him on the spot.  This important declaration over, the two set forth on their way toward the kitchen, Phronsie clinging to his hand, and chatting merrily over the particular pie in prospect, with varied remarks on pies in general, that by and by would be ventured upon if this present one were a success--and very soon tied up in one of the cook's whitest aprons she was seated with due solemnity at the end of the baking table, the proper utensils and materials in delightful confusion before her, and the lower order of kitchen satellites revolving around her, and Jefferson the lesser sphere.  \"Now all go back to your work,\" said that functionary when he considered the staring and muttered admiration had been indulged in long enough, \"and leave us.\"  \"I want you,\" said his assistant, touching his elbow.  \"Clear out,\" said Jefferson angrily, his face turned quite from Phronsie.  But she caught the tone and immediately laid down the bit of dough she was moulding.  \"Do go,\" she begged, \"and come back quickly,\" smiling up into his face. \"See, I'm going to pat and pat and pat, oh! ever so much before you come back.\"  So Jefferson followed the under cook, the scullery boy went back to cleaning the knives, Susan, the parlor maid who was going through the kitchen with her dustpan and broom, hurried off with a backward glance or two, and Phronsie was left quite alone to hum her way along in her blissful culinary attempt.  \"Bless me!\" exclaimed a voice close to her small ear, as she was attempting for the fifth time to roll out the paste quite as thin as she had seen Jefferson do, \"what is this? Bless my soul! it's Phronsie!\"  Phronsie set down the heavy rolling-pin and turned in her chair with a gleeful laugh.  \"Dear, dear Grandpapa!\" she cried, clasping her floury hands, \"oh! I'm so glad you've come to see me make a pie all by myself. It's for Polly, and it's to be full of plums; Jefferson let me make it.\"  \"Jefferson? And where is he, pray?\" cried Mr. King irately. \"Pretty fellow, to bring you down to these apartments, and then go off and forget you. Jefferson!\" he called sharply, \"here, where are you?\"  \"Oh, Grandpapa!\" exclaimed Phronsie in dire distress, \"I sent him; Jefferson didn't want to go, Grandpapa dear, really and truly, he went because I asked him.\"  \"If you please, sir,\" began Jefferson, hurrying up, \"I only stepped off a bit to the cellar. Bassett sent down a lot of turnips, they ain't first-rate, and\"--  \"All right,\" said Mr. King, cutting him short with a wave of his hand, \"if Miss Phronsie sent you off, it's all right; I don't want to hear any more elaborate explanations.\"  \"Little Miss hasn't been alone but a few minutes,\" said Jefferson in a worried way.  \"And see,\" said Phronsie, turning back to her efforts, while one hand grasped the old gentleman's palm, \"I've almost got it to look like Jefferson's. Almost, haven't I?\" she asked, regarding it anxiously.  \"It will be the most beautiful pie,\" cried Mr. King, a hearty enthusiasm succeeding his irritability, \"that ever was baked. I wish you'd make me one sometime, Phronsie.\"  \"Do you?\" she cried in a tremor of delight, \"and will you really have it on the table, and cut it with Aunt Whitney's big silver knife?\"  \"That I will,\" declared Mr. King solemnly.  \"Then some day I'll come down here again, Jefferson,\" cried Phronsie in a transport, \"and bake one for my dear Grandpapa. That is, if this one is good. Oh! you do suppose it will be good, don't you?\" appealingly at him.  \"It shall,\" said Jefferson stoutly, and seizing the rolling-pin with extreme determination. \"You want a bit more butter worked in, here,\" a dab with skillful fingers, and a little manipulation with the flour, a roll now and then most deftly, and the paste was laid out before Phronsie. \"Now, Miss, you can put it in the dish.\"  \"But is isn't my pie,\" said Phronsie, and, big girl as she felt herself to be, she sat back in her chair, her lower lip quivering.  \"Not your pie?\" repeated the cook, bringing himself up straight to gaze at her.  \"No,\" said Phronsie, shaking her yellow head gravely, \"it isn't my pie now, Jefferson. You put in the things, and rolled it.\"  \"Leave your fingers off from it, can't you?\" cried Mr. King sharply. \"Goodness! this pie isn't to have a professional touch about it. Get some more flour and stuff, whatever it is you make a pie of, and let her begin again. There, I'll sit down and watch you; then there'll be some chance of having things straight.\" So he drew up a chair to the side of the table, first calling off Pete, the scullery boy, from his knives to come and wipe it off for him, and Mrs. Tucker who was in kitchen dialect \"Tucker,\" to see that the boy did his work well.  \"Lor' bless you, sir,\" said Tucker, bestowing a final polish with her apron, \"'twas like satin before, sir--not a wisp of dust.\"  \"I don't want any observations from you,\" said the old gentleman, depositing himself in the chair. \"There, you can go back to your work, Mrs. Tucker, and you too, Pete. Now I'll see that this pie is to your liking, Phronsie.\"  But Phronsie still sat back in her chair, thoughtfully surveying Jefferson.  \"Grandpapa,\" she said at last slowly, \"I think I'd rather have the first pie, I really would, Grandpapa, may I?\" She brought her yellow head forward by a sudden movement, and looked deep into his keen eyes.  \"Bless my soul! Rather have the first pie?\" repeated the old gentleman in astonishment, \"why, I thought you wanted to make one all yourself.\"  \"I think I'd rather do part of it,\" said Phronsie with great deliberateness, \"then Polly'll like it, and eat it, and I'll do yours, Grandpapa dear, just as Jefferson fixed mine, all alone. Please let me.\" She held him fast with her eyes, and waited for his answer.  \"So you shall!\" cried Mr. King in great satisfaction, \"make mine all alone. This one would better go as it is. Put away the flour and things, Jefferson; Miss Phronsie doesn't want them.\"  Phronsie gave a relieved little sigh. \"And, Jefferson, if you hadn't showed me how, I couldn't ever in all this world make Grandpapa's. Now give me the little plate, do.\"  \"Here 'tis, Miss,\" said the cook, all his tremor over the blunder he had made, disappearing, since, after all, things were quite satisfactory. And the little plate forthcoming, Phronsie tucked away the paste lovingly in its depths, and began the important work of concocting the mixture with which the pie was to be filled, Mr. King sitting by with the gravity of a statue, even to the deliberate placing of each plum.  \"Where's Phronsie?\" called a voice above in one of the upper halls.  \"Oh! she's coming, Polly is!\""]]]
