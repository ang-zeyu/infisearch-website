Heb. 11:6 without faith it is impossible to please God. Mark 16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. Rom. 4:16 Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all--[§ I. ¶ 12,13.]  Q. Is faith anything else beside the principle of action?  A. It is.  Q. What is it?  A. It is the principle of power also. [§ I. ¶ 13.]  Q. How do you prove it?  A. First, it is the principle of power in the Deity as well as in man. Heb. 11:3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.--[§ I. ¶ 14,15,16] Secondly, it is the principle of power in man also. Book of Mormon, page 264. Alma and Amulek are delivered from prison. Do. page 421. Nephi and Lehi, with the Lamanites, are immersed with the Spirit. Do. page 565. The mountain Zerin, by the faith of the brother of Jared, is removed. Josh. 10:12 Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still upon Gibeon, and you Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. Josh. 10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. Mat. 17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? Mat. 17:20. And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.--Heb. 11:32 And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets. Heb 11:34 who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance: that they might obtain a better resurrection. [§ I. ¶ 16,17,18,19,20,21,22.]  Q. How would you define faith in its most unlimited sense?  A. It is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things. [§ I. ¶ 24.]  Q. How do you convey to the understanding more clearly that faith is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things?  A. By it they exist, by it they are upheld, by it they are changed, or by it they remain, agreeable to the will of God; and without it there is no power, and without power there could be no creation, nor existence! [§ I. ¶ 24.]    LECTURE SECOND.  Of Faith.  Section II.  1. Having shown in our previous lecture \"faith itself--what it is,\" we shall proceed to show secondly the object on which it rests.  2. We here observe that God is the only supreme governor and independent being, in whom all fullness and perfection dwells; who is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omniscient; without beginning of days or end of life; and that in him every good gift and every good principle dwell; and that he is the Father of lights; In him the principle of faith dwells independently, and he is the object in whom the faith of all other rational and accountable beings center, for life and salvation.  3. In order to present this part of the subject in a clear and conspicuous point of light, it is necessary to go back and show the evidences which mankind have had, and the foundation on which these evidences are, or were based, since the creation, to believe in the existence of a God.  4. We do not mean those evidences which are manifested by the works of creation, which we daily behold with our natural eyes: we are sensible that, after a revelation of Jesus Christ, the works of creation, throughout their vast forms and varieties, clearly exhibit his eternal power and Godhead. Romans 1:20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. But we mean those evidences by which the first thoughts were suggested to the mind of men that there was a God who created all things.  5. We shall now proceed to examine the situation of man at his first creation. Moses, the historian, has given us the following account of him in the first chap. of the book of Genesis, beginning with the 20th verse, and closing with the 30th. We copy from the New Translation:  6. And the Lord God said unto the Only Begotten, who was with him from the beginning, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and it was done.  7. And the Lord God said, Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.  8. So God created man in his own image, in the image of the Only Begotten created he him; male and female created I them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.  9. And I, God, said unto man, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which shall be the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.  10. Again, Genesis 2:15,16,17,19,20: And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God, commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it, nevertheless, you may choose for yourself, for it is given unto you; but remember that I forbid it, for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die.  11. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them. * * * And whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field.  12. From the foregoing we learn man's situation at his first creation; the knowledge with which he was endowed, and the high and exalted station in which he was placed--lord, or governor of all things on earth, and at the same time enjoying communion and intercourse with his Maker, without a vail to separate between. We shall next proceed to examine the account given of his fall, and of his being driven out of the garden of Eden, and from the presence of the Lord.  13. Moses proceeds: And they [Adam and Eve] heard the voice of the Lord God, as they were walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife went to hide themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where goest you? And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I beheld that I was naked, and I hid myself.  14. And the Lord God, said unto Adam, 'Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree whereof I told you you should not eat? If so, you should surely die?' And the man said, The woman whom you gave me, and commanded that she should remain with me, gave me of the fruit of the tree, and I did eat.  15. And I, the Lord God, said unto the woman, What is this thing which you hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  16. And again, the Lord said unto the woman, I will greatly multiply your sorrow, and your conception. In sorrow you shall bring forth children; and your desire shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.  17. And the Lord God said unto Adam, because you have hearkened unto the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the fruit of the tree of which I commanded yous, saying, You shall not eat of it! cursed shall be the ground for your sake; in sorrow you shall eat of it all the days of your life. Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to you: and you shall eat the herb of the field. By the sweat of your face shall you eat bread, until you shall return unto the ground--for you shall surely die--for out of it you were taken: for dust you were, and unto dust you shall return. This was immediately followed by the fulfillment of what we previously said: Man was driven, or sent out of Eden.  18. Two important items are shown from the former quotations: First, after man was created, he was not left without intelligence, or understanding, to wander in darkness and spend an existence in ignorance and doubt--on the great and important point which effected his happiness,--as to the real fact by whom he was created, or unto whom he was amenable for his conduct. God conversed with him face to face: in his presence he was permitted to stand, and from his own mouth he was permitted to receive instruction--he heard his voice, walked before him, and gazed upon his glory--while intelligence burst upon his understanding, and enabled him to give names to the vast assemblage of his Maker's works.  19. Secondly, we have seen, that though man did transgress, his transgression did not deprive him of the previous knowledge with which he was endowed, relative to the existence and glory of his Creator; for no sooner did he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/56684"],["title","The Lectures on Faith (#2)"],["body","his voice, than he sought to hide himself from his presence.  20. Having shown, then, in the first instance, that God began to converse with man, immediately after he \"breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,\" and that he did not cease to manifest himself to him, even after his fall, we shall next proceed to show, that, though he was cast out from the garden of Eden, his knowledge of the existence of God was not lost, neither did God cease to manifest his will unto him.  21. We next proceed to present the account of the direct revelation which man received, after he was cast out of Eden, and further copy from the New Translation:  22. After Adam had been driven out of the garden, he began to till the earth, and to have dominion over all the beasts of the field, and to eat his bread by the sweat of his brow, as I the Lord had commanded him: and he called upon the name of the Lord, and so did Eve his wife also. And they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the garden of Eden, speaking unto them; and they saw him not, for they were shut out from his presence; and he gave unto them commandments that they should worship the Lord their God, and should offer the firstlings of their flocks for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord.  23. And after many days an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam, saying, Why do you offer sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said unto him, I know not; but the Lord commanded me to offer sacrifices.  24. And then the angel said unto him, This thing is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father, who is full of grace and truth. And you shall do all that you do in the name of the Son: and you shall repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forever. And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, and bore record of the Father and the Son.  25. This last quotation, or summary, shows this important fact, that though our first parents were driven out of the garden of Eden, and were even separated from the presence of God, by a vail, they still retained a knowledge of his existence, and that sufficiently to move them to call upon him. And further, that no sooner was the plan of redemption revealed to man, and he began to call upon God, than the Holy Spirit was given, bearing record of the Father and Son.  26. Moses also gives us an account, in the 4th of Genesis, of the transgression of Cain, and the righteousness of Abel, and of the revelations of God to them. He says: In process of time, Cain brought of the fruit of the ground, an offering unto the Lord.--And Abel also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. Now Satan knew this, and it pleased him. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain, Why are you angry? Why is your countenance fallen? If you do well, will you not be accepted?--And if you do not well, sin lieth at the door, and Satan desires to have you; and except you shall hearken unto my commandments, I will deliver you up: and it shall be unto you according to his desire.  27. And Cain went into the field, and talked with his brother Abel. And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him. And Cain gloried in what he had done, saying, I am free; surely the flocks of my brother will now fall into my hands.  28. But the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel, your brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper? And the Lord said, What have you done? the voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground. And now, you shall be cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. When you till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto you her strength. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be in the earth.  29. And Cain said unto the Lord, Satan tempted me because of my brother's flocks. And I was angry: for his offering you accepted and mine was not: My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold you have driven me out this day from the face of men, and from your face shall I be hid also; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass that he that findeth me will slay me because of mine iniquities, for these things are not hid from the Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Therefore, whoever slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him seven fold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.  30. The object of the foregoing quotations is to show to this class the way by which mankind were first made acquainted with the existence of a God: that it was by a manifestation of God to man, and that God continued, after man's transgression to manifest himself to him and to his posterity; and, notwithstanding they were separated from his immediate presence, that they could not see his face, they continued to hear his voice.  31. Adam thus being made acquainted with God, communicated the knowledge which he had unto his posterity; and it was through this means that the thought was first suggested to their minds that there was a God. Which laid the foundation for the exercise of their faith, through which they could obtain a knowledge of his character and also of his glory.  32. Not only was there a manifestation made unto Adam of the existence of a God, but Moses informs us, as before quoted, that God condescended to talk with Cain after his great transgression, in slaying his brother, and that Cain knew that it was the Lord that was talking with him: so that when he was driven out from the presence of his brethren, he carried with him the knowledge of the existence of a God; and, through this means, doubtless, his posterity became acquainted with the fact that such a being existed.  33. From this we can see that the whole human family, in the early age of their existence, in all their different branches, had this knowledge disseminated among them; so that the existence of God became an object of faith, in the early age of the world. And the evidences which these men had of the existence of a God, was the testimony of their fathers in the first instance.  34. The reason why we have been thus particular on this part of our subject, is that this class may see by what means it was that God became an object of faith among men after the fall; and what it was that stirred up the faith of multitudes to feel after him; to search after a knowledge of his character, perfections and attributes, until they became extensively acquainted with him; and not only commune with him, and behold his glory, but be partakers of his power and stand in his presence.  35. Let this class mark particularly that the testimony which these men had of the existence of a God, was the testimony of man; for previous to the time that any of Adam's posterity had obtained a manifestation of God to themselves, Adam their common father had testified unto them of the existence of God, and of his eternal power and Godhead.  36. For instance, Abel, before he received the assurance from heaven that his offerings were acceptable unto God, had received the important information of his father that such a being did exist, who had created and who did uphold all things. Neither can there be a doubt existing on the mind of any person, that Adam was the first who did communicate the knowledge of the existence of a God, to his posterity; and that the whole faith of the world, from that time down to the present, is in a certain degree, dependent on the knowledge first communicated to them by their common progenitor; and it has been handed down to the day and generation in which we live, as we shall show from the face of the sacred records.  37. First, Adam was 130 years old when Seth was born. Genesis 5:3. And the days of Adam, after he had begotten Seth, were 800 years; making him 930 years old when he died. Genesis 5:4,5. Seth was 105 when Enos was born. 5:6. Enos was 90 when Cainan was born. 5:9. Cainan was 70 when Mahalaleel was born. 5:12. Mahalaleel was 65 when Jared was born. 5:15. Jared was 162 when Enoch was born. 5:18. Enoch was 65 when Methuselah was born. 5:21. Methuselah was 187 when Lamech was born. 5:25. Lamech was 182 when Noah was born. 5:28.  38. From this account it appears that Lamech, the 9th from Adam, and the father of Noah, was 56 years old when Adam died; Methuselah, 243; Enoch, 308; Jared, 470; Mahalaleel, 535; Cainan, 605; Enos, 695; and Seth, 800.  39. So that Lamech the father of Noah; Methuselah, Enoch, Jared, Mahalaleel, Cainan, Enos, Seth, and Adam, were all living at the same time, and beyond all controversy, were all preachers of righteousness.  40. Moses further informs us, that Seth lived, after he begat Enos, 807 years, making him 912 years old at his death. Genesis 5:7,8. And Enos lived, after he begat Cainan, 815 years, making him 905 years old when he died. 5:10,11. And Cainan lived, after he begat Mahalaleel, 840 years: making him 910 years old at his death. 5:13,14. And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared, 830 years, making him 895 years old when he died. 5:16,17. And Jared lived after he begat Enoch, 800 years, making him 962 years old at his death. 5:19,20. And Enoch walked with God, after he begat Methuselah 300 years: making him 365 years old when he was translated. 5:22,23. And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech, 782 years, making him 969 years old when he died 5:26,27. Lamech lived after he begat Noah, 595 years; making him 777 years old when he died. 5:30,31.  41. Agreeably to this account, Adam died in the 930th year of the world; Enoch was translated in the 987th, Seth died in the 1042nd; Enos in the 1140th; Cainan in the 1235th; Mahalaleel in the 1290th; Jared in the 1422nd; Lamech in the 1651st; and Methuselah in the 1656th, it being the same year in which the flood came."]]]
