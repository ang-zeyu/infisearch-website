He paid for his board partly by work in the shop, and partly by doing chores. This brings us to the day when the conversation detailed in the first chapter took place.  On the following morning Ben was sent on an errand to the village store. On his way he overtook Deacon Pitkin.  \"Good mornin', Ben!\" said the deacon. \"Where are you goin'?\"  \"To the store, sir.\"  \"So am I. Ef you ain't in a hurry, le'ss walk along together.\"  \"All right, sir,\" answered Ben. \"I think I know what's comin,\" he said to himself.  \"You're stayin' at your Uncle Job's, ain't you?\" asked Deacon Pitkin.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You don't calc'late to keep on there, do you?\"  \"No, sir; he would like to have me stay and work in the shop, but I don't fancy shoemaking.\"  \"Jest so. I wouldn't ef I was you. It's an onsartin business. There's nothin' like farmin' for stiddy work.\"  \"The old man kept me at work pretty stiddy,\" thought Ben. \"He'd always find something for me to do.\"  \"'Ive been thinkin' that I need a boy about your age to help me on my farm. I ain't so young as I was, and I've got a crick in my back. I don't want a man-\"  \"You'd have to pay him too high wages,\" Ben said to himself.  \"A strong, capable boy like you could give me all the help I need.\"  \"I expect I could,\" said Ben demurely.  \"I was sayin' to Mrs. Pitkin this mornin' that I thought it would be a good plan to take you till you was twenty-one.\"  \"What did she say?\" asked Ben, interested.  \"Waal, she didn't say much,\" answered the deacon slowly; \"but I guess she hasn't no objections.\"  \"Didn't she say that I had an awful appetite?\" asked Ben, smiling.  \"She said you was pretty hearty,\" answered the deacon, rather surprised at Ben's penetration. \"Boys should curb their appetites.\"  \"I don't think I could curb mine,\" said Ben thoughtfully.  \"I guess there wouldn't be any trouble about that,\" returned the deacon, whose meanness ran in a different channel from his wife's, and who took less note of what was eaten at his table. \"Ef you think you'd like to engage, and we could make a bargain, you might begin next week.\"  \"Jest so,\" said Ben.  The deacon looked at him rather sharply, but Ben didn't appear to intend any disrespect in repeating his favorite phrase.  \"Did your father leave you much?\" inquired Deacon Pitkin.  \"A few hundred dollars,\" said Ben carelessly.  \"Indeed!\" said the deacon, gratified. \"What are you goin' to do with it?\"  \"Uncle Job thinks it would be best to put it in the bank.\"  \"Jest so. It would fetch you some interest every year-enough to clothe you, likely. I'll tell you what I'll do, Ben. I'll give you your board the first year, and your interest will buy your clothes. The second year I'll give you twenty dollars and board, and maybe twenty more the third year.\"  Ben shook his head.  \"I guess we can't make a bargain, Deacon Pitkin,\" he said.  Deacon Pitkin knew that he had made a very mean offer, and felt that he could afford to increase it somewhat; but he was a close hand at a bargain, and meant to get Ben as cheap as he could.  \"What was you expectin'?\" he asked cautiously. \"You must remember that you're only a boy, and can't expect men's wages.\"  Ben had no idea, as we know, of engaging to work for Deacon Pitkin at all; but he decided that the easiest way to avoid it was to put such a value on his services as to frighten the old man.  \"I am almost as strong as a man,\" he said, \"and I can earn a great deal more than my board the first year.\"  \"I might be willin' to give you twenty dollars the first year,\" said the deacon.  \"I've been thinking,\" said Ben soberly, \"that I ought to have a hundred and fifty dollars and board the first year.\"  Deacon Pitkin fairly gasped for breath. He was fairly overpowered by Ben's audacity.  \"A-hundred-and-fifty-dollars!\" he ejaculated, turning his wrinkled face toward our hero.  \"That's about the figure,\" said Ben cheerfully. \"A hundred and fifty dollars and board, or three hundred dollars, and I'll board with my uncle.\"  \"Is the boy crazy?\" asked the deacon, in a bewildered tone.  \"You'd have to pay a man as much as twenty dollars a month,\" pursued Ben. \"That's about a hundred dollars a year more.\"  \"Benjamin,\" said the deacon solemnly, \"do you want to ruin me?\"  \"No, sir, I hope not,\" answered our hero innocently.  \"Then why do you ask such an unheard-of price?\"  \"I think I'm worth it,\" said Ben.  \"Boys haven't much jedgment,\" said the deacon. \"You'd better let me talk over this matter with your Uncle Job.\"  \"It won't be any use, Deacon Pitkin. Uncle Job won't interfere with me.\"  \"You can't get such wages anywhere. You'll have to work for less.\"  \"Perhaps I can't get my price in Hampton,\" said Ben.  \"Of course you can't. There ain't no one goin' to pay you men's wages.\"  \"Perhaps you are right, Deacon Pitkin. In that case, my mind is made up.\"  \"What will you do?\" asked the deacon, showing some curiosity.  \"I'll leave town.\"  \"It's a resky thing, Benjamin. You ain't old enough to take care of yourself.\"  \"I think I can do it. Deacon Pitkin. I am not afraid to try. Still, if you'll give me a hundred and fifty dollars and board--\"  \"You must think I'm crazy,\" said the deacon hastily. \"I don't throw money away that way.\"  \"Then I'm afraid we can't make a bargain, deacon. Here is the store, and I'll bid you good morning.\"  \"If you think better of my offer, you can let me know, Benjamin. You can talk it over with your uncle.\"  \"All right, sir. If you think better of mine, just let me know within a week, or I may be gone from Hampton.\"  \"That's a cur'us boy,\" said the deacon meditatively. \"He's got the most conceited idea of his vally to work of any boy I ever came across. A hundred and fifty dollars and board! What'll Mrs. Pitkin say when I tell her? She ain't much sot on the boy's comin' anyway. She thinks he's too hearty; but I don't mind that, so much. He's strong and good to work, an' he's the only boy in town that would suit me.\"  \"I wonder what the deacon thinks of me,\" soliloquized Ben. \"I thought I should scare him a little when I named my price. If I'd thought he would take me at that figure, I'd have said more. It wouldn't suit me to work for him at all.\"  In the evening Deacon Pitkin came over to see Job Stanton, and renewed his offer for Ben's services.  \"The boy's got wild idees about pay,\" he said; \"but boys haven't much jedgment. You're a sensible man, Mr. Stanton, and you and me can make a fair bargain.\"  \"It won't be of much use, Deacon Pitkin. Ben's got his idees, an' he sticks to 'em.\"  \"But you're his uncle. You can make him see his true interest.\"  \"Ben's young,\" said Job, suspending his work; \"but he's got to look out for himself. He may make mistakes, but I've promised not to interfere. I've got confidence in him that he'll come out right in the end. Truth is, deacon, he don't want to work at farmin', and that's why he asked you such a steep price. He knew you wouldn't agree to give it.\"  This put the matter in a new light, and Deacon Pitkin reluctantly concluded that he must abandon the idea of obtaining Ben as a helper on his farm.     CHAPTER III.  SAM STURGIS' NEW IDEA.   During the week which Ben had agreed to take before coming to a final decision, he had another offer of employment.  This is how it came about:  A little out of the village, in a handsome house, the best in Hampton, lived Major Sturgis, a wealthy landholder, who had plenty to live upon and nothing in particular to do, except to look after his property. He was a portly man, who walked with a slow, dignified step, leaning on a gold-headed cane, and evidently felt his importance. His son, Sam, was a chip of the old block. He condescended to associate with the village boys, because solitary grandeur is not altogether pleasant. He occasionally went to New York to visit a cousin of about his own age. From such a visit he had just returned, bringing back with him a new idea.  \"Father,\" he said, \"Cousin Henry has a boy about his own age to wait on him, black his boots, and run errands.\"  \"Has he?\" asked the major mechanically, not looking up from the daily paper which he was reading.  \"Yes, sir. He don't pay him much, you know, only five dollars a month and his board, and Henry finds it very convenient.\"  Major Sturgis did not reply. In fact, he was too much interested in the article he was reading.  \"Ain't you as rich as uncle?\" asked Sam, who was gradually leading up to his proposal.  \"Yes, Sam, I think so,\" answered his father, laying down the paper and removing his gold-bowed spectacles.  \"Then why won't you let me have a servant, too?\"  \"What do you want of a servant? There are servants enough in the house.\"  \"I want a boy to follow me round, and do just what I bid him.\"  \"I don't see any necessity for it.\"  \"He could do errands for you, too, father,\" said Sam diplomatically.  \"We would have to send to the city for a boy, in case I let you have one.\"  \"No, we wouldn't,\" answered Sam.  \"Do you know of any one around here?\"  \"Yes; there is Ben Stanton. He's got to find something to do.\"  \"I thought you didn't like Ben Stanton,\" said the major, in some surprise. \"I have heard you say-\"  \"Oh, he's rather uppish-feels too big for a poor boy; but I would soon train him. I'd make him know his place.\"  \"Your remarks are well founded, my son. Only yesterday I met the boy on the village street, and instead of taking off his hat and making a low bow, as he should do to a man of my position, he nodded carelessly, and said. 'How are you, major?' Really, I don't know what the country is coming to, when the rising generation is so deficient in veneration.\"  \"The fact is, father, Ben thinks himself as good as anybody. You'd think, by the way he speaks to me, that he considered himself my equal.\"  \"That is one of the evils incident to a republican form of government,\" said the major"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5623"],["title","The Young Explorer; Or, Claiming His Fortune (#2)"],["body",". \"For my part, I prefer the English social system, where the gentry are treated with proper deference.\"  \"Well, father, may I engage Ben as my servant?\"  \"I am afraid you would not find him properly subordinate.\"  \"Just leave that to me,\" said Sam confidently. \"If I can't teach him his place, then nobody can. I should enjoy having him to order about.\"  Sam generally carried his point with his father, and the present instance was no exception.  \"I don't know that I have any particular objection,\" said the major.  \"How much wages may I offer, father?\"  \"The same that your Cousin Henry's servant gets.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Sam, with satisfaction. \"I guess I'll go round, and see him about it this afternoon. I suppose he can come any time?\"  \"Yes, my son.\"  As Sam went out of the room his father thought, complacently:  \"My son has all the pride and instincts of a gentleman. He will do credit to the family.\"  Few persons in the village would have agreed with the major. Sam Sturgis was decidedly unpopular. No boy who puts on airs is likely to be a favorite with any class of persons, and Sam put on rather more than he was entitled to. From time to time he received a rebuff, but still money will tell. He had his followers and sycophants, but we may be sure that Ben was not numbered among them. It was quite useless for Sam to patronize him-he would not be patronized, but persisted in treating the major's son with the most exasperating familiarity. Of course this would be impossible if he became Sam's servant, and this more than anything else was the motive of the young aristocrat in wishing to engage him. As to conferring a favor on Ben, that was the last thing in his thoughts.  Sam bent his steps toward the humble home of Job Stanton, but he did not have to go the whole distance. He met Ben with a fishing-pole over his shoulder.  \"How are you, Sam?\" was Ben's familiar greeting. \"Want to go fishing with me?\"  \"He's entirely too familiar,\" thought Sam. \"I'll cure him of that when he is under my orders.\"  At present Sam did not think it politic to express his feelings on the subject. Ben was so independent that it might frustrate his plan.  \"I will walk along with you, Ben,\" said Sam condescendingly.  \"All right. Haven't you got a fishing-pole at home?\"  \"Yes, I have a very handsome one; it cost five dollars.\"  \"Then it's rather ahead of mine,\" said Ben.  \"I should say so,\" remarked Sam, surveying Ben's pole with contempt.  \"But I'll bet you can't catch as many fish with it,\" said Ben promptly. \"I don't think it makes much difference to the fish,\" he added, with a laugh, \"whther they are caught with a five-dollar pole or a five-cent one.\"  \"Very likely,\" said Sam briefly, \"but I prefer to use a nice pole.\"  \"Oh, there's no objection,\" said Ben, \"if you fancy it. It doesn't make any difference to me.\"  \"When are you going to work?\" asked Sam abruptly.  \"I am working every day-that is, I am helping Uncle Job.\"  \"But I suppose you mean to get regular work somewhere, don't you?\"  \"What's he after, I wonder?\" thought Ben. \"Maybe I do,\" he said aloud.  \"Perhaps I can throw something in your way,\" said Sam, in a patronizing way.  \"You are very kind,\" said Ben, who supposed Sam had heard of some business position which he could fill. Our hero decided that perhaps he had misjudged the major's son, and he was prepared to make amends. \"If you get me a position, I shall be much obliged.\"  \"The fact is,\" said Sam, \"I should find it convenient to have a boy go about with me, and be at my orders. My Cousin Henry has one, and father says I may engage you.\"  Ben faced round, and looked steadily at Sam. He felt that he would far rather work for Deacon Pitkin, in spite of his meager table, or toil twelve hours a day in his uncle's shoe-shop, than accept such a place as was now offered him. He penetrated Sam's motive, and felt incensed with him, though he did not choose to show it.  \"What are you willing to pay?\" asked Ben, in a businesslike tone.  \"Five dollars a month and your board,\" said Sam. \"You'll live better than you ever did before in your life, and your duties will be easy.\"  \"What would you want me to do?\" asked Ben.  \"Why, I would take you with me whenever I went out rowing or fishing. That would be easy enough. Then, in the morning you would black my shoes and keep my clothes well brushed, and go of any errands I had for you. Oh, well, I can't tell you all you would have to do, but you'd have an easy time.\"  \"Yes, I don't think it would tire me out,\" said Ben. \"You'd want me to black your boots?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I might agree to that on one condition.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"That you would black mine.\"  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Sam, his face flushing angrily.  \"Just what I say.\"  \"Do you mean to insult me?\"  \"Not a bit; any more than you mean to insult me,\"  \"Do you dare to propose that I, a gentleman, should black your low-lived shoes?\" exclaimed Sam furiously.  \"I think you're rather hard on my shoes,\" said Ben, laughing. \"I'll come for four dollars a month, if you'll do that.\"  \"I never heard such impudence,\" said Sam, in concentrated wrath. \"I never was so repaid for kindness before.\"  \"Look here, Sam,\" said Ben, \"I understand just how kind you are. You want the satisfaction of ordering me round, and you can't have it. I decline your offer. I'd rather beg for bread than accept it.\"  \"You may starve, for all me,\" said Sam. \"It's ridiculous for a poor boy to put on such airs. You'll die in the poorhouse yet.\"  \"I won't live there, if I can help it. What! are you going to leave me?\"  \"I won't condescend to be seen with you.\"  \"Good-by, Sam. I hope you won't have to black your own boots.\"  Sam did not deign a reply.  \"He looks mad,\" thought Ben. \"I'd live on one meal a day rather than let him order me round.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A BRILLIANT CHANCE.   The week was over, and Ben persisted in his determination to leave Hampton.  \"I'm sorry you are going, Ben,\" said his Cousin Jennie. \"I shall miss you awfully.\"  As Jennie was the prettiest girl in the village, though she did not inherit any good looks from her plain-looking father, Ben was gratified.  \"You'd forget me soon,\" he said.  \"No, I won't.\"  \"Especially when Sam Sturgis comes round to see you.\"  \"I don't want to see him. He's a stuck-up boy, and thinks himself too good to associate with common people.\"  \"He wanted to have me black his boots,\" said Ben.  \"He isn't fit to black yours,\" said Jennie energetically.  \"Oh, yes, he is,\" said Ben, laughing. \"That's where you and I disagree.\"  \"I guess we both mean about the same thing,\" said Jennie, who saw the point.  Ben's resolve to go to California was modified by an advertisement in a New York daily paper which he saw at the village tavern.  It ran thus:  \"Wanted, six boys, from fifteen to eighteen years of age, to fill positions of trust. Ten dollars per week will be paid; but a deposit of fifty dollars is required as a guarantee of honesty. This sum will be repaid at the close of term of service. Address Fitch & Perguson, No.--Nassau Street.\"  This advertisement looked quite attractive to Ben. He copied it, and showed it to Uncle Job.  \"Isn't that a good chance, Uncle Job?\" he said. \"Just think! Ten dollars a week!\"  \"You'd have to pay your board out of it,\" said his uncle.  \"I know that, but my board wouldn't cost more than four dollars a week. That would leave me six.\"  \"So it would. I declare it does seem to be a good chance. Maybe they've got all the boys they want.\"  \"Why, you see, uncle, there's a good many boys that couldn't pay the deposit money. That would limit the number of applicants. Now, I have the money, and I guess I'd better write to New York at once about it.\"  \"Maybe you had, Ben.\"  Ben immediately procured a sheet of paper and wrote to the advertisers, stating that he would like the position, and assuring them of his ability to furnish the required sum. The letter went to New York by the afternoon mail.  Naturally Ben was a little excited and suffered a little from suspense. He feared that all the places would be filled, and such another chance was hardly to be expected again very soon. However, on Monday morning he was gratified by the receipt of the following letter:  \"No.--NASSAU STREET, NEW YORK.  \"MR. BENJAMIN STANTON: Your letter of yesterday is at hand. Fortunately we have one vacancy, the other places being already filled. We have rejected three applicants for it on account of unsatisfactory penmanship. Yours, however, is up to the mark, and we will engage you on the strength of it. It will be necessary for you to report as soon as possible at our office for duty. We require the deposit on account of the sums of money which you will handle. We do not doubt your honesty, but it seems desirable that you should furnish a guarantee, particularly as we pay a much larger salary than is usually given to young clerks.  \"Yours respectfully,  \"FITCH & FERGUSON.  \"P. S. Your engagement will not commence until the fifty dollars are in our hands.\"  Ben was quite elated by his success.  \"I must start to-morrow morning,\" he said, \"or I shall be in danger of losing the place.\"  \"It seems very sudden,\" said his aunt. \"I am afraid I sha'n't have time to get your clothes ready. Some are dirty, and others need mending. If I'd had a little notice-\"  \"It won't make any difference, Aunt Sarah,\" said Ben. \"I'll take a few clothes in a carpetbag, and you can send the rest by express when they are ready.\"  \"Yes, Sarah, that will be the best way,\" said Uncle Job. \"Ben don't want to run the risk of losing the place by delay.\"  Mrs. Stanton acquiesced rather unwillingly, and for the remainder of the day Ben was busy making preparations to leave his country home.     CHAPTER V.  IN SEARCH OF A PLACE.   Ben took the early train to New York on Tuesday morning, and in due time arrived in the city. He carried with him seventy-five dollars out of his small patrimony. Fifty were to be deposited with Messrs. Fitch & Ferguson, as"]]]
