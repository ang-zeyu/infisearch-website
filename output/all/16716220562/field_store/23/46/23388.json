I don't intend to go to jug again, and that is all there is to it.\"  \"Maybe you can't help yourself.\"  \"We'll see about that.  Are you--going to keep off or not?  \"Don't ask foolish a question.\"  \"You won't keep off?\"  \"No.\"  \"If you don't I--I'll shoot you.\"  As Dan Baxter spoke he stopped rowing and brought from a hip pocket a highly polished nickel-plated revolver.  \"Do you see this?\" he demanded, as he pointed the weapon toward the Rover boys.  Both Dick and Tom were taken aback at the sight of the weapon. But they had seen such arms before, and had faced them, consequently they were not as greatly alarmed as they right otherwise have been.  They knew, too, that Dan Baxter was a notoriously bad shot.  \"Put that up, Baxter,\" said Dick calmly.  \"It may only get you into deeper trouble.\"  \"I don't care!\" said the bully recklessly.  \"I'm not going back to jail and that is all there, is to it!\"  \"You won't dare to shoot at us, and you know it,\" put in Tom, as the two boats drifted closer together.  \"I will, and don't you fool yourself on it.\"  \"Drop those oars or I'll fire, as sure as my name is Dan Baxter,\" and the revolver, which had been partly lowered, was raised a second time.  It must be confessed that Dick and Tom were much disconcerted. The two rowboats were now less than fifty feet apart, and any kind of a shot from the weapon was likely to prove more or less dangerous.  Baxter's eyes gleamed with the hatred of an angry snake ready to strike.  \"You think you are smart, you Rover boys,\" said the bully, after an awkward pause all around.  \"You think you did a big thing in rescuing Dora Stanhope and in putting me and my father and Buddy Girk in prison.  But let me tell you that this game hasn't come to an end yet, and some day we intend to square accounts.\"  \"There is no use in wasting breath in this fashion, Baxter,\" returned Dick, as calmly as he could.  \"We are two to one, and the best thing to do is for you to submit.  If you fire on us, we may do a little shooting on our own account.\"  \"Humph!  Do you imagine you can scare me in that fashion?  You haven't any pistol, and I know it.  If you had you would have drawn the weapon long ago.\"  At this Dick bit his lip.  \"Don't be too sure,\" he said steadily, as the boats drifted still closer together.  \"The minute I heard you had escaped from jail I went and bought a pistol in Cedarville.\"  This was the strict truth, but Dick did not add that the weapon lay at that moment safe in the bottom of his trunk at the Hall.  \"Got afraid I'd come around, eh?\"  \"I knew there was nothing like becoming prepared.  Now will you--\"  Dick did not have time to finish, for, lowering the front end of the pistol, Dan Baxter pulled the trigger twice and two reports rang out in quick succession.  One bullet buried itself in the seat beside Tom, while the second plowed its way through the bottom, near the stern.  \"You villain!\" cried Dick, and in his excitement hurled his oar at Dan Baxter, hitting the fellow across the fact with such force that the bully's nose began to bleed.  The shock made Baxter lose his hold on the pistol and it went over the side of his craft and sank immediately to the bottom of the lake.  \"My, but that was a close shave!\" muttered Tom, as he gazed at the hole through the seat.  \"A little closer and I would have got it in the stomach.\"  A yell now came from Sam, and a shriek from the girls, all of whom had heard the pistol shots.  They were too far away to see the result of the shooting and feared both Tom and Dick had been killed or wounded.  As quickly as he could recover from the blow of the oar, Dan Baxter picked up his own blades, and without paying attention to the blood which was flowing from his nose, began once again to pull for the shore.  \"Come on, his pistol is gone!\" shouted Dick, and then his face fell. \"Confound it, I've thrown away my oar!  There it goes!\"  And he pointed some distance to their left.  \"That isn't the worst of it!\" groaned Tom. \"Look at that hole in the bottom, made by that pistol shot.  The water is coming in just as fast as it can.\"  There was small need to call attention to it, for the water in the bottom of the boat was already an inch deep.  Dick started in perplexity, then, struck by a sudden idea, drew a lead pencil from his pocket and rammed it into the opening.  It fitted very well, and the water ceased, to come in.  \"Now we'll have to bail out and pick up that other oar,\" said Tom. \"It was foolish to throw it away, Dick.\"  \"I don't know about that.  It deprived Baxter of his pistol. Paddle over, and I'll pick it up.\"  Tom did so, and the blade was speedily recovered.  But Dan Baxter had made good use of the precious moments lost by the Rover boys, and hardly were the latter into shape for rowing once more than they saw the bully beach his craft and leap out on the shore.  \"Good-by to you!\" he cried mockingly.  \"I told you that you couldn't catch me.  The next time we meet I'll make you sorry that you ever followed me,\" and he started to run off with all possible speed.  Tom and Dick were too chagrined to answer him, and pulled forward to the shore in silence.  They ran the craft into some bushes and tied up, and then started after Baxter, who was now making for the woods south of the village of Nelson.  When the highway skirting this portion of Cayuga Lake was gained Dan Baxter was a good five hundred feet ahead of them.  A turn in the road soon hid him from view.  Gaining the bend they discovered that he had disappeared from view altogether.  \"He has taken to the woods,\" sighed Dick.  \"If that is so we may as well give the hunt up,\" answered his brother.  \"It would be worse than looking for a pin in a haystack, for we wouldn't know what direction he had taken.\"  \"I wish I had a bloodhound with which to trail him.  He ought to be run down, Tom.\"  \"Well, let us notify some of the people living near and see what can be done.\"  They ran on to the spot where they supposed Baxter had left the highway.  On both sides were dense thickets of cedars with heavy underbrush.  All in all, the locality formed an ideal hiding place.  Night was coming on by the time they gained the nearest farmhouse. Here they found three men, to whom they explained the situation. All of the men smiled grimly.  \"If he went into the woods it would be a hard job to trail him,\" was the comment from Farmer Mason.  \"If he ain't careful he'll lose himself so completely he'll never git out, b'gosh!\"  \"Well, I don't know but what that would suit me,\" responded Tom dryly.  The search was begun, and several others joined in.  It lasted until night was fairly upon the party and was then given up in disgust.  \"It's no use,\" said Dick.  \"He has slipped us!\"  \"But we ought to notify the authorities,\" said Tom.  \"They will probably put a detective on his track.\"  \"Yes; but a detective can't do any more than we can, up in this wild locality.\"  \"He won't remain in the woods forever.  He'll starve to death.\"  \"Well, we can send the police a telegram from Cedarville.\"  This was done, and the Rover boys returned to Putnam Hall by way of the side road leaving past the homes of the Stanhopes and the Lanings.  They found Sam and the girls very anxious concerning their welfare.  \"We were afraid you had been shot,\" said Dora.  \"I am thankful that you escaped.\"  \"So am I,\" put in Sam.  \"But it's too bad that Baxter got away.  I wonder where he will turn up next.\"  They all wondered, but could not even venture an answer.  Soon the boys left the girls and hurried to the academy, where their story, had to be told over again.  Captain Putnam looked exceedingly grave over the narrative.  \"You must be careful in the future, lads,\" he said.  \"Remember, you are in my care here.  I do not know what your uncle would say if anything should happen to you.\"  \"We will be on our guard in the future,\" answered Dick.  \"But I am awfully sorry we didn't catch him.\"  \"So am I.  But perhaps the authorities will have better luck,\" and there the talk came to an end, and the boys retired for the night.     CHAPTER V  FUN AND AN EXPLOSION   Several days slipped by, and the boys waited anxiously for some news from the authorities.  But none came, and they rightfully surmised that, for the time being, Dan Baxter had made good his escape.  On account of the disastrous ending to the kite-flying match, many had supposed that the feast in Dormitory No. 6 was not to come off, but Sam, Tom, Frank, and several others got their heads together and prepared for a \"layout\" for the following Wednesday, which would be Dick's birthday.  \"We'll give him a surprise,\" said Sam, and so it was agreed. Passing around the hat netted exactly three dollars and a quarter, and Tom, Sam, and Fred Garrison were delegated to purchase the candies, cake, and ice cream which were to constitute the spread.  \"We'll do the thing up brown,\" said Sam.  \"We must strike higher than that feast we had, last year.\"  \"Right you are!\" came from Tom, \"Oh dear, do you remember how we served Mumps that night!\" and he set up a roar over the remembrance of the scene.  Hans Mueller had become one of the occupants of the dormitory, and he was as much, interested as anybody in the preparations for the spread. \"Dot vill pe fine!\" he said.  \"I like to have von feast twist a veek, ha I ha!  \"He's a jolly dog,\" said Tom to Frank.  \"But, say, I've been thinking of having some fun with him before this spread comes off.\"  \"Let me in on the ground floor,\" pleaded Frank, who always wok a great interest in Tom's jokes.  \"I will, on one condition, Frank.\"  \"And what is that?\"  \"That you loan me that masquerade suit you have in your trunk. The one you used at that New Year's dance at home.\"  \"You mean that Indian rig?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Hullo, I reckon I smell a mouse!\" laughed the senator's son.  \"I heard you giving Hans that yarn about us training to fight Indians.\"'  \"Did you indeed.\"  \"I did indeed; and I heard Hans say "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5770"],["title","The Rover Boys in the Jungle; Or, Stirring Adventures in Africa (#4)"],["body","he wanted nothing to do with the Indians.\"  \"Well, he's going to have something to do with at least one Indian,\" grinned Tom.  \"What do you say I get the suit?\"  \"Yes; if you'll fix it so that I can see the sport.\"  \"All of the crowd can see it, if they don't leak about it,\" returned the fun-loving Rover.  Tom soon had the masquerade suit in his possession and also, some face paints which Frank had saved from the New Year's dance mentioned. Shortly afterward Tom joined the crowd in the gymnasium, where Hans Mueller was trying to do some vaulting over the bars.  \"I dink I could chump dem sticks of I vos taller,\" the German youth was saying.  \"Or the sticks were lower,\" replied Tom, with a wink at the crowd. \"That's right, Hans, you had better learn how to jump now, and to run, too.\"  \"The Indians have come,\" put in Frank.  \"Indians?\" repeated Hans Mueller.  \"Vere is da?\"  \"They say a band of them are in the woods around here,\" answered Tom.  \"If you go out you want to be careful or they may scalp you.\"  \"Cracious, Rofer, ton't say dot!\" cried Mueller in alarm.  \"Vot is dem Indians doing here annavay?\"  \"They came in East to hunt up some buffalo that got away.  They had something like half a million in a corral, and about two thousand got away from them.\"  This preposterous announcement was taken by Hans Mueller in all seriousness, and he asked Tom all sorts of ridiculous questions about the savage red men, whom he supposed as wild and wily as those of generations ago.  \"No, I ton't vonts to meet any of dem,\" he said at last.  \"Da vos von pad lot alretty!\"  \"That's right, Hans, you give them a wide berth,\" said Tom, and walked away.  Later on Tom persuaded Dick to ask Hans if he would not walk down to Cedarville for him, to buy him a baseball.  Eager to be accommodating, the German youth received the necessary permission to leave the academy acres and hurried off at the full speed of his sturdy legs.  \"Now for some fun!\" cried Tom, and ran off for the Indian suit and the face paints.  These he took down to the bam and set to work to transform himself into a wild-looking red man.  \"You're a lively one!\" grinned Peleg Snuggers, who stood watching him.  \"We never had such a lad as you before Master Thomas.\"  \"Thanks, Peleg, and perhaps you'll never have one like me again--and then you'll be dreadfully sorry.\"  \"Or glad,\" murmured Peleg.  \"Mum's the word, old man.\"  \"Oh, I never say nuthin, Master Thomas; you know that,\" returned the man-of-all-work.  A number of the other pupils had been let into the secret, and, led by Dick, they ran off to the woods lining the Cedarville road. Tom came after them, skulking along that nobody driving by might catch sight of him.  Not quite an hour later Hans Mueller was heard coming back.  The German boy was humming to himself and at the same time throwing up the new ball he had purchased for Dick.  \"Burra!  Burra!\" thundered out Tom, as he leaped from behind a big tree.  \"Dutcha boy heap big scalp-me take um!  Burra!\"  And he danced up to Hans, flourishing a big tin knife as he did so.  The masquerade was a perfect one, and he looked like an Indian who had just stepped forth from some Wild West show.  \"Ach du!\" screamed Hans, as he stopped short and grew white. \"It's dem Indians come to take mine hair!  Oh, please, Mister Indian, ton't vos touch me!\"  \"Dutcha boy heap nice hair,\" continued Tom, drawing nearer.  \"Maka nice door-mat for Big Wolf.  Burra!\"  \"No, no; ton't vos touch mine hair-it vos all der hair I vos got!\" howled Hans.  \"Please, Mister Indian mans, let me go!\"  And then he started to back away.  \"White bay stop or Big Wolf shoot!\" bellowed Tom, drawing forth a rusty pistol he had picked up in the barn.  This rusty pistol had done lots of duty at fun-making before.  \"No, no; ton't shoot!\" screamed Hans.  Then he fell on his knees in despair.  Tom could scarcely keep from laughing at the sight, and a snicker or two could be heard coming from where Frank, Dick, and the others were concealed behind the bushes.  But the German youth was too terrorized to notice anything but that awful red man before him, with his hideous war-paint of blue and yellow.  \"Dutcha boy dance for Big Wolf,\" went on Tom.  \"Dance!  Dance or Big Wolf shoot!\"  And the fun-loving Rover set the pace in a mad, caper that would have done credit to a Zulu.  \"I can't vos dance!\" faltered Hans, and then, thinking he might appease the wrath of his unexpected enemy he began to caper about in a clumsy fashion which was comical in the extreme.  \"Hoopla! keep it up!\" roared Tom.  \"Dutcha boy take the cake for flingin' hees boots.  Faster, faster, or Big Wolf shoot, bang!\"  \"No, no; I vos dance so hard as I can!\" panted Hans, and renewed his exertions until Tom could keep in no longer, and set up such a laugh as had not been heard around the Hall for many a day.  It is needless to add that the other boys joined in, still, however, keeping out of sight.  \"You're a corker, Hans!\" cried Tom in his natural voice.  \"You ought to join the buck-and-wing dancers in a minstrel company.\"  \"Vot--vot--?\" began the German boy in bewilderment.  \"Ain't you no Indian?\"  \"To be sure I am; I'm Big Wolf, the Head Dancing Master of the Tuscaroras, Hans, dear boy.  Don't you think I'm a stunner.\"  \"You vos Tom Rofer, made up,\" growled Hans in sudden and deep disgust.  \"Vot for you vos blay me such a drick as dis, hey?\"  \"Just to wake you up, Hans.\"  \"I ton't vos been asleep, not me!\"  \"I mean to stir up your ideas--put something new into your head.\"  \"Mine head vos all right, Tom.\"  \"To be sure it is.\"  \"Den vot you say you vos put somedings new py him, hey?\"  \"I mean to make you sharper-put you on your mettle.\"  \"I ton't understand,\" stammered the German youth hopelessly.  \"That's so, and you won't in a thousand years, Hans.  But you are the right sort, any way.\"  \"I dink  I blay me Indian mineselluf some tay,\" mused Hans.  \"Dot vos lots of fun to make me tance, vosn't it?  Vere you got dot bistol?\"  \"Down in the barn.  Look out, or it may go off,\" added Tom, as he held out the weapons, thinking Hans would draw back in alarm.  Instead, however, the German boy took the pistol and of a sudden pointed it at Tom's head.  \"Now you tance!\" he cried abruptly.  \"Tance, or I vos shoot you full of holes!\"  \"Hi, Tom; he's got the best of you now!\" cried Frank from behind the bushes.  \"You can't make me dance, Hans,\" returned Tom.  \"That old rusty iron hasn't been loaded for years.\"   \"It ton't vos no goot?  No.  Maybe you vos only fool me.\"  \"Pull the trigger and see,\" answered Tom coolly.  He had scarcely spoken when Hans Mueller did as advised.  A tremendous report followed, and when the smoke cleared away the boys in the bushes were horrified to see that the rusty pistol had been shattered into a thousand pieces and that both Tom and Hans lay on their backs in the road, their faces covered with blood.     CHAPTER VI  THE STRANGE FIGURE IN THE HALLWAY   At the fearful outcome of the joke Tom had been perpetrating the boys concealed in the bushes were almost struck dumb, and for several seconds nobody could speak or move.  \"Oh, Heavens, Tom is killed!\" burst out Dick, who was the first to find his voice.  He ran forth as speedily as possible, and one after another the other cadets followed.  Tom lay as quiet as death, with his eyes closed and the blood trickling over his temple and left cheek.  Quickly Dick knelt by his side and felt of his heart.  \"Tom, Tom, speak to me!  Tell me you are not seriously hurt!\" he faltered.  But no answer came back, and Sam raced off to get some water, which he brought in a tin can he had discovered lying handy.  The water was dashed over Toni's face, and presently he gave a little gasp.  \"Oh my! what struck me?\" he murmured, and then tried to sit up, but for the minute the effort was a failure.  \"The pistol exploded,\" said Frank.  \"A piece must have hit you on the head,\" and he pointed at a nasty scalp wound from which the flow of blood emanated.  As well as it could be done, Frank and Dick bound up Tom's head with a handkerchief, and presently the fun-loving lad declared himself about as well as ever, \"Only a bit light-headed,\" as he added.  In the meantime the others had given their attention to Hans, who had been struck both in the scalp and in the shoulder.  It was a good quarter of an hour before the German youth came around, and then he felt so weak that the boys had to assist him back to the academy.  \"Honestly, I thought the pistol was empty,\" said Tom, on the return to the Hall.  \"Why, I think I've pulled that trigger a dozen times.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" said Frank with a shiver.  \"Why, only last week I pointed the thing at Peleg Snuggers and played at firing it.  Supposing it had gone off and killed somebody?\"  And he shivered again.  \"Dot vos almost as pad as von Indian's schalping,\" put in Hans faintly.  \"I dink, Tom, you vos play no more such dricks, hey?\"  \"No, I've had enough,\" replied Tom very soberly.  \"If you had been killed or seriously hurt I would never have forgiven myself.\"  And it may be added here that for some time after this event fun-making and Tom were strangers to each other.  At the proper time the feast which had been planned came off, and proved to be an event not readily forgotten.  It was no easy matter to obtain the good things required, and the boys ran the risk of being discovered by George Strong and punished; but by midnight everything was ready, and soon eating was \"in full blast,\" to use Sam's way of expressing it.  A few of the boys from the other dormitories had been invited, and the boys took turns in standing out in the hall on guard.  \"You see,\" explained Tom, \"Mr. Strong may come in, and I won't be able to play nightmare again, as I did last year.\"  \"Say, but that was a prime joke,\" laughed Frank.  \"And Mumps!\" cried Larry.  \"I'll never forget the orange flavored with kerosene,\" and a general laugh followed.  Somebody had spoken of inviting Jim Caven to"]]]
