To disturb the Emperor in his work as a general at such a time, with a matter which must agitate him so deeply, was hazardous, and few would have been bold enough to bring it before the overburdened monarch; but the leech's interest in Barbara was so warm and sincere that he allowed himself to be persuaded to act the mediator between her and the man who had interfered so deeply in the destiny of her life.  For the first time he saw her weep, and her winning manner seemed to him equally touching, whether she yielded to anxious distress of mind or to joyous hopes.  His intercession in her behalf would permit no delay, for the Emperor's departure to join the troops was close at hand.  Firmly resolved to plead the cause of the unfortunate girl, whose preservation, he might say, was his work, yet with slight hope of success, he crossed the threshold of the imperial apartments.  When the physician informed the sovereign that Barbara might be considered saved for the second time, the latter expressed his pleasure by a warm \"We are indebted to you for it again \"; but when Mathys asked if he did not intend to hasten Barbara's recovery by paying her a visit, though only for a few moments, the Emperor looked into the grave countenance of the physician, in whom he noticed an embarrassment usually foreign to him, and said firmly, \"Unfortunately, my dear Mathys, I must deny myself this pleasure.\"  The other bowed with a sorrowful face, for Barbara's dearest wish had been refused.  But the Emperor saw what was passing in the mind of the man whom he esteemed, and in a lighter tone added: \"So even your invulnerable dragon hide was not proof against the shafts--you know! If I see aright, something else lies near your heart.  My refusal--that is easily seen--annoys you; but, much as I value your good opinion, Mathys, it is firm.  The more difficult I found it to regain my peace of mind, the more foolish it would be to expose it to fresh peril.  Now, if ever, I must shun every source of agitation.  Think!  With the banning, the general's work begins.  How you look at me!  Well, yes!  You, too, know how easy it is for the man who has most to do to spare a leisure hour which the person without occupation does not find, and neither of us is accustomed to deceive the other.  Besides, it would be of little avail.  So, to cut the matter short, I am unwilling to see Barbara again and awaken false hopes in her mind!  But even these plain words do not seem to satisfy you.\"  \"By your Majesty's permission,\" replied the leech, \"deeply as I regret it for the invalid's sake, I believe, on the contrary, that you are choosing the right course.  But I have only discharged the first part of my patient's commission.  Though I have no pleasant tidings to take back to her, I am still permitted to tell her the truth.  But your Majesty, by avoiding an interview with the poor girl, will spare yourself a sad, nay, perhaps a painful hour.\"  \"Did the disease so cruelly mar this masterpiece of the Creator?\"  asked the Emperor.  \"With so violent a fever it was only too natural,\" replied the physician.  \"Time and what our feeble skill can do will improve her condition, I hope, but--and this causes the poor girl the keenest suffering--the unfortunate inflammation of the bronchial tubes most seriously injures the tone of her clear voice.\"  \"Ah!\" exclaimed the startled Emperor with sincere compassion. \"Do everything in your power, Mathys, to purify this troubled spring of melody.  I will repay you with my warmest gratitude, for, though the Romans said that Cupid conquered through the eyes, yet Barbara's singing exerted a far more powerful influence over my heart than even her wonderful golden hair.  Restore the melting tones of her voice and, though the bond of love which rendered this month of May so exquisitely beautiful to us must remain severed, I will not fail to remember it with all graciousness.\"  \"That, your Majesty, can scarcely be avoided,\" the physician here remarked with an embarrassment which was new in him to Charles, \"for the continuance of the memory of the spring days which your Majesty recalls with such vivid pleasure seems to be assured.  Yet, if it pleases Heaven, as I have learned to-day for the first time, to call a living being into existence for this purpose----\"  \"If I understand you correctly,\" cried the Emperor, starting up, \"I am to believe in hopes----\"  \"In hopes,\" interrupted the physician with complete firmness, \"which must not alarm your Majesty, but render you happy.  This new branch of the illustrious trunk of your royal race I, who am only 30 a plain man, hail with proud joy, and half the world, I know, will do so with me.\"  Charles, with brows contracted in a gloomy frown, gazed for a long time into vacancy.  The leech perceived how mighty a conflict between contradictory emotions would be waged in his breast, and silently gave him time to collect his thoughts.  At last, rising from his arm-chair, the Emperor struck the table with his open hand, and said: \"Whether the Lord our God awoke this new life for our punishment or our pleasure the future will teach.  What more must be done in this matter?  You know my custom in regard to such important affairs.  They are slept upon and maturely considered.  Only there is one point,\" and as he uttered the words his voice assumed an imperious tone, \"which is already irrevocably decided.  The world must not suspect what hope offers itself to me and another.  Tell her, Mathys, we wish her happiness; but if her maternal heart expects that I will do her child the honour of calling it mine, I must require her to keep silence, and intrust the newborn infant's destiny, from the first hour of its birth, to my charge.\"  Here he hesitated, and, after looking the physician in the face, went on: \"You again think that harsh, Mathys--I see it in your expression--but, as my friend, you yourself can scarcely desire the world to see the Emperor Charles performing the same task with a Barbara Blomberg.  She is free to choose.  Either I will rear the child, whether it is a boy or a girl, as my own, as I did my daughter, Duchess Margaret of Parma, or she will refuse to give me the child from its birth and I must deny it recognition.  I have already shared far too much with that tempting creature; I can not permit even this new dispensation to restore my severed relationship with the singer.  If Barbara's maternal love is unselfish, the choice can not be difficult for her.  That the charge of providing for this new life will fall upon me is a matter of course. Tell her this, Mathys, and if in future--But no.  We will confide this matter to Quijada.\"  As the door closed behind the physician, Charles stood motionless.  Deep earnestness furrowed his brow, but suddenly an expression of triumphant joy flashed over his face, and then yielded to a look of grateful satisfaction.  Soon, however, his lofty brow clouded again, and his lower lip protruded.  Some idea which excited his indignation must have entered his mind.  He had just been thinking with the warmest joy of the gift of Fate of which the physician had told him, but now the reasons which forbade his offering it a sincere welcome crowded upon the thinker.  If Heaven bestowed a son upon him, would not only the Church, but also the law, which he knew so well, refuse to recognise his rights?  A child whose mother had offended him, whose grandfather was a ridiculous, impoverished old soldier, whose cousins----  Yet for what did he possess the highest power on earth if he would not use it to place his own child, in spite of every obstacle, at the height of earthly grandeur?  What need he care for the opinion of the world?  And yet, yet----  Then there was a great bustle below.  The loud tramping of horses' hoofs was heard.  A troop of Lombardy cavalry in full armour appeared on the Haidplatz--fresh re-enforcements for the war just commencing.  The erect figure of the Duke of Alba, a man of middle height, followed by several colonels, trotted toward it.  The standard-bearer of the Lombards lowered the banner with the picture of the Madonna before the duke, and the Emperor involuntarily glanced back into the room at the lovely Madonna and Child by the master hand of Giovanni Bellini which his royal sister had hung above his writing table.  How grave and lovely, yet how full of majesty, the Christ-child looked, how touching a grace surrounded the band of angels playing on violins above the purest of mothers!  Then the necessity of appealing to her in prayer seized upon him, and with fervent warmth he besought her to surround with her gracious protection the young life which owed its existence to him.  He did not think of the child's mother.  Was he still angry with her?  Did she seem to him unworthy of being commended to the protection of the Queen of Heaven?  Barbara was now no more to him than a cracked bell, and the child which she expected to give him, no matter to what high' honours he raised it, would bear a stain that nothing could efface, and this stain would be called \"his mother.\"  No deviation from the resolve which he had expressed to the physician was possible.  The child could not be permitted to grow up amid Barbara's surroundings.  To prevent this she must submit to part from her son or her daughter, and to take the veil.  In the convent she could remember the happiness which had once raised her to its loftiest height.  She could and must atone for her sin and his by prayers and pious exercises. To return to the low estate whence he had raised her must appear disgraceful to herself.  How could one who had once dined at the table of the gods still relish the fare of mortals?  Even now it seemed inconceivable to him that she could oppose his will.  Yet if she did, he would withdraw his aid.  He no longer loved her.

CHAPTER V.  Everything in Barbara's residence had remained as it was when she arrived, only the second story, since the departure of the marquise, had stood empty.  Two horses had been left in the stable, the steward performed his duties as before, the cook presided in the kitchen, and Frau Lamperi attended to Barbara's rooms.  Nevertheless, at Wolf's first visit he was obliged to exert all his powers of persuasion to induce his miserable friend to give up her resolution of moving into her former home.  Besides, after the conversation with Charles's messenger, she had felt so ill that no visitor except himself had been received.  When, a few days later, she learned that the Emperor had set out for Landshut, she entreated Wolf to seek out Pyramus Kogel, for she had just learned that during her illness her father's travelling companion had asked to see her, but, like every one else, had been refused.  She grieved because they had forgotten to tell her this; but when she discovered that the same stately officer had called again soon after the relapse, she angrily upbraided, for the first time, Frau Lamperi, who was to blame for the neglect, and her grief increased when, on the same day, a messenger brought from the man who had twice been denied admittance a letter which inclosed one from her father, and briefly informed her that he should set out at once for Landshut.  As she would not receive him, he must send her the captain's messages in this way.  It appeared from the old man's letter that, while leaving the ship at Antwerp, he had met with an accident, and perhaps might long be prevented from undertaking the toilsome journey home.  But he was well cared for, and if she was still his clear daughter, she must treat Herr Pyramus Kogel kindly this time, for he had proved a faithful son and good Samaritan to him.  A stranger's hand had written this letter, which contained nothing more about the old soldier's health, but reminded her of a tin tankard which he had forgotten to deliver, and urged her to care for the ever-burning lamp in the chapel.  It closed with the request to offer his profound reverence at the feet of his Majesty, the most gracious, most glorious, and most powerful Emperor, and the remark that there was much to say about the country of Spain, but the best was certainly when one thought of it after turning the back upon it.  As a postscript, he had written with his own hand, as the crooked letters showed: \"Mind what I told you about Sir Pyramus, without whom you would now be a deserted orphan.  Can you believe that in all Spain there is no fresh butter to be had, either for bread or in the kitchen for roast meat, but instead rancid oil, which we should think just fit for burning?\"  With deep shame Barbara realized through this letter how rarely she remembered her father.  Only since she knew positively what joy and what anxiety awaited her had she again thought frequently of him, but always with great fear of the old man whose head had grown gray in an honourable life.  Now the hour was approaching when she would be obliged to confess to him what she still strove to deem a peerless favour of Fate, for which future generations would envy her.  Perhaps he who looked up to the Emperor Charles with such enthusiastic devotion would agree with her; perhaps what she must disclose to him would spoil the remainder of his life.  The image of the aged sufferer, lying in pain and sorrow far from her old his home, in a stranger's house, constantly forced itself upon her, and she often dwelt upon it, imagining it with ingenious self- torture.  Love for another had estranged her from him who possessed the first claim to every feeling of tenderness and gratitude in her heart.  The thought that she could do nothing for him and give him no token of her love pierced deep into her soul.  Every impulse of her being urged her to learn further details of him and his condition.  As Pyramus Kogel was staying in Landshut, she wrote a note entreating him, if possible, to come to Ratisbon to tell her about her father, or, if this could not be, to inform her by letter how he fared.  There was no lack of messengers going to Landshut, and the answer was not delayed.  During these war times, Pyramus answered, he was not his own master even for a moment; therefore he must deny himself a visit to her, and he also lacked time for a detailed account by letter.  If, however, she could resolve to do him the honour of a visit, he would promise her a more cordial reception than he had experienced on her side.  For the rest, her father was being carefully nursed, and his life was no longer in danger.  At first Barbara took this letter for an ungenerous attempt of the insulted man to repay the humiliation which he had received from her; but the news from the throngs of troops pouring into the city made the officer's request appear in a milder light, and the longing to ascertain her father's condition daily increased.  At the end of the first week in August her strength would have sufficed for the short drive to Landshut.  True, she was as hoarse as when she gave the physician a disinclination to return, but she had regained her physical vigour, and had taken walks, without special fatigue, sometimes with Wolf, sometimes with Gombert.  The latter, as well as Appenzelder, still frequently called upon her, and tried to diminish her grief over the injury to her voice by telling her of hundreds of similar cases which had resulted favourably.  The musicians were to return to Brussels the next day.  Appenzelder would not leave his boy choir, but Gombert had accepted an invitation from the Duke of Bavaria, at whose court in Munich the best music was eagerly fostered.  His road would lead him through Landshut, and how more than gladly Barbara would have accompanied him there!  She must now bid farewell to Appenzelder and Massi, and it was evident that the parting was hard for them also.  The eyes of the former even grew dim with tears as he pressed a farewell kiss upon Barbara's brow. The little Maltese, Hannibal Melas, would have preferred to stay with her--nay, he did not cease entreating her to keep him, though only as a page; but how could he have been useful to her?  Finally, she was obliged to bid Wolf, too, farewell, perhaps for many years.  During the last few days he had again proved his old friendship in the most loyal manner.  Through Quijada he had learned everything which concerned her and the Emperor Charles, and this had transformed his former love for Barbara, which was by no means dead, into tender compassion.  Not to serve the monarch or the husband of his new mistress in Villagarcia, but merely to lighten her own hard fate, he had not ceased to represent what consequences it might entail upon her if she should continue to defy the Emperor's command so obstinately.  He, too, saw in the convent the fitting place for her future life, now bereft of its best possessions; but although she succeeded in retaining her composure during his entreaties and warnings, she still most positively refused to obey the Emperor's order.  Her strong desire to visit Landshut was by no means solely from the necessity of hearing the particulars about her father, and the wish to see so brilliant an assemblage of troops from all countries, but especially the consuming longing to gaze once more into the face of the lover who was now making her so miserable, yet to whom she owed the greatest joy of her life.  And more!  She thought it would restore her peace of mind forever if she could succeed in speaking to him for even one brief moment and telling him what a transformation his guilt had wrought in her ardent love and her whole nature.  Wolf's representations and imploring entreaties remained as futile as those of Sister Hyacinthe and the abbesses of the Clare Sisters and the Convent of the Holy Cross, who had sought her by the confessor's wish. None of these pious women, except her nurse, knew the hope she cherished. They saw in her only the Emperor's discarded love; yet as such it seemed to them that Barbara was bidden to turn her back upon the world, which had nothing similar to offer her, in order, as the Saviour's bride, to seek a new and loftier happiness.  But Barbara's vivacious temperament shrank from their summons as from the tomb or the dungeon and, with all due reverence, she said so to the kindly nuns.  She desired no new happiness, nay, she could not imagine that she would ever again find joy in anything save the heavenly gift which she expected with increasing fear, and yet glad hope.  Yet they wished to deprive her of this exquisite treasure, this peerless comfort for the soul!  But she had learned how to defend herself, and they should never succeed in accomplishing this shameful purpose.  She would keep her child, though it increased the Emperor's resentment to the highest pitch, and deprived her of every expectation of his care.  Eagerly as Wolf praised Quijada's noble nature, she commanded him to assure the Castilian, whose messenger he honestly confessed himself to be, that she would die rather than yield to the Emperor's demands.  When the time at last came to part from Wolf also, and he pressed his lips to her hand, she felt that she could rely upon him, no matter how sad her future life might be.  He added many another kind and friendly word; then, in an outburst of painful emotion, cried: \"If only you had been contented with my faithful love, Wawerl, how very different, how much better everything would have been, how happy I might be!  and, if loyal love possesses the power of bestowing happiness, you, too----\"  Here Barbara pointed mournfully to her poor aching throat and, while he earnestly protested that, deeply as he lamented the injury to her voice, this cruel misfortune would by no means have lessened his love,"]]]
