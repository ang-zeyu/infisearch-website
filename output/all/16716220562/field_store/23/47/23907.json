If it comes to the scratch, you must take the command again, for Cutler won’t have art nor part in this game; and we may be reformed out afore we know where we are.”  “Well,” sais I, “there is no occasion, I guess; put us somewhere a little out of sight, and we won’t break the treaty no more. I reckon the ‘Spitfire,’ after all, would just as soon be in port as looking after us. It’s small potatoes for a man-of-war to be hunting poor game, like us little fore and afters.”  “As you like,” he said, “but we are prepared, you see, for the mate and men understand the whole thing. It ain’t the first time they have escaped by changing their sign-board.”  “Exactly,” said I, “a ship ain’t like a dog that can only answer to one name; and ‘Sary Ann’ is as good as the ‘Black Hawk,’ every mite and morsel. There is a good deal of fun in altering sign-boards. I recollect wunst, when I was a boy, there was a firm to Slickville who had this sign over their shop:  ‘Gallop and More, Taylors.’   “Well, one Saturday-night brother Josiah and I got a paintbrush, and altered it in this way:  ‘Gallop and 8 More Taylors Make a man.’   “Lord, what a commotion it made. Next day was Sunday; and as the folks were going to church, they stood and laughed and roared like anything. It made a terrible hulla-bulloo.  “‘Sam,’ said Minister to me, ‘what in natur is all that ondecent noise about so near the church-door.’  “I told him. It was most too much for him, but he bit in his breath, and tried to look grave; but I see a twinkle in his eye, and the corner of his mouth twitch, the way your eyelid does sometimes when a nerve gets a dancing involuntarily.  “‘A very foolish joke, Sam,’ he said; ‘it may get you into trouble.’  “‘Why, Minister,’ said I, ‘I hope you don’t think that—’  “‘No,’ said he, ‘I don’t think at all, I know it was you, for it’s just like you. But it’s a foolish joke, for, Sam:  “‘Honour and worth from no condition rise—’   “‘Exactly,’ sais I.  “‘Stitch well your part, there all the honour lies.’   “‘Sam, Sam,’ said he, ‘you are a bad boy,’ and he put on a serious face, and went in and got his gown ready for service.  “The ‘Sary Ann’ for the ‘Black Hawk,’” sais I to myself, “well that ain’t bad either; but there are more chests of tea and kegs of brandy, and such like, taken right by the custom-house door at Halifax in loads of hay and straw, than comes by water, just because it is the onlikeliest way in the world any man would do it. But it is only some of the Bay of Fundy boys that are up to that dodge. Smugglers in general haven’t the courage to do that. Dear me!” sais I to myself, “when was there ever a law that couldn’t be evaded; a tax that couldn’t be shuffled off like an old slipper; a prohibition that a smuggler couldn’t row right straight through, or a treaty that hadn’t more holes in it than a dozen supplemental ones could patch up? _It’s a high fence that can’t be scaled, and a strong one that can’t be broke down. When there are accomplices in the house, it is easier to get the door unlocked than to force it. Receivers make smugglers. Where there are not informers, penalties are dead letters._ The people here like to see us, for it is their interest, and we are safe as long as they are friendly. I don’t want to smuggle, for I scorn such a pettifogin’ business, as Josiah would call it; but I must and will see how the thing works, so as to report it to the President.”  “Well, Eldad,” sais I, “I leave all this to you. I want to avoid a scrape if I can, so put us in a place of safety, and be careful how you proceed.”  “I understand,” said he. “Now, Mr Slick, look yonder,” pointing towards the shore. “What is that?”  “A large ship under full sail,” said I, “but it is curious she has got the wind off shore, and just dead on end to us.”  “Are you sure,” said he, “it is a ship, for if we get foul of her, we shall be sunk in a moment, and every soul on board perish.”  “Is it a cruiser?” sais I; “because if it is, steer boldly for her, and I will go on board of her and show my commission as an officer of our everlastin’ nation. Captain,” said I, “what is that stranger?”  He paused for a moment, shaded his eyes with his hand, and examined her. “A large square-rigged vessel,” he said, “under a heavy press of canvas,” and resumed his walk on the deck.  After a while the pilot said: “Look again, Mr Slick, can you make her out now?”  “Why,” sais I, “she is only a brigantine; but ask the skipper.”  He took his glass and scrutinized her closely, and as he replaced it in the binnacle said: “We are going to have southerly weather I think; she loomed very large when I first saw her, and I took her for a ship; but now she seems to be an hermaphrodite. It’s of no consequence to us however what she is, and we shall soon near her.”  “Beyond that vessel,” said the pilot, “there is a splendid harbour, and as there has been a head wind for some time, I have no doubt there are many coasters in there, from the masters of whom you can obtain much useful information on the object of your visit, while we can drive a profitable trade among them and the folks ashore. How beautifully these harbours are situated,” he continued, “for carrying on the fisheries, and Nova Scotian though I be, I must say, I do think in any other part of the world there would be large towns here.”  “I think so too, Eldad,” sais I, “but British legislation is at the bottom of all your misfortunes, after all, and though you are as lazy as sloths, and as idle as that fellow old Blowhard saw, who lay down on the grass all day to watch the vessels passing, and observe the motion of the crows, the English, by breaking up your monopoly of inter-colonial and West India trade and throwing it open to us, not only without an equivalent, but in the face of our prohibitory duties, are the cause of all your poverty and stagnation. They are rich and able to act like fools if they like in their own affairs, but it was a cruel thing to sacrifice you, as they have done, and deprive you of the only natural carrying trade and markets you had. The more I think of it the less I blame you. It is a wicked mockery to lock men up, and then taunt them with want of enterprise, and tell them they are idle.”  “Look at that vessel again, Sir,” said Eldad; “she don’t make much headway, does she?”  “Well, I took the glass again and examined her minutely, and I never was so stumpt in my life.  “Pilot,” said I, “is that the same vessel?”  “The identical,” said he.  “I vow to man,” sais I, “as I am a livin’ sinner, that is neither a ship, nor a brigantine, nor a hermaphrodite, but a topsail schooner, that’s a fact. What in natur’ is the meanin’ of all this? Perhaps the captain knows,” so I called him again.  “Cutler, that vessel is transmografied again,” sais I; “look at her.”  “Pooh,” said he, “that’s not the same vessel at all. The two first we saw are behind that island. That one is nothing but a coaster. You can’t take me in, Slick. You are always full of your fun, and taking a rise out of some one or another, and I shall be glad when we land, you will then have some one else to practise on.”  In a short time the schooner vanished, and its place was supplied by a remarkable white cliff, which from the extraordinary optical delusion it occasions gives its name to the noble port which is now called Ship Harbour. I have since mentioned this subject to a number of mariners, and have never yet heard of a person who was not deceived in a similar manner. As we passed through the narrows, we entered a spacious and magnificent basin, so completely land-locked that a fleet of vessels of the largest size may lay there unmoved by any wind. There is no haven in America to be compared with it.  “You are now safe,” said the pilot; “it is only twelve leagues from Halifax, and nobody would think of looking for you here. The fact is, _the nearer you hide the safer you be._”  “Exactly,” sais I; “what you seek you can’t find, but when you ain’t looking for a thing, you are sure to stumble on it.”  “If you ever want to run goods, Sir,” said he, “the closer you go to the port the better. Smugglers ain’t all up to this, so they seldom approach the lion’s den, but go farther and fare worse. Now we may learn lessons from dumb animals. They know we reason on probabilities, and therefore always do what is improbable. “We _think_ them to be fools, but they _know_ that we are. The fox sees we always look for him about his hole, and therefore he carries on his trade as far from it, and as near the poultry yard, as possible. If a dog kills sheep, and them Newfoundlanders are most uncommon fond of mutton, I must say, he never attacks his neighbour’s flock, for he knows he would be suspected and had up for it, but sets off at night, and makes a foray like the old Scotch on the distant borders.  “He washes himself, for marks of blood is a bad sign, and returns afore day, and wags his tail, and runs round his master, and looks up into his face as innocent as you please, as much as to say, ‘Squire, here I have been watchin’ of your property all this live-long night, it’s dreadful lonely work, I do assure you, and oh, how glad I am to see the shine of your face this morning.’  “And the old boss pats his head, fairly took in, and says, ‘That’s a good dog, what a faithful honest fellow you be, you are worth your weight in gold.’  “Well, the next time he goes off on a spree in the same quarter, what does he see but a border dog strung up by the neck, who has been seized and condemned as many an innocent fellow has been before him on circumstantial evidence, and he laughs and says to himself, ‘What fools humans be, they don’t know half as much as we dogs do.’"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6112"],["title","Nature and Human Nature (#8)"],["body"," So he thinks it would be as well to shift his ground, where folks ain’t on the watch for sheep-stealers, and he makes a dash into a flock still farther off.  “Them Newfoundlanders would puzzle the London detective police, I believe they are the most knowin’ coons in all creation, don’t you?”  “Well, they are,” sais I, “that’s a fact, and they have all the same passions and feelings we have, only they are more grateful than man is, and you can by kindness lay one of them under an obligation he will never forget as long as he lives, whereas an obligation scares a man, for he snorts and stares at you like a horse at an engine, and is e’en most sure to up heels and let you have it, like mad. The only thing about dogs is, they can’t bear rivals, they like to have all attention paid to themselves exclusively. I will tell you a story I had from a British colonel.  “He was stationed in Nova Scotia, with his regiment, when I was a venden of clocks there. I met him to Windsor, at the Wilcox Inn. He was mightily taken with my old horse Clay, and offered me a most an everlastin’ long price for him; he said if I would sell him, he wouldn’t stand for money, for he never see such an animal in all his born days, and so on. But old Clay was above all price, his ditto was never made yet, and I don’t think ever will be. I had no notion to sell him, and I told him so, but seein’ he was dreadful disappointed, for a rich Englishman actually thinks money will do anything and get anything, I told him if ever I parted with him he should have him on condition he would keep him as long as he lived, and so on.  “Well, it pacified him a bit, and to turn the conversation, sais I, ‘Colonel,’ sais I, ‘what a most an almighty everlastin’ super superior Newfoundler that is,’ a pointin’ to his dog; ‘creation,’ sais I, ‘if I had a regiment of such fellows, I believe I wouldn’t be afraid of the devil. My,’ sais I, ‘what a dog! would you part with him? I’de give anything for him.’  “I said that a purpose to show him I had as good a right to keep my horse as he had his long-haired gentleman.  “‘No,’ sais he, with a sort of half smile at my ignorance in pokin’ such a question at him (for a Britisher abroad thinks he has privileges no one else has), ‘no, I don’t want to part with him. I want to take him to England with me. See, he has all the marks of the true breed: look at his beautiful broad forehead, what an intellectual one it is, ain’t it? then see his delicate mouse-like ears, just large enough to cover the orifice, and that’s all.’  “‘Orifice,’ said I, for I hate fine words for common use, they are like go-to-meeting’ clothes on week days, onconvenient, and look too all fired jam up. Sais I, ‘what’s that when it’s fried. I don’t know that word?’  “‘Why, ear-hole,’ said he.  “‘Oh,’ sais I, simple like, ‘I take now.’  “He smiled and went on. ‘Look at the black roof of his mouth,’ said he, ‘and do you see the dew claw, that is a great mark? Then feel that tail, that is his rudder to steer by when swimming. It’s different from the tail of other dogs, the strength of that joint is surprising. But his chest, Sir, his chest, see how that is formed on purpose for diving. It is shaped internally like a seal’s. And then, observe the spread of that webbed foot, and the power of them paddles. There are two kinds of them, the short and the long haired, but I think those shaggy ones are the handsomest. They are very difficult to be got now of the pure breed. I sent to the Bay of Bulls for this one. To have them in health you must make them stay out of doors in all weather, and keep them cool, and above all not feed them too high. Salt fish seems the best food for them, they are so fond of it. Singular that, ain’t it? but a dog is natural, Sir, and a man ain’t.  “‘Now, you never saw a codfish at the table of a Newfoundland merchant in your life. He thinks it smells too much of the shop. In fact, in my opinion the dog is the only gentleman there. The only one, now that the Indian is extinct, who has breeding and blood in that land of oil, blubber, and icebergs.’  “Lord, I wish one of them had been there to have heard him, wouldn’t he a harpooned him? that’s all. He made a considerable of a long yarn of it, and as it was a text he had often enlarged on, I thought he never would have ended, but like other preachers, when he got heated, spit on the slate, rub it all out, and cypher it over again. Thinks I to myself, I’ll play you a bit, my boy.  “‘Exactly,’ sais I, ‘there is the same difference in dogs and horses as there is in men. Some are noble by nature, and some vulgar; each is known by his breed.’  “‘True,’ said he, ‘very true,’ and he stood up a little straighter as if it did him good to hear a republican say that, for his father was an Earl. ‘A very just remark,’ said he, and he eyed me all over, as if he was rather surprised at my penetration.  “‘But the worst of it,’ sais I, ‘is that a high bred dog or horse and a high bred man are only good for one thing. A pointer will point—a blood horse run—a setter will set—a bull dog fight—and a Newfoundlander will swim; but what else are they good for? Now a duke is a duke, and the devil a thing else. All you expect of him is to act and look like one (and I could point out some that don’t even do that). If he writes a book, and I believe a Scotch one, by the help of his tutor, did once, or makes a speech, you say, Come now, that is very well for a duke, and so on. Well, a marquis ain’t quite so high bred, and he is a little better, and so on, downwards; when you get to an earl, why, he may be good for more things than one. I ain’t quite sure a cross ain’t desirable, and in that way that you couldn’t improve the intelligence of both horses, noblemen, and dogs—don’t you think so, Sir?’ sais I.  “‘It is natural for you,’ said he, not liking the smack of democracy that I threw in for fun, and looking uneasy. ‘So,’ sais he (by way of turning the conversation), ‘the sagacity of dogs is very wonderful. I will tell you an anecdote of this one that has surprised everybody to whom I have related it.  “‘Last summer my duties led me to George’s Island. I take it for granted you know it. It is a small island situated in the centre of the harbour of Halifax, has a powerful battery on it, and barracks for the accommodation of troops. There was a company of my regiment stationed there at the time. I took this dog and a small terrier, called Tilt, in the boat with me. The latter was a very active little fellow that the General had given me a few weeks before. He was such an amusing creature, that he soon became a universal favourite, and was suffered to come into the house (a privilege which was never granted to this gentleman, who paid no regard to the appearance of his coat, which was often wet and dirty), and who was therefore excluded.  “‘The consequence was, Thunder was jealous, and would not associate with him, and if ever he took any liberty, he turned on him and punished him severely. This however he never presumed to do in my presence, as he knew I would not suffer it, and therefore, when they both accompanied me in my walks, the big dog contented himself with treating the other with perfect indifference and contempt. Upon this occasion, Thunder lay down in the boat and composed himself to sleep, while the little fellow, who was full of life and animation, and appeared as if he did not know what it was to close his eyes, sat up, looked over the gunwale, and seemed to enjoy the thing uncommonly. He watched the motions of the men, as if he understood what was required of them, and was anxious they should acquit themselves properly.’  “‘He knew,’ said I, ‘it was what sailors call the _dog watch.’_  “‘Very _good,’_ said he, but looking all the time as if he thought the interruption very _bad._  “‘After having made my inspection, I returned to the boat, for the purpose of recrossing to the town, when I missed the terrier. Thunder was close at my heels, and when I whistled for the other, wagged his tail and looked up in my face, as if he would say, Never mind that foolish dog, I am here, and that is enough, or is there anything you want me to do?  “‘After calling in vain, I went back to the barracks, and inquired of the men for Tilt, but no one appeared to have seen him or noticed his motions.  “‘After perambulating the little island in vain, I happened to ask the sentry if he knew where he was.  “‘Yes, Sir,’ said he, ‘he is buried in the beach.’  “‘Buried in the beach,’ said I, with great anger, ‘who dared to kill him? Tell me, Sir, immediately.’  “‘That large dog did it, Sir. He enticed him down to the shore by playing with him, pretending to crouch and then run after him; and then retreating and coaxing him to chase him; and when he got him near the beach, he throttled him in an instant, and then scratched a hole in the shingle and buried him, covering him up with the gravel. After that he went into the water, and with his paws washed his head and face, shook himself, and went up to the barracks. You will find the terrier, just down there, Sir.’  “‘And sure enough there was the poor little fellow, quite dead, and yet warm.  “‘In the mean time Thunder, who had watched our proceedings from a distance, as soon as he saw the body exhumed, felt as if there was a court-martial holding over himself, plunged into the harbour and swam across to the town, and hid himself for several days, until he thought the affair had blown over; and then approached me anxiously and cautiously, lest he should be apprehended and condemned. As I was unwilling to lose both my dogs, I was obliged to overlook it, and take him back to my confidence. A strange story, ain’t it, Mr Slick.’  “‘Well, it is,’ sais I, ‘but dogs do certainly beat all natur, that’s a fact.’  “But to get back to the ‘Black Hawk:’ as soon as we anchored, I proposed to Cutler that we should go ashore and visit the ‘natives.’ While he was engaged giving his orders to the mate, I "]]]
