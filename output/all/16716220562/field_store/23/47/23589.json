In every direction natives are walking at a brisk pace, their naked feet making no sound on the springy turf of the streets, carrying on their heads huge burdens which are usually crowned by the hat of the bearer, a large limpet-shaped affair made of palm leaves.  While some carry these enormous bundles, others bear logs or planks of wood, blocks of building stone, vessels containing palm-oil, baskets of vegetables, or tin tea-trays on which are folded shawls.  As the great majority of the native inhabitants of Sierra Leone pay no attention whatever to where they are going, either in this world or the next, the confusion and noise are out of all proportion to the size of the town; and when, as frequently happens, a section of actively perambulating burden-bearers charge recklessly into a sedentary section, the members of which have dismounted their loads and squatted themselves down beside them, right in the middle of the fair way, to have a friendly yell with some acquaintances, the row becomes terrific.  In among these crowds of country people walk stately Mohammedans, Mandingoes, Akers, and Fulahs of the Arabised tribes of the Western Soudan.  These are lithe, well-made men, and walk with a peculiarly fine, elastic carriage.  Their graceful garb consists of a long white loose-sleeved shirt, over which they wear either a long black mohair or silk gown, or a deep bright blue affair, not altogether unlike a University gown, only with more stuff in it and more folds. They are undoubtedly the gentlemen of the Sierra Leone native population, and they are becoming an increasing faction in the town, by no means to the pleasure of the Christians.  But to the casual visitor at Sierra Leone the Mohammedan is a mere passing sensation.  You neither feel a burning desire to laugh with, or at him, as in the case of the country folks, nor do you wish to punch his head, and split his coat up his back--things you yearn to do to that perfect flower of Sierra Leone culture, who yells your bald name across the street at you, condescendingly informs you that you can go and get letters that are waiting for you, while he smokes his cigar and lolls in the shade, or in some similar way displays his second-hand rubbishy white culture--a culture far lower and less dignified than that of either the stately Mandingo or the bush chief.  I do not think that the Sierra Leone dandy really means half as much insolence as he shows; but the truth is he feels too insecure of his own real position, in spite of all the \"side\" he puts on, and so he dare not be courteous like the Mandingo or the bush Fan.  It is the costume of the people in Free Town and its harbour that will first attract the attention of the newcomer, notwithstanding the fact that the noise, the smell, and the heat are simultaneously making desperate bids for that favour.  The ordinary man in the street wears anything he may have been able to acquire, anyhow, and he does not fasten it on securely.  I fancy it must be capillary attraction, or some other partially-understood force, that takes part in the matter.  It is certainly neither braces nor buttons. There are, of course, some articles which from their very structure are fairly secure, such as an umbrella with the stick and ribs removed, or a shirt.  This last-mentioned treasure, which usually becomes the property of the ordinary man from a female relative or admirer taking in white men's washing, is always worn flowing free, and has such a charm in itself that the happy possessor cares little what he continues his costume with--trousers, loin cloth, red flannel petticoat, or rice-bag drawers, being, as he would put it, \"all same for one\" to him.  The ladies are divided into three classes; the young girl you address as \"tee-tee\"; the young person as \"seester\"; the more mature charmer as \"mammy\"; but I do not advise you to employ these terms when you are on your first visit, because you might get misunderstood.  For, you see, by addressing a mammy as seester, she might think either that you were unconscious of her dignity as a married lady--a matter she would soon put you right on--or that you were flirting, which of course was totally foreign to your intention, and would make you uncomfortable.  My advice is that you rigidly stick to missus or mammy.  I have seen this done most successfully.  The ladies are almost as varied in their costume as the gentlemen, but always neater and cleaner; and mighty picturesque they are too, and occasionally very pretty.  A market-woman with her jolly brown face and laughing brown eyes--eyes all the softer for a touch of antimony--her ample form clothed in a lively print overall, made with a yoke at the shoulders, and a full long flounce which is gathered on to the yoke under the arms and falls fully to the feet; with her head done up in a yellow or red handkerchief, and her snowy white teeth gleaming through her vast smiles, is a mighty pleasant thing to see, and to talk to.  But, Allah! the circumference of them!  The stone-built, white-washed market buildings of Free Town have a creditably clean and tidy appearance considering the climate, and the quantity and variety of things exposed for sale--things one wants the pen of a Rabelais to catalogue.  Here are all manner of fruits, some which are familiar to you in England; others that soon become so to you in Africa.  You take them as a matter of course if you are outward bound, but on your call homeward (if you make it) you will look on them as a blessing and a curiosity.  For lower down, particularly in \"the Rivers,\" these things are rarely to be had, and never in such perfection as here; and to see again lettuces, yellow oranges, and tomatoes bigger than marbles is a sensation and a joy.  One of the chief features of Free Town are the jack crows.  Some writers say they are peculiar to Sierra Leone, others that they are not, but both unite in calling them Picathartes gymnocephalus.  To the white people who live in daily contact with them they are turkey buzzards; to the natives, Yubu.  Anyhow they are evil-looking fowl, and no ornament to the roof-ridges they choose to sit on.  The native Christians ought to put a row of spikes along the top of their cathedral to keep them off; the beauty of that edifice is very far from great, and it cannot carry off the effect produced by the row of these noisome birds as they sit along its summit, with their wings arranged at all manner of different angles in an \"all gone\" way.  One bird perhaps will have one straight out in front, and the other casually disposed at right-angles, another both straight out in front, and others again with both hanging hopelessly down, but none with them neatly and tidily folded up, as decent birds' wings should be.  They all give the impression of having been extremely drunk the previous evening, and of having subsequently fallen into some sticky abomination--into blood for choice.  Being the scavengers of Free Town, however, they are respected by the local authorities and preserved; and the natives tell me you never see either a young or a dead one.  The latter is a thing you would not expect, for half of them look as if they could not live through the afternoon.  They also told me that when you got close to them, they had a \"'trong, 'trong 'niff; 'niff too much.\"  I did not try, but I am quite willing to believe this statement.  The other animals most in evidence in the streets are, first and foremost, goats and sheep.  I have to lump them together, for it is exceedingly difficult to tell one from the other.  All along the Coast the empirical rule is that sheep carry their tails down, and goats carry their tails up; fortunately you need not worry much anyway, for they both \"taste rather like the nothing that the world was made of,\" as Frau Buchholtz says, and own in addition a fibrous texture, and a certain twang.  Small cinnamon-coloured cattle are to be got here, but horses there are practically none.  Now and again some one who does not see why a horse should not live here as well as at Accra or Lagos imports one, but it always shortly dies.  Some say it is because the natives who get their living by hammock- carrying poison them, others say the tsetse fly finishes them off; and others, and these I believe are right, say that entozoa are the cause.  Small, lean, lank yellow dogs with very erect ears lead an awful existence, afflicted by many things, but beyond all others by the goats, who, rearing their families in the grassy streets, choose to think the dogs intend attacking them.  Last, but not least, there is the pig--a rich source of practice to the local lawyer.  Cape Coast Castle and then Accra were the next places of general interest at which we stopped.  The former looks well from the roadstead, and as if it had very recently been white-washed.  It is surrounded by low, heavily-forested hills, which rise almost from the seashore, and the fine mass of its old castle does not display its dilapidation at a distance.  Moreover, the three stone forts of Victoria, William, and Macarthy, situated on separate hills commanding the town, add to the general appearance of permanent substantialness so different from the usual ramshackledom of West Coast settlements.  Even when you go ashore and have had time to recover your senses, scattered by the surf experience, you find this substantialness a true one, not a mere visual delusion produced by painted wood as the seeming substantialness of Sierra Leone turns out to be when you get to close quarters with it.  It causes one some mental effort to grasp the fact that Cape Coast has been in European hands for centuries, but it requires a most unmodern"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891"],["title","Travels in West Africa: Congo Fran√ßais, Corisco and Cameroons (#5)"],["body","of credence to realise this of any other settlement on the whole western seaboard until you have the pleasure of seeing the beautiful city of San Paul de Loanda, far away down south, past the Congo.  My experience of Cape Coast on this occasion was one of the hottest, but one of the pleasantest I have ever been through on the Gold Coast.  The former attribute was due to the climate, the latter to my kind friends, Mr. Batty, and Mr. and Mrs. Dennis Kemp.  I was taken round the grand stone-built houses with their high stone- walled yards and sculpture-decorated gateways, built by the merchants of the last century and of the century before, and through the great rambling stone castle with its water-tanks cut in the solid rock beneath it, and its commodious accommodation for slaves awaiting shipment, now almost as obsolete as the guns it mounts, but not quite so, for these cool and roomy chambers serve to house the native constabulary and their extensive families.  This being done, I was taken up an unmitigated hill, on whose summit stands Fort William, a pepper-pot-like structure now used as a lighthouse.  The view from the top was exceedingly lovely and extensive.  Beneath, and between us and the sea, lay the town in the blazing sun.  In among its solid stone buildings patches of native mud-built huts huddled together as though they had been shaken down out of a sack into the town to serve as dunnage.  Then came the snow-white surf wall, and across it the blue sea with our steamer rolling to and fro on the long, regular swell, impatiently waiting until Sunday should be over and she could work cargo.  Round us on all the other sides were wooded hills and valleys, and away in the distance to the west showed the white town and castle of Elmina and the nine-mile road thither, skirting the surf-bound seashore, only broken on its level way by the mouth of the Sweet River.  Over all was the brooding silence of the noonday heat, broken only by the dulled thunder of the surf.  After seeing these things we started down stairs, and on reaching ground descended yet lower into a sort of stone-walled dry moat, out of which opened clean, cool, cellar-like chambers tunnelled into the earth.  These, I was informed, had also been constructed to keep slaves in when they were the staple export of the Gold Coast.  They were so refreshingly cool that I lingered looking at them and their massive doors, ere being marched up to ground level again, and down the hill through some singularly awful stenches, mostly arising from rubber, into the big Wesleyan church in the middle of the town.  It is a building in the terrible Africo-Gothic style, but it compares most favourably with the cathedral at Sierra Leone, particularly internally, wherein, indeed, it far surpasses that structure.  And then we returned to the Mission House and spent a very pleasant evening, save for the knowledge (which amounted in me to remorse) that, had it not been for my edification, not one of my friends would have spent the day toiling about the town they know only too well.  The Wesleyan Mission on the Gold Coast, of which Mr. Dennis Kemp was at that time chairman, is the largest and most influential Protestant mission on the West Coast of Africa, and it is now, I am glad to say, adding a technical department to its scholastic and religious one.  The Basel Mission has done a great deal of good work in giving technical instruction to the natives, and practically started this most important branch of their education.  There is still an almost infinite amount of this work to be done, the African being so strangely deficient in mechanical culture; infinitely more so, indeed, in this than in any other particular.  After leaving Cape Coast our next port was Accra which is one of the five West Coast towns that look well from the sea.  The others don't look well from anywhere.  First in order of beauty comes San Paul de Loanda; then Cape Coast with its satellite Elmina, then Gaboon, then Accra with its satellite Christiansborg, and lastly, Sierra Leone.  What there is of beauty in Accra is oriental in type.  Seen from the sea, Fort St. James on the left and Christiansborg Castle on the right, both almost on shore level, give, with an outcrop of sandy dwarf cliffs, a certain air of balance and strength to the town, though but for these and the two old castles, Accra would be but a poor place and a flimsy, for the rest of it is a mass of rubbishy mud and palm-leaf huts, and corrugated iron dwellings for the Europeans.  Corrugated iron is my abomination.  I quite understand it has points, and I do not attack from an aesthetic standpoint.  It really looks well enough when it is painted white.  There is, close to Christiansborg Castle, a patch of bungalows and offices for officialdom and wife that from a distance in the hard bright sunshine looks like an encampment of snow-white tents among the coco palms, and pretty enough withal.  I am also aware that the corrugated-iron roof is an advantage in enabling you to collect and store rain-water, which is the safest kind of water you can get on the Coast, always supposing you have not painted the aforesaid roof with red oxide an hour or two before so collecting, as a friend of mine did once.  But the heat inside those iron houses is far greater than inside mud-walled, brick, or wooden ones, and the alternations of temperature more sudden:  mornings and evenings they are cold and clammy; draughty they are always, thereby giving you chill which means fever, and fever in West Africa means more than it does in most places.  Going on shore at Accra with Lady MacDonald gave me opportunities and advantages I should not otherwise have enjoyed, such as the hospitality of the Governor, luxurious transport from the landing place to Christiansborg Castle, a thorough inspection of the cathedral in course of erection, and the strange and highly interesting function of going to a tea-party at a police station to meet a king,--a real reigning king,--who kindly attended with his suite and displayed an intelligent interest in photographs.  Tackie (that is His Majesty's name) is an old, spare man, with a subdued manner.  His sovereign rights are acknowledged by the Government so far as to hold him more or less responsible for any iniquity committed by his people; and as the Government do not allow him to execute or flagellate the said people, earthly pomp is rather a hollow thing to Tackie.  On landing I was taken in charge by an Assistant Inspector of Police, and after a scrimmage for my chief's baggage and my own, which reminded me of a long ago landing on the distant island of Guernsey, the inspector and I got into a 'rickshaw, locally called a go-cart.  It was pulled in front by two government negroes and pushed behind by another pair, all neatly attired in white jackets and knee breeches, and crimson cummerbunds yards long, bound round their middles.  Now it is an ingrained characteristic of the uneducated negro, that he cannot keep on a neat and complete garment of any kind.  It does not matter what that garment may be; so long as it is whole, off it comes.  But as soon as that garment becomes a series of holes, held together by filaments of rag, he keeps it upon him in a manner that is marvellous, and you need have no further anxiety on its behalf.  Therefore it was but natural that the governmental cummerbunds, being new, should come off their wearers several times in the course of our two mile trip, and as they wound riskily round the legs of their running wearers, we had to make halts while one end of the cummerbund was affixed to a tree-trunk and the other end to the man, who rapidly wound himself up in it again with a skill that spoke of constant practice.  The road to Christiansborg from Accra, which runs parallel to the sea and is broad and well-kept, is in places pleasantly shaded with pepper trees, eucalyptus, and palms.  The first part of it, which forms the main street of Accra, is remarkable.  The untidy, poverty- stricken native houses or huts are no credit to their owners, and a constant source of anxiety to a conscientious sanitary inspector. Almost every one of them is a shop, but this does not give rise to the animated commercial life one might imagine, owing, I presume, to the fact that every native inhabitant of Accra who has any money to get rid of is able recklessly to spend it in his own emporium.  For these shops are of the store nature, each after his kind, and seem homogeneously stocked with tin pans, loud-patterned basins, iron pots, a few rolls of cloth and bottles of American rum.  After passing these there are the Haussa lines, a few European houses, and the cathedral; and when nearly into Christiansborg, a cemetery on either side of the road.  That to the right is the old cemetery, now closed, and when I was there, in a disgracefully neglected state:  a mere jungle of grass infested with snakes.  Opposite to it is the cemetery now in use, and I remember well my first visit to it under the guidance of a gloomy Government official, who said he always walked there every afternoon, \"so as to get used to the place before staying permanently in it,\"--a rank waste of time and energy, by the way, as subsequent events proved, for he is now safe off the Gold Coast for good and all.  He took me across the well-kept grass to two newly dug graves, each covered with wooden hoods in a most business-like way.  Evidently those hoods were regular parts of the cemetery's outfit.  He said nothing, but waved his hand with a \"take-your-choice,-they-are-both- quite-ready\" style.  \"Why?\" I queried laconically.  \"Oh! we always keep two graves ready dug for Europeans.  We have to bury very quickly here, you know,\" he answered.  I turned at bay.  I had had already a very heavy dose of details of this sort that afternoon and was disinclined to believe another thing.  So I said, \"It's exceedingly wrong to do a thing like that, you only "]]]
