It don't pay to get a poor one.\"  \"I'm a poor man, squire. I must take what I can get.\"  \"I ain't sure but I've got a cow that will suit you, a red with white spots. She's a fust-rate milker.\"  \"How old is she?\"  \"She's turned of five.\"  \"How much do you ask for her?\"  \"Are you going to pay cash down?\" asked the squire, half shutting his eyes, and looking into the face of his visitor.  \"I can't do that. I'm very short of money.\"  \"So am I,\" chimed in the squire. He had two hundred dollars in his desk at that moment waiting for profitable investment; but then he didn't call it exactly a lie to misrepresent for a purpose. \"So am I. Money's tight, neighbor.\"  \"Money's always tight with me, squire,\" returned Hiram Walton, with a sigh.  \"Was you a-meanin' to pay anything down?\" inquired the squire.  \"I don't see how I can.\"  \"That alters the case, you know. I might as well keep the cow, as to sell her without the money down.\"  \"I am willing to pay interest on the money.\"  \"Of course that's fair. Wall, neighbor, what do you say to goin' out to see the cow?\"  \"Is she in the barn?\"  \"No, she's in the pastur'. 'Tain't fur.\"  \"I'll go along with you.\"  They made their way by a short cut across a cornfield to the pasture--a large ten-acre lot, covered with a scanty vegetation. The squire's cows could not be said to live in clover.  \"That's the critter,\" he said, pointing out one of the cows which was grazing near by. \"Ain't she a beauty?\"  \"She looks pretty well,\" said Mr. Walton, dubiously, by no means sure that she would equal his lost cow.  \"She's one of the best I've got. I wouldn't sell ef it wasn't to oblige. I ain't at all partic'lar, but I suppose you've got to hev a cow.\"  \"What do you ask for her, squire?\"  \"She's wuth all of forty dollars,\" answered the squire, who knew perfectly well that a fair price would be about thirty. But then his neighbor must have a cow, and had no money to pay, and so was at his mercy.  \"That seems high,\" said Hiram.  \"She's wuth every cent of it; but I ain't nowise partic'lar about sellin' her.\"  \"Couldn't you say thirty-seven?\"  \"I couldn't take a dollar less. I'd rather keep her. Maybe I'd take thirty-eight, cash down.\"  Hiram Walton shook his head.  \"I have no cash,\" he said. \"I must buy on credit.\"  \"Wall, then, there's a bargain for you. I'll let you have her for forty dollars, giving you six months to pay it, at reg'lar interest, six per cent. Of course I expect a little bonus for the accommodation.\"  \"I hope you'll be easy with me--I'm a poor man, squire.\"  \"Of course, neighbor; I'm always easy.\"  \"That isn't your reputation,\" thought Hiram; but he knew that this was a thought to which he must not give expression.  \"All I want is a fair price for my time and trouble. We'll say three dollars extra for the accommodation--three dollars down.\"  Hiram Walton felt that it was a hard bargain the squire was driving with him, but there seemed no help for it.  He must submit to the imposition, or do without a cow. There was no one else to whom he could look for help on any terms. As to the three dollars, his whole available cash amounted to but four dollars, and it was for three quarters of this sum that the squire called. But the sacrifice must be made.  \"Well, Squire Green, if that is your lowest price, I suppose I must come to it,\" he answered, at last.  \"You can't do no better,\" said the squire, with alacrity.  \"If so be as you've made up your mind, we'll make out the papers.\"  \"Very well.\"  \"Come back to the house. When do you want to take the cow?\"  \"I'll drive her along now, if you are willing.\"  \"Why, you see,\" said the squire, hesitating, while a mean thought entered his, mind, \"she's been feedin' in my pastur' all the mornin', and I calc'late I'm entitled to the next milkin', you'd better come 'round to-night, just after milkin', and then you can take her.\"  \"I didn't think he was quite so mean,\" passed through Hiram Walton's mind, and his lip curved slightly in scorn, but he knew that this feeling must be concealed.  \"Just as you say,\" he answered. \"I'll come round tonight, or send Harry.\"  \"How old is Harry now?\"  \"About fourteen.\"  \"He's got to be quite a sizable lad--ought to earn concid'able. Is he industrious?\"  \"Yes, Harry is a good worker--always ready to lend a hand.\"  \"That's good. Does he go to school?\"  \"Yes, he's been going to school all the term.\"  \"Seems to me he's old enough to give up larnin' altogether. Don't he know how to read and write and cipher?\"  \"Yes, he's about the best scholar in school.\"  \"Then, neighbor Walton, take my advice and don't send him any more. You need him at home, and he knows enough to get along in the world.\"  \"I want him to learn as much as he can. I'd like to send him to school till he is sixteen.\"  \"He's had as much schoolin' now as ever I had,\" said the squire, \"and I've got along pooty well. I've been seleckman, and school committy, and filled about every town office, and I never wanted no more schoolin'. My father took me away from school when I was thirteen.\"  \"It wouldn't hurt you if you knew a little more,\" thought Hiram, who remembered very well the squire's deficiencies when serving on the town school committee.  \"I believe in learning,\" he said. \"My father used to say, 'Live and learn.' That's a good motto, to my thinking.\"  \"It may be carried too far. When a boy's got to be of the age of your boy, he'd ought to be thinking of workin.' His time is too valuable to spend in the schoolroom.\"  \"I can't agree with you, squire. I think no time is better spent than the time that's spent in learning. I wish I could afford to send my boy to college.\"  \"It would cost a mint of money; and wouldn't pay. Better put him to some good business.\"  That was the way he treated his own son, and for this and other reasons, as soon as he arrived at man's estate, he left home, which had never had any pleasant associations with him. His father wanted to convert him into a money-making machine--a mere drudge, working him hard, and denying him, as long as he could, even the common recreations of boyhood--for the squire had an idea that the time devoted in play was foolishly spent, inasmuch as it brought him in no pecuniary return. He was willfully blind to the faults and defects of his system, and their utter failure in the case of his own son, and would, if could, have all the boys in town brought up after severely practical method. But, fortunately for Harry, Mr. Walton had very different notions. He was compelled to keep his son home the greater part of the summer, but it was against his desire.  \"No wonder he's a poor man,\" thought the squire, after his visitor returned home. \"He ain't got no practical idees. Live and learn! that's all nonsense. His boy looks strong and able to work, and it's foolish sendin' him school any longer. That wa'n't my way, and see where I am,\" he concluded, with complacent remembrance of bonds and mortgages and money out at interest. \"That was a pooty good cow trade,\" he concluded. \"I didn't calc' late for to get more'n thirty-five dollars for the critter; but then neighbor Walton had to have a cow, and had to pay my price.\"  Now for Hiram Walton's reflections.  \"I'm a poor man,\" he said to himself, as he walked slowly homeward, \"but I wouldn't be as mean as Tom Green for all the money he's worth. He's made a hard bargain with me, but there was no help for it.\"      CHAPTER IV. A SUM IN ARITHMETIC   Harry kept on his way to school, and arrived just the bell rang. Many of my readers have seen a country schoolhouse, and will not be surprised to learn that the one in which our hero obtained his education was far from stately or ornamental, architecturally speaking. It was a one-story structure, about thirty feet square, showing traces of having been painted once, but standing greatly in need of another coat. Within were sixty desks, ranged in pairs, with aisles running between them. On one side sat the girls, on the other the boys. These were of all ages from five to sixteen. The boys' desks had suffered bad usage, having been whittled and hacked, and marked with the initials of the temporary occupants, with scarcely an exception. I never knew a Yankee boy who was not the possessor of a knife of some kind, nor one who could resist the temptation of using it for such unlawful purposes. Even our hero shared the common weakness, and his desk was distinguished from the rest by \"H. W.\" rudely carved in a conspicuous place.  The teacher of the school for the present session was Nathan Burbank, a country teacher of good repute, who usually taught six months in a year, and devoted the balance of the year to surveying land, whenever he could get employment in that line, and the cultivation of half a dozen acres of land, which kept him in vegetables, and enabled him to keep a cow. Altogether he succeeded in making a fair living, though his entire income would seem very small to many of my readers. He was not deeply learned, but his education was sufficient to meet the limited requirements of a country school.  This was the summer term, and it is the usual custom in New England that the summer schools should be taught by females. But in this particular school the experiment had been tried, and didn't work. It was found that the scholars were too unruly to be kept in subjection by a woman, and the school committee had therefore engaged Mr. Burbank, though, by so doing, the school term was shortened, as he asked fifty per cent. higher wages than a female teacher would have done. However, it was better to have a short school than an unruly school, and so the district acquiesced.  Eight weeks had not yet passed since the term commenced, and yet this was the last day but one. To-morrow would be examination day. To this Mr. Burbank made reference in a few remarks which he made at the commencement of the exercises.  He was rather a tall, spare man, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5977"],["title","Bound to Rise; Or, Up the Ladder (#3)"],["body","had a habit of brushing his hair upward, thus making the most of a moderate forehead. Probably he thought it made him look more intellectual.  \"Boys and girls,\" he said, \"to-morrow is our examination day. I've tried to bring you along as far as possible toward the temple of learning, but some of you have held back, and have not done as well as I should like--John Plympton, if you don't stop whispering I'll keep you after school--I want you all to remember that knowledge is better than land or gold. What would you think of a man who was worth a great fortune, and couldn't spell his name?--Mary Jones, can't you sit still till I get through?--It will be well for you to improve your opportunities while you are young, for by and by you will grow up, and have families to support, and will have no chance to learn--Jane Quimby, I wish you would stop giggling, I see nothing to laugh at--There are some of you who have studied well this term, and done the best you could. At the beginning of the term I determined to give a book to the most deserving scholar at the end of the term. I have picked out the boy, who, in my opinion, deserves it--Ephraim Higgins, you needn't move round in your seat. You are not the one.\"  There was a general laugh here, for Ephraim was distinguished chiefly for his laziness.  The teacher proceeded:  \"I do not mean to tell you to-day who it is. To-morrow I shall call out his name before the school committee, and present him the prize. I want you to do as well as you can to-morrow. I want you to do yourselves credit, and to do me credit, for I do not want to be ashamed of you. Peter Shelby, put back that knife into your pocket, and keep it there till I call up the class in whittling.\"  There was another laugh here at the teacher's joke, and Peter himself displayed a broad grin on his large, good-humored face.  \"We will now proceed to the regular lessons,\" said Mr. Burbank, in conclusion. \"First class in arithmetic will take their places.\"  The first class ranked as the highest class, and in it was Harry Walton.  \"What was your lesson to-day?\" asked the teacher.  \"Square root,\" answered Harry.  \"I will give you out a very simple sum to begin with. Now, attention all! Find the square root of 625. Whoever gets the answer first may hold up his hand.\"  The first to hold up his hand was Ephraim Higgins.  \"Have you got the answer?\" asked Mr. Burbank in some surprise. \"Yes, sir.\"  \"State it.\"  \"Forty-five.\"  \"How did you get it?\"  Ephraim scratched his head, and looked confused. The fact was, he was entirely ignorant of the method of extracting the square root, but had slyly looked at the slate of his neighbor, Harry Walton, and mistaken the 25 for 45, and hurriedly announced the answer, in the hope of obtaining credit for the same.  \"How did you get it?\" asked the teacher again.  Ephraim looked foolish.  \"Bring me your slate.\"  Ephraim reluctantly left his place, and went up to Mr. Burbank.  \"What have we here?\" said the teacher. \"Why, you have got down the 625, and nothing else, except 45. Where did you get that answer?\"  \"I guessed at it,\" answered Ephraim, hard pressed for an answer, and not liking to confess the truth--namely, that he had copied from Harry Walton.  \"So I supposed. The next time you'd better guess a little nearer right, or else give up guessing altogether. Harry Walton, I see your hand up. What is your answer?\"  \"Twenty-five, sir.\"  \"That is right.\"  Ephraim looked up suddenly. He now saw the explanation of his mistake.  \"Will you explain how you did it? You may go to the blackboard, and perform the operation once more, explaining as you go along, for the benefit of Ephraim Higgins, and any others who guessed at the answer. Ephraim, I want you to give particular attention, so that you can do yourself more credit next time. Now Harry, proceed.\"  Our hero explained the sum in a plain, straightforward way, for he thoroughly understood it.  \"Very well,\" said the schoolmaster, for this, rather than teacher, is the country name of the office. \"Now, Ephraim, do you think you can explain it?\"  \"I don't know, sir,\" said Ephraim, dubiously.  \"Suppose you try. You may take the same sum.\"  Ephraim advanced to the board with reluctance, for he was not ambitious, and had strong doubts about his competence for the task.  \"Put down 625.\"  Ephraim did so.  \"Now extract the square root. What do you do first?\"  \"Divide it into two figures each.\"  \"Divide it into periods of two figures each, I suppose you mean. Well, what will be the first period?\"  \"Sixty-two,\" answered Ephraim.  \"And what will be the second?\"  \"I don't see but one other figure.\"  \"Nor I. You have made a mistake. Harry, show to point it off.\"  Harry Walton did so.  \"Now what do you do next?\"  \"Divide the first figure by three.\"  \"What do you do that for?\"  Ephraim didn't know. It was only a guess of his, because he knew that the first figure of the answer was two, and this would result from dividing the first figure by three.  \"To bring the answer,\" he replied.  \"And I suppose you divide the next period by five, for the same reason, don't you?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You may take your seat, sir. You are an ornament to the class, and you may become a great mathematician, if you live to the age of Methuselah. I rather think it will take about nine hundred years for you to reach that, point.\"  The boys laughed. They always relish a joke at the expense of a companion, especially when perpetrated by the teacher.  \"Your method of extracting the square root is very original. You didn't find it in any arithmetic, did you?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"So I thought. You'd better take out a patent for it. The next boy may go to the board.\"  I have given a specimen of Mr. Burbank's method of conducting the school, but do not propose to enter into further details at present. It will doubtless recall to some of my readers experiences of their own, as the school I am describing is very similar to hundreds of country schools now in existence, and Mr. Burbank is the representative of a large class.      CHAPTER V. THE PRIZE WINNER   \"Are you going to the examination to-day, mother?\" asked Harry, at breakfast.  \"I should like to go,\" said Mrs. Walton, \"but I don't see how I can. To-day's my bakin' day, and somehow my work has got behindhand during the week.\"  \"I think Harry'll get the prize,\" said Tom, a boy of ten, not heretofore mentioned. He also attended the school, but was not as promising as his oldest brother.  \"What prize?\" asked Mrs. Walton, looking up with interest.  \"The master offered a prize, at the beginning of the term, to the scholar that was most faithful to his studies.\"  \"What is the prize?\"  \"A book.\"  \"Do you think you will get it, Harry?\" asked his mother.  \"I don't know,\" said Harry, modestly. \"I think I have some chance of getting it.\"  \"When will it be given?\"  \"Toward the close of the afternoon.\"  \"Maybe I can get time to come in then; I'll try.\"  \"I wish you would come, mother,\" said Harry earnestly. \"Only don't be disappointed if I don't get it. I've been trying, but there are some other good scholars.\"  \"You're the best, Harry,\" said Tom.  \"I don't know about that. I shan't count my chickens before they are hatched. Only if I am to get the prize I should like to have mother there.\"  \"I know you're a good scholar, and have improved your time,\" said Mrs. Walton. \"I wish your father was rich enough to send you to college.\"  \"I should like that very much,\" said Harry, his eyes sparkling at merely the suggestion.  \"But it isn't much use hoping,\" continued his mother, with a sigh. \"It doesn't seem clear whether we can get a decent living, much less send our boy to college. The cow is a great loss to us.\"  Just then Mr. Walton came in from the barn.  \"How do you like the new cow, father?\" asked Harry.  \"She isn't equal to our old one. She doesn't give as much milk within two quarts, if this morning's milking is a fair sample.\"  \"You paid enough for her,\" said Mrs. Walton.  \"I paid too much for her,\" answered her husband, \"but it was the best I could do. I had to buy on credit, and Squire Green knew I must pay his price, or go without.\"  \"Forty-three dollars is a great deal of money to pay for a cow.\"  \"Not for some cows. Some are worth more; but this one isn't.\"  \"What do you think she is really worth?\"  \"Thirty-three dollars is the most I would give if I had the cash to pay.\"  \"I think it's mean in Squire Green to take such advantage of you,\" said Harry.  \"You mustn't say so, Harry, for it won't do for me to get the squire's ill will. I am owing him money. I've agreed to pay for the cow in six months.\"  \"Can you do it?\"  \"I don't see how; but the money's on interest, and it maybe the squire'll let it stay. I forgot to say, though, that last evening when I went to get the cow he made me agree to forfeit ten dollars if I was not ready with the money and interest in six months. I am afraid he will insist on that if I can't keep my agreement.\"  \"It will be better for you to pay, and have done with it.\"  \"Of course. I shall try to do it, if I have to borrow the money. I suppose I shall have to do that.\"  Meantime Harry was busy thinking. \"Wouldn't it be possible for me to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months? I wish I could do it, and relieve father.\"  He began to think over all the possible ways of earning money, but there was nothing in particular to do in the town except to work for the farmers, and there was very little money to earn ill that way. Money is a scarce commodity with farmers everywhere. Most of their income is in the shape of farm produce, and used in the family. Only a small surplus is converted into money, and a dollar, therefore, seems more to them than to a mechanic, whose substantial income is perhaps less. This is the reason, probably, why farmers are generally loath to spend money. Harry knew that if he should hire out to a farmer for the six months the utmost he could expect would be a dollar a week, and it was"]]]
