BIOGRAPHY AND BIBLIOGRAPHY   Horatio Alger, Jr., an author who lived among and for boys and himself remained a boy in heart and association till death, was born at Revere, Mass., January 18, 1884. He was the son of a clergyman; was graduated at Harvard College in 1852, and at its Divinity School in 1860; and was pastor of the Unitarian Church at Brewster, Mass., in 1862-66. In the latter year he settled in New York and began drawing public attention to the condition and needs of street boys. He mingled with them, gained their confidence, showed a personal concern in their affairs, and stimulated them to honest and useful living. With his first story he won the hearts of all red-blooded boys every-where, and of the seventy or more that followed over a million copies were sold during the author's lifetime.  In his later life he was in appearance a short, stout, bald-headed man, with cordial manners and whimsical views of things that amused all who met him. He died at Natick, Mass., July 18, 1899.  Mr. Alger's stories are as popular now as when first published, because they treat of real live boys who were always up and about--just like the boys found everywhere to-day. They are pure in tone and inspiring in influence, and many reforms in the juvenile life of New York may be traced to them. Among the best known are:  Strong and Steady; Strive and Succeed; Try and Trust: Bound to Rise; Risen from the Ranks; Herbert Carter's Legacy; Brave and Bold; Jack's Ward; Shifting for Himself; Wait and Hope; Paul the Peddler; Phil the Fiddler: Slow and Sure: Julius the Street Boy; Tom the Bootblack; Struggling Upward; Facing the World; The Cash Boy; Making His Way; Tony the Tramp; Joe's Luck; Do and Dare: Only an Irish Boy; Sink or Swim; A Cousin's Conspiracy; Andy Gordon; Bob Burton; Harry Vane; Hector's Inheritance; Mark Manson's Triumph; Sam's Chance; The Telegraph Boy; The Young Adventurer; The Young Outlaw; The Young Salesman, and Luke Walton..     CHAPTER I   \"Sit up to the table, children, breakfast's ready.\"  The speaker was a woman of middle age, not good-looking in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but nevertheless she looked good. She was dressed with extreme plainness, in a cheap calico; but though cheap, the dress was neat. The children she addressed were six in number, varying in age from twelve to four. The oldest, Harry, the hero of the present story, was a broad-shouldered, sturdy boy, with a frank, open face, resolute, though good-natured.  \"Father isn't here,\" said Fanny, the second child.  \"He'll be in directly. He went to the store, and he may stop as he comes back to milk.\"  The table was set in the center of the room, covered with a coarse tablecloth. The breakfast provided was hardly of a kind to tempt an epicure. There was a loaf of bread cut into slices, and a dish of boiled potatoes. There was no butter and no meat, for the family were very poor.  The children sat up to the table and began to eat. They were blessed with good appetites, and did not grumble, as the majority of my readers would have done, at the scanty fare. They had not been accustomed to anything better, and their appetites were not pampered by indulgence.  They had scarcely commenced the meal when the father entered. Like his wife, he was coarsely dressed. In personal appearance he resembled his oldest boy. His wife looking up as he entered perceived that he looked troubled.  \"What is the matter, Hiram?\" she asked. \"You look as if something had happened.\"  \"Nothing has happened yet,\" he answered; \"but I am afraid we are going to lose the cow.\"  \"Going to lose the cow!\" repeated Mrs. Walton in dismay.  \"She is sick. I don't know what's the matter with her.\"  \"Perhaps it is only a trifle. She may get over it during the day.\"  \"She may, but I'm afraid she won't. Farmer Henderson's cow was taken just that way last fall, and he couldn't save her.\"  \"What are you going to do?\"  \"I have been to Elihu Perkins, and he's coming over to see what he can do for her. He can save her if anybody can.\"  The children listened to this conversation, and, young as they were, the elder ones understood the calamity involved in the possible loss of the cow. They had but one, and that was relied upon to furnish milk for the family, and, besides a small amount of butter and cheese, not for home consumption, but for sale at the store in exchange for necessary groceries. The Waltons were too poor to indulge in these luxuries.  The father was a farmer on a small scale; that is, he cultivated ten acres of poor land, out of which he extorted a living for his family, or rather a partial living. Besides this he worked for his neighbors by the day, sometimes as a farm laborer, sometimes at odd jobs of different kinds, for he was a sort of Jack at all trades. But his income, all told, was miserably small, and required the utmost economy and good management on the part of his wife to make it equal to the necessity of a growing family of children.  Hiram Walton was a man of good natural abilities, though of not much education, and after half an hour's conversation with him one would say, unhesitatingly, that he deserved a better fate than his hand-to-hand struggle with poverty. But he was one of those men who, for some unaccountable reason, never get on in the world. They can do a great many things creditably, but do not have the knack of conquering fortune. So Hiram had always been a poor man, and probably always would be poor. He was discontented at times, and often felt the disadvantages of his lot, but he was lacking in energy and ambition, and perhaps this was the chief reason why he did not succeed better.  After breakfast Elihu Perkins, the \"cow doctor,\" came to the door. He was an old man with iron-gray hair, and always wore steel-bowed spectacles; at least for twenty years nobody in the town could remember ever having seen him without them. It was the general opinion that he wore them during the night. Once when questioned on the subject, he laughingly said that he \"couldn't see to go to sleep without his specs\".  \"Well, neighbor Walton, so the cow's sick?\" he said, opening the outer door without ceremony.  \"Yes, Elihu, she looks down in the mouth. I hope you can save her.\"  \"I kin tell better when I've seen the critter. When you've got through breakfast, we'll go out to the barn.\"  \"I've got through now,\" said Mr. Walton, whose anxiety for the cow had diminished his appetite.  \"May I go too, father?\" asked Harry, rising from the table.  \"Yes, if you want to.\"  The three went out to the small, weather-beaten building which served as a barn for the want of a better. It was small, but still large enough to contain all the crops which Mr. Walton could raise. Probably he could have got more out of the land if he had had means to develop its resources; but it was naturally barren, and needed much more manure than he was able to spread over it.  So the yield to an acre was correspondingly small, and likely, from year to year, to grow smaller rather than larger.  They opened the small barn door, which led to the part occupied by the cow's stall. The cow was lying down, breathing with difficulty. Elihu Perkins looked at her sharply through his \"specs.\"  \"What do you think of her, neighbor Perkins?\" asked the owner, anxiously.  The cow doctor shifted a piece of tobacco from one cheek to the other, and looked wise.  \"I think the critter's nigh her end,\" he said, at last.  \"Is she so bad as that?\"  \"Pears like it. She looks like Farmer Henderson's that died a while ago. I couldn't save her.\"  \"Save my cow, if you can. I don't know what I should do without her.\"  \"I'll do my best, but you mustn't blame me if I can't bring her round. You see there's this about dumb critters that makes 'em harder to cure than human bein's. They can't tell their symptoms, nor how they feel; and that's why it's harder to be a cow doctor than a doctor for humans. You've got to go by the looks, and looks is deceivin'. If I could only ask the critter how she feels, and where she feels worst, I might have some guide to go by. Not but I've had my luck. There's more'n one of 'em I've saved, if I do say it myself.\"  \"I know you can save her if anyone can, Elihu,\" said Mr. Walton, who appreciated the danger of the cow, and was anxious to have the doctor begin.  \"Yes, I guess I know about as much about them critters as anybody,\" said the garrulous old man, who had a proper appreciation of his dignity and attainments as a cow doctor. \"I've had as good success as anyone I know on. If I can't cure her, you may call her a gone case. Have you got any hot water in the house?\"  \"I'll go in and see.\"  \"I'll go, father,\" said Harry.  \"Well, come right back. We have no time to lose.\"  Harry appreciated the need of haste as well as his father, and speedily reappeared with a pail of hot water.  \"That's right, Harry,\" said his father. \"Now you'd better go into the house and do your chores, so as not to be late for school.\"  Harry would have liked to remain and watch the steps which were being taken for the recovery of the cow; but he knew he had barely time to do the \"chores\" referred to before school, and he was far from wishing to be late there. He had an ardent thirst for learning, and, young as he was, ranked first in the district school which he attended. I am not about to present my young hero as a marvel of learning, for he was not so. He had improved what opportunities he had enjoyed, but these were very limited. Since he was nine years of age, his schooling had been for the most part limited to eleven weeks in the year. There was a summer as well as a winter school; but in the summer he only attended irregularly, being needed to work at home. His father could not afford to hire help,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5977"],["title","Bound to Rise; Or, Up the Ladder (#1)"],["body","there were many ways in which Harry, though young, could help him. So it happened that Harry, though a tolerably good scholar, was deficient in many respects, on account of the limited nature of his opportunities.  He set to work at once at the chores. First he went to the woodpile and sawed and split a quantity of wood, enough to keep the kitchen stove supplied till he came home again from school in the afternoon. This duty was regularly required of him. His father never touched the saw or the ax, but placed upon Harry the general charge of the fuel department.  After sawing and splitting what he thought to be sufficient, he carried it into the house by armfuls, and piled it up near the kitchen stove. He next drew several buckets of water from the well, for it was washing day, brought up some vegetables from the cellar to boil for dinner, and then got ready for school.      CHAPTER II. A CALAMITY   Efforts for the recovery of the cow went on. Elihu Perkins exhausted all his science in her behalf. I do not propose to detail his treatment, because I am not sure whether it was the best, and possibly some of my readers might adopt it under similar circumstances, and then blame me for its unfortunate issue. It is enough to say that the cow grew rapidly worse in spite of the hot-water treatment, and about eleven o'clock breathed her last. The sad intelligence was announced by Elihu, who first perceived it.  \"The critter's gone,\" he said. \"'Tain't no use doin' anything more.\"  \"The cow's dead!\" repeated Mr. Walton, sorrowfully. He had known for an hour that this would be the probable termination of the disease. Still while there was life there was hope. Now both went out together.  \"Yes, the critter's dead!\" said Elihu, philosophically, for he lost nothing by her. \"It was so to be, and there wa'n't no help for it. That's what I thought from the fust, but I was willin' to try.\"  \"Wasn't there anything that could have saved her?\"  Elihu shook his head decidedly.  \"If she could a-been saved, I could 'ave done it,\" he said. \"What I don't know about cow diseases ain't wuth knowin'.\"  Everyone is more or less conceited. Elihu's conceit was as to his scientific knowledge on the subject of cows and horses and their diseases. He spoke so confidently that Mr. Walton did not venture to dispute him.  \"I s'pose you're right, Elihu,\" he said; \"but it's hard on me.\"  \"Yes, neighbor, it's hard on you, that's a fact. What was she wuth?\"  \"I wouldn't have taken forty dollars for her yesterday.\"  \"Forty dollars is a good sum.\"  \"It is to me. I haven't got five dollars in the world outside of my farm.\"  \"I wish I could help you, neighbor Walton, but I'm a poor man myself.\"  \"I know you are, Elihu. Somehow it doesn't seem fair that my only cow should be taken, when Squire Green has got ten, and they're all alive and well. If all his cows should die, he could buy as many more and not feel the loss.\"  \"Squire Green's a close man.\"  \"He's mean enough, if he is rich.\"  \"Sometimes the richest are the meanest.\"  \"In his case it is true.\"  \"He could give you a cow just as well as not. If I was as rich as he, I'd do it.\"  \"I believe you would, Elihu; but there's some difference between you and him.\"  \"Maybe the squire would lend you money to buy a cow. He always keeps money to lend on high interest.\"  Mr. Walton reflected a moment, then said slowly, \"I must have a cow, and I don't know of any other way, but I hate to go to him.\"  \"He's the only man that's likely to have money to lend in town.\"  \"Well, I'll go.\"  \"Good luck to you, neighbor Walton.\"  \"I need it enough,\" said Hiram Walton, soberly. \"If it comes, it'll be the first time for a good many years.\"  \"Well, I'll be goin', as I can't do no more good.\"  Hiram Walton went into the house, and a look at his face told his wife the news he brought before his lips uttered it.  \"Is she dead, Hiram?\"  \"Yes, the cow's dead. Forty dollars clean gone,\" he said, rather bitterly.  \"Don't be discouraged, Hiram. It's bad luck, but worse things might happen.\"  \"Such as what?\"  \"Why, the house might burn down, or--or some of us might fall sick and die. It's better that it should be the cow.\"  \"You're right there; but though it's pleasant to have so many children round, we shan't like to see them starving.\"  \"They are not starving yet, and please God they won't yet awhile. Some help will come to us.\"  Mrs. Walton sometimes felt despondent herself, but when she saw her husband affected, like a good wife she assumed cheerfulness, in order to raise his spirits. So now, things looked a little more hopeful to him, after he had talked to his wife. He soon took his hat, and approached the door.  \"Where are you going, Hiram?\" she asked.  \"Going to see if Squire Green will lend me money; enough to buy another cow.\"  \"That's right, Hiram. Don't sit down discouraged, but see what you can do to repair the loss.\"  \"I wish there was anybody else to go to. Squire Green is a very mean man, and he will try to take advantage of any need.\"  \"It is better to have a poor resource than none at all.\"  \"Well, I'll go and see what can be done.\"  Squire Green was the rich man of the town. He had inherited from his father, just as he came of age, a farm of a hundred and fifty acres, and a few hundred dollars.  The land was not good, and far from productive; but he had scrimped and saved and pinched and denied himself, spending almost nothing, till the little money which the farm annually yielded him had accumulated to a considerable sum. Then, too, as there were no banks near at hand to accommodate borrowers, the squire used to lend money to his poorer neighbors. He took care not to exact more than six per cent. openly, but it was generally understood that the borrower must pay a bonus besides to secure a loan, which, added to the legal interest, gave him a very handsome consideration for the use of his spare funds. So his money rapidly increased, doubling every five or six years through his shrewd mode of management, and every year he grew more economical. His wife had died ten years before. She had worked hard for very poor pay, for the squire's table was proverbially meager, and her bills for dress, judging from her appearance, must have been uncommonly small.  The squire had one son, now in the neighborhood of thirty, but he had not been at home for several years. As soon as he attained his majority he left the homestead, and set out to seek his fortune elsewhere. He vowed he wouldn't any longer submit to the penurious ways of the squire. So the old man was left alone, but he did not feel the solitude. He had his gold, and that was company enough. A time was coming when the two must part company, for when death should come he must leave the gold behind; but he did not like to think of that, putting away the idea as men will unpleasant subjects. This was the man to whom Hiram Walton applied for help in his misfortune.  \"Is the squire at home?\" he asked, at the back door. In that household the front door was never used. There was a parlor, but it had not been opened since Mrs. Green's funeral.  \"He's out to the barn,\" said Hannah Green, a niece of the old man, who acted as maid of all work.  \"I'll go out there.\"  The barn was a few rods northeast of the house, and thither Mr. Walton directed his steps.  Entering, he found the old man engaged in some light work.  \"Good morning, Squire Green.\"  \"Good morning, Mr. Walton,\" returned the squire.  He was a small man, with a thin figure, and a face deep seamed with wrinkles, more so than might have been expected in a man of his age, for he was only just turned of sixty; but hard work, poor and scanty food and sharp calculation, were responsible for them.  \"How are you gettin' on?\" asked the squire.  This was rather a favorite question of his, it being so much the custom for his neighbors to apply to him when in difficulties, so that their misfortune he had come to regard as his harvests..  \"I've met with a loss,\" answered Hiram Walton.  \"You don't say so,\" returned the squire, with instant attention. \"What's happened?\"  \"My cow is dead.\"  \"When did she die?\"  \"This morning.\"  \"What was the matter?\"  \"I don't know. I didn't notice but that she was welt enough last night; but this morning when I went out to the barn, she was lying down breathing heavily.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"I called in Elihu Perkins, and we worked over her for three hours; but it wasn't of any use; she died half an hour ago.\"  \"I hope it isn't any disease that's catchin',\" said the squire in alarm, thinking of his ten. \"It would be a bad job if it should get among mine.\"  \"It's a bad job for me, squire. I hadn't but one cow, and she's gone.\"  \"Just so, just so. I s'pose you'll buy another.\"  \"Yes, I must have a cow. My children live on bread and milk mostly. Then there's the butter and cheese, that I trade off at the store for groceries.\"  \"Just so, just so. Come into the house, neighbor Walton.\"  The squire guessed his visitor's business in advance, and wanted to take time to talk it over. He would first find out how great his neighbor's necessity was, and then he accommodated him, would charge him accordingly.      CHAPTER III. HIRAM'S MOTTO   There was a little room just off the kitchen, where the squire had an old-fashioned desk. Here it was that he transacted his business, and in the desk he kept his papers. It was into this room that he introduced Mr. Walton.  \"Set down, set down, neighbor Walton,\" he said. \"We'll talk this thing over. So you've got to have a cow?\"  \"Yes, I must have one.\"  The squire fixed his eyes cunningly on his intended victim, and said, \"Goin' to buy one in town?\"  \"I don't know of any that's for sale.\"  \"How much do you calc'late to pay?\"  \"I suppose I'll have to pay thirty dollars.\"  Squire Green shook his head.  \"More'n that, neighbor Walton. You can't get a decent cow for thirty dollars. I hain't got one that isn't wuth more, though I've got ten in my barn.\"  \"Thirty dollars is all I "]]]
