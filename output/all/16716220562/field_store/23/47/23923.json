I got some pretty good Scotch cloth, and made me, of mornings and nights, when nobody saw me, two shifts; and I have enough left for two shirts, and two shifts, for you my dear father and mother. When I come home, I’ll make them for you, and desire your acceptance.  Then I bought of a pedlar, two pretty enough round-eared caps, a little straw-hat, and a pair of knit mittens, turned up with white calico; and two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose, that make a smartish appearance, with white clocks, I’ll assure you; and two yards of black riband for my shift sleeves, and to serve as a necklace; and when I had ’em all come home, I went and looked upon them once in two hours, for two days together: For, you must know, though I be with Mrs. Jervis, I keep my own little apartment still for my clothes, and nobody goes thither but myself. You’ll say I was no bad housewife to have saved so much money; but my dear good lady was always giving me something.  I believed myself the more obliged to do this, because, as I was turned away for what my good master thought want of duty; and as he expected other returns for his presents, than I intended to make him, so I thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when I went away; for, you know, if I would not earn his wages, why should I have them?  Don’t trouble yourself about the four guineas, nor borrow to make them up; for they were given me, with some silver, as I told you, as a perquisite, being what my lady had about her when she died; and, as I hope for no wages, I am so vain as to think I have deserved all that money in the fourteen months, since my lady’s death, for she, good soul, overpaid me before, in learning and other kindnesses. Had she lived, none of these things might have happened!—But I ought to be thankful ’tis no worse. Every thing will turn about for the best: that’s my confidence.  So, as I was saying, I have provided a new and more suitable dress, and I long to appear in it, more than ever I did in any new clothes in my life: for then I shall be soon after with you, and at ease in my mind—But, mum! Here he comes, I believe.—I am, etc.   LETTER XXI     MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,  I was forced to break off: for I feared my master was coming: but it proved to be only Mrs. Jervis. She said, I can’t endure you should be so much by yourself, Pamela. And I, said I, dread nothing so much as company; for my heart was up at my mouth now, for fear my master was coming. But I always rejoice to see dear Mrs. Jervis.  Said she, I have had a world of talk with my master about you. I am sorry for it, said I, that I am made of so much consequence as to be talked of by him. O, said she, I must not tell you all; but you are of more consequence to him than you think for——  Or wish for, said I; for the fruits of being of consequence to him, would make me of none to myself, or any body else.  Said she, Thou art as witty as any lady in the land; I wonder where thou gottest it. But they must be poor ladies, with such great opportunities, I am sure, if they have no more wit than I.—But let that pass.  I suppose, said I, that I am of so much consequence, however, as to vex him, if it be but to think he can’t make a fool of such a one as I; and that is nothing at all, but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition, which he did not expect, and knows not how to put up with.  There is something in that, may be, said she: but, indeed, Pamela, he is very angry with you too; and calls you twenty perverse things; wonders at his own folly, to have shewn you so much favour, as he calls it; which he was first inclined to, he says, for his mother’s sake, and would have persisted to shew you for your own, if you was not your own enemy.  Nay, now I shan’t love you, Mrs. Jervis, said I; you are going to persuade me to ask to stay, though you know the hazards I run.—No, said she, he says you shall go; for he thinks it won’t be for his reputation to keep you: but he wished (don’t speak of it for the world, Pamela,) that he knew a lady of birth, just such another as yourself, in person and mind, and he would marry her to-morrow.  I coloured up to the ears at this word: but said, Yet, if I was the lady of birth, and he would offer to be rude first, as he has twice done to poor me, I don’t know whether I would have him: For she that can bear an insult of that kind, I should think not worthy to be a gentleman’s wife: any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it.  Nay, now, Pamela, said she, thou carriest thy notions a great way. Well, dear Mrs. Jervis, said I, very seriously, for I could not help it, I am more full of fears than ever. I have only to beg of you, as one of the best friends I have in the world, to say nothing of my asking to stay. To say my master likes me, when I know what end he aims at, is abomination to my ears; and I shan’t think myself safe till I am at my poor father’s and mother’s.  She was a little angry with me, till I assured her that I had not the least uneasiness on her account, but thought myself safe under her protection and friendship. And so we dropt the discourse for that time.  I hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days; after which I have only some linen to get up, and shall then let you know how I contrive as to my passage; for the heavy rains will make it sad travelling on foot: but may be I may get a place to which is ten miles of the way, in farmer Nichols’s close cart; for I can’t sit a horse well at all, and may be nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way. But I hope to let you know more. From, etc.   LETTER XXII     MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER,  All my fellow-servants have now some notion that I am to go away; but can’t imagine for what. Mrs. Jervis tells them, that my father and mother, growing in years, cannot live without me; and so I go home to them, to help to comfort their old age; but they seem not to believe it.  What they found it out by was; the butler heard him say to me, as I passed by him, in the entry leading to the hall, Who’s that? Pamela, sir, said I. Pamela! said he, How long are you to stay here?—Only, please your honour, said I, till I have done the waistcoat; and it is almost finished.—You might, says he, (very roughly indeed,) have finished that long enough ago, I should have thought. Indeed, and please your honour, said I, I have worked early and late upon it; there is a great deal of work in it.—Work in it! said he; You mind your pen more than your needle; I don’t want such idle sluts to stay in my house.  He seemed startled, when he saw the butler, as he entered the hall, where Mr. Jonathan stood. What do you here? said he.—The butler was as much confounded as I; for, never having been taxed so roughly, I could not help crying sadly; and got out of both their ways to Mrs. Jervis, and told my complaint. This love, said she, is the d——! In how many strange shapes does it make people shew themselves! And in some the farthest from their hearts.  So one, and then another, has been since whispering, Pray, Mrs. Jervis, are we to lose Mrs. Pamela? as they always call me—What has she done? And she tells them, as above, about going home to you.  She said afterwards to me, Well, Pamela, you have made our master, from the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world, one of the most peevish. But you have it in your power to make him as sweet-tempered as ever; though I hope you’ll never do it on his terms.  This was very good in Mrs. Jervis; but it intimated, that she thought as ill of his designs as I; and as she knew his mind more than I, it convinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could.  My master came in, just now, to speak to Mrs. Jervis about household matters, having some company to dine with him to-morrow; and I stood up, and having been crying at his roughness in the entry, I turned away my face.  You may well, said he, turn away your cursed face; I wish I had never seen it!—Mrs. Jervis, how long is she to be about this waistcoat?  Sir, said I, if your honour had pleased, I would have taken it with me; and though it would be now finished in a few hours, I will do so still; and remove this hated poor Pamela out of your house and sight for ever.  Mrs. Jervis, said he, not speaking to me, I believe this little slut has the power of witchcraft, if ever there was a witch; for she enchants all that come near her. She makes even you, who should know better what the world is, think her an angel of light.  I offered to go away; for I believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my place, for all this his great wrath: and he said, Stay here! Stay here, when I bid you! and snatched my hand. I trembled, and said, I will! I will! for he hurt my fingers, he grasped me so hard.  He seemed to have a mind to say something to me; but broke off abruptly, and said, Begone! And away I tripped as fast as I could: and he and Mrs. Jervis had a deal of talk, as she told me; and among the rest, he expressed himself vexed to have spoken in Mr. Jonathan’s hearing.  Now you must know, that Mr. Jonathan, our butler, is a very grave good sort of old man, with his hair as white as silver! and an honest worthy man he is. I was hurrying out with a flea in my ear, as the saying is, and going down stairs into the parlour, met him. He took hold of my hand (in a gentler manner, though, than my master) with both his; and he said, Ah! sweet, sweet Mrs. Pamela! what is it I heard but just now!—I am sorry at my heart; but I am sure I will sooner believe any body in fault than you. Thank you, Mr. Jonathan, said I; but as you value your place, don’t be seen speaking to such a one as me. I cried too; and slipt away as fast as I could from him, for his own sake, lest he should be seen to pity me.  And now I will give you an instance how much I am in Mr. Longman’s esteem also.  I had lost my pen some how; and my paper being written out, I stepped to Mr. Longman’s, our"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61262"],["title","Poirot Investigates (#0)"],["body","INVESTIGATES       BY THE SAME AUTHOR    THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES    THE SECRET ADVERSARY    THE MURDER ON THE LINKS    THE BODLEY HEAD       POIROT INVESTIGATES    BY AGATHA CHRISTIE       LONDON    JOHN LANE THE BODLEY HEAD LIMITED       First published in Great Britain by   John Lane Company, The Bodley Head Limited, 1924    Copyright © 1924 Agatha Christie Limited       CONTENTS     I The Adventure of “The Western Star”    II The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor    III The Adventure of the Cheap Flat    IV The Mystery of Hunter’s Lodge    V The Million Dollar Bond Robbery    VI The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb    VII Jewel Robbery at the _Grand Metropolitan_    VIII The Kidnapped Prime Minister    IX The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim    X The Adventure of the Italian Nobleman    XI The Case of the Missing Will       POIROT INVESTIGATES       POIROT INVESTIGATES     I     The Adventure of “The Western Star”  I was standing at the window of Poirot’s rooms looking out idly on the street below.  “That’s queer,” I ejaculated suddenly beneath my breath.  “What is, _mon ami_?” asked Poirot placidly, from the depths of his comfortable chair.  “Deduce, Poirot, from the following facts! Here is a young lady, richly dressed—fashionable hat, magnificent furs. She is coming along slowly, looking up at the houses as she goes. Unknown to her, she is being shadowed by three men and a middle-aged woman. They have just been joined by an errand boy who points after the girl, gesticulating as he does so. What drama is this being played? Is the girl a crook, and are the shadowers detectives preparing to arrest her? Or are _they_ the scoundrels, and are they plotting to attack an innocent victim? What does the great detective say?”  “The great detective, _mon ami_, chooses, as ever, the simplest course. He rises to see for himself.” And my friend joined me at the window.  In a minute he gave vent to an amused chuckle.  “As usual, your facts are tinged with your incurable romanticism. That is Miss Mary Marvell, the film star. She is being followed by a bevy of admirers who have recognized her. And, _en passant_, my dear Hastings, she is quite aware of the fact!”  I laughed.  “So all is explained! But you get no marks for that, Poirot. It was a mere matter of recognition.”  “_En vérité!_ And how many times have you seen Mary Marvell on the screen, _mon cher_?”  I thought.  “About a dozen times perhaps.”  “And I—once! Yet _I_ recognize her, and _you_ do not.”  “She looks so different,” I replied rather feebly.  “Ah! _Sacré_!” cried Poirot. “Is it that you expect her to promenade herself in the streets of London in a cowboy hat, or with bare feet, and a bunch of curls, as an Irish colleen? Always with you it is the non-essentials! Remember the case of the dancer, Valerie Saintclair.”  I shrugged my shoulders, slightly annoyed.  “But console yourself, _mon ami_,” said Poirot, calming down. “All cannot be as Hercule Poirot! I know it well.”  “You really have the best opinion of yourself of anyone I ever knew!” I cried, divided between amusement and annoyance.  “What will you? When one is unique, one knows it! And others share that opinion—even, if I mistake not, Miss Mary Marvell.”  “What?”  “Without doubt. She is coming here.”  “How do you make that out?”  “Very simply. This street, it is not aristocratic, _mon ami_! In it there is no fashionable doctor, no fashionable dentist—still less is there a fashionable milliner! But there _is_ a fashionable detective. _Oui_, my friend, it is true—I am become the mode, the _dernier cri_! One says to another: ‘_Comment?_ You have lost your gold pencil-case? You must go to the little Belgian. He is too marvellous! Every one goes! _Courez!’_ And they arrive! In flocks, _mon ami_! With problems of the most foolish!” A bell rang below. “What did I tell you? That is Miss Marvell.”  As usual, Poirot was right. After a short interval, the American film star was ushered in, and we rose to our feet.  Mary Marvell was undoubtedly one of the most popular actresses on the screen. She had only lately arrived in England in company with her husband, Gregory B. Rolf, also a film actor. Their marriage had taken place about a year ago in the States and this was their first visit to England. They had been given a great reception. Every one was prepared to go mad over Mary Marvell, her wonderful clothes, her furs, her jewels, above all one jewel, the great diamond which had been nicknamed, to match its owner, “the Western Star.” Much, true and untrue, had been written about this famous stone which was reported to be insured for the enormous sum of fifty thousand pounds.  All these details passed rapidly through my mind as I joined with Poirot in greeting our fair client.  Miss Marvell was small and slender, very fair and girlish-looking, with the wide innocent blue eyes of a child.  Poirot drew forward a chair for her, and she commenced talking at once.  “You will probably think me very foolish, Monsieur Poirot, but Lord Cronshaw was telling me last night how wonderfully you cleared up the mystery of his nephew’s death, and I felt that I just must have your advice. I dare say it’s only a silly hoax—Gregory says so—but it’s just worrying me to death.”  She paused for breath. Poirot beamed encouragement.  “Proceed, Madame. You comprehend, I am still in the dark.”  “It’s these letters.” Miss Marvell unclasped her handbag, and drew out three envelopes which she handed to Poirot.  The latter scrutinized them closely.  “Cheap paper—the name and address carefully printed. Let us see the inside.” He drew out the enclosure.  I had joined him, and was leaning over his shoulder. The writing consisted of a single sentence, carefully printed like the envelope. It ran as follows:  “The great diamond which is the left eye of the god must return whence it came.”  The second letter was couched in precisely the same terms, but the third was more explicit:  “You have been warned. You have not obeyed. Now the diamond will be taken from you. At the full of the moon, the two diamonds which are the left and right eye of the god shall return. So it is written.”  “The first letter I treated as a joke,” explained Miss Marvell. “When I got the second, I began to wonder. The third one came yesterday, and it seemed to me that, after all, the matter might be more serious than I had imagined.”  “I see they did not come by post, these letters.”  “No; they were left by hand—by a _Chinaman._ That is what frightens me.”  “Why?”  “Because it was from a Chink in San Francisco that Gregory bought the stone three years ago.”  “I see, madame, that you believe the diamond referred to to be——”  “‘The Western Star,’” finished Miss Marvell. “That’s so. At the time, Gregory remembers that there was some story attached to the stone, but the Chink wasn’t handing out any information. Gregory says he seemed just scared to death, and in a mortal hurry to get rid of the thing. He only asked about a tenth of its value. It was Greg’s wedding present to me.”  Poirot nodded thoughtfully.  “The story seems of an almost unbelievable romanticism. And yet—who knows? I pray of you, Hastings, hand me my little almanac.”  I complied.  “_Voyons!_” said Poirot, turning the leaves.  “When is the date of the full moon? Ah, Friday next. That is in three days’ time. _Eh bien_, madame, you seek my advice—I give it to you. This _belle histoire_ may be a hoax—but it may not! Therefore I counsel you to place the diamond in my keeping until after Friday next. Then we can take what steps we please.”  A slight cloud passed over the actress’s face, and she replied constrainedly:  “I’m afraid that’s impossible.”  “You have it with you—_hein_?” Poirot was watching her narrowly.  The girl hesitated a moment, then slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown, drawing out a long thin chain. She leaned forward, unclosing her hand. In the palm, a stone of white fire, exquisitely set in platinum, lay and winked at us solemnly.  Poirot drew in his breath with a long hiss.  “_Épatant!_” he murmured. “You permit, madame?” He took the jewel in his own hand and scrutinized it keenly, then restored it to her with a little bow. “A magnificent stone—without a flaw. Ah, _cent tonnerres!_ and you carry it about with you, _comme ça_!”  “No, no, I’m very careful really, Monsieur Poirot. As a rule it’s locked up in my jewel-case, and left in the hotel safe deposit. We’re staying at the _Magnificent_, you know. I just brought it along to-day for you to see.”  “And you will leave it with me, _n’est-ce pas_? You will be advised by Papa Poirot?”  “Well, you see, it’s this way, Monsieur Poirot. On Friday we’re going down to Yardly Chase to spend a few days with Lord and Lady Yardly.”  Her words awoke a vague echo of remembrance in my mind. Some gossip—what was it now? A few years ago Lord and Lady Yardly had paid a visit to the States, rumour had it that his lordship had rather gone the pace out there with the assistance of some lady friends—but surely there was something more, some gossip which coupled Lady Yardly’s name with that of a “movie” star in California—why! it came to me in a flash—of course it was none other than Gregory B. Rolf.  “I’ll let you into a little secret, Monsieur Poirot,” Miss Marvell was continuing. “We’ve got a deal on with Lord Yardly. There’s some chance of our arranging to film a play down there in his ancestral pile.”  “At Yardly Chase?” I cried, interested. “Why, it’s one of the show places of England.”  Miss Marvell nodded.  “I guess it’s the real old feudal stuff all right. But he wants a pretty stiff price, and of course I don’t know yet whether the deal will go through, but Greg and I always like to combine business with pleasure.”  “But—I demand pardon if I am dense, madame—surely it is possible to visit Yardly Chase without taking the diamond with you?”  A shrewd, hard look came into Miss Marvell’s eyes which belied their childlike appearance. She looked suddenly a"]]]
