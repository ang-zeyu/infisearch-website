I stepped on a car standing at the corner of 4th and Pine streets, and saw a crowd of people standing quietly in front of the head-quarters, who were there for the purpose of hauling down the flag.  There were squads of other people at intervals down the street.  They too were quiet but filled with suppressed rage, and muttered their resentment at the insult to, what they called, \"their\" flag.  Before the car I was in had started, a dapper little fellow--he would be called a dude at this day --stepped in.  He was in a great state of excitement and used adjectives freely to express his contempt for the Union and for those who had just perpetrated such an outrage upon the rights of a free people.  There was only one other passenger in the car besides myself when this young man entered.  He evidently expected to find nothing but sympathy when he got away from the \"mud sills\" engaged in compelling a \"free people\" to pull down a flag they adored.  He turned to me saying:  \"Things have come to a ---- pretty pass when a free people can't choose their own flag. Where I came from if a man dares to say a word in favor of the Union we hang him to a limb of the first tree we come to.\"  I replied that \"after all we were not so intolerant in St. Louis as we might be; I had not seen a single rebel hung yet, nor heard of one; there were plenty of them who ought to be, however.\"  The young man subsided.  He was so crestfallen that I believe if I had ordered him to leave the car he would have gone quietly out, saying to himself:  \"More Yankee oppression.\"  By nightfall the late defenders of Camp Jackson were all within the walls of the St. Louis arsenal, prisoners of war.  The next day I left St. Louis for Mattoon, Illinois, where I was to muster in the regiment from that congressional district.  This was the 21st Illinois infantry, the regiment of which I subsequently became colonel.  I mustered one regiment afterwards, when my services for the State were about closed.  Brigadier-General John Pope was stationed at Springfield, as United States mustering officer, all the time I was in the State service.  He was a native of Illinois and well acquainted with most of the prominent men in the State.  I was a carpet-bagger and knew but few of them. While I was on duty at Springfield the senators, representatives in Congress, ax-governors and the State legislators were nearly all at the State capital.  The only acquaintance I made among them was with the governor, whom I was serving, and, by chance, with Senator S. A. Douglas.  The only members of Congress I knew were Washburne and Philip Foulk.  With the former, though he represented my district and we were citizens of the same town, I only became acquainted at the meeting when the first company of Galena volunteers was raised.  Foulk I had known in St. Louis when I was a citizen of that city.  I had been three years at West Point with Pope and had served with him a short time during the Mexican war, under General Taylor.  I saw a good deal of him during my service with the State.  On one occasion he said to me that I ought to go into the United States service.  I told him I intended to do so if there was a war.  He spoke of his acquaintance with the public men of the State, and said he could get them to recommend me for a position and that he would do all he could for me.  I declined to receive endorsement for permission to fight for my country.  Going home for a day or two soon after this conversation with General Pope, I wrote from Galena the following letter to the Adjutant-General of the Army.   GALENA, ILLINOIS, May 24, 1861.  COL. L. THOMAS Adjt.  Gen.  U. S. A., Washington, D. C.  SIR:--Having served for fifteen years in the regular army, including four years at West Point, and feeling it the duty of every one who has been educated at the Government expense to offer their services for the support of that Government, I have the honor, very respectfully, to tender my services, until the close of the war, in such capacity as may be offered.  I would say, in view of my present age and length of service, I feel myself competent to command a regiment, if the President, in his judgment, should see fit to intrust one to me.  Since the first call of the President I have been serving on the staff of the Governor of this State, rendering such aid as I could in the organization of our State militia, and am still engaged in that capacity.  A letter addressed to me at Springfield, Illinois, will reach me.  I am very respectfully, Your obt. svt., U. S. GRANT.   This letter failed to elicit an answer from the Adjutant-General of the Army.  I presume it was hardly read by him, and certainly it could not have been submitted to higher authority. Subsequent to the war General Badeau having heard of this letter applied to the War Department for a copy of it.  The letter could not be found and no one recollected ever having seen it.  I took no copy when it was written.  Long after the application of General Badeau, General Townsend, who had become Adjutant-General of the Army, while packing up papers preparatory to the removal of his office, found this letter in some out-of-the-way place. It had not been destroyed, but it had not been regularly filed away.  I felt some hesitation in suggesting rank as high as the colonelcy of a regiment, feeling somewhat doubtful whether I would be equal to the position.  But I had seen nearly every colonel who had been mustered in from the State of Illinois, and some from Indiana, and felt that if they could command a regiment properly, and with credit, I could also.  Having but little to do after the muster of the last of the regiments authorized by the State legislature, I asked and obtained of the governor leave of absence for a week to visit my parents in Covington, Kentucky, immediately opposite Cincinnati.  General McClellan had been made a major-general and had his headquarters at Cincinnati.  In reality I wanted to see him.  I had known him slightly at West Point, where we served one year together, and in the Mexican war.  I was in hopes that when he saw me he would offer me a position on his staff.  I called on two successive days at his office but failed to see him on either occasion, and returned to Springfield.    CHAPTER XVIII.  APPOINTED COLONEL OF THE 21ST ILLINOIS--PERSONNEL OF THE REGIMENT --GENERAL LOGAN--MARCH TO MISSOURI--MOVEMENT AGAINST HARRIS AT FLORIDA, MO.--GENERAL POPE IN COMMAND--STATIONED AT MEXICO, MO.  While I was absent from the State capital on this occasion the President's second call for troops was issued.  This time it was for 300,000 men, for three years or the war.  This brought into the United States service all the regiments then in the State service.  These had elected their officers from highest to lowest and were accepted with their organizations as they were, except in two instances.  A Chicago regiment, the 19th infantry, had elected a very young man to the colonelcy.  When it came to taking the field the regiment asked to have another appointed colonel and the one they had previously chosen made lieutenant-colonel.  The 21st regiment of infantry, mustered in by me at Mattoon, refused to go into the service with the colonel of their selection in any position.  While I was still absent Governor Yates appointed me colonel of this latter regiment.  A few days after I was in charge of it and in camp on the fair grounds near Springfield.  My regiment was composed in large part of young men of as good social position as any in their section of the State.  It embraced the sons of farmers, lawyers, physicians, politicians, merchants, bankers and ministers, and some men of maturer years who had filled such positions themselves.  There were also men in it who could be led astray; and the colonel, elected by the votes of the regiment, had proved to be fully capable of developing all there was in his men of recklessness.  It was said that he even went so far at times as to take the guard from their posts and go with them to the village near by and make a night of it. When there came a prospect of battle the regiment wanted to have some one else to lead them.  I found it very hard work for a few days to bring all the men into anything like subordination; but the great majority favored discipline, and by the application of a little regular army punishment all were reduced to as good discipline as one could ask.  The ten regiments which had volunteered in the State service for thirty days, it will be remembered, had done so with a pledge to go into the National service if called upon within that time. When they volunteered the government had only called for ninety days' enlistments.  Men were called now for three years or the war.  They felt that this change of period released them from the obligation of re-volunteering.  When I was appointed colonel, the 21st regiment was still in the State service. About the time they were to be mustered into the United States service, such of them as would go, two members of Congress from the State, McClernand and Logan, appeared at the capital and I was introduced to them.  I had never seen either of them before, but I had read a great deal about them, and particularly about Logan, in the newspapers.  Both were democratic members of Congress, and Logan had been elected from the southern district of the State, where he had a majority of eighteen thousand over his Republican competitor.  His district had been settled originally by people from the Southern States, and at the breaking out of secession they sympathized with the South.  At the first outbreak of war some of them joined the Southern army; many others were preparing to do so; others rode over the country at night denouncing the Union, and made it as necessary to guard railroad bridges over which National troops had to pass in southern Illinois, as it was in Kentucky or any of the border slave states. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5861"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 2. (#7)"],["body"," Logan's popularity in this district was unbounded.  He knew almost enough of the people in it by their Christian names, to form an ordinary congressional district.  As he went in politics, so his district was sure to go.  The Republican papers had been demanding that he should announce where he stood on the questions which at that time engrossed the whole of public thought.  Some were very bitter in their denunciations of his silence.  Logan was not a man to be coerced into an utterance by threats.  He did, however, come out in a speech before the adjournment of the special session of Congress which was convened by the President soon after his inauguration, and announced his undying loyalty and devotion to the Union. But I had not happened to see that speech, so that when I first met Logan my impressions were those formed from reading denunciations of him. McClernand, on the other hand, had early taken strong grounds for the maintenance of the Union and had been praised accordingly by the Republican papers.  The gentlemen who presented these two members of Congress asked me if I would have any objections to their addressing my regiment.  I hesitated a little before answering.  It was but a few days before the time set for mustering into the United States service such of the men as were willing to volunteer for three years or the war.  I had some doubt as to the effect a speech from Logan might have; but as he was with McClernand, whose sentiments on the all-absorbing questions of the day were well known, I gave my consent.  McClernand spoke first; and Logan followed in a speech which he has hardly equalled since for force and eloquence.  It breathed a loyalty and devotion to the Union which inspired my men to such a point that they would have volunteered to remain in the army as long as an enemy of the country continued to bear arms against it.  They entered the United States service almost to a man.  General Logan went to his part of the State and gave his attention to raising troops.  The very men who at first made it necessary to guard the roads in southern Illinois became the defenders of the Union.  Logan entered the service himself as colonel of a regiment and rapidly rose to the rank of major-general.  His district, which had promised at first to give much trouble to the government, filled every call made upon it for troops, without resorting to the draft.  There was no call made when there were not more volunteers than were asked for. That congressional district stands credited at the War Department to-day with furnishing more men for the army than it was called on to supply.  I remained in Springfield with my regiment until the 3d of July, when I was ordered to Quincy, Illinois.  By that time the regiment was in a good state of discipline and the officers and men were well up in the company drill.  There was direct railroad communication between Springfield and Quincy, but I thought it would be good preparation for the troops to march there.  We had no transportation for our camp and garrison equipage, so wagons were hired for the occasion and on the 3d of July we started.  There was no hurry, but fair marches were made every day until the Illinois River was crossed.  There I was overtaken by a dispatch saying that the destination of the regiment had been changed to Ironton, Missouri, and ordering me to halt where I was and await the arrival of a steamer which had been dispatched up the Illinois River to take the regiment to St. Louis.  The boat, when it did come, grounded on a sand-bar a few miles below where we were in camp.  We remained there several days waiting to have the boat get off the bar, but before this occurred news came that an Illinois regiment was surrounded by rebels at a point on the Hannibal and St. Joe Railroad some miles west of Palmyra, in Missouri, and I was ordered to proceed with all dispatch to their relief.  We took the cars and reached Quincy in a few hours.  When I left Galena for the last time to take command of the 21st regiment I took with me my oldest son, Frederick D. Grant, then a lad of eleven years of age.  On receiving the order to take rail for Quincy I wrote to Mrs. Grant, to relieve what I supposed would be her great anxiety for one so young going into danger, that I would send Fred home from Quincy by river.  I received a prompt letter in reply decidedly disapproving my proposition, and urging that the lad should be allowed to accompany me.  It came too late.  Fred was already on his way up the Mississippi bound for Dubuque, Iowa, from which place there was a railroad to Galena.  My sensations as we approached what I supposed might be \"a field of battle\" were anything but agreeable.  I had been in all the engagements in Mexico that it was possible for one person to be in; but not in command.  If some one else had been colonel and I had been lieutenant-colonel I do not think I would have felt any trepidation. Before we were prepared to cross the Mississippi River at Quincy my anxiety was relieved; for the men of the besieged regiment came straggling into town.  I am inclined to think both sides got frightened and ran away.  I took my regiment to Palmyra and remained there for a few days, until relieved by the 19th Illinois infantry.  From Palmyra I proceeded to Salt River, the railroad bridge over which had been destroyed by the enemy.  Colonel John M. Palmer at that time commanded the 13th Illinois, which was acting as a guard to workmen who were engaged in rebuilding this bridge.  Palmer was my senior and commanded the two regiments as long as we remained together.  The bridge was finished in about two weeks, and I received orders to move against Colonel Thomas Harris, who was said to be encamped at the little town of Florida, some twenty-five miles south of where we then were.  At the time of which I now write we had no transportation and the country about Salt River was sparsely settled, so that it took some days to collect teams and drivers enough to move the camp and garrison equipage of a regiment nearly a thousand strong, together with a week's supply of provision and some ammunition.  While preparations for the move were going on I felt quite comfortable; but when we got on the road and found every house deserted I was anything but easy.  In the twenty-five miles we had to march we did not see a person, old or young, male or female, except two horsemen who were on a road that crossed ours.  As soon as they saw us they decamped as fast as their horses could carry them.  I kept my men in the ranks and forbade their entering any of the deserted houses or taking anything from them.  We halted at night on the road and proceeded the next morning at an early hour. Harris had been encamped in a creek bottom for the sake of being near water. The hills on either side of the creek extend to a considerable height, possibly more than a hundred feet.  As we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see Harris' camp, and possibly find his men ready formed to meet us, my heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat.  I would have given anything then to have been back in Illinois, but I had not the moral courage to halt and consider what to do; I kept right on. When we reached a point from which the valley below was in full view I halted. The place where Harris had been encamped a few days before was still there and the marks of a recent encampment were plainly visible, but the troops were gone.  My heart resumed its place.  It occurred to me at once that Harris had been as much afraid of me as I had been of him. This was a view of the question I had never taken before; but it was one I never forgot afterwards.  From that event to the close of the war, I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy, though I always felt more or less anxiety.  I never forgot that he had as much reason to fear my forces as I had his.  The lesson was valuable.  Inquiries at the village of Florida divulged the fact that Colonel Harris, learning of my intended movement, while my transportation was being collected took time by the forelock and left Florida before I had started from Salt River.  He had increased the distance between us by forty miles.  The next day I started back to my old camp at Salt River bridge.  The citizens living on the line of our march had returned to their houses after we passed, and finding everything in good order, nothing carried away, they were at their front doors ready to greet us now.  They had evidently been led to believe that the National troops carried death and devastation with them wherever they went.  In a short time after our return to Salt River bridge I was ordered with my regiment to the town of Mexico.  General Pope was then commanding the district embracing all of the State of Missouri between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, with his headquarters in the village of Mexico.  I was assigned to the command of a sub-district embracing the troops in the immediate neighborhood, some three regiments of infantry and a section of artillery.  There was one regiment encamped by the side of mine.  I assumed command of the whole and the first night sent the commander of the other regiment the parole and countersign.  Not wishing to be outdone in courtesy, he immediately sent me the countersign for his regiment for the night.  When he was informed that the countersign sent to him was for use with his regiment as well as mine, it was difficult to make him understand that this was not an unwarranted interference of one colonel over another.  No doubt he attributed it for the time to the presumption of a graduate of West Point over a volunteer pure and simple.  But the question was soon settled and we had no further trouble.  My arrival in Mexico had been preceded by that of two or three regiments in which proper discipline had not been maintained, and the men had been in the"]]]
