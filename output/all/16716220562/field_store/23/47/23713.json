CANNON  SECOND EDITION  Salt Lake City, Utah  1907    PREFACE.  Joseph and Hyrum are now dead; but like the first martyr they yet speak. Their united voice is one of testimony, admonition and warning to the world.  They lived men of God. They died pure and holy, sealing their testimony with their blood.  No men ever suffered greater persecution than they: no men were ever less understood by their generation.  It is in the hope that the Saints may find joy in reading of their beloved Prophet and Patriarch, and that the world may judge more fairly of these benefactors of mankind, that this book is written.  To the Author its preparation has been a loving duty. In the midst of a somewhat busy and laborious life, he has found comfort in the contemplation of this great subject. The closing chapters, detailing the final sufferings upon earth of the Prophet of God and his ever-constant brother, were finished in prison for adherence to the principles which they taught, and for this, the Life is invested with a dearer regard. To send the work away now is like being torn from a beloved companion, when most the solace of his friendly presence is needed.  In some respects this volume may be imperfect; the circumstances which surrounded its preparation were not favorable to the collection and arrangement of materials, but it is believed to be truthful and just.  To many friends the Author is indebted for information here embodied; and he takes this occasion to thank them, hoping to live yet to meet them and express his gratitude in the flesh.  That the sublime example and inspired teachings of Joseph the Prophet of the last Dispensation, may be of eternal benefit to all who read this Life, is the heart-felt wish of  THE AUTHOR.

THE PROPHECY OF JOHN THE REVELATOR.    THE APOSTASY AND THE RESTORATION.  In the reign of Tiberius of Rome, the Lord Jesus was crucified. At the hour of the atonement, His Gospel was to the dominant earthly power only \"a deadly superstition,\" [1] \"a strange and pestilent superstition,\" [2] sought to be crushed at any cost by the ruthless power of the pagan empire. Thus came the persecutions of the early Christians, lasting until after Christianity, with irresistible power, had \"sprung up, even in Rome, the common reservoir for all the streams of wickedness and infamy.\" [1]  In the midst of these early tribulations, the plain and simple Gospel was becoming involved and mystified by the many opposing sects which professed to believe in Jesus; and yet it retained so much of divinity as enabled it to resist persecution and idolatry, and made it, in the fourth century, the established religion of Rome.  This elevation was not achieved without some sacrifice of identity. And in the commingling with error, truth yielded much. [3]  The Roman emperor, Constantine I., was led to"]]]
