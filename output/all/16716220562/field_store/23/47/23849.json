We must stay here until we are discovered.  To follow Gladys would mean her capture.\"  \"We won't have to wait long,\" said McKenzie grimly.  \"Here they come.\"  It was true.  Footsteps came toward them.  Suddenly the room burst into light as someone pressed an electric, light button.  General Rentzel strode into the room.  His eyes fell upon Hal and McKenzie immediately.  He said nothing, but gazed about.  Then he saw the shattered safe.  He dashed forward with a cry and examined the interior, carefully.  Then his face turned white as he faced Hal.  \"The list,\" he said in a hoarse voice, \"where is it?\"  Hal smiled.  \"Where you will never get it, I hope,\" he replied quietly.  General Rentzel strode forward with a shout.  \"They are spies!  Seize them, men!\" he cried.  Hal's right arm shot out and the chief of the German secret service sprawled on the floor.  \"To the stairs!\" Hal cried to McKenzie.  The Canadian needed no urging.  Two German soldiers fell to the floor under his quick blows and then McKenzie joined Hal on the steps which fled upward from the rear of the room.  Hall produced a revolver. McKenzie did likewise.  \"The first man who moves dies!\" cried Hal, as he moved his revolver from side to side.  The men below, of whom there were perhaps a dozen, stood still. Apparently each was afraid to make the first move.  General Rentzel sat up and wiped his face with a handkerchief.  \"Shoot them!\" he cried.  From the rear of the crowd there was a flash of fire and a report.  A bullet sped over Hal's head. McKenzie's revolver flashed and a German fell to rise no more.  At this moment McKenzie took command.  \"Up the steps!\" he cried.  Hal realized that to hesitate meant instant death.  He was, perhaps, two steps above McKenzie, and he covered the rest in two leaps.  There he stopped and covered the room.  He was in position to protect McKenzie's retreat.  McKenzie also leaped to the top step, and there, for a moment, they were out of the line of fire.  To reach them it was necessary for the Germans to stand directly in front of the steps, and there was no man below who felt called upon to face this certain death, in spite of the hoarse commands of General Rentzel.  But in a situation like this could not last long.  Other officers and soldiers, aroused by the explosion appeared on the scene.  Hal realized that their predicament was desperate.  With a cry to McKenzie, Hal darted back along the hall, turned into the first room he saw, flung open the window and leaped to the ground.  McKenzie was close behind him.  Hal led the way along the street at a rapid walk, with McKenzie at his heels.  The lad turned down several side streets, doubling occasionally on his tracks in an effort to throw off possible pursuers.  As they drew farther away from the house where they had been discovered they encountered fewer and fewer people.  Apparently the sound of the explosion had not reached here.  They were safe for the moment and Hal breathed easier.  \"Hope Chester has a good start,\" he said to McKenzie in a low voice.  \"He should have by this time,\" was the reply.  \"They figure, of course, that we have the list.\"  Hal would have replied, but as they passed a house at that moment a man stepped from the door.  Hal uttered an exclamation of pure amazement.  The newcomer was dressed in costume that he had worn since the war began.  He looked much as upon the night that Hal first saw him.  He paid no attention to Hal and McKenzie at first, but Hal  brought him about with a word.  \"Stubbs!\"  It was indeed the little war correspondent of whose presence in Germany Herr Block had told the three friends before they left Holland.  Stubbs wheeled sharply.  He saw Hal and turned pale.  \"Hello--hello, Hal,\" he gasped.  \"Wh--what are you doing here?\"  \"Is that your house?\" demanded Hal, indicating the one from which Stubbs had just emerged.  \"Yes; why?\"  \"Then we'll go in with you,\" said Hal quietly.  \"But I don't want to go in,\" declared Stubbs.  \"But we do,\" said Hal.  \"Meet my friend, McKenzie, Stubbs.\"  \"I don't want to meet him,\" declared Stubbs.  \"I tell you I'm in danger here.\"  \"So are we,\" said Hal.  \"That's the reason we're going to take advantage of your hospitality.  Come on in, Stubbs.  We've got to get out of this country.\"  \"I'll never get out alive now that you've showed up,\" Stubbs mumbled.  But he led the way inside.      CHAPTER IX  STUBBS IS CRESTFALLEN  Inside, Stubbs struck a match.  \"I say!  Hold up, there!\" Hal exclaimed, and grasped the hand that held the match and extinguished the flame.  \"We don't want any light in here,\" he added.  In vain Stubbs tried to pierce the darkness with his eyes to make out the lad's features.  \"Humph!\" muttered the little man.  \"What have you been up to now?\"  \"Stubbs,\" said Hal, \"the whole of Germany will be scouring the city for us before long.  We've got to get away from here.\"  \"Well,\" said Stubbs, \"the whole of Germany is already looking for me, but they haven't found me yet.\"  \"What are they hunting you for?\" demanded Hal.  \"Surely, you haven't harmed anyone.\"  \"Maybe not; but they've discovered who I am.\"  \"That you're an American war correspondent, eh?\"  \"Why, no,\" said Stubbs quietly, \"they've discovered that I'm here at command of the American state department searching for a certain list of names.\"  It was Hal's turn to be surprised and he started back.  \"What's that?\" he cried, believing that he could not have heard aright.  Stubbs repeated his statement.  \"But I thought--\" began Hal.  \"And what business have you to think!\" demanded Stubbs with sudden anger.  \"Haven't I the same, right as you to do something for my country?\"  \"Of course, Mr. Stubbs, and I think all more of you for it, but at the same time I never dreamed--\"  \"Of course you didn't.  Neither did anyone else, which is the reason my services were accepted.  That is, no one knew it outside of Germany, but they seem to have spotted me here soon enough.\"  \"I see,\" said Hal.  \"Then you must have made an effort to get the list of German agents in the United States.\"  Stubbs gave an exclamation of amazement.  \"Who said anything about spies?\" he asked.  \"Well, you didn't, to be sure,\" said Hal, \"But as I happened to have the list in my hands a few moments ago, I didn't need to be told.\"  \"You had it?\" cried Stubbs, unconsciously raising his voice.  \"Yes.\"  \"'Where is it now?\" demanded Stubbs eagerly.  \"Safe, I hope,\" replied Hal quietly, \"but don't talk so loud, Stubbs. I sent the list to Chester by a trusted aide, and I have no doubt he is on his way out of the country with it now.\"  \"How'd you get it?\" inquired Stubbs.  Hal explained.  \"By George!\" said Stubbs.  \"You fellows have all the luck.  I tried and failed.\"  \"Maybe you didn't know where it was,\" said Hal.  \"Didn't, eh?  Say, let me ask you something.  Didn't you think it was rather strange when you approached General Rentzel's place that there was no one around, eh?\"  \"Well, such a thought had occurred to me,\" Hal admitted, \"but I supposed no one was on guard through overconfidence.\"  \"Do you want me to tell you where the guards were?\"  \"Why, yes, if you know.\"  \"Well, I know all right.  They were chasing me around the highways and byways, if you want to know,\" Stubbs exploded.  \"They discovered me trying to get into the house and I ran for my life.  Well, this beats the Dutch!  I cleared the road for you and you grabbed the list!\"  Stubbs became silent.  \"At all events,\" said Hal, \"we got the list--and that is what counts, after all.\"  \"True,\" said Stubbs, and extended a hand in the darkness, which Hal grasped warmly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"we're all tarred with the same brush, and it will give these Huns great delight to stand us all up before a wall or with ropes around our necks in a bunch.  The sooner we get back to our lines the better for all our families.\"  \"But the question is, how?\" said Hal quietly.  \"I've got a big automobile waiting for me about a mile from here,\" said Stubbs.  \"If we can get into it we can go a long ways without interruption.\"  \"They'll wire ahead,\" said Hal  \"So they will,\" Stubbs agreed, \"but I've also got a pocket full of the prettiest passports and other credentials you ever saw.  I didn't chop down my bridges behind me, as you seem to have done.  Once in my car, as I say, and we'll move away from here.\"  \"Then we may as well be moving,\" said McKenzie, who had not spoken until that moment.  \"Right,\" Hal agreed.  \"But we must be careful.  No telling how many Germans are nearby, scouring the streets for us.  Lead the way, Stubbs.\"  \"That's right,\" said Stubbs, \"pick me for the easy work.\"  \"I'll lead the way if the little man is afraid,\" growled McKenzie.  Stubbs whirled on him in the darkness.  \"Look here!\" he exclaimed, \"I allow no man to talk to me like that. Understand?\"  McKenzie was somewhat taken aback, but he growled again:  \"Then lead on and don't talk so much.\"  Stubbs would have made another angry retort, but Hal nudged him to move.  Muttering to himself, Stubbs led the way to the street again.  There was no one in sight as they emerged from the darkened house, and they moved off down the street with rapid strides.  Occasionally they saw passing civilians, with now and then an officer or trooper or so, but Berlin seemed to be sleeping securely in the knowledge that the enemy was far from its door.  Hal gazed at his watch by the glare of a street light.  It was almost 4 o'clock.  \"Two hours to daylight,\" he muttered.  \"We shall have to hurry.\"  Fifteen minutes later Stubbs slowed down.  \"My automobile is in a small garage around the next corner,\" he said, and added significantly, \"if nothing has happened to it.\"  \"Let's get it then,\" said Hal.  \"We don't want to stand here.\"  Stubbs moved on again and Hal and McKenzie followed him closely.  There was no sign of a living person near the little garage.  Stubbs approached and attempted to throw back the closed door.  It would not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6083"],["title","The Boy Allies with Haig in Flanders; Or, the Fighting Canadians of Vimy Ridge (#7)"],["body","ge.  \"Let me try, Stubbs,\" said Hal, pushing forward.  He took from his pocket a short but well tempered piece of steel.  He found that the door was held by a padlock.  He inserted the piece of steel in the top, and, putting forth all his strength, broke the lock.  There was a sharp report as the lock fell to pieces.  \"Quick, Stubbs!\" Hal cried.  \"That noise will have aroused every sleepy policeman within a mile.\"  McKenzie lent a hand and the door was thrown back.  Stubbs gave a gasp of relief.  The automobile was there.  \"You do the driving, Hal,\" cried Stubbs.  \"Pile in here, man,\" this to McKenzie.  \"She's all ready to start.  Come on.\"  The others wasted no time in words.  McKenzie scrambled in the back seat alongside Stubbs, while Hal sprang to the wheel.  A moment later the automobile moved slowly from the garage.  As the big machine came clear into the street, a bright light suddenly flashed around the next comer and headed toward them.  Hal knew in a moment what it was.  It was a motorcycle, bearing a policeman.  There was but one course to pursue, and Hal acted without hesitation.  He threw the machine into high and it dashed directly toward the motorcycle.  The man saved his life by swerving swiftly to one side.  His machine bumped the curb and threw the rider off.  When he picked himself up the automobile bearing the three friends was turning a corner, apparently on one wheel for Hal had scarcely diminished the speed.  The German drew his revolver and fired a shot ill the air.  He was sounding the alarm and summoning assistance at the same time.  Quickly he righted his motorcycle, mounted, and made off in pursuit of the high-powered automobile.  At the sound of the German's shot, Hal increased the speed of the automobile.  \"McKenzie!\" he cried.  McKenzie leaned forward so as to catch the words the lad shouted back to him.  \"Get your guns ready!\" cried Hal.  \"Don't let anyone come at us from the rear.\"  McKenzie understood.  He repeated Hal's words to Stubbs, shouting to make himself heard.  \"Can't anyone catch us from behind,\" Stubbs shouted back.  \"This car will outrun anything in Germany.\"  McKenzie made no reply, but looked to his guns.  He knew that it was not pursuing automobiles that Hal was afraid of; but high-powered motorcycles in use in Germany would probably be able to overtake the car no matter what its speed.  So far, however, the road behind was clear.      CHAPTER X  TOWARD THE FRONTIER  Hal set his course by instinct and the glow of the disappearing moon, and a few moments after their swift departure, it seemed, they were beyond the city itself, headed straight for the Dutch frontier.  There was no pursuit, and Hal rightly judged the reason to be because he had thrown pursuers off the track by several sharp turns before leaving the city proper.  After an hour's riding, Hal made out specks ahead that he took to be automobiles.  He increased the speed of the car slightly to make sure of this fact.  The car driven by Hal was gaining, but so slightly as to be almost imperceptible.  \"Those fellows are hitting up a pretty swift gait,\" the lad muttered. \"I wonder why.\"  The sound of a shot was suddenly swept back to Hal's ear.  \"Hello!\" he muttered.  \"Trouble ahead.\"  He slowed down, for he had no mind to mix up with the Germans so long as it could be avoided.  Suddenly the first automobile ahead came to a stop.  The second did likewise.  Hal shut off his searchlight and approached slowly in the darkness.  It became plain, as he drew closer, that the first automobile had been stopped by a pistol shot, which probably had punctured a rear tire.  There came more pistol shots and then silence.  Hal brought his own machine to a dead stop.  A few moments later one of the automobiles ahead, as Hal could see by the position of its searchlight, began to turn in the road.  Instantly Hal flashed his own light on and sent the car forward.  This he did because he realized it would look suspicious should the flare of the other light show Hal's car standing still in the road.  The other car had now come about and approached Hal's machine.  McKenzie and Stubbs both had been watching the proceedings ahead with strained eyes.  Now they were ready for Hal's words:  \"Guns ready back there.  We'll pass if they let us alone.\"  The cars came closer together.  Suddenly Hal was struck with a thought that sent a chill down his spine.  Suppose Chester was in that car! Maybe the pursuit he had witnessed was the pursuit of Chester.  The cars were almost together now.  Instead of turning off to the right to allow the other to pass, as it seemed to have every intention of doing, Hal only swerved slightly.  Then, before the other car could pass, he brought his own machine to a stop and sprang to the ground, revolver in hand.  McKenzie was close behind him.  Only Stubbs remained in the automobile, and he, too, held a revolver ready for instant action.  A voice from the strange car hailed Hal.  \"Why do you stop us like this?\" it demanded.  \"Want to see who you are,\" was the lad's reply.  \"A spy has escaped from Berlin, and I have orders to search all vehicles.\"  \"You are mistaken,\" said the voice.  \"The spy has not escaped.  We have him here.\"  \"Good!\" exclaimed Hal.  \"Nevertheless, I must satisfy myself that you are speaking the truth and are what you represent yourselves to be.\"  \"Of course,\" returned the voice.  \"Approach.\"  Hal went forward slowly, gun in hand, as did McKenzie.  Hal now made out that there were four occupants of the car, besides the man at the wheel and a figure stretched out in the tonneau.  With his cap down over his eyes, he peered in.  The men were in civilian garb and Hal knew, therefore, that they must be members of the secret service and not of the military.  He knew, too, that they would consequently be that much harder to handle.  Nevertheless, he determined upon a bold stroke.  \"Hands up, all of you!\" he cried in a stern voice.  His revolver covered the occupants in the front seat. McKenzie covered the rear.  \"Here, what's the meaning of this?\" exclaimed a man who seemed to be the leader.  \"You fool!  Haven't you been convinced yet that we are what we say.\"  \"Perfectly,\" returned Hal quietly.  \"That's why I must insist that you raise your hands.  Instantly!\"  His voice hardened and his finger tightened on the trigger.  \"Shoot without hesitancy,\" he warned McKenzie.  McKenzie's lips were set in a determined line.  It was plain that he would need no urging.  \"Well,\" said one of the Germans, \"it's my belief you are also spies.\"  \"Hands up!\" repeated Hal.  \"If you must have it you must!\" exclaimed the first German.  His hand flashed up and in it was a revolver.  McKenzie's revolver flashed.  The German dropped back.  The man at the wheel released his hold on the steering apparatus and also reached for a gun.  Hal dropped him without changing his position.  One of the Germans, before either Hal or McKenzie could stop him, hurled himself over the far side of the car.  The other two raised their hands.  \"That other fellow is probably bent on mischief,\" said Hal to himself, \"but we'll have to take a chance.  Cover 'em\" he ordered McKenzie, \"while I get their guns!\"  Hal advanced to the side of the car and deprived the two Germans of their revolvers. Then he climbed in and motioned the Germans to get out.  After that he bent over the still form in the bottom of the car. It was Chester.  \"Keep those fellows covered, McKenzie,\" he warned.  \"Don't let them move.  One of them may have the list.\"  The Germans made no move under the muzzle of McKenzie's gun, held in a steady hand.  Hal lifted Chester's head to his knee.  As he did so there was a sharp report from nearby, quickly followed by a second, and Hal felt a slight pain in his left arm.  He dropped Chester's head and leaped to the ground.  \"That's the man who escaped,\" he said.  \"I'll have to get him, McKenzie. You watch, these fellows closely.\"  \"It's all right, Hal,\" came a voice from the lads own car.  \"I got him!\"  It was the voice of Stubbs, and the little man now came forward.  \"I stayed behind to cover you fellows,\" he explained.  \"The man who jumped out of the car made a detour and came up to my car.  From its protection he took a shot at you.  He didn't see me in the darkness, though, and I beat him to it.  He was so close I couldn't miss.\"  \"Thanks, Stubbs,\" said Hal quietly.  \"Now you look in the car and see if you can't find some rope or blankets or something to tie these fellows with.\"  Stubbs returned shortly with several thin blankets, which Hal quickly fashioned into an improvised rope.  The two prisoners were bound.  \"Now search 'em for the list,\" said Hal.  The war correspondent did so.  There was no list to be found.  \"Search the one you just disposed of, Stubb,\"' Hal ordered.  The little man obeyed, and a moment later gave an exclamation of triumph.  \"Here it is,\" he cried.  \"Good!\" said Hal.  \"Now we'll lay these fellows where they can't move to give an alarm.\"  This, too, was but the work of a moment.  \"Lend a hand, McKenzie,\" said Hal. \"We'll move Chester into our own car and then move on.  It is dangerous to remain here.\"  Chester was gently transferred from one car to the other and laid in the bottom.  \"You fellows see if you can revive him as we go along,\" said Hal.  \"We have no time to waste.\"  He sprang again to the wheel, and the car moved on.  Daylight overtook the four friends as they sped along the country road.  Occasionally other automobiles flashed by, but they were not molested.  Under the administering hands of Stubbs and McKenzie, signs of life soon became apparent in Chester's body.  He moaned feebly once or twice, and then opened his eyes.  For a moment he did not realize where he was, but with remembrance of the recent attack, he suddenly sat up and aimed a blow at Stubbs, in whose lap the lad's head had rested.  \"I say!  What's the meaning of this?\" cried Stubbs.  \"What are you trying to hit me for?\"  \"Is"]]]
