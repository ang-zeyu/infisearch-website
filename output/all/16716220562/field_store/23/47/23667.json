Once in Mona's room, however, Billie discovered that metallic furniture was the rule; that the windows were without screens, [Footnote: The Capellans seem to have utterly stamped out all forms of insect life except those directly beneficial to man.] and that the bed was set down very close to the floor. Otherwise, the room was much like any on the earth.  Mona's clothes interested Billie immensely. Without exception the garments were skirtless, and a large proportion of the suits were in one piece. Headgear was limited to caps, of which Mona owned an immense variety; while she wore nothing but high lace-up boots or pumps. Billie was sure that these were all of leather.  With the aid of no less than four maids, all of whom were very pretty girls, Mona changed to a garment of some lustrous brown material, like silk velvet but with a much longer nap, together with stockings of the golf pattern, and black pumps. Next she proceeded to inspect herself carefully in a mirror.  Billie saw that Smith's estimate of \"not over thirty\" was accurate enough. The girl was still young as to face, although her body was remarkably robust. And Billie found that her delicacy of feature did not suffer from the close-up.  Instead, her refinement was made only the more striking. Probably it was the high arching of her eyebrows that had made her face patrician; that, together with the sensitiveness of her nostrils. For there was nothing at all cold about her eyes; they were a very dark brown, large and full. And her lips were anything but haughty; they were a deep red and piquantly upturned at the corners. The whole carriage of her head, however, marked her as an aristocrat, but a lovable one.  As she turned from the glass the sound of a laugh came from the front of the house. Billie instantly recognized Fort's voice. Mona gave her hair a final touch and went straight to the terrace.  \"How do you do?\" said the surgeon coolly, as she took Fort's eagerly outstretched hand. And again Billie was more interested in the man's gray-leather flying suit, so well becoming his fine muscular development, than in the conventional reply he made. Next moment Mona's mother was saying:  \"I have been trying to thank Mr. Fort for what he did yesterday. It was a remarkably brave thing!\"  \"Indeed it was,\" declared Mona, with feeling. \"And yet, try as I might last night, I was unable to make him see that it was anything out of the ordinary, mother.\"  \"Why, of course,\" protested the athlete carelessly. \"There was nothing brave about it. One is not brave unless one is afraid; and I wasn't afraid. I can take no credit for the thing.\"  \"Do you mean,\" questioned Mona, \"that you are never afraid?\"  \"Not when I am in the air.\"  There was silence for a minute, and again Billie used Mona's eyes to good advantage. Fort was certainly a good-looking chap, although slightly untidy in small items of his costume. He was the kind which looks best when somewhat disheveled, anyhow. As to face--a large, handsomely curved mouth, a slightly Roman nose, eyes as big as Mona's and as blue as hers were brown. Decidedly, the man was worth looking at, again and again. Most daredevils are sharp-featured; Fort was kindly. There was something positively reassuring about his kind of audacity.  Presently the mother mentioned Ernol, the radical; seemingly these people had been privately informed of what Powart was keeping from the workers. Fort commented:  \"I was really frightened when I heard of it. Why, if that fellow's philosophy is listened to, we all may have to work for a living!\" His laughter rang above the rest; then he thought of Mona. \"Oh, I say, I quite forgot, I assure you.\"  \"Don't mention it,\" returned the surgeon humorously. \"I don't mind telling you that this service of mine is largely camouflage. I belong to the Delusion Brigade.\"  Fort was greatly surprised. \"You, a volunteer?\"  \"Quite so. There must always be some one of our class to whom people can look, whenever they suspect that we are not democratic. Besides, I have always fancied surgery.\" She told briefly of her work.  \"Why, you are a famous person!\" declared the athlete.  \"You make me ashamed; I do nothing at all but amuse myself.\"  \"Which is quite as well, Mr. Fort,\" the mother assured him. \"I tried my best to keep Mona out of this; a social conquest is what I had planned for her. But she had set her mind on surgery; so--\" And she left the rest to Fort's imagination.  A moment later Billie heard a flying-machine approaching. Shortly it came near enough for her to see that it was greatly like a yacht, painted white all over, and possessing exceptionally tall masts. The canvas was already unfurled and the vessel descending under the control of some unusually powerful wings.  \"Mr. Powart's official boat,\" Mona explained to Fort.  The craft landed softly on the edge of the lawn, some distance away. The three on the terrace did not stir from their places as Powart, accompanied by eight men in uniform, stepped swiftly down a short ladder and strode rapidly to the house. The eight guards, each of whom carried a brown leather box, like a motion-picture camera, took up unobtrusive positions near at hand. These cases, however, were not used for taking photographs; Billie thought them more like some kind of condensed rapid-fire guns.  Before Powart got within ear-shot, Mona leaned toward Fort. \"This is my fiance,\" she said with an evident effort; and when she straightened up her hands were trembling.  Fort took it astonishingly well. He concealed any hint of his feelings as the chairman was introduced. Powart gave him a single penetrating glance, then advanced in his sure, self-confident way, and took both the girl's hands in his own. She remained in her seat.  \"I am very glad to see you looking so well. Do you feel fully recovered, Mona?\"  \"Yes, thank you,\" coolly. \"Or perhaps I should say, thanks to Mr. Fort, here.\"  Powart turned his keen gray eyes upon the athlete. \"If there is any way I can show you how much I appreciate this--\"  Fort waved his hand jauntily. \"Wait till I do something that costs me a real effort!\"  Something in his voice caught the chairman's ear. He scrutinized the athlete more closely; and Billie found herself comparing the two. They were both big fellows; otherwise there was no resemblance. The one was as dark as the other was blond; moreover, he was somewhat heavier than Fort, and of the sort which must be dressed immaculately at all times. His good looks were due to the clean-cut lines of his face; for his eyes were stern and his mouth very strong.  If the one was impulsive, the other was sure. Fort loved to take a chance; the other, would not act until he was absolutely certain. Billie decided that he was the steadier, the more reliable of the two; also, the least likable, for that very reason. Infallibility is a fearsome thing.  The mother arose with some remark about going into the gardens, and Fort offered his arm. Powart took their going purely as a matter of course, and continued to stand--he seldom sat down--directly in front of Mona.  \"I hope,\" said he in his direct fashion, \"that you can see your way clear to consider wearing this,\" and he produced a small, blue velvet case from an inner pocket. And next moment Billie was peeking over Mona's shoulder, so to speak, to see a ring made of some milk-white metal, set with a single oval stone of a blood-red hue. The surgeon gave a tiny gasp at the sight of it.  \"Bribery and corruption!\" she cried, and started to slip the ring on to the middle finger of her left hand. Before it was done, however, she paused.  \"I almost forgot.\" She gave Powart a sidelong glance. \"Last night I thought it over, and--Well, you know how women are about changing their minds.\"  \"Surely you haven't completely altered your opinion of me?\" incredulously, rather than anxiously.  \"No; I just want more time to think it over, that's all. It is not that I think less of you than before, but somehow, since having such a close call--I haven't quite as much confidence in my ability to meet your expectations.\" This as though she had worded it beforehand.  Powart showed little concern. \"Of course I am sorry; but perhaps it is just as well. Beyond a doubt you will soon come to see it as clearly as you did the other day.\" He paused as the girl slowly extended the ring to him. \"Why not wear it anyhow, Mona?\"  \"I'd rather not--not until I am sure. It's a dreadful temptation, though!\"  And Powart had no choice other than to reflect her smile with one of his own, while he quietly slipped the little case back into his pocket.  Almost with the same motion he took out a watch. \"You must excuse me. Business of state, as usual.\"  \"Certainly,\" as she rose. She gave a quick glance around, then shook her head playfully as Powart took a single eager step toward her. \"Next time,\" she said; and he bit his lip, gripped her hand tightly, and strode away. In a minute he and his guards were back in the yacht, and in three minutes out of sight.  By that time Fort and Mona's mother had returned. There was a quick exchange of glances between the two women, and then the mother excused herself and went in the house. Fort suddenly became awkwardly self-conscious.  \"Well, I must be going.\" He paused; a gleam of mischief flashed into his eyes--a kind of final come-back. \"Next time I rescue you, young lady, I shall let you get hurt ever so much worse, so that I can have an excuse to call more than I have so far!\"  His face sobered swiftly. \"I nearly forgot. May I congratulate you upon your--engagement? Mr. Powart is a very fine man.\"  \"Thank you; so he is. Really, I have lately come to wonder if I am good enough for him.\" Then, significantly: \"Th"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5965"],["title","The Devolutionist and the Emancipatrix (#8)"],["body","date has been postponed indefinitely. It is not impossible that I may give him up.\"  Fort stared incredulously for a second, then saw that she meant it. The blood rushed to his face, leaving him white and shaky with excitement. He made a sudden move toward the girl, checking himself just as suddenly.  \"Well!\" His usually easy speech nearly failed him. But he laughed as boldly as ever. \"I am convinced that you are far from being a well woman, Miss Mona! I shall have to call--often!\"  And with a short but exceedingly intense gaze of infinite meaning, he wheeled, clapped his cap to his head, dashed to his machine and was gone.       IX  THE STAGNANT WORLD      Smith entered the mind of his Capellan agent at a moment when he was clearly off duty. In fact, the engineer of the Cobulus was at the time enjoying an uncommonly good photoplay.  Smith had arrived too late to see the beginning of the picture; but he found it to be a more or less conventional society drama. And for a while he was mainly interested in the remarkably clear photography, the natural coloring and stereoscopic effect that the doctor had already noted through young Ernol. Smith nearly overlooked the really fine music, all coming from a talking machine of some kind.  And then the picture came to an end, and a farce-comedy began. It was an extraordinarily ingenious thing, with little or no plot; afterward Smith could not describe it with any accuracy. However, Mrs. Kinney, down-stairs, plainly heard him laughing as though his sides would give way.  The picture over, Smith's man got up and left the place; and once outside he glanced at his watch and took up a position on the curb, much as Smith had often done when a younger man. The Capellan seemed to know a good many of the people who came out of the playhouse; and meanwhile Smith took note of something of extreme importance.  The playhouse did not have any advertising whatever in sight, except for a single bulletin-board, like the bill of fare of a cafeteria. Moreover--and this is the significant thing--there was no box-office, neither was any one at the door to take tickets.  The place was wide open to the world. It was located on a very busy street in what appeared to be a good-sized city; but, to all appearances, any one might enter who chose to.  \"Free amusements,\" thought Smith, \"to keep the boobs happy.\"  Shortly his agent stepped down the street, which seemed to be greatly like one in any city on the earth, except that there was remarkably little noise. Perhaps it was due to the total lack of street-cars and surface machinery in general. Certainly the space between the sidewalks was used for little else than the parking of flying-machines. The buildings housed a variety of stores, all built on a large scale. There were no small shops at all.  Smith's agent quickly reached his own flier, a small two-seater ornithopter finished in dull gray--Smith's favorite color, incidentally--and in a minute or two he was well under way. Smith had a chance to watch, at close range, the distorted S-motion of the machine's wings. But the flight lasted only a few minutes, and presently the craft was again at rest.  This time it was parked under a tremendously long shed, which Smith afterward saw was really a balcony, one of a tier of ten. Opposite the spot was a large building, like a depot; and over its roof Smith saw the huge bulk of an airship.  It was, of course, the Cobulus; and it was when Smith's agent passed through a checking-in room that his name was heard for the first time. \"All right, Reblong,\" was the way it came, from the official who punched his time-card. And Reblong, with Smith making eager use of his eyes, went directly through a hatch in the side of the great ship, and thence down a corridor to his engine-room.  Smith got little opportunity to study the machinery. Reblong gave the place a single sweeping glance, then strode to a short, black-bearded chap who stood near the instrument board.  \"Everything as usual, my friend?\" He had a pleasant voice, as Smith learned for the first time.  \"Yes--as usual!\" The man's voice was bitter. \"That's just what's wrong! There's never any improvement; it's always--as usual! Say, Reblong; no offense, but I think we are fools to put up with what we are given!\"  Smith's man complacently seated himself in front of the instruments. \"Personally, I think we are mighty lucky, instead of foolish.\"  \"Lucky!\" The other man snorted. \"I wish Ernol could hear you say that! He'd have a fit!\"  Reblong was not at all disturbed. \"By the way, what's become of the chap? I haven't seen him around for weeks?\"  \"Don't know, exactly,\" with some uneasiness. \"He went back to Calastia, and that's the last I heard of him.\"  \"Calastia? I saw an item in the paper last night, to the effect that Calastia was under quarantine. All news cut off.\"  The man instantly smelled a mouse. \"Quarantine! Why should that cause the news to be cut off? There's something more than quarantine the matter, Reblong!\" He began to pace the room excitedly. \"I say it again, we're fools to believe everything the commission tells us. I think they've been hoodwinking us about long enough!\"  Reblong suppressed a yawn. \"I don't care if they do, old man. I'm willing to leave it up to them to run the government.\"  \"And that's exactly what's the matter!\" cried the other. \"You and every other chap except those Ernol has taught, thinks that the commission is God-given and can do no wrong!\"  \"Yes?\" politely. \"Maybe so; only, you can't blame us for thinking pretty highly of a government that has done this.\" Reblong checked the items off on his fingers, meanwhile eying his companion steadily: \"It has done away with the liquor traffic; it has fully protected women in industry; it has put an end to child labor; it has abolished poverty; it has abolished war; and\"--with considerable emphasis for so quiet a man--\"it has provided you and me and everybody else with a mighty fine education, free of charge!\"  Reblong's manner, by its very emphasis, had the effect of making the other man suddenly quite cool. \"Correct; I admit them all. And at the same time I want to show you that the commission has accomplished all this, not primarily for our benefit, but in the interests of the owners.  \"They gave us prohibition because drinking was bad for business; no other reason, Reblong! And that's why the women are protected, too; a protected, contented woman brings in better dividends to the owners than one who is worked to death.  \"Neither did it pay to allow child labor; it resulted in misery and reduced production, in the long run, and that meant reduced dividends. Poverty didn't pay, either; poor people do not make efficient workmen. War was abolished, Reblong, not for any humanitarian motives, but because peace brought in fatter profits and less waste.  \"And as for our compulsory education\"--he snapped his fingers contemptuously--\"just what does it amount to? Simply this: it didn't pay the owners to allow illiteracy! An educated workman is a better dividend-producer than an ignorant one. That's all there is to it, Reblong! Don't fool yourself into thinking that the commission has done all this for your benefit! Not much!\"  \"Maybe you're right,\" conceded Reblong. \"As for myself, I don't care a rap what the commission's reasons were. I'm satisfied!\"  The other man looked disgusted. \"Satisfied! Just because you're guaranteed your dollar an hour, and your pension at sixty! Satisfied, when half the company's profits go to the owners, not one of whom ever did a bit of work in his life! A bunch of people who do nothing but blow in the money we earn, and spend more in a day than we do in a month!\"  \"They're welcome,\" commented Reblong with much indifference. \"If I got all that you have told me is coming to me, I'd probably ruin myself with high living anyhow.\"  \"You don't mean to say that you've swallowed that old piffle!\" said the black-bearded chap incredulously.  \"I don't see any piffle about it. As I look at the matter, the owners are doing us a genuine favor. Not only do they take the burden of our surplus earnings off our shoulders, but they run our government for us without charge.\"  \"Well, I'll be utterly damned!\" The other fellow looked as though the words were not half strong enough. \"I never thought a full-grown man could continue to believe the stuff we were taught when we were kids! Don't you ever think for yourself, Reblong? Why, look here!\"  He came closer and spoke with painstaking clearness, as though he were addressing a child.  \"The commission, instead of assuring us that increased wages would be our ruin, could just as well be educating us to spend wisely! Just as well, Reblong! And as for child labor--man, children ought to be kept out of industry until they're twenty, instead of sixteen! Every last one of us ought to be given a college education, instead of merely the children of the rich! And all this could be done, too. There's no earthly reason why we should permit that bunch of parasites in Hafen to graft off us any longer! Put 'em to work, like you and me, and make life easier for us all!\"  \"But,\" objected Reblong, a little upset, \"there's only a few of the owners. They couldn't help much.\"  \"But their servants could. Do you know that there's ten servants, on an average, to every family of the rich? Servants who do nothing but make life still easier for people who already hog it all!\"  \"Well, suppose they did all go to work; who would run our government for us, my friend?\"  \"Who! Why--if we can do the work, I guess we can certainly do the governing, Reblong.\"  Reblong turned away, plainly bewildered. \"It doesn't look right to me, old man. I'd rather let things stand as they are, so far as I'm concerned.\"  Somewhere a warning instrument was thrumming loudly. The man with the democratic ideas automatically turned to his locker, and proceeded to change his outer clothing. Reblong meanwhile took off his suit and"]]]
