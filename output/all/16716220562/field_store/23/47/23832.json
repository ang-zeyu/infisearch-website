He had at this moment one thought in his mind.  \"Maybe,\" he told himself over and over through the night, \"maybe I shall have time to go home and see father!\"      CHAPTER XI  NEW YORK  News of the capture of the German raider Vaterland had preceded the vessel into New York, having been flashed by wireless while the ship was still several days out.  Therefore there was a large crowd on hand to see the Vaterland anchor in the North River.  Lord Hastings surrendered the vessel to American naval authorities and then the officers, crew, erstwhile prisoners and German captives all went ashore.  Captain Koenig and his crew were taken in charge by the authorities and a few days later were sent to one of the big American internment camps in the south, where they would remain until the end of the war.  There was considerable cheering as Lord Hastings and his officers stepped ashore.  The British commander dodged as much of this as possible and with Jack and Frank jumped into a taxicab and were driven to the Biltmore, where they registered and were assigned to a suite of rooms.  There, Lord Hastings decided, they would remain pending instructions.  The successful capture of the Vaterland was flashed across the Atlantic to the British admiralty and a cable message of congratulations was received a short time later, together with orders for Lord Hastings to remain in New York until other orders reached him.  It was at the dinner table that evening that Frank asked Lord Hastings' permission to run home for a day or two.  Lord Hastings assented readily, for he knew that Frank naturally was anxious to see his father.  \"Why don't you take Jack with you?\" he asked.  \"I shall be glad to,\" replied Frank.  \"Do you want to go, Jack?\"  \"Sure,\" said the young Englishman.  \"I shall be glad.\"  \"How about you, Lord Hastings?\" questioned Frank.  \"I should like to have you go also.\"  \"I appreciate your invitation,\" said Lord Hastings, with a smile, \"but I thought I would run over to Washington and see the British ambassador.  But you see if you can't bring your father back to New York with you, Frank.  I should be more than pleased to see him.\"  \"I'll see what I can do, sir,\" replied the lad.  Thus it was arranged.  Jack and Frank took a train for Boston early the following morning and Lord Hastings caught a train for Washington.  \"You should have sent your father a telegram, Frank,\" said Jack, as they left the train in Boston.  \"I want to take him by surprise.\"  \"Maybe he won't be home.\"  \"By George!  I hadn't thought of that.  I guess he will be, though. He's usually home in the afternoon.\"  The boys took the elevated from the South station to the North station, where they found they could catch a train to Woburn, the town where Frank's father lived, in ten minutes.  It was only a little more than ten miles from Boston to Woburn and the trip was made quickly.  As they alighted from the train, Frank let his eyes rove over the familiar landmarks, which he had not seen for three years.  There was little change to be noticed.  Frank led the way toward his home.  He paused before an old-fashioned New England house and Jack, glancing up, saw this sign on the door:  \"Dr. R. G. Chadwick.\"  Frank mounted the steps rapidly and rang the bell.  An elderly woman came to the door.  Frank had never seen her before.  \"Is the doctor in?\" he asked.  \"Yes, but he is busy right now.  Step in and have a seat.\"  Frank led the way into the doctor's waiting room, where he and Jack sat down.  Frank's mother was dead.  She had passed away when the lad was not more than five years, and in the days that followed Dr. Chadwick had been father and mother both to him.  From the little room beyond Frank caught the sound of his father's voice.  The lad could hardly, restrain his impatience.  A few moments later, however, a door slammed, signifying that the physician's patient had left by, another door.  A moment more and the door into the waiting room was flung open and Dr. Chadwick stepped into the room.  He looked at the two figures who now rose to greet him, and then he jumped forward with a cry.  \"Frank!\"  A moment and the lad was in his father's arms.  Dr. Chadwick held the lad off at arm's length and looked at him.  \"You've grown,\" he said.  \"Sit down and tell me about yourself.  I was afraid you had been killed.  I haven't had a letter from you for almost a year.\"  \"Before I recount my adventures, father,\" said Frank, \"I want you to meet my chum, Jack Templeton, of whom I have written you.\"  Jack and Dr. Chadwick shook hands.  Then Frank sat down and gave an account of his adventures in the three years since he had been separated from his father in Naples, Italy, soon after the great European war had broken out.  \"And you say your commander, Lord Hastings, is in New York?\" said his father.  \"He's in Washington today, sir,\" said Jack, \"but he probably will be back day after tomorrow, when we must return, sir.\"  \"I shall do myself the honor of calling on him,\" declared Dr. Chadwick.  \"He asked me particularly to bring you back with us, father,\" said Frank.  \"I'm glad you will go.\"  \"Of course I'll go,\" said Dr. Chadwick.  \"Now, son, I have a patient to see, so if you and Jack care to you can go down the street.  You may see some of your old friends.\"  Jack and Frank were the heroes of the town the two days they remained in Woburn.  Frank saw many of his old friends, and there is many a lad in the American navy today who enlisted as a result of Frank's harrangue that he answer his country's call.  True to his word, Dr. Chadwick accompanied the lads back to New York. Lord Hastings had returned to the metropolis ahead of them, and was in their room when they arrived.  The boys' commander and Frank's father shook hands warmly, and the lads withdrew to let them talk.  Over the dinner table that evening Lord Hastings recounted some of Frank's adventures which the lad had been too modest to tell.  Dr. Chadwick listened eagerly.  \"It is as I would have had him do,\" he exclaimed.  \"When I lost him in Naples I was terribly worried and I had the police scour the city for him.  At last I gave up hope that he was still alive and returned home.  Then I received a letter from Frank telling me that he had joined the British navy.  \"I am of old English descent and naturally enough my sympathies were always with the Allies. Therefore I sanctioned Frank's choice, but I have been fearful that I would never see him again.\"  \"How long will you stay in New York, Lord Hastings?\"  \"It's too bad,\" said Lord Hastings, \"but we shall leave here in the morning.\"  \"Is that so, sir?\" exclaimed Frank eagerly.  \"Where to, sir?\"  \"We have been ordered to Halifax,\" was Lord Hastings' reply.  \"There I shall take command of the British cruiser Lawrence.  We will be one of the convoy to protect the crossing of the first contingent of American troops.\"  \"I am sorry it is so soon,\" said Dr. Chadwick.  \"However, what must be, must be.\"  In spite of the fact that Frank hated to leave his father so soon again, he nevertheless was glad that the time of inaction was comparatively short.  Jack also showed his pleasure at Lord Hastings' announcement.  Dr. Chadwick remained in New York over night as the guest of Lord Hastings.  The four had breakfast together and then all repaired to the North station, where Dr. Chadwick took a train for Woburn and Lord Hastings and his two officers boarded a through train for Canada.  \"How does it happen,\" asked Frank, as they rode along that afternoon, \"that American troops will go across by the way of Halifax?\"  \"Submarines,\" returned Lord Hastings.  \"The channel from Halifax is well guarded, and it is believed that there is less danger by traversing that route.\"  \"Have you any idea how many men will form the first contingent?\" asked Frank.  \"No, I haven't,\" replied Lord Hastings.  \"That is something that is being well guarded by the United States war department.  It is just as well, too.  Nevertheless, I understand that there will be several large transports, at least.\"  The trio reached the Canadian city the following day, and Lord Hastings at once reported himself to the British commandant.  Before evening Lord Hastings had taken command of the Lawrence.  As of yore, Jack and Frank were his first and second officers.  \"And when will we sail, sir?\" asked Jack.  \"Tomorrow at nightfall,\" was his commander's reply.  Jack and Frank turned in early.  They were happy and eager for action.      CHAPTER XII  ACROSS THE ATLANTIC  The first contingent of American troops to cross the Atlantic to take their places on the firing line sailed in three divisions. Approximately 225,000 troops comprised the contingent.  The transports, on their voyage, were convoyed by British and American torpedo boats destroyers,  cruisers and other ships of war.  These were in sufficient number, American and British naval authorities believed, to protect the transports should they be attacked by German submarines.  The transports themselves carried big guns fore and aft and were so equipped as to be able to give a good account of themselves should occasion arise; and as the voyage progressed a sharp lookout was kept aboard every vessel of' the flotilla, that a submarine might not come unheralded within striking distance of the transports or their convoy.  Much to the disappointment of Jack and Frank,   they did not sail with the first section of the American troops; nor did they find themselves with the second.  In fact, it seemed to both lads that they were to be denied the honor of the trip altogether.  But in this belief they were wrong.  The British cruiser Lawrence, under command of Lord Hastings, with Jack as first officer and Frank the third in command, was ordered forth from a Canadian port as one of the convoy for the third section.  American troops were being transported to France by this northern route because naval authorities believed the route was less"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/608"],["title","Areopagitica (#0)"],["body","A SPEECH FOR THE LIBERTY OF UNLICENSED PRINTING TO THE PARLIAMENT OF ENGLAND       This is true liberty, when free-born men,      Having to advise the public, may speak free,      Which he who can, and will, deserves high praise;      Who neither can, nor will, may hold his peace:      What can be juster in a state than this?       Euripid.  Hicetid.   They, who to states and governors of the Commonwealth direct their speech, High Court of Parliament, or, wanting such access in a private condition, write that which they foresee may advance the public good; I suppose them, as at the beginning of no mean endeavour, not a little altered and moved inwardly in their minds: some with doubt of what will be the success, others with fear of what will be the censure; some with hope, others with confidence of what they have to speak. And me perhaps each of these dispositions, as the subject was whereon I entered, may have at other times variously affected; and likely might in these foremost expressions now also disclose which of them swayed most, but that the very attempt of this address thus made, and the thought of whom it hath recourse to, hath got the power within me to a passion, far more welcome than incidental to a preface.  Which though I stay not to confess ere any ask, I shall be blameless, if it be no other than the joy and gratulation which it brings to all who wish and promote their country's liberty; whereof this whole discourse proposed will be a certain testimony, if not a trophy. For this is not the liberty which we can hope, that no grievance ever should arise in the Commonwealth--that let no man in this world expect; but when complaints are freely heard, deeply considered and speedily reformed, then is the utmost bound of civil liberty attained that wise men look for. To which if I now manifest by the very sound of this which I shall utter, that we are already in good part arrived, and yet from such a steep disadvantage of tyranny and superstition grounded into our principles as was beyond the manhood of a Roman recovery, it will be attributed first, as is most due, to the strong assistance of God our deliverer, next to your faithful guidance and undaunted wisdom, Lords and Commons of England. Neither is it in God's esteem the diminution of his glory, when honourable things are spoken of good men and worthy magistrates; which if I now first should begin to do, after so fair a progress of your laudable deeds, and such a long obligement upon the whole realm to your indefatigable virtues, I might be justly reckoned among the tardiest, and the unwillingest of them that praise ye.  Nevertheless there being three principal things, without which all praising is but courtship and flattery: First, when that only is praised which is solidly worth praise: next, when greatest likelihoods are brought that such things are truly and really in those persons to whom they are ascribed: the other, when he who praises, by showing that such his actual persuasion is of whom he writes, can demonstrate that he flatters not; the former two of these I have heretofore endeavoured, rescuing the employment from him who went about to impair your merits with a trivial and malignant encomium; the latter as belonging chiefly to mine own acquittal, that whom I so extolled I did not flatter, hath been reserved opportunely to this occasion.  For he who freely magnifies what hath been nobly done, and fears not to declare as freely what might be done better, gives ye the best covenant of his fidelity; and that his loyalest affection and his hope waits on your proceedings. His highest praising is not flattery, and his plainest advice is a kind of praising. For though I should affirm and hold by argument, that it would fare better with truth, with learning and the Commonwealth, if one of your published Orders, which I should name, were called in; yet at the same time it could not but much redound to the lustre of your mild and equal government, whenas private persons are hereby animated to think ye better pleased with public advice, than other statists have been delighted heretofore with public flattery. And men will then see what difference there is between the magnanimity of a triennial Parliament, and that jealous haughtiness of prelates and cabin counsellors that usurped of late, whenas they shall observe ye in the midst of your victories and successes more gently brooking written exceptions against a voted Order than other courts, which had produced nothing worth memory but the weak ostentation of wealth, would have endured the least signified dislike at any sudden proclamation.  If I should thus far presume upon the meek demeanour of your civil and gentle greatness, Lords and Commons, as what your published Order hath directly said, that to gainsay, I might defend myself with ease, if any should accuse me of being new or insolent, did they but know how much better I find ye esteem it to imitate the old and elegant humanity of Greece, than the barbaric pride of a Hunnish and Norwegian stateliness. And out of those ages, to whose polite wisdom and letters we owe that we are not yet Goths and Jutlanders, I could name him who from his private house wrote that discourse to the Parliament of Athens, that persuades them to change the form of democracy which was then established. Such honour was done in those days to men who professed the study of wisdom and eloquence, not only in their own country, but in other lands, that cities and signiories heard them gladly, and with great respect, if they had aught in public to admonish the state. Thus did Dion Prusaeus, a stranger and a private orator, counsel the Rhodians against a former edict; and I abound with other like examples, which to set here would be superfluous.  But if from the industry of a life wholly dedicated to studious labours, and those natural endowments haply not the worst for two and fifty degrees of northern latitude, so much must be derogated, as to count me not equal to any of those who had this privilege, I would obtain to be thought not so inferior, as yourselves are superior to the most of them who received their counsel: and how far you excel them, be assured, Lords and Commons, there can no greater testimony appear, than when your prudent spirit acknowledges and obeys the voice of reason from what quarter soever it be heard speaking; and renders ye as willing to repeal any Act of your own setting forth, as any set forth by your predecessors.  If ye be thus resolved, as it were injury to think ye were not, I know not what should withhold me from presenting ye with a fit instance wherein to show both that love of truth which ye eminently profess, and that uprightness of your judgment which is not wont to be partial to yourselves; by judging over again that Order which ye have ordained to regulate printing:--that no book, pamphlet, or paper shall be henceforth printed, unless the same be first approved and licensed by such, or at least one of such, as shall be thereto appointed. For that part which preserves justly every man's copy to himself, or provides for the poor, I touch not, only wish they be not made pretences to abuse and persecute honest and painful men, who offend not in either of these particulars. But that other clause of licensing books, which we thought had died with his brother quadragesimal and matrimonial when the prelates expired, I shall now attend with such a homily, as shall lay before ye, first the inventors of it to be those whom ye will be loath to own; next what is to be thought in general of reading, whatever sort the books be; and that this Order avails nothing to the suppressing of scandalous, seditious, and libellous books, which were mainly intended to be suppressed. Last, that it will be primely to the discouragement of all learning, and the stop of truth, not only by disexercising and blunting our abilities in what we know already, but by hindering and cropping the discovery that might be yet further made both in religious and civil wisdom.  I deny not, but that it is of greatest concernment in the Church and Commonwealth, to have a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. For books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were in the eye. Many a man lives a burden to the earth; but a good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit, embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life. 'Tis true, no age can restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no great loss; and revolutions of ages do not oft recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want of which whole nations fare the worse.  We should be wary therefore what persecution we raise against the living labours of public men, how we spill that seasoned life of man, preserved and stored up in books; since we see a kind of homicide may be thus committed, sometimes a martyrdom, and if it extend to the whole impression, a kind of massacre; whereof the execution ends not in the slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at that ethereal and fifth essence, the breath of reason itself, slays an immortality rather than a life. But lest I should be condemned of introducing license, while I oppose licensing, I refuse not the pains to be so much historical, as will serve to show what"]]]
