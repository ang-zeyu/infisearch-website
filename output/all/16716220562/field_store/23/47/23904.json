There are three things, Squire, I like in a spekelation:—_First._ A fair shake; _Second._ A fair profit; and _Third,_ a fair share of fun.”  In the course of the afternoon, he said, “Squire, I have brought you my Journal, for I thought when I was a startin’ off, as there were some things I should like to point out to my old friend, it would be as well to deliver it myself and mention them, for what in natur’ is the good of letter writing? In business there is nothing like a good face to face talk. Now, Squire, I am really what I assume to be—I am, in fact, Sam Slick the Clockmaker, and nobody else. It is of no consequence however to the world whether this is really my name or an assumed one. If it is the first, it is a matter of some importance to take care of it and defend it; if it is a fictitious one, it is equally so to preserve my incognito. I may not choose to give my card, and may not desire to be known. A satirist, like an Irishman, finds it convenient sometimes to shoot from behind a shelter. Like him, too, he may occasionally miss his shot, and firing with intent to do bodily harm is almost as badly punished as if death had ensued. And besides, an anonymous book has a mystery about it. Moreover, what more right has a man to say to you, ‘Stand and deliver your name,’ than to say, ‘Stand and fork out your purse’—I can’t see the difference for the life of me. Hesitation betrays guilt. If a person inquires if you are to home, the servant is directed to say No, if you don’t want to be seen, and choose to be among the missing. Well, if a feller asks if I am _the Mr_ Slick, I have just as good a right to say, ‘Ask about and find out.’  “People sometimes, I actilly believe, take you for me. If they do, all I have to say is they are fools not to know better, for we neither act alike, talk alike, nor look alike, though perhaps we may think alike on some subjects. You was bred and born here in Nova Scotia, and not in Connecticut, and if they ask you where I was raised, tell them I warn’t raised at all, but was found one fine morning pinned across a clothes line, after a heavy washing to hum. It is easy to distinguish an editor from the author, if a reader has half an eye, and if he hain’t got that, it’s no use to offer him spectacles, that’s a fact. Now, by trade I am a clockmaker, and by birth I have the honour to be a Yankee. I use the word honour, Squire, a purpose, because I know what I am talking about, which I am sorry to say is not quite so common a thing in the world as people suppose. The English call all us Americans, Yankees, because they don’t know what they are talking about, and are not aware that it is only the inhabitants of New England who can boast of that appellation.1  1 Brother Jonathan is the general term for all. It originated thus. When General Washington, after being appointed commander of the army of the Revolutionary War, came to Massachusetts to organize it, and make preparations for the defence of the country, he found a great want of ammunition and other means necessary to meet the powerful foe he had to contend with, and great difficulty to obtain them. If attacked in such condition, the cause at once might be hopeless. On one occasion at that anxious period, a consultation of the officers and others was had, when it seemed no way could be devised to make such preparations as was necessary. His Excellency Jonathan Trumbull, the elder, was then Governor of the State of Connecticut, on whose judgment and aid the General placed the greatest reliance, and remarked, “We must consult ‘Brother Jonathan’ on the subject. The General did so, and the Governor was successful in supplying many of the wants of the army. When difficulties arose, and the army was spread over the country, it became a by-word, “We must consult Brother Jonathan.” The term Yankee is still applied to a portion, but “Brother Jonathan” has now become a designation of the whole country, as John Bull is for England.—BARTLETT’S AMERICANISMS.   “The southerners, who are both as proud and as sarcy as the British, call us Eastern folk Yankees as a term of reproach, because having no slaves, we are obliged to be our own niggers and do our own work, which is’nt considered very genteel, and as we are intelligent, enterprising, and skilful, and therefore too often creditors of our more luxurious countrymen, they do not like us the better for that, and not being Puritans themselves, are apt to style us scornfully, those ‘d—d Yankees.’  “Now all this comes of their not knowing what they are talking about. Even the New Englanders themselves, cute as they be, often use the word foolishly; for, Squire, would you believe it, none of them, though they answer to and acknowledge the appellation of Yankee with pride, can tell you its origin. I repeat, therefore, I have the honour to be a Yankee. I don’t mean to say that word is ‘all same,’ as the Indians say, as perfection; far from it, for we have some peculiarities common to us all. Cracking and boasting is one of these. Now braggin’ comes as natural to me as scratchin’ to a Scotchman. I am as fond of rubbing myself agin the statue of George the Third, as he is of se-sawing his shoulders on the mile-stones of the Duke of Argyle. Each in their way were great benefactors, the one by teaching the Yankees to respect themselves, and the other by putting his countrymen in an upright posture of happiness. So I can join hands with the North Briton, and bless them both.  “With this national and nateral infirmity therefore, is it to be wondered at if, as my ‘Sayings and Doings’ have become more popular than you or I ever expected, that I should crack and boast of them? I think not. If I have a claim, my role is to go ahead with it. Now don’t leave out my braggin’, Squire, because you are afraid people will think it is you speaking, and not me, or because you think it is bad taste as you call it. I know what I am at, and don’t go it—blind. My Journal contains much for my own countrymen as well as the English, for we expect every American abroad to sustain the reputation in himself of our great nation.  “Now our Minister to Victoria’s Court, when he made his brag speech to the great agricultural dinner at Gloucester last year, didn’t intend that for the British, but for us. So in Congress no man in either house can speak or read an oration more than an hour long, but he can send the whole lockrum, _includin’ what he didn’t say,_ to the papers. One has to brag before foreign assemblies, the other before a Congress, but both have an eye to the feelings of the Americans at large, and their own constituents in particular. Now that is a trick others know as well as we do. The Irish member from Kil_many,_ and him from Kil_more_, when he brags there never was a murder in either, don’t expect the English to believe it, for he is availed they know better, but the brag pleases the patriots to home, on account of its impudence.  “So the little man, Lord Bunkum, when he opens Oxford to Jew and Gentile, and offers to make Rothschild Chancellor instead of Lord Derby, and tells them old dons, the heads of colleges, as polite as a stage-driver, that he does it out of pure regard to them, and only to improve the University, don’t expect them to believe it; for he gives them a sly wink when he says so, as much as to say, how are you off for Hebrew, my old septuagenarians? Droll boy is Rothey, for though he comes from the land of _Ham,_ he don’t eat _pork._ But it pleases the sarcumsised Jew, and the unsarcumsised tag-rag and bobtail that are to be admitted, and who verily do believe (for their bump of conceit is largely developed) that they can improve the Colleges by granting educational excursion tickets.  “So Paddy O’Shonnosey the member for Blarney, when he votes for smashing in the porter’s lodges of that Protestant institution, and talks of Toleration and Equal Rights, and calls the Duke of Tuscany a broth of a boy, and a light to illumine heretical darkness, don’t talk this nonsense to please the outs or ins, for he don’t care a snap of his finger for either of them, nor because he thinks it right, for it’s plain he don’t, seeing that he would fight till he’d run away before Maynooth should be sarved arter that fashion; but he does it, because he knows it will please him, or them, that sent him there.  “There are two kinds of boastin’, Squire, act_ive_ and pass_ive_. The former belongs exclusively to my countrymen, and the latter to the British. A Yankee openly asserts and loudly proclaims his superiority. John Bull feels and looks it. He don’t give utterance to this conviction. He takes it for granted all the world knows and admits it, and he is so thoroughly persuaded of it himself, that, to use his own favourite phrase, he don’t care a fig if folks don’t admit it. His vanity, therefore, has a sublimity in it. He thinks, as the Italians say, ‘that when nature formed him, she broke the mould.’ There never was, never can, and never will be, another like him. His boastin’, therefore, is passive. He shows it and acts it; but he don’t proclaim it. He condescends and is gracious, patronizes and talks down to you. Let my boastin’ alone therefore, Squire, if you please. You know what it means, what bottom it has, and whether the plaster sticks on the right spot or not.  “So there is the first division of my subject. Now for the second. But don’t go off at half-cock, narvous like. I am not like the black preacher that had forty-eleven divisions. I have only a few more remarks to make. Well, I have observed that in editin’ my last Journal, you struck out some scores I made under certain passages and maxims, because you thought they were not needed, or looked vain. I know it looks consaited as well as you "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6112"],["title","Nature and Human Nature (#2)"],["body","do, but I know their use also. I have my own views of things. Let them also be as I have made them. They warn’t put there for nothin’. I have a case in pint that runs on all fours with it, as brother Josiah the lawyer used to say, and if there was anythin’ wantin’ to prove that lawyers were not strait up and down in their dealings, that expression would show it.  “I was to court wunst to Slickville, when he was addressin’ of the jury. The main points of his argument he went over and over again, till I got so tired I took up my hat and walked out. Sais I to him, arter court was prorogued and members gone home,  “‘Sy,’ sais I, ‘why on airth did you repeat them arguments so often? It was everlastin’ yarny.’  “‘Sam,’ sais he, and he gave his head a jupe, and pressed his lips close, like a lemon-squeezer, the way lawyers always do when they want to look wise, ‘_when I can’t drive a nail with one blow, I hammer away till I do git it in._ Some folks’ heads is as hard as hackmetacks—you have to bore a hole in it first to put the nail in, to keep it from bendin’, and then it is as touch as a bargain if you can send it home and clinch it.’  “Now maxims and saws are the sumtotalisation of a thing. Folks won’t always add up the columns to see if they are footed right, but show ’em the amount and result, and _that_ they are able to remember and carry away with them. No—no, put them Italics in, as I have always done. They show there is truth at the bottom. I like it, for it’s what I call sense on the short-cards—do you take? Recollect always, you are not Sam Slick, and I am not you. The greatest compliment a Britisher would think he could pay you, would be to say, ‘I should have taken you for an Englishman.’ Now the greatest compliment he can pay me is to take me for a Connecticut Clockmaker, who hoed his way up to the Embassy to London, and preserved so much of his nationality, after being so long among foreigners. Let the Italics be—you ain’t answerable for them, nor my boastin’ neither. When you write a book of your own, leave out both if you like, but as you only edit my Journal, if you leave them out, just go one step further, and leave out Sam Slick also.  “There is another thing, Squire, upon which I must make a remark, if you will bear with me. In my last work you made me speak purer English than you found in my Journal, and altered my phraseology, or rather my dialect. Now, my dear Nippent—”  “Nippent!” said I, “what is that?”  “The most endearing word in the Indian language for friend,” he said, “only it’s more comprehensive, including ally, foster-brother, life-preserver, shaft-horse, and everything that has a human tie in it.”  “Ah, Slick,” I said, “how skilled you are in soft sawder! You laid that trap for me on purpose, so that I might ask the question, to enable you to throw the lavender to me.”  “Dod drot that word soft sawder,” said he, “I wish I had never invented it. I can’t say a civil thing to anybody now, but he looks arch, as if he had found a mare’s nest, and says, ‘Ah, Slick! none of your soft sawder now.’ But, my dear nippent, by that means you destroy my individuality. I cease to be the genuine itinerant Yankee Clockmaker, and merge into a very bad imitation. You know I am a natural character, and always was, and act and talk naturally, and as far as I can judge, the little alteration my sojourn in London with the American embassy has made in my pronunciation and provincialism, is by no means an improvement to my Journal. The moment you take away my native dialect, I become the representative of another class, and cease to be your old friend ‘Sam Slick, the Clockmaker.’ Bear with me this once, Squire, and don’t tear your shirt, I beseech you, for in all probability it will be the last time it will be in your power to subject me to the ordeal of criticism, and I should like, I confess, to remain true to myself and to Nature to the last.  “On the other hand, Squire, you will find passages in this Journal that have neither Yankee words nor Yankee brag in them. Now pray don’t go as you did in the last, and alter them by insarten here and there what you call ‘Americanisms,’ so as to make it more in character and uniform; that is going to t’other extreme, for I can write as pure English, if I can’t speak it, as anybody can.1 My education warn’t a college one, like my brothers, Eldad’s and Josiah’s, the doctor and lawyer; but it was not neglected for all that. Dear old Minister was a scholar, every inch of him, and took great pains with me in my themes, letters, and composition. ‘Sam,’ he used to say, ‘there are four things needed to write well: first, master the language grammatically; second, master your subject; third, write naturally; fourth, let your heart as well as your hand guide the pen.’ It ain’t out of keeping therefore for me to express myself decently in composition if I choose. It warn’t out of character, with Franklin, and he was a poor printer boy, nor Washington, and he was only a land-surveyor, and they growed to be ‘some punkins’ too.  1 The reader will perceive from a perusal of this Journal, that Mr Slick, who is always so ready to detect absurdity in others, has in this instance exhibited a species of vanity by no means uncommon in this world. He prides himself more on composition, to which he has but small pretensions, than on those things for which the public is willing enough to give him full credit. Had he however received a classical education, it may well be doubted whether he would have been as useful or successful a man as President of Yale College, as he has been as an itinerant practical Clockmaker.   “An American clockmaker ain’t like a European one. He may not be as good a workman as t’other one, but he can do somethin’ else besides makin’ wheels and pulleys. One always looks forward to rise in the world, the other to attain excellence in his line. I am, as I have expressed it in some part of this Journal, not ashamed of having been a tradesman—I glory in it; but I should indeed have been ashamed if, with the instruction I received from dear old Minister, I had always remained one. No, don’t alter my Journal. I am just what I am, and nothing more or less. You can’t measure me by English standards; you must take an American one, and that will give you my length, breadth, height, and weight to a hair. If silly people take you for me, and put my braggin’ on your shoulders, why jist say, ‘You might be mistakened for a worse fellow than he is, that’s all.’ Yes, yes, let my talk remain ‘down-east talk,’1 and my writin’ remain clear of cant terms when you find it so.  1 It must not be inferred from this expression that Mr Slick’s talk is all “pure down-east dialect.” The intermixture of Americans is now so great, in consequence of their steamers and railroads, that there is but little pure provincialism left. They have borrowed from each other in different sections most liberally, and not only has the vocabulary of the south and west contributed its phraseology to New England, but there is recently an affectation in consequence of the Mexican war, to naturalise Spanish words, some of which Mr Slick, who delights in this sort of thing, has introduced into this Journal.—ED.   “I like Yankee words—I learned them when young. Father and mother used them, and so did all the old folks to Slickville. There is both fun, sense, and expression in ’em too, and that is more than there is in Taffy’s, Pat’s, or Sawney’s brogue either. The one enriches and enlarges the vocabulary, the other is nothing but broken English, and so confoundedly broken too, you can’t put the pieces together sometimes. Again, my writing, when I freeze down solid to it, is just as much in character as the other. Recollect this—Every woman in our country who has a son knows that he may, and thinks that he will, become President of the United States, and that thought and that chance make that boy superior to any of his class in Europe.  “And now, Squire,” said he, “I believe there has been enough said about myself and my Journal. Sposen we drink success to the ‘human nature,’ or ‘men and things,’ or whatever other name you select for this Journal, and then we will talk of something else.”  “I will drink that toast,” I said, “with all my heart, and now let me ask you how you have succeeded in your mission about the fisheries?”  “First rate,” he replied; “we have them now, and no mistake!”  “By the treaty?” I inquired.  “No,” he said, “I have discovered the dodge, and we shall avail of it at once. By a recent local law foreigners can hold real estate in this province now. And by a recent Act of Parliament our vessels can obtain British registers. Between these two privileges, a man don’t deserve to be called an American who can’t carry on the fisheries in spite of all the cruisers, revenue officers, and prohibitary laws under the sun. It is a peaceable and quiet way of getting possession, and far better than fighting for them, while it comports more with the dignity of our great and enlightened nation.”  “What do you think,” I said, “of the Elgin treaty as a bargain?”  After some hesitation, he looked up and smiled.  “We can’t complain,” said he. “As usual we have got hold of the right eend of the rope, and got a vast deal more than we expected. The truth is, the English are so fond of trade, and so afraid of war, if we will only give them cotton, and flour at a fair price, and take their manufactures in return, we can bully them into anythin’ almost. It is a positive fact, there were fifty deserters from the British army taken off of the wreck of the ‘San Francisco,’ and carried to England. John Bull pretended to wink at it, hired a steamer, and sent them all out again to us. Lord! how our folks roared when they heard it; and as for the President, he laughed like a hyena over a dead nigger. Law sakes alive man! Make a question between our nation and England about fifty desarters, and if the ministers of the day only"]]]
