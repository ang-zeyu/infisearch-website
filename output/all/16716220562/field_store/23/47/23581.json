I was awakened by a hand being pressed over my mouth. I tried to scream out, but the hand prevented me. There were two men in the room. They were both masked.”  “Can you describe them at all, madame?”  “One was very tall, and had a long black beard, the other was short and stout. His beard was reddish. They both wore hats pulled down over their eyes.”  “H’m,” said the magistrate thoughtfully, “too much beard, I fear.”  “You mean they were false?”  “Yes, madame. But continue your story.”  “It was the short man who was holding me. He forced a gag into my mouth, and then bound me with rope hand and foot. The other man was standing over my husband. He had caught up my little dagger paper-knife from the dressing-table and was holding it with the point just over his heart. When the short man had finished with me, he joined the other, and they forced my husband to get up and accompany them into the dressing-room next door. I was nearly fainting with terror, nevertheless I listened desperately.  “They were speaking in too low a tone for me to hear what they said. But I recognized the language, a bastard Spanish such as is spoken in some parts of South America. They seemed to be demanding something from my husband, and presently they grew angry, and their voices rose a little. I think the tall man was speaking. ‘You know what we want!’ he said. ‘_The secret!___ Where is it?’ I do not know what my husband answered, but the other replied fiercely: ‘You lie! We know you have it. Where are your keys?’  “Then I heard sounds of drawers being pulled out. There is a safe on the wall of my husband’s dressing-room in which he always keeps a fairly large amount of ready money. Léonie tells me this has been rifled and the money taken, but evidently what they were looking for was not there, for presently I heard the tall man, with an oath, command my husband to dress himself. Soon after that, I think some noise in the house must have disturbed them, for they hustled my husband out into my room only half dressed.”  “_Pardon___,” interrupted Poirot, “but is there then no other egress from the dressing-room?”  “No, monsieur, there is only the communicating door into my room. They hurried my husband through, the short man in front, and the tall man behind him with the dagger still in his hand. Paul tried to break away to come to me. I saw his agonized eyes. He turned to his captors. ‘I must speak to her,’ he said. Then, coming to the side of the bed, ‘It is all right, Eloise,’ he said. ‘Do not be afraid. I shall return before morning.’ But, although he tried to make his voice confident, I could see the terror in his eyes. Then they hustled him out of the door, the tall man saying: ‘One sound—and you are a dead man, remember.’  “After that,” continued Mrs. Renauld, “I must have fainted. The next thing I recollect is Léonie rubbing my wrists, and giving me brandy.”  “Madame Renauld,” said the magistrate, “had you any idea what it was for which the assassins were searching?”  “None whatever, monsieur.”  “Had you any knowledge that your husband feared something?”  “Yes. I had seen the change in him.”  “How long ago was that?”  Mrs. Renauld reflected.  “Ten days perhaps.”  “Not longer?”  “Possibly. I only noticed it then.”  “Did you question your husband at all as to the cause?”  “Once. He put me off evasively. Nevertheless, I was convinced that he was suffering some terrible anxiety. However, since he evidently wished to conceal the fact from me, I tried to pretend that I had noticed nothing.”  “Were you aware that he had called in the services of a detective?”  “A detective?” exclaimed Mrs. Renauld, very much surprised.  “Yes, this gentleman—M. Hercule Poirot.” Poirot bowed. “He arrived today in response to a summons from your husband.” And taking the letter written by M. Renauld from his pocket he handed it to the lady.  She read it with apparently genuine astonishment.  “I had no idea of this. Evidently he was fully cognizant of the danger.”  “Now, madame, I will beg of you to be frank with me. Is there any incident in your husband’s past life in South America which might throw light on his murder?”  Mrs. Renauld reflected deeply, but at last shook her head.  “I can think of none. Certainly my husband had many enemies, people he had got the better of in some way or another, but I can think of no one distinctive case. I do not say there is no such incident—only that I am not aware of it.”  The examining magistrate stroked his beard disconsolately.  “And you can fix the time of this outrage?”  “Yes, I distinctly remember hearing the clock on the mantelpiece strike two.” She nodded towards an eight-day travelling clock in a leather case which stood in the centre of the chimney-piece.  Poirot rose from his seat, scrutinized the clock carefully, and nodded, satisfied.  “And here too,” exclaimed M. Bex, “is a wrist watch, knocked off the dressing-table by the assassins, without doubt, and smashed to atoms. Little did they know it would testify against them.”  Gently he picked away the fragments of broken glass. Suddenly his face changed to one of utter stupefaction.  “_Mon Dieu!___” he ejaculated.  “What is it?”  “The hands of the watch point to seven o’clock!”  “What?” cried the examining magistrate, astonished.  But Poirot, deft as ever, took the broken trinket from the startled commissary, and held it to his ear. Then he smiled.  “The glass is broken, yes, but the watch itself is still going.”  The explanation of the mystery was greeted with a relieved smile. But the magistrate bethought him of another point.  “But surely it is not seven o’clock now?”  “No,” said Poirot gently, “it is a few minutes after five. Possibly the watch gains, is that so, madame?”  Mrs. Renauld was frowning perplexedly.  “It does gain,” she admitted, “but I’ve never known it to gain quite so much as that.”  With a gesture of impatience, the magistrate left the matter of the watch and proceeded with his interrogatory.  “Madame, the front door was found ajar. It seems almost certain that the murderers entered that way, yet it has not been forced at all. Can you suggest any explanation?”  “Possibly my husband went out for a stroll the last thing, and forgot to latch it when he came in.”  “Is that a likely thing to happen?”  “Very. My husband was the most absent-minded of men.”  There was a slight frown on her brow as she spoke, as though this trait in the dead man’s character had at times vexed her.  “There is one inference I think we might draw,” remarked the commissary suddenly. “Since the men insisted on M. Renauld dressing himself, it looks as though the place they were taking him to, the place where ‘the secret’ was concealed, lay some distance away.”  The magistrate nodded.  “Yes, far, and yet not too far, since he spoke of being back by morning.”  “What times does the last train leave the station of Merlinville?” asked Poirot.  “Eleven-fifty one way, and 12:17 the other, but it is more probable that they had a motor waiting.”  “Of course,” agreed Poirot, looking somewhat crestfallen.  “Indeed, that might be one way of tracing them,” continued the magistrate, brightening. “A motor containing two foreigners is quite likely to have been noticed. That is an excellent point, M. Bex.”  He smiled to himself, and then, becoming grave once more, he said to Mrs. Renauld:  “There is another question. Do you know any one of the name of ‘Duveen’?”  “Duveen?” Mrs. Renauld repeated, thoughtfully. “No, for the moment, I cannot say I do.”  “You have never heard your husband mention any one of that name?”  “Never.”  “Do you know any one whose Christian name is Bella?”  He watched Mrs. Renauld narrowly as he spoke, seeking to surprise any signs of anger or consciousness, but she merely shook her head in quite a natural manner. He continued his questions.  “Are you aware that your husband had a visitor last night?”  Now he saw the red mount slightly in her cheeks, but she replied composedly.  “No, who was that?”  “A lady.”  “Indeed?”  But for the moment the magistrate was content to say no more. It seemed unlikely that Madame Daubreuil had any connection with the crime, and he was anxious not to upset Mrs. Renauld more than necessary.  He made a sign to the commissary, and the latter replied with a nod. Then rising, he went across the room, and returned with the glass jar we had seen in the outhouse in his hand. From this, he took the dagger.  “Madame,” he said gently, “do you recognize this?”  She gave a little cry.  “Yes, that is my little dagger.” Then—she saw the stained point, and she drew back, her eyes widening with horror. “Is that—blood?”  “Yes, madame. Your husband was killed with this weapon.” He removed it hastily from sight. “You are quite sure about it’s being the one that was on your dressing-table last night?”  “Oh, yes. It was a present from my son. He was in the Air Force during the War. He gave his age as older than it was.” There was a touch of the proud mother in her voice. “This was made from a streamline aeroplane wire, and was given to me by my son as a souvenir of the War.”  “I see, madame. That brings us to another matter. Your son, where is he now? It is necessary that he should be telegraphed to without delay.”  “Jack? He is on his way to Buenos Ayres.”  “What?”  “Yes. My husband telegraphed to him yesterday. He had sent him on business to Paris, but yesterday he discovered that it would be necessary for him to proceed without delay to South America. There was a boat leaving Cherbourg for Buenos Ayres last night, and he wired him to catch it.”  “Have you any knowledge of what the business in Buenos Ayres was?”  “No, monsieur, I know nothing of its nature, but Buenos Ayres is not my son’s final destination. He was going overland from there to Santiago.”  And, in unison, the magistrate and the commissary exclaimed:  “Santiago! Again Santiago!”  It was at this moment, when we were all stunned by the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58866"],["title","The Murder on the Links (#7)"],["body","of that word, that Poirot approached Mrs. Renauld. He had been standing by the window like a man lost in a dream, and I doubt if he had fully taken in what had passed. He paused by the lady’s side with a bow.  “_Pardon___, madame, but may I examine your wrists.”  Though slightly surprised at the request, Mrs. Renauld held them out to him. Round each of them was a cruel red mark where the cords had bitten into the flesh. As he examined them, I fancied that a momentary flicker of excitement I had seen in his eyes disappeared.  “They must cause you great pain,” he said, and once more he looked puzzled.  But the magistrate was speaking excitedly.  “Young M. Renauld must be communicated with at once by wireless. It is vital that we should know anything he can tell us about this trip to Santiago.” He hesitated. “I hoped he might have been near at hand, so that we could have saved you pain, madame.” He paused.  “You mean,” she said in a low voice, “the identification of my husband’s body?”  The magistrate bowed his head.  “I am a strong woman, monsieur. I can bear all that is required of me. I am ready—now.”  “Oh, tomorrow will be quite soon enough, I assure you—”  “I prefer to get it over,” she said in a low tone, a spasm of pain crossing her face. “If you will be so good as to give me your arm, Doctor?”  The doctor hastened forward, a cloak was thrown over Mrs. Renauld’s shoulders, and a slow procession went down the stairs. M. Bex hurried on ahead to open the door of the shed. In a minute or two Mrs. Renauld appeared in the doorway. She was very pale, but resolute. Behind her, M. Hautet was clacking commiserations and apologies like an animated hen.  She raised her hand to her face.  “A moment, messieurs, while I steel myself.”  She took her hand away and looked down at the dead man. Then the marvellous self-control which had upheld her so far deserted her.  “Paul!” she cried. “Husband! Oh, God!” And pitching forward she fell unconscious to the ground.  Instantly Poirot was beside her, he raised the lid of her eye, felt her pulse. When he had satisfied himself that she had really fainted, he drew aside. He caught me by the arm.  “I am an imbecile, my friend! If ever there was love and grief in a woman’s voice, I heard it then. My little idea was all wrong. _Eh bien!___ I must start again!”     6 The Scene of the Crime  Between them, the doctor and M. Hautet carried the unconscious woman into the house. The commissary looked after them, shaking his head.  “_Pauvre femme___,” he murmured to himself. “The shock was too much for her. Well, well, we can do nothing. Now, M. Poirot, shall we visit the place where the crime was committed?”  “If you please, M. Bex.”  We passed through the house, and out by the front door. Poirot had looked up at the staircase in passing, and shook his head in a dissatisfied manner.  “It is to me incredible that the servants heard nothing. The creaking of that staircase, with _three___ people descending it, would awaken the dead!”  “It was the middle of the night, remember. They were sound asleep by then.”  But Poirot continued to shake his head as though not fully accepting the explanation. On the sweep of the drive, he paused, looking up at the house.  “What moved them in the first place to try if the front door were open? It was a most unlikely thing that it should be. It was far more probable that they should at once try to force a window.”  “But all the windows on the ground floor are barred with iron shutters,” objected the commissary.  Poirot pointed to a window on the first floor.  “That is the window of the bedroom we have just come from, is it not? And see—there is a tree by which it would be the easiest thing in the world to mount.”  “Possibly,” admitted the other. “But they could not have done so without leaving footprints in the flower-bed.”  I saw the justice of his words. There were two large oval flower-beds planted with scarlet geraniums, one each side of the steps leading up to the front door. The tree in question had its roots actually at the back of the bed itself, and it would have been impossible to reach it without stepping on the bed.  “You see,” continued the commissary, “owing to the dry weather no prints would show on the drive or paths; but, on the soft mould of the flower-bed, it would have been a very different affair.”  Poirot went close to the bed and studied it attentively. As Bex had said, the mould was perfectly smooth. There was not an indentation on it anywhere.  Poirot nodded, as though convinced, and we turned away, but he suddenly darted off and began examining the other flower-bed.  “M. Bex!” he called. “See here. Here are plenty of traces for you.”  The commissary joined him—and smiled.  “My dear M. Poirot, those are without doubt the footprints of the gardener’s large hobnailed boots. In any case, it would have no importance, since this side we have no tree, and consequently no means of gaining access to the upper story.”  “True,” said Poirot, evidently crestfallen. “So you think these footprints are of no importance?”  “Not the least in the world.”  Then, to my utter astonishment, Poirot pronounced these words:  “I do not agree with you. I have a little idea that these footprints are the most important things we have seen yet.”  M. Bex said nothing, merely shrugged his shoulders. He was far too courteous to utter his real opinion.  “Shall we proceed?” he asked instead.  “Certainly. I can investigate this matter of the footprints later,” said Poirot cheerfully.  Instead of following the drive down to the gate, M. Bex turned up a path that branched off at right angles. It led, up a slight incline, round to the right of the house, and was bordered on either side by a kind of shrubbery. Suddenly it emerged into a little clearing from which one obtained a view of the sea. A seat had been placed here, and not far from it was a rather ramshackle shed. A few steps further on, a neat line of small bushes marked the boundary of the Villa grounds. M. Bex pushed his way through these and we found ourselves on a wide stretch of open downs. I looked round, and saw something that filled me with astonishment.  “Why, this is a golf course,” I cried.  Bex nodded.  “The limits are not completed yet,” he explained. “It is hoped to be able to open them sometime next month. It was some of the men working on them who discovered the body early this morning.”  I gave a gasp. A little to my left, where for the moment I had overlooked it, was a long narrow pit, and by it, face downwards, was the body of a man! For a moment, my heart gave a terrible leap, and I had a wild fancy that the tragedy had been duplicated. But the commissary dispelled my illusion by moving forward with a sharp exclamation of annoyance:  “What have my police been about? They had strict orders to allow no one near the place without proper credentials!”  The man on the ground turned his head over his shoulder.  “But I have proper credentials,” he remarked, and rose slowly to his feet.  “My dear M. Giraud,” cried the commissary. “I had no idea that you had arrived, even. The examining magistrate has been awaiting you with the utmost impatience.”  As he spoke, I was scanning the new-comer with the keenest curiosity. The famous detective from the Paris Sûreté was familiar to me by name, and I was extremely interested to see him in the flesh. He was very tall, perhaps about thirty years of age, with auburn hair and moustache, and a military carriage. There was a trace of arrogance in his manner which showed that he was fully alive to his own importance. Bex introduced us, presenting Poirot as a colleague. A flicker of interest came into the detective’s eye.  “I know you by name, M. Poirot,” he said. “You cut quite a figure in the old days, didn’t you? But methods are very different now.”  “Crimes, though, are very much the same,” remarked Poirot gently.  I saw at once that Giraud was prepared to be hostile. He resented the other being associated with him, and I felt that if he came across any clue of importance he would be more than likely to keep it to himself.  “The examining magistrate—” began Bex again. But Giraud interrupted him rudely:  “A fig for the examining magistrate! The light is the important thing. For all practical purposes it will be gone in another half-hour or so. I know all about the case, and the people at the house will do very well until tomorrow, but, if we’re going to find a clue to the murderers, here is the spot we shall find it. Is it your police who have been trampling all over the place? I thought they knew better nowadays.”  “Assuredly they do. The marks you complain of were made by the workmen who discovered the body.”  The other grunted disgustedly.  “I can see the tracks where the three of them came through the hedge—but they were cunning. You can just recognize the centre footmarks as those of M. Renauld, but those on either side have been carefully obliterated. Not that there would really be much to see anyway on this hard ground, but they weren’t taking any chances.”  “The external sign,” said Poirot. “That is what you seek, eh?”  The other detective stared.  “Of course.”  A very faint smile came to Poirot’s lips. He seemed about to speak, but checked himself. He bent down to where a spade was lying.  “That’s what the grave was dug with, right enough,” said Giraud. “But you’ll get nothing from it. It was Renauld’s own spade, and the man who used it wore gloves. Here they are.” He gesticulated with his foot to where two soiled earth-stained gloves were lying. “And they’re Renauld’s too—or at least his gardener’s. I tell you, the men who planned out this crime were taking no chances. The man was stabbed with his own dagger, and would have been buried with his own spade. They counted on leaving no traces! But I’ll beat them. There’s always _something!___ And I mean to find it.”  But Poirot was now apparently interested in something else, a short discoloured piece of"]]]
