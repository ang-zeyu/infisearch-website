They stole his wallet and they stole his staff,       And then broke out in a great horse-laugh,            Rumsty Ho! rumsty Ho!”  There was more of this song, too. Next came “Crambambuli,” and then “Cocach-lunk” both of which were familiar to the doctor.  Then Walter said: “Brothers, I have great pleasure in stating that Professor Griggs has concluded to honor our dinner by his learned presence, and has consented to address us. Permit me to introduce Professor Theophilus Griggs.”  One of the company had made up as the mathematical professor. In a nasal tone he made a rambling speech, in which he introduced mathematical allusions, and used some of the favorite phrases of the rather dull and prosy instructor, with whom all the students were familiar, some to their sorrow. It seemed to be very amusing to the boys present, as shown by their hearty laughter, but of course Doctor Mack could not appreciate it.  Other songs and other speeches followed. Though for the most part college songs, there were some of a more serious character. Time slipped by, and at length Doctor Mack saw by his watch that it was half-past eleven.  “How long will they keep it up, I wonder?” he asked himself. “I feel drowsy.”  He was answered by the chairman.  “Brothers,” he said, “time waits for no man. The hour has arrived when, according to agreement, we must wind up our festivities. Hand in hand we will sing 'Auld Lang Syne,' hoping, at some auspicious season after the coming vacation is over, to have another good time. I thank you all for accepting my invitation, and hope you have enjoyed yourselves.”  “Three cheers for Sherwood!” cried one of the company.  They were given with a will. Then the parting song was sung, and the students retired to their rooms in one of the college dormitories.  Doctor Mack went thoughtfully to bed.  “It is well I came,” he reflected. “Walter has done nothing decidedly wrong as yet, but it is evident he is not improving.”  “Well,” said James Holdens as he met Doctor Mack the next morning, “did you hear the boys last night?”  “I couldn't very well help it,” answered the doctor, smiling. “That young Sherwood seems to be very popular.”  “Yes, sir; he is very free with his money.”  “In what other way does he spend it?”  “Mr. Daniels keeps half a dozen horses to let to students and others. Sherwood hires a team at least twice a week, and of course it counts up.”  “I was not able to spend money in that way when I attended college.”  “Then you are a college graduate?” said Holden.  “Yes.”  “Did you graduate at Euclid?”  “No; I am a Yale man.”  “I congratulate you, sir; I should like to graduate from Yale.  “I hope you may, some time, my young friend. You would derive more benefit, I'll be bound, than those young roysterers of last evening.”  “I hope they didn't keep you awake, sir.”  “They certainly did as long as they stayed. I should have gone to bed soon afterward, but that I had something on my mind. By the way, don't mention to any of the students that they had an unseen listener.”  “No, sir.”  Doctor Mack took the first train after breakfast, and returned to his home without seeing his ward.  Nancy Sprague questioned him eagerly.  “And how is Master Walter?” she asked.  “Very well, indeed, Nancy.”  “Was he surprised to see you?”  “He didn't see me, Nancy.”  “He didn't see you!” ejaculated the housekeeper.  “No; the fact was, I went away on a matter of business, and it was not convenient to call on Walter. But I heard him.”  “I don't see how you could have been near him without seeing him.”  “I shall see him soon, Nancy, and so will you. In two weeks vacation will be here. Examinations are near, and I might have interfered with his studies,” the doctor added, with a little innocent evasion.  “To be sure, sir! To be sure! I make no doubt Master Walter is a great scholar.”  “I have very strong doubts on that point myself,” thought Doctor Mack, but he did not care to express himself thus to Nancy.  “I am so glad the dear boy is coming home soon,” murmured the housekeeper. “He has been studying so hard he needs a good long rest. I will make some cookies expressly for him after he comes. I don't believe he gets any at college.”  “I wonder what Nancy would say if she could have seen Walter presiding at the supper, and heard the songs?” thought Doctor Mack.     CHAPTER IV  THE DAY AFTER THE FEAST   The same morning, in a comfortably furnished room in Simpson Hall, sat, or rather lounged, Walter Sherwood.  “I feel sleepy this morning, Gates,” he said to his chum. “I can't fix my mind on this confounded logic.”  “No wonder, Sherwood. You have good reason to be tired after last evening.”  “That's so! We had a good time, though. I am sorry you couldn't accept my invitation.”  “I couldn't afford it, Sherwood. You know we are very differently situated. You are rich, while I am the oldest son of a country minister, with all I can do to get through college. As it is, I shall be in debt.”  “Why not be in debt to me? You never would accept anything from me.”  “Yes, I did. I have let you go to the entire expense of furnishing this room, though I have an equal share in it.”  “Oh, that's nothing! You pay me in helping me through my lessons when I am behind. If you hadn't read my Horace to me the other day I should have flunked as sure as can be.”  “It would be better for you to get your own lesson, Walter.”  “Well, I suppose it would,” answered his roommate, yawning. “I wish you could drive this logic into my head. I suppose I am unusually stupid this morning.”  “Suppose we go over it together.”  Fifteen minutes later Walter said complacently: “Thanks, old fellow; you have made it as plain as a pikestaff.”  “And very likely you will get a higher mark at the recitation than I.”  “Well, perhaps so,” laughed Walter. “I suppose it is because I have more cheek than you.”  “You can do better on slight preparation, certainly. You talk like a professor when you are on your feet.”  “You want to be a professor some time, Gates, don't you?”  “Yes,” answered his chum, his face flushing, “I should be proud to become a professor in old Euclid.”  “It would be awfully slow, I think,” returned Walter, stifling a yawn.  “What then, is your ambition?”  “I want to go out among men. I want to take an active part in the world.”  “You will have to work harder than you do in college, then.”  “I suppose I shall. But I am young, Gates. I am only seventeen.”  “And I am nineteen, and look twenty-one.”  “All the better! The older you look the better, If you are going to be a college instructor. I would have to wait a long time if I wanted to, even if I were a good deal wiser than I am now. I am so young, in short, that I can afford to have a good time.”  “It seems to me that is all you think of, Sherwood.”  “Oh, well, I'll reform in time and become a sober old duffer like you,”  and Walter Sherwood laughed carelessly.  “I hope, at any rate, that you will change your views of life. You know what Longfellow says: 'Life is real! Life is earnest!'”  “Oh, yes, I know that by heart. But it's no use, Gates, you can't make an old man of me before my time. Will it disturb you if I play a tune or two on my violin?”  “Well, to tell the truth, it will. I want to get my Greek lesson, and you had better do the same.”  “No, I will read a novel, and you can read over the Greek to me when you have dug it out.”  “I will if you wish, but I am afraid I am spoiling you by doing your studying for you.”  “Remember, I was out late last night.”  “You have something almost every evening, Walter.”  “Oh, well, I'll turn over a new leaf next term.”  “Why not begin now?”  “If you knew how stupid I feel you wouldn't ask.”  Walter stretched himself out on a comfortable lounge, and took up a new novel which he had partially read, while Gates spread the big Greek lexicon on the study-table, and opening his Aristophanes, began slowly and laboriously to translate it into English.  Fifteen minutes passed when a knock was heard at the door.  “Come in!” called out Walter.  He looked up eagerly, hoping the visitor might prove to be one of his jovial comrades of the night before. But he did not look so well pleased when, as the door opened, he caught sight of the pudgy figure and shrewd face of Elijah Daniels, the proprietor of the Euclid Hotel.  “Good morning, Mr. Daniels.” he said, rather apprehensively. “So you have found me out.”  “No, I have found you in,” returned the landlord, with a smile. “I hope I don't intrude upon, your studies, young gentlemen.”  “Well, I am taking a little rest from my labors,” said Walter.  “You were up rather late last evening, Mr. Sherwood.”  “That's a fact, and you gave us a first-class supper, Daniels. You did yourself proud.”  “I did my best, Mr. Sherwood, and I am glad you were satisfied.”  “All the fellows praised the supper.”  “That's good. I know what you young gentlemen like, and I get it, no matter what it costs. I don't make much on the suppers I give the college boys, but of course I like to please them.”  “Your price is quite reasonable, I think.”  “I am glad you do. I have brought in the bill for last night's entertainment, and if you can let me have the money, I shall be glad.”  “Well, the fact is, Daniels, I haven't got the money by me this morning.”  The landlord's countenance changed.  “I like prompt pay,” he said. “It is a good deal of trouble, and, as I said, there isn't much money to be made.”  “That's all right. You won't have to wait long.”  “How long, Mr. Sherwood?”  “I expect a check for a hundred dollars from my guardian to-day. I wrote three days since, for I knew you wouldn't like to wait.”  “A hundred dollars!” repeated the landlord, feeling a little easier in mind.  “Yes.”  “Perhaps your guardian may object to sending it.”  “Oh, no! He's a nice old fellow, Doctor Mack is. He is very indulgent.”  “What name did you mention?  “Doctor Mack. Ezekiel Mack.”  “Indeed! Why, we had a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5993"],["title","Walter Sherwood's Probation (#3)"],["body","stopping at the hotel last night of that name.”  “What!” ejaculated Walter, in astonishment. “Do you mean to tell me that Doctor Mack--my guardian--was at the hotel last night? It can't be. He would have called on me.”  “It may not have been the same man. Now I come to think of it, he didn't put himself down on the book Doctor Mack. He just put himself down E. Mack. He seemed a plain sort of man.”  “Where did he register from?” asked Walter eagerly.  “From Albany.”  “Is he at the hotel now?”  “He went away by the morning train.”  “Then it couldn't have been he,” said Walter, in a tone of relief. “He doesn't live in Albany. Besides, he would have called on me. No, it must have been some other Mack.”  “Perhaps you wouldn't have liked to have him catch you at a gay supper, Mr. Sherwood?” said the landlord shrewdly.  “Well, no, I'd a little rather receive him in my room, with a book open before me.”  “He might object to pay out money for such doings.”  “He won't know anything about it. Just leave your bill, Mr. Daniels, and as soon as I get the check I'll call round and pay it.”  “There's another bill, too, a livery bill. I brought that along, too.”  “How much is it?” asked Walter anxiously.  “Eighteen dollars.”  “I didn't think it was as much as that!”  “Bills mount up faster than you young gentlemen think for. I suppose, however, you can afford to pay it?”  “Oh, yes!” said Walter carelessly.  “Your uncle may think it rather steep, eh?”  “I wrote him that I had some extra expenses this time.”  “Then I suppose you can't do anything for me this morning?”  “No, Daniels; just leave both bills, and I feel quite sure that I can pay you in a day or two. I suppose you can change a check?”  “I'll manage to.”  The landlord retired, leaving the bills behind him.  “Do you know, Sherwood,” said his chum gravely “I think you are foolishly extravagant.”  “Well, perhaps I am.”  “You are spending three times as much as I am.”  “I'll do better next term. I wish my guardian would hurry along that check.”  Two days later a letter came for Walter in the familiar handwriting of Doctor Mack. He tore it open hastily, and as he read it he turned pale and sank into a chair.  “What's the matter?” asked Gates.  “Matter enough!” answered Walter, in a hollow voice. “My money is lost, and I've got to leave college!”     CHAPTER V  WALTER TAKES MATTERS PHILOSOPHICALLY   Walter's announcement, recorded at the close of the preceding chapter, fell like a thunderbolt on his room-mate.  “You have lost your money?” repeated Gates, in a tone of incredulity. “You don't mean it!”  “Read that letter, Gates,” said Walter, pushing it over to his chum.  The letter was, of course, from Doctor Mack, and ran thus:  “DEAR WALTER: Your letter asking for an extra check for one hundred dollars came to hand three or four days since. I have delayed answering for two reasons. I am satisfied that you are spending more money than is necessary, and, moreover, I have shrunk from communicating to you some unpleasant intelligence. Upon me have devolved the investment and management of your property, and while I have tried to be cautious, there have been losses which I regret. In one case three-fourths of an investment has been lost. Of course, you didn't know this, or you would have been less free in your expenditures.  “I am not prepared to tell you how you stand. I think it will be prudent for you to leave college at the end of this term, and for a year to seek some employment. During that time I will do what I can to settle matters on a better footing, and perhaps at the end of that time you will be able to return to your studies. You are so young--I think you must be younger than the majority of your classmates--that you can afford to lose the time.  “I send you a check for sixty dollars in place of a hundred. I wish you to have your regular term bills sent to me, and I will forward checks in payment. I will see that you leave Euclid owing no man anything. When you come home for the vacation we can consult as to the future. I hope you will not be much depressed or cast down by the news I send. Your money is not all lost, and I may be able, in the course of twelve months, to recover in a large measure what has been sunk.  “Your affectionate guardian,           EZEKIEL MACK.”  “A regular sockdolager, isn't it, Gates?” said Walter.  “I don't see that it's so bad,” answered Gates slowly. “Your money isn't all lost.”  “But I must leave college.”  “True; but, as your guardian says, you are young, and if you come back at the end of a year you will still be a year younger than I for your standing. Of course, I am sorry to have you go.”  “I am sure of that, Gates.”  “Is the prospect of working for a year so unpleasant to you, Walter?”  “No, I can't say it is,” said Walter, brightening up, “not if I can choose my employment. I shouldn't like to go behind the counter in a grocery store, or--”  “Black boots for a living?”  “Well, hardly,” said Walter, laughing.  “Probably your guardian will consult your preferences.”  “I wish I could arrange to travel. I should like to see something of the world.”  “Why not? You might get an agency of some kind. One college vacation--last summer--I traveled about as book agent.”  “How did you like it?”  “Not very much. I met with a good many rebuffs, and was occasionally looked upon with suspicion, as I could see. Still, I made a living, and brought back thirty dollars to start me on my new term.”  “Just what my supper cost the other evening.”  “Yes; I didn't think it wise to spend the money in the same way.”  “You have cheered me up, Gates. I really believe I shall like to spend a year in some kind of business.”  “Write your guardian to that effect. He may be blaming himself for his agency in your misfortune, and a cheerful letter from you will brighten him up.”  “All right! I will.”  Walter sat down and dashed off the following note:  “DEAR GUARDIAN: Your letter just received. I won't pretend that I am not sorry for the loss of my money, but I am sure that you acted for the best. Don't trouble yourself too much about the matter. Perhaps it will all come out right in a year or so. In the meantime I think I shall find it not unpleasant to work for a year if you will let me select the kind of business I am to follow.  “I will make the money you sent me do for the present, and will send you my term bills as you desire. You can depend upon my settling up as cheap as possible, though I confess I have not hitherto been nearly as economical as I might have been. Now that I know it is necessary, you shall have no reason to complain of me.  “Your affectionate ward,          WALTER SHERWOOD.”  “What do you think of that, Gates?” asked Walter, giving the letter to his chum to read.  “Excellent! It shows the right spirit.”  “I am glad you think so.”  “Do you know, Walter, I think I have more occasion for regret than you? I must bid farewell to my room-mate and this pleasant room.”  “To your room-mate, yes, but not necessarily to the room.”  “I shall have to furnish it in very different style for the present. I am not sure that I can afford a carpet. The luxury of my present surroundings, I am afraid, will spoil me for humble quarters.”  “Don't borrow any trouble about that. I shall leave you the furniture as it stands, and when I come back to college, even if we are in different classes, you must take me in again.”  “Of course I will agree to an arrangement so much in my favor, but perhaps your guardian will think you had better sell the furniture and realize what you can.”  “No, I am sure he won't. There's nothing mean about Doctor Mack. You can take in any one you please in my place, only I am to come back at the end of a year if things turn out well.”  “I heartily hope you will come back, and if you will excuse my saying so, with a more earnest spirit, and a determination to do justice to your really excellent talents.”  “Good advice! I'll adopt it. I'll begin to do better at once. I was intending to take a drive this evening, but it would cost me two dollars, and I will stay at home and save the money.”  “Come with me on a walk, instead.”  “I will.”  “We will go to the top of Mount Legar. At sunset there will be a fine view from there.”  “I must stop on the way and pay Mr. Daniels what I owe him. He will lose a good deal by my going away.”  “True; but his loss will be your gain.”  At the outset of their walk the two students called at the hotel, and found Mr. Daniels on the piazza.  “Glad to see you, Mr. Sherwood,” said the landlord briskly.  “I think you will be, Mr. Daniels, for I have come to pay your bills.”  “Money is always welcome, Mr. Sherwood. You have no idea how much I lose by trusting students. There was Green, of the last graduating class, left college owing me forty-five dollars. He has gone West somewhere, and I never expect to get a cent of my money.”  “You came pretty near losing by me, Daniels.”  “How is that?” queried the landlord, looking surprised.  “I've lost a lot of money, or my guardian has for me, and I've got to leave college at the end of this term.”  “You don't say so!” ejaculated Mr. Daniels regretfully.  “It's all true. My guardian wrote me about it this morning.”  “I suppose you're a good deal cut up about it, Mr. Sherwood.”  “Well, I was at first, but I may be able to come back after a year or two. I shall go into some business, and meanwhile my guardian will do what he can to recover the money lost. It isn't so bad, after all.”  “I shall be sorry to have you go, Mr. Sherwood.”  “You will miss my bills, at any rate. I wouldn't have given that supper the other evening if I had known how things stood. I would have put the thirty dollars to better use.”  “Well, you've paid up like a gentleman, anyway. I hope you'll come back in a year as rich as ever. You wanted a team to-night, James told me.”  “That was before I got my guardian's letter. I shall walk, instead of taking a carriage-ride.”  “I will let the account stand,"]]]
