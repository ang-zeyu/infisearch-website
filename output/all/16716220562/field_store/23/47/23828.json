Drake     CHAPTER I  JACK'S ADVENTURE   Frank Chadwick jumped from a chair in the front window and ran toward the door.  A form had swung from the sidewalk along the drive that marked the entrance to Lord Hasting's London home and at sight of it Frank had uttered an exclamation.  Now, as the figure climbed the steps, Frank flung open the door.  \"Jack!\" he exclaimed with outstretched hand.  \"I feared something had happened, you have been gone so long and we had heard nothing of you.\"  \"I'm perfectly whole,\" laughed Jack, grasping his friend's hand.  \"Why, I've been gone less than two weeks.\"  \"But you expected to be gone only a day or two.\"  \"That's true, but a fellow can't tell what is going to happen, you know.  I wasn't sure I should find you here when I returned, though.\"  \"You probably wouldn't had you come a day later,\" returned Frank.  \"How's that?\"  \"We sail tomorrow night,\" said Frank.  \"By George!  Then I'm back just in time,\" declared Jack.  \"Where bound this time?\"  \"I don't know exactly, but personally I believe to America.\"  \"Why?\"  \"The United States, I understand, is about to declare war on Germany.  I have heard it said that immediately thereafter American troops will be sent to Europe.\"  \"What's that got to do with our voyage?\"  \"I'm coming to that.  There will be need, of convoys for the American transports.  I believe that is the work in which we will be engaged.\"  \"That will be first rate, for a change,\" said Jack.  \"But come,\" said Frank, leading the way into the house.  \"Where have you been?  Tell me about yourself.\"  \"Wait, until I get a breath,\" laughed Jack, making himself comfortable in a big armchair.  \"By the way, where is Lord Hastings?\"  \"He is in conference with the admiralty.\"  \"And Lady Hastings?\"  \"Shopping, I believe.  However, both will be back before long.  Now let's have an account of your adventures.\"  \"Well, they didn't amount to much,\" said Jack.  \"Where've you been?\"  \"Pretty close to Heligoland.\"  \"What!  Again?\"  \"Exactly.  You remember how Lord Hastings came to us one day and said that the admiralty had need of a single officer at that moment, and that we both volunteered?\"  \"I certainly do,\" declared Frank, \"and we drew straws to see which of us should go.  I lost.\"  \"Exactly.  Well, when I reached the admiralty I found there a certain Captain Ames.  I made myself known and was straightway informed that I would do as well as another.  Captain Ames was in command of the British destroyer Falcon.  He was bound on active duty at once, and he took me along as second in command.\"  \"Where was he bound?\" demanded Frank.  \"And what was the nature of the work?\"  \"The nature of the work,\" said Jack, \"was to search out German mines ahead of the battleships, who were to attempt a raid of Heligoland.\"  \"Great Scott!\" exclaimed Frank.  \"I hadn't heard anything about that. Was the raid a success?\"  \"It was not,\" replied Jack briefly.  \"Explain,\" said Frank.  \"I'm trying to,\" smiled Jack.  \"Give me a chance, will you?\"  He became silent and mused for a few moments.  Then he said meditatively:  \"The destroyer service might well be called the cavalry of the sea.  It calls for dashing initiative, aggressiveness and courage and daring to the point of rashness.  Where an officer would be justified--even duty bound--by navy standards to run away with a bigger and more valuable vessel, the commander of a destroyer often must close in to almost certain annihilation.\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" said Frank slyly.  \"You are not feeling a bit proud of yourself, are you?\"  \"Oh, I'm not talking about myself,\" said Jack quietly.  \"I was thinking of a man like Captain Ames--and other men of his caliber.  However, I've been pretty close to death myself, and having come as close to a fellow as death did to me, I believe he'll become discouraged and quit.  Yes, sir, I don't believe I shall ever die afloat.\"  \"Don't be too cock-sure,\" said Frank dryly.  \"However, proceed.\"  \"Well,\" Jack continued, \"I followed Captain Ames aboard the Falcon and we put to sea immediately.  It was the following night that we found ourselves mixed up in the German mine fields and so close to the fortress itself that we were in range of the land batteries as well as the big guns of the German fleet.  Our main fleet came far behind us, for the big ships, of course, would not venture in until we had made sure of the position of the mines.\"  \"Right,\" said Frank.  \"I can see that--\"  \"Look here,\" said Jack, \"who's telling this story?\"  \"You are,\" said Frank hastily.  \"Go ahead.\"  \"All right, but don't interrupt me.  As I said, we'd been searching mines for the battleships.  Better to lose a dozen or two of us little fellows than one of the dreadnoughts, so we steamed ahead like a fan with nets spread and a sharp lookout.  We lost a few craft by bumping mines, but we destroyed a lot of the deadly things by firing into the fields and detonating them.  \"We could generally tell when we were getting close to a field, which at this point was protected by the land batteries, for the batteries would redouble their fire.  Might better have saved their powder and let us run into the fields and be blown to bits, you will say.  Not at all.  They would consider that a waste of good mines.  Nobody wants to waste a whole mine on a poor little torpedo boat destroyer--and twenty to forty men.  There's no profit in that.  \"We were sneaking along slowly, feeling our way and sitting on the slippery edge of eternity when the batteries opened up.  \"'We're getting warmer,' said Ames.  \"It was close range work and we were able to reply to the fire of the land batteries with our little 3-inch beauties, although I don't suppose we did much good.  It makes a fellow feel better, however, as you know, if he's barking back.  It's funny how most men have a dread of dying without letting the other fellow know why he's there.  It doesn't seem so bad when you're hammering him.  \"Anyway, it was part of our business.  \"There was a bunch of red buoys anchored along one side where our chart showed the channel to be, and we supposed that they had been used by the German destroyers as channel buoys or to mark mine fields.  \"It developed that the Germans had anchored those buoys and got the range of them so they could have their guns already set for anything that came near them.  Some of our boats were hit by the first fire.  It was a desperate spot.  \"We were up near the lead and we had to run fairly well in advance of the main body.  As you know, it often happens that when a vessel is steaming head-on very fast, it is difficult to hit her.  It seems to rattle the gunners the same as charging infantry does the defenders.  \"Shell after shell missed, but there were so many of them falling around us that we were almost smothered in the spray.  We had all been under fire before, so it didn't have much effect on us, though.  \"Then a shell hit us amidships and tore out one of our boilers.  I was on the bridge with Captain Ames at the time.  \"'Go below and report,' said Ames, just as calmly as though we were at maneuvers and one of our piston rods was pounding a little.  \"I went down into a cloud of steam and found two men, pretty well scalded, dragging out the others who had been more badly hurt by the explosion.  There wasn't enough of the water tight compartment left to shut it off from the rest of the vessel, but we still had one boiler intact.  \"I directed the men to carry the wounded above and started back for the bridge.  Just as my feet were on the bottom of the ladder there was another crash.  The body of a man who had just reached the deck came toppling down in a shower of splinters and debris.  \"Well, I got back on to my feet and made the deck.  A shell had exploded right atop of us and nearly swept us clean.  The bridge was almost carried away.  Captain Ames lay under a light steel beam and I thought he was dead.  I ran over to him.  As I approached he shook off the beam and got up.  One of his legs gave way and he had to hold on to a stanchion for support.  \"'Cut off my trouser leg!' he shouted, very much excited.  \"I ripped out my knife and did as he ordered.  Then he twisted the cloth around his leg above an ugly gash and tied it.  \"'What's gone below?' he demanded.  'One boiler,' I replied.  \"'Might have been both,' grunted Ames, and added, 'Well, we're not out of this fight yet.\"'  Jack paused a moment.  \"A brave man!\" cried Frank.  \"Go ahead, Jack.\"  Jack cleared his throat and proceeded.      CHAPTER II  THE BATTLE  \"Well,\" Jack continued, \"Ames espied one of the destroyers that had been leading us floundering around helplessly, with the German destroyer, which had appeared from nowhere, trying to cut her off.  \"'Templeton,' said Ames, 'take the hand steering gear and run in there and get that fellow out.'  \"I ran over to the hand gear.  A fellow couldn't be frightened with a man like Ames telling him what to do.  Ames propped himself up against what was left of the bridge and directed the gunners while we made the best speed we could with our single boiler.  \"They were still dousing us with water, but the shells were not falling on board now.  The two German destroyers were sweeping down on the helpless boat ahead, the missiles from their light guns playing a regular tattoo on her.  It was an even chance we wouldn't find a live man aboard her.  \"Ames was having a glorious time where he had propped himself against the shattered bridge.  He swore every time one of our shells missed and he laughed gleefully every time one went home.  \"We were only about a thousand yards from the British destroyer now and it looked like there was a fair chance of getting her out of the mess. I was beginning to have hope when I heard the screaming of a heavy shell from one of the land forts.  Exactly amidships of the destroyer it landed.  It broke her back and all her ribs, so to speak.  Steam and steel and water and men flew"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6072"],["title","The Boy Allies with Uncle Sam's Cruisers (#1)"],["body","in the air.  Everything aboard her was blown to bits.  \"There was no use trying to tow her out now.  I searched the water with my glass for living men.  I figured we might be able to save a few if any survived, although it was against admiralty orders to stop when in danger.  I didn't believe in the admiralty's stand at that moment.  But I couldn't make out a living soul.  \"The Germans immediately turned their attention to us.  Their marksmanship was getting better.  There was a frightful jar and the steering gear was wrenched out of my hands and I was thrown to the deck.  When I picked myself up there was nothing with which to steer. Our rudder and a part of our stern had been shot away--  \"'Alternate the screws!' Ames yelled.  'I'm busy with these guns. We'll fight as long as she floats!'  \"The speaking tubes existed no longer.  I stationed a man at the hatch--and another below and transmitted my orders to the engine room by them.  First we drove ahead with one screw, then with the other, to get a zig-zag course; next we backed first with one propeller and then the other.  Each time we backed farther than we went forward, for I wanted to get out of the mess if possible.  The crazy course threw the enemy gunners off somewhat.  \"Suddenly I heard a yell from Ames.  We'd put one of the German destroyers out of business.  The other one was steaming toward us, but she was a long ways off.  \"The men were cheering.  I looked at the second destroyer, thinking we must have finished her, too, but she was still firing.  Then I glanced around to see what the men were yelling about.  \"Right into that hail of fire steamed a little mine sweeper.  She looked for all the world like a tugboat.  She had a single gun mounted in her bow, and one or two amidships.  She had no armor and a rifle bullet probably would have pierced her sides with ease, but she pounded straight toward us; the water around her was beaten to a foam.  \"Far out on the prow stood a man with a coil of rope.  Ames sent a man to our stern.  The sweeper had come close.  The man in the prow swung his rope and let the coil fly.  It fell across our stern.  There wasn't much left to make it fast to, but we did it somehow and the sweeper started to tow us out of that particular part of the water.  \"Our guns continued to bark at the destroyer, which was gaining on us. Some of our shots went home.  The little old tugboat was hit once, but her master stuck to his task; and he undoubtedly saved our lives.  \"Gradually we were pulled back, till at length we were under the protection of the guns of our fleet.  From the flagship, signals were being flashed for our benefit.  Ames read the flags through his glasses.\"  \"'Congratulating us?' I asked.  \"'Blast him, no!' shouted Ames. 'He wants to know why in blazes we didn't come out when we had a chance.  Well, he wouldn't have come out himself had he been here, and I've been on the flagship, so we needn't feel sensitive about it!'  \"And that's about all,\" Jack continued, \"except for the fact that the raid by the battle fleet was given up.  We cruised about for several days, in spite of our crippled condition.  The ship's carpenter put us in condition to stay afloat, but at last we returned.  I came here the moment I had landed.\"  \"Well, you had a pretty strenuous time, if you ask me,\" declared Frank.  \"Too bad, though, that the raid couldn't have been made.  We might have captured Heligoland.\"  \"The Germans might capture Gibraltar,\" said Jack, with a vein of sarcasm in his voice, \"but I don't think they will--not right away.\"  \"It can be done, though,\" declared Frank.  \"What?  The Germans capture Gibraltar?\"  \"No, I mean the British can take Heligoland.  Wait until Uncle Sam gets in the war, he'll show you a few things.\"  \"Maybe so,\" said Jack, \"but what's all this talk I hear about the United States declaring war on Germany?\"  \"It's only talk, so far,\" said Frank, \"but it seems certain to come. In fact, the war resolution already has passed the house and is being debated in the senate.  It wouldn't surprise me if the senate passed it today.  Then all that is needed is the signature of President Wilson.\"  \"Well, let's hope there is no hitch,\" said Jack fervently.  \"I don't think there will be.  Come, let's go to our room and wait for Lord Hastings.\"  The two boys went upstairs, and while they are awaiting the arrival of Lord Hastings, a few words will be necessary to introduce them more fully.  Frank Chadwick was an American lad of possibly nineteen.  He had been in Italy when the great European war broke out, and through a misfortune had been shanghaied aboard a sailing vessel.  After some adventures he fell in with Jack Templeton, a young Englishman, who had spent most of his life on the north coast of Africa.  Together the lads had disposed of the crew of the vessel.  They became fast friends.  Fortune threw them in the path of Lord Hastings, British nobleman and secret service agent, and they had gone through all kinds of troubles with him.  Lord Hastings had commanded several vessels during the course of the war, and Jack and Frank upon these occasions had been his first officers.  Both lads spoke German and French fluently, and both had a smattering of several other tongues.  Jack was huge in stature and of enormous strength for one of his age.  Frank, on the other hand, was rather small, but what he lacked in physical strength he more than made up in courage.  Frank's greatest accomplishment, and one that had caused Jack much envy, was shooting.  He could hit almost anything with a rifle, and revolvers in his hands were no less deadly.  Frank's chief trouble was his hot-headedness and more than once this had gotten him into such trouble that it took all Jack's resourcefulness to extricate him.  Both lads had seen service in many parts of the world since they had met Lord Hastings.  Their commander recently had lost his vessel and the three had been on indefinite leave of absence.  The day before Jack's return Frank had been informed by Lord Hastings that they were about to put to sea again.  \"Well,\" said Frank, when the two were in the room always reserved for their use when they were in London, \"Lord Hastings will be glad to see you back again.  He has been anxious, especially now that he has been ordered again on active service.  He has been wondering where he would get a first officer.\"  \"I guess you could, fill that place without any trouble,\" said Jack.  \"I guess I could fill it all right, if I had to, but I would much rather have you along,\" declared Frank.  \"Well, I'm glad to be back, old fellow,\" said Jack.  \"I'll admit that for a few minutes there the other night it looked as though I would never see London again, but everything is all right at last.\"  There were the sounds of footsteps below.  These a few moments later ascended the stairs.  \"Probably Lord Hastings,\" said Frank.  The lad was right and a moment later Lord Hastings stepped into the room.  His eyes fell upon Jack and he advanced with outstretched hand.  \"Jack!\" he exclaimed.  \"I certainly am glad to see you again.\"  They shook hands heartily.      CHAPTER III  SAILING   \"Frank tells me,\" said Jack, at the dinner table that evening, \"that we are about to sail again; about to go into active service.\"  Lord Hastings smiled.  \"There has been a slight alteration in plans since I spoke to Frank last,\" he said.  \"You mean that we are not to go, Sir?\" asked Frank.  His face showed his disappointment.  \"Not exactly,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"But,\" Jack interrupted, \"Frank said that we would help convoy American troops to England and France.\"  \"Frank lets his imagination run away with him sometimes,\" said Lord Hastings quietly.  \"America has not yet declared war on Germany.\"  \"But she will, sir,\" said Frank positively.  \"That is probably true,\" said Lord Hastings, \"although the resolution is being fought in the senate, according to latest cable advices. However, as you say, America will undoubtedly declare war.  But even should American troops be sent to Europe it will not be for several months after war is declared.\"  \"I thought they would send the regulars right away, sir,\" said Frank.  \"Hardly.  However, it is possible that an American fleet will be dispatched to act in conjunction with the British grand fleet in the war zone.\"  \"Then we must sit home, sir?\" asked Frank.  \"I didn't say that,\" said Lord Hastings, smiling.  \"You are too quick to jump at conclusions, Frank.\"  Frank flushed a trifle.  \"I'm just disappointed, sir,\" he replied.  \"You need not be,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"There is work ahead.  In fact, I may say that you will leave England some time tomorrow.\"  \"Is that so, sir?\" exclaimed Frank, happy again instantly.  \"Where do we go, sir?\"  \"I am not going at all,\" said Lord Hastings; \"at least, not for some time yet.  You and Jack will make this trip alone.\"  \"That's too bad,\" declared Jack quietly.  \"We always like to have you with us, sir.\"  \"I know you do,\" laughed Lord Hastings,  \"However, I will turn up later, so don't worry.\"  \"In that event, it's all right,\" grinned Jack.  \"Will you, tell us where we are going, sir, and what we are to do?\" asked Frank.  \"I will if you will restrain your impatience,\" said Lord Hastings.  Frank felt this rebuke and became silent.  A moment later Lord Hastings continued:  \"I suppose you have heard that there is another German raider operating in the Atlantic off the coast of South America?\"  \"No, sir,\" said Frank, \"I had not heard of it.\"  \"Nor I,\" said Jack.  \"Nevertheless, it's true,\" said Lord Hastings.  \"Where it came from no one seems to know, but many merchant ships have been sunk by this raider.  It is understood that she has citizens of allied countries aboard to the number of several hundred.\"  \"Must be a big ship, sir,\" said Frank.  \"So it is.  It is probably a converted liner.\"  \"Well, why haven't some of our cruisers picked it up, sir?\" Jack wanted to know.  \"They've tried hard enough,\""]]]
