The boy carries a watch, and must have some money in his pocket.  He also wears a gold ring.\"  At the mention of jewelry and money the tramps' eyes glistened.  \"If you are tellin' de truth, dis is all right,\" cried Stumpy Nuggs, as he arose and stretched himself.  \"I am telling the truth, and you can easily prove it for yourselves.  Only hurry up, or it will be too late.\"  The two tramps consulted together, and asked a few more questions. Then they agreed to follow Baxter, and do whatever he desired of them, providing they were allowed their fair share of plunder, if there was any.  In the meantime Tom went on in deep thought.  He still held the stone in his hand.  He wished he had a club, but the stick he had formerly picked up had been left at the cottage.  The hall grounds had just come into sight in the dim distance when the boy heard the patter of footsteps behind him.  He turned around, but could see nobody, and at that instant the sounds ceased.  \"Somebody is following me,\" he thought.  \"Can it be the same party I spotted before?\"  An instant later he found himself confronted by two men and a boy, each with a bit of cloth tied over his face, into which two holes had been cut for eyes.  \"Is dat him?\" asked one of the men.  \"Yes,\" answered the boy, in a strangely unnatural voice.  \"Give it to him.\"  All three of the party carried sticks, and they at once fell upon Tom, hitting him over the shoulders and the head.  He did his best to defend himself, and hit Baxter in the arm with the stone, inflicting a wound that made the bully shriek with pain.  \"So it is you, Baxter!\" cried Tom, recognizing the voice.  \"What do you mean by this?\"  \"Knock him down,\" yelled the bully.  \"Don't let him get away from you!\"  Thus urged, the two tramps closed in, and while one caught Tom by the arm, the second tried to pull his feet from under him.  It was a fierce, but unequal struggle, and though the boy struck out right and left, inflicting not a little injury, in the end he found himself on his back, with Stumpy Nuggs sitting on his chest.  \"You rascals, let up,\" he gasped.  \"Do you mean to kill me?\"  \"Lay still, or you'll catch it worse,\" growled Nuggs.  \"Where's dat rope, Longback?\"  A rope had been brought along, and it was quickly produced, and then Tom was rolled over and his hands were bound behind him.  His legs were also bound together in such a fashion that he might walk but not run.  \"Now get up,\" ordered Dan Baxter, with a wicked scowl.  Not caring to remain on the ground, Tom did so.  He noted that the two men with Baxter were tramps, and he came to the conclusion that he had a hard crowd with whom to deal.  \"March!\" went on Baxter, taking Tom by the shoulder.  \"March?  Where to?\"  \"You'll find out fast enough.\"  \"Suppose I refuse.\"  \"You had better not, Tom Rover.  You know I'm not to be trifled with.\"  \"I am not afraid of you,\" answered Tom boldly.  \"You were always a bully, Dan Baxter, and a bully is a coward.\"  \"Is your name Baxter?\" asked asked Stumpy Nuggs, curiously.  \"Never mind what it is,\" growled Baxter.  \"I used ter have a friend wot knowed a feller named Baxter,\" went on the tramp.  \"Me friend's name was Buddy Girk.\"  \"I know your friend,\" cried Tom.  \"He once stole my brother Dick's watch.  He is this boy's father's tool, and both of them are now in jail in Albany for robbery.\"  \"Wot!\" cried Nuggs, in astonishment.  He turned to the other tramp. \"Longback, I reckon we have struck an odd crowd, hey?\"  \"Dat's wot,\" answered Longback.  \"But say, we didn't go through de young gent's pockets yet.\"  \"Wait until we are off the road,\" interrupted Dan Baxter. \"Somebody may come along and make trouble for us.\"  \"Right ye are,\" answered Stumpy Nuggs.  \"Don't let's stay here anudder minit.\"  With Baxter on one side of him, Nuggs on the other, and Longback bringing up the rear, Tom was forced to march along.  Once he resisted, and received a punch in the side that took nearly all of the wind out of him.  He started to cry for help, but his captors threatened if he did this that they would place a gag of dirty cloth in his mouth.  In days gone by Baxter had often visited a deserted dwelling on the lake shore, and to this spot the party now directed their steps. In the dark their course was uncertain, and they made slow progress, so it was after three o'clock in the morning when the dilapidated building was reached.     CHAPTER IX  A DOSE OF TAR AND FEATHERS   \"Make some kind of a light--I can't see a thing,\" said Dan Baxter, as the little party came to a halt in front of a half tumbled down building.  Stumpy Nuggs carried matches, and quickly lit a bit of candle which he produced from one of the pockets of his ragged attire.  They entered the dwelling, forcing Tom to accompany them.  This done they tied the young cadet fast to an iron ring set in the huge old fashion fireplace.  \"Now we'll turn out his pockets,\" said Longback, and this was quickly done.  To the tramps' chagrin Tom carried no watch, but had with him two dollars in money.  \"Now we'll take dat ring,\" said Nuggs, pointing to the article on Tom's little finger.  \"So I have fallen in with a lot of thieves, eh?\" said the boy. \"Well, if you want the ring you can fight for it.\"  \"Shut up!\" roared Dan Baxter, and struck him across the mouth, causing Tom's under lip to bleed.  The boy tried to retaliate, but his bonds held him fast.  While one tramp held his hand the other possessed himself of the ring.  The ring contained an opal of which Tom was very proud, and to part with the article made the young cadet feel pretty bad.  \"You will rue this night's work,\" he muttered.  \"I'll see you in prison for it.\"  \"Don't waste your breath in threatening,\" cried Baxter.  \"All right, Baxter, wait and see.  I'll put you where your father is.\"  The bully's face reddened.  \"Will you shut up, or do you want another crack on the mouth?\"  \"It's only a coward who would strike a person when he is helpless.\"  \"Coward or not, I want you to keep a civil tongue in your head.\"  \"Perhaps you imagine we don't know who tried to wreck the stage,\" went on Tom pointedly.  \"Wreck a stage?  I know nothing of such a thing.\"  \"You know all about it.  And we'll prove it too--when you are under arrest.\"  \"I won't talk to you!\" howled Baxter.  \"Come with me,\" he added to the tramps, and then the three quitted the building, leaving Torn to his reflections, which were dismal enough.  \"I'm in a pickle and no mistake,\" he murmured.  \"What will they do with me next?\"  Hour after hour went by and still Tom was left alone.  In the meantime Baxter had held a long conversation with the tramps and had formed a compact with them, paying them the ten dollars as agreed.  The sun was shining brightly when at last Dan Baxter re-entered the old building.  \"Getting hungry, I suppose,\" he remarked, with a wicked grin.  \"Not particularly so,\" answered Tom coldly.  He was hungry, but he was not going to admit it.  \"I suppose you would like to have your liberty,\" went on the bully.  \"Don't ask superfluous questions, Baxter.  Let us get down to business.  Why did you make me a prisoner, and what are you going to do with me?\"  \"I made you a prisoner because I felt like doing so,\" growled the big youth.  \"And what do you propose to do next?\"  \"Teach you a lesson that you won't forget all your life, Tom Rover.\"  \"Thank you for nothing.\"  \"I haven't forgotten how you and your brothers handled me out in Africa--and here, too, for that matter.\"  \"You deserved what you got, Dan Baxter.  Some persons would have had you sent to prison for your actions.\"  \"Bah!  You don't know what you are talking about.  What were you doing out so late last night?\"  \"None of your business.\"  \"Were you over to the Stanhopes' place?\"  \"Perhaps I was and perhaps I wasn't.\"  \"Don't get mulish.  Remember that you are absolutely in my power.\"  \"And what if I was at the Stanhopes' place?  Haven't I a perfect right to go there?\"  \"Did you meet anybody there?\"  \"Yes, I did.  I met your particular friend, Josiah Crabtree.\"  Baxter's face fell.  \"And what--that is what did you have to say to each other?\"  \"Crabtree tried to rob the widow--and I believe you were outside waiting for him,\" Tom continued suddenly.  \"Nonsense.\"  At this moment Stumpy Nuggs came in.  \"There's a man comin' dis way!\" he said excitedly, \"Wot shall we do?\"  \"A man!\" ejaculated Baxter, in alarm.  \"I'll go out and see if I know him.\"  He left the building with the tramp.  The newcomer was approaching along the gully path.  As he drew closer Baxter recognized Josiah Crabtree.  \"Baxter!\" exclaimed the former teacher, as, he carne up.  \"This is fortunate; I was afraid you had been captured.\"  \"And I was afraid you were in the same box,\" rejoined Baxter.  \"I had a hard time of it to get away.  I got lost in the woods and had to remain out in the cold all night.\"  \"Then you didn't succeed in getting what you wanted, or in seeing Mrs. Stanhope?\"  \"No.  Those confounded Rover boys turned up, and I had to--ahem--leave in a hurry.  But who are these two men?\" and Josiah Crabtree looked apprehensively at the tramps.  \"They are all right, Crabtree.  They helped me do a slick thing last night.\"  \"Ah, and what was that?\"  \"I met Tom Rover on the road and they helped me to capture him.\"  \"Indeed, and where is the--ah--young rascal now?\"  \"A prisoner in the old house yonder.\"  At this information Josiah Crabtree was much astonished, and begged for the particulars of the affair, which were speedily forthcoming.  \"And now you have him a prisoner, what do you propose to do?\" asked the former teacher.  \"I'll soon show you,\" growled Baxter.  \"I'm going to do him up brown--or rather, black.  See here.\"  He led the way back to the gully and pointed to a pot of tar and a brush which rested by it.  \"It is tar!\" cried Crabtree.  \"Exactly.\"  \"And you are--ahem--going to give him a coat of that?\"  \"Yes.  Doesn't he deserve it?\"  \"To be sure he does.  I will assist you,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6071"],["title","The Rover Boys out West; Or, The Search for a Lost Mine (#8)"],["body","the former teacher readily, with a malicious gleam in his fishy eyes.  \"I wish you had all three boys here, to tar them with the same brush.\"  \"One at a time, Crabtree.  We'll fix the others some time later.\"  A fire was started and the pot of tar was hung from a chain caught up between two uprights.  Some of the softening stuff was smeared on the wood which was burning, and this made the blaze more fierce than ever.  Soon the tar was near to the boiling point.   The two tramps had thrown themselves down to watch the proceedings.  \"Yer ought ter have some fedders,\" suggested Longback.  \"I have.  There was an old musty feather bed in the house.  I'm going to use that.\"  Going into the building Dan Baxter brought forth the feathers in question, and placed them close to the pot of tar.  While he was doing this Josiah Crabtree went in to talk to Tom.  Of course the boy was surprised to see the former teacher, who eyed him darkly.  \"So Baxter has caught you,\" began Crabtree.  To this Tom made no answer.  \"I presume you do not like your present position,\" went on the man.  Still no reply.  \"You feel so bad about it that you do not even Wish to talk, is that it?\"  \"No, I was just thinking of what an ugly, black-hearted villain you were, Crabtree,\" aid Tom, looking him full in the face.  \"I don't believe you have a single spark of honor left in you.\"  At this Crabtree's face grew as dark as a thunder cloud.  \"Ha I how dare you address me in this fashion?\" he cried.  \"I know I am taking a great risk, but I cannot help it.\"  \"Do you forget that you and your brothers are solely responsible for my present position?  That but for you I would have married the Widow Stanhope and started one of the finest boys' school in New York State?\"  \"Yes, and you would have made Mrs. Stanhope perfectly miserable, and squandered every dollar that she holds in trust for Dora.\"  \"That is your opinion, and it is worth nothing.\"  \"My opinion is the opinion of everybody that knows you as well as I do.\"  \"You have constantly interfered in the doings of myself and of others, and now you must stand punishment for the same.\"  \"What do you intend to do?\" demanded Tom quickly.  \"I'll show you,\" broke in the voice of Dan Baxter, and he came in, followed by the two tramps.  Soon Tom was released from the fireplace and marched between them out into the open air.  \"How do you like that?\" asked Baxter, as he led the way to the fire.  \"Tar and feathers are fine, aren't they?\"  \"You would tar and feather me?\" asked Tom, and now it must be confessed that he shivered in spite of his efforts to remain calm.  \"Yes, we'll tar and feather you,\" responded Baxter.  \"And lay it on--ahem--thick, Daniel,\" put in Josiah Crabtree.  \"Trust me for that.\"  Baxter gave a signal to the two tramps and they began to literally rip Tom's clothing from his back.  Soon the unfortunate youth was stripped to the waist.  Then Baxter caught up, a brush full of tar and advanced upon him.     CHAPTER X  IN THE NICK OF TIME   \"Baxter, don't you dare to tar me!\" cried Tom, as the bully faced him.  \"Ha! ha!  I guess you are pretty well scared now,\" laughed Baxter. \"Your former show of bravery was all put on.\"  \"If you go ahead you shall suffer the full penalty for the outrage, mark my words.\"  \"Bah, Tom Rover, you can't frighten me.  When I get through with you I'll warrant that your own mother won't know you.\"  Tom tried to retreat, but each of the tramps held him by the arm, so that he could not stir.  As his legs were still bound, kicking was likewise out of the question.  \"Let me put a nice big cross on his breast first,\" said Baxter. \"Here goes!\"  He reached out with the brush, but before he could touch Tom an interruption came as forceful as it was unexpected.  A thick stick came flying through the air, hitting his arm and sending the tar brush spinning to a distance.  \"You rascal, let Tom alone!\" came in Dick Rover's voice, and he rushed in and threw the bully headlong.  \"Dick!  Sam!\" came from Tom joyfully.  \"Oh, how glad I am that you have come.\"  \"Wot's dis!\" gasped Stumpy Nuggs.  \"Longback, dare's trouble ahead!\"  \"Yes, an' I don't intend ter be in it!\" answered the second tramp. \"I reckon we've got about all we want out of dis crowd, anyway!\" And both tramps took to their heels.  Josiah Crabtree stood by, speechless.  The interruption had come so suddenly that he knew not what to do.  As quickly as he could Dan Baxter scrambled to his feet.  As he did so Sam leaped for the tar brush and secured it.  \"Let me alone!\" roared the bully, and began to back away.  But as he did so his hand went into his hip pocket and he drew a pistol.  \"No, you don't!\" cried Sam, and knocked the weapon from his hand with the brush.  This action caused the hot tar to leave a heavy streak over Baxter's face and neck, and he let out a yell that would have done credit to an Indian on the warpath.  \"Wait, I'll get even for this, Sam Rover!\" he hissed, and then as Dick advanced he turned and took to his heels, running as if the Evil One were after him.  Sam followed him, still swinging the brush, but Dan Baxter was soon lost to sight in the bushes.  Dick now turned to where Josiah Crabtree had been standing.  The former teacher had recovered and was making tracks down the gully toward the lake.  The tramps had disappeared.  He leaped to Tom's side.  \"We must bag some of them, Tom,\" he said, as he whipped out his knife and set his brother free.  \"There goes Crabtree--let us collar him.\"  Both boys ran as never before, and came upon the former teacher just as that individual reached the lake shore below the bluff. Tom made a grab and caught him by the coat tails.  \"Let me go!\" snarled Crabtree, and aimed a blow at the cadet's head.  But Tom ducked, and the next instant put out his foot and Crabtree pitched headlong into the lake.  \"Help me!  I'll be drowned!\" spluttered the former teacher, as he came up with his head covered with mud, for the lake at this point was less than five feet deep.  \"Climb out and you'll be all right,\" sang out Dick, and feeling the bottom with his feet, Crabtree looked very sheepish and clambered slowly up the bank.  As he stood before them, all dripping with water and mud, he looked the picture of misery.  \"Boys, this is a--a--sad way in which to treat your former teacher,\" he wailed.  \"Don't talk like that, or I'll be tempted to throw you in again,\" exclaimed Tom.  \"Dick, what will we do with him?\"  \"Hold him until we hear from Sam.\"  They looked up the gully and soon espied the youngest Rover hurrying toward them.  \"Where is Baxter?\" asked Dick.  \"He got away, but not until I had let him have that tar brush right in the neck,\" answered Sam.  \"Hullo, so you have captured old Crabby, eh?  That's good.\"  \"Surely you do not intend to--ahem--keep me a prisoner,\" remarked Josiah Crabtree, in a voice which he tried in vain to steady.  \"That's just what we do intend to do,\" answered Dick.  \"You'll march right to the Cedarville lock-up with us.\"  While Dick and Sam guarded the prisoner, Tom ran back for his torn coat and other garments, and also for the rope.  When he returned Crabtree's hands were bound and the cadets told him to move along. He was searched, and a pistol was taken from him.  Crabtree went along most unwillingly.  Once he refused to budge, but Dick showed the pistol, and that settled his stubbornness, and he went along as willingly as a lamb.  On the outskirts of Cedarville the party met Chief Burger and Detective Trigger.  \"So you have one of them, eh?\" cried the chief.  \"Very good, very good indeed.  Turn him over to me and I will take him straight to headquarters.\"  \"You must be careful that he doesn't get away,\" said Dick.  \"Just so, lad; I will be.  No one ever escaped from me, not much! Come on, sir!\"  And he caught Josiah Crabtree by the arm.  \"This is awful!\" groaned the former teacher.  \"And right here in Cedarville, too, where everybody knows me!\"  \"You should have thought of those things before, Mr. Crabtree,\" said Dick, his heart softening a little, now that he saw the man was beginning to break down.  \"What will my friends, and the profession at large, say?\" and Crabtree shook his head bitterly.  \"You have only yourself to blame,\" put in Tom.  He had not forgotten how Crabtree had threatened him but a short while before.  Suddenly the former teacher's last drop of courage seemed to desert him and, deadly pale, he sank on his knees.  \"Spare me, boys, spare me!  For the sake of my family and my friends, spare me!\" he moaned.  \"I didn't know you had a family,\" put in Sam.  \"My relatives--my poor, dear, distant relatives,\" replied Crabtree, hardly aware of what he was saying.  \"Spare me for their sakes, and I will reward you well.\"  \"The law must take its course, Mr. Crabtree,\" said Dick.  He turned to Chief Burger.  \"Take him, and Tom can go with you, to make the charge for us and for Mrs. Stanhope.  I think Detective Trigger had better come with Sam and me to hunt for Dan Baxter.\"  So it was arranged, and soon Crabtree was walking into Cedarville with the chief of police on one side of him and Tom on the other. The sight of a man being placed under arrest was an unusual one, and soon a crowd began to follow the three.  \"It's Mr. Crabtree that used to teach at Putnam Hall,\" said one. \"My, but ain't he a sight.\"  \"Must have tried to get away by jumping into the lake,\" suggested another.  \"What's he arrested for?\" asked a third.  Nobody in the crowd knew, and consequently all followed to the police headquarters.  Here Chief Burger, who also acted as justice of police, took down Tom's charge against the former teacher.  \"Breaking in and trying to steal,\" said Tom.  \"It's not so!\" cried Crabtree.  \"Boy, this is--ahem--infamous!  I never stole a thing in my life!\"  \"We will prove it when your trial comes off,\" answered Tom coolly.  \"Let us--ahem--try to patch this thing up,\" went on Josiah Crabtree.  \"Chief, will you kindly send for Mrs. Stanhope?  I am"]]]
