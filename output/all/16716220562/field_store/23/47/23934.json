Had it borne any other signature, he would have been greatly alarmed--but signed by Arsène Lupin!  As an habitual reader of the newspapers, he was versed in the history of recent crimes, and was therefore well acquainted with the exploits of the mysterious burglar. Of course, he knew that Lupin had been arrested in America by his enemy Ganimard and was at present incarcerated in the Prison de la Santé. But he knew also that any miracle might be expected from Arsène Lupin. Moreover, that exact knowledge of the castle, the location of the pictures and furniture, gave the affair an alarming aspect. How could he have acquired that information concerning things that no one had ever seen?  The baron raised his eyes and contemplated the stern outlines of the castle, its steep rocky pedestal, the depth of the surrounding water, and shrugged his shoulders. Certainly, there was no danger. No one in the world could force an entrance to the sanctuary that contained his priceless treasures.  No one, perhaps, but Arsène Lupin! For him, gates, walls and drawbridges did not exist. What use were the most formidable obstacles or the most careful precautions, if Arsène Lupin had decided to effect an entrance?  That evening, he wrote to the Procurer of the Republique at Rouen. He enclosed the threatening letter and solicited aid and protection.  The reply came at once to the effect that Arsène Lupin was in custody in the Prison de la Santé, under close surveillance, with no opportunity to write such a letter, which was, no doubt, the work of some imposter. But, as an act of precaution, the Procurer had submitted the letter to an expert in handwriting, who declared that, in spite of certain resemblances, the writing was not that of the prisoner.  But the words “in spite of certain resemblances” caught the attention of the baron; in them, he read the possibility of a doubt which appeared to him quite sufficient to warrant the intervention of the law. His fears increased. He read Lupin’s letter over and over again. “I shall be obliged to remove them myself.” And then there was the fixed date: the night of 27 September.  To confide in his servants was a proceeding repugnant to his nature; but now, for the first time in many years, he experienced the necessity of seeking counsel with some one. Abandoned by the legal official of his own district, and feeling unable to defend himself with his own resources, he was on the point of going to Paris to engage the services of a detective.  Two days passed; on the third day, he was filled with hope and joy as he read the following item in the ‘Reveil de Caudebec’, a newspaper published in a neighboring town:  “We have the pleasure of entertaining in our city, at the present time, the veteran detective Mon. Ganimard who acquired a world-wide reputation by his clever capture of Arsène Lupin. He has come here for rest and recreation, and, being an enthusiastic fisherman, he threatens to capture all the fish in our river.”  Ganimard! Ah, here is the assistance desired by Baron Cahorn! Who could baffle the schemes of Arsène Lupin better than Ganimard, the patient and astute detective? He was the man for the place.  The baron did not hesitate. The town of Caudebec was only six kilometers from the castle, a short distance to a man whose step was accelerated by the hope of safety.  After several fruitless attempts to ascertain the detective’s address, the baron visited the office of the ‘Reveil,’ situated on the quai. There he found the writer of the article who, approaching the window, exclaimed:  “Ganimard? Why, you are sure to see him somewhere on the quai with his fishing-pole. I met him there and chanced to read his name engraved on his rod. Ah, there he is now, under the trees.”  “That little man, wearing a straw hat?”  “Exactly. He is a gruff fellow, with little to say.”  Five minutes later, the baron approached the celebrated Ganimard, introduced himself, and sought to commence a conversation, but that was a failure. Then he broached the real object of his interview, and briefly stated his case. The other listened, motionless, with his attention riveted on his fishing-rod. When the baron had finished his story, the fisherman turned, with an air of profound pity, and said:  “Monsieur, it is not customary for thieves to warn people they are about to rob. Arsène Lupin, especially, would not commit such a folly.”  “But---”  “Monsieur, if I had the least doubt, believe me, the pleasure of again capturing Arsène Lupin would place me at your disposal. But, unfortunately, that young man is already under lock and key.”  “He may have escaped.”  “No one ever escaped from the Santé.”  “But, he---”  “He, no more than any other.”  “Yet---”  “Well, if he escapes, so much the better. I will catch him again. Meanwhile, you go home and sleep soundly. That will do for the present. You frighten the fish.”  The conversation was ended. The baron returned to the castle, reassured to some extent by Ganimard’s indifference. He examined the bolts, watched the servants, and, during the next forty-eight hours, he became almost persuaded that his fears were groundless. Certainly, as Ganimard had said, thieves do not warn people they are about to rob.  The fateful day was close at hand. It was now the twenty-sixth of September and nothing had happened. But at three o’clock the bell rang. A boy brought this telegram:  “No goods at Batignolles station. Prepare everything for tomorrow night. Arsène.”  This telegram threw the baron into such a state of excitement that he even considered the advisability of yielding to Lupin’s demands.  However, he hastened to Caudebec. Ganimard was fishing at the same place, seated on a campstool. Without a word, he handed him the telegram.  “Well, what of it?” said the detective.  “What of it? But it is tomorrow.”  “What is tomorrow?”  “The robbery! The pillage of my collections!”  Ganimard laid down his fishing-rod, turned to the baron, and exclaimed, in a tone of impatience:  “Ah! Do you think I am going to bother myself about such a silly story as that!”  “How much do you ask to pass tomorrow night in the castle?”  “Not a sou. Now, leave me alone.”  “Name your own price. I am rich and can pay it.”  This offer disconcerted Ganimard, who replied, calmly:  “I am here on a vacation. I have no right to undertake such work.”  “No one will know. I promise to keep it secret.”  “Oh! nothing will happen.”  “Come! three thousand francs. Will that be enough?”  The detective, after a moment’s reflection, said:  “Very well. But I must warn you that you are throwing your money out of the window.”  “I do not care.”  “In that case... but, after all, what do we know about this devil Lupin! He may have quite a numerous band of robbers with him. Are you sure of your servants?”  “My faith---”  “Better not count on them. I will telegraph for two of my men to help me. And now, go! It is better for us not to be seen together. Tomorrow evening about nine o’clock.”  * * * * *  The following day--the date fixed by Arsène Lupin--Baron Cahorn arranged all his panoply of war, furbished his weapons, and, like a sentinel, paced to and fro in front of the castle. He saw nothing, heard nothing. At half-past eight o’clock in the evening, he dismissed his servants. They occupied rooms in a wing of the building, in a retired spot, well removed from the main portion of the castle. Shortly thereafter, the baron heard the sound of approaching footsteps. It was Ganimard and his two assistants--great, powerful fellows with immense hands, and necks like bulls. After asking a few questions relating to the location of the various entrances and rooms, Ganimard carefully closed and barricaded all the doors and windows through which one could gain access to the threatened rooms. He inspected the walls, raised the tapestries, and finally installed his assistants in the central gallery which was located between the two salons.  “No nonsense! We are not here to sleep. At the slightest sound, open the windows of the court and call me. Pay attention also to the water-side. Ten metres of perpendicular rock is no obstacle to those devils.”  Ganimard locked his assistants in the gallery, carried away the keys, and said to the baron:  “And now, to our post.”  He had chosen for himself a small room located in the thick outer wall, between the two principal doors, and which, in former years, had been the watchman’s quarters. A peep-hole opened upon the bridge; another on the court. In one corner, there was an opening to a tunnel.  “I believe you told me, Monsieur le Baron, that this tunnel is the only subterranean entrance to the castle and that it has been closed up for time immemorial?”  “Yes.”  “Then, unless there is some other entrance, known only to Arsène Lupin, we are quite safe.”  He placed three chairs together, stretched himself upon them, lighted his pipe and sighed:  “Really, Monsieur le Baron, I feel ashamed to accept your money for such a sinecure as this. I will tell the story to my friend Lupin. He will enjoy it immensely.”  The baron did not laugh. He was anxiously listening, but heard nothing save the beating of his own heart. From time to time, he leaned over the tunnel and cast a fearful eye into its depths. He heard the clock strike eleven, twelve, one.  Suddenly, he seized Ganimard’s arm. The latter leaped up, awakened from his sleep.  “Do you hear?” asked the baron, in a whisper.  “Yes.”  “What is it?”  “I was snoring, I suppose.”  “No, no, listen.”  “Ah! yes, it is the horn of an automobile.”  “Well?”  “Well! it is very improbable that Lupin would use an automobile like a battering-ram to demolish your castle. Come, Monsieur le Baron, return to your post. I am going to sleep. Good-night.”  That was the only alarm. Ganimard resumed his interrupted slumbers, and the baron heard nothing except the regular snoring of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6133"],["title","The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsene Lupin, Gentleman-Burglar (#4)"],["body","mpanion. At break of day, they left the room. The castle was enveloped in a profound calm; it was a peaceful dawn on the bosom of a tranquil river. They mounted the stairs, Cahorn radiant with joy, Ganimard calm as usual. They heard no sound; they saw nothing to arouse suspicion.  “What did I tell you, Monsieur le Baron? Really, I should not have accepted your offer. I am ashamed.”  He unlocked the door and entered the gallery. Upon two chairs, with drooping heads and pendent arms, the detective’s two assistants were asleep.  “Tonnerre de nom d’un chien!” exclaimed Ganimard. At the same moment, the baron cried out:  “The pictures! The credence!”  He stammered, choked, with arms outstretched toward the empty places, toward the denuded walls where naught remained but the useless nails and cords. The Watteau, disappeared! The Rubens, carried away! The tapestries taken down! The cabinets, despoiled of their jewels!  “And my Louis XVI candelabra! And the Regent chandelier!...And my twelfth-century Virgin!”  He ran from one spot to another in wildest despair. He recalled the purchase price of each article, added up the figures, counted his losses, pell-mell, in confused words and unfinished phrases. He stamped with rage; he groaned with grief. He acted like a ruined man whose only hope is suicide.  If anything could have consoled him, it would have been the stupefaction displayed by Ganimard. The famous detective did not move. He appeared to be petrified; he examined the room in a listless manner. The windows?.... closed. The locks on the doors?.... intact. Not a break in the ceiling; not a hole in the floor. Everything was in perfect order. The theft had been carried out methodically, according to a logical and inexorable plan.  “Arsène Lupin....Arsène Lupin,” he muttered.  Suddenly, as if moved by anger, he rushed upon his two assistants and shook them violently. They did not awaken.  “The devil!” he cried. “Can it be possible?”  He leaned over them and, in turn, examined them closely. They were asleep; but their response was unnatural.  “They have been drugged,” he said to the baron.  “By whom?”  “By him, of course, or his men under his discretion. That work bears his stamp.”  “In that case, I am lost--nothing can be done.”  “Nothing,” assented Ganimard.  “It is dreadful; it is monstrous.”  “Lodge a complaint.”  “What good will that do?”  “Oh; it is well to try it. The law has some resources.”  “The law! Bah! it is useless. You represent the law, and, at this moment, when you should be looking for a clue and trying to discover something, you do not even stir.”  “Discover something with Arsène Lupin! Why, my dear monsieur, Arsène Lupin never leaves any clue behind him. He leaves nothing to chance. Sometimes I think he put himself in my way and simply allowed me to arrest him in America.”  “Then, I must renounce my pictures! He has taken the gems of my collection. I would give a fortune to recover them. If there is no other way, let him name his own price.”  Ganimard regarded the baron attentively, as he said:  “Now, that is sensible. Will you stick to it?”  “Yes, yes. But why?”  “An idea that I have.”  “What is it?”  “We will discuss it later--if the official examination does not succeed. But, not one word about me, if you wish my assistance.”  He added, between his teeth:  “It is true I have nothing to boast of in this affair.”  The assistants were gradually regaining consciousness with the bewildered air of people who come out of an hypnotic sleep. They opened their eyes and looked about them in astonishment. Ganimard questioned them; they remembered nothing.  “But you must have seen some one?”  “No.”  “Can’t you remember?”  “No, no.”  “Did you drink anything?”  They considered a moment, and then one of them replied:  “Yes, I drank a little water.”  “Out of that carafe?”  “Yes.”  “So did I,” declared the other.  Ganimard smelled and tasted it. It had no particular taste and no odor.  “Come,” he said, “we are wasting our time here. One can’t decide an Arsène Lupin problem in five minutes. But, morbleau! I swear I will catch him again.”  The same day, a charge of burglary was duly performed by Baron Cahorn against Arsène Lupin, a prisoner in the Prison de la Santé.  * * * * *  The baron afterwards regretted making the charge against Lupin when he saw his castle delivered over to the gendarmes, the procureur, the judge d’instruction, the newspaper reporters and photographers, and a throng of idle curiosity-seekers.  The affair soon became a topic of general discussion, and the name of Arsène Lupin excited the public imagination to such an extent that the newspapers filled their columns with the most fantastic stories of his exploits which found ready credence amongst their readers.  But the letter of Arsène Lupin that was published in the _Echo de France_ (no once ever knew how the newspaper obtained it), that letter in which Baron Cahorn was impudently warned of the coming theft, caused considerable excitement. The most fabulous theories were advanced. Some recalled the existence of the famous subterranean tunnels, and that was the line of research pursued by the officers of the law, who searched the house from top to bottom, questioned every stone, studied the wainscoting and the chimneys, the window-frames and the girders in the ceilings. By the light of torches, they examined the immense cellars where the lords of Malaquis were wont to store their munitions and provisions. They sounded the rocky foundation to its very centre. But it was all in vain. They discovered no trace of a subterranean tunnel. No secret passage existed.  But the eager public declared that the pictures and furniture could not vanish like so many ghosts. They are substantial, material things and require doors and windows for their exits and their entrances, and so do the people that remove them. Who were those people? How did they gain access to the castle? And how did they leave it?  The police officers of Rouen, convinced of their own impotence, solicited the assistance of the Parisian detective force. Mon. Dudouis, chief of the Sûreté, sent the best sleuths of the iron brigade. He himself spent forty-eight hours at the castle, but met with no success. Then he sent for Ganimard, whose past services had proved so useful when all else failed.  Ganimard listened, in silence, to the instructions of his superior; then, shaking his head, he said:  “In my opinion, it is useless to ransack the castle. The solution of the problem lies elsewhere.”  “Where, then?”  “With Arsène Lupin.”  “With Arsène Lupin! To support that theory, we must admit his intervention.”  “I do admit it. In fact, I consider it quite certain.”  “Come, Ganimard, that is absurd. Arsène Lupin is in prison.”  “I grant you that Arsène Lupin is in prison, closely guarded; but he must have fetters on his feet, manacles on his wrists, and gag in his mouth before I change my opinion.”  “Why so obstinate, Ganimard?”  “Because Arsène Lupin is the only man in France of sufficient calibre to invent and carry out a scheme of that magnitude.”  “Mere words, Ganimard.”  “But true ones. Look! What are they doing? Searching for subterranean passages, stones swinging on pivots, and other nonsense of that kind. But Lupin doesn’t employ such old-fashioned methods. He is a modern cracksman, right up to date.”  “And how would you proceed?”  “I should ask your permission to spend an hour with him.”  “In his cell?”  “Yes. During the return trip from America we became very friendly, and I venture to say that if he can give me any information without compromising himself he will not hesitate to save me from incurring useless trouble.”  It was shortly after noon when Ganimard entered the cell of Arsène Lupin. The latter, who was lying on his bed, raised his head and uttered a cry of apparent joy.  “Ah! This is a real surprise. My dear Ganimard, here!”  “Ganimard himself.”  “In my chosen retreat, I have felt a desire for many things, but my fondest wish was to receive you here.”  “Very kind of you, I am sure.”  “Not at all. You know I hold you in the highest regard.”  “I am proud of it.”  “I have always said: Ganimard is our best detective. He is almost,--you see how candid I am!--he is almost as clever as Sherlock Holmes. But I am sorry that I cannot offer you anything better than this hard stool. And no refreshments! Not even a glass of beer! Of course, you will excuse me, as I am here only temporarily.”  Ganimard smiled, and accepted the proffered seat. Then the prisoner continued:  “Mon Dieu, how pleased I am to see the face of an honest man. I am so tired of those devils of spies who come here ten times a day to ransack my pockets and my cell to satisfy themselves that I am not preparing to escape. The government is very solicitous on my account.”  “It is quite right.”  “Why so? I should be quite contented if they would allow me to live in my own quiet way.”  “On other people’s money.”  “Quite so. That would be so simple. But here, I am joking, and you are, no doubt, in a hurry. So let us come to business, Ganimard. To what do I owe the honor of this visit?  “The Cahorn affair,” declared Ganimard, frankly.  “Ah! Wait, one moment. You see I have had so many affairs! First, let me fix in my mind the circumstances of this particular case....Ah! yes, now I have it. The Cahorn affair, Malaquis castle, Seine-Inférieure....Two Rubens, a Watteau, and a few trifling articles.”  “Trifling!”  “Oh! ma foi, all that is of slight importance. But it suffices to know that the affair interests you. How can I serve you, Ganimard?”  “Must I explain to you what steps the authorities have taken in the matter?”  “Not at all. I have read the newspapers and I will frankly state that you have made very little progress.”  “And that is the reason I have come to see you.”  “I am entirely at your service.”  “In the first place, the Cahorn affair was managed by you?”  “From A to Z.”  “The letter of warning? the telegram?”  “All "]]]
