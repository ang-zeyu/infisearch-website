I could have shot the Mahar with ease, for I knew intuitively that she was escaping--but I did not.  I felt that if she could return to her own kind with the story of her adventures, the position of the human race within Pellucidar would be advanced immensely at a single stride, for at once man would take his proper place in the considerations of the reptilia.  At the edge of the sea the creature paused and looked back at me.  Then she slid sinuously into the surf.  For several minutes I saw no more of her as she luxuriated in the cool depths.  Then a hundred yards from shore she rose and there for another short while she floated upon the surface.  Finally she spread her giant wings, flapped them vigorously a score of times and rose above the blue sea.  A single time she circled far aloft--and then straight as an arrow she sped away.  I watched her until the distant haze enveloped her and she had disappeared.  I was alone.  My first concern was to discover where within Pellucidar I might be-and in what direction lay the land of the Sarians where Ghak the Hairy One ruled.  But how was I to guess in which direction lay Sari?  And if I set out to search--what then?  Could I find my way back to the prospector with its priceless freight of books, firearms, ammunition, scientific instruments, and still more books--its great library of reference works upon every conceivable branch of applied sciences?  And if I could not, of what value was all this vast storehouse of potential civilization and progress to be to the world of my adoption?  Upon the other hand, if I remained here alone with it, what could I accomplish single-handed?  Nothing.  But where there was no east, no west, no north, no south, no stars, no moon, and only a stationary midday sun, how was I to find my way back to this spot should ever I get out of sight of it?  I didn't know.  For a long time I stood buried in deep thought, when it occurred to me to try out one of the compasses I had brought and ascertain if it remained steadily fixed upon an unvarying pole.  I reentered the prospector and fetched a compass without.  Moving a considerable distance from the prospector that the needle might not be influenced by its great bulk of iron and steel I turned the delicate instrument about in every direction.  Always and steadily the needle remained rigidly fixed upon a point straight out to sea, apparently pointing toward a large island some ten or twenty miles distant.  This then should be north.  I drew my note-book from my pocket and made a careful topographical sketch of the locality within the range of my vision.  Due north lay the island, far out upon the shimmering sea.  The spot I had chosen for my observations was the top of a large, flat boulder which rose six or eight feet above the turf.  This spot I called Greenwich.  The boulder was the \"Royal Observatory.\"  I had made a start! I cannot tell you what a sense of relief was imparted to me by the simple fact that there was at least one spot within Pellucidar with a familiar name and a place upon a map.  It was with almost childish joy that I made a little circle in my note-book and traced the word Greenwich beside it.  Now I felt I might start out upon my search with some assurance of finding my way back again to the prospector.  I decided that at first I would travel directly south in the hope that I might in that direction find some familiar landmark.  It was as good a direction as any.  This much at least might be said of it.  Among the many other things I had brought from the outer world were a number of pedometers.  I slipped three of these into my pockets with the idea that I might arrive at a more or less accurate mean from the registrations of them all.  On my map I would register so many paces south, so many east, so many west, and so on.  When I was ready to return I would then do so by any route that I might choose.  I also strapped a considerable quantity of ammunition across my shoulders, pocketed some matches, and hooked an aluminum fry-pan and a small stew-kettle of the same metal to my belt.  I was ready--ready to go forth and explore a world!  Ready to search a land area of 124,110,000 square miles for my friends, my incomparable mate, and good old Perry!  And so, after locking the door in the outer shell of the prospector, I set out upon my quest.  Due south I traveled, across lovely valleys thick-dotted with grazing herds.  Through dense primeval forests I forced my way and up the slopes of mighty mountains searching for a pass to their farther sides.  Ibex and musk-sheep fell before my good old revolver, so that I lacked not for food in the higher altitudes.  The forests and the plains gave plentifully of fruits and wild birds, antelope, aurochsen, and elk.  Occasionally, for the larger game animals and the gigantic beasts of prey, I used my express rifle, but for the most part the revolver filled all my needs.  There were times, too, when faced by a mighty cave bear, a saber-toothed tiger, or huge felis spelaea, black-maned and terrible, even my powerful rifle seemed pitifully inadequate--but fortune favored me so that I passed unscathed through adventures that even the recollection of causes the short hairs to bristle at the nape of my neck.  How long I wandered toward the south I do not know, for shortly after I left the prospector something went wrong with my watch, and I was again at the mercy of the baffling timelessness of Pellucidar, forging steadily ahead beneath the great, motionless sun which hangs eternally at noon.  I ate many times, however, so that days must have elapsed, possibly months with no familiar landscape rewarding my eager eyes.  I saw no men nor signs of men.  Nor is this strange, for Pellucidar, in its land area, is immense, while the human race there is very young and consequently far from numerous.  Doubtless upon that long search mine was the first human foot to touch the soil in many places--mine the first human eye to rest upon the gorgeous wonders of the landscape.  It was a staggering thought.  I could not but dwell upon it often as I made my lonely way through this virgin world.  Then, quite suddenly, one day I stepped out of the peace of manless primality into the presence of man--and peace was gone.  It happened thus:  I had been following a ravine downward out of a chain of lofty hills and had paused at its mouth to view the lovely little valley that lay before me.  At one side was tangled wood, while straight ahead a river wound peacefully along parallel to the cliffs in which the hills terminated at the valley's edge.  Presently, as I stood enjoying the lovely scene, as insatiate for Nature's wonders as if I had not looked upon similar landscapes countless times, a sound of shouting broke from the direction of the woods.  That the harsh, discordant notes rose from the throats of men I could not doubt.  I slipped behind a large boulder near the mouth of the ravine and waited.  I could hear the crashing of underbrush in the forest, and I guessed that whoever came came quickly--pursued and pursuers, doubtless.  In a short time some hunted animal would break into view, and a moment later a score of half-naked savages would come leaping after with spears or club or great stone-knives.  I had seen the thing so many times during my life within Pellucidar that I felt that I could anticipate to a nicety precisely what I was about to witness.  I hoped that the hunters would prove friendly and be able to direct me toward Sari.  Even as I was thinking these thoughts the quarry emerged from the forest.  But it was no terrified four-footed beast.  Instead, what I saw was an old man--a terrified old man!  Staggering feebly and hopelessly from what must have been some very terrible fate, if one could judge from the horrified expressions he continually cast behind him toward the wood, he came stumbling on in my direction.  He had covered but a short distance from the forest when I beheld the first of his pursuers--a Sagoth, one of those grim and terrible gorilla-men who guard the mighty Mahars in their buried cities, faring forth from time to time upon slave-raiding or punitive expeditions against the human race of Pellucidar, of whom the dominant race of the inner world think as we think of the bison or the wild sheep of our own world.  Close behind the foremost Sagoth came others until a full dozen raced, shouting after the terror-stricken old man.  They would be upon him shortly, that was plain.  One of them was rapidly overhauling him, his back-thrown spear-arm testifying to his purpose.  And then, quite with the suddenness of an unexpected blow, I realized a past familiarity with the gait and carriage of the fugitive.  Simultaneously there swept over me the staggering fact that the old man was--PERRY! That he was about to die before my very eyes with no hope that I could reach him in time to avert the awful catastrophe--for to me it meant a real catastrophe!  Perry was my best friend.  Dian, of course, I looked upon as more than friend.  She was my mate--a part of me.  I had entirely forgotten the rifle in my hand and the revolvers at my belt; one does not readily synchronize his thoughts with the stone age and the twentieth century simultaneously.  Now from past habit I still thought in the stone age, and in my thoughts of the stone age there were no thoughts of firearms.  The fellow was almost upon Perry when the feel of the gun in my hand awoke me from the lethargy of terror that had gripped me.  From behind my boulder I threw up the heavy express rifle--a mighty engine of destruction that might bring down a cave bear or a mammoth at a single shot--and let drive at the Sagoth's broad, hairy breast.  At the sound of the shot he stopped stock-still.  His spear dropped from his hand.  Then he lunged"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/605"],["title","Pellucidar (#3)"],["body","upon his face.  The effect upon the others was little less remarkable.  Perry alone could have possibly guessed the meaning of the loud report or explained its connection with the sudden collapse of the Sagoth.  The other gorilla-men halted for but an instant.  Then with renewed shrieks of rage they sprang forward to finish Perry.  At the same time I stepped from behind my boulder, drawing one of my revolvers that I might conserve the more precious ammunition of the express rifle.  Quickly I fired again with the lesser weapon.  Then it was that all eyes were directed toward me.  Another Sagoth fell to the bullet from the revolver; but it did not stop his companions. They were out for revenge as well as blood now, and they meant to have both.  As I ran forward toward Perry I fired four more shots, dropping three of our antagonists.  Then at last the remaining seven wavered.  It was too much for them, this roaring death that leaped, invisible, upon them from a great distance.  As they hesitated I reached Perry's side.  I have never seen such an expression upon any man's face as that upon Perry's when he recognized me.  I have no words wherewith to describe it.  There was not time to talk then--scarce for a greeting.  I thrust the full, loaded revolver into his hand, fired the last shot in my own, and reloaded.  There were but six Sagoths left then.  They started toward us once more, though I could see that they were terrified probably as much by the noise of the guns as by their effects.  They never reached us.  Half-way the three that remained turned and fled, and we let them go.  The last we saw of them they were disappearing into the tangled undergrowth of the forest.  And then Perry turned and threw his arms about my neck and, burying his old face upon my shoulder, wept like a child.    CHAPTER II  TRAVELING WITH TERROR  We made camp there beside the peaceful river.  There Perry told me all that had befallen him since I had departed for the outer crust.  It seemed that Hooja had made it appear that I had intentionally left Dian behind, and that I did not purpose ever returning to Pellucidar. He told them that I was of another world and that I had tired of this and of its inhabitants.  To Dian he had explained that I had a mate in the world to which I was returning; that I had never intended taking Dian the Beautiful back with me; and that she had seen the last of me.  Shortly afterward Dian had disappeared from the camp, nor had Perry seen or heard aught of her since.  He had no conception of the time that had elapsed since I had departed, but guessed that many years had dragged their slow way into the past.  Hooja, too, had disappeared very soon after Dian had left.  The Sarians, under Ghak the Hairy One, and the Amozites under Dacor the Strong One, Dian's brother, had fallen out over my supposed defection, for Ghak would not believe that I had thus treacherously deceived and deserted them.  The result had been that these two powerful tribes had fallen upon one another with the new weapons that Perry and I had taught them to make and to use.  Other tribes of the new federation took sides with the original disputants or set up petty revolutions of their own.  The result was the total demolition of the work we had so well started.  Taking advantage of the tribal war, the Mahars had gathered their Sagoths in force and fallen upon one tribe after another in rapid succession, wreaking awful havoc among them and reducing them for the most part to as pitiable a state of terror as that from which we had raised them.  Alone of all the once-mighty federation the Sarians and the Amozites with a few other tribes continued to maintain their defiance of the Mahars; but these tribes were still divided among themselves, nor had it seemed at all probable to Perry when he had last been among them that any attempt at re-amalgamation would be made.  \"And thus, your majesty,\" he concluded, \"has faded back into the oblivion of the Stone Age our wondrous dream and with it has gone the First Empire of Pellucidar.\"  We both had to smile at the use of my royal title, yet I was indeed still \"Emperor of Pellucidar,\" and some day I meant to rebuild what the vile act of the treacherous Hooja had torn down.  But first I would find my empress.  To me she was worth forty empires.  \"Have you no clue as to the whereabouts of Dian?\" I asked.  \"None whatever,\" replied Perry.  \"It was in search of her that I came to the pretty pass in which you discovered me, and from which, David, you saved me.  \"I knew perfectly well that you had not intentionally deserted either Dian or Pellucidar.  I guessed that in some way Hooja the Sly One was at the bottom of the matter, and I determined to go to Amoz, where I guessed that Dian might come to the protection of her brother, and do my utmost to convince her, and through her Dacor the Strong One, that we had all been victims of a treacherous plot to which you were no party.  \"I came to Amoz after a most trying and terrible journey, only to find that Dian was not among her brother's people and that they knew naught of her whereabouts.  \"Dacor, I am sure, wanted to be fair and just, but so great were his grief and anger over the disappearance of his sister that he could not listen to reason, but kept repeating time and again that only your return to Pellucidar could prove the honesty of your intentions.  \"Then came a stranger from another tribe, sent I am sure at the instigation of Hooja.  He so turned the Amozites against me that I was forced to flee their country to escape assassination.  \"In attempting to return to Sari I became lost, and then the Sagoths discovered me.  For a long time I eluded them, hiding in caves and wading in rivers to throw them off my trail.  \"I lived on nuts and fruits and the edible roots that chance threw in my way.  \"I traveled on and on, in what directions I could not even guess; and at last I could elude them no longer and the end came as I had long foreseen that it would come, except that I had not foreseen that you would be there to save me.\"  We rested in our camp until Perry had regained sufficient strength to travel again.  We planned much, rebuilding all our shattered air-castles; but above all we planned most to find Dian.  I could not believe that she was dead, yet where she might be in this savage world, and under what frightful conditions she might be living, I could not guess.  When Perry was rested we returned to the prospector, where he fitted himself out fully like a civilized human being--under-clothing, socks, shoes, khaki jacket and breeches and good, substantial puttees.  When I had come upon him he was clothed in rough sadak sandals, a gee-string and a tunic fashioned from the shaggy hide of a thag.  Now he wore real clothing again for the first time since the ape-folk had stripped us of our apparel that long-gone day that had witnessed our advent within Pellucidar.  With a bandoleer of cartridges across his shoulder, two six-shooters at his hips, and a rifle in his hand he was a much rejuvenated Perry.  Indeed he was quite a different person altogether from the rather shaky old man who had entered the prospector with me ten or eleven years before, for the trial trip that had plunged us into such wondrous adventures and into such a strange and hitherto undreamed-of-world.  Now he was straight and active.  His muscles, almost atrophied from disuse in his former life, had filled out.  He was still an old man of course, but instead of appearing ten years older than he really was, as he had when we left the outer world, he now appeared about ten years younger.  The wild, free life of Pellucidar had worked wonders for him.  Well, it must need have done so or killed him, for a man of Perry's former physical condition could not long have survived the dangers and rigors of the primitive life of the inner world.  Perry had been greatly interested in my map and in the \"royal observatory\" at Greenwich.  By use of the pedometers we had retraced our way to the prospector with ease and accuracy.  Now that we were ready to set out again we decided to follow a different route on the chance that it might lead us into more familiar territory.  I shall not weary you with a repetition of the countless adventures of our long search.  Encounters with wild beasts of gigantic size were of almost daily occurrence; but with our deadly express rifles we ran comparatively little risk when one recalls that previously we had both traversed this world of frightful dangers inadequately armed with crude, primitive weapons and all but naked.  We ate and slept many times--so many that we lost count--and so I do not know how long we roamed, though our map shows the distances and directions quite accurately.  We must have covered a great many thousand square miles of territory, and yet we had seen nothing in the way of a familiar landmark, when from the heights of a mountain-range we were crossing I descried far in the distance great masses of billowing clouds.  Now clouds are practically unknown in the skies of Pellucidar.  The moment that my eyes rested upon them my heart leaped.  I seized Perry's arm and, pointing toward the horizonless distance, shouted:  \"The Mountains of the Clouds!\"  \"They lie close to Phutra, and the country of our worst enemies, the Mahars,\" Perry remonstrated.  \"I know it,\" I replied, \"but they give us a starting-point from which to prosecute our search intelligently.  They are at least a familiar landmark.  \"They tell us that we are upon the right trail and not wandering far in the wrong direction.  \"Furthermore, close to the Mountains of the Clouds dwells a good friend, Ja the Mezop.  You did not know him, but you know all that he did for me and all that he will gladly do to aid me.  \"At least he can direct us upon the right direction toward Sari.\"  \"The Mountains of the Clouds constitute a mighty range,\" replied Perry. \"They must cover an enormous"]]]
