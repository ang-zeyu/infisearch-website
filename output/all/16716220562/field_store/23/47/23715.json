Joseph, born December 23rd, 1805, at Sharon, Vermont.  Samuel, born March 13th, 1808, at Tunbridge, Vermont.  Ephraim, born March 13th, 1810, at Royalton, Vermont.  William, born March 13th, 1811, at Royalton, Vermont.  Catherine, born July 8th, 1812, at Lebanon, New Hampshire.  Don Carlos, born March 25th, 1816, probably at Palmyra, New York.  Lucy, born July 18th, 1821, probably at Palmyra, New York.  The first quarter of the nineteenth century was a time of intense religious excitement, and New York and surrounding states were the scenes of many revivals and much strife. Not only among preachers and exhorters was the enthusiasm manifested, but the people themselves became much exercised over their sinful condition, and ran here and there in a wild search for the salvation for which their souls seemed to yearn. The movement originated with the Methodists; but it soon spread to other sects in the neighborhood, until the whole region was infected by it, and the greatest excitement was created, in which all the good effects of a revival were swallowed up in bitter contests of opinions and the strife of words between the adherents of the various creeds.  The Smith family inclined towards the Presbyterian faith, and the mother, two sons and a daughter united themselves with that church. Joseph was at the time in his fifteenth year--just at an age, with his limited experience, he might be deemed most susceptible to the example of others. He listened and considered, yet could not profess the faith of his family. The clergymen of other sects assailed him; but although he became somewhat partial to the Methodist creed, their soft words and direful threats were alike unavailing. The tempest could not reach the depths of the boy's nature. Unknown to himself he was awaiting the hour when the divine message should stir the waters of his soul.  Footnotes  1. See NOTE 1., APPENDIX.    CHAPTER III.  LIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURES--THE PRAYER AND ITS ANSWER--\"THIS IS MY BELOVED SON: HEAR HIM\"--PERSECUTION AND SCOFFING OF THE MULTITUDE-- JOSEPH DOUBTS HIMSELF AND SUPPLICATES FOR RENEWED HELP.  Joseph was earnest beyond his years; but he was not of a nature to become a prey to morbid feelings. He was neither terrified by the awful threats of the revivalists into a ready acceptance of their dogmas, nor driven by their divisions and strife into unbelief in revealed religion. The all-absorbing question with him was: Which of these churches is the church of Christ? Under the influence of his great desire to know the truth and the correct path which led to salvation, he made a thoughtful analysis of the proffered creeds. Can it be wondered at that he was bewildered in the labyrinth of paths, each of which claimed to be the heavenly way? When at divers times he thought of uniting himself with some one of the churches, his further investigation each time revealed some false mysteries. Dissatisfied with their claims and pretensions, and conscious of his own want of knowledge and how easily he might err in a matter of such vital and eternal importance, he was led to seek for guidance from a righteous source. He had recourse to the word of God.  Searching the scriptures for comfort and light, one happy and most fortunate moment he read these sacred words:  \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"  Like a flash of sunlight through lowering clouds, the import of a mighty truth burst upon Joseph's mind. He had been vainly asking help from men who had answered him out of their own darkness. He determined now to seek assistance from God. A modest fear might suggest: Who was he that he should dare to approach the great Creator's throne? But there was the plain promise. He could not doubt it, without doubting his Maker. He felt that he lacked wisdom; and to such as he, asking of God, there was the divine pledge to hear and give without upbraiding.  It was one morning in early springtime of the year 1820, that Joseph felt the earnest prompting and adopted the holy resolve. He walked into the depths of a wood, which stood near his home, and sought a little glade. There, in trembling humility, but with a faith which thrilled his soul--alone, unseen of man, he fell upon his knees and lifted his voice in prayer to God. While he was calling upon the Almighty, a subtle and malignant power seized him and stilled his utterance. Deep darkness enveloped him; he felt that he was in the grasp of Satan, and that the destroyer was exerting all the power of hell to drag him to sudden destruction. In his agony he called anew upon the Lord for deliverance; and at the moment when he seemed to be sinking under the power of the evil one, the deep gloom was rolled away and he saw a brilliant light. A pillar of celestial fire, far more glorious than the brightness of the noon-day sun, appeared directly above him. The defeated power fled with the darkness; and Joseph's spirit was free to worship and marvel at his deliverance. Gradually the light descended until it rested upon him; and he saw, standing above him in the air, enveloped in the pure radiance of the fiery pillar, two personages of incomparable beauty, alike in form and feature, and clad alike in snowy raiment. Sublime, dazzling, they filled his soul with awe. At length, One, calling Joseph by name, stretched His shining arm towards the other, and said:  \"THIS IS MY BELOVED SON: HEAR HIM!\"  As soon as Joseph could regain possession of himself, to which he was encouraged by the benign and comforting look of the Son, and by the heavenly bliss which pervaded his own soul, he found words to ask, which of all the multitude of churches upon the face of the globe had the gospel of Christ; for up to this time it had never entered his mind to doubt that the true church of the Lamb, pure and undefiled, had an existence somewhere among men. But the answer came that no one of the creeds of earth was pure, and that Joseph must unite himself with none of them. Said the glorious Being: \"THEY DRAW NEAR ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEARTS ARE FAR FROM ME; THEY TEACH FOR THE DOCTRINE THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN, HAVING A FORM OF GODLINESS, BUT THEY DENY THE POWER THEREOF.\"  Even in the transport of his vision, Joseph felt amazed at the instruction. But the Heavenly Personages continued to commune with him, and repeated Their command that he should not ally himself with any of the man-made sects. Then They and Their enclosing pillar of light passed from his gaze, and he was left to look into the immensity of space.  The boy's faith in the promises of God had now deepened into knowledge. He had been assailed by the power of evil, until it seemed he must succumb--that the limit of human endurance was passed. And in that instant of deepest despair, he had been suddenly transported into the blaze of celestial light. He had seen with his own eyes the Father and the Son, with his own ears he had heard Their eternal voice. Over this untaught youth at least, the Heavens were no longer as brass. He had emerged from the maze of doubt and uncertainty in which he had so long groped, and had received positive assurances on the matter nearest his heart from Him, whom to know was anciently declared to be life eternal.  Emboldened, satisfied, and happy beyond expression, Joseph's first thought was of his loved ones. He must impart the glorious truth to them. His parents and his brethren listened, and were lost in awe at his straightforward recital. He next sought his old friends the ministers, those who had affected such an interest in his welfare and who would nave so willingly acted as his guides toward heaven. His first experience with these gentlemen was somewhat discouraging. A Methodist preacher who had formerly cultivated the utmost friendship, and who probably had acquired considerable influence with him, was soon informed by Joseph of the Heavenly manifestation. The pious man treated the communication with contempt, and curtly replied that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days, they having ceased with the Apostles, and that the whole thing was of the Devil. Other ministers, and in fact the religious portion of the entire neighborhood, as the event became more widely known, united in the determination to overwhelm with ridicule and abuse that which they found themselves unable to silence by argument.  Joseph had been a great favorite among his neighbors, his gentle ways had made him beloved by all; he now was hated and reviled. He had been especially sought after by the clergy because of his diligence, earnestness and humility in striving to secure the grace of God; he now was stigmatized as a dissolute dreamer, a worthless knave and an an arrant hypocrite. A boy of fourteen is seldom the object of universal conversation and comment in his locality; yet this youth's enemies did not rest short of lifting him to an eminence where he could the better be seen and scorned of all men.  His family were made to share the vindictiveness and contumely exhibited toward him which at last reached such a pitch that an attempt was actually made to assassinate him. The family, on hearing the report of the gun, rushed from the house only to find the marks made by the crouching murderer at the side of the path, and the leaden missiles embedded a short distance from the spot.  But persecution, slander and cruel outrage were all unable to change the steadfast testimony of Joseph. Three years passed away, during which time he was true to his trust through toil and poverty, through scorn and tribulation. The heavens no more opened to his view in this trying period; but the youth, who was fast maturing--growing in strength and understanding--was able to show the staunchness of his nature while he waited in patience and humility for the additional light which he had been led to expect.  Yet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59970"],["title","The Life of Joseph Smith, the Prophet (#5)"],["body"," was human, with human loves and human wants. He sorrowed to find himself and his kindred cast off by all their old associates, and he at times was forced into the society of persons who made few or no pretensions to religion.  Doubtless the avowed infidels and unbelievers, whom he thus occasionally met, were no more lacking in genuine purity than were the self-righteous enthusiasts who shunned him except when they could devise some means for persecution and torture. But he had not yet learned to justly weigh the virtues and failings of others; and often he reproached himself with sinfulness because of his enforced associations. His quick conscience was apt to exaggerate every youthful foible, and he regarded many of his acts of thoughtlessness as offenses at which the Heavens must frown.  At last he felt the imperative need of light and help from the source whence flows all truth. He acknowledged that he had fallen into many foolish errors and youthful weaknesses; and he prayed without ceasing for the pardon of every wrong which he had done. He plead earnestly that he might gain greater knowledge for his guidance, and asked for a manifestation, from which he might know concerning his state and standing before the Lord. Despite his own self-accusation, the answer to his prayer proves that his probationary period had been passed satisfactorily to the Heavens and that he was still unstained by any dark offense.    CHAPTER IV.  THE ANGEL MORONI VISITS JOSEPH THRICE IN THE NIGHT--A RECORD TO BE BROUGHT FORTH--VISION OF CUMORAH.  It was on the night of the 21st of September, in the year 1823, that Joseph, having retired to his humble room, invoked an answer to his petition unto the Lord. While lying upon his bed thus seeking with all the power of his spirit, the usual darkness of the room began to fade away and a spreading glory appeared, which increased until the room was lighter than at noonday. In the midst of this light, which was most brilliant around his person, stood a radiant being, whose countenance was more bright than vivid lightning and was marvelously lovely. He seemed of greater stature than an ordinary man and moved and stood without touching the floor. He was clothed in a robe of intense and dazzling whiteness, far exceeding anything of an earthly character; and his hands and wrists and feet and ankles, as well as his head and neck, were bare. The glorious personage stood at Joseph's bedside; and to the awed youth, in a voice of tenderness and comfort, calling Joseph by name, the angel announced himself to be a messenger from the presence of the Almighty, and that his name was Moroni. The holy visitor then proceeded to unfold some of the grand purposes of the Lord. He said that through Joseph, God's power and kingdom were to be restored to earth; that Joseph's name should go out to all nations, kindred and tongues, to be blessed by the pure reviled by the unholy--that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people; that in the fulfillment of this mission, Joseph would be led to a hill, where was buried an ancient record engraved upon plates of gold, which record was a history of the nations that had inhabited the American continent, and furthermore contained the fulness of the Gospel as given during the administration of Jesus on this land. He said that with the plates were hidden two sacred stones, set in a bow of silver fastened to a breastplate, and called Urim and Thummim, by the possession and use of which, men in ancient times had become seers, and by means of which, aided by the inspiration of Heaven, Joseph also would become a seer and be able to read and translate the engraven record.  While the angel was thus speaking, Joseph was enabled in vision to see clearly and distinctly the holy hill and its environs, and the particular spot upon the hillside where the plates were held in silent trust. Moroni resumed his teachings, saying that the hour had not yet come for the translation of the record, but Joseph must prepare his mind by prayer and thought for the exalted duties and blessings which awaited him; and he most solemnly warned the youth, on penalty of sure destruction, against showing the hidden treasures to anyone except by commandment of God. Before taking his leave, the angelic messenger rehearsed much of ancient prophecy relating to the restoration of all holiness, the second coming of our Savior and His dominion upon earth; he explained many scriptural utterances; and of the wicked and unbelieving blasphemies, he spoke in such a sorrowful yet terrible voice that these words seemed to still the beating of the listener's heart:  \"FOR BEHOLD, THE DAY COMETH THAT SHALL BURN AS AN OVEN; AND ALL THE PROUD, YEA AND ALL THAT DO WICKEDLY SHALL BURN AS STUBBLE!\"  Among many commands and promises, Moroni gave this assurance from the Lord to Joseph:  \"BEHOLD, I WILL REVEAL UNTO YOU THE PRIESTHOOD BY THE HAND OF ELIJAH THE PROPHET, BEFORE THE COMING OF THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY OF THE LORD.\"  As the angel ceased to speak, all the light of the room gathered to his person. Above him all earthly things seemed moved away and a shining pillar was stretching heavenward. With a look of hope and blessing upon the youth, Moroni ascended; and when he disappeared, darkness again fell about the bedside.  Powerful emotions crowded upon Joseph's mind as he recalled the things which had been revealed to him. And while he yet pondered, once more Moroni came and stood in a blazing glory and repeated solemnly the heavenly lessons to the listening youth, adding that great judgments were coming upon the earth, and that grievous desolations should be poured out during this present generation.  Again Moroni ascended as before; and yet for the third time he returned to repeat the message of which he was the bearer. The solemn instructions were once more given, and with them a special warning concerning the plates of gold and the sacred stones. He told Joseph that by reason of the poverty of himself and family, Satan would try to tempt him to use them for the purpose of getting rich, and that if he had any other motive than the glory of God, they would be withheld. Many hours had passed in this communion, and when the heavenly ambassador disappeared for the third time, Joseph heard the birds of the air heralding the coming of the dawn.    CHAPTER V.  A MID-DAY VISITATION--JOSEPH CONFIDES IN HIS EARTHLY FATHER--CUMORAH AND THE SACRED BOX--NEW PROBATION IS FIXED--SUCCESSIVE VISITS AND MINISTRATIONS OF THE ANGEL--JOSEPH'S GROWTH IN GODLINESS.  At his usual hour of arising, Joseph left his bed, and according to his custom went to labor in the field. The experiences of the night had swept all color from his face. His mind was filled with thoughts unutterable, and his attention was fixed beyond his earthly toil. His father observed that the boy seemed weak, and acted strangely, and told him to go home. Joseph started from the field towards the house, but on his way, in attempting to cross a fence, he sank helpless to the earth. He was recalled from a partial swoon by a voice which gently spoke his name. He looked up and saw the same glorious messenger standing above his head, clothed about with an effulgence which eclipsed the splendor of the noonday sun.  Once more the angel told the truths of the night before, with their commands and warnings, and he instructed Joseph to return to his father, and impart to him that which he had learned of the purposes of God. He obeyed at once, and standing there in the harvest field, related to his father all that had passed. The inspiration of heaven rested upon the elder Joseph as he heard the lad's words; and when the account was finished, he said \"My son, these things are of God; take heed that you proceed in all holiness to do His will.\"  Having the consent and blessing of his earthly father, Joseph departed to visit the hill. And now, within a few hours of its utterance, was one of the angel's predictions fulfilled. During the journey of two or three miles beyond Manchester toward the hill which had been pointed out to him in vision, Joseph was made to feel within him the striving of two invisible powers. On the one hand, the evil one presented alluring prospects of worldly gain from the possession of the plates of gold--on the other, the better influence whispered that the record was sacred and must only be used for the glory of God and the fulfillment of His purposes. In this frame of mind he approached the spot which he had seen in vision. It was on the west side and near the top of a hill which stood higher than any other in that neighborhood. [1] He easily recognized the exact place which held the holy treasure; and upon reaching it, he saw the rounded top of a stone peeping from the ground, while all the edges were encased in the earth. He speedily moved the surface soil, and with the aid of a lever raised the stone, which proved to be the covering of a rock cavity or box. Into this box he looked, and found that it did indeed contain the promised plates of gold and the Urim and Thummim.  Joseph could see that the box had been fashioned by cementing stones together to form the bottom and sides; while the rock which he had lifted away, beveled thin at the edges but thick and rounded at the center, had formed a close-fitting cover to the sacred receptacle. Within and across each end of the bottom of the box lay a stone; and upon these the plates and other treasures rested.  Carried away for a moment by admiration and his eager desire to learn further, Joseph stretched forth his hands to remove the records, but instantly the messenger was by his side and stayed his touch. Moroni informed him that four years must elapse before he could be permitted to hold and examine the contents of the box; in the meantime he must prove faithful as he had proved in the past, and on each succeeding anniversary of that day, during the intervening years, he must appear at the spot to "]]]
