She is an American woman, and upon several occasions has been of service to her own country.  Her name is Schweiring.\"  \"We shall remember, sir,\" said Chester.  \"Now,\" said General Pershing, \"I have no advice to offer as to how you shall reach Berlin, nor how you shall go about your work.  Once in Berlin, however, you will have to be governed by circumstances.  You speak German, I am told?\"  \"Like natives, sir,\" said Hal with a grin.  \"Very well.  I shall see that you are granted indefinite leave of absence.  There is just one thing more.  I want to say that I do not like to ask my men to become spies.\"  \"Why, sir,\" said Chester gravely, \"it's all for our country; and the day when a spy was looked down upon has gone.  It is just another way of serving ones country, sir.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said General Pershing, \"the punishment is the same as it has been down the ages: death.\"  \"If caught,\" Hal added with a smile.  \"True,\" was his commander's response, and a slight smile lighted, up his own features.  He arose and extended his hand.  Both lads shook it heartily.  \"I hope,\" said General Pershing, \"that you may both come through safely.  But if you don't--well, good-bye.  I don't need to tell you that if one can get through with the list that, from the nation's standpoint, what happens to the other is insignificant.\"  \"I have a request to make, sir,\" said Hal, as they turned to go.  \"Consider it granted,\" replied his commander.  \"It is this,\" said Hal.  \"I believe that it would be well for us to take a third man along.  It may be that he will never reach the German lines, but he should prove of help for the other two.\"  \"Have you the man in mind?\" asked General Pershing.  \"Yes, sir.  A man named McKenzie, a private in our troop.  He's a Canadian, and has seen years of active service.  Also, as I happen to know, he speaks German fluently.\"  \"I shall give you a paper authorizing his indefinite leave of absence,\" said General Pershing.  He scribbled a few words on a piece of paper, and passed it to the lad.  The boys drew themselves to attention, saluted, and left.  \"A pretty ticklish piece of business,\" said Chester quietly, as they made their way to their own quarters.  \"Rather,\" said Hal dryly; \"and still it must be done.  The safety of America depends upon the success of our mission.  It may be well that it has been entrusted to us rather than to older men.  We are less likely to be suspected if we reach Berlin safely.  Besides, we have been there before, and are somewhat familiar with the city.\"  \"Yes,\" said Chester grimly, \"we've been there several times before.  I recall that we went there once very much against our will--prisoners.\"  \"Well, we didn't stay very long,\" said Hal.  \"Let's hope we don't stay for keeps this time either,\" said Chester. \"To tell the truth, I don't think much of this spy business myself.\"  \"Somebody has to do it,\" Hal declared.  \"Of course, but I am not very fond of that sort of work.\"  \"If you don't want to go--\" Hal began, but Chester interrupted.  \"Of course, I want to go if it must be.  I am ready to do what I can for my country in whatever way I may.\"  \"I knew it,\" said Hal; \"I was only fooling.  Come, we will acquaint McKenzie with his work.  And if he comes safely through this, I feel confident he will not remain long in the ranks.\"  The found McKenzie, the erstwhile Canadian sergeant, in his tent.  \"McKenzie,\" said Hal, \"you are about to take a trip, I see.\"  \"That so, sir?  I hadn't heard of it.\"  \"Yes,\" Hal continued.  \"I heard a man say you were about to go to Germany.\"  \"And the man,\" said McKenzie, \"was--\"  \"General Pershing, McKenzie.\"  \"Very well, sir,\" said McKenzie, to whom the few words told the story of important work to be done.  \"In that event, I presume that General Pershing has seen fit to allow me leave of absence.\"  \"He has, McKenzie.  I shall present the order to Captain O'Neill at once.  In the meantime, see that your guns are cleaned, and that you have an extra supply of cartridges.  We may need them. Also, leave any papers or other marks of identification behind.  When you are ready, come to my quarters.\"  \"I shall be there in half an hour, sir.\"  Hal and Chester made their way to Captain O'Neill's quarters.  Hal presented the papers, granting leaves of absence to the three.  \"Hm-m,\" muttered Captain O'Neill.  \"Something up, eh?  Well, I wish I were going with you.\"  He extended a hand.  \"Good luck,\" he said quietly.      CHAPTER IV  INTO GERMANY  \"We'll have to have a leader for this party,\" said Hal, \"one whose word shall be law.  I'm agreeable to Chester.\"  \"I'd rather have you,\" said Chester.  McKenzie also voted for Hal, who already had done him some service. This agreement, stood.  \"All right,\" said Hal.  \"Now that I'm in command, I'll outline the course of procedure.  We'll go from here to the Dutch border.\"  \"How about passports?\" Chester wanted to know.  \"That's simple enough.  You remember the time when we drew up a set of fake passports representing ourselves to be correspondents of the New York Gazette?  We'll follow the same plan, except that we each will be represented as correspondents of different papers.  See, I've already drawn, them.\"  \"I see,\" said Chester, \"but American passports won't be honored in Germany now.\"  \"But they will be in Holland,\" said Hal.  \"We'll see what can be done about having them changed there.  Now, let's see if we know who we are.\"  He passed the fake passports to the others.  \"I'm Barney McCann, eh?\" said McKenzie, gazing at the paper he held in his hand.  \"Oh, well, I guess I can talk Irish as well as German if I have to.  And I represent the Chicago Mail.\"  \"I'm still Chester Crawford,\" said Chester, \"and I represent the New York Gazette.\"  \"I'm Hal Paine, and I represent the Philadelphia Globe,\" said Hal. \"We'll probably have to change our names when we go over the German border, but these should answer their purposes in Holland. Fortunately, we have learned a few things from Stubbs, so we are not unfamiliar with the workings of a newspaper.\"  \"Guess we had better get out of these uniforms,\" said Chester.  \"Right.  We'll don suits of plain khaki, such as Stubbs wears, and we'll equip ourselves with the necessary paraphernalia.\"  This was a simple task, and several hours later, horseback, the lads made their way toward where British troops, supported by French, were close to, the border of The Netherlands.  They showed their passports, prepared by Hal, to the British military authorities, and were permitted to pass.  Holland, although not a participant in the great war, nevertheless, soon after the outbreak of hostilities, had felt herself called upon to mobilize her military forces that she might protect her borders should one of the belligerents attempt to overrun her, as the Germans had overrun Belgium at the outbreak of the war.  Therefore, when the three travelers reached the border, they were held up by the military.  Hal presented his fake American passport, and Chester and McKenzie did likewise.  The officer who had accosted them turned them over to his superior.  \"Your intentions,\" said the officer, \"I hope are such as not to break Holland's neutrality?\"  \"We're perfectly peaceable, sir,\" returned Hal with a smile.  \"Very well.  This is a neutral country, and you are, of course, free to travel about it at your leisure so long as you conduct yourselves properly.  Of course, were you American soldiers it would be necessary for me to place you under arrest, and YOU would be interned until the end of the war.\"  \"I understand that, sir,\" said Hal.  \"By the way,\" said the Dutch officer, \"there is a Dutch newspaperman here at this moment.  Perhaps you would like to meet him.  He is Herr Heindrick Block, of the Amsterdamer.\"  \"We shall be pleased,\" said Hal quietly.  The Dutch officer excused himself, and returned a moment later with a young Dutchman, whom he introduced to the three friends.  They shook hands all around.  \"I've already met a compatriot of yours,\" said the young Dutchman, smiling, \"a Herr Stubbs.  He is with one of the New York papers--I forget which.\"  Hal and Chester gave a start of surprise, but quickly recovered themselves.  \"He is with my paper, The Gazette, sir,\" returned Chester.  \"Is he in these parts?\"  \"He was yesterday,\" replied Block.  \"I do not know where he is now.\"  The three friends took an instant liking to the young Dutch newspaper man.  He led the three to where he was temporarily quartered.  \"We can have a little chat here,\" he said.  During the course of the conversation Hal asked:  \"And what is the sentiment in Holland regarding the war?\"  The young Dutchman hesitated a moment, and then turned and gazed around quickly.  \"The sentiment,\" he said at last, \"is that Germany must be crushed.  Of course, at this moment Holland cannot afford to enter the arena. Germany has massed thousands of troops upon our border.  An unneutral act would be dangerous.  Nevertheless, Holland's sympathies are with the Allies--have been from the start.  There is another factor besides Holland's natural gratitude to England--that makes for this. Germany has overrun Holland, as well as the rest of the world with spies.  Holland is offended, but cannot afford to show it--now.  But while we are kept quiet, there are few of us who would not do much to help the Allied cause.\"  Hal thought quickly.  He glanced at the young Dutchman shrewdly.  He felt he could be trusted.  \"Then,\" said the lad quietly, \"can you conceive of any way by which we can get passports from the Dutch government that will pass us into Germany?\"  The young Dutchman manifested no surprise.  \"Have no fear,\" he said, as Chester and McKenzie manifested some anxiety at Hal's words.  \"I shall not betray you.  Only yesterday I was able to get a passport for your friend Herr Stubbs.\"  \"What?\" cried Hal.  \"Stubbs gone into"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6083"],["title","The Boy Allies with Haig in Flanders; Or, the Fighting Canadians of Vimy Ridge (#3)"],["body","many?\"  \"I supposed you knew that,\" said Block.  \"I supposed he was one of you.\"  \"No,\" said Chester, \"Stubbs is what he represents himself to be--a war correspondent.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Block, \"he has gone into Germany as Herr Klepstein, a Dutch newspaperman.\"  \"That means,\" said Hal, \"that it will be hard work getting passports for us.\"  \"Not at all,\" said Block. \"I can do that with ease.  There are many Dutch correspondents in Germany.  Two or three more won't matter.  One of you can take my passport.\"  He looked at Hal.  \"You and I look something alike, anyhow,\" he said.  \"So we do,\" Hal agreed.  \"But can you get passports for my friends here?\"  \"I can manufacture them myself, the same as I did for your friend Stubbs,\" said the Dutchman quietly, \"I need not tell you, however, that should I be discovered I would probably be shot.  But why shouldn't I do it?  My mother was an English Woman.\"  \"We shall be greatly obliged,\" said Hal.  Block led the way from the tent.  \"Mount your horses,\" he said.  \"We'll go to the railroad station and catch a train for Amsterdam.  You shall be my guests until the passports are prepared.\"  Hal was nothing loath.  He realized that they had encountered good fortune in the person of Herr Block.  He placed implicit confidence in the man, for it was perfectly plain that Block was telling the truth when he said his sympathies were with the Allies.  For two days the three friends were the guests of the young Dutchman at his bachelor apartments in Amsterdam.  Upon the morning of the third day, Block presented them with passports properly vised by the Dutch authorities.  \"These will get you through,\" he said quietly.  \"We can never thank you enough,\" declared Hal, quietly.  \"Some day you will realize what a great thing you have done for the world.\"  \"I realize it now,\" was the young Dutchman's reply.  \"I wish I were going with you, but it may be that I can be of more service here.\"  \"Undoubtedly,\" said Hal, \"if this is an example.\"  \"Now don't forget who you are,\" enjoined Block. \"You,\" to Hal, \"are Herr Block, of The Amsterdamer.\"  To Chester, \"You are Herr Amusdem\" To McKenzie: \"You are Herr Spidle, both of The Nederlander.  Do not forget.  Should you encounter other Dutch correspondents, it will be well for you to stand on your dignity, and to talk to them as little as possible.  Now, have you any idea how you are to go about the accomplishment of your mission, whatever it is?\"  \"No,\" said Hal, \"I haven't.  We shall act in accordance with developments.\"  \"Well,\" said Block, \"you may as well be going.  The sooner you get there the better.  I shall go with you to your train.  You will have to show no passports until you get to the frontier.\"  At the station, Block saw them comfortably installed in a car that would carry them across the border. He shook hands with them.  \"Good luck,\" he said quietly; and added: \"Should you, by any chance, come out of Germany a jump ahead of a bayonet, remember you will find temporary, safety in my quarters.  Good-bye.\"      CHAPTER V  THE GAME OPENS  \"You may pass, gentlemen.\"  The speaker was a German officer.  Upon the arrival of the three friends at the railroad terminus just across the German border the officer had made a tour of the train, examining the passports of the passengers.  Hal, Chester and McKenzie had extended their passports along with the other passengers, and the German officer had found nothing wrong with them.  As the German took his leave, McKenzie breathed a sigh of relief.  \"I was sure he was going to nab us,\" he said.  \"Careful,\" whispered Hal.  \"We must do all our talking in German, and we must do very little of that concerning our private affairs. Remember, walls have ears, and I guess that will apply to a railroad car as well as a house.\"  \"Right, Herr Block,\" said Chester with a smile.  The lads found that by remaining upon their car they would go straight through to Berlin.  The train was called the Amsterdam-Berlin express, and, while at the border, it was crowded with troops, there was still a fair sprinkling of passengers bound for the German capital.  It was after dark when the train pulled into Berlin and Hal, Chester, and McKenzie prepared to disembark.  As the train stopped, Hal made sure that his revolver was loose in his pocket, settled his hat firmly on his head, and led the way from the car.  As with most travelers in that part of the world at that time, neither was burdened with baggage.  Each carried a small portfolio, much used at that time by war correspondents, but they had no other luggage.  \"We'll go to the Hotel Bismarck,\" said Hal.  Although it had been years since either Hal or Chester had been in Berlin, Hal's sense of direction now stood him in good stead.  He remembered where the Hotel Bismarck stood as well as though he had been there yesterday.  At the hotel the three registered under their assumed names, and paid a month in advance for a small suite of two rooms.  \"We expect to study the internal situation of the city for some time,\" Hal explained to the clerk, \"and we want to feel sure that we shall have a place to stay while we are here.\"  The three made themselves comfortable in their apartments, and for some time talked quietly.  At last Hal gave the word for bed.  \"We don't know just how we shall proceed,\" he said, \"but we must be fresh and ready for any eventuality in the morning.\"  Morning came and with it the three friends were astir.  They had an early breakfast, and then Hal announced that he would fare forth alone.  \"I'll tell you where I'm going,\" he said, \"so that if anything happens to me you will go ahead with the work, regardless.  Remember this. Even though I may get in trouble, your duty will be to get the list, irrespective of what my fate may be.  America comes first, you know, Chester.\"  \"Of course,\" was the latter's quiet reply.  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"I am going to the home of the German undersecretary of foreign affairs.  I am going to see Mrs. Schweiring.\"  Chester nodded.  \"Then we shall stay here until you return,\" he said.  \"Very well,\" Hal agreed.  \"But if I have not returned by noon, you will know something has happened, and you will proceed about the work with no further thought of me.\"  He left the room quickly.  He made inquiries at the hotel office, and half an hour later found himself before the residence of the German undersecretary of foreign affairs.  He rang the doorbell.  A footman answered the ring.  Hal announced that he would like to see Mrs. Schweiring.  \"Your card,\" said the footman, allowing him to enter.  \"I have no card,\" said Hal.  \"You will tell her that Herr Block, of the Dutch newspaper, The Amsterdamer, desires to see her.\"  The footman bowed and departed.  A few moments later he returned, followed by a young woman--she could not have been more than 18, Hal decided.  The young woman approached, and spoke to Hal.  \"My mother is unable to see you at this moment, Herr Block,\" she said. \"She has sent me to learn the nature of your business with her.\"  \"I am sorry, fraulein,\" said Hal gravely, \"but my business is with your mother.  I cannot confide it to you.\"  The footman, meantime, had left the room.  The girl stamped her foot a little angrily.  \"But mother has no secrets from me,\" she declared.  \"That's the American blood talking now,\" said Hal to himself.  Aloud he replied:  \"Nevertheless, fraulein, I must again ask to be permitted to speak to your mother.\"  The girl glanced at him sharply.  Then she exclaimed in a low voice:  \"You are no Dutchman, mynheer.\"  Hal started a trifle in spite of himself; then, realizing that this must have betrayed him, he dropped his hand to his pocket, where reposed his revolver.  The girl smiled.  \"Have no fear,\" she said.  \"I shall say nothing.  Can it be you are the one whom mother expects?\"  \"The best way to find that out,\" said Hal, \"is to summon your mother.\"  The girl hesitated no longer.  She fairly flew from the room.  She reappeared a moment later, followed by an older woman.  \"This is Herr Block, Mother,\" she said.  \"Very well, Gladys,\" replied her mother.  \"Now, if you will leave us alone, and make sure that we are not disturbed.\"  \"I shall stand guard myself,\" replied the daughter.  She disappeared into the long hall.  \"Now, Herr Block,\" said Mrs. Schweiring, \"you may tell me the nature of your business.\"  Hal glanced sharply about the room.  Then he leaned close.  \"I come from the American expeditionary forces in France,\" he said quietly.  Mrs. Schweiring manifested no surprise.  \"I had surmised as much,\" she returned, \"I had looked, however, for a man in civil life rather than a military man; also, I had looked for one farther along in years.\"  \"I am sure you will find that my youth may work to our advantage,\" said Hal quietly.  \"Perhaps.  Now tell me in what way I may help.\"  \"Well,\" said Hal, \"I have come, two friends and myself, in an effort to lay hands upon the list of German spies in America--the list kept by the German prime minister.\"  Mrs. Schweiring nodded.  \"I had supposed as much.  It was I who informed the department of state in Washington that such a list exists; but without help and without laying myself open to suspicion, I dared not try to get it.  It is desperate work, but we shall see what can be done.  Gladys!\"  Her daughter re-entered the room in response to this summons.  \"Gladys,\" said her mother, \"Herr Block is the man we have been expecting; but he has not come alone.  His companions are at the Hotel Bismarck, registered as Herr Spidle and Herr Amusdem.  You will have their belongings moved here.  They are friends whom you met in Switzerland and who will share our hospitality while here.  Do you understand?\"  \"Perfectly, Mother.\"  \"But we have no belongings,\" said Hal quietly.  \"We could not be bothered with excess baggage.\"  \"Then I shall see that you are supplied with necessary articles,\" said his hostess.  \"The success of your mission will necessitate it.  At any rate,\""]]]
