It was for this reason that I had ordered the assault to take place at once, as soon as I had received the news of the capture of Five Forks.  The corps commanders, however, reported that it was so dark that the men could not see to move, and it would be impossible to make the assault then. But we kept up a continuous artillery fire upon the enemy around the whole line including that north of the James River, until it was light enough to move, which was about a quarter to five in the morning.  At that hour Parke's and Wright's corps moved out as directed, brushed the abatis from their front as they advanced under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery, and went without flinching directly on till they mounted the parapets and threw themselves inside of the enemy's line. Parke, who was on the right, swept down to the right and captured a very considerable length of line in that direction, but at that point the outer was so near the inner line which closely enveloped the city of Petersburg that he could make no advance forward and, in fact, had a very serious task to turn the lines which he had captured to the defence of his own troops and to hold them; but he succeeded in this.  Wright swung around to his left and moved to Hatcher's Run, sweeping everything before him.  The enemy had traverses in rear of his captured line, under cover of which he made something of a stand, from one to another, as Wright moved on; but the latter met no serious obstacle.  As you proceed to the left the outer line becomes gradually much farther from the inner one, and along about Hatcher's Run they must be nearly two miles apart. Both Parke and Wright captured a considerable amount of artillery and some prisoners--Wright about three thousand of them.  In the meantime Ord and Humphreys, in obedience to the instructions they had received, had succeeded by daylight, or very early in the morning, in capturing the intrenched picket-lines in their front; and before Wright got up to that point, Ord had also succeeded in getting inside of the enemy's intrenchments.  The second corps soon followed; and the outer works of Petersburg were in the hands of the National troops, never to be wrenched from them again.  When Wright reached Hatcher's Run, he sent a regiment to destroy the South Side Railroad just outside of the city.  My headquarters were still at Dabney's saw-mills.  As soon as I received the news of Wright's success, I sent dispatches announcing the fact to all points around the line, including the troops at Bermuda Hundred and those on the north side of the James, and to the President at City Point.  Further dispatches kept coming in, and as they did I sent the additional news to these points.  Finding at length that they were all in, I mounted my horse to join the troops who were inside the works. When I arrived there I rode my horse over the parapet just as Wright's three thousand prisoners were coming out.  I was soon joined inside by General Meade and his staff.  Lee made frantic efforts to recover at least part of the lost ground. Parke on our right was repeatedly assaulted, but repulsed every effort. Before noon Longstreet was ordered up from the north side of the James River thus bringing the bulk of Lee's army around to the support of his extreme right.  As soon as I learned this I notified Weitzel and directed him to keep up close to the enemy and to have Hartsuff, commanding the Bermuda Hundred front, to do the same thing, and if they found any break to go in; Hartsuff especially should do so, for this would separate Richmond and Petersburg.  Sheridan, after he had returned to Five Forks, swept down to Petersburg, coming in on our left.  This gave us a continuous line from the Appomattox River below the city to the same river above.  At eleven o'clock, not having heard from Sheridan, I reinforced Parke with two brigades from City Point.  With this additional force he completed his captured works for better defence, and built back from his right, so as to protect his flank.  He also carried in and made an abatis between himself and the enemy.  Lee brought additional troops and artillery against Parke even after this was done, and made several assaults with very heavy losses.  The enemy had in addition to their intrenched line close up to Petersburg, two enclosed works outside of it, Fort Gregg and Fort Whitworth.  We thought it had now become necessary to carry them by assault.  About one o'clock in the day, Fort Gregg was assaulted by Foster's division of the 24th corps (Gibbon's), supported by two brigades from Ord's command.  The battle was desperate and the National troops were repulsed several times; but it was finally carried, and immediately the troops in Fort Whitworth evacuated the place.  The guns of Fort Gregg were turned upon the retreating enemy, and the commanding officer with some sixty of the men of Fort Whitworth surrendered.  I had ordered Miles in the morning to report to Sheridan.  In moving to execute this order he came upon the enemy at the intersection of the White Oak Road and the Claiborne Road.  The enemy fell back to Sutherland Station on the South Side Road and were followed by Miles. This position, naturally a strong and defensible one, was also strongly intrenched.  Sheridan now came up and Miles asked permission from him to make the assault, which Sheridan gave.  By this time Humphreys had got through the outer works in his front, and came up also and assumed command over Miles, who commanded a division in his corps.  I had sent an order to Humphreys to turn to his right and move towards Petersburg. This order he now got, and started off, thus leaving Miles alone.  The latter made two assaults, both of which failed, and he had to fall back a few hundred yards.  Hearing that Miles had been left in this position, I directed Humphreys to send a division back to his relief.  He went himself.  Sheridan before starting to sweep down to Petersburg had sent Merritt with his cavalry to the west to attack some Confederate cavalry that had assembled there.  Merritt drove them north to the Appomattox River. Sheridan then took the enemy at Sutherland Station on the reverse side from where Miles was, and the two together captured the place, with a large number of prisoners and some pieces of artillery, and put the remainder, portions of three Confederate corps, to flight.  Sheridan followed, and drove them until night, when further pursuit was stopped. Miles bivouacked for the night on the ground which he with Sheridan had carried so handsomely by assault.  I cannot explain the situation here better than by giving my dispatch to City Point that evening:   BOYDTON ROAD, NEAR PETERSBURG, April 2, 1865.--4.40 P.M.  COLONEL T. S. BOWERS, City Point.  We are now up and have a continuous line of troops, and in a few hours will be intrenched from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river above.  Heth's and Wilcox's divisions, such part of them as were not captured, were cut off from town, either designedly on their part or because they could not help it. Sheridan with the cavalry and 5th corps is above them.  Miles's division, 2d corps, was sent from the White Oak Road to Sutherland Station on the South Side Railroad, where he met them, and at last accounts was engaged with them.  Not knowing whether Sheridan would get up in time, General Humphreys was sent with another division from here.  The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men, and probably fifty pieces of artillery.  I do not know the number of men and guns accurately however.  * * *  I think the President might come out and pay us a visit tomorrow.  U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.   During the night of April 2d our line was intrenched from the river above to the river below.  I ordered a bombardment to be commenced the next morning at five A.M., to be followed by an assault at six o'clock; but the enemy evacuated Petersburg early in the morning.    CHAPTER LXV.  THE CAPTURE OF PETERSBURG--MEETING PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN PETERSBURG--THE CAPTURE OF RICHMOND--PURSUING THE ENEMY--VISIT TO SHERIDAN AND MEADE.  General Meade and I entered Petersburg on the morning of the 3d and took a position under cover of a house which protected us from the enemy's musketry which was flying thick and fast there.  As we would occasionally look around the corner we could see the streets and the Appomattox bottom, presumably near the bridge, packed with the Confederate army.  I did not have artillery brought up, because I was sure Lee was trying to make his escape, and I wanted to push immediately in pursuit.  At all events I had not the heart to turn the artillery upon such a mass of defeated and fleeing men, and I hoped to capture them soon.  Soon after the enemy had entirely evacuated Petersburg, a man came in who represented himself to be an engineer of the Army of Northern Virginia.  He said that Lee had for some time been at work preparing a strong enclosed intrenchment, into which he would throw himself when forced out of Petersburg, and fight his final battle there; that he was actually at that time drawing his troops from Richmond, and falling back into this prepared work. This statement was made to General Meade and myself when we were together.  I had already given orders for the movement up the south side of the Appomattox for the purpose of heading off Lee; but Meade was so much impressed by this man's story that he thought we ought to cross the Appomattox there at once and move against Lee in his new position.  I knew that Lee was no fool, as he would have been to have put himself and his army between two formidable streams like the James and Appomattox rivers, and between two such armies as those of the Potomac and the James. Then these streams coming together as they did to the east of him, it would be only "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5865"],["title","Personal Memoirs of  U. S. Grant, Part 6. (#7)"],["body","to close up in the west to have him thoroughly cut off from all supplies or possibility of reinforcement.  It would only have been a question of days, and not many of them, if he had taken the position assigned to him by the so-called engineer, when he would have been obliged to surrender his army.  Such is one of the ruses resorted to in war to deceive your antagonist.  My judgment was that Lee would necessarily have to evacuate Richmond, and that the only course for him to pursue would be to follow the Danville Road. Accordingly my object was to secure a point on that road south of Lee, and I told Meade this.  He suggested that if Lee was going that way we would follow him.  My reply was that we did not want to follow him; we wanted to get ahead of him and cut him off, and if he would only stay in the position he (Meade) believed him to be in at that time, I wanted nothing better; that when we got in possession of the Danville Railroad, at its crossing of the Appomattox River, if we still found him between the two rivers, all we had to do was to move eastward and close him up.  That we would then have all the advantage we could possibly have by moving directly against him from Petersburg, even if he remained in the position assigned him by the engineer officer.  I had held most of the command aloof from the intrenchments, so as to start them out on the Danville Road early in the morning, supposing that Lee would be gone during the night.  During the night I strengthened Sheridan by sending him Humphreys's corps.  Lee, as we now know, had advised the authorities at Richmond, during the day, of the condition of affairs, and told them it would be impossible for him to hold out longer than night, if he could hold out that long. Davis was at church when he received Lee's dispatch.  The congregation was dismissed with the notice that there would be no evening service. The rebel government left Richmond about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 2d.  At night Lee ordered his troops to assemble at Amelia Court House, his object being to get away, join Johnston if possible, and to try to crush Sherman before I could get there.  As soon as I was sure of this I notified Sheridan and directed him to move out on the Danville Railroad to the south side of the Appomattox River as speedily as possible.  He replied that he already had some of his command nine miles out.  I then ordered the rest of the Army of the Potomac under Meade to follow the same road in the morning.  Parke's corps followed by the same road, and the Army of the James was directed to follow the road which ran alongside of the South Side Railroad to Burke's Station, and to repair the railroad and telegraph as they proceeded.  That road was a 5 feet gauge, while our rolling stock was all of the 4 feet 8 1/2 inches gauge; consequently the rail on one side of the track had to be taken up throughout the whole length and relaid so as to conform to the gauge of our cars and locomotives.  Mr. Lincoln was at City Point at the time, and had been for some days. I would have let him know what I contemplated doing, only while I felt a strong conviction that the move was going to be successful, yet it might not prove so; and then I would have only added another to the many disappointments he had been suffering for the past three years.  But when we started out he saw that we were moving for a purpose, and bidding us Godspeed, remained there to hear the result.  The next morning after the capture of Petersburg, I telegraphed Mr. Lincoln asking him to ride out there and see me, while I would await his arrival.  I had started all the troops out early in the morning, so that after the National army left Petersburg there was not a soul to be seen, not even an animal in the streets.  There was absolutely no one there, except my staff officers and, possibly, a small escort of cavalry.  We had selected the piazza of a deserted house, and occupied it until the President arrived.  About the first thing that Mr. Lincoln said to me, after warm congratulations for the victory, and thanks both to myself and to the army which had accomplished it, was:  \"Do you know, general, that I have had a sort of a sneaking idea for some days that you intended to do something like this.\"  Our movements having been successful up to this point, I no longer had any object in concealing from the President all my movements, and the objects I had in view.  He remained for some days near City Point, and I communicated with him frequently and fully by telegraph.  Mr. Lincoln knew that it had been arranged for Sherman to join me at a fixed time, to co-operate in the destruction of Lee's army.  I told him that I had been very anxious to have the Eastern armies vanquish their old enemy who had so long resisted all their repeated and gallant attempts to subdue them or drive them from their capital.  The Western armies had been in the main successful until they had conquered all the territory from the Mississippi River to the State of North Carolina, and were now almost ready to knock at the back door of Richmond, asking admittance.  I said to him that if the Western armies should be even upon the field, operating against Richmond and Lee, the credit would be given to them for the capture, by politicians and non-combatants from the section of country which those troops hailed from.  It might lead to disagreeable bickerings between members of Congress of the East and those of the West in some of their debates.  Western members might be throwing it up to the members of the East that in the suppression of the rebellion they were not able to capture an army, or to accomplish much in the way of contributing toward that end, but had to wait until the Western armies had conquered all the territory south and west of them, and then come on to help them capture the only army they had been engaged with.  Mr. Lincoln said he saw that now, but had never thought of it before, because his anxiety was so great that he did not care where the aid came from so the work was done.  The Army of the Potomac has every reason to be proud of its four years' record in the suppression of the rebellion.  The army it had to fight was the protection to the capital of a people which was attempting to found a nation upon the territory of the United States.  Its loss would be the loss of the cause.  Every energy, therefore, was put forth by the Confederacy to protect and maintain their capital.  Everything else would go if it went. Lee's army had to be strengthened to enable it to maintain its position, no matter what territory was wrested from the South in another quarter.  I never expected any such bickering as I have indicated, between the soldiers of the two sections; and, fortunately, there has been none between the politicians.  Possibly I am the only one who thought of the liability of such a state of things in advance.  When our conversation was at an end Mr. Lincoln mounted his horse and started on his return to City Point, while I and my staff started to join the army, now a good many miles in advance.  Up to this time I had not received the report of the capture of Richmond.  Soon after I left President Lincoln I received a dispatch from General Weitzel which notified me that he had taken possession of Richmond at about 8.15 o'clock in the morning of that day, the 3d, and that he had found the city on fire in two places. The city was in the most utter confusion.  The authorities had taken the precaution to empty all the liquor into the gutter, and to throw out the provisions which the Confederate government had left, for the people to gather up.  The city had been deserted by the authorities, civil and military, without any notice whatever that they were about to leave.  In fact, up to the very hour of the evacuation the people had been led to believe that Lee had gained an important victory somewhere around Petersburg.  Weitzel's command found evidence of great demoralization in Lee's army, there being still a great many men and even officers in the town.  The city was on fire.  Our troops were directed to extinguish the flames, which they finally succeeded in doing. The fire had been started by some one connected with the retreating army.  All authorities deny that it was authorized, and I presume it was the work of excited men who were leaving what they regarded as their capital and may have felt that it was better to destroy it than have it fall into the hands of their enemy.  Be that as it may, the National troops found the city in flames, and used every effort to extinguish them.  The troops that had formed Lee's right, a great many of them, were cut off from getting back into Petersburg, and were pursued by our cavalry so hotly and closely that they threw away caissons, ammunition, clothing, and almost everything to lighten their loads, and pushed along up the Appomattox River until finally they took water and crossed over.  I left Mr. Lincoln and started, as I have already said, to join the command, which halted at Sutherland Station, about nine miles out.  We had still time to march as much farther, and time was an object; but the roads were bad and the trains belonging to the advance corps had blocked up the road so that it was impossible to get on.  Then, again, our cavalry had struck some of the enemy and were pursuing them; and the orders were that the roads should be given up to the cavalry whenever they appeared.  This caused further delay.  General Wright, who was in command of one of the corps which were left back, thought to gain time by letting his men go into bivouac and trying to get up some rations for them, and clearing out the road, so that when they did start they would be uninterrupted.  Humphreys, who was far ahead, was also out of rations.  They did not succeed in getting them up through the night; but the Army of the Potomac, officers and men, were so elated by the reflection that at last"]]]
