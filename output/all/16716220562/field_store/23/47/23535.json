RETURN OF THE ARMY--MARRIAGE--ORDERED TO THE PACIFIC COAST--CROSSING THE ISTHMUS--ARRIVAL AT SAN FRANCISCO.  My experience in the Mexican war was of great advantage to me afterwards.  Besides the many practical lessons it taught, the war brought nearly all the officers of the regular army together so as to make them personally acquainted.  It also brought them in contact with volunteers, many of whom served in the war of the rebellion afterwards. Then, in my particular case, I had been at West Point at about the right time to meet most of the graduates who were of a suitable age at the breaking out of the rebellion to be trusted with large commands. Graduating in 1843, I was at the military academy from one to four years with all cadets who graduated between 1840 and 1846--seven classes. These classes embraced more than fifty officers who afterwards became generals on one side or the other in the rebellion, many of them holding high commands.  All the older officers, who became conspicuous in the rebellion, I had also served with and known in Mexico:  Lee, J. E. Johnston, A. S. Johnston, Holmes, Hebert and a number of others on the Confederate side; McCall, Mansfield, Phil. Kearney and others on the National side.  The acquaintance thus formed was of immense service to me in the war of the rebellion--I mean what I learned of the characters of those to whom I was afterwards opposed.  I do not pretend to say that all movements, or even many of them, were made with special reference to the characteristics of the commander against whom they were directed. But my appreciation of my enemies was certainly affected by this knowledge.  The natural disposition of most people is to clothe a commander of a large army whom they do not know, with almost superhuman abilities.  A large part of the National army, for instance, and most of the press of the country, clothed General Lee with just such qualities, but I had known him personally, and knew that he was mortal; and it was just as well that I felt this.  The treaty of peace was at last ratified, and the evacuation of Mexico by United States troops was ordered.  Early in June the troops in the City of Mexico began to move out.  Many of them, including the brigade to which I belonged, were assembled at Jalapa, above the vomito, to await the arrival of transports at Vera Cruz:  but with all this precaution my regiment and others were in camp on the sand beach in a July sun, for about a week before embarking, while the fever raged with great virulence in Vera Cruz, not two miles away.  I can call to mind only one person, an officer, who died of the disease.  My regiment was sent to Pascagoula, Mississippi, to spend the summer.  As soon as it was settled in camp I obtained a leave of absence for four months and proceeded to St. Louis.  On the 22d of August, 1848, I was married to Miss Julia Dent, the lady of whom I have before spoken.  We visited my parents and relations in Ohio, and, at the end of my leave, proceeded to my post at Sackett's Harbor, New York.  In April following I was ordered to Detroit, Michigan, where two years were spent with but few important incidents.  The present constitution of the State of Michigan was ratified during this time.  By the terms of one of its provisions, all citizens of the United States residing within the State at the time of the ratification became citizens of Michigan also. During my stay in Detroit there was an election for city officers.  Mr. Zachariah Chandler was the candidate of the Whigs for the office of Mayor, and was elected, although the city was then reckoned democratic.  All the officers stationed there at the time who offered their votes were permitted to cast them.  I did not offer mine, however, as I did not wish to consider myself a citizen of Michigan.  This was Mr. Chandler's first entry into politics, a career he followed ever after with great success, and in which he died enjoying the friendship, esteem and love of his countrymen.  In the spring of 1851 the garrison at Detroit was transferred to Sackett's Harbor, and in the following spring the entire 4th infantry was ordered to the Pacific Coast.  It was decided that Mrs. Grant should visit my parents at first for a few months, and then remain with her own family at their St. Louis home until an opportunity offered of sending for her.  In the month of April the regiment was assembled at Governor's Island, New York Harbor, and on the 5th of July eight companies sailed for Aspinwall.  We numbered a little over seven hundred persons, including the families of officers and soldiers.  Passage was secured for us on the old steamer Ohio, commanded at the time by Captain Schenck, of the navy.  It had not been determined, until a day or two before starting, that the 4th infantry should go by the Ohio; consequently, a complement of passengers had already been secured.  The addition of over seven hundred to this list crowded the steamer most uncomfortably, especially for the tropics in July.  In eight days Aspinwall was reached.  At that time the streets of the town were eight or ten inches under water, and foot passengers passed from place to place on raised foot-walks. July is at the height of the wet season, on the Isthmus.  At intervals the rain would pour down in streams, followed in not many minutes by a blazing, tropical summer's sun.  These alternate changes, from rain to sunshine, were continuous in the afternoons.  I wondered how any person could live many months in Aspinwall, and wondered still more why any one tried.  In the summer of 1852 the Panama railroad was completed only to the point where it now crosses the Chagres River.  From there passengers were carried by boats to Gorgona, at which place they took mules for Panama, some twenty-five miles further.  Those who travelled over the Isthmus in those days will remember that boats on the Chagres River were propelled by natives not inconveniently burdened with clothing.  These boats carried thirty to forty passengers each.  The crews consisted of six men to a boat, armed with long poles.  There were planks wide enough for a man to walk on conveniently, running along the sides of each boat from end to end.  The men would start from the bow, place one end of their poles against the river bottom, brace their shoulders against the other end, and then walk to the stern as rapidly as they could.  In this way from a mile to a mile and a half an hour could be made, against the current of the river.  I, as regimental quartermaster, had charge of the public property and had also to look after the transportation.  A contract had been entered into with the steamship company in New York for the transportation of the regiment to California, including the Isthmus transit.  A certain amount of baggage was allowed per man, and saddle animals were to be furnished to commissioned officers and to all disabled persons.  The regiment, with the exception of one company left as guards to the public property--camp and garrison equipage principally--and the soldiers with families, took boats, propelled as above described, for Gorgona.  From this place they marched to Panama, and were soon comfortably on the steamer anchored in the bay, some three or four miles from the town.  I, with one company of troops and all the soldiers with families, all the tents, mess chests and camp kettles, was sent to Cruces, a town a few miles higher up the Chagres River than Gorgona.  There I found an impecunious American who had taken the contract to furnish transportation for the regiment at a stipulated price per hundred pounds for the freight and so much for each saddle animal.  But when we reached Cruces there was not a mule, either for pack or saddle, in the place. The contractor promised that the animals should be on hand in the morning.  In the morning he said that they were on the way from some imaginary place, and would arrive in the course of the day.  This went on until I saw that he could not procure the animals at all at the price he had promised to furnish them for.  The unusual number of passengers that had come over on the steamer, and the large amount of freight to pack, had created an unprecedented demand for mules.  Some of the passengers paid as high as forty dollars for the use of a mule to ride twenty-five miles, when the mule would not have sold for ten dollars in that market at other times. Meanwhile the cholera had broken out, and men were dying every hour.  To diminish the food for the disease, I permitted the company detailed with me to proceed to Panama.  The captain and the doctors accompanied the men, and I was left alone with the sick and the soldiers who had families.  The regiment at Panama was also affected with the disease; but there were better accommodations for the well on the steamer, and a hospital, for those taken with the disease, on an old hulk anchored a mile off.  There were also hospital tents on shore on the island of Flamingo, which stands in the bay.  I was about a week at Cruces before transportation began to come in. About one-third of the people with me died, either at Cruces or on the way to Panama.  There was no agent of the transportation company at Cruces to consult, or to take the responsibility of procuring transportation at a price which would secure it.  I therefore myself dismissed the contractor and made a new contract with a native, at more than double the original price.  Thus we finally reached Panama.  The steamer, however, could not proceed until the cholera abated, and the regiment was detained still longer.  Altogether, on the Isthmus and on the Pacific side, we were delayed six weeks.  About one-seventh of those who left New York harbor with the 4th infantry on the 5th of July, now lie buried on the Isthmus of Panama or on Flamingo island in Panama Bay.  One amusing circumstance occurred while we were lying"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5861"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 2. (#1)"],["body","anchor in Panama Bay.  In the regiment there was a Lieutenant Slaughter who was very liable to sea-sickness.  It almost made him sick to see the wave of a table-cloth when the servants were spreading it.  Soon after his graduation, Slaughter was ordered to California and took passage by a sailing vessel going around Cape Horn.  The vessel was seven months making the voyage, and Slaughter was sick every moment of the time, never more so than while lying at anchor after reaching his place of destination. On landing in California he found orders which had come by the Isthmus, notifying him of a mistake in his assignment; he should have been ordered to the northern lakes.  He started back by the Isthmus route and was sick all the way.  But when he arrived at the East he was again ordered to California, this time definitely, and at this date was making his third trip.  He was as sick as ever, and had been so for more than a month while lying at anchor in the bay.  I remember him well, seated with his elbows on the table in front of him, his chin between his hands, and looking the picture of despair.  At last he broke out, \"I wish I had taken my father's advice; he wanted me to go into the navy; if I had done so, I should not have had to go to sea so much.\"  Poor Slaughter! it was his last sea voyage.  He was killed by Indians in Oregon.  By the last of August the cholera had so abated that it was deemed safe to start.  The disease did not break out again on the way to California, and we reached San Francisco early in September.    CHAPTER XV.  SAN FRANCISCO--EARLY CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES--LIFE ON THE PACIFIC COAST --PROMOTED CAPTAIN--FLUSH TIMES IN CALIFORNIA.  San Francisco at that day was a lively place.  Gold, or placer digging as it was called, was at its height.  Steamers plied daily between San Francisco and both Stockton and Sacramento. Passengers and gold from the southern mines came by the Stockton boat; from the northern mines by Sacramento.  In the evening when these boats arrived, Long Wharf--there was but one wharf in San Francisco in 1852--was alive with people crowding to meet the miners as they came down to sell their \"dust\" and to \"have a time.\"  Of these some were runners for hotels, boarding houses or restaurants; others belonged to a class of impecunious adventurers, of good manners and good presence, who were ever on the alert to make the acquaintance of people with some ready means, in the hope of being asked to take a meal at a restaurant.  Many were young men of good family, good education and gentlemanly instincts.  Their parents had been able to support them during their minority, and to give them good educations, but not to maintain them afterwards.  From 1849 to 1853 there was a rush of people to the Pacific coast, of the class described. All thought that fortunes were to be picked up, without effort, in the gold fields on the Pacific.  Some realized more than their most sanguine expectations; but for one such there were hundreds disappointed, many of whom now fill unknown graves; others died wrecks of their former selves, and many, without a vicious instinct, became criminals and outcasts. Many of the real scenes in early California life exceed in strangeness and interest any of the mere products of the brain of the novelist.  Those early days in California brought out character.  It was a long way off then, and the journey was expensive.  The fortunate could go by Cape Horn or by the Isthmus of Panama; but the mass of pioneers crossed the plains with their ox-teams.  This took an entire summer.  They were very lucky when they got through with a yoke of worn-out cattle.  All other means were exhausted in procuring the outfit on the Missouri River.  The immigrant, on arriving, found himself a stranger, in a strange land, far from friends.  Time pressed, for the little means that could be realized from the sale of what was left of the outfit would not support a man long at California prices.  Many became discouraged.  Others would take off their coats and look for a job, no matter what it might be.  These succeeded as a rule. There were many young men who had studied professions before they went to California, and who had never done a day's manual labor in their lives, who took in the situation at once and went to work to make a start at anything they could get to do.  Some supplied carpenters and masons with material--carrying plank, brick, or mortar, as the case might be; others drove stages, drays, or baggage wagons, until they could do better.  More became discouraged early and spent their time looking up people who would \"treat,\" or lounging about restaurants and gambling houses where free lunches were furnished daily. They were welcomed at these places because they often brought in miners who proved good customers.  My regiment spent a few weeks at Benicia barracks, and then was ordered to Fort Vancouver, on the Columbia River, then in Oregon Territory. During the winter of 1852-3 the territory was divided, all north of the Columbia River being taken from Oregon to make Washington Territory.  Prices for all kinds of supplies were so high on the Pacific coast from 1849 until at least 1853--that it would have been impossible for officers of the army to exist upon their pay, if it had not been that authority was given them to purchase from the commissary such supplies as he kept, at New Orleans wholesale prices.  A cook could not be hired for the pay of a captain.  The cook could do better.  At Benicia, in 1852, flour was 25 cents per pound; potatoes were 16 cents; beets, turnips and cabbage, 6 cents; onions, 37 1/2 cents; meat and other articles in proportion.  In 1853 at Vancouver vegetables were a little lower.  I with three other officers concluded that we would raise a crop for ourselves, and by selling the surplus realize something handsome.  I bought a pair of horses that had crossed the plains that summer and were very poor.  They recuperated rapidly, however, and proved a good team to break up the ground with.  I performed all the labor of breaking up the ground while the other officers planted the potatoes.  Our crop was enormous.  Luckily for us the Columbia River rose to a great height from the melting of the snow in the mountains in June, and overflowed and killed most of our crop.  This saved digging it up, for everybody on the Pacific coast seemed to have come to the conclusion at the same time that agriculture would be profitable.  In 1853 more than three-quarters of the potatoes raised were permitted to rot in the ground, or had to be thrown away.  The only potatoes we sold were to our own mess.  While I was stationed on the Pacific coast we were free from Indian wars.  There were quite a number of remnants of tribes in the vicinity of Portland in Oregon, and of Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory. They had generally acquired some of the vices of civilization, but none of the virtues, except in individual cases.  The Hudson's Bay Company had held the North-west with their trading posts for many years before the United States was represented on the Pacific coast.  They still retained posts along the Columbia River and one at Fort Vancouver, when I was there.  Their treatment of the Indians had brought out the better qualities of the savages.  Farming had been undertaken by the company to supply the Indians with bread and vegetables; they raised some cattle and horses; and they had now taught the Indians to do the labor of the farm and herd. They always compensated them for their labor, and always gave them goods of uniform quality and at uniform price.  Before the advent of the American, the medium of exchange between the Indian and the white man was pelts.  Afterward it was silver coin.  If an Indian received in the sale of a horse a fifty dollar gold piece, not an infrequent occurrence, the first thing he did was to exchange it for American half dollars. These he could count.  He would then commence his purchases, paying for each article separately, as he got it.  He would not trust any one to add up the bill and pay it all at once.  At that day fifty dollar gold pieces, not the issue of the government, were common on the Pacific coast.  They were called slugs.  The Indians, along the lower Columbia as far as the Cascades and on the lower Willamette, died off very fast during the year I spent in that section; for besides acquiring the vices of the white people they had acquired also their diseases.  The measles and the small-pox were both amazingly fatal.  In their wild state, before the appearance of the white man among them, the principal complaints they were subject to were those produced by long involuntary fasting, violent exercise in pursuit of game, and over-eating.  Instinct more than reason had taught them a remedy for these ills.  It was the steam bath.  Something like a bake-oven was built, large enough to admit a man lying down. Bushes were stuck in the ground in two rows, about six feet long and some two or three feet apart; other bushes connected the rows at one end.  The tops of the bushes were drawn together to interlace, and confined in that position; the whole was then plastered over with wet clay until every opening was filled. Just inside the open end of the oven the floor was scooped out so as to make a hole that would hold a bucket or two of water. These ovens were always built on the banks of a stream, a big spring, or pool of water.  When a patient required a bath, a fire was built near the oven and a pile of stones put upon it. The cavity at the front was then filled with water.  When the stones were sufficiently heated, the patient would draw himself into the oven; a blanket would be thrown over the open end, and hot stones put into the water until the patient could stand it no longer.  He was then withdrawn from his steam bath and doused into the cold stream near by.  This treatment may have answered with the early ailments of the"]]]
