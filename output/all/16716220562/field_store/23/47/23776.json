Prince Hath would know!  Meanwhile let me give you to drink, great stranger, let me get you something.\"  \"Well, then,\" I laughed, \"reach me down an antidote to fate, a specific for an absent mistress, and forgetful friends.\"  \"What was she like?\" said An, hesitating a little and frowning.  \"Nay, good friend,\" was my answer, \"what can that matter to you?\"  \"Oh, nothing, of course,\" answered that Martian, and while she took from the table a cup and filled it with fluid I felt in the pouch of my sword-belt to see if by chance a bit of money was lying there, but there was none, only the pips of an orange poor Polly had sucked and laughingly thrown at me.  However, it did not matter.  The girl handed me the cup, and I put my lips to it.  The first taste was bitter and acrid, like the liquor of long-steeped wood.  At the second taste a shiver of pleasure ran through me, and I opened my eyes and stared hard.  The third taste grossness and heaviness and chagrin dropped from my heart; all the complexion of Providence altered in a flash, and a stupid irresistible joy, unreasoning, uncontrollable took possession of my fibre.  I sank upon a mossy bank and, lolling my head, beamed idiotically on the lolling Martians all about me.  How long I was like that I cannot say. The heavy minutes of sodden contentment slipped by unnoticed, unnumbered, till presently I felt the touch of a wine-cup at my lips again, and drinking of another liquor dulness vanished from my mind, my eyes cleared, my heart throbbed; a fantastic gaiety seized upon my limbs; I bounded to my feet, and seizing An's two hands in mine, swung that damsel round in a giddy dance, capering as never dancer danced before, till spent and weary I sank down again from sheer lack of breath, and only knew thereafter that An was sitting by me saying, \"Drink! drink stranger, drink and forget!\" and as a third time a cup was pressed to my lips, aches and pleasures, stupidness and joy, life itself, seemed slipping away into a splendid golden vacuity, a hazy episode of unconscious Elysium, indefinite, and unfathomable.    CHAPTER V  When I woke, feeling as refreshed as though I had been dreaming through a long night, An, seeing me open-eyed, helped me to my feet, and when I had recovered my senses a little, asked if we should go on.  I was myself again by this time, so willingly took her hand, and soon came out of the tangle into the open spaces.  I must have been under the spell of the Martian wines longer than it seemed, for already it was late in the afternoon, the shadows of trees were lying deep and far-reaching over the motley crowds of people.  Out here as the day waned they had developed some sort of method in their sports.  In front of us was a broad, grassy course marked off with garlanded finger-posts, and in this space rallies of workfolk were taking part in all manner of games under the eyes of a great concourse of spectators, doing the Martians' pleasures for them as they did their labours.  An led me gently on, leaning on my arm heavier, I thought, than she had done in the morning, and ever and anon turning her gazelle-like eyes upon me with a look I could not understand.  As we sauntered forward I noticed all about lesser circles where the yellow-girted ones were drawing delighted laughter from good-tempered crowds by tricks of sleight-of-hand, and posturing, or tossing gilded cups and balls as though they were catering, as indeed they were, for outgrown children. Others fluted or sang songs in chorus to the slow clapping of hands, while others were doing I knew not what, sitting silent amongst silent spectators who every now and then burst out laughing for no cause that I could see.  But An would not let me stop, and so we pushed on through the crowd till we came to the main enclosures where a dozen slaves had run a race for the amusement of those too lazy to race themselves, and were sitting panting on the grass.  To give them time to get their breath, perhaps, a man stepped out of the crowd dressed in a dark blue tunic, a strange vacuous-looking fellow, and throwing down a sheaf of javelins marched off a dozen paces, then, facing round, called out loudly he would give sixteen suits of \"summer cloth\" to any one who could prick him with a javelin from the heap.  \"Why,\" I said in amazement, \"this is the best of fools--no one could miss from such a distance.\"  \"Ay but,\" replied my guide, \"he is a gifted one, versed in mystics.\"  I was just going to say a good javelin, shod with iron, was a stronger argument than any mystic I had ever heard of could stand, when out of the crowd stepped a youth, and amid the derisive cheers of his friends chose a reed from the bundle.  He poised it in his hand a minute to get the middle, then turned on the living target.  Whatever else they might be, these Martians were certainly beautiful as the daytime.  Never had I seen such a perfect embodiment of grace and elegance as that boy as he stood there for a moment poised to the throw; the afternoon sunshine warm and strong on his bunched brown hair, a girlish flush of shyness on his handsome face, and the sleek perfection of his limbs, clear cut against the dusky background beyond.  And now the javelin was going. Surely the mystic would think better of it at the last moment!  No! the initiate held his ground with tight-shut lips and retrospective eyes, and even as I looked the weapon flew upon its errand.  \"There goes the soul of a fool!\" I exclaimed, and as the words were uttered the spear struck, or seemed to, between the neck and shoulder, but instead of piercing rose high into the air, quivering and flashing, and presently turning over, fell back, and plunged deep into the turf, while a low murmur of indifferent pleasure went round amongst the onlookers.  Thereat An, yawning gently, looked to me and said, \"A strong-willed fellow, isn't he, friend?\"  I hesitated a minute and then asked, \"Was it WILL which turned that shaft?\"  She answered with simplicity, \"Why, of course--what else?\"  By this time another boy had stepped out, and having chosen a javelin, tested it with hand and foot, then retiring a pace or two rushed up to the throwing mark and flung it straight and true into the bared bosom of the man.  And as though it had struck a wall of brass, the shaft leapt back falling quivering at the thrower's feet.  Another and another tried unsuccessfully, until at last, vexed at their futility, I said, \"I have a somewhat scanty wardrobe that would be all the better for that fellow's summer suiting, by your leave I will venture a throw against him.\"  \"It is useless,\" answered An; \"none but one who knows more magic than he, or is especially befriended by the Fates can touch him through the envelope he has put on.\"  \"Still, I think I will try.\"  \"It is hopeless, I would not willingly see you fail,\" whispered the girl, with a sudden show of friendship.  \"And what,\" I said, bending down, \"would you give me if I succeeded?\" Whereat An laughed a little uneasily, and, withdrawing her hand from mine, half turned away.  So I pushed through the spectators and stepped into the ring.  I went straight up to the pile of weapons, and having chosen one went over to the mystic.  \"Good fellow,\" I cried out ostentatiously, trying the sharpness of the javelin-point with my finger, \"where are all of those sixteen summer suits of yours lying hid?\"  \"It matters nothing,\" said the man, as if he were asleep.  \"Ay, but by the stars it does, for it will vex the quiet repose of your soul tomorrow if your heirs should swear they could not find them.\"  \"It matters nothing,\" muttered the will-wrapped visionary.  \"It will matter something if I take you at your word.  Come, friend Purple-jerkin, will you take the council with your legs and run while there is yet time, or stand up to be thrown at?\"  \"I stand here immoveable in the confidence of my initiation.\"  \"Then, by thunder, I will initiate you into the mysteries of a javelin-end, and your blood be on your head.\"  The Martians were all craning their necks in hushed eagerness as I turned to the casting-place, and, poising the javelin, faced the magician. Would he run at the last moment?  I half hoped so; for a minute I gave him the chance, then, as he showed no sign of wavering, I drew my hand back, shook the javelin back till it bent like a reed, and hurled it at him.  The Martians' heads turned as though all on one pivot as the spear sped through the air, expecting no doubt to see it recoil as others had done. But it took him full in the centre of his chest, and with a wild wave of arms and a flutter of purple raiment sent him backwards, and down, and over and over in a shapeless heap of limbs and flying raiment, while a low murmur of awed surprise rose from the spectators. They crowded round him in a dense ring, as An came flitting to me with a startled face.  \"Oh, stranger,\" she burst out, \"you have surely killed him!\" but more astounded I had broken down his guard than grieved at his injury.  \"No,\" I answered smilingly; \"a sore chest he may have tomorrow, but dead he is not, for I turned the lance-point back as I spun it, and it was the butt-end I threw at him!\"  \"It was none the less wonderful; I thought you were a common man, a prince mayhap, come but from over the hills, but now something tells me you are more than that,\" and she lapsed into thoughtful silence for a time.  Neither of us were wishful to go back amongst those who were raising the bruised magician to his legs, but wandered away instead through the deepening twilight towards the city over meadows whose damp,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60490"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Second Year (#0)"],["body","(https://mormontextsproject.org/), with thanks to Rachel Helps and BYU Transcribe       The Seventy's Course in Theology  SECOND YEAR  Outline History of the Dispensations of the Gospel  Compiled and Edited by  B. H. ROBERTS  Of the First Council of the Seventy  \"The things of God are of deep import; and time and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thoughts can only find them out.\"--Joseph Smith.  Salt Lake City  1908    SEVENTY'S YEAR BOOK NO. II    INTRODUCTION.  The Seventy's Year Book No. II is a series of forty-four lessons on \"The Outline History of the Dispensations of the Gospel.\" As our Year Book No. I was a rapid survey of the whole body of scriptures recognized by the Church, so the present Year Book is a like rapid, general survey of the principle dispensations of the Gospel given to men upon this earth. As the survey of the scripture books was made for the purpose of forming a general idea of the books as a body of sacred literature, and that some idea might be learned of their essential unity; so this present outline survey of the chief dispensations of the Gospel is intended to give some general views of the Gospel not otherwise obtainable, and to fix in the mind of the student the idea of essential unity in the Gospel in all dispensations: Establishing the idea that there is but one Gospel; and that, the \"everlasting gospel;\" the same through all ages. That it was the plan devised in heaven before the foundations of the earth were laid, and will endure as a means of salvation so long as there are men to be saved.  _The Treatment of the Theme:_ The treatment of the theme is substantially the same as in Year Book No. I. That is to say, an analysis of the subject of the lesson is given, in which the lesson is subdivided under those heads into which the subject naturally falls. For the information, of the student texts and books are cited accompanying usually each subdivision of the subject and these references in every case should be carefully read so far as the books cited can be obtained by the student; and as the books to which citations in the main are made, the four books recognized by the Church as Holy Scripture, each Seventy student should have these. Accompanying each lesson are a series of notes, sometimes detached, but often, in this Year Book, they constitute a brief continuous treatise upon the subject in hand, which should be amplified by wide reading and deep study on the part of the student. In all cases where no citation of authorities is given at the close or in the body of the note, they are written by the compiler and editor or are taken from his works.  In this connection I would say a word in relation to the several les, sons which I have called \"A Prelude to the History of the Dispensations.\" It may be thought that these lessons are difficult, and deal with matters not necessary to the main subject. Of course the author of this Year Book holds a different view or the lessons would not be presented. To him the principles there developed are fundamental and essential to a right understanding of the Dispensations of the Gospel; and should not be omitted because they invite attention to lines of thought somewhat unusual to us in the study of the Gospel. It is the existence of these principles in our Theology that makes \"Mormonism\" a religion and not a mere sect. They constitute an essential part of the message we have for the world; and the ministry of the Church should master these subjects, though thinking upon them is unusual and the mastery of such themes is slowly acquired. Let it be remembered that \"The things of God are of deep import; and time and experience, and careful and ponderous and solemn thought can only find them out.\"  SCRIPTURE READING AND SPECIAL TEXTS:  Scripture Reading Exercises are to continue throughout the year, though Special Texts printed with each lesson are abandoned in this Year Book, as it is hoped that the advantage of collecting or noting special texts of the scripture, and striking passages from other choice literature, while reading, has been sufficiently demonstrated to now become a habit with those who read good books.  PREPARATION OF LESSONS.  In no case should it be regarded as a complete preparation of the lesson to merely glance over the analysis and read the notes. The lesson as constructed is merely to be regarded as an outline of the particular theme as the whole Year Book itself is to be looked upon as a mere outline tracing of the History of the Gospel in the successive ages through which it sweeps. The lessons indicate a method of treatment that may be followed; but original research by reading, consulting authorities, and thorough thinking should be employed in the preparation of the student; and the Year Book looked upon and used as merely a help and guide in this investigation.  What is said in the Introduction of Year Book, No. I, in relation to Class Teachers, Manner of Lesson Treatment, Home Reading, the Preparation of Lessons, Opening Exercises and Prayer, should be considered standing instructions to the Seventies through the ensuing year in their class meetings. And it will be well to consider these topics in the Introduction of Year Book No. I before beginning the exercises outlined in this year's work, that the minds of the class may be refreshed in those matters and the exercises and preparation work be made to conform to these instructions.  In addition to what is in the Introduction to Year Book No. I, we suggest that from observation of the class work during the past year, the Seventies have not reached the character of work that may be reasonably expected of them in treating topics of the lessons assigned to them. We have a right to expect that members of our quorums when assigned a lesson, or any part of it, will become such masters of the subject, at least of that part of it assigned to them, that they will be able to make an intelligent presentation of it, clear cut, with a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion to it; and something that will be an intelligent statement at least of the subject, instead of being through with an important topic by a two or three minute statement of it, of which half is apology or excuse. These topics certainly require a ten or fifteen or twenty minute exposition that shall be worth while. And while we would not be severe in our criticism of the past, or too demanding for the future, certainly it can reasonably be expected that Seventies will make some exertion that will give the results here alluded to. We want, in the first place, work; in the second place, work; in the third place, work; and then work; and more work; and better work. That program will spell success. There is no excellence without labor, and much of it.  TEXT BOOKS AND AUTHORITIES.  Relative to the text books. All of the books recommended in the Introduction of last year's course are available and necessary as authorities in this present year's course, and in addition to these works of reference, a good, General History will be of great service. That of P. V. N. Meyers, prepared for Colleges and High Schools, (Ginn & Company, Publishers, Boston) being perhaps the most desirable, price $1.50.  In the Apostatic division of our treatise, Part V, numerous references are made to Ecclesiastical histories and works of a theological character, some of which would be difficult to obtain, such as \"Mosheim's Institutes of Ecclesiastical History;\" Neander's \"History of the Christian Religion;\" Schaff's \"History of the Apostolic Church;\" Mosheim's \"History of Christianity in the First Three Centuries;\" Hefele's \"History of Christian Councils;\" \"Millman's History of Christianity in the First Three Centuries;\" Lardner's \"Works,\" and the like. But \"The Students Ecclesiastical History,\" written by Dr. Philip Smith, author of the \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament Histories,\" frequently quoted in Seventy's Year Book No. I, and in this, published by Harper Brothers in two volumes, (price $3.00), is within the reach of all; and on the whole is a very fine Compendium of Ecclesiastical History, quite dispassionate in tone, and generally trustworthy, and brings events down to the death of Luther, 1540.  Also there is in print the \"Ecclesiastical History\" by Eusebius Pamphilus. Bishop of Caesarea, covering the first three Christian centuries. Eusebius is generally styled the \"Father of Ecclesiastical History,\" and those who can obtain this authority are dealing with original sources of information. The work is translated from the Greek, and published and obtainable through any of our book stores. In this connection we urge our members to gradually obtain; but as soon as may be, these reference books, as no workman can get along without tools.  _The Improvement Era:_ We call attention also to the Improvement Era, the Organ of the Seventies and of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Associations, with its special Seventy's department, The Seventy's Council Table. This magazine affords the First Council opportunity to reach every quorum of Seventy once every month throughout the year--Twelve communications each year, of several pages of printed matter, bearing upon Seventies work;--suggestions in class work; dealing with questions of quorum administration; with questions of doctrine, and history, and exposition of the scriptures. How valuable an adjunct it has become in our work! We enjoin it upon our presidents that they see to it that all subjects in the Era of special interest to their several quorums be brought forth to said quorums by the Presidents, and read for the information of the quorum, that all may be benefited by the instruction. From reports made to the General Secretary, Elder J. G. Kimball, we learn that some two thousand Seventies take the Era, so that with each monthly issue of the Era we are in touch with that many individual Seventies. Many more of our members, however, should subscribe for this magazine,"]]]
