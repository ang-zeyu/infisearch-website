Figure to yourself that for the moment I had not thought of that! But there is plenty of time. The full of the moon, it is not until Friday.”  I shook my head dubiously. The full of the moon theory left me entirely cold. I had my way with Poirot, however, and we departed immediately, leaving behind us a note of explanation and apology for Lord Yardly.  My idea was to go at once to the _Magnificent_, and relate to Miss Marvell what had occurred, but Poirot vetoed the plan, and insisted that the morning would be time enough. I gave in rather grudgingly.  In the morning Poirot seemed strangely disinclined to stir out. I began to suspect that, having made a mistake to start with, he was singularly loath to proceed with the case. In answer to my persuasions, he pointed out, with admirable common sense, that as the details of the affair at Yardly Chase were already in the morning papers the Rolfs would know quite as much as we could tell them. I gave way unwillingly.  Events proved my forebodings to be justified. About two o’clock, the telephone rang. Poirot answered it. He listened for some moments, then with a brief “_Bien, j’y serai_” he rang off, and turned to me.  “What do you think, _mon ami_?” He looked half ashamed, half excited. “The diamond of Miss Marvell, it has been stolen.”  “What?” I cried, springing up. “And what about the ‘full of the moon’ now?” Poirot hung his head. “When did this happen?”  “This morning, I understand.”  I shook my head sadly. “If only you had listened to me. You see I was right.”  “It appears so, _mon ami_,” said Poirot cautiously. “Appearances are deceptive, they say, but it certainly appears so.”  As we hurried in a taxi to the _Magnificent_, I puzzled out the true inwardness of the scheme.  “That ‘full of the moon’ idea was clever. The whole point of it was to get us to concentrate on the Friday, and so be off our guard beforehand. It is a pity you did not realize that.”  “_Ma foi!_” said Poirot airily, his nonchalance quite restored after its brief eclipse. “One cannot think of everything!”  I felt sorry for him. He did so hate failure of any kind.  “Cheer up,” I said consolingly. “Better luck next time.”  At the _Magnificent_, we were ushered at once into the manager’s office. Gregory Rolf was there with two men from Scotland Yard. A pale-faced clerk sat opposite them.  Rolf nodded to us as we entered.  “We’re getting to the bottom of it,” he said. “But it’s almost unbelievable. How the guy had the nerve I can’t think.”  A very few minutes sufficed to give us the facts. Mr. Rolf had gone out of the hotel at 11.15. At 11.30, a gentleman, so like him in appearance as to pass muster, entered the hotel and demanded the jewel-case from the safe deposit. He duly signed the receipt, remarking carelessly as he did so: “Looks a bit different from my ordinary one, but I hurt my hand getting out of the taxi.” The clerk merely smiled and remarked that he saw very little difference. Rolf laughed and said: “Well, don’t run me in as a crook this time, anyway. I’ve been getting threatening letters from a Chinaman, and the worst of it is I look rather like a Chink myself—it’s something about the eyes.”  “I looked at him,” said the clerk who was telling us this, “and I saw at once what he meant. The eyes slanted up at the corners like an Oriental’s. I’d never noticed it before.”  “Darn it all, man,” roared Gregory Rolf, leaning forward, “do you notice it now?”  The man looked up at him and started.  “No, sir,” he said. “I can’t say I do.” And indeed there was nothing even remotely Oriental about the frank brown eyes that looked into ours.  The Scotland Yard man grunted. “Bold customer. Thought the eyes might be noticed, and took the bull by the horns to disarm suspicion. He must have watched you out of the hotel, sir, and nipped in as soon as you were well away.”  “What about the jewel-case?” I asked.  “It was found in a corridor of the hotel. Only one thing had been taken—‘the Western Star.’”  We stared at each other—the whole thing was so bizarre, so unreal.  Poirot hopped briskly to his feet. “I have not been of much use, I fear,” he said regretfully. “Is it permitted to see Madame?”  “I guess she’s prostrated with the shock,” explained Rolf.  “Then perhaps I might have a few words alone with you, monsieur?”  “Certainly.”  In about five minutes Poirot reappeared.  “Now, my friend,” he said gaily. “To a post office. I have to send a telegram.”  “Who to?”  “Lord Yardly.” He discounted further inquiries by slipping his arm through mine. “Come, come, _mon ami_. I know all that you feel about this miserable business. I have not distinguished myself! You, in my place, might have distinguished yourself! _Bien!_ All is admitted. Let us forget it and have lunch.”  It was about four o’clock when we entered Poirot’s rooms. A figure rose from a chair by the window. It was Lord Yardly. He looked haggard and distraught.  “I got your wire and came up at once. Look here, I’ve been round to Hoffberg, and they know nothing about that man of theirs last night, or the wire either. Do you think that——”  Poirot held up his hand.  “My excuses! I sent that wire, and hired the gentleman in question.”  “_You_—but why? What?” The nobleman spluttered impotently.  “My little idea was to bring things to a head,” explained Poirot placidly.  “Bring things to a head! Oh, my God!” cried Lord Yardly.  “And the ruse succeeded,” said Poirot cheerfully. “Therefore, _milord_, I have much pleasure in returning you—this!” With a dramatic gesture he produced a glittering object. It was a great diamond.  “The Star of the East,” gasped Lord Yardly. “But I don’t understand——”  “No?” said Poirot. “It makes no matter. Believe me, it was necessary for the diamond to be stolen. I promised you that it should be preserved to you, and I have kept my word. You must permit me to keep my little secret. Convey, I beg of you, the assurances of my deepest respect to Lady Yardly, and tell her how pleased I am to be able to restore her jewel to her. What _beau temps_, is it not? Good day, _milord_.”  And smiling and talking, the amazing little man conducted the bewildered nobleman to the door. He returned gently rubbing his hands.  “Poirot,” I said. “Am I quite demented?”  “No, _mon ami_, but you are, as always, in a mental fog.”  “How did you get the diamond.”  “From Mr. Rolf.”  “Rolf?”  “_Mais oui!_ The warning letters, the Chinaman, the article in _Society Gossip_, all sprang from the ingenious brain of Mr. Rolf! The two diamonds, supposed to be so miraculously alike—bah! they did not exist. There was only _one_ diamond, my friend! Originally in the Yardly collection, for three years it has been in the possession of Mr. Rolf. He stole it this morning with the assistance of a touch of grease paint at the corner of each eye! Ah, I must see him on the film, he is indeed an artist, _celui-là_!  “But why should he steal his own diamond?” I asked, puzzled.  “For many reasons. To begin with, Lady Yardly was getting restive.”  “Lady Yardly?”  “You comprehend she was left much alone in California. Her husband was amusing himself elsewhere. Mr. Rolf was handsome, he had an air about him of romance. But _au fond_, he is very business-like, _ce monsieur_! He made love to Lady Yardly, and then he blackmailed her. I taxed the lady with the truth the other night, and she admitted it. She swore that she had only been indiscreet, and I believe her. But, undoubtedly, Rolf had letters of hers that could be twisted to bear a different interpretation. Terrified by the threat of a divorce, and the prospect of being separated from her children, she agreed to all he wished. She had no money of her own, and she was forced to permit him to substitute a paste replica for the real stone. The coincidence of the date of the appearance of ‘the Western Star’ struck me at once. All goes well. Lord Yardly prepares to range himself—to settle down. And then comes the menace of the possible sale of the diamond. The substitution will be discovered. Without doubt she writes off frantically to Gregory Rolf who has just arrived in England. He soothes her by promising to arrange all—and prepares for a double robbery. In this way he will quiet the lady, who might conceivably tell all to her husband, an affair which would not suit our blackmailer at all, he will have £50,000 insurance money (aha, you had forgotten that!), and he will still have the diamond! At this point I put my finger in the pie. The arrival of a diamond expert is announced. Lady Yardly, as I felt sure she would, immediately arranges a robbery—and does it very well too! But Hercule Poirot, he sees nothing but facts. What happens in actuality? The lady switches off the light, bangs the door, throws the necklace down the passage, and screams. She has already wrenched out the diamond with pliers upstairs——”  “But we saw the necklace round her neck!” I objected.  “I demand pardon, my friend. Her hand concealed the part of it where the gap would have shown. To place a piece of silk in the door beforehand is child’s play! Of course, as soon as Rolf read of the robbery, he arranged his own little comedy. And very well he played it!”  “What did you say to him?” I asked with lively curiosity.  “I said to him that Lady Yardly had told her husband all, that I was empowered to recover the jewel, and that if it were not immediately handed over proceedings would be taken. Also a few more little lies which occurred to me. He was as wax in my hands!”  I pondered the matter.  “It seems a little unfair on Mary Marvell. She has lost her diamond through no fault of her own.”  “Bah!” said Poirot brutally. “She has a magnificent advertisement. That is all she cares for, that one! Now the other, she is different. _Bonne mère, très femme!_”  “Yes,” I said doubtfully, hardly sharing Poirot’s views on femininity. “I suppose it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/61262"],["title","Poirot Investigates (#4)"],["body"," Rolf who sent her the duplicate letters.”  “_Pas du tout_,” said Poirot briskly. “She came by the advice of Mary Cavendish to seek my aid in her dilemma. Then she heard that Mary Marvell, whom she knew to be her enemy, had been here, and she changed her mind, jumping at a pretext that _you_, my friend, offered her. A very few questions sufficed to show me that _you_ told her of the letters, not she you! She jumped at the chance your words offered.”  “I don’t believe it,” I cried, stung.  “_Si, si, mon ami_, it is a pity that you study not the psychology. She told you that the letters were destroyed? Oh, la la, _never_ does a woman destroy a letter if she can avoid it! Not even if it would be more prudent to do so!”  “It’s all very well,” I said, my anger rising, “but you’ve made a perfect fool of me! From beginning to end! No, it’s all very well to try and explain it away afterwards. There really is a limit!”  “But you were so enjoying yourself, my friend. I had not the heart to shatter your illusions.”  “It’s no good. You’ve gone a bit too far this time.”  “_Mon Dieu!_ but how you enrage yourself for nothing, _mon ami_!”  “I’m fed up!” I went out, banging the door. Poirot had made an absolute laughing-stock of me. I decided that he needed a sharp lesson. I would let some time elapse before I forgave him. He had encouraged me to make a perfect fool of myself!       II     The Tragedy at Marsdon Manor   I had been called away from town for a few days, and on my return found Poirot in the act of strapping up his small valise.  “_A la bonne heure_, Hastings. I feared you would not have returned in time to accompany me.”  “You are called away on a case, then?”  “Yes, though I am bound to admit that, on the face of it, the affair does not seem promising. The Northern Union Insurance Company have asked me to investigate the death of a Mr. Maltravers who a few weeks ago insured his life with them for the large sum of fifty thousand pounds.”  “Yes?” I said, much interested.  “There was, of course, the usual suicide clause in the policy. In the event of his committing suicide within a year the premiums would be forfeited. Mr. Maltravers was duly examined by the Company’s own doctor, and although he was a man slightly past the prime of life was passed as being in quite sound health. However, on Wednesday last—the day before yesterday—the body of Mr. Maltravers was found in the grounds of his house in Essex, Marsdon Manor, and the cause of his death is described as some kind of internal hæmorrhage. That in itself would be nothing remarkable, but sinister rumours as to Mr. Maltravers’ financial position have been in the air of late, and the Northern Union have ascertained beyond any possible doubt that the deceased gentleman stood upon the verge of bankruptcy. Now that alters matters considerably. Maltravers had a beautiful young wife, and it is suggested that he got together all the ready money he could for the purpose of paying the premiums on a life insurance for his wife’s benefit, and then committed suicide. Such a thing is not uncommon. In any case, my friend Alfred Wright, who is a director of the Northern Union, has asked me to investigate the facts of the case, but, as I told him, I am not very hopeful of success. If the cause of the death had been heart failure, I should have been more sanguine. Heart failure may always be translated as the inability of the local G.P. to discover what his patient really did die of, but a hæmorrhage seems fairly definite. Still, we can but make some necessary inquiries. Five minutes to pack your bag, Hastings, and we will take a taxi to Liverpool Street.”  About an hour later, we alighted from a Great Eastern train at the little station of Marsdon Leigh. Inquiries at the station yielded the information that Marsdon Manor was about a mile distant. Poirot decided to walk, and we betook ourselves along the main street.  “What is our plan of campaign?” I asked.  “First I will call upon the doctor. I have ascertained that there is only one doctor in Marsdon Leigh, Dr. Ralph Bernard. Ah, here we are at his house.”  The house in question was a kind of superior cottage, standing back a little from the road. A brass plate on the gate bore the doctor’s name. We passed up the path and rang the bell.  We proved to be fortunate in our call. It was the doctor’s consulting hour, and for the moment there were no patients waiting for him. Dr. Bernard was an elderly man, high-shouldered and stooping, with a pleasant vagueness of manner.  Poirot introduced himself and explained the purpose of our visit, adding that Insurance Companies were bound to investigate fully in a case of this kind.  “Of course, of course,” said Dr. Bernard vaguely. “I suppose, as he was such a rich man, his life was insured for a big sum?”  “You consider him a rich man, doctor?”  The doctor looked rather surprised.  “Was he not? He kept two cars, you know, and Marsdon Manor is a pretty big place to keep up, although I believe he bought it very cheap.”  “I understand that he had had considerable losses of late,” said Poirot, watching the doctor narrowly.  The latter, however, merely shook his head sadly.  “Is that so? Indeed. It is fortunate for his wife, then, that there is this life insurance. A very beautiful and charming young creature, but terribly unstrung by this sad catastrophe. A mass of nerves, poor thing. I have tried to spare her all I can, but of course the shock was bound to be considerable.”  “You had been attending Mr. Maltravers recently?”  “My dear sir, I never attended him.”  “What?”  “I understand Mr. Maltravers was a Christian Scientist—or something of that kind.”  “But you examined the body?”  “Certainly. I was fetched by one of the under-gardeners.”  “And the cause of death was clear?”  “Absolutely. There was blood on the lips, but most of the bleeding must have been internal.”  “Was he still lying where he had been found?”  “Yes, the body had not been touched. He was lying at the edge of a small plantation. He had evidently been out shooting rooks, a small rook rifle lay beside him. The hæmorrhage must have occurred quite suddenly. Gastric ulcer, without a doubt.”  “No question of his having been shot, eh?”  “My dear sir!”  “I demand pardon,” said Poirot humbly. “But, if my memory is not at fault, in the case of a recent murder, the doctor first gave a verdict of heart failure—altering it when the local constable pointed out that there was a bullet wound through the head!”  “You will not find any bullet wounds on the body of Mr. Maltravers,” said Dr. Bernard dryly. “Now, gentlemen, if there is nothing further——”  We took the hint.  “Good morning, and many thanks to you, doctor, for so kindly answering our questions. By the way, you saw no need for an autopsy?”  “Certainly not.” The doctor became quite apoplectic. “The cause of death was clear, and in my profession we see no need to distress unduly the relatives of a dead patient.”  And, turning, the doctor slammed the door sharply in our faces.  “And what do you think of Dr. Bernard, Hastings?” inquired Poirot, as we proceeded on our way to the Manor.  “Rather an old ass.”  “Exactly. Your judgments of character are always profound, my friend.”  I glanced at him uneasily, but he seemed perfectly serious. A twinkle, however, came into his eye, and he added slyly:  “That is to say, when there is no question of a beautiful woman!”  I looked at him coldly.  On our arrival at the manor-house, the door was opened to us by a middle-aged parlourmaid. Poirot handed her his card, and a letter from the Insurance Company for Mrs. Maltravers. She showed us into a small morning-room, and retired to tell her mistress. About ten minutes elapsed, and then the door opened, and a slender figure in widow’s weeds stood upon the threshold.  “Monsieur Poirot?” she faltered.  “Madame!” Poirot sprang gallantly to his feet and hastened towards her. “I cannot tell you how I regret to derange you in this way. But what will you? _Les affaires_—they know no mercy.”  Mrs. Maltravers permitted him to lead her to a chair. Her eyes were red with weeping, but the temporary disfigurement could not conceal her extraordinary beauty. She was about twenty-seven or eight, and very fair, with large blue eyes and a pretty pouting mouth.  “It is something about my husband’s insurance, is it? But must I be bothered _now_—so soon?”  “Courage, my dear Madame. Courage! You see, your late husband insured his life for rather a large sum, and in such a case the Company always has to satisfy itself as to a few details. They have empowered me to act for them. You can rest assured that I will do all in my power to render the matter not too unpleasant for you. Will you recount to me briefly the sad events of Wednesday?”  “I was changing for tea when my maid came up—one of the gardeners had just run to the house. He had found——”  Her voice trailed away. Poirot pressed her hand sympathetically.  “I comprehend. Enough! You had seen your husband earlier in the afternoon?”  “Not since lunch. I had walked down to the village for some stamps, and I believe he was out pottering round the grounds.”  “Shooting rooks, eh?”  “Yes, he usually took his little rook rifle with him, and I heard one or two shots in the distance.”  “Where is this little rook rifle now?”  “In the hall, I think.”  She led the way out of the room and found and handed the little weapon to Poirot, who examined it cursorily.  “Two shots fired, I see,” he observed, as he handed it back. “And now, madame, if I might see——”  He paused delicately.  “The servant shall take you,” she murmured, averting her head.  The parlourmaid, summoned, led Poirot upstairs. I remained with the lovely and unfortunate woman. It was hard to know whether to speak or remain silent. I essayed one or two general reflections to which she responded absently, and in a very few minutes Poirot rejoined us.  “I thank you for all your courtesy, madame. I do not think you need"]]]
