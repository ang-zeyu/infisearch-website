The troops on the west bank of the river had previously been assigned to my command.  McClernand having received the orders for his assignment reached the mouth of the Yazoo on the 2d of January, and immediately assumed command of all the troops with Sherman, being a part of his own corps, the 13th, and all of Sherman's, the 15th.  Sherman, and Admiral Porter with the fleet, had withdrawn from the Yazoo. After consultation they decided that neither the army nor navy could render service to the cause where they were, and learning that I had withdrawn from the interior of Mississippi, they determined to return to the Arkansas River and to attack Arkansas Post, about fifty miles up that stream and garrisoned by about five or six thousand men.  Sherman had learned of the existence of this force through a man who had been captured by the enemy with a steamer loaded with ammunition and other supplies intended for his command.  The man had made his escape. McClernand approved this move reluctantly, as Sherman says.  No obstacle was encountered until the gunboats and transports were within range of the fort.  After three days' bombardment by the navy an assault was made by the troops and marines, resulting in the capture of the place, and in taking 5,000 prisoners and 17 guns.  I was at first disposed to disapprove of this move as an unnecessary side movement having no especial bearing upon the work before us; but when the result was understood I regarded it as very important.  Five thousand Confederate troops left in the rear might have caused us much trouble and loss of property while navigating the Mississippi.  Immediately after the reduction of Arkansas Post and the capture of the garrison, McClernand returned with his entire force to Napoleon, at the mouth of the Arkansas River.  From here I received messages from both Sherman and Admiral Porter, urging me to come and take command in person, and expressing their distrust of McClernand's ability and fitness for so important and intricate an expedition.  On the 17th I visited McClernand and his command at Napoleon. It was here made evident to me that both the army and navy were so distrustful of McClernand's fitness to command that, while they would do all they could to insure success, this distrust was an element of weakness.  It would have been criminal to send troops under these circumstances into such danger.  By this time I had received authority to relieve McClernand, or to assign any person else to the command of the river expedition, or to assume command in person.  I felt great embarrassment about McClernand.  He was the senior major-general after myself within the department.  It would not do, with his rank and ambition, to assign a junior over him.  Nothing was left, therefore, but to assume the command myself.  I would have been glad to put Sherman in command, to give him an opportunity to accomplish what he had failed in the December before; but there seemed no other way out of the difficulty, for he was junior to McClernand.  Sherman's failure needs no apology.  On the 20th I ordered General McClernand with the entire command, to Young's Point and Milliken's Bend, while I returned to Memphis to make all the necessary preparation for leaving the territory behind me secure.  General Hurlbut with the 16th corps was left in command.  The Memphis and Charleston railroad was held, while the Mississippi Central was given up.  Columbus was the only point between Cairo and Memphis, on the river, left with a garrison.  All the troops and guns from the posts on the abandoned railroad and river were sent to the front.  On the 29th of January I arrived at Young's Point and assumed command the following day.  General McClernand took exception in a most characteristic way--for him.  His correspondence with me on the subject was more in the nature of a reprimand than a protest. It was highly insubordinate, but I overlooked it, as I believed, for the good of the service.  General McClernand was a politician of very considerable prominence in his State; he was a member of Congress when the secession war broke out; he belonged to that political party which furnished all the opposition there was to a vigorous prosecution of the war for saving the Union; there was no delay in his declaring himself for the Union at all hazards, and there was no uncertain sound in his declaration of where he stood in the contest before the country.  He also gave up his seat in Congress to take the field in defence of the principles he had proclaimed.  The real work of the campaign and siege of Vicksburg now began.  The problem was to secure a footing upon dry ground on the east side of the river from which the troops could operate against Vicksburg.  The Mississippi River, from Cairo south, runs through a rich alluvial valley of many miles in width, bound on the east by land running from eighty up to two or more hundred feet above the river.  On the west side the highest land, except in a few places, is but little above the highest water.  Through this valley the river meanders in the most tortuous way, varying in direction to all points of the compass.  At places it runs to the very foot of the bluffs. After leaving Memphis, there are no such highlands coming to the water's edge on the east shore until Vicksburg is reached.  The intervening land is cut up by bayous filled from the river in high water--many of them navigable for steamers.  All of them would be, except for overhanging trees, narrowness and tortuous course, making it impossible to turn the bends with vessels of any considerable length. Marching across this country in the face of an enemy was impossible; navigating it proved equally impracticable.  The strategical way according to the rule, therefore, would have been to go back to Memphis; establish that as a base of supplies; fortify it so that the storehouses could be held by a small garrison, and move from there along the line of railroad, repairing as we advanced, to the Yallabusha, or to Jackson, Mississippi.  At this time the North had become very much discouraged. Many strong Union men believed that the war must prove a failure.  The elections of 1862 had gone against the party which was for the prosecution of the war to save the Union if it took the last man and the last dollar.  Voluntary enlistments had ceased throughout the greater part of the North, and the draft had been resorted to to fill up our ranks.  It was my judgment at the time that to make a backward movement as long as that from Vicksburg to Memphis, would be interpreted, by many of those yet full of hope for the preservation of the Union, as a defeat, and that the draft would be resisted, desertions ensue and the power to capture and punish deserters lost. There was nothing left to be done but to go FORWARD TO A DECISIVE VICTORY.  This was in my mind from the moment I took command in person at Young's Point.  The winter of 1862-3 was a noted one for continuous high water in the Mississippi and for heavy rains along the lower river. To get dry land, or rather land above the water, to encamp the troops upon, took many miles of river front.  We had to occupy the levees and the ground immediately behind.  This was so limited that one corps, the 17th, under General McPherson, was at Lake Providence, seventy miles above Vicksburg.  It was in January the troops took their position opposite Vicksburg. The water was very high and the rains were incessant.  There seemed no possibility of a land movement before the end of March or later, and it would not do to lie idle all this time.  The effect would be demoralizing to the troops and injurious to their health.  Friends in the North would have grown more and more discouraged, and enemies in the same section more and more insolent in their gibes and denunciation of the cause and those engaged in it.  I always admired the South, as bad as I thought their cause, for the boldness with which they silenced all opposition and all croaking, by press or by individuals, within their control.  War at all times, whether a civil war between sections of a common country or between nations, ought to be avoided, if possible with honor.  But, once entered into, it is too much for human nature to tolerate an enemy within their ranks to give aid and comfort to the armies of the opposing section or nation.  Vicksburg, as stated before, is on the first high land coming to the river's edge, below that on which Memphis stands.  The bluff, or high land, follows the left bank of the Yazoo for some distance and continues in a southerly direction to the Mississippi River, thence it runs along the Mississippi to Warrenton, six miles below.  The Yazoo River leaves the high land a short distance below Haines' Bluff and empties into the Mississippi nine miles above Vicksburg.  Vicksburg is built on this high land where the Mississippi washes the base of the hill.  Haines' Bluff, eleven miles from Vicksburg, on the Yazoo River, was strongly fortified. The whole distance from there to Vicksburg and thence to Warrenton was also intrenched, with batteries at suitable distances and rifle-pits connecting them.  From Young's Point the Mississippi turns in a north-easterly direction to a point just above the city, when it again turns and runs south-westerly, leaving vessels, which might attempt to run the blockade, exposed to the fire of batteries six miles below the city before they were in range of the upper batteries.  Since then the river has made a cut-off, leaving what was the peninsula in front of the city, an island. North of the Yazoo was all a marsh, heavily timbered, cut up with bayous, and much overflowed.  A front attack was therefore impossible, and was never contemplated; certainly not by me. The problem then became, how to secure a landing on high ground east of the Mississippi without an apparent retreat.  Then commenced a series of experiments to consume time,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5862"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 3. (#8)"],["body","to divert the attention of the enemy, of my troops and of the public generally.  I, myself, never felt great confidence that any of the experiments resorted to would prove successful. Nevertheless I was always prepared to take advantage of them in case they did.  In 1862 General Thomas Williams had come up from New Orleans and cut a ditch ten or twelve feet wide and about as deep, straight across from Young's Point to the river below.  The distance across was a little over a mile.  It was Williams' expectation that when the river rose it would cut a navigable channel through; but the canal started in an eddy from both ends, and, of course, it only filled up with water on the rise without doing any execution in the way of cutting.  Mr. Lincoln had navigated the Mississippi in his younger days and understood well its tendency to change its channel, in places, from time to time.  He set much store accordingly by this canal.  General McClernand had been, therefore, directed before I went to Young's Point to push the work of widening and deepening this canal.  After my arrival the work was diligently pushed with about 4,000 men--as many as could be used to advantage--until interrupted by a sudden rise in the river that broke a dam at the upper end, which had been put there to keep the water out until the excavation was completed.  This was on the 8th of March.  Even if the canal had proven a success, so far as to be navigable for steamers, it could not have been of much advantage to us.  It runs in a direction almost perpendicular to the line of bluffs on the opposite side, or east bank, of the river.  As soon as the enemy discovered what we were doing he established a battery commanding the canal throughout its length.  This battery soon drove out our dredges, two in number, which were doing the work of thousands of men.  Had the canal been completed it might have proven of some use in running transports through, under the cover of night, to use below; but they would yet have to run batteries, though for a much shorter distance.  While this work was progressing we were busy in other directions, trying to find an available landing on high ground on the east bank of the river, or to make water-ways to get below the city, avoiding the batteries.  On the 30th of January, the day after my arrival at the front, I ordered General McPherson, stationed with his corps at Lake Providence, to cut the levee at that point.  If successful in opening a channel for navigation by this route, it would carry us to the Mississippi River through the mouth of the Red River, just above Port Hudson and four hundred miles below Vicksburg by the river.  Lake Providence is a part of the old bed of the Mississippi, about a mile from the present channel.  It is six miles long and has its outlet through Bayou Baxter, Bayou Macon, and the Tensas, Washita and Red Rivers.  The last three are navigable streams at all seasons.  Bayous Baxter and Macon are narrow and tortuous, and the banks are covered with dense forests overhanging the channel.  They were also filled with fallen timber, the accumulation of years.  The land along the Mississippi River, from Memphis down, is in all instances highest next to the river, except where the river washes the bluffs which form the boundary of the valley through which it winds.  Bayou Baxter, as it reaches lower land, begins to spread out and disappears entirely in a cypress swamp before it reaches the Macon.  There was about two feet of water in this swamp at the time.  To get through it, even with vessels of the lightest draft, it was necessary to clear off a belt of heavy timber wide enough to make a passage way.  As the trees would have to be cut close to the bottom--under water--it was an undertaking of great magnitude.  On the 4th of February I visited General McPherson, and remained with him several days.  The work had not progressed so far as to admit the water from the river into the lake, but the troops had succeeded in drawing a small steamer, of probably not over thirty tons' capacity, from the river into the lake.  With this we were able to explore the lake and bayou as far as cleared.  I saw then that there was scarcely a chance of this ever becoming a practicable route for moving troops through an enemy's country.  The distance from Lake Providence to the point where vessels going by that route would enter the Mississippi again, is about four hundred and seventy miles by the main river.  The distance would probably be greater by the tortuous bayous through which this new route would carry us.  The enemy held Port Hudson, below where the Red River debouches, and all the Mississippi above to Vicksburg. The Red River, Washita and Tensas were, as has been said, all navigable streams, on which the enemy could throw small bodies of men to obstruct our passage and pick off our troops with their sharpshooters.  I let the work go on, believing employment was better than idleness for the men. Then, too, it served as a cover for other efforts which gave a better prospect of success.  This work was abandoned after the canal proved a failure.  Lieutenant-Colonel Wilson of my staff was sent to Helena, Arkansas, to examine and open a way through Moon Lake and the Yazoo Pass if possible. Formerly there was a route by way of an inlet from the Mississippi River into Moon Lake, a mile east of the river, thence east through Yazoo Pass to Coldwater, along the latter to the Tallahatchie, which joins the Yallabusha about two hundred and fifty miles below Moon Lake and forms the Yazoo River.  These were formerly navigated by steamers trading with the rich plantations along their banks; but the State of Mississippi had built a strong levee across the inlet some years before, leaving the only entrance for vessels into this rich region the one by way of the mouth of the Yazoo several hundreds of miles below.  On the 2d of February this dam, or levee, was cut.  The river being high the rush of water through the cut was so great that in a very short time the entire obstruction was washed away. The bayous were soon filled and much of the country was overflowed. This pass leaves the Mississippi River but a few miles below Helena. On the 24th General Ross, with his brigade of about 4,500 men on transports, moved into this new water-way. The rebels had obstructed the navigation of Yazoo Pass and the Coldwater by felling trees into them.  Much of the timber in this region being of greater specific gravity than water, and being of great size, their removal was a matter of great labor; but it was finally accomplished, and on the 11th of March Ross found himself, accompanied by two gunboats under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Watson Smith, confronting a fortification at Greenwood, where the Tallahatchie and Yallabusha unite and the Yazoo begins.  The bends of the rivers are such at this point as to almost form an island, scarcely above water at that stage of the river.  This island was fortified and manned.  It was named Fort Pemberton after the commander at Vicksburg.  No land approach was accessible.  The troops, therefore, could render no assistance towards an assault further than to establish a battery on a little piece of ground which was discovered above water.  The gunboats, however, attacked on the 11th and again on the 13th of March.  Both efforts were failures and were not renewed.  One gunboat was disabled and we lost six men killed and twenty-five wounded. The loss of the enemy was less.  Fort Pemberton was so little above the water that it was thought that a rise of two feet would drive the enemy out.  In hope of enlisting the elements on our side, which had been so much against us up to this time, a second cut was made in the Mississippi levee, this time directly opposite Helena, or six miles above the former cut.  It did not accomplish the desired result, and Ross, with his fleet, started back. On the 22d he met Quinby with a brigade at Yazoo Pass.  Quinby was the senior of Ross, and assumed command.  He was not satisfied with returning to his former position without seeing for himself whether anything could be accomplished.  Accordingly Fort Pemberton was revisited by our troops; but an inspection was sufficient this time without an attack.  Quinby, with his command, returned with but little delay.  In the meantime I was much exercised for the safety of Ross, not knowing that Quinby had been able to join him.  Reinforcements were of no use in a country covered with water, as they would have to remain on board of their transports.  Relief had to come from another quarter.  So I determined to get into the Yazoo below Fort Pemberton.  Steel's Bayou empties into the Yazoo River between Haines' Bluff and its mouth.  It is narrow, very tortuous, and fringed with a very heavy growth of timber, but it is deep.  It approaches to within one mile of the Mississippi at Eagle Bend, thirty miles above Young's Point. Steel's Bayou connects with Black Bayou, Black Bayou with Deer Creek, Deer Creek with Rolling Fork, Rolling Fork with the Big Sunflower River, and the Big Sunflower with the Yazoo River about ten miles above Haines' Bluff in a right line but probably twenty or twenty-five miles by the winding of the river.  All these waterways are of about the same nature so far as navigation is concerned, until the Sunflower is reached; this affords free navigation.  Admiral Porter explored this waterway as far as Deer Creek on the 14th of March, and reported it navigable.  On the next day he started with five gunboats and four mortar-boats.  I went with him for some distance. The heavy overhanging timber retarded progress very much, as did also the short turns in so narrow a stream.  The gunboats, however, ploughed their way through without other damage than to their appearance.  The transports did not fare so well although they followed behind. The road was somewhat cleared for them by the gunboats.  In the evening I"]]]
