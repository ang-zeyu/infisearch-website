The latter, seeing his one chance, wrenched his partially released arm forward and caught it round Blaine's legs as he stumbled.  At the same time this double movement somehow operated to release Fritz's other arm.  By now, Orris, unconscious of the mischief his own upward shove had caused, sheered his machine aside, still climbing upward and onward, only to find three of the enemy scouts nearing rapidly and making ready for an encounter.  Looking back, he saw, in the place of Blaine's leather cap and goggles, a dimly shimmering twinkle of arms and legs flashing above the rim of the open enclosure where the pilots sit.  \"Great guns!\" he ejaculated, his blood tingling with thrills.  \"That chap has got loose and they're having it.  What must I do?\"  Even while these thoughts were flashing, he was working.  He dared not turn to Blaine's relief.  He did not know yet if the sheaf thrown him would fit his own machine gun.  But first he must dip, circle, come up underneath and try his luck.  As has been said, Orry was no novice.  He had flown at the front for months as one of the Lafayette Escadrille.  Before that he had worked his way up in aerial mechanics in the United States and also here in France.  Even while diving, circling, swirling in mid air, ten thousand feet up, he was adjusting the new sheaf to his own gun.  Happily it fitted.  That was a good sign, and pirouetting, not unlike an expert dancer executing a new turn, he dove aside and came up fairly behind the nearest Boche.  Without hesitation he began to spray the enemy with a shower of their own bullets.  It was indeed lucky the new cartridges fitted.  It was merely one blunder committed by the extra efficient Germans in converting British weapons to their own use.  Evidently the ammunition dealt out to the Death's Head Squadron was of the best.  It was intentionally so.  Another proof of this lay in the fact that the German plane thus attacked fell sideways, recovered, plunged half staggering away, while a tiny spark of flame became visible to Erwin as he sheered aside in the opposite direction and prepared for a new onset from above by the second plane.  So far as he could see, the other plane was making for Blaine's machine that still flow the Death's Head Flag.  Yet it was acting strangely as seen from a distance by the Boches, who might or might not be posted as to the strange change of its ownership.  The second plane, rendered more cautious by the fate of the first, which was now descending a mass of flames, began a series of divings, wrigglings, and even nose dips, in its efforts to confuse Erwin and find a good position from which to shower the daring invader with bullets.  On his own part Orris went through the usual maneuvers customary when two airmen, both skillful, are seeking the advantage of the other. Well it was for the young man that his own Bleriot was one of the best of the up-to-date fighting planes.  Numerous shots were taken on both sides, and in the excitement f or the moment Orris lost all sight of the fate of his partner.  At last, in trying by a desperate and perilous maneuver, to \"get on the tail\" of his adversary by a side-loop in mid-flight, the Boche pilot, while upside down, came for an instant fairly within range.  Quickly Orris took his advantage.  He was above and to the right of the German, and with a single whirl of his Lewis gun brought it fully in line with the Boche's head as he sat head down, strapped in his seat, while his machine was swiftly turning in its side evolution so as to bring him in the rear of his enemy.  \"Now!\" gasped Orris, beginning his bullet spray.  \"Help me, Mars!\"  A queer prayer, but it was quickly answered.  The German machine righted more slowly, however.  Erwin dove swiftly down and came upright in the rear of his now swaying adversary.  Then the lad saw what fate had done for him.  The German had collapsed in his seat, to which, as has been said, he had strapped himself.  His head lay on the rim, apparently a mass of streaming crimson.  His machine, a renovated Fokker, was tipsily zigzagging along without any guidance except its stabilizer and its own momentum.  To say the boy was half paralyzed at first is not too strong.  But a revulsion swept through him in a flood.  At the same time there came to his brain a vivid flash, reminding him that while thus desperately engaged for his own life, he had heard sounds of aerial battling somewhere in his rear.  While he was making up his mind what to do next, the whir of speeding motors rose rapidly.  Looking back, he saw the Death's Head flag waving from the nearest one and soon distinguished Blaine, apparently all right, but chugging away at top speed in Erwin's direction.  Just now the Fokker with its dead occupant gave another side drop and, uninfluenced by the usual controls, came nearly to a standstill.  It toppled again, then down it went earthward at increasing speed, carrying its occupant along.  \"Hey-you!\"  This from Blaine as he swept up and by, while rounding to. \"Look behind!  I dropped that chap -- the first one!  But he's brought a lot of others.  Let's make for home, boy!\"  Apparently it was too late without a further scrimmage, for no less than half a dozen Boche planes were swooping around their rear, some already within range.  In maneuvering into position Blaine again picked up his megaphone, saying:  \"I saw you drop those chaps.  Oh, you Orry!  Here we go -- right for some more of them!  Whoopee!\"  It seemed little short of blasphemy -- this uproarious spirit, in the face of the odds gathering in behind.  But Blaine was built that way. Danger, the closer and more menacing, instead of rousing fear, nerved him to his best or, as it might turn out, worst.  \"Where's your prisoner?\" shouted Erwin.  \"I feared he'd get you.\"  \"Nit, old man!  I got hold of a monkey-wrench and knocked him cold. But he was game, you bet!\"  \"Where is he then?\"  \"Cold and stiff under my feet.  Watch out, Orry!\"  Megaphones cast aside, both Americans now addressed themselves to the desperate task of fighting these new assailants and reaching their own lines.  But in the first firing that ensued Erwin's Lewis gun suddenly jammed. This was probably one result of his having to use the German-made ammunition tossed to him earlier by Blaine, when his own had been exhausted.  He signaled to his partner:  \"Gun jammed!  Must cut for home -- understand?\"  \"All right!  Go up - up -\"  A burst of flame from Blaine's machine, and the toppling down of the nearest adversary was the first result of this new encounter. Evidently that flag waving from Blaine's captured plane had fooled the Boches again.  Down, down went the hostile machine, its pilot frantically but ineffectually trying to right himself.  Passing Erwin, the latter saw the Boche, evidently a mere lad, working at the controls as the plane dropped down like a dead leaf in the air.  \"Poor fellow,\" sighed Orris, beginning to spiral upward.  \"What a deadly cruel thing war now is!\"  Up, up he climbed, two of the enemy following, while Blaine was engaging another, the last.  The final view Erwin had of his bunkie the two were engaged in a close duel, dipping, darting, flashing about each other.  Now came interchanging machine gun fire, with both gradually following Erwin higher, higher, until the latter began to feel that the thin air of these upper regions was getting on his nerves.  A glance at his own register showed eighteen thousand feet or thereabouts.  Still his adversaries climbed after him. Now and then a spurt of flame and a spatter of bullets indicated that his own plane was being more or less perforated.  The lad became doubtful as to the wisdom of waiting longer for his comrade.  Evidently Blaine would fight on as long as his ammunition lasted or until disabled himself.  After all, two hostile planes dropped and the third one brought home with its occupant was not a bad conclusion for a night's bombing raid on the enemy trenches.  Here a sudden, fierce gust of wind from the north catching him unawares half tilted his machine and then as he righted it sent him scurrying at terrific speed southward.  At the same time a black cloud, belching and flaming thunder and lightning, swept down on him with almost the force of a hurricane.      CHAPTER IV  WINNING PROMOTIONS  Looking back, Orris saw his nearest foe, apparently caught by the same whirlwind that had nearly unseated him, go side-looping over and over as if in the grasp of mighty, invisible forces that he was unable to meet or control.  \"It's safety first, I guess, for us all,\" he thought, at once diving into the nearing thunder burst that closed round him like a black pall, a pall now threaded and convulsed with electric forces that showed only in vivid flashes and deafening thunders.  The winds, too, picked him up, whirled him about and otherwise so tossed his machine here, there, yonder, that for five fearful minutes he hardly knew where or what he was.  The wind, now bitter cold, would have frozen his flesh but for his sheathing of wool and leather that protected his face, arms and body.  Blinding gusts of rain, sleet and frozen snow buffeted the planes, the shield of the fuselage, and all of himself that was visible.  By this time Blaine, the German planes, his own late adversary, had all vanished.  He was alone, like a buffeted, tossed, shaken twig, in that wild vortex of darkness and storm.  With his machine gun jammed and his petrol running low, what was there for him to do but descend and make for the home aerodrome?  \"Might as well,\" he reflected.  \"We've already overstayed our time.\"  Pointing gently downwards, he suffered himself to drift.  That is, if one in the midst of a blinding storm and seated in a war-plane may be supposed to drift.  Rather it was being tossed about, constant vigilance at the controls alone"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6082"],["title","Our Pilots in the Air (#4)"],["body"," his plane from literally flopping over and somersaulting here and there, like a dead leaf.  Then without warning he felt the machine dropping down, down, down. Yet the planes were level and the whole natural resisting power of the machine was at its usual operation.  \"By George!  This storm has made an air cave underneath.  I must get busy.\"  Another twist of the levers and the plane jumped forward, for the first time feeling no resistance of the storm.  And, while he was glancing around for more light, out he shot like an arrow from a bow into the clear sunlight, the earth near -- too near, in fact.  Back of him the storm clouds were whisking themselves away so rapidly that the transition was almost staggering.  And below -- what was it he now saw?  For answer, almost before his own mind had sensed the change, there came the spatter of Archies by the dozen and the menacing roar of machine guns, sheltered here and there over the scraggy plain within the pill-boxes that have of late been substituted for the vanishing trench lines.  Artillery bombardments by the Allies have so devastated certain regions that trenches have become impossible; hence the concrete pillboxes.  \"Lucky I've some gasoline left,\" thought Erwin, surprised but not unduly alarmed.  \"It's a race now between me and the bullets.\"  Instantly he put on high speed, at the same time rising in zigzags while the bombardment continued increasingly.  Right ahead, however, he saw what looked like a communicating underground trench; and at certain intervals were openings.  These openings revealed to him a blurring, moving mass, muddy gray, yet with glints here and there as of some substance brighter.  Closer yet he flew, regardless of safety.  His air tabulator was not working.  That was a sign that he was within two to three hundred feet of the earth. All at once something flashed out from this moving mass that presently disappeared underground again.  Archie had momentarily stopped.  But an unmistakable whistle of lead was accompanied by a metallic puncture below.  The bullet hit the near end of his petrol tank almost at his knee.  Now he knew.  \"Lordy!\" he palpitated.  \"That's too near!\"  Already his fingers were twisting the speed accelerator, while up went the nose of his machine. Still the Archies spake not, but the spat, spat, spat of real rifle bullets followed his retreat.  Just then his hand, feeling below, came in contact with the hand grenades which he had forgotten amid the excitement of his later flight.  Ahead rose a swell of land that he knew terminated in a bluff abutting upon one of the smaller streams of that region.  This underground trench, evidently dug at great cost of labor and life, went straight for that bluff.  Their own aerodrome lay only a few miles opposite.  By actual and repeated reconnaissance both from below and in the air, this bluff was considered as deserted, or held at most by a very small force.  This was owing to its supposed isolation.  Evidently Erwin had just made a great discovery.  At least he hoped so.  On he flew.  His machine was hit in many places, principally the wings, the tail and along the under side of the fuselage.  Through this had come the ball that nearly perforated the tank.  There was one more opening ahead and then the trench sank out of sight near the base of the low bluff.  Orry's hand closed over the first grenade.  He was really an expert bomb-thrower.  At great risk he dipped gradually until, when about at the point overhead he desired, he threw two bombs in swift succession.  Then-up, up rapidly.  With all the power of his engine he climbed, while two sharp explosions sounded from below.  Had the lad looked down he would have seen the trench walls at the open space crumble inward, while the mass of moving gray appeared to disintegrate, to vanish for the time being.  But with the throwing of the bombs, Erwin had other work on hand. Archie had broken loose again.  One larger molded shot ripped through the tail of the Bleriot, ricocheted obliquely and hit that same tank again, but with more force.  His head lowered, the lad saw what had been done.  More than that he saw what impended.  The petrol was low.  Being under fire, at any moment a stray shot might ignite what little was left.  Pointing the machine still more upward, he seized a bunch of loose lint, used to sop up recurring leaks here and there, and with a handy screw driver he managed to stop the rent in the metal with a few sharp adroit punchings.  Again to the machine, now over and beyond the bluffs; over the crinkling muddy stream, now almost overflowing its banks.  On the bluff behind a squad of men in gray were training one of the Archies that had been dragged up from somewhere underneath.  \"I've got to give her all the head she'll take,\" he thought.  \"That gun will get me if they understand their business.\"  Over beyond the stream a low embankment rose well up at perhaps three to f our hundred yards from its first bank.  Erwin was rising in a steep climb, zigzagging crazily for the machine was giving out, owing to lack of fuel.  But he made a last effort to thus dodge the rain of bullets that began to pelt upon him from the rear.  Another larger gun came up.  Both joined in firing.  A shell splinter struck his shoulder, tearing loose the leather garment, while a searing, hot agony seized him, paralyzing his left arm.  He was over the second embankment when the final crisis came.  Were these foes or friends that were popping up, pointing weapons at those behind?  Friends surely!  Down he had better go.  The pain was so acute that only one arm was now at his service, while the dizziness that accompanies the pain of severe gun wounds filled his brain, dimmed his eyes, palsied his last despairing effort to land somehow behind that sheltering embankment.  Just then came a last explosion close behind.  He seemed to be going down, down -- where?  Then a terrific shock, and all consciousness left him.  The shock seemed to drive from him all notion of anything or anybody.  He knew nothing, nothing - nothing --  When at last Orris Erwin again knew that he was in the land of the living he was in a base hospital behind the front, and not far from his own aerodrome.  His shoulder was in bandages.  His left arm was in splints, but not painful.  What seemed to be other bandages swathed his lower legs.  Altogether he felt himself to be in pretty bad shape.  Then appeared Sergeant Anson who, seeing that Erwin was now awake and sensible, paused, a dry grin upon his weather-worn visage.  \"Huh!  Where's that Bleriot you or Blaine were to bring back?\"  But the smile that accompanied this was not condemnatory by any means.  \"I stuck to it, sir, long as I could stick to anything.  How do I happen to be trussed up this way here?\"  For a first reply the Sergeant threw back his head and gave vent to a real laugh.  Then he patted Orry's curly head gently.  \"You'll know in due time, youngster!  Where's your pilot, Lafe Blaine?\"  \"Isn't Blaine back, too, and in that Death's Head Boche plane he -- we took from them back of their lines?  As for the Bleriot, I was in it last I remember.\"  Here the door of the ward opened, and who should walk in but Blaine himself, with Monsieur Cheval following.  Cheval wore upon his breast a silver medal resembling nothing so much as an ace.  For a wonder Blaine himself wore a tricolor ribbon with a tiny gold cross that Erwin was sure he had never seen his athletic countryman have before.  At sight of Erwin's pale face and rather fragile form, now animated with conversational fire and energy, the big American turned to his French comrade, saying:  \"There, my friend!  Did I not tell you that our brave little comrade would be more like himself today than he has been any time these ten days?  Say little one,\" bending over Orry affectionately, \"have you got over that nasty spell yet?  Ha -- I guess so!\"  \"Where's that Bleriot the Sergeant said we must bring back?  I was in it when -- when the Boches or -- or the devil got me.\"  \"That Bleriot, like yourself, mon comrade, is in the hospital; that is, the repair shop.\"  This from Monsieur Cheval, still wearing his right arm in a sling, though now divested of splints.  \"Oh!\"  A flash of dim recollection came to Orry for a moment, \"I kind of remember.  First there was a bluff, with what looked like a communicating trench, in spots.  Just as if most of it was covered.  I dropped some bombs I had left on the moving gray something I saw. After that I skimmed over the bluff.  Then there was a stream, and another embankment beyond.  After that I don't seem to remember much. How did I get here?\"  \"You got here, Orry, because the Boches downed you right over our front trench at this angle, which is nearer the Boche line than anywhere in this sector.  We didn't even know that the enemy had dug a covered trench to the far side of the bluff on the river bank until you let us know by dropping bombs on them.  This so angered them that they dragged out two Archies and peppered you good.  You fell into our trench, and - and with the knowledge you gave us we directed our heavy artillery right on that bluff.  Here Blaine grinned complacently while patting Orry's head again, very gently though, on account of the bandages.  \"Yes, mon comrade,\" supplemented Cheval.  \"It was to you that our batteries owe their accuracy of firing in dealing with that bluff.  Do, you know that they must have been digging there for days, perhaps weeks?  The whole interior had been hollowed out, and there was a picked battalion stationed there.  La, la!  It was a lucky accident that led you in my own good Bleriot to lay open to us the secrets of those over yonder, who are trying to enslave the world.\"  \"But -- but I didn't know,\" murmured Erwin gratified, yet somehow feeling as if honors were being heaped gratuitously on his undeserving head.   Something of this escaped him the while.  Monsieur Cheval held up a"]]]
