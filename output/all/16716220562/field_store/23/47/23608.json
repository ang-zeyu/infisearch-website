I    lead such a funny life, utterly without interest or pleasure outside    of my work: nothing, indeed, but work all day long, except a short    walk alone on the cold hills, and meals, and a couple of pipes with my    father in the evening.  It is surprising how it suits me, and how    happy I keep.'     \"This is the serenity which arises, not from the absence of fuliginous    elements in the character, but from a potent smoke-consuming faculty,    and an inflexible will to use it.  Nine years later he thus admonishes    his backsliding parent:     \"'MY DEAR MOTHER,--I give my father up.  I give him a parable: that    the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the tragic    _Life_.  And he takes it back-side foremost, and shakes his head, and    is gloomier than ever.  Tell him that I give him up.  I don't want no    such a parent.  This is not the man for my money.  I do not call that    by the name of religion which fills a man with bile.  I write him a    whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, and telling him that his    gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an answer--.  Perish the    thought of it.     \"'Here am I on the threshold of another year, when, according to all    human foresight, I should long ago have been resolved into my    elements: here am I, who you were persuaded was born to disgrace    you--and, I will do you the justice to add, on no such insufficient    grounds--no very burning discredit when all is done; here am I    married, and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of the first    order.  A1 at Lloyd's.  There is he, at his not first youth, able to    take more exercise than I at thirty-three, and gaining a stone's    weight, a thing of which I am incapable.  There are you; has the man    no gratitude? . . .     \"'Even the Shorter Catechism, not the merriest epitome of religion,    and a work exactly as pious although not quite so true as the    multiplication table--even that dry-as-dust epitome begins with a    heroic note.  What is man's chief end?  Let him study that; and ask    himself if to refuse to enjoy God's kindest gifts is in the spirit    indicated.'     \"As may be judged from this half-playful, half-serious remonstrance,    Stevenson's relation to his parents was eminently human and beautiful.    The family dissensions above alluded to belonged only to a short but    painful period, when the father could not reconcile himself to the    discovery that the son had ceased to accept the formulas of Scottish    Calvinism.  In the eyes of the older man such heterodoxy was for the    moment indistinguishable from atheism; but he soon arrived at a better    understanding of his son's position.  Nothing appears more    unmistakably in these letters than the ingrained theism of Stevenson's    way of thought.  The poet, the romancer within him, revolted from the    conception of formless force.  A personal deity was a necessary    character in the drama, as he conceived it.  And his morality, though    (or inasmuch as) it dwelt more on positive kindness than on negative    lawlessness, was, as he often insisted, very much akin to the morality    of the New Testament.\"  Anyway it is clear that much in the interminglings of blood we _can_ trace, may go to account for not a little in Stevenson.  His peculiar interest in the enormities of old-time feuds, the excesses, the jealousies, the queer psychological puzzles, the desire to work on the outlying and morbid, and even the unallowed and unhallowed, for purposes of romance--the delight in dealing with revelations of primitive feeling and the out-bursts of the mere natural man always strangely checked and diverted by the uprise of other tendencies to the dreamy, impalpable, vague, weird and horrible.  There was the undoubted Celtic element in him underlying what seemed foreign to it, the disregard of conventionality in one phase, and the falling under it in another--the reaction and the retreat from what had attracted and interested him, and then the return upon it, as with added zest because of the retreat.  The confessed Hedonist, enjoying life and boasting of it just a little, and yet the Puritan in him, as it were, all the time eyeing himself as from some loophole of retreat, and then commenting on his own behaviour as a Hedonist and Bohemian.  This clearly was not what most struck Beerbohm Tree, during the time he was in close contact with Stevenson, while arranging the production of _Beau Austin_ at the Haymarket Theatre, for he sees, or confesses to seeing, only one side, and that the most assertive, and in a sense, unreal one:     \"Stevenson,\" says Mr Tree, \"always seemed to me an epicure in life.  He    was always intent on extracting the last drop of honey from every    flower that came in his way.  He was absorbed in the business of the    moment, however trivial.  As a companion, he was delightfully witty;    as a personality, as much a creature of romance as his own creations.\"  This is simple, and it looks sincere; but it does not touch 'tother side, or hint at, not to say, solve the problem of Stevenson's personality.  Had he been the mere Hedonist he could never have done the work he did.  Mr Beerbohm Tree certainly did not there see far or all round.  Miss Simpson says:     \"Mr Henley recalls him to Edinburgh folk as he was and as the true    Stevenson would have wished to be known--a queer, inexplicable    creature, his Celtic blood showing like a vein of unknown metal in the    stolid, steady rock of his sure-founded Stevensonian pedigree.  His    cousin and model, 'Bob' Stevenson, the art critic, showed that this    foreign element came from the men who lit our guiding lights for    seamen, not from the gentle-blooded Balfours.     \"Mr Henley is right in saying that the gifted boy had not much humour.    When the joke was against himself he was very thin-skinned and had a    want of balance.  This made him feel his honest father's sensible    remarks like the sting of a whip.\"  Miss Simpson then proceeds to say:     \"The R. L. Stevenson of old Edinburgh days was a conceited,    egotistical youth, but a true and honest one: a youth full of fire and    sentiment, protesting he was misunderstood, though he was not.  Posing    as 'Velvet Coat' among the slums, he did no good to himself.  He had    not the Dickens aptitude for depicting the ways of life of his adopted    friends.  When with refined judgment he wanted a figure for a novel,    he went back to the Bar he scorned in his callow days and then drew in    _Weir of Hermiston_.\"     CHAPTER V--TRAVELS   His interest in engineering soon went--his mind full of stories and fancies and human nature.  As he had told his mother: he did not care about finding what was \"the strain on a bridge,\" he wanted to know something of human beings.  No doubt, much to the disappointment and grief of his father, who wished him as an only son to carry on the traditions of the family, though he had written two engineering essays of utmost promise, the engineering was given up, and he consented to study law.  He had already contributed to College Magazines, and had had even a short spell of editing one; of one of these he has given a racy account.  Very soon after his call to the Bar articles and essays from his pen began to appear in _Macmillan's_, and later, more regularly in the _Cornhill_.  Careful readers soon began to note here the presence of a new force.  He had gone on the _Inland Voyage_ and an account of it was in hand; and had done that tour in the Cevennes which he has described under the title _Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes_, with Modestine, sometimes doubting which was the donkey, but on that tour a chill caught either developed a germ of lung disease already present, or produced it; and the results unfortunately remained.  He never practised at the Bar, though he tells facetiously of his one brief.  He had chosen his own vocation, which was literature, and the years which followed were, despite the delicacy which showed itself, very busy years.  He produced volume on volume.  He had written many stories which had never seen the light, but, as he says, passed through the ordeal of the fire by more or less circuitous ways.  By this time some trouble and cause for anxiety had arisen about the lungs, and trials of various places had been made.  _Ordered South_ suggests the Mediterranean, sunny Italy, the Riviera.  Then a sea-trip to America was recommended and undertaken.  Unfortunately, he got worse there, his original cause of trouble was complicated with others, and the medical treatment given was stupid, and exaggerated some of the symptoms instead of removing them, All along--up, at all events, to the time of his settlement in Samoa--Stevenson was more or less of an invalid.  Indeed, were I ever to write an essay on the art of wisely \"laying-to,\" as the sailors say, I would point it by a reference to R. L. Stevenson. For there is a wise way of \"laying-to\" that does not imply inaction, but discreet, well-directed effort, against contrary winds and rough seas, that is, amid obstacles and drawbacks, and even ill-health, where passive and active may balance and give effect to each other.  Stevenson was by native instinct and temperament a rover--a lover of adventure, of strange by-ways, errant tracts (as seen in his _Inland Voyage_ and _Travels with a Donkey through the Cevennes_--seen yet more, perhaps, in a certain account of a voyage to America as a steerage passenger), lofty mountain- tops, with stronger air, and strange and novel surroundings.  He would fain, like Ulysses, be at home in foreign lands, making acquaintance with outlying races, with              \"Cities of men,    And manners, climates, councils, governments:    Myself not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],["title","Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#7)"],["body","east, but honoured of them all,    Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\"  If he could not move about as he would, he would invent, make fancy serve him instead of experience.  We thus owe something to the staying and restraining forces in him, and a wise \"laying-to\"--for his works, which are, in large part, finely-healthy, objective, and in almost everything unlike the work of an invalid, yet, in some degree, were but the devices to beguile the burdens of an invalid's days.  Instead of remaining in our climate, it might be, to lie listless and helpless half the day, with no companion but his own thoughts and fancies (not always so pleasant either, if, like Frankenstein's monster, or, better still like the imp in the bottle in the _Arabian Nights_, you cannot, once for all liberate them, and set them adrift on their own charges to visit other people), he made a home in the sweeter air and more steady climate of the South Pacific, where, under the Southern Cross, he could safely and beneficially be as active as he would be involuntarily idle at home, or work only under pressure of hampering conditions.  That was surely an illustration of the true \"laying-to\" with an unaffectedly brave, bright resolution in it.     CHAPTER VI--SOME EARLIER LETTERS   Carlyle was wont to say that, next to a faithful portrait, familiar letters were the best medium to reveal a man.  The letters must have been written with no idea of being used for this end, however--free, artless, the unstudied self-revealings of mind and heart.  Now, these letters of R. L. Stevenson, written to his friends in England, have a vast value in this way--they reveal the man--reveal him in his strength and his weakness--his ready gift in pleasing and adapting himself to those with whom he corresponded, and his great power at once of adapting himself to his circumstances and of humorously rising superior to them.  When he was ill and almost penniless in San Francisco, he could give Mr Colvin this account of his daily routine:     \"Any time between eight and half-past nine in the morning a slender    gentleman in an ulster, with a volume buttoned into the breast of it,    maybe observed leaving No. 608 Bush and descending Powell with an    active step.  The gentleman is R. L. Stevenson; the volume relates to    Benjamin Franklin, on whom he meditates one of his charming essays.  He    descends Powell, crosses Market, and descends in Sixth on a branch of    the original Pine Street Coffee-House, no less. . . . He seats himself    at a table covered with waxcloth, and a pampered menial of High-Dutch    extraction, and, indeed, as yet only partially extracted, lays before    him a cup of coffee, a roll, and a pat of butter, all, to quote the    deity, very good.  A while ago, and R. L. Stevenson used to find the    supply of butter insufficient; but he has now learned the art to    exactitude, and butter and roll expire at the same moment.  For this    rejection he pays ten cents, or fivepence sterling (0 pounds 0s. 5d.).     \"Half an hour later, the inhabitants of Bush Street observed the same    slender gentleman armed, like George Washington, with his little    hatchet, splitting kindling, and breaking coal for his fire.  He does    this quasi-publicly upon the window-sill; but this is not to be    attributed to any love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his    prowess with the hatchet (which he persists in calling an axe), and    daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers.  The reason is    this: That the sill is a strong supporting beam, and that blows of the    same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the entire shanty    into hell.  Thenceforth, for from three hours, he is engaged darkly    with an ink-bottle.  Yet he is not blacking his boots, for the only    pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre, and wear the natural    hue of the material turned up with caked and venerable slush.  The    youngest child of his landlady remarks several times a day, as this    strange occupant enters or quits the house, 'Dere's de author.'  Can    it be that this bright-haired innocent has found the true clue to the    mystery?  The being in question is, at least, poor enough to belong to    that honourable craft.\"  Here are a few letters belonging to the winter of 1887-88, nearly all written from Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks, celebrated by Emerson, and now a most popular holiday resort in the United States, and were originally published in _Scribner's Magazine_. . . \"It should be said that, after his long spell of weakness at Bournemouth, Stevenson had gone West in search of health among the bleak hill summits--'on the Canadian border of New York State, very unsettled and primitive and cold.'  He had made the voyage in an ocean tramp, the _Ludgate Hill_, the sort of craft which any person not a born child of the sea would shun in horror. Stevenson, however, had 'the finest time conceivable on board the \"strange floating menagerie.\"'\"  Thus he describes it in a letter to Mr Henry James:     \"Stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo; and the vast    continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a haystack; and    the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion, looking through the port    at our dinner-table, and winked when the crockery was broken; and the    little monkeys stared at each other in their cages, and were thrown    overboard like little bluish babies; and the big monkey, Jacko,    scoured about the ship and rested willingly in my arms, to the ruin of    my clothing; and the man of the stallions made a bower of the black    tarpaulin, and sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity, like a    picture on a box of chocolates; and the other passengers, when they    were not sick, looked on and laughed.  Take all this picture, and make    it roll till the bell shall sound unexpected notes and the fittings    shall break loose in our stateroom, and you have the voyage of the    _Ludgate Hill_.  She arrived in the port of New York without beer,    porter, soda-water, curacoa, fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet we    lived, and we regret her.\"  He discovered this that there is no joy in the Universe comparable to life on a villainous ocean tramp, rolling through a horrible sea in company with a cargo of cattle.     \"I have got one good thing of my sea voyage; it is proved the sea    agrees heartily with me, and my mother likes it; so if I get any    better, or no worse, my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month or    so in the summer.  Good Lord! what fun!  Wealth is only useful for two    things: a yacht and a string quartette.  For these two I will sell my    soul.  Except for these I hold that 700 pounds a year is as much as    anybody can possibly want; and I have had more, so I know, for the    extra coins were of no use, excepting for illness, which damns    everything.  I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have    believed it possible; we had the beastliest weather, and many    discomforts; but the mere fact of its being a tramp ship gave us many    comforts.  We could cut about with the men and officers, stay in the    wheel-house, discuss all manner of things, and really be a little at    sea.  And truly there is nothing else.  I had literally forgotten what    happiness was, and the full mind--full of external and physical    things, not full of cares and labours, and rot about a fellow's    behaviour.  My heart literally sang; I truly care for nothing so much    as for that.     \"To go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier among the    holiday yachtsmen--that's fame, that's glory--and nobody can take it    away.\"  At Saranac Lake the Stevensons lived in a \"wind-beleaguered hill-top hat- box of a house,\" which suited the invalid, but, on the other hand, invalided his wife.  Soon after getting there he plunged into _The Master of Ballantrae_.     \"No thought have I now apart from it, and I have got along up to page    ninety-two of the draught with great interest.  It is to me a most    seizing tale: there are some fantastic elements, the most is a dead    genuine human problem--human tragedy, I should say rather.  It will be    about as long, I imagine, as _Kidnapped_. . . . I have done most of    the big work, the quarrel, duel between the brothers, and the    announcement of the death to Clementina and my Lord--Clementina,    Henry, and Mackellar (nicknamed Squaretoes) are really very fine    fellows; the Master is all I know of the devil; I have known hints of    him, in the world, but always cowards: he is as bold as a lion, but    with the same deadly, causeless duplicity I have watched with so much    surprise in my two cowards.  'Tis true, I saw a hint of the same    nature in another man who was not a coward; but he had other things to    attend to; the Master has nothing else but his devilry.\"  His wife grows seriously ill, and Stevenson has to turn to household work.     \"Lloyd and I get breakfast; I have now, 10.15, just got the dishes    washed and the kitchen all clean, and sit down to give you as much    news as I have spirit for, after such an engagement.  Glass is a thing    that really breaks my spirit; and I do not like to fail, and with    glass I cannot reach the work of my high calling--the artist's.\"  In the midst of such domestic tasks and entanglements he writes _The Master_, and very characteristically gets dissatisfied with the last parts, \"which shame, perhaps degrade, the beginning.\"  Of Mr Kipling this is his judgment--in the year 1890:     \"Kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared    since--ahem--I appeared.  He amazes me by his precocity and various    endowments.  But he alarms me by his copiousness and haste.  He should    shield his fire with both hands, 'and draw up all his strength and    sweetness in one ball.'  ('Draw all his strength and all his sweetness    up into one ball'?  I cannot remember Marvell's"]]]
