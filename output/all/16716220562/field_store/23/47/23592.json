The very spirit of your life there would be all against study.\"  \"I agree with that,\" said Mr. Forbes, decidedly. \"I vote for the girls having an entire holiday. Lessons each day would spoil all their fun.\"  \"They couldn't do it,\" Trudy said. \"I know, however much they tried, they just COULDN'T study in that atmosphere.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Bernice. \"We're not young ladies, like you, Trudy. We won't be going to parties, and such things. We can only go to the shops and the exhibitions and for motor rides in the park and such things. We could study evenings, I'm sure.\"  \"It isn't only the lessons,\" Mrs. Fayre said; \"but I can't feel quite willing to let my little girl go away for a week without me.\" Her pleasant smile at Mr. Forbes robbed the words of any reflection they might seem to cast on his brother's invitation. \"I'm sure Mrs. Berry would do all that is necessary in the way of a chaperon's duties, but these girls are pretty young even for that. They need a parent's oversight.\"  Mrs. Fayre was about to say a mother's oversight, when she remembered that Bernice had no mother, and changed the words accordingly.  There was some further discussion, and then Mrs. Fayre said she must have a little time alone to make up her mind. She knew that if Dolly did not go, Maisie May would be asked in her place, but she still felt undecided. She asked for only an hour or two to think it over, and promised to telephone directly after dinner, and tell Mr. Forbes her final decision. This was the only concession she would make. If not acceptable then her answer must be no.  \"Please do not judge my wife too harshly,\" said Mr. Fayre as he accompanied Mr. Forbes and Bernice to the door. \"She still looks upon Dolly as her baby, and scarcely lets her out of her sight.\"  \"That's all right,\" returned Mr. Forbes. \"She's the right sort of a mother for the girl. I hope she will decide to let Dolly go, but if not, I quite understand her hesitancy, and I respect and admire her for it. Bernice can take somebody else, and I trust you will not try over hard to influence Mrs. Fayre in Dolly's favour. If anything untoward should happen, I should never forgive myself. I would far rather the children were disappointed than to have Mrs. Fayre persuaded against her better judgment.\"  The Forbeses departed, and then Dotty Rose went home, too.  \"Oh, Dollyrinda,\" she whispered as they stood in the hall, \"do you s'pose your mother'll EVER say yes?\"  \"I don't believe so,\" replied Dolly mournfully. \"But, oh, Dot, how I do want to go! Seems 'sif I never wanted anything so much in all my life!\"  \"You don't want to go a bit more than I want to have you. Why, Dollops, I shan't go, if you don't.\"  \"Oh, yes, you will, Dotty. You must. It would be silly not to.\"  \"But I couldn't! I just COULDN'T. Do you s'pose I could have one single bit of fun going to places without you? And knowing you were here at home, longing to be with us! No-sir-ee! I just couldn't pos-SIB-ly! So just you remember that, old girl; no Dolly,--no Dotty! And that's SURE!\"  There was a ring in Dotty's voice that proclaimed an unshakable determination, and Dolly knew it. She knew that no coaxing of Bernice or even of Dolly herself, could make Dotty go without her chum.  For chums these two were, in the deepest sense of the word. They were together all that was possible during their waking hours. They studied together, worked and played together, and occupied together their little house, built for them, and called Treasure House.  Dolly knew she couldn't enjoy going anywhere without Dotty, and she knew Dot felt the same way about her. But this was such a big, splendid opportunity, that she hated to have Dotty miss it, even if she couldn't go herself. The two girls said good-night, and Dolly went back to her family in the library.  \"I hate terribly to disappoint you, Dolly darling,\" began her mother, and the tears welled up in Dolly's blue eyes. This beginning meant a negative decision, that was self evident, but Dolly Fayre was plucky by nature and she was not the sort that whines at disappointment.  \"All right,\" she said, striving to be cheerful, and blinking her eyes quickly to keep those tears back.  \"Now, look here, Edith,\" said Mr. Fayre, \"I don't believe I can stand this. I don't differ with you regarding the children, but I do think you might let Dolly go on this party. Even if it does take a week out of school, she'll get enough general information and experience from a week in the city to make up.\"  \"That's just it, Will. But the experiences she gets there may not be the best possible for a little girl of fifteen.\"  \"Oh, fifteen isn't an absolute baby. Remember, dear, Dolly is going to grow up some day, and she's getting started.\"  \"And another thing. I asked Mr. Forbes a few questions while you were talking to Bernice, and it seems this other girl, the niece, Alicia, is attending a very fashionable girls' boarding school.\"  \"Well, what of that? You speak as if she were attending a lunatic asylum!\"  \"No; but can't you see if Dolly goes to stay a week with wealthy Bernice Forbes and this fashionable Alicia, she'll get her head full of all sorts of notions that don't belong there?\"  \"No, I won't, mother,\" murmured Dolly, who, again on her mother's arm chair, was looking earnestly into the maternal blue eyes, so like her own. And very lovingly Mrs. Fayre returned the gaze, for she adored her little daughter and was actuated only by the best motives in making her decisions.  \"And, here's another thing,\" said Dolly, \"Dot won't go, if I don't. It seems too bad to spoil HER fun.\"  \"Oh, yes, she will,\" said Mrs. Fayre, smiling. \"She would be foolish to give up her pleasure just because you can't share it.\"  \"Foolish or not, she won't go,\" repeated Dolly. \"I know my Dot, and when she says she won't do a thing, she just simply doesn't do it!\"  \"I'd be sorry to be the means of keeping Dotty at home,\" and Mrs. Fayre sighed deeply.     CHAPTER II  A FAVOURABLE DECISION   All through dinner time, Mrs. Fayre was somewhat silent, her eyes resting on Dolly with a wistful, uncertain expression. She wanted to give the child the pleasure she craved, but she had hard work to bring herself to the point of overcoming her own objections.  At last, however, when the meal was nearly over, she smiled at her little daughter, and said, \"All right, Dolly, you may go.\"  \"Oh, mother!\" Dolly cried, overwhelmed with sudden delight. \"Really? Oh, I am so glad! Are you sure you're willing?\"  \"I've persuaded myself to be willing, against my will,\" returned Mrs. Fayre, whimsically. \"I confess I just hate to have you go, but I can't bear to deprive you of the pleasure trip. And, as you say, it would also keep Dotty at home, and so, altogether, I think I shall have to give in.\"  \"Oh, you angel mother! You blessed lady! How good you are!\" And Dolly flew around the table and gave her mother a hug that nearly suffocated her.  \"There, there, Dollygirl,\" said her father, \"go back and finish your pudding while we talk this over a bit. Are you sure, Edith, you are willing? I don't want you to feel miserable and anxious all the week Dolly is cut loose from your apron string.\"  \"No, Will; it's all right. If you and the Roses and Trudy, here, all agree it's best for Dolly to go, it seems foolish for me to object. And it may be for her good, after all.\"  \"That's what I say, mother,\" put in Trudy. \"Doll isn't a child, exactly. She's fifteen and a half, and it will be a fine experience for her to see a little bit of the great world. And she couldn't do it under better conditions than at Mr. Forbes' brother's. The Forbes' are a fine family, and you know, perfectly well, there'll be nothing there that isn't just exactly right.\"  \"It isn't that, Trudy. But,--oh, I don't know; I daresay I'm a foolish mother bird, afraid of her littlest fledgling.\"  \"You're a lovely mother-bird!\" cried Dolly, \"and not foolish a bit! but, oh, do decide positively, for I can't wait another minute to tell Dot, if I'm going.\"  \"Very well,\" said Mrs. Fayre, \"run along and tell Dotty, and Bernice, too.\"  Dolly made a jump and two hops for the telephone, and soon the wires must have bent under the weight of joyous exclamations.  \"Oh, Dolly, isn't it fine!\"  \"Oh, Dotty, it's splendid! I can hardly believe it!\"  \"Have you told Bernice?\"  \"Not yet. Had to tell you first. When do we go?\"  \"Next Tuesday, I think. Now, you tell Bernie, so she can write to her uncle that we accept.\"  And then there was another jubilation over the telephone.  \"Fine!\" cried Bernice, as she heard the news. \"Lovely! I'd so much rather have you two girls than any others. I'll write Uncle Jeff to-night that I'll bring you. And I'll come over to-morrow, and we'll decide what clothes to take, and all that.\"  Mrs. Fayre sighed, as Dolly reported this conversation.  \"You girls can't do a bit of serious study all the rest of the time before you go,\" she said. \"Now, Dolly, I'll have to ask you to do your lessons every day, before you plan or talk over the trip at all.\"  \"Yes, mother, I will,\" and Dolly started at once for her schoolbooks.  It was hard work to put her mind on her studies, with the wonderful possibilities that lay ahead of her. But she was exceedingly conscientious, was Dolly Fayre, and she resolutely put the subject of the New York visit out of her mind, and did her algebra examples with diligence.  Not so, Dotty Rose. After Dolly's telephone message, she flung her schoolbooks aside, with a shout of joy, and declared she couldn't study that night.  \"I don't wonder,\" laughed her father. \"Why, Dot, you're going on a veritable Fairy-tale visit. You are quite justified in being excited over it.\"  \"I thought you and Dolly didn't like Bernice Forbes very much,\" said Mrs. Rose.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5893"],["title","Two Little Women on a Holiday (#2)"],["body","\"We didn't use to, mother. But lately, she's been a whole lot nicer. You know Doll made her sort of popular, and after that, she helped along, herself, by being ever so much more pleasant and chummy with us all. She used to be stuck up and disagreeable; ostentatious about being rich, and all that. But nowadays, she's more simple, and more agreeable every way.\"  \"That's nice,\" observed Mr. Rose. \"Forbes is not a popular man, nor a very good citizen; I mean he isn't public-spirited or generous. But he's a fine business man and a man of sound judgment and integrity. I'm glad you're chums with his daughter, Dotty. And you ought to have a perfectly gorgeous time on the New York visit.\"  \"Oh, we will, Daddy; I'm sure of that. What about clothes, Mumsie?\"  \"I'll have to see about that. You'll need a few new frocks, I suppose, but we can get them ready made, or get Miss Felton to come for a few days. There's nearly a week before you start.\"  \"I want some nice things,\" declared Dotty. \"You know Bernice has wonderful clothes, and I suppose her cousin has, too.\"  \"Maybe your wardrobe can't be as fine as a rich man's daughter,\" said her father smiling at her, \"but I hope mother will fix you up so you won't feel ashamed of your clothes.\"  \"I think they'll be all right,\" and Mrs. Rose nodded her head. \"I'll see Mrs. Fayre to-morrow, and we'll find out what Bernice is going to take with her. You children can't need elaborate things, but they must be right.\"  The Rose family spent the entire evening talking over the coming trip, and when Dotty went to bed she set an alarm clock, that she might rise early in the morning to do her lessons for the day before breakfast. She did them, too, and came to the table, smiling in triumph.  \"Did all my examples and learned my history perfectly,\" she exulted. \"So you see, mother, my trip won't interfere with my education!\"  \"Oh, you can make up your lessons,\" said her father, carelessly. \"I wouldn't give much for a girl who couldn't do a few extra tasks to make up for a grand outing such as you're to have.\"  \"I either!\" agreed Dotty. \"But the Fayres are worried to death for fear Doll will miss a lesson somewhere.\"  \"Dolly learns more slowly than you,\" remarked her mother. \"You have a gift for grasping facts quickly, and a good memory to retain them.\"  \"You ought to be grateful for that,\" said Mr. Rose.  \"I am,\" returned Dotty. \"When I see Dolly grubbing over her history, I can't understand how she can be so long over it.\"  \"But she's better in mathematics than you are.\"  \"Yes, she is. She helps me a lot with the old puzzlers. She thinks we'll study in New York. But somehow, I don't believe we will.\"  \"Of course, you won't,\" laughed Mr. Rose. \"Why, you'd be foolish to do that. A fine opportunity has come to you girls, and I advise you to make the most of it. See all the sights you can; go to all the pleasant places you can; and have all the fun you can cram into your days. Then go to sleep and rest up for the next day.\"  \"Good, sound advice, Dads,\" said Dotty; \"you're a gentleman and a scholar to look at it like that! But I don't know as we can go about much; I believe Mr. Forbes is quite an old man, and who will take us about?\"  \"I thought the housekeeper would,\" said Mrs. Rose.  \"I don't know at all, mother. It seems Bernie has never visited there before, though she has been to the house. Her uncle is queer, and why he wants his two nieces all of a sudden, and his two nieces' friends, nobody knows. It's sort of mysterious, I think.\"  \"Well, it's all right, as long as you're properly invited. It seems strange Bernie's cousin didn't care to take a friend.\"  \"Yes; I wonder what she's like. Bernice hasn't seen her since they were little girls. She lives out in Iowa, I think. She's at school in Connecticut somewhere. It's all sort of unknown. But I like that part of it. I love new experiences.\"  \"I always do too, Dot,\" said her father. \"I reckon when you come home, you'll have lots to tell us.\"  \"New York isn't so strange to me,\" said Dotty. \"I've been there a lot of times, you know. But to go and stay in a house there,--that's the fun. It's so different from going in for a day's shopping with mother. Or the day we all went to the Hippodrome.\"  \"You'll probably go to the Hippodrome again, or some such entertainment,\" suggested Mrs. Rose.  \"I dunno. I imagine the old gentleman doesn't favour such gaiety. And the housekeeper lady will likely be too busy to do much for us. We can't go anywhere alone, can we?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Mrs. Rose. \"You must be guided by circumstances, Dotty. Whatever Mr. Forbes and Mrs. Berry say for you to do, will be all right. Make as little trouble as you can, and do as you're told. You'll have fun enough, just being with the girls.\"  \"Indeed I will! Oh, I'm so glad Dolly can go. I wouldn't have stirred a step without her!\"  \"No, I know you wouldn't,\" agreed her mother.  Next day at school recess, Bernice showed the girls a letter she had received from Alicia.  \"You know I haven't seen her in years,\" Bernice said; \"I think she must be more grown up than we are, though she's only just sixteen.\"  \"Dearest Bernice:\" the letter ran.  \"Isn't it simply screaming that we're to camp out at Uncle Jeff's! I'm wildly excited over it! Do you know why he has asked us? I'm not sure, myself, but I know there's a reason, and it's a secret. I heard aunt and father talking about it when I was home at Christmas time, but when I drifted into the room, they shut up like clams. However, we'll have one gay old time! Think of being in New York a whole week! I don't want to take any of the girls from here, for fear they'd bring back tales. Don't you bring anybody you can't trust. Oh, I've laid lots of plans, but I won't tell you about them till I see you. Bring all your best clothes, and ask your father for quite a lot of money, though I suppose Uncle Jeff will give us some. I can scarcely wait for the time to come!                          \"Devotedly yours, \"ALICIA.\"  \"What does she mean by a secret reason for your going?\" asked Dolly.  \"I haven't an idea,\" replied Bernice. \"My father knows, though, I'm quite sure, 'cause he smiled at that part of Alicia's letter. But he wouldn't tell me. He only said, 'Oh, pshaw, nothing of any consequence. It's very natural that a lonely old bachelor uncle should want to see his little girl nieces, and it's very kind and thoughtful of him to ask you to bring friends.' He says Uncle Jeff is not fond of company, and spends all his time by himself. He's a scientist or naturalist or something, and works in his study all day. So, dad says, it'll be fine for us girls to have four of us to be company for each other.\"  \"It's gorgeous!\" sighed Dotty, in an ecstasy of anticipation. \"But what does your cousin mean by bringing a lot of money? We can't do that,--and our parents don't let us spend much money ourselves, anyway.\"  \"Oh, that'll be all right,\" said Bernice, carelessly. \"We won't need much money. And if we go to matinees, or anything like that, of course, I'll pay, if Uncle Jeff doesn't. You two girls are my guests, you know. You needn't take any money at all.\"  \"All right,\" said Dolly, and dismissed the subject. Money did not figure very largely in her affairs, as, except for a small allowance for trifles, she never handled any. Nor did Dotty, as these two were still looked upon as children by their parents.  But motherless Bernice bought her own clothes and paid her own bills; and so generous was her father, that there was no stint, and as a consequence, she too, cared and thought little about money as a consideration.  \"I'm a little scared of that Alicia person,\" said Dolly to Dotty as they walked home from school.  \"Pooh! I'm not. She's no richer than Bernie.\"  \"It isn't that. I'm not afraid of rich people. But she seems so grown up and--well, experienced.\"  \"Well, sixteen is grown up. And we're getting there, Dolly. I shall put up my hair while I'm in New York.\"  \"Why, Dot Rose! Really?\"  \"Yes, that is if Alicia does. Bernice often does, you know.\"  \"I know it. I'll ask mother if I may.\"  \"Goodness, Dolly, can't you decide a thing like that for yourself? What would your mother care?\"  \"I'd rather ask her,\" returned the conscientious Dolly.  Mrs. Fayre smiled when Dolly put the question. \"I've been expecting that,\" she said. \"You'd better do as the others do, dear. If they twist up their pigtails, you do the same.\"  \"I'll show you how,\" offered Trudy. \"If you're going to do it, you may as well learn a becoming fashion.\"  So Trudy taught her little sister how to coil up her yellow, curly mop in a correct fashion, and very becoming it was to Dolly.  But it made her look a year or two older than she was.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed her mother, when she saw her, \"Where's my baby? I've lost my little girl!\"  \"Just as well,\" said Dolly, delighted at her achievement and pirouetting before a mirror. \"It's time I began to be a little grown up, mother.\"  \"Yes, I suppose it is. I felt just the same when Trudy put up her curls for the first time. I am a foolish old thing!\"  \"Now, don't you talk like that,\" cried Dolly, \"or I'll pull down my hair and wear it in tails till I'm fifty!\"  \"No, dear; do as you like about it. And, if you want to wear it that way while you're in New York, do. It's all right.\"  More discussions came with the new dresses. Mrs. Fayre was for keeping to the more youthful models, but Mrs. Hose felt that the girls should have slightly older styles. Bernice's frocks were almost young ladyish, but those were not copied.  Dotty and Dolly always had their things similar, different in colouring but alike in style. So their respective mothers had many confabs before the grave questions were settled.  And the result was two very attractive wardrobes that were really right for fifteen-year-old girls. Afternoon dresses of voile or thin silk, and one pretty party dress for each of dainty chiffon and lace. Morning frocks of linen and a tailored street suit"]]]
