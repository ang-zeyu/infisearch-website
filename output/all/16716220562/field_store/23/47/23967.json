I have flown at Rheims and Vienna and in the south. It is absurd for you to compete with me.\"  \"Personally I should like to see an American carry off the trophy, but if the best flyer wins I shall be quite satisfied,\" was Frank's quiet reply.  \"You will see the colors of La Belle France floating over my aerodrome after the race,\" was the rejoinder.  \"We shall see,\" was Frank's quiet answer, as the Frenchman strode off toward the village, where he usually remained gossiping in the hotel and complacently receiving the adulations of his admirers till late at night.  \"Ach, he is as goot-natured as a caged lion, dot feller!\" came a sudden exclamation behind the boys.  They turned about and faced old August Schmidt, the German aviator, who had started his career as a builder and operator of dirigibles, but was entered in the Hempstead Cup race as the flyer of a monoplane of his own design; and which, on account of its peculiar appearance, the crowds had already nicknamed the Grasshopper. As if in furtherance of this idea the German had painted his queer craft a bright green.  \"Vell, you boys have a good chance for der cup got,\" the old man went on, between puffs at an enormous pipe with a china bowl that formed his inseparable companion when he was not in the air.  \"Do you think so?\" asked Frank.  \"Ches, I do. Der Grasshopper is a goot leedle monoplane, but I am afraid dat some of der principles I have worked oud in her iss all wrong. Some day I break mein neck by der outside I am afraid much.\"  \"Why you've done some good flying in the Grasshopper,\" consoled Harry.  \"Ches, she is a goot leedle ship, bud she vont vin dees race, I dink. By der vay, boys, I have been meaning to warn you aboud dot Frenchman.\"  \"How do you mean--'warn us'?\" asked Frank.  \"Vell he means to win dis race. I know dot he has bet a lot of money on himself. Den also the manufacturers of der Buzzard will make a lot of money already if der Buzzard wins der cup. If she does not--abend, dey lose. Yah, der is a lot to vin and much to lose for der Buzzard, and dot Frenchman vill do anything to make sure of vinning.\"  \"Well, I guess we can take care of ourselves,\" laughed Frank, as he and his brother bade the queer old man good-night and entered their shed. It was filled with the appetizing odor of frying steak. On the top of the blue flame stove in a screened-off corner, Le Blanc, one of their mechanics, was cooking the simple meal with the loving care of a ten-thousand-dollar chef.  \"Smells good!\" remarked Harry sniffing. \"Where's Sanborn?\"  Sanborn was the other machinist and had been taken on in the place of their faithful old Schultz, who had fallen heir to a large sum of money in Germany, and gone home to spend his days in a cottage on the outskirts of Berlin.  \"He has gone down to the village,\" replied Le Blanc, vigorously shaking the pan of sizzling potatoes.  \"He seems to spend a lot of time down there lately,\" remarked Frank.  \"I'd rather see him about the aerodome,\" put in Harry; \"we don't want everybody to know all the details of our trials.\"  \"That's so,\" assented his brother, \"I'll speak to him about it when he comes in to-night.\"  The two lads fell to with keen appetites on their supper, which was served on tin plates and washed down with coffee out of tin mugs. Not a very aristocratic service, but the boys rather liked roughing it than otherwise, and you may be sure that the \"dinner set\" off which they ate did not engross a fraction of their attention. The meal disposed of, Le Blanc and the boys fixed up the folding camp cots and spread their blankets. There was still no sign of Sanborn. Frank was still struggling to keep awake in order to read the man a sharp lecture when he returned when drowsiness overcame him and he dropped off to sleep.  It was an hour later, and not far from midnight, when two dark figures crossed the deserted aviation field and threaded their way among the various aerodromes. They paused in front of the one in which the boys were asleep. Had the lads been onlookers they would have seen that one of the men was Sanborn, the new machinist, and the other was Malvoise, the driver of the sable Buzzard.  \"You won't lose your nerve?\" said the Frenchman.  \"Not me. I'm sore at those kids, anyhow,\" was the reply. \"The eldest one undertakes to call me down for going out at night all the time.\"  \"Well, you have a good chance to get back at him and make some money at the same time,\" was the other's rejoinder.  \"You are sure the money will be forthcoming?\"  \"Well, I should say! Old man Barr, who bought the patent of the Buzzard dirt cheap from her inventor, has a pile of it. He's going to manufacture the Buzzards to make money out of 'em and he'll stop at nothing to gain the prestige of winning this Hempstead Plains Cup.\"  \"I've heard of old Barr before. He's a regular skinflint, but I suppose, if you say it will be all right about the money, I'll have to take your word for it. I need some coin too badly to stick at anything.\"  \"That's the way to talk. By the way, talking of the inventor of the Buzzard, I saw a piece in the paper about him to-night.\"  \"What was it?\"  \"Why it seems that the poor beggar applied for shelter at the Municipal lodging-house in New York and told them a long tale of Barr having robbed him of his invention. They sized him up as being just another of those inventor bugs and so sent him to the booby hatch in Bellevue.\"  \"A good place for him,\" was the rejoinder, \"these inventors are all crazy.\"  \"Well, Luther Barr's found a way to make this particular crank pay,\" was the reply.  \"That's so. Well, good-night. Oh, say what was the name of the man who planned the Buzzard?\"  \"Oh, Eben something--let's see--Eben--it began with a J. I've got it--Eben Joyce, that's it--Eben Joyce.\"  \"Queer name that--Eben Joyce,\" was Sanborn's comment. \"Well, good-night.\"  \"Good-night. You won't fail us.\"  \"Not I,\" responded the machinist, as he slipped into the aerodrome and was soon wrapped in slumber as profound as if the thought of committing a treacherous act had never entered his mind.     CHAPTER II.  BILLY'S STRANGE TALE.   The next morning, as soon as the alarm clock rang out its summons at four-thirty, the boys were up and stirring, dashing the sleep out of their eyes with plenty of cold water. Le Blanc and Sanborn soon joined them, the latter heavy-eyed and sleepy-looking from the late hours of the night before. He was smoking a cigarette.  \"Look here, Sanborn, I don't want to be too strict, but you know there's too much gasolene around here for it to be safe to smoke in the shed,\" said Frank, with some irritation, as he spied him.  Sanborn threw the cigarette away with an ill-tempered exclamation.  \"Gee! It's a wonder you don't start a Sunday-school in here,\" he said.  \"Well, I don't think it would do you any harm to attend one for a while,\" answered Frank, \"and by the way, can't you make it possible to come in a little earlier? You are a valuable man to us and you can't do your best work if you are sitting up till all hours at the village hotel.\"  \"You ain't got no complaint about my work, have you?\" was the surly rejoinder.  \"No, I think that you are a very capable mechanic but I hate to see you wasting your time and opportunities this way,\" replied Frank. The boy was in some doubt as to the wisdom or the utility of calling Sanborn's attention to the latter's bad habits, but having embarked on his admonition he was not going to quit just because the man was surly.  \"When are you going to go up?\" asked Sanborn, changing the subject abruptly.  \"Right after breakfast,\" was the boy's reply, as he looked out of the big sliding doors and surveyed the cloudless sky. \"There doesn't seem to be a breath of wind and it's ideal weather for a good long flight.\"  But if the boys were up early they were not the only ones astir. Gladwin, who was an experimenter and who, although he had only been up a few times, meant to compete in the big race, was already busy outside his aerodrome, lovingly adjusting the engine of his queer-looking monoplane which had already been wheeled out. Malvoise, his hands in his pockets and a red sash about his waist, was also studying the sky. As Frank gazed about in the crisp morning air a dozen other aviators opened up their sheds and the day-life of the aviation camp began.  After breakfast had been despatched the boys at once went to work on their engine, a hundred horse-powered, eight-cylindered machine which was capable of driving their twin-screwed craft through the air at a rate of sixty miles an hour. One of the cylinders needed a new gasket and they were engaged on the task of fitting it when a sudden hail outside the shed made them look up inquiringly. A short, fat youth with a pair of spectacles bestriding his round good-natured face stood in the doorway. The boys recognized him instantly.  \"Why, hullo, Billy Barnes!\" they cried, \"come on in.\"  \"Hullo, Frank, hullo, Harry,\" grinned the newcomer, frantically shaking hands. \"I'm an early caller, but I slept at the village hotel last night and the beds there are as hard as a miser's heart. So I decided to get out early and take a chance on finding you fellows up and about.\"  After the first hearty greetings between the boys and the young reporter--with whom the readers of the other volumes in this series have already formed an acquaintanceship--the boys started asking questions.  \"What are you doing here anyhow?\" demanded Frank.  \"Yes, you mysterious scribe, tell us what you are after--a scoop or a story of how it feels to ride in an aeroplane?\"  \"Well,\" laughed Billy in response, \"I've had so many flights in the Golden Eagles--both one and two--that I really believe I've had too much experience to write a story about it from the novice's standpoint. No, the fact is that I am down here on a story--a good one too.\"  \"You can't keep away from the newspaper field, can you?\" laughed Frank.  \"No"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6149"],["title","The Boy Aviators' Treasure Quest; Or, The Golden Galleon (#2)"],["body",", that's a fact,\" agreed Billy ruefully; \"I've tried to, but it's no good.\"  \"Well, you ought to be 'a man of independent fortune' now, as the papers say,\" cried Harry.  \"You mean with the percentage I got of the recovered ivory?\"  The others nodded.  \"I always felt I didn't really deserve that money,\" urged Billy. \"You fellows did most of the work in Africa, I just trailed along.\"  \"Oh, get out, Billy Barnes!\" cried Frank. \"You did as much as any of us in overreaching old Barr.\"  \"Go ahead and tell us about this story of yours,\" demanded Harry.  \"Well, it sounds like a weird dream and perhaps you fellows will laugh at me for taking it seriously, but a few days ago an old fellow in a tattered blue suit called at the Planet offices and said he wanted to see the city editor. Of course nobody ever does see the city editor, so I was sent out to ascertain what the visitor wanted. I saw at once he had been a seafaring man. He told me his name was Bill Hendricks, known better as Bluewater Bill. He beat about the bush a good while before he would tell me what he was after, and finally he unfolded the wildest tale about buried treasure you ever heard--that is, I don't mean buried treasure--floating would be a better word to describe it. He told me that he had been one of the crew of a sailing vessel that had drifted, after being dismasted in a storm, into the Sargasso Sea.\"  \"You might tell us where the Sargasso Sea is,\" struck in Harry. \"I never heard of it.\"  \"Why, it's a vast expanse of floating seaweed brought together by circling ocean currents,\" explained Billy. \"There are hundreds of miles of seaweed in it and from the name of the weed it gets its title of Sargasso. It is in the north Atlantic, just about off the Gulf of Mexico roughly speaking, though many hundred miles from land. It is shifting all the time though, I understand, and a ship that once gets into it never gets out. The weed just holds her in its grip till she rots. Bluewater Bill told me that, after his ship drifted into it, he counted ten steamers and four sailing vessels drifting idly about on the brown expanse that spread like a desert on all sides. But the most remarkable of all, according to his story, was a high-pooped, castle-bowed affair with three masts that the tattered sails still hung to. According to him she was a real, sure-enough galleon. One of the old treasure vessels that used to ply the Spanish Main.\"  \"Oh, I say, Billy, you don't believe such a yarn as that, do you?\" burst out Frank and Harry, both at once.  \"Well, I don't know,\" replied Billy, \"the fellow seemed serious enough and I am half inclined to believe he was telling the truth. He wanted to get somebody to finance an expedition to go down there and prove that he was not falsifying, and give him a small share of the treasure he is sure the vessel is laden with, in return for his information.\"  \"In other words he is seeking a backer for an enterprise that looks ridiculous on the face of it,\" commented Frank.  \"I'm not so certain of that,\" went on Billy. \"Look here,\" and with the air of a conjurer producing a card from the empty air, he dived into his pocket and then, after a moment's fumbling, held out a round gold coin for the boys' inspection.  \"A Spanish pistole!\" exclaimed Frank, as his eyes fell on the dull yellow metal of the golden coin.  \"That's right,\" said Billy. \"I took it to a coin-dealer and had him give it a name. Of course the paper laughed at the story, so I'm after it now on my own hook. I got a leave of absence to dig it up. Bluewater Bill lives in Mineola and I'm going to see him later to-day and get more details from him. The more I think it over the more I think it's worth looking into.\"  The boys, whose opinion of the old sailor's story had been much altered by Billy's production of the indisputable evidence of the gold coin, agreed with him that it was indeed worth investigating further.  \"But you haven't told us half the story, Billy,\" objected Frank. \"How did Bluewater Bill escape? What became of the other men on the ship? How did he get aboard the galleon and get the coin? Oh, and heaps of other hows? and whys?\" he broke off, laughing at Billy's serious face.  \"I haven't got time to tell you all that now, and besides I am not clear on many of those points myself,\" replied Billy. \"Suppose, if you are not doing anything this evening, you come round with me to Bluewater Bill's home and talk to him about it yourselves.\"  \"Say, are you trying to lure us into any fresh adventures?\" said Frank with mock seriousness. \"Didn't we have enough of them in Africa?\"  \"I don't see how we could get at the galleon, supposing there is one there, even if we did go after it,\" chimed in Harry, whose active mind had already jumped ahead of the boys' conversation.  \"Why not?\" demanded Billy.  \"Why, you chump, if ships get in there and can't get out, how are we going to sail in there--get the treasure--always supposing there is any--and then return to civilization?\"  \"Do you mean to say that your gigantic brain can't grasp that?\" demanded the reporter.  \"No, my brilliant literary friend, it cannot--can yours?\"  \"It can.\"  \"Well, let us have it.\"  \"Well, in the first place,\" began Billy, \"if--I only say if--the galleon is there and--if--please remark I say 'if' once more--if we should decide to go after the treasure--if (useful word that) we did do so, we wouldn't have to sail INTO the Sargasso Sea at all.\"  \"No?\"  \"No. We could sail OVER it.\"  \"By George! that's so, isn't it?\"  \"Of course it is,\" concluded the young reporter; and he artfully added, \"it would be a great chance to demonstrate Frank's pet theory that an aeroplane that can float on the water on pontoons would be as easy to construct as one that will fly in the air.\"  \"What if a storm came up?\"  \"It is always calm in the Sargasso Sea, so Bluewater Bill told me. The great mass of tangled weed prevents the waves breaking while the severest storm may be raging all about. Nothing more alarming than a gentle swell ever disturbs its repose.\"  Frank, the mechanical-minded, already had fished out an envelope, and on its back was scribbling the rough outlines of the aluminum pontoons, he had frequently made a mental resolve to attach to the aeroplane, so as to render it safe on the water as well as over the land. He had no intention then of embarking on the enterprise that Billy had outlined--at least he didn't think he had--but any suggestion of aeroplane improvement always interested the boy keenly and set his inventive mind at work.  While the three boys had been discussing Bluewater Bill's strange tale there had been a fourth auditor whose presence, had they known it, would have caused them to talk in lowered voices. Sanborn, the mechanic, from behind the canvas screen where he was supposed to have been eating his breakfast, had been listening greedily to every word the young reporter said. His eyes fairly burned in his head as he listened and a half-formed resolve entered his mind.  There might be other persons who would be interested in learning of the treasure ship which Sanborn's greedy mind already had regarded as a reality.  \"Guess I'll take a run down to Bluewater Bill's myself to-night,\" he said to himself as he prepared to go to work on the aeroplane, at which Le Blanc had been busy tinkering during the boys' talk.  \"Well, Frank,\" said Billy at length, \"what do you think of it?\"  \"I'll reserve decision till we see Bluewater Bill to-night,\" quietly rejoined the other, rising from the box on which he had been sitting and slipping into his leather coat.     CHAPTER III.  A TRIAL FLIGHT.   When the boys wheeled the Golden Eagle II out of its shed, the green plains which stretched in an apparently limitless level on all sides were flooded with bright sunshine. They had delayed longer than they had intended to in making their start and already most of the other prospective contestants had concluded testing their engines or giving a final look over to brace wires and turn-buckles. A sparse sprinkling of spectators from the village was already on the grounds, early as was the hour.  The Golden Eagle's fuel and lubricating tanks were quickly filled, and every bit of metal about her shone and glistened in the sunlight, making a score of bright points of light. Her great planes, with their covering of yellow vulcanized silk, were in marked contrast to the inky hue of the Buzzard's surfaces, whose driver, Malvoise, was just settling into his seat, his inevitable cigarette still in his mouth. The Buzzard was even larger than the Golden Eagle, but her lifting capacity was a good deal less, as she was not so well designed. Malvoise, however, was a reckless driver, and had already had several narrow escapes from upsets.  The other air men bustled about and from their engines came an occasional gatling-gun-like rattle and roar, as they tried their motors out. In the air was the raw smell of gasolene and the odor of trampled grass. Clouds of blue smoke arose from where the proprietor of a small biplane had drenched his cylinders with too much oil. Occasionally an auto or a motor cycle chugged up, and the early comers watched with intense interest the flying men preparing for their trial flights.  Frank and Harry paid little attention to the others as they drew on their gloves, and carefully inspected their propellers. A man had been almost killed on the grounds a few days before, when a propeller blade had torn loose under the terrific strain of its 1200 revolutions a minute, and the boys were not anxious for anything like that to happen to their machine.  At last, everything seemed to be in order and the Chester boys scrambled into their chassis. The Golden Eagle had been stripped of all the appliances she usually carried as a passenger craft. Her searchlight and wireless were missing. Her transom seats were gone. Several braces had been taken out also, as the removal of her passenger accommodations had rendered the"]]]
