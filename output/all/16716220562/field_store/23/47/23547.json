On the morning of the 23d Thomas, according to instructions, moved Granger's corps of two divisions, Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding, to the foot of Fort Wood, and formed them into line as if going on parade, Sheridan on the right, Wood to the left, extending to or near Citico Creek.  Palmer, commanding the 14th corps, held that part of our line facing south and southwest. He supported Sheridan with one division (Baird's), while his other division under Johnson remained in the trenches, under arms, ready to be moved to any point. Howard's corps was moved in rear of the centre.  The picket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other.  At two o'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance.  By this time the clouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his elevated position all that was going on.  The signal for advance was given by a booming of cannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line.  The rebel pickets were soon driven back upon the main guards, which occupied minor and detached heights between the main ridge and our lines.  These too were carried before halting, and before the enemy had time to reinforce their advance guards.  But it was not without loss on both sides. This movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we occupied in the morning, and the one which the enemy had occupied up to this time.  The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other way.  During the following night they were made strong.  We lost in this preliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded, while the enemy probably lost quite as heavily, including the prisoners that were captured. With the exception of the firing of artillery, kept up from Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in, this ended the fighting for the first day.  The advantage was greatly on our side now, and if I could only have been assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have rested more easily.  But we were doing the best we could for him and the cause.  By the night of the 23d Sherman's command was in a position to move, though one division (Osterhaus's) had not yet crossed the river at Brown's Ferry.  The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered it impossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops to cross; but I was determined to move that night even without this division.  Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report to Hooker, if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the 24th.  Because of the break in the bridge, Hooker's orders were again changed, but this time only back to those first given to him.  General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of the Military Division.  To him were given the general direction of moving troops by the boats from North Chickamauga, laying the bridge after they reached their position, and generally all the duties pertaining to his office of chief engineer.  During the night General Morgan L. Smith's division was marched to the point where the pontoons were, and the brigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manning the boats and surprising the enemy's pickets on the south bank of the river.  During this night also General J. M. Brannan, chief of artillery, moved forty pieces of artillery, belonging to the Army of the Cumberland, and placed them on the north side of the river so as to command the ground opposite, to aid in protecting the approach to the point where the south end of the bridge was to rest.  He had to use Sherman's artillery horses for this purpose, Thomas having none.  At two o'clock in the morning, November 24th, Giles A. Smith pushed out from the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats, each loaded with thirty brave and well-armed men.  The boats with their precious freight dropped down quietly with the current to avoid attracting the attention of any one who could convey information to the enemy, until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga. Here a few boats were landed, the troops debarked, and a rush was made upon the picket guard known to be at that point.  The guard were surprised, and twenty of their number captured.  The remainder of the troops effected a landing at the point where the bridge was to start, with equally good results.  The work of ferrying over Sherman's command from the north side of the Tennessee was at once commenced, using the pontoons for the purpose.  A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist.  The rest of M. L. Smith's division came first, then the division of John E. Smith.  The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching their position.  By daylight the two entire divisions were over, and well covered by the works they had built.  The work of laying the bridge, on which to cross the artillery and cavalry, was now begun.  The ferrying over the infantry was continued with the steamer and the pontoons, taking the pontoons, however, as fast as they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge.  By a little past noon the bridge was completed, as well as one over the South Chickamauga connecting the troops left on that side with their comrades below, and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the Tennessee.  Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge.  By one o'clock he started with M. L. Smith on his left, keeping nearly the course of Chickamauga River; J. E. Smith next to the right and a little to the rear; and Ewing still farther to the right and also a little to the rear of J. E. Smith's command, in column, ready to deploy to the right if an enemy should come from that direction.  A good skirmish line preceded each of these columns.  Soon the foot of the hill was reached; the skirmishers pushed directly up, followed closely by their supports. By half-past three Sherman was in possession of the height without having sustained much loss.  A brigade from each division was now brought up, and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand. The enemy did not seem to be aware of this movement until the top of the hill was gained.  There had been a drizzling rain during the day, and the clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary Ridge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley.  But now the enemy opened fire upon their assailants, and made several attempts with their skirmishers to drive them away, but without avail.  Later in the day a more determined attack was made, but this, too, failed, and Sherman was left to fortify what he had gained.  Sherman's cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge was completed, and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridges and on its way to strike the enemy's communications at Chickamauga Station.  All of Sherman's command was now south of the Tennessee. During the afternoon General Giles A. Smith was severely wounded and carried from the field.  Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th, there was nothing for him to do this day except to strengthen his position.  Howard, however, effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman, and was directed to report to him.  With two or three regiments of his command he moved in the morning along the banks of the Tennessee, and reached the point where the bridge was being laid. He went out on the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end, and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side and moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway put upon it.  Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm between them, which was now narrow and in a few minutes closed.  While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga, Hooker was engaged on the west.  He had three divisions: Osterhaus's, of the 15th corps, Army of the Tennessee; Geary's, 12th corps, Army of the Potomac; and Cruft's, 14th corps, Army of the Cumberland.  Geary was on the right at Wauhatchie, Cruft at the centre, and Osterhaus near Brown's Ferry.  These troops were all west of Lookout Creek.  The enemy had the east bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched, and three brigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked.  These brigades occupied the summit of the mountain.  General Carter L. Stevenson was in command of the whole.  Why any troops, except artillery with a small infantry guard, were kept on the mountain-top, I do not see.  A hundred men could have held the summit--which is a palisade for more than thirty feet down--against the assault of any number of men from the position Hooker occupied.  The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker's command was rugged, heavily timbered, and full of chasms, making it difficult to advance with troops, even in the absence of an opposing force.  Farther up, the ground becomes more even and level, and was in cultivation.  On the east side the slope is much more gradual, and a good wagon road, zigzagging up it, connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit.  Early on the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary's division, supported by a brigade of Cruft's, up Lookout Creek, to effect a crossing.  The remainder of Cruft's division was to seize the bridge over the creek, near the crossing of the railroad. Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it.  The bridge was seized by Gross's brigade after a slight skirmish with the pickets guarding it.  This attracted the enemy so that Geary's movement farther up was not observed.  A heavy mist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain.  He crossed the creek almost unobserved, and captured the picket of over forty men on guard near by.  He then commenced ascending the mountain directly in his front.  By this time the enemy was seen coming down from their camps on the mountain slope,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5863"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 4. (#7)"],["body"," filing into their rifle-pits to contest the crossing of the bridge.  By eleven o'clock the bridge was complete.  Osterhaus was up, and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven away with considerable loss in killed and captured.  While the operations at the bridge were progressing, Geary was pushing up the hill over great obstacles, resisted by the enemy directly in his front, and in face of the guns on top of the mountain.  The enemy, seeing their left flank and rear menaced, gave way, and were followed by Cruft and Osterhaus.  Soon these were up abreast of Geary, and the whole command pushed up the hill, driving the enemy in advance.  By noon Geary had gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain, with his right close up to the base of the upper palisade, but there were strong fortifications in his front.  The rest of the command coming up, a line was formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek.  Thomas and I were on the top of Orchard Knob.  Hooker's advance now made our line a continuous one.  It was in full view, extending from the Tennessee River, where Sherman had crossed, up Chickamauga River to the base of Mission Ridge, over the top of the north end of the ridge to Chattanooga Valley, then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more, across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek, thence up the slope of Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade.  The day was hazy, so that Hooker's operations were not visible to us except at moments when the clouds would rise.  But the sound of his artillery and musketry was heard incessantly.  The enemy on his front was partially fortified, but was soon driven out of his works.  During the afternoon the clouds, which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hide whatever was going on from the view of those below, settled down and made it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time.  At four o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable.  By a little after five direct communication was established, and a brigade of troops was sent from Chattanooga to reinforce him.  These troops had to cross Chattanooga Creek and met with some opposition, but soon overcame it, and by night the commander, General Carlin, reported to Hooker and was assigned to his left.  I now telegraphed to Washington:  \"The fight to-day progressed favorably.  Sherman carried the end of Missionary Ridge, and his right is now at the tunnel, and his left at Chickamauga Creek. Troops from Lookout Valley carried the point of the mountain, and now hold the eastern slope and a point high up.  Hooker reports two thousand prisoners taken, besides which a small number have fallen into our hands from Missionary Ridge.\"  The next day the President replied: \"Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here.  Well done. Many thanks to all.  Remember Burnside.\"  And Halleck also telegraphed: \"I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans. I fear that Burnside is hard pushed, and that any further delay may prove fatal.  I know you will do all in your power to relieve him.\"  The division of Jefferson C. Davis, Army of the Cumberland, had been sent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they were deposited in the river, and to prevent all ingress or egress of citizens.  On the night of the 24th his division, having crossed with Sherman, occupied our extreme left from the upper bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge. Firing continued to a late hour in the night, but it was not connected with an assault at any point.    CHAPTER XLIV.  BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA--A GALLANT CHARGE--COMPLETE ROUT OF THE ENEMY --PURSUIT OF THE CONFEDERATES--GENERAL BRAGG--REMARKS ON CHATTANOOGA.  At twelve o'clock at night, when all was quiet, I began to give orders for the next day, and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside. Sherman was directed to attack at daylight.  Hooker was ordered to move at the same hour, and endeavor to intercept the enemy's retreat if he still remained; if he had gone, then to move directly to Rossville and operate against the left and rear of the force on Missionary Ridge. Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge.  As I was with him on Orchard Knob, he would not move without further orders from me.  The morning of the 25th opened clear and bright, and the whole field was in full view from the top of Orchard Knob.  It remained so all day. Bragg's headquarters were in full view, and officers--presumably staff officers--could be seen coming and going constantly.  The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almost disconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy. A low pass, over which there is a wagon road crossing the hill, and near which there is a railroad tunnel, intervenes between the two hills.  The problem now was to get to the main ridge. The enemy was fortified on the point; and back farther, where the ground was still higher, was a second fortification commanding the first.  Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough to see, and by sunrise his command was in motion.  Three brigades held the hill already gained.  Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base of Missionary Ridge; Loomis along the west base, supported by two brigades of John E. Smith's division; and Corse with his brigade was between the two, moving directly towards the hill to be captured.  The ridge is steep and heavily wooded on the east side, where M. L. Smith's troops were advancing, but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the west side.  The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of the rebel works.  Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemy off from the railroad bridge and the means of bringing up supplies by rail from Chickamauga Station, where the main depot was located.  The enemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from the position we had gained, but without success.  The contest lasted for two hours.  Corse, a brave and efficient commander, was badly wounded in this assault.  Sherman now threatened both Bragg's flank and his stores, and made it necessary for him to weaken other points of his line to strengthen his right.  From the position I occupied I could see column after column of Bragg's forces moving against Sherman.  Every Confederate gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces was concentrated upon him.  J. E. Smith, with two brigades, charged up the west side of the ridge to the support of Corse's command, over open ground and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry, and reached the very parapet of the enemy.  He lay here for a time, but the enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank, he was compelled to fall back, followed by the foe.  A few hundred yards brought Smith's troops into a wood, where they were speedily reformed, when they charged and drove the attacking party back to his intrenchments.  Seeing the advance, repulse, and second advance of J. E. Smith from the position I occupied, I directed Thomas to send a division to reinforce him.  Baird's division was accordingly sent from the right of Orchard Knob.  It had to march a considerable distance directly under the eye of the enemy to reach its position.  Bragg at once commenced massing in the same direction.  This was what I wanted.  But it had now got to be late in the afternoon, and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossing the ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville and compelling Bragg to mass in that direction also.  The enemy had evacuated Lookout Mountain during the night, as I expected he would.  In crossing the valley he burned the bridge over Chattanooga Creek, and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him.  Hooker was off bright and early, with no obstructions in his front but distance and the destruction above named.  He was detained four hours crossing Chattanooga Creek, and thus was lost the immediate advantage I expected from his forces.  His reaching Bragg's flank and extending across it was to be the signal for Thomas's assault of the ridge.  But Sherman's condition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief could not be delayed any longer.  Sheridan's and Wood's divisions had been lying under arms from early morning, ready to move the instant the signal was given. I now directed Thomas to order the charge at once (*16). I watched eagerly to see the effect, and became impatient at last that there was no indication of any charge being made.  The centre of the line which was to make the charge was near where Thomas and I stood, but concealed from view by an intervening forest.  Turning to Thomas to inquire what caused the delay, I was surprised to see Thomas J. Wood, one of the division commanders who was to make the charge, standing talking to him.  I spoke to General Wood, asking him why he did not charge as ordered an hour before.  He replied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it, but that he had been ready all day to move at a moment's notice.  I told him to make the charge at once.  He was off in a moment, and in an incredibly short time loud cheering was heard, and he and Sheridan were driving the enemy's advance before them towards Missionary Ridge.  The Confederates were strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in front of us, and had a second line half-way down and another at the base. Our men drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits so rapidly, and followed them so closely, that rebel and Union troops went over the first line of works almost at the same time.  Many rebels were captured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higher up the hill.  Those that were not captured retreated, and were pursued. The retreating hordes being between friends and pursuers caused the enemy to fire high to avoid killing their own men.  In fact, on that occasion the Union"]]]
