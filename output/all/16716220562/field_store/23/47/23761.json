The motion was seconded and carried unanimously.\" Enough members were added to make in all eleven quorums, and forty more were ordained to be part of the twelfth quorum. (See minutes of Conference, \"Times and Seasons,\" Vol. V, p. 695-696.) By the first of January, 1845, the number of quorums had increased to fourteen, and a Seventies' library was started, which caused the editor of the \"Times and Seasons\" to exclaim:      \"Ten years ago but one Seventy, and now fourteen [quorums of]     Seventies, and the foundation for the best library in the world. It     looks like old times when they had 'Kirjath Sapher,' the City of     Books.\" (Times and Seasons, Vol. V, p. 762-3.)  Meantime the Seventies had built a large brick hall in Nauvoo, known as the \"Seventies' Hall,\" and on the 26th of December, 1844, this building was dedicated with imposing ceremonies extending through an entire week. Most of the members of the Council of the Apostles participated in the dedicatory services. It may be of interest for the Seventies to know that the heroic hymn, \"The Seer, the Seer, Joseph the Seer,\" by the late President John Taylor, was written for these services though dedicated by the author to President Brigham Young. (Times and Seasons, Vol. V, p. 767.) The arrangement was made for two quorums to be in attendance at the dedication each day with their wives and children and a number of invited guests. By this time there were fifteen quorums in existence. By the 19th of January, 1846, the number of quorums had increased to thirty. (Times and Seasons, Vol. VI, p. 1096.) Whether or not any more quorums than these were organized in Nauvoo we do not know.  13. _Status of the Quorums Since Nauvoo Times:_ For some time after the settlement of the Church in Utah some confusion existed in relation to the quorums of Seventy, and the members of the respective quorums were so badly scattered that they convened in what were known as \"mass quorums,\" consisting of all the Seventies living in a stake or ward, without regard to the particular quorum to which they belonged. In the year 1883, however, a movement was set on foot to put the quorums in order, and the Presidency of the Church issued the following instructions on the subject of                     THE ORGANIZATION OF THE SEVENTY.                                   SALT LAKE CITY, U. T., April 13, 1883.      In the organization of these quorums in October, 1844, there were     ten quorums, each provided with seven presidents, which presidents     constituted the First Quorum of Seventies, and of which the First     Seven Presidents of the Seventies were members, and over which     they presided. But as the Seventies have greatly increased,     these regulations will not apply to the present circumstances;     and furthermore, the First Quorum, according to the present     organization, has not acted in a quorum capacity, but it would seem     there are duties devolving upon its members, as a quorum, that may     require their official action.      The First Quorum of Seventies may be composed of the First Seven     Presidents of the Seventies, and the senior president of the first     sixty-four quorums. These may form the Seventy referred to in the     Book of Doctrine and Covenants, and may act in an official capacity     as the First Quorum of Seventies.      The senior presidents of the other quorums, over and above the     sixty-four, may meet with the First Quorum in their assemblies in     any other than an official capacity; but in case of the absence of     any of the members of the First Quorum, they can act, in the place     of such members with the First Quorum during such absence, in any     cases of importance that may arise.      The headquarters of the different quorums, and the records thereof,     may be distributed throughout the various Wards and Stakes, under     the direction of the First Seven Presidents, as the number of the     Priesthood residing in such localities may seem to justify and any     vacancies that exist, either in the presidency or membership of     the different quorums may be filled by the ordination of persons     residing in the locality in which the respective quorums are     organized.      Any of the members or presidents of other quorums who are in good     standing may have the privilege of joining the quorum located in     the district in which they reside; but in such cases they should     first obtain a certificate as to their standing in the quorum from     which they desire to withdraw; to obtain which it would only be     necessary to procure a certificate of their good standing from the     Bishop of the Ward to which they belong, provided their names are     found upon the record of their quorum as in good standing.      The presidents of the quorums residing in the district where their     respective quorums are organized shall have a general supervision     of all the Seventies residing in their district.      In all cases where members of quorums are called in question, a     majority of their respective quorums will have jurisdiction in all     cases involving their standing in the quorum, but in case there     is not a majority residing in the district where the quorum is     organized, or in the case of scattered members, the members present     should investigate the matter and report their findings to the     First Seven Presidents. Any complaints regarding the presidents     of quorums should be made to the First Seven Presidents of the     Seventies, who may suspend such presidents, if their conduct     seem to justify it, pending the action of the First Quorum. Any     presidents or members from whom fellowship has been withdrawn     by the quorums, should be reported to the High Council having     jurisdiction.      The Seventies, when abroad, if anything should occur requiring     their supervision, in the absence of other authorities, may act     upon the case of any delinquent belonging to the Seventies, and     should report their decisions to the First Seven Presidents of the     Seventies.                                         Your Brethren in the gospel,                                                  JOHN TAYLOR,                                                  GEORGE Q. CANNON,                                                  JOSEPH F. SMITH,     First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  _A revelation given through President John Taylor, at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, on Saturday, April 14th, 1883, in answer to the question: \"Show unto us thy will, O Lord, concerning the organization of the Seventies.\"_      What ye have written is my will, and is acceptable unto me: and     furthermore,      Thus saith the Lord unto the First Presidency, unto the Twelve,     unto the Seventies and unto all my holy Priesthood, let not your     hearts be troubled, neither be ye concerned about the management     and organization of my Church and Priesthood and the accomplishment     of my work. Fear me and observe my laws and I will reveal unto you,     from time to time, through the channels that I have appointed,     everything that shall be necessary for the future development and     perfection of my Church, for the adjustment and rolling forth of my     kingdom, and for the building up and the establishment of my Zion.     For ye are my Priesthood and I am your God. Even so. Amen.  Under the instructions given in the foregoing communication and revelation, the First Council of the Seventy have proceeded with the work of increasing the quorums and managing their affairs. The quorums now number 151, giving to the foreign ministry of the Church a body of men numbering about ten thousand.  Footnotes  1. Hackett edition, in four volumes, now and always quoted.  2. I take occasion here to remark that by making reference to works such as Edersheim's Life of Jesus, Bible Dictionaries Ecclesiastical Histories, etc., it must not be understood that in making such references I approve the works, or even accept the correctness of the passages indicated. Such references are made that the student may consult the literature on a given point. He must make his own deductions as to the correctness of the statements and arguments of such authors. As for instance, in this very passage cited from Edersheim's really great work, I think him, in the main, wrong in his treatment of this subject of the Seventy, but our Seventies should know what so high an authority, as Edersheim is generally accepted to be, has said upon the subject.  3. It will be observed from this statement that the \"Cephas,\" or \"Peter\" whom Paul \"withstood to his face\" at Antioch, was not the chief Apostle Peter, but another \"Cephas\" or \"Peter,\" one of the Seventy. I fear, however, that the testimony in Galatians ii, as to its being Peter, the chief Apostle, with whom Paul had his unfortunate controversy, is too strong to be overturned by this inference in Eusebius.

Also note 7.  _SPECIAL TEXT: \"Wherefore now, let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.\" Doc. and Cov., Sec. 107_.  _NOTES._  1. _Priesthood._ Priesthood is authority which God gives to man, by which man is made an agent of God, authorized to speak, act, and administer in the divine name, and have his words and administrations of binding effect as if done by the Lord himself; provided, of course, said administrations are in accordance with the divine directions or instructions, within the limits of the authority confirmed upon the agent, performed in righteousness and relate to the matters for which the divine authority was given to man.  Necessarily this delegated authority is one in kind;[5] it is simply authority given of God to man by which man is authorized to act in God's stead in relation to certain things; but its powers are grouped in various ways for the purpose of facilitating the administration of its government. First, its powers are grouped with reference to temporal and spiritual affairs; the division of the Priesthood which has charge more especially of spiritual affairs is called the Melchisedek Priesthood; that which has charge more especially of temporal affairs, the Aaronic Priesthood. The officers of the Melchisedek Priesthood are, Apostles, Prophets, Patriarchs, High Priests, Seventies, Elders; of the Aaronic Priesthood: Bishops (who are High Priests, ordained to be Bishops and constitute the Presidency of the Aaronic Priesthood), Priests, Teachers, Deacons.  While this division of the Priesthood, or this grouping of its officers with reference to spiritual and temporal labors, assigns one to spiritual and the other to temporal concerns, it must not be thought that there is anything rigid in said division of labor; that the Aaronic Priesthood is excluded from participation in spiritual labors; or that the Melchisedek Priesthood is excluded from dealing with temporal affairs. The line of demarkation,[6] as a matter of fact, is crossed by each division; some of the duties of the Aaronic Priesthood are spiritual, and some of the duties of the Melchisedek, temporal. This division then rests upon the fact that the duties assigned the Aaronic priesthood are chiefly temporal, and the duties of the Melchisedek chiefly spiritual.  Another division of the Priesthood may be said to exist within the Melchisedek Priesthood, which is also a division with reference to its labors, viz., the foreign ministry and the home ministry, of which more is to be said later.  2. _The Church._ The Church may be said to arise from the Priesthood. Comprehensively defined it may be said to be an organization of people--including all officers and members--who believe in and endeavor to incorporate in their lives God's Truth; who have obeyed the ordinances or sacraments appointed of God for salvation and admission into his Church; whose officers are of divine appointment and commission, (that is, possessed of divine authority, the Priesthood) guided by an ever present inspiration from God, and walking within reach of an ever present and continuous source of immediate revelation.  The Church is the depository of God's revealed truth. Man may be able by searching to find out many truths. What he has learned by study, by investigation, aided by the inspiration of the Lord--for \"there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding\"--amounts to very much; but there are some things which even by searching man may not learn. \"Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\"[7] The inference in the scripture is, and the fact is, that the answer must be, no. God can not be perfectly known, only as he reveals himself to man; man can know his relationship to God only as God is pleased to reveal it; man can only know the terms and means of his salvation as the Lord reveals it; and these revelations, when he has one in the earth, God gives to his Church; these truths which man by searching, by his own wisdom, may not find out in their perfection--God deposits with his Church--hence the Church is the depository of God's revealed truth--she receives and is the custodian of the Gospel.  And not only is the Church the depository of revealed truth; but she is also the depository of the divine authority; she, in organized capacity, holds as content the Holy Priesthood; and she has commission and agency to dispense the truth and administer through her instrumentalities all the ordinances of the gospel.  3. _The Mission of the Church:_ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was brought into existence for the accomplishment of two great things: first, the proclamation of the truth concerning man's salvation to all the world: and second, the perfecting of those who accept that truth. The Church is organized with reference to the accomplishment of these two purposes, and has, for the accomplishment of those purposes, a foreign ministry and a home ministry. In defining the duties of a Seventy it is with the foreign ministry that we have to deal.  4. _The Foreign Ministry._ The business of the foreign ministry is to make proclamation of the gospel in all the world, and gather, as soon as wisdom dictates, those who accept it into the organized stakes of Zion. This foreign ministry, strictly speaking, is composed of the Twelve Apostles and the quorums of the Seventy.  5. _The Twelve:_ \"The twelve traveling counselors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world; thus differing from other officers in the Church in the duties of their calling. * * * * The Twelve are a traveling presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the Church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations; first unto the Gentiles, and secondly unto the Jews. * * * * The Twelve being sent out, holding the keys to open the door by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ--and first unto the Gentiles and then unto the Jews.\" (Doc & Cov., Sec. cvii.) This is the special calling of the Twelve Apostles, and the calling of the Seventy is like unto it.  6. _The Seventy:_ \"The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world. Thus differing from other officers in the Church in the duties of their calling. * * * * The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling High Council, in building up the Church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations--first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews. * * * * It is the duty of the traveling High Council to call upon the Seventy, when they need assistance, to fill the several calls for preaching and administering the gospel, instead of any others. * * * * And these Seventy (the reference is to the whole body of that Priesthood) are to be traveling ministers unto the Gentiles first, and also unto the Jews. * * * * Whereas other officers of the Church, who belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to travel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and responsible offices in the Church.\" (Doc. & Cov., Sec. cvii.)  When the Church was set in order at Nauvoo, in 1841, by direction of a revelation (Doc. & Cov.; Sec. cxxiv.) after naming the First Seven Presidents, who were to preside over the quorums of Seventies, the Lord said: \"Which quorum is instituted for traveling Elders to bear record of my name in all the world, whenever the traveling High Council, my Apostles, shall send them to prepare a way before my face. The difference between this quorum and the quorum of Elders is, that one is to travel continually, and the other is to preside over the churches from time to time: the one has the responsibility of presiding from time to time, and the other has no responsibility of presiding, saith the Lord your God.\"  In these passages the special calling and duties of the Seventies are so clearly set forth that neither comment nor amplification is necessary, since these foregoing quotations are the word of the Lord, and evidence the fact that the Twelve, with the Seventy, constitute the foreign"]]]
