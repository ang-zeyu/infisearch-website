She would have stayed had there been anything more to do!”  King began to watch the dance again, for it did not feel safe to look too long into the Rangar's eyes. It was not wise just then to look too long at anything, or to think too long on any one subject.  “Ismail is slow about returning,” said the Rangar.  “I wrote at the foot of the tar,” said King, “that they are to detain him there until the answer comes.”  The Rangar's eyes blazed for a second and then grew cold again (as King did not fail to observe). He knew as well as the Rangar that not many men would have kept their will so unfettered in that room as to be able to give independent orders. He recognized resignation, temporary at least, in the Rangar's attitude of leaning back again to watch from under lowered eyelids. It was like being watched by a cat.  All this while the women danced on, in time to wailing flute-music, until, it seemed from nowhere, a lovelier woman than any of them appeared in their midst, sitting cross-legged with a flat basket at her knees. She sat with arms raised and swayed from the waist as if in a delirium. Her arms moved in narrowing circles, higher and higher above the basket lid, and the lid began to rise. Nobody touched it, nor was there any string, but as it rose it swayed with sickening monotony.  It was minutes before the bodies of two great king-cobras could be made out, moving against the woman's spangled dress. The basket lid was resting on their heads, and as the music and the chanting rose to a wild weird shriek the lid rose too, until suddenly the woman snatched the lid away and the snakes were revealed, with hoods raised, hissing the cobra's hate-song that is prelude to the poison-death.  They struck at the woman, one after the other, and she leaped out of their range, swift and as supple as they. Instantly then she joined in the dance, with the snakes striking right and left at her. Left and right she swayed to avoid them, far more gracefully than a matador avoids the bull and courting a deadlier peril than he--poisonous, two to his one. As she danced she whirled both arms above her head and cried as the were-wolves are said to do on stormy nights.  Some unseen hand drew a blind over the great window and an eerie green-and-golden light began to play from one end of the room, throwing the dancers into half-relief and deepening the mystery.  Sweet strange scents were wafted in from under the silken hangings. The room grew cooler by unguessed means. Every sense was treacherously wooed. And ever, in the middle of the moving light among the languorous dancers, the snakes pursued the woman!  “Do you do this often?” wondered King, in a calm aside to Rewa Gunga, turning half toward him and taking his eyes off the dance without any very great effort.  Rewa Gunga clapped his hands and the dance ceased. The woman spirited her snakes away. The blind was drawn upward and in a moment all was normal again with the punkah swinging slowly overhead, except that the seductive smell remained, that was like the early-morning breath of all the different flowers of India.  “If she were here,” said the Rangar, a little grimly--with a trace of disappointment in his tone--“you would not snatch your eyes away like that! You would have been jolly well transfixed, my friend! These--she--that woman--they are but clumsy amateurs! If she were here, to dance with her snakes for you, you would have been jolly well dancing with her, if she had wished it! Perhaps you shall see her dance some day! Ah,--here is Ismail,” he added in an altered tone of voice. He seemed relieved at sight of the Afridi.  Bursting through the glass-bead curtains at the door, the great savage strode down the room, holding out a telegram. Rewa Gunga looked as if he would have snatched it, but King's hand was held out first and Ismail gave it to him. With a murmur of conventional apology King tore the envelope and in a second his eyes were ablaze with something more than wonder. A mystery, added to a mystery, stirred all the zeal in him. But in a second he had sweated his excitement down.  “Read that, will you?” he said, passing it to Rewa Gunga. It was not in cypher, but in plain everyday English.  “She has not gone North,” it ran. “She is still in Delhi. Suit your own movements to your plans.”  “Can you explain?” asked King in a level voice. He was watching the Rangar narrowly, yet he could not detect the slightest symptom of emotion.  “Explain?” said the Rangar. “Who can explain foolishness? It means that another fat general has made another fat mistake!”  “What makes you so certain she went North?” King asked.  Instead of answering, Rewa Gunga beckoned Ismail, who had stepped back out of hearing. The giant came and loomed over them like the Spirit of the Lamp of the Arabian Nights.  “Whither went she?” asked the Rangar.  “To the North!” he boomed.  “How knowest thou?”  “I saw her go!”  “When went she?”  “Yesterday, when a telegram came.”  The word “came” was the only clue to his meaning, for in the language he used “yesterday” and “to-morrow” are the same word; such is the East's estimate of time.  “By what route did she go?” asked Rewa Gunga.  “By the terrain from the station.”  “How knowest thou that?”  “I was there, bearing her box of jewels.”  “Didst thou see her buy the tikkut?”  “Nay, I bought it, for she ordered me.”  “For what destination was the tikkut?”  “Peshawur!” said Ismail, filling his mouth with the word as if he loved it.  “Yet”--it was King who spoke now, pointing an accusing finger at him--“a burra sahib sends a tar to me--this is it!--to say she is in Delhi still! Who told thee to answer those questions with those words?”  “She!” the big man answered.  “Yasmini?”  “Aye! May Allah cover her with blessings!”  “Ah!” said King. “You have my leave to depart out of earshot.”  Then he turned on Rewa Gunga.  “Whatever the truth of all this,” he said quietly, “I suppose it means she has done what there was to do in Delhi?”  “Sahib,--trust her! Does a tigress hunt where no watercourses are, and where no game goes to drink? She follows the sambur!”  “You are positive she has started for the North?”  “Sahib, when she speaks it is best to believe! She told me she will go. Therefore I am ready to lead King sahib up the Khyber to her!”  “Are you certain you can find her?”  “Aye, sahib,--in the dark!”  “There's a train leaves for the North to-night,” said King.  The Rangar nodded.  “You'll want a pass up the line. How many servants? Three--four--how many?”  “One,” said the Rangar, and King was instantly suspicious of the modesty of that allowance; however he wrote out a pass for Rewa Gunga and one servant and gave it to him.  “Be there on time and see about your own reservation,” he said. “I'll attend to Ismail's pass myself.”  He folded the list of names that the Rangar had marked and wrote something on the back. Then he begged an envelope, and Rewa Gunga had one brought to him. He sealed the list in the envelope, addressed it and beckoned Ismail again.  “Take this to Saunders sahib!” he ordered. “Go first to the telegraph office, where you were before, and the babu there will tell you where Saunders sahib may be found. Having found him, deliver the letter to him. Then come and find me at the Star of India Hotel and help me to bathe and change my clothes.”  “To hear is to obey!” boomed Ismail, bowing; but his last glance was for Rewa Gunga, and he did not turn to go until he had met the Rangar's eyes.  When Ismail had gone striding down the room, with no glance to spare for the whispering women in the window, and with dignity like an aura exuding from him, King looked into the Rangar's eyes with that engaging frankness of his that disarms so many people.  “Then you'll be on the train to-night?” he asked.  “To hear is to obey! With pleasure, sahib!”  “Then good-by until this evening.”  King bowed very civilly and walked out, rather unsteadily because his head ached. Probably nobody else, except the Rangar, could have guessed what an ordeal he had passed through or how near he had been to losing self-command.  But as he felt his way down the stairs, that were dimly lighted now, he knew he had all his senses with him, for he “spotted” and admired the lurking places that had been designed for undoing of the unwary, or even the overwary. Yasmini's Delhi nest was like a hundred traps in one.  “Almost like a pool table,” he reflected. “Pocket 'em at both ends and the middle!”  In the street he found a gharry after a while and drove to his hotel. And before Ismail came he took a stroll through a bazaar, where he made a few strange purchases. In the hotel lobby he invested in a leather bag with a good lock, in which to put them. Later on Ismail came and proved himself an efficient body-servant.  That evening Ismail carried the leather bag and found his place on the train, and that was not so difficult, because the trains running North were nearly empty, although the platforms were all crowded. As he stood at the carriage door with Ismail near him, a man named Saunders slipped through the crowd and sought him out.  “Arrested 'em all!” he grinned.  “Good.”  “Seen anything of her? I recognized Yasmini's scent on your envelope. It's peculiar to her--one of her monopolies!”  “No. I'm told she went North yesterday.”  “Not by train, she didn't! It's my business to know that!”  King did not answer; nor did he look surprised. He was watching Rewa Gunga, followed by a servant, hurrying to a reserved compartment at the front end of the train. The Rangar waved to him and he waved back.  “I'd know her in a million!” vowed Saunders. “I can take oath she hasn't gone anywhere by train! Unless she has walked, or taken a carriage, she's in Delhi!”  The engine gave a preliminary shriek and the giant Ismail nudged King's elbow in impatient warning. There was no more sign of Rewa Gunga, who had evidently settled down in his compartment for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6071"],["title","The Rover Boys out West; Or, The Search for a Lost Mine (#0)"],["body","ROVER BOYS OUT WEST  Or  The Search for a Lost Mine   By Arthur M. Winfield      INTRODUCTION  My Dear Boys: This book, \"The Rover Boys Out West,\" forms the fourth volume of the \"Rover Boys Series,\" a line of up-to-date stories for Young Americans.  Like the other books of the series, this tale's complete in itself.  In \"The Rover Boys at School\" we were introduced to Dick, Tom, and Sam, and their amusing and thrilling adventures at Putnam Hall, a military academy for boys situated in the heart of Now York State; in \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean\" we followed our young heroes during a most daring rescue; and in \"The Rover Boys in the jungle\" we learn what true American courage can do, even in the heart of the Dark Continent.  In the present tale our young herm are taken at first back to dear old Putnam Hall, and then to the heart of the great mining district of Colorado.  All trace of a valuable mine has been lost, and the boys start out on a hunt for the property, little dreaming of the many perils which await them on their quest.  How they overcome one obstacle after another, and get the best of their various enemies, will be found in the story itself.  The success of the first Rover Boys books has gratified me beyond measure, and my one hope is that my numerous readers will find this and future volumes of equal interest.  Affectionately and sincerely yours,                  ARTHUR M. WINFIELD.  June 20, 1900       CHAPTER I  RETURNING FROM A GREAT GAME   \"Zip! Boom! Ah!\"  \"Hurrah for Putnam Hall!\"  \"Let her go, Peleg, lively now, and mind you don't upset us, or we'll use you worse than we did the football.\"  \"All right, young gents.  All in?  Hold fast, everybody, or I won't be responsible, nohow, if you drop off.  Git along, Jack; up with ye, Sally!\"  And with a crack of the whip, a tooting of tin horns, and it mad yelling and cheering from the students, the long Putnam Hall stage left the football enclosure attached to the Pornell Academy grounds and started along the lake road for Putnam Hall.  The stage was packed, inside and out, with as merry and light-hearted a crowd of boys as could be found anywhere; and why should they not be merry and light-hearted, seeing as they had just won a great football match by a score of 16 to 8?  Tom Rover, who was on the top of the stage, actually danced a jig for joy.  \"That's the third time we have done them up, fellows!\" he cried. \"My, but won't there be gloom around Pornell Academy to-night!  It will be thick enough to cut with a knife.\"  \"They were never in it from the start,\" piped up Sam Rover.  \"And they were all heavier than our team, too,\" he added, proudly.  \"It was science, not weight, that won the match,\" said Frank Harrington.  \"Yes, it was science,\" broke in Larry Colby.  \"And for that science we have to thank Dick Rover.  Oh, but didn't that rush to the left fool them nicely!\"  Dick Rover's handsome face flushed with pleasure.  \"We won because every player did his full duty,\" he said.  \"If we--\"  He broke off short.  \"Great Scott, what a racket on top!  Who's that capering around?\"  \"It's me, thank you!\" yelled Tom, with more force than good grammar.  \"I'm doing an Indian war dance in honor of the victory. Want to join in, anybody?\"  \"Stop it; you'll be coming through the roof.  We had only one man hurt on the field; I don't want a dozen hurt on the ride home.\"  \"Oh, it's safe enough, Dick.  If I feel the roof giving way I'll jump and save myself,\" and Tom began a wilder caper than ever.  But suddenly George Granbury, who sat nearby, caught him by the foot, and he came down with a thump that threatened to split the stage top from end to end.  \"It won't do, nohow!\" pleaded Peleg Snuggers, the general utility man attached to Putnam Hall Military Academy.  \"Them hosses is skittish, and--\"  \"Oh, stow it, Peleg,\" interrupted George.  \"You know those horses couldn't run away if they tried.  You only want us to act as if we were a funeral procession coming--\"  A wild blast of horns from below drowned out the remainder of his speech, and this finished, the football team and the other cadets began to sing, in voices more forceful than melodious:       \"Putnam Hall!  Putnam Hall!      What is wrong with Putnam Hall?      Nothing, boys!  Nothing, boys!      She's all RIGHT!      Right! right! Right!  Right!  RIGHT!\"  Through the woods and far across the clear waters of Cayuga Lake floated the words, followed by another blast from the horns and then continued cheering.  And their cheering was answered by others who passed them, some in carriages and others oil bicycles.  It was a clear, sunshiny day, and nearly all of the inhabitants of Cedarville, as well as of other villages along the lake, were out in honor of the occasion.  It had been a general holiday both at Putnam Hall and at Pornell Academy, and the whole neighborhood had taken advantage of it.  \"I believe Captain Putnam is as proud as any of us,\" remarked Dick Rover, when the excitement had calmed down a bit.  \"When Tom kicked that final goal I saw him rise up and nearly pound the life out of the railing with his gold-headed cane.  I'll wager the cane is split into a dozen pieces.\"  \"Oh, that's nothing,\" put in Harry Blossom slyly.  \"When Tom did his little act I saw Nellie Laning actually throw him a kiss from the grand stand.  If she--\"  \"Hi, below there!  Who's taking my name in vain?\" came from Tom, and suddenly his head appeared at the top of one of the openings on the side of the stage.  \"I was just telling what Nellie Laning did, Tom.  When you made that splendid kick--\"  \"Stow it, you moving-picture camera!\" cried Tom, his face growing suddenly red.  \"You see altogether too much.\"  \"Do I?\" drawled Harry dryly.  \"Maybe.  And then when Dick made his run, pretty Dora Stanhope just put out her arms as if she wanted to hug--  Whow!\"  Harry Blossom's banter came to a sudden ending, for, as red in the face as his brother, Dick Rover reached forward and thrust a banana he was eating into the tormenter's half open mouth.  Harry gulped once or twice, then the fruit disappeared as if by magic.  \"All right, Dick, I accept the bribe and will henceforth be silent,\" he said solemnly, as soon as he could speak.  \"That's right, tie up your tongue, unless you want to be lifted from the stage,\" said Tom.  \"It's all right,\" put in Dave Kearney, another cadet.  \"Dora Stanhope and the Laning girls are nice folk and I don't blame anybody for being sweet on them.\"  \"Yes, but you keep out of their cornfield, or you'll have all three of the Rovers after you,\" came from Harry warningly.  \"What are we going to do to-night?\" asked Dick abruptly, and in such a tone that the others felt the bantering must come to an end. \"Is it feast, or fireworks, or both?\"  \"Make it both!\" came in chorus from a dozen cadets.  \"Captain Putnam is just in the humor to let us do anything to-night.  And Mr. Strong's in the same good humor.  Let us make the best of it.\"  \"All right; feast and fireworks it is,\" said Dick.  \"But both will cost money.  Who'll pass around the hat?\"  A groan went up, as is generally the case when an academy boy is asked to part with some of his spending money.  But the groan counted for nothing, and the passing of the hat brought in over ten dollars.  \"Ten-sixty for this load,\" announced the cadet who had made the collection.  \"And there are two other loads following, besides those who were on their wheels.  We ought to be able to collect at least thirty dollars, and that will buy out half of Cedarville.\"  \"If only old Carrick has some of his Fourth of July fireworks left,\" said Sam.  \"Chust so!\" grinned Hans Muelle, the German cadet who had joined the academy the season before.  \"Vot is von celebration midowit firevorks, hey?  He vos chust noddings!\"  \"Do you want another pistol explosion?\" asked one of the others, referring to an incident between Tom Rover and Hans which had nearly ended in a tragedy.  \"Mine cracious, no!\" howled the German lad.  \"I go me not py a hundred feet mid an old pistol again alrietty!  I vould radder sit town on von can of dynamite to sleep, yes I vould!\"  And he shook his curly head earnestly.  \"We won't have any pistols in this,\" broke in Tom, who felt like shuddering every time the incident was mentioned.  \"We'll just have skyrockets, and Roman candles, and pin-wheels, and all of the rest of the good old-fashioned things--that is for the celebration on the outside.\"  \"And for the celebration on the inside let us have cake, ice-cream, fruits, and nuts,\" put in Larry.  \"At this minute I feel hungry enough to eat the captain out of house and home.\"  \"Ditto myself,\" came from another student.  \"Perhaps the captain will be glad enough to have us celebrate--at our own expense,\" suggested a cadet in one corner, yet he did not mean what he said, knowing that bluff Captain Putnam, the owner and headmaster of Putnam Hall was whole-souled and generous to the core.  The stage had already covered over a mile of the road, and now the turnout left the lake shore and began to climb a long hill leading to the heights upon which the academy was located.  But there was still a little valley to cross, at the bottom of which dashed a rocky mountain torrent on its way to the placid waters beyond.  At the top of the first long rise Peleg Snuggers stopped the team for a few minutes' rest.  Here the view was magnificent, and many a cadet stopped his idle talk to gaze at the mountains to the westward and the sparkling lake winding along in the opposite direction.  It was early fall, and nearly every tree was tinted with red and gold, while here and there the first frosts had covered the ground with leaves and nuts.  \"Don't wait too long, Peleg,\" urged Tom impatiently.  \"It will take some time to get ready for our celebration to-night, you know.\"  \"I'm hurrying as fast as I can, Master Tom,\" was the reply.  \"Git up, Jack! git up, Sally!\"  And once more they moved off, and again some of the boys tooted their"]]]
