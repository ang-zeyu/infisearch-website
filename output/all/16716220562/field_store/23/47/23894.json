CHAPTER VIII  ON GUARD UNDER THE SEA    \"If there is anybody at work on the wreck,\" Ned replied, \"they may be removing the gold or they may be searching the vessel for incriminating documents.\"  \"I guess any documents found down there will be pretty wet,\" laughed Jack.  \"They may be in sealed boxes,\" Ned replied. \"Anyway, if there are important documents on board they might be rendered legible by proper and judicious handling.\" \"Here we go, then,\" Jack exclaimed. \"I'll expel the water in the tanks until the Sea Lion rests at the right altitude, over the wreck, and we can enter by way of the decks.\"  \"But what will the other fellows be doing while we are getting into position?\" asked Frank.  \"Gettin' ready to cut our lines, probably,\" interposed Jimmie.  \"That's a fact,\" Jack said. \"If there are men working in the ship they must be supplied with air by a submarine. How could that be done, I'd like to know.\"  \"They might anchor the submarine some distance away,\" replied Ned, \"and lay an air-hose along the bottom. If attached to the hose leading into the helmets before being placed, two or three might work from such a supply, and such a system, too, would obviate a good deal of the danger to be feared from crossed lines.\"  \"You've got it all figured out!\" cried Jimmie.  \"Well,\" Frank intervened, \"I'll bet that he has it right. Those Moore persons were not born yesterday.\"  \"That's right,\" Jack admitted. \"We saw enough of the Captain in the Black Bear club-room in New York to know that he is an expert in the submarine business. He may be an imitation fop and a bounder, as he would say, but he certainly is next to his job.\"  \"Why wouldn't it be a good idea to sneak around in our water suits until we find the lines an' cut them?\" asked Jimmie.  \"That would be plain murder,\" Ned replied.  \"I guess they wouldn't hesitate long if the conditions were reversed,\" Frank suggested, \"still, I wouldn't like to be in with anything as brutal as that.\"  \"Come to think of it,\" Jimmie admitted, \"I wouldn't, either.\"  \"I don't get the idea of these incriminating documents,\" Jack said, in a moment. \"That is one thing I did not pay attention to in the talk with Captain Moore at the clubroom.\"  \"What he said was this,\" Ned explained. \"The Government is accused, in certain hostile foreign circles, of conspiring with the leaders of the revolution now brewing in China. He declared that the Washington officials were even charged with sending the gold to the rebels by the roundabout way of the present Chinese Government.\"  \"You'll have to come again!\" laughed Frank. \"I'm dense as to that part of it. It is too subtle for me.\"  \"Me, too,\" Jimmie asserted.  \"All I know about it,\" Ned answered, \"is that Captain Moore declared that the rebel leaders were purposely posted as to the shipment of the gold, and that they were to seize it as soon as it left the protection of the American flag, if they could. At least they were to be given a chance to do so.\"  \"Even in that case,\" Frank reasoned, \"the Washington people wouldn't be foolish enough to place incriminating papers with the shipment. The whole scheme might fail, you know.\"  \"It does look pretty fishy,\" Ned remarked, \"but the ways of diplomacy are often crooked ways. Anyway, it is claimed by some that the mail boat was rammed, that it was no accident that sent her to keep company with McGinty at the bottom of the sea.\"  Jack expelled the water from the tanks of the Sea Lion until the instruments in the machine room showed her to be near the surface, and, as Ned estimated, directly above the wreck. Then an anchor was sent out, to prevent any possible drifting, and Ned, Frank and Jack put on their helmets again.  The lines used for signaling and the air-hose had both been spliced, and it was figured that any part of the wreck could now be visited. The drop lines were also longer, and the machinery for hauling the divers up on signal was made ready for use.  \"We can't walk out and in the Sea Lion now,\" Ned said, \"and a good deal depends on the vigilance of the boy left in the boat. Watch for the slightest signal, Jimmie,\" he warned.  The touching of a lever unwound the lifting and lowering lines when all was ready, and in a minute the three boys found themselves on the upper deck of the wreck. It was tilted at an angle of about twenty degrees, so great care was exercised in traversing it.  As Jimmie swung the lever which lowered the three boys he peered out of a darkened window. He saw only the dim surface light.  \"They've got sense enough not to show any light,\" he mused, \"so the thieves won't know what is going on unless they see the shadow overhead, or run into one of the fellows.\"  Leaving Frank, as the most cautious of the boys, to guard the lines and air-hose when they touched sharp angles, Ned, accompanied by Jack, advanced down the main companionway and was soon in the large and handsomely furnished cabin.  Then the electric searchlights were put to use, and the great apartment lay partly exposed to view. Their entrance into the room seemed to create something like a current in the water, and articles of light weight came driving at them.  Ned turned sick and faint as a dead body lifted from the floor and a ghastly face was turned toward his own. A few unfortunate ones had gone down with the ship, and most of the bodies lay in this cabin.  Those who had remained on deck until the final plunge had, of course, drifted away. However, the boy soon recovered his equilibrium, and went about his work courageously, notwithstanding the fact that many terrifying forms of marine life swam and squirmed around him.  Clinging to heavy tables and chairs to prevent slipping, the boys made their way to that part of the ship where, according to their drawings, the captain's cabin had been. Their first duty was to make search for any sealed papers which might be there.  The room was located at last, and then Ned motioned to Jack to extinguish his light. The boy obeyed orders with a feeling of dread.  It was dark as the bottomless pit in the cabin now, and fishes and squirming things brushed against his legs and rubbed against the line which was supplying him with air.  In all the experiences of the Boy Scouts nothing like this had ever been encountered before. In Mexico, in the Philippines, in the Great Northwest, in the Canal Zone, in the cold air far above the roof of the world, they had usually been in touch with all the great facts of Nature, but now they seemed separated from all mankind--buried in a fathomless pit filled with unclean things.  The door of the captain's cabin was closed. Ned put his ear against it, then reached out and took Jack by the arm. The latter understood the order and crowded close.  From the other side came sharp blows, and through the keyhole came the glow of illuminated water. Ned's worst fears were realized. Some one had reached the wreck in advance of his party.  He knew that he could not justly be censured for the activity of his enemies, and yet the thought that he was in danger of failing in his mission brought the hot blood surging to his head. He did not stop at that time to deliberate as to how the hostile forces had gained this advantage in time.  He did not even try to solve the problem as to the personality of the hostile element. The men working on the other side of the door to the captain's cabin might have crossed the Pacific in the Diver, or they might have been recruited from foreign seaports.  The question did not particularly interest him. The point with him was that they were there.  And, now, what course ought he to pursue? For a time, as he stood against the door, he could reach no conclusion.  Directly, however, the important question presented by the unusual situation came to the boy's mind. It was this:  Where was the boat into which the workers on the other side of the door proposed to remove the plunder?  The Diver, or some other efficient submarine must be close at hand. The men who were searching the captain's room were being supplied with air from some source.  And here was another question:  Had the gold already been removed?  It seemed to Ned that the first thing for him to do was to locate the submarine. For all he knew, prowlers from her might be nosing around the Sea Lion.  He had left the door to the water chamber open, of course, and so it must remain until he returned. Jimmie, owing to a defect afterwards corrected, could not expel the water while the door was open, nor could he close the door from the interior.  Fearful that some mischief was on foot, he grasped Jack by the arm and hastened back to where Frank had been left. His first care should be to find the exact location of the hostile submarine and then see that no air-hose reached from her to the Sea Lion.  The three boys passed out of the wreck and came to the stern of the once fine ship. She had gone down prow first, and the stern was a little above the level sand floor of the sea.  Instead of passing around the stern and coming out on the other side, the boys halted and crouched down, so as to see under the keel. As the outer shell of the ship was here at least a yard above the bottom, it was plain that the cargo had swept"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/611"],["title","Prester John (#0)"],["body","JOHN   by  JOHN BUCHAN     TO  LIONEL PHILLIPS    Time, they say, must the best of us capture,   And travel and battle and gems and gold   No more can kindle the ancient rapture,   For even the youngest of hearts grows old.

My Uncle's Gift Is Many Times Multiplied    CHAPTER I  THE MAN ON THE KIRKCAPLE SHORE  I mind as if it were yesterday my first sight of the man.  Little I knew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how often that face seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep and disturb my waking hours.  But I mind yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a terror which was surely more than the due of a few truant lads breaking the Sabbath with their play.  The town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross my father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of Caple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea.  Round the horns of land which enclose the bay the coast shows on either side a battlement of stark red cliffs through which a burn or two makes a pass to the water's edge.  The bay itself is ringed with fine clean sands, where we lads of the burgh school loved to bathe in the warm weather.  But on long holidays the sport was to go farther afield among the cliffs; for there there were many deep caves and pools, where podleys might be caught with the line, and hid treasures sought for at the expense of the skin of the knees and the buttons of the trousers.  Many a long Saturday I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, having lit a fire of driftwood, and made believe that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite new landed from France.  There was a band of us in Kirkcaple, lads of my own age, including Archie Leslie, the son of my father's session-clerk, and Tam Dyke, the provost's nephew.  We were sealed to silence by the blood oath, and we bore each the name of some historic pirate or sailorman.  I was Paul Jones, Tam was Captain Kidd, and Archie, need I say it, was Morgan himself.  Our tryst was a cave where a little water called the Dyve Burn had cut its way through the cliffs to the sea. There we forgathered in the summer evenings and of a Saturday afternoon in winter, and told mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly hearts.  But the sober truth is that our deeds were of the humblest, and a dozen of fish or a handful of apples was all our booty, and our greatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the Dyve tan-work.  My father's spring Communion fell on the last Sabbath of April, and on the particular Sabbath of which I speak the weather was mild and bright for the time of year.  I had been surfeited with the Thursday's and Saturday's services, and the two long diets of worship on the Sabbath were hard for a lad of twelve to bear with the spring in his bones and the sun slanting through the gallery window.  There still remained the service on the Sabbath evening--a doleful prospect, for the Rev. Mr Murdoch of Kilchristie, noted for the length of his discourses, had exchanged pulpits with my father.  So my mind was ripe for the proposal of Archie Leslie, on our way home to tea, that by a little skill we might give the kirk the slip.  At our Communion the pews were emptied of their regular occupants and the congregation seated itself as it pleased.  The manse seat was full of the Kirkcaple relations of Mr Murdoch, who had been invited there by my mother to hear him, and it was not hard to obtain permission to sit with Archie and Tam Dyke in the cock-loft in the gallery.  Word was sent to Tam, and so it happened that three abandoned lads duly passed the plate and took their seats in the cock-loft.  But when the bell had done jowing, and we heard by the sounds of their feet that the elders had gone in to the kirk, we slipped down the stairs and out of the side door.  We were through the churchyard in a twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the Dyve Burn. It was the fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to put their boys into what were known as Eton suits--long trousers, cut-away jackets, and chimney-pot hats.  I had been one of the earliest victims, and well I remember how I fled home from the Sabbath school with the snowballs of the town roughs rattling off my chimney-pot.  Archie had followed, his family being in all things imitators of mine.  We were now clothed in this wearisome garb, so our first care was to secrete safely our hats in a marked spot under some whin bushes on the links. Tam was free from the bondage of fashion, and wore his ordinary best knickerbockers. From inside his jacket he unfolded his special treasure, which was to light us on our expedition--an evil-smelling old tin lantern with a shutter.  Tam was of the Free Kirk persuasion, and as his Communion fell on a different day from ours, he was spared the bondage of church attendance from which Archie and I had revolted.  But notable events had happened that day in his church.  A black man, the Rev. John Something-or-other, had been preaching.  Tam was full of the portent. 'A nagger,' he said, 'a great black chap as big as your father, Archie.'  He seemed to have banged the bookboard with some effect, and had kept Tam, for once in his life, awake.  He had preached about the heathen in Africa, and how a black man was as good as a white man in the sight of God, and he had forecast a day when the negroes would have something to teach the British in the way of civilization.  So at any rate ran the account of Tam Dyke, who did not share the preacher's views.  'It's all nonsense, Davie.  The Bible says that the children of Ham were to be our servants.  If I were the minister I wouldn't let a nigger into the pulpit.  I wouldn't let him farther than the Sabbath school.'  Night fell as we came to the broomy spaces of the links, and ere we had breasted the slope of the neck which separates Kirkcaple Bay from the cliffs it was as dark as an April evening with a full moon can be.  Tam would have had it darker.  He got out his lantern, and after a prodigious waste of matches kindled the candle-end inside, turned the dark shutter, and trotted happily on.  We had no need of his lighting till the Dyve Burn was reached and the path began to descend steeply through the rift in the crags.  It was here we found that some one had gone before us. Archie was great in those days at tracking, his ambition running in Indian paths.  He would walk always with his head bent and his eyes on the ground, whereby he several times found lost coins and once a trinket dropped by the provost's wife.  At the edge of the burn, where the path turns downward, there is a patch of shingle washed up by some spate.  Archie was on his knees in a second.  'Lads,' he cried, 'there's spoor here;' and then after some nosing, 'it's a man's track, going downward, a big man with flat feet.  It's fresh, too, for it crosses the damp bit of gravel, and the water has scarcely filled the holes yet.'  We did not dare to question Archie's woodcraft, but it puzzled us who the stranger could be.  In summer weather you might find a party of picnickers here, attracted by the fine hard sands at the burn mouth. But at this time of night and season of the year there was no call for any one to be trespassing on our preserves.  No fishermen came this way, the lobster-pots being all to the east, and the stark headland of the Red Neb made the road to them by the water's edge difficult.  The tan-work lads used to come now and then for a swim, but you would not find a tan-work lad bathing on a chill April night. Yet there was no question where our precursor had gone.  He was making for the shore. Tam unshuttered his lantern, and the steps went clearly down the corkscrew path.  'Maybe he is after our cave.  We'd better go cannily.'  The glim was dowsed--the words were Archie's--and in the best contraband manner we stole down the gully.  The business had suddenly taken an eerie turn, and I think in our hearts we were all a little afraid.  But Tam had a lantern, and it would never do to turn back from an adventure which had all the appearance of being the true sort.  Half way down there is a scrog of wood, dwarf alders and hawthorn, which makes an arch over the path.  I, for one, was glad when we got through this with no worse mishap than a stumble from Tam which caused the lantern door to fly open and the candle to go out. We did not stop to relight it, but scrambled down the screes till we came to the long slabs of reddish rock which abutted on the beach.  We could not see the track, so we gave up the business of scouts, and dropped quietly over the big boulder and into the crinkle of cliff which we called our cave.  There was nobody there, so we relit the lantern and examined our properties.  Two or three fishing-rods for the burn, much damaged by weather; some sea-lines on a dry shelf of rock; a couple of wooden boxes; a pile of driftwood for fires, and a heap of quartz in which we thought we had found veins of gold--su"]]]
