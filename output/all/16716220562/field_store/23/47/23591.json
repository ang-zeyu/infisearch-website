It is visible during clear weather (and particularly sharply visible in the strange clearness you get after a tornado) from a hundred miles to seawards, and anything more perfect than Fernando Po when you sight it, as you occasionally do from far-away Bonny Bar, in the sunset, floating like a fairy island made of gold or of amethyst, I cannot conceive.  It is almost equally lovely at close quarters, namely from the mainland at Victoria, nineteen miles distant.  Its moods of beauty are infinite; for the most part gentle and gorgeous, but I have seen it silhouetted hard against tornado-clouds, and grandly grim from the upper regions of its great brother Mungo.  And as for Fernando Po in full moonlight--well there! you had better go and see it yourself.  The whole island is, or rather I should say was, heavily forested almost to its peak, with a grand and varied type of forest, very rich in oil palms and tree-ferns, and having an undergrowth containing an immense variety and quantity of ferns and mosses. Sugar-cane also grows wild here, an uncommon thing in West Africa. The last botanical collection of any importance made from these forests was that of Herr Mann, and its examination showed that Abyssinian genera and species predominated, and that many species similar to those found in the mountains of Mauritius, the Isle de Bourbon, and Madagascar, were present.  The number of European plants (forty-three genera, twenty-seven species) is strikingly large, most of the British forms being represented chiefly at the higher elevations.  What was more striking was that it showed that South African forms were extremely rare, and not one of the characteristic types of St. Helena occurred.  Cocoa, coffee, and cinchona, alas! flourish in Fernando Po, as the coffee suffers but little from the disease that harasses it on the mainland at Victoria, and this is the cause of the great destruction of the forest that is at present taking place.  San Thome, a few years ago, was discovered by its surprised neighbours to be amassing great wealth by growing coffee, and so Fernando Po and Principe immediately started to amass great wealth too, and are now hard at work with gangs of miscellaneous natives got from all parts of the Coast save the Kru.  For to the Kruboy, \"Panier,\" as he calls \"Spaniard,\" is a name of horror worse even than Portugee, although he holds \"God made white man and God made black man, but dem debil make Portugee,\" and he also remembers an unfortunate affair that occurred some years ago now, in connection with coffee-growing.  A number of Krumen engaged themselves for a two years' term of labour on the Island of San Thome, and when they arrived there, were set to work on coffee plantations by the Portuguese.  Now agricultural work is \"woman's palaver,\" but nevertheless the Krumen made shift to get through with it, vowing the while no doubt, as they hopefully notched away the moons on their tally-sticks, that they would never let the girls at home know that they had been hoeing.  But when their moons were all complete, instead of being sent home with their pay to \"We country,\" they were put off from time to time; and month after month went by and they were still on San Thome, and still hoeing.  At last the home-sick men, in despair of ever getting free, started off secretly in ones and twos to try and get to \"We country\" across hundreds of miles of the storm- haunted Atlantic in small canoes, and with next to no provisions. The result was a tragedy, but it might easily have been worse; for a few, a very few, were picked up alive by English vessels and taken back to their beloved \"We country\" to tell the tale.  But many a canoe was found with a dead Kruboy or so in it; and many a one which, floating bottom upwards, graphically spoke of madness caused by hunger, thirst, and despair having driven its occupants overboard to the sharks.  My Portuguese friends assure me that there was never thought of permanently detaining the boys, and that they were only just keeping them until other labourers arrived to take their place on the plantations.  I quite believe them, for I have seen too much of the Portuguese in Africa to believe that they would, in a wholesale way, be cruel to natives.  But I am not in the least surprised that the poor Krumen took the Portuguese logo and amanha for Eternity itself, for I have frequently done so.  The greatest length of the island lies N.E. and S.W., and amounts to thirty-three miles; the mean breadth is seventeen miles.  The port, Clarence Cove, now called Santa Isabel by the Spaniards--who have been giving Spanish names to all the English-named places without any one taking much notice of them--is a very remarkable place, and except perhaps Gaboon the finest harbour on the West Coast.  The point that brings Gaboon anchorage up in line with Clarence Cove is its superior healthiness; for Clarence is a section of a circle, and its shores are steep rocky cliffs from 100 to 200 feet high, and the place, to put it very mildly, exceedingly hot and stuffy.  The cove is evidently a partly submerged crater, the submerged rim of the crater is almost a perfect semi-circle seawards--having on it 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10 fathoms of water save almost in the centre of the arc where there is a passage with 12 to 14 fathoms.  Inside, in the crater, there is deeper water, running in places from 30 to 45 fathoms, and outside the submerged rim there is deeper water again, but rocky shoals abound.  On the top of the shore cliffs stands the dilapidated little town of Clarence, on a plateau that falls away slightly towards the mountain for about a mile, when the ground commences to rise into the slopes of the Cordillera.  On the narrow beach, tucked close against the cliffs, are a few stores belonging to the merchants, where goods are placed on landing, and there is a little pier too, but as it is usually having something done to its head, or else is closed by the authorities because they intend doing something by and by, the chances are against its being available for use.  Hence it usually comes about that you have to land on the beach, and when you have done this you make your way up a very steep path, cut in the cliffside, to the town.  When you get there you find yourself in the very dullest town I know on the Coast.  I remember when I first landed in Clarence I found its society in a flutter of expectation and alarm not untinged with horror. Clarence, nay, the whole of Fernando Po, was about to become so rackety and dissipated as to put Paris and Monte Carlo to the blush. Clarence was going to have a cafe; and what was going to go on in that cafe I shrink from reciting.  I have little hesitation now in saying this alarm was a false one. When I next arrived in Clarence it was just as sound asleep and its streets as weed-grown as ever, although the cafe was open.  My idea is that the sleepiness of the place infected the cafe and took all the go out of it.  But again it may have been that the inhabitants were too well guarded against its evil influence, for there are on the island fifty-two white laymen, and fifty-four priests to take charge of them {44}--the extra two being, I presume, to look after the Governor's conduct, although this worthy man made a most spirited protest against this view when I suggested it to him; and in addition to the priests there are several missionaries of the Methodist mission, and also a white gentleman who has invented a new religion.  Anyhow, the cafe smoulders like a damp squib.  When you spend the day on shore and when, having exhausted the charms of the town,--a thing that usually takes from between ten minutes to a quarter of an hour,--you apply to an inhabitant for advice as to the disposal of the rest of your shore leave, you are told to \"go and see the coals.\"  You say you have not come to tropical islands to see a coal heap, and applying elsewhere for advice you probably get the same.  So, as you were told to \"go and see the coals\" when you left your ship, you do as you are bid. These coals, the remnant of the store that was kept here for the English men-of-war, were left here when the naval station was removed.  The Spaniards at first thought of using them, and ran a tram-way from Clarence to them.  But when the tramway was finished, their activity had run out too, and to this day there the coals remain.  Now and again some one has the idea that they are quite good, and can be used for a steamer, and some people who have tried them say they are all right, and others say they are all wrong.  And so the end of it will be that some few thousand years hence there will be a serious quarrel among geologists on the strange pocket of coal on Fernando Po, and they will run up continents, and raise and lower oceans to explain them, and they will doubtless get more excitement and pleasure out of them than you can nowadays.  The history of the English occupation of Fernando Po seems often misunderstood, and now and then one hears our Government reviled for handing it over to the Spaniards.  But this was unavoidable, for we had it as a loan from Spain in 1827 as a naval station for our ships, at that time energetically commencing to suppress the slave trade in the Bights; the idea being that this island would afford a more healthy and convenient spot for a naval depot than any port on the coast itself.  More convenient Fernando Po certainly was, but not more healthy, and ever since 1827 it has been accumulating for itself an evil reputation for unhealthiness which is only languishing just at present because there is an interval between its epidemics--fever in Fernando Po, even more than on the mainland, having periodic outbursts of a more serious type than the normal intermittent and remittent of the Coast.  Moreover, Fernando Po shares with Senegal the undoubted yet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5893"],["title","Two Little Women on a Holiday (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team.

I can't tell you this way. Come on over, just as quick as you can.\"  \"But I haven't finished my Algebra, and it's nearly dinner time, anyway.\"  \"No it isn't,--and no matter if it is. Come on, I tell you! You'd come fast enough if you knew what it's about!\"  \"Tell me, then.\"  \"I say I can't,--over the telephone. Oh, Dolly, come on, and stop fussing!\"  The telephone receiver at Dotty's end of the wire was hung up with a click, and Dolly began to waggle her receiver hook in hope of getting Dotty back. But there was no response, so Dolly rose and went for her coat. Flinging it round her, and not stopping to get a hat, she ran next door to Dotty Rose's house.  It was mid January, and the six o'clock darkness was lighted only by the street lights. Flying across the two lawns that divided the houses, Dolly found Dotty awaiting her at the side door.  \"Hurry up in, Doll,\" she cried, eagerly, \"the greatest thing you ever heard! Oh, the very greatest! If you only CAN! Oh, if you ONLY can!\"  \"Can what? Do tell me what you're talking about.\" Dolly tossed her coat on the hall rack, and followed Dotty into the Roses' living-room. There she found Dotty's parents and also Bernice Forbes and her father. What could such a gathering mean? Dolly began to think of school happenings; had she cut up any mischievous pranks or inadvertently done anything wrong? What else could bring Mr. Forbes to the Roses' on what was very evidently an important errand? For all present were eagerly interested,--that much was clear. Mr. and Mrs. Rose were smiling, yet shaking their heads in uncertainty; Bernice was flushed and excited; and Mr. Forbes himself was apparently trying to persuade them to something he was proposing.  This much Dolly gathered before she heard a word of the discussion. Then Mrs. Rose said, \"Here's Dolly Fayre. You tell her about it, Mr. Forbes.\"  \"Oh, let me tell her,\" cried Bernice.  \"No,\" said Mr. Rose, \"let her hear it first from your father. You girls can chatter afterward.\"  So Mr. Forbes spoke. \"My dear child,\" he said to Dolly, \"my Bernice is invited to spend a week with her uncle, in New York City. She is privileged to ask you two girls to accompany her if you care to.\"  Dolly listened, without quite grasping the idea. She was slow of thought, though far from stupid. And this was such a sudden and startling suggestion that she couldn't quite take it in.  \"Go to New York, for a week. Oh, I couldn't. I have to go to school.\"  Mrs. Rose smiled. \"That's just the trouble, Dolly. Dot has to go to school, too,--at least, she ought to. Bernice, likewise. But this invitation is so delightful and so unusual, that I'm thinking you three girls ought to take advantage of it. The question is, what will your parents say?\"  \"Oh, they'll never let me go!\" exclaimed Dolly, decidedly. \"They don't want anything to interfere with my lessons.\"  \"No, and we feel the same way about Dotty. But an exceptional case must be considered in an exceptional manner. I think your people might be persuaded if we go about it in the right way.\"  \"I don't believe so,\" and Dolly looked very dubious. \"Tell me more about it.\"  \"Oh, Doll, it's just gorgeous!\" broke in Bernice. \"Uncle Jeff,--he's father's brother,--wants me to spend a week with him. And he's going to have my cousin, Alicia, there at the same time. And he wants us to bring two other girls, and Alicia can't bring one, 'cause she's at boarding school, and none of the girls can get leave,--that is, none that she wants. So Uncle said for me to get two, if I could,--and I want you and Dot.\"  \"A whole week in New York! Visiting!\" Dolly's eyes sparkled as the truth began to dawn on her. \"Oh, I WISH I could coax Mother into it. I've never been to New York to stay any time. Only just for the day. How lovely of you, Bernie, to ask us!\"  \"There's no one else I'd rather have, but if you can't go, I'll have to ask Maisie May. I must get two.\"  \"Are you going anyway, Dots?\"  \"I don't know. I want to go terribly, but I don't want to go without you, Dolly. Oh, WON'T your mother let you?\"  \"The only way to find out is to ask her,\" said Mr. Forbes, smiling. \"Suppose I go over there now and ask. Shall I go alone, or take you three chatterboxes along?\"  \"Oh, let us go,\" and Dotty sprang up; \"we can coax and you can tell about the arrangements.\"  \"Very well,\" agreed Mr. Forbes, \"come along, then.\"  So the four went across to the Fayre house, and found the rest of Dolly's family gathered in the library.  \"Here is Mr. Forbes, Daddy,\" said Dolly, as they entered.  Mr. and Mrs. Fayre and Trudy, Dolly's older sister, greeted the visitor cordially, and looked with smiling inquiry at the eager faces of the three girls.  Dolly went and sat on the arm of her mother's chair, and, putting an arm around her, whispered, \"Oh, Mumsie, please, PLEASE do say yes! Oh, please do!\"  \"Yes to what?\" returned Mrs. Fayre, patting her daughter's shoulder.  \"Mr. Forbes will tell you. Listen.\"  \"It's this way, my dear people,\" began Mr. Forbes. He was a man with an impressive manner, and it seemed as if he were about to make a speech of grave importance, as, indeed, from the girls' point of view, he was. \"My brother Jefferson, who lives in New York, has invited my daughter to spend a week in his home there. He has asked also another niece, Miss Alicia Steele. He wants these girl visitors to bring with them two friends, and as Alicia does not wish to avail herself of that privilege, Bernice may take two with her. She wants to take Dotty and Dolly. There, that's the whole story in a nutshell. The question is, may Dolly go?\"  \"When is this visit to be made?\" asked Mrs. Fayre.  \"As soon as convenient for all concerned. My brother would like the girls to come some day next week, and remain one week.\"  \"What about school?\" and Mrs. Fayre looked decidedly disapproving of the plan.  \"That's just it!\" exclaimed Dotty. \"We knew you'd say that! But, Mrs. Fayre, my mother says this is the chance of a lifetime,--almost,--and we ought, we really OUGHT to take advantage of it.\"  \"But to be out of school for a whole week,--and what with getting ready and getting home and settled again, it would mean more than a week--\"  \"But, mother, we could make up our lessons,\" pleaded Dolly, \"and I DO want to go! oh, I do want to go, just AWFULLY!\"  \"I should think you would,\" put in Trudy. \"Let her go, mother, it'll be an education in itself,--the visit will. Why, the girls can go to the museums and art galleries and see all sorts of things.\"  \"Of course we can,\" said Bernice, \"and my uncle has a beautiful house and motor cars and everything!\"  \"That's another point,\" said Mr. Fayre, gravely. \"You must realise, Mr. Forbes, that my little girl is not accustomed to grandeur and wealth. I don't want her to enjoy it so much that she will come back discontented with her own plain home.\"  \"Oh, nonsense, my dear sir! A glimpse of city life and a taste of frivolity will do your girl good. Dolly is too sensible a sort to be a prey to envy or discontent. I know Dolly fairly well, and I can vouch for her common sense!\"  \"So can I,\" said Bernice. \"Doll will enjoy everything to the limit, but it won't hurt her disposition or upset her happiness to see the sights of the city for a short time. Oh, please, Mr. Fayre, do let her go.\"  \"Just as her mother thinks,\" and Mr. Fayre smiled at the insistent Bernice.  \"Tell me of the household,\" said Mrs. Fayre. \"Is your brother's wife living?\"  \"Jeff has never been married,\" replied Mr. Forbes. \"He is an elderly bachelor, and, I think is a bit lonely, now and then. But he is also a little eccentric. He desires no company, usually. It is most extraordinary that he should ask these girls. But I think he wants to see his two nieces, and he fears he cannot entertain them pleasantly unless they have other companions of their own age.\"  \"And who would look after the girls?\"  \"Mrs. Berry, my brother's housekeeper. She is a fine noble-hearted and competent woman, who has kept his house for years. I know her, and I am perfectly willing to trust Bernice to her care. She will chaperon the young people, for I doubt if my brother will go to many places with them. But he will want them to have the best possible time, and will give them all the pleasure possible.\"  \"That part of it is all right, then,\" smiled Mrs. Fayre; \"it is, to my mind, only the loss of more than a week of the school work that presents the insuperable objection.\"  \"Oh, don't say insuperable,\" urged Mr. Forbes. \"Can't you bring yourself to permit that loss? As Dolly says, the girls can make up their lessons.\"  \"They can--but will they?\"  \"I will, mother,\" cried Dolly; \"I promise you I will study each day while I'm in New York. Then I can recite out of school hours after I get back, and I'll get my marks all the same.\"  \"But, Dolly dear, you can't study while you are in New York. There would be too much to distract you and occupy your time.\"  \"Oh, no, Mrs. Fayre,\" observed Bernice, \"we couldn't be all the time sightseeing. I think it would be fine for all "]]]
