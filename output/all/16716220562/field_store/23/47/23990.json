PAYMENTS  Often a life insurance policy is used as security for the payment of a mortgage.  The mortgagee, if there be buildings on the property, should see that the buildings are insured and that the policy or policies are made out in his name.  If the insurance policy is in the mortgagor's name he may collect and keep the insurance money.  The mortgagor must meet, as stipulated, every payment of the principal and interest.  Failure to meet one payment can result in a legal foreclosure.  When a payment is made, the date and the amount must be entered on the back of the note. This should be done in the presence of the mortgagor.  If possible always pay the obligation by check.  If a payment is accepted on a mortgage and the amount is not sufficient to meet the sum required, the interest is first settled in full, the rest is credited to the principal.  When the full amount, with interest, is paid in, it becomes the duty of the mortgagee to have the mortgage \"discharged.\"  A complete settlement is when, all payments being made, the mortgagee surrenders the note and its security, and causes to be written by the register, on the margin of the copy in his books, the words, \"discharged,\" or \"satisfied,\" affixing thereto his official signature and the date.  ASSIGNMENTS  A mortgage is regarded in law as personal property.  A mortgage need not remain in the hands of the mortgagee in order to be valid. It can be sold like bonds, stocks or other property, and there are men who deal only in that form of security.  In order to sell a mortgage, the owner must make, to the purchaser, what is known as an \"assignment of mortgage.\"  The assignment should be recorded in the same way as the original mortgage, the assignee paying the fee.  REDEMPTION OF MORTGAGES  While the rule as to the redemption of mortgages remains the same in some localities that it formerly was, the law in most places is now more lenient.  Now the mortgagor who has failed is usually given by law an extension of time in which to make good the payment of principal and interest.  Lenders, when the interest is met, are content to let the mortgage run on as an investment, though it will often be found, in such cases, that it is better to make a new mortgage.  EQUITY OF REDEMPTION  Where the payments on a mortgage have not been met and the instrument has not been foreclosed, the mortgagor has still what is known as an \"equity of redemption.\"  In some states after the foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the property there is still a period of redemption of from sixty days to six years.  The mode of foreclosure differs in some states. The usual method is to foreclose on an order from the court, and to have the sale conducted by a court officer.  The proceeds from the sale are used to pay the principal, interests and costs. If there is money left over it is paid to the mortgagor, whose interests in the property are then at an end.  Many people, not familiar with business methods, are inclined to regard a mortgage as something of a disgrace, when, as a matter of fact it is a most usual and honorable means of raising money for the securing of a home or the conducting of a business.  Nearly all of the great railroads of the country have been built by the sale of the mortgage bonds, which are usually renewed when due, and are sought out as a safe and sane form of investment.  The fact that a mortgage payment has to be met on a farm is often in itself the strongest inducement to industry and economy.     CHAPTER IV  WILLS    Whether farmer, manufacturer, merchant or professional man, and whether in youth, mid-age or declining years, every owner of personal or real property, or both, should make a will.  If you have not made a will, get over the foolish notion that it is a premonition of death, and do so at once.  A will is a written and signed declaration of the disposition one wishes to have made of his property in the event of his death.  The maker of a valid will must be of sound mind and not less than twenty-one years of age.  Women, whether married or single, if of proper age, are competent to make a will.  OF TWO KINDS  A will may be written or unwritten.  Unwritten wills are known as \"nun-cupative.\" Nun-cupative wills are employed only when through accident, or sudden seizure by a fatal disease, the time necessary to write and sign a will cannot be had.  The unwritten will must be authenticated by reliable and unprejudiced witnesses, and generally it can dispose of personal property only.  In the written will no precise form is necessary, though when drawn by a lawyer it usually begins with some such form as: \"I, George Brown, being of sound mind and good understanding, do make and declare this to be my last will and testament\", etc.  A will is not necessarily permanent. It may be cancelled or changed in any way by the maker before his death, or a new will can be made.  The last will cancels all preceding wills.  An addition to an existing will is known as a \"codicil.\"  A man making a will is called a testator.  A woman making a will is called a testatrix.  LIMITATIONS OF WILLS  A man has a right to dispose of his property by will or gift as he chooses, but if he is married the law compels him to consider the rights of another.  The husband cannot, by will or otherwise, deprive his wife of her \"right of dower\" in his real estate and appurtenances.  Unless she chooses to accept, the wife need not accept other property that is bequeathed her in lieu of dower.  The wife's dower interest in her husband's estate is a life interest only. On her death it goes to the husband's heirs, as if there had been no widow.  In some states there is no right of dower.  HOW TO MAKE A WILL  The will not only shows the purpose of the testator, but it serves as a bar to litigation among the natural heirs.  Any man or woman can write out his or her will, but unless quite familiar with such work it is better to employ a lawyer for the purpose.  The person named in the will to carry out the purpose of the testator is known as the \"executor\".  No person, not twenty-one at the time the will is proved can act as an executor.  Neither a convict, an imbecile, nor one known to be a drug fiend or an habitual drunkard, is eligible for the post of an executor. If an executor be appointed against his will, the law does not compel him to serve.  There must be at least two witnesses to a will, some states require three.  The witnesses need not know the contents of the will, but they must understand before signing that it is a will, and they must see it signed by the testator.  Under the common law the will is void if the witnesses are beneficiaries.  In some states a will so witnessed is valid, except that the witnesses cannot receive their legacies.  All the witnesses should sign at the same time and add their addresses.  If an heir at law, say a child, is not mentioned in the will, the law assumes that he was forgotten by the testator and generally gives the share the heir would be entitled to if there were no will.  At the end of the will the testator, in the presence of the witnesses, should write his name in full.  AN EXECUTOR'S DUTIES  An executor is the legal representative of the testator. It is his duty to see that the provisions of the will are carried out.  No man is qualified to act as executor who is not competent to make a will. Executors, unless relieved by the provisions of the will, are required to file bonds, proportioned to the value of the estate, for the faithful performance of their duties.  Should there be no executor named in the will, or if the person so named refuses to act, or if he dies or resigns, the court will appoint a person to act in his place.  The executor appointed by the court is known or called an \"administrator with the will annexed.\"  In some states the court having jurisdiction of wills and estates of deceased is known as \"the probate,\" in others it is called the \"Surrogate's Court,\" and in still others, \"The Orphan's.\"  ADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR DUTIES  If a man, owning property, dies without making a will, the judge of the proper court will appoint an administrator to settle the estate.  This is the method of procedure:  1. A person, interested in getting the estate settled, goes before the proper judge and asks him to appoint an administrator. 2. The administrator must give the same bond as an executor. Their duties are the same. 3. In settling the estate the administrator is governed by the law, and by the special directions of the officer having jurisdiction in such matters. 4. He must make a careful list of all the property belonging to the estate. The value of the personal property is estimated by men specially appointed by the court for the purpose and known as \"appraisers\". 5. The administrator must account for every item of property that comes into his possession. 6. All debts of deceased must be first paid, including funeral expenses. If the proceeds of the personal property are not sufficient for this purpose, the administrator may, if there be real estate, sell the whole or part of it, on an order from the court.  DEBTS  Debts must be paid in an order prescribed by law. The following is the usual order:  1. Funeral expenses and expenses of last illness. 2. The widow's allowance or award. 3. Debts due the state or municipality. 4. Claims of other creditors.  Whatever property is left, after paying these obligatory sums, is divided among the rightful heirs under the direction of the court, and in the manner provided by law.  The administrator must advertise, in one or more county papers the fact that he has been appointed to settle the estate of the deceased, whose name is given, and he must ask that all claims be presented within a given period, usually"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6167"],["title","Business Hints for Men and Women (#3)"],["body","at six months.  When the estate is settled to the satisfaction of the court, the same authority releases the administrator and his bondsmen.  All the fees connected with the settlement are regarded as debts and must be paid from the proceeds of the estate before closing.  THE FINAL SETTLEMENT  When the debts are paid and the residue divided among the heirs, the administrator files his account. If it is allowed the case ends.  The parties of interest in an estate may agree to settle it out of court. This saves expense, but it is not the safest way.     CHAPTER V  LETTER WRITING    What has been said about deeds and mortgages applies not only to the farmer, but also to every owner of a building lot. The same may be said of wills. They have a business interest for the town as well as for the country dweller.  BUSINESS LETTERS  The purpose of this book being \"strictly business,\" no attempt will be made to instruct the reader in anything not connected with the subject under consideration.  Social, friendly, and such letters are matters for individual time and taste, and no rule can be laid down for their writing, but the business letter is a different matter, and one which deserves special consideration from every man or woman who receives an order by mail, or who sends one.  To write a good business letter is no mean accomplishment, and although a gift with some, it can be acquired by all.  A letter is, in a way, a testimonial of the character and ability of the writer.  The purpose of a business letter is to express just what you want and no more.  Any man with a good common school education, and a little patient practice, can soon learn to write as good a business letter as the college graduate.  Correct spelling may not be general, but it is certainly desirable.  Letter writing, as in the preparation of other papers, has its own well-recognized forms, and these may be easily learned.  Every properly constructed business letter should consist of the following parts:    1. Where written from.   2. When written.   3. To whom written.   4. Address.   5. Salutation.   6. Introduction.   7. Purpose of letter.   8. Complimentary ending.   9. Signature.  THE HEADING  The letter should begin by giving the address of the writer, followed by the date on which it was written. This will enable the recipient to direct his reply.  If from a city, the street and number should be given.  If many letters are written it will be convenient to have the permanent address of the writer printed.  The writing should be plain, and there should be no doubt in the mind of the reader as to the proper spelling of the address and signature.  Avoid the hieroglyphics which some vain men adopt in signing their names. It may be fanciful, but it does not imply consideration for the time and patience of strangers.  The following forms will serve to illustrate the type of heading used in ordinary business letters:                       1       124 Smith St., Brownsville, Mass.                       September 4, 1910. Mr. John Smith,   Doylestown, Penna. Dear Sir:                       2                          Leroy, Mass.,                      September 5, 1910. Messrs. Brown and Jones,   Denver, Col. Gentlemen:                       3    4 Seminole St., Fort Smith, Ark.                   September 6, 1910. Mrs. Mary J. Robinson,   Lansing, Cal. Dear Madam:  The \"Mr.,\" \"Mrs.,\" \"Madam,\" and \"Miss\" are titles of courtesy and should not be omitted. The abbreviation \"Esq.\" for Esquire is sometimes used; but the two titles Mr. and Esq. should never be used with one name, as \"Mr. John Smith, Esq.\"  If a man is known by a military or other title, always use it, but never precede it with \"Mr.\" nor follow it with \"Esq.\"  Clergymen should always be addressed as \"Rev.,\" the abbreviation for Reverend. If he is a doctor of divinity, add D.D. to the name, as \"Rev. John Smith, D.D.\"  Medical doctors may be addressed as \"Dr. John Smith,\" or \"John Smith, M.D.\"  THE GREETING  The greeting or salutation is a term of courtesy or esteem used in addressing the one to whom the letter is sent.  \"Sir\" is the formal greeting, and is used in addressing officials, or any strange male person. \"Sirs,\" or \"Gentlemen\" may be used in the plural. \"Dear Sir,\" or \"My Dear Sir,\" is the usual form of greeting when a business letter is addressed to an individual.  Where the writer is acquainted with the person addressed, the usual form of greeting is \"Dear Mr. Smith.\"  THE LETTER ITSELF  If writing in response to a letter received, the writer should begin in some such way as this:  Mr. Thomas Brown,   Newburg, N. Y. My Dear Sir:    Your favor of the second inst. is just to hand. In reply permit me to state, etc., etc.  This should be followed by the necessary statement, set forth in clear, simple words.  Be sure of yourself.  The secret of good writing is clear thinking.  ENDING THE LETTER  There is much in the proper ending of a letter. In the ordinary business letter the usual ending may be, \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours very truly,\" or \"Yours respectfully.\" Other endings used in writing to business acquaintances are, \"Yours sincerely,\" or \"Very sincerely yours,\" or you may substitute the words \"Cordially\" or \"Heartily\" for \"sincerely.\"  SIGNING THE LETTER  The name of the writer should be so clear and distinct as to leave no doubt as to the spelling.  The name should always be written in the same way.  If your name is George W. Brown, do not write it at one time as here given, and again as G. Washington Brown, or G. W. Brown.  Adopt one form and stick to it.  If you are writing for a firm or for another as clerk or secretary, always sign the firm name, and below it your own name preceded by the word \"per,\" meaning \"by\" or \"through.\"  THE MATERIALS  Never use scraps of paper or soiled paper to write on if better can be had. The materials of a letter affect the receiver, particularly if a stranger, just as one is affected by the garb of a stranger before he speaks.  Use a good pen and black ink.  Fold your paper so that it will fit the envelope.  Avoid blots and erasures; they indicate carelessness or unbecoming haste.  Address your letter distinctly.  Here is a good form:         Mr. George W. White,                         Boston, 1101 Sioux St.             Mass.  LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION  At some time or another one has to write a letter of introduction, and sometimes he has had to pay for it.  If you should give such a letter to a man to introduce him to another with whom you trade, the law has held that the introducer is responsible for any reasonable bills the introduced may contract with the receiver of the letter.  Never give a letter of introduction to a man you are not sure of.  In addressing a letter of introduction which is to be handed in person, do it in this way:           Mr. George W. Brown,                    Washington, D. C.   Introducing       Mr. Henry Wilson.  This shows on its face the nature of the communication.  Here is a good form:         111 Payne Ave., Montrose, Ill.                     September 27, 1910. Mr. Norman R. Lloyd,   Chicago, Ill. Dear Mr. Lloyd:       This will introduce my esteemed friend Mr. Thomas T. Fletcher, of this town. Mr. Fletcher contemplates opening a drug store in Chicago. Should he do so he will prove an acquisition to your City. Any favor you can render him will be much appreciated by,              Yours faithfully,                      George W. Brown.  RECOMMENDATIONS  Every man of standing and every employer of labor is at times called on to certify to the character, or to give a testimonial to some esteemed employee who is about to seek his fortune in another place.  If you are about to hire a stranger, it adds to your confidence and to his chances if he have a testimonial as to character and fitness from his last employer, or from some man whose word you value.  The letter of recommendation is usually of a general character and not addressed to any particular. It should open in this way:  \"To whom it may concern.\"  Follow this with your testimonial and sign it.  TITLES  The President of the United States is addressed as: \"His Excellency,\"   William H. Taft,     Executive Mansion,       Washington, D. C.  Cabinet officers, Senators, Congressmen, members of the Legislature, and Mayors of cities are usually addressed as \"Hon.,\" the abbreviation of honorable.  The title \"Hon.\" like \"Esq.\" is often misused. After all titles of courtesy are not obligatory, unless we regard the unwritten law of custom in such matters as binding.  The very best kind of a letter, and perhaps the hardest to write, is that in which the writer appears to be talking to us face to face.     CHAPTER VI  BILLS, RECEIPTS AND ACCOUNTS    Try to understand clearly the meaning of all the business terms you have to use.  The terms \"bill\" and \"invoice\" usually mean the same thing, that is, a \"bill of sale.\" This applies to goods sold, or services rendered.  The merchant sends you an itemized invoice of the goods you ordered and he has shipped.  The carpenter sends you an itemized bill of the work done by your order.  Such a document should be regarded not as a \"dun,\" but rather as a record of the contract or transaction.  In the foregoing case the merchant and the carpenter are the creditors, the recipient of the goods or work is the debtor.  BILLS FOR GOODS  In writing out a bill the date is the first thing to be considered. This should be the same in form as a business letter.  This form will serve as an illustration:                      Glenwood, N. J.                      October 1, 1910. Robert Brown   To George L. White, Dr. Sept 2.
