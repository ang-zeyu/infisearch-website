Hayes     CHAPTER I  A NEW USE FOR A DICTAPHONE  The rain fell in torrents over the great battlefield, as Hal Paine and Chester Crawford, taking advantage of the inky blackness of the night, crept from the shelter of the American trenches that faced the enemy across \"No Man's Land.\"  In the trenches themselves all was silence. To a spectator it would have seemed that the occupants were, either dead or asleep; yet such was not the case.  It is true that most of the men had \"turned in\" for the night, sleeping on their arms, for there was no means of telling at what moment the enemy might issue from his trenches in another of the night raids that had marked this particular sector for the last few weeks; but the ever vigilant sentinels stood watch over the sleeping men.  They would sound an alarm, should occasion demand, in ample time to arouse the sleepers if an enemy's head appeared in the darkness.  Hal and Chester, of course, left the American trenches with full knowledge of these sentinels; otherwise they might have been shot.  Once beyond the protecting walls of earth, they moved swiftly and silently toward the German trenches less than a hundred feet away--just the distance from the home plate to first base on a baseball diamond, as Hal put it--ninety feet.  These two lads, who now advanced directly toward the foe, were lieutenants in the first American expeditionary force to reach France to lend a hand in driving back the legions of the German Emperor, who still clung tenaciously to territory he had conquered in the early stages of the great war.  These boys had, at one time, been captains in the British army, and had had three years of strenuous times and exciting adventures in the greatest of all wars.  Their captaincies they'd won through gallant action upon the field of battle.  American lads, they had been left in Berlin at the outbreak of hostilities, when they were separated from Hal's mother.  They made their way to Belgium, where, for a time, they saw service, with King Albert's troops.  Later they fought under the tricolor, with the Russians and the British and Canadians.  When the United 'States declared war on Germany, Hal and Chester, with others, were sent to America, where they were of great assistance in training men Uncle Sam had selected to officer his troops.  They had relinquished their rank in the British army to be able to do this.  Now they found themselves again on French soil, but fighting under the Stars and Stripes.  On this particular night they advanced toward tile German lines soon after an audience with General John J. Pershing, commander-in-chief of the American expeditionary forces.  In one hand Chester carried a little hardwood box, to which were attached coils of wire.  In the other hand the lad held a revolver.  Hal, likewise, carried his automatic in his hand.  Each was determined to give a good account of himself should his presence be discovered.  It was unusually quiet along the front this night.  It was too dark for opposing \"snipers\"--sharpshooters--to get in their work, and the voices of the big guns, which, almost incessantly for the last few weeks, had hurled shells across the intervening distance between the two lines of trenches, were stilled.  Hal pressed close to Chester.  \"Rather creepy out here,\" he said.  \"Right,\" returned Chester in a whisper.  \"I've the same feeling myself.  It forebodes, trouble, this silence, to my way of thinking. The Huns are probably hatching up some devilment.\"  \"Well, we may be able to get the drift of it, with that thing you have under your arm,\" was the other's reply.  \"Sh-h!\" was Chester's reply, and he added: \"We're getting pretty close.\"  They continued their way without further words.  Hal, slightly in advance, suddenly uttered a stifled exclamation. Instantly Chester touched his arm.  \"What's the matter?\" he asked in a whisper.  \"Matter is,\" Hal whispered back, \"that we have come to a barbed-wire entanglement.  I had forgotten about those things.\"  \"Well, that's why you brought your 'nippers' along,\" said Chester. \"Cut the wire.\"  Hal produced his \"nippers.\"  It was but the work of a moment to nip the wires, and again the lads advanced cautiously.  A moment later there loomed up before them the German trenches.  Hal stood back a few feet while Chester advanced and placed the little hardwood box upon the top of the trench, and scraped over it several handfuls of earth.  The lad now took the coil of wire in his hand, and stepped down and back. The lads retraced their steps toward their own lines, Chester the while unrolling the coil of wire.  The return was made without incident.  Before their own trenches the boys were challenged by a sentinel.  \"Halt!\" came the command.  \"Who goes there?\"  \"Friends,\" returned Hal.  The sentinel recognized the lad's voice.  \"Advance,\" he said with a breath of relief.  A moment later the boys were safe back among their own men.  \"If the Germans had been as watchful as our own sentries, we would have had more trouble,\" said Hal.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" was Chester's reply.  \"I saw a German sentinel, but he didn't see me in the darkness.\"  \"It was his business to see, however,\" declared Hal.  \"Well, that's true.  But now let's listen and seen if we can overhear anything of importance.\"  Chester clapped the little receiver to his ear.  Hal became silent.  Ten minutes later Chester removed the receiver from his ear.  \"Nothing doing,\" he said.  \"I can hear some of the men talking, but they are evidently playing cards.\"  \"Let me listen a while,\" said Hal.  Chester passed the receiver to his chum, and the latter listened intently.  For some moments he heard nothing save the jabbering jargon of German troopers apparently interested in a card game.  He was about to take the receiver from his ear, however, when another voice caught his attention  He held up a hand, which told Chester that something of importance was going on.  \"All right, general,\" said a voice in the German trenches, which was carried plainly to Hal's ear by the Dictaphone.  \"Stay!\" came another voice.  \"You will also order Colonel Blucher to open with all his guns at the moment that General Schmidt's men advance to the attack.\"  \"At midnight, sir,\" was the reply.  \"That is all.\"  The voices became silent.  Quickly Hal reported to Chester what he had overheard.  \"It's up to us to arouse Captain O'Neill,\" said Chester.  He hurried off.  Hal glanced at his watch.  It was 10 o'clock.  \"Two hours,\" the lad muttered.  \"Well, I guess we'll be ready for them.\"  A few moments later Captain O'Neill appeared.  He was in command of the Americans in the first line trenches.  These troops were in their present positions for \"seasoning\" purposes.  They had been the first to be given this post of honor.  They had held it for several days, and then had been relieved only to be returned to the front within ten days.  At command from Captain O'Neill, Hal made his way to the south along the line of trenches, and approached the quarters of General Dupres. To an orderly he announced that he bore a communication from Captain O'Neill.  \"Mon Dieu!\" exclaimed the French commander, when Hal had delivered his message.  \"So they will attack us in the night, eh?  Well, we shall receive them right warmly.\"  He thought a moment. Then he said:  \"You will tell Captain O'Neill to move from the trenches with his entire strength.  He will advance ten yards and then move one hundred yards north.  You may tell him that I will post a force of equal strength to the south.  He will not fire until my French troops open on the enemy.\"  Hal returned and reported to Captain O'Neill.  It was plain that the American officer didn't understand the situation fully.  However, he simply shrugged his shoulders.  \"General Dupres is in command,\" he said.  \"I guess he knows what he's doing or he wouldn't be here.\"  Captain O'Neill gave the necessary commands.  The American troops moved from the trenches in silence.  There was a suppressed air of excitement, however, for each man was eager for the coming of he knew not what.      CHAPTER II  THE AMBUSH  At the point decided upon for the American troops to take their stand was a collection of shell holes.  In order that the attack upon the Germans might have all the elements of surprise when it came, Captain O'Neill ordered his men into these holes to guard against any possibility of surprise.  Now, it is an undoubted fact that when a man curls himself up with two or three preliminary twists, after the fashion of a dog going to bed, in a perfectly circular shell hole on a night as black as this, he is extremely likely to lose his sense of direction.  That is what happened to Private Briggs, of the American forces.  The Americans lay in silence, awaiting the moment of the surprise. Suddenly it came.  From the position held by the French broke out a fusillade.  The Germans had approached closer.  Captain O'Neill and his followers got to their feet and dashed upon the enemy--all but Private Briggs.  Besides his rifle, each man was armed with hand grenades--bombs--which he carried in his pockets.  When Private Briggs sprang to his feet, it took him so long to untangle himself that the others had gone on ahead of him.  He could see no one.  However, want of courage was not one of his failings.  He determined upon a plan of his own.  While the other combatants were locked in a death grapple, he would advance by himself to the German trenches and hurl his grenade.  To think with Private Briggs was to act.  He advanced at a run.  Suddenly a parapet loomed up before him.  In this same parapet, low down, Briggs beheld a black and gaping aperture--plainly a loophole of some kind.  Without a moment's hesitation, Briggs hurled a Mills grenade straight through the loophole, and, forgetting for the moment that others of his troop were not with him, uttered a wild"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6083"],["title","The Boy Allies with Haig in Flanders; Or, the Fighting Canadians of Vimy Ridge (#1)"],["body","ech!  \"Come on, boys!\"  He leaped to the top of the trench by himself, and jumped from the parapet--into his own trenches.  Having lost his sense of direction, he had charged the wrong way.  As the bomb exploded in the French trenches, men rushed toward him. Still grasping several bombs, Briggs stared at them in wide-eyed surprise.  An officer rushed up to him.  Briggs explained the situation.  Fortunately, no one had been wounded by the bomb.  \"You Americans!  You Americans!\" exclaimed the French officer.  \"But go!\" he commanded.  \"Your men are out there,\" pointing; \"do you not hear the sounds of conflict?  If you charge there with the courage with which you have charged here, you may be of some use after all.\"  Briggs wasted no time.  With a flush on his face, he again leaped to the parapet, and, a moment later, disappeared in the darkness, running as swiftly as he could to where firing indicated that the battle raged.  Meanwhile, what of Hal and Chester, and the American troops?  As the Americans poured from their shell holes after the first outburst of firing, they dashed toward where they could make out the forms of German infantry close at hand.  From beyond, the French, who had taken up a position as the French commander had outlined to Hal, poured a withering fire into the foe. The German officer in command immediately halted his advance, wheeled his men, and gave battle to the French.  At almost the same moment the Americans dashed upon his men from the rear.  One volley the Americans poured into the Germans, then their arms drew back and an avalanche of hand grenades sped on their mission of death.  The execution was terrific.  In vain the German officers attempted to hold their men to the work in hand.  Teuton ranks lost formation, and, as the Americans advanced with the bayonet, the enemy broke and fled.  The German surprise had failed; it had been on the other hand.  As the Germans retreated, the Americans pursued.  A body of troops, led by Hal, came, upon an isolated group of the enemy.  \"Surrender!\" cried Hal.  The Germans needed no second offer. Their guns went to the ground at the lad's words, and they raised their hands in the air.  They were made prisoners and sent to the rear.  There was one officer among them--a captain.  At the command from the French general, pursuit of the enemy was abandoned, much to the disgust of the American troops, who were for pursuing the Germans clear to their trenches, and beyond, if possible. Hal and Chester, however, realized the wisdom of the French commander's order, for there was a possibility, should the French and Americans advance too close, of their being set upon by overwhelming numbers from the German trenches, or of their being caught by batteries of rapid-firers, which most likely would have meant extermination.  As the French and Americans moved back toward their trenches--the engagement had consumed only it few minutes--Hal and Chester saw a man come flying toward them.  This, although the lads did not know it at the time, was Briggs.  Straight past the American troops Briggs sped, and disappeared in the darkness beyond.  \"Hello!\" said Hal, \"that man is an American.  Wonder where he's going?\"  \"It's Briggs, sir,\" said a man in the ranks.  \"He has queer spells some times.  Can we go after him, sir?\"  Hal put the question up to Captain O'Neill.  The captain hesitated.  \"My friend and I will go,\" said Hal.  \"We've been in this fighting game too long to take unnecessary chances, sir, but I don't like to see the man get into trouble when we can save him.\"  \"Very well,\" said the captain; \"you have my permission, but don't go too close.\"  \"I'd like another man, sir.\"  \"Take your choice.\"  Hal glanced at the men, and called:  \"McKenzie.\"  A soldier stepped forward.  This man, at one time, had been a top sergeant in the British army.  He had served through the Boer war in South Africa.  Hal had met him at the Fort Niagara training camp a few months before, and, while the man had failed to obtain a commission there, Hal had been able to have him enlisted in the regular army.  \"Will you go with us, McKenzie?\" asked the lad. McKenzie saluted.  \"Glad to, sir,\" he replied.  \"Good!  Then come on,\" said Hal.  \"We are wasting time here.\"  Hal led the way at a rapid trot.  He feared that Briggs had already approached too close to the German trenches, and the distance was so short that there was little likelihood of overtaking the man before he reached the trenches.  The only salvation was, so far as Hal could see, that Briggs might have stopped before he reached the trenches.  As the three pushed forward, there came a sudden explosion ahead, followed closely by a second blast.  The three redoubled their speed, and, a moment later, came in sight of the German trenches.  A strange sight met their eyes.  There, upon the top of the German parapet, stood Briggs.  His right arm was raised and in it the lads could see a bomb. Apparently the explosions a moment before had come from the same source.  As the three looked on, Briggs sent another bomb hurling down into the German lines.  There was a third blast.  \"Great Scott!\" cried Chester.  \"How can he get away with that?  Why don't they shoot him?\"  \"They're trying,\" said Hal.  \"You can hear the bullets.  They are flying over his head!\"  The lad raised his voice in a shout: \"Briggs! Come down here!\"  Briggs glanced down. Hal, Chester, and McKenzie had approached close now, and Briggs made out their features as he gazed down.  \"One moment, sir,\" he said, \"and I'll be with you.\"  Deliberately he drew back his arm again, and, a moment later his last bomb was hurled into the foe.  As the explosion resounded from the German trenches, Briggs leaped down lightly, approached Hal and Chester, and saluted.  \"I'm ready now, sir,\" he said.  \"Then run!\" cried Hal.  The four suited the action to the word, and dashed back toward the American trenches.  From behind a volley a rifle fire crackled after them.  \"Anybody hit?\" cried Hal, as they dashed along.  There were four negative answers.  Five minutes later the four were safe in the American trenches.      CHAPTER III  A DANGEROUS MISSION  It was noon of the following day.  Hal and Chester stood at attention before General Pershing, the American commander-in-chief.  The latter gazed at them long and earnestly.  With a half shrug he muttered, as he turned to his desk:  \"But they are so young.\"  The words were not meant for the lads' ears, but Hal and Chester overheard them.  Hal spoke:  \"If you please, Sir,\" he said quietly, \"we are not so young as you seem to believe.  To me, Sir, our experience seems very old.\"  General Pershing glanced up from a pile of papers he was perusing. Again he looked at the two lads in silence.  The two boys bore the close scrutiny unflinchingly.  At length General Pershing got to his feet, and, approaching Hal and Chester, laid a. hand on the shoulder of each.  \"You are brave youngsters,\" he said quietly.  \"From what you have done since the American troops reached France, I know that Marshal Joffre and General Haig have not spoken too highly of you; and yet,\" here the American commander hesitated a moment before continuing; \"and yet the piece of work I have in sight will entail, perhaps, more danger, more finesse, and more resourcefulness than any mission you have ever undertaken.\"  \"You will find that we shall not be found wanting, sir,\" said Chester respectfully.  \"I am sure of that,\" was General Pershing's response.  \"It isn't that I question your courage or your resourcefulness; but, because of your youth, in this particular business, I question your wisdom.  It is a task for older and wiser heads, but--\"  General Pershing broke off and became silent.  Hal and Chester did not interrupt his meditations.  At length the general continued:  \"I wish to say before going any further that this mission, if you undertake it, in all probabilities, will mean death for one of you.  It is for this reason that the task in hand requires the services of at least two men.  One to go and come back, and the other to go--and come back if he can.  It may be that neither will return, and yet one must return if the safety of his country is to be maintained.\"  \"We shall do our best, sir, if we are entrusted with the mission,\" said Chester quietly.  Again General Pershing hesitated.  Then he took his decision.  \"Draw up stools here,\" he said, and made room at his desk.  The lads did so.  General Pershing spoke in a low voice.  \"You both undoubtedly know,\" he said, \"that since the American declaration of war on Germany, the activity of German agents and spies in the United States has grown to startling dimensions?\"  The lads nodded and General Pershing continued:  \"Very good.  Now, I have before me a cable, in code, from the state department, which advises me that the department of state must have, at all hazards, a list of the most important German agents in America.  It is essential.  Here,\" the general pushed a slip of paper in front of the lads, \"is the translation of the code message.\"  Hal and Chester glanced at the paper. It read:  \"German prime minister has lists of agents and spies in United States. Realize it is not in your province to get list, but would enlist your aid, because our diplomatic agents have all left Germany.  List is essential to safeguarding coast defenses and munitions plants.  Do what you can.\"  The message was signed by the secretary of state.  Hal passed the paper back to General Pershing.  The latter eyed him keenly.  \"'You realize the dangerous nature of the work?\" he questioned.  \"Perfectly, sir; also its importance.  We shall be glad to undertake it, sir.\"  \"Very well.  Now I have a little information that may be of value.  In another code message from the state department I am advised that efforts are being made to get a member of the diplomatic staff back into Berlin.  There is one person in the German capital whom you may trust.\"  General"]]]
