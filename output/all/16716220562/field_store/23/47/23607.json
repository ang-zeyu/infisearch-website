Stevenson's maternal grandfather, was the Rev. Dr Balfour,    minister of Colinton--one of the finest-looking old men I ever    saw--tall, upright, and ruddy at eighty.  But he was marvellously    feeble as a preacher, and often said things that were deliciously,    unconsciously, unintentionally laughable, if not witty.  We were near    Colinton for some years; and Mr Russell (of the _Scotsman_), who once    attended the Parish Church with us, was greatly tickled by Balfour    discoursing on the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, remarking that    Mrs P-'s conduct was 'highly improper'!\"  The estimate of R. L. Stevenson was not and could not be final in this case, for _Weir of Hermiston_ and _Catriona_ were yet unwritten, not to speak of others, but the passages reflect a certain side of Edinburgh opinion, illustrating the old Scripture doctrine that a prophet has honour everywhere but in his own country.  And the passages themselves bear evidence that I violate no confidence then, for they were given to me to be worked into any after-effort I might make on Stevenson.  My friend was a good and an acute critic who had done some acceptable literary work in his day.     CHAPTER III--THE CHILD FATHER OF THE MAN   R. L. Stevenson was born on 13th November 1850, the very year of the death of his grandfather, Robert Stevenson, whom he has so finely celebrated.  As a mere child he gave token of his character.  As soon as he could read, he was keen for books, and, before very long, had read all the story-books he could lay hands on; and, when the stock ran out, he would go and look in at all the shop windows within reach, and try to piece out the stories from the bits exposed in open pages and the woodcuts.  He had a nurse of very remarkable character--evidently a paragon--who deeply influenced him and did much to form his young mind--Alison Cunningham, who, in his juvenile lingo, became \"Cumy,\" and who not only was never forgotten, but to the end was treated as his \"second mother.\" In his dedication of his _Child's Garden of Verses_ to her, he says:     \"My second mother, my first wife,    The angel of my infant life.\"  Her copy of _Kidnapped_ was inscribed to her by the hand of Stevenson, thus:     \"TO CUMY, FROM HER BOY, THE AUTHOR.    SKERRYVORE, 18_th_ _July_ 1888.\"  Skerryvore was the name of Stevenson's Bournemouth home, so named after one of the Stevenson lighthouses.  His first volume, _An Inland Voyage_ has this pretty dedication, inscribed in a neat, small hand:     \"MY DEAR CUMY,--If you had not taken so much trouble with me all the    years of my childhood, this little book would never have been written.    Many a long night you sat up with me when I was ill.  I wish I could    hope, by way of return, to amuse a single evening for you with my    little book.  But whatever you think of it, I know you will think    kindly of     THE AUTHOR.\"  \"Cumy\" was perhaps the most influential teacher Stevenson had.  What she and his mother taught took effect and abode with him, which was hardly the case with any other of his teachers.     \"In contrast to Goethe,\" says Mr Baildon, \"Stevenson was but little    affected by his relations to women, and, when this point is fully gone    into, it will probably be found that his mother and nurse in    childhood, and his wife and step-daughter in later life, are about the    only women who seriously influenced either his character or his art.\"    (p. 32).  When Mr Kelman is celebrating Stevenson for the consistency and continuity of his undogmatic religion, he is almost throughout celebrating \"Cumy\" and her influence, though unconsciously.  Here, again, we have an apt and yet more striking illustration, after that of the good Lord Shaftesbury and many others, of the deep and lasting effect a good and earnest woman, of whom the world may never hear, may have had upon a youngster of whom all the world shall hear.  When Mr Kelman says that \"the religious element in Stevenson was not a thing of late growth, but an integral part and vital interest of his life,\" he but points us back to the earlier religious influences to which he had been effectually subject.  \"His faith was not for himself alone, and the phases of Christianity which it has asserted are peculiarly suited to the spiritual needs of many in the present time.\"  We should not lay so much weight as Mr Kelman does on the mere number of times \"the Divine name\" is found in Stevenson's writings, but there is something in such confessions as the following to his father, when he was, amid hardship and illness, in Paris in 1878:     \"Still I believe in myself and my fellow-men and the God who made us    all. . . . I am lonely and sick and out of heart.  Well, I still hope;    I still believe; I still see the good in the inch, and cling to it.  It    is not much, perhaps, but it is always something.\"  Yes, \"Cumy\" was a very effective teacher, whose influence and teaching long remained.  His other teachers, however famous and highly gifted, did not attain to such success with him.  And because of this non-success they blamed him, as is usual.  He was fond of playing truant--declared, indeed, that he was about as methodic a truant as ever could have existed.  He much loved to go on long wanderings by himself on the Pentland Hills and read about the Covenanters, and while yet a youth of sixteen he wrote _The Pentland Rising_--a pamphlet in size and a piece of fine work--which was duly published, is now scarce, and fetches a high price.  He had made himself thoroughly familiar with all the odd old corners of Edinburgh--John Knox's haunts and so on, all which he has turned to account in essays, descriptions and in stories--especially in _Catriona_.  When a mere youth at school, as he tells us himself, he had little or no desire to carry off prizes and do just as other boys did; he was always wishing to observe, and to see, and try things for himself--was, in fact, in the eyes of schoolmasters and tutors something of an _idler_, with splendid gifts which he would not rightly apply.  He was applying them rightly, though not in their way.  It is not only in his _Apology for Idlers_ that this confession is made, but elsewhere, as in his essay on _A College Magazine_, where he says, \"I was always busy on my own private end, which was to learn to write.  I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read and one to write in!\"  When he went to College it was still the same--he tells us in the funniest way how he managed to wheedle a certificate for Greek out of Professor Blackie, though the Professor owned \"his face was not familiar to him\"!  He fared very differently when, afterwards his father, eager that he should follow his profession, got him to enter the civil engineering class under Professor Fleeming Jenkin.  He still stuck to his old courses--wandering about, and, in sheltered corners, writing in the open air, and was not present in class more than a dozen times.  When the session was ended he went up to try for a certificate from Fleeming Jenkin.  \"No, no, Mr Stevenson,\" said the Professor; \"I might give it in a doubtful case, but yours is not doubtful: you have not kept my classes.\"  And the most characteristic thing--honourable to both men--is to come; for this was the beginning of a friendship which grew and strengthened and is finally celebrated in the younger man's sketch of the elder.  He learned from Professor Fleeming Jenkin, perhaps unconsciously, more of the _humaniores_, than consciously he did of engineering.  A friend of mine, who knew well both the Stevenson family and the Balfours, to which R. L. Stevenson's mother belonged, recalls, as we have seen, his acting in the private theatricals that were got up by the Professor, and adds, \"He was then a very handsome fellow, and looked splendidly as Sir Charles Pomander, and essayed, not wholly without success, Sir Peter Teazle,\" which one can well believe, no less than that he acted such parts splendidly as well as looked them.  _Longman's Magazine_, immediately after his death, published the following poem, which took a very pathetic touch from the circumstances of its appearance--the more that, while it imaginatively and finely commemorated these days of truant wanderings, it showed the ruling passion for home and the old haunts, strongly and vividly, even not unnigh to death:     \"The tropics vanish, and meseems that I,    From Halkerside, from topmost Allermuir,    Or steep Caerketton, dreaming gaze again.    Far set in fields and woods, the town I see    Spring gallant from the shallows of her smoke,    Cragg'd, spired, and turreted, her virgin fort    Beflagg'd.  About, on seaward drooping hills,    New folds of city glitter.  Last, the Forth    Wheels ample waters set with sacred isles,    And populous Fife smokes with a score of towns,    There, on the sunny frontage of a hill,    Hard by the house of kings, repose the dead,    My dead, the ready and the strong of word.    Their works, the salt-encrusted, still survive;    The sea bombards their founded towers; the night    Thrills pierced with their strong lamps.  The artificers,    One after one, here in this grated cell,    Where the rain erases and the rust consumes,    Fell upon lasting silence.  Continents    And continental oceans intervene;    A sea uncharted, on a lampless isle,    Environs and confines their wandering child    In vain.  The voice of generations dead    Summons me, sitting distant, to arise,    My numerous footsteps nimbly to retrace,    And all mutation over, stretch me down    In that denoted city of the dead.\"     CHAPTER IV--HEREDITY ILLUSTRATED   At first sight it would seem hard to trace any illustration of the doctrine of heredity in the case of this master of romance.  George Eliot's dictum that we are, each one of us, but an omnibus carrying down the traits of our ancestors, does not appear at all to hold here.  This fanciful realist, this "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/590"],["title","Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial (#5)"],["body","naive-wistful humorist, this dreamy mystical casuist, crossed by the innocent bohemian, this serious and genial essayist, in whom the deep thought was hidden by the gracious play of wit and phantasy, came, on the father's side, of a stock of what the world regarded as a quiet, ingenious, demure, practical, home-keeping people. In his rich colour, originality, and graceful air, it is almost as though the bloom of japonica came on a rich old orchard apple-tree, all out of season too.  Those who go hard on heredity would say, perhaps, that he was the result of some strange back-stroke.  But, on closer examination, we need not go so far.  His grandfather, Robert Stevenson, the great lighthouse-builder, the man who reared the iron-bound pillar on the destructive Bell Rock, and set life-saving lights there, was very intent on his professional work, yet he had his ideal, and romantic, and adventurous side.  In the delightful sketch which his famous grandson gave of him, does he not tell of the joy Robert Stevenson had on the annual voyage in the _Lighthouse Yacht_--how it was looked forward to, yearned for, and how, when he had Walter Scott on board, his fund of story and reminiscence all through the tour never failed--how Scott drew upon it in _The Pirate_ and the notes to _The Pirate_, and with what pride Robert Stevenson preserved the lines Scott wrote in the lighthouse album at the Bell Rock on that occasion:     \"PHAROS LOQUITUR     \"Far in the bosom of the deep    O'er these wild shelves my watch I keep,    A ruddy gem of changeful light    Bound on the dusky brow of night.    The seaman bids my lustre hail,    And scorns to strike his timorous sail.\"  And how in 1850 the old man, drawing nigh unto death, was with the utmost difficulty dissuaded from going the voyage once more, and was found furtively in his room packing his portmanteau in spite of the protests of all his family, and would have gone but for the utter weakness of death.  His father was also a splendid engineer; was full of invention and devoted to his profession, but he, too, was not without his romances, and even vagaries.  He loved a story, was a fine teller of stories, used to sit at night and spin the most wondrous yarns, a man of much reserve, yet also of much power in discourse, with an aptness and felicity in the use of phrases--so much so, as his son tells, that on his deathbed, when his power of speech was passing from him, and he couldn't articulate the right word, he was silent rather than use the wrong one.  I shall never forget how in these early morning walks at Braemar, finding me sympathetic, he unbent with the air of a man who had unexpectedly found something he had sought, and was fairly confidential.  On the mother's side our author came of ministers.  His maternal grandfather, the Rev. Dr Balfour of Colinton, was a man of handsome presence, tall, venerable-looking, and not without a mingled authority and humour of his own--no very great preacher, I have heard, but would sometimes bring a smile to the faces of his hearers by very naive and original ways of putting things.  R. L. Stevenson quaintly tells a story of how his grandfather when he had physic to take, and was indulged in a sweet afterwards, yet would not allow the child to have a sweet because he had not had the physic.  A veritable Calvinist in daily action--from him, no doubt, our subject drew much of his interest in certain directions--John Knox, Scottish history, the '15 and the '45, and no doubt much that justifies the line \"something of shorter-catechist,\" as applied by Henley to Stevenson among very contrasted traits indeed.  But strange truly are the interblendings of race, and the way in which traits of ancestors reappear, modifying and transforming each other.  The gardener knows what can be done by grafts and buddings; but more wonderful far than anything there, are the mysterious blendings and outbursts of what is old and forgotten, along with what is wholly new and strange, and all going to produce often what we call sometimes eccentricity, and sometimes originality and genius.  Mr J. F. George, in _Scottish Notes and Queries_, wrote as follows on Stevenson's inheritances and indebtedness to certain of his ancestors:     \"About 1650, James Balfour, one of the Principal Clerks of the Court    of Session, married Bridget, daughter of Chalmers of Balbaithan,    Keithhall, and that estate was for some time in the name of Balfour.    His son, James Balfour of Balbaithan, Merchant and Magistrate of    Edinburgh, paid poll-tax in 1696, but by 1699 the land had been sold.    This was probably due to the fact that Balfour was one of the    Governors of the Darien Company.  His grandson, James Balfour of    Pilrig (1705-1795), sometime Professor of Moral Philosophy in    Edinburgh University, whose portrait is sketched in _Catriona_, also    made a Garioch [Aberdeenshire district] marriage, his wife being    Cecilia, fifth daughter of Sir John Elphinstone, second baronet of    Logie (Elphinstone) and Sheriff of Aberdeen, by Mary, daughter of Sir    Gilbert Elliot, first baronet of Minto.     \"Referring to the Minto descent, Stevenson claims to have 'shaken a    spear in the Debatable Land and shouted the slogan of the Elliots.'  He    evidently knew little or nothing of his relations on the Elphinstone    side.  The Logie Elphinstones were a cadet branch of Glack, an estate    acquired by Nicholas Elphinstone in 1499.  William Elphinstone, a    younger son of James of Glack, and Elizabeth Wood of Bonnyton, married    Margaret Forbes, and was father of Sir James Elphinstone, Bart., of    Logie, so created in 1701. . . .     \"Stevenson would have been delighted to acknowledge his relationship,    remote though it was, to 'the Wolf of Badenoch,' who burned Elgin    Cathedral without the Earl of Kildare's excuse that he thought the    Bishop was in it; and to the Wolf's son, the Victor of Harlaw [and] to    his nephew 'John O'Coull,' Constable of France. . . . Also among    Tusitala's kin may be noted, in addition to the later Gordons of    Gight, the Tiger Earl of Crawford, familiarly known as 'Earl Beardie,'    the 'Wicked Master' of the same line, who was fatally stabbed by a    Dundee cobbler 'for taking a stoup of drink from him'; Lady Jean    Lindsay, who ran away with 'a common jockey with the horn,' and    latterly became a beggar; David Lindsay, the last Laird of Edzell [a    lichtsome Lindsay fallen on evil days], who ended his days as hostler    at a Kirkwall inn, and 'Mussel Mou'ed Charlie,' the Jacobite ballad-    singer.     \"Stevenson always believed that he had a strong spiritual affinity to    Robert Fergusson.  It is more than probable that there was a distant    maternal affinity as well.  Margaret Forbes, the mother of Sir James    Elphinstone, the purchaser of Logie, has not been identified, but it    is probable she was of the branch of the Tolquhon Forbeses who    previously owned Logie.  Fergusson's mother, Elizabeth Forbes, was the    daughter of a Kildrummy tacksman, who by constant tradition is stated    to have been of the house of Tolquhon.  It would certainly be    interesting if this suggested connection could be proved.\" {5}     \"From his Highland ancestors,\" says the _Quarterly Review_, \"Louis    drew the strain of Celtic melancholy with all its perils and    possibilities, and its kinship, to the mood of day-dreaming, which has    flung over so many of his pages now the vivid light wherein figures    imagined grew as real as flesh and blood, and yet, again, the ghostly,    strange, lonesome, and stinging mist under whose spell we see the    world bewitched, and every object quickens with a throb of infectious    terror.\"  Here, as in many other cases, we see how the traits of ancestry reappear and transform other strains, strangely the more remote often being the strongest and most persistent and wonderful.  \"It is through his father, strange as it may seem,\" says Mr Baildon, \"that Stevenson gets the Celtic elements so marked in his person, character, and genius; for his father's pedigree runs back to the Highland clan Macgregor, the kin of Rob Roy.  Stevenson thus drew in Celtic strains from both sides--from the Balfours and the Stevensons alike--and in his strange, dreamy, beautiful, and often far-removed fancies we have the finest and most effective witness of it.\"  Mr William Archer, in his own characteristic way, has brought the inheritances from the two sides of the house into more direct contact and contrast in an article he wrote in _The Daily Chronicle_ on the appearance of the _Letters to Family and Friends_.     \"These letters show,\" he says, \"that Stevenson's was not one of those    sunflower temperaments which turn by instinct, not effort, towards the    light, and are, as Mr Francis Thompson puts it, 'heartless and happy,    lackeying their god.'  The strains of his heredity were very    curiously, but very clearly, mingled.  It may surprise some readers to    find him speaking of 'the family evil, despondency,' but he spoke with    knowledge.  He inherited from his father not only a stern Scottish    intentness on the moral aspect of life ('I would rise from the dead to    preach'), but a marked disposition to melancholy and hypochondria.    From his mother, on the other hand, he derived, along with his    physical frailty, a resolute and cheery stoicism.  These two elements    in his nature fought many a hard fight, and the besieging forces from    without--ill-health, poverty, and at one time family dissensions--were    by no means without allies in the inner citadel of his soul.  His    spirit was courageous in the truest sense of the word: by effort and    conviction, not by temperamental insensibility to fear.  It is clear    that there was a period in his life (and that before the worst of his    bodily ills came upon him) when he was often within measurable    distance of Carlylean gloom.
