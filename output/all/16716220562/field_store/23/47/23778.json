It should be remarked that the term, \"spirits\" in the above passage cannot refer to self-existent, unbegotten intelligences of the revelations, considered in the foregoing note; and certainly this relationship of fatherhood to spirits is not one brought about in connection with generation of human life in this world. Paul makes a very sharp distinction between \"Fathers of our flesh\" and the \"Father of spirits,\" in the above. Fatherhood to spirits is manifestly a relationship established independent of man's earth-existence; and, of course, in an existence which preceded earthlife, where the uncreated intelligences are begotten spirits. Hence, the phrase \"shall we not be subject to the Father of spirits and live?\"  Christ is referred to by the writer of the epistle to the Colossians, as the \"first born of every creature;\" and the Revelator speaks of him as \"the beginning of the creation of God;\" and in the revelation already quoted so often (Doc. & Cov. sec. xciii.) Jesus represents himself as being in the \"beginning with the Father;\" and as \"the first born.\"  The reference to Jesus as the \"first born of every creature\" cannot refer to his birth into earth-life, for he was not the first-born into this world; therefore, his birth hare referred to must have reference to the birth of his spirit before his earth life.  The reference to Jesus as the \"beginning of the creation of God,\" cannot refer to his creation or generation in earth-life; for manifestly he was not the beginning of the creations of God in this world; therefore, he must have been the \"beginning\" of God's creation elsewhere, viz. in the spirit world, where he was begotten a spiritual personage; a son of God.  The reference to Jesus as the \"first born\"--and hence the justification for our calling him \"our Elder Brother\"--cannot refer to any relationship that he established in his earth-life, since as to the flesh he is not our \"elder brother,\" any more than he is the \"first born\" in the flesh; there were many born as to the flesh before he was, and older brothers to us, in the flesh, than he was. The relationship of \"elder brother\" cannot have reference to that estate where all were self-existent, uncreated and unbegotten, eternal intelligencies; for that estate admits of no such relation as \"elder,\" or \"younger;\" for as to succession in time, the fact on which \"younger\" or \"elder\" depend, the intelligences are equal, that is,--equal as to their eternity. Therefore, since the relationship of \"elder brother\" was not established by any circumstance in the earth-life of Jesus, and could not be established by any possible fact in that estate where all were self-existing intelligences, it must have been established in the spirit life, where Jesus, with reference to the hosts of intelligences designed to our earth, was the \"first born spirit,\" and by that fact became our \"Elder Brother,\" the \"first born of every creature,\" \"the beginning of the creations of God,\" as pertaining to our order of existence. (See note 10, lesson v.)  _3. Why God is God:_ \"These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they: I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than them all. * * * * * I dwell in the midst of them all; * * * I rule in the heavens above, and the earth beneath, in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligencies thine eyes have seen from the beginning.\" (Word of the Lord to Abraham, Book of Abraham, ch. iii: 19-21.) \"I am more intelligent than them all.\" By this expression I do not understand the scripture to mean that God is more intelligent than any one of the other intelligencies, but more intelligent than all of them combined. His intelligence is greater than that of the mass. It is this fact doubtless which makes this One, \"more intelligent than them all,\" God. He is the All-Wise One! The All-Powerful One! What he tells other intelligencies to do must be precisely the wisest, fittest thing that they could anywhere or anyhow learn--the thing which it will in all ways behoove them with right loyal thankfulness, and nothing doubting, to do.[A] There goes with this, too, the thought that this All Wise One, will be the Unselfish One, the-All-Loving One, the One who desires that which is highest, and best; not for Himself alone, but for all; and that will be best for Him too. His glory, His power, His joy will be enhanced by the uplifting of all, by enlarging them; by increasing their joy, power, and glory. And because this All Intelligent One is all this, and does all this, the other intelligences worship Him, submit their judgments and their will to His judgment and His will. He knows, and can do that which is best; and this submission of the mind to the most Intelligent, Wisest--wiser than all--is worship. This the whole meaning of the doctrine and the life of the Christ expressed in--\"Father, not my will but Thy will, be done.\"  [Footnote A: The language here is paraphrased from Carlyle's lecture, \"The Hero as King.\"]  _5. The Desire of God for the Advancement of Other Intelligences:_ \"The first principles of man are self-existent with God. God himself, finding he was in the midst of spirits and glory, because he was more intelligent, saw proper to institute laws whereby the rest could have a privilege to advance like himself. The relationship we have with God places us in a situation to advance in knowledge. He has power to institute laws, to instruct the weaker intelligences, that they may be exalted with himself, so that they might have one glory upon another, and all that knowledge, power, glory, and intelligence which is requisite in order to save them in the world of spirits. This is good doctrine. It tastes good. I can taste the principles of eternal life, and so can you. They are given to me by the revelations of Jesus Christ; and I know that when I tell you these words of eternal life as they are given to me, you taste them, and I know that you believe them. You say honey is sweet, and so do I. I can also taste the spirit of eternal life. I know it is good; and when I tell you of these things which were given me by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, you are bound to receive them as sweet, and rejoice more and more.\"--Joseph Smith. (Mill. Star, Vol. XXIII, p. 262.)  _6. Value of the Doctrine of Eternal Existence:_ But what is the value of this doctrine of the eternal existence of uncreated intelligences? In what way does it contribute to the better apprehension of that which is, the truth? These considerations, of course, should not be and are not our first concern. Our first consideration should be and has been the truth of the thing. But since that is now settled by what God has revealed about it, we may well, if possible, ascertain what helpfulness there is in the doctrine, for the right apprehension of the general scheme of things. This apprehension, I believe, it affects in a very vital way. As matters now stand, the usually accepted Christian doctrine on the matter of man's origin is that God of his free-will created of nothing the spirits and bodies of men. That they are as he would have them, since in his act of creation he could have had them different if he had so minded. Then why should he--being infinitely wise and powerful and good, for so the creeds represent him--why should he create by mere act of volition beings such as men are, not only capable of, but prone to, moral evil? Which, in the last analysis of things, in spite of all special pleadings to the contrary, leaves responsibility for moral evil with God? God's creative acts culminating thus, the next pertinent questions are: Then what of the decreed purpose of God to punish moral evil? and what of the much vaunted justice of God in that punishment? Wherein lies the just responsibility of man if he was so created as to love evil and to follow it? It is revolting to reason, as it is shocking to piety to think, that God of his own free will created some men, not only inclined to wickedness, but desperately so inclined; while others, he of his own volition created with dispositions naturally inclined toward goodness. In like manner stands it with man in relation to his inclination to faith, and to disbelief: and yet, under the orthodox belief all are included under one law for judgment! Under the conception of the existence of independent, uncreated, self-existent intelligences, who by the inherent nature of them are of various degrees of intelligence, doubtless differing from each other in many ways, yet alike in their eternity and their freedom; with God standing in the midst of them, \"more intelligent than them all,\" and proposing the betterment of their condition--progress to higher levels of being, and power through change--under this conception of things how stand matters? There is the begetting of these intelligences, spirits; the spirits, men; the men, resurrected personages of infinite possibilities; at each change increased powers for development are added to intelligences, yet ever present through all the processes of betterment is the self-existent entity, the \"intelligencies,\" with the tremendous fact of his consciousness and his moral freedom, and his indestructibility;--he has his choice of moving upward or downward in every estate he occupies; often defeating, for a time, at least, the benevolent purposes of God respecting him, through his own perverseness; he passes through dire experiences, suffers terribly, yet learns by what he suffers, so that his very suffering becomes a means to his improvement; he learns swiftly, or slowly, according to the inherent nature of him, obedience to law; he learns that \"that which is governed by law, is also preserved by law, and perfected and sanctified by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60490"],["title","The Seventy's Course in Theology, Second Year (#4)"],["body"," same; and that which breaketh law abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself and willeth to abide in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice nor judgment. Therefore they must remain filthy still.\" (Doc. & Cov. sec. 88:34, 35.) This conception of things relieves God of the responsibility for the nature and status of intelligences in all stages of their development; their inherent nature and their volition make them primarily what they are, and this nature they may change, slowly, perhaps, yet change it they may. God has put them in the way of changing it by enlarging their intelligence through change of environment, through experiences; the only way God effects these self-existent beings is favorably; he creates not their inherent nature; he is not responsible for the use they make of their freedom; nor is he the author of their sufferings when they fall into sin: that arises out of the violations of law to which the \"intelligence\" subscribed, and must be endured until its lessons are learned.

The purpose of God in His Creations:_ \"And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying: Tell me I pray thee why these things [the creations of God upon which Moses had looked] are so, and by what Thou madest them. * * * And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things. * * * * * And by the Word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.

And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.

The Purpose of Man's Earth-Existence:_ \"Q. For What purpose are the spirits of men sent to take bodies upon the earth?  \"A. That they may be educated, developed, and perfected; that they may enjoy a fulness of knowledge, power, and glory forever, and thus increase the dominion and glory of God. (Jacques' Catechism, ch. 6.)  \"We came to this earth that we might have a body and present it pure before God in the celestial kingdom. The great principle of happiness consists in having a body. The devil has no body, and herein is his punishment. He is pleased when he can obtain the tabernacle of man, and when cast out by the Savior he asked to go into the herd of swine, showing that he would prefer a swine's body to having none.\"--Joseph Smith, Richards & Little's Compendium--\"Gems\", p. 288.  _3. \"Man is Spirit:_ The elements an eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy. The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples.\" (Doc. & Cov. sec. xciii, 33-35.)  _4. All Present at the Pre-creation Council:_ \"The first step in the salvation of man is the laws of eternal and self-existent principles. Spirits are eternal. At the first organization in heaven we were all present, and saw the Savior chosen and appointed and the plan of salvation made, and we sanctioned it.\"--Joseph Smith, Richard and Little's Compendium, \"Gems,\" p. 288.  _5. Council of the Gods:_    In Solemn council sat the Gods;     From Kolob's height supreme,   Celestial light blazed forth afar     O'er countless kokaubeam;   And faintest tinge, the fiery fringe     Of that resplendent day,   'Lumined the dark abysmal realm     Where earth in chaos lay.    Silence self-spelled; the hour was one     When thought doth most avail;   Of worlds unborn the destiny     Hung trembling in the scale.   Silence o'er all, and there arose,     Those kings and priests among,   A Power sublime, than whom appeared     None nobler 'mid the throng.    A stature mingling strength with grace.     Of meek though God-like mien,   The love-revealing countenance     Lustrous as lightning sheen;   Whiter his hair than ocean spray.     Or frost of alpine hill.   He spake;--attention grew more grave,     The stillness e'en more still.    \"Father!\"--the voice like music fell,     Clear as the murmuring flow   Of mountain streamlet trickling down     From heights of virgin snow.   \"Father,\" it said, \"since one must die,     Thy children to redeem.   Whilst earth, as yet unformed and void,     With pulsing life shall teem;    \"And thou, great Michael, foremost fall,     That mortal man may be,   And chosen Saviour yet must send,     Lo, here am I--send me!   I ask, I seek no recompense.     Save that which then were mine;   Mine be the willing sacrifice,     The endless glory, Thine!    \"Give me to lead to this lorn world,     When wandered from the fold,   Twelve legions of the noble ones     That now thy face behold;   Tried souls, mid untried spirits found;     That captained these may be,   And crowned the dispensations ail     With powers of Deity.    \"A love that hath redeemed all worlds.     All worlds must still redeem;   But mercy cannot justice rob--     Or where were Elohim?   Freedom--man's faith, man's work, God's grace--     Must span the great gulf o'er;   Life, death, the guerdon or the doom.     Rejoice we or deplore.\"    Silence once more. Then sudden rose     Aloft a towering form.   Proudly erect as towering peak     'Lumed by the gathering storm;   A presence bright and beautiful,     With eye of flashing fire,   A lip whose haughty curl bespoke     A sense of inward ire.    \"Give me to go!\" thus boldly cried.     With scarce concealed disdain;   \"And hence shall none, from heaven to earth,     That shall not rise again.   My saving plan exception scorns;     Man's agency unknown;   As recompense, I claim the right     To sit on yonder throne!\"    Ceased Lucifer. The breathless hush     Resumed and denser grew.   All eyes were turned; the general gaze     One common magnet drew.   A moment there was solemn pause;     Then, like the thunder-burst,   Rolled forth from lips omnipotent--     From Him both last and first:    \"Immanuel! thou my Messenger,     Till time's probation end.   And one shall go thy face before,     While twelve thy steps attend.   And many more, on that far shore,     The pathway shall prepare.   That I, the First, the last may come,     And earth my glory share.    \"Go forth, thou chosen of the Gods,     Whose strength shall in thee dwell!   Go down betime and rescue earth,     Dethroning death and hell.   On thee alone man's fate depends,     The fate of beings all.   Thou shalt not fail, though thou art free--     Free, but too great, to fall.\"      --Whitney's \"Elias,\" Canto III.

Free Agency:_ First as to the word \"free.\" The authorities define it to mean having liberty to follow ones own views, desires, inclinations, or choice. Possessed of self-initiatory power. Hence exempt from the arbitration, dominion or direction of others. By \"free agency\" is meant the power or capacity of acting freely, that is, without constraint of the law. A rational agent whose actions are determined by his own unstrained will. Wayland in his University sermons says, man was endowed with the gift of free agency. He has the same power to disobey the law of God as to obey it. If a man is not a free agent he is not the authority of his actions, and has, therefore, no responsibility, no moral personality at all. (Standard Dictionary). The term \"moral agent,\" means practically the same thing as \"free agent.\" \"A moral agent is a being that is capable of those actions that have a moral quality, and which can properly be denominated good or evil in a moral sense.\"  _2.
