One thing is certain:  as soon as our troops took possession, they at once proceeded to extinguish the flames to the best of their ability with the limited means at hand.  In any case, the example set by the Confederates in burning the village of Chambersburg, Pa., a town which was not garrisoned, would seem to make a defence of the act of firing the seat of government of the State most responsible for the conflict then raging, not imperative.  The Confederate troops having vacated the city, the mayor took possession, and sallied forth to meet the commander of the National forces for the purpose of surrendering the town, making terms for the protection of property, etc.  Sherman paid no attention at all to the overture, but pushed forward and took the town without making any conditions whatever with its citizens.  He then, however, co-operated with the mayor in extinguishing the flames and providing for the people who were rendered destitute by this destruction of their homes.  When he left there he even gave the mayor five hundred head of cattle to be distributed among the citizens, to tide them over until some arrangement could be made for their future supplies.  He remained in Columbia until the roads, public buildings, workshops and everything that could be useful to the enemy were destroyed.  While at Columbia, Sherman learned for the first time that what remained of Hood's army was confronting him, under the command of General Beauregard.  Charleston was evacuated on the 18th of February, and Foster garrisoned the place.  Wilmington was captured on the 22d. Columbia and Cheraw farther north, were regarded as so secure from invasion that the wealthy people of Charleston and Augusta had sent much of their valuable property to these two points to be stored.  Among the goods sent there were valuable carpets, tons of old Madeira, silverware, and furniture. I am afraid much of these goods fell into the hands of our troops. There was found at Columbia a large amount of powder, some artillery, small-arms and fixed ammunition.  These, of course were among the articles destroyed.  While here, Sherman also learned of Johnston's restoration to command.  The latter was given, as already stated, all troops in North and South Carolina.  After the completion of the destruction of public property about Columbia, Sherman proceeded on his march and reached Cheraw without any special opposition and without incident to relate. The railroads, of course, were thoroughly destroyed on the way.  Sherman remained a day or two at Cheraw; and, finally, on the 6th of March crossed his troops over the Pedee and advanced straight for Fayetteville.  Hardee and Hampton were there, and barely escaped. Sherman reached Fayetteville on the 11th of March.  He had dispatched scouts from Cheraw with letters to General Terry, at Wilmington, asking him to send a steamer with some supplies of bread, clothing and other articles which he enumerated.  The scouts got through successfully, and a boat was sent with the mail and such articles for which Sherman had asked as were in store at Wilmington; unfortunately, however, those stores did not contain clothing.  Four days later, on the 15th, Sherman left Fayetteville for Goldsboro. The march, now, had to be made with great caution, for he was approaching Lee's army and nearing the country that still remained open to the enemy.  Besides, he was confronting all that he had had to confront in his previous march up to that point, reinforced by the garrisons along the road and by what remained of Hood's army.  Frantic appeals were made to the people to come in voluntarily and swell the ranks of our foe.  I presume, however, that Johnston did not have in all over 35,000 or 40,000 men.  The people had grown tired of the war, and desertions from the Confederate army were much more numerous than the voluntary accessions.  There was some fighting at Averysboro on the 16th between Johnston's troops and Sherman's, with some loss; and at Bentonville on the 19th and 21st of March, but Johnston withdrew from the contest before the morning of the 22d.  Sherman's loss in these last engagements in killed, wounded, and missing, was about sixteen hundred.  Sherman's troops at last reached Goldsboro on the 23d of the month and went into bivouac; and there his men were destined to have a long rest.  Schofield was there to meet him with the troops which had been sent to Wilmington.  Sherman was no longer in danger.  He had Johnston confronting him; but with an army much inferior to his own, both in numbers and morale.  He had Lee to the north of him with a force largely superior; but I was holding Lee with a still greater force, and had he made his escape and gotten down to reinforce Johnston, Sherman, with the reinforcements he now had from Schofield and Terry, would have been able to hold the Confederates at bay for an indefinite period.  He was near the sea-shore with his back to it, and our navy occupied the harbors.  He had a railroad to both Wilmington and New Bern, and his flanks were thoroughly protected by streams, which intersect that part of the country and deepen as they approach the sea.  Then, too, Sherman knew that if Lee should escape me I would be on his heels, and he and Johnson together would be crushed in one blow if they attempted to make a stand.  With the loss of their capital, it is doubtful whether Lee's army would have amounted to much as an army when it reached North Carolina.  Johnston's army was demoralized by constant defeat and would hardly have made an offensive movement, even if they could have been induced to remain on duty.  The men of both Lee's and Johnston's armies were, like their brethren of the North, as brave as men can be; but no man is so brave that he may not meet such defeats and disasters as to discourage him and dampen his ardor for any cause, no matter how just he deems it.    CHAPTER LXIII.  ARRIVAL OF THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS--LINCOLN AND THE PEACE COMMISSIONERS --AN ANECDOTE OF LINCOLN--THE WINTER BEFORE PETERSBURG--SHERIDAN DESTROYS THE RAILROAD--GORDON CARRIES THE PICKET LINE--PARKE RECAPTURES THE LINE --THE LINE OF BATTLE OF WHITE OAK ROAD.  On the last of January, 1865, peace commissioners from the so-called Confederate States presented themselves on our lines around Petersburg, and were immediately conducted to my headquarters at City Point.  They proved to be Alexander H. Stephens, Vice-President of the Confederacy, Judge Campbell, Assistant-Secretary of War, and R. M. T. Hunt, formerly United States Senator and then a member of the Confederate Senate.  It was about dark when they reached my headquarters, and I at once conducted them to the steam Mary Martin, a Hudson River boat which was very comfortably fitted up for the use of passengers.  I at once communicated by telegraph with Washington and informed the Secretary of War and the President of the arrival of these commissioners and that their object was to negotiate terms of peace between he United States and, as they termed it, the Confederate Government.  I was instructed to retain them at City Point, until the President, or some one whom he would designate, should come to meet them.  They remained several days as guests on board the boat.  I saw them quite frequently, though I have no recollection of having had any conversation whatever with them on the subject of their mission.  It was something I had nothing to do with, and I therefore did not wish to express any views on the subject.  For my own part I never had admitted, and never was ready to admit, that they were the representatives of a GOVERNMENT.  There had been too great a waste of blood and treasure to concede anything of the kind.  As long as they remained there, however, our relations were pleasant and I found them all very agreeable gentlemen.  I directed the captain to furnish them with the best the boat afforded, and to administer to their comfort in every way possible.  No guard was placed over them and no restriction was put upon their movements; nor was there any pledge asked that they would not abuse the privileges extended to them.  They were permitted to leave the boat when they felt like it, and did so, coming up on the bank and visiting me at my headquarters.  I had never met either of these gentlemen before the war, but knew them well by reputation and through their public services, and I had been a particular admirer of Mr. Stephens.  I had always supposed that he was a very small man, but when I saw him in the dusk of the evening I was very much surprised to find so large a man as he seemed to be.  When he got down on to the boat I found that he was wearing a coarse gray woollen overcoat, a manufacture that had been introduced into the South during the rebellion.  The cloth was thicker than anything of the kind I had ever seen, even in Canada.  The overcoat extended nearly to his feet, and was so large that it gave him the appearance of being an average-sized man.  He took this off when he reached the cabin of the boat, and I was struck with the apparent change in size, in the coat and out of it.  After a few days, about the 2d of February, I received a dispatch from Washington, directing me to send the commissioners to Hampton Roads to meet the President and a member of the cabinet.  Mr. Lincoln met them there and had an interview of short duration.  It was not a great while after they met that the President visited me at City Point.  He spoke of his having met the commissioners, and said he had told them that there would be no use in entering into any negotiations unless they would recognize, first:  that the Union as a whole must be forever preserved, and second:  that slavery must be abolished. If they were willing to concede these two points, then he was ready to enter into negotiations and was almost willing to hand them a blank"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5865"],["title","Personal Memoirs of  U. S. Grant, Part 6. (#3)"],["body"," of paper with his signature attached for them to fill in the terms upon which they were willing to live with us in the Union and be one people.  He always showed a generous and kindly spirit toward the Southern people, and I never heard him abuse an enemy.  Some of the cruel things said about President Lincoln, particularly in the North, used to pierce him to the heart; but never in my presence did he evince a revengeful disposition and I saw a great deal of him at City Point, for he seemed glad to get away from the cares and anxieties of the capital.  Right here I might relate an anecdote of Mr. Lincoln.  It was on the occasion of his visit to me just after he had talked with the peace commissioners at Hampton Roads.  After a little conversation, he asked me if I had seen that overcoat of Stephens's.  I replied that I had. \"Well,\" said he, \"did you see him take it off?\"  I said yes.  \"Well,\" said he, \"didn't you think it was the biggest shuck and the littlest ear that ever you did see?\"  Long afterwards I told this story to the Confederate General J. B. Gordon, at the time a member of the Senate. He repeated it to Stephens, and, as I heard afterwards, Stephens laughed immoderately at the simile of Mr. Lincoln.  The rest of the winter, after the departure of the peace commissioners, passed off quietly and uneventfully, except for two or three little incidents.  On one occasion during this period, while I was visiting Washington City for the purpose of conferring with the administration, the enemy's cavalry under General Wade Hampton, passing our extreme left and then going to the south, got in east of us.  Before their presence was known, they had driven off a large number of beef cattle that were grazing in that section.  It was a fair capture, and they were sufficiently needed by the Confederates.  It was only retaliating for what we had done, sometimes for many weeks at a time, when out of supplies taking what the Confederate army otherwise would have gotten. As appears in this book, on one single occasion we captured five thousand head of cattle which were crossing the Mississippi River near Port Hudson on their way from Texas to supply the Confederate army in the East.  One of the most anxious periods of my experience during the rebellion was the last few weeks before Petersburg.  I felt that the situation of the Confederate army was such that they would try to make an escape at the earliest practicable moment, and I was afraid, every morning, that I would awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone, and that nothing was left but a picket line.  He had his railroad by the way of Danville south, and I was afraid that he was running off his men and all stores and ordnance except such as it would be necessary to carry with him for his immediate defence.  I knew he could move much more lightly and more rapidly than I, and that, if he got the start, he would leave me behind so that we would have the same army to fight again farther south and the war might be prolonged another year.  I was led to this fear by the fact that I could not see how it was possible for the Confederates to hold out much longer where they were. There is no doubt that Richmond would have been evacuated much sooner than it was, if it had not been that it was the capital of the so-called Confederacy, and the fact of evacuating the capital would, of course, have had a very demoralizing effect upon the Confederate army.  When it was evacuated (as we shall see further on), the Confederacy at once began to crumble and fade away.  Then, too, desertions were taking place, not only among those who were with General Lee in the neighborhood of their capital, but throughout the whole Confederacy.  I remember that in a conversation with me on one occasion long prior to this, General Butler remarked that the Confederates would find great difficulty in getting more men for their army; possibly adding, though I am not certain as to this, \"unless they should arm the slave.\"  The South, as we all knew, were conscripting every able-bodied man between the ages of eighteen and forty-five; and now they had passed a law for the further conscription of boys from fourteen to eighteen, calling them the junior reserves, and men from forty-five to sixty to be called the senior reserves.  The latter were to hold the necessary points not in immediate danger, and especially those in the rear. General Butler, in alluding to this conscription, remarked that they were thus \"robbing both the cradle and the grave,\" an expression which I afterwards used in writing a letter to Mr. Washburn.  It was my belief that while the enemy could get no more recruits they were losing at least a regiment a day, taking it throughout the entire army, by desertions alone.  Then by casualties of war, sickness, and other natural causes, their losses were much heavier.  It was a mere question of arithmetic to calculate how long they could hold out while that rate of depletion was going on.  Of course long before their army would be thus reduced to nothing the army which we had in the field would have been able to capture theirs.  Then too I knew from the great number of desertions, that the men who had fought so bravely, so gallantly and so long for the cause which they believed in--and as earnestly, I take it, as our men believed in the cause for which they were fighting--had lost hope and become despondent.  Many of them were making application to be sent North where they might get employment until the war was over, when they could return to their Southern homes.  For these and other reasons I was naturally very impatient for the time to come when I could commence the spring campaign, which I thoroughly believed would close the war.  There were two considerations I had to observe, however, and which detained me.  One was the fact that the winter had been one of heavy rains, and the roads were impassable for artillery and teams.  It was necessary to wait until they had dried sufficiently to enable us to move the wagon trains and artillery necessary to the efficiency of an army operating in the enemy's country.  The other consideration was that General Sheridan with the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac was operating on the north side of the James River, having come down from the Shenandoah. It was necessary that I should have his cavalry with me, and I was therefore obliged to wait until he could join me south of the James River.  Let us now take account of what he was doing.  On the 5th of March I had heard from Sheridan.  He had met Early between Staunton and Charlottesville and defeated him, capturing nearly his entire command.  Early and some of his officers escaped by finding refuge in the neighboring houses or in the woods.  On the 12th I heard from him again.  He had turned east, to come to White House.  He could not go to Lynchburg as ordered, because the rains had been so very heavy and the streams were so very much swollen.  He had a pontoon train with him, but it would not reach half way across some of the streams, at their then stage of water, which he would have to get over in going south as first ordered.  I had supplies sent around to White House for him, and kept the depot there open until he arrived.  We had intended to abandon it because the James River had now become our base of supplies.  Sheridan had about ten thousand cavalry with him, divided into two divisions commanded respectively by Custer and Devin. General Merritt was acting as chief of cavalry.  Sheridan moved very light, carrying only four days' provisions with him, with a larger supply of coffee, salt and other small rations, and a very little else besides ammunition. They stopped at Charlottesville and commenced tearing up the railroad back toward Lynchburg.  He also sent a division along the James River Canal to destroy locks, culverts etc.  All mills and factories along the lines of march of his troops were destroyed also.  Sheridan had in this way consumed so much time that his making a march to White House was now somewhat hazardous.  He determined therefore to fight his way along the railroad and canal till he was as near to Richmond as it was possible to get, or until attacked.  He did this, destroying the canal as far as Goochland, and the railroad to a point as near Richmond as he could get.  On the 10th he was at Columbia.  Negroes had joined his column to the number of two thousand or more, and they assisted considerably in the work of destroying the railroads and the canal.  His cavalry was in as fine a condition as when he started, because he had been able to find plenty of forage. He had captured most of Early's horses and picked up a good many others on the road.  When he reached Ashland he was assailed by the enemy in force.  He resisted their assault with part of his command, moved quickly across the South and North Anna, going north, and reached White House safely on the 19th.  The time for Sherman to move had to be fixed with reference to the time he could get away from Goldsboro where he then was. Supplies had to be got up to him which would last him through a long march, as there would probably not be much to be obtained in the country through which he would pass.  I had to arrange, therefore, that he should start from where he was, in the neighborhood of Goldsboro on the 18th of April, the earliest day at which he supposed he could be ready.  Sherman was anxious that I should wait where I was until he could come up, and make a sure thing of it; but I had determined to move as soon as the roads and weather would admit of my doing so.  I had been tied down somewhat in the matter of fixing any time at my pleasure for starting, until Sheridan, who was on his way from the Shenandoah Valley to join me, should arrive, as both his presence and that of his cavalry were necessary to the execution of the plans which I had in mind.  However, having arrived at White House on the 19th of March, I"]]]
