The rebuilding of this road would give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply the army.  From Bridgeport, a short distance farther east, the river supplements the road.  General Dodge, besides being a most capable soldier, was an experienced railroad builder.  He had no tools to work with except those of the pioneers--axes, picks, and spades.  With these he was able to intrench his men and protect them against surprises by small parties of the enemy.  As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completed back to Nashville, the first matter to consider after protecting his men was the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country.  He had his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find, or all they needed, and all the cattle for beef, and such other food as could be found.  Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills along the line of the army.  When these were not near enough to the troops for protection they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road. Blacksmith shops, with all the iron and steel found in them, were moved up in like manner.  Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making the tools necessary in railroad and bridge building.  Axemen were put to work getting out timber for bridges and cutting fuel for locomotives when the road should be completed.  Car-builders were set to work repairing the locomotives and cars.  Thus every branch of railroad building, making tools to work with, and supplying the workmen with food, was all going on at once, and without the aid of a mechanic or laborer except what the command itself furnished.  But rails and cars the men could not make without material, and there was not enough rolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its full capacity.  There were no rails except those in use.  To supply these deficiencies I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had at Vicksburg to be sent to Nashville, and all the cars he had except ten. I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river and on the Memphis and Charleston road, and ordered the cars, locomotives and rails from all the railroads except the Memphis and Charleston to Nashville.  The military manager of railroads also was directed to furnish more rolling stock and, as far as he could, bridge material. General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days after receiving his orders.  The number of bridges to rebuild was one hundred and eighty-two, many of them over deep and wide chasms; the length of road repaired was one hundred and two miles.  The enemy's troops, which it was thought were either moving against Burnside or were going to Nashville, went no farther than Cleveland. Their presence there, however, alarmed the authorities at Washington, and, on account of our helpless condition at Chattanooga, caused me much uneasiness.  Dispatches were constantly coming, urging me to do something for Burnside's relief; calling attention to the importance of holding East Tennessee; saying the President was much concerned for the protection of the loyal people in that section, etc.  We had not at Chattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery, much less a supply train.  Reinforcements could not help Burnside, because he had neither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them; hardly, indeed, bread and meat for the men he had.  There was no relief possible for him except by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and about Chattanooga.  On the 4th of November Longstreet left our front with about fifteen thousand troops, besides Wheeler's cavalry, five thousand more, to go against Burnside.  The situation seemed desperate, and was more aggravating because nothing could be done until Sherman should get up. The authorities at Washington were now more than ever anxious for the safety of Burnside's army, and plied me with dispatches faster than ever, urging that something should be done for his relief.  On the 7th, before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville, I ordered Thomas peremptorily to attack the enemy's right, so as to force the return of the troops that had gone up the valley.  I directed him to take mules, officers' horses, or animals wherever he could get them to move the necessary artillery.  But he persisted in the declaration that he could not move a single piece of artillery, and could not see how he could possibly comply with the order.  Nothing was left to be done but to answer Washington dispatches as best I could; urge Sherman forward, although he was making every effort to get forward, and encourage Burnside to hold on, assuring him that in a short time he should be relieved.  All of Burnside's dispatches showed the greatest confidence in his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out. He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he held south and west of Knoxville, so as to draw the enemy farther from his base and make it more difficult for him to get back to Chattanooga when the battle should begin.  Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon; but from there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains. Burnside's suggestion, therefore, was a good one, and it was adopted.  On the 14th I telegraphed him:  \"Sherman's advance has reached Bridgeport.  His whole force will be ready to move from there by Tuesday at farthest.  If you can hold Longstreet in check until he gets up, or by skirmishing and falling back can avoid serious loss to yourself and gain time, I will be able to force the enemy back from here and place a force between Longstreet and Bragg that must inevitably make the former take to the mountain-passes by every available road, to get to his supplies.  Sherman would have been here before this but for high water in Elk River driving him some thirty miles up that river to cross.\"  And again later in the day, indicating my plans for his relief, as follows:  \"Your dispatch and Dana's just received.  Being there, you can tell better how to resist Longstreet's attack than I can direct.  With your showing you had better give up Kingston at the last moment and save the most productive part of your possessions.  Every arrangement is now made to throw Sherman's force across the river, just at and below the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, as soon as it arrives.  Thomas will attack on his left at the same time, and together it is expected to carry Missionary Ridge, and from there push a force on to the railroad between Cleveland and Dalton.  Hooker will at the same time attack, and, if he can, carry Lookout Mountain.  The enemy now seems to be looking for an attack on his left flank.  This favors us.  To further confirm this, Sherman's advance division will march direct from Whiteside to Trenton.  The remainder of his force will pass over a new road just made from Whiteside to Kelly's Ferry, thus being concealed from the enemy, and leave him to suppose the whole force is going up Lookout Valley. Sherman's advance has only just reached Bridgeport.  The rear will only reach there on the 16th.  This will bring it to the 19th as the earliest day for making the combined movement as desired.  Inform me if you think you can sustain yourself until this time.  I can hardly conceive of the enemy breaking through at Kingston and pushing for Kentucky.  If they should, however, a new problem would be left for solution.  Thomas has ordered a division of cavalry to the vicinity of Sparta. I will ascertain if they have started, and inform you.  It will be entirely out of the question to send you ten thousand men, not because they cannot be spared, but how would they be fed after they got even one day east from here?\"  Longstreet, for some reason or other, stopped at Loudon until the 13th. That being the terminus of his railroad communications, it is probable he was directed to remain there awaiting orders.  He was in a position threatening Knoxville, and at the same time where he could be brought back speedily to Chattanooga. The day after Longstreet left Loudon, Sherman reached Bridgeport in person and proceeded on to see me that evening, the 14th, and reached Chattanooga the next day.  My orders for battle were all prepared in advance of Sherman's arrival (*15), except the dates, which could not be fixed while troops to be engaged were so far away.  The possession of Lookout Mountain was of no special advantage to us now.  Hooker was instructed to send Howard's corps to the north side of the Tennessee, thence up behind the hills on the north side, and to go into camp opposite Chattanooga; with the remainder of the command, Hooker was, at a time to be afterwards appointed, to ascend the western slope between the upper and lower palisades, and so get into Chattanooga valley.  The plan of battle was for Sherman to attack the enemy's right flank, form a line across it, extend our left over South Chickamauga River so as to threaten or hold the railroad in Bragg's rear, and thus force him either to weaken his lines elsewhere or lose his connection with his base at Chickamauga Station.  Hooker was to perform like service on our right.  His problem was to get from Lookout Valley to Chattanooga Valley in the most expeditious way possible; cross the latter valley rapidly to Rossville, south of Bragg's line on Missionary Ridge, form line there across the ridge facing north, with his right flank extended to Chickamauga Valley east of the ridge, thus threatening the enemy's rear on that flank and compelling him to reinforce this also.  Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, occupied the centre, and was to assault while the enemy was engaged with most of his forces on his two flanks.  To carry out this plan, Sherman was to cross the Tennessee at Brown's Ferry and move east of Chattanooga to a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5863"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 4. (#5)"],["body","opposite the north end of Mission Ridge, and to place his command back of the foot-hills out of sight of the enemy on the ridge.  There are two streams called Chickamauga emptying into the Tennessee River east of Chattanooga--North Chickamauga, taking its rise in Tennessee, flowing south, and emptying into the river some seven or eight miles east; while the South Chickamauga, which takes its rise in Georgia, flows northward, and empties into the Tennessee some three or four miles above the town. There were now one hundred and sixteen pontoons in the North Chickamauga River, their presence there being unknown to the enemy.  At night a division was to be marched up to that point, and at two o'clock in the morning moved down with the current, thirty men in each boat.  A few were to land east of the mouth of the South Chickamauga, capture the pickets there, and then lay a bridge connecting the two banks of the river.  The rest were to land on the south side of the Tennessee, where Missionary Ridge would strike it if prolonged, and a sufficient number of men to man the boats were to push to the north side to ferry over the main body of Sherman's command while those left on the south side intrenched themselves.  Thomas was to move out from his lines facing the ridge, leaving enough of Palmer's corps to guard against an attack down the valley.  Lookout Valley being of no present value to us, and being untenable by the enemy if we should secure Missionary Ridge, Hooker's orders were changed.  His revised orders brought him to Chattanooga by the established route north of the Tennessee.  He was then to move out to the right to Rossville.  Hooker's position in Lookout Valley was absolutely essential to us so long as Chattanooga was besieged.  It was the key to our line for supplying the army.  But it was not essential after the enemy was dispersed from our front, or even after the battle for this purpose was begun.  Hooker's orders, therefore, were designed to get his force past Lookout Mountain and Chattanooga Valley, and up to Missionary Ridge.  By crossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come into Chattanooga Valley in rear of the line held by the enemy across the valley, and would necessarily force its evacuation.  Orders were accordingly given to march by this route.  But days before the battle began the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action were all considered.  The passage over the mountain was a difficult one to make in the face of an enemy.  It might consume so much time as to lose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where they were more wanted.  After reaching Chattanooga Valley, the creek of the same name, quite a formidable stream to get an army over, had to be crossed.  I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout Mountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge.  By marching Hooker to the north side of the river, thence up the stream, and recrossing at the town, he could be got in position at any named time; when in this new position, he would have Chattanooga Creek behind him, and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably cause the evacuation by the enemy of his line across the valley and on Lookout Mountain.  Hooker's order was changed accordingly.  As explained elsewhere, the original order had to be reverted to, because of a flood in the river rendering the bridge at Brown's Ferry unsafe for the passage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring all the troops together against Missionary Ridge.  The next day after Sherman's arrival I took him, with Generals Thomas and Smith and other officers, to the north side of the river, and showed them the ground over which Sherman had to march, and pointed out generally what he was expected to do.  I, as well as the authorities in Washington, was still in a great state of anxiety for Burnside's safety. Burnside himself, I believe, was the only one who did not share in this anxiety. Nothing could be done for him, however, until Sherman's troops were up.  As soon, therefore, as the inspection was over, Sherman started for Bridgeport to hasten matters, rowing a boat himself, I believe, from Kelly's Ferry.  Sherman had left Bridgeport the night of the 14th, reached Chattanooga the evening of the 15th, made the above-described inspection on the morning of the 16th, and started back the same evening to hurry up his command, fully appreciating the importance of time.  His march was conducted with as much expedition as the roads and season would admit of.  By the 20th he was himself at Brown's Ferry with the head of column, but many of his troops were far behind, and one division (Ewing's) was at Trenton, sent that way to create the impression that Lookout was to be taken from the south.  Sherman received his orders at the ferry, and was asked if he could not be ready for the assault the following morning.  News had been received that the battle had been commenced at Knoxville.  Burnside had been cut off from telegraphic communications.  The President, the Secretary of War, and General Halleck, were in an agony of suspense.  My suspense was also great, but more endurable, because I was where I could soon do something to relieve the situation.  It was impossible to get Sherman's troops up for the next day.  I then asked him if they could not be got up to make the assault on the morning of the 22d, and ordered Thomas to move on that date.  But the elements were against us.  It rained all the 20th and 21st. The river rose so rapidly that it was difficult to keep the pontoons in place.  General Orlando B. Willcox, a division commander under Burnside, was at this time occupying a position farther up the valley than Knoxville --about Maynardville--and was still in telegraphic communication with the North.  A dispatch was received from him saying that he was threatened from the east.  The following was sent in reply:  \"If you can communicate with General Burnside, say to him that our attack on Bragg will commence in the morning.  If successful, such a move will be made as I think will relieve East Tennessee, if he can hold out.  Longstreet passing through our lines to Kentucky need not cause alarm.  He would find the country so bare that he would lose his transportation and artillery before reaching Kentucky, and would meet such a force before he got through, that he could not return.\"  Meantime, Sherman continued his crossing without intermission as fast as his troops could be got up.  The crossing had to be effected in full view of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain.  Once over, however, the troops soon disappeared behind the detached hill on the north side, and would not come to view again, either to watchmen on Lookout Mountain or Missionary Ridge, until they emerged between the hills to strike the bank of the river.  But when Sherman's advance reached a point opposite the town of Chattanooga, Howard, who, it will be remembered, had been concealed behind the hills on the north side, took up his line of march to join the troops on the south side.  His crossing was in full view both from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout, and the enemy of course supposed these troops to be Sherman's.  This enabled Sherman to get to his assigned position without discovery.    CHAPTER XLIII.  PREPARATIONS FOR BATTLE--THOMAS CARRIES THE FIRST LINE OF THE ENEMY --SHERMAN CARRIES MISSIONARY RIDGE--BATTLE OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN --GENERAL HOOKER'S FIGHT.  On the 20th, when so much was occurring to discourage--rains falling so heavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown's Ferry and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge; news coming of a battle raging at Knoxville; of Willcox being threatened by a force from the east--a letter was received from Bragg which contained these words:  \"As there may still be some non-combatants in Chattanooga, I deem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their early withdrawal.\" Of course, I understood that this was a device intended to deceive; but I did not know what the intended deception was.  On the 22d, however, a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leaving our front, and on that day Buckner's division was sent to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville, and another division started to follow but was recalled.  The object of Bragg's letter, no doubt, was in some way to detain me until Knoxville could be captured, and his troops there be returned to Chattanooga.  During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon boats, completed, one hundred and sixteen in all, were carried up to and placed in North Chickamauga. The material for the roadway over these was deposited out of view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of the Tennessee, where the north end of the bridge was to rest.  Hearing nothing from Burnside, and hearing much of the distress in Washington on his account, I could no longer defer operations for his relief.  I determined, therefore, to do on the 23d, with the Army of the Cumberland, what had been intended to be done on the 24th.  The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made very strong for defence during the months it had been besieged.  The line was about a mile from the town, and extended from Citico Creek, a small stream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into the Tennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga, on the left, to Chattanooga Creek on the right.  All commanding points on the line were well fortified and well equipped with artillery.  The important elevations within the line had all been carefully fortified and supplied with a proper armament.  Among the elevations so fortified was one to the east of the town, named Fort Wood.  It owed its importance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town and Missionary Ridge, where most of the strength of the enemy was.  Fort Wood had in it"]]]
