We cannot be forever examining our foundations; we look particularly to those places where it is reported to us that they are insecure. I may be laying myself open to the charge that I am doing the very thing I criticise in the older physics----using terms that \\PageSep{7} have no definite observational meaning, and mingling with my physical quantities things which are not the results of any conceivable experimental operation. I would reply---  By all means explore this criticism if you regard it as a promising field of inquiry. I here assume that you will probably find me a justification for my $10^{-15}$~cm.; but you may find that there is an insurmountable ambiguity in defining it. In the latter event you may be on the track of something which will give a new insight into the fundamental nature of the world. Indeed it has been suspected that the perplexities of quantum phenomena may arise from the tacit assumption that the notions of length and duration, acquired primarily from experiences in which the average effects of large numbers of quanta are involved, are applicable in the study of individual quanta. There may need to be much more excavation before we have brought to light all that is of value in this critical consideration of experimental knowledge. Meanwhile I want to set before you the treasure which has already been unearthed in this field. \\PageSep{8}   \\Chapter{I}{Elementary Principles}  \\Section{1.}{Indeterminateness of the space-time frame}  It has been explained in the early chapters of \\Title{Space, Time and Gravitation} that observers with different motions use different reckonings of space and time, and that no one of these reckonings is more fundamental than another. Our problem is to construct a method of description of the world in which this indeterminateness of the space-time frame of reference is formally recognised.  Prior to Einstein's researches no doubt was entertained that there existed a ``true even-flowing time'' which was unique and universal. The moving observer, who adopts a time-reckoning different from the unique true time, must have been deluded into accepting a fictitious time with a fictitious space-reckoning modified to correspond. The compensating behaviour of electromagnetic forces and of matter is so perfect that, so far as present knowledge extends, there is no test which will distinguish the true time from the fictitious. But since there are many fictitious times and, according to this view, only one true time, some kind of distinction is implied although its nature is not indicated.  Those who still insist on the existence of a unique ``true time'' generally rely on the possibility that the resources of experiment are not yet exhausted and that some day a discriminating test may be found. But the off-chance that a future generation may discover a significance in our utterances is scarcely an excuse for making meaningless noises.  Thus in the phrase \\emph{true time}, ``true'' is an epithet whose meaning has yet to be discovered. It is a blank label. We do not know what is to be written on the label, nor to which of the apparently indistinguishable time-reckonings it ought to be attached. There is no way of progress here. We return to firmer ground, and note that in the mass of experimental knowledge which has accumulated, the words \\emph{time} and \\emph{space} refer to one of the ``fictitious'' times and spaces---primarily that adopted by an observer travelling with the earth, or with the sun---and our theory will deal directly with these space-time frames of reference, which are admittedly fictitious or, in the more usual phrase, \\emph{relative to an observer with particular motion}.  The observers are studying the same external events, notwithstanding their different space-time frames. The space-time frame is therefore something overlaid by the observer on the external world; the partitions representing his space and time reckonings are imaginary surfaces drawn in the world like the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on the earth. They do \\PageSep{9} not follow the natural lines of structure of the world, any more than the meridians follow the lines of geological structure of the earth. Such a mesh-system \\index{Mesh-system}% is of great utility and convenience in describing phenomena, and we shall continue to employ it; but we must endeavour not to lose sight of its fictitious and arbitrary nature.  It is evident from experience that a four-fold mesh-system must be used; and accordingly an event is located by four coordinates, generally taken as \\index{Coordinates}% $x$,~$y$, $z$,~$t$. To understand the significance of this location, we first consider the simple case of two dimensions. If we describe the points of a plane figure by their rectangular coordinates $x$,~$y$, the description of the figure is complete and would enable anyone to construct it; but it is also more than complete, because it specifies an arbitrary element, the orientation, which is irrelevant to the intrinsic properties of the figure and ought to be cast aside from a description of those properties. Alternatively we can describe the figure by stating the distances between the various pairs of points in it; this description is also complete, and it has the merit that it does not prescribe the orientation or contain anything else irrelevant to the intrinsic properties of the figure. The drawback is that it is usually too cumbersome to use in practice for any but the simplest figures.  Similarly our four coordinates $x$,~$y$, $z$,~$t$ may be expected to contain an arbitrary element, analogous to an orientation, which has nothing to do with the properties of the configuration of events. A different set of values of $x$,~$y$, $z$,~$t$ may be chosen in which this arbitrary element of the description is altered, but the configuration of events remains unchanged. It is this arbitrariness in coordinate specification which appears as the indeterminateness of the space-time frame. The other method of description, by giving the distances between every pair of events (or rather certain relations between pairs of events which are analogous to distance), contains all that is relevant to the configuration of events and nothing that is irrelevant. By adopting this latter method we can strip away the arbitrary part of the description, leaving only that which has an exact counterpart in the configuration of the external world.  To put the contrast in another form, in our common outlook the idea of \\index{Extension and location}% \\index{Location and extension}% position or \\emph{location} seems to be fundamental. From it we derive distance or \\emph{extension} as a subsidiary notion, which covers part but not all of the conceptions which we associate with location. Position is looked upon as the physical fact---a coincidence with what is vaguely conceived of as an identifiable point of space---whereas distance is looked upon as an abstraction or a computational result calculable when the positions are known. The view which we are going to adopt reverses this. Extension (distance, interval) is now fundamental; and the location of an object is a computational result summarising the physical fact that it is at certain intervals from the other objects in the world. Any idea contained in the concept location which is not \\PageSep{10} expressible by reference to distances from other objects, must be dismissed from our minds. Our ultimate analysis of space leads us not to a ``here'' and a ``there,'' but to an extension such as that which relates ``here'' and ``there.'' To put the conclusion rather crudely---space is not a lot of points close together; it is a lot of distances interlocked.  Accordingly our fundamental hypothesis is that---  \\emph{Everything connected with location which enters into observational knowledge---everything we can know about the configuration of events---is contained \\index{Configuration of events}% in a relation of extension between pairs of events.}  This relation is called the \\emph{interval}, and its measure is denoted by~$ds$.% \\index{Interval}%  If we have a system~$S$ consisting of events $A$,~$B$, $C$, $D$,~\\dots, and a system~$S'$ consisting of events $A'$,~$B'$, $C'$, $D'$,~\\dots, then the fundamental hypothesis implies that the two systems will be exactly alike observationally if, and only if, all pairs of corresponding intervals in the two systems are equal, $AB = A'B'$, $AC = A'C'$,~\\dots. In that case if $S$~and $S'$ are material systems they will appear to us as precisely similar bodies or mechanisms; or if $S$~and $S'$ correspond to the same material body at different times, it will appear that the body has not undergone any change detectable by observation. But the position, motion, or orientation of the body may be different; that is a change detectable by observation, not of the system~$S$, but of a wider system comprising $S$ and surrounding bodies.  Again let the systems $S$ and $S'$ be abstract coordinate-frames of reference, the events being the corners of the meshes; if all corresponding intervals in the two systems are equal, we shall recognise that the coordinate-frames are of precisely the same kind---rectangular, polar, unaccelerated, rotating, etc.  \\Section{2.}{The fundamental quadratic form}  We have to keep side by side the two methods of describing the configurations of events by coordinates and by the mutual intervals, respectively---the first for its conciseness, and the second for its immediate absolute significance. It is therefore necessary to connect the two modes of description by a formula which will enable us to pass readily from one to the other. The particular formula will depend on the coordinates chosen as well as on the absolute properties of the region of the world considered; but it appears that in all cases the formula is included in the following general form---  The interval $ds$ between two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/59248"],["title","The Mathematical Theory of Relativity (#6)"],["body","events with coordinates \\index{Quadratic formula for interval}% $(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4})$ and $(x_{1} + dx_{1}, x_{2} + dx_{2}, x_{3} + dx_{3}, x_{4} + dx_{4})$ in any coordinate-system is given by %[** TN: Reformatted from the original] \\begin{multline*}   ds^{2} = g_{11}\\, dx_{1}^{2} + g_{22}\\, dx_{2}^{2} + g_{33}\\, dx_{3}^{2} + g_{44}\\, dx_{4}^{2} \\\\   \\begin{aligned}[b]     &+ 2g_{12}\\, dx_{1}\\, dx_{2} + 2g_{13}\\, dx_{1}\\, dx_{3} + 2g_{14}\\, dx_{1}\\, dx_{4} \\\\     &+ 2g_{23}\\, dx_{2}\\, dx_{3} + 2g_{24}\\, dx_{2}\\, dx_{4} + 2g_{34}\\, dx_{3}\\, dx_{4},   \\end{aligned} \\Tag{(2.1)} \\end{multline*} where the coefficients $g_{11}$, etc. are functions of $x_{1}$,~$x_{2}$, $x_{3}$,~$x_{4}$. That is to say, $ds^{2}$~is some quadratic function of the differences of coordinates.% \\PageSep{11}  This is, of course, not the most general case conceivable; for example, we might have a world in which the interval depended on a general quartic function of the~$dx$'s. But, as we shall presently see, the quadratic form~\\Eq{(2.1)} is definitely indicated by observation as applying to the actual world. Moreover near the end of our task (\\SecRef{97}) we shall find in the general theory of relation-structure a precise reason why a quadratic function of the coordinate-differences should have this paramount importance.  Whilst the form of the right-hand side of~\\Eq{(2.1)} is that required by observation, the insertion of~$ds^{2}$ on the left, rather than some other function of~$ds$, is merely a convention. The quantity~$ds$ is a measure of the interval. \\index{Length!measurement of}% \\index{Measure of interval}% It is necessary to consider carefully how measure-numbers are to be affixed to the different intervals occurring in nature. We have seen in the last section that equality of intervals can be tested observationally; but so far as we have yet gone, intervals are merely either equal or unequal, and their differences have not been further particularised. Just as wind-strength may be measured by velocity, or by pressure, or by a number on the Beaufort scale, so the relation of extension between two events could be expressed numerically according to many different plans. To conform to~\\Eq{(2.1)} a particular code of measure-numbers must be adopted; the nature and advantages of this code will be explained in the next section.  The pure geometry associated with the general formula~\\Eq{(2.1)} was studied by Riemann, and is generally called Riemannian geometry. It includes \\index{Geometry, Riemannian}% \\index{Riemannian geometry}% Euclidean geometry as a special case.  \\Section{3.}{Measurement of intervals}  Consider the operation of proving by measurement that a distance~$AB$ is equal to a distance~$CD$. We take a configuration of events $LMNOP$\\dots, viz.\\ a measuring-scale, and lay it over~$AB$, and observe that $A$~and $B$ coincide with two particular events $P$,~$Q$ (scale-divisions) of the configuration. We find that the same configuration\\footnote   {The logical point may be noticed that the measuring-scale in two positions (necessarily at   different times) represents the same \\emph{configuration} of events, not the same events.} can also be arranged so that $C$~and $D$ coincide with $P$~and $Q$~respectively. Further we apply all possible tests to the measuring-scale to see if it has ``changed'' between the two measurements; and we are only satisfied that the measures are correct if no observable difference can be detected. According to our fundamental axiom, the absence of any observable difference between the two configurations (the structure of the measuring-scale in its two positions) signifies that the intervals are unchanged; in particular the interval between $P$ and~$Q$ is unchanged. It follows that the interval $A$ to~$B$ is equal to the interval $C$ to~$D$. We consider that the experiment proves equality of distance; but it is primarily a test of equality of interval. \\PageSep{12}  In this experiment time is not involved; and we conclude that in space considered apart from time the test of equality of distance is equality of interval. There is thus a one-to-one correspondence of distances and intervals. We may therefore adopt the same measure-number for the interval as is in general use for the distance, thus settling our plan of affixing measure-numbers to intervals. It follows that, when time is not involved, the interval reduces to the distance.  It is for this reason that the quadratic form~\\Eq{(2.1)} is needed in order to agree with observation, for it is well known that in three dimensions the square of the distance between two neighbouring points is a quadratic function of their infinitesimal coordinate-differences---a result depending ultimately on the experimental law expressed by Euclid \\Vol{I},~47.  When time is involved other appliances are used for measuring intervals. If we have a mechanism capable of cyclic motion, its cycles will measure equal intervals provided the mechanism, its laws of behaviour, and all relevant surrounding circumstances, remain precisely similar. For the phrase ``precisely similar'' means that no observable differences can be detected in the mechanism or its behaviour; and that, as we have seen, requires that all corresponding intervals should be equal. In particular the interval between the events marking the beginning and end of the cycle is unaltered. Thus a clock primarily measures equal intervals; it is only under more restricted conditions that it also measures the time-coordinate~$t$.  In general any repetition of an operation under similar conditions, but for a different time, place, orientation and velocity (attendant circumstances which have a relative but not an absolute significance\\footnotemark),\\footnotetext   {They express relations to events which are not concerned in the test, e.g.\\ to the sun and   stars.} tests, equality of interval.  It is obvious from common experience that intervals which can be measured with a clock cannot be measured with a scale, and \\Foreign{vice versa}. We have thus two varieties of intervals, which are provided for in the formula~\\Eq{(2.1)}, since $ds^{2}$~may be positive or negative and the measure of the interval will accordingly be expressed by a real or an imaginary number. The \\index{Imaginary intervals}% abbreviated phrase ``imaginary interval'' must not be allowed to mislead; there is nothing imaginary in the corresponding relation; it is merely that in our arbitrary code an imaginary number is assigned as its measure-number. We might have adopted a different code, and have taken, for example, the antilogarithm of~$ds^{2}$ as the measure of the interval; in that case space-intervals would have received code-numbers from~$1$ to~$\\infty$, and time-intervals numbers from~$0$ to~$1$. When we encounter~$\\sqrt{-1}$ in our investigations, we must remember that it has been introduced by our choice of measure-code and must not think of it as occurring with some mystical significance in the external world. \\PageSep{13}  \\Section{4.}{Rectangular coordinates and time} \\index{Rectangular coordinates and time}% \\index{Coordinate-systems!rectangular}%  Suppose that we have a small region of the world throughout which the $g$'s can be treated as constants\\footnotemark.\\footnotetext   {It will be shown in \\SecRef{36} that it is always possible to transform the coordinates so that the   first derivatives of the~$g$'s vanish at a selected point. We shall suppose that this preliminary   transformation has already been made, in order that the constancy of the~$g$'s may be a valid   approximation through as large a region as possible round the selected point.} In that case the right-hand side of~\\Eq{(2.1)} can be broken up into the sum of four squares, admitting imaginary coefficients if necessary. Thus writing \\begin{align*}   y_{1} &= a_{1} x_{1} + a_{2} x_{2} + a_{3} x_{3} + a_{4} x_{4}, \\\\   y_{2} &= b_{1} x_{1} + b_{2} x_{2} + b_{3} x_{3} + b_{4} x_{4},\\quad\\text{etc.,} \\\\ \\intertext{so that}   dy_{1} &= a_{1}\\, dx_{1} + a_{2}\\, dx_{2} + a_{3}\\, dx_{3} + a_{4}\\, dx_{4},\\quad\\text{etc.,} \\end{align*} we can choose the constants $a_{1}$, $b_{1}$,~\\dots\\ so that \\Eq{(2.1)}~becomes \\[ ds^{2} = dy_{1}^{2} + dy_{2}^{2} + dy_{3}^{2} + dy_{4}^{2}. \\Tag{(4.1)} \\] For, substituting for the $dy$'s and comparing coefficients with~\\Eq{(2.1)}, we have only $10$~equations to be satisfied by the $16$~constants. There are thus many ways of making the reduction. Note, however, that the reduction to the sum of four squares of complete differentials is not in general possible for a \\emph{large} region, where the $g$'s have to be treated as functions, not constants.  Consider all the events for which $y_{4}$~has some specified value. These will form a three-dimensional world. Since $dy_{4}$~is zero for every pair of these events, their mutual intervals are given by \\[ ds^{2} = dy_{1}^{2} + dy_{2}^{2} + dy_{3}^{2}. \\Tag{(4.2)} \\] But this is exactly like familiar space in which the interval (which we have shown to be the same as the distance for space without time) is given by \\[ ds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}, \\Tag{(4.3)} \\] where $x$, $y$, $z$ are rectangular coordinates.  Hence a section of the world by $y_{4} = \\text{const.}$ will appear to us as space, and $y_{1}$,~$y_{2}$,~$y_{3}$ will appear to us as rectangular coordinates. The coordinate-frames $y_{1}$,~$y_{2}$,~$y_{3}$, and $x$,~$y$,~$z$, are examples of the systems $S$ and~$S'$ of \\SecRef{1}, for which the intervals between corresponding pairs of mesh-corners are equal. The two systems are therefore exactly alike observationally; and if one appears to us to be a rectangular frame in space, so also must the other. One proviso must be noted; the coordinates $y_{1}$,~$y_{2}$,~$y_{3}$ for real events must be real, as in familiar space, otherwise the resemblance would be only formal.  Granting this proviso, we have reduced the general expression to \\[ ds^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2} + dy_{4}"]]]
