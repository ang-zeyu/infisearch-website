Then he started back in amazement.  \"Why--er--why--ahem--so it is you!\" he stammered. \"I--er--where did you come from?\"  \"We came from our bedroom,\" answered Tom promptly.  \"Where did you come from, Mr. Crabtree?\"   \"Why--er--don't be impertinent, Rover.  I might say that I came from my bedroom too.\"  \"I thought you came from the river,\" remarked Dick carelessly.  \"From the river?  \"Yes.\"  \"You are--ahem, mistaken, my lad.  I have not been near the river--at least, not since I came up from New York on the boat.\"  \"Stopping here for the summer?\" put in Sam.  \"I do not know as that is any of your business, Samuel.  I am no longer a master at Putnam Hall and when I left that place I washed my hands of all those connected with that place.\"  \"A good thing for the Hall, sir,\" came from Tom.  \"Don't be insulting, Rover.  You go your way and I'll go mine.\"  \"As you please, sir.  You spoke to us first.\"  \"I'll take good care and not do it again.  But this looks as if you were following me up.\"  \"That's what Mumps said,\" cried Sam, before he had stopped to think twice.  \"Ha!  So you have met Mum--I mean John Fenwick?\"  \"We met him on the river.\"  \"And he said you had been following him?\"  \"Never mind, Mr. Crabtree, we won't talk any more,\" put in Dick, with a warning glance at Sam.  He turned to the waiter.  \"Some fish, please, trout; and see that the biscuits are warm.\"  \"Yes, sah,\" grinned the negro.  Tom at once took the cue.  \"It's going to be a warm day,\" he said to Dick.  \"I wonder how sailing was last night,\" put in Sam slyly.  At this Josiah Crabtree looked as black as a thundercloud.  \"You boys have been playing the sneak on me!\" he cried.  \"Take my advice and beware of what you do in the future.\"  \"I wasn't talking to you,\" retorted Sam. \"Kindly keep your remarks to yourself.\"  By this time others were coming to the table, consequently the cross-fire of words had to come to an end. Josiah Crabtree finished his repast as speedily as possible and strode out of the dining room in high but suppressed anger.  \"He's a corker,\" remarked Tom.  \"I believe he'd half kill us if he dared.\"  \"I guess he hasn't forgotten how I stopped him from maltreating Dora Stanhope,\" said Dick.  \"I wish I knew if he had been around their place since he came back from the West.\"  \"Of course he has been back,\" said Tom.  \"And he'll marry Mrs. Stanhope yet--see if he don't.\"  \"Not if I can help Dora prevent it,\" said his elder brother firmly.  Breakfast finished they walked out to learn what had become of Crabtree.  They were just in time to see him leaving the hotel, valise in hand.  \"He's off,\" said Tom.  \"I wonder where he is bound?\"  \"Let us follow him and find out,\" returned Dick,  This did not prove to be an easy matter, for at the foot of the hotel grounds Josiah Crabtree jumped into a stage which was in waiting, bound for the depot.  \"He's off on the train, I guess,\" said Sam, and the others were inclined to agree with him.  Down at the river shore nothing could be seen of the _Falcon_, and they concluded that Mumps had also taken himself off.  The morning was spent around the hotel, in reading the newspapers and taking it easy out on the beautiful lawn.  \"Hullo, here's a novelty!\" cried Tom presently, and pointed to an Italian who was coming up to the hotel.  The fellow had a small hand organ and a trained bear and two monkeys.  The monkeys were dressed in red, white, and blue, and sat on the bear's back as he trotted along.  \"He's going to give us a performance,\" said Sam, as the Italian came to a halt in the center of the grounds.  \"There they go!\"  The music started, and at once the bear reared himself on his hind legs and began to dance.  In the meantime the monkeys climbed to the bear's head and began a little dance of their own.  \"Now for a little sport,\" whispered Tom, and started for the hotel.  \"Be careful of yourself!\" warned Dick; \"That bear looks as if he wasn't to be trifled with.\"  But Tom did not heed him, his whole mind being bent on having a laugh at the expense of the Italian and his animals.  Going around to the kitchen of the hotel, he procured a couple of sugar cakes, pierced them with pinholes, and filled them up with pepper.  When he returned he found that a crowd had gathered and the Italian was passing around the hat.  While Sam and Dick contributed several cents, Tom gave the bear one bun and divided the other between the two monkeys.  \"Cheep! cheep!\" went the monkeys, as if highly pleased.  \"You're right, they are cheap,\" grinned Tom.  \"Hope you like the flavor.\"  The monkeys began to eat ravenously, for they were nearly starved.  But they had not swallowed many mouthfuls before they noticed something wrong.  Then one threw his bun at Tom in a rage.  A second later the other monkey leaped back on the bear's head and began to dance and scratch wildly, in the meanwhile scattering the bun crumbs in all directions.  \"Hi! hi! whata you do to de monks?\" demanded the Italian.  \"You letta de monks alone!\"  \"I'm not touching the monks,\" replied Tom, and slipped out of sight in the crowd.  By this time the bear had swallowed the larger portion of the bun given to him.  It was the more peppery of the two, and it brought tears to the beast's eyes.  With a roar of rage he, turned and shook the monkey from his head and leaped away from his keeper, dragging his chain after him.  The monkeys were evidently not used to seeing the bear in an ugly mood, and at once they sought safety by getting out of his reach. One leaped into a tree and ran like a cat to the top, while the second pounced on the shoulder of an elderly damsel, who looked exactly what she was, a hot-tempered old maid.  \"Oh, dear!\" screamed the elderly damsel.  \"Take the horrid thing off!  Take it off this minute!\"  \"Come here, Jocko!\" roared the Italian.  \"Come, Jocko!\" and he held out his hands.  But Jocko had no intention of coming.  Instead he clung the closer, his two forefeet in the lady's hair.  The hair was largely false, and all of a sudden a long switch came loose and fell to the ground.  At this the damsel screeched at the top of her lungs and, caught at the hair. The monkey cried, too, in concert, and then a young man rushed in to the rescue.  But Jocko's blood was up, and, leaping to the young man's shoulder, he tore off his straw hat and began to pull it to bits.  Then, with the hat still in his possession, he made a leap to the tree and joined his brother at the top.  By this time the uproar was general, and it seemed to anger the bear still more.  He had been rushing over the lawn, upsetting easy chairs and benches, but now he charged straight for the crowd.  \"Look out for the bear!\"  \"The beast is going mad and will chew somebody up!\"  \"Shoot him, somebody, before we are all killed!\"  Such were some of the cries which rang out.  The Italian turned pale with anger and alarm.  \"No shootta Marcus!\" he cried.  \"No shootta heem.  He de goodda bear!\"  \"Then catch him!\" put in the proprietor of the hotel.  \"Catch him and tie him up.\"  But this the Italian could not do, and when the bear headed for him he ran as hard as anybody present.  Around and around the grounds fled the people, some rushing for the hotel and the others to the stables and to a large summer house.  The bear made first for one and then another, but at last halted in front of the stable, which now contained the Rover boys, two ladies and an elderly man, and two colored hostlers.  \"Shut the doors!\" cried Dick, but his words were unnecessary, for the colored men were already closing them. The bar had scarcely been dropped into place when the bear hurled himself with all force against the barrier.  \"He is going to break in the door!\" cried one of the ladies.  \"Let us go upstairs,\" said the elderly gentleman, and lost no time in leading the way.  There was a back door to close, and one of the negroes started for this.  But just as he got close to the door he saw the bear coming, and, uttering a wild yell, he too made for the stairs.  Tom was close at hand, and it must be confessed that he felt thoroughly sorry over what he had done.  \"I'm responsible for all of it,\" he groaned.  Then, as the bear stepped close to the back door, he got behind the barrier and tried to shove it shut.  The result was a surprise for both boy and bear, for as the beast made a leap the edge of the door caught him, and in a twinkle the animal was held fast by the neck between the door and its frame.     CHAPTER V  A NEVER-TO-BE-FORGOTTEN SWIM   \"I've got him fast!  Help!  Help!\"  \"Tom's caught the bear!\" shouted Sam.  \"Can you hold him, Tom?\"  \"I guess I can if some of you will help me!\"  panted the youth. \"Hurry up!\"  Sam and Dick were on the stairs, but now both ran to their brother's assistance, and all three pushed upon the door with all of their strength.  The barrier groaned and creaked and it looked as if at any instant it would burst from its hinges.  \"Gracious, we can't hold him very long!\" gasped Sam.  \"Can't somebody hit the animal with a club?\"  \"I reckon I can do dat!\" shouted one of the hostlers, and caught up an ax-handle which stood in one corner.  As he approached the bear, the beast uttered a roar of commingled rage and fear, and this was so terrorizing to the colored man that he dropped the ax-handle and ran for his very life.  \"Come back here!\" cried Tom.  \"Can't do it, boss; he's gwine ter chew me up!\" howled the hostler.  \"Hold the door--I'll hit him,\" put in Sam and he picked up the ax-handle. Stepping forward, struck out heavily, and the bear dropped in a heap, completely dazed and more than half choked to death.  By this time the Italian was again at hand. In one pocket he carried a thin but strong line, in a twinkle he had tied one fore and one hind leg together, so that the bear, when he got up again, could do little but hobble along. Then from another pocket he drew a leather muzzle, which he buckled over the beast's head. But the bear had had all of the ugliness"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5875"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Ocean; Or, A chase for a fortune (#4)"],["body","out him and was once more as docile as ever.  \"Tom,\" whispered Dick.  \"I guess the best we can do is to get out of this place.  If folks discover the trick you played, they'll mob you.\"  \"I guess you're right. But who'll settle our bill?\"  \"I'll do that,\" said Sam.  \"They know I wasn't near the bear when the rumpus started.\"  So it was agreed, and while Tom and Dick left the hotel grounds. Sam strolled into the office to pay their bill. It was some time before the clerk came to wait on him.  \"Say, I believe, your brother started this kick-up,\" observed the clerk.  \"What?\" demanded Sam, in pretended astonishment.  \"I say, I think he started this kick-up.\"  \"What kick-up?\"  \"The one with the bear, of course.\"  \"Why, my brothers helped to catch the beast.\"  \"I know that; but one of 'em started it.  What do you want?\"  \"I want to pay our bill.  How much is it?\"  \"Going to leave?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Think you had better, eh?\"  \"We only hired our room until this noon.\" Sam drew himself up. \"If you want your pay you be civil.\"  \"Yes, but--\"  The clerk broke off short.  \"That will be six dollars, please.\"  \"All right, there you are,\" and Sam shoved the bills over. \"Now don't say we created a muss or I'll report you to the proprietor.\"  \"Yes, but see here--\"  \"I've not got my glasses just now.  Good-by, and--\"  \"That man hasn't got his monkeys yet, and--\"  \"What's that to you?  Are you afraid the proprietor will put one of 'em in here in your place?\"  And before the clerk could say another word Sam ran off and joined his brothers at the river bank.  Soon the three reached the dock where the _Spray_ lay undergoing repairs.  The deaf man was just finishing his work.  \"She'll be about as good as ever,\" he said, in reply to Dick's question.  \"She's a fine boat.\"  \"I guess he says that of every boat that brings him in a job,\" murmured Sam. \"Come on.\"  He went aboard and the others followed.  Dan Haskett was paid off, the mainsail was hoisted, and once more they stood up the river in the direction of the State capital.  It was their intention to spend two days in Albany and then return to New York with the yacht.  This would wind up their vacation, for Putnam Hall was to open on the following Monday.  The day proved an ideal one, but the wind was light and the yacht scarcely moved even with the mainsail and jib set to their fullest.  This being so, the boys got out their fishing lines and spent an hour in trolling, and succeeded in catching several fair-sized fish.  \"We'll have to cook our own dinner,\" remarked Dick.  \"Tom, since you did us out of our meal at the hotel I reckon you are the one to fall in for this work.\"  At this Tom cut a wry face, but still, seeing the justice of his elder brother's remark, he went at the dinner-getting with a will.  The yacht boasted a kerosene stove, and over this he set fish to frying and a pot of potatoes to boiling.  As the river was calm and the yacht steady the little stove worked very well.  They were still out of sight of Albany when the midday meal was pronounced ready.  In addition to the articles already mentioned, they had coffee, bread and butter, and what was left of a cocoanut pie purchased the day previous.  The boys were all hearty eaters, and the food disappeared as if by magic.  After dinner the breeze died out utterly, and Sam proposed that they cast anchor close to shore and take a swim.  The others were willing, and soon they had disrobed and donned their bathing trunks and were sporting in the water to their hearts' content.  The water was somewhat colder than they had anticipated, and the effect upon Sam was disastrous.  The youngest Rover had eaten more heartily than either of his brothers and this made him sick at the stomach.  However, as he did not wish to alarm Dick and Tom and so spoil their fun, he said nothing about his condition.  \"Let us race each other,\" suggested Tom, and started off up the shore, with Dick close beside him.  Sam brought up in the rear, but soon gave up the contest.  \"Help!\"  The single cry reached the ears of Tom and Dick when they were fully a hundred feet from the _Spray_.  Both turned just in time to behold Sam throw up his arms and sink from view.  \"Great Caesar!\" burst out Dick.  \"What can that mean?\"  \"Maybe he is only fooling,\" replied Tom. \"Yet I wouldn't think he would be so foolish.\"  \"I don't think Sam is fooling,\" said Dick seriously, and at once struck out to where the youngest Rover had gone down.  Of course Tom went with him.  To reach the spot was not an easy matter, and they were still some distance away when they saw Sam come up again.  Then there was a wild circling of arms and the boy disappeared once more.  \"He is drowning!\" gasped Dick hoarsely.  \"Come, we must save him, Tom!\"  \"Yes, yes,\" was the puffing answer, for Tom was swimming as never before, and for a brief instant he remembered that awful adventure Sam had had at Humpback Falls, the summer previous.  At that time the youngest Rover had nearly lost his life in the water.  It was Dick who gained the spot first, just as Sam came up and went down again--totally unconscious.  Diving, the elder Rover caught his brother around the chest, under the arms.  \"Sam, Sam, what is it?\" he questioned, and as no reply came back his heart almost stopped beating.  What if his brother was dead? The agony of the thought was terrible beyond description.  \"Can I help you?\"  The question came from Tom, who was now at the side of the others.  \"Catch hold of one arm, if you will,\" answered Dick.  \"He's a dead weight.\"  \"Oh!\"  The moan came so unexpectedly that both Tom and Dick were amazed.  Then of a sudden Sam opened his eyes and clutched Dick by the throat.  \"Save me!\"  Clearly the youngest Rover was out of his mind or he would not have taken such a hold.  As it was, Dick was nearly strangled and had to unlock the fingers by sheer force.  Then Sam grabbed him again, and it looked as if both would go down to a watery grave.  But now Tom came to the rescue.  Swimming up from behind, he caught Sam first under one arm--and then under the other, in a back-to-back fashion.  Then he bent forward and began to tread water, thus holding his brother's head well out of water.  \"Push us ashore, Dick!\" he panted, and understanding the movement perfectly, the elder brother did as desired. Soon all three gained a point from which Tom could wade to the river bank with ease.  It was an anxious pair that bent over Sam, who rested on his back with his eyes closed.  But the youngest Rover was not allowed to remain long in that position.  Tom and Dick knew something of how to handle a person who is nearly drowned, and they now made use of this knowledge with all speed.  Sam was rolled and hoisted up by the ankles, and thus he got rid of a large quantity of the water he had swallowed.  Yet even when he came to his senses he was too weak to walk, and Tom had to bring the _Spray_ close to shore, and the sufferer had to be carried on board, his brothers wading up to their waists for that purpose.  \"The first cramp I got was in the stomach,\" said Sam, when he could talk.  \"Then it went all over me like an electric shock, and I felt I was going to drown.  What happened after that was like some awful dream!\"  And he shuddered.  It was a long while before any of them got over that adventure.     CHAPTER VI  AN UNEXPECTED MEETING   As just related, the boys had brought the _Spray_ as closely inshore as possible.  All were now in the cabin, Dick and Tom attending to Sam's wants; and consequently no one noticed the passage of one of the palatial steamers that make daily trips between New York and the capital of the State.  These steamers, in running so fast, cast out long rollers on both sides that go tumbling shoreward one after another.  The rollers now caught the _Spray_ and sent her dancing up and down like a cork.  \"Hullo, we're in danger!\" shouted Tom, and rushed for the deck, with Dick almost at his heels.  The anchor was dragging, and unless pushed off the yacht would soon be pounding on the rocks.  \"I'll put up the sail!\" roared Dick.  \"You bring up the anchor!\"  \"I guess you had better pole her off,\" replied Tom. Nevertheless, he did as Dick requested, working like a beaver.  The wind was still faint, and when the mainsail was hoisted it failed to fill.  Seeing this, Dick seized a pole and Tom did the same.  They speedily found that they could not send the yacht out any distance.  But, with a pole at the bow and another at the stern, they managed to keep her off the rocks until the rollers began to go down. Then they shoved off with ease and moved slowly up the river.  \"I'll tell you what, in handling a boat you have got to have your weather eye open all the time,\" observed Tom.  \"Yes, and you want to have it open on all sides of you,\" smiled Dick.  \"If you don't, you'll catch it before you are aware.\"  Sam lay on one of the tiny berths with which the _Spray_ was provided.  His face was deathly white, and, to use his own words, he felt \"as weak as a rag.\"  \"I'm just beginning to realize how close to death I was,\" he whispered to Tom.  \"It was awfully good of you and Dick to do what you did.\"  \"Pooh! you would do just as much for us, Sam,\" answered the fun-loving brother.  But, just the same, he gave Sam's hand a tight squeeze on the quiet.  \"What was that thumping, Tom?\" asked the younger brother a bit later.  \"The rollers from a big steamer nearly put us on the rocks.\"  \"Gracious, more perils!  Don't you think we had better give up our outing on the water?\"  \"It will come to an end in a few days, Sam.  We'll make the trip to Albany, and that will be the last of it.\"  It was nightfall by the time they came up to the capital city. Getting the necessary permission to tie up at one of the private wharves, they locked up the cabin of the _Spray_ and went ashore.  \"Tom Rover, as I live!  And Dick and Sam, too!\"  The cry came from up the street, and soon a boy of Dick's age was running to meet them.  It was"]]]
