Pemberton was fortified at the Tallahatchie, but occupied Holly Springs and Grand Junction on the Mississippi Central railroad.  On the 8th we occupied Grand Junction and La Grange, throwing a considerable force seven or eight miles south, along the line of the railroad.  The road from Bolivar forward was repaired and put in running order as the troops advanced.  Up to this time it had been regarded as an axiom in war that large bodies of troops must operate from a base of supplies which they always covered and guarded in all forward movements.  There was delay therefore in repairing the road back, and in gathering and forwarding supplies to the front.  By my orders, and in accordance with previous instructions from Washington, all the forage within reach was collected under the supervision of the chief quartermaster and the provisions under the chief commissary, receipts being given when there was any one to take them; the supplies in any event to be accounted for as government stores.  The stock was bountiful, but still it gave me no idea of the possibility of supplying a moving column in an enemy's country from the country itself.  It was at this point, probably, where the first idea of a \"Freedman's Bureau\" took its origin.  Orders of the government prohibited the expulsion of the negroes from the protection of the army, when they came in voluntarily.  Humanity forbade allowing them to starve.  With such an army of them, of all ages and both sexes, as had congregated about Grand Junction, amounting to many thousands, it was impossible to advance. There was no special authority for feeding them unless they were employed as teamsters, cooks and pioneers with the army; but only able-bodied young men were suitable for such work.  This labor would support but a very limited percentage of them.  The plantations were all deserted; the cotton and corn were ripe: men, women and children above ten years of age could be employed in saving these crops.  To do this work with contrabands, or to have it done, organization under a competent chief was necessary.  On inquiring for such a man Chaplain Eaton, now and for many years the very able United States Commissioner of Education, was suggested.  He proved as efficient in that field as he has since done in his present one.  I gave him all the assistants and guards he called for.  We together fixed the prices to be paid for the negro labor, whether rendered to the government or to individuals.  The cotton was to be picked from abandoned plantations, the laborers to receive the stipulated price (my recollection is twelve and a half cents per pound for picking and ginning) from the quartermaster, he shipping the cotton north to be sold for the benefit of the government. Citizens remaining on their plantations were allowed the privilege of having their crops saved by freedmen on the same terms.  At once the freedmen became self-sustaining.  The money was not paid to them directly, but was expended judiciously and for their benefit.  They gave me no trouble afterwards.  Later the freedmen were engaged in cutting wood along the Mississippi River to supply the large number of steamers on that stream.  A good price was paid for chopping wood used for the supply of government steamers (steamers chartered and which the government had to supply with fuel).  Those supplying their own fuel paid a much higher price.  In this way a fund was created not only sufficient to feed and clothe all, old and young, male and female, but to build them comfortable cabins, hospitals for the sick, and to supply them with many comforts they had never known before.  At this stage of the campaign against Vicksburg I was very much disturbed by newspaper rumors that General McClernand was to have a separate and independent command within mine, to operate against Vicksburg by way of the Mississippi River.  Two commanders on the same field are always one too many, and in this case I did not think the general selected had either the experience or the qualifications to fit him for so important a position.  I feared for the safety of the troops intrusted to him, especially as he was to raise new levies, raw troops, to execute so important a trust.  But on the 12th I received a dispatch from General Halleck saying that I had command of all the troops sent to my department and authorizing me to fight the enemy where I pleased. The next day my cavalry was in Holly Springs, and the enemy fell back south of the Tallahatchie.  Holly Springs I selected for my depot of supplies and munitions of war, all of which at that time came by rail from Columbus, Kentucky, except the few stores collected about La Grange and Grand Junction.  This was a long line (increasing in length as we moved south) to maintain in an enemy's country.  On the 15th of November, while I was still at Holly Springs, I sent word to Sherman to meet me at Columbus.  We were but forty-seven miles apart, yet the most expeditious way for us to meet was for me to take the rail to Columbus and Sherman a steamer for the same place.  At that meeting, besides talking over my general plans I gave him his orders to join me with two divisions and to march them down the Mississippi Central railroad if he could. Sherman, who was always prompt, was up by the 29th to Cottage Hill, ten miles north of Oxford. He brought three divisions with him, leaving a garrison of only four regiments of infantry, a couple of pieces of artillery and a small detachment of cavalry. Further reinforcements he knew were on their way from the north to Memphis.  About this time General Halleck ordered troops from Helena, Arkansas (territory west of the Mississippi was not under my command then) to cut the road in Pemberton's rear.  The expedition was under Generals Hovey and C. C. Washburn and was successful so far as reaching the railroad was concerned, but the damage done was very slight and was soon repaired.  The Tallahatchie, which confronted me, was very high, the railroad bridge destroyed and Pemberton strongly fortified on the south side.  A crossing would have been impossible in the presence of an enemy.  I sent the cavalry higher up the stream and they secured a crossing.  This caused the enemy to evacuate their position, which was possibly accelerated by the expedition of Hovey and Washburn.  The enemy was followed as far south as Oxford by the main body of troops, and some seventeen miles farther by McPherson's command.  Here the pursuit was halted to repair the railroad from the Tallahatchie northward, in order to bring up supplies.  The piles on which the railroad bridge rested had been left standing.  The work of constructing a roadway for the troops was but a short matter, and, later, rails were laid for cars.  During the delay at Oxford in repairing railroads I learned that an expedition down the Mississippi now was inevitable and, desiring to have a competent commander in charge, I ordered Sherman on the 8th of December back to Memphis to take charge. The following were his orders:  Headquarters 13th Army Corps, Department of the Tennessee. OXFORD, MISSISSIPPI, December 8,1862.  MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Commanding Right Wing:  You will proceed, with as little delay as possible, to Memphis, Tennessee, taking with you one division of your present command.  On your arrival at Memphis you will assume command of all the troops there, and that portion of General Curtis's forces at present east of the Mississippi River, and organize them into brigades and divisions in your own army.  As soon as possible move with them down the river to the vicinity of Vicksburg, and with the co-operation of the gunboat fleet under command of Flag-officer Porter proceed to the reduction of that place in such a manner as circumstances, and your own judgment, may dictate.  The amount of rations, forage, land transportation, etc., necessary to take, will be left entirely with yourself.  The Quartermaster at St. Louis will be instructed to send you transportation for 30,000 men; should you still find yourself deficient, your quartermaster will be authorized to make up the deficiency from such transports as may come into the port of Memphis.  On arriving in Memphis, put yourself in communication with Admiral Porter, and arrange with him for his co-operation.  Inform me at the earliest practicable day of the time when you will embark, and such plans as may then be matured.  I will hold the forces here in readiness to co-operate with you in such manner as the movements of the enemy may make necessary.  Leave the District of Memphis in the command of an efficient officer, and with a garrison of four regiments of infantry, the siege guns, and whatever cavalry may be there.  U. S. GRANT, Major-General.   This idea had presented itself to my mind earlier, for on the 3d of December I asked Halleck if it would not be well to hold the enemy south of the Yallabusha and move a force from Helena and Memphis on Vicksburg. On the 5th again I suggested, from Oxford, to Halleck that if the Helena troops were at my command I though it would be possible to take them and the Memphis forces south of the mouth of the Yazoo River, and thus secure Vicksburg and the State of Mississippi.  Halleck on the same day, the 5th of December, directed me not to attempt to hold the country south of the Tallahatchie, but to collect 25,000 troops at Memphis by the 20th for the Vicksburg expedition.  I sent Sherman with two divisions at once, informed the general-in-chief of the fact, and asked whether I should command the expedition down the river myself or send Sherman.  I was authorized to do as I though best for the accomplishment of the great object in view.  I sent Sherman and so informed General Halleck.  As stated, my action in sending Sherman back was expedited by a desire to get him in command of the forces separated from my direct supervision.  I feared that delay might bring McClernand, who was his senior"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5862"],["title","Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant, Part 3. (#6)"],["body"," who had authority from the President and Secretary of War to exercise that particular command,--and independently.  I doubted McClernand's fitness; and I had good reason to believe that in forestalling him I was by no means giving offence to those whose authority to command was above both him and me.  Neither my orders to General Sherman, nor the correspondence between us or between General Halleck and myself, contemplated at the time my going further south than the Yallabusha. Pemberton's force in my front was the main part of the garrison of Vicksburg, as the force with me was the defence of the territory held by us in West Tennessee and Kentucky.  I hoped to hold Pemberton in my front while Sherman should get in his rear and into Vicksburg.  The further north the enemy could be held the better.  It was understood, however, between General Sherman and myself that our movements were to be co-operative; if Pemberton could not be held away from Vicksburg I was to follow him; but at that time it was not expected to abandon the railroad north of the Yallabusha.  With that point as a secondary base of supplies, the possibility of moving down the Yazoo until communications could be opened with the Mississippi was contemplated.  It was my intention, and so understood by Sherman and his command, that if the enemy should fall back I would follow him even to the gates of Vicksburg.  I intended in such an event to hold the road to Grenada on the Yallabusha and cut loose from there, expecting to establish a new base of supplies on the Yazoo, or at Vicksburg itself, with Grenada to fall back upon in case of failure.  It should be remembered that at the time I speak of it had not been demonstrated that an army could operate in an enemy's territory depending upon the country for supplies.  A halt was called at Oxford with the advance seventeen miles south of there, to bring up the road to the latter point and to bring supplies of food, forage and munitions to the front.  On the 18th of December I received orders from Washington to divide my command into four army corps, with General McClernand to command one of them and to be assigned to that part of the army which was to operate down the Mississippi.  This interfered with my plans, but probably resulted in my ultimately taking the command in person.  McClernand was at that time in Springfield, Illinois.  The order was obeyed without any delay.  Dispatches were sent to him the same day in conformity.  On the 20th General Van Dorn appeared at Holly Springs, my secondary base of supplies, captured the garrison of 1,500 men commanded by Colonel Murphy, of the 8th Wisconsin regiment, and destroyed all our munitions of war, food and forage.  The capture was a disgraceful one to the officer commanding but not to the troops under him.  At the same time Forrest got on our line of railroad between Jackson, Tennessee, and Columbus, Kentucky, doing much damage to it.  This cut me off from all communication with the north for more than a week, and it was more than two weeks before rations or forage could be issued from stores obtained in the regular way.  This demonstrated the impossibility of maintaining so long a line of road over which to draw supplies for an army moving in an enemy's country.  I determined, therefore, to abandon my campaign into the interior with Columbus as a base, and returned to La Grange and Grand Junction destroying the road to my front and repairing the road to Memphis, making the Mississippi river the line over which to draw supplies.  Pemberton was falling back at the same time.  The moment I received the news of Van Dorn's success I sent the cavalry at the front back to drive him from the country.  He had start enough to move north destroying the railroad in many places, and to attack several small garrisons intrenched as guards to the railroad.  All these he found warned of his coming and prepared to receive him.  Van Dorn did not succeed in capturing a single garrison except the one at Holly Springs, which was larger than all the others attacked by him put together.  Murphy was also warned of Van Dorn's approach, but made no preparations to meet him.  He did not even notify his command.  Colonel Murphy was the officer who, two months before, had evacuated Iuka on the approach of the enemy.  General Rosecrans denounced him for the act and desired to have him tried and punished.  I sustained the colonel at the time because his command was a small one compared with that of the enemy--not one-tenth as large--and I thought he had done well to get away without falling into their hands.  His leaving large stores to fall into Price's possession I looked upon as an oversight and excused it on the ground of inexperience in military matters. He should, however, have destroyed them.  This last surrender demonstrated to my mind that Rosecrans' judgment of Murphy's conduct at Iuka was correct. The surrender of Holly Springs was most reprehensible and showed either the disloyalty of Colonel Murphy to the cause which he professed to serve, or gross cowardice.  After the war was over I read from the diary of a lady who accompanied General Pemberton in his retreat from the Tallahatchie, that the retreat was almost a panic.  The roads were bad and it was difficult to move the artillery and trains.  Why there should have been a panic I do not see. No expedition had yet started down the Mississippi River.  Had I known the demoralized condition of the enemy, or the fact that central Mississippi abounded so in all army supplies, I would have been in pursuit of Pemberton while his cavalry was destroying the roads in my rear.  After sending cavalry to drive Van Dorn away, my next order was to dispatch all the wagons we had, under proper escort, to collect and bring in all supplies of forage and food from a region of fifteen miles east and west of the road from our front back to Grand Junction, leaving two months' supplies for the families of those whose stores were taken. I was amazed at the quantity of supplies the country afforded.  It showed that we could have subsisted off the country for two months instead of two weeks without going beyond the limits designated.  This taught me a lesson which was taken advantage of later in the campaign when our army lived twenty days with the issue of only five days' rations by the commissary.  Our loss of supplies was great at Holly Springs, but it was more than compensated for by those taken from the country and by the lesson taught.  The news of the capture of Holly Springs and the destruction of our supplies caused much rejoicing among the people remaining in Oxford. They came with broad smiles on their faces, indicating intense joy, to ask what I was going to do now without anything for my soldiers to eat. I told them that I was not disturbed; that I had already sent troops and wagons to collect all the food and forage they could find for fifteen miles on each side of the road.  Countenances soon changed, and so did the inquiry.  The next was, \"What are WE to do?\"  My response was that we had endeavored to feed ourselves from our own northern resources while visiting them; but their friends in gray had been uncivil enough to destroy what we had brought along, and it could not be expected that men, with arms in their hands, would starve in the midst of plenty.  I advised them to emigrate east, or west, fifteen miles and assist in eating up what we left.    CHAPTER XXXI.  HEADQUARTERS MOVED TO HOLLY SPRINGS--GENERAL M'CLERNAND IN COMMAND --ASSUMING COMMAND AT YOUNG'S POINT--OPERATIONS ABOVE VICKSBURG --FORTIFICATIONS ABOUT VICKSBURG--THE CANAL--LAKE PROVIDENCE --OPERATIONS AT YAZOO PASS.  This interruption in my communications north--I was really cut off from communication with a great part of my own command during this time --resulted in Sherman's moving from Memphis before McClernand could arrive, for my dispatch of the 18th did not reach McClernand.  Pemberton got back to Vicksburg before Sherman got there.  The rebel positions were on a bluff on the Yazoo River, some miles above its mouth.  The waters were high so that the bottoms were generally overflowed, leaving only narrow causeways of dry land between points of debarkation and the high bluffs.  These were fortified and defended at all points.  The rebel position was impregnable against any force that could be brought against its front.  Sherman could not use one-fourth of his force.  His efforts to capture the city, or the high ground north of it, were necessarily unavailing.  Sherman's attack was very unfortunate, but I had no opportunity of communicating with him after the destruction of the road and telegraph to my rear on the 20th.  He did not know but what I was in the rear of the enemy and depending on him to open a new base of supplies for the troops with me.  I had, before he started from Memphis, directed him to take with him a few small steamers suitable for the navigation of the Yazoo, not knowing but that I might want them to supply me after cutting loose from my base at Grenada.  On the 23d I removed my headquarters back to Holly Springs.  The troops were drawn back gradually, but without haste or confusion, finding supplies abundant and no enemy following.  The road was not damaged south of Holly Springs by Van Dorn, at least not to an extent to cause any delay.  As I had resolved to move headquarters to Memphis, and to repair the road to that point, I remained at Holly Springs until this work was completed.  On the 10th of January, the work on the road from Holly Springs to Grand Junction and thence to Memphis being completed, I moved my headquarters to the latter place.  During the campaign here described, the losses (mostly captures) were about equal, crediting the rebels with their Holly Springs capture, which they could not hold.  When Sherman started on his expedition down the river he had 20,000 men, taken from Memphis, and was reinforced by 12,000 more"]]]
