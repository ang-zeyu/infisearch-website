Come to the point, Lafe!  What is it you and I have got to do today, or whenever it comes off?\"  \"Don't be so impatient.  The second reason is because they now think you have nerve enough for most anything, and that we two, working together might succeed in puffing off this sausage business best in our own way.\"  \"You mean we are to bomb them where and when we please?\"  \"No -- of course not!  But Byers, who is the real head here, thinks you and I, taking as many other chaps along as we please, can force our way in our fighting planes to where these pesky gas keep hanging and spying on us, and literally blow them to dashed smithereens.  See?\"  \"But how?  Their Archies will blow us to Hades and be gone before we reach anywhere near.  It looks like a forlorn hope --\"  Blaine smiled, as he interrupted with:  'Like Balaklava, eh?  Or old Pickett's third day charge at Gettysburg?\"  Erwin did not reply. Blaine continued:  \"If we go strong enough and swift and low enough, we'll got there; and, once there we'll do the bombing all righty!\"  \"And in broad daylight, too?\"  \"I don't say that, Orry.  All this is strictly between you and me. Byers rather favors a daylight raid as affording a better chance to regain our own lines, either after bombing or in case we fail.  But we're not going to fail . These dratted sausages have got to come down!\"  \"Are you sure they stay up at night?\"  \"Ever since we busted up that bluff you exposed, there they stay day and night, half a dozen or more. And my own notion is that if we have a new offensive here, which I think looks likely to a man up a tree, those blamed sausages will give the Boches too much leeway in nosing out ahead what we might be trying to do in getting ready.\"  \"Well, what else?  Will Captain Byers leave it to you? \"  \"I think he will . Having tried every other way and failed, he will let us -- you and me in private but me in public, decide upon the way we'd prefer.  Both of us have been over the ground.  We know how far we have to go.  I also know about what the Boches have got behind those balloons.  It was only a few miles from there that we -- you and me -- got that Taube and the German aviator.  Believe me, unless things have changed mightily, there isn't much there in the way of reinforcements or more planes or anything.\"  \"You've been back there since?\"  \"You bet!  Finzer and I went over there the day before you left the hospital.  The Boches have no notion that our side is doing anything here, except air-raiding in No-Man's-Land or using our planes.  That is one reason the headquarters thinks that it is a good place to -- to do something.\"  \"Well Lafe,\" Orris spoke deliberately, \"you know I am with you.  Tell me as much or as little as you please.  I'll follow you to the last notch.\"  \"I  knew it!\"  Blaine grasped his comrade's hand and nearly wrung the fingers off.  \"Well, keep mum!  Don't say anything to anybody but me. If Byers says anything, give him to understand you are in it from the word go, but no more.  We'll win out again.  Hear me?\"  For reply, Erwin shook his released fingers, regarded Blaine with mock reproach, and volunteered:  \"I'll agree to everything after that grip, I'm with you to the death. But don't do that again.\"  Blaine laughed gleefully as he turned away, patting Orris on the shoulder approvingly.  \"I always thought you were a sticker, Orry.\"  \"That's better 'n being a slicker or a slacker, isn't it?\"  Again the big fellow laughed as he hurried off towards the Captain's quarters at the far end of the grounds.  The day passed quietly.  From time to time, Blaine held private conferences with various members of the flying squad.  These were mostly Americans who had either served a year or two at the western front, or were more recent arrival who had joined because of special aptitude for flying.  During the day sundry scouts penetrated here and there over the enemy lines and their report were favorable for the plan Blaine had in mind. A risky plan, yet promising well if skillfully carried out.  Towards night he had a last conference with Byers, who had more than hesitated over the proposed program, yet gave in before the Sergeant's enthusiasms.  \"I agree,\" said the commander.  \"But it is risky.  It can be done.  Yet whether you are the man to do it -- well, we'll know in the morning. Do your best.  Be prudent; not too prudent; but at the same time try to be wise to things as they come up.   Remember I have more responsibility than you.  Your responsibility is only to me.  It ceases where mine begins.\"  \"Don't fear, Captain.  Let what Erwin and I did the other night be duly considered.  I need your full support --\"  \"Young man, you have it!\"  Here Byers took Blaine's hand and shook it heartily.  \"Bring back as many of your squad as you can, but above all carry out your program.\"  Night came, and with it a comfortable fog that rose white and misty, good for the purpose in hand.  The clocks were pointing towards seven when something like a dozen men, wearing the regulation uniform, gathered at the usual open space, while from the doors of several hangars mechanics were silently rolling out machines.  Each aviator gave a few comprehensive looks and touches to his own plane, just to reassure himself that things were all right.  Then came a brief moment or two of silent waiting.  There were no, spectators. Even the rest of the men at the aerodrome did not appear.  This was according to orders.  Out in front stood Captain Byers, attended by Blaine and Erwin, talking in low, indistinct tones.   Finally Byers looked at his watch.  \"Time's up, I guess.  Do your best, you two.  You, Blaine, will veer to the right as you approach the enemy trenches.  You, sir,\" to Orris, \"will draw to the left.  Your squads will follow their respective leaders.  Should you meet opposition before you reach the balloons, don't flinch.  Pour on more speed.  Don't signal unless necessary but obey signals when given.  Au revoir, lads!  Don't come back until you have delivered the goods.\"  Back went the Sergeant and Corporal, each to his own machine, which headed a short double line holding six planes, or a dozen in all.  At a quiet signal the leaders rose, spiraling into the upper darkness. Presently all had vanished, zigzagging in an easterly direction.  About this time there came a sudden blue flare as a solitary rocket shot upward from beyond the grove of trees that that marked the landing place within the enclosed area that formed this aerodrome.  Instantly Byers was on the qui vive, he being nearest the point indicated by the blue flare.  Bursting into a full run, he sped towards the spot, at the same time breaking in on several sentries unobtrusively posted about the grounds where the raiders had departed.   \"Scatter lads!\" he ordered.  \"Hurry!  Spies at work!  Halt any one you see, no matter who!  Bring 'em in!\"  Never halting in his race, he made directly for the spot whence the flare of the rocket had gone up.  As he neared the trees, the sounds of a child's voice came to his ears, just inside the grove.  It was remonstrating to some one.  \"D -- don't, papa!  I -- I want to get the pieces.  My! Wasn't it pretty --\"  Another voice, hoarse, gruff, stopped the childish words, but what it said was indistinguishable.  Byers looked around.  Two of his sentries were near, all of them running.  \"Did you hear that child?\" queried the captain.  \"Scatter!  Don't let either child or the grow one escape.  Be spry!  Watch out!\"  As Byers uttered the last exclamation, a running figure emerged from the shadow of the nearer trees and started full tilt towards the quarters where the cook's galley was.  All three, running hard had slightly scattered, in order to intercept the fugitive should he try to dodge amid the various buildings.   Swift as were the pursuers, the fugitive was more speedy.  At one instant they saw him in a twinkling of light from one of the open doors.  The next  instant the form was gone.  There came a faint echo of half-smothered infantile cries.  Byers dashed by the lighted door, then stumbled over  a small form on the ground and there rose another wail, now of terror if not of pain.  Quickly the captain picked up the small figure in big arms and ran on, holding it gently, yet firmly, and saying:  \"There, there, little one!  I won't hurt you!\"  \"D -- don't you hurt my pa, \" wailed the small figure in his arms.  \"He -- was only making show for me --\"  More crying.  Where was the man?  Only one clew had the captain.  The fellow was round-shouldered, or seemed so in the glimpse Byers caught of them just before he dropped the child.  Presently, one after another of the sentries came in, breathless yet unsuccessful.  Somehow the fugitive had vanished, and look as they might, no further sign of him was seen.  \"Skip around some more!\" ordered the captain.  \"Try every door you pass.  The fellow must be around somewhere.  Call me if necessary. I'll be on hand.\"  While the baffled sentries did as directed Byers who was a father himself, placed the child on a convenient bench beside him, patting its head soothingly with one hand while he searched his pockets with the other.  Then he produced the remnant of a package of chocolate drops, part of the contents of a box recently received from home.  \"Like candy?\" he asked, putting some of the candy in the child's lap. \"Good candy -- right, from my home across the sea.\"  This in such French as Byers could command, which was plenty for the purpose.  At first the child, whom he now perceived was a girl, would not try it, but presently a sight of the sweet was more than it could stand.  Seizing the offered sweets, it began to eat greedily.  \"My papa have no sweets like this,\" munching greedily.  \"Who you? Where my papa?\"  \"Know where your pa stays?  I take you back"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6082"],["title","Our Pilots in the Air (#8)"],["body"," him.\"  For an answer the girl jumped down, still clutching the candy.  She took Byers' hand, leading him back by another alley amid buildings here devoted to the culinary department of that cantonment.  One of the sentries appeared.  The child pushed on, leading Byers, who cautioned the sentry to say nothing, but to follow.  \"What is your papa's name?\" asked the captain.  \"He name Bauer -- Monsieur Bauer --\" The child suddenly stopped.  \"What is the matter, little one?\" asked Byers, pulses thrilling under a vague suspicion.  But here the sentry, forgetting the captain's caution, interposed with:  \"I know him, Sir!  Hermann Bauer, our assistant quartermaster -\"  'Hush-h-h!\" admonished Byers, frowning, shaking his head and pointing at the child, now staring at him wonderingly, then pouting as she queried:  \"You no hurt my papa?\"  The door of a nearby house suddenly flew open and a fleshy, round-shouldered man appeared.  He saluted, then said:  \"Good evening, Messieurs!  I see you have my little girl with you.\"  \"Monsieur Bauer!\"  The captain stood up, ignoring the other's salute. \"I suppose you know that you are now under arrest?\"  \"It is what I feared.  May I take my little girl inside?\"  \"Yes, provided the sentry and I go with you.\"  \"You may as well: you'll go anyway.  Please do not give me away.\"  With remarkable nerve, Bauer lifted the wondering child to his arms and led the way inside.  Five minutes later he emerged, the captain and the sentry on either side, and set out amid childish protests from within.  \"She overtook me while I was on my way,\" he confessed.  \"It is fate, I guess.\"  Then the three started on the way to aerodrome headquarters.  About this time came the sounds of heavy firing over No-Man's-Land.  \"That is one result of your rocket, Bauer, Byers, grimly.      CHAPTER VII  DOWNING THE SAUSAGES  Once clear of the Allied front line of trenches, the double platoon of planes spread out on either hand, flying swiftly yet keeping near the earth.  This was strange for so formidable a squadron of fighting, one-man planes that usually soar up to lofty heights, far from the direct range Fritzy's Archies.  But their instructions were clear, and each trained pilot knew just what he had to do.  Swiftly and still more swiftly they flew.  The night mists, growing yet more opaque, promised, favorably.  Appincourte Bluff, just beyond the little river, could hardly be seen at all, but the roar of the motors overhead indicated that something might be on the wing.  Without question few advance sentries still remained near the ruins that once had been a capacious subterranean chamber.  From there the Germans had doubtless expected to emerge in assault, while their artillery made the essential barrage to stay any possible resistance while their infantry crossed the stream.  But the Allied bombardment, made possible by Erwin's daring final flight across the Bluff towards his own quarters, had made Appincourte futile so far as that assault went.  Still Fritz might be there.  He was there -- that is, a few of him.  They were watching for a signal - the blue flare of a rocket that should tell Fritz of another air raid.  But the noise of motors close above confused his calculations.  Why were the Entente airmen flying so low?  Might they not be up to more devilment with regard to Appincourte?  The blue flare had gone up.  But it happened that Fritz did not see it.  Fearing now that many bombs might be dropped their defenseless heads, and with the whir of many motors in their ears, all the time growing louder, nearer, the small squad of night sentries, scudded as one man for the small dugout.  This had been made immediately after the Bluff was wrecked by the bombardment.  In there they cuddled, expecting the deafening explosion of many bombs over or on their heads, determined to fly back to their advanced trenches at the first let-up of the expected deluge.  But no bombs descended.  The motor thunderings passed, then dwindled, but towards the east.  What did that mean?  Their sergeant was telephoning hurriedly as to what was happening: \"Airplane motors close overhead.  No bombing yet.  Watch out.\"  Thus it happened that Bauer's first (and last) signal was rendered void insofar as it went.  The raiders escaped the German fire for the time being.  Moreover, they were puzzled.  Why should the Allied \"schwein\" fly so low, yet do no harm where once they had wrecked things only a few days before?  What were they up to, anyhow?  This query was not answered at once.  The telephones roused the Huns in the front trenches.  Yet it puzzled them, too.  Hitherto the bombing on both sides had been done mostly from far above.  Such skimming the ground across No-Man's-Land might mean anything.  Presently the thrum of approaching planes became more and more audible along that portion of the front.  From his plane Blaine made private signal to the others to put on all speed.  Erwin did likewise.  Consequently it was not a minute before the raiders were upon the front trenches, going at the rate of two miles a minute.  Each man in those planes sat with an open nest of hand grenades within easy reach.  The handle of the         gun crank was handy, its deadly muzzle pointed along the top of the fuselage of each mobile plane.  Then a pistol shot rang out, and at the signal grenades were dropped as the now far extended line passed over those open trenches in which troops were massed.  For, be it known, that fatal blue flare from the aerodrome a dozen or more miles away had filled those trenches yet more full of human cannon fodder.  Hence the bombing was all the more deadly.  Passing the trenches, at another signal, the hostile planes nimbly wheeled, shot back again and poured forth more bombs upon those trenches.  Still again they wheeled and traversed them for the third time.  By this time machine guns began to spatter their deadly contents among the darting planes, while further back the anti-aircraft guns gave forth searching roars as to what they might should a plane be hit.  It was enough so far as it went.  Now for the gas-bags, the sausages; for these observation balloons were the real object of all this nocturnal pother.  \"Forward!\" came the signal again and, steering to the left, rising higher from the forty to fifty foot level they had hitherto kept, the squadron made for the rear line.  Here rose a shadowy line of oval bags, so shaped as to qualify them for the term \"sausage\" as humorously fitted to these defenseless spying observatories.  In daytime their elevation enabled them to see over a great expanse of that level, war-ruined region.  There they were, open carriages below, in each a small group of Fritzies with machine gun and bombs handy for use in times like the present.  But here, too, Fritz was at a decided disadvantage.  Evidently no raid was anticipated, for here they swung, hardly half manned except by the few constituting the night watch.  In and out among them shot the fast planes, the machines belching their deadly hail, with Fritz apparently too dazed by surprise to make much resistance.  Using explosive bullets that would flare sparks of fire at the moment of contact, soon those bags of gas were ignited, one after another. Down rope ladders the occupants climbed or dangled, dropping off to hit the ground maimed or lifeless.  By this time, however, the Archies were pouring a rain of shells from the machine guns at the assailants with murderous and often fatal effect.  One plane after another sagged, lamely drooped and went to earth crippled or in flames. It so happened that Blaine and Erwin nearly met in, mid-air as each verged close in a final assault on the last balloon.  Seizing his megaphone, Blaine shouted:  \"We'll down this one, then home!\"  Bang - puff!  A burst of flame enveloped the last sausage, and Blaine was already mounting higher, higher, when he saw Erwin's plane go zigzagging earthward at a gentle angle.  One of his wings had been shattered, the remnants flopping as they fell.  Orris, working at the controls, partially righted, then staggered on, and finally mounted upward, showing his chief that he would make the home trip if nothing further happened.  Blaine himself tried to follow.  But something was wrong.  He fell, half gliding, and finally landed with his planes too much shot to up for the machine to float longer.  \"I'm a goner, unless something happens,\" he thought.  \"Where was he?  In that last staggering rise the sergeant was vaguely aware that just beyond some trees under him was an open space of some kind.  Could he make that open space?  The front enemy trenches and the line where the vanished gas bags had swung were behind him.  \"Seems to me I saw one of our planes drifting over this way.\"  On earth it was darker, more misty, more impenetrable than it had been overhead.  His watch, having an illuminated dial, indicated that the time was about ten o'clock.  In his rear the darkness was more dense than ahead.  Probably his plane had dropped just in the edge of that open space he thought he had dimly seen while up in the air.  While looking over his machine as best he could to see if there was any chance to tinker it up so as to make another flight, he stopped short, his pulse leaping.  Then he stood motionless.  \"What was that?\" he kept thinking, keeping as quiet as possible.  After a lengthy interval he heard rustling amid the trees near by, then a subdued crashing limbs, then an unintelligible moan or groan.  After that came a heavy shock as if something or some one had struck the earth.  \"I must look into this,\" he reflected, listening now also for any other sounds of human presence.  But all was still near by.  Back west there came the dying echoes of the recent scrimmage with the raiders.  Hans, having gotten the worst end that deal, seemed to have subsided.  \"Fritzy is preparing to look into things.  He must know that some of us were knocked out.  Doubtless he is getting ready "]]]
