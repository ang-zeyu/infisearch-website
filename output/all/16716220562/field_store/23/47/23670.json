Besides, he would probably be worth as much to his father as anyone, and his labor in neither case provide money to pay for the cow. Obviously that would not answer. He must think of some other way, but at present none seemed open. He sensibly deferred thinking till after the examination.  \"Are you going to the school examination, father?\" asked our hero.  \"I can't spare time, Harry. I should like to, for I want to know how far you have progressed. 'Live and learn,' my boy. That's a good motto, though Squire Green thinks that 'Live and earn' is a better.\"  \"That's the rule he acts on,\" said Mrs. Walton. \"He isn't troubled with learning.\"  \"No, he isn't as good a scholar probably as Tom, here.\"  \"Isn't he?\" said Tom, rather complacently.  \"Don't feel too much flattered, Tom,\" said his mother.  \"You don't know enough to hurt you.\"  \"He never will,\" said his sister, Jane, laughing.  \"I don't want to know enough to hurt me,\" returned Tom, good humoredly. He was rather used to such compliments, and didn't mind them.  \"No,\" said Mr. Walton; \"I am afraid I can't spare time to come to the examination. Are you going, mother?\"  It is quite common in the country for husbands to address wives in this manner.  \"I shall try to go in the last of the afternoon,\" said Mrs. Walton.  \"If you will come, mother,\" said Harry, \"we'll all help you afterwards, so you won't lose anything by it.\"  \"I think I will contrive to come.\"  The examination took place in the afternoon. Mr. Burbank preferred to have it so, for two reasons. It allowed time to submit the pupils to a previous private examination in the morning, thus insuring a better appearance in the afternoon. Besides, in the second place, the parents were more likely to be at liberty to attend in the afternoon, and he naturally liked to have as many visitors as possible. He was really a good teacher, though his qualifications were limited; but as far as his knowledge went, he was quite successful in imparting it to others.  In the afternoon there was quite a fair attendance of parents and friends of the scholars, though some did not come in till late, like Mrs. Walton. It is not my intention to speak of the examination in detail. My readers know too little of the scholars to make that interesting. Ephraim Higgins made some amusing mistakes, but that didn't excite any surprise, for his scholarship was correctly estimated in the village. Tom Walton did passably well, but was not likely to make his parents proud of his performances. Harry, however, eclipsed himself. His ambition had been stirred by the offer of a prize, and he was resolved to deserve it. His recitations were prompt and correct, and his answers were given with confidence. But perhaps he did himself most credit in declamation. He had always been very fond of that, and though he had never received and scientific instruction in it, he possessed a natural grace and a deep feeling of earnestness which made success easy. He had selected an extract from Webster--the reply to the Hayne--and this was the showpiece of the afternoon. The rest of the declamation was crude enough, but Harry's impressed even the most ignorant of his listeners as superior for a boy of his age. When he uttered his last sentence, and made a parting bow, there was subdued applause, and brought a flush of gratification to the cheek of our young hero.  \"This is the last exercise,\" said the teacher \"except one. At the commencement of the term, I offered a prize to the scholar that would do the best from that time till the close of the school. I will now award the prize. Harry Walton, come forward.\"  Harry rose from his seat, his cheeks flushed again with gratification, and advanced to where the teacher was standing.  \"Harry,\" said Mr. Burbank, \"I have no hesitation in giving you the prize. You have excelled all the other scholars, and it is fairly yours. The book is not of much value, but I think you will find it interesting and instructive. It is the life of the great American philosopher and statesman, Benjamin Franklin. I hope you will read and profit by it, and try like him to make your life a credit to yourself and a blessing to mankind.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Harry, bowing low. \"I will try to do so.\"  There was a speech by the chairman of the school committee, in which allusion was made to Harry and the prize, and the exercises were over. Harry received the congratulations of his schoolmates and others with modest satisfaction, but he was most pleased by the evident pride and pleasure which his mother exhibited, when she, too, was congratulated on his success. His worldly prospects were very uncertain, but he had achieved the success for which he had been laboring, and he was happy.      CHAPTER VI. LOOKING OUT ON THE WORLD   It was not until evening that Harry had a chance to look at his prize. It was a cheap book, costing probably not over a dollar; but except his schoolbooks, and a ragged copy of \"Robinson Crusoe,\" it was the only book that our hero possessed. His father found it difficult enough to buy him the necessary books for use in school, and could not afford to buy any less necessary. So our young hero, who was found of reading, though seldom able to gratify his taste, looked forward with great joy to the pleasure of reading his new book. He did not know much about Benjamin Franklin, but had a vague idea that he was a great man.  After his evening \"chores\" were done, he sat down by the table on which was burning a solitary tallow candle, and began to read. His mother was darning stockings, and his father had gone to the village store on an errand.  So he began the story, and the more he read the more interesting he found it. Great as he afterwards became, he was surprised to find that Franklin was a poor boy, and had to work for a living. He started out in life on his own account, and through industry, frugality, perseverance, and a fixed determination to rise in life, he became a distinguished an in the end, and a wise man also, though his early opportunities were very limited. It seemed to Harry that there was a great similarity between his own circumstances and position in life and those of the great man about whom he was reading, and this made the biography the more fascinating. The hope came to him that, by following Franklin's example, he, too, might become a successful man.  His mother, looking up at intervals from the stockings which had been so repeatedly darned that the original texture was almost wholly lost of sight of, noticed how absorbed he was.  \"Is your book interesting, Harry?\" she asked.  \"It's the most interesting book I ever read,\" said Harry, with a sigh of intense enjoyment.  \"It's about Benjamin Franklin, isn't it?\"  \"Yes. Do you know, mother, he was a poor boy, and he worked his way up?\"  \"Yes, I have heard so, but I never read his life.\"  \"You'd better read this when I have finished it. I've been thinking that there's a chance for me, mother.\"  \"A chance to do what?\"  \"A chance to be somebody when I get bigger. I'm poor now, but so was Franklin. He worked hard, and tried to learn all he could. That's the way he succeeded. I'm going to do the same.\"  \"We can't all be Franklins, my son,\" said Mrs. Walton, not wishing her son to form high hopes which might be disappointed in the end.  \"I know that, mother, and I don't expect to be a great man like him. But if I try hard I think I can rise in the world, and be worth a little money.\"  \"I hope you wont' be as poor as your father, Harry,\" said Mrs. Walton, sighing, as she thought of the years of pain privation and pinching poverty reaching back to the time of their marriage. They had got through it somehow, but she hoped that their children would have a brighter lot.  \"I hope not,\" said Harry. \"If I ever get rich, you shan't have to work any more.\"  Mrs. Walton smiled faintly. She was not hopeful, and thought it probable that before Harry became rich, both she and her husband would be resting from their labor in the village churchyard. But she would not dampen Harry's youthful enthusiasm by the utterance of such a thought.  \"I am sure you won't let your father and mother want, if you have the means to prevent it,\" she said aloud.  \"We can't any of us tell what's coming, but I hope you may be well off some time.\"  \"I read in the country paper the other day that many of the richest men in Boston and New York were once poor boys,\" said Harry, in a hopeful tone.  \"So I have heard,\" said his mother.  \"If they succeeded I don't see why I can't.\"  \"You must try to be something more than a rich man. I shouldn't want you to be like Squire Green.\"  \"He is rich, but he is mean and ignorant. I don't think I shall be like him. He has cheated father about the cow.\"  \"Yes, he drove a sharp trade with him, taking advantage of his necessities. I am afraid your father won't be able to pay for the cow six months from now.\"  \"I am afraid so, too.\"  \"I don't see how we can possibly save up forty dollars. We are economical now as we can be.\"  \"That is what I have been thinking of, mother. There is no chance of father's paying the money.\"  \"Then it won't be paid, and we shall be worse off when the note comes due, than now.\"  \"Do you think,\" said Harry, laying down the book on the table, and looking up earnestly, \"do you think, mother, I could any way earn the forty dollars before it is to be paid?\"  \"You, Harry?\" repeated his mother, in surprise, \"what could you do to earn the money?\"  \"I don't know, yet,\" answered Harry; \"but there are a great many things to be done.\"  \"I don't know what you can do, except to hire out to a farmer, and they pay very little. Besides, I don't know of any farmer in the town that wants a boy. Most of them have boys of their own, or men.\"  \"I wasn't thinking of that,\" said Harry. \"There isn't much chance there.\"  \"I don't know of any work to do here.\"  \"Nor I, mother. But I wasn't thinking of staying in town.\"  \"Not thinking of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5977"],["title","Bound to Rise; Or, Up the Ladder (#5)"],["body","in town!\" repeated Mrs. Walton, in surprise. \"You don't want to leave home, do you?\"  \"No, mother, I don't want to leave home, or I wouldn't want to, if there was anything to do here. But you know there isn't. Farm work wont' help me along, and I don't' like it as well as some other kinds of work. I must leave home if I want to rise in the world.\"  \"But your are too young, Harry.\"  This was touching Harry on a tender spot. No boy of fourteen likes to be considered very young. By that time he generally begins to feel a degree of self-confidence and self-reliance, and fancies he is almost on the threshold of manhood. I know boys of fourteen who look in the glass daily for signs of a coming mustache, and fancy they can see plainly what is not yet visible. Harry had not got as far as that, but he no longer looked upon himself as a young boy. He was stout and strong, and of very good height for his age, and began to feel manly. So he drew himself up, upon this remark of his mother's, and said proudly: \"I am going on fifteen\"--that sounds older than fourteen--\"and I don't call that very young.\"  \"It seems but a little while since you were a baby,\" said his mother, meditatively.  \"I hope you don't think me anything like a baby now, mother,\" said Harry, straightening up, and looking as large as possible.  \"No, you're quite a large boy, now. How quick the years have passed!\"  \"And I am strong for my age, too, mother. I am sure I am old enough to take care of myself.\"  \"But you are young to go out into the world.\"  \"I don't believe Franklin was much older than I, and he got along. There are plenty of boys who leave home before they are as old as I am.\"  \"Suppose you are sick, Harry?\"  \"If I am I'll come home. But you know I am very healthy, mother, and if I am away from home I shall be very careful.\"  \"But you would not be sure of getting anything to do.\"  \"I'll risk that, mother,\" said Harry, in a confident tone.  \"Did you think of this before you read that book?\"  \"Yes, I've been thinking of it for about a month; but the book put it into my head to-night. I seem to see my way clearer than I did. I want most of all, to earn money enough to pay for the cow in six months. You know yourself, mother, there isn't any chance of father doing it himself, and I can't earn anything if I stay at home.\"  \"Have you mentioned the matter to your father yet, Harry?\"  \"No, I haven't. I wish you would speak about it tonight, mother. You can tell him first what makes me want to go.\"  \"I'll tell him that you want to go; but I won't promise to say I think it a good plan.\"  \"Just mention it, mother, and then I'll talk with him about it to-morrow.\"  To this Mrs. Walton agreed, and Harry, after reading a few pages more in the \"Life of Franklin,\" went up to bed; but it was some time before he slept. His mind was full of the new scheme on which he had set his heart.      CHAPTER VII. IN FRANKLIN'S FOOTSTEPS   \"Father,\" said Harry, the next morning, as Mr. Walton was about to leave the house, \"there's something I want to say to you.\"  \"What is it?\" asked his father, imagining it was some trifle.  \"I'll go out with you, and tell you outside.\"  \"Very well, my son.\"  Harry put on his cap, and followed his father into the open air.  \"Now, my son, what is it?\"  \"I want to go away from home.\"  \"Away from home! Where?\" asked Mr. Walton, in surprise.  \"I don't know where; but somewhere where I can earn my own living.\"  \"But you can do that here. You can give me your help on the farm, as you always have done.\"  \"I don't like farming, father.\"  \"You never told me that before. Is it because of the hard work?\"  \"No,\" said Harry, earnestly. \"I am not afraid of hard work; but you know how it is, father. This isn't a very good farm, and it's all you can do to make a living for the rest of us out of it. If I could go somewhere, where I could work at something else, I could send you home my wages.\"  \"I am afraid a boy like you couldn't earn very large wages.\"  \"I don't see why not, father. I'm strong and stout, and willing to work.\"  \"People don't give much for boys' work.\"  \"I don't expect much; but I know I can get something, and by and by it will lead to more. I want to help you to pay for that cow you've just bought of Squire Green.\"  \"I don't see how I'm going to pay for it,\" said Mr. Walton, with a sigh. \"Hard money's pretty scarce, and we farmers don't get much of it.\"  \"That's just what I'm saying, father. There isn't much money to be got in farming. That's why I want to try something else.\"  \"How long have you been thinking of this plan, Harry?\"  \"Only since last night.\"  \"What put it into your head?\"  \"That book I got as a prize.\"  \"It is the life of Franklin, isn't it?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Did he go away from home when he was a boy?\"  \"Yes, and he succeeded, too.\"  \"I know he did. He became a famous man. But it isn't every boy that is like Franklin.\"  \"I know that. I never expect to become a great man like him; but I can make something.\"  Harry spoke those words in a firm, resolute tone, which seemed to indicate a consciousness of power. Looking in his son's face, the elder Walton, though by no means a sanguine man, was inclined to think favorably of the scheme, But he was cautious, and he did not want Harry to be too confident of success.  \"It's a new idea to me,\" he said. \"Suppose you fail?\"  \"I don't mean to.\"  \"But suppose you do--suppose you get sick?\"  \"Then I'll come home. But I want to try. There must be something for me to do in the world.\"  \"There's another thing, Harry. It takes money to travel round, and I haven't got any means to give you.\"  \"I don't want any, father. I mean to work my way. I've got twenty-five cents to start with. Now, father, what do you say?\"  \"I'll speak to your mother about it.\"  \"To-day?\"  \"Yes, as soon as I go in.\"  With this Harry was content. He had a good deal of confidence that he could carry his point with both parents. He went into the house, and said to his mother:  \"Mother, father's going to speak to you about my going away from home. Now don't you oppose it.\"  \"Do you really think it would be a good plan, Harry?\"  \"Yes, mother.\"  \"And if you're sick will you promise to come right home?\"  \"Yes, I'll promise that.\"  \"Then I won't oppose your notion, though I ain't clear about its being wise.\"  \"We'll talk about that in a few months, mother.\"  \"Has Harry spoken to you about his plan of going away from home?\" asked the farmer, when he reentered the house.  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Walton.  \"What do you think?\"  \"Perhaps we'd better let the lad have his way. He's promised to come home if he's taken sick.\"  \"So let it be, then, Harry. When do you want to go?\"  \"As soon as I can.\"  \"You'll have to wait till Monday. It'll take a day or two to fix up your clothes,\" said his mother.  \"All right, mother.\"  \"I don't know but you ought to have some new shirts. You haven't got but two except the one you have on.\"  \"I can get along, mother. Father hasn't got any money to spend for me. By the time I want some new shirts, I'll buy them myself.\"  \"Where do you think of going, Harry? Have you any idea?\"  \"No, mother. I'm going to trust to luck. I shan't go very far. When I've got fixed anywhere I'll write, and let you know.\"  In the evening Harry resumed the \"Life of Franklin,\" and before he was ready to go to bed he had got two thirds through with it. It possessed for him a singular fascination. To Harry it was no alone the \"Life of Benjamin Franklin.\" It was the chart by which he meant to steer in the unknown career which stretched before him. He knew so little of the world that he trusted implicitly to that as a guide, and he silently stored away the wise precepts in conformity with which the great practical philosopher had shaped and molded his life.  During that evening, however, another chance was offered to Harry, as I shall now describe.  As the family were sitting around the kitchen table, on which was placed the humble tallow candle by which the room was lighted, there was heard a scraping at the door, and presently a knock. Mr. Walton answered it in person, and admitted the thin figure and sharp, calculating face of Squire Green.  \"How are you, neighbor?\" he said, looking about him with his parrotlike glance. \"I thought I'd just run in a minute to see you as I was goin' by.\"  \"Sit down, Squire Green. Take the rocking-chair.\"  \"Thank you, neighbor. How's the cow a-doin'?\"  \"Middling well. She don't give as much milk as the one I lost.\"  \"She'll do better bymeby. She's a good bargain to you, neighbor.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Hiram Walton, dubiously. \"She ought to be a good cow for the price you asked.\"  \"And she is a good cow,\" said the squire, emphatically; \"and you're lucky to get her so cheap, buyin' on time. What are you doin' there, Harry? School through, ain't it?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I hear you're a good scholar. Got the prize, didn't you?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Walton; \"Harry was always good at his books.\"  \"I guess he knows enough now. You'd ought to set him to work.\"  \"He is ready enough to work,\" said Mr. Walton. \"He never was lazy.\"  \"That's good. There's a sight of lazy, shiftless boys about in these days. Seems as if they expected to earn their bread 'n butter a-doin' nothin'. I've been a thinkin', neighbor Walton, that you'll find it hard to pay for that cow in six months.\"  \"I am afraid I shall,\" said the farmer, thinking in surprise, \"Can he be going to reduce the price?\"  \"So I thought mebbe we might make an arrangement to make it easier.\"  \"I should be glad to have it made easier, squire. It was hard on me, losing that cow by disease.\"  \"Of course. Well, what I was thinkin' was, you might hire out your boy to work for me. I'd allow him two dollars a month and board, and the wages would help pay for the cow.\"  Harry looked up in dismay at this proposition. He knew very well the meanness of the board which the squire provided, how inferior it was even to the scanty, but well-cooked meals which he got at home; he knew,"]]]
