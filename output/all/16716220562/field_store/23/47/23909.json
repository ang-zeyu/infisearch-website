JACK. “He has just climbed a tall chimney stack marked Bovril, and is now sitting on the top.”  WALTER. Good Lord!  JACK. “Marked Bovril,” is this to be your fate, alas, my poor brother!  WALTER (_snatches the wire and reads_). “They are fetching a fire escape. He keeps yowling.”  STELLA (_taking telegram_). Yowling?  WALTER. Suppose the police get him and think it’s me, I’ll be blamed for all this damned thing. We must catch him. We’ll buy a gag and handcuffs as we go along.  STELLA. Gag? Why?  WALTER. Because he’s yowling! Stop! Stella must stay in case Mrs. Everest comes. (_Calls._) Mrs. Anderson! I want a cab!    (_He and JACK rush out D. in F._)  STELLA. I’m so excited I think I’ll play the piano in the other room.    (_Exit R. to drawing-room and immediately plays and sings   “Caressante.”_)    (_AUTOMATON enters D. in F., in black frock-coat, but now hatless,   goes to cupboard, paws at the door, goes and knocks over chair, then   to table up L. and takes up a tumbler, brings it down mechanically to   front C., half raises it, then lets it fall on the floor and sits by   table R., facing audience and says:_)  AUTOMATON. Tick-tick-Yow.    (_MRS. ANDERSON enters D. in F. with a black frock-coat in tailor’s   parcel, places it on table R. top end, then sees AUTOMATON and comes   out C., to speak._)  MRS. ANDERSON. Oh, he’s there, are he? (_Using handkerchief as she speaks._)  AUTOMATON. Yow.  MRS. ANDERSON. There’s a parcel from the tailoring folks with a message hopering as it were in time.  AUTOMATON. Yow-Yow. (_She starts a little._)  MRS. ANDERSON. The pore young lady is a-sittering in there.  AUTOMATON. Tick-tick. Yow-yow! (_Same business._)  MRS. ANDERSON. Ain’t you in good ’ealth, Mr. Everest, sir?  AUTOMATON. Yow-chuck, Yow-yow.    (_Rises and makes mechanical exit to bedroom L._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_watching him_). Pore-young-man!    (_Enter STELLA R._)  Mr. Everest have come back, mum; gone in his bedroom, mum; been to the pub.-house again, or I’m much mistook. Pore-young-man!    (_Exit D. in F._)  STELLA (_calls across_). Walter, here’s a parcel--Walter!    (_AUTOMATON enters door L., but does not come out, she sees him._)  Walter, why have you left Jack? Is anything wrong?  AUTOMATON. Yow! (_Turns and goes in again D.L._)  STELLA (_crossing to the door_). Walter! (_Door shuts._) How very polite of you! Are you changing? (_Voice off says, “Yow.”_) Oh, very well, if you won’t answer me. I’m in the drawing-room all alone!    (_Has crossed back to R., and goes in._)  AUTOMATON (_enters L._). Tick-chuck-yow. (_Goes up, hits door of cupboard twice._) Chuck-yow-yow.    (_Goes to recess, knocks over a chair, hits clock, etc., and goes   into china cupboard in recess L. A loud noise of smashing of crockery   off. STELLA through this is playing and singing same air as before._)    (_WALTER comes in D. in F., as soon as ever he can, walking quite   quietly as contrast to the very quick exit of AUTOMATON. Brown   jacket._)  WALTER (_comes to table R., calling_). Stella! I want you. Stella!  STELLA (_stops singing a moment to call_). I’m not coming! (_Resumes song off._)  WALTER (_takes up parcel_). My new coat at last. The moment I get Davidson under lock and key I’m going to change into this and get away to Brighton. (_Puts parcel down._)    (_STELLA enters R._)  Why wouldn’t you come a minute ago?  STELLA. Why did you shut that door in my face?  WALTER. When?  STELLA. After you went out.  WALTER. After I went out--before I came home? Did I speak?  STELLA. No.  WALTER. It’s as plain as a pikestaff, it’s come home!  STELLA (_slowly and firmly_). I believe you’re right. Now I’ve seen you both I’ll never mistake again.  WALTER. It must be somewhere on the premises now.    (_They hurriedly look about under furniture, and meet and collide up   C., and say, “Oh!” Noise in china cupboard._)  WALTER. It’s in the bedroom. Run down to Mrs. Anderson and borrow the very largest blanket.  STELLA. Why?  WALTER. I want something to throw over it.    (_STELLA exit D. in F._)  WALTER (_listens to fresh sounds_). No! It’s in the china cupboard!    (_A wooden hand with fingers extended is mysteriously thrust out of   china cupboard door. He gets a plate and smashes it on this hand,   which is at once withdrawn. This can be done with a real hand and   smash plate on door near it._)    (_He quickly turns key._)  WALTER. Got it--got it!    (_He jubilantly dances down C., then goes and calls out D. in F._)  Stella, Stella, I’ve locked it in the china cupboard. I don’t want the blanket. (_Returns._) Gone in the kitchen, I suppose! (_Takes up parcel._) Change my coat at last and get away! (_Goes into bedroom L._)    (_Immediately on his exit a loud smashing in china clipboard, then   the door flies into splinters and is knocked down, and AUTOMATON   enters quickly, hurries right round C., and into bedroom after   WALTER._)  WALTER (_within, as loud noise in bedroom_). Hi! stop!  AUTOMATON (_within_). Yow-yow.  WALTER (_rushing in, dressed in black coat_). By Jove! what an escape!    (_JACK, carrying blanket of green flannel or red, enters with STELLA,   who has gag and handcuffs--enter D. in F._)    (_WALTER makes signs to them, pointing to bedroom and beckoning them   to follow him there._)  JACK. Is that it?  STELLA. Yes, yes, Jack, yes!    (_JACK throws blanket over WALTER, and they get him on chair C._)  JACK. Hurrah! we’ve got him now! (_Business: secure him with rope round his legs and gag, then take blanket off._) (_WALTER, gagged, groans._) No more climbing tall chimney stacks! (_WALTER groans._)  STELLA. Is it in pain?  JACK. Of course not.  STELLA. It groans so!  JACK. Rather mad at being caught.  STELLA. Is it wax-work?  JACK. More like indiarubber. I suppose you do see the difference this time?  STELLA. Rather.  JACK. That’s not flesh and blood. (_Pulling its nose._)  STELLA. It seems to want to explain something.  JACK. It will never get the chance of that. (_Lighting a candle from mantel R._)  STELLA. Poor thing! are you tired of living? (_Groan._)  JACK. How can it answer you?  STELLA. I believe it could if you took the gag out of its mouth.  JACK. Hold the candle under its nose. (_Groan._)  STELLA. No, no, no! (_JACK puts candle on table._)  JACK (_with pin from waistcoat_). I want to see what it will do when I stick this pin in it. (_Groan._)  STELLA. No, no!  JACK. In its leg, you can nip its arms and legs. (_Does so--groan._)  STELLA. It doesn’t seem to like being nipped.  JACK. In the interests of science I’m going to bleed it. (_Loud groans._) Give me a carving knife. (_Groans._)    (_MRS. ANDERSON has entered and come down--sees WALTER, screams. They   start._)  MRS. ANDERSON. The gent I does for came down the other stair from the bedroom (_pointing L._) and is in the kitchen premises at this here identical period of time.  JACK. What! _Is_ he?  MRS. ANDERSON. Here have I been a-doing for two twins at the price of one.  JACK (_bustles MRS. ANDERSON to D. in F._). Send Mr. Everest up at once! (_Exit MRS. ANDERSON._)  JACK. Now to make an end of this fiend!    (_WALTER, who has been watching them as well as he could, now pretends   to be dead._)  Hullo! I don’t think I’ll want any instruments, it’s passing away! (_Business._) Not breathing! (_Looks at watch._) It’s eyes are closed. Oh! it’s run down. I believe we’d be quite safe to unbind it. Just help me with this rope. Let it pass away quietly on the sofa. There is something pathetic even in the death of a doll.    (_They unbind WALTER and raise him, he opens his eyes and bounds upon   JACK--commotion._)  Confound it, it’s living again!    (_STELLA runs in room R., JACK runs in room L._)  WALTER (_as JACK looks in L., and STELLA looks in R._). I say! (_They at once withdraw._) Jack! Stella! (_Heads appear again._) I say! Jack! (_Heads disappear._) Come out, you bounder! (_Heads appear._) Why are you making such idiots of yourselves?  JACK (_coming in_). Who are you?  WALTER. Walter Everest.  JACK. The other fellow said that.  WALTER. I _am_ the other fellow.  JACK. Then I’ve let the automaton escape!  WALTER. Escape?  JACK. _It_ must be in the kitchen now!  WALTER. I have a particularly heavy poker in my room, I’ll just fetch it.  JACK. And then?  WALTER. We’ll see what then! (_Has gone into bedroom L._)  JACK. This _is_ a nice muddle! What asses we’ve been!  STELLA. Yes, haven’t we?  JACK. By Jove! we have.    (_AUTOMATON comes in D. in F., followed by MRS. ANDERSON with a   telegram--they both go quickly into drawing-room R._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_calling as she goes_). Telegrapheram, Mr. Everest, sir!  STELLA (_down L. with JACK points up to them as they go out_). Jack! look!    (_Piano is smashed off R._)  Oh, what’s that?  JACK. That’s the piano! (_Glass is smashed off R._) That’s the three gold-fish in the bowl!    (_WALTER with poker enters L._)  MRS. ANDERSON (_off_). Oh, help! (_She rushes in from R. in a fainting condition and gasps._) Mr. Everest have fell out of the window into the street!  WALTER. Mrs. Anderson, I am here.    (_She gives a loud yell of fright in his face and rushes into bedroom   L. STELLA hastens after her._)  WALTER. There’s going to be no mistake this time, I’m going after it myself. (_Exit D. in F._)    (_JOBBINS enters D. in F., his hat bashed, a black eye, and one arm   in a sling. He is in a miserable condition._)  JACK. Great goodness! Jobbins!  JOBBINS. What’s left of him, sir!  AUTOMATON (_off at back_). Yow-yow.  JOBBINS (_on his knees clings to JACK_). I calls on you to protect me!  JACK. We must search this house from top to toe. You chase up, I’ll chase down. And if we don’t find him, meet here.  JOBBINS. I’ll do that (_they go up_), meet here!    (_Exeunt._)  STELLA (_looks in L._). Jack, she’s getting better--Jack! where are you? (_Goes in again._)    (_JOBBINS enters D. in F., comes down, saying:_)  JOBBINS. Missed him! (_Sits L. of R. table_).

(_They release him._)  MRS. ANDERSON. There’s a telegrapheram, sir; is it for you or your twin?  JACK (_snatches it and reads_). From Mrs. Everest--“Potterfield fell out of his dogcart and broke his leg. The wedding is postponed.”  STELLA. Postponed!  JACK. Congratulate you, old chap (_shaking hands_). Your fortune’s safe.    (_Noise off and lights down as:_)  WALTER. Hush, hush! all of you. It’s coming out to die!    (_STELLA hides on floor front of sofa L. MRS. ANDERSON hides on   knees front of table R.

It then leans dying against   table, then has a fresh spasm, hurrying across to STELLA, who lies   away from it on floor to avoid it._)    (_Then up to cupboard door, which JACK set open with a chair.   AUTOMATON dies with back to inside of door, pushing the chair clear   of it in his spasm, business, finally shutting himself in as he   collapses by letting the door close after him._)    (_Red limes changing to green through above, and dark floats._)    (_Lights up--all rise._)  STELLA (_cries_). Walter! (_Music of “Caressante.”_)    (_WALTER comes out from behind curtain L. and down to STELLA C., takes   her in his arms._)  WALTER.
