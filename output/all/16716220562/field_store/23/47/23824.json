At this Sally picked up her ears and gave a little start to one side of the narrow road, dragging her mate along.  \"Whoa!  Steady there!\" cried Peleg Snuggers, and tried to pull the team in.  Failing in this He grabbed the brake handle and pushed it back vigorously.  He was so nervous that he gave the handle a mighty wrench, and in a twinkle the brake bar snapped off, close to the wheel.  Onward bounded the stage, hitting the team in the flanks, and away leaped both horses on a dead run!  \"The brake is broke!\"  \"Stop the team, Peleg, or they'll upset us sure!\"  \"Whoa, there, Jack!  Whoa, Sally!  Don't you know enough to stop?\"  Such were some of the cries which rang out.  Peleg Snuggers grasped the lines and pulled with might and main.  But then came an awful bump, and away flew the driver into a bush along the roadside, and the reins fell to the horses heels, scaring them worse than ever.  \"We are in for it!\" gasped Tom.  \"I don't see how we are going to stop them now.\"  \"The bridge!  The bridge across the gully!\" screamed another cadet, in terror-stricken tones.  \"They were mending it this morning. Supposing they haven't the new planking down?\"  \"There is the bridge!\" burst out another, pointing ahead.  \"Oh, Heavens, boys, we are lost!\"  All strained their eyes ahead to see what he meant, and then every face grew pale.  The bridge was torn up completely, not a single plank of the flooring remained.     CHAPTER II  SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS   The Rover boys were three in number, Dick being the oldest, Tom coming next, and Sam the youngest.  In their younger days they had resided with their parents in New York, but after the death of their mother and the disappearance of their father they had gone to live with their uncle, Randolph Rover, and their Aunt Martha, on a farm called Valley Brook, near the village of Dexter Corners, on the Swift River.  Those who have read the previous volumes of this series, entitled respectively, \"The Rover Boys at School.\" \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean,\" and \"The Rover Boys in the jungle,\" know that our three heroes had already passed through many trying experiences and thrilling adventures.  From home they had been sent to Putnam Hall, a military academy of high standing, and here they had made many friends, including those already mentioned, and several enemies, among the latter being one Dan Baxter, who was known as the school bully, and John Fenwick, better known as Mumps, the bully's toady. They had also made a bitter enemy of Josiah Crabtree, the headmaster of the Hall.  But since those first days at the school many things had happened and many changes had occurred.  It was discovered that Dan Baxter was the son of one Arnold Baxter, a rascal who had, years before, tried to swindle the Rover boys' father out of some valuable mining property in the West, and that the son was little better than his parent.  Dan had left the school in a hurry, and soon after this his father had been arrested in Albany for a daring office robbery, and was now in jail in consequence.  The disappearance of Dan, and Josiah Crabtree's yearning for wealth, had led to further complications.  Near Putnam Hall resides the widow Stanhope and her pretty daughter Dora, and Crabtree, who exerted a sort of hypnotic power over the widow, tried to get the lady to marry him, so that he might obtain the fortune she held in trust for her daughter.  But how the Rover boys fooled the grasping teacher, and how Dora was saved from the plot Crabtree and Dan Baxter hatched up against her, has already been told in \"The Rover Boys on the Ocean.\"  Anderson Rover had gone to Africa to locate certain mines in that country, and when many years passed and no word came from him the three boys grew worried and wanted to go in search of him.  At last came a strange letter written by a sea captain, containing some important information, and acting on this the Rover boys, accompanied by their Uncle Randolph, set out for the heart of the Dark Continent to find the long-lost.  On the way they fell in with one Alexander Pop, who had formerly been a waiter at Putnam Hall, who proved a valuable friend when it came to dealing with men of his own ebony hue.  In this hunt they likewise ran across Josiah Crabtree, who was out with an exploring party from Yale, and with Dan Baxter, and both of these rascals tried to do them much harm. But the schemes of the rascals fell through, and Crabtree only escaped after a severe whipping at the hands of Dick Rover, while Dan Baxter fared little better.  Soon after this Mr. Rover was found, as a prisoner of a savage African tribe, and rescued, and then the entire party returned to the United States.  Alexander Pop remained in the employ of the two elder Rovers, and the three boys returned to finish the term at Putnam Hall.  These are a few of the things that had happened.  But there were countless others, which space will not permit being mentioned here. There had been many contests, in baseball, football, and other sports, and jokes that seemed to have no end, and there had also been a disastrous fire, which none of the Putnam Hall cadets were likely ever to forget--a fire as thrilling as the scene now being enacted on the road.  But I am afraid I have already left the boys in the runaway stage too long, so we will return to them without further delay.  \"The bridge is down!\" The cry rang through the stage, bringing every cadet to his feet on the instant.  \"Don't jump!\" cried Dick, as he saw several preparing to leap. \"You will break your necks!\" For now the bushes were left behind, and on either side of the road were jagged rocks, covered here and there with withered vines.  As Dick spoke he pushed his way to the front of the stage and crawled out on the driver's seat.  \"The back--drop off at the back!\" came from Frank Harrington, and he showed how it could be done.  But the road was now rougher than ever, and he landed on his knees and his face, giving himself an ugly cut on the chin.  Dick was trying to reach the reins when Tom came down beside him.  \"Can you make it?\" asked Tom.  \"I can try,\" was the desperate answer.  \"If only we could block those wheels!\"  \"Block the wheels!\" came from half a dozen, and one boy, who happened to have a stout cane with him, thrust it out between several of the spokes of the wheel on the left, in the rear.  For an instant the stick held, then it snapped, and the wheel went around as before.  The bridge was now less than two hundred feet away, and whatever was to be accomplished must be done quickly.  At last Dick had the reins, and he began to pull upon them with all of his strength, at the same time calling upon Tom to hold him to the seat.  \"To the right--turn 'em to the right!\" sang out Sam, as he saw a narrow opening between the rocks.  \"Yes, the right!\" added Fred Garrison.  \"It is our only hope!\"  Dick did as requested, and at the last instant the heavy stage swung around.  There was a grinding and a splitting of wood as the front wheels met the rocks and went to pieces, and then Dick came down on the horses, with Tom on top of him--and the elder Rover knew no more.  \"Dick's hurt!\" gasped Sam, as he scrambled out of the side window of the turnout.  \"Don't let the horses kick him.\"  For the runaway team were struggling wildly, amid the rocks and the wreck of the harness.  But Tom was already up, and he and Larry Colby dragged Dick to a place of safety.  In the meantime some of the other cadets who were used to managing horseflesh took care of the team and led them away and tied them fast to a tree.  \"Dick, Dick! are you badly hurt?\" The question came from Tom, as he gazed anxiously into his brother's face.  There was a nasty cut on the left check from which the blood was flowing.  Dick did not answer, and Tom asked somebody to run down to the stream for some water.  When this was brought he and Sam bathed Dick's face, and presently the latter opened his eyes and stared around him in bewilderment.  \"A touchdown--I claim--\" he began, and then stopped.  \"Wha--what has happened?\" he stammered.  \"Oh, I remember now!\"  And he feel back again.  \"He thinks he's still in the football game,\" whispered Harry Blossom.  \"Oh, but he's a plucky one.\"  All of the other lads had been severely shaken up, but nobody had been hurt excepting Frank, as before mentioned.  Soon he came limping up, followed by Peleg Snuggers.  \"I missed it by jumping,\" he observed ruefully.  \"Hullo, is Dick knocked out?\"  \"So ye stopped 'em, eh?\" cried the general utility man.  \"It was prime plucky to do it, so it was!  Poor Dick, hope he ain't bad.\"  By this time Dick was opening his eyes once more, and this time he kept them open.  \"I--I--that was a nasty tumble, wasn't it?\" he muttered.  \"I'm glad I didn't go under the horses' feet.\"  \"How do you feel?\"  \"I guess I had the wind knocked out of me, that's all.\" He tried to get up, but his legs refused to support him.  \"I'll have to keep quiet awhile.\"  \"Yes, don't you move,\" said Sam.  \"We can't get across the stream anyway, now the bridge is down.  We'll have to go around to the other bridge.\"  \"It's queer the workmen didn't put up some sort of a sign as a warning,\" said Fred Garrison.  \"I believe they can be held liable for this disaster.\"  \"To be sure they can be held liable,\" burst out Peleg Snuggers.  \"But a sign wouldn't have kept the brake from breaking,\" said Tom.  \"True, lad, but ye must remember that it was their duty to put the sign up at the beginning of this road, which is on the top of the hill.  If the sign had been there we would never have started to come down this way.\"  \"Perhaps we missed the sign,\" put in another cadet.  \"Of dot is so, ve besser run pack und stop udder carriages from comin' dis vay,\" broke in Hans Mueller quickly.  \"Listen to dot!\"  They all listened, and heard merry cries of laughter and carriage wheels rapidly approaching.  \"A carriage--with ladies!\" gasped Sam.  \"Come on and stop them!\" And away he,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6071"],["title","The Rover Boys out West; Or, The Search for a Lost Mine (#2)"],["body","up the hill, as well as his short legs would carry him.  Hans, Larry, and several others followed.  They had barely gained the top of the hill when a large carryall belonging to John Laning appeared.  In the carryall were the farmer and his two charming daughters, and, Mrs. Stanhope, who was his sister-in-law, and her daughter Dora.  Mrs. Laning was also present, along with several neighbors.  \"Hi, whoa! stop!\" yelled Sam.  \"Stop!\"  \"Hurrah for Putnam Hall!\" cried Grace Laning, waving a tiny flag toward Sam, which made the younger Rover blush.  \"Glad to be able to congratulate you, Sam!\" said Dora Stanhope. \"Where are the other members of the football team?\"  \"Just ahead--down by the gully.  You mustn't drive down here, for the bridge is down.\"  \"Bridge down!\" ejaculated John Laning.  \"Darwell said he was going to mend it this week, but I saw no sign up at the cross-roads.\"  \"Neither did we, and we came near to going overboard.  As it is, we had a pretty bad smash up!\"  \"Indeed!\" came from Mrs. Stanhope, in alarm.  \"And was anybody hurt?\"  \"Dick was thrown out and knocked unconscious, and Frank Harrington had his chin cut, while the rest of us were pretty well shaken up. Peleg the driver was thrown into some brushwood and that most likely saved his life.\"  Mrs. Stanhope grew pale, for she remembered only too well that fateful ride she had once taken with Josiah Crabtree, which had almost cost both of them their lives.  \"I will go to the poor boy!\" she said, and leaped to the ground, followed by Dora and the two Laning girls.  Soon the carryall was led to the side of the road, and the others alighted, to see what damage had been done.     CHAPTER III  THE MISSING DANGER SIGNAL   When Sam came back he found Dick sitting on a rock with his cut plastered up from the out kit taken along to the football match. Frank had likewise been attended to.  \"I am so glad you are not hurt seriously,\" said Mrs. Stanhope, as she sat down beside Dick, with Dora close at hand.  \"All of you have had a very narrow escape.\"  \"It is a shame that no danger signal was display,\" said Dora. \"When they are fixing a bridge  they usually put a bar across the road with the sign: 'Danger!  Road Closed,' on it.\"  \"Exactly,\" put in Peleg.  \"But I haint seen no sign, an' that I can swear to.\"  \"In that case Contractor Darwell will be responsible for this smash up,\" said John Laning.  \"Are the horses hurt?\"  \"They are pretty well scratched up around the legs.\"  \"Humph!  And the two front wheels of the stage are a total wreck. I reckon it will take the best part of fifty dollars to fix matters up.\"  \"Anyway, I don't calculate as how I'm responsible,\" grumbled the general utility man, fearing he saw trouble ahead, when Captain Putnam should hear of the affair.  A creaking on the road was heard, and presently a lumber wagon hove into sight, piled high with the new planking for the bridge.  On the front sat Darwell the contractor and two of his workmen.  \"Hullo, what does all this mean?\" cried the contractor, as he brought his wagon to a standstill, and viewed the wrecked stage.  \"It means that Captain Putnam will have a little account to settle with you, Mr. Darwell,\" put in Harry Blossom promptly.  \"With me?  What for?\"  \"For this wreck.\"  \"And for this cut chin,\" added Frank.  \"And my being knocked out,\" said Dick.  \"I'm not responsible for any wreck,\" replied Joel Darwell.  \"I put up the bar with the danger signal on it, up at the cross-roads.\"  \"We didn't see no sign,\" interrupted Peleg Snuggers.  \"Not a bit of a sign.\"  \"There was no sign when I came along,\" said John Laning.  \"I put the sign up not over three hours ago,\" insisted Joel Darwell.  \"I can show you just where Sandy Long and I dug the post holes for it.\"  \"Then some rascal took the sign down,\" said Tom.  \"What for?\"  \"Must have done it to wreck the stage,\" answered Larry Colby.  \"But could anybody be so cold-blooded?\"  \"Yes, there are several people who would do that,\" answered Dick promptly.  \"But I don't think they are within a hundred miles of Cedarville just now.\"  \"You mean Dan Baxter for one,\" said Sam.  \"And Josiah Crabtree for another,\" put in Tom.  \"They are both down on everybody around here.\"  \"How about Mumps?\" asked Larry.  \"Oh, he reformed after that chase on the ocean, and I've heard he is now out West,\" said Sam.  \"There's another rascal, though--Mr. Arnold Baxter.  But he is in jail in Albany--he and that tool of his, Buddy Girk.\"  \"Well, certainly somebody is responsible,\" said Frank.  \"Supposing we go back and try to find some clew?\"  \"And find the danger sign and put it up again,\" said Joel Darwell.  A dozen of the boys went back, and with them Tom and Sam, leaving Dick with the Stanhopes.  As soon as the crowd had left, Dora Stanhope motioned the elder Rover to one side.  \"Oh, Dick, it makes me shiver to hear Josiah Crabtree spoken of,\" she said in a whisper.  \"Why, Dora, you don't mean to say that he has turned up again?\" he questioned quickly.  \"No--but--but--last night I heard a strange noise on our side porch, as if somebody was trying the side window.  I went to the door and asked to know who was there.  At once I heard somebody or some animal leave the porch and climb over the side fence of the garden.  I am almost certain it was some person trying to get into the house.\"  \"Did you tell your mother?\"  \"No, she had one of her nervous headaches, and I thought it would do no good.  But I couldn't sleep all night, and I laid with a big stick in one hand and papa's old revolver in the other.  The revolver wasn't loaded, but I thought I might scare somebody with it.\"  \"The revolver ought to be loaded, Dora.  Do you know what caliber it is?\"  \"No; you know I know little or nothing about firearms.\"  \"Then I'll find out for you, and get some cartridges.  If Josiah Crabtree is around you ought to shoot him on the spot.\"  \"Oh, I couldn't do that--even though I do know how dreadfully he treated you while you were in the heart of Africa.\"  \"You must be very careful of your movements, especially after dark. Crabtree may be around, with some new scheme against you or your mother.  I wish he could have been left behind in Africa.\"  \"Oh, so do I! but he and Dan Baxter both came back to America, didn't they?\"  \"So we heard in Boma.  But don't get worked up too much, Dora, for it might have been only a cat,--or a common tramp looking for something to eat.  We have had lots of tramps around the Hall lately.\"  \"I have asked Grace Laning to pay us a visit, and she is coming over to-morrow.\"  \"Then you will have somebody in the house besides your mother and yourself.  I wish I could stay with you folks.\"  \"How long are you going to remain at the Hall, Dick?  When you came back you said something about going out West with your father to look up that mining claim in Colorado.\"  \"We shan't start for the West until next spring.  Father was going right away at first, but after he found out that Arnold Baxter was safe in jail and couldn't bother him any more, he concluded to remain with Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha until next spring so as to give himself the chance to get back his old-time strength.  His sufferings in Africa pulled him down a good bit.\"  \"I suppose.  Well, I am glad you will be around during the winter. Next summer mamma has promised to go with me on a trip to Buffalo and then around the Great Lakes.  I trust the lake air will do her much good, and that we won't hear or see anything of Mr. Crabtree while we are on the water.\"  \"I'd like to go with you on that trip,\" answered Dick.  \"I have no doubt you will have a grand time.\"  Little did he dream of all the perils that trip was to lead to, and of how he and his brothers would be mixed up in them.  In the meantime the others had journeyed up the hill to where the road branched off in three directions.  At this point Joel Darwell pointed out two newly-made holes in the earth, about fifteen feet apart.  \"See them?\" he cried.  \"Well, that is where I placed the danger sign, and I am willing to swear to it.\"  \"And so am I,\" added the workman who was along.  \"Well, there is no danger signal here now,\" returned Tom, glancing around.  Some bushes torn up beside the road attracted his attention, and he hurried toward them.  \"Here you are!\"  He pointed to a cleared spot behind the bushes and there, on the ground, lay the torn-up posts and boards.  Evidently somebody had dragged them thither in great haste.  \"It's the work of some thorough rascal!\" cried Sam.  \"Somebody who meant mischief to our stage.\"  \"Maype dis vos der vork of dem Pornell Academy fellers,\" suggested Hans.  \"No, they are gentlemen, not scoundrels,\" replied Tom.  \"They may feel cut up, but they wouldn't play such a dastardly trick as this.\"  The spot was one commanding a good view of the back road, so that anybody standing there could have seen the stage coming while it was still a quarter of a mile off.  All hands began a search for some clew leading to the identity of the evil-doers--that is, all but Joel Darwell and his helper. These two dragged the posts and boards into position again, and this time set them down so firmly that a removal would be out of the question without tools.  \"Hullo, here's something!\" cried one of the cadets presently.  \"Did you just drop this, Tom?\"  As he spoke he held up a round, flat coin of coppery metal, engraved with several circles and a rude head.  \"No, I didn't drop it,\" replied Tom, his face growing serious. \"Did you, Sam?\"  Sam gave a look, placed his hand in his pocket and brought out a similar piece.  \"No, there is mine,\" he said.  \"Where in the world did that come from?\"  Then Tom and Sam looked at each other.  The same idea crossed the mind of each.  The coin was similar to those they had handled while on their way through Africa.  They had brought home several as pocket-pieces.  \"I'll wager Dan Baxter dropped that!\" cried Tom.  \"He, or--\"  \"Josiah Crabtree!\" finished Sam.  \"Yes, I am sure of it, for Dick"]]]
