Good night, Mr. Daniels.”  “You did right, Walter,” said Gates. “It is a bad thing to run up bills.”  “Especially when you are poor. It seems odd to be poor.”  “I am used to it, Walter. You don't seem very sad over it.”  “I am not. That is what puzzles me. I really begin to think I like it.”     CHAPTER VI  TRUE FRIEND AND FALSE   A college community is for the most part democratic. A poor student with talent is quite as likely to be a favorite as the heir to a fortune, often more so. But there are always some snobs who care more for dollars than sense. So Walter was destined to find out, for he made no secret of his loss of fortune. Most of his college friends sympathized with him, but there was one who proved unreliable.  This was Harvey Warner, the son of a man who had made a fortune during the Civil War, some said as a sutler. Harvey professed to be very aristocratic, and had paid especial attention to Walter, because he, too, had the reputation of being wealthy. He had invited Walter to pass a couple of weeks at the summer residence of the Warners, near Lake George. This, however, was before he had heard of Walter's loss of fortune. As soon as he learned this, he decided that the invitation must be withdrawn. This would be awkward, as he had been on very intimate terms with our hero, and had been a guest at the banquet.  Not foreseeing the effect of his changed circumstances on the mind of his late friend, Walter, meeting him on the campus the day afterward, called out, familiarly: “How are you, old fellow? Why didn't you come round to my room last evening?”  “I had another engagement, Sherwood,” answered Warner, stiffly.  “You ought to give me the preference,” said Walter, not observing the other's change of manner.  “Ahem! a man must judge for himself, you know. By the way, is it true that you have lost all your money?”  “I don't know how much I have lost, but I am not coming back to college next year.”  “You are in hard luck,” said Warner coldly. “By the way, I think we shall have to give up that plan for the summer.”  “What plan?”  “Why, you know I invited you to visit me at Lake George.”  Walter began to comprehend.  “Why, are you not going to be there?” he asked,  “Yes, but the house will be full of other fellows, don't you know.”  “So that there will be no room for me,” said Walter calmly, looking Warner full in the face.  “Awfully sorry, and all that sort of thing,” drawled Warner. “Besides, I suppose you will have to go to work.”  “Yes, I expect to go to work--after awhile. Probably I shall take a few weeks for rest. By the way, when did you find out that your home would be full--of other fellows?”  “Got a letter from my sister this morning. Besides--in your changed circumstances, don't you know, you might find it awkward to be living in a style you couldn't keep up.”  “Thank you, Warner. You are very considerate. I really didn't give you credit for so much consideration.”  “Don't mention it! Of course with your good sense you understand?”  “I think I do.”  “And, by the way, I believe you borrowed two dollars of me last week. If it is inconvenient for you to pay the whole at once, you might hand me a dollar.”  “And I called that fellow my friend!” said Walter to himself.  “You are very considerate again, but I think I would rather pay the whole at once. Can you change a ten?”  Harvey Warner looked surprised. He had jumped to the conclusion that Walter was the next thing to a pauper, and here he was better supplied with money than himself.  “I am not sure that I have as much money here,” he said.  “Then come with me to the drug-store; I am going to buy a bottle of tooth-wash, and will change the bill there.”  Warner accepted this proposal.  “I'd better make sure of my money while he has it,” he reflected.  “I hope you're not very much disappointed about the visit?” he said.  “Not at all! I should have had to decline. I have been invited to spend a month at the Adirondacks with Frank Clifford.”  “You don't mean it!” ejaculated Warner enviously.  Clifford was a member of an old family, and an invitation from him was felt to confer distinction. Warner himself would have given a good deal to be on sufficiently intimate terms to receive such a compliment.  “When did he invite you?” he asked suggestively.  Walter saw what was in his mind, and answered, with a smile:  “He invited me this morning.”  “Had he heard--”  “Of my loss of fortune? Oh, yes! But why should that make any difference?”  “I wouldn't go, if I were you.”  “Why not?”  “You are going to be a poor man.”  “I don't know about that.”  “You are poor now, at any rate.”  “Well, perhaps so, but am I any the worse for that?”  “I thought you would understand my meaning.”  “I do, but I am glad that all my friends don't attach the importance you do to the possession of fortune. Good morning!”  “I suppose it's the way of the world!” thought Walter, as his quondam friend left him. “But, thank Heaven, all are not mercenary! I've got a few friends left, anyhow.”  A few rods farther on he met Victor Creswell, perhaps the richest student in the junior class.  “What's this I hear, Walter?” he asked. “Have you lost your money?”  “Some of it, I believe.”  “And you are not coming back to college?”  “I shall stay out a year. Perhaps I can come back then.”  “You needn't leave at all. My governor allows me a hundred dollars a month for my own use--spending money, you know. I'll give you half of it, if that will enable you to pull through.”  Walter was touched.  “You are a friend worth having, Creswell,” he said. “But I really think I shall enjoy being out of college for a year. I shall find out what is in me. But I sha'n't forget your generous offer.”  “Better accept it, Sherwood. I can get along well enough on fifty dollars a month.”  “I won't accept it for myself, but I'll tell you something. My chum, Gates, is very hard pushed. You know he depends wholly on himself, and twenty-five dollars just at this time would be a godsend to him. He is worried about paying his bills. If, now, you would transfer a little at your generosity to him--”  “I don't know him very well, but if you speak well of him that is enough. I shall be glad to help him. Let me see how much I can spare.”  He drew out a wallet, and from it four ten dollar bills.  “Here are forty dollars,” he said. “Give them to him, but don't let him know where they came from.”  “Creswell, you're a trump!” said Walter, shaking his hand vigorously. “You don't know how happy you will make him.”  “Oh, that's all right. But I'm sorry you won't let me do something for you.”  “I will if I need it.”  “Good!” said Creswell, in a tone of satisfaction. “Now, mind, you don't hesitate.”  Walter, happy in the happiness he was going to confer, made his way quickly to his own room. Gates sat at the table with a troubled brow, writing some figures on a piece of paper.  “What are you about, Gates?” asked his chum.  “I have been thinking.” said Gates wearily, “that perhaps I ought to do what you have decided to do.”  “What's that?”  “Leave college.  “But why?”  “I am so troubled to pay my bills. I wrote to my uncle last week--he is a well-to-do farmer--asking him if he wouldn't send me fifteen dollars to help pay my term bills. I promised to come and help him in the farm work during July.”  “What does he say?” asked Walter, smiling, Gates couldn't understand why.  “That he never pays for work in advance--he doesn't approve of it.”  “He could afford it?”  “Oh, yes; he's got a good sum in the savings-bank, but he is a very cautious man. I don't see how I'm going to get through. Perhaps I had better take a year away from college.”  “There is no need of that. I have some money here for you.”  “Some money for me?”  “Yes,” and Walter placed four ten-dollar bills on the table.  “But, Walter, you are in no position to lend me money.”  “True; the money doesn't come from me.”  “But who besides you would do me such a great favor?”  “One of the rich fellows in college--no, I can't tell you his name. You can take it without hesitation.”  “But it must have been to you that he lent it.”  “No, he understands that it is to be given to you. Will it help you?”  “Will it help me? It will carry me through gloriously,” and Gates was radiant with pleasure.  “Are you going to leave college now?”  “No; this help is providential. I will never be distrustful again.”  “I wish Creswell could see how much happiness his gift has brought with it,” thought Walter.     CHAPTER VII  WALTER'S EXPERIMENT BEGINS   After a conference between Walter and his guardian it was decided that he should wait till the first of September before seeking for any business position. Walter, who was somewhat impulsive, was disposed to start at once, but Doctor Mack said: “No, you are entitled to a vacation. When your class resumes study at Euclid, it will be time for you to begin to earn your living.”  “I am not sure that I deserve a vacation,” said Walter frankly. “I have not studied as hard at I ought.”  “Very probably. You have not been in earnest. You are a year older now, and you have a better understanding of your position.”  “You are very charitable, my dear guardian,” said Walter.  Doctor Mack smiled.  “I am quite aware,” he said, “that old heads are not often to be found on young shoulders.”  “Then you think it will be right for me to enjoy myself this summer?”  “I want you to do so.”  “One of my college friends, Frank Clifford, has invited me to pass a month with him in the Adirondacks. The Cliffords have a lodge not far from Blue Mountain Lake. Frank's mother and sisters will be abroad, and he wants me to keep him company.”  “I can think of no objection. How shall you spend your time?”  “In hunting and fishing. There are splendid chances for both up there, so Clifford says.”  “Go and have your good time. When you come back we will talk of your future plans.”  Walter's stay was prolonged to eight weeks, and when he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5993"],["title","Walter Sherwood's Probation (#5)"],["body","it was already nearing the end of August. He was browned by exposure, and looked the picture of health.  “Now I am ready to go to work, Doctor Mack,” he said. “Have you any plans for me?”  “How would you like to go into a drug-store? I have a college classmate who is a very successful druggist in Syracuse.”  Walter shrugged his shoulders.  “I don't believe I have a taste for making pills,” he said.  “I thought not. What do you think of entering a dry-goods store? I am acquainted with the head of a prominent establishment in New York.”  “It is a very respectable position, but I should feel cabined, cribbed, confined in it.”  “I am at the end of my tether. Have you formed any plans of your own?”  “Well, not exactly.”  “But you have thought somewhat on the subject?”  “Yes,” answered Walter.  “If at all possible, I shall let you have your own way.”  “You may think me foolish,” said Walter hesitatingly.  “I don't know. Let me hear what you have to propose.”  “I thought,” said Walter eagerly, “I would like to go out West.”  “What would you do when you got there?”  “There must be lots of things to do.”  “Very likely. You might buy an ax and clear the virgin forests.”  “I am afraid I wouldn't be a success at that.”  “You have no definite idea as to what you would do?”  “No. I could tell better when I got out there.”  “Now, about the expense. How much money would you need? You would require to live till you begin to earn something.”  “How much will it cost me to get to Chicago?”  “Say about twenty-five dollars.”  “I think, guardian, if you will advance me a hundred dollars, that will be sufficient.”  “For how long a time?”  “For a year. You see, I expect to earn my own living by the time I have spent fifty dollars in all. I should go to a cheap boarding-place, of course. I should be able to pay my way.”  “You will be content, then, with a hundred dollars, Walter?”  “Yes; perhaps I could make it do on less.”  “No; you shall have a hundred. If absolutely necessary, you can send for more.”  “No,” said Walter confidently; “I won't do that. I shall get along somehow. I want to make a man of myself.”  “That is a commendable ambition. Still, sometimes a young man finds it hard to obtain employment. If you had a trade, now, it might be different. Suppose, for instance, you were a journeyman tailor, you could readily find a place in Chicago or any good-sized city.”  “I shouldn't care to be a tailor.”  “I shouldn't care to employ you if you were,” said his guardian, smiling. “One thing I would like to guard you against. Don't be too particular about what you take up. With so small an outfit as you have stipulated for, you will have to go to work at something soon. Then, again, you won't be able to live as well as you have been accustomed to do here and in college.”  “I understand that, and am prepared for it. I want to rough it.”  “Possibly you will have your wish granted. I don't want to discourage you, Walter. I only want to prepare you for what may, and probably will, come.”  “Do you know any one in Chicago, Doctor Mack? I might find it pleasant to have an acquaintance.”  “Yes, I know a retired merchant named Archer. He lives on Indiana Avenue. I don't remember the number, but you can easily find his name in the directory. His name is Allen Archer.”  Walter noted the name in a new memorandum book which he had purchased.  “Where would you advise me to put up on my arrival in Chicago?” he asked.  “There are several good houses--the Sherman, Tremont, Palmer House; but they will be beyond your means. Indeed, any hotel will be. Still you might go to some good house for a day. That will give you time to hunt up a modest boarding-house.”  “An excellent plan!” said Walter, in a tone of satisfaction. “Do you know, my dear guardian, I shall go out in the best of spirits. I feel--in Shakespeare's words--that the world is mine oyster.”  “I hope you will be able to open it, Walter. You have my best wishes. Don't forget that you will have to depend on yourself.”  “I won't forget it. I wish it was time for me to start.”  “It will come soon enough. You had better get out your clothes, and get them mended, if necessary, and put in order. Nancy will do all she can for you, and the tailor will do the rest. Better not take much with you. When you get settled I will forward your trunk by express.”  When Nancy Sprague heard of Walter's plans she was much disturbed.  “Oh, Master Walter,” she said, in a tragic tone, “is it true that you've lost all your money and have got to go out into the cold world to make a living?”  “I believe I have lost some money, Nancy, but I rather like the idea of working for my living.”  “Oh, you poor child, you little know what it is. I can't bear to think of it. I can't see how Doctor Mack can let you go.”  “I should be very sorry if he refused. It isn't so bad, to work for a living. Haven't you always done it?”  “Yes, but that's different. I was always poor, and I am used to it.”  “I'm going to get used to it.”  “Walter--don't tell your guardian what I am saying--but I've got two hundred dollars in the savings bank, and I shall be very glad to give you some of it. You will take it, now, won't you? I can get it out to-morrow.”  “Nancy, you are a true friend,” said Walter, really moved by the unselfish devotion of the house-keeper; “but I sha'n't need it. I shall take a hundred dollars with me, and long before it is gone I shall be earning my living.”  “You'll send for it if you need it?”  “Yes; if I find I am very hard up, and there is no other way, I will send for it.”  Nancy brightened up, much pleased and relieved by this assurance.  “I couldn't bear to think of your suffering for a meal of victuals when we have so much in the house. I don't see why you can't stay at home and get a place in the village.”  Walter laughed.  “It wouldn't suit me at all, Nancy. I am going West to grow up with the country.”  “I wish I could be somewhere near, to look after you.”  “It would be of no use, Nancy. Women are in great demand out there--at any rate in Dakota--and you'd be married in less than no time, if you went.”  “You are only joking now, Master Walter.”  “Not at all! I read the other day that of ten schoolma'ams who went out to Dakota last fall, eight were married within three months.”  “Nobody could marry me against my will,” said Nancy resolutely.  “Perhaps he would find a way of overcoming your objections,” said Walter, laughing. “But I am afraid Doctor Mack couldn't do without you. He couldn't spare you and me both.”  “That's true,” assented Nancy, who had not been so much alarmed at the matrimonial dangers hinted at by Walter as might have been anticipated. Had a good opportunity offered, I am inclined to think Nancy would have been willing to change her name. After all, she was only forty-nine, and I have known more than one to surrender single blessedness with all its charms at and beyond that age.  At last the day of departure came. Valise in hand, Walter jumped aboard the stage that was to convey him to the railroad-station. He shook hands with his guardian and Nancy, the driver whipped up his horses, and a new period in Walter's life had commenced.  “I wonder how he'll come out?” mused Doctor Mack thoughtfully. “Have I acted for the best in letting him go? Well, time alone can tell.”     CHAPTER VIII  WALTER BUYS A WATCH   Walter was tempted to stop over at Niagara, as his ticket would have allowed him to do, but he was also very anxious to reach Chicago and get to work. “I can visit Niagara some other time,” he reflected. “Now I can spare neither the money nor the time.”  Hour after hour sped by, until with a little thrill of excitement Walter learned by consulting his railroad guide that he was within fifty miles of Chicago. He looked out of the car window, and surveyed with interest the country through which they were speeding at the rate of thirty-five miles an hour. His attention was drawn from the panorama outside by a voice:  “Is this seat engaged?”  Walter looked up, and his glance rested on a man of perhaps thirty-five, dressed in a light suit, and wearing a tall white hat.  “No, sir,” answered Walter politely, removing his gripsack from the seat.  “I don't want to incommode you,” said the stranger, as he took the place thus vacated.  “You don't in the least,” said Walter.  “I suppose you are going to Chicago?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Are you going farther--out to Dakota, for instance?”  “No, sir. Chicago is far enough west for me at present.”  “I live in Dakota. I have a long journey to make after we reach Chicago.”  “I don't know about Dakota. Is it a good place for business?”  “It is going to be. Yes, Dakota has a bright future. I have a pleasant little home out there. I had to go East on business, and stayed a little longer than I intended. In fact I spent more money than I anticipated, and that makes me a little short.”  It struck Walter that his new acquaintance for a stranger was very confidential.  “Is it possible he will propose to borrow money of me?” he asked himself. He did not quite know what to say, but politeness required him to say something.  “I am sorry,” he replied, in a sympathizing tone.  “I should like to take a train this evening for my home,” continued the stranger.  “I hope you will be able to do so.”  “Well, there's one drawback. I haven't got money enough to buy a through ticket. Under these circumstances I am going to offer you a bargain.”  Walter looked surprised and expectant. The stranger drew a gold watch from his pocket--a very handsome gold watch, which looked valuable.  “You see that watch?” he said. “How much do you think it is worth?”  “It looks like a nice watch. I am no judge of values.”  “It cost me ninety dollars six months since. Now I need the money, and I will sell it to you for twenty-five.”  “But that would be a great sacrifice.”  “So it would, but I need the money. Of course, if you haven't got the money--”  “I have that amount of money,” said Walter, “but I"]]]
