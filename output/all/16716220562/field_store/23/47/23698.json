I might need it.”  “Then all you need to do is to sell the watch or pawn it. You could sell it for fifty dollars without trouble.”  “Why don't you do that?” asked Walter shrewdly.  “Because I haven't the time. I want, if possible, to go on to-night. If you had a wife and two children waiting for you, whom you had not seen for two months, you wouldn't mind losing a few dollars for the sake of seeing them a little sooner.”  “Very likely,” answered Walter, to whom his companion's explanation seemed plausible.  Walter was tempted, but he reflected that twenty-five dollars represented a third of the money he had with him, so he put away the temptation, but with reluctance. He had a silver watch, bought for him, when he entered college, at a cost of fifteen dollars, and like the majority of boys of his age he felt that he should much prefer to carry a gold one. Still he must be prudent.  “No,” he said, shaking his head, “I don't think I had better buy the watch. I presume you will find some one else on the train who would be glad of the bargain.”  “Very likely, but we are near Chicago, and I haven't time to look around. Come, I'll make you a still better offer, though I ought not to do so. You may have the watch for twenty dollars. That money will get me through, and I won't haggle about five dollars.”  “Twenty dollars!” repeated Walter thoughtfully.  “Yes, look at the watch. Isn't it a beauty?”  “Yes; I like the appearance of it very much.”  “If you get out of money, you can easily pawn it for more than the sum I ask for it.”  Certainly this was an important consideration. Walter felt that he would be foolish to lose so good a chance. It was a pity that the stranger should be forced to make such a sacrifice, yet it really seemed that he would be doing him a favor, as well as benefiting himself, by accepting his proposition.  “You will guarantee it to be solid gold?” he said, with momentary suspicion.  “Certainly. You will see that it is an Elgin watch. Of course you know the reputation of that make. They don't make any sham watches at their factory.”  “I thought the case might be gilt,” said Walter, half ashamed of his suspicions.  “You do well to be cautious, but I will guarantee the watch to be all I represent it. I only wish you were a jeweler. Then you could judge for yourself.”  It sounded very plausible. Then, the watch was a very handsome one.  “Let me open it and show you the works.”  The stranger did so. Walter was no judge of the mechanism of a watch, but what he saw impressed him favorably. The stranger seemed very frank and fair-spoken. Walter knew, of course, that in traveling one was likely to meet with sharpers, but that did not justify him in suspecting everybody he met.  “It would look very nice at the end of my chain,” he thought. “I suppose I cannot afford it; but, as he says, I can raise money on it at any time.”  “Well, young man, what is your decision? You must excuse me for hurrying, but we are not far from Chicago, and I want to make sure that I can continue my journey to-night. I shall telegraph to my wife that I am coming.”  “I will take the watch,” said Walter. “There doesn't seem to be much risk in doing so.”  “Bosh! I should say not. Young man, I congratulate you. You have made the best bargain of your life. Have you got the money handy?”  Walter took out two ten-dollar bills and handed them to his companion, receiving the watch in exchange.  “Well, that settles my mind,” said the stranger, in a tone of satisfaction. “I shall see the old woman and the kids very soon, thanks to your kindness.”  “Don't mention it,” said Walter complacently. “I feel indebted to you, rather, as you have given me much more than an equivalent for my money.”  “That is true, but under present circumstances money is worth a good deal to me. Now, if you don't mind I will go into the smoking-car and have a little smoke before we arrive. Will you join me?”  “No, sir, thank you; I don't smoke.”  “Good-day, then. Hope we shall meet again.”  Walter responded politely, and the stranger, rising, walked forward to the front part of the car and disappeared.  Walter detached the silver watch from the plated chain to which it was attached, substituted the new gold watch, and put the silver watch in his pocket. It occurred to him that if he should really need money it might be better for him to sell the silver watch and retain the gold one.  “I have made thirty dollars at the very least on my purchase,” he reflected, “for I am sure I can sell the watch for fifty dollars if I wish to do so. This is a white day for me, as the Romans used to say. I accept it as a good omen of success. I wish Doctor Mack and Nancy were here to see it. I think the doctor would give me credit for a little shrewdness.”  The car sped on perhaps a dozen miles farther, when the door opened and the conductor entered, followed by a stout man of perhaps fifty years of age, who looked flushed and excited.  “This gentleman has been robbed of his gold watch,” explained the conductor. “He is convinced that some one on the train has taken it. Of course, no one of you is suspected, but I will trouble you to show me your watches.”  As Walter heard these words a terrible fear assailed him. Had he bought a stolen watch?     CHAPTER IX  AN INGENIOUS SCHEME   The passengers, though somewhat surprised, generally showed their watches with a good grace. One old man produced a silver watch fifty years old.  “That watch belonged to my grandfather,” he said. “You don't claim that, do you?”  “Wouldn't take it as a gift,” said the loser crustily.  “You couldn't get it in exchange for yours!” retorted the owner.  Presently they came to Walter. If he had not attached the gold watch to his chain, instead of his old silver one, he would have been tempted to leave it in his pocket and produce the less valuable one. But he was saved from the temptation, as this would now have been impossible. Besides, had the gold watch been found on him afterward it would have looked very suspicious.  “Well, youngster,” said the stout man, “show us your watch.”  With a flushed face and an uneasy feeling Walter drew out the gold timepiece.  “Is that your watch?” he said.  “Yes!” almost shouted the stout passenger, fiercely. “So you are the thief?”  “No, sir,” answered Walter, pale but firm. “I am not the thief.”  “Where did you get it, then?”  “I bought it.”  “You bought it? That's a likely story.”  “Why, it was taken from me this very afternoon.”  “That may be, but I bought it, all the same.”  The owner was about to protest, when the conductor said quietly: “Listen to the young fellow's explanation.”  Walter proceeded:  “A man came to my seat and told me he wanted to raise enough money to get to Dakota. He offered me the watch for twenty-five dollars, though he said it cost him ninety six months ago.”  “And you paid him twenty-five dollars?”  “No; I had no money to spare, but when he offered it for twenty, and told me I could more than get my money back either by pawning or selling it, I made up my mind to purchase, and did so.”  “Where is this man?” asked the conductor.  “He said he was going into the smoking-car.”  “That's a likely story,” sneered the stout gentleman.  “Do you charge me with taking the watch?” demanded Walter hotly. “I have never left this car. Have you seen me before?”  “No; but you are probably a confederate of the man from whom you got it. But I am not sure if there was any such man.”  “I will describe him,” said Walter.  As he did so, the conductor said: “There was such a man on the train. He got off at the last station.”  “I don't know anything about that,” said the claimant; “but I'll trouble you, young man, for that watch.”  “Will you return me the twenty dollars I gave for it?” asked Walter.  “Of course not. I don't propose to buy back my own watch.”  An elderly gentleman who sat just behind Walter spoke up here.  “It is rather hard on the boy,” he said. “I can confirm his story about the purchase of the watch. I heard the bargaining and saw the purchase-money paid.”  “That makes no difference to me,” said the claimant. “I've identified the watch and I want it.”  Walter removed it from his chain and was about to hand it to the claimant, when a quiet-looking man, dressed in a drab suit, rose from a seat farther down the car and came forward. He was a small man, not over five feet five inches in height, and he would not have weighed over one hundred and twenty pounds, but there was a look of authority on his face and an accent of command in his voice.  “You needn't give up the watch, my boy,” he said.  Walter drew back his hand and turned round in surprise. The claimant uttered an angry exclamation, and said testily: “By what right do you interfere?”  “The watch isn't yours,” said the small man nonchalantly.  “It isn't, hey? Well, of all the impertinent--”  “Stop there, Jim Beckwith! You see I know you”--as the stout man turned pale and clutched at the side of the seat.  “Who are you?” he demanded hoarsely.  “Detective Green!”  The claimant lost all his braggadocio air, and stared at the detective with a terrified look.  “That isn't my name,” he managed to ejaculate.  “Very likely not,” said the detective calmly, “but it is one of your names. It is a very clever game that you and your confederate are playing. He sells the watch, and you demand it, claiming that it has been stolen from you. I was present when the watch was sold, and the reason I did not interfere was because I was waiting for the sequel. How many times have you played this game?”  “There's some mistake,” gasped the other.  “Perhaps so, but I have some doubts whether you came by it honestly.”  “I assure you it is my watch,” cried the other, uneasily.  “How much did you pay for it, young man?” asked the detective.  “Twenty dollars.”  “Very well, sir; give the boy twenty dollars, and I shall advise him to give the watch back to you, as it may be stolen property, which he would not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5993"],["title","Walter Sherwood's Probation (#7)"],["body","to have found in his possession.”  “But that will be paying twenty dollars for my own property. It was not to me he paid the money.”  “You will have to look to your confederate for that. I am not sure but I ought to make you give twenty-five dollars.”  This hint led to the stout man's hastily producing two ten-dollar bills, which he tendered to Walter.  “It's an outrage,” he said, “making a man pay for his own property!”  “Are you sure that your statements in regard to this man are true?”  asked an important-looking individual on the opposite side of the car. “To my mind your interference is unwarrantable, not to say outrageous. Justice has been trampled upon.”  The detective looked round sharply.  “Do you know the man?” he asked.  “No.”  “Well, I do. I first made his acquaintance at Joliet prison, where he served a term of years for robbing a bank. Is that true or not, Jim Beckwith?”  The man known as Beckwith had already started to leave the car, but, although he heard the question, he didn't come back to answer it.  “I generally know what I'm about,” continued the detective, pointedly, “as those who are unwise enough to criticise my actions find out, sooner or later.”  The important gentleman did not reply, but covered his confusion by appearing to be absorbed in a daily paper, which he held up before his face.  “You let him off easy,” said the gentleman in the rear seat. “You allowed him to take the watch. I was surprised at that.”  “Yes; for, strange as it may seem, it was probably his, though the money with which he bought it may have been stolen. That watch has been probably sold a dozen times and recovered the same way. Were it a stolen watch, the risk would be too great. As it is I had no pretext for arresting him.”  “Was it really a ninety-dollar watch?” asked Walter, with interest.  “No. I know something about watches, as I find the knowledge useful in my official capacity. The watch would be a fair bargain at forty-five dollars, but it is showy, and would readily be taken for one worth seventy-five or even ninety dollars.”  “I shouldn't think the trick would pay,” said the gentleman in the rear seat.  “Why not?”  “Twenty dollars isn't a large sum to be divided between two persons, especially when there's money to be paid for car fare.”  “Sometimes the watch is sold for more--generally, I fancy--but the price was reduced because the purchaser was a boy. Besides, these men doubtless have other ways of making money. They are well-known confidence men. If I hadn't been on board the train our young friend would have lost his twenty dollars.”  “It would have been a great loss to me,” said Walter. “I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Green.”  “Ah, you remember my name. Let me give you my card. Some time you may get into difficulty and want to consult me. Boys of your age are not a match for an experienced swindler.”  He handed Walter a card bearing the name:  SILAS GREEN, 97 H Street.  Walter put it into his pocket with a polite expression of thanks.  Meanwhile, of course, the cars were steadily approaching Chicago. At length they entered the great Union Depot, and with the rest of the passengers Walter alighted carrying his valise in his hand.  A few feet in front of him walked Jim Beckwith, but Walter did not care to join him. He half turned, and as his glance fell on Walter he said, with a scowl: “If you ever meet me again you'll know me.”  “Yes, I shall!” answered Walter, with emphasis.     CHAPTER X  AT THE INDIANA HOUSE   Walter paused before a modest hotel on Monroe Street--we will call it the Indiana House--and, entering, went up to the desk and inquired the rates of board.  “Are you commercial?” asked the clerk.  “Not at present, sir.”  “We make special terms for commercial travelers. We will give you a small room on the third floor for one dollar and a half a day.”  This was as cheap as Walter expected to find it at a hotel, and he signified his acceptance.  “Front!” called the clerk.  A red-haired boy about Walter's age came forward.  “Take this young man up to No. 36,” said the clerk.  “Yessir,” answered the bell-boy, pronouncing the two words in one.  There was no elevator in the house, and Walter followed the boy up two flights of stairs to the third landing. The boy opened the door of a room with a small window looking out into an inner court.  “Here you are!” he said, and he put the valise on the floor.  “Thank you,” said Walter.  As he spoke he drew a dime from his vest pocket and deposited it in the hand of the red-haired attendant.  The effect was magical. The bell-boy's listless manner vanished, his dull face lighted up, and his manner became brisk.  “Thank you, sir. Is there anything you want? If you do, I'll get it for you.”  Walter looked about him. Soap, water, towels--all were in sight.  “Not just now,” he answered, “but I am going to take a wash, and shall probably use up all the water. Some time this evening you may bring me some more.”  “All right, sir. Just you ring when you want it.”  He went off, and Walter was left alone. First, he took a thorough wash, which refreshed him very much after his long and dusty ride. Then he changed his linen, brushed his clothes with a hand-brush he had brought in his valise and carefully combed his hair.  “I feel a hundred per cent. better,” he soliloquized. “Here I am in Chicago and now the battle of life is to begin.”  Walter was sanguine and full of hope. His life had always been easy, and he did not know what it was to work for a living. Besides, the fact may as well be told--he had a very comfortable opinion of his own abilities. He felt that he was no common boy. Was he not a sophomore, or rather a junior-elect, of Euclid college? Did he not possess a knowledge more or less extensive of Latin, Greek and mathematics, with a smattering of French and German, not to speak of logic, rhetoric, etc.? For one of his age he considered himself quite accomplished, and he persuaded himself that the world would receive him at his own estimate. It would be very strange if he could not earn a living, when hundreds and thousands of his age, without a tithe of his knowledge, managed to live.  Walter went downstairs, and, as it would not be supper-time for two hours, went out to walk. He wanted to get some idea of the busy city which was for a time at least, to be his home. He walked through Monroe Street until he reached State. At the corner he caught sight of a palatial structure, nearly opposite.  “What building is that?” he asked of a boy.  “Where's year eyes?” returned the boy. “That's the Palmer House.”  Walter gazed admiringly at the showy building, and wished that he could afford to put up there. It was as far ahead of the Indiana House as a city is ahead of a country village. He continued his walk until he reached the lake front, and looked with interest at the great sheet of water which spread out before him like an inland sea. He walked along the lake front for a few squares, and then, striking back into the city, saw the Tremont House, the Court-house, the Sherman house, and other handsome buildings. On his way he met hundreds of people walking briskly, and all seeming occupied.  “If all these people make a living, why shouldn't I?” he asked himself. “I think I am as smart as the average.”  Secretly Walter thought himself a great deal smarter. It must be remembered that Walter was not quite eighteen--a self-conceited age--and he over-estimated his strength and ability. On the whole, it is fortunate that the young do not comprehend the difficult struggle that lies before them, or they would become discouraged before they had fairly entered upon it. It is well that they should be hopeful and sanguine. They are more likely to succeed.  Walter wandered around in a desultory way, and it was more than an hour before he reached the hotel at which he was stopping. As he entered the public room he started back in surprise, as his glance rested on a man wearing a white hat. Surely this was the man who had sold him the gold watch. How did it happen that he was not on the way to Dakota?  He coughed, with a view to attracting the attention of his railroad acquaintance.  The ruse succeeded. The man turned, and evidently recognized Walter. He looked doubtful, not having yet met his confederate nor learned how the plot had come out.  “I believe I met you on the train,” said Walter, smiling.  The smile decided the other that it would be safe to acknowledge the acquaintance.  “Yes, I remember you now.”  “You sold me a watch?”  “Yes,” answered the other, hesitating.  “I thought you wanted to take a train to Dakota this evening?” went on Walter.  “So I do, but it doesn't go till eight o'clock. May I ask what time it is? You know I sold you my watch.”  “I suppose that is Chicago time,” said Walter, pointing to a clock on the left-hand side of the office.  “I wonder whether he's got the watch still?” thought the other. “He must have, as he makes no fuss about it.”  Walter was waiting cunningly to see if his railroad acquaintance would betray himself.  “I'm awfully sorry to part with the watch,” he said. “If you keep it, I may buy it back some time.”  “I'm sorry I can't oblige you,” said Walter, “but I have sold it already.”  “Sold the watch already!” ejaculated the man in the white hat. “Did you sell it since you reached Chicago?”  “No; I sold it on the train.”  “You don't mean it!” exclaimed the other, in amazement. “Who did you sell it to?”  “Jim Beckwith,” answered Walter.  “Jim Beckwith!”  The man in the white hat stared at Walter with an air of startled perplexity that almost made our hero laugh.  “Yes, that's what he said his name was, or rather somebody told me it was his name.”  “Jim Beckwith bought that watch of you!” repeated the stranger slowly.  “Yes; do you know him?”  “I have heard of him,” said the other.  “Oh, I nearly forgot to say that he claimed the watch as his--said you had stolen it from him.”  “Jim Beckwith said that?”  “Yes.”  “And you "]]]
