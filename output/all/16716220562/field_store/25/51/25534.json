He was a Voltairian.  Voltairianism, deserted by the modern Liberals of France, has its chief cultivation nowadays among the wits of the old 'regime.'  They pick up its light weapons on the battle-field on which their fathers perished, and re-feather against the 'canaille' the shafts which had been pointed against the 'noblesse.'  \"Adieu, Count,\" said Alain, rising; \"I do not thank you less for your advice because I have not the wit to profit by it.\"  \"'Au revoir,' my cousin; you will think better of it when you have been a month or two at Paris.  By the way, my wife receives every Wednesday; consider our house yours.\"  \"Count, can I enter into the world which Madame la Comtesse receives, in the way that becomes my birth, on the income I take from my fortune?\"  The Count hesitated.  \"No,\" said he at last, frankly; \"not because you will be less welcome or less respected, but because I see that you have all the pride and sensitiveness of a 'seigneur de province.'  Society would therefore give you pain, not pleasure.  More than this, I know, by the remembrance of my own youth and the sad experience of my own sons, that you would be irresistibly led into debt, and debt in your circumstances would be the loss of Rochebriant.  No; I invite you to visit us.  I offer you the most select but not the most brilliant circles of Paris, because my wife is religious, and frightens away the birds of gay plumage with the scarecrows of priests and bishops.  But if you accept my invitation and my offer, I am bound, as an old man of the world to a young kinsman, to say that the chances are that you will be ruined.\"  \"I thank you, Count, for your candour; and I now acknowledge that I have found a relation and a guide,\" answered the Marquis, with nobility of mien that was not without a pathos which touched the hard heart of the old man.  \"Come at least whenever you want a sincere if a rude friend;\" and though he did not kiss his cousin's cheek this time, he gave him, with more sincerity, a parting shake of the hand.  And these made the principal events in Alain's Paris life till he met Frederic Lemercier.  Hitherto he had received no definite answer from M. Gandrin, who had postponed an interview, not having had leisure to make himself master of all the details in the abstract sent to him.     CHAPTER IV.  The next day, towards the afternoon, Frederic Lemercier, somewhat breathless from the rapidity at which he had ascended to so high an eminence, burst into Alain's chamber.  \"'Br-r!  mon cher;' what superb exercise for the health--how it must strengthen the muscles and expand the chest!  After this who should shrink from scaling Mont Blanc?  Well, well.  I have been meditating on your business ever since we parted.  But I would fain know more of its details.  You shall confide them to me as we drive through the Bois.  My coupe is below, and the day is beautiful; come.\"  To the young Marquis, the gayety, the heartiness of his college friend were a cordial.  How different from the dry counsels of the Count de Vandemar!  Hope, though vaguely, entered into his heart.  Willingly he accepted Frederic's invitation, and the young men were soon rapidly borne along the Champs Elysees.  As briefly as he could Alain described the state of his affairs, the nature of his mortgages, and the result of his interview with M. Gandrin.  Frederic listened attentively.  \"Then Gandrin has given you as yet no answer?\"  \"None; but I have a note from him this morning asking me to call to-morrow.\"  \"After you have seen him, decide on nothing,--if he makes you any offer. Get back your abstract, or a copy of it, and confide it to me.  Gandrin ought to help you; he transacts affairs in a large way.  'Belle clientele' among the millionnaires.  But his clients expect fabulous profits, and so does he.  As for your principal mortgagee, Louvier, you know, of course, who he is.\"  \"No, except that M. Hebert told me that he was very rich.\"  \"'Rich'  I should think so; one of the Kings of Finance, Ah! observe those young men on horseback.\"  Alain looked forth and recognized the two cavaliers whom he had conjectured to be the sons of the Count de Vandemar.  \"Those 'beaux garcons' are fair specimens of your Faubourg,\" said Frederic; \"they would decline my acquaintance because my grandfather kept a shop, and they keep a shop between them.\"  \"A shop!  I am mistaken, then.  Who are they?\"  \"Raoul and Enguerrand, sons of that mocker of man, the Count de Vandemar.\"  \"And they keep a shop!  You are jesting.\"  \"A shop at which you may buy gloves and perfumes, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin.  Of course they don't serve at the counter; they only invest their pocket-money in the speculation; and, in so doing, treble at least their pocket-money, buy their horses, and keep their grooms.\"  \"Is it possible! nobles of such birth!  How shocked the Count would be if he knew it!\"  \"Yes, very much shocked if he was supposed to know it.  But he is too wise a father not to give his sons limited allowances and unlimited liberty, especially the liberty to add to the allowances as they please. Look again at them; no better riders and more affectionate brothers since the date of Castor and Pollux.  Their tastes indeed differ--Raoul is religious and moral, melancholy and dignified; Enguerrand is a lion of the first water,--elegant to the tips of his nails.  These demigods nevertheless are very mild to mortals.  Though Enguerrand is the best pistol-shot in Paris, and Raoul the best fencer, the first is so good- tempered that you would be a brute to quarrel with him, the last so true a Catholic, that if you quarrelled with him you need not fear his sword. He would not die in the committal of what the Church holds a mortal sin.\"  \"Are you speaking ironically?  Do you mean to imply that men of the name of Vandemar are not brave?\"  On the contrary, I believe that, though masters of their weapons, they are too brave to abuse their skill; and I must add that, though they are sleeping partners in a shop, they would not cheat you of a farthing. Benign stars on earth, as Castor and Pollux were in heaven.\"  \"But partners in a shop!\"  \"Bah! when a minister himself, like the late M. de M______, kept a shop, and added the profits of 'bons bons' to his revenue, you may form some idea of the spirit of the age.  If young nobles are not generally sleeping partners in shops, still they are more or less adventurers in commerce.  The Bourse is the profession of those who have no other profession.  You have visited the Bourse?\"  \"No.\"  \"No! this is just the hour.  We have time yet for the Bois.  Coachman, drive to the Bourse.\"  \"The fact is,\" resumed Frederic, \"that gambling is one of the wants of civilized men.  The 'rouge-et-noir' and 'roulette' tables are forbidden; the hells closed: but the passion for making money without working for it must have its vent, and that vent is the Bourse.  As instead of a hundred wax-lights you now have one jet of gas, so instead of a hundred hells you have now one Bourse, and--it is exceedingly convenient; always at hand; no discredit being seen there as it was to be seen at Frascati's; on the contrary, at once respectable, and yet the mode.\"  The coupe stops at the Bourse, our friends mount the steps, glide through the pillars, deposit their canes at a place destined to guard them, and the Marquis follows Frederic up a flight of stairs till he gains the open gallery round a vast hall below.  Such a din! such a clamour! disputations, wrangling, wrathful.  Here Lemercier distinguished some friends, whom he joined for a few minutes.  Alain left alone, looked down into the hall.  He thought himself in some stormy scene of the First Revolution.  An English contested election in the market-place of a borough when the candidates are running close on each other--the result doubtful, passions excited, the whole borough in civil war--is peaceful compared to the scene at the Bourse.  Bulls and bears screaming, bawling, gesticulating, as if one were about to strangle the other; the whole, to an uninitiated eye, a confusion, a Babel, which it seems absolutely impossible to reconcile to the notion of quiet mercantile transactions, the purchase and sale of shares and stocks.  As Alain gazed bewildered, he felt himself gently touched, and, looking round, saw the Englishman.  \"A lively scene!\" whispered Mr. Vane.  \"This is the heart of Paris: it beats very loudly.\"  \"Is your Bourse in London like this?\"  \"I cannot tell you: at our Exchange the general public are not admitted: the privileged priests of that temple sacrifice their victims in closed penetralia, beyond which the sounds made in the operation do not travel to ears profane.  But had we an Exchange like this open to all the world, and placed, not in a region of our metropolis unknown to fashion, but in some elegant square in St. James's or at Hyde Park Corner, I suspect that our national character would soon undergo a great change, and that all our idlers and sporting-men would make their books there every day, instead of waiting long months in 'ennui' for the Doncaster and the Derby.  At present we have but few men on the turf; we should then have few men not on Exchange, especially if we adopt your law, and can contrive to be traders without risk of becoming bankrupts.  Napoleon I. called us a shopkeeping nation.  Napoleon III. has taught France to excel us in everything, and certainly he has made Paris a shopkeeping city.\"  Alain thought of Raoul and Enguerrand, and blushed to find that what he considered a blot on his countrymen was so familiarly perceptible to a foreigner's eye.  \"And the Emperor has done wisely, at least for the time,\" continued the Englishman, with a more thoughtful accent.  \"He has found vent thus for that very dangerous class in Paris society to which the subdivision of property gave birth; namely the crowd"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7737"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 01 (#8)"],["body","well-born, daring young men without fortune and without profession.  He has opened the 'Bourse' and said, 'There, I give you employment, resource, an 'avenir.''  He has cleared the byways into commerce and trade, and opened new avenues of wealth to the noblesse, whom the great Revolution so unwisely beggared. What other way to rebuild a 'noblesse' in France, and give it a chance of power be side an access to fortune? But to how many sides of your national character has the Bourse of Paris magnetic attraction!  You Frenchmen are so brave that you could not be happy without facing danger, so covetous of distinction that you would pine yourselves away without a dash, coute quo coute, at celebrity and a red ribbon.  Danger! look below at that arena: there it is; danger daily, hourly.  But there also is celebrity; win at the Bourse, as of old in a tournament, and paladins smile on you, and ladies give you their scarves, or, what is much the same, they allow you to buy their cachemires.  Win at the Bourse,--what follows?  the Chamber, the Senate, the Cross, the Minister's 'portefeuille.'  I might rejoice in all this for the sake of Europe,--could it last, and did it not bring the consequences that follow the demoralization which attends it.  The Bourse and the Credit Mobilier keep Paris quiet, at least as quiet as it can be. These are the secrets of this reign of splendour; these the two lions couchants on which rests the throne of the Imperial reconstructor.\"  Alain listened surprised and struck.  He had not given the Englishman credit for the cast of mind which such reflections evinced.  Here Lemercier rejoined them, and shook hands with Graham Vane, who, taking him aside, said, \"But you promised to go to the Bois, and indulge my insane curiosity about the lady in the pearl-coloured robe?\"  \"I have not forgotten; it is not half-past two yet; you said three. 'Soyez tranquille;' I drive thither from the Bourse with Rochebriant.\"  \"Is it necessary to take with you that very good-looking Marquis?\"  \"I thought you said you were not jealous, because not yet in love. However, if Rochebriant occasions you the pang which your humble servant failed to inflict, I will take care that he do not see the lady.\"  \"No,\" said the Englishman; \"on consideration, I should be very much obliged to any one with whom she would fall in love.  That would disenchant me.  Take the Marquis by all means.\"  Meanwhile Alain, again looking down, saw just under him, close by one of the pillars, Lucien Duplessis.  He was standing apart from the throng, a small space cleared round himself, and two men who had the air of gentlemen of the 'beau monde,' with whom he was conferring.  Duplessis, thus seen, was not like the Duplessis at the restaurant.  It would be difficult to explain what the change was, but it forcibly struck Alain: the air was more dignified, the expression keener; there was a look of conscious power and command about the man even at that distance; the intense, concentrated intelligence of his eye, his firm lip, his marked features, his projecting, massive brow, would have impressed a very ordinary observer.  In fact, the man was here in his native element; in the field in which his intellect gloried, commanded, and had signalized itself by successive triumphs.  Just thus may be the change in the great orator whom you deemed insignificant in a drawing-room, when you see his crest rise above a reverential audience; or the great soldier, who was not distinguishable from the subaltern in a peaceful club, could you see him issuing the order to his aids-de-camp amidst the smoke and roar of the battle-field.  \"Ah, Marquis!\" said Graham Vane, \"are you gazing at Duplessis?  He is the modern genius of Paris.  He is at once the Cousin, the Guizot, and the Victor Hugo of speculation.  Philosophy, Eloquence, audacious Romance,-- all Literature now is swallowed up in the sublime epic of 'Agiotage,' and Duplessis is the poet of the Empire.\"  \"Well said, M. Grarm Varn,\" cried Frederic, forgetting his recent lesson in English names.  \"Alain underrates that great man.  How could an Englishman appreciate him so well?\"  \"'Ma foi!'\" returned Graham, quietly.  \"I am studying to think at Paris, in order some day or other to know how to act in London.  Time for the Bois.  Lemercier, we meet at seven,--Philippe's.\"     CHAPTER V.  \"What do you think of the Bourse?\" asked Lemercier, as their carriage took the way to the Bois.  \"I cannot think of it yet; I am stunned.  It seems to me as if I had been at a 'Sabbat,' of which the wizards were 'agents de change,' but not less bent upon raising Satan.\"  \"Pooh!  the best way to exorcise Satan is to get rich enough not to be tempted by him.  The fiend always loved to haunt empty places; and of all places nowadays he prefers empty purses and empty stomachs.\"  \"But do all people get rich at the Bourse? or is not one man's wealth many men's ruin?\"  \"That is a question not very easy to answer; but under our present system Paris gets rich, though at the expense of individual Parisians.  I will try and explain.  The average luxury is enormously increased even in my experience; what were once considered refinements and fopperies are now called necessary comforts.  Prices are risen enormously, house-rent doubled within the last five or six years; all articles of luxury are very much dearer; the very gloves I wear cost twenty per cent more than I used to pay for gloves of the same quality.  How the people we meet live, and live so well, is an enigma that would defy AEdipus if AEdipus were not a Parisian.  But the main explanation is this: speculation and commerce, with the facilities given to all investments, have really opened more numerous and more rapid ways to fortune than were known a few years ago.  \"Crowds are thus attracted to Paris, resolved to venture a small capital in the hope of a large one; they live on that capital, not on their income, as gamesters do.  There is an idea among us that it is necessary to seem rich in order to become rich.  Thus there is a general extravagance and profusion.  English milords marvel at our splendour. Those who, while spending their capital as their income, fail in their schemes of fortune, after one, two, three, or four years, vanish.  What becomes of them, I know no more than I do what becomes of the old moons. Their place is immediately supplied by new candidates.  Paris is thus kept perennially sumptuous and splendid by the gold it engulfs.  But then some men succeed,--succeed prodigiously, preternaturally; they make colossal fortunes, which are magnificently expended.  They set an example of show and pomp, which is of course the more contagious because so many men say, 'The other day those millionnaires were as poor as we are; they never economized; why should we?'  Paris is thus doubly enriched,--by the fortunes it swallows up, and by the fortunes it casts up; the last being always reproductive, and the first never lost except to the individuals.\"  \"I understand: but what struck me forcibly at the scene we have left was the number of young men there; young men whom I should judge by their appearance to be gentlemen, evidently not mere spectators,--eager, anxious, with tablets in their hands.  That old or middle-aged men should find a zest in the pursuit of gain I can understand, but youth and avarice seem to me a new combination, which Moliere never divined in his 'Avare.'\"  \"Young men, especially if young gentlemen, love pleasure; and pleasure in this city is very dear.  This explains why so many young men frequent the Bourse.  In the old gaining now suppressed, young men were the majority; in the days of your chivalrous forefathers it was the young nobles, not the old, who would stake their very mantles and swords on a cast of the die.  And, naturally enough, _mon cher_; for is not youth the season of hope, and is not hope the goddess of gaming, whether at _rouge-et-noir_ or the Bourse?\"  Alain felt himself more and more behind his generation.  The acute reasoning of Lemercier humbled his _amour propre_.  At college Lemercier was never considered Alain's equal in ability or book-learning.  What a stride beyond his school-fellow had Lemercier now made!  How dull and stupid the young provincial felt himself to be as compared with the easy cleverness and half-sportive philosophy of the Parisian's fluent talk!  He sighed with a melancholy and yet with a generous envy.  He had too fine a natural perception not to acknowledge that there is a rank of mind as well as of birth, and in the first he felt that Lemercier might well walk before a Rochebriant; but his very humility was a proof that he underrated himself.  Lemercier did not excel him in mind, but in experience.  And just as the drilled soldier seems a much finer fellow than the raw recruit, because he knows how to carry himself, but after a year's discipline the raw recruit may excel in martial air the upright hero whom he now despairingly admires, and never dreams he can rival; so set a mind from a village into the drill of a capital, and see it a year after; it may tower a head higher than its recruiting-sergeant.     CHAPTER VI.  \"I believe,\" said Lemercier, as the _coupe_ rolled through the lively alleys of the Bois de Boulogne, \"that Paris is built on a loadstone, and that every Frenchman with some iron globules in his blood is irresistibly attracted towards it.  The English never seem to feel for London the passionate devotion that we feel for Paris.  On the contrary, the London middle class, the commercialists, the shopkeepers, the clerks, even the superior artisans compelled to do their business in the capital, seem always scheming and pining to have their home out of it, though but in a suburb.\"  \"You have been in London, Frederic?\"  \"Of course; it is the mode to visit that dull and hideous metropolis.\"  \"If it be dull and hideous, no wonder the people who are compelled to do business in it seek the pleasures"]]]
