He had understood her allusion to bridge, having been privileged several times during his stay to see his hostess play that game, and he hoped that there would be no bridge to-night.  And this was unselfish of him, for bridge meant sandwiches. Punctually at nine o'clock on bridge nights the butler would deposit on a side-table a plate of chicken sandwiches and (in deference to Peter's vegetarian views) a smaller plate of cheese sandwiches. At the close of play Mrs. Rastall-Retford would take one sandwich from each plate, drink a thimbleful of weak whisky and water, and retire.  Peter could always do with a sandwich or two these days. But he was prepared to abandon them joyfully if his hostess would waive bridge for this particular evening.  It was not to be. In the drawing-room Mrs. Rastall-Retford came out of her trance and called imperiously for the cards. Peter, when he saw his hand after the first deal, had a presentiment that if all his hands were to be as good as this, the evening was going to be a trying one. On the other occasions when they had played he had found it an extremely difficult task, even with moderate cards, to bring it about that his hostess should always win the odd rubber, for he was an excellent player, and, like most good players, had an artistic conscience which made it painful to him to play a deliberately bad game, even from the best motives. If all his hands were going to be as strong as this first one he saw that there was disaster ahead. He could not help winning.  Mrs. Rastall-Retford, who had dealt the first hand, made a most improper diamond declaration. Her son unfilially doubled, and, Eve having chicane--a tragedy which her partner evidently seemed to consider could have been avoided by the exercise of ordinary common sense--Peter and his partner, despite Peter's best efforts, won the game handsomely.  The son of the house dealt the next hand. Eve sorted her cards listlessly. She was feeling curiously tired. Her brain seemed dulled.  This hand, as the first had done, went all in favour of the two men. Mr. Rastall-Retford won five tricks in succession, and, judging from the glitter in his mild eye, was evidently going to win as many more as he possibly could. Mrs. Rastall-Retford glowered silently. There was electricity in the air.  The son of the house led a club. Eve played a card mechanically.  \"Have you no clubs, Miss Hendrie?\"  Eve started, and looked at her hand.  \"No,\" she said.  Mrs. Rastall-Retford grunted suspiciously.  Not long ago, in Westport, Connecticut, U.S.A., a young man named Harold Sperry, a telephone worker, was boring a hole in the wall of a house with a view to passing a wire through it. He whistled joyously as he worked. He did not know that he had selected for purposes of perforation the exact spot where there lay, nestling in the brickwork, a large leaden water-pipe. The first intimation he had of that fact was when a jet of water suddenly knocked him fifteen feet into a rosebush.  As Harold felt then, so did Eve now, when, examining her hand once more to make certain that she had no clubs, she discovered the ace of that ilk peeping coyly out from behind the seven of spades.  Her face turned quite white. It is never pleasant to revoke at bridge, but to Eve just then it seemed a disaster beyond words. She looked across at her partner. Her imagination pictured the scene there would be ere long, unless----  It happens every now and then that the human brain shows in a crisis an unwonted flash of speed. Eve's did at this juncture. To her in her trouble there came a sudden idea.  She looked round the table. Mr. Rastall-Retford, having taken the last trick, had gathered it up in the introspective manner of one planning big _coups_, and was brooding tensely, with knit brows. His mother was frowning over her cards. She was unobserved.  She seized the opportunity. She rose from her seat, moved quickly to the side-table, and, turning her back, slipped the fatal card dexterously into the interior of a cheese sandwich.  Mrs. Rastall-Retford, absorbed, did not notice for an instant. Then she gave tongue.  \"What are you doing, Miss Hendrie?\"  Eve was breathing quickly.  \"I--I thought that Mr. Rayner might like a sandwich.\"  She was at his elbow with the plate. It trembled in her hand.  \"A sandwich! Kindly do not be so officious, Miss Hendrie. The idea--in the middle of a hand----\" Her voice died away in a resentful mumble.  Peter started. He had been allowing his thoughts to wander. He looked from the sandwich to Eve and then at the sandwich again. He was puzzled. This had the aspect of being an olive-branch--could it be? Could she be meaning----? Or was it a subtle insult? Who could say? At any rate it was a sandwich, and he seized it, without prejudice.  \"I hope at least you have had the sense to remember that Mr. Rayner is a vegetarian, Miss Hendrie,\" said Mrs. Rastall-Retford. \"That is not a chicken sandwich?\"  \"No,\" said Eve; \"it is not a chicken sandwich.\"  Peter beamed gratefully. He raised the olive-branch, and bit into it with the energy of a starving man. And as he did so he caught Eve's eye.  \"Miss Hendrie!\" cried Mrs. Rastall-Retford.  Eve started violently.  \"Miss Hendrie, will you be good enough to play? The king of clubs to beat. I can't think what's the matter with you to-night.\"  \"I'm very sorry,\" said Eve, and put down the nine of spades.  Mrs. Rastall-Retford glared.  \"This is absurd,\" she cried. \"You _must_ have the ace of clubs. If you have not got it, who has? Look through your hand again. Is it there?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then where can it be?\"  \"Where can it be?\" echoed Peter, taking another bite.  \"Why--why,\" said Eve, crimson, \"I--I--have only five cards. I ought to have six.\"  \"Five?\" said Mrs. Rastall-Retford \"Nonsense! Count again. Have you dropped it on the floor?\"  Mr. Rastall-Retford stooped and looked under the table.  \"It is not on the floor,\" he said. \"I suppose it must have been missing from the pack before I dealt.\"  Mrs. Rastall-Retford threw down her cards and rose ponderously. It offended her vaguely that there seemed to be nobody to blame. \"I shall go to bed,\" she said.          *       *       *       *       *  Peter stood before the fire and surveyed Eve as she sat on the sofa. They were alone in the room, Mr. Rastall-Retford having drifted silently away in the wake of his mother. Suddenly Eve began to laugh helplessly.  He shook his head at her.  \"This is considerably sharper than a serpent's tooth,\" he said. \"You should be fawning gratefully upon me, not laughing. Do you suppose King Charles laughed at my ancestor when he ate the despatches? However, for the first time since I have been in this house I feel as if I had had a square meal.\"  Eve became suddenly serious. The smile left her face.  \"Mr. Rayner, please don't think I'm ungrateful. I couldn't help laughing, but I can't tell you how grateful I am. You don't know what it would have been like if she had found out that I had revoked. I did it once before, and she kept on about it for days and days. It was awful.\" She shivered. \"I think you must be right, and my nerves _are_ going.\"  He nodded.  \"So are you--to-morrow, by the first train. I wonder how soon we can get married. Do you know anything about special licenses?\"  She looked at him curiously.  \"You're very obstinate,\" she said.  \"Firm,\" he corrected. \"Firm. Could you pack to-night, do you think, and be ready for that ten-fifty to-morrow morning?\"  She began to trace an intricate pattern on the floor with the point of her shoe.  \"I can't imagine why you are fond of me!\" she said. \"I've been very horrid to you.\"  \"Nonsense. You've been all that's sweet and womanly.\"  \"And I want to tell you why,\" she went on. \"Your--your sister----\"  \"Ah, I thought as much!\"  \"She--she saw that you seemed to be getting fond of me, and she----\"  \"She would!\"  \"Said some rather horrid things that--hurt,\" said Eve, in a low voice.  Peter crossed over to where she sat and took her hand.  \"Don't you worry about her,\" he said. \"She's not a bad sort really, but about once every six months she needs a brotherly talking-to, or she gets above herself. One is about due during the next few days.\"  He stroke her hand.  \"Fasting,\" he said, thoughtfully, \"clears and stimulates the brain. I fancy I shall be able to think out some rather special things to say to her this time.\"     JEEVES AND THE CHUMP CYRIL   You know, the longer I live, the more clearly I see that half the trouble in this bally world is caused by the light-hearted and thoughtless way in which chappies dash off letters of introduction and hand them to other chappies to deliver to chappies of the third part. It's one of those things that make you wish you were living in the Stone Age. What I mean to say is, if a fellow in those days wanted to give anyone a letter of introduction, he had to spend a month or so carving it on a large-sized boulder, and the chances were that the other chappie got so sick of lugging the thing round in the hot sun that he dropped it after the first mile. But nowadays it's so easy to write letters of introduction that everybody does it without a second thought, with the result that some perfectly harmless cove like myself gets in the soup.  Mark you, all the above is what you might call the result of my riper experience. I don't mind admitting that in the first flush of the thing, so to speak, when Jeeves told me--this would be about three weeks after I'd landed in America--that a blighter called Cyril Bassington-Bassington had arrived and I found that he had brought a letter of introduction to me from Aunt Agatha ... where was I? Oh, yes ... I don't mind admitting, I was saying, that just at first I was rather bucked. You see, after the painful events which had resulted in my leaving England I hadn't expected to get any sort of letter from Aunt Agatha which would pass the censor, so to speak.

Montgomery Chapple, bachelor, of Seymour's house, Wrykyn. Let us examine and ponder over it.  It has been well said that this is the age of the specialist. Everybody, if they wish to leave the world a better and happier place for their stay in it, should endeavour to adopt some speciality and make it their own. Chapple's speciality was being late for breakfast. He was late not once or twice, but every day. Sometimes he would scramble in about the time of the second cup of coffee, buttoning his waistcoat as he sidled to his place. Generally he would arrive just as the rest of the house were filing out; when, having lurked hidden until Mr. Seymour was out of the way, he would enter into private treaty with Herbert, the factotum, who had influence with the cook, for Something Hot and maybe a fresh brew of coffee. For there was nothing of the amateur late-breakfaster about Chapple. Your amateur slinks in with blushes deepening the naturally healthy hue of his face, and, bolting a piece of dry bread and gulping down a cup of cold coffee, dashes out again, filled more with good resolutions for the future than with food. Not so Chapple. He liked his meals. He wanted a good deal here below, and wanted it hot and fresh. Conscience had but a poor time when it tried to bully Chapple. He had it weak in the first round.  But there was one more powerful than Conscience--Mr. Seymour. He had marked the constant lateness of our hero, and disapproved of it.  Thus it happened that Chapple, having finished an excellent breakfast one morning some twenty minutes after everybody else, was informed as he sat in the junior day-room trying, with the help of an illustrated article in a boys' paper, to construct a handy model steam-engine out of a reel of cotton and an old note-book--for his was in many ways a giant brain--that Mr. Seymour would like to have a friendly chat with him in his study. Laying aside his handy model steam-engine, he went off to the housemaster's study.  \"You were late for breakfast to-day,\" said Mr. Seymour, in the horrid, abrupt way housemasters have.  \"Why, yes, sir,\" said Chapple, pleasantly.  \"And the day before.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And the day before that.\"  Chapple did not deny it. He stood on one foot and smiled a propitiating smile. So far Mr. Seymour was entitled to demand a cigar or cocoanut every time.  The housemaster walked to the window, looked out, returned to the mantelpiece, and shifted the position of a china vase two and a quarter inches to the left. Chapple, by way of spirited repartee, stood on the other leg and curled the disengaged foot round his ankle. The conversation was getting quite intellectual.  \"You will write out----\"  \"Sir, please, sir----\" interrupted Chapple in an \"I-represent-the defendant-m'lud\" tone of voice.  \"Well?\"  \"It's awfully hard to hear the bell from where I sleep, sir.\"  Owing to the increased numbers of the house this term Chapple had been removed from his dormitory proper to a small room some distance away.  \"Nonsense. The bell can be heard perfectly well all over the house.\"  There was reason in what he said. Herbert, who woke the house of a morning, did so by ringing a bell. It was a big bell, and he enjoyed ringing it. Few sleepers, however sound, could dream on peacefully through Herbert's morning solo. After five seconds of it they would turn over uneasily. After seven they would sit up. At the end of the first quarter of a minute they would be out of bed, and you would be wondering where they picked up such expressions.  Chapple murmured wordlessly in reply. He realised that his defence was a thin one. Mr. Seymour followed up his advantage.  \"You will write a hundred lines of Vergil,\" he said, \"and if you are late again to-morrow I shall double them.\"  Chapple retired.  This, he felt, was a crisis. He had been pursuing his career of unpunctuality so long that he had never quite realised that a time might come when the authorities would drop on him. For a moment he felt that it was impossible, that he could not meet Mr. Seymour's wishes in the matter; but the bull-dog pluck of the true Englishman caused him to reconsider this. He would at least have a dash at it.  \"I'll tell you what to do,\" said his friend, Brodie, when consulted on the point over a quiet pot of tea that afternoon. \"You ought to sleep without so many things on the bed. How many blankets do you use, for instance?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Chapple. \"As many as they shove on.\"  It had never occurred to him to reckon up the amount of his bedclothes before retiring to rest.  \"Well, you take my tip,\" said Brodie, \"and only sleep with one on. Then the cold'll wake you in the morning, and you'll get up because it'll be more comfortable than staying in bed.\"  This scientific plan might have worked. In fact, to a certain extent it did work. It woke Chapple in the morning, as Brodie had predicted; but it woke him at the wrong hour. It is no good springing out of bed when there are still three hours to breakfast. When Chapple woke at five the next morning, after a series of dreams, the scenes of which were laid mainly in the Arctic regions, he first sneezed, then he piled upon the bed everything he could find, including his boots, and then went to sleep again. The genial warmth oozed through his form, and continued to ooze until he woke once more, this time at eight-fifteen. Breakfast being at eight, it occurred to him that his position with Mr. Seymour was not improved. While he was devoting a few moments' profound meditation to this point the genial warmth got in its fell work once again. When he next woke, the bell was ringing for school. He lowered the world's record for rapid dressing, and was just in time to accompany the tail of the procession into the form-room.  \"You were late again this morning,\" said Mr. Seymour, after dinner.  \"Yes, sir. I overslebbed myselb, sir,\" replied Chapple, who was suffering from a cold in the head.  \"Two hundred lines.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  Things had now become serious. It was no good going to Brodie again for counsel. Brodie had done for himself, proved himself a fraud, an idiot. In fine, a rotter. He must try somebody else. Happy thought. Spenlow. It was a cold day, when Spenlow got left behind. He would know what to do. _There_ was a chap for you, if you liked! Young, mind you, but what a brain! Colossal!  \"What _I_ should do,\" said Spenlow, \"is this. I should put my watch on half an hour.\"  \"What 'ud be the good of that?\"  \"Why, don't you see? You'd wake up and find it was ten to eight, say, by your watch, so you'd shove on the pace dressing, and nip downstairs, and then find that you'd really got tons of time. What price that?\"  \"But I should remember I'd put my watch on,\" objected Chapple.  \"Oh, no, probably not. You'd be half asleep, and you'd shoot out of bed before you remembered, and that's all you'd want. It's the getting out of bed that's so difficult. If you were once out, you wouldn't want to get back again.\"  \"Oh, shouldn't I?\" said Chapple.  \"Well, you might want to, but you'd have the sense not to do it.\"  \"It's not a bad idea,\" said Chapple. \"Thanks.\"  That night he took his Waterbury, prised open the face with a pocket-knife as if he were opening an oyster, put the minute hand on exactly half an hour, and retired to bed satisfied. There was going to be no nonsense about it this time.  I am sorry to disappoint the reader, but facts are facts, and I must not tamper with them. It is, therefore, my duty to state, however reluctantly, that Chapple was not in time for breakfast on the following morning. He woke at seven o'clock, when the hands of the watch pointed to seven-thirty. Primed with virtuous resolutions, he was just about to leap from his couch, when his memory began to work, and he recollected that he had still an hour. Punctuality, he felt, was an excellent thing, a noble virtue, in fact, but it was no good overdoing it. He could give himself at least another half hour. So he dozed off. He woke again with something of a start. He seemed to feel that he had been asleep for a considerable time. But no. A glance at the watch showed the hands pointing to twenty-five to eight. Twenty-five minutes more. He had a good long doze this time. Then, feeling that now he really must be getting up, he looked once more at the watch, and rubbed his eyes. It was still twenty-five to eight.  The fact was that, in the exhilaration of putting the hands on, he had forgotten that other and even more important operation, winding up. The watch had stopped.  There are few more disturbing sensations than that of suddenly discovering that one has no means of telling the time. This is especially so when one has to be in a certain place by a certain hour. It gives the discoverer a weird, lost feeling, as if he had stopped dead while all the rest of the world had moved on at the usual rate. It is a sensation not unlike that of the man who arrives on the platform of a railway station just in time to see the tail-end of his train disappear.  Until that morning the world's record for dressing (set up the day before) had been five minutes, twenty-three and a fifth seconds. He lowered this by two seconds, and went downstairs.  The house was empty. In the passage that led to the dining-room he looked at the clock, and his heart turned a somersault. _It was five minutes past nine._ Not only was he late for breakfast, but late for school, too.
