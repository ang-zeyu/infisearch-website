No possible doubt whatever.         But owing, I'm much disposed to fear,             To his terrible taste for tippling,        That highly respectable gondolier        Could never declare with a mind sincere        Which of the two was his offspring dear,             And which the Royal stripling!                   Which was which he could never make out                       Despite his best endeavour.                  Of that there is no manner of doubt—                  No probable, possible shadow of doubt—                       No possible doubt whatever.    ALL.                No possible doubt whatever.         Time sped, and when at the end of a year             I sought that infant cherished,        That highly respectable gondolier        Was lying a corpse on his humble bier—        I dropped a Grand Inquisitor's tear—             That gondolier had perished.                   A taste for drink, combined with gout,                       Had doubled him up for ever.                  Of that there is no manner of doubt—                  No probable, possible shadow of doubt—                       No possible doubt whatever.    ALL.                No possible doubt whatever.         The children followed his old career—             (This statement can't be parried)        Of a highly respectable gondolier:        Well, one of the two (who will soon be here)—        But which of the two is not quite clear—             Is the Royal Prince you married!                   Search in and out and round about,                       And you'll discover never                       A tale so free from every doubt—                  All probable, possible shadow of doubt—                  All possible doubt whatever!    ALL.                A tale free from every doubt, etc.         CAS.  Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of   two gondoliers, but it is impossible to say which?        DON AL.  Without any doubt of any kind whatever.  But be   reassured: the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the   mother of the musical young man who is such a past-master of that   delicately modulated instrument (indicating the drum).  She can,   no doubt, establish the King's identity beyond all question.        LUIZ.  Heavens, how did he know that?        DON AL.  My young friend, a Grand Inquisitor is always up to   date.  (To Cas.)  His mother is at present the wife of a highly   respectable and old-established brigand, who carries on an   extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova.  Accompanied   by two of my emissaries, he will set off at once for his mother's   address.  She will return with them, and if she finds any   difficulty in making up her mind, the persuasive influence of the   torture chamber will jog her memory.                  RECITATIVE—CASILDA and DON ALHAMBRA.    CAS.      But, bless my heart, consider my position!                  I am the wife of one, that's very clear;             But who can tell, except by intuition,                  Which is the Prince, and which the Gondolier?    DON AL.   Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle:                  Such complications frequently occur—             Life is one closely complicated tangle:                  Death is the only true unraveller!      QUINTET—DUKE, DUCHESS, CASILDA, LUIZ, and GRAND INQUISITOR.    ALL.      Try we life-long, we can never                  Straighten out life's tangled skein,             Why should we, in vain endeavour,                  Guess and guess and guess again?    LUIZ.               Life's a pudding full of plums,    DUCH.               Care's a canker that benumbs.    ALL.           Life's a pudding full of plums,                  Care's a canker that benumbs.             Wherefore waste our elocution             On impossible solution?             Life's a pleasant institution,                  Let us take it as it comes!              Set aside the dull enigma,                  We shall guess it all too soon;             Failure brings no kind of stigma—                  Dance we to another tune!    LUIZ.               String the lyre and fill the cup,    DUCH.               Lest on sorrow we should sup.    ALL.      Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle,             Hands across and down the middle—             Life's perhaps the only riddle                  That we shrink from giving up!    (Exeunt all into Ducal Palace except Luiz, who goes off in   gondola.)    (Enter Gondoliers and Contadine, followed by Marco, Gianetta,   Giuseppe, and Tessa.)                                 CHORUS.                        Bridegroom and bride!                            Knot that's insoluble,                            Voices all voluble                       Hail it with pride.                       Bridegroom and bride!                            We in sincerity                            Wish you prosperity,                       Bridegroom and bride!                              SONG—TESSA.    TESS.          When a merry maiden marries,                  Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;                       Every sound becomes a song,                       All is right, and nothing's wrong!                  From to-day and ever after                  Let our tears be tears of laughter.                       Every sigh that finds a vent                       Be a sigh of sweet content!                  When you marry, merry maiden,                  Then the air with love is laden;                       Every flower is a rose,                            Every goose becomes a swan,                       Every kind of trouble goes                            Where the last year's snows have gone!    CHORUS.             Sunlight takes the place of shade                            When you marry, merry maid!    TESS.          When a merry maiden marries,                  Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;                       Every sound becomes a song,                       All is right, and nothing's wrong.                  Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow,                  Get ye gone until to-morrow;                       Jealousies in grim array,                       Ye are things of yesterday!                  When you marry, merry maiden,                  Then the air with joy is laden;                       All the corners of the earth                            Ring with music sweetly played,                       Worry is melodious mirth,                            Grief is joy in masquerade;    CHORUS.             Sullen night is laughing day—                       All the year is merry May!    (At the end of the song, Don Alhambra enters at back.  The   Gondoliers and Contadine shrink from him, and gradually go off,   much alarmed.)         GIU. And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest!   What's a bachelor?  A mere nothing—he's a chrysalis.  He can't   be said to live—he exists.        MAR.  What a delightful institution marriage is!  Why have   we wasted all this time?  Why didn't we marry ten years ago?        TESS.  Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.        GIA.  Because you were waiting for us.        MAR.  I suppose that was the reason.  We were waiting for   you without knowing it.  (Don Alhambra comes forward.)  Hallo!        DON AL.  Good morning.        GIU.  If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.        DON AL.  Ceremony of some sort going on?        GIU. (aside).  He is an undertaker!  (Aloud.)  No—a little   unimportant family gathering.  Nothing in your line.        DON AL.  Somebody's birthday, I suppose?        GIA.  Yes, mine!        TESS.  And mine!        MAR.  And mine!        GIU.  And mine!        DON AL.  Curious coincidence!  And how old may you all be?        TESS.  It's a rude question—but about ten minutes.        DON AL.  Remarkably fine children!  But surely you are   jesting?        TESS.  In other words, we were married about ten minutes   since.        DON AL.  Married!  You don't mean to say you are married?        MAR.  Oh yes, we are married.        DON AL.  What, both of you?        ALL.  All four of us.        DON AL. (aside).  Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!        GIA.  You don't mind, I suppose?        TESS.  You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I   presume?  Oh, Giuseppe, look at him—he was.  He's heart-broken!        DON AL.  No, no, I wasn't!  I wasn't!        GIU.  Now, my man (slapping him on the back), we don't want   anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's   satisfied—you can go!        DON AL.  You mustn't call me your man.  It's a liberty.  I   don't think you know who I am.        GIU.  Not we, indeed!  We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of   Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution.  Republicans,   heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal.  As we abhor   oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest   rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth.  We are   Venetian gondoliers—your equals in everything except our   calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.        DON AL.  Bless my heart, how unfortunate!  One of you may be   Baptisto's son, for anything I know to the contrary; but the   other is no less a personage than the only son of the late King   of Barataria.        ALL.  What!        DON AL.  And I trust—I trust it was that one who slapped me   on the shoulder and called me his man!        GIU.  One of us a king!        MAR.  Not brothers!        TESS.  The King of Barataria!           [Together]        GIA.  Well, who'd have thought it!        MAR.  But which is it?        DON AL.  What does it matter?  As you are both Republicans,   and hold kings in detestation, of course you'll abdicate at once.   Good morning!  (Going.)        GIA. and TESS.  Oh, don't do that!

Well, as to that, of course there are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],["title","The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#4)"],["body","and kings.   When I say that I detest kings, I mean I detest bad kings.        DON AL.  I see.  It's a delicate distinction.        GIU.  Quite so.  Now I can conceive a kind of king—an ideal   king—the creature of my fancy, you know—who would be absolutely   unobjectionable.  A king, for instance, who would abolish taxes   and make everything cheap, except gondolas—        MAR.  And give a great many free entertainments to the   gondoliers—        GIU.  And let off fireworks on the Grand Canal, and engage   all the gondolas for the occasion—        MAR.  And scramble money on the Rialto among the gondoliers.        GIU.  Such a king would be a blessing to his people, and if   I were a king, that is the sort of king I would be.        MAR.  And so would I!        DON AL.  Come, I'm glad to find your objections are not   insuperable.        MAR. and GIU.  Oh, they're not insuperable.        GIA. and TESS.  No, they're not insuperable.        GIU.  Besides, we are open to conviction.        GIA.  Yes; they are open to conviction.        TESS.  Oh! they've often been convicted.        GIU.  Our views may have been hastily formed on insufficient   grounds.  They may be crude, ill-digested, erroneous.  I've a   very poor opinion of the politician who is not open to   conviction.        TESS. (to Gia.).  Oh, he's a fine fellow!        GIA.  Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!        DON AL.  Then we'll consider it settled.  Now, as the   country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary   that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and,   until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have   arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can   arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.        MAR.  As one individual?        DON AL.  As one individual.        GIU. (linking himself with Marco).  Like this?        DON AL.  Something like that.        MAR.  And we may take our friends with us, and give them   places about the Court?        DON AL.  Undoubtedly.  That's always done!        MAR.  I'm convinced!        GIU.  So am I!        TESS.  Then the sooner we're off the better.        GIA.  We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)—        DON AL.  Stop, stop—that won't do at all—ladies are not   admitted.        ALL.  What!        DON AL.  Not admitted.  Not at present.  Afterwards,   perhaps.  We'll see.        GIU.  Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate   us from our wives!        DON AL. (aside).  This is very awkward!  (Aloud.)  Only for   a time—a few months.  Alter all, what is a few months?        TESS.  But we've only been married half an hour!  (Weeps.)                             FINALE, ACT I.                             SONG—GIANETTA.              Kind sir, you cannot have the heart                       Our lives to part                  From those to whom an hour ago                            We were united!             Before our flowing hopes you stem,                       Ah, look at them,                  And pause before you deal this blow,                            All uninvited!             You men can never understand                       That heart and hand                  Cannot be separated when                            We go a-yearning;             You see, you've only women's eyes                       To idolize                  And only women's hearts, poor men,                            To set you burning!             Ah me, you men will never understand             That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!              Some kind of charm you seem to find                       In womankind—                  Some source of unexplained delight                            (Unless you're jesting),             But what attracts you, I confess,                       I cannot guess,                  To me a woman's face is quite                            Uninteresting!             If from my sister I were torn,                       It could be borne—                  I should, no doubt, be horrified,                            But I could bear it;—             But Marco's quite another thing—                       He is my King,                  He has my heart and none beside                            Shall ever share it!             Ah me, you men will never understand             That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!                        RECITATIVE—DON ALHAMBRA.              Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief,             Your separation will be very brief.                  To ascertain which is the King                       And which the other,                  To Barataria's Court I'll bring                       His foster-mother;                  Her former nurseling to declare                       She'll be delighted.             That settled, let each happy pair                  Be reunited.    MAR., GIU.,    Viva!  His argument is strong!   GIA., TESS.    Viva!  We'll not be parted long!                  Viva!  It will be settled soon!                  Viva!  Then comes our honeymoon!                                                         (Exit Don   Alhambra.)               QUARTET—MARCO, GIUSEPPE., GIANETTA, TESSA.    GIA.           Then one of us will be a Queen,                       And sit on a golden throne,                            With a crown instead                            Of a hat on her head,                       And diamonds all her own!                  With a beautiful robe of gold and green,                       I've always understood;                            I wonder whether                            She'd wear a feather?                       I rather think she should!    ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,                  To be a regular Royal Queen!                  No half-and-half affair, I mean,                  But a right-down regular Royal Queen!    MAR.           She'll drive about in a carriage and pair,                       With the King on her left-hand side,                            And a milk-white horse,                            As a matter of course,                       Whenever she wants to ride!                  With beautiful silver shoes to wear                       Upon her dainty feet;                            With endless stocks                            Of beautiful frocks                       And as much as she wants to eat!    ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.    TESS.          Whenever she condescends to walk,                       Be sure she'll shine at that,                            With her haughty stare                            And her nose in the air,                       Like a well-born aristocrat!                  At elegant high society talk                       She'll bear away the bell,                            With her \"How de do?\"                            And her \"How are you?\"                       And \"I trust I see you well!\"    ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.    GIU.           And noble lords will scrape and bow,                       And double themselves in two,                            And open their eyes                            In blank surprise                       At whatever she likes to do.                  And everybody will roundly vow                       She's fair as flowers in May,                            And say, \"How clever!\"                            At whatsoever                       She condescends to say!    ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,                  To be a regular Royal Queen!                  No half-and-half affair, I mean,                  But a right-down regular Royal Queen!    (Enter Chorus of Gondoliers and Contadine.)                                 CHORUS.         Now, pray, what is the cause of this remarkable hilarity?             This sudden ebullition of unmitigated jollity?        Has anybody blessed you with a sample of his charity?             Or have you been adopted by a gentleman of quality?    MAR. and GIU.  Replying, we sing                       As one individual,                  As I find I'm a king,                       To my kingdom I bid you all.                  I'm aware you object                       To pavilions and palaces,                  But you'll find I respect                       Your Republican fallacies.    CHORUS.        As they know we object                       To pavilions and palaces,                  How can they respect                       Our Republican fallacies?                           MARCO and GIUSEPPE.    MAR.           For every one who feels inclined,                  Some post we undertake to find                  Congenial with his frame of mind—                       And all shall equal be.    GIU.           The Chancellor in his peruke—                  The Earl, the Marquis, and the Dook,                  The Groom, the Butler, and the Cook—                       They all shall equal be.    MAR.           The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts—                  The Aristocrat who hunts and shoots—                  The Aristocrat who cleans our boots—                       They all shall equal be!    GIU.           The Noble Lord who rules the State—                  The Noble Lord who cleans the plate—    MAR.           The Noble Lord who scrubs the grate—                       They all shall equal be!    GIU.           The Lord High Bishop orthodox—                  The Lord High Coachman on the box—    MAR.           The Lord High Vagabond in the stocks—                       They all shall equal be!
