CHAPTER I.  On waking some morning, have you ever felt, reader, as if a change for the brighter in the world, without and within you, had suddenly come to pass-some new glory has been given to the sunshine, some fresh balm to the air-you feel younger, and happier, and lighter, in the very beat of your heart-you almost fancy you hear the chime of some spiritual music far off, as if in the deeps of heaven?  You are not at first conscious how, or wherefore, this change has been brought about.  Is it the effect of a dream in the gone sleep, that has made this morning so different from mornings that have dawned before?  And while vaguely asking yourself that question, you become aware that the cause is no mere illusion, that it has its substance in words spoken by living lips, in things that belong to the work-day world.  It was thus that Isaura woke the morning after the conversation with Alain de Rochebriant, and as certain words, then spoken, echoed back on her ear, she knew why she was so happy, why the world was so changed.  In those words she heard the voice of Graham Vane--nor she had not deceived herself--she was loved!  she was loved!  What mattered that long cold interval of absence?  She had not forgotten--she could not believe that absence had brought forgetfulness.  There are moments when we insist on judging another's heart by our own.  All would be explained some day--all would come right.  How lovely was the face that reflected itself in the glass as she stood before it, smoothing back her long hair, murmuring sweet snatches of Italian love-song, and blushing with sweeter love-thoughts as she sang! All that had passed in that year so critical to her outer life--the authorship, the fame, the public career, the popular praise--vanished from her mind as a vapour that rolls from the face of a lake to which the sunlight restores the smile of a brightened heaven.  She was more the girl now than she had ever been since the day on which she sat reading Tasso on the craggy shore of Sorrento.  Singing still as she passed from her chamber, and entering the sitting- room, which fronted the east, and seemed bathed in the sunbeams of deepening May, she took her bird from its cage, and stopped her song to cover it with kisses, which perhaps yearned for vent somewhere.  Later in the day she went out to visit Valerie.  Recalling the altered manner of her young friend, her sweet nature became troubled.  She divined that Valerie had conceived some jealous pain which she longed to heal; she could not bear the thought of leaving any one that day unhappy. Ignorant before of the girl's feelings towards Alain, she now partly guessed them--one woman who loves in secret is clairvoyante as to such secrets in another.  Valerie received her visitor with a coldness she did not attempt to disguise.  Not seeming to notice this, Isaura commenced the conversation with frank mention of Rochebriant.  \"I have to thank you so much, dear Valerie, for a pleasure you could not anticipate--that of talking about an absent friend, and hearing the praise he deserved from one so capable of appreciating excellence as M. de Rochebriant appears to be.\"  \"You were talking to M. de Rochebriant of an absent friend--ah! you seemed indeed very much interested in the conversation--\"  \"Do not wonder at that, Valerie; and do not grudge me the happiest moments I have known for months.\"  \"In talking with M. de Rochebriant!  No doubt, Mademoiselle Cicogna, you found him very charming.\"  To her surprise and indignation, Valerie here felt the arm of Isaura tenderly entwining her waist, and her face drawn towards Isaura's sisterly kiss.  \"Listen to me, naughty child-listen and believe.  M. de Rochebriant can never be charming to me--never touch a chord in my heart or my fancy except as friend to another, or--kiss me in your turn, Valerie--as suitor to yourself.\"  Valerie here drew back her pretty childlike head, gazed keenly a moment into Isaura's eyes, felt convinced by the limpid candour of their unmistakable honesty, and flinging herself on her friend's bosom, kissed her passionately, and burst into tears.  The complete reconciliation between the two girls was thus peacefully effected; and then Isaura had to listen, at no small length, to the confidences poured into her ears by Valerie, who was fortunately too engrossed by her own hopes and doubts to exact confidences in return. Valerie's was one of those impulsive eager natures that longs for a confidante.  Not so Isaura's.  Only when Valerie had unburthened her heart, and been soothed and caressed into happy trust in the future, did she recall Isaura's explanatory words, and said, archly:  \"And your absent friend?  Tell me about him.  Is he as handsome as Alain?\"  \"Nay,\" said Isaura, rising to take up the mantle and hat she had laid aside on entering, \"they say that the colour of a flower is in our vision, not in the leaves.\"  Then with a grave melancholy in the look she fixed upon Valerie, she added: \"Rather than distrust of me should occasion you pain, I have pained myself, in making clear to you the reason why I felt interest in M. de Rochebriant's conversation.  In turn, I ask of you a favour--do not on this point question me farther.  There are some things in our past which influence the present, but to which we dare not assign a future--on which we cannot talk to another.  What soothsayer can tell us if the dream of a yesterday will be renewed on the night of a morrow?  All is said--we trust one another, dearest.\"     CHAPTER II.  That evening the Morleys looked in at Isaura's on their way to a crowded assembly at the house of one of those rich Americans, who were then outvying the English residents at Paris in the good graces of Parisian society.  I think the Americans get on better with the French than the English do--I mean the higher class of Americans.  They spend more money; their men speak French better; the women are better dressed, and, as a general rule, have read more largely, and converse more frankly.  Mrs. Morley's affection for Isaura had increased during the last few months. As so notable an advocate of the ascendancy of her sex, she felt a sort of grateful pride in the accomplishments and growing renown of so youthful a member of the oppressed sisterhood.  But, apart from that sentiment, she had conceived a tender mother-like interest for the girl who stood in the world so utterly devoid of family ties, so destitute of that household guardianship and protection which, with all her assertion of the strength and dignity of woman, and all her opinions as to woman's right of absolute emancipation from the conventions fabricated by the selfishness of man, Mrs. Morley was too sensible not to value for the individual, though she deemed it not needed for the mass.  Her great desire was that Isaura should marry well, and soon.  American women usually marry so young that it seemed to Mrs. Morley an anomaly in social life, that one so gifted in mind and person as Isaura should already have passed the age in which the belles of the great Republic are enthroned as wives and consecrated as mothers.  We have seen that in the past year she had selected from our unworthy but necessary sex, Graham Vane as a suitable spouse to her young friend.  She had divined the state of his heart--she had more than suspicions of the state of Isaura's.  She was exceedingly perplexed and exceedingly chafed at the Englishman's strange disregard to his happiness and her own projects.  She had counted, all this past winter, on his return to Paris; and she became convinced that some misunderstanding, possibly some lover's quarrel, was the cause of his protracted absence, and a cause that, if ascertained, could be removed.  A good opportunity now presented itself--Colonel Morley was going to London the next day.  He had business there which would detain him at least a week.  He would see Graham; and as she considered her husband the shrewdest and wisest person in the world--I mean of the male sex--she had no doubt of his being able to turn Graham's mind thoroughly inside out, and ascertain his exact feelings and intentions.  If the Englishman, thus assayed, were found of base metal, then, at least, Mrs. Morley would be free to cast him altogether aside, and coin for the uses of the matrimonial market some nobler effigy in purer gold.  \"My dear child,\" said Mrs. Morley, in a low voice, nestling herself close to Isaura, while the Colonel, duly instructed, drew off the Venosta, \"have you heard anything lately of our pleasant friend Mr. Vane?\"  You can guess with what artful design Mrs. Morley put that question point-blank, fixing keen eyes on Isaura while she put it.  She saw the heightened colour, the quivering lip of the girl thus abruptly appealed to, and she said inly: \"I was right--she loves him!\"  \"I heard of Mr. Vane last night--accidentally.\"  \"Is he coming to Paris soon?\"  \"Not that I know of.  How charmingly that wreath becomes you!  it suits the earrings so well, too.\"  \"Frank chose it; he has good taste for a man.  I trust him with my commissions to Hunt and Roskell's but I limit him as to price, he is so extravagant--men are, when they make presents.  They seem to think we value things according to their cost.  They would gorge us with jewels, and let us starve for want of a smile.  Not that Frank is so bad as the rest of them.  But a propos of Mr. Vane--Frank will be sure to see him, and scold him well for deserting us all.  I should not be surprised if he brought the deserter back with him, for I send a little note by Frank, inviting him to pay us a visit.  We have spare rooms in our apartments.\"  Isaura's heart heaved beneath her robe, but she replied in a tone of astonishing indifference: \"I believe this is the height of the London season, and Mr. Vane would probably be too engaged to profit even"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7745"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 09 (#1)"],["body"," an invitation so tempting.\"  \"_Nous verrons_.  How pleased he will be to hear of your triumphs!  He admired you so much before you were famous: what will be his admiration now! men are so vain--they care for us so much more when people praise us.  But till we have put the creatures in their proper place, we must take them for what they are.\"  Here the Venosta, with whom the poor Colonel had exhausted all the arts at his command for chaining her attention, could be no longer withheld from approaching Mrs. Morley, and venting her admiration of that lady's wreath, earrings, robes, flounces.  This dazzling apparition had on her the effect which a candle has on a moth--she fluttered round it, and longed to absorb herself in its blaze.  But the wreath especially fascinated her--a wreath which no prudent lady with colourings less pure, and features less exquisitely delicate than the pretty champion of the rights of women, could have fancied on her own brows without a shudder. But the Venosta in such matters was not prudent.  \"It can't be dear,\" she cried piteously, extending her arms towards Isaura.  \"I must have one exactly like.  Who made it?  Cara signora, give me the address.\"  \"Ask the Colonel, dear Madame; he chose and bought it,\" and Mrs. Morley glanced significantly at her well-tutored Frank.  \"Madame,\" said the Colonel, speaking in English, which he usually did with the Venosta--who valued herself on knowing that language and was flattered to be addressed in it--while he amused himself by introducing into its forms the dainty Americanisms with which he puzzled the Britisher--he might well puzzle the Florentine,--\"Madame, I am too anxious for the appearance of my wife to submit to the test of a rival schemer like yourself in the same apparel.  With all the homage due to a sex of which I am enthused dreadful, I decline to designate the florist from whom I purchased Mrs. Morley's head-fixings.\"  \"Wicked man!\" cried the Venosta, shaking her finger at him coquettishly. \"You are jealous!  Fie! a man should never be jealous of a woman's rivalry with women;\" and then, with a cynicism that might have become a greybeard, she added, \"but of his own sex every man should be jealous-- though of his dearest friend.  Isn't it so, _Colonello_?\"  The Colonel looked puzzled, bowed, and made no reply.  \"That only shows,\" said Mrs. Morley, rising, \"what villains the Colonel has the misfortune to call friends and fellow-men.\"  \"I fear it is time to go,\" said Frank, glancing at the clock.  In theory the most rebellious, in practice the most obedient, of wives, Mrs. Morley here kissed Isaura, resettled her crinoline, and shaking hands with the Venosta, retreated to the door.  \"I shall have the wreath yet,\" cried the Venosta, impishly.  \"_La speranza e fenamina_\" (Hope is female).  \"Alas!\" said Isaura, half mournfully, half smiling, \"alas! do you not remember what the poet replied when asked what disease was most mortal?-- 'the hectic fever caught from the chill of hope.'\"     CHAPTER III.  Graham Vane was musing very gloomily in his solitary apartment one morning, when his servant announced Colonel Morley.  He received his visitor with more than the cordiality with which every English politician receives an American citizen.  Graham liked the Colonel too well for what he was in himself to need any national title to his esteem.  After some preliminary questions and answers as to the health of Mrs. Morley, the length of the Colonel's stay in London, what day he could dine with Graham at Richmond or Gravesend, the Colonel took up the ball.  \"We have been reckoning to see you at Paris, sir, for the last six months.\"  \"I am very much flattered to hear that you have thought of me at all; but I am not aware of having warranted the expectation you so kindly express.\"  \"I guess you must have said something to my wife which led her to do more than expect--to reckon on your return.  And, by the way, sir, I am charged to deliver to you this note from her, and to back the request it contains that you will avail yourself of the offer.  Without summarising the points I do so.\"  Graham glanced over the note addressed to him       \"DEAR MR. VANE,--Do you forget how beautiful the environs of Paris      are in May and June?  how charming it was last year at the lake of      Enghien? how gay were our little dinners out of doors in the garden      arbours, with the Savarins and the fair Italian, and her      incomparably amusing chaperon?  Frank has my orders to bring you      back to renew these happy days, while the birds are in their first      song, and the leaves are in their youngest green.  I have prepared      your rooms _chez nous_--a chamber that looks out on the Champs      Elysees, and a quiet _cabinet de travail_ at the back, in which you      can read, write, or sulk undisturbed.  Come, and we will again visit      Enghien and Montmorency.  Don't talk of engagements.  If man      proposes, woman disposes.  Hesitate not--obey.  Your sincere little      friend,  Lizzy.\"  \"My dear Morley,\" said Graham, with emotion, \"I cannot find words to thank your wife sufficiently for an invitation so graciously conveyed. Alas! I cannot accept it.\"  \"Why?\" asked the Colonel, drily.  \"I have too much to do in London.\"  \"Is that the true reason, or am I to suspicion that there is anything, sir, which makes you dislike a visit to Paris?\"  The Americans enjoy the reputation of being the frankest putters of questions whom liberty of speech has yet educated into _la recherche de la verite_, and certainly Colonel Morley in this instance did not impair the national reputation.  Graham Vane's brow slightly contracted, and he bit his lip as if stung by a sudden pang; but after a moment's pause, he answered with a good- humoured smile:  \"No man who has taste enough to admire the most beautiful city, and appreciate the charms of the most brilliant society in the world, can dislike Paris.\"  \"My dear sir, I did not ask you if you disliked Paris, but if there were anything that made you dislike coming back to it on a visit.\"  \"What a notion! and what a cross-examiner you would have made if you had been called to the bar!  Surely, my dear friend, you can understand that when a man has in one place business which he cannot neglect, he may decline going to another place, whatever pleasure it would give him to do so.  By the way, there is a great ball at one of the Ministers' to-night; you should go there, and I will point out to you all those English notabilities in whom Americans naturally take interest.  I will call for you at eleven o'clock.  Lord ------, who is a connection of mine, would be charmed to know you.\"  Morley hesitated; but when Graham said, \"How your wife will scold you if you lose such an opportunity of telling her whether the Duchess of  ---- is as beautiful as report says, and whether Gladstone or Disraeli seems to your phrenological science to have the finer head!\" the Colonel gave in, and it was settled that Graham should call for him at the Langham Hotel.  That matter arranged, Graham probably hoped that his inquisitive visitor would take leave for the present, but the Colonel evinced no such intention.  On the contrary, settling himself more at ease in his arm- chair, he said, \"if I remember aright, you do not object to the odour of tobacco?\"  Graham rose and presented to his visitor a cigar-box which he took from the mantelpiece.  The Colonel shook his head, and withdrew from his breast pocket a leather case, from which he extracted a gigantic regalia; this he lighted from a gold match-box in the shape of a locket attached to his watch-chain, and took two or three preliminary puffs, with his head thrown back and his eyes meditatively intent upon the ceiling.  We know already that strange whim of the Colonel's (than whom, if he so pleased, no man could speak purer English as spoken by the Britisher) to assert the dignity of the American citizen by copious use of expressions and phrases familiar to the lips of the governing class of the great Republic--delicacies of speech which he would have carefully shunned in the polite circles of the Fifth Avenue in New York.  Now the Colonel was much too experienced a man of the world not to be aware that the commission with which his Lizzy had charged him was an exceedingly delicate one; and it occurred to his mother wit that the best way to acquit himself of it, so as to avoid the risk of giving or of receiving serious affront, would be to push that whim of his into more than wonted exaggeration.  Thus he could more decidedly and briefly come to the point; and should he, in doing so, appear too meddlesome, rather provoke a laugh than a frown-retiring from the ground with the honours due to a humorist.  Accordingly, in his deepest nasal intonation, and withdrawing his eyes from the ceiling, he began:  \"You have not asked, sir, after the signorina, or as we popularly call her, Mademoiselle Cicogna?\"  \"Have I not?  I hope she is quite well, and her lively companion, Signora Venosta.\"  \"They are not sick, sir; or at least they were not so last night when my wife and I had the pleasure to see them.  Of course you have read Mademoiselle Cicogna's book--a bright performance, sir, age considered.\"  \"Certainly, I have read the book; it is full of unquestionable genius. Is Mademoiselle writing another?  But of course she is.\"  \"I am not aware of the fact, sir.  It may be predicated; such a mind cannot remain inactive; and I know from M. Savarin and that rising young man Gustave Rameau, that the publishers bid high for her brains considerable.  Two translations have already appeared in our country. Her fame, sir, will be world-wide.  She may be another George Sand, or at least another Eulalie Grantmesnil.\"  Graham's cheek became as white as the paper I write on.  He inclined his head as in assent, but without a word.  The Colonel continued:  We ought to be very proud of her acquaintance, sir.  I think you detected"]]]
