Silver Blaze         I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we       sat down together to our breakfast one morning.        “Go! Where to?”        “To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”        I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not       already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the       one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of       England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room       with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and       recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and       absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions       of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be       glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he       was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was       brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could       challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular       disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic       murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his       intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only       what I had both expected and hoped for.        “I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in       the way,” said I.        “My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by       coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for       there are points about the case which promise to make it an       absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our       train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon       our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very       excellent field-glass.”        And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the       corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for       Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed       in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle       of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left       Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under       the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.        “We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing       at his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half       miles an hour.”        “I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.        “Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty       yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that       you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker       and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”        “I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to       say.”        “It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be       used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of       fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and       of such personal importance to so many people, that we are       suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis.       The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute       undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and       reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound       basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and       what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns.       On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross,       the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is       looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.”        “Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning.       Why didn’t you go down yesterday?”        “Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid,       a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew       me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it       possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long       remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as       the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to       hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the       murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had       come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson       nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take       action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been       wasted.”        “You have formed a theory, then?”        “At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I       shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much       as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your       co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we       start.”        I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while       Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking       off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch       of the events which had led to our journey.        “Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as       brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth       year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to       Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the       catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the       betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a       prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet       disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of       money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that       there were many people who had the strongest interest in       preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag       next Tuesday.        “The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the       Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken       to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired       jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too       heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five       years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown       himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three       lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four       horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,       while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent       characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small       villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no       children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The       country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north       there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a       Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may       wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two       miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles       distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which       belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In       every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness,       inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general       situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.        “On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as       usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the       lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in       the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a       few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to       the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried       mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the       stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink       nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very       dark and the path ran across the open moor.        “Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man       appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he       stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she       saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a       grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and       carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,       however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness       of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty       than under it.        “‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my       mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’        “‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.        “‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand       that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is       his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you       would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would       you?’ He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his       waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has this to-night, and you       shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’        “She was frightened by the earnestness of his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/834"],["title","The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (#1)"],["body",", and ran       past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand       the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the       small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had       happened, when the stranger came up again.        “‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted       to have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she       noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his       closed hand.        “‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.        “‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said       the other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze       and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a       loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the       other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have       put their money on him?’        “‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll       show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and       rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away       to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the       stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,       when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he       ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”        “One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with       the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”        “Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The       importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a       special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The       boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was       not large enough for a man to get through.        “Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent       a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker       was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to       have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,       vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,       found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said       that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the       horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see       that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could       hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her       entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.        “Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her       husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called       the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside,       huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of       absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were       no signs of his trainer.        “The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the       harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during       the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously       under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could       be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads       and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still       had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the       horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the       house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they       not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they       perceived something which warned them that they were in the       presence of a tragedy.        “About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s       overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there       was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of       this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head       had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and       he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,       inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,       however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his       assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which       was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he       clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the       maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger       who had visited the stables.        “Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive       as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that       the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his       curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.        “As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud       which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been       there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has       disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and       all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of       him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his       supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of       powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same       dish on the same night without any ill effect.        “Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise,       and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what       the police have done in the matter.        “Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an       extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination       he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival       he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion       naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for       he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His       name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent       birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,       and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making       in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his       betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand       pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.        “On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come       down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about       the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second       favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton       stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as       described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no       sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand       information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very       pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the       hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had       been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which       was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as       might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to       which the trainer had succumbed.        “On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the       state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his       assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in       a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be       infinitely obliged to you.”        I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which       Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though       most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently       appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to       each other.        “Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon       Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive       struggles which follow any brain injury?”        “It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that       case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”        “And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory       of the police can be.”        “I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave       objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I       take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and       having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable       door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of       kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson       must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind       him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was       either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.       Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick       without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker       used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on       to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during       the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the       case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all       other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall       very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and       until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than       our present position.”        It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,       which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge       circle"]]]
