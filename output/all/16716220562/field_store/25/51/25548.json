There were some blouses drinking wine, no doubt of the cheapest and thinnest; some in rough, coarse dresses, drinking beer. These were evidently English, Belgian, or German artisans.  At one table, four young men, who looked like small journeymen, were playing cards. At three other tables, men older, better dressed, probably shop-keepers, were playing dominos.  Graham scrutinized these last, but among them all could detect no one corresponding to his ideal of the Vicomte de Mauleon. \"Probably,\" thought he, \"I am too late, or perhaps he will not be here this evening.  At all events, I will wait a quarter of an hour.\"  Then, the _garcon_ approaching his table, he deemed it necessary to call for something, and, still in strong English accent, asked for lemonade and an evening journal.  The _garcon_ nodded and went his way.  A monsieur at the round table next his own politely handed to him the \"Galignani,\" saying in very good English, though unmistakably the good English of a Frenchman, \"The English journal, at your service.\"  Graham bowed his head, accepted the \"Galignani,\" and inspected his courteous neighbour.  A more respectable-looking man no Englishman could see in an English country town.  He wore an unpretending flaxen wig, with limp whiskers that met at the chin, and might originally have been the same colour as the wig, but were now of a pale gray,--no beard, no mustache.  He was dressed with the scrupulous cleanliness of a sober citizen,--a high white neckcloth, with a large old-fashioned pin, containing a little knot of hair covered with glass or crystal, and bordered with a black framework, in which were inscribed letters,-- evidently a mourning pin, hallowed to the memory of lost spouse or child, --a man who, in England, might be the mayor of a cathedral town, at least the town-clerk.  He seemed suffering from some infirmity of vision, for he wore green spectacles.  The expression of his face was very mild and gentle; apparently he was about sixty years old,--somewhat more.  Graham took kindly to his neighbour, insomuch that, in return for the \"Galignani,\" he offered him a cigar, lighting one himself.  His neighbour refused politely.   \"Merci!  I never smoke, never; _mon medecin_ forbids it.  If I could be tempted, it would be by, an English cigar.  Ah, how you English beat us in all things,--your ships, your iron, your tabac,--which you do not grow!\"  This speech rendered literally as we now render it may give the idea of a somewhat vulgar speaker.  But there was something in the man's manner, in his smile, in his courtesy, which did not strike Graham as vulgar; on the contrary, he thought within himself, \"How instinctive to all Frenchmen good breeding is!\"  Before, however, Graham had time to explain to his amiable neighbour the politico-economical principle according to which England, growing no tobacco, had tobacco much better than France, which did grow it, a rosy middle-aged monsieur made his appearance, saying hurriedly to Graham's neighbour, \"I'm afraid I'm late, but there is still a good half-hour before us if you will give me my revenge.\"  \"Willingly, Monsieur Georges. _Garcon_, the dominos.\"  \"Have you been playing at billiards?\" asked M. Georges.  \"Yes, two games.\"  \"With success?\"  \"I won the first, and lost the second through the defect of my eyesight; the game depended on a stroke which would have been easy to an infant,-- I missed it.\"  Here the dominos arrived, and M. Georges began shuffling them; the other turned to Graham and asked politely if he understood the game.  \"A little, but not enough to comprehend why it is said to require so much skill.\"  \"It is chiefly an affair of memory with me; but M. Georges, my opponent, has the talent of combination, which I have not.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" replied M. Georges, gruffly, \"you are not easily beaten; it is for you to play first, Monsieur Lebeau.\"  Graham almost started. Was it possible!  This mild, limp-whiskered, flaxen-wigged man Victor de Mauleon, the Don Juan of his time; the last person in the room he should have guessed.  Yet, now examining his neighbour with more attentive eye, he wondered at his stupidity in not having recognized at once the ci-devant _gentilhomme_ and _beau garcon_.  It happens frequently that our imagination plays us this trick; we form to ourselves an idea of some one eminent for good or for evil,--a poet, a statesman, a general, a murderer, a swindler, a thief.  The man is before us, and our ideas have gone into so different a groove that he does not excite a suspicion; we are told who he is, and immediately detect a thousand things that ought to have proved his identity.  Looking thus again with rectified vision at the false Lebeau, Graham observed an elegance and delicacy of feature which might, in youth, have made the countenance very handsome, and rendered it still good-looking, nay, prepossessing.  He now noticed, too, the slight Norman accent, its native harshness of breadth subdued into the modulated tones which bespoke the habits of polished society.  Above all, as M. Lebeau moved his dominos with one hand, not shielding his pieces with the other (as M. Georges warily did), but allowing it to rest carelessly on the table, he detected the hands of the French aristocrat,--hands that had never done work; never (like those of the English noble of equal birth) been embrowned or freckled, or roughened or enlarged by early practice in athletic sports; but hands seldom seen save in the higher circles of Parisian life,--partly perhaps of hereditary formation, partly owing their texture to great care begun in early youth, and continued mechanically in after life,--with long taper fingers and polished nails; white and delicate as those of a woman, but not slight, not feeble; nervous and sinewy as those of a practised swordsman.  Graham watched the play, and Lebeau good-naturedly explained to him its complications as it proceeded; though the explanation, diligently attended to by M. Georges, lost Lebeau the game.  The dominos were again shuffled, and during that operation M. Georges said, \"By the way, Monsieur Lebeau, you promised to find me a _locataire_ for my second floor; have you succeeded?\"  \"Not yet.  Perhaps you had better advertise in 'Les Petites Affiches.' You ask too much for the habitues of this neighbourhood,--one hundred francs a month.\"  \"But the lodging is furnished, and well too, and has four rooms.  One hundred francs are not much.\"  A thought flashed upon Graham.  \"Pardon, Monsieur,\" he said, \"have you an _appartement de garcon_ to let furnished?\"  \"Yes, Monsieur, a charming one.  Are you in search of an apartment?\"  \"I have some idea of taking one, but only by the month.  I am but just arrived at Paris, and I have business which may keep me here a few weeks. I do but require a bedroom and a small cabinet, and the rent must be modest.  I am not a milord.\"  \"I am sure we could arrange, Monsieur,\" said M. Georges, \"though I could not well divide my logement.  But one hundred francs a month is not much!\"  \"I fear it is more than I can afford; however, if you will give me your address, I will call and see the rooms,--say the day after to-morrow. Between this and then, I expect letters which may more clearly decide my movements.\"  \"If the apartments suit you,\" said M. Lebeau, \"you will at least be in the house of a very honest man, which is more than can be said of every one who lets furnished apartments.  The house, too, has a concierge, with a handy wife who will arrange your rooms and provide you with coffee--or tea, which you English prefer--if you breakfast at home.\"  Here M. Georges handed a card to Graham, and asked what hour he would call.  \"About twelve, if that hour is convenient,\" said Graham, rising.  \"I presume there is a restaurant in the neighbourhood where I could dine reasonably.\"  \"_Je crois bien_, half-a-dozen.  I can recommend to you one where you can dine _en prince_ for thirty sous.  And if you are at Paris on business, and want any letters written in private, I can also recommend to you my friend here, M. Lebeau.  Ay, and on affairs his advice is as good as a lawyer's, and his fee a bagatelle.\"  \"Don't believe all that Monsieur Georges so flatteringly says of me,\" put in M. Lebeau, with a modest half-smile, and in English.  \"I should tell you that I, like yourself, am recently arrived at Paris, having bought the business and goodwill of my predecessor in the apartment I occupy; and it is only to the respect due to his antecedents, and on the score of a few letters of recommendation which I bring from Lyons, that I can attribute the confidence shown to me, a stranger in this neighbourhood. Still I have some knowledge of the world, and I am always glad if I can be of service to the English.  I love the English\"--he said this with a sort of melancholy earnestness which seemed sincere; and then added in a more careless tone,--\"I have met with much kindness from them in the course of a chequered life.\"  \"You seem a very good fellow,--in fact, a regular trump, Monsieur Lebeau,\" replied Graham, in the same language.  \"Give me your address. To say truth, I am a very poor French scholar, as you must have seen, and am awfully bother-headed how to manage some correspondence on matters with which I am entrusted by my employer, so that it is a lucky chance which has brought me acquainted with you.\"  M. Lebeau inclined his head gracefully, and drew from a very neat morocco case a card, which Graham took and pocketed.  Then he paid for his coffee and lemonade, and returned home well satisfied with the evening's adventure.     CHAPTER VII.  The next morning Graham sent for M. Renard, and consulted with that experienced functionary as to the details of the plan of action which he had revolved during the hours of a sleepless night.  \"In conformity with your advice,\" said he, \"not to expose myself to the chance of future annoyance, by confiding to a man so "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7741"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 05 (#0)"],["body","PARISIANS                           By Edward Bulwer-Lytton                                    BOOK V.   CHAPTER I.  The next day at noon M. Louvier was closeted in his study with M. Gandrin.  \"Yes,\" cried Louvier, \"I have behaved very handsomely to the _beau Marquis_.  No one can say to the contrary.\"  \"True,\" answered Gandrin.  \"Besides the easy terms for the transfer of the mortgages, that free bonus of one thousand louis is a generous and noble act of munificence.\"  \"Is it not! and my youngster has already begun to do with it as I meant and expected.  He has taken a fine apartment; he has bought a coupe and horses; he has placed himself in the hands of the Chevalier de Finisterre; he is entered at the Jockey Club.  Parbleu, the one thousand louis will be soon gone.\"  \"And then?\"  \"And then!  why, he will have tasted the sweets of Parisian life; he will think with disgust of the _vieux manoir_.  He can borrow no more.  I must remain sole mortgagee, and I shall behave as handsomely in buying his estates as I have behaved in increasing his income.\"  Here a clerk entered and said that a monsieur wished to see M. Louvier for a few minutes in private, on urgent business.  \"Tell him to send in his card.\"  \"He has declined to do so, but states that he has already the honour of your acquaintance.\"  \"A writer in the press, perhaps; or is he an artist?\"  \"I have not seen him before, Monsieur, but he has the air _tres comme il faut_.\"  \"Well, you may admit him.  I will not detain you longer, my dear Gandrin. My homages to Madame.  Bonjour.\"  Louvier bowed out M. Gandrin, and then rubbed his hands complacently.  He was in high spirits.  \"Aha, my dear Marquis, thou art in my trap now. Would it were thy father instead,\" he muttered chucklingly, and then took his stand on the hearth, with his back to the fireless grate.  There entered a gentleman exceedingly well dressed,--dressed according to the fashion, but still as became one of ripe middle age, not desiring to pass for younger than he was.  He was tall, with a kind of lofty ease in his air and his movements; not slight of frame, but spare enough to disguise the strength and endurance which belong to sinews and thews of steel, freed from all superfluous flesh, broad across the shoulders, thin in the flanks.  His dark hair had in youth been luxuriant in thickness and curl; it was now clipped short, and had become bare at the temples, but it still retained the lustre of its colour and the crispness of its ringlets.  He wore neither beard nor mustache, and the darkness of his hair was contrasted by a clear fairness of complexion, healthful, though somewhat pale, and eyes of that rare gray tint which has in it no shade of blue,--peculiar eyes, which give a very distinct character to the face.  The man must have been singularly handsome in youth; he was handsome still, though probably in his forty- seventh or forty-eighth year, doubtless a very different kind of comeliness.  The form of the features and the contour of the face were those that suit the rounded beauty of the Greek outline, and such beauty would naturally have been the attribute of the countenance in earlier days; but the cheeks were now thin, and with lines of care and sorrow between nostril and lip, so that the shape of the face seemed lengthened, and the features had become more salient.  Louvier gazed at his visitor with a vague idea that he had seen him before, and could not remember where or when; but at all events he recognized at the first glance a man of rank and of the great world.  \"Pray be seated, Monsieur,\" he said, resuming his own easy-chair.  The visitor obeyed the invitation with a very graceful bend of his head, drew his chair near to the financier's, stretched his limbs with the ease of a man making himself at home, and fixing his calm bright eyes quietly on Louvier, said, with a bland smile,--  \"My dear old friend, do you not remember me?  You are less altered than I am.\"  Louvier stared hard and long; his lip fell, his cheek paled, and at last he faltered out, \"Ciel! is it possible!  Victor, the Vicomte de Mauleon?\"  \"At your service, my dear Louvier.\"  There was a pause; the financier was evidently confused and embarrassed, and not less evidently the visit of the \"dear old friend\" was unwelcome.  \"Vicomte,\" he said at last, \"this is indeed a surprise; I thought you had long since quitted Paris for good.\"  \"'L'homme propose,' etc.  I have returned, and mean to enjoy the rest of my days in the metropolis of the Graces and the Pleasures.  What though we are not so young as we were, Louvier,--we have more vigour in us than the new generation; and though it may no longer befit us to renew the gay carousals of old, life has still excitements as vivid for the social temperament and ambitious mind.  Yes, the _roi des viveurs_ returns to Paris for a more solid throne than he filled before.\"  \"Are you serious?\"  \"As serious as the French gayety will permit one to be.\"  \"Alas, Monsieur le Vicomte! can you flatter yourself that you will regain the society you have quitted, and the name you have--\"  Louvier stopped short; something in the Vicomte's eye daunted him.  \"The name I have laid aside for convenience of travel.  Princes travel incognito, and so may a simple _gentilhomme_.  'Regain my place in society,' say you?  Yes; it is not that which troubles me.\"  \"What does?\"  \"The consideration whether on a very modest income I can be sufficiently esteemed for myself to render that society more pleasant than ever.  Ah, _mon cher_! why recoil? why so frightened?  Do you think I am going to ask you for money?  Have I ever done so since we parted; and did I ever do so before without repaying you?  Bah! you _roturiers_ are worse than the Bourbons.  You never learn or unlearn.  'Fors non mutat genus.'\"  The magnificent _millionaire_, accustomed to the homage of grandees from the Faubourg and _lions_ from the Chaussee d'Antin, rose to his feet in superb wrath, less at the taunting words than at the haughtiness of mien with which they were uttered.  \"Monsieur, I cannot permit you to address me in that tone.  Do you mean to insult me?\"  \"Certainly not.  Tranquillize your nerves, reseat yourself, and listen,-- reseat yourself, I say.\"  Louvier dropped into his chair.  \"No,\" resumed the Vicomte, politely, \"I do not come here to insult you, neither do I come to ask money; I assume that I am in my rights when I ask Monsieur Louvier what has become of Louise Duval?\"  \"Louise Duval! I know nothing about her.\"  \"Possibly not now; but you did know her well enough, when we two parted, to be a candidate for her hand.  You did know her enough to solicit my good offices in promotion of your suit; and you did, at my advice, quit Paris to seek her at Aix-la-Chapelle.\"  \"What! have you, Monsieur de Mauleon, not heard news of her since that day?\"  \"I decline to accept your question as an answer to mine.  You went to Aix-la-Chapelle; you saw Louise Duval, at my urgent request she condescended to accept your hand.\"  \"No, Monsieur de Mauleon, she did not accept my hand.  I did not even see her.  The day before I arrived at Aix-la-Chapelle she had left it,--not alone,--left it with her lover.\"  \"Her lover!  You do not mean the miserable Englishman who--\"  \"No Englishman,\" interrupted Louvier, fiercely.  \"Enough that the step she took placed an eternal barrier between her and myself.  I have never even sought to hear of her since that day.  Vicomte, that woman was the one love of my life.  I loved her, as you must have known, to folly, to madness.  And how was my love requited?  Ah! you open a very deep wound, Monsieur le Vicomte.\"  \"Pardon me, Louvier; I did not give you credit for feelings so keen and so genuine, nor did I think myself thus easily affected by matters belonging to a past life so remote from the present.  For whom did Louise forsake you?\"  \"It matters not; he is dead.\"  \"I regret to hear that; I might have avenged you.\"  \"I need no one to avenge my wrong.  Let this pass.\"  \"Not yet.  Louise, you say, fled with a seducer?  So proud as she was, I can scarcely believe it.\"  \"Oh, it was not with a _roturier_ she fled; her pride would not have allowed that.\"  \"He must have deceived her somehow.  Did she continue to live with him?\"  \"That question, at least, I can answer; for though I lost all trace of her life, his life was pretty well known to me till its end; and a very few months after she fled he was enchained to another.  Let us talk of her no more.\"  \"Ay, ay,\" muttered De Mauleon, \"some disgraces are not to be redeemed, and therefore not to be discussed.  To me, though a relation, Louise Duval was but little known, and after what you tell me, I cannot dispute your right to say, 'Talk of her no more.'  You loved her, and she wronged you.  My poor Louvier, pardon me if I made an old wound bleed afresh.\"  These words were said with a certain pathetic tenderness; they softened Louvier towards the speaker.  After a short pause the Vicomte swept his hand over his brow, as if to dismiss from his mind a painful and obtrusive thought; then with a changed expression of countenance,--an expression frank and winning,-- with voice and with manner in which no vestige remained of the irony or the haughtiness with which he had resented the frigidity of his reception, he drew his chair still nearer to Louvier's, and resumed: \"Our situations, Paul Louvier, are much changed since we two became friends. I then could say, 'Open sesame' to whatever recesses, forbidden to vulgar footsteps, the adventurer whom I took by the hand might wish to explore. In those days my heart was warm; I liked you, Louvier,--honestly liked you.  I think our personal acquaintance commenced in some gay gathering of young viveurs, whose behaviour to you offended my sense of good breeding?\"  Louvier coloured and muttered inaudibly.  De Mauleon continued: \"I felt it due to you to rebuke their incivilities, the more so as you evinced on that occasion"]]]
