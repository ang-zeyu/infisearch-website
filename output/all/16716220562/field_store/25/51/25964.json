Ah! it was a bad day that ever       he took a glass in his hand again. First he dropped me, then he       quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we       don’t know how things are going with them.”        It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which       she felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life,       she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely       communicative. She told us many details about her brother-in-law       the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former       lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of       their delinquencies, with their names and those of their       hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in       a question from time to time.        “About your second sister, Sarah,” said he. “I wonder, since you       are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.”        “Ah! you don’t know Sarah’s temper or you would wonder no more. I       tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two       months ago, when we had to part. I don’t want to say a word       against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to       please, was Sarah.”        “You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.”        “Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. Why, she       went up there to live in order to be near them. And now she has       no word hard enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she       was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his       ways. He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit       of his mind, and that was the start of it.”        “Thank you, Miss Cushing,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Your       sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street Wallington?       Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled       over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to       do.”        There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.        “How far to Wallington?” he asked.        “Only about a mile, sir.”        “Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is       hot. Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very       instructive details in connection with it. Just pull up at a       telegraph office as you pass, cabby.”        Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay       back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the       sun from his face. Our driver pulled up at a house which was not       unlike the one which we had just quitted. My companion ordered       him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door       opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny       hat, appeared on the step.        “Is Miss Cushing at home?” asked Holmes.        “Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,” said he. “She has been       suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity.       As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility       of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call       again in ten days.” He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and       marched off down the street.        “Well, if we can’t we can’t,” said Holmes, cheerfully.        “Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.”        “I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at       her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us       to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and       afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the       police-station.”        We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would       talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation       how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at       least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker’s in Tottenham Court       Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we       sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote       after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far       advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before       we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting       for us at the door.        “A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,” said he.        “Ha! It is the answer!” He tore it open, glanced his eyes over       it, and crumpled it into his pocket. “That’s all right,” said he.        “Have you found out anything?”        “I have found out everything!”        “What!” Lestrade stared at him in amazement. “You are joking.”        “I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been       committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.”        “And the criminal?”        Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting       cards and threw it over to Lestrade.        “That is the name,” he said. “You cannot effect an arrest until       to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not       mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose       to be only associated with those crimes which present some       difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.” We strode off       together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a       delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.        “The case,” said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars       that night in our rooms at Baker Street, “is one where, as in the       investigations which you have chronicled under the names of ‘A       Study in Scarlet’ and of ‘The Sign of Four,’ we have been       compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. I have       written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details       which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has       secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for       although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as       a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and,       indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top       at Scotland Yard.”        “Your case is not complete, then?” I asked.        “It is fairly complete in essentials. We know who the author of       the revolting business is, although one of the victims still       escapes us. Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”        “I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool       boat, is the man whom you suspect?”        “Oh! it is more than a suspicion.”        “And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.”        “On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. Let me       run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you       remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an       advantage. We had formed no theories. We were simply there to       observe and to draw inferences from our observations. What did we       see first? A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite       innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she       had two younger sisters. It instantly flashed across my mind that       the box might have been meant for one of these. I set the idea       aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our       leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw       the very singular contents of the little yellow box.        “The string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard       ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our       investigation. When I observed that the knot was one which is       popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port,       and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much       more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that       all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our       seafaring classes.        “When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that       it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of       course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was ‘S’ it       might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should       have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether.       I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up       this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was       convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that       I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen       something which filled me with surprise and at the same time       narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.        “As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part       of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as       a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last       year’s _Anthropological Journal_ you will find two short       monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore,       examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had       carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my       surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that       her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just       inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was       the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the       upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all       essentials it was the same ear.        “Of course I at once saw the enormous importance of the       observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation       and probably a very close one. I began to talk to her about her       family, and you remember that she at once gave us some       exceedingly valuable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/836"],["title","The Phoenix and the Carpet (#0)"],["body","PHOENIX AND THE CARPET  E.

THE EGG   It began with the day when it was almost the Fifth of November, and a doubt arose in some breast--Robert’s, I fancy--as to the quality of the fireworks laid in for the Guy Fawkes celebration.  ‘They were jolly cheap,’ said whoever it was, and I think it was Robert, ‘and suppose they didn’t go off on the night? Those Prosser kids would have something to snigger about then.’  ‘The ones _I_ got are all right,’ Jane said; ‘I know they are, because the man at the shop said they were worth thribble the money--’  ‘I’m sure thribble isn’t grammar,’ Anthea said.  ‘Of course it isn’t,’ said Cyril; ‘one word can’t be grammar all by itself, so you needn’t be so jolly clever.’  Anthea was rummaging in the corner-drawers of her mind for a very disagreeable answer, when she remembered what a wet day it was, and how the boys had been disappointed of that ride to London and back on the top of the tram, which their mother had promised them as a reward for not having once forgotten, for six whole days, to wipe their boots on the mat when they came home from school.  So Anthea only said, ‘Don’t be so jolly clever yourself, Squirrel. And the fireworks look all right, and you’ll have the eightpence that your tram fares didn’t cost to-day, to buy something more with. You ought to get a perfectly lovely Catharine wheel for eightpence.’  ‘I daresay,’ said Cyril, coldly; ‘but it’s not YOUR eightpence anyhow--’  ‘But look here,’ said Robert, ‘really now, about the fireworks. We don’t want to be disgraced before those kids next door. They think because they wear red plush on Sundays no one else is any good.’  ‘I wouldn’t wear plush if it was ever so--unless it was black to be beheaded in, if I was Mary Queen of Scots,’ said Anthea, with scorn.  Robert stuck steadily to his point. One great point about Robert is the steadiness with which he can stick.  ‘I think we ought to test them,’ he said.  ‘You young duffer,’ said Cyril, ‘fireworks are like postage-stamps. You can only use them once.’  ‘What do you suppose it means by “Carter’s tested seeds” in the advertisement?’  There was a blank silence. Then Cyril touched his forehead with his finger and shook his head.  ‘A little wrong here,’ he said. ‘I was always afraid of that with poor Robert. All that cleverness, you know, and being top in algebra so often--it’s bound to tell--’  ‘Dry up,’ said Robert, fiercely. ‘Don’t you see? You can’t TEST seeds if you do them ALL. You just take a few here and there, and if those grow you can feel pretty sure the others will be--what do you call it?--Father told me--“up to sample”. Don’t you think we ought to sample the fire-works? Just shut our eyes and each draw one out, and then try them.’  ‘But it’s raining cats and dogs,’ said Jane.  ‘And Queen Anne is dead,’ rejoined Robert. No one was in a very good temper. ‘We needn’t go out to do them; we can just move back the table, and let them off on the old tea-tray we play toboggans with. I don’t know what YOU think, but _I_ think it’s time we did something, and that would be really useful; because then we shouldn’t just HOPE the fireworks would make those Prossers sit up--we should KNOW.’  ‘It WOULD be something to do,’ Cyril owned with languid approval.  So the table was moved back. And then the hole in the carpet, that had been near the window till the carpet was turned round, showed most awfully. But Anthea stole out on tip-toe, and got the tray when cook wasn’t looking, and brought it in and put it over the hole.  Then all the fireworks were put on the table, and each of the four children shut its eyes very tight and put out its hand and grasped something. Robert took a cracker, Cyril and Anthea had Roman candles; but Jane’s fat paw closed on the gem of the whole collection, the Jack-in-the-box that had cost two shillings, and one at least of the party--I will not say which, because it was sorry afterwards--declared that Jane had done it on purpose. Nobody was pleased. For the worst of it was that these four children, with a very proper dislike of anything even faintly bordering on the sneakish, had a law, unalterable as those of the Medes and Persians, that one had to stand by the results of a toss-up, or a drawing of lots, or any other appeal to chance, however much one might happen to dislike the way things were turning out.  ‘I didn’t mean to,’ said Jane, near tears. ‘I don’t care, I’ll draw another--’  ‘You know jolly well you can’t,’ said Cyril, bitterly. ‘It’s settled. It’s Medium and Persian. You’ve done it, and you’ll have to stand by it--and us too, worse luck. Never mind. YOU’LL have your pocket-money before the Fifth. Anyway, we’ll have the Jack-in-the-box LAST, and get the most out of it we can.’  So the cracker and the Roman candles were lighted, and they were all that could be expected for the money; but when it came to the Jack-in-the-box it simply sat in the tray and laughed at them, as Cyril said. They tried to light it with paper and they tried to light it with matches; they tried to light it with Vesuvian fusees from the pocket of father’s second-best overcoat that was hanging in the hall. And then Anthea slipped away to the cupboard under the stairs where the brooms and dustpans were kept, and the rosiny fire-lighters that smell so nice and like the woods where pine-trees grow, and the old newspapers and the bees-wax and turpentine, and the horrid an stiff dark rags that are used for cleaning brass and furniture, and the paraffin for the lamps. She came back with a little pot that had once cost sevenpence-halfpenny when it was full of red-currant jelly; but the jelly had been all eaten long ago, and now Anthea had filled the jar with paraffin. She came in, and she threw the paraffin over the tray just at the moment when Cyril was trying with the twenty-third match to light the Jack-in-the-box. The Jack-in-the-box did not catch fire any more than usual, but the paraffin acted quite differently, and in an instant a hot flash of flame leapt up and burnt off Cyril’s eyelashes, and scorched the faces of all four before they could spring back. They backed, in four instantaneous bounds, as far as they could, which was to the wall, and the pillar of fire reached from floor to ceiling.  ‘My hat,’ said Cyril, with emotion, ‘You’ve done it this time, Anthea.’  The flame was spreading out under the ceiling like the rose of fire in Mr Rider Haggard’s exciting story about Allan Quatermain. Robert and Cyril saw that no time was to be lost. They turned up the edges of the carpet, and kicked them over the tray. This cut off the column of fire, and it disappeared and there was nothing left but smoke and a dreadful smell of lamps that have been turned too low.  All hands now rushed to the rescue, and the paraffin fire was only a bundle of trampled carpet, when suddenly a sharp crack beneath their feet made the amateur firemen start back. Another crack--the carpet moved as if it had had a cat wrapped in it; the Jack-in-the-box had at last allowed itself to be lighted, and it was going off with desperate violence inside the carpet.  Robert, with the air of one doing the only possible thing, rushed to the window and opened it. Anthea screamed, Jane burst into tears, and Cyril turned the table wrong way up on top of the carpet heap. But the firework went on, banging and bursting and spluttering even underneath the table.  Next moment mother rushed in, attracted by the howls of Anthea, and in a few moments the firework desisted and there was a dead silence, and the children stood looking at each other’s black faces, and, out of the corners of their eyes, at mother’s white one.  The fact that the nursery carpet was ruined occasioned but little surprise, nor was any one really astonished that bed should prove the immediate end of the adventure. It has been said that all roads lead to Rome; this may be true, but at any rate, in early youth I am quite sure that many roads lead to BED, and stop there--or YOU do.  The rest of the fireworks were confiscated, and mother was not pleased when father let them off himself in the back garden, though he said, ‘Well, how else can you get rid of them, my dear?’  You see, father had forgotten that the children were in disgrace, and that their bedroom windows looked out on to the back garden. So that they all saw the fireworks most beautifully, and admired the skill with which father handled them.  Next day all was forgotten and forgiven; only the nursery had to be deeply cleaned (like spring-cleaning), and the ceiling had to be whitewashed.  And mother went out; and just at tea-time next day a man came with a rolled-up carpet, and father paid him, and mother said--  ‘If the carpet isn’t in good condition, you know, I shall expect you to change it.’ And the man replied--  ‘There ain’t a thread gone in it nowhere, mum. It’s a bargain, if"]]]
