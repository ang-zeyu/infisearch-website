Raoul and the Christian brothers found him insensible among a heap of the slain.\"  \"M. de Vandemar seems to have very soon recovered the shock of his poor brother's death,\" said Madame Rameau.  \"There is very little heart in an aristocrat.\"  The Abbe's mild brow contracted.  \"Have more charity, my daughter.  It is because Raoul's sorrow for his lost brother is so deep and so holy that he devotes himself more than ever to the service of the Father which is in heaven.  He said, a day or two after the burial, when plans for a monument to Enguerrand were submitted to him: 'May my prayer be vouchsafed, and my life be a memorial of him more acceptable to his gentle spirit than monuments of bronze or marble.  May I be divinely guided and sustained in my desire to do such good acts as he would have done had he been spared longer to earth.  And whenever tempted to weary, may my conscience whisper, Betray not the trust left to thee by thy brother, lest thou be not reunited to him at last.\"'  \"Pardon me, pardon!\" murmured Madame Rameau humbly, while the Venosta burst into tears.  The Abbe, though a most sincere and earnest ecclesiastic, was a cheery and genial man of the world; and, in order to relieve Madame Rameau from the painful self-reproach he had before excited, he turned the conversation.  \"I must beware, however,\" he said, with his pleasant laugh, \"as to the company in which I interfere in family questions; and especially in which I defend my poor Raoul from any charge brought against him.  For some good friend this day sent me a terrible organ of communistic philosophy, in which we humble priests are very roughly handled, and I myself am especially singled out by name as a pestilent intermeddler in the affairs of private households.  I am said to set the women against the brave men who are friends of the people, and am cautioned by very truculent threats to cease from such villainous practices.\"  And here, with a dry humour that turned into ridicule what would otherwise have excited disgust and indignation among his listeners, he read aloud passages replete with the sort of false eloquence which was then the vogue among the Red journals.  In these passages, not only the Abbe was pointed out for popular execration, but Raoul de Vandemar, though not expressly named, was clearly indicated as a pupil of the Abbe's, the type of a lay Jesuit.  The Venosta alone did not share in the contemptuous laughter with which the inflated style of these diatribes inspired the Rameaus.  Her simple Italian mind was horror-stricken by language which the Abbe treated with ridicule.  \"Ah!\"  said M. Rameau, \"I guess the author--that firebrand Felix Pyat.\"  \"No,\" answered the Abbe; \"the writer signs himself by the name of a more learned atheist--Diderot le jeune.\"  Here the door opened, and Raoul entered, accompanying Isaura.  A change had come over the face of the young Vandemar since his brother's death.  The lines about the mouth had deepened, the cheeks had lost their rounded contour and grown somewhat hollow.  But the expression was as serene as ever, perhaps even less pensively melancholy.  His whole aspect was that of a man who has sorrowed, but been supported in sorrow; perhaps it was more sweet- certainly it was more lofty.  And, as if there were in the atmosphere of his presence something that communicated the likeness of his own soul to others, since Isaura had been brought into his companionship, her own lovely face had caught the expression that prevailed in his--that, too, had become more sweet--that, too, had become more lofty.  The friendship that had grown up between these two young mourners was of a very rare nature.  It had in it no sentiment that could ever warm into the passion of human love.  Indeed, had Isaura's heart been free to give away, love for Raoul de Vandemar would have seemed to her a profanation. He was never more priestly than when he was most tender.  And the tenderness of Raoul towards her was that of some saint-like nature towards the acolyte whom it attracted upwards.  He had once, just before Enguerrand's death, spoken to Isaura with a touching candour as to his own predilection for a monastic life.  \"The worldly avocations that open useful and honourable careers for others have no charm for me.  I care not for riches nor power, nor honours nor fame.  The austerities of the conventual life have no terror for me; on the contrary, they have a charm, for with them are abstraction from earth and meditation on heaven. In earlier years I might, like other men, have cherished dreams of human love, and felicity in married life, but for the sort of veneration with which I regarded one to whom I owe--humanly speaking--whatever of good there may be in me.  Just when first taking my place among the society of young men who banish from their life all thought of another, I came under the influence of a woman who taught me to see that holiness was beauty. She gradually associated me with her acts of benevolence, and from her I learned to love God too well not to be indulgent to his creatures.  I know not whether the attachment I felt to her could have been inspired in one who had not from childhood conceived a romance, not perhaps justified by history, for the ideal images of chivalry.  My feeling for her at first was that of the pure and poetic homage which a young knight was permitted, _sans reproche_, to render to some fair queen or chatelaine, whose colours he wore in the lists, whose spotless repute he would have perilled his life to defend.  But soon even that sentiment, pure as it was, became chastened from all breath of earthly love, in proportion as the admiration refined itself into reverence.  She has often urged me to marry, but I have no bride on this earth.  I do but want to see Enguerrand happily married, and then I quit the world for the cloister.\"  But after Enguerrand's death, Raoul resigned all idea of the convent. That evening, as he attended to their homes Isaura and the other ladies at  to the ambulance, he said, in answer to inquiries about his mother, \"She is resigned and calm.  I have promised her I will not, while she lives, bury her other son: I renounce my dreams of the monastery.\"  Raoul did not remain many minutes at Isaura's.  The Abbe accompanied him on his way home.  \"I have a request to make to you,\" said the former; \"you know, of course, your distant cousin the Vicomte de Mauleon?\"  \"Yes.  Not so well as I ought, for Enguerrand liked him.\"  \"Well enough, at all events, to call on him with a request which I am commissioned to make, but it might come better from you as a kinsman.  I am a stranger to him, and I know not whether a man of that sort would not regard as an officious intermeddling any communication made to him by a priest.  The matter, however, is a very simple one.  At the convent of ------- there is a poor nun who is, I fear, dying.  She has an intense desire to see M. de Mauleon, whom she declares to be her uncle, and her only surviving relative.  The laws of the convent are not too austere to prevent the interview she seeks in such a case.  I should add that I am not acquainted with her previous history.  I am not the confessor of the sisterhood; he, poor man, was badly wounded by a chance ball a few days ago when attached to an ambulance on the ramparts.  As soon as the surgeon would allow him to see any one, he sent for me, and bade me go to the nun I speak of--Sister Ursula.  It seems that he had informed her that M. de Mauleon was at Paris, and had promised to ascertain his address.  His wound had prevented his doing so, but he trusted to me to procure the information.  I am well acquainted with the Superieure of the convent, and I flatter myself that she holds me in esteem.  I had therefore no difficulty to obtain her permission to see this poor nun, which I did this evening.  She implored me for the peace of her soul to lose no time in finding out M. de Mauleon's address, and entreating him to visit her.  Lest he should demur, I was to give him the name by which he had known her in the world--Louise Duval.  Of course I obeyed.  The address of a man who has so distinguished himself in this unhappy siege I very easily obtained, and repaired at once to M. de Mauleon's apartment. I there learned that he was from home, and it was uncertain whether he would not spend the night on the ramparts.\"  \"I will not fail to see him early in the morning,\" said Raoul, \"and execute your commission.\"     CHAPTER IV.  M. Mauleon was somewhat surprised by Raoul's visit the next morning.  He had no great liking for a kinsman whose politely distant reserve towards him, in contrast to poor Euguerrand's genial heartiness, had much wounded his sensitive self-respect; nor could he comprehend the religious scruples which forbade Raoul to take a soldier's share in the battle- field, though in seeking there to save the lives of others so fearlessly hazarding his own life.  \"Pardon,\" said Raoul, with his sweet mournful smile, \"the unseasonable hour at which I disturb you.  But your duties on the ramparts and mine in the hospital begin early, and I have promised the Abbe Vertpre to communicate a message of a nature which perhaps you may deem pressing.\" He proceeded at once to repeat what the Abbe had communicated to him the night before relative to the illness and the request of the nun.  \"Louise Duval!\" exclaimed the Vicomte, \"discovered at last, and a religieuse!  Ah! I now understand why she never sought me out when I reappeared at Paris.  Tidings of that sort do not penetrate the walls of a convent.  I am greatly obliged to you, M. de Vandemar, for the trouble you have so kindly taken.  This poor nun is related to me, and I will at once obey the summons.  But this convent des ------- I am ashamed to say I know not where it is.  A long way off, I suppose?\"  \"Allow me to be your guide,\" said Raoul; \"I should take it as a favour to be allowed to see a little more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7748"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 12 (#5)"],["body"," a man whom my lost brother held in such esteem.\"  Victor was touched by this conciliatory speech, and in a few minutes more the two men were on their way to the convent on the other side of the Seine.  Victor commenced the conversation by a warm and heartfelt tribute to Euguerrand's character and memory.  \"I never,\" he said, \"knew a nature more rich in the most endearing qualities of youth; so gentle, so high- spirited, rendering every virtue more attractive, and redeeming such few faults or foibles as youth so situated and so tempted cannot wholly escape, with an urbanity not conventional, not artificial, but reflected from the frankness of a genial temper and the tenderness of a generous heart.  Be comforted for his loss, my kinsman.  A brave death was the proper crown of that beautiful life.\"  Raoul made no answer, but pressed gratefully the arm now linked within his own.  The companions walked on in silence; Victor's mind settling on the visit he was about to make to the niece so long mysteriously lost, and now so unexpectedly found.  Louise had inspired him with a certain interest from her beauty and force of character, but never with any warm affection.  He felt relieved to find that her life had found its close in the sanctuary of the convent.  He had never divested himself of a certain fear, inspired by Louvier's statement that she might live to bring scandal and disgrace on the name he had with so much difficulty, and after so lengthened an anguish, partially cleared in his own person.  Raoul left De Mauleon at the gate of the convent, and took his way towards the hospitals where he visited, and the poor whom he relieved.  Victor was conducted silently into the convent _parloir_; and, after waiting there several minutes, the door opened, and the _Superieure_ entered.  As she advanced towards him, with stately step and solemn visage, De Mauleon recoiled, and uttered a half-suppressed exclamation that partook both of amaze and awe.  Could it be possible?  Was this majestic woman, with the grave impassible aspect, once the ardent girl whose tender letters he had cherished through stormy years, and only burned on the night before the most perilous of his battle-fields?  This the one, the sole one, whom in his younger dreams he had seen as his destined wife?  It was so--it was.  Doubt vanished when he heard her voice; and yet how different every tone, every accent, from those of the low, soft, thrilling music that had breathed in the voice of old!  \"M. de Mauleon,\" said the Superieure, calmly, \"I grieve to sadden you by very mournful intelligence.  Yesterday evening, when the Abbe undertook to convey to you the request of our Sister Ursula, although she was beyond mortal hope of recovery--as otherwise you will conceive that I could not have relaxed the rules of this house so as to sanction your visit--there was no apprehension of immediate danger.  It was believed that her sufferings would be prolonged for some days.  I saw her late last night before retiring to my cell, and she seemed even stronger than she had been for the last week.  A sister remained at watch in her cell. Towards morning she fell into apparently quiet sleep, and in that sleep she passed away.\"  The Superieure here crossed herself, and murmured pious words in Latin.  \"Dead!  my poor niece!\" said Victor, feelingly, roused from his stun at the first sight of the Superieure by her measured tones, and the melancholy information she so composedly conveyed to him. \"I cannot, then, even learn why she so wished to see me once more,--or what she might have requested at my hands!\"  \"Pardon, M. le Vicomte.  Such sorrowful consolation I have resolved to afford you, not without scruples of conscience, but not without sanction of the excellent Abbe Vertpre, whom I summoned early this morning to decide my duties in the sacred office I hold.  As soon as Sister Ursula heard of your return to Paris, she obtained my permission to address to you a letter, subjected, when finished, to my perusal and sanction.  She felt that she had much on her mind which her feeble state might forbid her to make known to you in conversation with 'sufficient fulness; and as she could only have seen you in presence of one of the sisters she imagined that there would also be less restraint in a written communication.  In fine, her request was that, when you called, I might first place this letter in your hands, and allow you time to read it, before being admitted to her presence; when a few words conveying your promise to attend to the wishes with which you would then be acquainted, would suffice for an interview in her exhausted condition.  Do I make myself understood?\"  \"Certainly, Madame,--and the letter?\"  \"She had concluded last evening; and when I took leave of her later in the night, she placed it in my hands for approval.  M. le Vicomte, it pains me to say that there is much in the tone of that letter which I grieve for and condemn.  And it was my intention to point this out to our sister at morning, and tell her that passages must be altered before I could give to you the letter.  Her sudden decease deprived me of this opportunity.  I could not, of course, alter or erase a line--a word.  My only option was to suppress the letter altogether, or give it you intact. The Abbe thinks that, on the whole, my duty does not forbid the dictate of my own impulse--my own feelings; and I now place this letter in your hands.\"  De Mauleon took a packet, unsealed, from the thin white fingers of the Superieure; and as he bent to receive it, lifted towards her eyes eloquent with sorrowful, humble pathos, in which it was impossible for the heart of a woman who had loved not to see a reference to the past which the lips did not dare to utter.  A faint, scarce-perceptible blush stole over the marble cheek of the nun. But, with an exquisite delicacy, in which survived the woman while reigned the nun, she replied to the appeal.  \"M. Victor de Mauleon, before, having thus met, we part for ever, permit a poor _religieuse_ to say with what joy--a joy rendered happier because it was tearful--I have learned through the Abbe Vertpre that the honour which, as between man and man, no one who had once known you could ever doubt, you have lived to vindicate from calumny.\"  \"Ah; you have heard that--at last, at last!\"  \"I repeat--of the honour thus deferred, I never doubted.\"  The Superieure hurried on.  \"Greater joy it has been to me to hear from the same venerable source that, while found bravest among the defenders of your country, you are clear from all alliance with the assailants of your God. Continue so, continue so, Victor de Mauleon,\"  She retreated to the door, and then turned towards him with a look in which all the marble had melted away, adding, with words more formally nunlike, yet unmistakably womanlike, than those which had gone before, \"That to the last you may be true to God, is a prayer never by me omitted.\"  She spoke, and vanished.  In a kind of dim and dreamlike bewilderment, Victor de Mauleon found himself without the walls of the convent.  Mechanically, as a man does when the routine of his life is presented to him, from the first Minister of State to the poor clown at a suburban theatre, doomed to appear at their posts, to prose on a Beer Bill, or grin through a horse-collar, though their hearts are bleeding at every pore with some household or secret affliction,--mechanically De Mauldon went his way towards the ramparts, at a section of which he daily drilled his raw recruits. Proverbial for his severity towards those who offended, for the cordiality of his praise of those who pleased his soldierly judgment, no change of his demeanour was visible that morning, save that he might be somewhat milder to the one, somewhat less hearty to the other.  This routine duty done, he passed slowly towards a more deserted because a more exposed part of the defences, and seated himself on the frozen sward alone.  The cannon thundered around him.  He heard unconsciously: from time to time an _obus_ hissed and splintered close at his feet;--he saw with abstracted eye.  His soul was with the past; and, brooding over all that in the past lay buried there, came over him a conviction of the vanity of the human earth-bounded objects for which we burn or freeze, far more absolute than had grown out of the worldly cynicism connected with his worldly ambition.  The sight of that face, associated with the one pure romance of his reckless youth, the face of one so estranged, so serenely aloft from all memories of youth, of romance, of passion, smote him in the midst of the new hopes of the new career, as the look on the skull of the woman he had so loved and so mourned, when disburied from her grave, smote the brilliant noble who became the stern reformer of La Trappe.  And while thus gloomily meditating, the letter of the poor Louise Duval was forgotten.  She whose existence had so troubled, and crossed, and partly marred the lives of others,--she, scarcely dead, and already forgotten by her nearest kin.  Well--had she not forgotten, put wholly out of her mind, all that was due to those much nearer to her than is an uncle to a niece?  The short, bitter, sunless day was advancing towards its decline before Victor roused himself with a quick impatient start from his reverie, and took forth the letter from the dead nun.  It began with expressions of gratitude, of joy at the thought that she should see him again before she died, thank him for his past kindness, and receive, she trusted, his assurance that he would attend to her last remorseful injunctions.  I pass over much that followed in the explanation of events in her life sufficiently known to the reader.  She stated, as the strongest reason why she had refused the hand of Louvier, her knowledge that she should in due time become a mother--a fact concealed from Victor, secure that he would then urge her not to annul her informal marriage, but"]]]
