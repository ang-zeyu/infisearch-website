What if Warwick so betray us and himself,--he brings no forces.  And never, by God's blessing, should we separate till we have redressed the wrongs of our countrymen!\"  \"Good!\" said the Saxon squire, winking, and looking wise,--\"not till we have burned to the ground the Baron of Bullstock's castle!\"  \"Not,\" said a Lollard, sternly, \"till we have shortened the purple gown of the churchman; not till abbot and bishop have felt on their backs the whip wherewith they have scourged the godly believer and the humble saint.\"  \"Not,\" added Robin, \"till we have assured bread to the poor man, and the filling of the flesh-pot, and the law to the weak, and the scaffold to the evil-doer.\"  \"All this is mighty well,\" said, bluntly, Sir Geoffrey Gates, the leader of the mercenaries, a skilful soldier, but a predatory and lawless bravo; \"but who is to pay me and my tall fellows?\"  At this pertinent question, there was a general hush of displeasure and disgust.  \"For, look you, my masters,\" continued Sir Geoffrey, \"as long as I and my comrades here believed that the rich earl, who hath half England for his provant, was at the head or the tail of this matter, we were contented to wait a while; but devil a groat hath yet gone into my gipsire; and as for pillage, what is a farm or a homestead? an' it were a church or a castle there might be pickings.\"  \"There is much plate of silver, and a sack or so of marks and royals, in the stronghold of the Baron of Bullstock,\" quoth the Saxon squire, doggedly hounding on to his revenge.  \"You see, my friends,\" said Coniers, with a smile, and shrugging his shoulders, \"that men cannot gird a kingdom with ropes of sand. Suppose we conquer and take captive--nay, or slay--King Edward, what then?\"  \"The Duke of Clarence, male heir to the throne,\" said the heir of Latimer, \"is Lord Warwick's son-in-law, and therefore akin to you, Sir John.\"  \"That is true,\" observed Coniers, musingly.  \"Not ill thought of, sir,\" said Sir Geoffrey Gates; \"and my advice is to proclaim Clarence king and Warwick lord protector.  We have some chance of the angels then.\"  \"Besides,\" said the heir of Fitzhugh, \"our purpose once made clear, it will be hard either for Warwick or Clarence to go against us,--harder still for the country not to believe them with us.  Bold measures are our wisest councillors.\"  \"Um!\" said the Lollard, \"Lord Warwick is a good man, and has never, though his brother be a bishop, abetted the Church tyrannies.  But as for George of Clarence--\"  \"As for Clarence,\" said Hilyard, who saw with dismay and alarm that the rebellion he designed to turn at the fitting hour to the service of Lancaster, might now only help to shift from one shoulder to the other the hated dynasty of York--\"as for Clarence, he hath Edward's vices without his manhood.\"  He paused, and seeing that the crisis had ripened the hour for declaring himself, his bold temper pushed at once to its object.  \"No!\" he continued, folding his arms, raising his head, and comprehending the whole council in his keen and steady gaze,--\"no! lords and gentlemen, since speak I must in this emergency, hear me calmly.  Nothing has prospered in England since we abandoned our lawful king.  If we rid ourselves of Edward, let it not be to sink from a harlot-monger to a drunkard.  In the Tower pines our true lord, already honoured as a saint.  Hear me, I say,--hear me out!  On the frontiers an army that keeps Gloucester at bay hath declared for Henry and Margaret.  Let us, after seizing Olney, march thither at once, and unite forces.  Margaret is already prepared to embark for England.  I have friends in London who will attack the Tower, and deliver Henry. To you, Sir John Coniers, in the queen's name, I promise an earldom and the garter; to you, the heirs of Latimer and Fitzhugh, the high posts that beseem your birth; to all of you, knights and captains, just share and allotment in the confiscated lands of the Woodvilles and the Yorkists; to you, brethren,\" and addressing the Lollards, his voice softened into a meaning accent that, compelled to worship in secret, they yet understood, \"shelter from your foes and mild laws; and to you, brave soldiers, that pay which a king's coffers alone can supply.  Wherefore I say, down with all subject-banners! up with the Red Rose and the Antelope, and long live Henry the Sixth!\"  This address, however subtle in its adaptation to the various passions of those assembled, however aided by the voice, spirit, and energy of the speaker, took too much by surprise those present to produce at once its effect.  The Lollards remembered the fires lighted for their martyrs by the House of Lancaster; and though blindly confident in Hilyard, were not yet prepared to respond to his call.  The young heir of Fitzhugh, who had, in truth, but taken arms to avenge the supposed wrongs of Warwick, whom he idolized, saw no object gained in the rise of Warwick's enemy, Queen Margaret.  The mercenaries called to mind the woful state of Henry's exchequer in the former time.  The Saxon squire muttered to himself, \"And what the devil is to become of the castle of Bullstock?\"  But Sir Henry Nevile (Lord Latimer's son), who belonged to that branch of his House which had espoused the Lancaster cause, and who was in the secret councils of Hilyard, caught up the cry, and said, \"Hilyard doth not exceed his powers; and he who strikes for the Red Rose shall carve out his own lordship from the manors of every Yorkist that he slays.\"  Sir John Coniers hesitated: poor, long neglected, ever enterprising and ambitious, he was dazzled by the proffered bribe; but age is slow to act, and he expressed himself with the measured caution of gray hairs.  \"A king's name,\" said he, \"is a tower of strength, especially when marching against a king; but this is a matter for general assent and grave forethought.\"  Before any other (for ideas did not rush at once to words in those days) found his tongue, a mighty uproar was heard without.  It did not syllable itself into distinct sound; it uttered no name; it was such a shout as numbers alone could raise; and to such a shout would some martial leader have rejoiced to charge to battle, so full of depth and fervour, and enthusiasm and good heart, it seemed, leaping from rank to rank, from breast to breast, from earth to heaven.  With one accord the startled captains made to the entrance of the tent, and there they saw, in the broad space before them, inclosed by the tents which were grouped in a wide semicircle,--for the mass of the hardy rebel army slept in the open air, and the tents were but for leaders,--they saw, we say, in that broad space, a multitude kneeling, and in the midst, upon his good steed Saladin, bending graciously down, the martial countenance, the lofty stature, of the Earl of Warwick.  Those among the captains who knew him not personally recognized him by the popular description,--by the black war-horse, whose legendary fame had been hymned by every minstrel; by the sensation his appearance had created; by the armourial insignia of his heralds, grouped behind him, and whose gorgeous tabards blazed with his cognizance and quarterings in azure, or, and argent.  The sun was slowly setting, and poured its rays upon the bare head of the mighty noble, gathering round it in the hazy atmosphere like a halo.  The homage of the crowd to that single form, unarmed, and scarce attended, struck a death-knell to the hopes of Hilyard,--struck awe into all his comrades!  The presence of that one man seemed to ravish from them, as by magic, a vast army; power, and state, and command left them suddenly to be absorbed in HIM! Captains, they were troopless,--the wielder of men's hearts was amongst them, and from his barb assumed reign, as from his throne!  \"Gads my life!\" said Coniers, turning to his comrades, \"we have now, with a truth, the earl amongst us; but unless he come to lead us on to Olney, I would as lief see the king's provost at my shoulder.\"  \"The crowd separates, he rides this way!\" said the heir of Fitzhugh. \"Shall we go forth to meet him?\"  \"Not so!\" exclaimed Hilyard, \"we are still the leaders of this army; let him find us deliberating on the siege of Olney!\"  \"Right!\" said Coniers; \"and if there come dispute, let not the rabble hear it.\"  The captains re-entered the tent, and in grave silence awaited the earl's coming; nor was this suspense long.  Warwick, leaving the multitude in the rear, and taking only one of the subaltern officers in the rebel camp as his guide and usher, arrived at the tent, and was admitted into the council.  The captains, Hilyard alone excepted, bowed with great reverence as the earl entered.  \"Welcome, puissant sir and illustrious kinsman!\" said Coniers, who had decided on the line to be adopted; \"you are come at last to take the command of the troops raised in your name, and into your hands I resign this truncheon.\"  \"I accept it, Sir John Coniers,\" answered Warwick, taking the place of dignity; \"and since you thus constitute me your commander, I proceed at once to my stern duties.  How happens it, knights and gentlemen, that in my absence ye have dared to make my name the pretext of rebellion?  Speak thou, my sister's son!\"  \"Cousin and lord,\" said the heir of Fitzhugh, reddening but not abashed, \"we could not believe but what you would smile on those who have risen to assert your wrongs and defend your life.\"  And he then briefly related the tale of the Duchess of Bedford's waxen effigies, and pointed to Hilyard as the eye-witness.  \"And,\" began Sir Henry Nevile, \"you,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7721"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 07 (#5)"],["body","while, were banished, seemingly, from the king's court; the dissensions between you and Edward sufficiently the land's talk, the king's vices the land's shame!  \"Nor did we act without at least revealing our intentions to my uncle and your brother, the Lord Montagu,\" added the heir of Fitzhugh.  \"Meanwhile,\" said Robin of Redesdale, \"the commons were oppressed, the people discontented, the Woodvilles plundering its, and the king wasting our substance on concubines and minions.  We have had cause eno' for our rising!\" The earl listened to each speaker in stern silence.  \"For all this,\" he said at last, \"you have, without my leave or sanction, levied armed men in my name, and would have made Richard Nevile seem to Europe a traitor, without the courage to be a rebel! Your lives are in my power, and those lives are forfeit to the laws.\"  \"If we have incurred your disfavour from our over-zeal for you,\" said the son of Lord Fitzhugh, touchingly, \"take our lives, for they are of little worth.\"  And the young nobleman unbuckled his sword, and laid it on the table.  \"But,\" resumed Warwick, not seeming to heed his nephew's humility, \"I, who have ever loved the people of England, and before king and parliament have ever pleaded their cause,--I, as captain-general and first officer of these realms, here declare, that whatever motives of ambition or interest may have misled men of mark and birth, I believe that the commons at least never rise in arms without some excuse for their error.  Speak out then, you, their leaders; and, putting aside all that relates to me as the one man, say what are the grievances of which the many would complain.\"  And now there was silence, for the knights and gentlemen knew little of the complaints of the populace; the Lollards did not dare to expose their oppressed faith, and the squires and franklins were too uneducated to detail the grievances they had felt.  But then the immense superiority of the man of the people at once asserted itself; and Hilyard, whose eye the earl had hitherto shunned, lifted his deep voice.  With clear precision, in indignant but not declamatory eloquence, he painted the disorders of the time,--the insolent exactions of the hospitals and abbeys, the lawless violence of each petty baron, the weakness of the royal authority in restraining oppression, its terrible power in aiding the oppressor.  He accumulated instance on instance of misrule; he showed the insecurity of property, the adulteration of the coin, the burden of the imposts; he spoke of wives and maidens violated, of industry defrauded, of houses forcibly entered, of barns and granaries despoiled, of the impunity of all offenders, if high-born, of the punishment of all complaints, if poor and lowly.  \"Tell us not,\" he said, \"that this is the necessary evil of the times, the hard condition of mankind.  It was otherwise, Lord Warwick, when Edward first swayed; for you then made yourself dear to the people by your justice.  Still men talk, hereabouts, of the golden rule of Earl Warwick; but since you have been, though great in office, powerless in deed, absent in Calais, or idle at Middleham, England hath been but the plaything of the Woodvilles, and the king's ears have been stuffed with flattery as with wool.  And,\" continued Hilyard, warming with his subject, and, to the surprise of the Lollards, entering boldly on their master- grievance--\"and this is not all.  When Edward ascended the throne, there was, if not justice, at least repose, for the persecuted believers who hold that God's word was given to man to read, study, and digest into godly deeds.  I speak plainly.  I speak of that faith which your great father Salisbury and many of the House of York were believed to favour,--that faith which is called the Lollard, and the oppression of which, more than aught else, lost to Lancaster the hearts of England.  But of late, the Church, assuming the power it ever grasps the most under the most licentious kings (for the sinner prince hath ever the tyrant priest!), hath put in vigour old laws for the wronging man's thought and conscience; [The Lollards had greatly contributed to seat Edward on the throne; and much of the subsequent discontent, no doubt, arose from their disappointment, when, as Sharon Turner well expresses it, \"his indolence allied him to the Church,\" and he became \"hereticorum severissimus hostis.\"--CROYL., p. 564.] and we sit at our doors under the shade, not of the vine-tree, but the gibbet.  For all these things we have drawn the sword; and if now, you, taking advantage of the love borne to you by the sons of England, push that sword back into the sheath, you, generous, great, and princely though you be, well deserve the fate that I foresee and can foretell.  Yes!\" cried the speaker, extending his arms, and gazing fixedly on the proud face of the earl, which was not inexpressive of emotion--\"yes!  I see you, having deserted the people, deserted by them also in your need; I see you, the dupe of an ungrateful king, stripped of power and honour, an exile and an outlaw; and when you call in vain upon the people, in whose hearts you now reign, remember, O fallen star, son of the morning! that in the hour of their might you struck down the people's right arm, and paralyzed their power.  And now, if you will, let your friends and England's champions glut the scaffolds of your woman-king!\"  He ceased.  A murmur went round the conclave; every breast breathed hard, every eye turned to Warwick.  That mighty statesman mastered the effect which the thrilling voice of the popular pleader produced on him; but at that moment he had need of all his frank and honourable loyalty to remind him that he was there but to fulfil a promise and discharge a trust,--that he was the king's delegate, not the king's judge.  \"You have spoken, bold men,\" said he, \"as, in an hour when the rights of princes are weighed in one scale, the subject's sword in the other, I, were I king, would wish free men to speak.  And now you, Robert Hilyard, and you, gentlemen, hear me, as envoy to King Edward IV.  To all of you I promise complete amnesty and entire pardon.  His highness believes you misled, not criminal, and your late deeds will not be remembered in your future services.  So much for the leaders.  Now for the commons.  My liege the king is pleased to recall me to the high powers I once exercised, and to increase rather than to lessen them. In his name, I pledge myself to full and strict inquiry into all the grievances Robin of Redesdale hath set forth, with a view to speedy and complete redress.  Nor is this all.  His highness, laying aside his purpose of war with France, will have less need of impost on his subjects, and the burdens and taxes will be reduced.  Lastly, his grace, ever anxious to content his people, hath most benignly empowered me to promise that, whether or not ye rightly judge the queen's kindred, they will no longer have part or weight in the king's councils.  The Duchess of Bedford, as beseems a lady so sorrowfully widowed, will retire to her own home; and the Lord Scales will fulfil a mission to the court of Spain.  Thus, then, assenting to all reasonable demands, promising to heal all true grievances, proffering you gracious pardon, I discharge my duty to king and to people.  I pray that these unhappy sores may be healed evermore, under the blessing of God and our patron saint; and in the name of Edward IV., Lord Suzerain of England and of France, I break up this truncheon and disband this army!\"  Among those present, this moderate and wise address produced a general sensation of relief; for the earl's disavowal of the revolt took away all hope of its success.  But the common approbation was not shared by Hilyard.  He sprang upon the table, and, seizing the broken fragments of the truncheon, which the earl had snapped as a willow twig, exclaimed, \"And thus, in the name of the people, I seize the command that ye unworthily resign!  Oh, yes, what fools were yonder drudges of the hard hand and the grimed brow and the leathern jerkin, to expect succour from knight and noble!\"  So saying, he bounded from the tent, and rushed towards the multitude at the distance.  \"Ye knights and lords, men of blood and birth, were but the tools of a manlier and wiser Cade!\" said Warwick, calmly.  \"Follow me.\"  The earl strode from the tent, sprang upon his steed, and was in the midst of the troops with his heralds by his side, ere Hilyard had been enabled to begin the harangue he had intended.  Warwick's trumpets sounded to silence; and the earl himself, in his loud clear voice, briefly addressed the immense audience.  Master, scarcely less than Hilyard, of the popular kind of eloquence, which--short, plain, generous, and simple--cuts its way at once through the feelings to the policy, Warwick briefly but forcibly recapitulated to the commons the promises he had made to the captains; and as soon as they heard of taxes removed, the coinage reformed, the corn thrave abolished, the Woodvilles dismissed, and the earl recalled to power, the rebellion was at an end.  They answered with a joyous shout his order to disperse and retire to their homes forthwith.  But the indomitable Hilyard, ascending a small eminence, began his counter-agitation.  The earl saw his robust form and waving hand, he saw the crowd sway towards him; and too well acquainted with mankind to suffer his address, he spurred to the spot, and turning to Marmaduke, said, in a loud voice, \"Marmaduke Nevile, arrest that man in the king's name!\"  Marmaduke sprang from his steed, and laid his hand on Hilyard's shoulder.  Not one of the multitude stirred on behalf of their demagogue.  As before the sun recede the stars, all lesser lights had died in the blaze of Warwick's beloved name.  Hilyard griped his dagger, and struggled an instant; but when he saw the awe and apathy of the armed mob, a withering expression of disdain passed over his hardy face.  \"Do ye suffer "]]]
