And whatever has chanced to alienate your heart from me, the sound of the rebel's trumpet chases all difference, and marries your faith to mine.\"  \"Oh, Edward, my king, why did you so misjudge me in the prosperous hour!\" said Warwick, simply, but with affecting earnestness: \"since in the adverse hour you arede me well?\"  As he spoke, he bowed his head, and, bending his knee, kissed the hand held out to him.  Edward's face grew radiant, and, raising the earl, he glanced proudly at the barons, who stood round, surprised and mute.  \"Yes, my lords and sirs, see,--it is not the Earl of Warwick, next to our royal brethren the nearest subject to the throne, who would desert me in the day of peril!\"  \"Nor do we, sire,\" retorted Raoul de Fulke; \"you wrong us before our mighty comrade if you so misthink us.  We will fight for the king, but not for the queen's kindred; and this alone brings on us your anger.\"  \"The gates shall be opened to ye.  Go!  Warwick and I are men enough for the rabble yonder.\"  The earl's quick eye and profound experience of his time saw at once the dissension and its causes.  Nor, however generous, was he willing to forego the present occasion for permanently destroying an influence which he knew hostile to himself and hurtful to the realm.  His was not the generosity of a boy, but of a statesman.  Accordingly, as Raoul de Fulke ceased, he took up the word.  \"My liege, we have yet an hour good ere the foe can reach the gates. Your brother and mine accompany me.  See, they enter!  Please you, a few minutes to confer with them; and suffer me, meanwhile, to reason with these noble captains.\"  Edward paused; but before the open brow of the earl fled whatever suspicion might have crossed the king's mind.  \"Be it so, cousin; but remember this,--to councillors who can menace me with desertion at such an hour, I concede nothing.\"  Turning hastily away, he met Clarence and the prelate midway in the hall, threw his arm caressingly over his brother's shoulder, and, taking the archbishop by the hand, walked with them towards the battlements.  \"Well, my friends,\" said Warwick, \"and what would you of the king?\"  \"The dismissal of all the Woodvilles, except the queen; the revocation of the grants and land accorded to them, to the despoiling the ancient noble; and, but for your presence, we had demanded your recall.\"  \"And, failing these, what your resolve?\"  \"To depart, and leave Edward to his fate.  These granted, we doubt little but that the insurgents will disband.  These not granted, we but waste our lives against a multitude whose cause we must approve.\"  \"The cause!  But ye know not the real cause,\" answered Warwick.  \"I know it; for the sons of the North are familiar to me, and their rising hath deeper meaning than ye deem.  What! have they not decoyed to their head my kinsmen, the heirs of Latimer and Fitzhugh, and bold Coniers, whose steel calque should have circled a wiser brain?  Have they not taken my name as their battle-cry?  And do ye think this falsehood veils nothing but the simple truth of just complaint?\"  \"Was their rising, then,\" asked St. John, in evident surprise, \"wholly unauthorized by you?\"  \"So help me Heaven! if I would resort to arms to redress a wrong, think not that I myself would be absent from the field!  No, my lords, friends, and captains, time presses; a few words must suffice to explain what as yet may be dark to you.  I have letters from Montagu and others, which reached me the same day as the king's, and which clear up the purpose of our misguided countrymen.  Ye know well that ever in England, but especially since the reign of Edward III., strange, wild notions of some kind of liberty other than that we enjoy have floated loose through the land.  Among the commons, a half- conscious recollection that the nobles are a different race from themselves feeds a secret rancour and mislike, which, at any fair occasion for riot, shows itself bitter and ruthless,--as in the outbreak of Cade and others.  And if the harvest fail, or a tax gall, there are never wanting men to turn the popular distress to the ends of private ambition or state design.  Such a man has been the true head and front of this commotion.\"  \"Speak you of Robin of Redesdale, now dead?\" asked one of the captains.  \"He is not dead.  [The fate of Robin of Redesdale has been as obscure as most of the incidents in this most perplexed part of English history.  While some of the chroniclers finish his career according to the report mentioned in the text, Fabyan not only more charitably prolongs his life, but rewards him with the king's pardon; and according to the annals of his ancient and distinguished family (who will pardon, we trust, a license with one of their ancestry equally allowed by history and romance), as referred to in Wotton's \"English Baronetage\" (Art. \"Hilyard\"), and which probably rests upon the authority of the life of Richard III., in Stowe's \"Annals,\" he is represented as still living in the reign of that king.  But the whole account of this famous demagogue in Wotton is, it must be owned, full of historical mistakes.]  Montagu informs me that the report was false.  He was defeated off York, and retired for some days into the woods; but it is he who has enticed the sons of Latimer and Fitzhugh into the revolt, and resigned his own command to the martial cunning of Sir John Coniers.  This Robin of Redesdale is no common man.  He hath had a clerkly education, he hath travelled among the Free Towns of Italy, he hath deep purpose in all he doth; and among his projects is the destruction of the nobles here, as it was whilome effected in Florence, the depriving us of all offices and posts, with other changes, wild to think of and long to name.\"  \"And we would have suffered this man to triumph!\" exclaimed De Fulke: \"we have been to blame.\"  \"Under fair pretence he has gathered numbers, and now wields an army. I have reason to know that, had he succeeded in estranging ye from Edward, and had the king fallen, dead or alive, into his hands, his object would have been to restore Henry of Windsor, but on conditions that would have left king and baron little more than pageants in the state.  I knew this man years ago.  I have watched him since; and, strange though it may seem to you, he hath much in him that I admire as a subject and should fear were I a king.  Brief, thus runs my counsel: For our sake and the realm's safety, we must see this armed multitude disbanded; that done, we must see the grievances they with truth complain of fairly redressed.  Think not, my lords, I avenge my own wrongs alone, when I go with you in your resolve to banish from the king's councils the baleful influence of the queen's kin.  Till that be compassed, no peace for England.  As a leprosy, their avarice crawls over the nobler parts of the state, and devours while it sullies.  Leave this to me; and, though we will redress ourselves, let us now assist our king!\"  With one voice the unruly officers clamoured their assent to all the earl urged, and expressed their readiness to sally at once from the gates, and attack the rebels.  \"But,\" observed an old veteran, \"what are we amongst so many?  Here a handful--there an army!\"  \"Fear not, reverend sir,\" answered Warwick, with an assured smile; \"is not this army in part gathered from my own province of Yorkshire?  Is it not formed of men who have eaten of my bread and drunk of my cup? Let me see the man who will discharge one arrow at the walls which contain Richard Nevile of Warwick.  Now each to your posts,--I to the king.\"  Like the pouring of new blood into a decrepit body seemed the arrival, at that feeble garrison, of the Earl of Warwick.  From despair into the certainty of triumph leaped every heart.  Already at the sight of his banner floating by the side of Edward's, the gunner had repaired to his bombard, the archer had taken up his bow; the village itself, before disaffected, poured all its scanty population--women, and age, and children--to the walls.  And when the earl joined the king upon the ramparts, he found that able general sanguine and elated, and pointing out to Clarence the natural defences of the place. Meanwhile, the rebels, no doubt apprised by their scouts of the new aid, had already halted in their march, and the dark swarm might be seen indistinctly undulating, as bees ere they settle, amidst the verdure of the plain.  \"Well, cousin,\" said the king, \"have ye brought these Hotspurs to their allegiance?\"  \"Sire, yes,\" said Warwick, gravely; \"but we have here no force to resist yon army.\"  \"Bring you not succours?\" said the king, astonished.  \"You must have passed through London.  Have you left no troops upon the road?\"  \"I had no time, sire; and London is well-nigh palsied with dismay. Had I waited to collect troops, I might have found a king's head blackening over those gates.\"  \"Well,\" returned Edward, carelessly, \"few or many, one gentleman is more worth than a hundred varlets.  'We are eno' for glory,' as Henry said at Agincourt.\"  \"No, sire; you are too skilful and too wise to believe your boast. These men we cannot conquer,--we must disperse them.\"  \"By what spell?\"  \"By their king's word to redress their complaints.\"  \"And banish my queen?\"  \"Heaven forbid that man should part those whom God has joined,\" returned Warwick.  \"Not my lady, your queen, but my lady's kindred.\"  \"Rivers is dead, and gallant John,\" said Edward, sadly; \"is not that enough for revenge?\"  \"It is not revenge that we require, but pledges for the land's safety,\" answered Warwick.  \"And to be plain, without such a promise these walls may be your tomb.\"  Edward walked apart, strongly debating within himself.  In his character were great contrasts: no man was more frank in common, no man more false when it suited; no man had more levity in wanton love, or more firm affection for those he once thoroughly took to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7721"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 07 (#3)"],["body","heart. He was the reverse of grateful for service yielded, yet he was warm in protecting those on whom service was conferred.  He was resolved not to give up the Woodvilles, and after a short self-commune, he equally determined not to risk his crown and life by persevering in resistance to the demand for their downfall.  Inly obstinate, outwardly yielding, he concealed his falsehood with his usual soldierly grace.  \"Warwick,\" he said, returning to the earl's side, \"you cannot advise me to what is misbeseeming, and therefore in this strait I resign my conduct to your hands.  I will not unsay to yon mutinous gentlemen what I have already said; but what you judge it right to promise in my name to them or to the insurgents, I will not suppose that mime honour will refuse to concede.  But go not hence, O noblest friend that ever stood by a king's throne!--go not hence till the grasp of your hand assures me that all past unkindness is gone and buried; yea, and by this hand, and while its pressure is warm in mine, bear not too hard on thy king's affection for his lady's kindred.\"  \"Sire,\" said Warwick, though his generous nature well-nigh melted into weakness, and it was with an effort that he adhered to his purpose,-- \"sire, if dismissed for a while, they shall not be degraded.  And if it be, on consideration, wise to recall from the family of Woodville your grants of lands and lordships, take from your Warwick--who, rich in his king's love, hath eno' to spare--take the double of what you would recall.  Oh, be frank with me, be true, be steadfast, Edward, and dispose of my lands, whenever you would content a favourite.\"  \"Not to impoverish thee, my Warwick,\" answered Edward, smiling, \"did I call thee to my aid; for the rest, my revenues as Duke of York are at least mine to bestow.  Go now to the hostile camp,--go as sole minister and captain-general of this realm; go with all powers and honours a king can give; and when these districts are at peace, depart to our Welsh provinces, as chief justiciary of that principality. Pembroke's mournful death leaves that high post in my gift.  It cannot add to your greatness, but it proves to England your sovereign's trust.\"  \"And while that trust is given,\" said Warwick, with tears in his eyes, \"may Heaven strengthen my arm in battle, and sharpen my brain in council!  But I play the laggard.  The sun wanes westward; it should not go down while a hostile army menaces the son of Richard of York.\"  The earl rode rapidly away, reached the broad space where his followers still stood, dismounted, but beside their steeds,--  \"Trumpets advance, pursuivants and heralds go before!  Marmaduke, mount!  The rest I need not.  We ride to the insurgent camp.\"     CHAPTER III.  THE CAMP OF THE REBELS.  The rebels had halted about a mile from the town, and were already pitching their tents for the night.  It was a tumultuous, clamorous, but not altogether undisciplined array; for Coniers was a leader of singular practice in reducing men into the machinery of war, and where his skill might have failed, the prodigious influence and energy of Robin of Redesdale ruled the passions and united the discordant elements.  This last was, indeed, in much worthy the respect in which Warwick held his name.  In times more ripe for him, he would have been a mighty demagogue and a successful regenerator.  His birth was known but to few; his education and imperious temper made him vulgarly supposed of noble origin; but had he descended from a king's loins, Robert Hilyard had still been the son of the Saxon people.  Warwick overrated, perhaps, Hilyard's wisdom; for, despite his Italian experience, his ideas were far from embracing any clear and definite system of democracy.  He had much of the frantic levelism and jacquerie of his age and land, and could probably not have explained to himself all the changes he desired to effect; but, coupled with his hatred to the nobles, his deep and passionate sympathy with the poor, his heated and fanatical chimeras of a republic, half-political and half-religious, he had, with no uncommon inconsistency, linked the cause of a dethroned king.  For as the Covenanters linked with the Stuarts against the succeeding and more tolerant dynasty, never relinquishing their own anti-monarchic theories; as in our time, the extreme party on the popular side has leagued with the extreme of the aristocratic, in order to crush the medium policy, as a common foe,-- so the bold leveller united with his zeal for Margaret the very cause which the House of Lancaster might be supposed the least to favour. He expected to obtain from a sovereign dependent upon a popular reaction for restoration, great popular privileges.  And as the Church had deserted the Red Rose for the White, he sought to persuade many of the Lollards, ever ready to show their discontent, that Margaret (in revenge on the hierarchy) would extend the protection they had never found in the previous sway of her husband and Henry V.  Possessed of extraordinary craft, and even cunning in secular intrigues, energetic, versatile, bold, indefatigable, and, above all, marvellously gifted with the arts that inflame, stir up, and guide the physical force of masses, Robert Hilyard had been, indeed, the soul and life of the present revolt; and his prudent moderation in resigning the nominal command to those whose military skill and high birth raised a riot into the dignity of rebellion, had given that consistency and method to the rising which popular movements never attain without aristocratic aid.  In the principal tent of the encampment the leaders of the insurrection were assembled.  There was Sir John Coniers, who had married one of the Neviles, the daughter of Fauconberg, Lord High Admiral, but who had profited little by this remote connection with Warwick; for, with all his merit, he was a greedy, grasping man, and he had angered the hot earl in pressing his claims too imperiously.  This renowned knight was a tall, gaunt man, whose iron frame sixty winters had not bowed.  There were the young heirs of Latimer and Fitzhugh, in gay gilded armour and scarlet mantelines; and there, in a plain cuirass, trebly welded, and of immense weight, but the lower limbs left free and unincumbered in thick leathern hose, stood Robin of Redesdale.  Other captains there were, whom different motives had led to the common confederacy.  There might be seen the secret Lollard, hating either Rose, stern and sour, and acknowledging no leader but Hilyard, whom he knew as a Lollard's son; there might be seen the ruined spendthrift, discontented with fortune, and regarding civil war as the cast of a die,--death for the forfeiture, lordships for the gain; there, the sturdy Saxon squire, oppressed by the little baron of his province, and rather hopeful to abase a neighbour than dethrone a king of whom he knew little, and for whom he cared still less; and there, chiefly distinguished from the rest by grizzled beard, upturned mustache, erect mien, and grave, not thoughtful aspect, were the men of a former period,--the soldiers who had fought against the Maid of Are,--now without place, station, or hope in peaceful times, already half robbers by profession, and decoyed to any standard that promised action, pay, or plunder.  The conclave were in high and warm debate.  \"If this be true,\" said Coniers, who stood at the head of the table, his helmet, axe, truncheon, and a rough map of the walls of Olney before him--\"if this be true, if our scouts are not deceived, if the Earl of Warwick is in the village, and if his banner float beside King Edward's,--I say, bluntly, as soldiers should speak, that I have been deceived and juggled!\"  \"And by whom, Sir Knight and cousin?\" said the heir of Fitzhugh, reddening.  \"By you, young kinsman, and this hot-mouthed dare-devil, Robin of Redesdale!  Ye assured me, both, that the earl approved the rising; that he permitted the levying yon troops in his name; that he knew well the time was come to declare against the Woodvilles, and that no sooner was an army mustered than he would place himself at its bead; and I say, if this be not true, you have brought these gray hairs into dishonour!\"  \"And what, Sir John Coniers,\" exclaimed Robin, rudely, \"what honour had your gray hairs till the steel cap covered them?  What honour, I say, under lewd Edward and his lusty revellers?  You were thrown aside, like a broken scythe, Sir John Coniers!  You were forsaken in your rust!  Warwick himself, your wife's great kinsman, could do nought in your favour!  You stand now, leader of thousands, lord of life and death, master of Edward and the throne!  We have done this for you, and you reproach us!\"  \"And,\" began the heir of Fitzhugh, encouraged by the boldness of Hilyard, \"we had all reason to believe my noble uncle, the Earl of Warwick, approved our emprise.  When this brave fellow (pointing to Robin) came to inform me that, with his own eyes, he had seen the waxen effigies of my great kinsman, the hellish misdeed of the queen's witch-dam, I repaired to my Lord Montagu; and though that prudent courtier refused to declare openly, he let me see that war with the Woodvilles was not unwelcome to him.\"  \"Yet this same Montagu,\" observed one of the ringleaders, \"when Hilyard was well-nigh at the gates of York, sallied out and defeated him, sans ruth, sans ceremony.\"  \"Yes, but he spared my life, and beheaded the dead body of poor Hugh Withers in my stead: for John Nevile is cunning, and he picks his nuts from the brennen without lesing his own paw.  It was not the hour for him to join us, so he beat us civilly, and with discretion.  But what hath he done since?  He stands aloof while our army swells, while the bull of the Neviles and the ragged staff of the earl are the ensigns of our war, and while Edward gnaws out his fierce heart in yon walls of Olney.  How say ye, then, that Warwick, even if now in person with the king, is in heart against us?  Nay, "]]]
