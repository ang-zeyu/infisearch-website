In the previous year he had lost one of his two children; the other was just dead.  No nearer relation now surviving stood between me and my chance of inheritance from him.  He wrote word of his domestic affliction with a manly sorrow which touched me, said that his health was failing, and begged me, as soon as possible, to come and visit him in Scotland.  I went, and continued to reside with him till his death, some months afterwards.  By his will I succeeded to his ample fortune on condition of taking his name.  As soon as the affairs connected with this inheritance permitted, I returned to Paris, and again saw M. Sartiges.  I had never heard from Louise, nor from any one connected with her since the letter you have read.  No steps had been taken to annul the marriage, and sufficient time had elapsed to render it improbable that such steps would be taken now; but if no such steps were taken, however free from the marriage-bond Louise might be, it clearly remained binding on myself.  At my request, M. Sartiges took the most vigorous measures that occurred to him to ascertain where Louise was, and what and who was the relation with whom she asserted she had found refuge.  The police were employed; advertisements were issued, concealing names, but sufficiently clear to be intelligible to Louise if they came under her eye, and to the effect that if any informality in our marriage existed, she was implored for her own sake to remove it by a second ceremonial--answer to be addressed to the _avoue_.  No answer came; the police had hitherto failed of discovering her, but were sanguine of success, when a few weeks after these advertisements a packet reached M. Sartiges, enclosing the certificates annexed to this letter, of the death of Louise Duval at Munich.  The certificates, as you will see, are to appearance. officially attested and unquestionably genuine.  So they were considered by M. Sartiges as well as by myself.  Here, then, all inquiry ceased; the police were dismissed.  I was free.  By little and little I overcame the painful impressions which my ill-starred union and the announcement of Louise's early death bequeathed.  Rich, and of active mind, I learned to dismiss the trials of my youth as a gloomy dream.  I entered into public life; I made myself a creditable position; became acquainted with your aunt; we were wedded, and the beauty of her nature embellished mine. Alas, alas! two years after our marriage--nearly five years after I had received the certificates of Louise's death--I and your aunt made a summer excursion into the country of the Rhine; on our return we rested at Aix-la-Chapelle.  One day while there I was walking alone in the environs of the town, when, on the road, a little girl, seemingly about five years old, in chase of a butterfly, stumbled and fell just before my feet; I took her up, and as she was crying more from the shock of the fall than any actual hurt, I was still trying my best to comfort her, when a lady some paces behind her came up, and in taking the child from my arms as I was bending over her, thanked me in a voice that made my heart stand still.  I looked up, and beheld Louise.  It was not till I had convulsively clasped her hand and uttered her name that she recognized me.  I was, no doubt, the more altered of the two,-- prosperity and happiness had left little trace of the needy, care worn, threadbare student.  But if she were the last to recognize, she was the first to recover self-possession.  The expression of her face became hard and set.  I cannot pretend to repeat with any verbal accuracy the brief converse that took place between us, as she placed the child on the grass bank beside the path, bade her stay there quietly, and walked on with me some paces as if she did not wish the child to hear what was said.  The purport of what passed was to this effect: She refused to explain the certificates of her death further than that, becoming aware of what she called the \"persecution\" of the advertisements issued and inquiries instituted, she had caused those documents to be sent to the address given in the advertisement, in order to terminate all further molestation.  But how they could have been obtained, or by what art so ingeniously forged as to deceive the acuteness of a practised lawyer, I know not to this day.  She declared, indeed, that she was now happy, in easy circumstances, and that if I wished to make some reparation for the wrong I had done her, it would be to leave her in peace; and in case-- which was not likely--we ever met again, to regard and treat her as a stranger; that she, on her part, never would molest me, and that the certified death of Louise Duval left me as free to marry again as she considered herself to be.  My mind was so confused, so bewildered, while she thus talked, that I did not attempt to interrupt her.  The blow had so crushed me that I scarcely struggled under it; only, as she turned to leave me, I suddenly recollected that the child, when taken from my arms, had called her \"Maman,\" and, judging by the apparent age of the child, it must have been born but a few months after Louise had left me,--that it must be mine. And so, in my dreary woe, I faltered out, \"But what of your infant? Surely that has on me a claim that you relinquish for yourself.  You were not unfaithful to me while you deemed you were my wife?\"  \"Heavens! can you insult me by such a doubt?  No!\" she cried out, impulsively and haughtily.  \"But as I was not legally your wife, the child is not legally yours; it is mine, and only mine.  Nevertheless, if you wish to claim it\"--here she paused as in doubt.  I saw at once that she was prepared to resign to me the child if I had urged her to do so.  I must own, with a pang of remorse, that I recoiled from such a proposal.  What could I do with the child?  How explain to my wife the cause of my interest in it?  If only a natural child of mine, I should have shrunk from owning to Janet a youthful error.  But as it was,--the child by a former marriage, the former wife still living!-- my blood ran cold with dread.  And if I did take the child, invent what story I might as to its parentage, should I not expose myself, expose Janet, to terrible constant danger?  The mother's natural affection might urge her at any time to seek tidings of the child, and in so doing she might easily discover my new name, and, perhaps years hence, establish on me her own claim.  No, I could not risk such perils.  I replied sullenly, \"You say rightly; the child is yours,--only yours.\"  I was about to add an offer of pecuniary provision for it, but Louise had already turned scornfully towards the bank on which she bad left the infant.  I saw her snatch from the child's hand some wild flowers the poor thing had been gathering; and how often have I thought of the rude way in which she did it,--not as a mother who loves her child.  Just then other passengers appeared on the road; two of them I knew,--an English couple very intimate with Lady Janet and myself.  They stopped to accost me, while Louise passed by with the infant towards the town.  I turned in the opposite direction, and strove to collect my thoughts.  Terrible as was the discovery thus suddenly made, it was evident that Louise had as strong an interest as myself to conceal it.  There was little chance that it would ever be divulged.  Her dress and that of the child were those of persons in the richer classes of life.  After all, doubtless, the child needed not pecuniary assistance from me, and was surely best off under the mother's care.  Thus I sought to comfort and to delude myself.  The next day Janet and I left Aix-la-Chapelle and returned to England. But it was impossible for me to banish the dreadful thought that Janet was not legally my wife; that could she even guess the secret lodged in my breast she would be lost to me forever, even though she died of the separation (you know well how tenderly she loved me).  My nature underwent a silent revolution.  I had previously cherished the ambition common to most men in public life,--the ambition for fame, for place, for power.  That ambition left me; I shrank from the thought of becoming too well known, lest Louise or her connections, as yet ignorant of my new name, might more easily learn what the world knew; namely that I had previously borne another name,--the name of her husband,--and finding me wealthy and honoured, might hereafter be tempted to claim for herself or her daughter the ties she adjured for both while she deemed me poor and despised.  But partly my conscience, partly the influence of the angel by my side, compelled me to seek whatever means of doing good to others position and circumstances placed at my disposal.  I was alarmed when even such quiet exercise of mind and fortune acquired a sort of celebrity.  How pain fully I shrank from it!  The world attributed my dread of publicity to unaffected modesty.  The world praised me, and I knew myself an impostor.  But the years stole on.  I heard no more of Louise or her child, and my fears gradually subsided.  Yet I was consoled when the two children born to me by Janet died in their infancy.  Had they lived, who can tell whether something might not have transpired to prove them illegitimate.  I must hasten on.  At last came the great and crushing calamity of my life,--I lost the woman who was my all in all.  At least she was spared the discovery that would have deprived me of the right of tending her deathbed, and leaving within her tomb a place vacant for myself.  But after the first agonies that followed her loss, the conscience I had so long sought to tranquillize became terribly reproachful.

CHAPTER I.  It is the first week in the month of May, 1870.  Celebrities are of rapid growth in the salons of Paris.  Gustave Rameau has gained the position for which he sighed.  The journal he edits has increased its hold on the public, and his share of the profits has been liberally augmented by the secret proprietor.  Rameau is acknowledged as a power in literary circles.  And as critics belonging to the same clique praise each other in Paris, whatever they may do in communities more rigidly virtuous, his poetry has been declared by authorities in the press to be superior to that of Alfred de Musset in vigour--to that of Victor Hugo in refinement; neither of which assertions would much, perhaps, shock a cultivated understanding.  It is true that it (Gustave's poetry) has not gained a wide audience among the public.  But with regard to poetry nowadays, there are plenty of persons who say as Dr. Johnson said of the verse of Spratt, \"I would rather praise it than read.\"  At all events, Rameau was courted in gay and brilliant circles, and, following the general example of French _litterateurs_ in fashion, lived well up to the income he received, had a delightful bachelor's apartment, furnished with artistic effect, spent largely on the adornment of his person, kept a coupe, and entertained profusely at the cafe Anglais and the Maison Doree.  A reputation that inspired a graver and more unquiet interest had been created by the Vicomte de Mauleon.  Recent articles in the Sens Commun, written under the name of Pierre Firmin on the discussions on the vexed question of the plebiscite, had given umbrage to the Government, and Rameau had received an intimation that he, as editor, was responsible for the compositions of the contributors to the journal he edited; and that though, so long as Pierre Firmin had kept his caustic spirit within proper bounds, the Government had winked at the evasion of the law which required every political article in a journal to be signed by the real name of its author, it could do so no longer.  Pierre Firmin was apparently a _nom de plume_; if not, his identity must be proved, or Rameau would pay the penalty which his contributor seemed bent on incurring.  Rameau, much alarmed for the journal that might be suspended, and for himself who might be imprisoned, conveyed this information through the publisher to his correspondent Pierre Firmin, and received the next day an article signed Victor de Mauleon, in which the writer proclaimed himself to be one and the same with Pierre Firmin, and, taking a yet bolder tone than he had before assumed, dared the Government to attempt legal measures against him.  The Government was prudent enough to disregard that haughty bravado, but Victor de Mauleon rose at once into political importance.  He had already in his real name and his quiet way established a popular and respectable place in Parisian society.  But if this revelation created him enemies whom he had not before provoked, he was now sufficiently acquitted, by tacit consent, of the sins formerly laid to his charge, to disdain the assaults of party wrath.  His old reputation for personal courage and skill in sword and pistol served, indeed, to protect him from such charges as a Parisian journalist does not reply to with his pen.  If he created some enemies, he created many more friends, or, at least, partisans and admirers.  He only needed fine and imprisonment to become a popular hero.  A few days after be had thus proclaimed himself, Victor de Mauleon--who had before kept aloof from Rameau, and from salons at which he was likely to meet that distinguished minstrel--solicited his personal acquaintance, and asked him to breakfast.  Rameau joyfully went.  He had a very natural curiosity to see the contributor whose articles had so mainly insured the sale of the Sens Commun.  In the dark-haired, keen-eyed, well-dressed, middle-aged man, with commanding port and courtly address, he failed to recognise any resemblance to the flaxen-wigged, long-coated, be-spectacled, shambling sexagenarian whom he had known as Lebeau.  Only now and then a tone of voice struck him as familiar, but he could not recollect where he had heard the voice it resembled.  The thought of Lebeau did not occur to him; if it had occurred it would only have struck him as a chance coincidence.  Rameau, like most egotists, was rather a dull observer of men.  His genius was not objective.  \"I trust, Monsieur Rameau,\" said the Vicomte, as he and his guest were seated at the breakfast-table, \"that you are not dissatisfied with the remuneration your eminent services in the journal have received.\"  \"The proprietor, whoever he be, has behaved most liberally,\" answered Rameau.  \"I take that compliment to myself, _cher confrere_; for though the expenses of starting the Sens Commun, and the caution money lodged, were found by a friend of mine, that was as a loan, which I have long since repaid, and the property in the journal is now exclusively mine.  I have to thank you not only for your own brilliant contributions, but for those of the colleagues you secured.  Monsieur Savarin's piquant criticisms were most valuable to us at starting.  I regret to have lost his aid. But as he has set up a new journal of his own, even he has not wit enough to spare for another.  _A propos_ of our contributors, I shall ask you to present me to the fair author of The Artist's Daughter.  I am of too prosaic a nature to appreciate justly the merits of a _roman_; but I have heard warm praise of this story from the young--they are the best judges of that kind of literature; and I can at least understand the worth of a contributor who trebled the sale of our journal.  It is a misfortune to us, indeed, that her work is completed, but I trust that the sum sent to her through our publisher suffices to tempt her to favour us with another roman in series.\"  \"Mademoiselle Cicogna,\" said Rameau, with a somewhat sharper intonation of his sharp voice, \"has accepted for the republication of her _roman_ in a separate form terms which attest the worth of her genius, and has had offers from other journals for a serial tale of even higher amount than the sum so generously sent to her through your publisher.\"  \"Has she accepted them, Monsieur Rameau?  If so, _tant pis pour vous_. Pardon me, I mean that your salary suffers in proportion as the Sens Commun declines in sale.\"  \"She has not accepted them.  I advised her not to do so until she could compare them with those offered by the proprietor of the Sens Commun.\"  \"And your advice guides her?  Ah, _cher confrere_, you are a happy man!-- you have influence over this young aspirant to the fame of a De Stael or a Georges Sand.\"  \"I flatter myself that I have some,\" answered Rameau, smiling loftily as he helped himself to another tumbler of.  Volnay wine--excellent, but rather heady.  \"So much the better.  I leave you free to arrange terms with Mademoiselle Cicogna, higher than she can obtain elsewhere, and kindly contrive my own personal introduction to her--you have breakfasted already?--permit me to offer you a cigar--excuse me if I do not bear you company; I seldom smoke--never of a morning.  Now to business, and the state of France. Take that easy-chair, seat yourself comfortably.  So!  Listen!  If ever Mephistopheles revisit the earth, how he will laugh at Universal Suffrage and Vote by Ballot in an old country like France, as things to be admired by educated men, and adopted by friends of genuine freedom!\"  \"I don't understand you,\" said Rameau.  \"In this respect at least, let me hope that I can furnish you with understanding.  \"The Emperor has resorted to a plebiscite--viz., a vote by ballot and universal suffrage--as to certain popular changes which circumstances compel him to substitute for his former personal rule.  Is there a single intelligent Liberal who is not against that plebiscite?--is there any such who does not know that the appeal of the Emperor to universal suffrage and vote by ballot must result in a triumph over all the variations of free thought, by the unity which belongs to Order, represented through an able man at the head of the State?  The multitude never comprehend principles; principles are complex ideas; they comprehend a single idea, and the simplest idea is, a Name that rids their action of all responsibility to thought.  \"Well, in France there are principles superabundant which you can pit against the principle of Imperial rule.  But there is not one name you can pit against Napoleon the Third; therefore, I steer our little bark in the teeth of the popular gale when I denounce the plebiscite, and Le Sens Commun will necessarily fall in sale--it is beginning to fall already. We shall have the educated men with us, the rest against.  In every country--even in China, where all are highly educated--a few must be yet more highly educated than the many.  Monsieur Rameau, I desire to overthrow the Empire: in order to do that, it is not enough to have on my side the educated men, I must have the _canaille_--the _canaille_ of Paris and of the manufacturing towns.  But I use the canaille for my purpose--I don't mean to enthrone it.  You comprehend?--the _canaille quiescent_ is simply mud at the bottom of a stream; the _canaille_ agitated is mud at the surface.  But no man capable of three ideas builds the palaces and senates of civilised society out of mud, be it at the top or the bottom of an ocean.  Can either you or I desire that the destinies of France shall be swayed by coxcombical artisans who think themselves superior to every man who writes grammar, and whose idea of a common- wealth is the confiscation of private property?\"  Rameau, thoroughly puzzled by this discourse, bowed his head, and replied whisperingly, \"Proceed.  You are against the Empire, yet against the populace!--What are you "]]]
