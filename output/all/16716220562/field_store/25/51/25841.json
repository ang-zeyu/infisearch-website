On the generous Boldheart’s proposal, it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked, but should be allowed to remain raw, on two conditions, namely:  1. That he should never, under any circumstances, presume to teach any boy anything any more.  2. That, if taken back to England, he should pass his life in travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done, and should do their exercises for those boys for nothing, and never say a word about it.  Drawing the sword from its sheath, Boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade.  The prisoner wept bitterly, and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career.  The captain then ordered his boat’s crew to make ready for a volley, and after firing to re-load quickly.  ‘And expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels,’ murmured William Boozey; ‘for I’m a-looking at ye.’ With those words, the derisive though deadly William took a good aim.  ‘Fire!’  The ringing voice of Boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages.  Volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes.  Hundreds of savages were killed, hundreds wounded, and thousands ran howling into the woods.  The Latin-grammar master had a spare night-cap lent him, and a long-tail coat, which he wore hind side before. He presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance, and serve him right.  We now find Capt. Boldheart, with this rescued wretch on board, standing off for other islands.  At one of these, not a cannibal island, but a pork and vegetable one, he married (only in fun on his part) the king’s daughter.  Here he rested some time, receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones, gold dust, elephants’ teeth, and sandal wood, and getting very rich.  This, too, though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men.  The ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things, Boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor, and turn ‘The Beauty’s’ head towards England.  These orders were obeyed with three cheers; and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile William.  We next find Capt. Boldheart about three leagues off Madeira, surveying through his spy-glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him.  On his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to, she ran up a flag, which he instantly recognised as the flag from the mast in the back-garden at home.  Inferring from this, that his father had put to sea to seek his long-lost son, the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger to inquire if this was so, and, if so, whether his father’s intentions were strictly honourable.  The boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat, and reported that the stranger was ‘The Family,’ of twelve hundred tons, and had not only the captain’s father on board, but also his mother, with the majority of his aunts and uncles, and all his cousins.  It was further reported to Boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner, and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them.  Boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board ‘The Beauty,’ and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day.  It was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the Latin-grammar master.  That thankless traitor was found out, as the two ships lay near each other, communicating with ‘The Family’ by signals, and offering to give up Boldheart.  He was hanged at the yard-arm the first thing in the morning, after having it impressively pointed out to him by Boldheart that this was what spiters came to.  The meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears. His uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too, but he wasn’t going to stand that.  His cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men, and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform.  He kindly conducted them round the vessel, and pointed out everything worthy of notice.  He also fired his hundred guns, and found it amusing to witness their alarm.  The entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship, and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning.  Only one disagreeable incident occurred.  Capt. Boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin Tom in irons, for being disrespectful.  On the boy’s promising amendment, however, he was humanely released after a few hours’ close confinement.  Boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin, and asked after the young lady with whom, it was well known to the world, he was in love. His mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at Margate, for the benefit of sea-bathing (it was the month of September), but that she feared the young lady’s friends were still opposed to the union.  Boldheart at once resolved, if necessary, to bombard the town.  Taking the command of his ship with this intention, and putting all but fighting men on board ‘The Family,’ with orders to that vessel to keep in company, Boldheart soon anchored in Margate Roads.  Here he went ashore well-armed, and attended by his boat’s crew (at their head the faithful though ferocious William), and demanded to see the mayor, who came out of his office.  ‘Dost know the name of yon ship, mayor?’ asked Boldheart fiercely.  ‘No,’ said the mayor, rubbing his eyes, which he could scarce believe, when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor.  ‘She is named “The Beauty,”’ said the captain.  ‘Hah!’ exclaimed the mayor, with a start.  ‘And you, then, are Capt. Boldheart?’  ‘The same.’  A pause ensued.  The mayor trembled.  ‘Now, mayor,’ said the captain, ‘choose!  Help me to my bride, or be bombarded.’  The mayor begged for two hours’ grace, in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady.  Boldheart accorded him but one; and during that one placed William Boozey sentry over him, with a drawn sword, and instructions to accompany him wherever he went, and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false.  At the end of the hour the mayor re-appeared more dead than alive, closely waited on by Boozey more alive than dead.  ‘Captain,’ said the mayor, ‘I have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe.  Even now she waits her turn for a machine.  The tide is low, though rising.  I, in one of our town-boats, shall not be suspected. When she comes forth in her bathing-dress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine, my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return.  Do you the rest.’  ‘Mayor,’ returned Capt. Boldheart, ‘thou hast saved thy town.’  The captain then signalled his boat to take him off, and, steering her himself, ordered her crew to row towards the bathing-ground, and there to rest upon their oars.  All happened as had been arranged.  His lovely bride came forth, the mayor glided in behind her, she became confused, and had floated out of her depth, when, with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat’s crew, her adoring Boldheart held her in his strong arms.  There her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy.  Before ‘The Beauty’ could get under way, the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour, and the ringing of all the bells, announced to the brave Boldheart that he had nothing to fear.  He therefore determined to be married on the spot, and signalled for a clergyman and clerk, who came off promptly in a sailing-boat named ‘The Skylark.’  Another great entertainment was then given on board ‘The Beauty,’ in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger.  He returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether Capt. Boldheart, in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate, would consent to be made a lieutenant-colonel.  For himself he would have spurned the worthless boon; but his bride wished it, and he consented.  Only one thing further happened before the good ship ‘Family’ was dismissed, with rich presents to all on board.  It is painful to record (but such is human nature in some cousins) that Capt. Boldheart’s unmannerly Cousin Tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a rope’s end ‘for cheekiness and making game,’ when Capt. Boldheart’s lady begged for him, and he was spared.  ‘The Beauty’ then refitted, and the captain and his bride departed for the Indian Ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore.     PART IV. ROMANCE FROM THE PEN OF MISS NETTIE ASHFORD {274}   THERE is a country, which I will show you when I get into maps, where the children have everything their own way.  It is a most delightful country to live in.  The grown-up people are obliged to obey the children, and are never allowed to sit up to supper, except on their birthdays.  The children order them to make jam and jelly and marmalade, and tarts and pies and puddings, and all manner of pastry.  If they say they won’t, they are put in the corner till they do.  They are sometimes allowed to have some; but when they have some, they generally have powders given them afterwards.  One of the inhabitants of this country, a truly sweet young creature of the name of Mrs. Orange, had the misfortune to be sadly plagued by her numerous family.  Her parents required a great deal of looking after, and they had connections and companions who were scarcely ever out of mischief.  So Mrs. Orange said to herself, ‘I really cannot be troubled with these torments any longer: I must put them all to school.’  Mrs. Orange took off her pinafore, and dressed herself very nicely, and took up her baby, and went out to call upon another lady of the name of Mrs. Lemon, who kept a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/809"],["title","Holiday Romance (#6)"],["body","establishment.  Mrs. Orange stood upon the scraper to pull at the bell, and give a ring-ting-ting.  Mrs. Lemon’s neat little housemaid, pulling up her socks as she came along the passage, answered the ring-ting-ting.  ‘Good-morning,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘Fine day.  How do you do?  Mrs. Lemon at home!’  ‘Yes, ma’am.’  ‘Will you say Mrs. Orange and baby?’  ‘Yes, ma’am.  Walk in.’  Mrs. Orange’s baby was a very fine one, and real wax all over.  Mrs. Lemon’s baby was leather and bran.  However, when Mrs. Lemon came into the drawing-room with her baby in her arms, Mrs. Orange said politely, ‘Good-morning.  Fine day.  How do you do?  And how is little Tootleumboots?’  ‘Well, she is but poorly.  Cutting her teeth, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘O, indeed, ma’am!’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘No fits, I hope?’  ‘No, ma’am.’  ‘How many teeth has she, ma’am?’  ‘Five, ma’am.’  ‘My Emilia, ma’am, has eight,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘Shall we lay them on the mantelpiece side by side, while we converse?’  ‘By all means, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘Hem!’  ‘The first question is, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange, ‘I don’t bore you?’  ‘Not in the least, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘Far from it, I assure you.’  ‘Then pray _have_ you,’ said Mrs. Orange,—‘_have_ you any vacancies?’  ‘Yes, ma’am.  How many might you require?’  ‘Why, the truth is, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange, ‘I have come to the conclusion that my children,’—O, I forgot to say that they call the grown-up people children in that country!—‘that my children are getting positively too much for me.  Let me see.  Two parents, two intimate friends of theirs, one godfather, two godmothers, and an aunt.  _Have_ you as many as eight vacancies?’  ‘I have just eight, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘Most fortunate!  Terms moderate, I think?’  ‘Very moderate, ma’am.’  ‘Diet good, I believe?’  ‘Excellent, ma’am.’  ‘Unlimited?’  ‘Unlimited.’  ‘Most satisfactory!  Corporal punishment dispensed with?’  ‘Why, we do occasionally shake,’ said Mrs. Lemon, ‘and we have slapped. But only in extreme cases.’  ‘_Could_ I, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange,—‘_could_ I see the establishment?’  ‘With the greatest of pleasure, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  Mrs. Lemon took Mrs. Orange into the schoolroom, where there were a number of pupils.  ‘Stand up, children,’ said Mrs. Lemon; and they all stood up.  Mrs. Orange whispered to Mrs. Lemon, ‘There is a pale, bald child, with red whiskers, in disgrace.  Might I ask what he has done?’  ‘Come here, White,’ said Mrs. Lemon, ‘and tell this lady what you have been doing.’  ‘Betting on horses,’ said White sulkily.  ‘Are you sorry for it, you naughty child?’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘No,’ said White.  ‘Sorry to lose, but shouldn’t be sorry to win.’  ‘There’s a vicious boy for you, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘Go along with you, sir.  This is Brown, Mrs. Orange.  O, a sad case, Brown’s!  Never knows when he has had enough.  Greedy.  How is your gout, sir?’  ‘Bad,’ said Brown.  ‘What else can you expect?’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘Your stomach is the size of two.  Go and take exercise directly.  Mrs. Black, come here to me. Now, here is a child, Mrs. Orange, ma’am, who is always at play.  She can’t be kept at home a single day together; always gadding about and spoiling her clothes.  Play, play, play, play, from morning to night, and to morning again.  How can she expect to improve?’  ‘Don’t expect to improve,’ sulked Mrs. Black.  ‘Don’t want to.’  ‘There is a specimen of her temper, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘To see her when she is tearing about, neglecting everything else, you would suppose her to be at least good-humoured.  But bless you! ma’am, she is as pert and flouncing a minx as ever you met with in all your days!’  ‘You must have a great deal of trouble with them, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘Ah, I have, indeed, ma’am!’ said Mrs. Lemon.  ‘What with their tempers, what with their quarrels, what with their never knowing what’s good for them, and what with their always wanting to domineer, deliver me from these unreasonable children!’  ‘Well, I wish you good-morning, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘Well, I wish you good-morning, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Lemon.  So Mrs. Orange took up her baby and went home, and told the family that plagued her so that they were all going to be sent to school.  They said they didn’t want to go to school; but she packed up their boxes, and packed them off.  ‘O dear me, dear me!  Rest and be thankful!’ said Mrs. Orange, throwing herself back in her little arm-chair.  ‘Those troublesome troubles are got rid of, please the pigs!’  Just then another lady, named Mrs. Alicumpaine, came calling at the street-door with a ring-ting-ting.  ‘My dear Mrs. Alicumpaine,’ said Mrs. Orange, ‘how do you do?  Pray stay to dinner.  We have but a simple joint of sweet-stuff, followed by a plain dish of bread and treacle; but, if you will take us as you find us, it will be _so_ kind!’  ‘Don’t mention it,’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine.  ‘I shall be too glad.  But what do you think I have come for, ma’am?  Guess, ma’am.’  ‘I really cannot guess, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘Why, I am going to have a small juvenile party to-night,’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine; ‘and if you and Mr. Orange and baby would but join us, we should be complete.’  ‘More than charmed, I am sure!’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘So kind of you!’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine.  ‘But I hope the children won’t bore you?’  ‘Dear things!  Not at all,’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘I dote upon them.’  Mr. Orange here came home from the city; and he came, too, with a ring-ting-ting.  ‘James love,’ said Mrs. Orange, ‘you look tired.  What has been doing in the city to-day?’  ‘Trap, bat, and ball, my dear,’ said Mr. Orange, ‘and it knocks a man up.’  ‘That dreadfully anxious city, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange to Mrs. Alicumpaine; ‘so wearing, is it not?’  ‘O, so trying!’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine.  ‘John has lately been speculating in the peg-top ring; and I often say to him at night, “John, _is_ the result worth the wear and tear?”’  Dinner was ready by this time: so they sat down to dinner; and while Mr. Orange carved the joint of sweet-stuff, he said, ‘It’s a poor heart that never rejoices.  Jane, go down to the cellar, and fetch a bottle of the Upest ginger-beer.’  At tea-time, Mr. and Mrs. Orange, and baby, and Mrs. Alicumpaine went off to Mrs. Alicumpaine’s house.  The children had not come yet; but the ball-room was ready for them, decorated with paper flowers.  ‘How very sweet!’ said Mrs. Orange.  ‘The dear things!  How pleased they will be!’  ‘I don’t care for children myself,’ said Mr. Orange, gaping.  ‘Not for girls?’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine.  ‘Come! you care for girls?’  Mr. Orange shook his head, and gaped again.  ‘Frivolous and vain, ma’am.’  ‘My dear James,’ cried Mrs. Orange, who had been peeping about, ‘do look here.  Here’s the supper for the darlings, ready laid in the room behind the folding-doors.  Here’s their little pickled salmon, I do declare! And here’s their little salad, and their little roast beef and fowls, and their little pastry, and their wee, wee, wee champagne!’  ‘Yes, I thought it best, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine, ‘that they should have their supper by themselves.  Our table is in the corner here, where the gentlemen can have their wineglass of negus, and their egg-sandwich, and their quiet game at beggar-my-neighbour, and look on.  As for us, ma’am, we shall have quite enough to do to manage the company.’  ‘O, indeed, you may say so!  Quite enough, ma’am,’ said Mrs. Orange.  The company began to come.  The first of them was a stout boy, with a white top-knot and spectacles.  The housemaid brought him in and said, ‘Compliments, and at what time was he to be fetched!’  Mrs. Alicumpaine said, ‘Not a moment later than ten.  How do you do, sir?  Go and sit down.’  Then a number of other children came; boys by themselves, and girls by themselves, and boys and girls together.  They didn’t behave at all well.  Some of them looked through quizzing-glasses at others, and said, ‘Who are those?  Don’t know them.’  Some of them looked through quizzing-glasses at others, and said, ‘How do?’  Some of them had cups of tea or coffee handed to them by others, and said, ‘Thanks; much!’  A good many boys stood about, and felt their shirt-collars.  Four tiresome fat boys _would_ stand in the doorway, and talk about the newspapers, till Mrs. Alicumpaine went to them and said, ‘My dears, I really cannot allow you to prevent people from coming in.  I shall be truly sorry to do it; but, if you put yourself in everybody’s way, I must positively send you home.’  One boy, with a beard and a large white waistcoat, who stood straddling on the hearth-rug warming his coat-tails, _was_ sent home. ‘Highly incorrect, my dear,’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine, handing him out of the room, ‘and I cannot permit it.’  There was a children’s band,—harp, cornet, and piano,—and Mrs. Alicumpaine and Mrs. Orange bustled among the children to persuade them to take partners and dance.  But they were so obstinate!  For quite a long time they would not be persuaded to take partners and dance.  Most of the boys said, ‘Thanks; much!  But not at present.’  And most of the rest of the boys said, ‘Thanks; much!  But never do.’  ‘O, these children are very wearing!’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine to Mrs. Orange.  ‘Dear things!  I dote upon them; but they ARE wearing,’ said Mrs. Orange to Mrs. Alicumpaine.  At last they did begin in a slow and melancholy way to slide about to the music; though even then they wouldn’t mind what they were told, but would have this partner, and wouldn’t have that partner, and showed temper about it.  And they wouldn’t smile,—no, not on any account they wouldn’t; but, when the music stopped, went round and round the room in dismal twos, as if everybody else was dead.  ‘O, it’s very hard indeed to get these vexing children to be entertained!’ said Mrs. Alicumpaine to Mrs. Orange.  ‘I dote upon the darlings; but it is hard,’ said Mrs. Orange to Mrs. Alicumpaine.  They were trying children, that’s the truth."]]]
