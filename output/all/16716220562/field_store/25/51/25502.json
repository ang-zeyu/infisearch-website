I yield myself your prisoner.\"  \"A horse for my captive!\" said Warwick, laughing; \"and hear me promise you, that he shall go unscathed in goods and in limbs.  God wot, when Warwick and the people meet, no victim should be sacrificed!  Hurrah for King Edward and fair England!\"  He waved his plumed cap as he spoke, and within the walls of Olney was heard the shout that answered.  Slowly the earl and his scanty troop turned the rein; as he receded, the multitude broke up rapidly, and when the moon rose, that camp was a solitude.  [The dispersion of the rebels at Olney is forcibly narrated by a few sentences, graphic from their brief simplicity, in the \"Pictorial History of England,\" Book V, p. 104.  \"They (Warwick, etc.) repaired in a very friendly manner to Olney, where they found Edward in a most unhappy condition; his friends were dead or scattered, flying for their lives, or hiding themselves in remote places: the insurgents were almost upon him.  A word from Warwick sent the insurgents quietly back to the North.\"]  Such--for our nature is ever grander in the individual than the mass-- such is the power of man above mankind!     CHAPTER IV.  THE NORMAN EARL AND THE SAXON DEMAGOGUE CONFER.  On leaving the camp, Warwick rode in advance of his train, and his countenance was serious and full of thought.  At length, as a turn in the road hid the little band from the view of the rebels, the earl motioned to Marmaduke to advance with his prisoner.  The young Nevile then fell back, and Robin and Warwick rode breast to breast out of hearing of the rest.  \"Master Hilyard, I am well content that my brother, when you fell into his hands, spared your life out of gratitude for the favour you once showed to mine.\"  \"Your noble brother, my lord,\" answered Robin, dryly, \"is, perhaps, not aware of the service I once rendered you.  Methinks he spared me rather, because, without me, an enterprise which has shaken the Woodvilles from their roots around the throne, and given back England to the Neviles, had been nipped in the bud!--Your brother is a deep thinker!\"  \"I grieve to hear thee speak thus of the Lord Montagu.  I know that he hath wilier devices than become, in my eyes, a well-born knight and a sincere man; but he loves his king, and his ends are juster than his means.  Master Hilyard, enough of the past evil.  Some months after the field of Hexham, I chanced to fall, when alone, amongst a band of roving and fierce Lancastrian outlaws.  Thou, their leader, recognizing the crest on my helm, and mindful of some slight indulgence once shown to thy strange notions of republican liberty, didst save me from the swords of thy followers: from that time I have sought in vain to mend thy fortunes.  Thou hast rejected all mine offers, and I know well that thou hast lent thy service to the fatal cause of Lancaster.  Many a time I might have given thee to the law; but gratitude for thy aid in the needful strait, and to speak sooth, my disdain of all individual efforts to restore a fallen House, made me turn my eyes from transgressions which, once made known to the king, had placed thee beyond pardon.  I see now that thou art a man of head and arm to bring great danger upon nations; and though this time Warwick bids thee escape and live, if once more thou offend, know me only as the king's minister.  The debt between us is now cancelled. Yonder lies the path that conducts to the forest.  Farewell.  Yet stay!--poverty may have led thee into treason?\"  \"Poverty,\" interrupted Hilyard,--\"poverty, Lord Warwick, leads men to sympathize with the poor, and therefore I have done with riches.\"  He paused, and his breast heaved.  \"Yet,\" he added sadly, \"now that I have seen the cowardice and ingratitude of men, my calling seems over, and my spirit crushed.\"  \"Alas!\" said Warwick, \"whether man be rich or poor, ingratitude is the vice of men; and you, who have felt it from the mob, menace me with it from the king.  But each must carve out his own way through this earth, without over care for applause or blame; and the tomb is the sole judge of mortal memory.\"  Robin looked hard at the earl's face, which was dark and gloomy, as he thus spoke, and approaching nearer, he said, \"Lord Warwick, I take from you liberty and life the more willingly, because a voice I cannot mistake tells me, and hath long told, that, sooner or later, time will bind us to each other.  Unlike other nobles, you have owed your power not so much to lordship, land, and birth, and a king's smile, as to the love you have nobly won; you alone, true knight and princely Christian,--you alone, in war, have spared the humble; you alone, stalwart and resistless champion, have directed your lance against your equals, and your order hath gone forth to the fierce of heart, 'Never smite the commons!'  In peace, you alone have stood up in your haughty parliament for just law or for gentle mercy; your castle hath had a board for the hungry and a shelter for the houseless; your pride, which hath bearded kings and humbled upstarts, hath never had a taunt for the lowly; and therefore I--son of the people--in the people's name, bless you living, and sigh to ask whether a people's gratitude will mourn you dead!  Beware Edward's false smile, beware Clarence's fickle faith, beware Gloucester's inscrutable wile!  Mark, the sun sets!--and while we speak, yon dark cloud gathers over your plumed head.\"  He pointed to the heavens as he ceased, and a low roll of gathering thunder seemed to answer his ominous warning.  Without tarrying for the earl's answer, Hilyard shook the reins of his steed, and disappeared in the winding of the lane through which be took his way.     CHAPTER V.  WHAT FAITH EDWARD IV. PURPOSETH TO KEEP WITH EARL AND PEOPLE.  Edward received his triumphant envoy with open arms and profuse expressions of gratitude.  He exerted himself to the utmost in the banquet that crowned the day, not only to conciliate the illustrious new comers, but to remove from the minds of Raoul de Fulke and his officers all memory of their past disaffection.  No gift is rarer or more successful in the intrigues of life than that which Edward eminently possessed,--namely, the hypocrisy of frankness. Dissimulation is often humble, often polished, often grave, sleek, smooth, decorous; but it is rarely gay and jovial, a hearty laughter, a merry, cordial, boon companion.  Such, however, was the felicitous craft of Edward IV.; and, indeed, his spirits were naturally so high, his good humour so flowing, that this joyous hypocrisy cost him no effort.  Elated at the dispersion of his foes, at the prospect of his return to his ordinary life of pleasure, there was something so kindly and so winning in his mirth, that he subjugated entirely the fiery temper of Raoul de Fulke and the steadier suspicions of the more thoughtful St. John.  Clarence, wholly reconciled to Edward, gazed on him with eyes swimming with affection, and soon drank himself into uproarious joviality.  The archbishop, more reserved, still animated the society by the dry and epigrammatic wit not uncommon to his learned and subtle mind.  But Warwick in vain endeavoured to shake off an uneasy, ominous gloom.  He was not satisfied with Edward's avoidance of discussion upon the grave matters involved in the earl's promise to the insurgents, and his masculine spirit regarded with some disdain, and more suspicion, a levity that he considered ill-suited to the emergence.  The banquet was over, and Edward, having dismissed his other attendants, was in his chamber with Lord Hastings, whose office always admitted him to the wardrobe of the king.  Edward's smile had now left his lip; he paced the room with a hasty stride, and then suddenly opening the casement, pointed to the landscape without, which lay calm and suffused in moonlight.  \"Hastings,\" said he, abruptly, \"a few hours since and the earth grew spears!  Behold the landscape now!\"  \"So vanish all the king's enemies!\"  \"Ay, man, ay,--if at the king's word, or before the king's battle-axe; but at a subject's command--No, I am not a king while another scatters armies in my realm at his bare will.  'Fore Heaven, this shall not last!\"  Hastings regarded the countenance of Edward, changed from affable beauty into terrible fierceness, with reflections suggested by his profound and mournful wisdom.  \"How little a man's virtues profit him in the eyes of men!\" thought he.  \"The subject saves the crown, and the crown's wearer never pardons the presumption!\"  \"You do not speak, sir!\" exclaimed Edward, irritated and impatient. \"Why gaze you thus on me?\"  \"Beau sire,\" returned the favourite, calmly, \"I was seeking to discover if your pride spoke, or your nobler nature.\"  \"Tush!\" said the king, petulantly, \"the noblest part of a king's nature is his pride as king!\" Again he strode the chamber, and again halted.  \"But the earl hath fallen into his own snare,--he hath promised in my name what I will not perform.  Let the people learn that their idol hath deceived them.  He asks me to dismiss from the court the queen's mother and kindred!\"  Hastings, who in this went thoroughly with the earl and the popular feeling, and whose only enemies in England were the Woodvilles, replied simply,--  \"These are cheap terms, sire, for a king's life and the crown of England.\"  Edward started, and his eyes flashed that cold, cruel fire, which makes eyes of a light colouring so far more expressive of terrible passions than the quicker and warmer heat of dark orbs.  \"Think you so, sir?  By God's blood, he who proffered them shall repent it in every vein of his body!  Hark ye, William Hastings de Hastings, I know you to be a deep and ambitious man; but better for you had you covered"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7721"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 07 (#7)"],["body","learned brain under the cowl of a mendicant friar than lent one thought to the counsels of the Earl of Warwick.\"  Hastings, who felt even to fondness the affection which Edward generally inspired in those about his person, and who, far from sympathizing, except in hate of the Woodvilles, with the earl, saw that beneath that mighty tree no new plants could push into their fullest foliage, reddened with anger at this imperious menace.  \"My liege,\" said he, with becoming dignity and spirit, \"if you can thus address your most tried confidant and your lealest friend, your most dangerous enemy is yourself.\"  \"Stay, man,\" said the king, softening.  \"I was over warm, but the wild beast within me is chafed.  Would Gloucester were here!\"  \"I can tell you what would be the counsels of that wise young prince, for I know his mind,\" answered Hastings.  \"Ay, he and you love each other well.  Speak out.\"  \"Prince Richard is a great reader of Italian lere.  He saith that those small States are treasuries of all experience.  From that lere Prince Richard would say to you, 'Where a subject is so great as to be feared, and too much beloved to be destroyed, the king must remember how Tarpeia was crushed.\"  \"I remember naught of Tarpeia, and I detest parables.\"  \"Tarpeia, sire (it is a story of old Rome), was crushed under the weight of presents.  Oh, my liege,\" continued Hastings, warming with that interest which an able man feels in his own superior art, \"were I king for a year, by the end of it Warwick should be the most unpopular (and therefore the weakest) lord in England!\"  \"And how, O wise in thine own conceit?\"  \"Beau sire,\" resumed Hastings, not heeding the rebuke--and strangely enough he proceeded to point out, as the means of destroying the earl's influence, the very method that the archbishop had detailed to Montagu as that which would make the influence irresistible and permanent--\"Beau sire,\" resumed Hastings, \"Lord Warwick is beloved by the people, because they consider him maltreated; he is esteemed by the people, because they consider him above all bribe; he is venerated by the people, because they believe that in all their complaints and struggles he is independent (he alone) of the king.  Instead of love, I would raise envy; for instead of cold countenance I would heap him with grace.  Instead of esteem and veneration I would raise suspicion; for I would so knit him to your House, that he could not stir hand or foot against you; I would make his heirs your brothers.  The Duke of Clarence hath married one daughter,--wed the other to Lord Richard. Betroth your young princess to Montagu's son, the representative of all the Neviles.  The earl's immense possessions must thus ultimately pass to your own kindred.  The earl himself will be no longer a power apart from the throne, but a part of it.  The barons will chafe against one who half ceases to be of their order, and yet monopolizes their dignities; the people will no longer see in the earl their champion, but a king's favourite and deputy.  Neither barons nor people will flock to his banner.\"  \"All this is well and wise,\" said Edward, musing; \"but meanwhile my queen's blood?  Am I to reign in a solitude?--for look you, Hastings, you know well that, uxorious as fools have deemed me, I had purpose and design in the elevation of new families; I wished to raise a fresh nobility to counteract the pride of the old, and only upon new nobles can a new dynasty rely.\"  \"My Lord, I will not anger you again; but still, for a while, the queen's relations will do well to retire.\"  \"Good night, Hastings,\" interrupted Edward, abruptly, \"my pillow in this shall be my counsellor.\"  Whatever the purpose solitude and reflection might ripen in the king's mind, he was saved from immediate decision by news, the next morning, of fresh outbreaks.  The commons had risen in Lincolnshire and the county of Warwick; and Anthony Woodville wrote word that, if the king would but show himself among the forces he had raised near Coventry, all the gentry around would rise against the rebellious rabble. Seizing advantage of these tidings, borne to him by his own couriers, and eager to escape from the uncertain soldiery quartered at Olney, Edward, without waiting to consult even with the earl, sprang to horse, and his trumpets were the first signal of departure that he deigned to any one.  This want of ceremony displeased the pride of Warwick; but he made no complaint, and took his place by the king's side, when Edward said shortly,--  \"Dear cousin, this is a time that needs all our energies.  I ride towards Coventry, to give head and heart to the raw recruits I shall find there; but I pray you and the archbishop to use all means, in this immediate district, to raise fresh troops; for at your name armed men spring up from pasture and glebe, dyke and hedge.  Join what troops you can collect in three days with mine at Coventry, and, ere the sickle is in the harvest, England shall be at peace.  God speed you!  Ho! there, gentlemen, away!--a franc etrier!\"  Without pausing for reply,--for he wished to avoid all questioning, lest Warwick might discover that it was to a Woodville that he was bound,--the king put spurs to his horse, and, while his men were yet hurrying to and fro, rode on almost alone, and was a good mile out of the town before the force led by St. John and Raoul de Fulke, and followed by Hastings, who held no command, overtook him.  \"I misthink the king,\" said Warwick, gloomily; \"but my word is pledged to the people, and it shall be kept.\"  \"A man's word is best kept when his arm is the strongest,\" said the sententious archbishop; \"yesterday, you dispersed an army; to-day, raise one!\"  Warwick answered not, but, after a moment's thought, beckoned to Marmaduke.  \"Kinsman,\" said he, \"spur on, with ten of my little company, to join the king.  Report to me if any of the Woodvilles be in his camp near Coventry.\"  \"Whither shall I send the report?\"  \"To my castle of Warwick.\"  Marmaduke bowed his head, and, accustomed to the brevity of the earl's speech, proceeded to the task enjoined him.  Warwick next summoned his second squire.  \"My lady and her children,\" said he, \"are on their way to Middleham. This paper will instruct you of their progress.  Join them with all the rest of my troop, except my heralds and trumpeters; and say that I shall meet them ere long at Middleham.\"  \"It is a strange way to raise an army,\" said the archbishop, dryly, \"to begin by getting rid of all the force one possesses!\"  \"Brother,\" answered the earl, \"I would fain show my son-in-law, who may be the father of a line of kings, that a general may be helpless at the head of thousands, but that a man may stand alone who has the love of a nation.\"  \"May Clarence profit by the lesson!  Where is he all this while?\"  \"Abed,\" said the stout earl, with a slight accent of disdain; and then, in a softer voice, he added, \"youth is ever luxurious.  Better the slow man than the false one.\"  Leaving Warwick to discharge the duty enjoined him, we follow the dissimulating king.     CHAPTER VI.  WHAT BEFALLS KING EDWARD ON HIS ESCAPE FROM OLNEY.  As soon as Edward was out of sight of the spire of Olney, he slackened his speed, and beckoned Hastings to his side.  \"Dear Will,\" said the king, \"I have thought over thy counsel, and will find the occasion to make experiment thereof.  But, methinks, thou wilt agree with me that concessions come best from a king who has an army of his own.  'Fore Heaven, in the camp of a Warwick I have less power than a lieutenant!  Now mark me.  I go to head some recruits raised in haste near Coventry.  The scene of contest must be in the northern counties.  Wilt thou, for love of me, ride night and day, thorough brake, thorough briar, to Gloucester on the Borders?  Bid him march, if the Scot will let him, back to York; and if he cannot himself quit the Borders, let him send what men can be spared under thy banner.  Failing this, raise through Yorkshire all the men-at-arms thou canst collect.  But, above all, see Montagu.  Him and his army secure at all hazards.  If he demur, tell him his son shall marry his king's daughter, and wear the coronal of a duke.  Ha, ha! a large bait for so large a fish!  I see this is no casual outbreak, but a general convulsion of the realm; and the Earl of Warwick must not be the only man to smile or to frown back the angry elements.\"  \"In this, beau sire,\" answered Hastings, \"you speak as a king and a warrior should, and I will do my best to assert your royal motto,-- 'Modus et ordo.'  If I can but promise that your Highness has for a while dismissed the Woodville lords, rely upon it that ere two months I will place under your truncheon an army worthy of the liege lord of hardy England.\"  \"Go, dear Hastings, I trust all to thee!\" answered the king.  The nobleman kissed his sovereign's extended hand, closed his visor, and, motioning to his body-squire to follow him, disappeared down a green lane, avoiding such broader thoroughfares as might bring him in contact with the officers left at Olney.  In a small village near Coventry Sir Anthony Woodville had collected about two thousand men, chiefly composed of the tenants and vassals of the new nobility, who regarded the brilliant Anthony as their head. The leaders were gallant and ambitious gentlemen, as they who arrive at fortunes above their birth mostly are; but their vassals were little to be trusted.  For in that day clanship was still strong, and these followers had been bred in allegiance to Lancastrian lords, whose confiscated estates were granted to the Yorkist favourites.  The shout that welcomed the arrival of the king was therefore feeble and lukewarm; and, disconcerted by so chilling a reception, he dismounted, in less elevated spirits than those in which he had left Olney, at the pavilion of his brother-in-law.
