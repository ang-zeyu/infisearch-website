They, however, were not the same, for see No. 193. Sugar was clarified sometimes with wine [105].  Spices. _Species_. They are mentioned in general No. 133, and _whole spices_, 167, 168. but they are more commonly specified, and are indeed greatly used, though being imported from abroad, and from so far as Italy or the Levant (and even there must be dear), some may wonder at this: but it shouid be considered, that our Roll was chiefly compiled for the use of noble and princely tables; and the same may be said of the Editor's MS. The spices came from the same part of the world, and by the same route, as sugar did. The _spicery_ was an ancient department at court, and had its proper officers.  As to the particular sorts, these are,  Cinamon. _Canell_. 14. 191. _Canel_, Editor's MS. 10. _Kanell_, ibid. 32. is the Italian _Canella_. See Chaucer. We have the flour or powder, No. 20. 62. See Wiclif. It is not once mentioned in Apicius.  Macys, 14. 121. Editor's MS. 10. _Maces_, 134. Editor's MS. 27. They are used whole, No. 158. and are always expressed plurally, though we now use the singular, _mace_. See Junii Etym.  Cloves. No. 20. Dishes are flourished with them, 22. 158. Editor's MS. 10. 27. where we have _clowys gylofres_, as in our Roll, No. 104. _Powdour gylofre_ occurs 65. 191. Chaucer has _clowe_ in the singular, and see him v. Clove-gelofer.  Galyngal, 30. and elsewhere. Galangal, the long rooted cyperus [106], is a warm cardiac and cephalic. It is used in powder, 30. 47. and was the chief ingredient in _galentine_, which, I think, took its name from it.  Pepper. It appears from Pliny that this pungent, warm seasoning, so much in esteem at Rome [107], came from the East Indies [108], and, as we may suppose, by way of Alexandria. We obtained it no doubt, in the 14th century, from the same quarter, though not exactly by the same route, but by Venice or Genoa. It is used both whole, No. 35, and in powder, No. 83. And long-pepper occurs, if we read the place rightly, in No. 191.  Ginger, gyngyn. 64. 136. alibi. Powder is used, 17. 20. alibi. and Rabelais IV. c. 59. the white powder, 131. and it is the name of a mess, 139. quære whether _gyngyn_ is not misread for _gyngyr_, for see Junii Etym. The Romans had their ginger from Troglodytica [109].  Cubebs, 64. 121. are a warm spicy grain from the east.  Grains of Paradice, or _de parys_, 137. [110] are the greater cardamoms.  Noix muscadez, 191. nutmegs.  The caraway is once mentioned, No. 53. and was an exotic from _Caria_, whence, according to Mr. Lye, it took its name: 'sunt semina, inquit, _carri_ vel _carrei_, sic dicti a Caria, ubi copiosissimè nascitur [111].'  Powder-douce, which occurs so often, has been thought by some, who have just peeped into our Roll, to be the same as sugar, and only a different name for it; but they are plainly mistaken, as is evident from 47. 51. 164. 165. where they are mentioned together as different things. In short, I take powder-douce to be either powder of galyngal, for see Editor's MS II. 20. 24, or a compound made of sundry aromatic spices ground or beaten small, and kept always ready at hand in some proper receptacle. It is otherwise termed _good powders_, 83. 130. and in Editor's MS 17. 37. 38 [112]. or _powder_ simply, No. 169, 170. _White powder-douce_ occurs No. 51, which seems to be the same as blanch-powder, 132. 193. called _blaynshe powder_, and bought ready prepared, in Northumb. Book, p. 19. It is sometimes used with powder-fort, 38. 156. for which see the next and last article.  Powder-fort, 10. 11. seems to be a mixture likewise of the warmer spices, pepper, ginger, &c. pulverized: hence we have _powder-fort of gynger, other of canel_, 14. It is called _strong powder_, 22. and perhaps may sometimes be intended by _good powders_. If you will suppose it to be kept ready prepared by the vender, it may be the _powder-marchant_, 113. 118. found joined in two places with powder- douce. This Speght says is what gingerbread is made of; but Skinner disapproves this explanation, yet, says Mr. Urry, gives none of his own.  After thus travelling through the most material and most used ingredients, the _spykenard de spayn_ occurring only once, I shall beg leave to offer a few words on the nature, and in favour of the present publication, and the method employed in the prosecution of it.  [Illustration: Take þe chese and of flessh of capouns, or of hennes & hakke smal and grynde hem smale inn a morter, take mylke of almandes with þe broth of freysh beef. oþer freysh flessh, & put the flessh in þe mylke oþer in the broth and set hem to þe fyre, & alye hem with flour of ryse, or gastbon, or amydoun as chargeaunt as þe blank desire, & with zolks of ayren and safroun for to make hit zelow, and when it is dressit in dysshes with blank desires; styk aboue clowes de gilofre, & strawe powdour of galyugale above, and serue it forth.]  The common language of the _formulæ_, though old and obsolete, as naturally may be expected from the age of the MS, has no other difficulty in it but what may easily be overcome by a small degree of practice and application [113]: however, for the further illustration of this matter, and the satisfaction of the curious, a _fac simile_ of one of the recipes is represented in the annexed plate. If here and there a hard and uncouth term or expression may occur, so as to stop or embarrass the less expert, pains have been taken to explain them, either in the annotations under the text, or in the Index and Glossary, for we have given it both titles, as intending it should answer the purpose of both [114]. Now in forming this alphabet, as it would have been an endless thing to have recourse to all our glossaries, now so numerous, we have confined ourselves, except perhaps in some few instances, in which the authorities are always mentioned, to certain contemporary writers, such as the Editor's MS, of which we shall speak more particularly hereafter, Chaucer, and Wiclif; with whom we have associated Junius' Etymologicon Anglicanum.  As the abbreviations of the Roll are here retained, in order to establish and confirm the age of it, it has been thought proper to adopt the types which our printer had projected for Domesday-Book, with which we find that our characters very nearly coincide.  The names of the dishes and sauces have occasioned the greatest perplexity. These are not only many in number, but are often so horrid and barbarous, to our ears at least, as to be inveloped in several instances in almost impenetrable obscurity. Bishop Godwin complains of this so long ago as 1616 [115]. The _Contents_ prefixed will exhibit at once a most formidable list of these hideous names and titles, so that there is no need to report them here. A few of these terms the Editor humbly hopes he has happily enucleated, but still, notwithstanding all his labour and pains, the argument is in itself so abstruse at this distance of time, the helps so few, and his abilities in this line of knowledge and science so slender and confined, that he fears he has left the far greater part of the task for the more sagacious reader to supply: indeed, he has not the least doubt, but other gentlemen of curiosity in such matters (and this publication is intended for them alone) will be so happy as to clear up several difficulties, which appear now to him insuperable. It must be confessed again, thatthe Editor may probably have often failed in those very points, which he fancies and flatters himself to have elucidated, but this he is willing to leave to the candour of the public.  Now in regard to the helps I mentioned; there is not much to be learnt from the Great Inthronization-feast of archbishop Robert Winchelsea, A. 1295, even if it were his; but I rather think it belongs to archbishop William Warham, A. 1504 [116]. Some use, however, has been made of it.  Ralph Bourne was installed abbot of St. Augustine's, near Canterbury, A. 1309; and William Thorne has inserted a list of provisions bought for the feast, with their prices, in his Chronicle [117].  The Great Feast at the Inthronization of George Nevile archbishop of York, 6 Edward IV. is printed by Mr. Hearne [118], and has been of good service.  Elizabeth, queen of king Henry VII. was crowned A. 1487, and the messes at the dinner, in two courses, are registered in the late edition of Leland's Collectenea, A. 1770 [119], and we have profited thereby.  The Lenten Inthronization-feast of archbishop William Warham, A. 1504 [120], given us at large by Mr. Hearne [121], has been also consulted.  There is a large catalogue of viands in Rabelais, lib. iv. cap. 59. 60. And the English translation of Mr. Ozell affording little information, I had recourse to the French original, but not to much more advantage.  There is also a Royal Feast at the wedding of the earl of Devonshire, in the Harleian Misc. No. 279, and it has not been neglected.  Randle Holme, in his multifarious _Academy of Armory_, has an alphabet of terms and dishes [122]; but though I have pressed him into the service, he has not contributed much as to the more difficult points.  The Antiquarian Repertory, vol. II. p. 211, exhibits an entertainment of the mayor of Rochester, A. 1460; but there is little to be learned from thence. The present work was printed before No. 31 of the Antiquarian Repertory, wherein some ancient recipes in Cookery are published, came to the Editor's hand.  I must not omit my acknowledgments to my learned friend the present dean of Carlisle, to whom I stand indebted for his useful notes on the Northumberland-Household Book, as also for the book itself.  Our chief assistance, however, has been drawn from a MS belonging to the Editor, denoted, when cited, by the signature _MS. Ed._ It is a vellum miscellany in small quarto, and the part respecting this subject consists of ninety-one English recipes (or _nyms_) in cookery. These are disposed into two parts, and are intituled, 'Hic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8102"],["title","The Forme of Cury: A Roll of Ancient English Cookery Compiled, about A.D. 1390 (#4)"],["body","universa servicia tam de carnibus quam de pissibus.' [123] The second part, relates to the dressing of fish, and other lenten fare, though forms are also there intermixed which properly belong to flesh-days. This leads me to observe, that both here, and in the Roll, messes are sometimes accommodated, by making the necessary alterations, both to flesh and fish-days. [124] Now, though the subjects of the MS are various, yet the hand-writing is uniform; and at the end of one of the tracts is added, 'Explicit massa Compoti, Anno Dñi M'lo CCC'mo octogesimo primo ipso die Felicis et Audacti.' [125], i.e. 30 Aug. 1381, in the reign of Rich. II. The language and orthography accord perfectly well with this date, and the collection is consequently contemporary with our Roll, and was made chiefly, though not altogether, for the use of great tables, as appears from the _sturgeon_, and the great quantity of venison therein prescribed for.  As this MS is so often referred to in the annotations, glossary, and even in this preface, and is a compilation of the same date, on the same subject, and in the same language, it has been thought adviseable to print it, and subjoin it to the Roll; and the rather, because it really furnishes a considerable enlargement on the subject, and exhibits many forms unnoticed in the Roll.  To conclude this tedious preliminary detail, though unquestionably a most necessary part of his duty, the Editor can scarcely forbear laughing at himself, when he reflects on his past labours, and recollects those lines of the poet Martial;    Turpe est difficiles habere nugas,   Et stultus labor est ineptiarum. II. 86.  and that possibly mesdames _Carter_ and _Raffald_, with twenty others, might have far better acquitted themselves in the administration of this province, than he has done. He has this comfort and satisfaction, however, that he has done his best; and that some considerable names amongst the learned, Humelbergius, Torinus, Barthius, our countryman Dr. Lister, Almeloveen, and others, have bestowed no less pains in illustrating an author on the same subject, and scarcely of more importance, the _Pseudo-Apicius_.  [1] If, according to Petavius and Le Clerc, the world was created in     autumn, when the fruits of the earth were both plentiful and in the     highest perfection, the first man had little occasion for much     culinary  knowledge; roasting or boiling the cruder productions, with     modes of preserving those which were better ripened, seem to be all     that was necessary for him in the way of _Cury_, And even after he     was displaced from Paradise, I conceive, as many others do, he was     not permitted the use of animal food [Gen. i. 29.]; but that this was     indulged to us, by an enlargement of our charter, after the Flood,     Gen. ix, 3. But, without wading any further in the argument here, the     reader is referred to Gen. ii. 8. seq. iii. 17, seq. 23.      [Addenda: add 'vi. 22. where _Noah_ and the beasts are to live on the     same food.'] [2] Genesis xviii. xxvii. Though their best repasts, from the     politeness of the times, were called by the simple names of _Bread_,     or a _Morsel of bread_, yet they were not unacquainted with modes of     dressing flesh, boiling, roasting, baking; nor with sauce, or     seasoning, as salt and oil, and perhaps some aromatic herbs.
