I have not yet heard of him as a _soldat de France_--I hear a great deal of him as a _viveur de Paris_.\"  \"Don't you know why his desire for a military career was frost-bitten?\"  \"No! why?\"  \"Alain came from Bretagne profoundly ignorant of most things known to a _gamin_ of Paris.  When he conscientiously overcame the scruples natural to one of his name and told the Duchesse de Tarascon that he was ready to fight under the flag of France whatever its colour, he had a vague reminiscence of ancestral Rochebriants earning early laurels at the head of their regiments.  At all events he assumed as a matter of course that he, in the first rank as _gentilhomme_, would enter the army, if as a _sous-lieutenant_, still as _gentilhomme_.  But when told that, as he had been at no military college, he could only enter the ranks as a private soldier--herd with private soldiers--for at least two years before, passing through the grade of corporal, his birth, education, habits of life could, with great favour, raise him to the station of a sous- lieutenant, you may conceive that the martial ardour of a Rochebriant was somewhat cooled.\"  \"If he knew what the dormitory of French privates is, and how difficult a man well educated well brought up, finds it, first, to endure the coarsest ribaldry and the loudest blasphemy, and then, having endured and been compelled to share them, ever enforce obedience and discipline as a superior among those with whom just before he was an equal, his ardour would not have been merely cooled--it would have been changed into despair for the armies of France, if hereafter they are met by those whose officers have been trained to be officers from the outset and have imbibed from their cradle an education not taught to the boy-pedants from school--the two-fold education how with courtesy to command, how with dignity to obey.  To return to Rochebriant, such salons as I frequent are somewhat formal--as befits my grave years and my modest income; I may add, now that you know my vocation, befits me also as a man who seeks rather to be instructed than amused.  In those salons I did, last year sometimes, however, meet Rochebriant--as I sometimes still meet you; but of late he has deserted such sober reunions, and I hear with pain that he is drifting among those rocks against which my own youth was shipwrecked. Is the report true?\"  \"I fear,\" said Enguerrand, reluctantly, \"that at least the report is not unfounded.  And my conscience accuses me of having been to blame in the first instance.  You see, when Alain made terms with Louvier by which he obtained a very fair income, if prudently managed, I naturally wished that a man of so many claims to social distinction, and who represents the oldest branch of my family, should take his right place in our world of Paris.  I gladly therefore presented him to the houses and the men most _a la mode_--advised him as to the sort of establishment, in apartments, horses, &c., which it appeared to me that he might reasonably afford--I mean such as, with his means, I should have prescribed to myself--\"  \"Ah! I understand.  But you, dear Enguerrand, are a born Parisian, every inch of you: and a born Parisian is, whatever be thought to the contrary, the best manager in the world.  He alone achieves the difficult art of uniting thrift with show.  It is your Provincial who comes to Paris in the freshness of undimmed youth, who sows his whole life on its barren streets.  I guess the rest: Alain is ruined.\"  Enguerrand, who certainly was so far a born Parisian that with all his shrewdness and _savoir faire_, he had a wonderfully sympathetic heart, very easily moved, one way or the other--Enguerrand winced at his elder kinsman's words complimentarily reproachful, and said in unwonted tones of humility: \"Cousin, you are cruel, but you are in the right.  I did not calculate sufficiently on the chances of Alain's head being turned.  Hear my excuse.  He seemed to me so much more thoughtful than most at our age are, so much more stately and proud; well, also so much more pure, so impressed with the responsibilities of station, so bent on retaining the old lands in Bretagne; by habit and rearing so simple and self-denying, --that I took it for granted he was proof against stronger temptations than those which a light nature like my own puts aside with a laugh.  And at first I had no reason to think myself deceived, when, some months ago, I heard that he was getting into debt, losing at play, paying court to female vampires, who drain the life-blood of those on whom they fasten their fatal lips.  Oh, then I spoke to him earnestly!\"  \"And in vain?\"  \"In vain.  A certain Chevalier de Finisterre, whom you may have heard of--\"  \"Certainly, and met; a friend of Louvier's--\"  \"The same man--has obtained over him an influence which so far subdues mine, that he almost challenged me when I told him his friend was a scamp.  In fine, though Alain and I have not actually quarrelled, we pass each other with, '_Bon jour, mon ami._'\"  \"Hum!  My dear Enguerrand, you have done all you could.  Flies will be flies, and spiders, spiders, till the earth is destroyed by a comet. Nay, I met a distinguished naturalist in America who maintained that we shall find flies and spiders in the next world.\"  \"You have been in America?  Ah, true--I remember, California!\"  \"Where have I not been?  Tush! music--shall I hear our fair hostess sing?\"  \"I am afraid not to-night: because Madame S---------- is to favour us, and the Signorina makes it a rule not to sing at her own house when professional artists do.  You must hear the Cicogna quietly some day; such a voice, nothing like it.\"  Madame S---------, who, since she had learned that there was no cause to apprehend that Isaura might become her professional rival, conceived for her a wonderful affection, and willingly contributed her magnificent gifts of song to the charms of Isaura's salon, now began a fragment from _I Puritani_, which held the audience as silent as the ghosts listening to Sappho, and when it was over, several of the guests slipped away, especially those who disliked music, and feared Madame S--------- might begin again.  Enguerrand was not one of such soulless recreants, but he had many other places to go to.  Besides, Madame S-------- was no novelty to him.  De Mauleon now approached Isaura, who was seated next to Valerie, and after well-merited encomium on Madame S------'s performance, slid into some critical comparisons between that singer and those of a former generation, which interested Isaura, and evinced to her quick perceptions that kind of love for music which has been refined by more knowledge of the art than is common to mere amateurs.  \"You have studied music, Monsieur de Mauleon,\" she said.  \"Do you not perform yourself?\"  \"I?  No.  But music has always had a fatal attraction for me.  I ascribe half the errors of my life to that temperament which makes me too fascinated by harmonies--too revolted by discords.\"  \"I should have thought such a temperament would have led from errors--are not errors discords?\"  \"To the inner sense, yes; but to the outer sense not always.  Virtues are often harsh to the ear--errors very sweet-voiced.  The sirens did not sing out of tune.  Better to stop one's ears than glide on Scylla or be merged into Charybdis.\"  \"Monsieur,\" cried Valerie, with a pretty _brusquerie_ which became her well, \"you talk like a Vandal.\"  \"It is, I think, by Mademoiselle Duplessis that I have the honour to be rebuked.  Is Monsieur your father very susceptible to music?\"  \"Well, I cannot say that he cares much for it.  But then his mind is so practical--\"  \"And his life so successful.  No Scylla, no Charybdis for him.  However, Mademoiselle, I am not quite the Vandal you suppose, I do not say that susceptibility to the influence of music may not be safe, nay, healthful, to others it was not so to me in my youth.  It can do me no harm now.\"  Here Duplessis came up and whispered his daughter \"it was time to leave; they had promised the Duchesse de Tarascon to assist at the soiree she gave that night.\"  Valerie took her father's arm with a brightening smile and a heightened colour.  Alain de Rochebriant might probably be at the Duchesse's.  \"Are you not going also to the Hotel de Tarascon, M. de Mauleon?\" asked Duplessis.  \"No; I was never there but once.  The Duchesse is an Imperialist, at once devoted and acute, and no doubt very soon divined my lack of faith in her idols.\"  Duplessis frowned, and hastily led Valerie away.  In a few minutes the room was comparatively deserted.  De Mauleon, however, lingered by the side of Isaura till all the other guests were gone.  Even then he lingered still, and renewed the interrupted conversation with her, the Venosta joining therein; and so agreeable did he make himself to her Italian tastes by a sort of bitter-sweet wisdom like that of her native proverbs--comprising much knowledge of mankind on the unflattering side of humanity in that form of pleasantry which has a latent sentiment of pathos--that the Venosta exclaimed, \"Surely you must have been brought up in Florence!\"  There was that in De Mauleon's talk hostile to all which we call romance that excited the imagination of Isaura, and compelled her instinctive love for whatever is more sweet, more beautiful, more ennobling on the many sides of human life, to oppose what she deemed the paradoxes of a man who had taught himself to belie even his own nature.  She became eloquent, and her countenance, which in ordinary moments owed much of its beauty to an expression of meditative gentleness, was now lighted up by the energy of earnest conviction--the enthusiasm of an impassioned zeal.  Gradually De Mauleon relaxed his share in the dialogue, and listened to her, rapt and dreamily as in his fiery youth he had listened to the songs of the sirens.  No siren Isaura!  She was defending her own cause, though"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7743"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 07 (#8)"],["body","y--defending the vocation of art as the embellisher of external nature, and more than embellisher of the nature which dwells crude, but plastic in the soul of man: indeed therein the creator of a new nature, strengthened, expanded, and brightened in proportion as it accumulates the ideas that tend beyond the boundaries of the visible and material nature, which is finite; for ever seeking in the unseen and the spiritual the goals in the infinite which it is their instinct to divine. \"That which you contemptuously call romance,\" said Isaura, \"is not essential only to poets and artists.  The most real side of every life, from the earliest dawn of mind in the infant, is the romantic.\"  \"When the child is weaving flower-chains, chasing butterflies, or sitting apart and dreaming what it will do in the future, is not that the child's real life, and yet is it not also the romantic?\"  \"But there comes a time when we weave no flower-chains, and chase no butterflies.\"  \"Is it so?--still on one side of life, flowers and butterflies may be found to the last; and at least to the last are there no dreams of the future?  Have you no such dreams at this moment? and without the romance of such dreams, would there be any reality to human life which could distinguish it from the life of the weed that rots on Lethe?\"  \"Alas, Mademoiselle,\" said De Mauleon, rising to take leave, \"your argument must rest without answer.  I would not, if I could, confute the beautiful belief that belongs to youth, fusing into one rainbow all the tints that can colour the world.  But the Signora Venosta will acknowledge the truth of an old saying expressed in every civilised language, but best, perhaps in that of the Florentine--'You might as well physic the dead as instruct the old.'\"  \"But you are not old!\" said the Venosta, with Florentine politeness,--\" you! not a grey hair.\"  \"'Tis not by the grey of the hair that one knows the age of the heart,\" answered De Mauleon, in another paraphrase of Italian proverb, and he was gone.  As he walked homeward, through deserted streets, Victor de Mauleon thought to himself, \"Poor girl, how I pity her! married to a Gustave Rameau--married to any man--nothing in the nature of man, be he the best and the cleverest, can ever realise the dream of a girl who is pure and has genius.  Ah, is not the converse true?  What girl, the best and the cleverest, comes up to the ideal of even a commonplace man--if he ever dreamed of an ideal!\"  Then he paused, and in a moment or so afterwards his thought knew such questionings no more.  It turned upon personalities, on stratagems and plots, on ambition.  The man had more than his share of that peculiar susceptibility which is one of the characteristics of his countrymen-- susceptibility to immediate impulse--susceptibility to fleeting impressions.  It was a key to many mysteries in his character when he owned his subjection to the influence of music, and in music recognised not the seraph's harp, but the siren's song.  If you could have permanently fixed Victor de Mauleon in one of the good moments of his life--even now--some moment of exquisite kindness--of superb generosity --of dauntless courage--you would have secured a very rare specimen of noble humanity.  But so to fix him was impossible.  That impulse of the moment vanished the moment after; swept aside by the force of his very talents--talents concentrated by his intense sense of individuality--sense of wrongs or of rights--interests or objects personal to himself.  He extended the royal saying, \"_L'etat, c'est moi_,\" to words far more grandiloquent.  \"The universe, 'tis I.\"  The Venosta would have understood him and smiled approvingly, if he had said with good-humoured laugh, \"I dead, the world is dead!\"  That is an Italian proverb, and means much the same thing."]]]
