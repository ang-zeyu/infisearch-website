[Exeunt CARDINALS of France and Padua.]       POPE. Lord Raymond.           [They converse in dumb show.]       FAUSTUS. Go, haste thee, gentle Mephistophilis,      Follow the cardinals to the consistory;      And, as they turn their superstitious books,      Strike them with sloth and drowsy idleness,      And make them sleep so sound, that in their shapes      Thyself and I may parley with this [120] Pope,      This proud confronter of the Emperor;      And, in despite of all his holiness,      Restore this Bruno to his liberty,      And bear him to the states of Germany.       MEPHIST. Faustus, I go.       FAUSTUS. Despatch it soon:      The Pope shall curse, that Faustus came to Rome.           [Exeunt FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.]       BRUNO. Pope Adrian, let me have right [121] of law:      I was elected by the Emperor.       POPE. We will depose the Emperor for that deed,      And curse the people that submit to him:      Both he and thou shall [122] stand excommunicate,      And interdict from church's privilege      And all society of holy men.      He grows too proud in his authority,      Lifting his lofty head above the clouds,      And, like a steeple, overpeers the church:      But we'll pull down his haughty insolence;      And, as Pope Alexander, our progenitor,      Trod on the neck of German Frederick,      Adding this golden sentence to our praise,      \"That Peter's heirs should tread on Emperors,      And walk upon the dreadful adder's back,      Treading the lion and the dragon down,      And fearless spurn the killing basilisk,\"      So will we quell that haughty schismatic,      And, by authority apostolical,      Depose him from his regal government.       BRUNO. Pope Julius swore to princely Sigismond,      For him and the succeeding Popes of Rome,      To hold the Emperors their lawful lords.       POPE. Pope Julius did abuse the church's rights,      And therefore none of his decrees can stand.      Is not all power on earth bestow'd on us?      And therefore, though we would, we cannot err.      Behold this silver belt, whereto is fix'd      Seven golden seals, fast sealed with seven seals,      In token of our seven-fold power from heaven,      To bind or loose, lock fast, condemn or judge,      Resign or seal, or what so pleaseth us:      Then he and thou, and all the world, shall stoop,      Or be assured of our dreadful curse,      To light as heavy as the pains of hell.            Re-enter FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS, in the shapes of the           CARDINALS of France and Padua.       MEPHIST. Now tell me, Faustus, are we not fitted well?       FAUSTUS. Yes, Mephistophilis; and two such cardinals      Ne'er serv'd a holy Pope as we shall do.      But, whilst they sleep within the consistory,      Let us salute his reverend fatherhood.       RAYMOND. Behold, my lord, the Cardinals are return'd.       POPE. Welcome, grave fathers: answer presently      What hath [123] our holy council there decreed      Concerning Bruno and the Emperor,      In quittance of their late conspiracy      Against our state and papal dignity?       FAUSTUS. Most sacred patron of the church of Rome,      By full consent of all the synod [124]      Of priests and prelates, it is thus decreed,--      That Bruno and the German Emperor      Be held as Lollards and bold schismatics,      And proud disturbers of the church's peace;      And if that Bruno, by his own assent,      Without enforcement of the German peers,      Did seek to wear the triple diadem,      And by your death to climb Saint Peter's chair,      The statutes decretal have thus decreed,--      He shall be straight condemn'd of heresy,      And on a pile of faggots burnt to death.       POPE. It is enough.  Here, take him to your charge,      And bear him straight to Ponte [125] Angelo,      And in the strongest tower enclose him fast.      To-morrow, sitting in our consistory,      With all our college of grave cardinals,      We will determine of his life or death.      Here, take his [126] triple crown along with you,      And leave it in the church's treasury.      Make haste again, my good Lord Cardinals,      And take our blessing apostolical.       MEPHIST. So, so; was never devil thus bless'd before.       FAUSTUS. Away, sweet Mephistophilis, be gone;      The Cardinals will be plagu'd for this anon.           [Exeunt FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS with BRUNO.]       POPE. Go presently and bring a banquet forth,      That we may solemnize Saint Peter's feast,      And with Lord Raymond, King of Hungary,      Drink to our late and happy victory.            A Sennet [127] while the banquet is brought in; and then enter           FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS in their own shapes.       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, come, prepare thyself for mirth:      The sleepy Cardinals are hard at hand,      To censure Bruno, that is posted hence,      And on a proud-pac'd steed, as swift as thought,      Flies o'er the Alps to fruitful Germany,      There to salute the woful Emperor.       FAUSTUS. The Pope will curse them for their sloth to-day,      That slept both Bruno and his crown away.      But now, that Faustus may delight his mind,      And by their folly make some merriment,      Sweet Mephistophilis, so charm me here,      That I may walk invisible to all,      And do whate'er I please, unseen of any.       MEPHIST. Faustus, thou shalt:  then kneel down presently,      Whilst on thy head I lay my hand,      And charm thee with this magic wand.      First, wear this girdle; then appear      Invisible to all are here:      The planets seven, the gloomy air,      Hell, and the Furies' forked hair,      Pluto's blue fire, and Hecat's tree,      With magic spells so compass thee,      That no eye may thy body see!      So, Faustus, now, for all their holiness,      Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not be discern'd.       FAUSTUS. Thanks, Mephistophilis.--Now, friars, take heed,      Lest Faustus make your shaven crowns to bleed.       MEPHIST. Faustus, no more:  see, where the Cardinals come!            Re-enter the CARDINALS of France and Padua with a book.       POPE. Welcome, Lord Cardinals; come, sit down.--      Lord Raymond, take your seat.--Friars, attend,      And see that all things be [128] in readiness,      As best beseems this solemn festival.       CARDINAL OF FRANCE. First, may it please your sacred Holiness      To view the sentence of the reverend synod      Concerning Bruno and the Emperor?       POPE. What needs this question? did I not tell you,      To-morrow we would sit i' the consistory,      And there determine of his punishment?      You brought us word even now, it was decreed      That Bruno and the cursed Emperor      Were by the holy council both condemn'd      For loathed Lollards and base schismatics:      Then wherefore would you have me view that book?       CARDINAL OF FRANCE. Your grace mistakes; you gave us no such charge.       RAYMOND. Deny it not; we all are witnesses      That Bruno here was late deliver'd you,      With his rich triple crown to be reserv'd      And put into the church's treasury.       BOTH CARDINALS. By holy Paul, we saw them not!       POPE. By Peter, you shall die,      Unless you bring them forth immediately!--      Hale them to [129] prison, lade their limbs with gyves.--      False prelates, for this hateful treachery      Curs'd be your souls to hellish misery!           [Exeunt ATTENDANTS with the two CARDINALS.]       FAUSTUS. So, they are safe.  Now, Faustus, to the feast:      The Pope had never such a frolic guest.       POPE. Lord Archbishop of Rheims, sit down with us.       ARCHBISHOP. [130] I thank your Holiness.       FAUSTUS. Fall to; the devil choke you, [131] an you spare!       POPE. Who is that spoke?--Friars, look about.--      Lord Raymond, pray, fall to. I am beholding [132]      To the Bishop of Milan for this so rare a present.       FAUSTUS. I thank you, sir.           [Snatches the dish.]       POPE. How now! who snatch'd the meat from me?      Villains, why speak you not?--      My good Lord Archbishop, here's a most dainty dish      Was sent me from a cardinal in France.       FAUSTUS. I'll have that too.           [Snatches the dish.]       POPE. What Lollards do attend our holiness,      That we receive such [133] great indignity?      Fetch me some wine.       FAUSTUS. Ay, pray, do, for Faustus is a-dry.       POPE. Lord Raymond,      I drink unto your grace.       FAUSTUS. I pledge your grace.           [Snatches the cup.]       POPE. My wine gone too!--Ye lubbers, look about,      And find the man that doth this villany,      Or, by our sanctitude, you all shall die!--      I pray, my lords, have patience at this      Troublesome banquet.       ARCHBISHOP. Please it [134] your Holiness, I think it be some ghost      crept out of Purgatory, and now is come unto your Holiness for his      pardon.       POPE. It may be so.--      Go, then, command our priests to sing a dirge,      To lay the fury of this same troublesome ghost.           [Exit an ATTENDANT.--The POPE crosses himself.]       FAUSTUS. How now! must every bit be spic'd with a cross?--      Nay, then, take that.           [Strikes the POPE.]       POPE. O, I am slain!--Help me, my lords!      O, come and help to bear my body hence!--      Damn'd be his [135] soul for ever for this deed!           [Exeunt all except FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS.]       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what will you do now? for I can tell you      you'll be cursed with bell, book, and candle.       FAUSTUS. Bell, book, and candle,--candle, book, and bell,--      Forward and backward, to curse Faustus to hell!            Re-enter the FRIARS, with bell, book, and candle, for the           Dirge.       FIRST FRIAR. Come, brethren, lets about our business with good      devotion.           [They sing.]       CURSED BE HE THAT STOLE HIS HOLINESS' MEAT FROM THE TABLE!      maledicat Dominus!

Sirrah Robin, we were best look that your devil can answer      the stealing of this same [138] cup, for the Vintner's boy follows      us at the hard heels. [139]       ROBIN. 'Tis no matter; let him come:  an he follow us, I'll so      conjure him as he was never conjured in his life, I warrant him.      Let me see the cup.       DICK. Here 'tis.           [Gives the cup to ROBIN.]      Yonder he comes:  now, Robin, now or never shew thy cunning.            Enter VINTNER. [140]       VINTNER. O, are you here?  I am glad I have found you.  You are      a couple of fine companions:  pray, where's the cup you stole      from the tavern?       ROBIN. How, how! we steal a cup! take heed what you say:  we look      not like cup-stealers, I can tell you.       VINTNER. Never deny't, for I know you have it; and I'll search you.       ROBIN. Search me! ay, and spare not.      --Hold the cup, Dick [Aside to DICK, giving him the cup].--      Come, come, search me, search me.            [VINTNER searches him.]       VINTNER. Come on, sirrah, let me search you now.       DICK. Ay, ay, do, do.      --Hold the cup, Robin [Aside to ROBIN, giving him the cup].--      I fear not your searching: we scorn to steal your [141] cups,      I can tell you.            [VINTNER searches him.]       VINTNER. Never out-face me for the matter; for, sure, the cup      is between you two.       ROBIN. Nay, there you lie; 'tis beyond us both.       VINTNER. A plague take you! I thought 'twas your knavery to take      it away:  come, give it me again.       ROBIN. Ay, much! [142] when, can you tell?--Dick, make me a circle,      and stand close at my back, and stir not for thy life.--Vintner,      you shall have your cup anon.--Say nothing, Dick.--[Reads from      a book] O per se, O; Demogorgon; Belcher, and Mephistophilis!            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       MEPHIST. You princely legions of infernal rule,      How am I vexed by these villains' charms!      From Constantinople have they brought me now,      Only for pleasure of these damned slaves.           [Exit VINTNER.]       ROBIN. By lady, [143] sir, you have had a shrewd journey of it!      will it please you to [144] take a shoulder of mutton to supper,      and a tester [145] in your purse, and go back again?       DICK. Ay, I pray you heartily, sir; for we called you but in jest,      I promise you.       MEPHIST. To purge the rashness of this cursed deed,      First, be thou turned to this ugly shape,      For apish deeds transformed to an ape.       ROBIN. O, brave! an ape!  I pray, sir, let me have the carrying      of him about, to shew some tricks.       MEPHIST. And so thou shalt:  be thou transformed to a dog, and      carry him upon thy back.  Away! be gone!       ROBIN. A dog! that's excellent:  let the maids look well to their      porridge-pots, for I'll into the kitchen presently.--Come, Dick,      come.           [Exeunt ROBIN and DICK.]       MEPHIST. Now with the flames of ever-burning fire      I'll wing myself, and forthwith fly amain(sic)      Unto my Faustus, to the Great Turk's court.           [Exit.]            Enter MARTINO and FREDERICK at several doors.       MARTINO. What, ho, officers, gentlemen!      Hie to the presence to attend the Emperor.--      Good Frederick, see the rooms be voided straight:      His majesty is coming to the hall;      Go back, and see the state [146] in readiness.       FREDERICK. But where is Bruno, our elected Pope,      That on a Fury's back came post from Rome?      Will not his grace consort the Emperor?       MARTINO. O, yes; and with him comes the German conjurer,      The learned Faustus, fame of Wittenberg,      The wonder of the world for magic art;      And he intends to shew great Carolus      The race of all his stout progenitors,      And bring in presence of his majesty      The royal shapes and perfect [147] semblances      Of Alexander and his beauteous paramour.       FREDERICK. Where is Benvolio?       MARTINO. Fast asleep, I warrant you;      He took his rouse [148] with stoops of Rhenish wine      So kindly yesternight to Bruno's health,      That all this day the sluggard keeps his bed.       FREDERICK. See, see, his window's ope! we'll call to him.       MARTINO. What, ho! Benvolio!            Enter BENVOLIO above, at a window, in his nightcap, buttoning.       BENVOLIO. What a devil ail you two?       MARTINO. Speak softly, sir, lest the devil hear you;      For Faustus at the court is late arriv'd,      And at his heels a [149] thousand Furies wait,      To accomplish whatsoe'er the doctor please.       BENVOLIO. What of this?       MARTINO. Come, leave thy chamber first, and thou shalt see      This conjurer perform such rare exploits,      Before the Pope and royal Emperor,      As never yet was seen in Germany.       BENVOLIO. Has not the Pope enough of conjuring yet?      He was upon the devil's back late enough:      An if he be so far in love with him,      I would he would post with him to Rome again!       FREDERICK. Speak, wilt thou come and see this sport?       BENVOLIO. Not I.       MARTINO. Wilt thou stand in thy window, and see it, then?       BENVOLIO. Ay, an I fall not asleep i' the mean time.       MARTINO. The Emperor is at hand, who comes to see      What wonders by black spells may compass'd be.       BENVOLIO. Well, go you attend the Emperor.  I am content, for      this once, to thrust my head out at a [150] window; for they      say, if a man be drunk over night, the devil cannot hurt him      in the morning:  if that be true, I have a charm in my head,      shall control him as well as the conjurer, I warrant you.           [Exeunt FREDERICK and MARTINO.]            A Sennet.  Enter CHARLES the German Emperor, BRUNO,           DUKE OF SAXONY, FAUSTUS, MEPHISTOPHILIS, FREDERICK,           MARTINO, and Attendants.       EMPEROR. Wonder of men, renowm'd [151] magician,      Thrice-learned Faustus, welcome to our court.      This deed of thine, in setting Bruno free      From his and our professed enemy,      Shall add more excellence unto thine art      Than if by powerful necromantic spells      Thou couldst command the world's obedience:      For ever be belov'd of Carolus!      And if this Bruno, thou hast late redeem'd,      In peace possess the triple diadem,      And sit in Peter's chair, despite of chance,      Thou shalt be famous through [152] all Italy,      And honour'd of the German Emperor.       FAUSTUS. These [153] gracious words, most royal Carolus,      Shall make poor Faustus, to his utmost power,      Both love and serve the German Emperor,      And lay his life at holy Bruno's feet:      For proof whereof, if so your grace be pleas'd,      The doctor stands prepar'd by power of art      To cast his magic charms, that shall pierce through [154]      The ebon gates of ever-burning hell,      And hale the stubborn Furies from their caves,      To compass whatsoe'er your grace commands.       BENVOLIO. Blood, he speaks terribly! but, for all that, I do not      greatly believe him:  he looks as like a [155] conjurer as the Pope      to a costermonger. [Aside.]       EMPEROR. Then, Faustus, as thou late didst promise us,      We would behold that famous conqueror,      Great Alexander, and his paramour,      In their true shapes and state majestical,      That we may wonder at their excellence.       FAUSTUS. Your majesty shall see them presently.--      Mephistophilis, away,      And, with a solemn noise of trumpets' sound,      Present before this [156] royal Emperor      Great Alexander and his beauteous paramour.       MEPHIST. Faustus, I will.           [Exit.]       BENVOLIO. Well, Master Doctor, an your devils come not away      quickly, you shall have me asleep presently:  zounds, I could      eat myself for anger, to think I have been such an ass all this      while, to stand gaping after the devil's governor, and can see      nothing!       FAUSTUS.      I'll make you feel something anon, if my art fail me not.--      My lord, I must forewarn your majesty,      That, when my spirits present the royal shapes      Of Alexander and his paramour,      Your grace demand [157] no questions of the king,      But in dumb silence let them come and go.       EMPEROR. Be it as Faustus please; we are content.       BENVOLIO. Ay, ay, and I am content too:  an thou bring Alexander      and his paramour before the Emperor, I'll be Actaeon, and turn      myself to a stag.       FAUSTUS. And I'll play Diana, and send you the horns presently.            Sennet.  Enter, at one door, [158] the EMPEROR ALEXANDER, at           the other, DARIUS.  They meet.  DARIUS is thrown down;           ALEXANDER kills him, takes off his crown, and, offering to           go out, his PARAMOUR meets him.  He embraceth her, and sets           DARIUS' crown upon her head; and, coming back, both salute           the EMPEROR, who, leaving his state, [159] offers to embrace           them; which FAUSTUS seeing, suddenly stays him.  Then trumpets           cease, and music sounds.       My gracious lord, you do forget yourself;      These [160] are but shadows, not substantial.       EMPEROR. O, pardon me! my thoughts are so ravish'd      With sight of this renowmed [161] emperor,      That in mine arms I would have compass'd him.      But, Faustus, since I may not speak to them,      To satisfy my longing thoughts [162] at full,      Let me this tell thee:  I have heard it said      That this fair"]]]
