FAUSTUS. Your majesty may boldly go and see.       EMPEROR. Faustus, I see it plain;      And in this sight thou better pleasest me      Than if I gain'd [164] another monarchy.       FAUSTUS. Away! be gone! [Exit show.]--See, see, my gracious      lord! what strange beast is yon, that thrusts his head out at      window? [165]       EMPEROR. O, wondrous sight!--See, Duke of Saxony,      Two spreading horns most strangely fastened      Upon the head of young Benvolio!       SAXONY. What, is he asleep or dead?       FAUSTUS. He sleeps, my lord; but dreams not of his horns.       EMPEROR. This sport is excellent:  we'll call and wake him.--      What, ho, Benvolio!       BENVOLIO. A plague upon you! let me sleep a while.       EMPEROR. I blame thee not to sleep much, having such a head of      thine own.       SAXONY. Look up, Benvolio; 'tis the Emperor calls.       BENVOLIO. The Emperor! where?--O, zounds, my head!       EMPEROR. Nay, an thy horns hold, 'tis no matter for thy head,      for that's armed sufficiently.       FAUSTUS. Why, how now, Sir Knight! what, hanged by the horns!      this is [166] most horrible:  fie, fie, pull in your head, for      shame! let not all the world wonder at you.       BENVOLIO. Zounds, doctor, this is [167] your villany!       FAUSTUS. O, say not so, sir! the doctor has no skill,      No art, no cunning, to present these lords,      Or bring before this royal Emperor      The mighty monarch, warlike Alexander.      If Faustus do it, you are straight resolv'd,      In bold Actaeon's shape, to turn a stag:--      And therefore, my lord, so please your majesty,      I'll raise a kennel of hounds shall hunt him so      As [168] all his footmanship shall scarce prevail      To keep his carcass from their bloody fangs.--      Ho, Belimoth, Argiron, Asteroth! [169]       BENVOLIO. Hold, hold!--Zounds, he'll raise up a kennel of devils,      I think, anon.--Good my lord, entreat for me.--'Sblood, I am never      able to endure these torments.       EMPEROR. Then, good Master Doctor,      Let me entreat you to remove his horns;      He has [170] done penance now sufficiently.       FAUSTUS. My gracious lord, not so much for injury done to me,      as to delight your majesty with some mirth, hath Faustus justly      requited this injurious knight; which being all I desire, I am      content to remove his horns. [171]--Mephistophilis, transform him      [MEPHISTOPHILIS removes the horns]:--and hereafter, sir, [172]      look you speak well of scholars.       BENVOLIO. Speak well of ye! 'sblood, an scholars be such      cuckold-makers, to clap horns of [173] honest men's heads o' this      order, I'll ne'er trust smooth faces and small ruffs more.--But,      an I be not revenged for this, would I might be turned to a      gaping oyster, and drink nothing but salt water!           [Aside, and then exit above.]       EMPEROR. Come, Faustus:  while the Emperor lives,      In recompense of this thy high desert,      Thou shalt command the state of Germany,      And live belov'd of mighty Carolus.           [Exeunt.]       Enter BENVOLIO, MARTINO, FREDERICK, and SOLDIERS.       MARTINO. Nay, sweet Benvolio, let us sway [174] thy thoughts      From this attempt against the conjurer. [175]       BENVOLIO. Away! you love me not, to urge me thus:      Shall I let slip so great an injury,      When every servile groom jests at my wrongs,      And in their rustic gambols proudly say,      \"Benvolio's head was grac'd with horns today?\"      O, may these eyelids never close again,      Till with my sword I have that [176] conjurer slain!      If you will aid me in this enterprise,      Then draw your weapons and be resolute;      If not, depart:  here will Benvolio die,      But Faustus' death shall quit my [177] infamy.       FREDERICK. Nay, we will stay with thee, betide what may,      And kill that [178] doctor, if he come this way.       BENVOLIO. Then, gentle Frederick, hie thee to the grove,      And place our servants and our followers      Close in an [179] ambush there behind the trees.      By this, I know the conjurer is near:      I saw him kneel, and kiss the Emperor's hand,      And take his leave, laden with rich rewards.      Then, soldiers, boldly [180] fight:  if Faustus die,      Take you the wealth, leave us the victory.       FREDERICK. Come, soldiers, follow me unto the grove:      Who kills him shall have gold and endless love.           [Exit FREDERICK with SOLDIERS.]       BENVOLIO. My head is lighter, than it was, by the horns;      But yet my heart's [181] more ponderous than my head,      And pants until I see that [182] conjurer dead.       MARTINO. Where shall we place ourselves, Benvolio?       BENVOLIO. Here will we stay to bide the first assault:      O, were that damned hell-hound but in place,      Thou soon shouldst see me quit my foul disgrace!            Re-enter FREDERICK.       FREDERICK. Close, close! the conjurer is at hand,      And all alone comes walking in his gown;      Be ready, then, and strike the [183] peasant down.       BENVOLIO. Mine be that honour, then.  Now, sword, strike home!      For horns he gave I'll have his head anon.       MARTINO. See, see, he comes!            Enter FAUSTUS with a false head.       BENVOLIO. No words.  This blow ends all:      Hell take his soul! his body thus must fall.           [Stabs FAUSTUS.]       FAUSTUS. [falling.] O!       FREDERICK. Groan you, Master Doctor?       BENVOLIO. Break may his heart with groans!--Dear Frederick, see,      Thus will I end his griefs immediately.       MARTINO. Strike with a willing hand.           [BENVOLIO strikes off FAUSTUS' head.]                                            His head is off.       BENVOLIO. The devil's dead; the Furies now [184] may laugh.       FREDERICK. Was this that stern aspect, that awful frown,      Made the grim monarch of infernal spirits      Tremble and quake at his commanding charms?       MARTINO. Was this that damned head, whose art [185] conspir'd      Benvolio's shame before the Emperor?       BENVOLIO. Ay, that's the head, and there [186] the body lies,      Justly rewarded for his villanies.       FREDERICK. Come, let's devise how we may add more shame      To the black scandal of his hated name.       BENVOLIO. First, on his head, in quittance of my wrongs,      I'll nail huge forked horns, and let them hang      Within the window where he yok'd me first,      That all the world may see my just revenge.       MARTINO. What use shall we put his beard to?       BENVOLIO. We'll sell it to a chimney-sweeper:  it will wear out      ten birchen brooms, I warrant you.       FREDERICK. What shall his [187] eyes do?       BENVOLIO. We'll pull [188] out his eyes; and they shall serve for      buttons to his lips, to keep his tongue from catching cold.       MARTINO. An excellent policy! and now, sirs, having divided him,      what shall the body do?           [FAUSTUS rises.]       BENVOLIO. Zounds, the devil's alive again!       FREDERICK. Give him his head, for God's sake.       FAUSTUS. Nay, keep it:  Faustus will have heads and hands,      Ay, all [189] your hearts to recompense this deed.      Knew you not, traitors, I was limited      For four-and-twenty years to breathe on earth?      And, had you cut my body with your swords,      Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand,      Yet in a minute had my spirit return'd,      And I had breath'd a man, made free from harm.      But wherefore do I dally my revenge?--      Asteroth, Belimoth, Mephistophilis?            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS, and other Devils.       Go, horse these traitors on your fiery backs,      And mount aloft with them as high as heaven:      Thence pitch them headlong to the lowest hell.      Yet, stay: the world shall see their misery,      And hell shall after plague their treachery.      Go, Belimoth, and take this caitiff hence,      And hurl him in some lake of mud and dirt.      Take thou this other, drag him through [190] the woods      Amongst [191] the pricking thorns and sharpest briers;      Whilst, with my gentle Mephistophilis,      This traitor flies unto some steepy rock,      That, rolling down, may break the villain's bones,      As he intended to dismember me.      Fly hence; despatch my charge immediately.       FREDERICK. Pity us, gentle Faustus! save our lives!       FAUSTUS. Away!       FREDERICK. He must needs go that the devil drives.           [Exeunt MEPHISTOPHILIS and DEVILS with BENVOLIO, MARTINO,           and FREDERICK.]            Enter the ambushed SOLDIERS. [192]       FIRST SOLDIER. Come, sirs, prepare yourselves in readiness;      Make haste to help these noble gentlemen:      I heard them parley with the conjurer.       SECOND SOLDIER. See, where he comes! despatch and kill the slave.       FAUSTUS. What's here? an ambush to betray my life!      Then, Faustus, try thy skill.--Base peasants, stand!      For, lo, these [193] trees remove at my command,      And stand as bulwarks 'twixt yourselves and me,      To shield me from your hated treachery!      Yet, to encounter this your weak attempt,      Behold, an army comes incontinent!            FAUSTUS strikes the door, [194] and enter a DEVIL playing           on a drum; after him another, bearing an ensign; and divers           with weapons; MEPHISTOPHILIS with fire-works.  They set upon           the SOLDIERS, drive them out, and exeunt.            Enter, at several doors, BENVOLIO, FREDERICK, and MARTINO,           their heads and faces bloody, and besmeared with mud and           dirt; all having horns on their heads.       MARTINO. What, ho, Benvolio!       BENVOLIO. Here.--What, Frederick, ho!       FREDERICK. O, help me, gentle friend!--Where is Martino?       MARTINO. Dear Frederick, here,      Half smother'd in a lake of mud and dirt,      Through which "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/811"],["title","The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#8)"],["body","Furies dragg'd me by the heels.       FREDERICK. Martino, see, Benvolio's horns again!       MARTINO. O, misery!--How now, Benvolio!       BENVOLIO. Defend me, heaven! shall I be haunted still?       MARTINO. Nay, fear not, man; we have no power to kill.       BENVOLIO. My friends transformed thus!  O, hellish spite!      Your heads are all set with horns.       FREDERICK. You hit it right;      It is your own you mean; feel on your head.       BENVOLIO. Zounds, [195] horns again!       MARTINO. Nay, chafe not, man; we all are [196] sped.       BENVOLIO. What devil attends this damn'd magician,      That, spite of spite, our wrongs are doubled?       FREDERICK. What may we do, that we may hide our shames?       BENVOLIO. If we should follow him to work revenge,      He'd join long asses' ears to these huge horns,      And make us laughing-stocks to all the world.       MARTINO. What shall we, then, do, dear Benvolio?       BENVOLIO. I have a castle joining near these woods;      And thither we'll repair, and live obscure,      Till time shall alter these [197] our brutish shapes:      Sith black disgrace hath thus eclips'd our fame,      We'll rather die with grief than live with shame.           [Exeunt.]            Enter FAUSTUS, a HORSE-COURSER, and MEPHISTOPHILIS.       HORSE-COURSER. I beseech your worship, accept of these forty dollars.       FAUSTUS. Friend, thou canst not buy so good a horse for so small      a price. I have no great need to sell him:  but, if thou likest      him for ten dollars more, take him, because I see thou hast a      good mind to him.       HORSE-COURSER. I beseech you, sir, accept of this:  I am a very      poor man, and have lost very much of late by horse-flesh, and      this bargain will set me up again.       FAUSTUS. Well, I will not stand with thee:  give me the money      [HORSE-COURSER gives FAUSTUS the money].  Now, sirrah, I must      tell you that you may ride him o'er hedge and ditch, and spare      him not; but, do you hear? in any case, ride him not into the      water.       HORSE-COURSER. How, sir! not into the water! why, will he not      drink of all waters?       FAUSTUS. Yes, he will drink of all waters; but ride him not into      the water: o'er hedge and ditch, or where thou wilt, but not into      the water.  Go, bid the hostler deliver him unto you, and remember      what I say.       HORSE-COURSER. I warrant you, sir!--O, joyful day! now am I a      made man for ever.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. What art thou, Faustus, but a man condemn'd to die?      Thy fatal time draws to a final end;      Despair doth drive distrust into my thoughts:      Confound these passions with a quiet sleep:      Tush, Christ did call the thief upon the Cross;      Then rest thee, Faustus, quiet in conceit.           [He sits to sleep.]            Re-enter the HORSE-COURSER, wet.       HORSE-COURSER. 0, what a cozening doctor was this!  I, riding      my horse into the water, thinking some hidden mystery had been      in the horse, I had nothing under me but a little straw, and had      much ado to escape [198] drowning.  Well, I'll go rouse him, and      make him give me my forty dollars again.--Ho, sirrah Doctor, you      cozening scab!  Master Doctor, awake, and rise, and give me my      money again, for your horse is turned to a bottle of hay, Master      Doctor! [He pulls off FAUSTUS' leg].  Alas, I am undone! what      shall I do? I have pulled off his leg.       FAUSTUS. O, help, help! the villain hath murdered me.       HORSE-COURSER. Murder or not murder, now he has [199] but one leg,      I'll outrun him, and cast this leg into some ditch or other.           [Aside, and then runs out.]       FAUSTUS. Stop him, stop him, stop him!--Ha, ha, ha!  Faustus hath      his leg again, and the Horse-courser a bundle of hay for his      forty dollars.            Enter WAGNER.       How now, Wagner! what news with thee?       WAGNER. If it please you, the Duke of Vanholt doth earnestly      entreat your company, and hath sent some of his men to attend      you, [200] with provision fit for your journey.       FAUSTUS. The Duke of Vanholt's an honourable gentleman, and one      to whom I must be no niggard of my cunning.  Come, away!           [Exeunt.            Enter ROBIN, DICK, the HORSE-COURSER, and a CARTER.       CARTER. Come, my masters, I'll bring you to the best beer in      Europe.--What, ho, hostess! where be these whores?            Enter HOSTESS.       HOSTESS. How now! what lack you?  What, my old guess! [201] welcome.       ROBIN. Sirrah Dick, dost thou [202] know why I stand so mute?       DICK. No, Robin:  why is't?       ROBIN. I am eighteen-pence on the score. but say nothing; see      if she have forgotten me.       HOSTESS. Who's this that stands so solemnly by himself?  What,      my old guest!       ROBIN. O, hostess, how do you?  I hope my score stands still.       HOSTESS. Ay, there's no doubt of that; for methinks you make no      haste to wipe it out.       DICK. Why, hostess, I say, fetch us some beer.       HOSTESS. You shall presently.--Look up into the hall there, ho!           [Exit.--Drink is presently brought in.]       DICK. Come, sirs, what shall we do now [203] till mine hostess comes?       CARTER. Marry, sir, [204] I'll tell you the bravest tale how a      conjurer served me.  You know Doctor Faustus?       HORSE-COURSER. Ay, a plague take him! here's some on's have cause      to know him.  Did he conjure thee too?       CARTER. I'll tell you how he served me.  As I was going to      Wittenberg, t'other day, [205] with a load of hay, he met me, and      asked me what he should give me for as much hay as he could eat.      Now, sir, I thinking that a little would serve his turn, bad him      take as much as he would for three farthings:  so he presently      gave me my [206] money and fell to eating; and, as I am a cursen [207]      man, he never left eating till he had eat up all my load of hay.       ALL. O, monstrous! eat a whole load of hay!       ROBIN. Yes, yes, that may be; for I have heard of one that has eat      a load of logs.       HORSE-COURSER. Now, sirs, you shall hear how villanously he      served me.  I went to him yesterday to buy a horse of him, and      he would by no means sell him under forty dollars.  So, sir,      because I knew him to be such a horse as would run over hedge      and ditch and never tire, I gave him his money.  So, when I had      my horse, Doctor Faustus bad me ride him night and day, and spare      him no time; but, quoth he, in any case, ride him not into the      water.  Now, sir, I thinking the horse had had some quality [208]      that he would not have me know of, what did I but rid [209] him      into a great river? and when I came just in the midst, my horse      vanished away, and I sate straddling upon a bottle of hay.       ALL. O, brave doctor!       HORSE-COURSER. But you shall hear how bravely I served him for      it.  I went me home to his house, and there I found him asleep.      I kept a hallooing and whooping in his ears; but all could not      wake him.  I, seeing that, took him by the leg, and never rested      pulling till I had pulled me his leg quite off; and now 'tis at      home in mine hostry.       ROBIN. And has the doctor but one leg, then? that's excellent;      for one of his devils turned me into the likeness of an ape's face.       CARTER. Some more drink, hostess!       ROBIN. Hark you, we'll into another room and drink a while, and      then we'll go seek out the doctor.           [Exeunt.]            Enter the DUKE OF VANHOLT, his DUCHESS, FAUSTUS, MEPHISTOPHILIS,           and ATTENDANTS.       DUKE. Thanks, Master Doctor, for these pleasant sights; nor know      I how sufficiently to recompense your great deserts in erecting      that enchanted castle in the air, [210] the sight whereof so      delighted [211] me as nothing in the world could please me more.       FAUSTUS. I do think myself, my good lord, highly recompensed in      that it pleaseth [212] your grace to think but well of that which      Faustus hath performed.--But, gracious lady, it may be that you      have taken no pleasure in those sights; therefore, I pray you      tell me, what is the thing you most desire to have; be it in the      world, it shall be yours: I have heard that great-bellied women      do long for things are rare and dainty.       DUCHESS. True, Master Doctor; and, since I find you so kind,      I will make known unto you what my heart desires to have; and,      were it now summer, as it is January, a dead time of the winter,      I would request no better meat than a dish of ripe grapes.       FAUSTUS. This is but a small matter.--Go, Mephistophilis; away!           [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]      Madam, I will do more than this for your content.            Re-Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with grapes.       Here now, taste you these: they should be good, for they come [213]      from a far country, I can tell you.       DUKE. This makes me wonder more than all the rest, that at this      time of the year, when every tree is barren of his fruit, from      whence you had these ripe grapes. [214]       FAUSTUS. Please it your grace, the year is divided into two      circles over the whole world; so that, when it is winter with      us, in the contrary circle it is likewise summer with them, as      in India, Saba, and such countries that lie far east, where      they have fruit twice a-year; from whence, by means of a swift      spirit that I have, I had these grapes brought, as you see.       DUCHESS. And, trust me, they are the sweetest grapes that e'er      I tasted.            The CLOWNS bounce [215] at the gate, within.       DUKE. What rude disturbers have we at the gate?      Go, pacify their fury, set it ope,      And then demand of them what they would have.            [They knock again, and call out to talk with FAUSTUS.]       SERVANT. Why, how now, masters! what a "]]]
