[Fifteen hundred, according to the Croyland historian.]  Close and anxious was the consultation then held.  Each of the several detachments reported alike of the sullen indifference of the population, which each had sought to excite in favour of Edward. Light riders [Hall] were despatched in various directions, still further to sound the neighbourhood.  All returned ere noon, some bruised and maltreated by the stones and staves of the rustics, and not a voice had been heard to echo the cry, \"Long live King Edward!\" The profound sagacity of Gloucester's guileful counsel was then unanimously recognized.  Richard despatched a secret letter to Clarence; and it was resolved immediately to proceed to York, and to publish everywhere along the road that the fugitive had returned but to claim his private heritage, and remonstrate with the parliament which had awarded the duchy of York to Clarence, his younger brother.  \"Such a power,\" saith the Chronicle, \"hath justice ever among men, that all, moved by mercy or compassion, began either to favour or not to resist him.\"  And so, wearing the Lancastrian Prince of Wales's cognizance of the ostrich feather, crying out as they marched, \"Long live King Henry!\" the hardy liars, four days after their debarkation, arrived at the gates of York.  Here, not till after much delay and negotiation, Edward was admitted only as Duke of York, and upon condition that he would swear to be a faithful and loyal servant to King Henry; and at the gate by which he was to enter, Edward actually took that oath, \"a priest being by to say Mass in the Mass tyme, receiving the body of our blessed Saviour!\" [Hall.]  Edward tarried not long in York; be pushed forward.  Two great nobles guarded those districts,--Montagu and the Earl of Northumberland, to whom Edward had restored his lands and titles, and who, on condition of retaining them, had re-entered the service of Lancaster.  This last, a true server of the times, who had sided with all parties, now judged it discreet to remain neutral.  [This is the most favourable interpretation of his conduct: according to some he was in correspondence with Edward, who showed his letters.]  But Edward must pass within a few miles of Pontefract castle, where Montagu lay with a force that could destroy him at a blow.  Edward was prepared for the assault, but trusted to deceive the marquis, as he had deceived the citizens of York,--the more for the strong personal love Montagu had ever shown him.  If not, he was prepared equally to die in the field rather than eat again the bitter bread of the exile.  But to his inconceivable joy and astonishment, Montagu, like Northumberland, lay idle and supine.  Edward and his little troop threaded safely the formidable pass.  Alas! Montagu had that day received a formal order from the Duke of Clarence, as co-protector of the realm, [Our historians have puzzled their brains in ingenious conjectures of the cause of Montagu's fatal supineness at this juncture, and have passed over the only probable solution of the mystery, which is to be found simply enough stated thus in Stowe's Chronicle: \"The Marquess Montacute would have fought with King Edward, but that he had received letters from the Duke of Clarence that he should not fight till hee came.\"  This explanation is borne out by the Warkworth Chronicler and others, who, in an evident mistake of the person addressed, state that Clarence wrote word to Warwick not to fight till he came.  Clarence could not have written so to Warwick, who, according to all authorities, was mustering his troops near London, and not in the way to fight Edward; nor could Clarence have had authority to issue such commands to his colleague, nor would his colleague have attended to them, since we have the amplest testimony that Warwick was urging all his captains to attack Edward at once.  The duke's order was, therefore, clearly addressed to Montagu.] to suffer Edward to march on, provided his force was small, and he had taken the oaths to Henry, and assumed but the title of Duke of York,--\"for your brother the earl hath had compunctious visitings, and would fain forgive what hath passed, for my father's sake, and unite all factions by Edward's voluntary abdication of the throne; at all hazards, I am on my way northward, and you will not fight till I come.\"  The marquis,--who knew the conscientious doubts which Warwick had entertained in his darker hours, who had no right to disobey the co-protector, who knew no reason to suspect Lord Warwick's son-in-law, and who, moreover, was by no means anxious to be, himself, the executioner of Edward, whom he had once so truly loved,--though a little marvelling at Warwick's softness, yet did not discredit the letter, and the less regarded the free passage he left to the returned exiles, from contempt for the smallness of their numbers, and his persuasion that if the earl saw fit to alter his counsels, Edward was still more in his power the farther he advanced amidst a hostile population, and towards the armies which the Lords Exeter and Oxford were already mustering.  But that free passage was everything to Edward!  It made men think that Montagu, as well as Northumberland, favoured his enterprise; that the hazard was less rash and hopeless than it had seemed; that Edward counted upon finding his most powerful allies among those falsely supposed to be his enemies.  The popularity Edward had artfully acquired amongst the captains of Warwick's own troops, on the march to Middleham, now bestead him.  Many of them were knights and gentlemen residing in the very districts through which he passed.  They did not join him, but they did not oppose.  Then rapidly flocked to \"the Sun of York,\" first the adventurers and condottieri who in civil war adopt any side for pay; next came the disappointed, the ambitious, and the needy.  The hesitating began to resolve, the neutral to take a part. From the state of petitioners supplicating a pardon, every league the Yorkists marched advanced them to the dignity of assertors of a cause. Doncaster first, then Nottingham, then Leicester,--true to the town spirit we have before described,--opened their gates to the trader prince.  Oxford and Exeter reached Newark with their force.  Edward marched on them at once.  Deceived as to his numbers, they took panic and fled. When once the foe flies, friends ever start up from the very earth! Hereditary partisans--gentlemen, knights, and nobles--now flocked fast round the adventurer.  Then came Lovell and Cromwell and D'Eyncourt, ever true to York; and Stanley, never true to any cause.  Then came the brave knights Parr and Norris and De Burgh; and no less than three thousand retainers belonging to Lord Hastings--the new man--obeyed the summons of his couriers and joined their chief at Leicester.  Edward of March, who had landed at Ravenspur with a handful of brigands, now saw a king's army under his banner.  [The perplexity and confusion which involve the annals of this period may be guessed by this,--that two historians, eminent for research (Lingard and Sharon Turner), differ so widely as to the numbers who had now joined Edward, that Lingard asserts that at Nottingham he was at the head of fifty or sixty thousand men; and Turner gives him, at the most, between six and seven thousand.  The latter seems nearer to the truth.  We must here regret that Turner's partiality to the House of York induces him to slur over Edward's detestable perjury at York, and to accumulate all rhetorical arts to command admiration for his progress,--to the prejudice of the salutary moral horror we ought to feel for the atrocious perfidy and violation of oath to which he owed the first impunity that secured the after triumph.]  Then the audacious perjurer threw away the mask; then, forth went--not the prayer of the attainted Duke of York--but the proclamation of the indignant king.  England now beheld two sovereigns, equal in their armies.  It was no longer a rebellion to be crushed; it was a dynasty to be decided.     CHAPTER VI.  LORD WARWICK, WITH THE FOE IN THE FIELD AND THE TRAITOR AT THE HEARTH.  Every precaution which human wisdom could foresee had Lord Warwick taken to guard against invasion, or to crush it at the onset.  [Hall.] All the coasts on which it was most probable Edward would land had been strongly guarded.  And if the Humber had been left without regular troops, it was because prudence might calculate that the very spot where Edward did land was the very last he would have selected,-- unless guided by fate to his destruction,--in the midst of an unfriendly population, and in face of the armies of Northumberland and of Montagu.  The moment the earl heard of Edward's reception at York, --far from the weakness which the false Clarence (already in correspondence with Gloucester) imputed to him,--he despatched to Montagu, by Marmaduke Nevile, peremptory orders to intercept Edward's path, and give him battle before he could advance farther towards the centre of the island.  We shall explain presently why this messenger did not reach the marquis.  But Clarence was some hours before him in his intelligence and his measures.  When the earl next heard that Edward had passed Pontefract with impunity, and had reached Doncaster, he flew first to London, to arrange for its defence; consigned the care of Henry to the Archbishop of York, mustered a force already quartered in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, and then marched rapidly back towards Coventry, where he had left Clarence with seven thousand men; while he despatched new messengers to Montagu and Northumberland, severely rebuking the former for his supineness, and ordering him to march in all haste to attack Edward in the rear.  The earl's activity, promptitude, all-provident generalship, form a mournful contrast to the errors, the pusillanimity, and the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7725"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 11 (#7)"],["body","of others, which hitherto, as we have seen, made all his wisest schemes abortive.  Despite Clarence's sullenness, Warwick had discovered no reason, as yet, to doubt his good faith.  The oath he had taken--not only to Henry in London, but to Warwick at Amboise--had been the strongest which can bind man to man.  If the duke had not gained all he had hoped, he had still much to lose and much to dread by desertion to Edward.  He had been the loudest in bold assertions when he heard of the invasion; and above all, Isabel, whose influence over Clarence at that time the earl overrated, had, at the tidings of so imminent a danger to her father, forgot all her displeasure and recovered all her tenderness.  During Warwick's brief absence, Isabel had indeed exerted her utmost power to repair her former wrongs, and induce Clarence to be faithful to his oath.  Although her inconsistency and irresolution had much weakened her influence with the duke, for natures like his are governed but by the ascendancy of a steady and tranquil will, yet still she so far prevailed, that the duke had despatched to Richard a secret courier, informing him that he had finally resolved not to desert his father-in-law.  This letter reached Gloucester as the invaders were on their march to Coventry, before the strong walls of which the Duke of Clarence lay encamped.  Richard, after some intent and silent reflection, beckoned to him his familiar Catesby.  \"Marmaduke Nevile, whom our scouts seized on his way to Pontefract, is safe, and in the rear?\"  \"Yes, my lord; prisoners but encumber us; shall I give orders to the provost to end his captivity?\"  \"Ever ready, Catesby!\" said the duke, with a fell smile.  \"No; hark ye, Clarence vacillates.  If he hold firm to Warwick, and the two forces fight honestly against us, we are lost; on the other hand, if Clarence join us, his defection will bring not only the men he commands, all of whom are the retainers of the York lands and duchy, and therefore free from peculiar bias to the earl, and easily lured back to their proper chief; but it will set an example that will create such distrust and panic amongst the enemy, and give such hope of fresh desertions to our own men, as will open to us the keys of the metropolis.  But Clarence, I say, vacillates; look you, here is his letter from Amboise to King Edward; see, his duchess, Warwick's very daughter, approves the promise it contains!  If this letter reach Warwick, and Clarence knows it is in his hand, George will have no option but to join us.  He will never dare to face the earl, his pledge to Edward once revealed--\"  \"Most true; a very legal subtlety, my lord,\" said the lawyer Catesby, admiringly.  \"You can serve us in this.  Fall back; join Sir Marmaduke; affect to sympathize with him; affect to side with the earl; affect to make terms for Warwick's amity and favour; affect to betray us; affect to have stolen this letter.  Give it to young Nevile, artfully effect his escape, as if against our knowledge, and commend him to lose not an hour--a moment--in gaining the earl, and giving him so important a forewarning of the meditated treason of his son-in-law.\"  \"I will do all,--I comprehend; but how will the duke learn in time that the letter is on its way to Warwick?\"  \"I will seek the duke in his own tent.\"  \"And how shall I effect Sir Marmaduke's escape?\"  \"Send hither the officer who guards the prisoner; I will give him orders to obey thee in all things.\"  The invaders marched on.  The earl, meanwhile, had reached Warwick, hastened thence to throw himself into the stronger fortifications of the neighbouring Coventry, without the walls of which Clarence was still encamped; Edward advanced on the town of Warwick thus vacated; and Richard, at night, rode along to the camp of Clarence.  [Hall, and others.]  The next day, the earl was employed in giving orders to his lieutenants to march forth, join the troops of his son-in-law, who were a mile from the walls, and advance upon Edward, who had that morning quitted Warwick town, when suddenly Sir Marmaduke Nevile rushed into his presence, and, faltering out, \"Beware, beware!\" placed in his hands the fatal letter which Clarence had despatched from Amboise.  Never did blow more ruthless fall upon man's heart!  Clarence's perfidy--that might be disdained; but the closing lines, which revealed a daughter's treachery--words cannot express the father's anguish.  The letter dropped from his hand, a stupor seized his senses, and, ere yet recovered, pale men hurried into his presence to relate how, amidst joyous trumpets and streaming banners, Richard of Gloucester had led the Duke of Clarence to the brotherly embrace of Edward. [Hall.  The chronicler adds: \"It was no marvell that the Duke of Clarence with so small persuasion and less exhorting turned from the Earl of Warwick's party, for, as you have heard before, this marchandise was laboured, conducted, and concluded by a damsell, when the duke was in the French court, to the earl's utter confusion.\" Hume makes a notable mistake in deferring the date of Clarence's desertion to the battle of Barnet.]  Breaking from these messengers of evil news, that could not now surprise, the earl strode on, alone, to his daughter's chamber.  He placed the letter in her hands, and folding his arms said, \"What sayest thou of this, Isabel of Clarence?\"  The terror, the shame, the remorse, that seized upon the wretched lady, the death-like lips, the suppressed shriek, the momentary torpor, succeeded by the impulse which made her fall at her father's feet and clasp his knees,--told the earl, if he had before doubted, that the letter lied not; that Isabel had known and sanctioned its contents.  He gazed on her (as she grovelled at his feet) with a look that her eyes did well to shun.  \"Curse me not! curse me not!\" cried Isabel, awed by his very silence. \"It was but a brief frenzy.  Evil counsel, evil passion!  I was maddened that my boy had lost a crown.  I repented, I repented! Clarence shall yet be true.  He hath promised it, vowed it to me; hath written to Gloucester to retract all,--to--\"  \"Woman! Clarence is in Edward's camp!\"  Isabel started to her feet, and uttered a shriek so wild and despairing, that at least it gave to her father's lacerated heart the miserable solace of believing the last treason had not been shared.  A softer expression--one of pity, if not of pardon--stole over his dark face.  \"I curse thee not,\" he said; \"I rebuke thee not.  Thy sin hath its own penance.  Ill omen broods on the hearth of the household traitor! Never more shalt thou see holy love in a husband's smile.  His kiss shall have the taint of Judas.  From his arms thou shalt start with horror, as from those of thy wronged father's betrayer,--perchance his deathsman!  Ill omen broods on the cradle of the child for whom a mother's ambition was but a daughter's perfidy.  Woe to thee, wife and mother!  Even my forgiveness cannot avert thy doom!\"  \"Kill me! kill me!\" exclaimed Isabel, springing towards him; but seeing his face averted, his arms folded on his breast,--that noble breast, never again her shelter,--she fell lifeless on the floor.  [As our narrative does not embrace the future fate of the Duchess of Clarence, the reader will pardon us if we remind him that her first- born (who bore his illustrious grandfather's title of Earl of Warwick) was cast into prison on the accession of Henry VII., and afterwards beheaded by that king.  By birth, he was the rightful heir to the throne.  The ill-fated Isabel died young (five years after the date at which our tale has arrived).  One of her female attendants was tried and executed on the charge of having poisoned her.  Clarence lost no time in seeking to supply her place.  He solicited the hand of Mary of Burgundy, sole daughter and heir of Charles the Bold.  Edward's jealousy and fear forbade him to listen to an alliance that might, as Lingard observes, enable Clarence \"to employ the power of Burgundy to win the crown of England;\" and hence arose those dissensions which ended in the secret murder of the perjured duke.]  The earl looked round, to see that none were by to witness his weakness, took her gently in his arms, laid her on her couch, and, bending over her a moment, prayed to God to pardon her.  He then hastily left the room, ordered her handmaids and her litter, and while she was yet unconscious, the gates of the town opened, and forth through the arch went the closed and curtained vehicle which bore the ill-fated duchess to the new home her husband had made with her father's foe!  The earl watched it from the casement of his tower, and said to himself,--  \"I had been unmanned, had I known her within the same walls.  Now forever I dismiss her memory and her crime.  Treachery hath done its worst, and my soul is proof against all storms!\"  At night came messengers from Clarence and Edward, who had returned to Warwick town, with offers of pardon to the earl, with promises of favour, power, and grace.  To Edward the earl deigned no answer; to the messenger of Clarence he gave this: \"Tell thy master I had liefer be always like myself than like a false and a perjured duke, and that I am determined never to leave the war till I have lost mine own life, or utterly extinguished and put down my foes.\"  [Hall.]  After this terrible defection, neither his remaining forces, nor the panic amongst them which the duke's desertion had occasioned, nor the mighty interests involved in the success of his arms, nor the irretrievable advantage which even an engagement of equivocal result with the earl in person would give to Edward, justified Warwick in gratifying the anticipations of the enemy,--that his valour and wrath would urge him into immediate and imprudent battle.  Edward, after the vain bravado of marching up to the walls of Coventry, moved on towards London.  Thither the earl sent Marmaduke, enjoining the Archbishop of York and the lord mayor but "]]]
