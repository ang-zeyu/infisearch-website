But, then, shoveling dirt in, without the timbers and the hollow steel piles will do no good,” continued Hawkins, with a shake of his head. “It would be worse than wasted work.”  “I know all that,” Tom admitted. “To tell you the truth, Mr. Hawkins, I wouldn't mind the men's idleness quite so much if it weren't that the pay train comes in this afternoon. An idle man, not over-nice about his habits, and with a lot of money in his pockets, is a source of danger. We're going to have five hundred such danger spots as soon as the men are paid off.”  “Don't know that, sir!” demanded Superintendent Hawkins. “The town of Paloma is just dancing on sand-paper, it's so uneasy about getting its hand into the pile of more than thirty-eight thousand dollars that the pay train is going to bring in this afternoon.”  “I know,” nodded Tom rather gloomily. “I hate to see the men fleeced as they're likely to be fleeced to-night. Some of our men will be so badly done up that it will be a week before they get back to work--unless there is some way that we can stop the fleecing.”  “There isn't any such way,” declared Superintendent Hawkins, with an air of conviction.  “You've surely been around rough railroading camps enough to know that, Mr. Reade.”  “I've seen a good deal of the life, Hawkins,” Tom answered, “but of course I don't know it all.”  “Yet you know that you can't hope to stop railroad jacks from spending their money in their own way. The saloons in Paloma will take in thousands of dollars from our lads to-night and all day to-morrow. The gamblers will swindle them out of a whole lot more. Day after to-morrow, Mr. Reade, you wouldn't be able to borrow twenty dollars from our whole force.”  “It's a shame,” burst from Tom indignantly, as the three turned to gaze westward across the desert. “These men work as hard as any toilers in the world. They receive good wages. Yet where do you find a railroad jack who, after years and years of toil on these burning deserts, has two or three hundred dollars of his own saved?”  Hawkins shrugged his shoulders.  “I know all about it,” he responded, “and I grow angry every time I think about it. Yet how is one going to protect these, men against themselves?”  “I believe there's a way,” spoke Tom confidently.  “I hope you can find it, then, Mr. Reade,” retorted Hawkins skeptically.  “At any rate, I'm going to try.”  “What are you going to do, Mr. Reade?” demanded the superintendent curiously.  “You'll be with me, won't you?” coaxed Tom.  “You'll stand with us, shoulder to shoulder.”  “I certainly will, Mr. Reade!”  “And the foremen? You can depend upon them?”  “On every one of them,” declared Hawkins promptly. “Even to the Mexican foreman, Mendoza. He's a greaser, but he's a brick, and a white man all the way through!”  “Call the foremen in, then--all except Payson, who is with his gang.”  Tom and Harry stepped inside the office. Mr. Hawkins strolled away, but within ten minutes he was back again, followed by Foremen Bell, Rivers and Mendoza.  “Two wagons have driven up, east of here,” announced Mr. Hawkins, as he entered the office building. “They've stopped a quarter of a mile below here and have dumped two tents. I think they're about to raise them.”  Tom stepped hastily outside, glancing eastward, where they saw what the superintendent had described. One of the tents had just been raised, though the pitching of it had not yet been thoroughly done.  “What crowd is that?” Reade asked. “Who is at the head of it?”  “I see one man there--the only man in good clothes--who looks like Jim Duff,” replied the superintendent, using his field glasses.  “The gambler?” asked Tom sharply.  “The same.”  “He's pitching his tent on the railroad's dirt, isn't he!”  “Yes, sir.”  “Come along. We'll have a look at that place.”  A few minutes of brisk walking brought the young engineers, the superintendent and the three foremen to the spot.  Tent number one had been pitched. It was a circular tent, some forty feet in diameter. The second tent, only a little smaller, was now being hoisted.  “Who's in charge of this work?” asked Tom in his usual pleasant tone.  “My manager, Mr. Bemis--Dock Bemis,” answered Jim Duff suavely, as he moved forward to meet the party. “Dock, come here. I want you to know Mr. Reade, the engineer in charge of this job.”  Duff's manners were impudently easy and assured. The fellow known as Dock Bemis, an unprepossessing, shabbily dressed man of thirty-five, with a mean face and an ugly-looking eye, came forward.  “I'll take Mr. Bemis's acquaintance for granted,” Tom continued, with an easy smile. “You own this outfit, don't you, Mr. Duff?”  “I've rented it, if you mean the tents, tables and chairs,” assented the gambler. “I've a stock of liquors coming over as soon as I send one of the wagons back.”  “What do you propose to do with all this?” Tom inquired.  “Why, of course, you see,” smiled Duff, with all the suavity in the world, “as your boys are going to be paid off this afternoon they'll want to go somewhere to enjoy themselves. As the day is very hot I thought it would be showing good intentions if I brought an outfit over here. I'll have everything ready within an hour.”  “So that you can get our men intoxicated and fleece them more easily?”  asked Tom, with his best smile. “Is that the idea?”  Jim buff flushed angrily. Then his face became pale.  “It's a crude way you have of expressing it, Mr. Reade, if you Ill allow me to say so,” the gambler answered, in a voice choked with anger. “I am going to offer your men a little amusement. It's what they need, and what they'll insist upon. Do you see? There's a small mob coming this way now.”  Tom turned, discovering about a hundred railroad laborers coming down the road.  “Mr. Duff,” asked the young chief engineer, “can you show any proof of your authority to erect tents on the railroad's land?”  “What other place around here, Mr. Reade, would be as convenient?”  demanded the gambler.  “I repeat my question, sir! Have you any authority or warrant for erecting tents here?”  “Do you mean, have I a permit from the railroad company?”  “You know very well what I mean, Duff.”  Though Reade's tone was somewhat sharper, his smile was as genial as ever.  “I didn't imagine you'd have any objection to my coming here,” the gambler replied evasively.  “Have you any authority to be on the railroad's land's?” persisted Tom Reade. “Yes or no?”  “No-o-o-o, I haven't, unless I can persuade you to see how reasonable it is that your men should be provided with enjoyment right at their own camp.”  “Take the tents down, then, as quickly as you can accomplish it,”  directed Tom, though in a quiet voice.  “And--if I don't?” asked Duff, smiling dangerously and displaying his white, dog-like teeth.  “Then I shall direct one of the foremen to call a sufficient force, Mr. Duff, to take down your tents and remove them from railroad property. I am not seeking trouble with you, sir; I don't want trouble. But, as long as I remain in charge here no gambling or drinking places are going to be opened on the railroad's land.”  “Mr. Reade,” inquired the gambler, his smile fading, “do you object to giving me a word in private?”  “Not at all,” Tom declared. “But it won't help your plans.”  “I'd like just a word with you alone,” coaxed the gambler.  Nodding, Reade stepped away with the gambler to a distance of a hundred feet or so from the rapidly increasing crowd.  “I expect to make a little money out of this tent outfit, of course,”  explained Jim Duff.  “I expect that you won't make a dollar out of it--on railway property,”  returned Reade steadily.  “I'm going to make a little money--not much,” Duff went on. “Now, if I can make the whole deal with you, and if no one else is allowed to bother me, I can afford to pass you one hundred dollars a day for the tent privilege.”  Before even expectant Tom realized what was happening, Duff had pressed a wad of paper money into his hand.  “What is this?” demanded Reade.  “Don't let everyone see it,” warned the gambler. “You'll find two hundred dollars there, in bills. That's for the first two days of our tent privilege here.”  “You contemptible hound!” exclaimed Tom angrily.  Whish! The tightly folded wad of bank notes left Tom's hand, landing squarely in Jim Duff Is face.  In an instant the gambler's face turned white. His hand flew back to a pocket in which he carried a pistol.     CHAPTER III. TOM MAKES A SPEECH ON GAMBLING   “Cut out the gun-play! That doesn't go here!” Tom uttered warningly.  One swift step forward, and one hand caught Jim Duff by the throat. With the other hand Tom caught Duff's right wrist and wrenched away the pistol that instantly appeared in the gambler's hand.  The weapon Tom threw on the ground, some feet away. Then, with eyes blazing with contempt, Tom Reade struck the gambler heavily across the face with the flat of his hand. Hard work had added to the young engineer's muscle of earlier days, and the gambler was staggered.  Another instant, and Superintendent Hawkins who, with Hazelton and the foremen, had run up to them, seized Duff roughly from behind, holding his arms pinioned.  Harry Hazelton picked up the revolver. Quickly opening it, he drew out the cartridges.  “Mr. Bell!” called Harry, and the foreman of that name hastened to him.  “Take this thing back to the office and break it up with a hammer,”  directed young Hazelton, as he passed the revolver to the foreman. The latter sped away on his errand.  “Let Duff go, Mr. Hawkins,” directed Tom. “I'm not afraid of him. Duff, I wish to apologize to you for striking you in the face. I wouldn't allow any man to do that to me. But your action in reaching for a pistol was so childish--or cowardly, whichever you prefer to call it--that I admit I forgot myself for a moment. Now, you are not going to erect any tents for gambling or other unworthy purposes on the railroad's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8153"],["title","The Young Engineers in Arizona; or, Laying Tracks on the Man-killer Quicksand (#4)"],["body","roperty. It's bad business to let you do anything of the sort. I trust that there will be no hard feeling between us.”  “Hard feeling?” hissed Jim Duff, his wicked-looking face paler than ever. “Boy, you needn't try to crawl back into my good graces after the way you acted toward me!”  “I'm not trying to crawl into your esteem, or to get there by any other means,” Tom answered quietly, though with a firmness that caused superintendent and foremen to feel a new respect for their young chief engineer. “At the same time, Duff, I don't believe in stirring up bad blood with anyone. You and I haven't the same way of regarding your line of business. That's the main difficulty. As I can't see your point of view, it would be hardly fair to expect you to understand my way of regarding what you wished to do here. Your tents will have to come down and be moved, but I have no personal feeling in the matter. How soon can you get your tents down?”  “They are not coming down, I tell you!” snarled the gambler.  “That's where you and I fail once more to agree,” replied Tom steadily, looking the other straight in the eyes. “It's merely a question of whether you will take them down, or whether I shall set our own men to doing it.”  Jim Duff had brought with him about a dozen men of his own. They were a somewhat picturesque-looking crowd, though not necessarily dangerous men. They were mostly men who had been hired to run the gaming tables under the canvas. A judge of men would have immediately classified them as inferior specimens of manhood.  So far these men had not offered to take any part in the dispute. Now Duff moved over to them quickly, muttering the words:  “Stand by me!”  As for Tom Reade, he was backed by five men, including his chum. Though none of Reade's force was armed, the young engineer knew that he could depend upon them.  Followed by his adherents, Duff took a few quick strides forward. This brought him face to face with Reade's labors, of whom now more than two hundred were present.  “Are you men or squaws?” called, Duff loudly. “I have brought the stuff over here for a merry night of it. This boy says you can't have your enjoyment. Are you going to let him rule you in that fashion, or are you going to throw him out of here?”  There came from the crowd a gradually increasing murmur of rage.  “Throw this boy out, if you're men!” Duff jeered. “Throw him out, I say, and send word to your railroad people to put a man here in his place.”  The murmurs increased, especially from the Mexicans, for the Mexican peon, or laborer, is often a furious gambler who will stake even the shirt on his back.  Foreman Mendoza, who understood his own people, started forward, but Tom, with a signal, caused him to halt.  “Throw him out, I say!” yelled Duff shrilly. “Duff, I'm afraid you're making a fool of yourself,” remarked Tom, stepping forward, smiling cheerfully.  Yet another murmur, now growing to a yell, rose from some of the men--a few of the men, too, who were not Mexicans, and a half-hearted rush was made in the young engineer's direction.  “Throw him out! Hustle the boy out!” Duff urged.  “Stop! Stop right in your tracks!” thundered Tom Reade, taking still another step toward the now angrier crowd. “Men, listen to me, and you'll get a proper understanding of this affair. Jim Duff wants me thrown out of here--”  “Yes! And out you'll go!” roared a voice from the rear of the crowd.  “That's a question that the next few minutes will settle,” Tom rejoined, with a smile. “If Jim Duff wants me thrown out of here, why don't you men tell him to do it himself?”  The force of this suggestion, with the memory of what they had recently seen, struck home with many of the men. A shout of laughter went up, followed by yells of:  “That's right--dead right!”  “Sail in, Jim!”  “Throw him out, Jim! We'll see fair play!”  Tom made an ironical bow in the direction of the gambler.  “Have you men gone crazy!” yelled Jim Duff hoarsely.  “Have you lost your nerve, Jim?” bawled a lusty American laborer. “You want this boy, as you call him, thrown out, and we're waiting to see you do it. It you haven't the nerve to tackle the job, then you're not a man to give us orders!”  Tom's smiling good humor and his fair proposition had swung the balance of feeling against the gambler. Duff saw that he had lost ground.  “Boy,” called a few voices, “if Duff won't throw you out, then you turn the tables and throw him out.”  “It isn't necessary,” laughed Tom. “After the tents are gone Duff won't have any desire to remain around here. Mr. Duff, I ask you for the last time, will you have your men take down the tents and remove them?”  “I won't!” snarled the gambler.  “Mr. Rivers!” called Tom.  “Yes, sir,” replied the foreman, stepping forward.  “Mr. Rivers, take twenty-five laborers and bring the tents down at once. Be careful to see that no damage is done. As soon as they are down you will load them on the wagons.”  “Yes, sir.”  “On second thought, you had better take fifty men. See that the work is done as promptly as possible.”  The Mexicans, who were in the majority, and nearly all of whom were wildly eager to gamble as soon as their money arrived, stirred uneasily. They might have interfered, but Foreman Mendoza ran among his countrymen, calling out to them vigorously in Spanish, and with so much emphasis that the men sullenly withdrew.  Foreman Rivers speedily had his fifty men, together, none of whom were Mexicans.  “Touch a single guy-rope at your peril!” warned Jim Duff menacingly, but big Superintendent Hawkins seized the gambler by the shoulders, gently, though, firmly, removing him from the vicinity of the tents.  All in a flash the work was done. Canvas and poles were loaded on to the wagons. Mr. Rivers's men had entered so thoroughly into the spirit of the thing that, they forced the drivers to start off, and the gambler's men to follow.  Goaded to the last ditch of desperation, Jim Duff now strode over to where Tom stood. No one opposed him, nor did Reade's smile fail.  “Boy, you've had your laugh, just now,” announced the gambler, in his most threatening, tone. “It will be your last laugh.”  “Oh, I hope not,” drawled Tom.  “You will know more within twenty-four hours. You have treated me, with your own crowd about you, like a dog.”  “You're wrong again,” laughed Tom.. “Jim is fond of dogs. They are fine fellows.”  “You may laugh as much as you want, just now,” jeered Jim Duff. “You've made an enemy, and one of the worst in Arizona! I won't waste any more talk on you--except to warn you.”  “Warn me? About what?” asked Tom curiously.  Instead of answering, Jim Duff turned on his heel, stalking off with a majesty that, somehow, looked sadly damaged.  “He has warned you,” murmured Superintendent Hawkins in an undertone. “That is your hint that Duff will fight you to the death at the first opportunity.”  “May it be long in coming!” uttered Tom devoutly.  Then, as he turned about and saw scores of laborers coming in his direction, Reade remembered what he wished to do.  “Mr. Hawkins,” he continued, turning toward the superintendent, “I see that Mr. Payson's gang is coming in from work. As all our men are now idle, I wish you would direct the foremen to see that all hands assemble here. I have something to say to them.”  Within ten minutes the five hundred laborers and mechanics had been gathered in a compact crowd. Now that the excitement of hustling the gambler off the scene had died away, many of the men were sorry that they had not made their disapproval plainer. Though Tom Reade plainly understood the mood of the men, he mounted a barrel, holding up both hands as a sign for silence.  “Now, men,” he began, “you all know that the pay train is due here this afternoon. You are all eager to get your money--for what? It is a strange fact that gold is the carrion that draws all of the vultures. A few minutes ago you saw one of the vultures here, preparing to get his supposed share of your money away from you. Does Jim Duff care a hang about any of you? Do any of you care anything whatever for Jim Duff? Then why should you be so eager to get into one of his tents and let him take your money away from you?  “It is true that, once in a while, a solitary player gets a few dollars away from a gambler. Yet, in the end, the gambler has every dollar of the crowd that patronizes him. You men have been out in the hot sun for weeks, working hard to earn the money that the pay train is bringing you. Has Jim Duff done any work in the last few weeks? While you men have been toiling and sweating, what has Duff been doing? Hasn't he been going around wearing the clothes and the air of a gentleman, while you men have been giving all but your lives for your dollars, while you have been denied most of the comforts of living. Hasn't Duff been up at the Mansion House, living on the fat of the land and smiling to himself every time he thought of you men, who would be ready to hand him all of your money as soon as it came to you? Is the gambler, who grows fat on the toil of others, but never toils himself, any better than the vulture that feeds upon the animals killed by others? Isn't the gambler a parasite, pure and simple? On whose lifeblood does the gambler feed, unless it's on yours?”  Tom continued his harangue, becoming more and more intense, yet carrying his talk along in all simplicity, and with a directness that made scores of the workmen look sheepish.  “Whenever you find a man anywhere who professes to be working for your good, or for your amusement, and who gets all the benefit in the end, why don't you open your eyes to him?” Tom inquired presently. “Over in Paloma there are saloon keepers who are cleaning up their dives and opening new lots of liquor that they feel sure they're going to sell you to-night. These dive keepers are ready to welcome you with open arms, and they'll try to make you feel that you're royal good fellows and that they are the best friends you"]]]
