We're replacing the whole thing with broadband uplinks of gestalts from each of the Presidents' lives: newspaper headlines, speeches, distilled biographies, personal papers. It'll be like having each President _inside_ you, core-dumped in a few seconds. Debra said we're going to _flash-bake_ the Presidents on your mind!\" His eyes glittered in the twilight.  Having only recently experienced my own cerebral flash-baking, Tim's description struck a chord in me. My personality seemed to be rattling around a little in my mind, as though it had been improperly fitted. It made the idea of having the gestalt of 50-some Presidents squashed in along with it perversely appealing.  \"Wow,\" I said. \"That sounds wild. What do you have in mind for physical plant?\" The Hall as it stood had a quiet, patriotic dignity cribbed from a hundred official buildings of the dead USA. Messing with it would be like redesigning the stars-and-bars.  \"That's not really my area,\" Tim said. \"I'm a programmer. But I could have one of the designers squirt some plans at you, if you want.\"  \"That would be fine,\" Lil said, taking my elbow. \"I think we should be heading home, now, though.\" She began to tug me away. Dan took my other elbow. Behind her, the Liberty Belle glowed like a ghostly wedding cake in the twilight.  \"That's too bad,\" Tim said. \"My ad-hoc is pulling an all-nighter on the new Hall. I'm sure they'd love to have you drop by.\"  The idea seized hold of me. I would go into the camp of the enemy, sit by their fire, learn their secrets. \"That would be _great_!\" I said, too loudly. My head was buzzing slightly. Lil's hands fell away.  \"But we've got an early morning tomorrow,\" Lil said. \"You've got a shift at eight, and I'm running into town for groceries.\" She was lying, but she was telling me that this wasn't her idea of a smart move. But my faith was unshakeable.  \"Eight a.m. shift? No problem -- I'll be right here when it starts. I'll just grab a shower at the Contemporary in the morning and catch the monorail back in time to change. All right?\"  Dan tried. \"But Jules, we were going to grab some dinner at Cinderella's Royal Table, remember? I made reservations.\"  \"Aw, we can eat any time,\" I said. \"This is a hell of an opportunity.\"  \"It sure is,\" Dan said, giving up. \"Mind if I come along?\"  He and Lil traded meaningful looks that I interpreted to mean, _If he's going to be a nut, one of us really should stay with him_. I was past caring -- I was going to beard the lion in his den!  Tim was apparently oblivious to all of this. \"Then it's settled! Let's go.\"  #  On the walk to the Hall, Dan kept ringing my cochlea and I kept sending him straight to voicemail. All the while, I kept up a patter of small- talk with him and Tim. I was determined to make up for my debacle in the Mansion with Tim, win him over.  Debra's people were sitting around in the armchairs onstage, the animatronic presidents stacked in neat piles in the wings. Debra was sprawled in Lincoln's armchair, her head cocked lazily, her legs extended before her. The Hall's normal smells of ozone and cleanliness were overridden by sweat and machine-oil, the stink of an ad-hoc pulling an all-nighter. The Hall took fifteen years to research and execute, and a couple of days to tear down.  She was au-naturel, still wearing the face she'd been born with, albeit one that had been regenerated dozens of times after her deaths. It was patrician, waxy, long, with a nose that was made for staring down. She was at least as old as I was, though she was only apparent 22. I got the sense that she picked this age because it was one that afforded boundless reserves of energy.  She didn't deign to rise as I approached, but she did nod languorously at me. The other ad-hocs had been split into little clusters, hunched over terminals. They all had the raccoon-eyed, sleep-deprived look of fanatics, even Debra, who managed to look lazy and excited simultaneously.  _Did you have me killed_? I wondered, staring at Debra. After all, she'd been killed dozens, if not hundreds of times. It might not be such a big deal for her.  \"Hi there,\" I said, brightly. \"Tim offered to show us around! You know Dan, right?\"  Debra nodded at him. \"Oh, sure. Dan and I are pals, right?\"  Dan's poker face didn't twitch a muscle. \"Hello, Debra,\" he said. He'd been hanging out with them since Lil had briefed him on the peril to the Mansion, trying to gather some intelligence for us to use. They knew what he was up to, of course, but Dan was a fairly charming guy and he worked like a mule, so they tolerated him. But it seemed like he'd violated a boundary by accompanying me, as though the polite fiction that he was more a part of Debra's ad-hoc than Lil's was shattered by my presence.  Tim said, \"Can I show them the demo, Debra?\"  Debra quirked an eyebrow, then said, \"Sure, why not. You'll like this, guys.\"  Tim hustled us backstage, where Lil and I used to sweat over the animatronics and cop surreptitious feels. Everything had been torn loose, packed up, stacked. They hadn't wasted a moment -- they'd spent a week tearing down a show that had run for more than a century. The scrim that the projected portions of the show normally screened on was ground into the floor, spotted with grime, footprints and oil.  Tim showed me to a half-assembled backup terminal. Its housing was off, and any number of wireless keyboards, pointers and gloves lay strewn about it. It had the look of a prototype.  \"This is it -- our uplink. So far, we've got a demo app running on it: Lincoln's old speech, along with the civil-war montage. Just switch on guest access and I'll core-dump it to you. It's wild.\"  I pulled up my HUD and switched on guest access. Tim pointed a finger at the terminal and my brain was suffused with the essence of Lincoln: every nuance of his speech, the painstakingly researched movement tics, his warts and beard and topcoat. It almost felt like I _was_ Lincoln, for a moment, and then it passed. But I could still taste the lingering coppery flavor of cannon-fire and chewing tobacco.  I staggered backwards. My head swam with flash-baked sense-impressions, rich and detailed. I knew on the spot that Debra's Hall of the Presidents was going to be a hit.  Dan took a shot off the uplink, too. Tim and I watched him as his expression shifted from skepticism to delight. Tim looked expectantly at me.  \"That's really fine,\" I said. \"Really, really fine. Moving.\"  Tim blushed. \"Thanks! I did the gestalt programming -- it's my specialty.\"  Debra spoke up from behind him -- she'd sauntered over while Dan was getting his jolt. \"I got the idea in Beijing, when I was dying a lot. There's something wonderful about having memories implanted, like you're really working your brain. I love the synthetic clarity of it all.\"  Tim sniffed. \"Not synthetic at all,\" he said, turning to me. \"It's nice and soft, right?\"  I sensed deep political shoals and was composing my reply when Debra said: \"Tim keeps trying to make it all more impressionistic, less computer-y. He's wrong, of course. We don't want to simulate the experience of watching the show -- we want to _transcend it_.\"  Tim nodded reluctantly. \"Sure, transcend it. But the way we do that is by making the experience _human_, a mile in the presidents' shoes. Empathy-driven. What's the point of flash-baking a bunch of dry facts on someone's brain?\"  ========= CHAPTER 4 =========  One night in the Hall of Presidents convinced me of three things:  1. That Debra's people had had me killed, and screw their alibis,  2. That they would kill me again, when the time came for them to make a play for the Haunted Mansion,  3. That our only hope for saving the Mansion was a preemptive strike against them: we had to hit them hard, where it hurt.  Dan and I had been treated to eight hours of insectile precision in the Hall of Presidents, Debra's people working with effortless cooperation born of the adversity they'd faced in Beijing. Debra moved from team to team, making suggestions with body language as much as with words, leaving bursts of inspired activity in her wake.  It was that precision that convinced me of point one. Any ad-hoc this tight could pull off anything if it advanced their agenda. Ad-hoc? Hell, call them what they were: an army.  Point two came to me when I sampled the Lincoln build that Tim finished at about three in the morning, after intensive consultation with Debra. The mark of a great ride is that it gets better the second time around, as the detail and flourishes start to impinge on your consciousness. The Mansion was full of little gimcracks and sly nods that snuck into your experience on each successive ride.  Tim shuffled his feet nervously, bursting with barely restrained pride as I switched on public access. He dumped the app to my public directory, and, gingerly, I executed it.  God! God and Lincoln and cannon-fire and oratory and ploughs and mules and greatcoats! It rolled over me, it punched through me, it crashed against the inside of my skull and rebounded. The first pass through, there had been a sense of order, of narrative, but this, this was gestalt, the whole thing in one undifferentiated ball, filling me and spilling over. It was panicky for a moment, as the essence of Lincolness seemed to threaten my own personality, and, just as it was about to overwhelm me, it receded, leaving behind a rush of endorphin and adrenaline that made me want to jump.  \"Tim,\" I gasped. \"Tim! That was. . .\" Words failed me. I wanted to hug him. What we could do for the Mansion with this! What elegance! Directly imprinting the experience, without recourse to the stupid, blind eyes; the thick, deaf ears.  Tim beamed and basked, and Debra nodded solemnly from her throne. \"You liked it?\" Tim said. I nodded, and staggered back to the theatre seat where Dan slept, head thrown back, snores softly rattling in his throat.

INTRODUCTORY ROMANCE PROM THE PEN OF WILLIAM TINKLING, ESQ. {251}   THIS beginning-part is not made out of anybody’s head, you know.  It’s real.  You must believe this beginning-part more than what comes after, else you won’t understand how what comes after came to be written.  You must believe it all; but you must believe this most, please.  I am the editor of it.  Bob Redforth (he’s my cousin, and shaking the table on purpose) wanted to be the editor of it; but I said he shouldn’t because he couldn’t.  _He_ has no idea of being an editor.  Nettie Ashford is my bride.  We were married in the right-hand closet in the corner of the dancing-school, where first we met, with a ring (a green one) from Wilkingwater’s toy-shop.  _I_ owed for it out of my pocket-money.  When the rapturous ceremony was over, we all four went up the lane and let off a cannon (brought loaded in Bob Redforth’s waistcoat-pocket) to announce our nuptials.  It flew right up when it went off, and turned over.  Next day, Lieut.-Col. Robin Redforth was united, with similar ceremonies, to Alice Rainbird.  This time the cannon burst with a most terrific explosion, and made a puppy bark.  My peerless bride was, at the period of which we now treat, in captivity at Miss Grimmer’s.  Drowvey and Grimmer is the partnership, and opinion is divided which is the greatest beast.  The lovely bride of the colonel was also immured in the dungeons of the same establishment.  A vow was entered into, between the colonel and myself, that we would cut them out on the following Wednesday when walking two and two.  Under the desperate circumstances of the case, the active brain of the colonel, combining with his lawless pursuit (he is a pirate), suggested an attack with fireworks.  This, however, from motives of humanity, was abandoned as too expensive.  Lightly armed with a paper-knife buttoned up under his jacket, and waving the dreaded black flag at the end of a cane, the colonel took command of me at two P.M. on the eventful and appointed day.  He had drawn out the plan of attack on a piece of paper, which was rolled up round a hoop-stick.  He showed it to me.  My position and my full-length portrait (but my real ears don’t stick out horizontal) was behind a corner lamp-post, with written orders to remain there till I should see Miss Drowvey fall.  The Drowvey who was to fall was the one in spectacles, not the one with the large lavender bonnet.  At that signal I was to rush forth, seize my bride, and fight my way to the lane.  There a junction would be effected between myself and the colonel; and putting our brides behind us, between ourselves and the palings, we were to conquer or die.  The enemy appeared,—approached.  Waving his black flag, the colonel attacked.  Confusion ensued.  Anxiously I awaited my signal; but my signal came not.  So far from falling, the hated Drowvey in spectacles appeared to me to have muffled the colonel’s head in his outlawed banner, and to be pitching into him with a parasol.  The one in the lavender bonnet also performed prodigies of valour with her fists on his back. Seeing that all was for the moment lost, I fought my desperate way hand to hand to the lane.  Through taking the back road, I was so fortunate as to meet nobody, and arrived there uninterrupted.  It seemed an age ere the colonel joined me.  He had been to the jobbing tailor’s to be sewn up in several places, and attributed our defeat to the refusal of the detested Drowvey to fall.  Finding her so obstinate, he had said to her, ‘Die, recreant!’ but had found her no more open to reason on that point than the other.  My blooming bride appeared, accompanied by the colonel’s bride, at the dancing-school next day.  What?  Was her face averted from me?  Hah? Even so.  With a look of scorn, she put into my hand a bit of paper, and took another partner.  On the paper was pencilled, ‘Heavens!  Can I write the word?  Is my husband a cow?’  In the first bewilderment of my heated brain, I tried to think what slanderer could have traced my family to the ignoble animal mentioned above.  Vain were my endeavours.  At the end of that dance I whispered the colonel to come into the cloak-room, and I showed him the note.  ‘There is a syllable wanting,’ said he, with a gloomy brow.  ‘Hah!  What syllable?’ was my inquiry.  ‘She asks, can she write the word?  And no; you see she couldn’t,’ said the colonel, pointing out the passage.  ‘And the word was?’ said I.  ‘Cow—cow—coward,’ hissed the pirate-colonel in my ear, and gave me back the note.  Feeling that I must for ever tread the earth a branded boy,—person I mean,—or that I must clear up my honour, I demanded to be tried by a court-martial.  The colonel admitted my right to be tried.  Some difficulty was found in composing the court, on account of the Emperor of France’s aunt refusing to let him come out.  He was to be the president. Ere yet we had appointed a substitute, he made his escape over the back-wall, and stood among us, a free monarch.  The court was held on the grass by the pond.  I recognised, in a certain admiral among my judges, my deadliest foe.  A cocoa-nut had given rise to language that I could not brook; but confiding in my innocence, and also in the knowledge that the President of the United States (who sat next him) owed me a knife, I braced myself for the ordeal.  It was a solemn spectacle, that court.  Two executioners with pinafores reversed led me in.  Under the shade of an umbrella I perceived my bride, supported by the bride of the pirate-colonel.  The president, having reproved a little female ensign for tittering, on a matter of life or death, called upon me to plead, ‘Coward or no coward, guilty or not guilty?’  I pleaded in a firm tone, ‘No coward and not guilty.’  (The little female ensign being again reproved by the president for misconduct, mutinied, left the court, and threw stones.)  My implacable enemy, the admiral, conducted the case against me.  The colonel’s bride was called to prove that I had remained behind the corner lamp-post during the engagement.  I might have been spared the anguish of my own bride’s being also made a witness to the same point, but the admiral knew where to wound me.  Be still, my soul, no matter.  The colonel was then brought forward with his evidence.  It was for this point that I had saved myself up, as the turning-point of my case.  Shaking myself free of my guards,—who had no business to hold me, the stupids, unless I was found guilty,—I asked the colonel what he considered the first duty of a soldier?  Ere he could reply, the President of the United States rose and informed the court, that my foe, the admiral, had suggested ‘Bravery,’ and that prompting a witness wasn’t fair.  The president of the court immediately ordered the admiral’s mouth to be filled with leaves, and tied up with string.  I had the satisfaction of seeing the sentence carried into effect before the proceedings went further.  I then took a paper from my trousers-pocket, and asked, ‘What do you consider, Col.  Redford, the first duty of a soldier?  Is it obedience?’  ‘It is,’ said the colonel.  ‘Is that paper—please to look at it—in your hand?’  ‘It is,’ said the colonel.  ‘Is it a military sketch?’  ‘It is,’ said the colonel.  ‘Of an engagement?’  ‘Quite so,’ said the colonel.  ‘Of the late engagement?’  ‘Of the late engagement.’  ‘Please to describe it, and then hand it to the president of the court.’  From that triumphant moment my sufferings and my dangers were at an end. The court rose up and jumped, on discovering that I had strictly obeyed orders.  My foe, the admiral, who though muzzled was malignant yet, contrived to suggest that I was dishonoured by having quitted the field. But the colonel himself had done as much, and gave his opinion, upon his word and honour as a pirate, that when all was lost the field might be quitted without disgrace.  I was going to be found ‘No coward and not guilty,’ and my blooming bride was going to be publicly restored to my arms in a procession, when an unlooked-for event disturbed the general rejoicing.  This was no other than the Emperor of France’s aunt catching hold of his hair.  The proceedings abruptly terminated, and the court tumultuously dissolved.  It was when the shades of the next evening but one were beginning to fall, ere yet the silver beams of Luna touched the earth, that four forms might have been descried slowly advancing towards the weeping willow on the borders of the pond, the now deserted scene of the day before yesterday’s agonies and triumphs.  On a nearer approach, and by a practised eye, these might have been identified as the forms of the pirate-colonel with his bride, and of the day before yesterday’s gallant prisoner with his bride.  On the beauteous faces of the Nymphs dejection sat enthroned.  All four reclined under the willow for some minutes without speaking, till at length the bride of the colonel poutingly observed, ‘It’s of no use pretending any more, and we had better give it up.’  ‘Hah!’ exclaimed the pirate.  ‘Pretending?’  ‘Don’t go on like that; you worry me,’ returned his bride.  The lovely bride of Tinkling echoed the incredible declaration.  The two warriors exchanged stony glances.  ‘If,’ said the bride of the pirate-colonel, ‘grown-up people WON’T do what they ought to do, and WILL put us out, what comes of our pretending?’  ‘We only get into scrapes,’ said the bride of Tinkling.  ‘You know very well,’ pursued the colonel’s bride, ‘that Miss Drowvey wouldn’t fall.  You complained of it yourself.  And you know how disgracefully the court-martial ended.  As to our marriage; would my people acknowledge it at home?’  ‘Or would my people acknowledge ours?’ said the bride of Tinkling.  Again the two warriors exchanged stony glances.  ‘If you knocked at the door and claimed me, after you were told to go away,’ said the colonel’s bride, ‘you would"]]]
