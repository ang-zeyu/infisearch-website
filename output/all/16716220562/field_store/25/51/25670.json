All the gods came around to see. Then Loki came up to show his things.  He put the crown of gold on Sif's head and it began to grow like real hair.  He gave the spear to Odin and said, \"This spear will never miss its mark.\"  [Illustration: SIF WITH THE GOLDEN CROWN]  Then he took out the ship. He said, \"This is a wonderful ship. It will sail on any sea, and yet you can fold it up and put it into your pocket.\"  Loki felt very proud, for he thought his things were the best.         *       *       *       *       *            fold          sail            afraid           sorry         each            ring           shining       faster          gave  All the gods felt very sorry for little Brok. They thought Loki's things were fine. They were afraid Brok's would not be so nice.  [Illustration: BROK SHOWS HIS THINGS TO THE GODS.]  They said, \"Now, Brok, show your things.\"  Brok took out the gold ring. He said, \"Each night this ring will throw off a ring just like it. He gave the ring to Odin.\"  Then Brok took out the golden pig. He said, \"This pig can go anywhere, on the ground or in the air. It can go faster than any horse. If the night is dark, the shining pig will make it light.\"         *       *       *       *       *            frost         giants           turned        blowing  [Illustration: THOR WITH HIS HAMMER]  Then Brok showed the hammer. He said, \"This is not a very pretty hammer. When I was making it, Loki turned himself into a fly and made me spoil it. The fly bit me so hard that I had to stop blowing. So the handle is a little short. But it is a wonderful hammer. If you throw it at anything, it will hit the mark and come back to you.\"  The gods picked up the hammer and passed it around.  They said, \"It will be just the things with which to keep the Frost Giants out of Asgard.\"         *       *       *       *       *            touch         neck           without       way  The gods said, \"Brok's things are the best.\"  Brok gave the hammer to Thor. That is the way Thor got his wonderful hammer.  Then Brok said to Loki, \"You said I could have your head if my things were the best.\"  And Loki was angry and said, \"Yes, I told you that you could have my head. But you can't touch my neck.\"  Of course, Brok could not get his head without touching his neck.  So Brok did not get Loki's head.  [Illustration: THE FROST GIANT]     THE HAMMER LOST AND FOUND.             everything    planned  The Frost Giants did not like the sunshine. They did not like to see the flowers. They did not like to hear the birds sing. They wanted to spoil everything.  The Frost Giants wanted to get into Asgard. But they did not know how. They were afraid of Thor and his hammer. They said, \"If we can only get the hammer, we can get into Asgard.\"  They talked and planned all night. At last one Frost Giant said, \"I know how we can get the hammer. I will dress in a bird suit. Then I will fly up to Thor's house and get the hammer.\"  [Illustration: THE FROST GIANTS TALKED AND PLANNED ALL NIGHT.]         *       *       *       *       *            Freyja  The next night the Frost Giant flew into the house while Thor was asleep.  He took the hammer and flew away with it.  When Thor woke, he put out his hand to get the hammer. It was gone.  He said, \"Loki, the hammer is gone. The Frost Giants have taken it. We must get it back.\"  [Illustration: THE FROST GIANT FLEW INTO THE HOUSE WHILE THOR WAS ASLEEP.]  Loki said, \"I can get it back, if Freyja will let me have her falcon suit.\"  So he went to Freyja and said, \"Will you let me have your falcon suit? I can get the hammer back if you will.\" Freyja said, \"Yes, of course I will. If I had a gold suit you could have it. Any thing to get the hammer back.\"         *       *       *       *       *            people        city            Thrym           strange       buried          eight           miles         deep            falcon  Loki took the falcon suit and put it on. He flew over the city. All the people saw him flying. They said, \"What a strange bird!\" They did not know that it was Loki going for the hammer.  [Illustration: LOKI BORROWS THE FALCON SUIT.]  When Loki came to the city of the Frost Giants, he took off the falcon suit. He walked and walked until he came to Thrym's house. Thrym was the giant who took the hammer.  Thrym was sitting on the porch, making gold collars for his dogs.  When he saw Loki, he said, \"What do you want?\"  Loki said, \"I have come for the hammer.\"  The old giant laughed and said, \"You will never get that hammer. It is buried eight miles deep in the ground.  \"But there is one way you can get it. I will give you the hammer if you get Freyja for my wife.\"         *       *       *       *       *            clothes       shook           necklace  So Loki went back to Asgard.  Thor said, \"Well, did you get the hammer?\"  \"No, but we can get it if Freyja will be Thrym's wife.\"  Then they went to Freyja's house. They said, \"Put on your very best clothes and come with us. You must be Thrym's wife.\"  Freyja said, \"Do you think I will be the Frost Giant's wife? I won't be his wife.\"  Thor said, \"We can get the hammer back if you will.\"  But Freyja said, \"No, I will not be his wife.\"  Loki said, \"You will have to, if we get the hammer back.\"  Still Freyja said, \"I will not go.\" And she was very angry. She shook so hard that she broke her necklace and it fell to the floor.         *       *       *       *       *            bride         braided         wagon           vail          servant         goat  Then the gods said, \"Thor, you must dress like Freyja. You will have to play you are the bride.\"  Thor said, \"I won't do it. You will all laugh at me. I won't dress up like a girl.\"  They said, \"Well, that is the only way we can get the hammer back.\"  Thor said, \"I do not like to dress like a girl, but I will do it.\" Then they dressed Thor up like Freyja.  They put on Freyja's dress, necklace and vail, and braided his hair.  Loki said, \"I will dress up too, and be your servant.\"  They got into Thor's goat wagon and went to the Giants' home.  [Illustration: THOR AND LOKI APPROACH THE HOUSE OF THE GIANTS]         *       *       *       *       *            dinner        salmon          mead           whole         thirsty         barrels  When the Frost Giants saw them coming, they said, \"Get ready, here comes the bride! We will sit down to the table as soon as they come.\"  The dinner was ready on time. The table was full of good things. All sat down.  The bride ate a whole ox and eight salmon before the others had a bite.  \"She must be very hungry,\" the Frost Giants said.  \"Yes,\" Loki said, \"she was so glad to come. She hasn't eaten anything for eight days.\"  Then they brought in the mead.  [Illustration: THOR AND LOKI MET BY THRYM]  The bride drank three barrels of mead.  \"How thirsty she is!\" said the Frost Giants.  Loki said, \"Yes, she is very thirsty. She was so glad to come. She did not drink anything for eight days.\"         *       *       *       *       *            kiss          stepped         whirled           lifted        shone           lap  Old Thrym said, \"I had every thing I wanted but Freyja. Now I have Freyja.\"  And Thrym went to kiss the bride. He lifted her vail, but her eyes shone like fire.  [Illustration: THRYM PUTS THE HAMMER IN THOR'S LAP.]  [Illustration: THOR AND HIS HAMMER.]  Thrym stepped back. He said, \"What makes Freyja's eyes shine so?\"  Loki said, \"Oh, she was so glad to come. She did not sleep for eight nights.\"  Then Loki said, \"It is time for the hammer. Go and get it and put it in the bride's lap.\"  As soon as the hammer was in his lap, Thor tore off the vail.  He took the hammer and whirled it around. Fire flew from it. The fire burned the house and the Frost Giants ran away.  So Thor got his hammer back.     The following stories by Miss Smythe were originally published under the title of \"The Golden Fleece.\" They have been carefully revised and illustrated for this book.     THE STORY OF THE SHEEP.             ago           horns           fleece           king          Greece          loved           playing       Helle           grass           garden        catch           clouds  Long, long ago there lived a king in Greece. He had two little children, a boy and a girl.  They were good children and loved each other very much.  One day they were playing in the garden.  \"Oh, Helle, look!\" said the boy.  There on the grass was a fine large sheep. This sheep had a fleece of gold and his horns were gold, too.  [Illustration: THE KING AND HIS TWO CHILDREN.]  The children wanted to pat the sheep, but they could not catch him. When they went near, he ran away on the clouds.         *       *       *       *       *            grew          golden          hold           tame          ride            tight  Every day they played in the garden and every day the sheep came, too.  By and by he grew tame and let the children pat his golden fleece.  One day the boy said, \"Helle, let us take a ride.\"  First he helped his sister on the sheep's back.  Then he got on and held to the horns.  \"Hold tight to me, Helle,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *            sky           dizzy           sea           sister        land            dragon           lose          nailed          Colchis  The sheep went up, up into the sky, and ran a long way on the clouds. But Helle got dizzy and fell down into the sea.  The boy felt very bad to lose his sister, but went right on.  Then he came to the land Colchis. He killed the sheep and gave the golden fleece to the king.

[Illustration: THE SHEEP WENT UP INTO THE SKY AND RAN A LONG WAY ON THE CLOUDS]  By the tree was a dragon. The dragon never went to sleep. He would not let any one but the king come to the tree.  So no one could get the golden fleece.     THE GOOD SHIP ARGO.             across        untied          wade           Jason         brave           party           rained        creek           bridge           shoe-strings                  invited   Jason was a brave young man. He lived a little way from the king's city.  One day the king gave a big party and invited Jason.  It was a very dark night and it rained hard.  Jason had to go across a creek, but there was no bridge.  [Illustration: JASON COMES TO THE KING'S HOUSE.]  The creek was full of water and Jason had to wade.  One of his shoe-strings came untied and he lost his shoe in the water.  When he came to the king's house, he had but one shoe.         *       *       *       *       *            knew          bring           fight           wild          Argo            asked           animals       shoe            Argonauts  The king did not like this, for a fairy had said, \"The man who shall come to your house with one shoe, will be king.\"  So he knew Jason was to be king.  Then he said to Jason, \"You may be king when you bring me the golden fleece.\"  Jason was glad to go, and asked many brave men to go with him.  To get the golden fleece they would have to fight wild men and animals.  They made a big ship which they named \"Argo.\"  The men who went on the Argo were called Argonauts.     JASON AND THE HARPIES.             wings         blind           nobody           strong        iron            hard           skin          drive           claws           scratched     brass           Harpies  The ship Argo sailed a long way. There were two strong men on the ship. They had wings and could fly.  One day the Argo came to a land where the blind king lived.  This poor king had a hard time. When he sat down to the table to eat, some ugly birds called Harpies, came too. The Harpies had skin like brass and nobody could hurt them. They had claws of iron, and scratched people when they tried to drive them away.  When the king's dinner was ready, the Harpies came and took it away. When Jason and his men came, the king told them all about it. Jason said they would help him.         *       *       *       *       *            food          drowned         tired           swords        hurt            flying  They all sat down to the table. When the food was put on the table, the Harpies came flying in. Jason and his men took their swords.  [Illustration: JASON TRIES TO KILL THE HARPIES.]  They cut at the Harpies but could not hurt them.  Then the two men with wings flew up in the air. The Harpies were afraid and flew away. The men flew after them.  At last the Harpies grew very tired and fell into the sea and were drowned.  Then the men with wings came back.  Now the blind king could eat all he wanted.         *       *       *       *       *            thanked       rocks           moved           friends       helping         good-bye           over          apart           icebergs  It was now time for Jason and his friends to go away.  The king thanked them over and over again for helping him.  When they said good-bye, he told them how to get to the land where they would find the golden fleece.  On the sea where Jason and his men had to sail, were two big rocks. These rocks moved on the waterlike icebergs.  They were as high as a big hill. They would come close to each other, then they would go far apart.         *       *       *       *       *            fishes        pieces          dove           past          break           together           row           almost          rocks  When fishes swam in the water the rocks would come together and kill the fishes.  If birds flew in the air, the rocks would come together and kill birds.  If a boat sailed on the water, the rocks would come together and break the boat into little pieces.  These rocks had been put in the sea, so no one could go to the land where the golden fleece was.  When the ship Argo came to the rocks, Jason sent a dove out.  The rocks came together when the dove was almost past.  Then they went far apart. Jason made his men row as hard as they could.  The rocks began to come together. \"Row hard, my men,\" said Jason.  Just as they got past, the rocks hit, but Jason and his men were all right.  So they came to Colchis.     THE BRASS BULLS.             something     plow            bulls           stronger      chains          noses           mouths        smoke           plant           stone         flew            stall  When Jason came to Colchis, he went to the king and said, \"Will you give me the golden fleece?\"  The king wanted to keep the fleece.  So he said to Jason, \"You may have it, but you must do something for me first.\"  \"You must plow with the brass bulls, and plant the dragon's teeth.\"  The brass bulls looked like real bulls, but they were larger and stronger.  They blew out fire and smoke from their noses and mouths.  The bulls had a stall made of iron and stone. They had to be tied with strong iron chains.         *       *       *       *       *            daughter      Medea           carriage           snakes        through         pulled  When the dragon's teeth were planted, iron men grew up.  They always killed the one who had planted them.  The king wanted the bulls to kill Jason.  [Illustration: MEDEA GATHERS FLOWERS.]  He said, \"If the bulls do not kill him the iron men will.\"  The king had a daughter named Medea. She saw Jason was a brave young man and did not want him killed.  She knew how to help him. She stepped into her carriage, which was pulled by flying snakes.  Then Medea flew through the air. She went to hills and creeks and picked all kinds of flowers.  She took the flowers home and cooked them.         *       *       *       *       *            nothing       face            rub           juice         legs            cut  Then Medea went to Jason when the king did not know it.  She said to Jason, \"Rub your face and hands and legs with this juice.\"  [Illustration: MEDEA GIVES JASON THE JUICE.]  When he did this, he was as strong as a giant.  Nothing could hurt him then. Fire could not burn him, and swords could not cut him.  The next day Jason had to plow with the brass bulls and plant the dragon's teeth.         *       *       *       *       *            climbed       early           tied           princess      seats           hold           untied        opened          place  Early in the morning, the king and princess went out to the place.  They had good seats where they could see well.  All the people in the city came out to see Jason plow.  The little boys climbed the trees so they could see better.  Then Jason came to the place. The stall where the brass bulls were tied was not far off.  The door was opened and Jason went in.  He untied the bulls and took hold of their horns.  Then he made the bulls come out of their stall.         *       *       *       *       *            pushed        kicked          until  The bulls were very angry and blew fire and smoke from their mouths.  This made the cruel king glad. But the people who saw it were afraid. They did not want Jason killed. They did not know that the princess had helped him.  Jason pushed the bulls' heads down to the ground. Then they kicked at him with their feet, but could not hurt him.  He held their heads down on the ground until the plow was ready.         *       *       *       *       *            handle        slowly          noon           wheat         lie             just  Jason took the chains in one hand. He took the handle of the plow in the other.  The bulls jumped and wanted to run away.  But Jason held so hard they had to go very slowly.  When it was noon the ground was all plowed.  Then Jason let the bulls go.  They were so angry that they ran away to the woods.  Now Jason went to the king and said, \"Give me the dragon's teeth.\"  The king gave him his hat full.  Then Jason planted the dragon's teeth, just as a man plants wheat.  By this time he was very tired, so he went to lie down.  [Illustration: JASON SOWS THE DRAGON'S TEETH.]            evening       knees           marble           threw         growing         fight  In the evening he came back.  The iron men were growing up. Some of the men had only their feet in the ground.  Some of them were in the ground up to their knees.  Some had only their heads out. They all tried to get out so they could kill Jason.  Then Jason did what Medea told him he should do.  He took a giant's marble and threw it near the men.  All the iron men wanted to get the marble.  So they began to fight each other. As soon as one had his feet out of the ground, he cut at the man next to him. So they killed each other.  Then Jason took his sword and cut off all the heads that were out of the ground.  So all the iron men were killed and the king was very angry.  But Medea and the people were glad.     JASON AND THE DRAGON.             yourself      fond            father  The next day Jason went to the king and said, \"Now, give me the golden fleece.\"  The king did not give it to him, but said, \"Come again.\"  Then Medea said, \"If you want the golden fleece, you must help yourself. My father will not give it to you. A dragon is by the tree where the golden fleece is, and he never sleeps. He is always hungry and eats people if they go near him. I can not kill him but I can make him sleep. He is very fond of cake. I will make some cake and put in something to make the dragon sleep.\"         *       *       *       *       *            became        climbed         angry  So Medea made the cakes and Jason took them and threw them to the dragon.
