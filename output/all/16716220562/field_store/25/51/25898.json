The change had taken place almost overnight. The fact that the case had the appearance of presenting the unusual had merely stimulated him at first. But then doubts had crept in and the problem had begun to appear insoluble.  True, he had only just taken it up, but something told him that, for all the progress he was likely to make, he might just as well have been working on it steadily for a month. He was completely baffled. And every moment which he spent in the Excelsior Boarding-House made it clearer to him that that infernal old woman with the pale eyes thought him an incompetent fool. It was that, more than anything, which made him acutely conscious of his lack of success. His nerves were being sorely troubled by the quiet scorn of Mrs. Pickett's gaze. He began to think that perhaps he had been a shade too self-confident and abrupt in the short interview which he had had with her on his arrival.  As might have been expected, his first act, after his brief interview with Mrs. Pickett, was to examine the room where the tragedy had taken place. The body was gone, but otherwise nothing had been moved.  Oakes belonged to the magnifying-glass school of detection. The first thing he did on entering the room was to make a careful examination of the floor, the walls, the furniture, and the windowsill. He would have hotly denied the assertion that he did this because it looked well, but he would have been hard put to it to advance any other reason.  If he discovered anything, his discoveries were entirely negative, and served only to deepen the mystery of the case. As Mr. Snyder had said, there was no chimney, and nobody could have entered through the locked door.  There remained the window. It was small, and apprehensiveness, perhaps, of the possibility of burglars, had caused the proprietress to make it doubly secure with an iron bar. No human being could have squeezed his way through it.  It was late that night that he wrote and dispatched to headquarters the report which had amused Mr. Snyder.   V  Two days later Mr. Snyder sat at his desk, staring with wide, unbelieving eyes at a telegram he had just received. It read as follows:       HAVE SOLVED GUNNER MYSTERY. RETURNING.... OAKES.  Mr. Snyder narrowed his eyes and rang the bell. \"Send Mr. Oakes to me directly he arrives,\" he said.  He was pained to find that his chief emotion was one of bitter annoyance. The swift solution of such an apparently insoluble problem would reflect the highest credit on the Agency, and there were picturesque circumstances connected with the case which would make it popular with the newspapers and lead to its being given a great deal of publicity.  Yet, in spite of all this, Mr. Snyder was annoyed. He realized now how large a part the desire to reduce Oakes' self-esteem had played with him. He further realized, looking at the thing honestly, that he had been firmly convinced that the young man would not come within a mile of a reasonable solution of the mystery. He had desired only that his failure would prove a valuable educational experience for him. For he believed that failure at this particular point in his career would make Oakes a more valuable asset to the Agency. But now here Oakes was, within a ridiculously short space of time, returning to the fold, not humble and defeated, but triumphant. Mr. Snyder looked forward with apprehension to the young man's probable demeanor under the intoxicating influence of victory.  His apprehensions were well grounded. He had barely finished the third of the series of cigars, which, like milestones, marked the progress of his afternoon, when the door opened and young Oakes entered. Mr. Snyder could not repress a faint moan at the sight of him. One glance was enough to tell him that his worst fears were realised.  \"I got your telegram,\" said Mr. Snyder.  Oakes nodded. \"It surprised you, eh?\" he asked.  Mr. Snyder resented the patronizing tone of the question, but he had resigned himself to be patronized, and keep his anger in check.  \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I must say it did surprise me. I didn't gather from your report that you had even found a clue. Was it the Indian theory that turned the trick?\"  Oakes laughed tolerantly. \"Oh, I never really believed that preposterous theory for one moment. I just put it in to round out my report. I hadn't begun to think about the case then--not really think.\"  Mr. Snyder, nearly exploding with wrath, extended his cigar-case. \"Light up, and tell me all about it,\" he said, controlling his anger.  \"Well, I won't say I haven't earned this,\" said Oakes, puffing away. He let the ash of his cigar fall delicately to the floor--another action which seemed significant to his employer. As a rule, his assistants, unless particularly pleased with themselves, used the ashtray.  \"My first act on arriving,\" Oakes said, \"was to have a talk with Mrs. Pickett. A very dull old woman.\"  \"Curious. She struck me as rather intelligent.\"  \"Not on your life. She gave me no assistance whatever. I then examined the room where the death had taken place. It was exactly as you described it. There was no chimney, the door had been locked on the inside, and the one window was very high up. At first sight, it looked extremely unpromising. Then I had a chat with some of the other boarders. They had nothing of any importance to contribute. Most of them simply gibbered. I then gave up trying to get help from the outside, and resolved to rely on my own intelligence.\"  He smiled triumphantly. \"It is a theory of mine, Mr. Snyder, which I have found valuable that, in nine cases out of ten, remarkable things don't happen.\"  \"I don't quite follow you there,\" Mr. Snyder interrupted.  \"I will put it another way, if you like. What I mean is that the simplest explanation is nearly always the right one. Consider this case. It seemed impossible that there should have been any reasonable explanation of the man's death. Most men would have worn themselves out guessing at wild theories. If I had started to do that, I should have been guessing now. As it is--here I am. I trusted to my belief that nothing remarkable ever happens, and I won out.\"  Mr. Snyder sighed softly. Oakes was entitled to a certain amount of gloating, but there could be no doubt that his way of telling a story was downright infuriating.  \"I believe in the logical sequence of events. I refuse to accept effects unless they are preceded by causes. In other words, with all due respect to your possibly contrary opinions, Mr. Snyder, I simply decline to believe in a murder unless there was a motive for it. The first thing I set myself to ascertain was--what was the motive for the murder of Captain Gunner? And, after thinking it over and making every possible inquiry, I decided that there was no motive. Therefore, there was no murder.\"  Mr. Snyder's mouth opened, and he obviously was about to protest. But he appeared to think better of it and Oakes proceeded: \"I then tested the suicide theory. What motive was there for suicide? There was no motive. Therefore, there was no suicide.\"  This time Mr. Snyder spoke. \"You haven't been spending the last few days in the wrong house by any chance, have you? You will be telling me next that there wasn't any dead man.\"  Oakes smiled. \"Not at all. Captain John Gunner was dead, all right. As the medical evidence proved, he died of the bite of a cobra. It was a small cobra which came from Java.\"  Mr. Snyder stared at him. \"How do you know?\"  \"I do know, beyond any possibility of doubt.\"  \"Did you see the snake?\"  Oakes shook his head.  \"Then, how in heaven's name----\"  \"I have enough evidence to make a jury convict Mr. Snake without leaving the box.\"  \"Then suppose you tell me this. How did your cobra from Java get out of the room?\"  \"By the window,\" replied Oakes, impassively.  \"How can you possibly explain that? You say yourself that the window was high up.\"  \"Nevertheless, it got out by the window. The logical sequence of events is proof enough that it was in the room. It killed Captain Gunner there, and left traces of its presence outside. Therefore, as the window was the only exit, it must have escaped by that route. It may have climbed or it may have jumped, but somehow it got out of that window.\"  \"What do you mean--it left traces of its presence outside?\"  \"It killed a dog in the backyard behind the house,\" Oakes said. \"The window of Captain Gunner's room projects out over it. It is full of boxes and litter and there are a few stunted shrubs scattered about. In fact, there is enough cover to hide any small object like the body of a dog. That's why it was not discovered at first. The maid at the Excelsior came on it the morning after I sent you my report while she was emptying a box of ashes in the yard. It was just an ordinary stray dog without collar or license. The analyst examined the body, and found that the dog had died of the bite of a cobra.\"  \"But you didn't find the snake?\"  \"No. We cleaned out that yard till you could have eaten your breakfast there, but the snake had gone. It must have escaped through the door of the yard, which was standing ajar. That was a couple of days ago, and there has been no further tragedy. In all likelihood it is dead. The nights are pretty cold now, and it would probably have died of exposure.\"  \"But, I just don't understand how a cobra got to Southampton,\" said the amazed Mr. Snyder.  \"Can't you guess it? I told you it came from Java.\"  \"How did you know it did?\"  \"Captain Muller told me. Not directly, but I pieced it together from what he said. It seems that an old shipmate of Captain Gunner's was living in Java. They corresponded, and occasionally this man would send the captain a present as a mark of his esteem. The last present he sent was a crate of bananas. Unfortunately, the snake must have got in unnoticed. That's why I told you the cobra was a small one. Well, that's my case against Mr. Snake, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8176"],["title","Death at the Excelsior, and Other Stories (#3)"],["body","short of catching him with the goods, I don't see how I could have made out a stronger one. Don't you agree?\"  It went against the grain for Mr. Snyder to acknowledge defeat, but he was a fair-minded man, and he was forced to admit that Oakes did certainly seem to have solved the impossible.  \"I congratulate you, my boy,\" he said as heartily as he could. \"To be completely frank, when you started out, I didn't think you could do it. By the way, I suppose Mrs. Pickett was pleased?\"  \"If she was, she didn't show it. I'm pretty well convinced she hasn't enough sense to be pleased at anything. However, she has invited me to dinner with her tonight. I imagine she'll be as boring as usual, but she made such a point of it, I had to accept.\"   VI  For some time after Oakes had gone, Mr. Snyder sat smoking and thinking, in embittered meditation. Suddenly there was brought the card of Mrs. Pickett, who would be grateful if he could spare her a few moments. Mr. Snyder was glad to see Mrs. Pickett. He was a student of character, and she had interested him at their first meeting. There was something about her which had seemed to him unique, and he welcomed this second chance of studying her at close range.  She came in and sat down stiffly, balancing herself on the extreme edge of the chair in which a short while before young Oakes had lounged so luxuriously.  \"How are you, Mrs. Pickett?\" said Mr. Snyder genially. \"I'm very glad that you could find time to pay me a visit. Well, so it wasn't murder after all.\"  \"Sir?\"  \"I've just been talking to Mr. Oakes, whom you met as James Burton,\" said the detective. \"He has told me all about it.\"  \"He told _me_ all about it,\" said Mrs. Pickett dryly.  Mr. Snyder looked at her inquiringly. Her manner seemed more suggestive than her words.  \"A conceited, headstrong young fool,\" said Mrs. Pickett.  It was no new picture of his assistant that she had drawn. Mr. Snyder had often drawn it himself, but at the present juncture it surprised him. Oakes, in his hour of triumph, surely did not deserve this sweeping condemnation.  \"Did not Mr. Oakes' solution of the mystery satisfy you, Mrs. Pickett?\"  \"No!\"  \"It struck me as logical and convincing,\" Mr. Snyder said.  \"You may call it all the fancy names you please, Mr. Snyder. But Mr. Oakes' solution was not the right one.\"  \"Have you an alternative to offer?\"  Mrs. Pickett tightened her lips.  \"If you have, I should like to hear it.\"  \"You will--at the proper time.\"  \"What makes you so certain that Mr. Oakes is wrong?\"  \"He starts out with an impossible explanation, and rests his whole case on it. There couldn't have been a snake in that room because it couldn't have gotten out. The window was too high.\"  \"But surely the evidence of the dead dog?\"  Mrs. Pickett looked at him as if he had disappointed her. \"I had always heard _you_ spoken of as a man with common sense, Mr. Snyder.\"  \"I have always tried to use common sense.\"  \"Then why are you trying now to make yourself believe that something happened which could not possibly have happened just because it fits in with something which isn't easy to explain?\"  \"You mean that there is another explanation of the dead dog?\" Mr. Snyder asked.  \"Not _another_. What Mr. Oakes takes for granted is not an explanation. But there is a common sense explanation, and if he had not been so headstrong and conceited he might have found it.\"  \"You speak as if you had found it,\" chided Mr. Snyder.  \"I have.\" Mrs. Pickett leaned forward as she spoke, and stared at him defiantly.  Mr. Snyder started. \"_You_ have?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"You will know before tomorrow. In the meantime try and think it out for yourself. A successful and prosperous detective agency like yours, Mr. Snyder, ought to do something in return for a fee.\"  There was something in her manner so reminiscent of the school teacher reprimanding a recalcitrant pupil that Mr. Snyder's sense of humor came to his rescue. \"We do our best, Mrs. Pickett,\" he said. \"But you mustn't forget that we are only human and cannot guarantee results.\"  Mrs. Pickett did not pursue the subject. Instead, she proceeded to astonish Mr. Snyder by asking him to swear out a warrant for the arrest of a man known to them both on a charge of murder.  Mr. Snyder's breath was not often taken away in his own office. As a rule, he received his clients' communications calmly, strange as they often were. But at her words he gasped. The thought crossed his mind that Mrs. Pickett might well be mentally unbalanced. The details of the case were fresh in his memory, and he distinctly recollected that the person she mentioned had been away from the boarding house on the night of Captain Gunner's death, and could, he imagined, produce witnesses to prove it.  Mrs. Pickett was regarding him with an unfaltering stare. To all outward appearances, she was the opposite of unbalanced.  \"But you can't swear out a warrant without evidence,\" he told her.  \"I have evidence,\" she replied firmly.  \"Precisely what kind of evidence?\" he demanded.  \"If I told you now you would think that I was out of my mind.\"  \"But, Mrs. Pickett, do you realize what you are asking me to do? I cannot make this agency responsible for the arbitrary arrest of a man on the strength of a single individual's suspicions. It might ruin me. At the least it would make me a laughing stock.\"  \"Mr. Snyder, you may use your own judgment whether or not to make the arrest on that warrant. You will listen to what I have to say, and you will see for yourself how the crime was committed. If after that you feel that you cannot make the arrest I will accept your decision. I know who killed Captain Gunner,\" she said. \"I knew it from the beginning. It was like a vision. But I had no proof. Now things have come to light and everything is clear.\"  Against his judgment, Mr. Snyder was impressed. This woman had the magnetism which makes for persuasiveness.  \"It--it sounds incredible.\" Even as he spoke, he remembered that it had long been a professional maxim of his that nothing was incredible, and he weakened still further.  \"Mr. Snyder, I ask you to swear out that warrant.\"  The detective gave in. \"Very well,\" he said.  Mrs. Pickett rose. \"If you will come and dine at my house to-night I think I can prove to you that it will be needed. Will you come?\"  \"I'll come,\" promised Mr. Snyder.   VII  When Mr. Snyder arrived at the Excelsior and shortly after he was shown into the little private sitting room where he found Oakes, the third guest of the evening unexpectedly arrived.  Mr. Snyder looked curiously at the newcomer. Captain Muller had a peculiar fascination for him. It was not Mr. Snyder's habit to trust overmuch to appearances. But he could not help admitting that there was something about this man's aspect which brought Mrs. Pickett's charges out of the realm of the fantastic into that of the possible. There was something odd--an unnatural aspect of gloom--about the man. He bore himself like one carrying a heavy burden. His eyes were dull, his face haggard. The next moment the detective was reproaching himself with allowing his imagination to run away with his calmer judgment.  The door opened, and Mrs. Pickett came in. She made no apology for her lateness.  To Mr. Snyder one of the most remarkable points about the dinner was the peculiar metamorphosis of Mrs. Pickett from the brooding silent woman he had known to the gracious and considerate hostess.  Oakes appeared also to be overcome with surprise, so much so that he was unable to keep his astonishment to himself. He had come prepared to endure a dull evening absorbed in grim silence, and he found himself instead opposite a bottle of champagne of a brand and year which commanded his utmost respect. What was even more incredible, his hostess had transformed herself into a pleasant old lady whose only aim seemed to be to make him feel at home.  Beside each of the guests' plates was a neat paper parcel. Oakes picked his up, and stared at it in wonderment. \"Why, this is more than a party souvenir, Mrs. Pickett,\" he said. \"It's the kind of mechanical marvel I've always wanted to have on my desk.\"  \"I'm glad you like it, Mr. Oakes,\" Mrs. Pickett said, smiling. \"You must not think of me simply as a tired old woman whom age has completely defeated. I am an ambitious hostess. When I give these little parties, I like to make them a success. I want each of you to remember this dinner.\"  \"I'm sure I will.\"  Mrs. Pickett smiled again. \"I think you all will. You, Mr. Snyder.\" She paused. \"And you, Captain Muller.\"  To Mr. Snyder there was so much meaning in her voice as she said this that he was amazed that it conveyed no warning to Muller. Captain Muller, however, was already drinking heavily. He looked up when addressed and uttered a sound which might have been taken for an expression of polite acquiescence. Then he filled his glass again.  Mr. Snyder's parcel revealed a watch-charm fashioned in the shape of a tiny, candid-eye camera. \"That,\" said Mrs. Pickett, \"is a compliment to your profession.\" She leaned toward the captain. \"Mr. Snyder is a detective, Captain Muller.\"  He looked up. It seemed to Mr. Snyder that a look of fear lit up his heavy eyes for an instant. It came and went, if indeed it came at all, so swiftly that he could not be certain.  \"So?\" said Captain Muller. He spoke quite evenly, with just the amount of interest which such an announcement would naturally produce.  \"Now for yours, Captain,\" said Oakes. \"I guess it's something special. It's twice the size of mine, anyway.\"  It may have been something in the old woman's expression as she watched Captain Muller slowly tearing the paper that sent a thrill of excitement through Mr. Snyder. Something seemed to warn him of the approach of a psychological moment. He bent forward eagerly.  There was a strangled gasp, a thump, and onto the table from the captain's hands there fell a little harmonica. There was no mistaking the look on"]]]
