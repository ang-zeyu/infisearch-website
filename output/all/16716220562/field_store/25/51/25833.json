The others run off, except Drummer Boy, who   is driven off by Don Alhambra.)         DON AL.  Good evening.  Fancy ball?        GIU.  No, not exactly.  A little friendly dance.  That's   all.  Sorry you're late.        DON AL.  But I saw a groom dancing, and a footman!        MAR.  Yes.  That's the Lord High Footman.        DON AL.  And, dear me, a common little drummer boy!        GIU.  Oh no!  That's the Lord High Drummer Boy.        DON AL.  But surely, surely the servants'-hall is the place   for these gentry?        GIU.  Oh dear no!  We have appropriated the servants'-hall.   It's the Royal Apartment, and accessible only by tickets   obtainable at the Lord Chamberlain's office.        MAR.  We really must have some place that we can call our   own.        DON AL. (puzzled).  I'm afraid I'm not quite equal to the   intellectual pressure of the conversation.        GIU.  You see, the Monarchy has been re-modelled on   Republican principles.        DON AL.  What!        GIU.  All departments rank equally, and everybody is at the   head of his department.        DON AL.  I see.        MAR.  I'm afraid you're annoyed.        DON AL.  No.  I won't say that.  It's not quite what I   expected.        GIU.  I'm awfully sorry.        MAR.  So am I.        GIU.  By the by, can I offer you anything after your voyage?   A plate of macaroni and a rusk?        DON AL. (preoccupied).  No, no—nothing—nothing.        GIU.  Obliged to be careful?        DON AL.  Yes—gout.  You see, in every Court there are   distinctions that must be observed.        GIU. (puzzled).  There are, are there?        DON AL.  Why, of course.  For instance, you wouldn't have a   Lord High Chancellor play leapfrog with his own cook.        MAR.  Why not?        DON AL.  Why not!  Because a Lord High Chancellor is a   personage of great dignity, who should never, under any   circumstances, place himself in the position of being told to   tuck in his tuppenny, except by noblemen of his own rank.  A Lord   High Archbishop, for instance, might tell a Lord High Chancellor   to tuck in his tuppenny, but certainly not a cook, gentlemen,   certainly not a cook.        GIU.  Not even a Lord High Cook?        DON AL.  My good friend, that is a rank that is not   recognized at the Lord Chamberlain's office.  No, no, it won't   do.  I'll give you an instance in which the experiment was tried.              SONG—DON ALHAMBRA, with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.    DON AL.   There lived a King, as I've been told,             In the wonder-working days of old,             When hearts were twice as good as gold,                  And twenty times as mellow.             Good-temper triumphed in his face,             And in his heart he found a place             For all the erring human race                  And every wretched fellow.             When he had Rhenish wine to drink             It made him very sad to think             That some, at junket or at jink,                  Must be content with toddy.    MAR. and GIU.  With toddy, must be content with toddy.    DON AL.   He wished all men as rich as he             (And he was rich as rich could be),             So to the top of every tree                  Promoted everybody.    MAR. and GIU.  Now, that's the kind of King for me.             He wished all men as rich as he,             So to the top of every tree                  Promoted everybody!    DON AL.   Lord Chancellors were cheap as sprats,             And Bishops in their shovel hats             Were plentiful as tabby cats—                  In point of fact, too many.             Ambassadors cropped up like hay,             Prime Ministers and such as they             Grew like asparagus in May,                  And Dukes were three a penny.             On every side Field-Marshals gleamed,             Small beer were Lords-Lieutenant deemed,             With Admirals the ocean teemed                  All round his wide dominions.    MAR. and GIU.  With Admirals all round his wide dominions.    DON AL.   And Party Leaders you might meet             In twos and threes in every street             Maintaining, with no little heat,                  Their various opinions.    MAR. and GIU.  Now that's a sight you couldn't beat—             Two Party Leaders in each street             Maintaining, with no little heat,                  Their various opinions.    DON AL.   That King, although no one denies             His heart was of abnormal size,             Yet he'd have acted otherwise                  If he had been acuter.             The end is easily foretold,             When every blessed thing you hold             Is made of silver, or of gold,                  You long for simple pewter.             When you have nothing else to wear             But cloth of gold and satins rare,             For cloth of gold you cease to care—                  Up goes the price of shoddy.    MAR. and GIU.  Of shoddy, up goes the price of shoddy.    DON AL.   In short, whoever you may be,             To this conclusion you'll agree,             When every one is somebodee,                  Then no one's anybody!    MAR. and GIU.  Now that's as plain as plain can be,             To this conclusion we agree—    ALL.      When every one is somebodee,                  Then no one's anybody!    (Gianetta and Tessa enter unobserved.  The two girls, impelled by   curiosity, remain listening at the back of the stage.)         DON AL.  And now I have some important news to communicate.   His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Her Grace the Duchess, and   their beautiful daughter Casilda—I say their beautiful daughter   Casilda—        GIU.  We heard you.        DON AL.  Have arrived at Barataria, and may be here at any   moment.        MAR.  The Duke and Duchess are nothing to us.        DON AL.  But the daughter—the beautiful daughter!  Aha!   Oh, you're a lucky dog, one of you!        GIU.  I think you're a very incomprehensible old gentleman.        DON AL.  Not a bit—I'll explain.  Many years ago when you   (whichever you are) were a baby, you (whichever you are) were   married to a little girl who has grown up to be the most   beautiful young lady in Spain.  That beautiful young lady will be   here to claim you (whichever you are) in half an hour, and I   congratulate that one (whichever it is) with all my heart.        MAR.  Married when a baby!        GIU.  But we were married three months ago!        DON AL.  One of you—only one.  The other (whichever it is)   is an unintentional bigamist.        GIA. and TESS. (coming forward).  Well, upon my word!        DON AL.  Eh?  Who are these young people?        TESS.  Who are we?  Why, their wives, of course.  We've just   arrived.        DON AL.  Their wives!  Oh dear, this is very unfortunate!   Oh dear, this complicates matters!  Dear, dear, what will Her   Majesty say?        GIA.  And do you mean to say that one of these Monarchs was   already married?        TESS.  And that neither of us will be a Queen?        DON AL.  That is the idea I intended to convey.  (Tessa and   Gianetta begin to cry.)        GIU. (to Tessa).  Tessa, my dear, dear child—        TESS.  Get away! perhaps it's you!        MAR. (to Gia.).  My poor, poor little woman!        GIA.  Don't!  Who knows whose husband you are?        TESS.  And pray, why didn't you tell us all about it before   they left Venice?        DON AL.  Because, if I had, no earthly temptation would have   induced these gentlemen to leave two such extremely fascinating   and utterly irresistible little ladies!        TESS.  There's something in that.        DON AL.  I may mention that you will not be kept long in   suspense, as the old lady who nursed the Royal child is at   present in the torture chamber, waiting for me to interview her.        GIU.  Poor old girl.  Hadn't you better go and put her out   of her suspense?        DON AL.  Oh no—there's no hurry—she's all right.  She has   all the illustrated papers.  However, I'll go and interrogate   her, and, in the meantime, may I suggest the absolute propriety   of your regarding yourselves as single young ladies.  Good   evening!                                                        (Exit Don   Alhambra.)        GIA.  Well, here's a pleasant state of things!        MAR.  Delightful.  One of us is married to two young ladies,   and nobody knows which; and the other is married to one young   lady whom nobody can identify!        GIA.  And one of us is married to one of you, and the other   is married to nobody.        TESS.  But which of you is married to which of us, and   what's to become of the other?  (About to cry.)        GIU.  It's quite simple.  Observe.  Two husbands have   managed to acquire three wives.  Three wives—two husbands.   (Reckoning up.)  That's two-thirds of a husband to each wife.        TESS.  O Mount Vesuvius, here we are in arithmetic!  My good   sir, one can't marry a vulgar fraction!        GIU.  You've no right to call me a vulgar fraction.        MAR.  We are getting rather mixed.  The situation is   entangled.  Let's try and comb it out.               QUARTET—MARCO, GIUSEPPE, GIANETTA, TESSA.                   In a contemplative fashion,                       And a tranquil frame of mind,                  Free from every kind of passion,                       Some solution let us find.                  Let us grasp the situation,                       Solve the complicated plot—                  Quiet, calm deliberation                       Disentangles every knot.    TESS.I, no doubt, Giuseppe wedded—          THE OTHERS.    In a   contemplative             That's, of course, a slice of luck           fashion,   etc.        He is rather dunder-headed.             Still distinctly, he's a duck.    GIA. I, a victim, too, of Cupid,             THE OTHERS.    Let   us grasp the             Marco married - that is clear.               situation,   etc.        He's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],["title","The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#8)"],["body","stupid,             Still distinctly, he's a dear.    MAR. To Gianetta I was mated;           THE OTHERS.    In a   contemplative             I can prove it in a trice:                   fashion,   etc.        Though her charms are overrated,             Still I own she's rather nice.    GIU.

Let us   grasp the             All at once a victim fell.                   situation,   etc.        She is what is called a silly,             Still she answers pretty well.    MAR.           Now when we were pretty babies                       Some one married us, that's clear—    GIA.                     And if I can catch her                            I'll pinch her and scratch her                       And send her away with a flea in her ear.    GIU.           He whom that young lady married,                       To receive her can't refuse.    TESS.                    If I overtake her                            I'll warrant I'll make her                       To shake in her aristocratical shoes!    GIA. (to Tess.).    If she married your Giuseppe                       You and he will have to part—    TESS. (to Gia.).    If I have to do it                       I'll warrant she'll rue it—                  I'll teach her to marry the man of my heart!    TESS. (to Gia.).    If she married Messer Marco                       You're a spinster, that is plain—    GIA. (to Tess.).    No matter—no matter.                       If I can get at her                  I doubt if her mother will know her again!    ALL.      Quiet, calm deliberation                  Disentangles every knot!                                                         (Exeunt,   pondering.)    (March.  Enter procession of Retainers, heralding approach of   Duke, Duchess, and Casilda.  All three are now dressed with the   utmost magnificence.)                 CHORUS OF MEN, with DUKE and DUCHESS.                   With ducal pomp and ducal pride                       (Announce these comers,                       O ye kettle-drummers!)                  Comes Barataria's high-born bride.                       (Ye sounding cymbals clang!)                  She comes to claim the Royal hand—                       (Proclaim their Graces,                       O ye double basses!)                  Of the King who rules this goodly land.                       (Ye brazen brasses bang!)    DUKE and       This polite attention touches   DUCH.          Heart of Duke and heart of Duchess                       Who resign their pet                       With profound regret.                  She of beauty was a model                  When a tiny tiddle-toddle,                       And at twenty-one                       She's excelled by none!    CHORUS.        With ducal pomp and ducal pride, etc.    DUKE (to his attendants).  Be good enough to inform His Majesty   that His Grace the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Limited, has arrived, and   begs—        CAS.  Desires—        DUCH.  Demands—        DUKE.  And demands an audience.  (Exeunt attendants.)  And   now, my child, prepare to receive the husband to whom you were   united under such interesting and romantic circumstances.        CAS.  But which is it?  There are two of them!        DUKE.  It is true that at present His Majesty is a double   gentleman; but as soon as the circumstances of his marriage are   ascertained, he will, ipso facto, boil down to a single   gentleman—thus presenting a unique example of an individual who   becomes a single man and a married man by the same operation.        DUCH. (severely).  I have known instances in which the   characteristics of both conditions existed concurrently in the   same individual.        DUKE.  Ah, he couldn't have been a Plaza-Toro.        DUCH.  Oh! couldn't he, though!        CAS.  Well, whatever happens, I shall, of course, be a   dutiful wife, but I can never love my husband.        DUKE.  I don't know.  It's extraordinary what   unprepossessing people one can love if one gives one's mind to   it.        DUCH.  I loved your father.        DUKE.  My love—that remark is a little hard, I think?   Rather cruel, perhaps?  Somewhat uncalled-for, I venture to   believe?        DUCH.  It was very difficult, my dear; but I said to myself,   \"That man is a Duke, and I will love him.\"  Several of my   relations bet me I couldn't, but I did—desperately!                             SONG—DUCHESS.                   On the day when I was wedded                       To your admirable sire,                  I acknowledge that I dreaded                       An explosion of his ire.                  I was overcome with panic—                  For his temper was volcanic,                       And I didn't dare revolt,                       For I feared a thunderbolt!                  I was always very wary,                       For his fury was ecstatic—                  His refined vocabulary                       Most unpleasantly emphatic.                            To the thunder                                 Of this Tartar                            I knocked under                                 Like a martyr;                            When intently                                 He was fuming,                            I was gently                                 Unassuming—                            When reviling                                 Me completely,                            I was smiling                                 Very sweetly:   Giving him the very best, and getting back the very worst—   That is how I tried to tame your great progenitor—at first!                  But I found that a reliance                       On my threatening appearance,                  And a resolute defiance                       Of marital interference,                  And a gentle intimation                  Of my firm determination                       To see what I could do                       To be wife and husband too                  Was the only thing required                       For to make his temper supple,                  And you couldn't have desired                       A more reciprocating couple.                            Ever willing                                 To be wooing,                            We were billing—                                 We were cooing;                            When I merely                                 From him parted,                            We were nearly                                 Broken-hearted—                            When in sequel                                 Reunited,                            We were equal-                                 Ly delighted.   So with double-shotted guns and colours nailed unto the mast,   I tamed your insignificant progenitor—at last!         CAS.  My only hope is that when my husband sees what a shady   family he has married into he will repudiate the contract   altogether.        DUKE.  Shady?  A nobleman shady, who is blazing in the   lustre of unaccustomed pocket-money?  A nobleman shady, who can   look back upon ninety-five quarterings?  It is not every nobleman   who is ninety-five quarters in arrear—I mean, who can look back   upon ninety-five of them!  And this, just as I have been floated   at a premium!  Oh fie!        DUCH.  Your Majesty is surely unaware that directly your   Majesty's father came before the public he was applied for over   and over again.        DUKE.  My dear, Her Majesty's father was in the habit of   being applied for over and over again—and very urgently applied   for, too—long before he was registered under the Limited   Liability Act.                            RECITATIVE—DUKE.
