He walked straight into the sitting-room, the biggest feat since Daniel and the lions’ den, without a quiver. What’s more, his magnetism or whatever they call it was such that the dashed animal, instead of pinning him by the leg, calmed down as if he had had a bromide, and rolled over on his back with all his paws in the air. If Jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldn’t have been more chummy. Yet directly he caught sight of me again, he got all worked up and seemed to have only one idea in life—to start chewing me where he had left off.  “Rollo is not used to you yet, sir,” said Jeeves, regarding the bally quadruped in an admiring sort of way. “He is an excellent watchdog.”  “I don’t want a watchdog to keep me out of my rooms.”  “No, sir.”  “Well, what am I to do?”  “No doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate, sir. He will learn to distinguish your peculiar scent.”  “What do you mean—my peculiar scent? Correct the impression that I intend to hang about in the hall while life slips by, in the hope that one of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell all right.” I thought for a bit. “Jeeves!”  “Sir?”  “I’m going away—to-morrow morning by the first train. I shall go and stop with Mr. Todd in the country.”  “Do you wish me to accompany you, sir?”  “No.”  “Very good, sir.”  “I don’t know when I shall be back. Forward my letters.”  “Yes, sir.”  As a matter of fact, I was back within the week. Rocky Todd, the pal I went to stay with, is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone in the wilds of Long Island, and likes it; but a little of that sort of thing goes a long way with me. Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after a few days in his cottage in the woods, miles away from anywhere, New York, even with Motty on the premises, began to look pretty good to me. The days down on Long Island have forty-eight hours in them; you can’t get to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets; and you have to walk two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper. I thanked Rocky for his kind hospitality, and caught the only train they have down in those parts. It landed me in New York about dinner-time. I went straight to the old flat. Jeeves came out of his lair. I looked round cautiously for Rollo.  “Where’s that dog, Jeeves? Have you got him tied up?”  “The animal is no longer here, sir. His lordship gave him to the porter, who sold him. His lordship took a prejudice against the animal on account of being bitten by him in the calf of the leg.”  I don’t think I’ve ever been so bucked by a bit of news. I felt I had misjudged Rollo. Evidently, when you got to know him better, he had a lot of intelligence in him.  “Ripping!” I said. “Is Lord Pershore in, Jeeves?”  “No, sir.”  “Do you expect him back to dinner?”  “No, sir.”  “Where is he?”  “In prison, sir.”  Have you ever trodden on a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you? That’s how I felt then.  “In prison!”  “Yes, sir.”  “You don’t mean—in prison?”  “Yes, sir.”  I lowered myself into a chair.  “Why?” I said.  “He assaulted a constable, sir.”  “Lord Pershore assaulted a constable!”  “Yes, sir.”  I digested this.  “But, Jeeves, I say! This is frightful!”  “Sir?”  “What will Lady Malvern say when she finds out?”  “I do not fancy that her ladyship will find out, sir.”  “But she’ll come back and want to know where he is.”  “I rather fancy, sir, that his lordship’s bit of time will have run out by then.”  “But supposing it hasn’t?”  “In that event, sir, it may be judicious to prevaricate a little.”  “How?”  “If I might make the suggestion, sir, I should inform her ladyship that his lordship has left for a short visit to Boston.”  “Why Boston?”  “Very interesting and respectable centre, sir.”  “Jeeves, I believe you’ve hit it.”  “I fancy so, sir.”  “Why, this is really the best thing that could have happened. If this hadn’t turned up to prevent him, young Motty would have been in a sanatorium by the time Lady Malvern got back.”  “Exactly, sir.”  The more I looked at it in that way, the sounder this prison wheeze seemed to me. There was no doubt in the world that prison was just what the doctor ordered for Motty. It was the only thing that could have pulled him up. I was sorry for the poor blighter, but, after all, I reflected, a chappie who had lived all his life with Lady Malvern, in a small village in the interior of Shropshire, wouldn’t have much to kick at in a prison. Altogether, I began to feel absolutely braced again. Life became like what the poet Johnnie says—one grand, sweet song. Things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks that I give you my word that I’d almost forgotten such a person as Motty existed. The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves was still pained and distant. It wasn’t anything he said or did, mind you, but there was a rummy something about him all the time. Once when I was tying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass. There was a kind of grieved look in his eye.  And then Lady Malvern came back, a good bit ahead of schedule. I hadn’t been expecting her for days. I’d forgotten how time had been slipping along. She turned up one morning while I was still in bed sipping tea and thinking of this and that. Jeeves flowed in with the announcement that he had just loosed her into the sitting-room. I draped a few garments round me and went in.  There she was, sitting in the same arm-chair, looking as massive as ever. The only difference was that she didn’t uncover the teeth, as she had done the first time.  “Good morning,” I said. “So you’ve got back, what?”  “I have got back.”  There was something sort of bleak about her tone, rather as if she had swallowed an east wind. This I took to be due to the fact that she probably hadn’t breakfasted. It’s only after a bit of breakfast that I’m able to regard the world with that sunny cheeriness which makes a fellow the universal favourite. I’m never much of a lad till I’ve engulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee.  “I suppose you haven’t breakfasted?”  “I have not yet breakfasted.”  “Won’t you have an egg or something? Or a sausage or something? Or something?”  “No, thank you.”  She spoke as if she belonged to an anti-sausage society or a league for the suppression of eggs. There was a bit of a silence.  “I called on you last night,” she said, “but you were out.”  “Awfully sorry! Had a pleasant trip?”  “Extremely, thank you.”  “See everything? Niag’ra Falls, Yellowstone Park, and the jolly old Grand Canyon, and what-not?”  “I saw a great deal.”  There was another slightly _frappé_ silence. Jeeves floated silently into the dining-room and began to lay the breakfast-table.  “I hope Wilmot was not in your way, Mr. Wooster?”  I had been wondering when she was going to mention Motty.  “Rather not! Great pals! Hit it off splendidly.”  “You were his constant companion, then?”  “Absolutely! We were always together. Saw all the sights, don’t you know. We’d take in the Museum of Art in the morning, and have a bit of lunch at some good vegetarian place, and then toddle along to a sacred concert in the afternoon, and home to an early dinner. We usually played dominoes after dinner. And then the early bed and the refreshing sleep. We had a great time. I was awfully sorry when he went away to Boston.”  “Oh! Wilmot is in Boston?”  “Yes. I ought to have let you know, but of course we didn’t know where you were. You were dodging all over the place like a snipe—I mean, don’t you know, dodging all over the place, and we couldn’t get at you. Yes, Motty went off to Boston.”  “You’re sure he went to Boston?”  “Oh, absolutely.” I called out to Jeeves, who was now messing about in the next room with forks and so forth: “Jeeves, Lord Pershore didn’t change his mind about going to Boston, did he?”  “No, sir.”  “I thought I was right. Yes, Motty went to Boston.”  “Then how do you account, Mr. Wooster, for the fact that when I went yesterday afternoon to Blackwell’s Island prison, to secure material for my book, I saw poor, dear Wilmot there, dressed in a striped suit, seated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands?”  I tried to think of something to say, but nothing came. A chappie has to be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt like this. I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collar and the hair parting nothing stirred. I was dumb. Which was lucky, because I wouldn’t have had a chance to get any persiflage out of my system. Lady Malvern collared the conversation. She had been bottling it up, and now it came out with a rush:  “So this is how you have looked after my poor, dear boy, Mr. Wooster! So this is how you have abused my trust! I left him in your charge, thinking that I could rely on you to shield him from evil. He came to you innocent, unversed in the ways of the world, confiding, unused to the temptations of a large city, and you led him astray!”  I hadn’t any remarks to make. All I could think of was the picture of Aunt Agatha drinking all this in and reaching out to sharpen the hatchet against my return.  “You deliberately——”  Far away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke:  “If I might explain, your ladyship.”  Jeeves had projected himself in from the dining-room and materialized on the rug. Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look, but you can’t do that sort of thing to Jeeves. He is look-proof.  “I fancy, your ladyship, that you have misunderstood Mr. Wooster, and that he may have given you the impression that he was in New York when his lordship—was removed. When Mr. Wooster informed your ladyship that his lordship had gone to Boston, he was relying on the version I had given him of his lordship’s movements. Mr. Wooster was away, visiting a friend in the country, at the time, and knew nothing of the matter till your ladyship informed him.”  Lady Malvern gave a kind of grunt. It didn’t rattle Jeeves.  “I feared Mr. Wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164"],["title","My Man Jeeves (#7)"],["body","he is so attached to his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him, so I took the liberty of telling him that his lordship had gone away for a visit. It might have been hard for Mr. Wooster to believe that his lordship had gone to prison voluntarily and from the best motives, but your ladyship, knowing him better, will readily understand.”  “What!” Lady Malvern goggled at him. “Did you say that Lord Pershore went to prison voluntarily?”  “If I might explain, your ladyship. I think that your ladyship’s parting words made a deep impression on his lordship. I have frequently heard him speak to Mr. Wooster of his desire to do something to follow your ladyship’s instructions and collect material for your ladyship’s book on America. Mr. Wooster will bear me out when I say that his lordship was frequently extremely depressed at the thought that he was doing so little to help.”  “Absolutely, by Jove! Quite pipped about it!” I said.  “The idea of making a personal examination into the prison system of the country—from within—occurred to his lordship very suddenly one night. He embraced it eagerly. There was no restraining him.”  Lady Malvern looked at Jeeves, then at me, then at Jeeves again. I could see her struggling with the thing.  “Surely, your ladyship,” said Jeeves, “it is more reasonable to suppose that a gentleman of his lordship’s character went to prison of his own volition than that he committed some breach of the law which necessitated his arrest?”  Lady Malvern blinked. Then she got up.  “Mr. Wooster,” she said, “I apologize. I have done you an injustice. I should have known Wilmot better. I should have had more faith in his pure, fine spirit.”  “Absolutely!” I said.  “Your breakfast is ready, sir,” said Jeeves.  I sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of way with a poached egg.  “Jeeves,” I said, “you are certainly a life-saver!”  “Thank you, sir.”  “Nothing would have convinced my Aunt Agatha that I hadn’t lured that blighter into riotous living.”  “I fancy you are right, sir.”  I champed my egg for a bit. I was most awfully moved, don’t you know, by the way Jeeves had rallied round. Something seemed to tell me that this was an occasion that called for rich rewards. For a moment I hesitated. Then I made up my mind.  “Jeeves!”  “Sir?”  “That pink tie!”  “Yes, sir?”  “Burn it!”  “Thank you, sir.”  “And, Jeeves!”  “Yes, sir?”  “Take a taxi and get me that Longacre hat, as worn by John Drew!”  “Thank you very much, sir.”  I felt most awfully braced. I felt as if the clouds had rolled away and all was as it used to be. I felt like one of those chappies in the novels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter and decides to forget and forgive. I felt I wanted to do all sorts of other things to show Jeeves that I appreciated him.  “Jeeves,” I said, “it isn’t enough. Is there anything else you would like?”  “Yes, sir. If I may make the suggestion—fifty dollars.”  “Fifty dollars?”  “It will enable me to pay a debt of honour, sir. I owe it to his lordship.”  “You owe Lord Pershore fifty dollars?”  “Yes, sir. I happened to meet him in the street the night his lordship was arrested. I had been thinking a good deal about the most suitable method of inducing him to abandon his mode of living, sir. His lordship was a little over-excited at the time and I fancy that he mistook me for a friend of his. At any rate when I took the liberty of wagering him fifty dollars that he would not punch a passing policeman in the eye, he accepted the bet very cordially and won it.”  I produced my pocket-book and counted out a hundred.  “Take this, Jeeves,” I said; “fifty isn’t enough. Do you know, Jeeves, you’re—well, you absolutely stand alone!”  “I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir,” said Jeeves.     JEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGG   Sometimes of a morning, as I’ve sat in bed sucking down the early cup of tea and watched my man Jeeves flitting about the room and putting out the raiment for the day, I’ve wondered what the deuce I should do if the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me. It’s not so bad now I’m in New York, but in London the anxiety was frightful. There used to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneak him away from me. Young Reggie Foljambe to my certain knowledge offered him double what I was giving him, and Alistair Bingham-Reeves, who’s got a valet who had been known to press his trousers sideways, used to look at him, when he came to see me, with a kind of glittering hungry eye which disturbed me deucedly. Bally pirates!  The thing, you see, is that Jeeves is so dashed competent. You can spot it even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt.  I rely on him absolutely in every crisis, and he never lets me down. And, what’s more, he can always be counted on to extend himself on behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearances knee-deep in the bouillon. Take the rather rummy case, for instance, of dear old Bicky and his uncle, the hard-boiled egg.  It happened after I had been in America for a few months. I got back to the flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drink he said:  “Mr. Bickersteth called to see you this evening, sir, while you were out.”  “Oh?” I said.  “Twice, sir. He appeared a trifle agitated.”  “What, pipped?”  “He gave that impression, sir.”  I sipped the whisky. I was sorry if Bicky was in trouble, but, as a matter of fact, I was rather glad to have something I could discuss freely with Jeeves just then, because things had been a bit strained between us for some time, and it had been rather difficult to hit on anything to talk about that wasn’t apt to take a personal turn. You see, I had decided—rightly or wrongly—to grow a moustache and this had cut Jeeves to the quick. He couldn’t stick the thing at any price, and I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapproval till I was getting jolly well fed up with it. What I mean is, while there’s no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves’s judgment is absolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me that it was getting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as my costume. No one can call me an unreasonable chappie, and many’s the time I’ve given in like a lamb when Jeeves has voted against one of my pet suits or ties; but when it comes to a valet’s staking out a claim on your upper lip you’ve simply got to have a bit of the good old bulldog pluck and defy the blighter.  “He said that he would call again later, sir.”  “Something must be up, Jeeves.”  “Yes, sir.”  I gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl. It seemed to hurt Jeeves a good deal, so I chucked it.  “I see by the paper, sir, that Mr. Bickersteth’s uncle is arriving on the _Carmantic_.”  “Yes?”  “His Grace the Duke of Chiswick, sir.”  This was news to me, that Bicky’s uncle was a duke. Rum, how little one knows about one’s pals! I had met Bicky for the first time at a species of beano or jamboree down in Washington Square, not long after my arrival in New York. I suppose I was a bit homesick at the time, and I rather took to Bicky when I found that he was an Englishman and had, in fact, been up at Oxford with me. Besides, he was a frightful chump, so we naturally drifted together; and while we were taking a quiet snort in a corner that wasn’t all cluttered up with artists and sculptors and what-not, he furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarily gifted imitation of a bull-terrier chasing a cat up a tree. But, though we had subsequently become extremely pally, all I really knew about him was that he was generally hard up, and had an uncle who relieved the strain a bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances.  “If the Duke of Chiswick is his uncle,” I said, “why hasn’t he a title? Why isn’t he Lord What-Not?”  “Mr. Bickersteth is the son of his grace’s late sister, sir, who married Captain Rollo Bickersteth of the Coldstream Guards.”  Jeeves knows everything.  “Is Mr. Bickersteth’s father dead, too?”  “Yes, sir.”  “Leave any money?”  “No, sir.”  I began to understand why poor old Bicky was always more or less on the rocks. To the casual and irreflective observer, if you know what I mean, it may sound a pretty good wheeze having a duke for an uncle, but the trouble about old Chiswick was that, though an extremely wealthy old buster, owning half London and about five counties up north, he was notoriously the most prudent spender in England. He was what American chappies would call a hard-boiled egg. If Bicky’s people hadn’t left him anything and he depended on what he could prise out of the old duke, he was in a pretty bad way. Not that that explained why he was hunting me like this, because he was a chap who never borrowed money. He said he wanted to keep his pals, so never bit any one’s ear on principle.  At this juncture the door bell rang. Jeeves floated out to answer it.  “Yes, sir. Mr. Wooster has just returned,” I heard him say. And Bicky came trickling in, looking pretty sorry for himself.  “Halloa, Bicky!” I said. “Jeeves told me you had been trying to get me. Jeeves, bring another glass, and let the revels commence. What’s the trouble, Bicky?”  “I’m in a hole, Bertie. I want your advice.”  “Say on, old lad!”  “My uncle’s turning up to-morrow, Bertie.”  “So Jeeves told me.”  “The Duke of Chiswick, you know.”  “So Jeeves told me.”  Bicky seemed a bit surprised.  “Jeeves seems to know everything.”  “Rather rummily, that’s exactly what I was thinking just now myself.”  “Well, I wish,” said Bicky gloomily, “that he knew a way to get me out of the hole I’m in.”  Jeeves shimmered in with the glass, and stuck it competently on the table.  “Mr. Bickersteth is in a bit of a hole, Jeeves,” I said, “and wants you to rally round.”  “Very good, sir.”  Bicky looked a bit doubtful.  “Well, of course, you know, Bertie, this thing is by way of being a bit private and all that.”  “I shouldn’t worry about that, old top. I bet Jeeves knows all"]]]
