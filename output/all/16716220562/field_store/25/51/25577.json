Any letter with which you may favour me had better be directed to my London address; here is my card.  But, M. le Vicomte, there is one point on which pray pardon me if I question you still.  Had you no suspicion that there was one reason why this lady might have quitted Paris so hastily, and have so shrunk from the thought of a marriage so advantageous, in a worldly point of view, as that with M. Louvier,--namely, that she anticipated the probability of becoming the mother of a child by the man whom she refused to acknowledge as a husband?\"  \"That idea did not strike me until you asked me if she had a child. Should your conjecture be correct, it would obviously increase her repugnance to apply for the annulment of her illegal marriage.  But if Louise is still living and comes across me, I do not doubt that, the motives for concealment no longer operating, she will confide to me the truth.  Since we have been talking together thus frankly, I suppose I may fairly ask whether I do not guess correctly in supposing that this _soi- disant_ husband, whose name I forget,--Mac--something, perhaps, Scotch-I think she said he was _Ecossais_,--is dead and has left by will some legacy to Louise and any child she may have borne to him?\"  \"Not exactly so.  The man, as you say, is dead; but he bequeathed no legacy to the lady who did not hold herself married to him.  But there are those connected with him who, knowing the history, think that some compensation is due for the wrong so unconsciously done to her, and yet more to any issue of a marriage not meant to be irregular or illegal. Permit me now to explain why I sought you in another guise and name than my own.  I could scarcely place in M. Lebeau the confidence which I now unreservedly place in the Vicomte de Mauleon.\"  \"_Cela va sans dire_.  You believed, then, that calumny about the jewels; you do not believe it now?\"  \"Now!  my amazement is, that any one who had known you could believe it.\"  \"Oh, how often, and with tears of rage in my exile--my wanderings--have I asked that question of myself!  That rage has ceased; and I have but one feeling left for that credulous, fickle Paris, of which one day I was the idol, the next the byword.  Well, a man sometimes plays chess more skilfully for having been long a mere bystander.  He understands better how to move, and when to sacrifice the pieces.  Politics, M. Vane, is the only exciting game left to me at my years.  At yours, there is still that of love.  How time flies! we are nearing the station at which I descend. I have kinsfolk of my mother's in these districts.  They are not Imperialists; they are said to be powerful in the department.  But before I apply to them in my own name, I think it prudent that M. Lebeau should quietly ascertain what is their real strength, and what would be the prospects of success if Victor de Mauleon offered himself as depute at the next election.  Wish him joy, M. Vane!  If he succeed, you will hear of him some day crowned in the Capitol, or hurled from the Tarpeian rock.\"  Here the train stopped.  The false Lebeau gathered up his papers, readjusted his spectacles and his bag, descended lightly, and, pressing Graham's hand as he paused at the door, said, \"Be sure I will not forget your address if I have anything to say. _Bon voyage_\"     CHAPTER VII.  Graham continued his journey to Strasbourg.  On arriving there he felt very unwell.  Strong though his frame was, the anguish and self-struggle through which he had passed since the day he had received in London Mrs. Morley's letter, till that on which he had finally resolved on his course of conduct at Paris, and the shock which had annihilated his hopes in Isaura's rejection, had combined to exhaust its endurance, and fever had already commenced when he took his place in the coupe.  If there be a thing which a man should not do when his system is undermined, and his pulse between 90 and 100, it is to travel all night by a railway express. Nevertheless, as the Englishman's will was yet stronger than his frame, he would not give himself more than an hour's rest, and again started for Berlin.  Long before he got to Berlin, the will failed him--as well as the frame.  He was lifted out of the carriage, taken to a hotel in a small German town, and six hours afterwards he was delirious.  It was fortunate for him that under such circumstances plenty of money and Scott's circular-notes for some hundreds were found in his pocketbook, so that he did not fail to receive attentive nursing and skilful medical treatment.  There, for the present, I must leave him--leave him for how long?  But any village apothecary could say that fever such as his must run its course.  He was still in bed, and very dimly--and that but at times--conscious, when the German armies were gathering round the penfold of Sedan.     CHAPTER VIII.  When the news of the disastrous day at Sedan reached Paris, the first effect was that of timid consternation.  There were a few cries of _Decheance_! fewer still of _Vive la Republique_ among the motley crowds; but they were faint, and chiefly by ragged _gamins_.  A small body repaired to Trochu and offered him the sceptre, which he politely declined.  A more important and respectable body--for it comprised the majority of the _Corps Legislatif_--urged Palikao to accept the temporary dictatorship, which the War Minister declined with equal politeness.  In both these overtures it was clear that the impulse of the proposers was towards any form of government rather than republican.  The _sergens de ville_ were sufficient that day to put down riot.  They did make a charge on a mob, which immediately ran away.  The morning of that day the Council of Ten were summoned by Lebeau--minus only Rameau, who was still too unwell to attend, and the Belgian, not then at Paris; but their place was supplied by the two travelling members, who had been absent from the meeting before recorded.  These were conspirators better known in history than those I have before described; professional conspirators--personages who from their youth upwards had done little else but conspire.  Following the discreet plan pursued elsewhere throughout this humble work, I give their names other than they bore.  One, a very swarthy and ill-favoured man, between forty and fifty, I call Paul Grimm--by origin a German, but by rearing and character French; from the hair on his head, staring up rough and ragged as a bramblebush, to the soles of small narrow feet, shod with dainty care, he was a personal coxcomb, and spent all he could spare on his dress.  A clever man, not ill-educated--a vehement and effective speaker at a club.  Vanity and an amorous temperament had made him a conspirator, since he fancied he interested the ladies more in that capacity than any other.  His companion, Edgar Ferrier, would have been a journalist, only hitherto his opinions had found no readers; the opinions were those of Marat.  He rejoiced in thinking that his hour for glory, so long deferred, had now arrived.  He was thoroughly sincere: his father and grandfather had died in a madhouse.  Both these men, insignificant in ordinary times, were likely to become of terrible importance in the crisis of a revolution.  They both had great power with the elements that form a Parisian mob.  The instructions given to these members of the Council by Lebeau were brief: they were summed up in the one word, _Decheance_.  The formidable nature of a council apparently so meanly constituted became strikingly evident at that moment, because it was so small in number, while each one of these could put in movement a large section of the populace; secondly, because, unlike a revolutionary club or a numerous association, no time was wasted in idle speeches, and all were under the orders of one man of clear head and resolute purpose; and thirdly, and above all, because one man supplied the treasury, and money for an object desired was liberally given and promptly at hand.  The meeting did not last ten minutes, and about two hours afterwards its effects were visible.  From Montmartre and Belleville and Montretout poured streams of _ouvriers_, with whom Armand Monnier was a chief, and the _Medecin des Pauvres_ an oracle.  Grimm and Ferrier headed other detachments that startled the well-dressed idlers on the Boulevards.  The stalwart figure of the Pole was seen on the Place de la Concorde, towering amidst other refugees, amid which glided the Italian champion of humanity.  The cry of _Decheance_ became louder.  But as yet there were only few cries of _Vive la Republique_!--such a cry was not on the orders issued by Lebeau.  At midnight the crowd round the hall of the _Corps Legislatif_ is large: cries of _La Dechaeance_ loud--a few cries, very feeble, of _Vive la Republique_!  What followed on the 4th--the marvellous audacity with which half-a-dozen lawyers belonging to a pitiful minority in a Chamber elected by universal suffrage walked into the Hotel de Ville and said, \"The Republic is established, and we are its Government,\" history has told too recently for me to narrate.  On the evening of the 5th the Council of Ten met again: the Pole; the Italian radiant; Grimm and Ferrier much excited and rather drunk; the Medecin des Pauvres thoughtful; and Armand Monnier gloomy.  A rumour has spread that General Trochu, in accepting the charge imposed on him, has exacted from the Government the solemn assurance of respect for God, and for the rights of Family and Property.  The Atheist is very indignant at the assent of the Government to the first proposition; Monnier equal indignant at the assent to the second and third.  What has that honest _ouvrier_ conspired for?--what has he suffered for?--of late nearly starved for?--but to marry another man's wife, getting rid of his own, and to legalise a participation in the property of his employer,--and now he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7747"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 11 (#6)"],["body"," no better off than before. \"There must be another revolution,\" he whispers to the Atheist.  \"Certainly,\" whispers back the Atheist; \"he who desires to better this world must destroy all belief in another.\"  The conclave was assembled when Lebeau entered by the private door.  He took his place at the head of the table; and, fixing on the group eyes that emitted a cold gleam through the spectacles, thus spoke:  \"Messieurs, or Citoyens, which ye will--I no longer call ye confreres-- you have disobeyed or blundered my instructions.  On such an occasion disobedience and blunder are crimes equally heinous.\"  Angry murmurs.  \"Silence!  Do not add mutiny to your other offences.  My instructions were simple and short.  Aid in the abolition of the Empire.  Do not aid in any senseless cry for a Republic or any other form of government. Leave that to the Legislature.  What have you done?  You swelled the crowd that invaded the _Corps Ligislatif_.  You, Dombinsky, not even a Frenchman, dare to mount the President's rostrum, and brawl forth your senseless jargon.  You, Edgar Ferrier, from whom I expected better, ascend the tribune, and invite the ruffians in the crowd to march to the prisons and release the convicts; and all of you swell the mob at the Hotel de Ville, and inaugurate the reign of folly by creating an oligarchy of lawyers to resist the march of triumphal armies.  Messieurs, I have done with you.  You are summoned for the last time: the Council is dissolved.\"  With these words Lebeau put on his hat, and turned to depart.  But the Pole, who was seated near him, sprang to his feet, exclaiming, \"Traitor, thou shalt not escape!  Comrades, he wants to sell us!\"  \"I have a right to sell you at least, for I bought you, and a very bad bargain I made,\" said Lebeau, in a tone of withering sarcasm.  \"Liar!\" cried the Pole, and seized Lebeau by the left hand, while with the right he drew forth a revolver.  Ferrier and Grimm, shouting, \"_A bas le renegat_!\" would have rushed forward in support of the Pole, but Monnier thrust himself between them and their intended victim, crying with a voice that dominated their yell, \"Back!--we are not assassins.\" Before he had finished the sentence the Pole was on his knees.  With a vigour which no one could have expected from the seeming sexagenarian, Lebeau had caught the right arm of his assailant, twisted it back so mercilessly as almost to dislocate elbow and shoulder joint.  One barrel of the revolver discharged itself harmlessly against the opposite wall, and the pistol itself then fell from the unnerved hand of the would-be assassin; and what with the pain and the sudden shock, the stalwart Dombinsky fell in the attitude of a suppliant at the feet of his unlooked-for vanquisher.  Lebeau released his hold, possessed himself of the pistol, pointing the barrels towards Edgar Ferrier, who stood with mouth agape and lifted arm arrested, and said quietly: \"Monsieur, have the goodness to open that window.\"  Ferrier mechanically obeyed.  \"Now, hireling,\" continued Lebeau, addressing the vanquished Pole, \"choose between the door and the window.\"  \"Go, my friend,\" whispered the Italian.  The Pole did not utter a word; but rising nimbly, and rubbing his arm, stalked to the door.  There he paused a moment and said, \"I retire overpowered by numbers,\" and vanished.  \"Messieurs,\" resumed Lebeau, calmly, \"I repeat that the Council is dissolved.  In fact its object is fulfilled more abruptly than any of us foresaw, and by means which I at least had been too long out of Paris to divine as possible.  I now see that every aberration of reason is possible to the Parisians.  The object that united us was the fall of the Empire.  As I have always frankly told you, with that object achieved, separation commences.  Each of us has his own crotchet, which differs from the other man's.  Pursue yours as you will--I pursue mine--you will find Jean Lebeau no more in Paris: _il s'eface.  Au plaisir, mais pas au revoir_.\"  He retreated to the masked door and disappeared.  Marc le Roux, the porter or custos of that ruinous council-hall, alarmed at the explosion of the pistol, had hurried into the room, and now stood unheeded by the door with mouth agape, while Lebeau thus curtly dissolved the assembly.  But when the president vanished through the secret doorway, Le Roux also retreated.  Hastily descending the stairs, he made as quickly as his legs could carry him for the mouth of the alley in the rear of the house, through which he knew that Lebeau must pass.  He arrived, panting and breathless, in time to catch hold of the ex- president's arm.  \"Pardon, citizen,\" stammered he, \"but do I understand that you have sent the Council of Ten to the devil?\"  \"I?  Certainly not, my good Paul; I dismiss them to go where they like. If they prefer the direction you name, it is their own choice.  I declined to accompany them, and I advise you not to do so.\"  \"But, citizen, have you considered what is to become of Madame?  Is she to be turned out of the lodge?  Are my wages to stop, and Madame to be left without a crust to put into her soup?\"  \"Not so bad as that; I have just paid the rent of the baraque for three months in advance, and there is your quarter's pay, in advance also.  My kind regards to Madame, and tell her to keep your skin safe from the schemes of these lunatics.\"  Thrusting some pieces of gold into the hands of the porter, Lebeau nodded his adieu, and hastened along his way.  Absorbed in his own reflections, he did not turn to look behind.  But if he had, he could not have detected the dark form of the porter, creeping in the deep shadow of the streets with distant but watchful footsteps.     CHAPTER, IX.  The conspirators, when left by their president, dispersed in deep, not noisy resentment.  They were indeed too stunned for loud demonstration; and belonging to different grades of life, and entertaining different opinions, their confidence in each other seemed lost now that the chief who had brought and kept them together was withdrawn from their union. The Italian and the Atheist slunk away, whispering to each other.  Grimm reproached Ferrier for deserting Dombinsky and obeying Lebeau.  Ferrier accused Grimm of his German origin, and hinted at denouncing him as a Prussian spy.  Gaspard le Noy linked his arm in Monnier's, and when they had gained the dark street without, leading into a labyrinth of desolate lanes, the Medicin des Pauvres said to the mechanic: \"You are a brave fellow, Monnier.  Lebeau owes you a good turn.  But for your cry, 'We are not assassins,' the Pole might not have been left without support.  No atmosphere is so infectious as that in which we breathe the same air of revenge: when the violence of one man puts into action the anger or suspicion of others, they become like a pack of hounds, which follow the spring of the first hound, whether on the wild boar or their own master. Even I, who am by no means hot-headed, had my hand on my case-knife when the word 'assassin' rebuked and disarmed me.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Monnier, gloomily, \"I half repent the impulse which made me interfere to save that man.  Better he should die than live to betray the cause we allowed him to lead.\"  \"Nay, mon ami, speaking candidly, we must confess that he never from the first pretended to advocate the cause for which you conspired.  On the contrary, he always said that with the fall of the Empire our union would cease, and each become free to choose his own way towards his own after- objects.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Armand, reluctantly; \"he said that to me privately, with still greater plainness than he said it to the Council.  But I answered as plainly.\"  \"How?\"  \"I told him that the man who takes the first step in a revolution, and persuades others to go along with him, cannot in safety stand still or retreat when the next step is to be taken.  It is 'en avant' or 'a la lanterne.'  So it shall be with him.  Shall a fellow-being avail himself of the power over my mind which he derives from superior education or experience,--break into wild fragments my life, heretofore tranquil, orderly, happy,--make use of my opinions, which were then but harmless desires, to serve his own purpose, which was hostile to the opinions he roused into action,--say to me, 'Give yourself up to destroy the first obstacle in the way of securing a form of society which your inclinations prefer,' and then, that first obstacle destroyed, cry, 'Halt!  I go with you no further; I will not help you to piece together the life I have induced you to shatter; I will not aid you to substitute for the society that pained you the society that would please; I leave you, struggling, bewildered, maddened, in the midst of chaos within and without you'? Shall a fellow-being do this, and vanish with a mocking cry: 'Tool!  I have had enough of thee; I cast thee aside as worthless lumber'?  Ah! let him beware!  The tool is of iron, and can be shaped to edge and point.\"  The passion with which this rough eloquence was uttered, and the fierce sinister expression that had come over a countenance habitually open and manly, even when grave and stern, alarmed and startled Le Noy. \"Pooh, my friend!\" he said, rather falteringly, \"you are too excited now to think justly.  Go home and kiss your children.  Never do anything that may make them shrink from their father.  And as to Lebeau, try and forget him.  He says he shall disappear from Paris.  I believe him.  It is clear to me that the man is not what he seemed to us.  No man of sixty could by so easy a sleight of hand have brought that giant Pole to his knee.  If Lebeau reappear it will be in some other form.  Did you notice that in the momentary struggle his flaxen wig got disturbed, and beneath it I saw a dark curl.  I suspect that the man is not only younger than he seemed, but of higher rank--a conspirator against one throne, perhaps, in order to be minister under another.  There are such men.\"  Before"]]]
