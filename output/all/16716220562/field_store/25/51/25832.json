Then hail! O King.    MARCO and GIUSEPPE (together).              Come, let's away—our island crown awaits me—                  Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart!             The thought of Royal dignity elates me,                  But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!                                             (Addressing Gianetta and   Tessa.)    GIANETTA and TESSA (together).              Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting;                  But while upon the sea you gaily roam,             Remember that a heart for thee is fretting—                  The tender little heart you've left at home!    GIA.                     Now, Marco dear,                            My wishes hear:                                 While you're away                            It's understood                            You will be good                                 And not too gay.                            To every trace                            Of maiden grace                                 You will be blind,                            And will not glance                            By any chance                                 On womankind!                             If you are wise,                            You'll shut your eyes                                 Till we arrive,                            And not address                            A lady less                                 Than forty-five.                            You'll please to frown                            On every gown                                 That you may see;                            And, O my pet,                            You won't forget                                 You've married me!                   And O my darling, O my pet,                  Whatever else you may forget,                  In yonder isle beyond the sea,                  Do not forget you've married me!    TESS.                    You'll lay your head                            Upon your bed                                 At set of sun.                            You will not sing                            Of anything                                 To any one.                            You'll sit and mope                            All day, I hope,                                 And shed a tear                            Upon the life                            Your little wife                                 Is passing here.                             And if so be                            You think of me,                                 Please tell the moon!                            I'll read it all                            In rays that fall                                 On the lagoon:                            You'll be so kind                            As tell the wind                                 How you may be,                            And send me words                            By little birds                                 To comfort me!                   And O my darling, O my pet,                  Whatever else you may forget,                  In yonder isle beyond the sea,                  Do not forget you've married me!    QUARTET.       Oh my darling, O my pet, etc.    CHORUS (during which a \"Xebeque\" is hauled alongside the quay.)                   Then away we go to an island fair                       That lies in a Southern sea:                  We know not where, and we don't much care,                       Wherever that isle may be.    THE MEN (hauling on boat).                            One, two, three,                                 Haul!                            One, two, three,                                 Haul!                            One, two, three,                                 Haul!                            With a will!    ALL.      When the breezes are a-blowing             The ship will be going,                  When they don't we shall all stand still!             Then away we go to an island fair,             We know not where, and we don't much care,                  Wherever that isle may be.                              SOLO—MARCO.                        Away we go                            To a balmy isle,                       Where the roses blow                            All the winter while.    ALL (hoisting sail).                       Then away we go to an island fair                            That lies in a Southern sea:                       Then away we go to an island fair,                            Then away, then away, then away!    (The men embark on the \"Xebeque.\"  Marco and Giuseppe embracing   Gianetta and Tessa.  The girls wave a farewell to the men as the   curtain falls.)                             END OF ACT I      ACT II        SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and   Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,   occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers   are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,   etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various   degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social   distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some   reading, others playing cup and ball, \"morra\", etc.                 CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.              Of happiness the very pith                            In Barataria you may see:             A monarchy that's tempered with                            Republican Equality.             This form of government we find             The beau ideal of its kind—             A despotism strict combined                            With absolute equality!                           MARCO and GIUSEPPE.              Two kings, of undue pride bereft,                            Who act in perfect unity,             Whom you can order right and left                            With absolute impunity.             Who put their subjects at their ease             By doing all they can to please!             And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,                            Seize every opportunity.    CHORUS.   Of happiness the very pith, etc.         MAR.  Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your   expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much   obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good   feeling.        ALL.  We heard you.        MAR.  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with   sentiments so charmingly expressed.        ALL.  That's all right.        GIU.  At the same time there is just one little grievance   that we should like to ventilate.        ALL (angrily).  What?        GIU.  Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged   that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we   are to act as one person.        GIORGIO.  Exactly.        GIU.  Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point   of fact, two persons.        ANNIBALE.  Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a   legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as   we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.        GIU.  No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.   It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you   supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it   as a legal fiction carried a little too far.        ANNI.  It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an   opinion off-hand.  Suppose we reserve it for argument before the   full Court?        MAR.  Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?        MAR. and GIU.  We want our tea.        ANNI.  I think we may make an interim order for double   rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to   indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?        GIOR.  That, I think, will meet the case.  But you must work   hard—stick to it—nothing like work.        GIU.  Oh, certainly.  We quite understand that a man who   holds the magnificent position of King should do something to   justify it.  We are called \"Your Majesty\"; we are allowed to buy   ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us   in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we   enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists   to all the principal charities.  In return for these advantages   the least we can do is to make ourselves useful about the Palace.                      SONG—GIUSEPPE with CHORUS.    Rising early in the morning,        We proceed to light the fire,   Then our Majesty adorning        In its workaday attire,             We embark without delay             On the duties of the day.    First, we polish off some batches   Of political despatches,        And foreign politicians circumvent;   Then, if business isn't heavy,   We may hold a Royal levee,        Or ratify some Acts of Parliament.        Then we probably review the household troops—        With the usual \"Shalloo humps!\" and \"Shalloo hoops!\"        Or receive with ceremonial and state   An"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/808"],["title","The Complete Plays of Gilbert and Sullivan (#6)"],["body"," Eastern potentate.        After that we generally        Go and dress our private valet—        (It's a rather nervous duty—he's a touchy little man)—        Write some letters literary        For our private secretary—        He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.        Then, in view of cravings inner,        We go down and order dinner;        Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate—        Spend an hour in titivating        All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;        Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.         Oh, philosophers may sing        Of the troubles of a King;        Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;        But the privilege and pleasure        That we treasure beyond measure        Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.    CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.    After luncheon (making merry   On a bun and glass of sherry),        If we've nothing in particular to do,   We may make a Proclamation,   Or receive a deputation—        Then we possibly create a Peer or two.   Then we help a fellow-creature on his path   With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,   Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state   To a festival, a function, or a fete.        Then we go and stand as sentry        At the Palace (private entry),        Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and   fro,        While the warrior on duty        Goes in search of beer and beauty        (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).        He relieves us, if he's able,        Just in time to lay the table,        Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve   or one,        With a pleasure that's emphatic,        We retire to our attic        With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!         Oh, philosophers may sing        Of the troubles of a King,        But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are   none;        And the culminating pleasure        That we treasure beyond measure        Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!    CHORUS. Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.                                         (Exeunt all but Marco and   Giuseppe.)         GIU.  Yes, it really is a very pleasant existence.  They're   all so singularly kind and considerate.  You don't find them   wanting to do this, or wanting to do that, or saying \"It's my   turn now.\"  No, they let us have all the fun to ourselves, and   never seem to grudge it.        MAR.  It makes one feel quite selfish.  It almost seems like   taking advantage of their good nature.        GIU.  How nice they were about the double rations.        MAR.  Most considerate.  Ah! there's only one thing wanting   to make us thoroughly comfortable.        GIU.  And that is?        MAR.  The dear little wives we left behind us three months   ago.        GIU.  Yes, it is dull without female society.  We can do   without everything else, but we can't do without that.        MAR.  And if we have that in perfection, we have everything.   There is only one recipe for perfect happiness.                              SONG—MARCO.                   Take a pair of sparkling eyes,                       Hidden, ever and anon,                            In a merciful eclipse—                  Do not heed their mild surprise—                       Having passed the Rubicon,                            Take a pair of rosy lips;                  Take a figure trimly planned—                       Such as admiration whets—                            (Be particular in this);                  Take a tender little hand,                       Fringed with dainty fingerettes,                            Press it—in parenthesis;—                  Ah! Take all these, you lucky man—                  Take and keep them, if you can!                   Take a pretty little cot—                       Quite a miniature affair—                            Hung about with trellised vine,                  Furnish it upon the spot                       With the treasures rich and rare                            I've endeavoured to define.                  Live to love and love to live—                       You will ripen at your ease,                            Growing on the sunny side—                  Fate has nothing more to give.                       You're a dainty man to please                            If you are not satisfied.                  Ah! Take my counsel, happy man;                  Act upon it, if you can!    (Enter Chorus of Contadine, running in, led by Fiametta and   Vittoria.  They are met by all the Ex-Gondoliers, who welcome   them heartily.)            SCENE—CHORUS OF GIRLS, QUARTET, DUET and CHORUS.              Here we are, at the risk of our lives,             From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—             And to that end we've crossed the main,             And don't intend to return again!    FIA.           Though obedience is strong,                       Curiosity's stronger—                  We waited for long,                       Till we couldn't wait longer.    VIT.           It's imprudent, we know,                       But without your society                  Existence was slow,                       And we wanted variety—    BOTH.     Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.    ALL.      So here we are, at the risk of our lives,             From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—             And to that end we've crossed the main,             And don't intend to return again!

Gianetta!                           TESSA and GIANETTA.    TESS.          After sailing to this island—   GIA.                Tossing in a manner frightful,   TESS.          We are all once more on dry land—   GIA.                And we find the change delightful,   TESS.          As at home we've been remaining—                       We've not seen you both for ages,   GIA.           Tell me, are you fond of reigning?—                       How's the food, and what's the wages?   TESS.          Does your new employment please ye?—   GIA.                How does Royalizing strike you?   TESS.          Is it difficult or easy?—   GIA.                Do you think your subjects like you?   TESS.          I am anxious to elicit,                       Is it plain and easy steering?   GIA.           Take it altogether, is it                       Better fun than gondoliering?   BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting                       Till you tell us, never doubt it;                  Everything is interesting,                       Tell us, tell us all about it!    CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.    TESS.          Is the populace exacting?   GIA.                Do they keep you at a distance?   TESS.          All unaided are you acting,   GIA.                Or do they provide assistance?   TESS.          When you're busy, have you got to                       Get up early in the morning?   GIA.           If you do what you ought not to,                       Do they give the usual warning?   TESS.          With a horse do they equip you?   GIA.                Lots of trumpeting and drumming?   TESS.          Do the Royal tradesmen tip you?   GIA.                Ain't the livery becoming!   TESS.          Does your human being inner                       Feed on everything that nice is?   GIA.           Do they give you wine for dinner;                       Peaches, sugar-plums, and ices?   BOTH.          We shall both go on requesting                       Till you tell us, never doubt it;                  Everything is interesting,                       Tell us, tell us all about it!    CHORUS.        They will both go on requesting, etc.         MAR.  This is indeed a most delightful surprise!        TESS.  Yes, we thought you'd like it.  You see, it was like   this.  After you left we felt very dull and mopey, and the days   crawled by, and you never wrote; so at last I said to Gianetta,   \"I can't stand this any longer; those two poor Monarchs haven't   got any one to mend their stockings or sew on their buttons or   patch their clothes—at least, I hope they haven't—let us all   pack up a change and go and see how they're getting on.\"  And she   said, \"Done,\" and they all said, \"Done\"; and we asked old Giacopo   to lend us his boat, and he said, \"Done\"; and we've crossed the   sea, and, thank goodness, that's done; and here we are,   and—and—I've done!        GIA.  And now—which of you is King?        TESS.  And which of us is Queen?        GIU.  That we shan't know until Nurse turns up.  But never   mind that—the question is, how shall we celebrate the   commencement of our honeymoon?  Gentlemen, will you allow us to   offer you a magnificent banquet?        ALL.  We will!        GIU.  Thanks very much; and, ladies, what do you say to a   dance?        TESS.  A banquet and a dance!  O, it's too much happiness!                            CHORUS and DANCE.              Dance a cachucha, fandango, bolero,             Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero—             Wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances             The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!                  To the pretty pitter-pitter-patter,                  And the clitter-clitter-clitter-clatter—                       Clitter—clitter—clatter,                       Pitter—pitter—patter,                  Patter, patter, patter, patter, we'll dance.             Old Xeres we'll drink—Manzanilla, Montero;             For wine, when it runs in abundance, enhances             The reckless delight of that wildest of dances!    (Cachucha.)    (The dance is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of Don   Alhambra, who looks on with astonishment."]]]
