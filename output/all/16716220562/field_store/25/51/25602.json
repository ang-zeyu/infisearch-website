That's thousands of years ago, but I hear that children still build castles on the sand.  It's difficult to break yourself of a habit.'  'But why did you stop living in the castles?' asked Robert.  'It's a sad story,' said the Psammead gloomily.  'It was because they WOULD build moats to the castles, and the nasty wet bubbling sea used to come in, and of course as soon as a sand-fairy got wet it caught cold, and generally died.  And so there got to be fewer and fewer, and, whenever you found a fairy and had a wish, you used to wish for a Megatherium, and eat twice as much as you wanted, because it might be weeks before you got another wish.'  'And did YOU get wet?' Robert inquired.  The Sand-fairy shuddered.  'Only once,' it said; 'the end of the twelfth hair of my top left whisker - I feel the place still in damp weather.  It was only once, but it was quite enough for me. I went away as soon as the sun had dried my poor dear whisker.  I scurried away to the back of the beach, and dug myself a house deep in warm dry sand, and there I've been ever since.  And the sea changed its lodgings afterwards.  And now I'm not going to tell you another thing.'  'Just one more, please,' said the children.  'Can you give wishes now?'  'Of course,' said it; 'didn't I give you yours a few minutes ago? You said, \"I wish you'd come out,\" and I did.'  'Oh, please, mayn't we have another?'  'Yes, but be quick about it.  I'm tired of you.'  I daresay you have often thought what you would do if you had three wishes given you, and have despised the old man and his wife in the black-pudding story, and felt certain that if you had the chance you could think of three really useful wishes without a moment's hesitation.  These children had often talked this matter over, but, now the chance had suddenly come to them, they could not make up their minds.  'Quick,' said the Sand-fairy crossly.  No one could think of anything, only Anthea did manage to remember a private wish of her own and jane's which they had never told the boys.  She knew the boys would not care about it - but still it was better than nothing.  'I wish we were all as beautiful as the day,' she said in a great hurry.  The children looked at each other, but each could see that the others were not any better-looking than usual.  The Psammead pushed out its long eyes, and seemed to be holding its breath and swelling itself out till it was twice as fat and furry as before.  Suddenly it let its breath go in a long sigh.  'I'm really afraid I can't manage it,' it said apologetically; 'I must be out of practice.'  The children were horribly disappointed.  'Oh, DO try again!' they said.  'Well,' said the Sand-fairy, 'the fact is, I was keeping back a little strength to give the rest of you your wishes with.  If you'll be contented with one wish a day amongst the lot of you I daresay I can screw myself up to it.  Do you agree to that?'  'Yes, oh yes!' said Jane and Anthea.  The boys nodded.  They did not believe the Sand-fairy could do it.  You can always make girls believe things much easier than you can boys.  It stretched out its eyes farther than ever, and swelled and swelled and swelled.  'I do hope it won't hurt itself,' said Anthea.  'Or crack its skin,' Robert said anxiously.  Everyone was very much relieved when the Sand-fairy, after getting so big that it almost filled up the hole in the sand, suddenly let out its breath and went back to its proper size.  'That's all right,' it said, panting heavily.  'It'll come easier to-morrow.'  'Did it hurt much?' asked Anthea.  'Only my poor whisker, thank you,' said he, 'but you're a kind and thoughtful child.  Good day.'  It scratched suddenly and fiercely with its hands and feet, and disappeared in the sand.  Then the children looked at each other, and each child suddenly found itself alone with three perfect strangers, all radiantly beautiful.  They stood for some moments in perfect silence.  Each thought that its brothers and sisters had wandered off, and that these strange children had stolen up unnoticed while it was watching the swelling form of the Sand-fairy.  Anthea spoke first -  'Excuse me,' she said very politely to Jane, who now had enormous blue eyes and a cloud of russet hair, 'but have you seen two little boys and a little girl anywhere about?'  'I was just going to ask you that,' said Jane.  And then Cyril cried:  'Why, it's YOU!  I know the hole in your pinafore!  You ARE Jane, aren't you?  And you're the Panther; I can see your dirty handkerchief that you forgot to change after you'd cut your thumb! Crikey!  The wish has come off, after all.  I say, am I as handsome as you are?'  'If you're Cyril, I liked you much better as you were before,' said Anthea decidedly.  'You look like the picture of the young chorister, with your golden hair; you'll die young, I shouldn't wonder.  And if that's Robert, he's like an Italian organ-grinder. His hair's all black.'  'You two girls are like Christmas cards, then - that's all - silly Christmas cards,' said Robert angrily.  'And jane's hair is simply carrots.'  It was indeed of that Venetian tint so much admired by artists.  'Well, it's no use finding fault with each other,' said Anthea; 'let's get the Lamb and lug it home to dinner.  The servants will admire us most awfully, you'll see.'  Baby was just waking when they got to him, and not one of the children but was relieved to find that he at least was not as beautiful as the day, but just the same as usual.  'I suppose he's too young to have wishes naturally,' said Jane. 'We shall have to mention him specially next time.'  Anthea ran forward and held out her arms.  'Come to own Panther, ducky,' she said.  The Baby looked at her disapprovingly, and put a sandy pink thumb in his mouth, Anthea was his favourite sister.  'Come then,' she said.  'G'way long!' said the Baby.  'Come to own Pussy,' said Jane.  'Wants my Panty,' said the Lamb dismally, and his lip trembled.  'Here, come on, Veteran,' said Robert, 'come and have a yidey on Yobby's back.'  'Yah, narky narky boy,' howled the Baby, giving way altogether. Then the children knew the worst.  THE BABY DID NOT KNOW THEM!  They looked at each other in despair, and it was terrible to each, in this dire emergency, to meet only the beautiful eyes of perfect strangers, instead of the merry, friendly, commonplace, twinkling, jolly little eyes of its own brothers and sisters.  'This is most truly awful,' said Cyril when he had tried to lift up the Lamb, and the Lamb had scratched like a cat and bellowed like a bull.  'We've got to MAKE FRIENDS with him!  I can't carry him home screaming like that.  Fancy having to make friends with our own baby! - it's too silly.'  That, however, was exactly what they had to do.  It took over an hour, and the task was not rendered any easier by the fact that the Lamb was by this time as hungry as a lion and as thirsty as a desert.  At last he consented to allow these strangers to carry him home by turns, but as he refused to hold on to such new acquaintances he was a dead weight and most exhausting.  'Thank goodness, we're home!' said Jane, staggering through the iron gate to where Martha, the nursemaid, stood at the front door shading her eyes with her hand and looking out anxiously.  'Here! Do take Baby!'  Martha snatched the Baby from her arms.  'Thanks be, HE'S safe back,' she said.  'Where are the others, and whoever to goodness gracious are all of you?'  'We're US, of course,' said Robert.  'And who's US, when you're at home?' asked Martha scornfully.  'I tell you it's US, only we're beautiful as the day,' said Cyril. 'I'm Cyril, and these are the others, and we're jolly hungry.  Let us in, and don't be a silly idiot.'  Martha merely dratted Cyril's impudence and tried to shut the door in his face.  'I know we LOOK different, but I'm Anthea, and we're so tired, and it's long past dinner-time.'  'Then go home to your dinners, whoever you are; and if our children put you up to this playacting you can tell them from me they'll catch it, so they know what to expect!'  With that she did bang the door.  Cyril rang the bell violently.  No answer.  Presently cook put her head out of a bedroom window and said:  'If you don't take yourselves off, and that precious sharp, I'll go and fetch the police.'  And she slammed down the window.  'It's no good,' said Anthea.  'Oh, do, do come away before we get sent to prison!'  The boys said it was nonsense, and the law of England couldn't put you in prison for just being as beautiful as the day, but all the same they followed the others out into the lane.  'We shall be our proper selves after sunset, I suppose,' said Jane.  'I don't know,' Cyril said sadly; 'it mayn't be like that now - things have changed a good deal since Megatherium times.'  'Oh,' cried Anthea suddenly, 'perhaps we shall turn into stone at sunset, like the Megatheriums did, so that there mayn't be any of us left over for the next day.'  She began to cry, so did Jane.  Even the boys turned pale.  No one had the heart to say anything.  It was a horrible afternoon.  There was no house near where the children could beg a crust of bread or even a glass of water.  They were afraid to go to the village, because they had seen Martha go down there with a basket, and there was a local constable.  True, they were all as beautiful as the day, but that is a poor comfort when you are as hungry as a hunter and as thirsty as a sponge.  Three times they tried in vain to get the servants in the White House to let them in and listen to their tale.  And then Robert went alone, hoping to be able to climb in at one of the back windows and so open the door to the others.  But all the windows were out of reach, and Martha emptied a toilet-jug of cold water over him from a top window, and said:  'Go along with you, you nasty little Eyetalian "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/778"],["title","Five Children and It (#3)"],["body","monkey.\"  It came at last to their sitting down in a row under the hedge, with their feet in a dry ditch, waiting for sunset, and wondering whether, when the sun did set, they would turn into stone, or only into their own old natural selves; and each of them still felt lonely and among strangers, and tried not to look at the others, for, though their voices were their own, their faces were so radiantly beautiful as to be quite irritating to look at.  'I don't believe we SHALL turn to stone,' said Robert, breaking a long miserable silence, 'because the Sand-fairy said he'd give us another wish to-morrow, and he couldn't if we were stone, could he?'  The others said 'No,' but they weren't at all comforted.  Another silence, longer and more miserable, was broken by Cyril's suddenly saying, 'I don't want to frighten you girls, but I believe it's beginning with me already.  My foot's quite dead.  I'm turning to stone, I know I am, and so will you in a minute.'  'Never mind,' said Robert kindly, 'perhaps you'll be the only stone one, and the rest of us will be all right, and we'll cherish your statue and hang garlands on it.'  But when it turned out that Cyril's foot had only gone to sleep through his sitting too long with it under him, and when it came to life in an agony of pins and needles, the others were quite cross.  'Giving us such a fright for nothing!' said Anthea.  The third and miserablest silence of all was broken by Jane.  She said: 'If we DO come out of this all right, we'll ask the Sammyadd to make it so that the servants don't notice anything different, no matter what wishes we have.'  The others only grunted.  They were too wretched even to make good resolutions.  At last hunger and fright and crossness and tiredness - four very nasty things - all joined together to bring one nice thing, and that was sleep.  The children lay asleep in a row, with their beautiful eyes shut and their beautiful mouths open.  Anthea woke first.  The sun had set, and the twilight was coming on.  Anthea pinched herself very hard, to make sure, and when she found she could still feel pinching she decided that she was not stone, and then she pinched the others.  They, also, were soft.  'Wake up,' she said, almost in tears of joy; 'it's all right, we're not stone.  And oh, Cyril, how nice and ugly you do look, with your old freckles and your brown hair and your little eyes.  And so do you all!' she added, so that they might not feel jealous.  When they got home they were very much scolded by Martha, who told them about the strange children.  'A good-looking lot, I must say, but that impudent.'  'I know,' said Robert, who knew by experience how hopeless it would be to try to explain things to Martha.  'And where on earth have you been all this time, you naughty little things, you?'  'In the lane.'  'Why didn't you come home hours ago?'  'We couldn't because of THEM,' said Anthea.  'Who?'  'The children who were as beautiful as the day.  They kept us there till after sunset.  We couldn't come back till they'd gone.  You don't know how we hated them!  Oh, do, do give us some supper - we are so hungry.'  'Hungry!  I should think so,' said Martha angrily; 'out all day like this.  Well, I hope it'll be a lesson to you not to go picking up with strange children - down here after measles, as likely as not!  Now mind, if you see them again, don't you speak to them - not one word nor so much as a look - but come straight away and tell me.  I'll spoil their beauty for them!'  'If ever we DO see them again we'll tell you,' Anthea said; and Robert, fixing his eyes fondly on the cold beef that was being brought in on a tray by cook, added in heartfelt undertones -  'And we'll take jolly good care we never DO see them again.'  And they never have.    CHAPTER 2 GOLDEN GUINEAS   Anthea woke in the morning from a very real sort of dream, in which she was walking in the Zoological Gardens on a pouring wet day without any umbrella.  The animals seemed desperately unhappy because of the rain, and were all growling gloomily.  When she awoke, both the growling and the rain went on just the same.  The growling was the heavy regular breathing of her sister Jane, who had a slight cold and was still asleep.  The rain fell in slow drops on to Anthea's face from the wet corner of a bath-towel which her brother Robert was gently squeezing the water out of, to wake her up, as he now explained.  'Oh, drop it!' she said rather crossly; so he did, for he was not a brutal brother, though very ingenious in apple-pie beds, booby-traps, original methods of awakening sleeping relatives, and the other little accomplishments which make home happy.  'I had such a funny dream,' Anthea began.  'So did I,' said Jane, wakening suddenly and without warning.  'I dreamed we found a Sand-fairy in the gravel-pits, and it said it was a Sammyadd, and we might have a new wish every day, and -'  'But that's what I dreamed,' said Robert.  'I was just going to tell you - and we had the first wish directly it said so.  And I dreamed you girls were donkeys enough to ask for us all to be beautiful as the day, and we jolly well were, and it was perfectly beastly.'  'But CAN different people all dream the same thing?' said Anthea, sitting up in bed, 'because I dreamed all that as well as about the Zoo and the rain; and Baby didn't know us in my dream, and the servants shut us out of the house because the radiantness of our beauty was such a complete disguise, and -'  The voice of the eldest brother sounded from across the landing.  'Come on, Robert,' it said, 'you'll be late for breakfast again - unless you mean to shirk your bath like you did on Tuesday.'  'I say, come here a sec,' Robert replied.  'I didn't shirk it; I had it after brekker in father's dressing-room, because ours was emptied away.'  Cyril appeared in the doorway, partially clothed.  'Look here,' said Anthea, 'we've all had such an odd dream.  We've all dreamed we found a Sand-fairy.'  Her voice died away before Cyril's contemptuous glance.  'Dream?' he said, 'you little sillies, it's TRUE.  I tell you it all happened.  That's why I'm so keen on being down early.  We'll go up there directly after brekker, and have another wish.  Only we'll make up our minds, solid, before we go, what it is we do want, and no one must ask for anything unless the others agree first.  No more peerless beauties for this child, thank you.  Not if I know it!'  The other three dressed, with their mouths open.  If all that dream about the Sand-fairy was real, this real dressing seemed very like a dream, the girls thought.  Jane felt that Cyril was right, but Anthea was not sure, till after they had seen Martha and heard her full and plain reminders about their naughty conduct the day before.  Then Anthea was sure.  'Because,' said she, 'servants never dream anything but the things in the Dream-book, like snakes and oysters and going to a wedding - that means a funeral, and snakes are a false female friend, and oysters are babies.'  'Talking of babies,' said Cyril, 'where's the Lamb?' 'Martha's going to take him to Rochester to see her cousins. Mother said she might.  She's dressing him now,' said Jane, 'in his very best coat and hat.  Bread-and-butter, please.'  'She seems to like taking him too,' said Robert in a tone of wonder.  'Servants do like taking babies to see their relations,' Cyril said.  'I've noticed it before - especially in their best things.'  'I expect they pretend they're their own babies, and that they're not servants at all, but married to noble dukes of high degree, and they say the babies are the little dukes and duchesses,' Jane suggested dreamily, taking more marmalade.  'I expect that's what Martha'll say to her cousin.  She'll enjoy herself most frightfully-'  'She won't enjoy herself most frightfully carrying our infant duke to Rochester,' said Robert, 'not if she's anything like me - she won't.'  'Fancy walking to Rochester with the Lamb on your back!  Oh, crikey!' said Cyril in full agreement.  'She's going by carrier,' said Jane.  'Let's see them off, then we shall have done a polite and kindly act, and we shall be quite sure we've got rid of them for the day.'  So they did.  Martha wore her Sunday dress of two shades of purple, so tight in the chest that it made her stoop, and her blue hat with the pink cornflowers and white ribbon.  She had a yellow-lace collar with a green bow.  And the Lamb had indeed his very best cream-coloured silk coat and hat.  It was a smart party that the carrier's cart picked up at the Cross Roads.  When its white tilt and red wheels had slowly vanished in a swirl of chalk-dust -  'And now for the Sammyadd!' said Cyril, and off they went.  As they went they decided on the wish they would ask for.  Although they were all in a great hurry they did not try to climb down the sides of the gravel-pit, but went round by the safe lower road, as if they had been carts.  They had made a ring of stones round the place where the Sand-fairy had disappeared, so they easily found the spot.  The sun was burning and bright, and the sky was deep blue - without a cloud.  The sand was very hot to touch.  'Oh - suppose it was only a dream, after all,' Robert said as the boys uncovered their spades from the sand-heap where they had buried them and began to dig.  'Suppose you were a sensible chap,' said Cyril; 'one's quite as likely as the other!' 'Suppose you kept a civil tongue in your head,' Robert snapped.  'Suppose we girls take a turn,' said Jane, laughing.  'You boys seem to be getting very warm.'  'Suppose you don't come shoving your silly oar in,' said Robert, who was now warm indeed.  'We won't,' said Anthea quickly.  'Robert dear, don't be so grumpy - we won't say a word, you shall be the one to speak to the Fairy and tell him what we've decided to wish for.  You'll say it much better than we shall.'  'Suppose you drop being a little humbug,' said Robert, but not crossly.  'Look out - dig with"]]]
