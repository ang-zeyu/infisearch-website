For, indeed, already were hurrying to his banner Montagu, burning to retrieve his error, Oxford and Exeter, recovered from, and chafing at, their past alarm.  Thither his nephew, Fitzhugh, led the earl's own clansmen of Middleham; thither were spurring Somerset from the west, [Most historians state that Somerset was then in London; but Sharon Turner quotes \"Harleian Manuscripts,\" 38, to show that he had left the metropolis \"to raise an army from the western counties,\" and ranks him amongst the generals at the battle of Barnet.] and Sir Thomas Dymoke from Lincolnshire, and the Knight of Lytton, with his hardy retainers, from the Peak.  Bold Hilyard waited not far from London, with a host of mingled yeomen and bravos, reduced, as before, to discipline under his own sturdy energies and the military craft of Sir John Coniers.  If London would but hold out till these forces could unite, Edward's destruction was still inevitable."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7726"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 12 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK XII.  THE BATTLE OF BARNET.     CHAPTER I.  A KING IN HIS CITY HOPES TO RECOVER HIS REALM--A WOMAN IN HER CHAMBER FEARS TO FORFEIT HER OWN.  Edward and his army reached St. Alban's.  Great commotion, great joy, were in the Sanctuary of Westminster!  The Jerusalem Chamber, therein, was made the high council-hall of the friends of York.  Great commotion, great terror, were in the city of London.  Timid Master Stokton had been elected mayor; horribly frightened either to side with an Edward or a Henry, timid Master Stokton feigned or fell ill. Sir Thomas Cook, a wealthy and influential citizen, and a member of the House of Commons, had been appointed deputy in his stead.  Sir Thomas Cook took fright also, and ran away.  [Fabyan.]  The power of the city thus fell into the hands of Ureswick, the Recorder, a zealous Yorkist.  Great commotion, great scorn, were in the breasts of the populace, as the Archbishop of York, hoping thereby to rekindle their loyalty, placed King Henry on horseback, and paraded him through the streets from Chepeside to Walbrook, from Walbrook to St. Paul's; for the news of Edward's arrival, and the sudden agitation and excitement it produced on his enfeebled frame, had brought upon the poor king one of the epileptic attacks to which he had been subject from childhood, and which made the cause of his frequent imbecility; and, just recovered from such a fit,--his eyes vacant, his face haggard, his head drooping,--the spectacle of such an antagonist to the vigorous Edward moved only pity in the few and ridicule in the many.  Two thousand Yorkist gentlemen were in the various Sanctuaries; aided and headed by the Earl of Essex, they came forth armed and clamorous, scouring the streets, and shouting, \"King Edward!\" with impunity. Edward's popularity in London was heightened amongst the merchants by prudent reminiscences of the vast debts he had incurred, which his victory only could ever enable him to repay to his good citizens. [Comines.]  The women, always, in such a movement, active partisans, and useful, deserted their hearths to canvass all strong arms and stout hearts for the handsome woman-lover.  [Comines.]  The Yorkist Archbishop of Canterbury did his best with the ecclesiastics, the Yorkist Recorder his best with the flat-caps.  Alwyn, true to his anti-feudal principles, animated all the young freemen to support the merchant-king, the favourer of commerce, the man of his age!  The city authorities began to yield to their own and the general metropolitan predilections.  But still the Archbishop of York had six thousand soldiers at his disposal, and London could be yet saved to Warwick, if the prelate acted with energy and zeal and good faith.  That such was his first intention is clear, from his appeal to the public loyalty in King Henry's procession; but when he perceived how little effect that pageant had produced; when, on re-entering the Bishop of London's palace, he saw before him the guileless, helpless puppet of contending factions, gasping for breath, scarcely able to articulate, the heartless prelate turned away, with a muttered ejaculation of contempt.  \"Clarence had not deserted,\" said he to himself, \"unless he saw greater profit with King Edward!\"  And then he began to commune with himself, and to commune with his brother-prelate of Canterbury; and in the midst of all this commune arrived Catesby, charged with messages to the archbishop from Edward,--messages full of promise and affection on the one hand, of menace and revenge upon the other.  Brief: Warwick's cup of bitterness had not yet been filled; that night the archbishop and the mayor of London met, and the Tower was surrendered to Edward's friends.  The next day Edward and his army entered, amidst the shouts of the populace; rode to St. Paul's, where the archbishop [Sharon Turner.  It is a comfort to think that this archbishop was, two years afterwards, first robbed, and then imprisoned, by Edward IV.; nor did he recover his liberty till a few weeks before his death, in 1476 (five years subsequently to the battle of Barnet).] met him, leading Henry by the hand, again a captive; thence Edward proceeded to Westminster Abbey, and, fresh from his atrocious perjury at York, offered thanksgiving for its success.  The Sanctuary yielded up its royal fugitives, and, in joy and in pomp, Edward led his wife and her new-born babe, with Jacquetta and his elder children, to Baynard's Castle.  The next morning (the third day), true to his promise, Warwick marched towards London with the mighty armament he had now collected.  Treason had done its worst,--the metropolis was surrendered, and King Henry in the Tower.  \"These things considered,\" says the Chronicler, \"the earl saw that all calculations of necessity were brought to this end,--that they must now be committed to the hazard and chance of one battle.\"  [Hall.]  He halted, therefore, at St. Alban's, to rest his troops; and marching thence towards Barnet, pitched his tents on the upland ground, then called the Heath or Chase of Gladsmoor, and waited the coming foe.  Nor did Edward linger long from that stern meeting.  Entering London on the 11th of April, he prepared to quit it on the 13th.  Besides the force he had brought with him, he had now recruits in his partisans from the Sanctuaries and other hiding-places in the metropolis, while London furnished him, from her high-spirited youths, a gallant troop of bow and bill men, whom Alwyn had enlisted, and to whom Edward willingly appointed, as captain, Alwyn himself,--who had atoned for his submission to Henry's restoration by such signal activity on behalf of the young king, whom he associated with the interests of his class, and the weal of the great commercial city, which some years afterwards rewarded his affection by electing him to her chief magistracy.  [Nicholas Alwyn, the representative of that generation which aided the commercial and anti-feudal policy of Edward IV. and Richard III., and welcomed its consummation under their Tudor successor, rose to be Lord Mayor of London in the fifteenth year of the reign of Henry VII.--FABYAN.]  It was on that very day, the 13th of April, some hours before the departure of the York army, that Lord Hastings entered the Tower, to give orders relative to the removal of the unhappy Henry, whom Edward had resolved to take with him on his march.  And as he had so ordered and was about to return, Alwyn, emerging from one of the interior courts, approached him in much agitation, and said thus: \"Pardon me, my lord, if in so grave an hour I recall your attention to one you may haply have forgotten.\"  \"Ah, the poor maiden; but you told me, in the hurried words that we have already interchanged, that she was safe and well.\"  \"Safe, my lord,--not well.  Oh, hear me.  I depart to battle for your cause and your king's.  A gentleman in your train has advised me that you are married to a noble dame in the foreign land.  If so, this girl whom I have loved so long and truly may yet forget you, may yet be mine.  Oh, give me that hope to make me a braver soldier.\"  \"But,\" said Hastings, embarrassed, and with a changing countenance, \"but time presses, and I know not where the demoiselle--\"  \"She is here,\" interrupted Alwyn; \"here, within these walls, in yonder courtyard.  I have just left her.  You, whom she loves, forgot her! I, whom she disdains, remembered.  I went to see to her safety, to counsel her to rest here for the present, whatever betides; and at every word I said, she broke in upon me with but one name,--that name was thine!  And when stung, and in the impulse of the moment, I exclaimed, 'He deserves not this devotion.  They tell me, Sibyll, that Lord Hastings has found a wife in exile.'  Oh, that look! that cry! they haunt me still.  'Prove it, prove it, Alwyn,' she cried.  'And--' I interrupted, 'and thou couldst yet, for thy father's sake, be true wife to me?'\"  \"Her answer, Alwyn?\"  \"It was this, 'For my father's sake only, then, could I live on; and--' her sobs stopped her speech, till she cried again, 'I believe it not! thou hast deceived me.  Only from his lips will I hear the sentence.' Go to her, manfully and frankly, as becomes you, high lord,--go!  It Is but a single sentence thou hast to say, and thy heart will be the lighter, and thine arm the stronger for those honest words.\"  Hastings pulled his cap over his brow, and stood a moment as if in reflection; he then said, \"Show me the way; thou art right.  It is due to her and to thee; and as by this hour to-morrow my soul may stand before the Judgment-seat, that poor child's pardon may take one sin from the large account.\"     CHAPTER II.  SHARP IS THE KISS OF THE FALCON'S BEAR.  Hastings stood in the presence of the girl to whom he had pledged his truth.  They were alone; but in the next chamber might be heard the peculiar sound made by the mechanism of the Eureka.  Happy and lifeless mechanism, which moves, and toils, and strives on, to change the destiny of millions, but hath neither ear nor eye, nor sense nor heart,--the avenues of pain to man!  She had--yes, literally--she had recognized her lover's step upon the stair, she had awakened at once from that dull and icy lethargy with which the words of Alwyn had chained life and soul.  She sprang forward as Hastings entered; she threw herself in delirious joy upon his bosom.  \"Thou art come, thou art!  It is not true, not true.  Heaven bless thee! thou art come!\" But sudden as the movement was the recoil.  Drawing herself back, she gazed steadily on his face, and said, \"Lord Hastings, they tell me thy hand is another's.  Is it true?\"  \"Hear me!\" answered the nobleman.  \"When first I--\"  \"O God! O God! he answers not, he falters!  Speak!  Is it true?\"  \"It is true.  I am wedded to another.\"  Sibyll did not fall to the ground, nor faint, nor give vent to noisy passion.  But the rich colour, which before had"]]]
