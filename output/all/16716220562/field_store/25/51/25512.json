Occupied with her own dreams, Sibyll respected those of her father; and so in silence, not altogether mournful, the morning and the noon passed, and the sun was sloping westward, when a confused sound below called Sibyll's gaze to the lattice, which looked over the balustrade of the staircase into the vast yard.  She saw several armed men, their harness hewed and battered, quaffing ale or wine in haste, and heard one of them say to the landlord,--  \"All is lost!  Sir Geoffrey Gates still holds out, but it is butcher work.  The troops of Lord Hastings gather round him as a net round the fish!\"  Hastings!--that name!--he was at hand! he was near! they would be saved!  Sibyll's heart beat loudly.  \"And the captain?\" asked Porpustone.  \"Alive, when I last saw him; but we must be off.  In another hour all will be hurry and skurry, flight and chase.\"  At this moment from one of the barns there emerged, one by one, the female vultures of the battle.  The tymbesteres, who had tramped all night to the spot, had slept off their fatigue during the day, and appeared on the scene as the neighbouring strife waxed low, and the dead and dying began to cumber the gory ground.  Graul Skellet, tossing up her timbrel, darted to the fugitives and grinned a ghastly grin when she heard the news,-- for the tymbesteres were all loyal to a king who loved women, and who had a wink and a jest for every tramping wench!  The troopers tarried not, however, for further converse, but, having satisfied their thirst, hurried and clattered from the yard.  At the sight of the ominous tymbesteres Sibyll had drawn back, without daring to close the lattice she had opened; and the women, seating themselves on a bench, began sleeking their long hair and smoothing their garments from the scraps of straw and litter which betokened the nature of their resting-place.  \"Ho, girls!\" said the fat landlord, \"ye will pay me for board and bed, I trust, by a show of your craft.  I have two right worshipful lodgers up yonder, whose lattice looks on the yard, and whom ye may serve to divert.\"  Sibyll trembled, and crept to her father's side.  \"And,\" continued the landlord, \"if they like the clash of your musicals, it may bring ye a groat or so, to help ye on your journey. By the way, whither wend ye, wenches?\"  \"To a bonny, jolly fair,\" answered the sinister voice of Graul,--      \"Where a mighty SHOWMAN dyes        The greenery into red;      Where, presto! at the word        Lies his Fool without a head;      Where he gathers in the crowd        To the trumpet and the drum,      With a jingle and a tinkle,        Graul's merry lasses come!\"  As the two closing lines were caught by the rest of the tymbesteres, striking their timbrels, the crew formed themselves into a semicircle, and commenced their dance.  Their movements, though wanton and fantastic, were not without a certain wild grace; and the address with which, from time to time, they cast up their instruments and caught them in descending, joined to the surprising agility with which, in the evolutions of the dance, one seemed now to chase, now to fly from, the other, darting to and fro through the ranks of her companions, winding and wheeling,--the chain now seemingly broken in disorder, now united link to link, as the whole force of the instruments clashed in chorus,--made an exhibition inexpressibly attractive to the vulgar.  The tymbesteres, however, as may well be supposed, failed to draw Sibyll or Warner to the window; and they exchanged glances of spite and disappointment.  \"Marry,\" quoth the landlord, after a hearty laugh at the diversion, \"I do wrong to be so gay, when so many good friends perhaps are lying stark and cold.  But what then?  Life is short,--laugh while we can!\"  \"Hist!\" whispered his housekeeper; \"art wode, Ned?  Wouldst thou have it discovered that thou hast such quality birds in the cage--noble Yorkists--at the very time when Lord Hastings himself may be riding this way after the victory?\"  \"Always right, Meg,--and I'm an ass!\" answered the host, in the same undertone.  \"But my good nature will be the death of me some day. Poor gentlefolks, they must be unked dull, yonder!\"  \"If the Yorkists come hither,--which we shall soon know by the scouts,--we must shift Sir John and the damsel to the back of the house, over thy tap-room.\"  \"Manage it as thou wilt, Meg; but thou seest they keep quiet and snug. Ho, ho, ho! that tall tymbestere is supple enough to make an owl hold his sides with laughing.  Ah! hollo, there, tymbesteres, ribaudes, tramps, the devil's chickens,--down, down!\"  The host was too late in his order.  With a sudden spring, Graul, who had long fixed her eye on the open lattice of the prisoners, had wreathed herself round one of the pillars that supported the stairs, swung lightly over the balustrade; and with a faint shriek the startled Sibyll beheld the tymbestere's hard, fierce eyes, glaring upon her through the lattice, as her long arm extended the timbrel for largess.  But no sooner had Sibyll raised her face than she was recognized.  \"Ho, the wizard and the wizard's daughter!  Ho, the girl who glamours lords, and wears sarcenet and lawn!  Ho, the nigromancer who starves the poor!\"  At the sound of their leader's cry, up sprang, up climbed the hellish sisters!  One after the other, they darted through the lattice into the chamber.  \"The ronions! the foul fiend has distraught them!\" groaned the landlord, motionless with astonishment; but the more active Meg, calling to the varlets and scullions, whom the tymbesteres had collected in the yard, to follow her, bounded up the stairs, unlocked the door, and arrived in time to throw herself between the captives and the harpies, whom Sibyll's rich super-tunic and Adam's costly gown had inflamed into all the rage of appropriation.  \"What mean ye, wretches?\" cried the bold Meg, purple with anger.  \"Do ye come for this into honest folk's hostelries, to rob their guests in broad day--noble guests--guests of mark!  Oh, Sir John!  Sir John! what will ye think of us?\"  \"Oh, Sir John! Sir John!\" groaned the landlord, who had now moved his slow bulk into the room.  \"They shall be scourged, Sir John!  They shall be put in the stocks, they shall be brent with hot iron, they--\"  \"Ha, ha!\" interrupted the terrible Graul, \"guests of mark! noble guests, trow ye!  Adam Warner, the wizard, and his daughter, whom we drove last night from their den, as many a time, sisters, and many, we have driven the rats from charnel and cave.\"  \"Wizard!  Adam!  Blood of my life!\" stammered the landlord, \"is his name Adam after all?\"  \"My name is Adam Warner,\" said the old man, with dignity, \"no wizard-- a humble scholar, and a poor gentleman, who has injured no one. Wherefore, women--if women ye are--would ye injure mine and me?\"  \"Faugh, wizard!\" returned Graul, folding her arms.  \"Didst thou not send thy spawn, yonder, to spoil our mart with her gittern?  Hast thou not taught her the spells to win love from the noble and young?  Ho, how daintily the young witch robes herself!  Ho, laces and satins, and we shiver with the cold, and parch with the heat--and--doff thy tunic, minion!\"  And Graul's fierce gripe was on the robe, when the landlord interposed his huge arm, and held her at bay.  \"Softly, my sucking dove, softly!  Clear the room and be off!\"  \"Look to thyself, man.  If thou harbourest a wizard against law,--a wizard whom King Edward hath given up to the people,--look to thy barns,--they shall burn; look to thy cattle,--they shall rot; look to thy secrets,--they shall be told.  Lancastrian, thou shalt hang!  We go! we go!  We have friends amongst the mailed men of York.  We go,-- we will return!  Woe to thee, if thou harbourest the wizard and the succuba!\"  With that Graul moved slowly to the door.  Host and housekeeper, varlet, groom, and scullion made way for her in terror; and still, as she moved, she kept her eyes on Sibyll, till her sisters, following in successive file, shut out the hideous aspect: and Meg, ordering away her gaping train, closed the door.  The host and the housekeeper then gazed gravely at each other.  Sibyll lay in her father's arms breathing hard and convulsively.  The old man's face bent over her in silence.  Meg drew aside her master.  \"You must rid the house at once of these folks.  I have heard talk of yon tymbesteres; they are awsome in spite and malice.  Every man to himself!\"  \"But the poor old gentleman, so mild, and the maid, so winsome!\"  The last remark did not over-please the comely Meg.  She advanced at once to Adam, and said shortly,--  \"Master, whether wizard or not is no affair of a poor landlord, whose house is open to all; but ye have had food and wine,--please to pay the reckoning, and God speed ye; ye are free to depart.\"  \"We can pay you, mistress!\" exclaimed Sibyll, springing up.  \"We have moneys yet.  Here, here!\" and she took from her gipsire the broad pieces which poor Madge's precaution had placed therein, and which the bravoes had fortunately spared.  The sight of the gold somewhat softened the housewife.  \"Lord Hastings is known to us,\" continued Sibyll, perceiving the impression she had made; \"suffer us to rest here till he pass this way, and ye will find yourselves repaid for the kindness.\"  \"By my troth,\" said the landlord, \"ye are most welcome to all my poor house containeth; and as for these tymbesteres, I value them not a straw.  No one can say Ned Porpustone is an ill man or inhospitable. Whoever can pay reasonably is sure of good wine and civility at the Talbot.\"  With these and many similar protestations and assurances, which were less heartily re-echoed by"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7724"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 10 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK X.  THE RETURN OF THE KING-MAKER.     CHAPTER I.  THE MAID'S HOPE, THE COURTIER'S LOVE, AND THE SAGE'S COMFORT.  Fair are thy fields, O England; fair the rural farm and the orchards in which the blossoms have ripened into laughing fruits; and fairer than all, O England, the faces of thy soft-eyed daughters!  From the field where Sibyll and her father had wandered amidst the dead, the dismal witnesses of war had vanished; and over the green pastures roved the gentle flocks.  And the farm to which Hastings had led the wanderers looked upon that peaceful field through its leafy screen; and there father and daughter had found a home.  It was a lovely summer evening; and Sibyll put aside the broidery frame, at which, for the last hour, she had not worked, and gliding to the lattice, looked wistfully along the winding lane.  The room was in the upper story, and was decorated with a care which the exterior of the house little promised, and which almost approached to elegance. The fresh green rushes that strewed the floor were intermingled with dried wild thyme and other fragrant herbs.  The bare walls were hung with serge of a bright and cheerful blue; a rich carpet de cuir covered the oak table, on which lay musical instruments, curiously inlaid, with a few manuscripts, chiefly of English and Provencal poetry.  The tabourets were covered with cushions of Norwich worsted, in gay colours.  All was simple, it is true, yet all betokened a comfort--ay, a refinement, an evidence of wealth--very rare in the houses even of the second order of nobility.  As Sibyll gazed, her face suddenly brightened; she uttered a joyous cry, hurried from the room, descended the stairs, and passed her father, who was seated without the porch, and seemingly plunged in one of his most abstracted reveries.  She kissed his brow (he heeded her not), bounded with a light step over the sward of the orchard, and pausing by a wicket gate, listened with throbbing heart to the advancing sound of a horse's hoofs.  Nearer came the sound, and nearer.  A cavalier appeared in sight, sprang from his saddle, and, leaving his palfrey to find his way to the well-known stable, sprang lightly over the little gate.  \"And thou hast watched for me, Sibyll?\"  The girl blushingly withdrew from the eager embrace, and said touchingly, \"My heart watcheth for thee alway.  Oh, shall I thank or chide thee for so much care?  Thou wilt see how thy craftsmen have changed the rugged homestead into the daintiest bower!\"  \"Alas! my Sibyll! would that it were worthier of thy beauty, and our mutual troth!  Blessings on thy trust and sweet patience; may the day soon come when I may lead thee to a nobler home, and hear knight and baron envy the bride of Hastings!\"  \"My own lord!\" said Sibyll, with grateful tears in confiding eyes; but, after a pause, she added timidly, \"Does the king still bear so stern a memory against so humble a subject?\"  \"The king is more wroth than before, since tidings of Lord Warwick's restless machinations in France have soured his temper.  He cannot hear thy name without threats against thy father as a secret adherent of Lancaster, and accuseth thee of witching his chamberlain,--as, in truth, thou hast. The Duchess of Bedford is more than ever under the influence of Friar Bungey, to whose spells and charms, and not to our good swords, she ascribes the marvellous flight of Warwick and the dispersion of our foes; and the friar, methinks, has fostered and yet feeds Edward's suspicions of thy harmless father.  The king chides himself for having suffered poor Warner to depart unscathed, and even recalls the disastrous adventure of the mechanical, and swears that from the first thy father was in treasonable conspiracy with Margaret. Nay, sure I am, that if I dared to wed thee while his anger lasts, he would condemn thee as a sorceress, and give me up to the secret hate of my old foes the Woodvilles.  But fie! be not so appalled, my Sibyll; Edward's passions, though fierce, are changeful, and patience will reward us both.\"  \"Meanwhile, thou lovest me, Hastings!\" said Sibyll, with great emotion.  \"Oh, if thou knewest how I torment myself in thine absence! I see thee surrounded by the fairest and the loftiest, and say to myself, 'Is it possible that he can remember me?'  But thou lovest me still--still--still, and ever!  Dost thou not?\"  And Hastings said and swore.  \"And the Lady Bonville?\" asked Sibyll, trying to smile archly, but with the faltering tone of jealous fear.  \"I have not seen her for months,\" replied the noble, with a slight change of countenance.  \"She is at one of their western manors.  They say her lord is sorely ill; and the Lady Bonville is a devout hypocrite, and plays the tender wife.  But enough of such ancient and worn-out memories.  Thy father--sorrows he still for his Eureka?  I can learn no trace of it.\"  \"See,\" said Sibyll, recalled to her filial love, and pointing to Warner as they now drew near the house, \"see, he shapes another Eureka from his thoughts!\"  \"How fares it, dear Warner?\" asked the noble, taking the scholar's hand.  \"Ah,\" cried the student, roused at the sight of his powerful protector, \"bringest thou tidings of IT?  Thy cheerful eye tells me that--no--no--thy face changes!  They have destroyed it!  Oh, that I could be young once more!\"  \"What!\" said the world-wise man, astonished.  \"If thou hadst another youth, wouldst thou cherish the same delusion, and go again through a life of hardship, persecution, and wrong?\"  \"My noble son,\" said the philosopher, \"for hours when I have felt the wrong, the persecution, and the hardship, count the days and the nights when I felt only the hope and the glory and the joy!  God is kinder to us all than man can know; for man looks only to the sorrow on the surface, and sees not the consolation in the deeps of the unwitnessed soul.\"  Sibyll had left Hastings by her father's side, and tripped lightly to the farther part of the house, inhabited by the rustic owners who supplied the homely service, to order the evening banquet,--the happy banquet; for hunger gives not such flavour to the viand, nor thirst such sparkle to the wine, as the presence of a beloved guest.  And as the courtier seated himself on the rude settle under the honeysuckles that wreathed the porch, a delicious calm stole over his sated mind.  The pure soul of the student, released a while from the tyranny of an earthly pursuit,--the drudgery of a toil, that however grand, still but ministered to human and material science,--had found for its only other element the contemplation of more solemn and eternal mysteries.  Soaring naturally, as a bird freed from a golden cage, into the realms of heaven, he began now, with earnest and spiritual eloquence, to talk of the things and visions lately made familiar to his thoughts.  Mounting from philosophy to religion, he indulged in his large ideas upon life and nature: of the stars that now came forth in heaven; of the laws that gave harmony to the universe; of the evidence of a God in the mechanism of creation; of the spark from central divinity, that, kindling in a man's soul, we call \"genius;\" of the eternal resurrection of the dead, which makes the very principle of being, and types, in the leaf and in the atom, the immortality of the great human race.  He was sublimer, that gray old man, hunted from the circle of his kind, in his words, than ever is action in its deeds; for words can fathom truth, and deeds but blunderingly and lamely seek it.  And the sad and gifted and erring intellect of Hastings, rapt from its little ambition of the hour, had no answer when his heart asked, \"What can courts and a king's smile give me in exchange for serene tranquillity and devoted love?\"     CHAPTER II.  THE MAN AWAKES IN THE SAGE, AND THE SHE-WOLF AGAIN HATH TRACKED THE LAMB.  From the night in which Hastings had saved from the knives of the tymbesteres Sibyll and her father, his honour and chivalry had made him their protector.  The people of the farm (a widow and her children, with the peasants in their employ) were kindly and simple folks.  What safer home for the wanderers than that to which Hastings had removed them?  The influence of Sibyll over his variable heart or fancy was renewed.  Again vows were interchanged and faith plighted. Anthony Woodville, Lord Rivers, who, however gallant an enemy, was still more than ever, since Warwick's exile, a formidable one, and who shared his sister's dislike to Hastings, was naturally at that time in the fullest favour of King Edward, anxious to atone for the brief disgrace his brother-in-law had suffered during the later days of Warwick's administration.  And Hastings, offended by the manners of the rival favourite, took one of the disgusts so frequent in the life of a courtier, and, despite his office of chamberlain, absented himself much from his sovereign's company.  Thus, in the reaction of his mind, the influence of Sibyll was greater than it otherwise might have been.  His visits to the farm were regular and frequent.  The widow believed him nearly related to Sibyll, and suspected Warner to be some attainted Lancastrian, compelled to hide in secret till his pardon was obtained; and no scandal was attached to the noble's visits, nor any surprise evinced at his attentive care for all that could lend a grace to a temporary refuge unfitting the quality of his supposed kindred.  And, in her entire confidence and reverential affection, Sibyll's very pride was rather soothed than wounded by obligations which were but proofs of love, and to which plighted troth gave her a sweet right. As for Warner, he had hitherto seemed to regard the great lord's attentions only as a tribute to his own science, and a testimony of the interest which a statesman might naturally feel in the invention of a thing that might benefit the realm.  And Hastings had been delicate in the pretexts of his"]]]
