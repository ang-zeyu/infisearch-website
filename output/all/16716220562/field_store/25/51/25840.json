That made the baby clap his hands; and that, and his looking as if he had a comic toothache, made all the princes and princesses laugh.  So the Princess Alicia said, ‘Laugh and be good; and after dinner we will make him a nest on the floor in a corner, and he shall sit in his nest and see a dance of eighteen cooks.’  That delighted the young princes and princesses, and they ate up all the broth, and washed up all the plates and dishes, and cleared away, and pushed the table into a corner; and then they in their cooks’ caps, and the Princess Alicia in the smothering coarse apron that belonged to the cook that had run away with her own true love that was the very tall but very tipsy soldier, danced a dance of eighteen cooks before the angelic baby, who forgot his swelled face and his black eye, and crowed with joy.  And so then, once more the Princess Alicia saw King Watkins the First, her father, standing in the doorway looking on, and he said, ‘What have you been doing, Alicia?’  ‘Cooking and contriving, papa.’  ‘What else have you been doing, Alicia?’  ‘Keeping the children light-hearted, papa.’  ‘Where is the magic fish-bone, Alicia?  ‘In my pocket, papa.’  ‘I thought you had lost it?’  ‘O, no, papa!’  ‘Or forgotten it?’  ‘No, indeed, papa.’  The king then sighed so heavily, and seemed so low-spirited, and sat down so miserably, leaning his head upon his hand, and his elbow upon the kitchen-table pushed away in the corner, that the seventeen princes and princesses crept softly out of the kitchen, and left him alone with the Princess Alicia and the angelic baby.  ‘What is the matter, papa?’  ‘I am dreadfully poor, my child.’  ‘Have you no money at all, papa?’  ‘None, my child.’  ‘Is there no way of getting any, papa?’  ‘No way,’ said the king.  ‘I have tried very hard, and I have tried all ways.’  When she heard those last words, the Princess Alicia began to put her hand into the pocket where she kept the magic fish-bone.  ‘Papa,’ said she, ‘when we have tried very hard, and tried all ways, we must have done our very, very best?’  ‘No doubt, Alicia.’  ‘When we have done our very, very best, papa, and that is not enough, then I think the right time must have come for asking help of others.’ This was the very secret connected with the magic fish-bone, which she had found out for herself from the good Fairy Grandmarina’s words, and which she had so often whispered to her beautiful and fashionable friend, the duchess.  So she took out of her pocket the magic fish-bone, that had been dried and rubbed and polished till it shone like mother-of-pearl; and she gave it one little kiss, and wished it was quarter-day.  And immediately it _was_ quarter-day; and the king’s quarter’s salary came rattling down the chimney, and bounced into the middle of the floor.  But this was not half of what happened,—no, not a quarter; for immediately afterwards the good Fairy Grandmarina came riding in, in a carriage and four (peacocks), with Mr. Pickles’s boy up behind, dressed in silver and gold, with a cocked-hat, powdered-hair, pink silk stockings, a jewelled cane, and a nosegay.  Down jumped Mr. Pickles’s boy, with his cocked-hat in his hand, and wonderfully polite (being entirely changed by enchantment), and handed Grandmarina out; and there she stood, in her rich shot-silk smelling of dried lavender, fanning herself with a sparkling fan.  ‘Alicia, my dear,’ said this charming old fairy, ‘how do you do?  I hope I see you pretty well?  Give me a kiss.’  The Princess Alicia embraced her; and then Grandmarina turned to the king, and said rather sharply, ‘Are you good?’  The king said he hoped so.  ‘I suppose you know the reason _now_, why my god-daughter here,’ kissing the princess again, ‘did not apply to the fish-bone sooner?’ said the fairy.  The king made a shy bow.  ‘Ah! but you didn’t _then_?’ said the fairy.  The king made a shyer bow.  ‘Any more reasons to ask for?’ said the fairy.  The king said, No, and he was very sorry.  ‘Be good, then,’ said the fairy, ‘and live happy ever afterwards.’  Then Grandmarina waved her fan, and the queen came in most splendidly dressed; and the seventeen young princes and princesses, no longer grown out of their clothes, came in, newly fitted out from top to toe, with tucks in everything to admit of its being let out.  After that, the fairy tapped the Princess Alicia with her fan; and the smothering coarse apron flew away, and she appeared exquisitely dressed, like a little bride, with a wreath of orange-flowers and a silver veil.  After that, the kitchen dresser changed of itself into a wardrobe, made of beautiful woods and gold and looking glass, which was full of dresses of all sorts, all for her and all exactly fitting her.  After that, the angelic baby came in, running alone, with his face and eye not a bit the worse, but much the better.  Then Grandmarina begged to be introduced to the duchess; and, when the duchess was brought down, many compliments passed between them.  A little whispering took place between the fairy and the duchess; and then the fairy said out loud, ‘Yes, I thought she would have told you.’ Grandmarina then turned to the king and queen, and said, ‘We are going in search of Prince Certainpersonio.  The pleasure of your company is requested at church in half an hour precisely.’  So she and the Princess Alicia got into the carriage; and Mr. Pickles’s boy handed in the duchess, who sat by herself on the opposite seat; and then Mr. Pickles’s boy put up the steps and got up behind, and the peacocks flew away with their tails behind.  Prince Certainpersonio was sitting by himself, eating barley-sugar, and waiting to be ninety.  When he saw the peacocks, followed by the carriage, coming in at the window it immediately occurred to him that something uncommon was going to happen.  ‘Prince,’ said Grandmarina, ‘I bring you your bride.’  The moment the fairy said those words, Prince Certainpersonio’s face left off being sticky, and his jacket and corduroys changed to peach-bloom velvet, and his hair curled, and a cap and feather flew in like a bird and settled on his head.  He got into the carriage by the fairy’s invitation; and there he renewed his acquaintance with the duchess, whom he had seen before.  In the church were the prince’s relations and friends, and the Princess Alicia’s relations and friends, and the seventeen princes and princesses, and the baby, and a crowd of the neighbours.  The marriage was beautiful beyond expression.  The duchess was bridesmaid, and beheld the ceremony from the pulpit, where she was supported by the cushion of the desk.  Grandmarina gave a magnificent wedding-feast afterwards, in which there was everything and more to eat, and everything and more to drink.  The wedding-cake was delicately ornamented with white satin ribbons, frosted silver, and white lilies, and was forty-two yards round.  When Grandmarina had drunk her love to the young couple, and Prince Certainpersonio had made a speech, and everybody had cried, Hip, hip, hip, hurrah! Grandmarina announced to the king and queen that in future there would be eight quarter-days in every year, except in leap-year, when there would be ten.  She then turned to Certainpersonio and Alicia, and said, ‘My dears, you will have thirty-five children, and they will all be good and beautiful.  Seventeen of your children will be boys, and eighteen will be girls.  The hair of the whole of your children will curl naturally.  They will never have the measles, and will have recovered from the whooping-cough before being born.’  On hearing such good news, everybody cried out ‘Hip, hip, hip, hurrah!’ again.  ‘It only remains,’ said Grandmarina in conclusion, ‘to make an end of the fish-bone.’  So she took it from the hand of the Princess Alicia, and it instantly flew down the throat of the dreadful little snapping pug-dog, next door, and choked him, and he expired in convulsions.     PART III. ROMANCE.  FROM THE PEN OF LIEUT.-COL. ROBIN REDFORTH {266}   THE subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age.  We find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns loaded to the muzzle, ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday.  It seems that our hero, considering himself spited by a Latin-grammar master, demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another.—Not getting it, he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company, bought a second-hand pocket-pistol, folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag, made a bottle of Spanish liquorice-water, and entered on a career of valour.  It were tedious to follow Boldheart (for such was his name) through the commencing stages of his story.  Suffice it, that we find him bearing the rank of Capt. Boldheart, reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearth-rug spread out upon the quarter-deck of his schooner ‘The Beauty,’ in the China seas.  It was a lovely evening; and, as his crew lay grouped about him, he favoured them with the following melody:      O landsmen are folly!     O pirates are jolly!     O diddleum Dolly,                    Di!               _Chorus_.—Heave yo.  The soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters, as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of Boldheart, may be more easily conceived than described.  It was under these circumstances that the look-out at the masthead gave the word, ‘Whales!’  All was now activity.  ‘Where away?’ cried Capt. Boldheart, starting up.  ‘On the larboard bow, sir,’ replied the fellow at the masthead, touching his hat.  For such was the height of discipline on board of ‘The Beauty,’ that, even at that height, he was obliged to mind it, or be shot through the head.  ‘This adventure belongs to me,’ said Boldheart.  ‘Boy, my harpoon.  Let no man follow;’ and leaping alone into his boat, the captain rowed with admirable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/809"],["title","Holiday Romance (#4)"],["body","in the direction of the monster.  All was now excitement.  ‘He nears him!’ said an elderly seaman, following the captain through his spy-glass.  ‘He strikes him!’ said another seaman, a mere stripling, but also with a spy-glass.  ‘He tows him towards us!’ said another seaman, a man in the full vigour of life, but also with a spy-glass.  In fact, the captain was seen approaching, with the huge bulk following. We will not dwell on the deafening cries of ‘Boldheart! Boldheart!’ with which he was received, when, carelessly leaping on the quarter-deck, he presented his prize to his men.  They afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it.  Ordering the sail to be braced up, the captain now stood W.N.W.  ‘The Beauty’ flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters.  Nothing particular occurred for a fortnight, except taking, with considerable slaughter, four Spanish galleons, and a snow from South America, all richly laden.  Inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men.  Capt. Boldheart called all hands aft, and said, ‘My lads, I hear there are discontented ones among ye.  Let any such stand forth.’  After some murmuring, in which the expressions, ‘Ay, ay, sir!’  ‘Union Jack,’ ‘Avast,’ ‘Starboard,’ ‘Port,’ ‘Bowsprit,’ and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent, though subdued, were audible, Bill Boozey, captain of the foretop, came out from the rest.  His form was that of a giant, but he quailed under the captain’s eye.  ‘What are your wrongs?’ said the captain.  ‘Why, d’ye see, Capt. Boldheart,’ replied the towering manner, ‘I’ve sailed, man and boy, for many a year, but I never yet know’d the milk served out for the ship’s company’s teas to be so sour as ‘tis aboard this craft.’  At this moment the thrilling cry, ‘Man overboard!’ announced to the astonished crew that Boozey, in stepping back, as the captain (in mere thoughtfulness) laid his hand upon the faithful pocket-pistol which he wore in his belt, had lost his balance, and was struggling with the foaming tide.  All was now stupefaction.  But with Capt. Boldheart, to throw off his uniform coat, regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated, and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant, was the work of a moment.  Maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered; intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth; deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of ‘The Beauty.’ And, from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones, Capt. Boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as William Boozey.  Boldheart now pointed to the horizon, and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort.  ‘She shall be ours at sunrise,’ said he.  ‘Serve out a double allowance of grog, and prepare for action.’  All was now preparation.  When morning dawned, after a sleepless night, it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle.  As the two ships came nearer to each other, the stranger fired a gun and hoisted Roman colours.  Boldheart then perceived her to be the Latin-grammar master’s bark.  Such indeed she was, and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit, from the time of his first taking to a roving life.  Boldheart now addressed his men, promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it, and giving orders that the Latin-grammar master should be taken alive.  He then dismissed them to their quarters, and the fight began with a broadside from ‘The Beauty.’  She then veered around, and poured in another.  ‘The Scorpion’ (so was the bark of the Latin-grammar master appropriately called) was not slow to return her fire; and a terrific cannonading ensued, in which the guns of ‘The Beauty’ did tremendous execution.  The Latin-grammar master was seen upon the poop, in the midst of the smoke and fire, encouraging his men.  To do him justice, he was no craven, though his white hat, his short gray trousers, and his long snuff-coloured surtout reaching to his heels (the self-same coat in which he had spited Boldheart), contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter.  At this moment, Boldheart, seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men, gave the word to board.  A desperate conflict ensued in the hammock-nettings,—or somewhere in about that direction,—until the Latin-grammar master, having all his masts gone, his hull and rigging shot through, and seeing Boldheart slashing a path towards him, hauled down his flag himself, gave up his sword to Boldheart, and asked for quarter.  Scarce had he been put into the captain’s boat, ere ‘The Scorpion’ went down with all on board.  On Capt. Boldheart’s now assembling his men, a circumstance occurred.  He found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook, who, having lost his brother in the late action, was making at the Latin-grammar master in an infuriated state, intent on his destruction with a carving-knife.  Capt. Boldheart then turned to the Latin-grammar master, severely reproaching him with his perfidy, and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved.  They answered with one voice, ‘Death.’  ‘It may be so,’ said the captain; ‘but it shall never be said that Boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy. Prepare the cutter.’  The cutter was immediately prepared.  ‘Without taking your life,’ said the captain, ‘I must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys.  I shall turn you adrift in this boat.  You will find in her two oars, a compass, a bottle of rum, a small cask of water, a piece of pork, a bag of biscuit, and my Latin grammar.  Go! and spite the natives, if you can find any.’  Deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm, the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter, and was soon left far behind.  He made no effort to row, but was seen lying on his back with his legs up, when last made out by the ship’s telescopes.  A stiff breeze now beginning to blow, Capt. Boldheart gave orders to keep her S.S.W., easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two W. by W., or even by W.S., if she complained much.  He then retired for the night, having in truth much need of repose.  In addition to the fatigues he had undergone, this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement, but had not mentioned it.  In the morning a white squall came on, and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours.  It thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks. Hurricanes then set in for two months.  Waterspouts and tornadoes followed.  The oldest sailor on board—and he was a very old one—had never seen such weather.  ‘The Beauty’ lost all idea where she was, and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold.  Everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day.  Provisions now ran very low.  Our hero put the crew on short allowance, and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship.  But his spirit kept him fat.  In this extremity, the gratitude of Boozey, the captain of the foretop, whom our readers may remember, was truly affecting.  The loving though lowly William repeatedly requested to be killed, and preserved for the captain’s table.  We now approach a change of affairs.  One day during a gleam of sunshine, and when the weather had moderated, the man at the masthead—too weak now to touch his hat, besides its having been blown away—called out,  ‘Savages!’  All was now expectation.  Presently fifteen hundred canoes, each paddled by twenty savages, were seen advancing in excellent order.  They were of a light green colour (the savages were), and sang, with great energy, the following strain:      Choo a choo a choo tooth.        Muntch, muntch.  Nycey!     Choo a choo a choo tooth.        Muntch, muntch.  Nycey!  As the shades of night were by this time closing in, these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people’s views of the evening hymn. But it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of ‘For what we are going to receive,’ &c.  The chief, imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours, and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot, no sooner understood (he understood English perfectly) that the ship was ‘The Beauty,’ Capt. Boldheart, than he fell upon his face on the deck, and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up, and told him he wouldn’t hurt him.  All the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror, and had also to be lifted up one by one.  Thus the fame of the great Boldheart had gone before him, even among these children of Nature.  Turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers; and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal.  After dinner the chief told Capt. Boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village, and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there.  Apprehensive of treachery, Boldheart ordered his boat’s crew to attend him completely armed.  And well were it for other commanders if their precautions—but let us not anticipate.  When the canoes arrived at the beach, the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire.  Ordering his boat’s crew (with the intrepid though illiterate William at their head) to keep close and be upon their guard, Boldheart bravely went on, arm in arm with the chief.  But how to depict the captain’s surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of ‘For what we are going to receive,’ &c., which has been given above, and dancing hand in hand round the Latin-grammar master, in a hamper with his head shaved, while two savages floured him, before putting him to the fire to be cooked!  Boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to"]]]
