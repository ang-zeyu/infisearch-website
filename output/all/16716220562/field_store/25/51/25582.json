She touched briefly on her confidential intimacy with Madame Marigny, the exchange of name and papers, her confinement in the neighbourhood of Aix, the child left to the care of the nurse, the journey to Munich to find the false Louise Duval was no more.  The documents obtained through the agency of her easy-tempered kinsman, the late Marquis de Rochebriant, and her subsequent domestication in the house of the von Rudesheims,--all this it is needless to do more here than briefly recapitulate.  The letter then went on: \"While thus kindly treated by the family with whom nominally a governess, I was on the terms of a friend with Signor Ludovico Cicogna, an Italian of noble birth.  He was the only man I ever cared for.  I loved him with frail human passion. I could not tell him, my true history.  I could not tell him that I had a child; such intelligence would have made him renounce me at once.  He had a daughter, still but an infant, by a former marriage, then brought up in France.  He wished to take her to his house, and his second wife to supply the place of her mother.  What was I to do with the child I had left near Aix?  While doubtful and distracted, I read an advertisement in the journals to the effect that a French lady, then staying in Coblentz, wished to adopt a female child not exceeding the age of six: the child to be wholly resigned to her by the parents, she undertaking to rear and provide for it as her own.  I resolved to go to Coblentz at once.  I did so.  I saw this lady.  She seemed in affluent circumstances, yet young, but a confirmed invalid, confined the greater part of the day to her sofa by some malady of the spine.  She told me very frankly her story.  She had been a professional dancer on the stage, had married respectably, quitted the stage, become a widow, and shortly afterwards been seized with the complaint that would probably for life keep her a secluded prisoner in her room.  Thus afflicted, and without tie, interest, or object in the world, she conceived the idea of adopting a child that she might bring up to tend and cherish her as a daughter.  In this, the imperative condition was that the child should never be sought by the parents.  She was pleased by my manner and appearance: she did not wish her adopted daughter to be the child of peasants.  She asked me for no references,--made no inquiries.  She said cordially that she wished for no knowledge that, through any indiscretion of her own, communicated to the child might lead her to seek the discovery of her real parents.  In fine, I left Coblentz on the understanding that I was to bring the infant, and if it pleased Madame Surville, the agreement was concluded.  \"I then repaired to Aix.  I saw the child.  Alas!  unnatural mother that I was, the sight only more vividly brought before me the sense of my own perilous position.  Yet the child was lovely! a likeness of myself, but lovelier far, for it was a pure, innocent, gentle loveliness.  And they told her to call me 'Maman.'  Oh, did I not relent when I heard that name?  No; it jarred on my ear as a word of reproach and shame.  In walking with the infant towards the railway station, imagine my dismay when suddenly I met the man who had been taught to believe me dead.  I soon discovered that his dismay was equal to my own,--that I had nothing to fear from his desire to claim me.  It did occur to me for a moment to resign his child to him.  But when he shrank reluctantly from a half suggestion to that effect, my pride was wounded, my conscience absolved. And, after all, it might be unsafe to my future to leave with him any motive for tracing me.  I left him hastily.  I have never seen nor heard of him more.  I took the child to Coblentz.  Madame Surville was charmed with its prettiness and prattle,--charmed still more when I rebuked the poor infant for calling me 'Maman,' and said, 'Thy real mother is here.' Freed from my trouble, I returned to the kind German roof I had quitted, and shortly after became the wife of Ludovico Cicogna.  \"My punishment soon began.  His was a light, fickle, pleasure-hunting nature.  He soon grew weary of me.  My very love made me unamiable to him.  I became irritable, jealous, exacting.  His daughter, who now came to live with us, was another subject of discord.  I knew that he loved her better than me.  I became a harsh step-mother; and Ludovico's reproaches, vehemently made, nursed all my angriest passions.  But a son of this new marriage was born to myself.  My pretty Luigi! how my heart became wrapt up in him!  Nursing him, I forgot resentment against his father.  Well, poor Cicogna fell ill and died.  I mourned him sincerely; but my boy was left.  Poverty then fell on me,--poverty extreme. Cicogna's sole income was derived from a post in the Austrian dominion in Italy, and ceased with it.  He received a small pension in compensation; that died with him.  \"At this time, an Englishman, with whom Ludovico had made acquaintance in Venice, and who visited often at our house in Verona, offered me his hand.  He had taken an extraordinary liking to Isaura, Cicogna's daughter by his first marriage.  But I think his proposal was dictated partly by compassion for me, and more by affection for her.  For the sake of my boy Luigi I married him.  He was a good man, of retired learned habits with which I had no sympathy.  His companionship overwhelmed me with ennui. But I bore it patiently for Luigi's sake.  God saw that my heart was as much as ever estranged from Him, and He took away my all on earth--my boy.  Then in my desolation I turned to our Holy Church for comfort. I found a friend in the priest, my confessor.  I was startled to learn from him how guilty I had been--was still.  Pushing to an extreme the doctrines of the Church, he would not allow that my first marriage, though null by law, was void in the eyes of Heaven.  Was not the death of the child I so cherished a penalty due to my sin towards the child I had abandoned?  \"These thoughts pressed on me night and day.  With the consent and approval of the good priest, I determined to quit the roof of M. Selby, and to devote myself to the discovery of my forsaken Julie.  \"I had a painful interview with M. Selby.  I announced my intention to separate from him.  I alleged as a reason my conscientious repugnance to live with a professed heretic--an enemy to our Holy Church.  When M. Selby found that he could not shake my resolution, he lent himself to it with the forbearance and generosity which he had always exhibited.  On our marriage he had settled on me five thousand pounds, to be absolutely mine in the event of his death.  He now proposed to concede to me the interest on that capital during his life, and he undertook the charge of my step-daughter Isaura, and secured to her all the rest he had to leave; such landed property as he possessed in England passing to a distant relative.  \"So we parted, not with hostility--tears were shed on both sides.  I set out for Coblentz.  Madame Surville had long since quitted that town, devoting some years to the round of various mineral spas in vain hope of cure.  Not without some difficulty I traced her to her last residence in the neighbourhood of Paris, but she was then no more--her death accelerated by the shock occasioned by the loss of her whole fortune, which she had been induced to place in one of the numerous fraudulent companies by which so many have been ruined.  Julie, who was with her at the time of her death, had disappeared shortly after it--none could tell me whither; but from such hints as I could gather, the poor child, thus left destitute, had been betrayed into sinful courses.  \"Probably I might yet by searching inquiry have found her out; you will say it was my duty at least to institute such inquiry.  No doubt; I now remorsefully feel that it was.  I did not think so at the time.  The Italian priest had given me a few letters of introduction to French ladies with whom, when they had sojourned at Florence, he had made acquaintance.  These ladies were very strict devotees, formal observers of those decorums by which devotion proclaims itself to the world.  They had received me not only with kindness but with marked respect.  They chose to exalt into the noblest self-sacrifice the act of my leaving M. Selby's house.  Exaggerating the simple cause assigned to it in the priest's letter, they represented me as quitting a luxurious home and an idolising husband rather than continue intimate intercourse with the enemy of my religion.  This new sort of flattery intoxicated me with its fumes.  I recoiled from the thought of shattering the pedestal to which I had found myself elevated.  What if I should discover my daughter in one from the touch of whose robe these holy women would recoil as from the rags of a leper!  No; it would be impossible for me to own her-- impossible for me to give her the shelter of my roof.  Nay, if discovered to hold any commune with such an outcast, no explanation, no excuse short of the actual truth, would avail with these austere judges of human error.  And the actual truth would be yet deeper disgrace.  I reasoned away my conscience.  If I looked for example in the circles in which I had obtained reverential place, I could find no instance in which a girl who had fallen from virtue was not repudiated by her nearest relatives. Nay, when I thought of my own mother, had not her father refused to see her, to acknowledge her child, from no other offence than that of a misalliance which wounded the family pride?  That pride, alas! was in my blood--my sole inheritance from the family I sprang from.  \"Thus it went on, till I had grave symptoms of a disease which rendered the duration of my life uncertain.  My conscience awoke and tortured me. I resolved to take the veil.  Vanity and pride again!  My resolution was applauded by those whose opinion had so swayed my mind and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7748"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 12 (#7)"],["body","conduct. Before I retired into the convent from which I write, I made legal provision as to the bulk of the fortune which, by the death of M. Selby, has become absolutely at my disposal.  One thousand pounds amply sufficed for dotation to the convent: the other four thousand pounds are given in trust to the eminent notary, M. Nadaud, Rue -------.  On applying to him, you will find that the sum, with the accumulated interest, is bequeathed to you,--a tribute of gratitude for the assistance you afforded me in the time of your own need, and the kindness with which you acknowledged our relationship and commiserated my misfortunes.  \"But oh, my uncle, find out--a man can do so with a facility not accorded to a woman--what has become of this poor Julie, and devote what you may deem right and just of the sum thus bequeathed to place her above want and temptation.  In doing so, I know you will respect my name: I would not have it dishonour you, indeed.  \"I have been employed in writing this long letter since the day I heard you were in Paris.  It has exhausted the feeble remnants of my strength. It will be given to you before the interview I at once dread and long for, and in that interview you will not rebuke me.  Will you, my kind uncle?  No, you will only soothe and pity!  \"Would that I were worthy to pray for others, that I might add, 'May the Saints have you in their keeping and lead you to faith in the Holy Church, which has power to absolve from sins those who repent as I do.'\"  The letter dropped from Victor's hand.  He took it up, smoothed it mechanically, and with a dim, abstracted, be wildered, pitiful wonder. Well might the _Superieure_ have hesitated to allow confessions, betraying a mind so little regulated by genuine religious faith, to pass into other hands.  Evidently it was the paramount duty of rescuing from want or from sin the writer's forsaken child, that had overborne all other considerations in the mind of the Woman and the Priest she consulted.  Throughout that letter, what a strange perversion of understanding!  what a half-unconscious confusion of wrong and right!--the duty marked out so obvious and so neglected; even the religious sentiment awakened by the conscience so dividing itself from the moral instinct! the dread of being thought less religious by obscure comparative strangers stronger than the moral obligation to discover and reclaim the child for whose errors, if she had erred, the mother who so selfishly forsook her was alone responsible! even at the last, at the approach of death, the love for a name she had never made a self-sacrifice to preserve unstained; and that concluding exhortation,--that reliance on a repentance in which there was so qualified a reparation!  More would Victor de Mauldon have wondered had he known those points of similarity in character, and in the nature of their final bequests, between Louise Duval and the husband she had deserted.  By one of those singular coincidences which, if this work be judged by the ordinary rules presented to the ordinary novel-reader, a critic would not unjustly impute to defective invention in the author, the provision for this child, deprived of its natural parents during their lives, is left to the discretion and honour of trustees, accompanied on the part of the consecrated Louise and \"the blameless King,\" with the injunction of respect to their worldly reputations--two parents so opposite in condition, in creed, in disposition, yet assimilating in that point of individual character in which it touches the wide vague circle of human opinion.  For this, indeed, the excuses of Richard King are strong, inasmuch as the secrecy he sought was for the sake, not of his own memory, but that of her whom the world knew only as his honoured wife. The conduct of Louise admits no such excuse; she dies as she had lived; an Egotist.  But, whatever the motives of the parents, what is the fate of the deserted child?  What revenge does the worldly opinion, which the parents would escape for themselves, inflict on the innocent infant to whom the bulk of their worldly possessions is to be clandestinely conveyed?  Would all the gold of Ophir be compensation enough for her?  Slowly De Mauleon roused himself, and turned from the solitary place where he had been seated to a more crowded part of the ramparts.  He passed a group of young _Moblots_, with flowers wreathed round their gun- barrels.  \"If,\" said one of them gaily, \"Paris wants bread, it never wants flowers.\"  His companions laughed merrily, and burst out into a scurrile song in ridicule of St. Trochu.  Just then an _obus_ fell a few yards before the group.  The sound only for a moment drowned the song, but the splinters struck a man in a coarse, ragged dress, who had stopped to listen to the singers.  At his sharp cry, two men hastened to his side: one was Victor de Mauleon; the other was a surgeon, who quitted another group of idlers--National Guards--attracted by the shriek that summoned his professional aid.  The poor man was terribly wounded.  The surgeon, glancing at De Mauleon, shrugged his shoulders, and muttered, \"Past help!\"  The sufferer turned his haggard eyes on the Vicomte, and gasped out, \"M. de Mauleon?\"  \"That is my name,\" answered Victor, surprised, and not immediately recognising the sufferer.  \"Hist, Jean Lebeau!--look at me: you recollect me now,--Mart le Roux, _concierge_ to the Secret Council.  Ay, I found out who you were long ago --followed you home from the last meeting you broke up.  But I did not betray you, or you would have been murdered long since.  Beware of the old set--beware of--of--\"  Here his voice broke off into shrill exclamations of pain.  Curbing his last agonies with a powerful effort, he faltered forth, \"You owe me a service--see to the little one at home --she is starving.\"  The death-_rale_ came on; in a few moments he was no more.  Victor gave orders for the removal of the corpse, and hurried away.  The surgeon, who had changed countenance when he overheard the name in which the dying man had addressed De Mauleon, gazed silently after De Mauleon's retreating form, and then, also quitting the dead, rejoined the group he had quitted.  Some of those who composed it acquired evil renown later in the war of the Communists, and came to disastrous ends: among that number the Pole Loubinsky and other members of the Secret Council.  The Italian Raselli was there too, but, subtler than his French confreres, he divined the fate of the Communists, and glided from it--safe now in his native land, destined there, no doubt, to the funereal honours and lasting renown which Italy bestows on the dust of her sons who have advocated assassination out of love for the human race.  Amid this group, too, was a National Guard, strayed from his proper post, and stretched on the frozen ground; and, early though the hour, in the profound sleep of intoxication.  \"So,\" said Loubinsky, \"you have found your errand in vain, Citizen le Noy; another victim to the imbecility of our generals.\"  \"And partly one of us,\" replied the Medecin des Pauvres.  \"You remember poor le Roux, who kept the old baraque where the Council of Ten used to meet?  Yonder he lies.\"  \"Don't talk of the Council of Ten.  What fools and dupes we were made by that _vieux gredin_, Jean Lebeau!  How I wish I could meet him again!\"  Gaspard le Noy smiled sarcastically.  \"So much the worse for you, if you did.  A muscular and a ruthless fellow is that Jean Lebeau!\"  Therewith he turned to the drunken sleeper and woke him up with a shake and a kick. \"Armand--Armand Monnier, I say, rise, rub your eyes.  What if you are called to your post?  What if you are shamed as a deserter and a coward?\"  Armand turned, rose with an effort from the recumbent to the sitting posture, and stared dizzily in the face of the _Medecin des Pauvres_.  \"I was dreaming that I had caught by the throat,\" said Armand, wildly, \"the aristo who shot my brother; and lo, there were two men, Victor de Mauleon and Jean Lebeau.\"  \"Ah! there is something in dreams,\" said the surgeon.  \"Once in a thousand times a dream comes true.\"     CHAPTER V.  The time now came when all provision of food or of fuel failed the modest household of Isaura; and there was not only herself and the Venosta to feed and warm--there were the servants whom they had brought from Italy, and had not the heart now to dismiss to the 'certainty of famine.  True, one of the three, the man, had returned to his native land before the commencement of the siege; but the two women had remained.  They supported themselves now as they could on the meagre rations accorded by the Government.  Still Isaura attended the ambulance to which she was attached.  From the ladies associated with her she could readily have obtained ample supplies: but they had no conception of her real state of destitution; and there was a false pride generally prevalent among the respectable classes, which Isaura shared, that concealed distress lest alms should be proffered.  The destitution of the household had been carefully concealed from the parents of Gustave Rameau, until, one day, Madame Rameau, entering at the hour at which she generally, and her husband sometimes, came for a place by the fireside and a seat at the board, found on the one only ashes, on the other a ration of the black nauseous compound which had become the substitute for bread.  Isaura was absent on her duties at the ambulance hospital,--purposely absent, for she shrank from the bitter task of making clear to the friends of her betrothed the impossibility of continuing the aid to their support which their son had neglected to contribute; and still more from the comment which she knew they would make on his conduct, in absenting himself so wholly of late, and in the time of such trial and pressure, both from them and from herself.  Truly, she rejoiced at that absence so far as it affected herself.  Every hour of the day she silently"]]]
