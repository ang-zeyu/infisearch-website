How very fair are the little children of men. It is autumn with all the world, and the stars weep to see it.  \"Therefore no longer be the friend of Time, who will not let us be, and be not good to him but pity us, and let lovely things live on for the sake of our tears.\"  Thus prayed I out of compassion one windy day to the snout-faced idol to whom no one kneeled.     THE SPHINX IN THEBES (MASSACHUSETTS)   There was a woman in a steel-built city who had all that money could buy, she had gold and dividends and trains and houses, and she had pets to play with, but she had no sphinx.  So she besought them to bring her a live sphinx; and therefore they went to the menageries, and then to the forests and the desert places, and yet could find no sphinx.  And she would have been content with a little lion but that one was already owned by a woman she knew; so they had to search the world again for a sphinx.  And still there was none.  But they were not men that it is easy to baffle, and at last they found a sphinx in a desert at evening watching a ruined temple whose gods she had eaten hundreds of years ago when her hunger was on her. And they cast chains on her, who was still with an ominous stillness, and took her westwards with them and brought her home.  And so the sphinx came to the steel-built city.  And the woman was very glad that she owned a sphinx: but the sphinx stared long into her eyes one day, and softly asked a riddle of the woman.  And the woman could not answer, and she died.  And the sphinx is silent again and none knows what she will do.     THE REWARD   One's spirit goes further in dreams than it does by day. Wandering once by night from a factory city I came to the edge of Hell.  The place was foul with cinders and cast-off things, and jagged, half-buried things with shapeless edges, and there was a huge angel with a hammer building in plaster and steel. I wondered what he did in that dreadful place. I hesitated, then asked him what he was building. \"We are adding to Hell,\" he said, \"to keep pace with the times.\" \"Don't be too hard on them,\" I said, for I had just come out of a compromising age and a weakening country. The angel did not answer. \"It won't be as bad as the old hell, will it?\" I said. \"Worse,\" said the angel.  \"How can you reconcile it with your conscience as a Minister of Grace,\" I said, \"to inflict such a punishment?\" (They talked like this in the city whence I had come and I could not avoid the habit of it.)  \"They have invented a new cheap yeast,\" said the angel.  I looked at the legend on the walls of the hell that the angel was building, the words were written in flame, every fifteen seconds they changed their color, \"Yeasto, the great new yeast, it builds up body and brain, and something more.\"  \"They shall look at it for ever,\" the angel said.  \"But they drove a perfectly legitimate trade,\" I said, \"the law allowed it.\"  The angel went on hammering into place the huge steel uprights.  \"You are very revengeful,\" I said. \"Do you never rest from doing this terrible work?\"  \"I rested one Christmas Day,\" the angel said, \"and looked and saw little children dying of cancer. I shall go on now until the fires are lit.\"  \"It is very hard to prove,\" I said, \"that the yeast is as bad as you think.\"  \"After all,\" I said, \"they must live.\"  And the angel made no answer but went on building his hell.     THE TROUBLE IN LEAFY GREEN STREET   She went to the idol-shop in Moleshill Street, where the old man mumbles, and said: \"I want a god to worship when it is wet.\"  The old man reminded her of the heavy penalties that rightly attach to idolatry and, when he had enumerated all, she answered him as was meet: \"Give me a god to worship when it is wet.\"  And he went to the back places of his shop and sought out and brought her a god. The same was carved of grey stone and wore a propitious look and was named, as the old man mumbled, The God of Rainy Cheerfulness.  Now it may be that long confinement to the house affects adversely the liver, or these things may be of the soul, but certain it is that on a rainy day her spirits so far descended that those cheerful creatures came within sight of the Pit, and, having tried cigarettes to no good end, she bethought her of Moleshill Street and the mumbling man.  He brought the grey idol forth and mumbled of guarantees, although he put nothing on paper, and she paid him there and then his preposterous price and took the idol away.  And on the next wet day that there ever was she prayed to the grey-stone idol that she had bought, the God of Rainy Cheerfulness (who knows with what ceremony or what lack of it?), and so brought down on her in Leafy Green Street, in the preposterous house at the corner, that doom of which all men speak.     THE MIST   The mist said unto the mist: \"Let us go up into the Downs.\" And the mist came up weeping.  And the mist went into the high places and the hollows.  And clumps of trees in the distance stood ghostly in the haze.  But I went to a prophet, one who loved the Downs, and I said to him: \"Why does the mist come up weeping into the Downs when it goes into the high places and the hollows?\"  And he answered: \"The mist is the company of a multitude of souls who never saw the Downs, and now are dead. Therefore they come up weeping into the Downs, who are dead and never saw them.\"     FURROW-MAKER   He was all in black, but his friend was dressed in brown, members of two old families.  \"Is there any change in the way you build your houses?\" said he in black.  \"No change,\" said the other. \"And you?\"  \"We change not,\" he said.  A man went by in the distance riding a bicycle.  \"He is always changing,\" said the one in black, \"of late almost every century. He is uneasy. Always changing.\"  \"He changes the way he builds his house, does he not?\" said the brown one.  \"So my family say,\" said the other. \"They say he has changed of late.\"  \"They say he takes much to cities?\" the brown one said.  \"My cousin who lives in belfries tells me so,\" said the black one. \"He says he is much in cities.\"  \"And there he grows lean?\" said the brown one.  \"Yes, he grows lean.\"  \"Is it true what they say?\" said the brown one.  \"Caw,\" said the black one.  \"Is it true that he cannot live many centuries?\"  \"No, no,\" said the black one. \"Furrow-maker will not die. We must not lose furrow-maker. He has been foolish of late, he has played with smoke and is sick. His engines have wearied him and his cities are evil. Yes, he is very sick. But in a few centuries he will forget his folly and we shall not lose furrow-maker. Time out of mind he has delved and my family have got their food from the raw earth behind him. He will not die.\"  \"But they say, do they not?\" said the brown one, \"his cities are noisome, and that he grows sick in them and can run no longer, and that it is with him as it is with us when we grow too many, and the grass has the bitter taste in the rainy season, and our young grow bloated and die.\"  \"Who says it?\" replied the black one.  \"Pigeon,\" the brown one answered. \"He came back all dirty. And Hare went down to the edge of the cities once. He says it too. Man was too sick to chase him. He thinks that Man will die, and his wicked friend Dog with him. Dog, he will die. That nasty fellow Dog. He will die too, the dirty fellow!\"  \"Pigeon and Hare!\" said the black one. \"We shall not lose furrow-maker.\"  \"Who told you he will not die?\" his brown friend said.  \"Who told me!\" the black one said. \"My family and his have understood each other times out of mind. We know what follies will kill each other and what each may survive, and I say that furrow-maker will not die.\"  \"He will die,\" said the brown one.  \"Caw,\" said the other.  And Man said in his heart: \"Just one invention more. There is something I want to do with petrol yet, and then I will give it all up and go back to the woods.\"     LOBSTER SALAD   I was climbing round the perilous outside of the Palace of Colquonhombros. So far below me that in the tranquil twilight and clear air of those lands I could only barely see them lay the craggy tops of the mountains.  It was along no battlements or terrace edge I was climbing, but on the sheer face of the wall itself, getting what foothold I could where the boulders joined.  Had my feet been bare I was done, but though I was in my night-shirt I had on stout leather boots, and their edges somehow held in those narrow cracks. My fingers and wrists were aching.  Had it been possible to stop for a moment I might have been lured to give a second look at the fearful peaks of the mountains down there in the twilight, and this must have been fatal.  That the thing was all a dream is beside the point. We have fallen in dreams before, but it is well known that if in one of those falls you ever hit the ground--you die: I had looked at those menacing mountaintops and knew well that such a fall as the one I feared must have such a termination. Then I went on.  It is strange what different sensations there can be in different boulders--every one gleaming with the same white light and every one chosen to match the rest by minions of ancient kings--when your life depends on the edges of every one you come to. Those edges seemed strangely different. It was of no avail to overcome the terror of one, for the next would give you a hold in quite a different way or hand you over to death in a different manner. Some were too sharp to hold and some too flush with the wall, those"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7838"],["title","Fifty-One Tales (#7)"],["body","hold was the best crumbled the soonest; each rock had its different terror: and then there were those things that followed behind me.  And at last I came to a breach made long ago by earthquake, lightning or war: I should have had to go down a thousand feet to get round it and they would come up with me while I was doing that, for certain sable apes that I have not mentioned as yet, things that had tigerish teeth and were born and bred on that wall, had pursued me all the evening. In any case I could have gone no farther, nor did I know what the king would do along whose wall I was climbing. It was time to drop and be done with it or stop and await those apes.  And then it was that I remembered a pin, thrown carelessly down out of an evening-tie in another world to the one where grew that glittering wall, and lying now if no evil chance had removed it on a chest of drawers by my bed. The apes were very close, and hurrying, for they knew my fingers were slipping, and the cruel peaks of those infernal mountains seemed surer of me than the apes. I reached out with a desperate effort of will towards where the pin lay on the chest of drawers. I groped about. I found it! I ran it into my arm. Saved!     THE RETURN OF THE EXILES   The old man with a hammer and the one-eyed man with a spear were seated by the roadside talking as I came up the hill.  \"It isn't as though they hadn't asked us,\" the one with the hammer said.  \"There ain't no more than twenty as knows about it,\" said the other.  \"Twenty's twenty,\" said the first.  \"After all these years,\" said the one-eyed man with the spear. \"After all these years. We might go back just once.\"  \"O' course we might,\" said the other.  Their clothes were old even for laborers, the one with the hammer had a leather apron full of holes and blackened, and their hands looked like leather. But whatever they were they were English, and this was pleasant to see after all the motors that had passed me that day with their burden of mixed and doubtful nationalities.  When they saw me the one with the hammer touched his greasy cap.  \"Might we make so bold, sir,\" he said, \"as the ask the way to Stonehenge?\"  \"We never ought to go,\" mumbled the other plaintively. \"There's not more than twenty as knows, but....\"  I was bicycling there myself to see the place so I pointed out the way and rode on at once, for there was something so utterly servile about them both that I did not care for their company. They seemed by their wretched mien to have been persecuted or utterly neglected for many years, I thought that very likely they had done long terms of penal servitude.  When I came to Stonehenge I saw a group of about a score of men standing among the stones. They asked me with some solemnity if I was expecting anyone, and when I said No they spoke to me no more. It was three miles back where I left those strange old men, but I had not been in the stone circle long when they appeared, coming with great strides along the road. When they saw them all the people took off their hats and acted very strangely, and I saw that they had a goat which they led up then to the old altar stone. And the two old men came up with their hammer and spear and began apologizing plaintively for the liberty they had taken in coming back to that place, and all the people knelt on the grass before them. And then still kneeling they killed the goat by the altar, and when the two old men saw this they came up with many excuses and eagerly sniffed the blood. And at first this made them happy. But soon the one with the spear began to whimper. \"It used to be men,\" he lamented. \"It used to be men.\"  And the twenty men began looking uneasily at each other, and the plaint of the one-eyed man went on in that tearful voice, and all of a sudden they all looked at me. I do not know who the two old men were or what any of them were doing, but there are moments when it is clearly time to go, and I left them there and then. And just as I got up on to my bicycle I heard the plaintive voice of the one with the hammer apologizing for the liberty he had taken in coming back to Stonehenge.  \"But after all these years,\" I heard him crying, \"After all these years....\"  And the one with the spear said: \"Yes, after three thousand years....\"     NATURE AND TIME   Through the streets of Coventry one winter's night strode a triumphant spirit. Behind him stooping, unkempt, utterly ragged, wearing the clothes and look that outcasts have, whining, weeping, reproaching, an ill-used spirit tried to keep pace with him. Continually she plucked him by the sleeve and cried out to him as she panted after and he strode resolute on.  It was a bitter night, yet it did not seem to be the cold that she feared, ill-clad though she was, but the trams and the ugly shops and the glare of the factories, from which she continually winced as she hobbled on, and the pavement hurt her feet.  He that strode on in front seemed to care for nothing, it might be hot or cold, silent or noisy, pavement or open fields, he merely had the air of striding on.  And she caught up and clutched him by the elbow. I heard her speak in her unhappy voice, you scarcely heard it for the noise of the traffic.  \"You have forgotten me,\" she complained to him. \"You have forsaken me here.\"  She pointed to Coventry with a wide wave of her arm and seemed to indicate other cities beyond. And he gruffly told her to keep pace with him and that he did not forsake her. And she went on with her pitiful lamentation.  \"My anemones are dead for miles,\" she said, \"all my woods are fallen and still the cities grow. My child Man is unhappy and my other children are dying, and still the cities grow and you have forgotten me!\"  And then he turned angrily on her, almost stopping in that stride of his that began when the stars were made.  \"When have I ever forgotten you?\" he said, \"or when forsaken you ever? Did I not throw down Babylon for you? And is not Nineveh gone? Where is Persepolis that troubled you? Where Tarshish and Tyre? And you have said I forget you.\"  And at this she seemed to take a little comfort. I heard her speak once more, looking wistfully at her companion. \"When will the fields come back and the grass for my children?\"  \"Soon, soon,\" he said: then they were silent. And he strode away, she limping along behind him, and all the clocks in the towers chimed as he passed.     THE SONG OF THE BLACKBIRD   As the poet passed the thorn-tree the blackbird sang.  \"How ever do you do it?\" the poet said, for he knew bird language.  \"It was like this,\" said the blackbird. \"It really was the most extraordinary thing. I made that song last Spring, it came to me all of a sudden. There was the most beautiful she-blackbird that the world has ever seen. Her eyes were blacker than lakes are at night, her feathers were blacker than the night itself, and nothing was as yellow as her beak; she could fly much faster than the lightning. She was not an ordinary she-blackbird, there has never been any other like her at all. I did not dare go near her because she was so wonderful. One day last Spring when it got warm again--it had been cold, we ate berries, things were quite different then, but Spring came and it got warm--one day I was thinking how wonderful she was and it seemed so extraordinary to think that I should ever have seen her, the only really wonderful she-blackbird in the world, that I opened my beak to give a shout, and then this song came, and there had never been anything like it before, and luckily I remembered it, the very song that I sang just now. But what is so extraordinary, the most amazing occurence of that marvellous day, was that no sooner had I sung the song than that very bird, the most wonderful she-blackbird in the world, flew right up to me and sat quite close to me on the same tree. I never remember such wonderful times as those.  \"Yes, the song came in a moment, and as I was saying....\"  And an old wanderer walking with a stick came by and the blackbird flew away, and the poet told the old man the blackbird's wonderful story.  \"That song new?\" said the wanderer. \"Not a bit of it. God made it years ago. All the blackbirds used to sing it when I was young. It was new then.\"     THE MESSENGERS   One wandering nigh Parnassus chasing hares heard the high Muses.  \"Take us a message to the Golden Town.\"  Thus sang the Muses.  But the man said: \"They do not call to me. Not to such as me speak the Muses.\"  And the Muses called him by name.  \"Take us a message,\" they said, \"to the Golden Town.\"  And the man was downcast for he would have chased hares.  And the Muses called again.  And when whether in valleys or on high crags of the hills he still heard the Muses he went at last to them and heard their message, though he would fain have left it to other men and chased the fleet hares still in happy valleys.  And they gave him a wreath of laurels carved out of emeralds as only the Muses can carve. \"By this,\" they said, \"they shall know that you come from the Muses.\"  And the man went from that place and dressed in scarlet silks as befitted one that came from the high Muses. And through the gateway of the Golden Town he ran and cried his message, and his cloak floated behind him. All silent sat the wise men and the aged, they of the Golden Town; cross-legged they sat before their houses reading from parchments a message of the Muses that they sent long before.  And the young man cried his message from the Muses.  And they rose up and said: \"Thou art not from the Muses. Otherwise spake they.\" And they stoned him and he died.  And afterwards they carved his message upon gold; and read it in their temples on holy days.  When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? They sent another messenger to the Golden Town. And they gave him a wand of ivory to carry in his hand with all the beautiful stories of the world wondrously carved thereon. And only the Muses could have carved it. \"By this,\" they"]]]
