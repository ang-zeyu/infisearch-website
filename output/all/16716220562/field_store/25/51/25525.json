The last time he penetrated even to Edward himself, smiting down the king's standard-bearer, unhorsing Hastings, who threw himself on his path; and Edward, setting his teeth in stern joy as he saw him, rose in his stirrups, and for a moment the mace of the king, the axe of the earl, met as thunder encounters thunder; but then a hundred knights rushed into the rescue, and robbed the baffled avenger of his prey.  Thus charging and retreating, driving back with each charge farther and farther the mighty multitude hounding on to the lion's death, this great chief and his devoted knights, though terribly reduced in number, succeeded at last in covering Montagu's skilful retreat; and when they gained the outskirts of the wood, and dashed through the narrow opening between the barricades, the Yorkshire archers approved their lord's trust, and, shouting, as to a marriage feast, hailed his coming.  But few, alas! of his fellow-horsemen had survived that marvellous enterprise of valour and despair.  Of the fifty knights who had shared its perils, eleven only gained the wood; and, though in this number the most eminent (save Sir John Coniers, either slain or fled) might be found, their horses, more exposed than themselves, were for the most part wounded and unfit for further service.  At this time the sun again, and suddenly as before, broke forth,--not now with a feeble glimmer, but a broad and almost a cheerful beam, which sufficed to give a fuller view than the day had yet afforded of the state and prospects of the field.  To the right and to the left, what remained of the cavalry of Warwick were seen flying fast,--gone the lances of Oxford, the bills of Somerset.  Exeter, pierced by the shaft of Alwyn, was lying cold and insensible, remote from the contest, and deserted even by his squires.  In front of the archers and such men as Montagu had saved from the sword, halted the immense and murmuring multitude of Edward, their thousand banners glittering in the sudden sun; for, as Edward beheld the last wrecks of his foe, stationed near the covert, his desire of consummating victory and revenge made him cautious, and, fearing an ambush, he had abruptly halted.  When the scanty followers of the earl thus beheld the immense force arrayed for their destruction, and saw the extent of their danger, and their loss,--here the handful, there the multitude,--a simultaneous exclamation of terror and dismay broke from their ranks.  \"Children!\" cried Warwick, \"droop not!  Henry at Agincourt had worse odds than we!\"  But the murmur among the archers, the lealest part of the earl's retainers, continued, till there stepped forth their captain, a gray old man, but still sinewy and unbent, the iron relic of a hundred battles.  \"Back to your men, Mark Forester!\" said the earl, sternly.  The old man obeyed not.  He came on to Warwick, and fell on his knees beside his stirrup.  \"Fly, my lord! escape is possible for you and your riders.  Fly through the wood, we will screen your path with our bodies.  Your children, father of your followers, your children of Middleham, ask no better fate than to die for you!  Is it not so?\" and the old man, rising, turned to those in hearing.  They answered by a general acclamation.  \"Mark Forester speaks well,\" said Montagu.  \"On yon depends the last hope of Lancaster.  We may yet join Oxford and Somerset!  This way through the wood,--come!\" and he laid his hand on the earl's rein.  \"Knights and sirs,\" said the earl, dismounting, and partially raising his visor as he turned to the horsemen, \"let those who will, fly with Lord Montagu!  Let those who, in a just cause, never despair of victory, nor, even at the worst, fear to face their Maker, fresh from the glorious death of heroes, dismount with me!\"  Every knight sprang from his steed, Montagu the first. \"Comrades!\" continued the earl, then addressing the retainers, \"when the children fight for a father's honour, the father flies not from the peril into which he has drawn the children.  What to me were life, stained by the blood of mine own beloved retainers, basely deserted by their chief?  Edward has proclaimed that he will spare none.  Fool! he gives us, then, the superhuman mightiness of despair!  To your bows!--one shaft--if it pierce the joints of the tyrant's mail--one shaft may scatter yon army to the winds!  Sir Marmaduke has gone to rally noble Somerset and his riders; if we make good our defence one little hour, the foe may be yet smitten in the rear, and the day retrieved!  Courage and heart then!\"  Here the earl lifted his visor to the farthest bar, and showed his cheerful face--\"Is this the face of a man who thinks all hope is gone?\"  In this interval, the sudden sunshine revealed to King Henry, where he stood, the dispersion of his friends.  To the rear of the palisades, which protected the spot where he was placed, already grouped \"the lookers-on and no fighters,\" as the chronicler [Fabyan] words it, who, as the guns slackened, ventured forth to learn the news, and who now, filling the churchyard of Hadley, strove hard to catch a peep of Henry the saint, or of Bungey the sorcerer.  Mingled with these gleamed the robes of the tymbesteres, pressing nearer and nearer to the barriers, as wolves, in the instinct of blood, come nearer and nearer round the circling watch-fire of some northern travellers.  At this time the friar, turning to one of the guards who stood near him, said, \"The mists are needed no more now; King Edward hath got the day, eh?\"  \"Certes, great master,\" quoth the guard, \"nothing now lacks to the king's triumph except the death of the earl.\"  \"Infamous nigromancer, hear that!\" cried Bungey to Adam.  \"What now avail thy bombards and thy talisman!  Hark yet--tell me the secret of the last,--of the damnable engine under my feet, and I may spare thy life.\"  Adam shrugged his shoulders in impatient disdain.  \"Unless I gave thee my science, my secret were profitless to thee.  Villain and numskull, do thy worst.\"  The friar made a sign to a soldier who stood behind Adam, and the soldier silently drew the end of the rope which girded the scholar's neck round a bough of the leafless tree.  \"Hold!\" whispered the friar, \"not till I give the word.  The earl may recover himself yet,\" he added to himself; and therewith he began once more to vociferate his incantations.  Meanwhile the eyes of Sibyll had turned for a moment from her father; for the burst of sunshine, lighting up the valley below, had suddenly given to her eyes, in the distance, the gable-ends of the old farmhouse, with the wintry orchard,--no longer, alas! smiling with starry blossoms.  Far remote from the battlefield was that abode of peace,--that once happy home, where she had watched the coming of the false one!  Loftier and holier were the thoughts of the fated king.  He had turned his face from the field, and his eyes were fixed upon the tower of the church behind.  And while he so gazed, the knoll from the belfry began solemnly to chime.  It was now near the hour of the Sabbath prayers, and amidst horror and carnage, still the holy custom was not suspended.  \"Hark!\" said the king, mournfully, \"that chime summons many a soul to God!\"  While thus the scene on the eminence of Hadley, Edward, surrounded by Hastings, Gloucester, and his principal captains, took advantage of the unexpected sunshine to scan the foe and its position, with the eye of his intuitive genius for all that can slaughter man.  \"This day,\" he said, \"brings no victory, assures no crown, if Warwick escape alive.  To you, Lovell and Ratcliffe, I intrust two hundred knights,-- your sole care the head of the rebel earl!\"  \"And Montagu?\" said Ratcliffe.  \"Montagu?  Nay, poor Montagu, I loved him as well once as my own mother's son; and Montagu,\" he muttered to himself, \"I never wronged, and therefore him I can forgive.  Spare the marquis.--I mislike that wood; they must have more force within than that handful on the skirts betrays.  Come hither, D'Eyncourt.\"  And a few minutes afterwards, Warwick and his men saw two parties of horse leave the main body, one for the right hand, one the left, followed by long detachments of pikes, which they protected; and then the central array marched slowly and steadily on towards the scanty foe.  The design was obvious,--to surround on all sides the enemy, driven to its last desperate bay.  But Montagu and his brother had not been idle in the breathing-pause; they had planted the greater portion of the archers skilfully among the trees.  They had placed their pikemen on the verge of the barricades made by sharp stakes and fallen timber, and where their rampart was unguarded by the pass which had been left free for the horsemen, Hilyard and his stoutest fellows took their post, filling the gap with breasts of iron.  And now, as with horns and clarions, with a sea of plumes and spears and pennons, the multitudinous deathsmen came on, Warwick, towering in the front, not one feather on his eagle crest despoiled or shorn, stood, dismounted, his visor still raised, by his renowned steed. Some of the men had by Warwick's order removed the mail from the destrier's breast; and the noble animal, relieved from the weight, seemed as unexhausted as its rider; save where the champed foam had bespecked its glossy hide, not a hair was turned; and the on-guard of the Yorkists heard its fiery snort as they moved slowly on.  This figure of horse and horseman stood prominently forth amidst the little band.  And Lovell, riding by Ratcliffe's side, whispered, \"Beshrew me, I would rather King Edward had asked for mine own head than that gallant earl's!\"  \"Tush, youth,\" said the inexorable Ratcliffe, \"I care not of what steps the ladder of mine ambition may be made!\"  While they were thus speaking, Warwick, turning to Montagu and his knights, said,--  \"Our sole hope is in the courage of our men.  And, as at Towton, when I gave the throne to yon false"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7726"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 12 (#8)"],["body",", I slew, with my own hand, my noble Malech, to show that on that spot I would win or die, and by that sacrifice so fired the soldiers, that we turned the day, so now--oh, gentlemen, in another hour ye would jeer me, for my hand fails: this hand that the poor beast hath so often fed from!  Saladin, last of thy race, serve me now in death as in life.  Not for my sake, oh noblest steed that ever bore a knight,--not for mine this offering!\"  He kissed the destrier on his frontal, and Saladin, as if conscious of the coming blow, bent his proud crest humbly, and licked his lord's steel-clad hand.  So associated together had been horse and horseman, that had it been a human sacrifice, the bystanders could not have been more moved.  And when, covering the charger's eyes with one hand, the earl's dagger descended, bright and rapid, a groan went through the ranks.  But the effect was unspeakable!  The men knew at once that to them, and them alone, their lord intrusted his fortunes and his life; they were nerved to more than mortal daring.  No escape for Warwick-- why, then, in Warwick's person they lived and died!  Upon foe as upon friend, the sacrifice produced all that could tend to strengthen the last refuge of despair.  Even Edward, where he rode in the van, beheld and knew the meaning of the deed.  Victorious Towton rushed back upon his memory with a thrill of strange terror and remorse.  \"He will die as he has lived,\" said Gloucester, with admiration.  \"If I live for such a field, God grant me such a death!\"  As the words left the duke's lips, and Warwick, one foot on his dumb friend's corpse, gave the mandate, a murderous discharge from the archers in the covert rattled against the line of the Yorkists, and the foe, still advancing, stepped over a hundred corpses to the conflict.  Despite the vast preponderance of numbers, the skill of Warwick's archers, the strength of his position, the obstacle to the cavalry made by the barricades, rendered the attack perilous in the extreme.  But the orders of Edward were prompt and vigorous.  He cared not for the waste of life, and as one rank fell, another rushed on.  High before the barricades stood Montagu, Warwick, and the rest of that indomitable chivalry, the flower of the ancient Norman heroism.  As idly beat the waves upon a rock as the ranks of Edward upon that serried front of steel.  The sun still shone in heaven, and still Edward's conquest was unassured.  Nay, if Marmaduke could yet bring back the troops of Somerset upon the rear of the foe, Montagu and the earl felt that the victory might be for them.  And often the earl paused, to hearken for the cry of \"Somerset\" on the gale, and often Montagu raised his visor to look for the banners and the spears of the Lancastrian duke.  And ever, as the earl listened and Montagu scanned the field, larger and larger seemed to spread the armament of Edward. The regiment which boasted the stubborn energy of Alwyn was now in movement, and, encouraged by the young Saxon's hardihood, the Londoners marched on, unawed by the massacre of their predecessors. But Alwyn, avoiding the quarter defended by the knights, defiled a little towards the left, where his quick eye, inured to the northern fogs, had detected the weakness of the barricade in the spot where Hilyard was stationed; and this pass Alwyn (discarding the bow) resolved to attempt at the point of the pike, the weapon answering to our modern bayonet.  The first rush which he headed was so impetuous as to effect an entry.  The weight of the numbers behind urged on the foremost, and Hilyard had not sufficient space for the sweep of the two-handed sword which had done good work that day.  While here the conflict became fierce and doubtful, the right wing led by D'Eyncourt had pierced the wood, and, surprised to discover no ambush, fell upon the archers in the rear.  The scene was now inexpressibly terrific; cries and groans, and the ineffable roar and yell of human passion, resounded demonlike through the shade of the leafless trees.  And at this moment, the provident and rapid generalship of Edward had moved up one of his heavy bombards.  Warwick and Montagu and most of the knights were called from the barricades to aid the archers thus assailed behind; but an instant before that defence was shattered into air by the explosion of the bombard.  In another minute horse and foot rushed through the opening.  And amidst all the din was heard the voice of Edward, \"Strike, and spare not; we win the day!\"  \"We win the day! victory! victory!\" repeated the troops behind.  Rank caught the sound from rank, and file from file; it reached the captive Henry, and he paused in prayer; it reached the ruthless friar, and he gave the sign to the hireling at his shoulder; it reached the priest as he entered, unmoved, the church of Hadley.  And the bell, changing its note into a quicker and sweeter chime, invited the living to prepare for death, and the soul to rise above the cruelty and the falsehood, and the pleasure and the pomp, and the wisdom and the glory of the world!  And suddenly, as the chime ceased, there was heard, from the eminence hard by, a shriek of agony,--a female shriek,--drowned by the roar of a bombard in the field below.  On pressed the Yorkists through the pass forced by Alwyn.  \"Yield thee, stout fellow,\" said the bold trader to Hilyard, whose dogged energy, resembling his own, moved his admiration, and in whom, by the accent in which Robin called his men, he recognized a north- countryman; \"yield, and I will see that thou goest safe in life and limb.  Look round, ye are beaten.\"  \"Fool!\" answered Hilyard, setting his teeth, \"the People are never beaten!\"  And as the words left his lips, the shot from the recharged bombard shattered him piecemeal.  \"On for London and the crown!\" cried Alwyn,--\"the citizens are the People!\"  At this time, through the general crowd of the Yorkists, Ratcliffe and Lovell, at the head of their appointed knights, galloped forward to accomplish their crowning mission.  Behind the column which still commemorates \"the great battle\" of that day, stretches now a trilateral patch of pasture-land, which faces a small house.  At that time this space was rough forest-ground, and where now, in the hedge, rise two small trees, types of the diminutive offspring of our niggard and ignoble civilization, rose then two huge oaks, coeval with the warriors of the Norman Conquest. They grew close together; yet, though their roots interlaced, though their branches mingled, one had not taken nourishment from the other.  They stood, equal in height and grandeur, the twin giants of the wood.  Before these trees, whose ample trunks protected them from the falchions in the rear, Warwick and Montagu took their last post. In front rose, literally, mounds of the slain, whether of foe or friend; for round the two brothers to the last had gathered the brunt of war, and they towered now, almost solitary in valour's sublime despair, amidst the wrecks of battle and against the irresistible march of fate.  As side by side they had gained this spot, and the vulgar assailants drew back, leaving the bodies of the dead their last defence from death, they turned their visors to each other, as for one latest farewell on earth.  \"Forgive me, Richard,\" said Montagu,--\"forgive me thy death; had I not so blindly believed in Clarence's fatal order, the savage Edward had never passed alive through the pass of Pontefract.\"  \"Blame not thyself,\" replied Warwick.  \"We are but the instruments of a wiser Will.  God assoil thee, brother mine.  We leave this world to tyranny and vice.  Christ receive our souls!\"  For a moment their hands clasped, and then all was grim silence.  Wide and far, behind and before, in the gleam of the sun, stretched the victorious armament, and that breathing-pause sufficed to show the grandeur of their resistance,--the grandest of all spectacles, even in its hopeless extremity,--the defiance of brave hearts to the brute force of the many.  Where they stood they were visible to thousands, but not a man stirred against them.  The memory of Warwick's past achievements, the consciousness of his feats that day, all the splendour of his fortunes and his name, made the mean fear to strike, and the brave ashamed to murder!  The gallant D'Eyncourt sprang from his steed, and advanced to the spot.  His followers did the same.  \"Yield, my lords, yield!  Ye have done all that men could do!\"  \"Yield, Montagu,\" whispered Warwick.  \"Edward can harm not thee.  Life has sweets; so they say, at least.\"  \"Not with power and glory gone.--We yield not, Sir Knight,\" answered the marquis, in a calm tone.  \"Then die, and make room for the new men whom ye so have scorned!\" exclaimed a fierce voice; and Ratcliffe, who had neared the spot, dismounted and hallooed on his bloodhounds.  Seven points might the shadow have traversed on the dial, and, before Warwick's axe and Montagu's sword, seven souls had gone to judgment. In that brief crisis, amidst the general torpor and stupefaction and awe of the bystanders, round one little spot centred still a war.  But numbers rushed on numbers, as the fury of conflict urged on the lukewarm.  Montagu was beaten to his knee, Warwick covered him with his body; a hundred axes resounded on the earl's stooping casque, a hundred blades gleamed round the joints of his harness.  A simultaneous cry was heard; over the mounds of the slain, through the press into the shadow of the oaks, dashed Gloucester's charger.  The conflict had ceased, the executioners stood mute in a half-circle. Side by side, axe and sword still griped in their iron hands, lay Montagu and Warwick.  The young duke, his visor raised, contemplated the fallen foes in silence.  Then dismounting, he unbraced with his own hand the earl's helmet.  Revived for a moment by the air, the hero's eyes unclosed, his lips moved, he raised, with a feeble effort, the gory battle-axe, and the armed crowd"]]]
