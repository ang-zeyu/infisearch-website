As she had never loved Gustave, so she felt no resentment at the indifference his conduct manifested.  On the contrary, she hailed it as a sign that the annulment of their betrothal would be as welcome to him as to herself.  And if so, she could restore to him the sort of compassionate friendship she had learned to cherish in the hour of his illness and repentance.  She had resolved to seize the first opportunity he afforded to her of speaking to him with frank and truthful plainness.  But, meanwhile, her gentle nature recoiled from the confession of her resolve to appeal to Gustave himself for the rupture of their engagement.  Thus the Venosta alone received Madame Rameau; and while that lady was still gazing round her with an emotion too deep for immediate utterance, her husband entered with an expression of face new to him--the look of a man who has been stung to anger, and who has braced his mind to some stern determination.  This altered countenance of the good-tempered bourgeois was not, however, noticed by the two women.  The Venosta did not even raise her eyes to it, as with humbled accents she said, \"Pardon, dear Monsieur, pardon, Madame, our want of hospitality; it is not our hearts that fail.  We kept our state from you as long as we could.  Now it speaks for itself; '_la fame e una bretta festin._'\"  \"Oh, Madame! and oh, my poor Isaura!\" cried Madame Rameau, bursting into tears.  \"So we have been all this time a burden on you,--aided to bring such want on yon!  How can we ever be forgiven?  And my son--to leave us thus,--not even to tell us where to find him!\"  \"Do not degrade us, my wife,\" said M. Rameau, with unexpected dignity, \"by a word to imply that we would stoop to sue for support to our ungrateful child.  No, we will not starve!  I am strong enough still to find food for you.  I will apply for restoration to the National Guard. They have augmented the pay to married men; it is now nearly two francs and a half a-day to a _pere de famille_, and on that pay we all can at least live.  Courage, my wife!  I will go at once for employment.  Many men older than I am are at watch on the ramparts, and will march to the battle on the next sortie.\"  \"It shall not be so,\" exclaimed Madame Rameau, vehemently, and winding her arm round her husband's neck.  \"I loved my son better than thee once --more shame to me.  Now, I would rather lose twenty such sons than peril thy life, my Jacques!  Madame,\" she continued, turning to the Venosta, \"thou wert wiser than I.  Thou wert ever opposed to the union between thy young friend and my son.  I felt sore with thee for it--a mother is so selfish when she puts herself in the place of her child.  I thought that only through marriage with one so pure, so noble, so holy, Gustave could be saved from sin and evil.  I am deceived.  A man so heartless to his parents, so neglectful of his affianced, is not to be redeemed.  I brought about this betrothal: tell Isaura that I release her from it. I have watched her closely since she was entrapped into it.  I know how miserable the thought of it has made her, though, in her sublime devotion to her plighted word, she sought to conceal from me the real state of her heart.  If the betrothal bring such sorrow, what would the union do! Tell her this from me.  Come, Jacques, come away!\"  \"Stay, Madame!\" exclaimed the Venosta, her excitable nature much affected by this honest outburst of feeling.  \"It is true that I did oppose, so far as I could, my poor Piccola's engagement with M. Gustave.  But I dare not do your bidding.  Isaura would not listen to me.  And let us be just! M. Gustave may be able satisfactorily to explain his seeming indifference and neglect.  His health is always very delicate; perhaps he may be again dangerously ill.  He serves in the National Guard; perhaps--\" she paused, but the mother conjectured the word left unsaid, and, clasping her hands, cried out in anguish, \"Perhaps dead!--and we have wronged him!  Oh, Jacques, Jacques! how shall we find out-how discover our boy?  Who can tell us where to search? at the hospital--or in the cemeteries?\"  At the last word she dropped into a seat, and her whole frame shook with her sobs.  Jacques approached her tenderly, and kneeling by her side, said:  \"No, _m'amie_, comfort thyself, if it be indeed comfort to learn that thy son is alive and well.  For my part, I know not if I would not rather he had died in his innocent childhood.  I have seen him--spoken to him.  I know where he is to be found.\"  \"You do, and concealed it from me?  Oh, Jacques!\"  \"Listen to me, wife, and you, too, Madame; for what I have to say should be made known to Mademoiselle Cicogna.  Some time since, on the night of the famous sortie, when at my post on the ramparts, I was told that Gustave had joined himself to the most violent of the Red Republicans, and had uttered at the Club de la Vengeance sentiments, of which I will only say that I, his father and a Frenchman, hung my head with shame when they were repeated to me.  I resolved to go to the club myself.  I did. I heard him speak--heard him denounce Christianity as the instrument of tyrants.\"  \"Ah!\" cried the two women, with a simultaneous shudder.  \"When the assembly broke up, I waylaid him at the door.  I spoke to him seriously.  I told him what anguish such announcement of blasphemous opinions would inflict on his pious mother.  I told him I should deem it my duty to inform Mademoiselle Cicogna, and warn her against the union on which he had told us his heart was bent.  He appeared sincerely moved by what I said; implored me to keep silence towards his mother and his betrothed; and promised, on that condition, to relinquish at once what he called 'his career as an orator,' and appear no more at such execrable clubs.  On this understanding I held my tongue.  Why, with such other causes of grief and suffering, should I tell thee, poor wife, of a sin that I hoped thy son had repented and would not repeat?  And Gustave kept his word.  He has never, so far as I know, attended, at least spoken, at the Red clubs since that evening.\"  \"Thank heaven so far,\" murmured Madame Rameau.  \"So far, yes; but hear more.  A little time after I thus met him he changed his lodging, and did not confide to us his new address, giving as a reason to us that he wished to avoid a clue to his discovery by that pertinacious Mademoiselle Julie.\"  Rameau had here sunk his voice into a whisper, intended only for his wife, but the ear of the Venosta was fine enough to catch the sound, and she repeated, \"Mademoiselle Julie!  Santa Maria! who is she?\"  \"Oh!\" said M. Rameau, with a shrug of his shoulders, and with true Parisian _sangfroid_ as to such matters of morality, \"a trifle not worth considering.  Of course, a good-looking _garcon_ like Gustave must have his little affairs of the heart before he settles for life.  Unluckily, amongst those of Gustave was one with a violent-tempered girl who persecuted him when he left her, and he naturally wished to avoid all chance of a silly scandal, if only out of respect to the dignity of his fiancee.  But I found that was not the true motive, or at least the only one, for concealment.  Prepare yourself, my poor wife.  Thou hast heard of these terrible journals which the _decheance_ has let loose upon us. Our unhappy boy is the principal writer of one of the worst of them, under the name of 'Diderot le Jeune.\"'  \"What!\" cried the Venosta.  \"That monster!  The good Abbe Vertpre was telling us of the writings with that name attached to them.  The Abbe himself is denounced by name as one of those meddling priests who are to be constrained to serve as soldiers or pointed out to the vengeance of the _canaille_.  Isaura's _fiancee_ a blasphemer!\"  \"Hush, hush!\" said Madame Rameau, rising, very pale but self-collected. \"How do you know this, Jacques?\"  \"From the lips of Gustave himself.  I heard first of it yesterday from one of the young reprobates with whom he used to be familiar, and who even complimented me on the rising fame of my son, and praised the eloquence of his article that day.  But I would not believe him.  I bought the journal--here it is; saw the name and address of the printer --went this morning to the office--was there told that 'Diderot le Jeune' was within revising the press--stationed myself by the street door, and when Gustave came out I seized his arm, and asked him to say Yes or No if he was the author of this infamous article,--this, which I now hold in my hand.  He owned the authorship with pride; talked wildly of the great man he was--of the great things he was to do; said that, in hitherto concealing his true name, he had done all he could to defer to the bigoted prejudices of his parents and his fiancee; and that if genius, like fire, would find its way out, he could not help it; that a time was rapidly coming when his opinions would be uppermost; that since October the Communists were gaining ascendancy, and only waited the end of the siege to put down the present Government, and with it all hypocrisies and shams, religious or social.  My wife, he was rude to me, insulting!  but he had been drinking--that made him incautious: and he continued to walk by my side towards his own lodging, on reaching which he ironically invited me to enter, saying, 'I should meet there men who would soon argue me out of my obsolete notions.'  You may go to him, wife, now, if you please.  I will not, nor will I take from him a crust of bread.  I came hither, determined to tell the young lady all this, if I found her at home.  I should be a dishonoured man if I suffered her to be cheated into misery.  \"There, Madame Venosta, there!  Take that journal, show it to Mademoiselle; and report to her all I have said.\"  M.

(BY THE AUTHOR’S SON.)  “The Parisians” and “Kenelm Chillingly” were begun about the same time, and had their common origin in the same central idea. That idea first found fantastic expression in “The Coming Race;” and the three books, taken together, constitute a special group, distinctly apart from all the other works of their author.  The satire of his earlier novels is a protest against false social respectabilities; the humour of his later ones is a protest against the disrespect of social realities. By the first he sought to promote social sincerity and the free play of personal character; by the last, to encourage mutual charity and sympathy amongst all classes, on whose interrelation depends the character of society itself. But in these three books, his latest fictions, the moral purpose is more definite and exclusive. Each of them is an expostulation against what seemed to him the perilous popularity of certain social and political theories, or a warning against the influence of certain intellectual tendencies upon individual character and national life. This purpose, however, though common to the three fictions, is worked out in each of them by a different method. “The Coming Race” is a work of pure fancy, and the satire of it is vague and sportive. The outlines of a definite purpose are more distinctly drawn in “Chillingly,”--a romance which has the source of its effect in a highly wrought imagination. The humour and pathos of “Chillingly” are of a kind incompatible with the design of “The Parisians,” which is a work of dramatized observation. “Chillingly”  is a romance; “The Parisians” is a novel. The subject of “Chillingly” is psychological; that of “The Parisians” is social. The author’s object in “Chillingly” being to illustrate the effects of “modern ideas” upon an individual character, he has confined his narrative to the biography of that one character; hence the simplicity of plot and small number of dramatis personae, whereby the work gains in height and depth what it loses in breadth of surface. “The Parisians,” on the contrary, is designed to illustrate the effect of “modern ideas” upon a whole community. This novel is therefore panoramic in the profusion and variety of figures presented by it to the reader’s imagination. No exclusive prominence is vouchsafed to any of these figures. All of them are drawn and coloured with an equal care, but by means of the bold, broad touches necessary for their effective presentation on a canvas so large and so crowded. Such figures are, indeed, but the component features of one great form, and their actions only so many modes of one collective impersonal character,--that of the Parisian Society of Imperial and Democratic France; a character everywhere present and busy throughout the story, of which it is the real hero or heroine. This society was doubtless selected for characteristic illustration as being the most advanced in the progress of “modern ideas.” Thus, for a complete perception of its writer’s fundamental purpose, “The Parisians”  should be read in connection with “Chillingly,” and these two books in connection with “The Coming Race.” It will then be perceived that through the medium of alternate fancy, sentiment, and observation, assisted by humour and passion, these three books (in all other respects so different from each other) complete the presentation of the same purpose under different aspects, and thereby constitute a group of fictions which claims a separate place of its own in any thoughtful classification of their author’s works.  One last word to those who will miss from these pages the connecting and completing touches of the master’s hand. It may be hoped that such a disadvantage, though irreparable, is somewhat mitigated by the essential character of the work itself. The aesthetic merit of this kind of novel is in the vivacity of a general effect produced by large, swift strokes of character; and in such strokes, if they be by a great artist, force and freedom of style must still be apparent, even when they are left rough and unfinished. Nor can any lack of final verbal correction much diminish the intellectual value which many of the more thoughtful passages of the present work derive from a long, keen, and practical study of political phenomena, guided by personal experience of public life, and enlightened by a large, instinctive knowledge of the human heart.  Such a belief is, at least, encouraged by the private communications spontaneously made to him who expresses it, by persons of political experience and social position in France, who have acknowledged the general accuracy of the author’s descriptions, and noticed the suggestive sagacity and penetration of his occasional comments on the circumstances and sentiments he describes.     INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER.  They who chance to have read the “Coming Race” may perhaps remember that I, the adventurous discoverer of the land without a sun, concluded the sketch of my adventures by a brief reference to the malady which, though giving no perceptible notice of its encroachments, might, in the opinion of my medical attendant, prove suddenly fatal.  I had brought my little book to this somewhat melancholy close a few years before the date of its publication, and in the meanwhile I was induced to transfer my residence to Paris, in order to place myself under the care of an English physician, renowned for his successful treatment of complaints analogous to my own.  I was the more readily persuaded to undertake this journey,--partly because I enjoyed a familiar acquaintance with the eminent physician referred to, who had commenced his career and founded his reputation in the United States; partly because I had become a solitary man, the ties of home broken, and dear friends of mine were domiciled in Paris, with whom I should be sure of tender sympathy and cheerful companionship. I had reason to be thankful for this change of residence: the skill of Dr. C______ soon restored me to health. Brought much into contact with various circles of Parisian society, I became acquainted with the persons and a witness of the events that form the substance of the tale I am about to submit to the public, which has treated my former book with so generous an indulgence. Sensitively tenacious of that character for strict and unalloyed veracity which, I flatter myself, my account of the abodes and manners of the Vril-ya has established, I could have wished to preserve the following narrative no less jealously guarded than its predecessor from the vagaries of fancy. But Truth undisguised, never welcome in any civilized community above ground, is exposed at this time to especial dangers in Paris; and my life would not be worth an hour’s purchase if I exhibited her ‘in puris naturalibus’ to the eyes of a people wholly unfamiliarized to a spectacle so indecorous. That care for one’s personal safety which is the first duty of thoughtful man compels me therefore to reconcile the appearance of ‘la Verite’ to the ‘bienseances’ of the polished society in which ‘la Liberte’ admits no opinion not dressed after the last fashion.  Attired as fiction, Truth may be peacefully received; and, despite the necessity thus imposed by prudence, I indulge the modest hope that I do not in these pages unfaithfully represent certain prominent types of the brilliant population which has invented so many varieties of Koom-Posh;     [Koom-Posh, Glek-Nas. For the derivation of these terms and their    metaphorical signification, I must refer the reader to the “Coming    Race,” chapter xii., on the language of the Vril-ya. To those who    have not read or have forgotten that historical composition, it may    be convenient to state briefly that Koom-Posh with the Vril-ya is    the name for the government of the many, or the ascendency of the    most ignorant or hollow, and may be loosely rendered Hollow-Bosh.    When Koom-Posh degenerates from popular ignorance into the popular    ferocity which precedes its decease, the name for that state of    things is Glek-Nas; namely, the universal strife-rot.]  and even when it appears hopelessly lost in the slough of a Glek-Nas, re-emerges fresh and lively as if from an invigorating plunge into the Fountain of Youth. O Paris, ‘foyer des idees, et oeil du monde!’--animated contrast to the serene tranquillity of the Vril-ya, which, nevertheless, thy noisiest philosophers ever pretend to make the goal of their desires: of all communities on which shines the sun and descend the rains of heaven, fertilizing alike wisdom and folly, virtue and vice; in every city men have yet built on this earth,--mayest thou, O Paris, be the last to brave the wands of the Coming Race and be reduced into cinders for the sake of the common good!                              TISH.  PARIS, August 28, 1872.     THE PARISIANS.     BOOK I.     CHAPTER I.  It was a bright day in the early spring of 1869. All Paris seemed to have turned out to enjoy itself. The Tuileries, the Champs Elysees, the Bois de Boulogne, swarmed with idlers. A stranger might have wondered where Toil was at work, and in what nook Poverty lurked concealed. A millionaire from the London Exchange, as he looked round on the magasins, the equipages, the dresses of the women; as he inquired the prices in the shops and the rent of apartments,--might have asked himself, in envious wonder, How on earth do those gay Parisians live? What is their fortune? Where does it come from?  As the day declined, many of the scattered loungers crowded into the Boulevards; the cafes and restaurants began to light up.  About this time a young man, who might be some five or six and twenty, was walking along the Boulevard des Italiens, heeding little the throng through which he glided his solitary way: there was that in his aspect and bearing which caught attention. He looked a somebody; but though unmistakably a"]]]
