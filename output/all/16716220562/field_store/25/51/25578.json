Come and discuss them at the cafe de Lyon yonder over a bowl of punch.  I'll stand treat.\"  \"Agreed, dear Charles.\"  \"And if this monsieur is a friend of yours, perhaps he will join us.\"  \"You are too obliging, Monsieur,\" answered Le Noy, not ill-pleased to get rid of his excited companion; \"but it has been a busy day with me, and I am only fit for bed.  Be abstinent of the punch, Armand.  You are feverish already.  Good-night, Messieurs.\"  The cafe de Lyon, in vogue among the National Guard of the quartier, was but a few yards off, and the brothers turned towards it arm in arm.  \"Who is the friend?\" asked Charles; \"I don't remember to have seen him with thee before.\"  \"He belongs to the medical craft--a good patriot and a kind man--attends the poor gratuitously.  Yes, Charles, these are strange times; what dost thou think will come of them?\"  They had now entered the cafe; and Charles had ordered the punch, and seated himself at a vacant table before he replied.  \"What will come of these times?  I will tell thee.  National deliverance and regeneration through the ascendency of the National Guard.\"  \"Eh?  I don't take,\" said Armand, bewildered.  \"Probably not,\" answered Charles, with an air of compassionate conceit; \"thou art a dreamer, but I am a politician.\"  He tapped his forehead significantly.  \"At this custom-house, ideas are examined before they are passed.\"  Armand gazed at his brother wistfully, and with a defence he rarely manifested towards any one who disputed his own claims to superior intelligence.  Charles was a few years older than Monnier; he was of large build; he had shaggy lowering eyebrows, a long obstinate upper lip, the face of a man who was accustomed to lay down the law. Inordinate self-esteem often gives that character to a physiognomy otherwise commonplace.  Charles passed for a deep thinker in his own set, which was a very different set from Armand's--not among workmen but small shopkeepers.  He had risen in life to a grade beyond Armand's; he had always looked to the main chance, married the widow of a hosier and glover much older than himself, and in her right was a very respectable tradesman, comfortably well off; a Liberal, of course, but a Liberal bourgeois, equally against those above him and those below.  Needless to add that he had no sympathy with his brother's socialistic opinions. Still he loved that brother as well as he could love any one except himself.  And Armand, who was very affectionate, and with whom family ties were very strong, returned that love with ample interest; and though so fiercely at war with the class to which Charles belonged, was secretly proud of having a brother who was of that class.  So in England I have known the most violent antagonist of the landed aristocracy-- himself a cobbler--who interrupts a discourse on the crimes of the aristocracy by saying, \"Though I myself descend from a county family.\"  In an evil day Charles Monnier, enrolled in the National Guard, had received promotion in that patriotic corps.  From that date he began to neglect his shop, to criticise military matters, and to think that if merit had fair play he should be a Cincinnatus or a Washington, he had not decided which.  \"Yes,\" resumed Charles, ladling out the punch, \"thou hast wit enough to perceive that our generals are imbeciles or traitors; that _gredin_ Bonaparte has sold the army for ten millions of francs to Bismarck, and I have no doubt that Wimpffen has his share of the bargain.  McMahon was wounded conveniently, and has his own terms for it.  The regular army is nowhere.  Thou wilt see--thou wilt see--they will not stop the march of the Prussians.  Trochu will be obliged to come to the National Guard. Then we shall say, 'General, give us our terms, and go to sleep.'  \"I shall be summoned to the council of war.  I have my plan.  I explain it--'tis accepted--it succeeds.  I am placed in supreme command--the Prussians are chased back to their sour-krout.  And I--well--I don't like to boast, but thou'lt see--thou'lt see--what will happen.\"  \"And thy plan, Charles--thou hast formed it already?\"  \"Ay, ay,--the really military genius is prompt, _mon petit Armand_--a flash of the brain.  Hark ye!  Let the Vandals come to Paris and invest it.  Whatever their numbers on paper, I don't care a button; they can only have a few thousands at any given point in the vast circumference of the capital.  Any fool must grant that--thou must grant it eh?\"  \"It seems just.\"  \"Of course.  Well, then, we proceed by sorties of 200,000 men repeated every other day, and in twelve days the Prussians are in full flight. The country rises on their flight--they are cut to pieces.  I depose Trochu--the National Guard elects the Saviour of France.  I have a place in my eye for thee.  Thou art superb as a decorator--thou shalt be Minister des Beaux Arts.  But keep clear of the canaille.  No more strikes then--thou wilt be an employer--respect thy future order.\"       [Charles Monnier seems to have indiscreetly blabbed out his \"idea,\"      for it was plagiarised afterwards at a meeting of the National      Guards in the Salle de la Bourse by Citizen Rochebrune (slain 19th      January, 1871, in the affair of Montretout).  The plan, which he      developed nearly in the same words as Charles Monnier, was received      with lively applause; and at the close of his speech it was proposed      to name at once Citizen Rochebrune General of the National Guard, an      honour which, unhappily for his country, the citizen had the modesty      to decline.]  Armand smiled mournfully.  Though of intellect which, had it been disciplined, was far superior to his brother's, it was so estranged from practical opinions, so warped, so heated, so flawed and cracked in parts, that he did not see the ridicule of Charles's braggadocio.  Charles had succeeded in life, Armand had failed; and Armand believed in the worldly wisdom of the elder born.  But he was far too sincere for any bribe to tempt him to forsake his creed and betray his opinions.  And he knew that it must be a very different revolution from that which his brother contemplated, that could allow him to marry another man's wife, and his \"order\" to confiscate other people's property.  \"Don't talk of strikes, Charles.  What is done is done.  I was led into heading a strike, not on my own account, for I was well paid and well off, but for the sake of my fellow-workmen.  I may regret now what I did, for the sake of Marie and the little ones.  But it is an affair of honour, and I cannot withdraw from the cause till my order, as thou namest my class, has its rights.\"  \"Bah! thou wilt think better of it when thou art an employer.  Thou hast suffered enough already.  Remember that I warned thee against that old fellow in spectacles whom I met once at thy house.  I told thee he would lead thee into mischief, and then leave thee to get out of it.  I saw through him.  I have a head!  Va!\"  \"Thou wert a true prophet--he has duped me.  But in moving me he has set others in movement; and I suspect he will find he has duped himself. Time will show.\"  Here the brothers were joined by some loungers belonging to the National Guard.  The talk became general, the potations large.  Towards daybreak Armand reeled home, drunk for the first time in his life.  He was one of those whom drink makes violent.  Marie had been sitting up for him, alarmed at his lengthened absence.  But when she would have thrown herself on his breast, her pale face and her passionate sobs enraged him. He flung her aside roughly.  From that night the man's nature was changed.  If, as a physiognomist has said, each man has in him a portion of the wild beast, which is suppressed by mild civilising circumstances, and comes uppermost when self-control is lost, the nature of many an honest workman, humane and tender-hearted as the best of us, commenced a change into the wild beast that raged through the civil war of the Communists, on the day when half-a-dozen Incapables, with no more claim to represent the people of Paris than half-a-dozen monkeys would have, were allowed to elect themselves to supreme power, and in the very fact of that election released all the elements of passion, and destroyed all the bulwarks of order.     CHAPTER X.  No man perhaps had more earnestly sought and more passionately striven for the fall of the Empire than Victor de Mauleon; and perhaps no man was more dissatisfied and disappointed by the immediate consequences of that fall, In first conspiring against the Empire, he had naturally enough, in common with all the more intelligent enemies of the dynasty, presumed that its fate would be worked out by the normal effect of civil causes-- the alienation of the educated classes, the discontent of the artisans, the eloquence of the press and of popular meetings, strengthened in proportion as the Emperor had been compelled to relax the former checks upon the license of either.  And De Mauleon had no less naturally concluded that there would be time given for the preparation of a legitimate and rational form of government to succeed that which was destroyed.  For, as has been hinted or implied, this remarkable man was not merely an instigator of revolution through the Secret Council, and the turbulent agencies set in movement through the lower strata of society;--he was also in confidential communication with men eminent for wealth, station, and political repute, from whom he obtained the funds necessary for the darker purposes of conspiracy, into the elaboration of which they did not inquire; and these men, though belonging like himself to the Liberal party, were no hot-blooded democrats.  Most of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7747"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 11 (#8)"],["body","were in favour of constitutional monarchy; all of them for forms of government very different from any republic in which socialists or communists could find themselves uppermost.  Among these politicians were persons ambitious and able, who, in scheming for the fall of the Empire, had been prepared to undertake the task of conducting to ends compatible with modern civilisation the revolution they were willing to allow a mob at Paris to commence.  The opening of the war necessarily suspended their designs.  How completely the events of the 4th September mocked the calculations of their ablest minds, and paralysed the action of their most energetic spirits, will appear in the conversation I am about to record.  It takes place between Victor de Mauleon and the personage to whom he had addressed the letter written on the night before the interview with Louvier, in which Victor had announced his intention of reappearing in Paris in his proper name and rank.  I shall designate this correspondent as vaguely as possible; let me call him the Incognito.  He may yet play so considerable a part in the history of France as a potent representative of the political philosophy of De Tocqueville--that is, of Liberal principles incompatible with the absolute power either of a sovereign or a populace, and resolutely opposed to experiments on the foundations of civilised society--that it would be unfair to himself and his partisans if, in a work like this, a word were said that could lead malignant conjecture to his identity with any special chief of the opinions of which I here present him only as a type.  The Incognito, entering Victor's apartment:  \"My dear friend, even if I had not received your telegram, I should have hastened hither on the news of this astounding revolution.  It is only in Paris that such a tragedy could be followed by such a farce.  You were on the spot--a spectator.  Explain it if you can.\"  DE MAULEON.--\"I was more than a spectator; I was an actor.  Hiss me-- I deserve it.  When the terrible news from Sedan reached Paris, in the midst of the general stun and bewilderment I noticed a hesitating timidity among all those who had wares in their shops and a good coat on their backs.  They feared that to proclaim the Empire defunct would be to install the Red Republic with all its paroxysm of impulsive rage and all its theories of wholesale confiscation.  But since it was impossible for the object we had in view to let slip the occasion of deposing the dynasty which stood in its way, it was necessary to lose no time in using the revolutionary part of the populace for that purpose.  I assisted in doing so; my excuse is this--that in a time of crisis a man of action must go straight to his immediate object, and in so doing employ the instruments at his command.  I made, however, one error in judgment which admits no excuse: I relied on all I had heard, and all I had observed, of the character of Trochu, and I was deceived, in common, I believe, with all his admirers, and three parts of the educated classes of Paris.\"  INCOGNITO.--\"I should have been equally deceived!  Trochu's conduct is a riddle that I doubt if he himself can ever solve.  He was master of the position; he had the military force in his hands if he combined with Palikao, which, whatever the jealousies between the two, it was his absolute duty to do.  He had a great prestige--\"  DE MAULEON.--\"And for the moment a still greater popularity.  His _ipse dixit_ could have determined the wavering and confused spirits of the population.  I was prepared for his abandonment of the Emperor--even of the Empress and the Regency.  But how could I imagine that he, the man of moderate politics, of Orleanistic leanings, the clever writer, the fine talker, the chivalrous soldier, the religious Breton, could abandon everything that was legal, everything that could save France against the enemy, and Paris against civil discord; that he would connive at the annihilation of the Senate, of the popular Assembly, of every form of Government that could be recognised as legitimate at home or abroad, accept service under men whose doctrines were opposed to all his antecedents, all his professed opinions, and inaugurate a chaos under the name of a Republic!\"  INCOGNITO.--\"How, indeed?  How suppose that the National Assembly, just elected by a majority of seven millions and a half, could be hurried into a conjuring-bog, and reappear as the travesty of a Venetian oligarchy, composed of half-a-dozen of its most unpopular members!  The sole excuse for Trochu is, that he deemed all other considerations insignificant compared with the defence of Paris, and the united action of the nation against the invaders.  But if that were his honest desire in siding with this monstrous usurpation of power, he did everything by which the desire could be frustrated.  Had there been any provisional body composed of men known and esteemed, elected by the Chambers, supported by Trochu and the troops at his back, there would have been a rallying-point for the patriotism of the provinces; and in the wise suspense of any constitution to succeed that Government until the enemy were chased from the field, all partisans--Imperialists, Legitimists, Orleanists, Republicans--would have equally adjourned their differences.  But a democratic Republic, proclaimed by a Parisian mob for a nation in which sincere democratic Republicans are a handful, in contempt of an Assembly chosen by the country at large; headed by men in whom the provinces have no trust, and for whom their own representatives are violently cashiered;--can you conceive such a combination of wet blankets supplied by the irony of Fate for the extinction of every spark of ardour in the population from which armies are to be gathered in haste, at the beck of usupers they distrust and despise?  Paris has excelled itself in folly.  Hungering for peace, it proclaims a Government which has no legal power to treat for it. Shrieking out for allies among the monarchies, it annihilates the hope of obtaining them; its sole chance of escape from siege, famine, and bombardment, is in the immediate and impassioned sympathy of the provinces; and it revives all the grudges which the provinces have long sullenly felt against the domineering pretensions of the capital, and invokes the rural populations, which comprise the pith and sinew of armies, in the name of men whom I verily believe they detest still more than they do the Prussians.  Victor, it is enough to make one despair of his country!  All beyond the hour seems anarchy and ruin.\"  \"Not so!\" exclaimed De Mauleon.  \"Everything comes to him who knows how to wait.  The Empire is destroyed; the usurpation that follows it has no roots.  It will but serve to expedite the establishment of such a condition as we have meditated and planned--a constitution adapted to our age and our people, not based wholly on untried experiments, taking the best from nations that do not allow Freedom and Order to be the sport of any popular breeze.  From the American Republic we must borrow the only safeguards against the fickleness of the universal suffrage which, though it was madness to concede in any ancient community, once conceded cannot be safely abolished,--viz., the salutary law that no article of the Constitution, once settled, can be altered without the consent of two- thirds of the legislative body.  By this law we insure permanence, and that concomitant love for institutions which is engendered by time and custom.  Secondly, the formation of a senate on such principles as may secure to it in all times of danger a confidence and respect which counteract in public opinion the rashness and heat of the popular assembly.  On what principles that senate should be formed, with what functions invested, what share of the executive--especially in foreign affairs, declarations of war, or treaties of peace--should be accorded to it, will no doubt need the most deliberate care of the ablest minds.  But a senate I thus sketch has alone rescued America from the rashness of counsel incident to a democratic Chamber; and it is still more essential to France, with still more favourable elements for its creation.  From England we must borrow the great principle that has alone saved her from revolution--that the head of the State can do no wrong.  He leads no armies, he presides over no Cabinet.  All responsibility rests with his advisers; and where we upset a dynasty, England changes an administration.  Whether the head of the State should have the title of sovereign or president, whether he be hereditary or elected, is a question of minor importance impossible now to determine, but on which I heartily concur with you that hereditary monarchy is infinitely better adapted to the habits of Frenchmen, to their love of show and of honours --and infinitely more preservative from all the dangers which result from constant elections to such a dignity, with parties so heated, and pretenders to the rank so numerous--than any principle by which a popular demagogue or a successful general is enabled to destroy the institutions he is elected to guard.  On these fundamental doctrines for the regeneration of France I think we are agreed.  And I believe when the moment arrives to promulgate them, through an expounder of weight like yourself, they will rapidly commend themselves to the intellect of France.  For they belong to common sense; and in the ultimate prevalence of common-sense I have a faith which I refuse to medievalists who would restore the right divine; and still more to fanatical quacks, who imagine that the worship of the Deity, the ties of family, and the rights of property are errors at variance with the progress of society. _Qui vivera, verra_.\"  INCOGNITO.--\"In the outlines of the policy you so ably enunciate I heartily concur.  But if France is, I will not say to be regenerated, but to have fair play among the nations of"]]]
