John Wilkes, my head shopman, is a handy fellow; he was my boatswain in the _Kate_, and I took him on when we found that the man who had been my father's right hand for twenty years had been cheating him all along. We got on well enough as long as I could give all my time in the shop; but he is no good with the pen--all he can do is to enter receipts and sales.  \"He has a man under him, who helps him in measuring out the right length of canvas and cables or for weighing a chain or an anchor, and knows enough to put down the figures; but that is all. Then there are the two smiths and the two apprentices; they don't count in the matter. Robert Ashford, the eldest apprentice, could do the work, but I have no fancy for him; he does not look one straight in the face as one who is honest and above board should do. I shall have to keep a clerk, and I know what it will be--he will be setting me right, and I shall not feel my own master; he will be out of place in my crew altogether. I never liked pursers; most of them are rogues. Still, I suppose it must come to that.\"  \"I have a boy come in to write my bills and to make up my accounts, who would be just the lad for you, Captain Dave. He is the son of a broken-down Cavalier, but he is a steady, honest young fellow, and I fancy his pen keeps his father, who is a roystering blade, and spends most of his time at the taverns. The boy comes to me for an hour, twice a week; he writes as good a hand as any clerk and can reckon as quickly, and I pay him but a groat a week, which was all he asked.\"  \"Tell him to come to me, then. I should want him every day, if he could manage it, and it would be the very thing for me.\"  \"I am sure you would like him,\" the other said; \"he is a good-looking young fellow, and his face speaks for him without any recommendation. I was afraid at first that he would not do for me; I thought there was too much of the gentleman about him. He has good manners, and a gentle sort of way. He has been living in France all his life, and though he has never said anything about his family--indeed he talks but little, he just comes in and does his work and goes away--I fancy his father was one of King Charles's men and of good blood.\"  \"Well, that doesn't sound so well,\" the sailor said, \"but anyhow I should like to have a look at him.\"  \"He comes to me to-morrow at eleven and goes at twelve,\" the man said, \"and I will send him round to you when he has done.\"  Cyril had gone round the next morning to the ships' store.  \"So you are the lad that works for my neighbour Anderson?\" Captain Dave said, as he surveyed him closely. \"I like your looks, lad, but I doubt whether we shall get on together. I am an old sailor, you know, and I am quick of speech and don't stop to choose my words, so if you are quick to take offence it would be of no use your coming to me.\"  \"I don't think I am likely to take offence,\" Cyril said quietly; \"and if we don't get on well together, sir, you will only have to tell me that you don't want me any longer; but I trust you will not have often the occasion to use hard words, for at any rate I will do my best to please you.\"  \"You can't say more, lad. Well, let us have a taste of your quality. Come in here,\" and he led him into a little room partitioned off from the shop. \"There, you see,\" and he opened a book, \"is the account of the sales and orders yesterday; the ready-money sales have got to be entered in that ledger with the red cover; the sales where no money passed have to be entered to the various customers or ships in the ledger. I have made out a list--here it is--of twelve accounts that have to be drawn out from that ledger and sent in to customers. You will find some of them are of somewhat long standing, for I have been putting off that job. Sit you down here. When you have done one or two of them I will have a look at your work, and if that is satisfactory we will have a talk as to what hours you have got disengaged, and what days in the week will suit you best.\"  It was two hours before Captain Dave came in again. Cyril had just finished the work; some of the accounts were long ones, and the writing was so crabbed that it took him some time to decipher it.  \"Well, how are you getting on, lad?\" the Captain asked.  \"I have this moment finished the last account.\"  \"What! Do you mean to say that you have done them all! Why, it would have taken me all my evenings for a week. Now, hand me the books; it is best to do things ship-shape.\"  He first compared the list of the sales with the entries, and then Cyril handed him the twelve accounts he had drawn up. Captain David did not speak until he had finished looking through them.  \"I would not have believed all that work could have been done in two hours,\" he said, getting up from his chair. \"Orderly and well written, and without a blot. The King's secretary could not have done better! Well, now you have seen the list of sales for a day, and I take it that be about the average, so if you come three times a week you will always have two days' sales to enter in the ledger. There are a lot of other books my father used to keep, but I have never had time to bother myself about them, and as I have got on very well so far, I do not see any occasion for you to do so, for my part it seems to me that all these books are only invented by clerks to give themselves something to do to fill up their time. Of course, there won't be accounts to send out every day. Do you think with two hours, three times a week, you could keep things straight?\"  \"I should certainly think so, sir, but I can hardly say until I try, because it seems to me that there must be a great many items, and I can't say how long it will take entering all the goods received under their proper headings; but if the books are thoroughly made up now, I should think I could keep them all going.\"  \"That they are not,\" Captain David said ruefully; \"they are all horribly in arrears. I took charge of them myself three years ago, and though I spend three hours every evening worrying over them, they get further and further in arrears. Look at those files over there,\" and he pointed to three long wires, on each of which was strung a large bundle of papers; \"I am afraid you will have to enter them all up before you can get matters into ship-shape order. The daily sale book is the only one that has been kept up regularly.\"  \"But these accounts I have made up, sir? Probably in those files there are many other goods supplied to the same people.\"  \"Of course there are, lad, though I did not think of it before. Well, we must wait, then, until you can make up the arrears a bit, though I really want to get some money in.\"  \"Well, sir, I might write at the bottom of each bill 'Account made up to,' and then put in the date of the latest entry charged.\"  \"That would do capitally, lad--I did not think of that. I see you will be of great use to me. I can buy and sell, for I know the value of the goods I deal in; but as to accounts, they are altogether out of my way. And now, lad, what do you charge?\"  \"I charge a groat for two hours' work, sir; but if I came to you three times a week, I would do it for a little less.\"  \"No, lad, I don't want to beat you down; indeed, I don't think you charge enough. However, let us say, to begin with, three groats a week.\"  This had been six weeks before Sir Aubrey Shenstone's death; and in the interval Cyril had gradually wiped off all the arrears, and had all the books in order up to date, to the astonishment of his employer.     CHAPTER II  A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER   \"I am glad to see you again, lad,\" Captain David said, when Cyril entered his shop. \"I have been thinking of the news you gave me last week, and the mistress and I have been talking it over. Where are you lodging?\"  \"I have been lodging until now in Holborn,\" Cyril replied; \"but I am going to move.\"  \"Yes; that is what we thought you would be doing. It is always better to make a change after a loss. I don't want to interfere in your business, lad, but have you any friends you are thinking of going to?\"  \"No, sir; I do not know a soul in London save those I work for.\"  \"That is bad, lad--very bad. I was talking it over with my wife, and I said that maybe you were lonely. I am sure, lad, you are one of the right sort. I don't mean only in your work, for as for that I would back you against any scrivener in London, but I mean about yourself. It don't need half an eye to see that you have not been brought up to this sort of thing, though you have taken to it so kindly, but there is not one in a thousand boys of your age who would have settled down to work and made their way without a friend to help them as you have done; it shows that there is right good stuff in you. There, I am so long getting under weigh that I shall never get into port if I don't steer a straight course. Now, my ideas and my wife's come to this: if you have got no friends you will have to take a lodging somewhere among strangers, and then it would be one of two things--you would either stop at home and mope by yourself, or you would go out, and maybe get into bad company. If I had not come across you I should have had to employ a clerk, and he would either have lived here with us or I should have had to pay him enough to keep house for himself. Now in fact you are a clerk; for though you are only here for six hours a week--you do all the work there is to do, and no clerk could do more. Well, we have got an attic upstairs which is not used, and if you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7831"],["title","When London Burned : a Story of Restoration Times and the Great Fire (#5)"],["body","to come here and live with us, my wife and I will make you heartily welcome.\"  \"Thank you, indeed,\" Cyril said warmly. \"It is of all things what I should like; but of course I should wish to pay you for my board. I can afford to do so if you will employ me for the same hours as at present.\"  \"No, I would not have that, lad; but if you like we can reckon your board against what I now pay you. We feed John Wilkes and the two apprentices, and one mouth extra will make but little difference. I don't want it to be a matter of obligation, so we will put your board against the work you do for me. I shall consider that we are making a good bargain.\"  \"It is your pleasure to say so, sir, but I cannot tell you what a load your kind offer takes off my mind. The future has seemed very dark to me.\"  \"Very well. That matter is settled, then. Come upstairs with me and I will present you to my wife and daughter; they have heard me speak of you so often that they will be glad to see you. In the first place, though, I must ask you your name. Since you first signed articles and entered the crew I have never thought of asking you.\"  \"My name is Cyril, sir--Cyril Shenstone.\"  His employer nodded and at once led the way upstairs. A motherly looking woman rose from the seat where she was sitting at work, as they entered the living-room.  \"This is my Prince of Scriveners, Mary, the lad I have often spoken to you about. His name is Cyril; he has accepted the proposal we talked over last night, and is going to become one of the crew on board our ship.\"  \"I am glad to see you,\" she said to Cyril, holding out her hand to him. \"I have not met you before, but I feel very grateful to you. Till you came, my husband was bothered nearly out of his wits; he used to sit here worrying over his books, and writing from the time the shop closed till the hour for bed, and Nellie and I dared not to say as much as a word. Now we see no more of his books, and he is able to go out for a walk in the fields with us as he used to do before.\"  \"It is very kind of you to say so, Mistress,\" Cyril said earnestly; \"but it is I, on the contrary, who am deeply grateful to you for the offer Captain Dave has been good enough to make me. You cannot tell the pleasure it has given me, for you cannot understand how lonely and friendless I have been feeling. Believe me, I will strive to give you as little trouble as possible, and to conform myself in all ways to your wishes.\"  At this moment Nellie Dowsett came into the room. She was a pretty girl some eighteen years of age.  \"This is Cyril, your father's assistant, Nellie,\" her mother said.  \"You are welcome, Master Cyril. I have been wanting to see you. Father has been praising you up to the skies so often that I have had quite a curiosity to see what you could be like.\"  \"Your father is altogether too good, Mistress Nellie, and makes far more of my poor ability than it deserves.\"  \"And is he going to live with us, mother?\" Nellie asked.  \"Yes, child; he has accepted your father's offer.\"  Nellie clapped her hands.  \"That is good,\" she said. \"I shall expect you to escort me out sometimes, Cyril. Father always wants me to go down to the wharf to look at the ships or to go into the fields; but I want to go sometimes to see the fashions, and there is no one to take me, for John Wilkes always goes off to smoke a pipe with some sailor or other, and the apprentices are stupid and have nothing to say for themselves; and besides, one can't walk alongside a boy in an apprentice cap.\"  \"I shall be very happy to, Mistress, when my work is done, though I fear that I shall make but a poor escort, for indeed I have had no practice whatever in the esquiring of dames.\"  \"I am sure you will do very well,\" Nellie said, nodding approvingly. \"Is it true that you have been in France? Father said he was told so.\"  \"Yes; I have lived almost all my life in France.\"  \"And do you speak French?\"  \"Yes; I speak it as well as English.\"  \"It must have been very hard to learn?\"  \"Not at all. It came to me naturally, just as English did.\"  \"You must not keep him any longer now, Nellie; he has other appointments to keep, and when he has done that, to go and pack up his things and see that they are brought here by a porter. He can answer some more of your questions when he comes here this evening.\"  Cyril returned to Holborn with a lighter heart than he had felt for a long time. His preparations for the move took him but a short time, and two hours later he was installed in a little attic in the ship-chandler's house. He spent half-an-hour in unpacking his things, and then heard a stentorian shout from below,--  \"Masthead, ahoy! Supper's waiting.\"  Supposing that this hail was intended for himself, he at once went downstairs. The table was laid. Mistress Dowsett took her seat at the head; her husband sat on one side of her, and Nellie on the other. John Wilkes sat next to his master, and beyond him the elder of the two apprentices. A seat was left between Nellie and the other apprentice for Cyril.  \"Now our crew is complete, John,\" Captain Dave said. \"We have been wanting a supercargo badly.\"  \"Ay, ay, Captain Dave, there is no doubt we have been short-handed in that respect; but things have been more ship-shape lately.\"  \"That is so, John. I can make a shift to keep the vessel on her course, but when it comes to writing up the log, and keeping the reckoning, I make but a poor hand at it. It was getting to be as bad as that voyage of the _Jane_ in the Levant, when the supercargo had got himself stabbed at Lemnos.\"  \"I mind it, Captain--I mind it well. And what a trouble there was with the owners when we got back again!\"  \"Yes, yes,\" the Captain said; \"it was worse work than having a brush with a Barbary corsair. I shall never forget that day. When I went to the office to report, the three owners were all in.  \"'Well, Captain Dave, back from your voyage?' said the littlest of the three. 'Made a good voyage, I hope?'  \"First-rate, says I, except that the supercargo got killed at Lemnos by one of them rascally Greeks.  \"'Dear, dear,' said another of them--he was a prim, sanctimonious sort--'Has our brother Jenkins left us?'  \"I don't know about his leaving us, says I, but we left him sure enough in a burying-place there.  \"'And how did you manage without him?'  \"I made as good a shift as I could, I said. I have sold all the cargo, and I have brought back a freight of six tons of Turkey figs, and four hundred boxes of currants. And these two bags hold the difference.  \"'Have you brought the books with you, Captain?'  \"Never a book, said I. I have had to navigate the ship and to look after the crew, and do the best I could at each port. The books are on board, made out up to the day before the supercargo was killed, three months ago; but I have never had time to make an entry since.  \"They looked at each other like owls for a minute or two, and then they all began to talk at once. How had I sold the goods? had I charged the prices mentioned in the invoice? what percentage had I put on for profit? and a lot of other things. I waited until they were all out of breath, and then I said I had not bothered about invoices. I knew pretty well the prices such things cost in England. I clapped on so much more for the expenses of the voyage and a fair profit. I could tell them what I had paid for the figs and the currants, and for some bags of Smyrna sponges I had bought, but as to the prices I had charged, it was too much to expect that I could carry them in my head. All I knew was I had paid for the things I had bought, I had paid all the port dues and other charges, I had advanced the men one-fourth of their wages each month, and I had brought them back the balance.  \"Such a hubbub you never heard. One would have thought they would have gone raving mad. The sanctimonious partner was the worst of the lot. He threatened me with the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen, and went on till I thought he would have had a fit.  \"Look here, says I, at last, I'll tell you what I will do. You tell me what the cargo cost you altogether, and put on so much for the hire of the ship. I will pay you for them and settle up with the crew, and take the cargo and sell it. That is a fair offer. And I advise you to keep civil tongues in your heads, or I will knock them off and take my chance before the Lord Mayor for assault and battery.  \"With that I took off my coat and laid it on a bench. I reckon they saw that I was in earnest, and they just sat as mum as mice. Then the little man said, in a quieter sort of voice,--  \"'You are too hasty, Captain Dowsett. We know you to be an honest man and a good sailor, and had no suspicion that you would wrong us; but no merchant in the City of London could hear that his business had been conducted in such a way as you have carried it through without for a time losing countenance. Let us talk the matter over reasonably and quietly.'  \"That is just what I am wanting, I said; and if there hasn't been reason and quiet it is from no fault of mine.  \"'Well, please to put your coat on again, Captain, and let us see how matters stand!'  \"Then they took their ink-horns and pens, and, on finding out what I had paid for the figs and other matters, they reckoned them up; then they put down what I said was due to the sailors and the mate and myself; then they got out some books, and for an hour they were busy reckoning up figures; then they opened the bags and counted up the gold we had brought home. Well, when they had done, you would hardly have known them for the same men. First of all, they went through all their calculations again to be sure they had made no mistake about them; then they laid down their pens, and the sanctimonious man mopped the perspiration from his face, and the others smiled at each other. Then the biggest of the three, who had scarcely spoken before, said,--  \"'Well, Captain Dowsett, I must own that my partners were a little hasty. The"]]]
