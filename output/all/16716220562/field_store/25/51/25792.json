The Liverpool tide tables give the heights above the Old Dock Sill, which is now non-existent, but the level of it has been carefully preserved near the same position, on a stone built into the western wall of the Canning Half Tide Dock. This level is 40 ft below Ordnance datum. At Bristol the levels are referred to the Old Cumberland Basin (O.C.B.), which is an imaginary line 58 ft below Ordnance datum. It is very desirable that for sewage work all tide levels should be reduced to Ordnance datum.  A critical examination of the charts obtained from the tide- recording instruments will show that the mean level of the sea does not agree with the level of Ordnance datum. Ordnance datum is officially described as the assumed mean water level at Liverpool, which was ascertained from observations made by the Ordnance Survey Department in March, 1844, but subsequent records taken in May and June, 1859, by a self-recording gauge on St. George's Pier, showed that the true mean level of the sea at Liverpool is 0.068 ft below the assumed level. The general mean level of the sea around the coast of England, as determined by elaborate records taken at 29 places during the years 1859-60, was originally said to be, and is still, officially recognised by the Ordnance Survey Department to be 0.65 ft, or 7.8 in, above Ordnance datum, but included in these 29 stations were 8 at which the records were admitted to be imperfectly taken. If these 8 stations are omitted from the calculations, the true general mean level of the sea would be 0.623 ft, or 7.476 in, above Ordnance datum, or 0.691 ft above the true mean level of the sea at Liverpool. The local mean seal level at various stations around the coast varies from 0.982 ft below the general mean sea level at Plymouth, to 1.260 ft above it at Harwich, the places nearest to the mean being Weymouth (.089 ft below) and Hull (.038 ft above).  It may be of interest to mention that Ordnance datum for Ireland is the level of low water of spring tides in Dublin Bay, which is 21 ft below a mark on the base of Poolbeg Lighthouse, and 7.46 ft below English Ordnance datum.  The lines of \"high and low water mark of ordinary tides\" shown upon Ordnance maps represent mean tides; that is, tides halfway between the spring and the neap tides, and are generally surveyed at the fourth tide before new and full moon. The foreshore of tidal water below \"mean high water\" belongs to the Crown, except in those cases where the rights have been waived by special grants. Mean high water is, strictly speaking, the average height of all high waters, spring and neap, as ascertained over a long period. Mean low water of ordinary spring tides is the datum generally adopted for the soundings on the Admiralty Charts, although it is not universally adhered to; as, for instance, the soundings in Liverpool Bay and the river Mersey are reduced to a datum 20 ft below the old dock sill, which is 125 ft below the level of low water of ordinary spring tides. The datum of each chart varies as regards Ordnance datum, and in the case of charts embracing a large area the datum varies along the coast.  The following table gives the fall during each half-hour of the typical tides shown in Fig, 6 (see page 15), from which it will be seen that the maximum rate occurs at about half-tide, while very little movement takes place during the half-hour before and the half-hour after the turn of the tide:--  Table I.

The varying differences between the night and morning tides are shown very clearly on this diagram; in some cases the night tide is the higher one, and in others the morning tide; and while at one time each successive tide is higher than the preceding one, at another time the steps showing: the set-back of the tide are very marked. During the earlier part of the year the spring-tides at new moon were higher than those at full moon, but towards June the condition became reversed. The influence of the position of the sun and moon on the height of the tide is apparent throughout, but is particularly marked during the exceptionally low spring tides in the early part of June, when the time of new moon practically coincides with the moon in apogee and in its most northerly position furthest removed from the equator.  Inasmuch as the tidal waves themselves have no horizontal motion, it is now necessary to consider by what means the movement of water along the shores is caused. The sea is, of course, subject to the usual law governing the flow of water, whereby it is constantly trying to find its own level. In a tidal wave the height of the crest is so small compared with the length that the surface gradient from crest to trough is practically flat, and does not lead to any appreciable movement; but as the tidal wave approaches within a few miles of the shore, it runs into shallow water, where its progress is checked, but as it is being pushed on from behind it banks up and forms a crest of sufficient height to form a more or less steep gradient, and to induce a horizontal movement of the particles of water throughout the whole depth in the form of a tidal current running parallel with the shore.  The rate of this current depends upon the steepness of the gradient, and the momentum acquired will, In some Instances, cause the current to continue to run in the same direction for some time after the tide has turned, i.e., after the direction of the gradient has been reversed; so that the tide may be making--or falling--in one direction, while the current is running the opposite way. It will be readily seen, then, that the flow of the current will be slack about the time of high and low water, so that its maximum rate will be at half-ebb and half-flood. If the tide were flowing into an enclosed or semi- enclosed space, the current could not run after the tide turned, and the reversal of both would be simultaneous, unless, indeed, the current turned before the tide.  Wind waves are only movements of the surface of the water, and do not generally extend for a greater depth below the trough of the wave than the crest is above it, but as they may affect the movement of the floating particles of sewage to a considerable extent it is necessary to record the direction and strength of the wind.  The strength of the wind is sometimes indicated wind at the time of making any tidal observations. By reference to the Beaufort Scale, which is a graduated classification adopted by Admiral Beaufort about the year 1805. The following table gives the general description, velocity, and pressure of the wind corresponding to the tabular numbers on the scale:--  [Illustration: PLATE III  PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS.  To face page 20]  The figures indicating the pressure of the wind in the foregoing table are low compared with those given by other authorities. From Mutton's formula, the pressure against a plane surface normal to the wind would be 0.97 lb per sq. foot, with an average velocity of 15 miles per hour (22 ft per sec.), compared with o.67 lb given by Admiral Beaufort, and for a velocity of 50 miles per hour (73.3 ft per sec.) 10.75 lb, compared with 7.7lb Semitone's formula, which is frequently used, gives the pressure as 0.005V^2 (miles per hour), so that for 15 miles per hour velocity the pressure would be 1.125 lb, and for 50 miles it would be l2.5 lb It must not be forgotten, however, that, although over a period of one hour the wind may _average_ this velocity or pressure, it will vary considerably from moment to moment, being far in excess at one time, and practically calm at another. The velocity of the wind is usually taken by a cup anemometer having four 9 in cups on arms 2 ft long. The factor for reducing the records varies from 2 to 3, according to the friction and lubrication, the average being 2.2.  The pressure is obtained by multiplying the Beaufort number cubed by 0.0105; and the velocity is found by multiplying the square root of the Beaufort number cubed by 1.87.  A tidal wave will traverse the open sea in a straight line, but as it passes along the coast the progress of the line nearest the shore is retarded while the centre part continues at the same velocity, so that on plan the wave assumes a convex shape and the branch waves reaching the shore form an acute angle with the coast line.     CHAPTER III.  CURRENT OBSERVATIONS.   There is considerable diversity in the design of floats employed in current observations, dependant to some extent upon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7980"],["title","The Sewerage of Sea Coast Towns (#4)"],["body","it is desired to ascertain the direction of the surface drift or of a deep current, it does not by any means follow that they run in simultaneous directions. There is also sometimes considerable difference in the velocity of the current at different depths--the surface current being more susceptible to influence of wind. A good form of deep float is seen in Fig. 8. It consists of a rod 2 in by 2 in, or 4 sq in The lower end of which a hollow wooden box about 6 in by 6 in is fixed, into which pebbles are placed to overcome the buoyancy of the float and cause it to take and maintain an upright position in the water with a length of 9in of the rod exposed above the surface. A small hole is formed in the top of the box for the insertion the pebbles, which is stopped up with a cork when the float is adjusted. The length of the rod will vary according to the depth of water, but it will generally be found convenient to employ a float about 10 ft and to have a spare one about 6 ft deep, but otherwise it is similar in all respects, for use in shallow water. A cheap float for gauging the surface drift can be made from an empty champagne bottle weighted with stones and partly filled with water. The top 12 in of rods and the cord and neck of the bottle, as the case may be, should be painted red, as this colour renders floats more conspicuous when in the water and gives considerable assistance in locating their position, especially when they are at some distance from the observer.  A deep-sea float designed by Mr. G. P. Bidden for ascertaining the set of the currents along the base of the ocean has recently been used by the North Sea Fisheries Investigation Committee. It consists of a bottle shaped like a soda-water bottle, made of strong glass to resist the pressure of the water, and partly filled with water, so that just sufficient air is left in it to cause it to float. A length of copper wire heavy enough to cause it to sink is then attached to the bottle, which is then dropped into the sea at a defined place. When the end of the wire touches the bottom the bottle is relieved of some of its weight and travels along with the currents a short distance above the bed of the sea. About 20 per cent. of the bottles were recovered, either by being thrown up on the beach or by being fished up in trawl nets.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--DETAIL OF WOOD TIDAL FLOAT 10 FEET DEEP.]  A double float, weighing about 10 lb complete, was used for the tidal observations for the Girdleness outfall sewer, Aberdeen. The surface portion consisted of two sheet-iron cups soldered together, making a float 9 in in diameter and 6 in deep. The lower or submerged portion was made of zinc, cylindrical in shape, 16 in diameter and 16 in long, perforated at intervals with lin diameter holes and suspended by means of a brass chain from a swivel formed on the underside of the surface float.  In gauging the currents the float is placed in the water at a defined point and allowed to drift, its course being noted and afterwards transferred to a plan. The time of starting should be recorded and observations of its exact position taken regularly at every quarter of an hour, so that the time taken in covering any particular distance is known and the length of travel during any quarter-hour period multiplied by four gives the speed of the current at that time in miles per hour.  The method to be employed in ascertaining the exact position of the float from time to time is a matter which requires careful consideration, and is dependent upon the degree of accuracy required according to the importance of the scheme and the situation of neighbouring towns, frequented shores, oyster beds, and other circumstances likely to be injuriously affected by any possible or probable pollution by sewage.  One method is to follow the float in a small boat carrying a marine compass which has the card balanced to remain in a horizontal position, irrespective of the tipping and rolling of the boat, and to observe simultaneously the bearing of two prominent landmarks, the position of which on the plan is known, at each of the quarter-hour periods at which the observations are to be taken. This method only gives very approximate results, and after checking the value of the observations made by its use, with contemporary observations taken by means of theodolites on the shore, the writer abandoned the system in favour of the theodolite method, which, however, requires a larger staff, and is therefore more expensive. In every case it is necessary to employ a boat to follow the float, not only so as to recover it at the end of each day's work, but principally to assist in approximately locating the float, which can then be found more readily when searching through the telescope of the theodolite. The boat should be kept about 10 ft to 20 ft from the float on the side further removed from the observers, except when surface floats are being used to ascertain the effect of the wind, when the boat should be kept to leeward of the float. Although obviously with a large boat the observations can be pursued through rougher weather, which is an important point, still the difficulty of maintaining a large boat propelled by mechanical power, or sail, sufficiently near the float to assist the observers, prevents its use, and the best result will be obtained by employing a substantial, seaworthy rowing boat with a broad beam. The boatmen appreciate the inclusion of a mast, sails, and plenty of ballast in the equipment to facilitate their return home when the day's work is done, which may happen eight or nine miles away, with twilight fast passing into darkness. There should be two boatmen, or a man and a strong youth.  In working with theodolites, it is as well before starting to select observation stations at intervals along the coast, drive pegs in the ground so that they can easily be found afterwards, and fix their position upon a 1/2500 ordnance map in the usual manner. It may, however, be found in practice that after leaving one station it is not possible to reach the next one before the time arrives for another sight to be taken. In this case the theodolite must be set up on magnetic north at an intermediate position, and sights taken to at least two landmarks, the positions of which are shown on the map, and the point of observation subsequently plotted as near as possible by the use of these readings. Inasmuch as the sights will be taken from points on the edge of the shore, which is, of course, shown on the map, it is possible, after setting up to magnetic north, to fix the position with approximate accuracy by a sight to one landmark only, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances.  The method of taking the observations with two theodolites, as adopted by the writer, can best be explained by a reference to Fig. 9, which represents an indented piece of the coast. The end of the proposed sea outfall sewer, from which point the observations would naturally start, is marked 1, the numerals 2, 3, 4, etc., indicating the positions of the float as observed from time to time. Many intermediate observations would be taken, but in order to render the diagram more clear, these have not been shown. The lines of sight are marked 1A, 1B, etc. The points marked A1, A2, etc., indicate the first, second, etc., and subsequent positions of observer A; the points B1, B2, etc., referring to observer B. The dot-and-dash line shows the course taken by the float, which is ascertained after plotting the various observations recorded.  It is very desirable to have a horse and trap in waiting to move the observers and their instruments from place to place as required, and each observer should be provided with small flags about 2 ft square, one white and one blue, for signalling purposes.  The instruments are first set up at A1 and B1 respectively, and adjusted to read on to the predetermined point 1 where the float is to be put in Then as soon as the boatmen have reached the vicinity of this point, the observers can, by means of the flags, direct them which way to row so as to bring the boat to the exact position required, and when this is done the anchor is dropped until it is time to start, which is signalled by the observers holding the flags straight above their heads. This is also the signal used to indicate to the men that the day's work is finished, and they can pick up the float and start for home.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--PLAN OF INDENTED COAST-LINE LLUSTRATING METHOD OF TAKING CURRENT OBSERVATIONS WITH TWO THEODOLITES.]  Directly the float is put in the water, and at every even quarter of an hour afterwards, each observer takes a reading of its exact position, and notes the time. As soon as the readings are taken to the float in position 2, the observer A should take up his instrument and drive to A2, where he must set up ready to take reading 3 a quarter of an hour after reading 2. It will be noticed that he might possibly have been able to take the reading 3 from the position A1, but the angle made by the lines of sight from the two instruments would have been too acute for accurate work, and very probably the float would have been hidden by the headland, so that he could not take the reading at all. In order to be on the headland A4 at the proper time, A must be working towards it by getting to position A3 by the time reading 4 is due. Although the remainder of the course of the float can be followed from B1 and A4, the instruments would be reading too much in the same line, so that B must move to B2 and then after reading 5 and 6 he should move to B3. As the float returns towards the starting point, A can remain in the position A4 while B goes to B4 and then moves back along the shore as the float progresses.  The foregoing description is sufficient to indicate the general method of working, but the details will of course vary according to the configuration of the shore and the"]]]
