I knew something of that Victor de Mauleon, whom his Excellency did not wish to quarrel with; and it would be a kindly act to her relation if one could learn what became of Louise Duval.'  \"'I can put you on the way of learning all that his Excellency was likely to have known of her through correspondence.  I have often heard him quote, with praise, a saying so clever that it might have been Italian, \"Never write, never burn;\" that is, never commit yourself by a letter-- keep all letters that could put others in your power.  All the letters he received were carefully kept and labelled.  I sent them to his son in four large trunks.  His son, no doubt, has them still.'  \"Now, however, I have exhausted my budget.  I arrived at Paris last night.  I strongly advise you to come hither at once, if you still desire to prosecute your search.  \"You, Monsieur, can do what I could not venture to do; you can ask the son of Don Juan if, amid the correspondence of his father, which he may have preserved, there be any signed Marigny or Duval--any, in short, which can throw light on this very obscure complication of circumstances. A grand seigneur would naturally be more complaisant to a man of your station than he would be to an agent of police.  Don Juan's son, inheriting his father's title, is Monsieur le Marquis de Rochebriant; and permit me to add, that at this moment, as the journals doubtless inform you, all Paris resounds with the rumour of the coming war; and Monsieur de Rochebriant--who is, as I have ascertained, now in Paris--it may be difficult to find anywhere on earth a month or two hence.--I have the honour, with profound consideration, &c., &c.,  RENARD.\"  The day after the receipt of this letter Graham Vane was in Paris.     CHAPTER II.  Among things indescribable is that which is called \"Agitation\" in Paris-- \"Agitation\" without riot or violence--showing itself by no disorderly act, no turbulent outburst.  Perhaps the cafes are more crowded; passengers in the streets stop each other more often, and converse in small knots and groups; yet, on the whole, there is little externally to show how loudly the heart of Paris is beating.  A traveller may be passing through quiet landscapes, unconscious that a great battle is going on some miles off, but if he will stop and put his ear to the ground he will recognise by a certain indescribable vibration, the voice of the cannon.  But at Paris an acute observer need not stop and put his ear to the ground; he feels within himself a vibration--a mysterious inward sympathy which communicates to the individual a conscious thrill--when the passions of the multitude are stirred, no matter how silently.  Tortoni's cafe was thronged when Duplessis and Frederic Lemercier entered it: it was in vain to order breakfast; no table was vacant either within the rooms or under the awnings without.  But they could not retreat so quickly as they had entered.  On catching sight of the financier several men rose and gathered round him, eagerly questioning:  \"What do you think, Duplessis?  Will any insult to France put a drop of warm blood into the frigid veins of that miserable Ollivier?\"  \"It is not yet clear that France has been insulted, Messieurs,\" replied Duplessis, phlegmatically.  \"Bah!  Not insulted!  The very nomination of a Hohenzollern to the crown of Spain was an insult--what would you have more?\"  \"I tell you what it is, Duplessis,\" said the Vicomte de Breze, whose habitual light good temper seemed exchanged for insolent swagger--\"I tell you what it is, your friend the Emperor has no more courage than a chicken.  He is grown old, and infirm, and lazy; he knows that he can't even mount on horseback.  But if, before this day week, he has not declared war on the Prussians, he will be lucky if he can get off as quietly as poor Louis Philippe did under shelter of his umbrella, and ticketed 'Schmidt.'  Or could you not, M. Duplessis, send him back to London in a bill of exchange?\"  \"For a man of your literary repute, M. le Vicomte,\" said Duplessis, \"you indulge in a strange confusion of metaphors.  But, pardon me, I came here to breakfast, and I cannot remain to quarrel.  Come, Lemercier, let us take our chance of a cutlet at the Trois Freres.\"  \"Fox, Fox,\" cried Lemercier, whistling to a poodle that had followed him into the cafe, and, frightened by the sudden movement and loud voices of the habitues, had taken refuge under the table.  \"Your dog is poltron,\" said De Breze; \"call him Nap.\"  At this stroke of humour there was a general laugh, in the midst of which Duplessis escaped, and Frederic, having discovered and caught his dog, followed with that animal tenderly clasped in his arms.  \"I would not lose Fox for a great deal,\" said Lemercier with effusion; \"a pledge of love and fidelity from an English lady the most distinguished: the lady left me--the dog remains.\"  Duplessis smiled grimly: \"What a thoroughbred Parisian you are, my dear Frederic!  I believe if the tramp of the last angel were sounding, the Parisians would be divided into two sets: one would be singing the Marseillaise, and parading the red flag; the other would be shrugging their shoulders and saying, 'Bah! as if le Bon Dieu would have the bad taste to injure Paris--the Seat of the Graces, the School of the Arts, the Fountain of Reason, the Eye of the World;' and so be found by the destroying angel caressing poodles and making _bons mots_ about les femmes.\"  \"And quite right, too,\" said Lemercier, complacently; \"what other people in the world could retain lightness of heart under circumstances so unpleasant?  But why do you take things so solemnly?  Of course there will be war idle now to talk of explanations and excuses.  When a Frenchman says, 'I am insulted,' he is not going to be told that he is not insulted.  He means fighting, and not apologising.  But what if there be war?  Our brave soldiers beat the Prussians--take the Rhine--return to Paris covered with laurels; a new Boulevard de Berlin eclipses the Boulevard Sebastopol.  By the way, Duplessis, a Boulevard de Berlin will be a good speculation--better than the Rue de Louvier.  Ah! is not that my English friend, Grarm Varn?\" here, quitting the arm of Duplessis, Lemercier stopped a gentleman who was about to pass him unnoticing. \"_Bon jour, mon ami_! how long have you been at Paris?\"  \"I only arrived last evening,\" answered Graham, \"and my stay will be so short that it is a piece of good luck, my dear Lemercier, to meet with you, and exchange a cordial shake of the hand.\"  \"We are just going to breakfast at the Trois Freres--Duplessis and I-- pray join us.\"  \"With great pleasure--ah, M. Duplessis, I shall be glad to hear from you that the Emperor will be firm enough to check the advances of that martial fever which, to judge by the persons I meet, seems to threaten delirium.\"  Duplessis looked very keenly at Graham's face, as he replied slowly: \"The English, at least, ought to know that when the Emperor by his last reforms resigned his personal authority for constitutional monarchy, it ceased to be a question whether he could or could not be firm in matters that belonged to the Cabinet and the Chambers.  I presume that if Monsieur Gladstone advised Queen Victoria to declare war upon the Emperor of Russia, backed by a vast majority in Parliament, you would think me very ignorant of constitutional monarchy and Parliamentary government if I said, 'I hope Queen Victoria will resist that martial fever.'\"  \"You rebuke me very fairly, M. Duplessis, if you can show me that the two cases are analogous; but we do not understand in England that, despite his last reforms, the Emperor has so abnegated his individual ascendency, that his will, clearly and resolutely expressed, would not prevail in his Council and silence opposition in the Chambers.  Is it so?  I ask for information.\"  The three men were walking on towards the Palais Royal side by side while this conversation proceeded.  \"That all depends,\" replied Duplessis, \"upon what may be the increase of popular excitement at Paris.  If it slackens, the Emperor, no doubt, could turn to wise account that favourable pause in the fever.  But if it continues to swell, and Paris cries, 'War,' in a voice as loud as it cried to Louis Philippe 'Revolution,' do you think that the Emperor could impose on his ministers the wisdom of peace?  His ministers would be too terrified by the clamour to undertake the responsibility of opposing it-- they would resign.  Where is the Emperor to find another Cabinet? a peace Cabinet?  What and who are the orators for peace?--whom a handful!--who? Gambetta, Jules Favre, avowed Republicans,--would they even accept the post of ministers to Louis Napoleon?  If they did, would not their first step be the abolition of the Empire?  Napoleon is therefore so far a constitutional monarch in the same sense as Queen Victoria, that the popular will in the country (and in France in such matters Paris is the country) controls the Chambers, controls the Cabinet; and against the Cabinet the Emperor could not contend.  I say nothing of the army-- a power in France unknown to you in England, which would certainly fraternise with no peace party.  If war is proclaimed,--let England blame it if she will--she can't lament it more than I should: but let England blame the nation; let her blame, if she please, the form of the government, which rests upon popular suffrage; but do not let her blame our sovereign more than the French would blame her own, if compelled by the conditions on which she holds her crown to sign a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7746"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 10 (#2)"],["body","of war, which vast majorities in a Parliament just elected, and a Council of Ministers whom she could not practically replace, enforced upon her will.\"  \"Your observations, M. Duplessis, impress me strongly, and add to the deep anxieties with which, in common with all my countrymen, I regard the menacing aspect of the present hour.  Let us hope the best.  Our Government, I know, is exerting itself to the utmost verge of its power, to remove every just ground of offence that the unfortunate nomination of a German Prince to the Spanish throne could not fail to have given to French statesmen.\"  \"I am glad you concede that such a nomination was a just ground of offence,\" said Lemercier, rather bitterly; \"for I have met Englishmen who asserted that France had no right to resent any choice of a sovereign that Spain might make.\"  \"Englishmen in general are not very reflective politicians in foreign affairs,\" said Graham; \"but those who are must see that France could not, without alarm the most justifiable, contemplate a cordon of hostile states being drawn around her on all sides,--Germany, is, itself so formidable since the field of Sadowa, on the east; a German prince in the southwest; the not improbable alliance between Prussia and the Italian kingdom, already so alienated from the France to which it owed so much. If England would be uneasy were a great maritime power possessed of Antwerp, how much more uneasy might France justly be if Prussia could add the armies of Spain to those of Germany, and launch them both upon France.  But that cause of alarm is over--the Hohenzollern is withdrawn. Let us hope for the best.\"  The three men had now seated themselves at a table in the Trois Freres, and Lemercier volunteered the task of inspecting the menu and ordering the repast, still keeping guard on Fox.  \"Observe that man,\" said Duplessis, pointing towards a gentleman who had just entered; \"the other day he was the popular hero--now, in the excitement of threatened war, he is permitted to order his _bifteck_ uncongratulated, uncaressed; such is fame at Paris! here to-day and gone to-morrow.\"  \"How did the man become famous?\"  \"He is a painter, and refused a decoration--the only French painter who ever did.\"  \"And why refuse?\"  \"Because he is more stared at as the man who refused than he would have been as the man who accepted.  If ever the Red Republicans have their day, those among them most certain of human condemnation will be the coxcombs who have gone mad for the desire of human applause.\"  \"You are a profound philosopher, M. Duplessis.\"  \"I hope not--I have an especial contempt for philosophers.  Pardon me a moment--I see a man to whom I would say a word or two.\"  Duplessis crossed over to another table to speak to a middle-aged man of somewhat remarkable countenance, with the red ribbon in his buttonhole, in whom Graham recognised an ex-minister of the Emperor, differing from most of those at that day in his Cabinet, in the reputation of being loyal to his master and courageous against a mob.  Left thus alone with Lemercier, Graham said:  \"Pray tell me where I can find your friend the Marquis de Rochebriant. I called at his apartment this morning, and I was told that he had gone on some visit into the country, taking his valet, and the concierge could not give me his address.  I thought myself so lucky on meeting with you, who are sure to know.\"  \"No, I do not; it is some days since I saw Alain.  But Duplessis will be sure to know.\"  Here the financier rejoined them.  \"Mon cher, Grarm Varn wants to know for what Sabine shades Rochebriant has deserted the '_fumum opes strepitumque_' of the capital.\"  \"Ah! the Marquis is a friend of yours, Monsieur?\"  \"I can scarcely boast that honour, but he is an acquaintance whom I should be very glad to see again.\"  \"At this moment he is at the Duchesse de Tarascon's country-house near Fontainebleau; I had a hurried line from him two days ago stating that he was going there on her urgent invitation.  But he may return to-morrow; at all events he dines with me on the 8th, and I shall be charmed if you will do me the honour to meet him at my house.\"  \"It is an invitation too agreeable to refuse, and I thank you very much for it.\"  Nothing worth recording passed further in conversation between Graham and the two Frenchmen.  He left them smoking their cigars in the garden, and walked homeward by the Rue de Rivoli.  As he was passing beside the Magasin du Louvre he stopped, and made way for a lady crossing quickly out of the shop towards her carriage at the door.  Glancing at him with a slight inclination of her head in acknowledgment of his courtesy, the lady recognised his features,--  \"Ah, Mr. Vane!\" she cried, almost joyfully--\"you are then at Paris, though you have not come to see me.\"  \"I only arrived last night, dear Mrs. Morley,\" said Graham, rather embarrassed, \"and only on some matters of business which unexpectedly summoned me.  My stay will probably be very short.\"  \"In that case let me rob you of a few minutes--no, not rob you even of them; I can take you wherever you want to go, and as my carriage moves more quickly than you do on foot, I shall save you the minutes instead of robbing you of them.\"  \"You are most kind, but I was only going to my hotel, which is close by.\"  \"Then you have no excuse for not taking a short drive with me in the Champs Elysees--come.\"  Thus bidden, Graham could not civilly disobey.  He handed the fair American into her carriage, and seated himself by her side.     CHAPTER III.  \"Mr. Vane, I feel as if I had many apologies to make for the interest in your life which my letter to you so indiscreetly betrayed.\"  \"Oh, Mrs. Morley! you cannot guess how deeply that interest touched me.\"  \"I should not have presumed so far,\" continued Mrs. Morley, unheeding the interruption, \"if I had not been altogether in error as to the nature of your sentiments in a certain quarter.  In this you must blame my American rearing.  With us there are many flirtations between boys and girls which come to nothing; but when in my country a man like you meets with a woman like Mademoiselle Cicogna, there cannot be flirtation.  His attentions, his looks, his manner, reveal to the eyes of those who care enough for him to watch, one of two things--either he coldly admires and esteems, or he loves with his whole heart and soul a woman worthy to inspire such a love.  Well, I did watch, and I was absurdly mistaken.  I imagined that I saw love, and rejoiced for the sake of both of you to think so.  I know that in all countries, our own as well as yours, love is so morbidly sensitive and jealous that it is always apt to invent imaginary foes to itself.  Esteem and admiration never do that.  I thought that some misunderstanding, easily removed by the intervention of a third person, might have impeded the impulse of two hearts towards each other--and so I wrote.  I had assumed that you loved--I am humbled to the last degree-- you only admired and esteemed.\"  \"Your irony is very keen, Mrs. Morley, and to you it may seem very just.\"  \"Don't call me Mrs. Morley in that haughty tone of voice,--can't you talk to me as you would talk to a friend?  You only esteemed and admired-- there is an end of it.\"  \"No, there is not an end of it,\" cried Graham, giving way to an impetuosity of passion, which rarely, indeed, before another, escaped his self-control; \"the end of it to me is a life out of which is ever stricken such love as I could feel for woman.  To me true love can only come once.  It came with my first look on that fatal face--it has never left me in thought by day, in dreams by night.  The end of it to me is farewell to all such happiness as the one love of a life can promise-- but--\"  \"But what?\" asked Mrs. Morley, softly, and very much moved by the passionate earnestness of Graham's voice and words.  \"But,\" he continued with a forced smile, \"we Englishmen are trained to the resistance of absolute authority; we cannot submit all the elements that make up our being to the sway of a single despot.  Love is the painter of existence, it should not be its sculptor.\"  \"I do not understand the metaphor.\"  \"Love colours our life, it should not chisel its form.\"  \"My dear Mr. Vane, that is very cleverly said, but the human heart is too large and too restless to be quietly packed up in an aphorism.  Do you mean to tell me that if you found you had destroyed Isaura Cicogna's happiness as well as resigned your own, that thought would not somewhat deform the very shape you would give to your life?  Is it colour alone that your life would lose?\"  \"Ah, Mrs. Morley, do not lower your friend into an ordinary girl in whom idleness exaggerates the strength of any fancy over which it dreamily broods.  Isaura Cicogna has her occupations--her genius--her fame--her career.  Honestly speaking, I think that in these she will find a happiness that no quiet hearth could bestow.  I will say no more.  I feel persuaded that were we two united I could not make her happy.  With the irresistible impulse that urges the genius of the writer towards its vent in public sympathy and applause, she would chafe if I said, 'Be contented to be wholly mine.'  And if I said it not, and felt I had no right to say it, and allowed the full scope to her natural ambition, what then?  She would chafe yet more to find that I had no fellowship in her aims and ends--that where I should feel pride, I felt humiliation.  It would be so; I cannot help it, 'tis my nature.\"  \"So be it then.  When, next year perhaps, you visit Paris, you will be safe from my officious interference!  Isaura will be the wife of another.\"  Graham pressed his hand to his heart with the sudden movement of one who feels there an agonising spasm--his cheek, his very lips were bloodless.  \"I told you,\" he said bitterly, \"that your fears of my influence over the happiness of one so gifted, and so strong in such gifts, were groundless; you allow that I"]]]
