But later in the day came a third messenger with information that roused all Edward's ire; careless of each danger in the distance, he ever sprang into energy and vengeance when a foe was already in the field.  And the Lord Fitzhugh (the young nobleman before seen among the rebels at Olney, and who had now succeeded to the honours of his House) had suddenly risen in the North, at the head of a formidable rebellion. No man had so large an experience in the warfare of those districts, the temper of the people, and the inclinations of the various towns and lordships as Montagu; he was the natural chief to depute against the rebels.  Some animated discussion took place as to the dependence to be placed in the marquis at such a crisis; but while the more wary held it safer, at all hazards, not to leave him unemployed, and to command his services in an expedition that would remove him from the neighbourhood of his brother, should the latter land, as was expected, on the coast of Norfolk, Edward, with a blindness of conceit that seems almost incredible, believed firmly in the infatuated loyalty of the man whom he had slighted and impoverished, and whom, by his offer of his daughter to the Lancastrian prince, he had yet more recently cozened and deluded.  Montagu was hastily summoned, and received orders to march at once to the North, levy forces, and assume their command.  The marquis obeyed with fewer words than were natural to him, left the presence, sprang on his horse, and as he rode from the palace, drew a letter from his bosom.  \"Ah, Edward,\" said he, setting his teeth, \"so, after the solemn betrothal of thy daughter to my son, thou wouldst have given her to thy Lancastrian enemy.  Coward, to bribe his peace! recreant, to belie thy word!  I thank thee for this news, Warwick; for without that injury I feel I could never, when the hour came, have drawn sword against this faithless man,--especially for Lancaster.  Ay, tremble, thou who deridest all truth and honour! He who himself betrays, cannot call vengeance treason!\"  Meanwhile, Edward departed, for further preparations, to the Tower of London.  New evidences of the mine beneath his feet here awaited the incredulous king.  On the door of St. Paul's, of many of the metropolitan churches, on the Standard at Chepe, and on London Bridge, during the past night, had been affixed, none knew by whom, the celebrated proclamation, signed by Warwick and Clarence (drawn up in the bold style of the earl), announcing their speedy return, containing a brief and vigorous description of the misrule of the realm, and their determination to reform all evils and redress all wrongs.  [See, for this proclamation, Ellis's \"Original Letters,\" vol. i., second series, letter 42.]  Though the proclamation named not the restoration of the Lancastrian line (doubtless from regard for Henry's safety), all men in the metropolis were already aware of the formidable league between Margaret and Warwick.  Yet, even still, Edward smiled in contempt, for he had faith in the letter received from Clarence, and felt assured that the moment the duke and the earl landed, the former would betray his companion stealthily to the king; so, despite all these exciting subjects of grave alarm, the nightly banquet at the Tower was never merrier and more joyous.  Hastings left the feast ere it deepened into revel, and, absorbed in various and profound contemplation, entered his apartment.  He threw himself on a seat, and leaned his face on his hands.  \"Oh, no, no!\" he muttered; \"now, in the hour when true greatness is most seen, when prince and peer crowd around me for counsel, when noble, knight, and squire crave permission to march in the troop of which Hastings is the leader,--now I feel how impossible, how falsely fair, the dream that I could forget all--all for a life of obscurity, for a young girl's love!  Love! as if I had not felt its delusions to palling! love, as if I could love again: or, if love--alas, it must be a light reflected but from memory!  And Katherine is free once more!\" His eye fell as he spoke, perhaps in shame and remorse that, feeling thus now, he had felt so differently when he bade Sibyll smile till his return!  \"It is the air of this accursed court which taints our best resolves!\" he murmured, as an apology for himself; but scarcely was the poor excuse made, than the murmur broke into an exclamation of surprise and joy.  A letter lay before him; he recognized the hand of Katherine. What years had passed since her writing had met his eye, since the lines that bade him \"farewell, and forget!\"  Those lines had been blotted with tears, and these, as he tore open the silk that bound them--these, the trace of tears, too, was on them!  Yet they were but few, and in tremulous characters.  They ran thus:--  To-morrow, before noon, the Lord Hastings is prayed to visit one whose life he hath saddened by the thought and the accusation that she hath clouded and embittered his.               KATHERINE DE BONVILLE.  Leaving Hastings to such meditations of fear or of hope as these lines could call forth, we lead the reader to a room not very distant from his own,--the room of the illustrious Friar Bungey.  The ex-tregetour was standing before the captured Eureka, and gazing on it with an air of serio-comic despair and rage.  We say the Eureka, as comprising all the ingenious contrivances towards one single object invented by its maker, a harmonious compound of many separate details; but the iron creature no longer deserved that superb appellation, for its various members were now disjointed and dislocated, and lay pell- mell in multiform confusion.  By the side of the friar stood a female, enveloped in a long scarlet mantle, with the hood partially drawn over the face, but still leaving visible the hard, thin, villanous lips, the stern, sharp chin, and the jaw resolute and solid as if hewed from stone.  \"I tell thee, Graul,\" said the friar, \"that thou hast had far the best of the bargain.  I have put this diabolical contrivance to all manner of shapes, and have muttered over it enough Latin to have charmed a monster into civility.  And the accursed thing, after nearly pinching off three fingers, and scalding me with seething water, and spluttering and sputtering enough to have terrified any man but Friar Bungey out of his skin, is obstinatus ut mulum,--dogged as a mule; and was absolutely good for nought, till I happily thought of separating this vessel from all the rest of the gear, and it serves now for the boiling my eggs!  But by the soul of Father Merlin, whom the saints assoil, I need not have given myself all this torment for a thing which, at best, does the work of a farthing pipkin!\"  \"Quick, master; the hour is late!  I must go while yet the troopers and couriers and riders, hurrying to and fro, keep the gates from closing.  What wantest thou with Graul?\"  \"More reverence, child!\" growled the friar.  \"What I want of thee is briefly told, if thou hast the wit to serve me.  This miserable Warner must himself expound to me the uses and trick of his malignant contrivance.  Thou must find and bring him hither!\"  \"And if he will not expound?\"  \"The deputy governor of the Tower will lend me a stone dungeon, and, if need be, the use of the brake to unlock the dotard's tongue.\"  \"On what plea?\"  \"That Adam Warner is a wizard, in the pay of Lord Warwick, whom a more mighty master like myself alone can duly examine and defeat.\"  \"And if I bring thee the sorcerer, what wilt thou teach me in return?\"  \"What desirest thou most?\"  Graul mused, and said, \"There is war in the wind.  Graul follows the camp, her trooper gets gold and booty.  But the trooper is stronger than Graul; and when the trooper sleeps it is with his knife by his side, and his sleep is light and broken, for he has wicked dreams. Give me a potion to make sleep deep, that his eyes may not open when Graul filches his gold, and his hand may be too heavy to draw the knife from its sheath!\"  \"Immunda, detestabilis! thine own paramour!\"  \"He hath beat me with his bridle rein, he hath given a silver broad piece to Grisell; Grisell hath sat on his knee; Graul never pardons!\"  The friar, rogue as he was, shuddered.  \"I cannot help thee to murder, I cannot give thee the potion; name some other reward.\"  \"I go--\"  \"Nay, nay, think, pause.\"  \"I know where Warner is hid.  By this hour to-morrow night, I can place him in thy power.  Say the word, and pledge me the draught.\"  \"Well, well, mulier abominabilis!--that is, irresistible bonnibell.  I cannot give thee the potion; but I will teach thee an art which can make sleep heavier than the anodyne, and which wastes not like the essence, but strengthens by usage,--an art thou shalt have at thy fingers' ends, and which often draws from the sleeper the darkest secrets of his heart.\"  [We have before said that animal magnetism was known to Bungey, and familiar to the necromancers, or rather theurgists, of the Middle Ages.]  \"It is magic,\" said Graul, with joy.  \"Ay, magic.\"  \"I will bring thee the wizard.  But listen; he never stirs abroad, save with his daughter.  I must bring both.\"  \"Nay, I want not the girl.\"  \"But I dare not throttle her, for a great lord loves her, who would find out the deed and avenge it; and if she be left behind, she will go to the lord, and the lord will discover what thou hast done with the wizard, and thou wilt hang!\"  \"Never say 'Hang' to me, Graul: it is ill-mannered and ominous.  Who is the lord?\"  \"Hastings.\"  \"Pest!--and already he hath been searching for the thing yonder; and I have brooded over it night and day, like a hen over a chalk egg,--only that the egg does not snap off the hen's claws, as that diabolism would fain snap off my digits.  But the war will carry Hastings away in its whirlwind; and, in danger, the duchess is my slave, and will bear me through all.  So, thou mayst bring the girl; and strangle her not; for no good ever"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7724"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 10 (#4)"],["body"," of a murder,--unless, indeed, it be absolutely necessary!\"  \"I know the men who will help me, bold ribauds, whom I will guerdon myself; for I want not thy coins, but thy craft.  When the curfew has tolled, and the bat hunts the moth, we will bring thee the quarry--\"  Graul turned; but as she gained the door, she stopped, and said abruptly, throwing back her hood,--  \"What age dost thou deem me?\"  \"Marry,\" quoth the friar, \"an' I had not seen thee on thy mother's knee when she followed my stage of tregetour, I should have guessed thee for thirty; but thou hast led too jolly a life to look still in the blossom.  Why speer'st thou the question?\"  \"Because when trooper and ribaud say to me, 'Graul, thou art too worn and too old to drink of our cup and sit in the lap, to follow the young fere to the battle, and weave the blithe dance in the fair,' I would depart from my sisters, and have a hut of my own, and a black cat without a white hair, and steal herbs by the new moon, and bones from the charnel, and curse those whom I hate, and cleave the misty air on a besom, like Mother Halkin of Edmonton.  Ha, ha! Master, thou shalt present me then to the Sabbat.  Graul has the mettle for a bonny witch!\"  The tymbestere vanished with a laugh.  The friar muttered a paternoster for once, perchance, devoutly, and after having again deliberately scanned the disjecta membra of the Eureka, gravely took forth a duck's egg from his cupboard, and applied the master-agent of the machine which Warner hoped was to change the face of the globe to the only practical utility it possessed to the mountebank's comprehension.     CHAPTER V.  THE MEETING OF HASTINGS AND KATHERINE.  The next morning, while Edward was engaged in levying from his opulent citizens all the loans he could extract, knowing that gold is the sinew of war; while Worcester was manning the fortress of the Tower, in which the queen, then near her confinement, was to reside during the campaign; while Gloucester was writing commissions to captains and barons to raise men; while Sir Anthony Lord Rivers was ordering improvements in his dainty damasquine armour, and the whole Fortress Palatine was animated and alive with the stir of the coming strife,-- Lord Hastings escaped from the bustle, and repaired to the house of Katherine.  With what motive, with what intentions, was not known clearly to himself,--perhaps, for there was bitterness in his very love for Katherine, to enjoy the retaliation due to his own wounded pride, and say to the idol of his youth, as he had said to Gloucester, \"Time is, time was;\" perhaps with some remembrance of the faith due to Sibyll, wakened up the more now that Katherine seemed actually to escape from the ideal image into the real woman,--to be easily wooed and won.  But, certainly, Sibyll's cause was not wholly lost, though greatly shaken and endangered, when Lord Hastings alighted at Lady Bonville's gate; but his face gradually grew paler, his mien less assured, as he drew nearer and nearer to the apartment and the presence of the widowed Katherine.  She was seated alone, and in the same room in which he had last seen her.  Her deep mourning only served, by contrasting the pale and exquisite clearness of her complexion, to enhance her beauty. Hastings bowed low, and seated himself by her side in silence.  The Lady of Bonville eyed him for some moments with an unutterable expression of melancholy and tenderness.  All her pride seemed to have gone; the very character of her face was changed: grave severity had become soft timidity, and stately self-control was broken into the unmistaken struggle of hope and fear.  \"Hastings--William!\" she said, in a gentle and low whisper, and at the sound of that last name from those lips, the noble felt his veins thrill and his heart throb.  \"If,\" she continued, \"the step I have taken seems to thee unwomanly and too bold, know, at least, what was my design and my excuse.  There was a time\" (and Katherine blushed) \"when, thou knowest well, that, had this hand been mine to bestow, it would have been his who claimed the half of this ring.\"  And Katherine took from a small crystal casket the well-remembered token.  \"The broken ring foretold but the broken troth,\" said Hastings, averting his face.  \"Thy conscience rebukes thy words,\" replied Katherine, sadly; \"I pledged my faith, if thou couldst win my father's word.  What maid, and that maid a Nevile, could so forget duty and honour as to pledge thee more?  We were severed.  Pass--oh, pass over that time!  My father loved me dearly; but when did pride and ambition ever deign to take heed of the wild fancies of a girl's heart?  Three suitors, wealthy lords, whose alliance gave strength to my kindred in the day when their very lives depended on their swords, were rivals for Earl Salisbury's daughter.  Earl Salisbury bade his daughter choose.  Thy great friend and my own kinsman, Duke Richard of York, himself pleaded for thy rivals.  He proved to me that my disobedience--if, indeed, for the first time, a child of my House could disobey its chief--would be an external barrier to thy fortune; that while Salisbury was thy foe, he himself could not advance thy valiancy and merit; that it was with me to forward thy ambition, though I could not reward thy love; that from the hour I was another's, my mighty kinsmen themselves--for they were generous--would be the first to aid the duke in thy career. Hastings, even then I would have prayed, at least, to be the bride, not of man, but God.  But I was trained--as what noble demoiselle is not?--to submit wholly to a parent's welfare and his will.  As a nun, I could but pray for the success of my father's cause; as a wife, I could bring to Salisbury and to York the retainers and strongholds of a baron.  I obeyed.  Hear me on.  Of the three suitors for my hand, two were young and gallant,--women deemed them fair and comely; and had my choice been one of these, thou mightest have deemed that a new love had chased the old.  Since choice was mine, I chose the man love could not choose, and took this sad comfort to my heart, 'He, the forsaken Hastings, will see in my very choice that I was but the slave of duty, my choice itself my penance.'\"  Katherine paused, and tears dropped fast from her eyes.  Hastings held his hand over his countenance, and only by the heaving of his heart was his emotion visible.  Katherine resumed:--  \"Once wedded, I knew what became a wife.  We met again; and to thy first disdain and anger (which it had been dishonour in me to soothe by one word that said, 'The wife remembers the maiden's love'),--to these, thy first emotions, succeeded the more cruel revenge, which would have changed sorrow and struggle to remorse and shame.  And then, then--weak woman that I was!--I wrapped myself in scorn and pride.  Nay, I felt deep anger--was it unjust?--that thou couldst so misread and so repay the heart which had nothing left save virtue to compensate for love.  And yet, yet, often when thou didst deem me most hard, most proof against memory and feeling--But why relate the trial? Heaven supported me, and if thou lovest me no longer, thou canst not despise me.\"  At these last words Hastings was at her feet, bending over her hand, and stifled by his emotions.  Katherine gazed at him for a moment through her own tears, and then resumed:--  \"But thou hadst, as man, consolations no woman would desire or covet. And oh, what grieved me most was, not--no, not the jealous, the wounded vanity, but it was at least this self-accusation, this remorse--that--but for one goading remembrance, of love returned and love forsaken,--thou hadst never so descended from thy younger nature, never so trifled with the solemn trust of TIME.  Ah, when I have heard or seen or fancied one fault in thy maturer manhood, unworthy of thy bright youth, anger of myself has made me bitter and stern to thee; and if I taunted or chid or vexed thy pride, how little didst thou know that through the too shrewish humour spoke the too soft remembrance!  For this--for this; and believing that through all, alas! my image was not replaced, when my hand was free, I was grateful that I might still--\" (the lady's pale cheek grew brighter than the rose, her voice faltered, and became low and indistinct)--\"I might still think it mine to atone to thee for the past. And if,\" she added, with a sudden and generous energy, \"if in this I have bowed my pride, it is because by pride thou wert wounded; and now, at last, thou hast a just revenge.\"  O terrible rival for thee, lost Sibyll!  Was it wonderful that, while that head drooped upon his breast, while in that enchanted change which Love the softener makes in lips long scornful, eyes long proud and cold, he felt that Katherine Nevile--tender, gentle, frank without boldness, lofty without arrogance--had replaced the austere dame of Bonville, whom he half hated while he wooed,--oh, was it wonderful that the soul of Hastings fled back to the old time, forgot the intervening vows and more chill affections, and repeated only with passionate lips, \"Katherine, loved still, loved ever, mine, mine, at last!\"  Then followed delicious silence, then vows, confessions, questions, answers,--the thrilling interchange of hearts long divided, and now rushing into one.  And time rolled on, till Katherine, gently breaking from her lover, said,--  \"And now that thou hast the right to know and guide my projects, approve, I pray thee, my present purpose.  War awaits thee, and we must part a while!\"  At these words her brow darkened and her lip quivered.  \"Oh, that I should have lived to mourn the day when Lord Warwick, untrue to Salisbury and to York, joined his arms with Lancaster and Margaret,--the day when Katherine could blush for the brother she had deemed the glory of her House!  No, no\" (she continued, as Hastings interrupted her with generous excuses for the earl, and allusion to the known slights he had received),--\"no, no; make not"]]]
