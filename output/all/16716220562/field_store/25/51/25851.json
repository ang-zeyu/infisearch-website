Cook seems to have volunteered for the command without being actually asked, and, needless to say, was at once accepted.  In February he once more received his commission to command the Resolution, this time accompanied by the Discovery, a vessel very similar to the Adventure, his consort during the last voyage. Clerke, a master's mate in the Endeavour, and second lieutenant in the Resolution, was appointed as commander to the Discovery. He, like Cook, was fated not to return from this third journey to the great Pacific.  Others who had sailed with Cook before were ready to accompany him, once more to encounter privations and find new lands.  Cook's orders were long and detailed, but were to the effect that he was to proceed by way of the Cape of Good Hope to search in the Indian Ocean for the land recently seen by M. Kerguelen; thence via Tahiti, on to the coast of North America in about latitude 45 degrees, which he was to follow to latitude 65 degrees, searching especially for any channel which might lead to the north-east, as it was supposed there might be a passage communicating with Hudson's Bay. He was further to look for any passage north of North America to the Atlantic, and to make such other explorations as might seem fit to him. A money reward of 20,000 pounds was also offered in case of success in finding such a passage.  Chronometers were again carried, and more confidence in them being felt, more use was made of them.  Cook took with him Omai, a young Society islander, who had induced Captain Furneaux to take him to England, and whom Cook now engaged to return to his native country.  The ships sailed on July 11th, 1776, and arrived at Table Bay on October 18th.  Sailing thence on November 30th, he passed and roughly mapped Prince Edward's, Marion, and Croset's Islands, all of which had been discovered by Marion de Fresne. He then struck Kerguelen's Land, spent Christmas Day in one of its harbours, and mapped the eastern side of this large but desolate island. He was unaware that Kerguelen had visited this island a second time, and had gained much more information about it than he did in his first voyage.  Cook had taken on board at the Cape as many cattle, horses, bulls, cows, goats, and sheep as he could stow, with a view of landing them at Tahiti or elsewhere, and it is without surprise that we learn that after several weeks in these stormy seas a good many of them had died. When we consider the size of the ships the wonder is where they found room for these animals.  On January 26th the ships arrived in Tasmania, and anchored in Adventure Bay, principally with a view of getting fodder for the remaining cattle. Pigs were left here, according to Cook's usual custom.  After four days the ships sailed, and arrived in Queen Charlotte's Sound, New Zealand, on February 12th, 1777. Here Cook learnt the history of the attack on the Adventure's boat's crew from the chief who led it, but made no attempt at reprisals, although urged by many other natives to kill him. He seems to have been guided by the consideration that, as related by the natives, it was a dishonest act of barter on the part of one of the sailors which commenced the disturbance; and that occurring so long before, no good purpose would be served by punishment. It says much for his humane treatment of natives.  On leaving this, Cook records that he had at different times left about a dozen pigs in New Zealand. These increased, and stocked the whole island by the time the English settlers arrived.  On the way to Tahiti Cook fell across several islands belonging to what was afterwards called after him, the Cook Group. He visited Mangaia, Atiu, Takutea,* (* Spelt by Cook Mangeea, Wateeo, and Otakootaia.) and the Hervey Islands. Relations were established with the natives, and Cook was much interested at finding on Atiu three natives of the Society Islands, the survivors of twelve, who had been blown away in a canoe, and landed on this island, five hundred miles distant. As he remarks, this throws great light on the manner in which the different islands of the Pacific have been peopled.  Cook now made up his mind that he was too late to prosecute discovery this year on the American Continent, it being well into April, and being anxious to save the remaining cattle that he wished to land at Tahiti, and which had been taken on board especially for this purpose, the island being still far to windward, he bore away for the Friendly Islands for fodder and refreshments. He landed on Palmerston on the way--an island discovered last voyage--and arrived at Namuka* (* Cook's Anamooka.) on May 1st, with not a sick man in the ships.  The ships remained in the Friendly Group for two months and a half, visiting and mapping the different islands, and learning much of the manners of this interesting race, seeing their great concerted dances, and the ceremonies of coming of age of the heir to the throne. Cook here first became acquainted with the mysterious rite of Tabu, which was closely connected with his own death. A selection of useful animals, including horses, were left at Tongatabu.  While at the Friendly Islands Cook heard of the Fiji Group, and saw some of the natives, who had come over in a canoe. The intelligence he was able to gather concerning them was imperfect, and he saw no reason to justify a long detour to leeward to search for them, when his object was to stock the Society Islands with the animals he had. Had he known their size and importance, his course might possibly have been different. As it was, he sailed for Tahiti, and discovering Tubuai, one of the Austral Group, on his passage, arrived there on August 13th, 1777.  Six weeks were spent here, and the old friendships further cemented. Bulls and cows and other animals were presented to the king. Cook also attended at several ceremonies consequent on war being declared against Eimeo, which included the offering of the dead body of a man, previously killed for the purpose, to the war god. He positively refused to aid in this war, which very shortly came to an end.  Eimeo was next visited, and here the theft of a goat, which Cook intended to land at Huaheine, induced him to take severe measures to get it back. Several war canoes and houses were destroyed before it was returned. At Huaheine, Omai was established, with many valuable European articles in his possession. Here again Cook acted with considerable severity in the case of a thief cutting off his ears, and confining him on board. His action has been questioned, but considering his humane character, and the judgment that he always displayed in these questions, we are justified in believing that he had good reason for departing from his ordinary custom of mild treatment of natives. At Ulietea, or Raiatea, next visited, a midshipman and a seaman of the Discovery deserted. Cook took his usual step of confining some natives of importance, and informing their relatives that they would be retained until the deserters were returned. In this case he impounded the king's son and daughter, with the desired effect, as the stragglers were soon brought back from Bolabola, whither they had gone; but both Cook and Captain Clerke were nearly captured by the natives when on shore in the interval.  It is only surprising that more of Cook's people did not attempt to remain in these pleasant islands. The hardships of the sea press much on certain natures, and the allurements of the easy and careless life of a tropical island offered such a contrast, that it scarcely required the desire of the natives to get white men with their superior knowledge, and above all superior arms, to remain with them, to induce them to desert. This last, however, made desertion more easy, and had not Cook taken strong measures, no doubt the epidemic would have spread.  After visiting Bolabola, Cook sailed north, to prosecute the main object of his voyage, the exploration of the north-west coast of America. On December 24th he fell in with Christmas Island, which he so named from the season. After mapping it, and getting many turtle, he continued his course to the north, and discovered Atooi or Kauai, the western island of the Sandwich Group.  Communicating with this island and another, he finally left on February 3rd, 1778, and on March 7th made the coast of North America, a little south of the Columbia River. Gales ensued, and Cook missed the entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait, making the land again a little north of it.  Anchoring first in Nootka Sound in Vancouver Island--though Cook did not know it was an island--the ships continued their exploration to the north-west, skirting the coast as near as stormy weather permitted them, and calling at various places until the north-west extremity of the Alaska Peninsula was reached. In one place, afterwards called Cook's River, it was hoped that the desired passage eastward was found; but it was soon discovered that it was merely an inlet.  Passing through the Aleutian Chain, east of Unalaska, Cook visited that island, and continued his voyage through the Bering Sea, clinging to the land as much as possible, and finally got into Bering Strait. Here he had both continents in sight, and communicated with both sides.  Standing further north, he, in latitude 70 degrees 30 minutes north, came across the icy barrier of the Arctic Sea. After vainly trying for a passage in fog and strong wind, surrounded by loose ice, and after mapping a good deal of the shores on both sides, the ships again turned south at the end of August, exploring as they went first on the Asiatic side, and afterwards on the American, especially examining Norton Sound. In the beginning of October they once more arrived at Unalaska, and the Resolution having sprung a dangerous leak, the opportunity was taken to stop it.  On October 26th the ships sailed for the Sandwich Islands,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/811"],["title","The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (#0)"],["body","TRAGICAL HISTORY OF DOCTOR FAUSTUS  By Christopher Marlowe  From The Quarto Of 1616.

Not marching in the fields of Thrasymene,      Where Mars did mate the warlike Carthagens; [1]      Nor sporting in the dalliance of love,      In courts of kings where state is overturn'd;      Nor in the pomp of proud audacious deeds,      Intends our Muse to vaunt her [2] heavenly verse:      Only this, gentles,--we must now perform      The form of Faustus' fortunes, good or bad:      And now to patient judgments we appeal,      And speak for Faustus in his infancy.      Now is he born of parents base of stock,      In Germany, within a town call'd Rhodes:      At riper years, to Wittenberg he went,      Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up.      So much he profits in divinity,      That shortly he was grac'd with doctor's name,      Excelling all, and sweetly can dispute      In th' heavenly matters of theology;      Till swoln with cunning, of [3] a self-conceit,      His waxen wings did mount above his reach,      And, melting, heavens conspir'd his overthrow;      For, falling to a devilish exercise,      And glutted now with learning's golden gifts,      He surfeits upon [4] cursed necromancy;      Nothing so sweet as magic is to him,      Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss:      And this the man that in his study sits.           [Exit.]            FAUSTUS discovered in his study.       FAUSTUS. Settle thy studies, Faustus, and begin      To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess:      Having commenc'd, be a divine in show,      Yet level at the end of every art,      And live and die in Aristotle's works.      Sweet Analytics, 'tis thou hast ravish'd me!      Bene disserere est finis logices.      Is, to dispute well, logic's chiefest end?      Affords this art no greater miracle?      Then read no more; thou hast attain'd that end:      A greater subject fitteth Faustus' wit:      Bid Economy farewell, and Galen come:      Be a physician, Faustus; heap up gold,      And be eterniz'd for some wondrous cure:      Summum bonum medicinoe sanitas,      The end of physic is our body's health.      Why, Faustus, hast thou not attain'd that end?      Are not thy bills hung up as monuments,      Whereby whole cities have escap'd the plague,      And thousand [5] desperate maladies been cur'd?      Yet art thou still but Faustus, and a man.      Couldst thou make men to live eternally,      Or, being dead, raise them [6] to life again,      Then this profession were to be esteem'd.      Physic, farewell!  Where is Justinian?            [Reads.]      Si una eademque res legatur [7] duobus, alter rem,      alter valorem rei, &c.       A petty [8] case of paltry legacies!            [Reads.]      Exhoereditare filium non potest pater, nisi, &c. [9]       Such is the subject of the institute,      And universal body of the law:      This study fits a mercenary drudge,      Who aims at nothing but external trash;      Too servile and illiberal for me.      When all is done, divinity is best:      Jerome's Bible, Faustus; view it well.            [Reads.]      Stipendium peccati mors est.                                    Ha!                                         Stipendium, &c.       The reward of sin is death:  that's hard.            [Reads.]      Si peccasse negamus, fallimur, et nulla est in nobis veritas;       If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there      is no truth in us.  Why, then, belike we must sin, and so      consequently die:      Ay, we must die an everlasting death.      What doctrine call you this, Che sera, sera,      What will be, shall be?  Divinity, adieu!      These metaphysics of magicians,      And necromantic books are heavenly;      Lines, circles, scenes, letters, and characters; [10]      Ay, these are those that Faustus most desires.      O, what a world of profit and delight,      Of power, of honour, and omnipotence,      Is promis'd to the studious artizan!      All things that move between the quiet poles      Shall be at my command:  emperors and kings      Are but obeyed in their several provinces;      But his dominion that exceeds in this,      Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man;      A sound magician is a demigod:      Here tire, my brains, to gain [11] a deity.            Enter WAGNER.       Wagner, commend me to my dearest friends,      The German Valdes and Cornelius;      Request them earnestly to visit me.       WAGNER. I will, sir.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. Their conference will be a greater help to me      Than all my labours, plod I ne'er so fast.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       GOOD ANGEL. O, Faustus, lay that damned book aside,      And gaze not on it, lest it tempt thy soul,      And heap God's heavy wrath upon thy head!      Read, read the Scriptures:--that is blasphemy.       EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous art      Wherein all Nature's treasure is contain'd:      Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky,      Lord and commander of these [12] elements.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. How am I glutted with conceit of this!      Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please,      Resolve me of all ambiguities,      Perform what desperate enterprise [13] I will?      I'll have them fly to India for gold,      Ransack the ocean for orient pearl,      And search all corners of the new-found world      For pleasant fruits and princely delicates;      I'll have them read me strange philosophy,      And tell the secrets of all foreign kings;      I'll have them wall all Germany with brass,      And make swift Rhine circle fair [14] Wertenberg;      I'll have them fill the public schools with silk, [15]      Wherewith the students shall be bravely clad;      I'll levy soldiers with the coin they bring,      And chase the Prince of Parma from our land,      And reign sole king of all the provinces;      Yea, stranger engines for the brunt of war,      Than was the fiery keel at Antwerp-bridge,      I'll make my servile spirits to invent.            Enter VALDES and CORNELIUS.       Come, German Valdes, and Cornelius,      And make me blest [16] with your sage conference.      Valdes, sweet Valdes, and Cornelius,      Know that your words have won me at the last      To practice magic and concealed arts.      Philosophy is odious and obscure;      Both law and physic are for petty wits:      'Tis magic, magic that hath ravish'd me.      Then, gentle friends, aid me in this attempt;      And I, that have with subtle syllogisms      Gravell'd the pastors of the German church,      And made the flowering pride of Wittenberg      Swarm [17] to my problems, as th' infernal spirits      On sweet Musaeus when he came to hell,      Will be as cunning as Agrippa was,      Whose shadow made all Europe honour him.       VALDES. Faustus, these books, thy wit, and our experience,      Shall make all nations to [18] canonize us.      As Indian Moors obey their Spanish lords,      So shall the spirits of every element      Be always serviceable to us three;      Like lions shall they guard us when we please;      Like Almain rutters with their horsemen's staves,      Or Lapland giants, trotting by our sides;      Sometimes like women, or unwedded maids,      Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows      Than have [19] the white breasts of the"]]]
