You are way off. Why, he's been as interested in having you with us as I have; at least he has acted so.\"  \"_Acted_ is just the word,\" Van cut in. \"He has acted, all right. I guess you'll find he's been acting all the time. Honor bright, hasn't he said anything to you about me?\"  \"No, not one word.\" Then suddenly Bob flushed; the memory of his father's strange conversation about the boy's visit to the refinery rushed over him. \"Dad did say one thing which I did not understand at the time,\" he confessed reluctantly. \"Perhaps, though, he did not mean anything by it.\"  \"What was it?\"  Bob struggled to evade the issue.  \"Oh, it was nothing much.\"  \"Come, Bobbie, you and I are friends,\" interrupted Van, \"and we want to keep on being friends no matter how our fathers feel toward one another. If they have quarreled it is a great pity, but at least we needn't. The only way to straighten out this tangle is to be honest with each other and get at the truth; then, and not until then shall we know where we stand.\"  \"You're a brick, Van!\"  \"Come ahead then--let's have it. What was it your father said?\"  \"He merely asked whether it was your plan or mine to visit the refinery, and when I told him I suggested it he inquired all over again if I was sure you did not mention it first,\" Bob returned in very low tone. The words seemed wrung from him, and he colored as he repeated them.  \"Was that all?\"  \"Not quite. After I had convinced him that the trip was my own idea he said: '_Well, well--it can do no harm; the process is an open secret, anyway._'\"  \"You see I was right in my guess as to his feelings, Bobbie.\"  \"Maybe.\"  \"Of course I was; this proves it.\"  \"I'm afraid so,\" whispered Bob miserably.  \"Now all this may explain to you why I was so queer when we were at the refinery this morning,\" Van continued, once more reverting to the subject. \"Do you understand it any better?\"  \"I can see you didn't want Mr. Hennessey to tell you much about his processes.\"  \"You bet I didn't. I was in an awful hole. I got that letter from my father just before we left the house, and I was all upset over it. I didn't know what to do. It was bad enough to be visiting you without being shown all through your father's business plant as if I were an honored guest. It didn't seem as if I ought to go at all. If your father knew who I was he certainly couldn't want me to; and if he didn't it was worse yet. At first I thought the only honorable thing was to go straight to him and have it out; but I found I hadn't the nerve. Then I thought I'd ride with you to the factory and not go in. What I dreaded was that we might run into something that I should have no right to see, and that was precisely what happened.\"  \"So that was the reason you stopped Mr. Hennessey when he started to tell us the chemical formula?\"  \"Yes. He said it was a secret, and it seemed to me it would be wrong for me to listen. If I didn't know what that formula was I certainly couldn't tell it, and ignorance might help me out of an awkward position if any one should try to persuade me to.\"  \"You are a trump, old man.\"  \"It was only the square thing toward your father; he has been straight with me and I want to show him that I can be a gentleman, too.\"  The boys were silent for an interval; then Bob said:  \"Now about this snarl, Van--what are we going to do? Certainly we fellows are not going to let this feud of our fathers affect us.\"  \"Not by a jugful!\" retorted Van with spirit. \"The thing for us to do is to go right on being friends as if nothing had happened. It will make it all the easier that your father knows just who I am, and my father knows exactly who you are; it is franker and more in the open to have it so. If worse comes to worse we can talk the whole thing out with our families, and tell them how we feel. I am sure both your father and mine are too big to spoil a friendship like ours because of some fuss they had years and years ago. No, sir! I'm going to hold on to you, Bobbie, and,\" he added shyly, \"I'm going to hold on to your father, too, if he'll let me, for I like him.\"  \"I'm glad you like Dad,\" Bob said, flushing with pleasure. \"I do myself.\"  \"My dad isn't so bad, either,\" Van ventured with a dry little smile. \"Some time you shall see for yourself.\"  \"I hope so.\"  \"Then it is agreed that we'll stick together, no matter what happens,\" said Van solemnly.  \"Sure thing!\"  \"Promise.\"  \"You may bank on me,\" was Bob's earnest answer.     CHAPTER VII  MR. CARLTON MAKES A WAGER AND WINS   As the boys sat at dinner that evening Mr. Carlton inquired about their trip to the refinery, and with a humorous twinkle in his eye added:  \"I do not suppose you would care to put in another day on factory visiting, would you?\"  \"What do you mean, Dad?\" asked Bob.  \"I was wondering whether you would like to see where some of our sugar goes,\" was his father's answer. \"Would you be interested to take a tour through the Eureka Candy Factory to-morrow and learn how candy is made?\"  \"I should,\" responded Bob promptly.  \"And you, Van?\" demanded Mr. Carlton with a kindly smile.  \"I'd like it of all things,\" said Van, returning the smile frankly.  \"Very well. You shall spend to-morrow at the Eureka Company's factory. They are big customers of ours and when I telephoned them today they told me they would be glad to have you come, and promised to show you all about.\"  \"Are you sure they would want me to come, Mr. Carlton?\" asked Van, looking squarely into the eyes of the older man.  \"Why not? You're a chum of Bob's, aren't you?\"  \"Yes. But, you see, that isn't all.\"  With one searching glance Mr. Carlton scanned the lad's face.  \"No, Van,\" he replied with quiet emphasis, \"that is not all. You are more than Bob's chum--you are a friend of mine, too.\"  The boy flushed.  \"I'd like to think so, Mr. Carlton.\"  \"I want you to know so, Van. I happened to see Mr. Hennessey,\" he went on in a lower tone, \"and he related to me that incident at the factory. Of course he did not understand it, but I did--instantly. I appreciated your sense of honor, my boy.\"  \"I wanted to be square.\"  \"You were a gentleman in the very best sense of the word.\"  A great gladness glowed in Van's eyes, for terse as was the phrase it bore to him the very recognition he had coveted from Bob's father. Mr. Carlton, however, did not enlarge upon the subject, but casting it swiftly into the background asked:  \"Are you sure you both would rather spend your last morning in New York going through a candy factory than doing anything else? Factories are tiresome places, you must remember.\"  \"But a candy factory could never be tiresome!\" asserted Bob.  His father laughed.  \"There are just as many miles in a candy factory as any other,\" he replied. \"Any of the men who work there would tell you that, I fancy.\"  \"But they are such nice miles!\" argued Bob. \"Don't you say we go, Van?\"  \"I sure do. I want to see how they dip chocolates,\" Van answered.  \"It's all aboard to-morrow morning, then,\" Mr. Carlton said as he lit his after-dinner cigar.  \"There's one thing, Dad, that it's only fair to warn you about,\" called Bob, turning on the lowest step of the stairway to address his father. \"Our expedition may cost you something. You see they probably won't let us eat any candy at the factory; we'll just have to walk round with our eyes open and our hands crammed into our pockets to keep from swiping it. All the time we'll be getting up a tremendous candy appetite, and the minute we get outside we'll just have to make a bee-line for the first candy shop in sight and get filled up. So you must be prepared to cash in for refreshments.\"  The corners of Mr. Carlton's mouth twisted into an enigmatic smile.  \"I'll agree to pay for as much candy as you care to eat,\" he said, accepting the challenge without objection.  Bob stared at him.  \"Do you mean it?\"  \"Certainly. Why do you question it?\"  \"But\"--faltered Bob in amazement, \"you never promised anything like that before.\"  \"I may never promise it again, so make the most of it,\" was the dry retort.  Although Bob did not reply he by no means forgot the unprecedented offer, and that the memory of it might be equally fresh in his father's mind he spoke of it once again when the three parted the next morning.  \"Well, Dad, we're off for the Bonbon World,\" he called as he passed the library door where his father sat looking over the morning's mail. \"Remember you are going to O.K. any candy bills we run up.\"  \"I'm backing you for all you can eat,\" nodded Mr. Carlton.  \"Dad sure is game!\" Bob declared as he and Van stepped into the waiting motor-car and began their ride to the factory. \"He'll play it out, too. He never goes back on his word.\"  \"I'm afraid he'll be in for something then,\" grinned Van.  Both boys were more than ever convinced of the truth of this remark when they entered the factory and were greeted by the mingled aroma of chocolate, wintergreen and molasses.  \"I could eat ten pounds of chocolates this minute!\" exclaimed Van.  \"Go easy. Remember, we've got to wait until we have made the entire tour of this factory before we can have so much as a single caramel. You mustn't go getting up your appetite so soon.\"  \"But smell it, Bobbie! Why, the whole place is one mellifluous smudge. What do you say we chuck Colversham and get a job here? Think of having pounds of candy--tons of it--around all the time! Wouldn't it be a snap!\"  Van was cut short in his rhapsody by the approach of a pleasant faced lad of about his own age who was dressed from head to foot in white and wore a little white cap, across the front of which was printed in gold letters the word _Eureka_.  \"Are you Mr. Carlton?\" he inquired of Van.  \"I'm not, but my chum is.\"  \"We were expecting you,\" the boy answered, turning to Bob. \"I am to show you and your friend through the works. Will you kindly step this way?\"  Tagging at the heels of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7815"],["title","Hereward, the Last of the English (#0)"],["body","S.R.Ellison and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team         HEREWARD  THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH    CONTENTS.

The heroic deeds of Highlanders, both in these islands and elsewhere, have been told in verse and prose, and not more often, nor more loudly, than they deserve. But we must remember, now and then, that there have been heroes likewise in the lowland and in the fen. Why, however, poets have so seldom sung of them; why no historian, save Mr. Motley in his “Rise of the Dutch Republic,” has condescended to tell the tale of their doughty deeds, is a question not difficult to answer.  In the first place, they have been fewer in number. The lowlands of the world, being the richest spots, have been generally the soonest conquered, the soonest civilized, and therefore the soonest taken out of the sphere of romance and wild adventure, into that of order and law, hard work and common sense, as well as--too often--into the sphere of slavery, cowardice, luxury, and ignoble greed. The lowland populations, for the same reasons, have been generally the first to deteriorate, though not on account of the vices of civilization. The vices of incivilization are far worse, and far more destructive of human life; and it is just because they are so, that rude tribes deteriorate physically less than polished nations. In the savage struggle for life, none but the strongest, healthiest, cunningest, have a chance of living, prospering, and propagating their race. In the civilized state, on the contrary, the weakliest and the silliest, protected by law, religion, and humanity, have chance likewise, and transmit to their offspring their own weakliness or silliness. In these islands, for instance, at the time of the Norman Conquest, the average of man was doubtless superior, both in body and mind, to the average of man now, simply because the weaklings could not have lived at all; and the rich and delicate beauty, in which the women of the Eastern Counties still surpass all other races in these isles, was doubtless far more common in proportion to the numbers of the population.  Another reason--and one which every Scot will understand--why lowland heroes “carent vate sacro,” is that the lowlands and those who live in them are wanting in the poetic and romantic elements. There is in the lowland none of that background of the unknown, fantastic, magical, terrible, perpetually feeding curiosity and wonder, which still remains in the Scottish highlands; which, when it disappears from thence, will remain embalmed forever in the pages of Walter Scott. Against that half-magical background his heroes stand out in vivid relief; and justly so. It was not put there by him for stage purposes; it was there as a fact; and the men of whom he wrote were conscious of it, were moulded by it, were not ashamed of its influence. Nature among the mountains is too fierce, too strong, for man. He cannot conquer her, and she awes him. He cannot dig down the cliffs, or chain the storm-blasts; and his fear of them takes bodily shape: he begins to people the weird places of the earth with weird beings, and sees nixes in the dark linns as he fishes by night, dwarfs in the caves where he digs, half-trembling, morsels of copper and iron for his weapons, witches and demons on the snow-blast which overwhelms his herd and his hut, and in the dark clouds which brood on the untrodden mountain-peak. He lives in fear: and yet, if he be a valiant-hearted man, his fears do him little harm. They may break out, at times, in witch-manias, with all their horrible suspicions, and thus breed cruelty, which is the child of fear; but on the whole they rather produce in man thoughtfulness, reverence, a sense, confused yet precious, of the boundless importance of the unseen world. His superstitions develop his imagination; the moving accidents of a wild life call out in him sympathy and pathos; and the mountaineer becomes instinctively a poet.  The lowlander, on the other hand, has his own strength, his own “virtues,” or manfulnesses, in the good old sense of the word: but they are not for the most part picturesque or even poetical.  He finds out, soon enough for his weal and his bane, that he is stronger than Nature; and right tyrannously and irreverently he lords it over her, clearing, delving, diking, building, without fear or shame. He knows of no natural force greater than himself, save an occasional thunder-storm; and against that, as he grows more cunning, he insures his crops. Why should he reverence Nature? Let him use her, and eat. One cannot blame him. Man was sent into the world (so says the Scripture) to fill and subdue the earth. But he was sent into the world for other purposes, which the lowlander is but too apt to forget. With the awe of Nature, the awe of the unseen dies out in him. Meeting with no visible superior, he is apt to become not merely unpoetical and irreverent, but somewhat of a sensualist and an atheist. The sense of the beautiful dies out in him more and more. He has little or nothing around him to refine or lift up his soul, and unless he meet with a religion and with a civilization which can deliver him, he may sink into that dull brutality which is too common among the lowest classes of the English lowlands, and remain for generations gifted with the strength and industry of the ox, and with the courage of the lion, and, alas! with the intellect of the former, and the self-restraint of the latter.  But there may be a period in the history of a lowland race when they, too, become historic for a while. There was such a period for the men of the Eastern Counties; for they proved it by their deeds.  When the men of Wessex, the once conquering race of Britain, fell at Hastings once and for all, and struck no second blow, then the men of the Danelagh disdained to yield to the Norman invader. For seven long years they held their own, not knowing, like true Englishmen, when they were beaten; and fought on desperate, till there were none left to fight. Their bones lay white on every island in the fens; their corpses rotted on gallows beneath every Norman keep; their few survivors crawled into monasteries, with eyes picked out, or hands and feet cut off, or took to the wild wood as strong outlaws, like their successors and representatives, Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John, Adam Bell, and Clym of the Cleugh, and William of Cloudeslee. But they never really bent their necks to the Norman yoke; they kept alive in their hearts that proud spirit of personal independence, which they brought with them from the moors of Denmark and the dales of Norway; and they kept alive, too, though in abeyance for a while, those free institutions which were without a doubt the germs of our British liberty.  They were a changed folk since first they settled in that Danelagh;--since first in the days of King Beorhtric, “in the year 787, three ships of Northmen came from Haeretha land, and the King’s reeve rode to the place, and would have driven them up to the King’s town, for he knew not what men they were: but they slew him there and then”; and after the Saxons and Angles began to find out to their bitter bale what men they were, those fierce Vikings out of the dark northeast.  But they had long ceased to burn farms, sack convents, torture monks for gold, and slay every human being they met, in mere Berserker lust of blood. No Barnakill could now earn his nickname by entreating his comrades, as they tossed the children on their spear-points, to “Na kill the barns.” Gradually they had settled down on the "]]]
