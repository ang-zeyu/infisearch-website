Windham.--ED.   \"My dear, dear friend, I am indeed grieved for you; but I am more incensed at the infatuation of the Chevalier.  Surely, surely he must already have seen his error, and solicited your return?\"  \"Return!\" cried Bolingbroke, and his eyes flashed fire,--\"return!--Hear what I said to the Queen-Mother who came to attempt a reconciliation: 'Madam,' said I, in a tone as calm as I could command, 'if ever this hand draws the sword, or employs the pen, in behalf of that prince, may it rot!' Return! not if my head were the price of refusal!  Yet, Devereux,\"--and here Bolingbroke's voice and manner changed,--\"yet it is not at these tricks of fate that a wise man will repine.  We do right to cultivate honours; they are sources of gratification to ourselves: they are more; they are incentives to the conduct which works benefits to others; but we do wrong to afflict ourselves at their loss.  'Nec quaerere nec spernere honores oportet.'*  It is good to enjoy the blessings of fortune: it is better to submit without a pang to their loss.  You remember, when you left me, I was preparing myself for this stroke: believe me, I am now prepared.\"   * \"It becomes us neither to court nor to despise honours.\"   And in truth Bolingbroke bore the ingratitude of the Chevalier well. Soon afterwards he carried his long cherished wishes for retirement into effect; and Fate, who delights in reversing her disk, leaving in darkness what she had just illumined, and illumining what she had hitherto left in obscurity and gloom, for a long interval separated us from each other, no less by his seclusion than by the publicity to which she condemned myself.  Lord Bolingbroke's dismissal was not the only event affecting me that had occurred during my absence from France.  Among the most active partisans of the Chevalier, in the expedition of Lord Mar, had been Montreuil.  So great, indeed, had been either his services or the idea entertained of their value, that a reward of extraordinary amount was offered for his head.  Hitherto he had escaped, and was supposed to be still in Scotland.  But what affected me more nearly was the condition of Gerald's circumstances.  On the breaking out of the rebellion he had been suddenly seized, and detained in prison; and it was only upon the escape of the Chevalier that he was released: apparently, however, nothing had been proved against him; and my absence from the head-quarters of intelligence left me in ignorance both of the grounds of his imprisonment and the circumstances of his release.  I heard, however, from Bolingbroke, who seemed to possess some of that information which the ecclesiastical intriguants of the day so curiously transmitted from court to court and corner to corner, that Gerald had retired to Devereux Court in great disgust at his confinement.  However, when I considered his bold character, his close intimacy with Montreuil, and the genius for intrigue which that priest so eminently possessed, I was not much inclined to censure the government for unnecessary precaution in his imprisonment.  There was another circumstance connected with the rebellion which possessed for me an individual and deep interest.  A man of the name of Barnard had been executed in England for seditious and treasonable practices.  I took especial pains to ascertain every particular respecting him.  I learned that he was young, of inconsiderable note, but esteemed clever; and had, long previously to the death of the Queen, been secretly employed by the friends of the Chevalier.  This circumstance occasioned me much internal emotion, though there could be no doubt that the Barnard whom I had such cause to execrate had only borrowed from this minion the disguise of his name.  The Regent received me with all the graciousness and complaisance for which he was so remarkable.  To say the truth, my mission had been extremely fortunate in its results; the only cause in which the Regent was concerned the interests of which Peter the Great appeared to disregard was that of the Chevalier; but I had been fully instructed on that head anterior to my legation.  There appears very often to be a sort of moral fitness between the beginning and the end of certain alliances or acquaintances.  This sentiment is not very clearly expressed.  I am about to illustrate it by an important event in my political life.  During my absence Dubois had made rapid steps towards being a great man.  He was daily growing into power, and those courtiers who were neither too haughty nor too honest to bend the knee to so vicious yet able a minion had already singled him out as a fit person to flatter and to rise by.  For me, I neither sought nor avoided him: but he was as civil towards me as his /brusque/ temper permitted him to be towards most persons; and as our careers were not likely to cross one another, I thought I might reckon on his neutrality, if not on his friendship.  Chance turned the scale against me.  One day I received an anonymous letter, requesting me to be, at such an hour, at a certain house in the Rue ------.  It occurred to me as no improbable supposition that the appointment might relate to my individual circumstances, whether domestic or political, and I certainly had not at the moment any ideas of gallantry in my brain.  At the hour prescribed I appeared at the place of assignation.  My mind misgave me when I saw a female conduct me into a little chamber hung with tapestry descriptive of the loves of Mars and Venus.  After I had cooled my heels in this apartment about a quarter of an hour, in sailed a tall woman, of a complexion almost Moorish.  I bowed; the lady sighed.  An /eclaircissement/ ensued; and I found that I had the good fortune to be the object of a /caprice/ in the favourite mistress of the Abbe Dubois. Nothing was further from my wishes!  What a pity it is that one cannot always tell a woman one's mind!  I attempted a flourish about friendship, honour, and the respect due to the /amante/ of the most intimate /ami/ I had in the world.  \"Pooh!\" said the tawny Calypso, a little pettishly, \"pooh! one does not talk of those things here.\"  \"Madame,\" said I, very energetically, \"I implore you to refrain.  Do not excite too severe a contest between passion and duty!  I feel that I must fly you: you are already too bewitching.\"  Just as I rose to depart in rushes the /femme de chambre/, and announces, not Monsieur the Abbe, but Monseigneur the Regent.  Of course (the old resort in such cases) I was thrust in a closet; in marches his Royal Highness, and is received very cavalierly.  It is quite astonishing to me what airs those women give themselves when they have princes to manage!  However, my confinement was not long: the closet had another door; the /femme de chambre/ slips round, opens it, and I congratulate myself on my escape.  When a Frenchwoman is piqued, she passes all understanding.  The next day I am very quietly employed at breakfast, when my valet ushers in a masked personage, and behold my gentlewoman again!  Human endurance will not go too far, and this was a case which required one to be in a passion one way or the other; so I feigned anger, and talked with exceeding dignity about the predicament I had been placed in the day before.  \"Such must always be the case,\" said I, \"when one is weak enough to form an attachment to a lady who encourages so many others!\"  \"For your sake,\" said the tender dame, \"for your sake, then, I will discard them all!\"  There was something grand in this.  it might have elicited a few strokes of pathos, when--never was there anything so strangely provoking--the Abbe Dubois himself was heard in my anteroom.  I thought this chance, but it was more; the good Abbe, I afterwards found, had traced cause for suspicion, and had come to pay me a visit of amatory police.  I opened my dressing-room door, and thrust in the lady.  \"There,\" said I, \"are the back-stairs, and at the bottom of the back-stairs is a door.\"  Would not any one have thought this hint enough?  By no means; this very tall lady stooped to the littleness of listening, and, instead of departing, stationed herself by the keyhole.  I never exactly learned whether Dubois suspected the visit his mistress had paid me, or whether he merely surmised, from his spies or her escritoire, that she harboured an inclination towards me; in either case his policy was natural, and like himself.  He sat himself down, talked of the Regent, of pleasure, of women, and, at last, of this very tall lady in question.  \"/La pauvre diablesse/,\" said he, contemptuously, \"I had once compassion on her; I have repented it ever since.  You have no idea what a terrible creature she is; has such a wen in her neck, quite a /goitre/.  /Mort diable/!\" (and the Abbe spat in his handkerchief), \"I would sooner have a /liaison/ with the witch of Endor!\"  Not content with this, he went on in his usual gross and displeasing manner to enumerate or to forge those various particulars of her personal charms which he thought most likely to steel me against her attractions.  \"Thank Heaven, at least,\" thought I, \"that she has gone!\"  Scarcely had this pious gratulation flowed from my heart, before the door was burst open, and, pale, trembling, eyes on fire, hands clenched, forth stalked the lady in question.  A wonderful proof how much sooner a woman would lose her character than allow it to be called not worth the losing!  She entered, and had all the furies of Hades lent her their tongues, she could not have been more eloquent.  It would have been a very pleasant scene if one had not been a partner in it.  The old Abbe, with his keen, astute marked face, struggling between surprise, fear, the sense of the ridiculous, and the certainty of losing his mistress; the lady, foaming at the mouth, and shaking her clenched hand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7628"],["title","Devereux — Volume 05 (#6)"],["body","menacingly at her traducer; myself endeavouring to pacify, and acting, as one does at such moments, mechanically, though one flatters one's self afterwards that one acted solely from wisdom.  But the Abbe's mistress was by no means content with vindicating herself: she retaliated, and gave so minute a description of the Abbe's own qualities and graces, coupled with so any pleasing illustrations, that in a very little time his coolness forsook him, and he grew in as great a rage as herself.  At last she flew out of the room.  The Abbe, trembling with passion, shook me most cordially by the hand, grinned from ear to ear, said it was a capital joke, wished me good-by as if he loved me better than his eyes, and left the house my most irreconcilable and bitter foe!  How could it be otherwise?  The rivalship the Abbe might have forgiven; such things happened every day to him: but the having been made so egregiously ridiculous the Abbe could not forgive; and the Abbe's was a critical age for jesting on these matters, sixty or so.  And then such unpalatable sarcasms on his appearance!  \"'Tis all over in that quarter,\" said I to myself, \"but we may find another,\" and I drove out that very day to pay my respects to the Regent.  What a pity it is that one's pride should so often be the bane of one's wisdom.  Ah! that one could be as good a man of the world in practice as one is in theory! my master-stroke of policy at that moment would evidently have been this: I should have gone to the Regent and made out a story similar to the real one, but with this difference, all the ridicule of the situation should have fallen upon me, and the little Dubois should have been elevated on a pinnacle of respectable appearances!  This, as the Regent told the Abbe everything, would have saved me.  I saw the plan; but was too proud to adopt it; I followed another course in my game: I threw away the knave, and played with the king, /i.e./, with the Regent.  After a little preliminary conversation, I turned the conversation on the Abbe.  \"Ah! the /scelerat/!\" said Philip, smiling, \"'tis a sad dog, but very clever and /loves me/, he would be incomparable, if he were but decently honest.\"  \"At least,\" said I, \"he is no hypocrite, and that is some praise.\"  \"Hem!\" ejaculated the Duke, very slowly, and then, after a pause, he said, \"Count, I have a real kindness for you, and I will therefore give you a piece of advice: think as well of Dubois as you can, and address him as if he were all you endeavoured to fancy him.\"  After this hint, which in the mouth of any prince but Philip of Orleans would have been not a little remarkable for its want of dignity, my prospects did not seem much brighter; however, I was not discouraged.  \"The Abbe,\" said I, respectfully, \"is a choleric man: one /may/ displease him; but dare I hope that so long as I preserve inviolate my zeal and my attachment to the interests and the person of your Highness, no--\"  The Regent interrupted me.  \"You mean nobody shall successfully misrepresent you to me?  No, Count\" (and here the Regent spoke with the earnestness and dignity, which, when he did assume, few wore with a nobler grace)--\"no, Count, I make a distinction between those who minister to the state and those who minister to me.  I consider your services too valuable to the former to put them at the mercy of the latter.  And now that the conversation has turned upon business I wish to speak to you about this scheme of Gortz.\"  After a prolonged conference with the Regent upon matters of business, in which his deep penetration into human nature not a little surprised me, I went away thoroughly satisfied with my visit.  I should not have been so had I added to my other accomplishments the gift of prophecy. Above five days after this interview, I thought it would be but prudent to pay the Abbe Dubois one of those visits of homage which it was already become policy to pay him.  \"If I go,\" thought I, \"it will seem as if nothing had happened; if I stay away, it will seem as if I attached importance to a scene I should appear to have forgotten.\"  It so happened that the Abbe had a very unusual visitor that morning, in the person of the austere but admirable Duc de St. Simon.  There was a singular and almost invariable distinction in the Regent's mind between one kind of regard and another.  His regard for one order of persons always arose either out of his vices or his indolence; his regard for another, out of his good qualities and his strong sense.  The Duc de St. Simon held the same place in the latter species of affection that Dubois did in the former.  The Duc was just coming out of the Abbe's closet as I entered the anteroom.  He paused to speak to me, while Dubois, who had followed the Duc out, stopped for one moment, and surveyed me with a look like a thundercloud.  I did not appear to notice it, but St. Simon did.  \"That look,\" said he, as Dubois, beckoning to a gentleman to accompany him to his closet, once more disappeared, \"that look bodes you no good, Count.\"  Pride is an elevation which is a spring-board at one time and a stumbling-block at another.  It was with me more often the stumbling-block than the spring-board.  \"Monseigneur le Duc,\" said I, haughtily enough, and rather in too loud a tone considering the chamber was pretty full, \"in no court to which Morton Devereux proffers his services shall his fortune depend upon the looks of a low-born insolent or a profligate priest.\"  St. Simon smiled sardonically.  \"Monsieur le Comte,\" said he, rather civilly, \"I honour your sentiments, and I wish you success in the world--and a lower voice.\"  I was going to say something by way of retort, for I was in a very bad humour, but I checked myself: \"I need not,\" thought I, \"make two enemies, if I can help it.\"  \"I shall never,\" I replied gravely, \"I shall never despair, so long as the Duc de St. Simon lives, of winning by the same arts the favour of princes and the esteem of good men.\"  The Duc was flattered, and replied suitably, but he very soon afterwards went away.  I was resolved that I would not go till I had fairly seen what sort of reception the Abbe would give me.  I did not wait long.  he came out of his closet, and standing in his usual rude manner with his back to the fireplace, received the addresses and compliments of his visitors.  I was not in a hurry to present myself, but I did so at last with a familiar yet rather respectful air.  Dubois looked at me from head to foot, and abruptly turning his back upon me, said with an oath, to a courtier who stood next to him,--\"The plagues of Pharaoh are come again; only instead of Egyptian frogs in our chambers, we have the still more troublesome guests,--English adventurers!\"  Somehow or other my compliments rarely tell; I am lavish enough of them, but they generally have the air of sarcasms; thank Heaven, however, no one can accuse me of ever wanting a rude answer to a rude speech.  \"Ha! ha! ha!\" said I now, in answer to Dubois, with a courteous laugh, \"you have an excellent wit, Abbe. /A propos/ of adventures, I met a Monsieur St. Laurent, Principal of the Institution of St. Michael, the other day. 'Count,' said he, hearing I was going to Paris, 'you can do me an especial favour!'  'What is it?' said I.  'Why, a cast-off valet of mine is living at Paris; he would have gone long since to the galleys, if he had not taken sanctuary in the Church: if ever you meet him, give him a good horsewhipping on my account; his name is William Dubois.'  'Depend upon it,' answered I to Monsieur St. Laurent, 'that if he is servant to any one not belonging to the royal family, I will fulfil your errand, and horsewhip him soundly; if /in/ the service of the royal family, why, respect for his masters must oblige me to content myself with putting all persons on their guard against a little rascal, who retains, in all situations, the manners of the apothecary's son and the roguery of the director's valet.'\"  All the time I was relating this charming little anecdote, it would have been amusing to the last degree to note the horrified countenances of the surrounding gentlemen.  Dubois was too confounded, too aghast, to interrupt me, and I left the room before a single syllable was uttered. Had Dubois at that time been, what he was afterwards, cardinal and prime minister, I should in all probability have had permanent lodgings in the Bastile in return for my story.  Even as it was, the Abbe was not so grateful as he ought to have been for my taking so much pains to amuse him!  In spite of my anger on leaving the favourite, I did not forget my prudence, and accordingly I hastened to the Prince.  When the Regent admitted me, I flung myself on my knee, and told him, /verbatim/, all that had happened.  The Regent, who seems to have had very little real liking for Dubois, could not help laughing when I ludicrously described to him the universal consternation my anecdote had excited.*   * On the death of Dubois, the Regent wrote to the Count de Noce, whom be had banished for an indiscreet expression against the favourite, uttered at one of his private suppers: \"With the beast dies the venom: I expect you to-night to supper at the Palais Royal.\"   \"Courage, my dear Count,\" said he, kindly, \"you have nothing to fear; return home and count upon an embassy!\"  I relied on the royal word, returned to my lodgings, and spent the evening with Chaulieu and Fontenelle.  The next day the Duc de St. Simon paid me a visit.  After a little preliminary conversation, he unburdened the secret with which he was charged.  I was desired to leave Paris in forty-eight hours.  \"Believe me,\" said St. Simon, \"that this message was not intrusted to me by the Regent without great reluctance.  He sends you many condescending and kind messages; says he shall always both esteem and like you, and hopes to see you again, some time or other, at the Palais Royal. Moreover, he desires the message to be private, and has"]]]
