Amidst the shouts of hundreds, eager to hold his stirrup, the Earl dismounted, passed the swarming hall, and entered the room, in which he found Hilda and Githa, and Godwin, who had preceded his entry but a few minutes.  In the beautiful reverence of son to father, which made one of the loveliest features of the Saxon character [126] (as the frequent want of it makes the most hateful of the Norman vices), the all-powerful Harold bowed his knee to the old Earl, who placed his hand on his head in benediction, and then kissed him on the cheek and brow.  \"Thy kiss, too, dear mother,\" said the younger Earl; and Githa's embrace, if more cordial than her lord's, was not, perhaps, more fond.  \"Greet Hilda, my son,\" said Godwin, \"she hath brought me a gift, and she hath tarried to place it under thy special care.  Thou alone must heed the treasure, and open the casket.  But when and where, my kinswoman?\"  \"On the sixth day after thy coming to the King's hall,\" answered Hilda, not returning the smile with which Godwin spoke,--\"on the sixth day, Harold, open the chest, and take out the robe which hath been spun in the house of Hilda for Godwin the Earl.  And now, Godwin, I have clasped thine hand, and I have looked on thy brow, and my mission is done, and I must wend homeward.\"  \"That shalt thou not, Hilda,\" said the hospitable Earl; \"the meanest wayfarer hath a right to bed and board in this house for a night and a day, and thou wilt not disgrace us by leaving our threshold, the bread unbroken, and the couch unpressed.  Old friend, we were young together, and thy face is welcome to me as the memory of former days.\"  Hilda shook her head, and one of those rare, and for that reason most touching, expressions of tenderness of which the calm and rigid character of her features, when in repose, seemed scarcely susceptible, softened her eye, and relaxed the firm lines of her lips.  \"Son of Wolnoth,\" said she, gently, \"not under thy roof-tree should lodge the raven of bode.  Bread have I not broken since yestere'en, and sleep will be far from my eyes to-night.  Fear not, for my people without are stout and armed, and for the rest there lives not the man whose arm can have power over Hilda.\"  She took Harold's hand as she spoke, and leading him forth, whispered in his ear, \"I would have a word with thee ere we part.\"  Then, reaching the threshold, she waved her hand thrice over the floor, and muttered in the Danish tongue a rude verse, which, translated, ran somewhat thus:      \"All free from the knot        Glide the thread of the skein,      And rest to the labour,        And peace to the pain!\"  \"It is a death-dirge,\" said Githa, with whitening lips, but she spoke inly, and neither husband nor son heard her words.  Hilda and Harold passed in silence through the hall, and the Vala's attendants, with spears and torches, rose from the settles, and went before to the outer court, where snorted impatiently her black palfrey.  Halting in the midst of the court, she said to Harold, in a low voice:  \"At sunset we part--at sunset we shall meet again.  And behold, the star rises on the sunset; and the star, broader and brighter, shall rise on the sunset then!  When thy hand draws the robe from the chest, think on Hilda, and know that at that hour she stands by the grave of the Saxon warrior, and that from the grave dawns the future.  Farewell to thee!\"  Harold longed to speak to her of Edith, but a strange awe at his heart chained his lips; so he stood silent by the great wooden gates of the rude house.  The torches flamed round him, and Hilda's face seemed lurid in the glare.  There he stood musing long after torch and ceorl had passed away, nor did he wake from his reverie till Gurth, springing from his panting horse, passed his arm round the Earl's shoulder, and cried:  \"How did I miss thee, my brother? and why didst thou forsake thy train?\"  \"I will tell thee anon.  Gurth, has my father ailed?  There is that in his face which I like not.\"  \"He hath not complained of misease,\" said Gurth, startled; \"but now thou speakest of it, his mood hath altered of late, and he hath wandered much alone, or only with the old hound and the old falcon.\"  Then Harold turned back, and, his heart was full; and, when he reached the house, his father was sitting in the hall on his chair of state; and Githa sate on his right hand, and a little below her sate Tostig and Leofwine, who had come in from the bear-hunt by the river-gate, and were talking loud and merrily; and thegns and cnehts sate all around, and there was wassail as Harold entered.  But the Earl looked only to his father, and he saw that his eyes were absent from the glee, and that he was bending his head over the old falcon, which sate on his wrist.     CHAPTER III.   No subject of England, since the race of Cerdic sate on the throne, ever entered the courtyard of Windshore with such train and such state as Earl Godwin.--Proud of that first occasion, since his return, to do homage to him with whose cause that of England against the stranger was bound, all truly English at heart amongst the thegns of the land swelled his retinue.  Whether Saxon or Dane, those who alike loved the laws and the soil, came from north and from south to the peaceful banner of the old Earl.  But most of these were of the past generation, for the rising race were still dazzled by the pomp of the Norman; and the fashion of English manners, and the pride in English deeds, had gone out of date with long locks and bearded chins.  Nor there were the bishops and abbots and the lords of the Church,--for dear to them already the fame of the Norman piety, and they shared the distaste of their holy King to the strong sense and homely religion of Godwin, who founded no convents, and rode to war with no relics round his neck.  But they with Godwin were the stout and the frank and the free, in whom rested the pith and marrow of English manhood; and they who were against him were the blind and willing and fated fathers of slaves unborn.  Not then the stately castle we now behold, which is of the masonry of a prouder race, nor on the same site, but two miles distant on the winding of the river shore (whence it took its name), a rude building partly of timber and partly of Roman brick, adjoining a large monastery and surrounded by a small hamlet, constituted the palace of the saint-king.  So rode the Earl and his four fair sons, all abreast, into the courtyard of Windshore [127].  Now when King Edward heard the tramp of the steeds and the hum of the multitudes, as he sate in his closet with his abbots and priests, all in still contemplation of the thumb of St. Jude, the King asked:  \"What army, in the day of peace, and the time of Easter, enters the gates of our palace?\"  Then an abbot rose and looked out of the narrow window, and said with a groan:  \"Army thou mayst well call it, O King!--and foes to us and to thee head the legions----\"  \"Inprinis,\" quoth our abbot the scholar; \"thou speakest, I trow, of the wicked Earl and his sons.\"  The King's face changed.  \"Come they,\" said he, \"with so large a train?  This smells more of vaunt than of loyalty; naught--very naught.\"  \"Alack!\" said one of the conclave, \"I fear me that the men of Belial will work us harm; the heathen are mighty, and----\"  \"Fear not,\" said Edward, with benign loftiness, observing that his guests grew pale, and himself, though often weak to childishness, and morally wavering and irresolute,--still so far king and gentleman, that he knew no craven fear of the body.  \"Fear not for me, my fathers; humble as I am, I am strong in the faith of heaven and its angels.\"  The Churchmen looked at each other, sly yet abashed; it was not precisely for the King that they feared.  Then spoke Alred, the good prelate and constant peacemaker--fair column and lone one of the fast-crumbling Saxon Church.  \"It is ill in you, brethren to arraign the truth and good meaning of those who honour your King; and in these days that lord should ever be the most welcome who brings to the halls of his king the largest number of hearts, stout and leal.\"  \"By your leave, brother Alred,\" said Stigand, who, though from motives of policy he had aided those who besought the King not to peril his crown by resisting the return of Godwin, benefited too largely by the abuses of the Church to be sincerely espoused to the cause of the strong-minded Earl; \"By your leave, brother Alred, to every leal heart is a ravenous mouth; and the treasures of the King are well-nigh drained in feeding these hungry and welcomeless visitors.  Durst I counsel my lord I would pray him, as a matter of policy, to baffle this astute and proud Earl.  He would fain have the King feast in public, that he might daunt him and the Church with the array of his friends.\"  \"I conceive thee, my father,\" said Edward, with more quickness than habitual, and with the cunning, sharp though guileless, that belongs to minds undeveloped, \"I conceive thee; it is good and most politic. This our orgulous Earl shall not have his triumph, and, so fresh from his exile, brave his King with the mundane parade of his power.  Our health is our excuse for our absence from the banquet, and, sooth to say, we marvel much why Easter should be held a fitting time for feasting and mirth.  Wherefore, Hugoline, my chamberlain, advise the Earl that to-day we keep fast till the sunset, when temperately, with eggs, bread, and fish, we will sustain Adam's nature.  Pray him and his sons to attend us--they alone be our guests.\"  And with a sound that seemed a laugh, or the ghost of a laugh, low and chuckling--for Edward had at moments an innocent humour which his monkish biographer disdained not to note [128],--he flung himself back in his chair.  The priests took the cue, and shook their sides heartily, as Hugoline left the room, not ill pleased, by the way, to escape an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7676"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 05 (#3)"],["body","to the eggs, bread, and fish.  Alred sighed; and said, \"For the Earl and his sons, this is honour; but the other earls, and the thegns, will miss at the banquet him whom they design but to honour, and----\"  \"I have said,\" interrupted Edward, drily, and with a look of fatigue.  \"And,\" observed another Churchman, with malice, \"at least the young Earls will be humbled, for they will not sit with the King and their father, as they would in the Hall, and must serve my lord with napkin and wine.\"  \"Inprinis,\" quoth our scholar the abbot, \"that will be rare!  I would I were by to see.  But this Godwin is a man of treachery and wile, and my lord should beware of the fate of murdered Alfred, his brother!\"  The King started, and pressed his hands to his eyes.  \"How darest thou, Abbot Fatchere,\" cried Alred, indignantly; \"How darest thou revive grief without remedy, and slander without proof?\"  \"Without proof?\" echoed Edward, in a hollow voice.  \"He who could murder, could well stoop to forswear!  Without proof before man; but did he try the ordeals of God?--did his feet pass the ploughshare?-- did his hand grasp the seething iron?  Verily, verily, thou didst wrong to name to me Alfred my brother!  I shall see his sightless and gore-dropping sockets in the face of Godwin, this day, at my board.\"  The King rose in great disorder; and, after pacing the room some moments, disregardful of the silent and scared looks of his Churchmen, waved his hand, in sign to them to depart.  All took the hint at once save Alred; but he, lingering the last, approached the King with dignity in his step and compassion in his eyes.  \"Banish from thy breast, O King and son, thoughts unmeet, and of doubtful charity!  All that man could know of Godwin's innocence or guilt--the suspicion of the vulgar--the acquittal of his peers--was known to thee before thou didst seek his aid for thy throne, and didst take his child for thy wife.  Too late is it now to suspect; leave thy doubts to the solemn day, which draws nigh to the old man, thy wife's father!\"  \"Ha!\" said the king, seeming not to heed, or wilfully to misunderstand the prelate, \"Ha! leave him to God;--I will!\"  He turned away impatiently; and the prelate reluctantly departed.     CHAPTER IV.   Tostig chafed mightily at the King's message; and, on Harold's attempt to pacify him, grew so violent that nothing short of the cold stern command of his father, who carried with him that weight of authority never known but to those in whom wrath is still and passion noiseless, imposed sullen peace on his son's rugged nature.  But the taunts heaped by Tostig upon Harold disquieted the old Earl, and his brow was yet sad with prophetic care when he entered the royal apartments.  He had been introduced into the King's presence but a moment before Hugoline led the way to the chamber of repast, and the greeting between King and Earl had been brief and formal.  Under the canopy of state were placed but two chairs, for the King and the Queen's father; and the four sons, Harold, Tostig, Leofwine, and Gurth, stood behind.  Such was the primitive custom of ancient Teutonic kings; and the feudal Norman monarchs only enforced, though with more pomp and more rigour, the ceremonial of the forest patriarchs--youth to wait on age, and the ministers of the realm on those whom their policy had made chiefs in council and war.  The Earl's mind, already embittered by the scene with his sons, was chafed yet more by the King's unloving coldness; for it is natural to man, however worldly, to feel affection for those he has served, and Godwin had won Edward his crown; nor, despite his warlike though bloodless return, could even monk or Norman, in counting up the old Earl's crimes, say that he had ever failed in personal respect to the King he had made; nor over-great for subject, as the Earl's power must be confessed, will historian now be found to say that it had not been well for Saxon England if Godwin had found more favour with his King, and monk and Norman less. [129]  So the old Earl's stout heart was stung, and he looked from those deep, impenetrable eyes, mournfully upon Edward's chilling brow.  And Harold, with whom all household ties were strong, but to whom his great father was especially dear, watched his face and saw that it was very flushed.  But the practised courtier sought to rally his spirits, and to smile and jest.  From smile and jest, the King turned and asked for wine.  Harold, starting, advanced with the goblet; as he did so, he stumbled with one foot, but lightly recovered himself with the other; and Tostig laughed scornfully at Harold's awkwardness.  The old Earl observed both stumble and laugh, and willing to suggest a lesson to both his sons, said--laughing pleasantly--\"Lo, Harold, how the left foot saves the right!--so one brother, thou seest, helps the other!\" [130]  King Edward looked up suddenly.  \"And so, Godwin, also, had my brother Alfred helped me, hadst thou permitted.\"  The old Earl, galled to the quick, gazed a moment on the King, and his cheek was purple, and his eyes seemed bloodshot.  \"O Edward!\" he exclaimed, \"thou speakest to me hardly and unkindly of thy brother Alfred, and often hast thou thus more than hinted that I caused his death.\"  The King made no answer.  \"May this crumb of bread choke me,\" said the Earl, in great emotion, \"if I am guilty of thy brother's blood!\" [131]  But scarcely had the bread touched his lips, when his eyes fixed, the long warning symptoms were fulfilled.  And he fell to the ground, under the table, sudden and heavy, smitten by the stroke of apoplexy.  Harold and Gurth sprang forward; they drew their father from the ground.  His face, still deep-red with streaks of purple, rested on Harold's breast; and the son, kneeling, called in anguish on his father: the ear was deaf.  Then said the King, rising:  \"It is the hand of God: remove him!\" and he swept from the room, exulting.     CHAPTER V.   For five days and five nights did Godwin lie speechless [132].  And Harold watched over him night and day.  And the leaches [133] would not bleed him, because the season was against it, in the increase of the moon and the tides; but they bathed his temples with wheat flour boiled in milk, according to a prescription which an angel in a dream [134] had advised to another patient; and they placed a plate of lead on his breast, marked with five crosses, saying a paternoster over each cross; together with other medical specifics in great esteem [135].  But, nevertheless, five days and five nights did Godwin lie speechless; and the leaches then feared that human skill was in vain.  The effect produced on the court, not more by the Earl's death-stroke than the circumstances preceding it, was such as defies description. With Godwin's old comrades in arms it was simple and honest grief; but with all those under the influence of the priests, the event was regarded as a direct punishment from Heaven.  The previous words of the King, repeated by Edward to his monks, circulated from lip to lip, with sundry exaggerations as it travelled: and the superstition of the day had the more excuse, inasmuch as the speech of Godwin touched near upon the defiance of one of the most popular ordeals of the accused,-- viz. that called the \"corsned,\" in which a piece of bread was given to the supposed criminal; if he swallowed it with ease he was innocent; if it stuck in his throat, or choked him, nay, if he shook and turned pale, he was guilty.  Godwin's words had appeared to invite the ordeal, God had heard and stricken down the presumptuous perjurer!  Unconscious, happily, of these attempts to blacken the name of his dying father, Harold, towards the grey dawn succeeding the fifth night, thought that he heard Godwin stir in his bed.  So he put aside the curtain, and bent over him.  The old Earl's eyes were wide open, and the red colour had gone from his cheeks, so that he was pale as death.  \"How fares it, dear father?\" asked Harold.  Godwin smiled fondly, and tried to speak, but his voice died in a convulsive rattle.  Lifting himself up, however, with an effort, he pressed tenderly the hand that clasped his own, leant his head on Harold's breast, and so gave up the ghost.  When Harold was at last aware that the struggle was over, he laid the grey head gently on the pillow; he closed the eyes, and kissed the lips, and knelt down and prayed.  Then, seating himself at a little distance, he covered his face with his mantle.  At this time his brother Gurth, who had chiefly shared watch with Harold,--for Tostig, foreseeing his father's death, was busy soliciting thegn and earl to support his own claims to the earldom about to be vacant; and Leofwine had gone to London on the previous day to summon Githa who was hourly expected--Gurth, I say, entered the room on tiptoe, and seeing his brother's attitude, guessed that all was over.  He passed on to the table, took up the lamp, and looked long on his father's face.  That strange smile of the dead, common alike to innocent and guilty, had already settled on the serene lips; and that no less strange transformation from age to youth, when the wrinkles vanish, and the features come out clear and sharp from the hollows of care and years, had already begun.  And the old man seemed sleeping in his prime.  So Gurth kissed the dead, as Harold had done before him, and came up and sate himself by his brother's feet, and rested his head on Harold's knee; nor would he speak till, appalled by the long silence of the Earl, he drew away the mantle from his brother's face with a gentle hand, and the large tears were rolling down Harold's cheeks.  \"Be soothed, my brother,\" said Gurth; \"our father has lived for glory, his age was prosperous, and his years more than those which the Psalmist allots to man.  Come and look on his face, Harold, its calm will comfort thee.\"  Harold obeyed the hand that led him like a child; in passing towards the bed, his eye fell "]]]
