Both I would spare, if I may.\"  \"Yet thou hast not shown such value for life, in the solitudes I passed,\" said the knight bluntly.  Harold turned pale, but said firmly, \"Sire de Graville, a stern thing is duty, and resistless is its voice.  These Welchmen, unless curbed to their mountains, eat into the strength of England, as the tide gnaws into a shore.  Merciless were they in their ravages on our borders, and ghastly and torturing their fell revenge.  But it is one thing to grapple with a foe fierce and strong, and another to smite when his power is gone, fang and talon.  And when I see before me the faded king of a great race, and the last band of doomed heroes, too few and too feeble to make head against my arms,--when the land is already my own, and the sword is that of the deathsman, not of the warrior,--verily, Sir Norman, duty releases its iron tool, and man becomes man again.\"  \"I go,\" said the Norman, inclining his head low as to his own great Duke, and turning to the door; yet there he paused, and looking at the ring which he had placed on his finger, he said, \"But one word more, if not indiscreet--your answer may help argument, if argument be needed.  What tale lies hid in this token?\"  Harold coloured and paused a moment, then answered:  \"Simply this.  Gryffyth's wife, the lady Aldyth, a Saxon by birth, fell into my hands.  We were storming Rhadlan, at the farther end of the isle; she was there.  We war not against women; I feared the license of my own soldiers, and I sent the lady to Gryffyth.  Aldyth gave me this ring on parting; and I bade her tell Gryffyth that whenever, at the hour of his last peril and sorest need, I sent that ring back to him, he might hold it the pledge of his life.\"  \"Is this lady, think you, in the stronghold with her lord?\"  \"I am not sure, but I fear yes,\" answered Harold.  \"Yet one word: And if Gryffyth refuse, despite all warning?\"  Harold's eyes drooped.  \"If so, he dies; but not by the Saxon sword.  God and our lady speed you!\"     CHAPTER V.   On the height called Pen-y-Dinas (or \"Head of the City\") forming one of the summits of Penmaen-mawr, and in the heart of that supposed fortress which no eye in the Saxon camp had surveyed [163], reclined Gryffyth, the hunted King.  Nor is it marvellous that at that day there should be disputes as to the nature and strength of the supposed bulwark, since, in times the most recent, and among antiquaries the most learned, the greatest discrepancies exist, not only as to theoretical opinion, but plain matter of observation, and simple measurement.  The place, however, I need scarcely say, was not as we see it now, with its foundations of gigantic ruin, affording ample space for conjecture; yet, even then, a wreck as of Titans, its date and purpose were lost in remote antiquity.  The central area (in which the Welch King now reclined) formed an oval barrow of loose stones: whether so left from the origin, or the relics of some vanished building, was unknown even to bard and diviner. Round this space were four strong circumvallations of loose stones, with a space about eighty yards between each; the walls themselves generally about eight feet wide, but of various height, as the stones had fallen by time and blast. Along these walls rose numerous and almost countless circular buildings, which might pass for towers, though only a few had been recently and rudely roofed in.  To the whole of this quadruple enclosure there was but one narrow entrance, now left open as if in scorn of assault; and a winding narrow pass down the mountain, with innumerable curves, alone led to the single threshold.  Far down the hill, walls again were visible; and the whole surface of the steep soil, more than half way in the descent, was heaped with vast loose stones, as if the bones of a dead city.  But beyond the innermost enclosure of the fort (if fort, or sacred enclosure, be the correcter name), rose, thick and frequent, other mementos of the Briton; many cromlechs, already shattered and shapeless; the ruins of stone houses; and high over all, those upraised, mighty amber piles, as at Stonehenge, once reared, if our dim learning be true, in honour to Bel, or Bal-Huan [164], the idol of the sun.  All, in short, showed that the name of the place, \"the Head of the City,\" told its tale; all announced that, there, once the Celt had his home, and the gods of the Druid their worship.  And musing amidst these skeletons of the past, lay the doomed son of Pen-Dragon.  Beside him a kind of throne had been raised with stones, and over it was spread a tattered and faded velvet pall.  On this throne sat Aldyth the Queen; and about the royal pair was still that mockery of a court which the jealous pride of the Celt king retained amidst all the horrors of carnage and famine.  Most of the officers indeed (originally in number twenty-four), whose duties attached them to the king and queen of the Cymry, were already feeding the crow or the worm.  But still, with gaunt hawk on his wrist, the penhebogydd (grand falconer) stood at a distance; still, with beard sweeping his breast, and rod in hand, leant against a projecting shaft of the wall, the noiseless gosdegwr, whose duty it was to command silence in the King's hall; and still the penbard bent over his bruised harp, which once had thrilled, through the fair vaults of Caerleon and Rhaldan, in high praise of God, and the King, and the Hero Dead.  In the pomp of gold dish and vessel [165] the board was spread on the stones for the King and Queen; and on the dish was the last fragment of black bread, and in the vessel full and clear, the water from the spring that bubbled up everlastingly through the bones of the dead city.  Beyond this innermost space, round a basin of rock, through which the stream overflowed as from an artificial conduit, lay the wounded and exhausted, crawling, turn by turn, to the lips of the basin, and happy that the thirst of fever saved them from the gnawing desire of food. A wan and spectral figure glided listlessly to and fro amidst those mangled, and parched, and dying groups.  This personage, in happier times, filled the office of physician to the court, and was placed twelfth in rank amidst the chiefs of the household.  And for cure of the \"three deadly wounds,\" the cloven skull, or the gaping viscera, or the broken limb (all three classed alike), large should have been his fee [166].  But feeless went he now from man to man, with his red ointment and his muttered charm; and those over whom he shook his lean face and matted locks, smiled ghastly at that sign that release and death were near.  Within the enclosures, either lay supine, or stalked restless, the withered remains of the wild army.  A sheep, and a horse, and a clog, were yet left them all to share for the day's meal. And the fire of flickering and crackling brushwood burned bright from a hollow amidst the loose stones; but the animals were yet unslain, and the dog crept by the fire, winking at it with dim eyes.  But over the lower part of the wall nearest to the barrow, leant three men.  The wall there was so broken, that they could gaze over it on that grotesque yet dismal court; and the eyes of the three men, with a fierce and wolfish glare, were bent on Gryffyth.  Three princes were they of the great old line; far as Gryffyth they traced the fabulous honours of their race, to Hu-Gadarn and Prydain, and each thought it shame that Gryffyth should be lord over him!  Each had had throne and court of his own; each his \"white palace\" of peeled willow wands--poor substitutes, O kings, for the palaces and towers that the arts of Rome had bequeathed your fathers!  And each had been subjugated by the son of Llewellyn, when, in his day of might, he re- united under his sole sway all the multiform principalities of Wales, and regained, for a moment's splendour, the throne of Roderic the Great.  \"Is it,\" said Owain, in a hollow whisper, \"for yon man, whom heaven hath deserted, who could not keep his very torque from the gripe of the Saxon, that we are to die on these hills, gnawing the flesh from our bones?  Think ye not the hour is come?\"  \"The hour will come, when the sheep, and the horse, and the dog are devoured,\" replied Modred, \"and when the whole force, as one man, will cry to Gryffyth, 'Thou a king!--give us bread!'\"  \"It is well,\" said the third, an old man, leaning on a wand of solid silver, while the mountain wind, sweeping between the walls, played with the rags of his robe,--\"it is well that the night's sally, less of war than of hunger, was foiled even of forage and food.  Had the saints been with Gryffyth, who had dared to keep faith with Tostig the Saxon.\"  Owain laughed, a laugh hollow and false.  \"Art thou Cymrian, and talkest of faith with a Saxon?  Faith with the spoiler, the ravisher and butcher?  But a Cymrian keeps faith with revenge; and Gryffyth's trunk should be still crownless and headless, though Tostig had never proffered the barter of safety and food. Hist! Gryffyth wakes from the black dream, and his eyes glow from under his hair.\"  And indeed at this moment the King raised himself on his elbow, and looked round with a haggard and fierce despair in his glittering eyes.  \"Play to us, Harper; sing some song of the deeds of old!\"  The bard mournfully strove to sweep the harp, but the chords were broken, and the note came discordant and shrill as the sigh of a wailing fiend.  \"O King!\" said the bard, \"the music hath left the harp.\"  \"Ha!\" murmured Gryffyth, \"and Hope the earth!  Bard, answer the son of Llewellyn.  Oft in my halls hast thou sung the praise of the men that have been.  In the halls of the race to come, will bards yet unborn sweep their harps to the deeds of thy King?  Shall they tell of the day of Torques, by Llyn-Afangc, when the princes of Powys fled from his sword as the clouds from the blast of the wind?  Shall they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7678"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 07 (#4)"],["body","g, as the Hirlas goes round, of his steeds of the sea, when no flag came in sight of his prows between the dark isle of the Druid [167] and the green pastures of Huerdan? [168]  Or the towns that he fired, on the lands of the Saxon, when Rolf and the Nortbmen ran fast from his javelin and spear?  Or say, Child of Truth, if all that is told of Gryffyth thy King shall be his woe and his shame?\"  The bard swept his hand over his eyes, and answered:  \"Bards unborn shall sing of Gryffyth the son of Llewellyn.  But the song shall not dwell on the pomp of his power, when twenty sub-kings knelt at his throne, and his beacon was lighted in the holds of the Norman and Saxon.  Bards shall sing of the hero, who fought every inch of crag and morass in the front of his men,--and on the heights of Penmaen-mawr, Fame recovers thy crown!\"  \"Then I have lived as my fathers in life, and shall live with their glory in death!\" said Gryffyth; \"and so the shadow hath passed from my soul.\"  Then turning round, still propped upon his elbow, he fixed his proud eye upon Aldyth, and said gravely, \"Wife, pale is thy face, and gloomy thy brow; mournest thou the throne or the man?\"  Aldyth cast on her wild lord a look of more terror than compassion, a look without the grief that is gentle, or the love that reveres; and answered:  \"What matter to thee my thoughts or my sufferings?  The sword or the famine is the doom thou hast chosen.  Listening to vain dreams from thy bard, or thine own pride as idle, thou disdainest life for us both: be it so; let us die!\"  A strange blending of fondness and wrath troubled the pride on Gryffyth's features, uncouth and half savage as they were, but still noble and kingly.  \"And what terror has death, if thou lovest me?\" said he.  Aldyth shivered and turned aside.  The unhappy King gazed hard on that face, which, despite sore trial and recent exposure to rough wind and weather, still retained the proverbial beauty of the Saxon women--but beauty without the glow of the heart, as a landscape from which sunlight has vanished; and as he gazed, at the colour went and came fitfully over his swarthy cheeks whose hue contrasted the blue of his eye and the red tawny gold of his shaggy hair.  \"Thou wouldst have me,\" he said at length, \"send to Harold thy countryman; thou wouldst have me, me--rightful lord of all Britain-- beg for mercy, and sue for life.  Ah, traitress, and child of robber- sires, fair as Rowena art thou, but no Vortimer am I!  Thou turnest in loathing from the lord whose marriage-gift was a crown; and the sleek form of thy Saxon Harold rises up through the clouds of the carnage.\"  All the fierce and dangerous jealousy of man's most human passion-- when man loves and hates in a breath--trembled in the Cymrian's voice, and fired his troubled eye; for Aldyth's pale cheek blushed like the rose, but she folded her arms haughtily on her breast, and made no reply.  \"No,\" said Gryffyth, grinding teeth, white [169] and strong as those of a young hound.  \"No, Harold in vain sent me the casket; the jewel was gone.  In vain thy form returned to my side; thy heart was away with thy captor: and not to save my life (were I so base as to seek it), but to see once more the face of him to whom this cold hand, in whose veins no pulse answers my own, had been given, if thy House had consulted its daughter, wouldst thou have me crouch like a lashed dog at the feet of my foe!  Oh Shame! shame! shame!  Oh worst perfidy of all!  Oh sharp--sharper than Saxon sword or serpent's tooth, is--is--\"  Tears gushed to those fierce eyes, and the proud King dared not trust to his voice.  Aldyth rose coldly.  \"Slay me if thou wilt--not insult me.  I have said, 'Let us die!'\"  With these words, and vouchsafing no look on her lord, she moved away towards the largest tower or cell, in which the single and rude chamber it contained had been set apart for her.  Gryffyth's eye followed her, softening gradually as her form receded, till lost to his sight.  And then that peculiar household love, which in uncultivated breasts often survives trust and esteem, rushed back on his rough heart, and weakened it, as woman only can weaken the strong to whom Death is a thought of scorn.  He signed to his bard, who, during the conference between wife and lord, had retired to a distance, and said, with a writhing attempt to smile:  \"Was there truth, thinkest thou, in the legend, that Guenever was false to King Arthur?\"  \"No,\" answered the bard, divining his lord's thought, for Guenever survived not the King, and they were buried side by side in the Vale of Avallon.\"  \"Thou art wise in the lore of the heart, and love hath been thy study from youth to grey hairs.  Is it love, is it hate, that prefers death for the loved one, to the thought of her life as another's?\"  A look of the tenderest compassion passed over the bard's wan face, but vanished in reverence, as he bowed his head and answered:  \"O King, who shall say what note the wind calls from the harp, what impulse love wakes in the soul--now soft and now stern?  But,\" he added, raising his form, and, with a dread calm on his brow, \"but the love of a king brooks no thought of dishonour; and she who hath laid her head on his breast should sleep in his grave.\"  \"Thou wilt outlive me,\" said Gryffyth, abruptly.  \"This carn be my tomb!\"  \"And if so,\" said the bard, \"thou shalt sleep not alone.  In this carn what thou lovest best shall be buried by thy side; the bard shall raise his song over thy grave, and the bosses of shields shall be placed at intervals, as rises and falls the sound of song.  Over the grave of two shall a new mound arise, and we will bid the mound speak to others in the fair days to come.  But distant yet be the hour when the mighty shall be laid low! and the tongue of thy bard may yet chant the rush of the lion from the toils and the spears.  Hope still!\"  Gryffyth, for answer, leant on the harper's shoulder, and pointed silently to the sea, that lay, lake-like at the distance, dark-studded with the Saxon fleet.  Then turning, his hands stretched over the forms that, hollow-eyed and ghost-like, flitted between the walls, or lay dying, but mute, around the waterspring.  His hand then dropped, and rested on the hilt of his sword.  At this moment there was a sudden commotion at the outer entrance of the wall; the crowd gathered to one spot, and there was a loud hum of voices.  In a few moments one of the Welch scouts came into the enclosure, and the chiefs of the royal tribes followed him to the carn on which the King stood.  \"Of what tellest thou?\" said Gryffyth, resuming on the instant all the royalty of his bearing.  \"At the mouth of the pass,\" said the scout, kneeling, \"there are a monk bearing the holy rood, and a chief, unarmed.  And the monk is Evan, the Cymrian, of Gwentland; and the chief, by his voice, seemeth not to be Saxon.  The monk bade me give thee these tokens\" (and the scout displayed the broken torque which the King had left in the grasp of Harold, together with a live falcon belled and blinded), \"and bade me say thus to the King: Harold the Earl greets Gryffyth, son of Llewellyn, and sends him, in proof of good will, the richest prize he hath ever won from a foe; and a hawk, from Llandudno;--that bird which chief and equal give to equal and chief.  And he prays Gryffyth, son of Llewellyn, for the sake of his realm and his people, to grant hearing to his nuncius.\"  A murmur broke from the chiefs--a murmur of joy and surprise from all, save the three conspirators, who interchanged anxious and fiery glances.  Gryffyth's hand had already closed, while he uttered a cry that seemed of rapture, on the collar of gold; for the loss of that collar had stung him, perhaps more than the loss of the crown of all Wales.  And his heart, so generous and large, amidst all its rude passions, was touched by the speech and the tokens that honoured the fallen outlaw both as foe and as king.  Yet in his face there was still seen a moody and proud struggle; he paused before he turned to the chiefs.  \"What counsel ye--ye strong in battle, and wise in debate?\" said he.  With one voice all, save the Fatal Three, exclaimed: \"Hear the monk, O King!\"  \"Shall we dissuade?\" whispered Modred to the old chief, his accomplice.  \"No; for so doing, we shall offend all:--and we must win all.\"  Then the bard stepped into the ring.  And the ring was hushed, for wise is ever the counsel of him whose book is the human heart.  \"Hear the Saxons,\" said he, briefly, and with an air of command when addressing others, which contrasted strongly his tender respect to the King; \"hear the Saxons, but not in these walls.  Let no man from the foe see our strength or our weakness.  We are still mighty and impregnable, while our dwelling is in the realm of the Unknown.  Let the King, and his officers of state, and his chieftains of battle, descend to the pass.  And behind, at the distance, let the spearmen range from cliff to cliff, as a ladder of steel; so will their numbers seem the greater.\"  \"Thou speakest well,\" said the King.  Meanwhile the knight and the monk waited below at that terrible pass [170], which then lay between mountain and river, and over which the precipices frowned, with a sense of horror and weight.  Looking up, the knight murmured:  \"With those stones and crags to roll down on a marching army, the place well defies storm and assault; and a hundred on the height would overmatch thousands below.\"  He then turned to address a few words, with all the far-famed courtesy of Norman and Frank, to the Welch guards at the outpost.  They were picked men; the strongest and best armed and best fed of the group. But they shook their heads and answered not, gazing at him fiercely, and showing their white teeth, as dogs at a bear before they are loosened from the band.  \"They understand me not, poor languageless savages!\" said Mallet de Graville, turning to the monk, who stood by with the lifted rood; \"speak to"]]]
