All this inspired me with courage, as well as contempt; and not liking to be beholden solely to my priority of birth for my priority of distinction, I resolved to become as agreeable as possible.  If I had not in the vanity of my heart resolved also to be \"myself alone,\" Fate would have furnished me at the happiest age for successful imitation with an admirable model.  Time rolled on; two years were flown since I had left school, and Montreuil was not yet returned.  I had passed the age of eighteen, when the whole house, which, as it was summer, when none but cats and physicians were supposed gifted by Providence with the power to exist in town, was uncommonly full,--the whole house, I say, was thrown into a positive fever of expectation.  The visit of a guest, if not of greater consequence at least of greater interest than any who had hitherto honoured my uncle, was announced.  Even the young Count, with the most imposing air in the world and the finest eyes, was forgotten by everybody but the Duchess of Lackland and her daughters, who had just returned to Devereux Court to observe how amazingly the Count had grown! Oh! what a prodigy wisdom would be, if it were but blest with a memory as keen and constant as that of interest!  Struck with the universal excitement, I went to my uncle to inquire the name of the expected guest.  My uncle was occupied in fanning the Lady Hasselton, a daughter of one of King Charles's Beauties.  He had only time to answer me literally, and without comment; the guest's name was Mr. St. John.  I had never conned the \"Flying Post,\" and I knew nothing about politics. \"Who is Mr. St. John?\" said I; my uncle had renewed the office of a zephyr.  The daughter of the Beauty heard and answered, \"The most charming person in England.\"  I bowed and turned away.  \"How vastly explanatory!\" said I.  I met a furious politician.  \"Who is Mr. St. John?\" I asked.  \"The cleverest man in England,\" answered the politician, hurrying off with a pamphlet in his hand.  \"Nothing can be more satisfactory,\" thought I.  Stopping a coxcomb of the first water, \"Who is Mr. St. John?\" I asked.  \"The finest gentleman in England,\" answered the coxcomb, settling his cravat.  \"Perfectly intelligible!\" was my reflection on this reply; and I forthwith arrested a Whig parson,--\"Who is Mr. St. John?\" said I.  \"The greatest reprobate in England!\" answered the Whig parson, and I was too stunned to inquire more.  Five minutes afterwards the sound of carriage wheels was heard in the courtyard, then a slight bustle in the hall, and the door of the ante-room being thrown open Mr. St. John entered.  He was in the very prime of life, about the middle height, and of a mien and air so strikingly noble that it was some time before you recovered the general effect of his person sufficiently to examine its peculiar claims to admiration.  However, he lost nothing by a further survey: he possessed not only an eminently handsome but a very extraordinary countenance.  Through an air of /nonchalance/, and even something of lassitude; through an ease of manners sometimes sinking into effeminate softness, sometimes bordering upon licentious effrontery,--his eye thoughtful, yet wandering, seemed to announce that the mind partook but little of the whim of the moment, or of those levities of ordinary life over which the grace of his manner threw so peculiar a charm.  His brow was, perhaps, rather too large and prominent for the exactness of perfect symmetry, but it had an expression of great mental power and determination.  His features were high, yet delicate, and his mouth, which, when closed, assumed a firm and rather severe expression, softened, when speaking, into a smile of almost magical enchantment. Richly but not extravagantly dressed, he appeared to cultivate rather than disdain the ornaments of outward appearance; and whatever can fascinate or attract was so inherent in this singular man that all which in others would have been most artificial was in him most natural: so that it is no exaggeration to add that to be well dressed seemed to the elegance of his person not so much the result of art as of a property innate and peculiar to himself.  Such was the outward appearance of Henry St. John; one well suited to the qualities of a mind at once more vigorous and more accomplished than that of any other person with whom the vicissitudes of my life have ever brought me into contact.  I kept my eye on the new guest throughout the whole day: I observed the mingled liveliness and softness which pervaded his attentions to women, the intellectual yet unpedantic superiority he possessed in his conversations with men; his respectful demeanour to age; his careless, yet not over-familiar, ease with the young; and, what interested me more than all, the occasional cloud which passed over his countenance at moments when he seemed sunk into a revery that had for its objects nothing in common with those around him.  Just before dinner St. John was talking to a little group, among whom curiosity seemed to have drawn the Whig parson whom I have before mentioned.  He stood at a little distance, shy and uneasy; one of the company took advantage of so favourable a butt for jests, and alluded to the bystander in a witticism which drew laughter from all but St. John, who, turning suddenly towards the parson, addressed an observation to him in the most respectful tone.  Nor did he cease talking with him (fatiguing as the conference must have been, for never was there a duller ecclesiastic than the gentleman conversed with) until we descended to dinner.  Then, for the first time, I learned that nothing can constitute good breeding that has not good-nature for its foundation; and then, too, as I was leading Lady Barbara Lackland to the great hall by the tip of her forefinger I made another observation. Passing the priest, I heard him say to a fellow-clerk,--  \"Certainly, he is the greatest man in England;\" and I mentally remarked, \"There is no policy like politeness; and a good manner is the best thing in the world, either to get one a good name or to supply the want of it.\"    CHAPTER VI.  A DIALOGUE, WHICH MIGHT BE DULL IF IT WERE LONGER.  THREE days after the arrival of St. John, I escaped from the crowd of impertinents, seized a volume of Cowley, and, in a fit of mingled poetry and melancholy, strolled idly into the park.  I came to the margin of the stream, and to the very spot on which I had stood with my uncle on the evening when he had first excited my emulation to scholastic rather than manual contention with my brother; I seated myself by the water-side, and, feeling indisposed to read, leaned my cheek upon my hand, and surrendered my thoughts as prisoners to the reflections which I could not resist.  I continued I know not how long in my meditation, till I was roused by a gentle touch upon my shoulder; I looked up, and saw St. John.  \"Pardon me, Count,\" said he, smiling, \"I should not have disturbed your reflections had not your neglect of an old friend emboldened me to address you upon his behalf.\"  And St. John pointed to the volume of Cowley which he had taken up without my perceiving it.  \"Well,\" added he, seating himself on the turf beside me, \"in my younger days, poetry and I were better friends than we are now.  And if I had had Cowley as a companion, I should not have parted with him as you have done, even for my own reflections.\"  \"You admire him then?\" said I.  \"Why, that is too general a question.  I admire what is fine in him, as in every one else, but I do not love him the better for his points and his conceits.  He reminds me of what Cardinal Pallavicino said of Seneca, that he 'perfumes his conceits with civet and ambergris.' However, Count, I have opened upon a beautiful motto for you:--    \"'Here let me, careless and unthoughtful lying,     Hear the soft winds above me flying,     With all their wanton boughs dispute,     And the more tuneful birds to both replying;     Nor be myself too mute.'  \"What say you to that wish?  If you have a germ of poetry in you such verse ought to bring it into flower.\"  \"Ay,\" answered I, though not exactly in accordance with the truth; \"but I have not that germ.  I destroyed it four years ago.  Reading the dedications of poets cured me of the love for poetry.  What a pity that the Divine Inspiration should have for its oracles such mean souls!\"  \"Yes, and how industrious the good gentlemen are in debasing themselves! Their ingenuity is never half so much shown in a simile as in a compliment; I know nothing in nature more melancholy than the discovery of any meanness in a great man.  There is so little to redeem the dry mass of follies and errors from which the materials of this life are composed, that anything to love or to reverence becomes, as it were, the sabbath for the mind.  It is better to feel, as we grow older, how the respite is abridged, and how the few objects left to our admiration are abased.  What a foe not only to life, but to all that dignifies and ennobles it, is Time!  Our affections and our pleasures resemble those fabulous trees described by Saint Oderic: the fruits which they bring forth are no sooner ripened into maturity than they are transformed into birds and fly away.  But these reflections cannot yet be familiar to you.  Let us return to Cowley.  Do you feel any sympathy with his prose writings?  For some minds they have a great attraction.\"  \"They have for mine,\" answered I: \"but then I am naturally a dreamer; and a contemplative egotist is always to me a mirror in which I behold myself.\"  \"The world,\" answered St. John, with a melancholy smile, \"will soon dissolve, or forever confirm, your humour for dreaming; in either case, Cowley will not be less a favourite.  But you must, like me, have long toiled in the heat and travail of business, or of pleasure, which is more "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7626"],["title","Devereux — Volume 03 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Dagny,                and David Widger,      BOOK III.    CHAPTER I.  WHEREIN THE HISTORY MAKES GREAT PROGRESS AND IS MARKED BY ONE IMPORTANT EVENT IN HUMAN LIFE.  SPINOZA is said to have loved, above all other amusements, to put flies into a spider's web; and the struggles of the imprisoned insects were wont to bear, in the eyes of this grave philosopher, so facetious and hilarious an appearance, that he would stand and laugh thereat until the tears \"coursed one another down his innocent nose.\"  Now it so happened that Spinoza, despite the general (and, in my most meek opinion, the just) condemnation of his theoretical tenets,* was, in character and in nature, according to the voices of all who knew him, an exceedingly kind, humane, and benevolent biped; and it doth, therefore, seem a little strange unto us grave, sober members of the unphilosophical Many, that the struggles and terrors of these little winged creatures should strike the good subtleist in a point of view so irresistibly ludicrous and delightful.  But, for my part, I believe that that most imaginative and wild speculator beheld in the entangled flies nothing more than a living simile--an animated illustration--of his own beloved vision of Necessity; and that he is no more to be considered cruel for the complacency with which he gazed upon those agonized types of his system than is Lucan for dwelling with a poet's pleasure upon the many ingenious ways with which that Grand Inquisitor of Verse has contrived to vary the simple operation of dying.  To the bard, the butchered soldier was only an epic ornament; to the philosopher, the murdered fly was only a metaphysical illustration.  For, without being a fatalist, or a disciple of Baruch de Spinoza, I must confess that I cannot conceive a greater resemblance to our human and earthly state than the penal predicament of the devoted flies.  Suddenly do we find ourselves plunged into that Vast Web,--the World; and even as the insect, when he first undergoeth a similar accident of necessity, standeth amazed and still, and only by little and little awakeneth to a full sense of his situation; so also at the first abashed and confounded, we remain on the mesh we are urged upon, ignorant, as yet, of the toils around us, and the sly, dark, immitigable foe that lieth in yonder nook, already feasting her imagination upon our destruction.  Presently we revive, we stir, we flutter; and Fate, that foe--the old arch-spider, that hath no moderation in her maw--now fixeth one of her many eyes upon us, and giveth us a partial glimpse of her laidly and grim aspect.  We pause in mute terror; we gaze upon the ugly spectre, so imperfectly beheld; the net ceases to tremble, and the wily enemy draws gently back into her nook.  Now we begin to breathe again; we sound the strange footing on which we tread; we move tenderly along it, and again the grisly monster advances on us; again we pause; the foe retires not, but remains still, and surveyeth us; we see every step is accompanied with danger; we look round and above in despair; suddenly we feel within us a new impulse and a new power! we feel a vague sympathy with /that/ unknown region which spreads beyond this great net,--/that limitless beyond/ hath a mystic affinity with a part of our own frame; we unconsciously extend our wings (for the soul to us is as the wings to the fly!); we attempt to rise,--to soar above this perilous snare, from which we are unable to crawl.  The old spider watcheth us in self-hugging quiet, and, looking up to our native air, we think,--now shall we escape thee.  Out on it! We rise not a hair's breadth: we have the /wings/, it is true, but the /feet/ are fettered.  We strive desperately again: the whole web vibrates with the effort; it will break beneath our strength.  Not a jot of it! we cease; we are more entangled than ever! wings, feet, frame, the foul slime is over all! where shall we turn? every line of the web leads to the one den,--we know not,--we care not,--we grow blind, confused, lost.  The eyes of our hideous foe gloat upon us; she whetteth her insatiate maw; she leapeth towards us; she fixeth her fangs upon us; and so endeth my parallel!   * One ought, however, to be very cautious before one condemns a philosopher.  The master's opinions are generally pure: it is the conclusions and corollaries of his disciples that \"draw the honey forth that drives men mad.\"  Schlegel seems to have studied Spinoza /de fonte/, and vindicates him very earnestly from the charges brought against him,--atheism, etc.--ED.   But what has this to do with my tale?  Ay, Reader, that is thy question; and I will answer it by one of mine.  When thou hearest a man moralize and preach of Fate, art thou not sure that he is going to tell thee of some one of his peculiar misfortunes?  Sorrow loves a parable as much as mirth loves a jest.  And thus already and from afar, I prepare thee, at the commencement of this, the third of these portions into which the history of my various and wild life will be divided, for that event with which I purpose that the said portion shall be concluded.  It is now three months after my entire recovery from my wounds, and I am married to Isora!--married,--yes, but /privately/ married, and the ceremony is as yet closely concealed.  I will explain.  The moment Isora's anxiety for me led her across the threshold of my house it became necessary for her honour that our wedding should take place immediately on my recovery: so far I was decided on the measure; now for the method.  During my illness, I received a long and most affectionate letter from Aubrey, who was then at Devereux Court: /so/ affectionate was the heart-breathing spirit of that letter, so steeped in all our old household remembrances and boyish feelings, that coupled as it was with a certain gloom when he spoke of himself and of worldly sins and trials, it brought tears to my eyes whenever I recurred to it; and many and many a time afterwards, when I thought his affections seemed estranged from me, I did recur to it to convince myself that I was mistaken.  Shortly afterwards I received also a brief epistle from my uncle; it was as kind as usual, and it mentioned Aubrey's return to Devereux Court.  \"That unhappy boy,\" said Sir William, \"is more than ever devoted to his religious duties; nor do I believe that any priest-ridden poor devil in the dark ages ever made such use of the scourge and the penance.\"  Now, I have before stated that my uncle would, I knew, be averse to my intended marriage; and on hearing that Aubrey was then with him, I resolved, in replying to his letter, to entreat the former to sound Sir William on the subject I had most at heart, and ascertain the exact nature and extent of the opposition I should have to encounter in the step I was resolved to take.  By the same post I wrote to the good old knight in as artful a strain as I was able, dwelling at some length upon my passion, upon the high birth, as well as the numerous good qualities of the object, but mentioning not her name; and I added everything that I thought likely to enlist my uncle's kind and warm feelings on my behalf.  These letters produced the following ones:--   FROM SIR WILLIAM DEVEREUX.  'Sdeath, nephew Morton,--but I won't scold thee, though thou deservest it.  Let me see, thou art now scarce twenty, and thou talkest of marriage, which is the exclusive business of middle age, as familiarly as \"girls of thirteen do of puppy-dogs.\"  Marry!--go hang thyself rather.  Marriage, my dear boy, is at the best a treacherous proceeding; and a friend--a true friend--will never counsel another to adopt it rashly.  Look you: I have had experience in these matters; and, I think, the moment a woman is wedded some terrible revolution happens in her system;  all her former good qualities vanish, /hey presto/! like eggs out of a conjuror's box; 'tis true they appear on t' other side of the box, the side turned to other people, but for the poor husband they are gone forever.  Ods fish, Morton, go to!  I tell thee again that I have had experience in these matters which thou never hast had, clever as thou thinkest thyself.  If now it were a good marriage thou wert about to make; if thou wert going to wed power, and money, and places at court,--why, something might be said for thee.  As it is, there is no excuse--none.  And I am astonished how a boy of thy sense could think of such nonsense.  Birth, Morton, what the devil does that signify so long as it is birth in another country?  A foreign damsel, and a Spanish girl, too, above all others!  'Sdeath, man, as if there was not quicksilver enough in the English women for you, you must make a mercurial exportation from Spain, must you!  Why, Morton, Morton, the ladies in that country are proverbial.  I tremble at the very thought of it.  But as for my consent, I never will give it,--never; and though I threaten thee not with disinheritance and such like, yet I do ask something in return for the great affection I have always borne thee; and I make no doubt that thou wilt readily oblige me in such a trifle as giving up a mere Spanish donna.  So think of her no more.  If thou wantest to make love, there are ladies in plenty whom thou needest not to marry.  And for my part, I thought that thou wert all in all with the Lady Hasselton: Heaven bless her pretty face!  Now don't think I want to scold thee; and don't think thine old uncle harsh,--God knows he is not,--but my dear, dear boy, this is quite out of the question, and thou must let me hear no more about it.  The gout cripples me so that I must leave off.  Ever thine old uncle,       WILLIAM DEVEREUX.  P. S.  Upon consideration, I think, my dear boy, that thou must want money, and thou art ever too sparing.  Messrs. Child, or my goldsmiths in Aldersgate, have my orders to pay to thy hand's-writing whatever thou mayst desire; and I do hope that thou wilt now want nothing to make"]]]
