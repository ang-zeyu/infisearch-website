This palace is a prison-house to me.  I will speak to the Lord Hastings, a man of great excellence, and gentle too.  He is ever kind to us.\"  \"No, no, Father, not to him,\" cried Sibyll, turning pale,--\"let him not know a word of what we would propose, nor whither we would fly.\"  \"Child, he loves me, or why does he seek me so often, and sit and talk not?\"  Sibyll pressed her clasped hands tightly to her bosom, but made no answer; and while she was summoning courage to say something that seemed to oppress her thoughts with intolerable weight, a footstep sounded gently near, and the Lady of Bonville (then on a visit to the queen), unseen and unheard by the two, approached the spot.  She paused, and gazed at Sibyll, at first haughtily; and then, as the deep sadness of that young face struck her softer feelings, and the pathetic picture of father and child, thus alone in their commune, made its pious and sweet effect, the gaze changed from pride to compassion, and the lady said courteously,--  \"Fair mistress, canst thou prefer this solitary scene to the gay company about to take the air in her grace's gilded barge?\"  Sibyll looked up in surprise, not unmixed with fear.  Never before had the great lady spoken to her thus gently.  Adam, who seemed for a while restored to the actual life, saluted Katherine with simple dignity, and took up the word,--  \"Noble lady, whoever thou art, in thine old age, and thine hour of care, may thy child, like this poor girl, forsake all gayer comrades for a parent's side!\"  The answer touched the Lady of Bonville, and involuntarily she extended her hand to Sibyll.  With a swelling heart, Sibyll, as proud as herself, bent silently over that rival's hand.  Katherine's marble cheek coloured, as she interpreted the girl's silence.  \"Gentle sir,\" she said, after a short pause, \"wilt thou permit me a few words with thy fair daughter?  And if in aught, since thou speakest of care, Lord Warwick's sister can serve thee, prithee bid thy young maiden impart it, as to a friend.\"  \"Tell her, then, my Sibyll,--tell Lord Warwick's sister to ask the king to give back to Adam Warner his poverty, his labour, and his hope,\" said the scholar, and his noble head sank gloomily on his bosom.  The Lady of Bonville, still holding Sibyll's hand, drew her a few paces up the walk, and then she said suddenly, and with some of that blunt frankness which belonged to her great brother, \"Maiden, can there be confidence between thee and me?\"  \"Of what nature, lady?\"  Again Katherine blushed, but she felt the small hand she held tremble in her clasp, and was emboldened,--  \"Maiden, thou mayst resent and marvel at my words; but when I had fewer years than thou, my father said, 'There are many carks in life which a little truth could end.'  So would I heed his lesson.  William de Hastings has followed thee with an homage that has broken, perchance, many as pure a heart,--nay, nay, fair child, hear me on. Thou hast heard that in youth he wooed Katherine Nevile,--that we loved, and were severed.  They who see us now marvel whether we hate or love,--no, not love--that question were an insult to Lord Bonville's wife!--Ofttimes we seem pitiless to each other,--why?  Lord Hastings would have wooed me, an English matron, to forget mine honour and my House's.  He chafes that he moves me not.  I behold him debasing a great nature to unworthy triflings with man's conscience and a knight's bright faith.  But mark me!--the heart of Hastings is everlastingly mine, and mine alone!  What seek I in this confidence? To warn thee.  Wherefore?  Because for months, amidst all the vices of this foul court-air, amidst the flatteries of the softest voice that ever fell upon woman's ear, amidst, peradventure, the pleadings of thine own young and guileless love, thine innocence is unscathed.  And therefore Katherine of Bonville may be the friend of Sibyll Warner.\"  However generous might be the true spirit of these words, it was impossible that they should not gall and humiliate the young and flattered beauty to whom they were addressed.  They so wholly discarded all belief in the affection of Hastings for Sibyll; they so haughtily arrogated the mastery over his heart; they so plainly implied that his suit to the poor maiden was but a mockery or dishonour, that they made even the praise for virtue an affront to the delicate and chaste ear on which they fell.  And, therefore, the reader will not be astonished, though the Lady of Bonville certainly was, when Sibyll, drawing her hand from Katherine's clasp, stopping short, and calmly folding her arms upon her bosom, said,--  \"To what this tends, lady, I know not.  The Lord Hastings is free to carry his homage where he will.  He has sought me,--not I Lord Hastings.  And if to-morrow he offered me his hand, I would reject it, if I were not convinced that the heart--\"  \"Damsel,\" interrupted the Lady Bonville, in amazed contempt, \"the hand of Lord Hastings!  Look ye indeed so high, or has he so far paltered with your credulous youth as to speak to you, the daughter of the alchemist, of marriage?  If so, poor child, beware!  \"I knew not,\" replied Sibyll, bitterly, \"that Sibyll Warner was more below the state of Lord Hastings than Master Hastings was once below the state of Lady Katherine Nevile.\"  \"Thou art distraught with thy self-conceit,\" answered the dame, scornfully; and, losing all the compassion and friendly interest she had before felt, \"my rede is spoken,--reject it if thou wilt in pride. Rue thy folly thou wilt in shame!\"  She drew her wimple round her face as she said these words, and, gathering up her long robe, swept slowly on.     CHAPTER III.  WHEREIN THE DEMAGOGUE SEEKS THE COURTIER.  On quitting Adam's chamber, Hilyard paused not till he reached a stately house, not far from Warwick Lane, which was the residence of the Lord Montagu.  That nobleman was employed in reading, or rather, in pondering over, two letters, with which a courier from Calais had just arrived, the one from the archbishop, the other from Warwick.  In these epistles were two passages, strangely contradictory in their counsel.  A sentence in Warwick's letter ran thus:--  \"It hath reached me that certain disaffected men meditate a rising against the king, under pretext of wrongs from the queen's kin.  It is even said that our kinsmen, Copiers and Fitzhugh, are engaged therein. Need I caution thee to watch well that they bring our name into no disgrace or attaint?  We want no aid to right our own wrongs; and if the misguided men rebel, Warwick will best punish Edward by proving that he is yet of use.\"  On the other hand, thus wrote the prelate:--  \"The king, wroth with my visit to Calais, has taken from me the chancellor's seal.  I humbly thank him, and shall sleep the lighter for the fardel's loss.  Now, mark me, Montagu: our kinsman, Lord Fitzhugh's son, and young Henry Nevile, aided by old Sir John Copiers, meditate a fierce and well-timed assault upon the Woodvilles.  Do thou keep neuter,--neither help nor frustrate it.  Howsoever it end, it will answer our views, and shake our enemies.\"  Montagu was yet musing over these tidings, and marvelling that he in England should know less than his brethren in Calais of events so important, when his page informed him that a stranger, with urgent messages from the north country, craved an audience.  Imagining that these messages would tend to illustrate the communications just received, he ordered the visitor to be admitted.  He scarcely noticed Hilyard on his entrance, and said abruptly, \"Speak shortly, friend,--I have but little leisure.\"  \"And yet, Lord Montagu, my business may touch thee home.\"  Montagu, surprised, gazed more attentively on his visitor: \"Surely, I know thy face, friend,--we have met before.\"  \"True; thou wert then on thy way to the More.\"  \"I remember me; and thou then seemedst, from thy bold words, on a still shorter road to the gallows.\"  \"The tree is not planted,\" said Robin, carelessly, \"that will serve for my gibbet.  But were there no words uttered by me that thou couldst not disapprove?  I spoke of lawless disorders, of shameful malfaisance throughout the land, which the Woodvilles govern under a lewd tyrant--\"  \"Traitor, hold!\"  \"A tyrant,\" continued Robin, heeding not the interruption nor the angry gesture of Montagu, \"a tyrant who at this moment meditates the destruction of the House of Nevile.  And not contented with this world's weapons, palters with the Evil One for the snares and devilries of witchcraft.\"  \"Hush, man!  Not so loud,\" said Montagu, in an altered voice. \"Approach nearer,--nearer yet.  They who talk of a crowned king, whose right hand raises armies, and whose left hand reposes on the block, should beware how they speak above their breath.  Witchcraft, sayest thou?  Make thy meaning clear.\"  Here Robin detailed, with but little exaggeration, the scene he had witnessed in Friar Bungey's chamber,--the waxen image, the menaces against the Earl of Warwick, and the words of the friar, naming the Duchess of Bedford as his employer.  Montagu listened in attentive silence.  Though not perfectly free from the credulities of the time, shared even by the courageous heart of Edward and the piercing intellect of Gloucester, he was yet more alarmed by such proofs of determined earthly hostility in one so plotting and so near to the throne as the Duchess of Bedford, than by all the pins and needles that could be planted into the earl's waxen counterpart.  \"A devilish malice, indeed,\" said he, when Hilyard had concluded; \"and yet this story, if thou wilt adhere to it, may serve us well at need. I thank thee, trusty friend, for thy confidence, and beseech thee to come at once with me to the king.  There will I denounce our foe, and, with thine evidence, we will demand "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7720"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 06 (#4)"],["body","banishment.\"  \"By your leave, not a step will I budge, my Lord Montagu,\" quoth Robin, bluntly,--\"I know how these matters are managed at court.  The king will patch up a peace between the duchess and you, and chop off my ears and nose as a liar and common scandal-maker.  No, no; denounce the duchess and all the Woodvilles I will; but it shall not be in the halls of the Tower, but on the broad plains of Yorkshire, with twenty thousand men at my back.\"  \"Ha! thou a leader of armies,--and for what end,--to dethrone the king?\"  \"That as it may be,--but first for justice to the people; it is the people's rising that I will head, and not a faction's.  Neither White Rose nor Red shall be on my banner; but our standard shall be the gory head of the first oppressor we can place upon a pole.\"  \"What is it the people, as you word it, would demand?\"  \"I scarce know what we demand as yet,--that must depend upon how we prosper,\" returned Hilyard, with a bitter laugh; \"but the rising will have some good, if it shows only to you lords and Normans that a Saxon people does exist, and will turn when the iron heel is upon its neck. We are taxed, ground, pillaged, plundered,--sheep, maintained to be sheared for your peace or butchered for your war.  And now will we have a petition and a charter of our own, Lord Montagu.  I speak frankly.  I am in thy power; thou canst arrest me, thou canst strike off the head of this revolt.  Thou art the king's friend,--wilt thou do so?  No, thou and thy House have wrongs as well as we, the people. And a part at least of our demands and our purpose is your own.\"  \"What part, bold man?\"  \"This: we shall make our first complaint the baneful domination of the queen's family; and demand the banishment of the Woodvilles, root and stem.\"  \"Hem!\" said Montagu, involuntarily glancing over the archbishop's letter,--\"hem, but without outrage to the king's state and person?\"  \"Oh, trust me, my lord, the franklin's head contains as much north- country cunning as the noble's.  They who would speed well must feel their way cautiously.\"  \"Twenty thousand men--impossible!  Who art thou, to collect and head them?\"  \"Plain Robin of Redesdale.\"  \"Ha!\" exclaimed Montagu, \"is it indeed as I was taught to suspect? Art thou that bold, strange, mad fellow, whom, by pike and brand--a soldier's oath--I, a soldier, have often longed to see.  Let me look at thee.  'Fore Saint George, a tall man, and well knit, with dareiment on thy brow.  Why, there are as many tales of thee in the North as of my brother the earl.  Some say thou art a lord of degree and birth, others that thou art the robber of Hexham to whom Margaret of Anjou trusted her own life and her son's.\"  \"Whatever they say of me,\" returned Robin, \"they all agree in this,-- that I am a man of honest word and bold deed; that I can stir up the hearts of men, as the wind stirreth fire; that I came an unknown stranger into the parts where I abide; and that no peer in this roiaulme, save Warwick himself, can do more to raise an army or shake a throne.\"  \"But by what spell?\"  \"By men's wrongs, lord,\" answered Robin, in a deep voice; \"and now, ere this moon wanes, Redesdale is a camp!\"  \"What the immediate cause of complaint?\"  \"The hospital of St. Leonard's has compelled us unjustly to render them a thrave of corn.\"  \"Thou art a cunning knave!  Pinch the belly if you would make Englishmen rise.\"  \"True,\" said Robin, smiling grimly; \"and now--what say you--will you head us?\"  \"Head you!  No I\"  \"Will you betray us?\"  \"It is not easy to betray twenty thousand men; if ye rise merely to free yourselves from a corn-tax and England from the Woodvilles, I see no treason in your revolt.\"  \"I understand you, Lord Montagu,\" said Robin, with a stern and half- scornful smile,--\"you are not above thriving by our danger; but we need now no lord and baron,--we will suffice for ourselves.  And the hour will come, believe me, when Lord Warwick, pursued by the king, must fly to the Commons.  Think well of these things and this prophecy, when the news from the North startles Edward of March in the lap of his harlots.\"  Without saying another word, he turned and quitted the chamber as abruptly as he had entered.  Lord Montagu was not, for his age, a bad man; though worldly, subtle, and designing, with some of the craft of his prelate brother he united something of the high soul of his brother soldier.  But that age had not the virtue of later times, and cannot be judged by its standard. He heard this bold dare-devil menace his country with civil war upon grounds not plainly stated nor clearly understood,--he aided not, but he connived: \"Twenty thousand men in arms,\" he muttered to himself,-- \"say half-well, ten thousand--not against Edward, but the Woodvilles! It must bring the king to his senses; must prove to him how odious the mushroom race of the Woodvilles, and drive him for safety and for refuge to Montagu and Warwick.  If the knaves presume too far,\" (and Montagu smiled), \"what are undisciplined multitudes to the eye of a skilful captain?  Let the storm blow, we will guide the blast. In this world man must make use of man.\"     CHAPTER IV.  SIBYLL.  While Montagu in anxious forethought awaited the revolt that Robin of Redesdale had predicted; while Edward feasted and laughed, merry-made with his courtiers, and aided the conjugal duties of his good citizens in London; while the queen and her father, Lord Rivers, more and more in the absence of Warwick encroached on all the good things power can bestow and avarice seize; while the Duchess of Bedford and Friar Bungey toiled hard at the waxen effigies of the great earl, who still held his royal son-in-law in his court at Calais,--the stream of our narrative winds from its noisier channels, and lingers, with a quiet wave, around the temple of a virgin's heart.  Wherefore is Sibyll sad? Some short month since and we beheld her gay with hope and basking in the sunny atmosphere of pleasure and of love.  The mind of this girl was a singular combination of tenderness and pride,--the first wholly natural, the last the result of circumstance and position.  She was keenly conscious of her gentle birth and her earlier prospects in the court of Margaret; and the poverty and distress and solitude in which she had grown up from the child into the woman had only served to strengthen what, in her nature, was already strong, and to heighten whatever was already proud.  Ever in her youngest dreams of the future ambition had visibly blent itself with the vague ideas of love.  The imagined wooer was less to be young and fair than renowned and stately.  She viewed him through the mists of the future, as the protector of her persecuted father, as the rebuilder of a fallen House, as the ennobler of a humbled name; and from the moment in which her girl's heart beat at the voice of Hastings, the ideal of her soul seemed found.  And when, transplanted to the court, she learned to judge of her native grace and loveliness by the common admiration they excited, her hopes grew justified to her inexperienced reason.  Often and ever the words of Hastings, at the house of Lady Longueville, rang in her ear, and thrilled through the solitude of night,--\"Whoever is fair and chaste, gentle and loving, is in the eyes of William de Hastings the mate and equal of a king.\"  In visits that she had found opportunity to make to the Lady Longueville, these hopes were duly fed; for the old Lancastrian detested the Lady Bonville, as Lord Warwick's sister, and she would have reconciled her pride to view with complacency his alliance with the alchemist's daughter, if it led to his estrangement from the memory of his first love; and, therefore, when her quick eye penetrated the secret of Sibyll's heart, and when she witnessed--for Hastings often encountered (and seemed to seek the encounter) the young maid at Lady Longueville's house--the unconcealed admiration which justified Sibyll in her high-placed affection, she scrupled not to encourage the blushing girl by predictions in which she forced her own better judgment to believe.  Nor, when she learned Sibyll's descent from a family that had once ranked as high as that of Hastings, would she allow that there was any disparity in the alliance she foretold.  But more, far more than Lady Longueville's assurances, did the delicate and unceasing gallantries of Hastings himself flatter the fond faith of Sibyll.  True, that he spoke not actually of love, but every look implied, every whisper seemed to betray it.  And to her he spoke as to an equal, not in birth alone, but in mind; so superior was she in culture, in natural gifts, and, above all, in that train of high thought and elevated sentiment, in which genius ever finds a sympathy, to the court-flutterers of her sex, that Hastings, whether or not he cherished a warmer feeling, might well take pleasure in her converse, and feel the lovely infant worthy the wise man's trust. He spoke to her without reserve of the Lady Bonville, and he spoke with bitterness.  \"I loved her,\" he said, \"as woman is rarely loved.  She deserted me for another--rather should she have gone to the convent than the altar; and now, forsooth, she deems she hath the right to taunt and to rate me, to dictate to me the way I should walk, and to flaunt the honours I have won.\"  \"May that be no sign of a yet tender interest?\" said Sibyll, timidly.  The eyes of Hastings sparkled for a moment, but the gleam vanished. \"Nay, you know her not.  Her heart is marble, as hard and as cold; her very virtue but the absence of emotion,--I would say, of gentler emotion; for, pardieu, such emotions as come from ire and pride and scorn are the daily growth of that stern soil.  Oh, happy was my escape!  Happy the desertion which my young folly deemed a curse! No!\" he added, with a sarcastic quiver of his lip--\"no; what stings and galls the Lady of Harrington and Bonville, what makes her countenance change in my presence, and her"]]]
