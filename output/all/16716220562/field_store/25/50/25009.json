For it not only enabled them to keep from public view and knowledge their ultimate aim and purpose, but constituted the whip which they thenceforth everlastingly flourished and cracked over the shrinking heads of other and more patriotic people--the whip with which, through the litter of their broken promises, they ruthlessly rode into, and, for so long a period of years held on to, supreme power and place in the Land.  Including within the scope of States Rights, the threats of Nullification, Disunion and Secession--ideas abhorrent to the Patriot's mind--small wonder is it that, in those days, every fresh demand made by these political autocrats was tremblingly acceded to, until patience and concession almost utterly exhausted themselves.  Originally disturbing only South Carolina and Georgia to any extent, these ambitious men, who believed in anything rather than a Republic, and who were determined to destroy the Union, gradually spread the spirit of jealousy and discontent into other States of the South; their immediate object being to bring the Southern States into the closest possible relations the one with the other; to inspire them all with common sympathies and purposes; to compact and solidify them, so that in all coming movements against the other States of the Union, they might move with proportionately increased power, and force, and effect, because of such unity of aim and strength.  This spirit of Southern discontent, and jealousy of the Northern States, was, as we have seen, artfully fanned by the Conspirators, in heated discussions over the Tariff Acts of 1824, and 1828, and 1832, until, by the latter date, the people of the Cotton-States were almost frantic, and ready to fight over their imaginary grievances.  Then it was that the Conspirators thought the time had come, for which they had so long and so earnestly prayed and worked, when the cotton Sampson should wind his strong arms around the pillars of the Constitution and pull down the great Temple of our Union--that they might rear upon its site another and a stronger edifice, dedicated not to Freedom, but to Free-Trade and to other false gods.  South Carolina was to lead off, and the other Cotton States would follow.  South Carolina did lead off--but the other Cotton-States did not follow.  It has been shown in these pages how South Carolina declared the Tariff Acts aforesaid, null and void, armed herself to resist force, and declared that any attempt of the general Government to enforce those Acts would cause her to withdraw from the Union.  But Jackson as we know throttled the treason with so firm a grip that Nullification and Secession and Disunion were at once paralyzed.  The concessions to the domineering South, in Clay's Compromise Tariff of 1833, let the Conspirators down easily, so to speak; and they pretended to be satisfied.  But they were satisfied only as are the thirsty sands of Africa with the passing shower.  The Conspirators had, however, after all, made substantial gains.  They had established a precedent for an attempt to secede.  That was something.  They had demonstrated that a single Southern State could stand up, armed and threatening, strutting, blustering, and bullying, and at least make faces at the general Government without suffering any very dreadful consequences.  That was still more.  They had also ascertained that, by adopting such a course, a single Southern State could force concessions from the fears of the rest of the United States.  That was worth knowing, because the time might come, when it might be desirable not only for one but for all the Southern States to secede upon some other pretext, and when it would be awkward, and would interfere with the Disunion programme, to have the other States either offer or make concessions.  They had also learned the valuable lesson that the single issue of Free-Trade was not sufficiently strong of itself to unite all the Southern States in a determination to secede, and thus dissolve the Union.  They saw they must agitate some other issue to unify the South more thoroughly and justify Disunion.  On looking over the whole field they concluded that the Slavery question would best answer their purpose, and they adopted it.  It was doubtless a full knowledge of the fact that they had adopted it, that led Jackson to make the declaration, heretofore in these pages given, which has been termed \"prophetic.\"  At any rate, thenceforth the programme of the Conspirators was to agitate the Slavery question in all ways possible, so as to increase, extend and solidify the influence and strength of the Slave power; strain the bonds uniting them with the Free States; and weaken the Free States by dividing them upon the question. At the same time the Free-Trade question was to be pressed forward to a triumphal issue, so that the South might be enriched and strengthened, and the North impoverished and weakened, by the result.  That was their programme, in the rough, and it was relentlessly adhered to.  Free-Trade and Slavery by turns, if not together, from that time onward, were ever at the front, agitating our People both North and South, and not only consolidating the Southern States on those lines, as the Conspirators designed, but also serving ultimately to consolidate, to some extent--in a manner quite unlooked for by the Conspirators --Northern sentiment, on the opposite lines of Protection and Freedom.  The Compromise Tariff Act of 1833--which Clay was weak enough to concede, and even stout old Jackson to permit to become law without his signature--gave to the Conspirators great joy for years afterward, as they witnessed the distress and disaster brought by it to Northern homes and incomes--not distress and disaster alone, but absolute and apparently irreparable ruin.  The reaction occasioned by this widespread ruin having brought the Whigs into power, led to the enactment of the Protective-Tariff of 1842 and --to the chagrin of the Conspirators--industrial prosperity and plenty to the Free North again ensued.  Even as Cain hated his brother Abel because his sacrifices were acceptable in the sight of God, while his own were not, so the Southern Conspirators, and other Slave-owners also, had, by this time, come to hate the Northern free-thinking, free-acting, freedom-loving mechanic and laboring man, because the very fact and existence of his Godgiven Freedom and higher-resulting civilization was a powerful and perpetual protest against the--abounding iniquities and degradations of Slavery as practiced by themselves.  Hence, by trickery, by cajoling the People With his, and their own, assurances that he was in favor of Protection--they secured the election in 1844 of a Free-Trade President, the consequent repeal of the Protective-Tariff of 1842--which had repaired the dreadful mischief wrought by the Compromise Act of 1833--and the enactment of the infamous Free-Trade Tariff of 1846, which blasted the manufacturing and farming and trade industries of the Country again, as with fire.  The discovery of the great gold fields of California, and the enormous amount of the precious metal poured by her for many succeeding years into the lap of the Nation, alone averted what otherwise would inevitably have been total ruin.  As it was, in 1860, the National credit had sunk to a lower point than ever before in all its history. It was confessedly bankrupt, and ruin stalked abroad throughout the United States.  But while, with rapid pen, the carrying out of that part of the Southern Conspirators' Disunion programme which related to Free-Trade, is thus brought again to mind, the other part of that programme, which related to Slavery, must not be neglected or overlooked.  On this question they had determined, as we have seen, to agitate without ceasing--having in view, primarily, as already hinted, the extension of Slave territory and the resulting increase of Slave power in the Land; and, ulteriorly, the solidifying of that power, and Disunion of the Republic, with a view to its conversion into an Oligarchy, if not a Monarchy.  The bitterness of the struggle over the admission of Missouri as a Slave State in 1820, under the Missouri Compromise, was to be revived by the Conspirators, at the earliest possible moment.  Accordingly in 1836--only three years after the failure of Nullification in South Carolina, the Territory, of Arkansas was forced in as a Slave State, and simultaneously the Slave-owning henchmen of the Conspirators, previously settled there for the purpose, proclaimed the secession from Mexico, and independence, of Texas.  This was quickly followed, in 1844, by Calhoun's hastily negotiated treaty of annexation with Texas; its miscarriage in the Senate; and the Act of March 2, 1845--with its sham compromise--consenting to the admission of Texas to the Union of States.  Then came the War with Mexico; the attempt by means of the Wilmot proviso to check the growing territorial-greed and rapacity of the Slave-power; and the acquisition by the United States, of California and New Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which brought Peace.  Then occurred the agitation over the organization of  Territorial governments for Oregon, California, and New Mexico, and the strong effort to extend to the Pacific Ocean the Missouri-Compromise line of 36  30', and to extend to all future Territorial organizations the principles of that compromise.  Then came the struggle in 1850, over the admission of California as a State, and New Mexico and Utah to Territorial organization--ending in the passage of Clay's Compromise measures of 1850.  Yet still the Southern Conspirators--whose forces, both in Congress and out, were now well-disciplined, compacted, solidified, experienced, and bigotedly enthusiastic and overbearing--were not satisfied.

FREEDOM'S SUN STILL RISING.  After President Lincoln had issued his Proclamation of Emancipation, the friends of Freedom clearly perceived--and none of them more clearly than himself that until the incorporation of that great Act into the Constitution of the United States itself, there could be no real assurance of safety to the liberties of the emancipated; that unless this were done there would be left, even after the suppression of the Rebellion, a living spark of dissension which might at any time again be fanned into the flames of Civil War.  Hence, at all proper times, Mr. Lincoln favored and even urged Congressional action upon the subject.  It was not, however, until the following year that definite action may be said to have commenced in Congress toward that end; and, as Congress was slow, he found it necessary to say in his third Annual Message: \"while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emancipation Proclamation; nor shall I return to Slavery any person who is Free by the terms of that Proclamation, or by any of the Acts of Congress,\"  Meantime, however, occurred the series of glorious Union victories in the West, ending with the surrender to Grant's triumphant Forces on the 4th of July, 1863, of Vicksburg--\"the Gibraltar of the West\"--with its Garrison, Army, and enormous quantities of arms and munitions of war; thus closing a brilliant and successful Campaign with a blow which literally \"broke the back\" of the Rebellion; while, almost simultaneously, July 1-3, the Union Forces of the East, under Meade, gained the great victory of Gettysburg, and, driving the hosts of Lee from Pennsylvania, put a second and final end to Rebel invasion of Northern soil; gaining it, on ground dedicated by President Lincoln, before that year had closed--as a place of sepulture for the Patriot-soldiers who there had fallen in a brief, touching and immortal Address, which every American child should learn by heart, and every American adult ponder deeply, as embodying the very essence of true Republicanism.       [President Lincoln's Address, when the National Cemetery at      Gettysburg, Pa., was dedicated Nov.  19, 1863, was in these      memorable words:       \"Fourscore and seven years ago, our Fathers brought forth upon this      continent a new Nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the      proposition that all men are created equal.       \"Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that      Nation, or any Nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long      endure.       \"We are met on a great battlefield of that War.  We have come here      to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting-place for      those who here gave their lives that that Nation might live.       \"It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.       \"But in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate,      we can not hallow, this ground.  The brave men, living and dead,      who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our power to add      or detract.       \"The World will little note, nor long remember, what we say here;      but it can never forget what they did here.       \"It is for us, the living, rather to be dedicated here to the      unfinished work which they who fought here have, thus far, so nobly      advanced.       \"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task      remaining before us; that from these honored dead we take increased      devotion to that Cause for which they gave the last full measure of      devotion; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not      have died in vain; that this Nation, under God, shall have a new      birth of Freedom; and that Government of the People, by the People,      and for the People, shall not perish front the Earth.\"]  That season of victory for the Union arms, coming, as it did, upon a season of depression and doubtfulness, was doubly grateful to the loyal heart of the Nation.  Daylight seemed to be breaking at last. Gettysburg had hurled back the Southern invader from our soil; and Vicksburg, with the immediately resulting surrender of Port Hudson, had opened the Mississippi river from Cairo to the Gulf, and split the Confederacy in twain.  But it happened just about this time that, the enrollment of the whole Militia of the United States (under the Act of March, 1863), having been completed, and a Draft for 300,000 men ordered to be made and executed, if by a subsequent time the quotas of the various States should not be filled by volunteering, certain malcontents and Copperheads, inspired by agents and other friends of the Southern Conspirators, started and fomented, in the city of New York, a spirit of unreasoning opposition both to voluntary enlistment, and conscription under the Draft, that finally culminated, July 13th, in a terrible Riot, lasting several days, during which that great metropolis was in the hands, and completely at the mercy, of a brutal mob of Secession sympathizers, who made day and night hideous with their drunken bellowings, terrorized everybody even suspected of love for the Union, plundered and burned dwellings, including a Colored Orphan Asylum, and added to the crime of arson, that of murdering the mob-chased, terror-stricken Negroes, by hanging them to the lamp-posts.  These Riots constituted a part of that \"Fire in the Rear\" with which the Rebels and their Northern Democratic sympathizers had so frequently menaced the Armies of the Union.  Alluding to them, the N. Y.  Tribune on July 15th, while its office was invested and threatened with attack and demolition, bravely said: \"They are, in purpose and in essence, a Diversion in favor of Jefferson Davis and Lee.  Listen to the yells of the mob and the harangues of its favorite orators, and you will find them surcharged with 'Nigger,' 'Abolition,' 'Black Republican,' denunciation of prominent Republicans, The Tribune, etc. etc.--all very wide of the Draft and the exemption. Had the Abolitionists, instead of the Slaveholders, revolted, and undertaken to upset the Government and dissolve the Union, nine-tenths of these rioters would have eagerly volunteered to put them down.  It is the fear, stimulated by the recent and glorious triumphs of the Union Arms, that Slavery and the Rebellion must suffer, which is at the bottom of all this arson, devastation, robbery, and murder.\"  The Democratic Governor, Seymour, by promising to \"have this Draft suspended and stopped,\" did something toward quieting the Riots, but it was not until the Army of the Potomac, now following Lee's retreat, was weakened by the sending of several regiments to New York that the Draft-rioting spirit, in that city, and to a less extent in other cities, was thoroughly cowed.       [In reply to Gov. Seymour's appeal for delay in the execution of      the Draft Law, in order to test its Constitutionality, Mr. Lincoln,      on the 7th of August, said he could not consent to lose the time      that would be involved in obtaining a decision from the U. S.      Supreme Court on that point, and proceeded: \"We are contending with      an Enemy who, as I understand, drives every able-bodied man he can      reach into his ranks, very much as a butcher drives bullocks into a      slaughter-pen.  No time is wasted, no argument is used.       \"This system produces an Army which will soon turn upon our now      victorious soldiers already in the field, if they shall not be      sustained by recruits as they should be.       It produces an Army with a rapidity not to be matched on our side,      if we first waste time to re-experiment with the Volunteer system,      already deemed by Congress, and palpably, in fact, so far exhausted      as to be inadequate; and then more time to obtain a Court decision      as to whether a law is Constitutional which requires a part of      those not now in the Service to go to those who are already in it,      and still more time to determine with absolute certainty that we      get those who are to go, in the precisely legal proportion to those      who are not to go.       \"My purpose is to be in my action Just and Constitutional, and yet      Practical, in performing the important duty with which I am      charged, of maintaining the Unity and the Free principles of our      common Country.\"]  Worried and weakened by this Democratic opposition to the Draft, and the threatened consequent delays and dangers to the success of the Union Cause, and depressed moreover by the defeat of the National forces under Rosecrans at Chickamauga; yet, the favorable determination of the Fall elections on the side of Union and Freedom, and the immense majorities upholding those issues, together with Grant's great victory (November, 1863) of Chattanooga--where the three days of fighting in the Chattanooga Valley and up among the clouds of Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge, not only effaced the memory of Rosecrans's previous disaster, but brought fresh and imperishable laurels to the Union Arms --stiffened the President's backbone, and that of Union men everywhere.  Not that Mr. Lincoln had shown any signs of weakness or wavering, or any loss of hope in the ultimate result of this War for the preservation of the Union--which now also involved Freedom to all beneath its banner. On the contrary, a letter of his written late in August shows conclusively enough that he even then began to see clearly the coming final triumph--not perhaps as \"speedy,\" as he would like, in its coming, but none the less sure to come in God's \"own good time,\" and furthermore not appearing \"to be so distant as it did\" before Gettysburg, and especially Vicksburg, was won; for,"]]]
