He owned frankly, nevertheless, that it was the difficulties so created, that had made him incline to the Atheling;--but, convinced of that prince's incapacity, even in the most ordinary times, to rule England, he shrank yet more from such a choice, when the swords of the Norman were already sharpening for contest. Finally he said, \"If a man as fit to defend us as Harold can be found, let us prefer him: if not----\"  \"There is no other man!\" cried the thegns with one voice.  \"And,\" said a wise old chief, \"had Harold sought to play a trick to secure the throne, he could not have devised one more sure than the tale he hath now told us.  What! just when we are most assured that the doughtiest and deadliest foe that our land can brave, waits but for Edward's death to enforce on us a stranger's yoke--what! shall we for that very reason deprive ourselves of the only man able to resist him?  Harold hath taken an oath!  God wot, who among us have not taken some oath at law for which they have deemed it meet afterwards to do a penance, or endow a convent?  The wisest means to strengthen Harold against that oath, is to show the moral impossibility of fulfilling it, by placing him on the throne.  The best proof we can give to this insolent Norman that England is not for prince to leave, or subject to barter, is to choose solemnly in our Witan the very chief whom his frauds prove to us that he fears the most. Why, William would laugh in his own sleeve to summon a king to descend from his throne to do him the homage which that king, in the different capacity of subject, had (we will grant, even willingly) promised to render.\"  This speech spoke all the thoughts of the laymen, and, with Alred's previous remarks, reassured all the ecclesiastics.  They were easily induced to believe that the usual Church penances, and ample Church gifts, would suffice for the insult offered to the relics: and,--if they in so grave a case outstripped, in absolution, an authority amply sufficing for all ordinary matters,--Harold, as king, might easily gain from the Pope himself that full pardon and shrift, which as mere earl, against the Prince of the Normans, he would fail of obtaining.  These or similar reflections soon terminated the suspense of the select council; and Alred sought the Earl in the oratory, to summon him back to the conclave.  The two brothers were kneeling side by side before the little altar; and there was something inexpressibly touching in their humble attitudes, their clasped supplicating hands, in that moment when the crown of England rested above their House.  The brothers rose, and at Alred's sign followed the prelate into the council-room.  Alred briefly communicated the result of the conference; and with an aspect, and in a tone, free alike from triumph and indecision, Harold replied:  \"As ye will, so will I.  Place me only where I can most serve the common cause.  Remain you now, knowing my secret, a chosen and standing council: too great is my personal stake in this matter to allow my mind to be unbiassed; judge ye, then, and decide for me in all things: your minds should be calmer and wiser than mine; in all things I will abide by your counsel; and thus I accept the trust of a nation's freedom.\"  Each thegn then put his hand into Harold's, and called himself Harold's man.  \"Now, more than ever,\" said the wise old thegn who had before spoken, \"will it be needful to heal all dissension in the kingdom--to reconcile with us Mercia and Northumbria, and make the kingdom one against the foe.  You, as Tostig's brother, have done well to abstain from active interference; you do well to leave it to us to negotiate the necessary alliance between all brave and good men.\"  \"And to that end, as imperative for the public weal, you consent,\" said Alred, thoughtfully, \"to abide by our advice, whatever it be?\"  \"Whatever it be, so that it serve England,\" answered the Earl.  A smile, somewhat sad, flitted over the prelate's pale lips, and Harold was once more alone with Gurth.     CHAPTER VII.   The soul of all council and cabal on behalf of Harold, which has led to the determination of the principal chiefs, and which now succeeded it--was Haco.  His rank as son of Sweyn, the first-born of Godwin's house--a rank which might have authorised some pretensions on his own part, gave him all field for the exercise of an intellect singularly keen and profound.  Accustomed to an atmosphere of practical state-craft in the Norman court, with faculties sharpened from boyhood by vigilance and meditation, he exercised an extraordinary influence over the simple understandings of the homely clergy and the uncultured thegns. Impressed with the conviction of his early doom, he felt no interest in the objects of others; but equally believing that whatever of bright, and brave, and glorious, in his brief, condemned career, was to be reflected on him from the light of Harold's destiny, the sole desire of a nature, which, under other auspices, would have been intensely daring and ambitious, was to administer to Harold's greatness.  No prejudice, no principle, stood in the way of this dreary enthusiasm.  As a father, himself on the brink of the grave, schemes for the worldly grandeur of the son, in which he confounds and melts his own life, so this sombre and predestined man, dead to earth and to joy and the emotions of the heart, looked beyond his own tomb, to that existence in which he transferred and carried on his ambition.  If the leading agencies of Harold's memorable career might be, as it were, symbolised and allegorised, by the living beings with which it was connected--as Edith was the representative of stainless Truth--as Gurth was the type of dauntless Duty--as Hilda embodied aspiring Imagination--so Haco seemed the personation of Worldly Wisdom.  And cold in that worldly wisdom Haco laboured on, now conferring with Alred and the partisans of Harold; now closeted with Edwin and Morcar; now gliding from the chamber of the sick King.--That wisdom foresaw all obstacles, smoothed all difficulties; ever calm, never resting; marshalling and harmonising the things to be, like the ruthless hand of a tranquil fate.  But there was one with whom Haco was more often than with all others--one whom the presence of Harold had allured to that anxious scene of intrigue, and whose heart leapt high at the hopes whispered from the smileless lips of Haco.     CHAPTER VIII.   It was the second day after that which assured him the allegiance of the thegns, that a message was brought to Harold from the Lady Aldyth. She was in Oxford, at a convent, with her young daughter by the Welch King; she prayed him to visit her.  The Earl, whose active mind, abstaining from the intrigues around him, was delivered up to the thoughts, restless and feverish, which haunt the repose of all active minds, was not unwilling to escape awhile from himself.  He went to Aldyth.  The royal widow had laid by the signs of mourning; she was dressed with the usual stately and loose-robed splendour of Saxon matrons, and all the proud beauty of her youth was restored to her cheek.  At her feet was that daughter who afterwards married the Fleance so familiar to us in Shakespeare, and became the ancestral mother of those Scottish kings who had passed, in pale shadows, across the eyes of Macbeth [216]; by the side of that child, Harold to his surprise saw the ever ominous face of Haco.  But proud as was Aldyth, all pride seemed humbled into woman's sweeter emotions at the sight of the Earl, and she was at first unable to command words to answer his greeting.  Gradually, however, she warmed into cordial confidence.  She touched lightly on her past sorrows; she permitted it to be seen that her lot with the fierce Gryffyth had been one not more of public calamity than of domestic grief, and that in the natural awe and horror which the murder of her lord had caused, she felt rather for the ill-starred king than the beloved spouse.  She then passed to the differences still existing between her house and Harold's, and spoke well and wisely of the desire of the young Earls to conciliate his grace and favour.  While thus speaking, Morcar and Edwin, as if accidentally, entered, and their salutations of Harold were such as became their relative positions; reserved, not distant--respectful, not servile.  With the delicacy of high natures, they avoided touching on the cause before the Witan (fixed for the morrow), on which depended their earldoms or their exile.  Harold was pleased by their bearing, and attracted towards them by the memory of the affectionate words that had passed between him and Leofric, their illustrious grandsire, over his father's corpse.  He thought then of his own prayer: \"Let there be peace between thine and mine!\" and looking at their fair and stately youth, and noble carriage, he could not but feel that the men of Northumbria and of Mercia had chosen well.  The discourse, however, was naturally brief, since thus made general; the visit soon ceased, and the brothers attended Harold to the door with the courtesy of the times.  Then Haco said, with that faint movement of the lips which was his only approach to a smile:  \"Will ye not, noble thegns, give your hands to my kinsman?\"  \"Surely,\" said Edwin, the handsomer and more gentle of the two, and who, having a poet's nature, felt a poet's enthusiasm for the gallant deeds even of a rival,--\"surely, if the Earl will accept the hands of those who trust never to be compelled to draw sword against England's hero.\"  Harold stretched forth his hand in reply, and that cordial and immemorial pledge of our national friendships was interchanged.  Gaining the street, Harold said to his nephew:  \"Standing as I do towards the young Earls, that appeal of thine had been better omitted.\"  \"Nay,\" answered Haco; \"their cause is already"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7682"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 11 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK XI.   THE NORMAN SCHEMER, AND THE NORWEGIAN SEA-KING.     CHAPTER I.   It was the eve of the 5th of January--the eve of the day announced to King Edward as that of his deliverance from earth; and whether or not the prediction had wrought its own fulfilment on the fragile frame and susceptible nerves of the King, the last of the line of Cerdic was fast passing into the solemn shades of eternity.  Without the walls of the palace, through the whole city of London, the excitement was indescribable.  All the river before the palace was crowded with boats; all the broad space on the Isle of Thorney itself, thronged with anxious groups.  But a few days before the new-built Abbey had been solemnly consecrated; with the completion of that holy edifice, Edward's life itself seemed done.  Like the kings of Egypt, he had built his tomb.  Within the palace, if possible, still greater was the agitation; more dread the suspense.  Lobbies, halls, corridors, stairs, ante-rooms, were filled with churchmen and thegns.  Nor was it alone for news of the King's state that their brows were so knit, that their breath came and went so short.  It is not when a great chief is dying, that men compose their minds to deplore a loss.  That comes long after, when the worm is at its work, and comparison between the dead and the living often rights the one to wrong the other.  But while the breath is struggling, and the eye glazing, life, busy in the bystanders, murmurs,  \"Who shall be the heir?\"  And, in this instance, never had suspense been so keenly wrought up into hope and terror.  For the news of Duke William's designs had now spread far and near; and awful was the doubt, whether the abhorred Norman should receive his sole sanction to so arrogant a claim from the parting assent of Edward. Although, as we have seen, the crown was not absolutely within the bequests of a dying king, but at the will of the Witan, still, in circumstances so unparalleled, the utter failure of all natural heirs, save a boy feeble in mind as body, and half foreign by birth and rearing; the love borne by Edward to the Church; and the sentiments, half of pity half of reverence, with which he was regarded throughout the land;--his dying word would go far to influence the council and select the successor.  Some whispering to each other, with pale lips, all the dire predictions then current in men's mouths and breasts; some in moody silence; all lifted eager eyes, as, from time to time, a gloomy Benedictine passed in the direction to or fro the King's chamber.  In that chamber, traversing the past of eight centuries, enter we with hushed and noiseless feet--a room known to us in many a later scene and legend of England's troubled history, as \"THE PAINTED CHAMBER,\" long called \"THE CONFESSOR'S.\"  At the farthest end of that long and lofty space, raised upon a regal platform, and roofed with regal canopy, was the bed of death.  At the foot stood Harold; on one side knelt Edith, the King's lady; at the other Alred; while Stigand stood near--the holy rood in his hand-- and the abbot of the new monastery of Westminster by Stigand's side; and all the greatest thegns, including Morcar and Edwin, Gurth and Leofwine, all the more illustrious prelates and abbots, stood also on the dais.  In the lower end of the hall, the King's physician was warming a cordial over the brazier, and some of the subordinate officers of the household were standing in the niches of the deep-set windows; and they--not great eno' for other emotions than those of human love for their kindly lord--they wept.  The King, who had already undergone the last holy offices of the Church, was lying quite quiet, his eyes half closed, breathing low but regularly.  He had been speechless the two preceding days; on this he had uttered a few words, which showed returning consciousness.  His hand, reclined on the coverlid, was clasped in his wife's who was praying fervently.  Something in the touch of her hand, or the sound of her murmur, stirred the King from the growing lethargy, and his eyes opening, fixed on the kneeling lady.  \"Ah?\" said he faintly, \"ever good, ever meek!  Think not I did not love thee; hearts will be read yonder; we shall have our guerdon.\"  The lady looked up through her streaming tears.  Edward released his hand, and laid it on her head as in benediction.  Then motioning to the abbot of Westminster, he drew from his finger the ring which the palmer had brought to him [217], and murmured scarce audibly:  \"Be this kept in the House of St. Peter in memory of me!\"  \"He is alive now to us--speak--\" whispered more than one thegn, one abbot, to Alred and to Stigand.  And Stigand, as the harder and more worldly man of the two, moved up, and bending over the pillow, between Alred and the King, said:  \"O royal son, about to win the crown to which that of earth is but an idiot's wreath of withered leaves, not yet may thy soul forsake us. Whom commendest thou to us as shepherd to thy bereaven flock? whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below?\"  The King made a slight gesture of impatience; and the Queen, forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow, raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed.  But the stake was too weighty, the suspense too keen, for that reverent delicacy in those around; and the thegns pressed on each other, and a murmur rose, which murmured the name of Harold.  \"Bethink thee, my son,\" said Alred, in a tender voice tremulous with emotion; \"the young Atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times.\"  Edward signed his head in assent.  \"Then,\" said the Norman bishop of London, who till that moment had stood in the rear, almost forgotten amongst the crowd of Saxon prelates, but who himself had been all eyes and ears.  \"Then,\" said Bishop William, advancing, \"if thine own royal line so fail, who so near to thy love, who so worthy to succeed, as William thy cousin, the Count of the Normans?\"  Dark was the scowl on the brow of every thegn, and a muttered \"No, no: never the Norman!\" was heard distinctly.  Harold's face flushed, and his hand was on the hilt of his ateghar.  But no other sign gave he of his interest in the question.  The King lay for some moments silent, but evidently striving to re- collect his thoughts.  Meanwhile the two archprelates bent over him-- Stigand eagerly, Alred fondly.  Then raising himself on one arm, while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed, the King said:  \"Your hearts, I see, are with Harold the Earl: so be it.\"  At those words he fell back on his pillow; a loud shriek burst from his wife's lips; all crowded around; he lay as the dead.  At the cry, and the indescribable movement of the throng, the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall.  He made his way abruptly to the bedside, and said chidingly, \"Air, give him air.\"  The throng parted, the leach moistened the King's pale lips with the cordial, but no breath seemed to come forth, no pulse seemed to beat; and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood, the rest descended the dais, and hastened to depart. Harold only remained; but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed.  The crowd had gained the centre of the hall, when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave, chained every footstep--the sound of the King's voice, loud, terribly distinct, and full, as with the vigour of youth restored.  All turned their eyes, appalled; all stood spell-bound.  There sate the King upright on the bed, his face seen above the kneeling prelates, and his eyes bright and shining down the Hall.  \"Yea,\" he said, deliberately, \"yea, as this shall be a real vision or a false illusion, grant me, Almighty One, the power of speech to tell it.\"  He paused a moment, and thus resumed:  \"It was on the banks of the frozen Seine, this day thirty-and-one winters ago, that two holy monks, to whom the gift of prophecy was vouchsafed, told me of direful woes that should fall on England; 'For God,' said they, 'after thy death, has delivered England into the hand of the enemy, and fiends shall wander over the land.'  Then I asked in my sorrow, 'Can nought avert the doom? and may not my people free themselves by repentance, like the Ninevites of old?'  And the Prophets answered, 'Nay, nor shall the calamity cease, and the curse be completed, till a green tree be sundered in twain, and the part cut off be carried away; yet move, of itself, to the ancient trunk, unite to the stem, bud out with the blossom, and stretch forth its fruit.' So said the monks, and even now, ere I spoke, I saw them again, there, standing mute, and with the paleness of dead men, by the side of my bed!\"  These words were said so calmly, and as it were so rationally, that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone. A shudder passed through the assembly, and each man shrunk from the King's eye, which seemed to each man to dwell on himself.  Suddenly that eye altered in its cold beam; suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent; the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect, the whole face to work with horror; the arms stretched forth, the form writhed on the couch, distorted fragments from the lips: \"Sanguelac! Sanguelac!--the Lake of Blood,\" shrieked forth the dying King, \"the Lord hath bent his bow--the Lord hath bared his sword.  He comes down as a warrior to war, and his wrath is in the steel and the flame.  He boweth the mountains, and comes down, and darkness is under his feet!\"  As if revived but for these tremendous denunciations, while the last word left his lips the frame collapsed, the eyes set, and the King fell a corpse in the arms of Harold.  But one smile of the sceptic or the world-man was seen on the paling lips of those present: that smile was not on the lips of warriors and men of mail.  It distorted the"]]]
