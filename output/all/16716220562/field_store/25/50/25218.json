[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7353"],["title","Birds in Town & Village (#8)"],["body","my bird through a white and rose-tinted cloud of apple-blossoms; and when I left some species that breed more than once in the season were rearing second broods or engaged in making new nests. On my very first day I discovered a nest full of fully fledged blue tits in a hole in an apple tree; this struck me as a dangerous place for the young birds; as the tree leaned over towards the lane, and the hole could almost be reached by a person standing on the ground. On the next day I went to look at them, and approaching noiselessly along the lane, spied two small boys with bright clean faces--it was on a Sunday--standing within three or four yards of the tree, watching the tits with intense interest. The parent birds were darting up and down, careless of their presence, finding food so quickly in the gooseberry bushes growing near the roots of the tree that they visited the hole every few moments; while the young birds, ever screaming for more, were gathered in a dense little cluster at the entrance, their yellow breasts showing very brightly against the rain-wet wood and the dark interior of the hole. The instant the two little watchers caught sight of me the excited look vanished from their faces, and they began to move off, gazing straight ahead in a somewhat vacant manner. This instantaneous and instinctive display of hypocrisy was highly entertaining, and would have made me laugh if it had not been for the serious purpose I had in my mind. \"Now, look here,\" I said, \"I know what you are after, so it's no use pretending that you are walking about and seeing nothing in particular. You've been watching the young tits. Well, I've been watching them, too, and waiting to see them fly. I dare say they will be out by to-morrow or the next day, and I hope you little fellows won't try to drag them out before then.\"  They at once protested that they had no such intention. They said that they never robbed birds' nests; that there were several nests at home in the garden and orchard, one of a nightingale with three eggs in it, but that they never took an egg. But some of the boys they knew, they said, took all the eggs they found; and there was one boy who got into every orchard and garden in the place, who was so sharp that few nests escaped him, and every nest he found he destroyed, breaking the eggs if there were any, and if there were young birds killing them.  Not, perhaps, without first mutilating them, I thought; for I know something of this kind of young \"human devil,\" to use the phrase which Canon Wilberforce has made so famous in another connexion. Later on I heard much more about the exploits of this champion bird-destroyer of the village from (strange to say) a bird-catcher by trade, a man of a rather low type of countenance, and who lived, when at home, in a London slum. On the common where he spread his nets he had found, he told me, about thirty nests containing eggs or fledglings; but this boy had gone over the ground after him, and not many of the nests had escaped his sharp eyes.  I was satisfied that the young tits were quite safe, so far as these youngsters were concerned, and only regretted that they were such small Boys, and that the great nest-destroyer, whose evil deeds they spoke of with an angry colour in their cheeks, was a very strong boy, otherwise I should have advised them to \"go\" for him.  Oddly enough I heard of another boy who exercised the same kind of cruelty and destructiveness over another common a few miles distant. Walking across it I spied two boys among the furze bushes, and at the same moment they saw me, whereupon one ran away and the other remained standing. A nice little fellow of about eight, he looked as if he had been crying. I asked him what it was all about, and he then told me that the bigger boy who had just run away was always on the common searching for nests, just to destroy them and kill the young birds; that he, my informant, had come there where he came every day just to have a peep at a linnet's nest with four eggs in it on which the bird was sitting; that the other boy, concealed among the bushes had watched him go to the nest and had then rushed up and pulled the nest out of the bush.  \"Why didn't you knock him down?\" I asked.  \"That's what I tried to do before he pulled the nest out,\" he said; and then he added sorrowfully: \"He knocked me down.\"  I am reminded here of a tale of ancient Greece about a boy of this description--the boy to be found in pretty well every parish in the land. This was a shepherd boy who followed or led his sheep to a distance from the village and amused his idle hours by snaring small birds to put their eyes out with a sharp thorn, then to toss them up just to see how, and how far, they would fly in the dark. He was seen doing it and the matter reported to the heads or fathers of the village, and he was brought before them and, after due consideration of the case, condemned to death. Such a decision must seem shocking to us and worthy of a semi-barbarous people. But if cruelty is the worst of all offences--and this was cruelty in its most horrid form--the offence which puts men down on a level with the worst of the mythical demons, it was surely a righteous deed to blot such an existence out lest other young minds should be contaminated, or even that it should be known that such a crime was possible.  * * *  All those birds that had finished rearing their young by the sixteenth of June were fortunate, for on the morning of that day a great and continuous shouting, with gun-firing, banging on old brass and iron utensils, with various other loud, unusual noises, were heard at one extremity of the village, and continued with occasional quiet intervals until evening. This tempest of rude sounds spread from day to day, until the entire area of the village and the surrounding orchards was involved, and the poor birds that were tied to the spots where their treasures were, must have existed in a state of constant trepidation. For now the cherries were fast ripening, and the fruit-eating birds, especially the thrushes and black-birds, were inflamed at the gleam of crimson colour among the leaves. In the very large orchards men and boys were stationed all day long yelling and firing off guns to frighten the marauders. In the smaller orchards the trees were decorated with whirligigs of coloured paper; ancient hats, among which were some of the quaintly-shaped chimney-pots of a past generation; old coats and waistcoats and trousers, and rags of all colours to flutter in the wind; and these objects were usually considered a sufficient protection. Some of the birds, wiser than their fellows, were not to be kept back by such simple means; but so long as they came not in battalions, but singly, they could have their fill, and no notice was taken of them.  I was surprised to hear that on the large plantations the men employed were not allowed to use shot, the aim of the fruit grower being only to scare the birds away. I had a talk with my old friend of the wryneck on the subject, and told him that I had seen one of the bird-scarers going home to his cottage very early in the morning, carrying a bunch of about a dozen blackbirds and thrushes he had just shot.  Yes, he replied, some of the men would buy shot and use it early in the morning before their master was about; but if the man I had seen had been detected in the act, he would have been discharged on the spot. It was not only because the trees would be injured by shot, but this fruitgrower was friendly to birds.  Most fruit-growers, I said, were dead against the birds, and anxious only to kill as many of them as possible.  It might be so in some places, he answered, but not in the village. He himself and most of the villagers depended, in a great measure, on the fruit they produced for a living, and their belief was that, taking one bird with another all the year round, the birds did them more good than harm.  I then imparted to him the views on this bird subject of a well-known fruit-grower in the north of England, Mr. Joseph Witherspoon, of Chester-le-Street. He began by persecuting the birds, as he had been taught to do by his father, a market-gardener; but after years of careful observation he completely changed his views, and is now so convinced of the advantage that birds are to the fruit-grower, that he does all in his power to attract them, and to tempt them to breed in his grounds. His main idea is that birds that are fed on the premises, that live and feed among the trees, search for and attack the gardeners' enemies at every stage of their existence. At the same time he believes that it is very bad to grow fruit near woods, as in such a case the birds that live in the woods and are of no advantage to the garden, swarm into it as the fruit ripens, and that it is only by liberal use of nets that any reasonable portion of the fruit can be saved.  He answered that with regard to the last point he did not quite agree with Mr. Witherspoon. All the gardens and orchards in the village were raided by the birds from the wood, yet he reckoned they got as much fruit from their trees as others who had no woods near them. Then there was the big cherry plantation, one of the biggest in England, so that people came from all parts in the blossoming time just to look at it, and a wonderful sight it was. For a quarter of a mile this particular orchard ran parallel with the wood; with nothing but the green road between, and when the first fruit was ripening you could see all the big trees on the edge of the wood swarming with birds--jays, thrushes, blackbirds, doves, and all sorts of tits and little birds, just waiting for a chance to pounce down and devour the cherries. The noise kept them off, but many would dodge in, and even if a gun was fired close to them the blackbirds would snatch a cherry and carry it off to the wood. That didn't matter--a few cherries here and there didn't count.

You're a Wolf yourself, Ned Nestor!\"  \"Two Wolves, then!\" laughed Ned. \"Of course Jimmie and I can form a club all by ourselves, and he can be the officers and I can be the members, but we'd rather have a menagerie of large size, as we are going into the mountains of Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee.\"  The boys who had not yet spoken were on their feet in an instant, all clamoring for membership in the Boy Scout Camera Club. Ned lifted a hand for silence.  \"Why this present rush?\" he asked. \"I've been thinking that Jimmie and I would have to go to the mountains alone! Why this impetuosity?\"  \"The mountains!\" shouted Frank Shaw, of the Black Bear Patrol. \"It is the mountains that get us! We've been thinking that the club you were organizing wouldn't get outside of little old New York, but would loaf around taking snap-shots of the slums and the trees in the parks. But when you mention mountains, why--\"  \"I'm going right down stairs and pack my camera!\" Jack Bosworth, of the Black Bear Patrol, declared. \"When it comes to mountains!\"  The clubroom of the Black Bear Patrol was on the top floor of the handsome residence of Jack's father, who was a famous corporation lawyer, and the boys persuaded Jack to wait until they had completed the organization of the Camera Club before he started in packing for the journey to the mountains!  \"You'll want an Eagle, if you're going to the mountains!\" shouted Teddy Green, of the Eagle Patrol. \"I'll fly home and get my wardrobe right now!\"  Teddy Green was the son of a Harvard professor, and was inclined to follow in the footsteps of his father in the matter of learning--after he had first climbed to all the high spots of the world and descended into all the low ones! He insisted on exploring the earth before he learned by rote what others had written about it!  \"All right!\" Ned grinned. \"We'll need an Eagle!\"  \"And a Bull Moose!\" yelled Oliver Yentsch, of the Moose Patrol. \"You've got to have a Moose along with you!\"  Oliver was the son of a ship builder, and had a launch and a yacht of his own. He was liked by all his associates in spite of his tendency to grumble at trifles. However, if he complained at small things, he met large troubles with a smile on his bright face. He now seized Teddy about the waist and waltzed around the room with him.  \"And that's all!\" Ned decided, closing the book. \"We can't take more than six.\"  A wail went up from the others, but they were promised a chance at the next \"hike\" into the hills, and soon departed, leaving the six members of the Camera Club to perfect arrangements for their departure. It was a warm May night, still Ned closed the door leading out into the wide corridor which ran through the house on that floor.  \"We can't afford to take others into our plans,\" he said, \"for this is to be another Secret Service expedition.\"  \"For the Government?\" demanded Frank Shaw. \"Then,\" he added, without waiting for a reply, \"I'll call up dad's editorial rooms and have a reporter sent up here. Top of column, first page, illustrated! That's our Camera Club in the morning newspaper!\"  Frank's father was owner and editor of one of the big New York dailies, and the boy always took along, on his trips, plenty of blank paper for \"copy,\" but never sent in a line! His letters to his father's newspaper were usually addressed to the financial department, upon which he had permission to draw at will!  \"Huh!\" Jimmie commented, wrinkling his freckled nose, \"if you should ever furnish an item for your daddy's newspaper he'd never live it down! You've been on all our trips with Ned, and never wired in a word!\"  The Boy Scouts of the Black Bear and Wolf Patrols had been through many exciting experiences with Ned Nestor, who, young as he was, was often in the employ of the Secret Service department of the United States government. Frank, as Jimmie said, had been with Ned from the start, and had never sent in a line of \"copy\" for the paper.  \"I'm going to furnish a column a day this trip!\" Frank declared, making a motion to seize Jimmie. \"We're going to take pictures, aren't we? We'll take 'em by the acre, and dad's newspaper is going to catch every one of them.\"  \"Huh!\" Jimmie declared, with a freckled nose in the air. \"I'm a newspaper man, too. You needn't think you're the only cherry in the pie! I used to sell newspapers before I got into the Secret Service with Ned!\"  From his earliest years Jimmie had indeed been a newsboy on the Bowery. He had never had a home except that provided by himself, and this, in the early days of his life, had as often been a box or barrel in an alley as anything else.  \"Why the mountains?\" asked Frank Shaw, presently. \"Do you have to go to the hills on this trip? I'm glad if you do, of course, but I'd like to know something about it before we start. Dad will have to be shown this time, I reckon! He thinks we rather _overdid_ the stunt when we went to Lady Franklin bay!\"  \"Never had so much fun in my life!\" laughed Jimmie. \"When you get where it is forty below, there's some delight in living!\"  \"What are we going to take pictures of?\" demanded Teddy Green.  \"Moonshiners!\" laughed Frank. \"Isn't that right, Ned?\"  \"Not exactly,\" was the answer. \"This is not a whisky case at all.\"  \"Counterfeiters, then?\" queried Oliver. \"They live in the hills!\"  \"No, not counterfeiters, either,\" Ned replied. \"The government has plenty of men to look after counterfeiters and moonshiners. All we've got to do is to go into the mountains and take pictures, and keep our eyes open.\"  \"Open for what?\" insisted Jimmie. \"My peepers will be open for a venison steak about the first thing! You remember how fine the venison steaks were up in British Columbia? That Columbia river trip was some exciting! What?\"  \"Well,\" Ned began, \"you all know that I'm in the Secret Service, for you've been with me, some of you, at Panama, in China, and under the ocean, so we'll let the details go without explanation. I'm going to the mountains to look after a precious package stolen from Washington--from almost under the eyes of the president--three days ago!\"  \"Papers?\" asked Jimmie. \"You know we went to Lady Franklin bay after papers.\"  \"And they think the mountaineers stole this package?\" asked Oliver.  \"Tell us what it was that was taken first!\" insisted Frank. \"I'm beginning to see a front-page story in this, right now!\"  \"The package stolen,\" Ned went on, with a smile, \"was more precious than any bundle of papers could be! It wasn't of gold, silver, diamonds, or anything possessing that kind of value. It was of flesh and blood!\"  \"A child stolen!\" cried Frank. \"This goes to dad's sheet right now!\"  \"Boy or girl?\" asked Oliver. \"Age, please!\"  \"Boy,\" answered Ned. \"A boy belonging to one of the ambassadors! Age seven!\"  \"But why should the mountaineers steal such a child?\" asked Jimmie.  \"I said the boy belonged to one of the ambassadors,\" Ned corrected himself. \"I should have said he belonged at one of the foreign embassies.\"  \"The son of one of the attaches?\" asked Teddy. \"That's strange! Why?\"  \"Teddy,\" reproved Jimmie, \"you can ask more questions in a minute than a motion picture machine can take in a hundred years.\"  \"The stolen boy is in no ways related to any one in this country,\" Ned answered, \"yet his safety is of the utmost importance. It is up to us to find him.\"  \"But why should the mountain men make a grab at a kid?\" insisted Jimmie. \"I've asked that question numerous times now,\" he added, with a wrinkled nose.  \"It is not believed that the mountain men know anything about the matter,\" Ned replied. \"No one suspects them of taking the child. Mountain men are not up to that sort of thing, as a rule. They will make moonshine--some of them will--and may hide a counterfeiter, but they don't steal children!\"  \"Then who did steal him?\" asked Frank. \"Don't be so mysterious.\"  \"I want the matter to sink deep into your alleged minds!\" was Ned's smiling rejoinder, \"and that is the reason I'm drawing the explanation out. It is thought the boy was stolen by some one who came over the sea to do the job--some one never before in this country.\"  \"I twig!\" Jimmie declared, skipping about the room. \"The stolen boy is next of succession to some measly old throne!"]]]
