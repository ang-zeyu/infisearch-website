And on this space William reviewed his army, and there planned and schemed, rehearsed and re-formed, all the stratagems the great day might call forth.  But more careful, and laborious, and minute, was he in the manoeuvre of a feigned retreat.  Not ere the acting of some modern play, does the anxious manager more elaborately marshal each man, each look, each gesture, that are to form a picture on which the curtain shall fall amidst deafening plaudits than did the laborious captain appoint each man, and each movement, in his lure to a valiant foe:--The attack of the foot, their recoil, their affected panic, their broken exclamations of despair;--their retreat, first partial and reluctant, next seemingly hurried and complete,--flying, but in flight carefully confused:--then the settled watchword, the lightning rally, the rush of the cavalry from the ambush; the sweep and hem round the pursuing foe, the detachment of levelled spears to cut off the Saxon return to the main force, and the lost ground,--were all directed by the most consummate mastership in the stage play, or upokrisis, of war, and seized by the adroitness of practised veterans.  Not now, O Harold! hast thou to contend against the rude heroes of the Norse, with their ancestral strategy unimproved!  The civilisation of Battle meets thee now!--and all the craft of the Roman guides the manhood of the North.  It was in the midst of such lessons to his foot and his horsemen-- spears gleaming--pennons tossing--lines reforming--steeds backing, wheeling, flying, circling--that William's eye blazed, and his deep voice thundered the thrilling word; when Mallet de Graville, who was in command at one of the outposts, rode up to him at full speed, and said in gasps, as he drew breath:  \"King Harold and his army are advancing furiously.  Their object is clearly to come on us unawares.\"  \"Hold!\" said the Duke, lifting his hand; and the knights around him halted in their perfect discipline; then after a few brief but distinct orders to Odo, Fitzosborne, and some other of his leading chiefs, he headed a numerous cavalcade of his knights, and rode fast to the outpost which Mallet had left,--to catch sight of the coming foe.  The horsemen cleared the plain--passed through a wood, mournfully fading into autumnal hues--and, on emerging, they saw the gleam of the Saxon spears rising on the brows of the gentle hills beyond.  But even the time, short as it was, that had sufficed to bring William in view of the enemy, had sufficed also, under the orders of his generals, to give to the wide plain of his encampment all the order of a host prepared.  And William, having now mounted on a rising ground, turned from the spears on the hill tops, to his own fast forming lines on the plain, and said with a stern smile:  \"Methinks the Saxon usurper, if he be among those on the height of yon hills, will vouchsafe us time to breathe!  St. Michael gives his crown to our hands, and his corpse to the crow, if he dare to descend.\"  And so indeed, as the Duke with a soldier's eye foresaw from a soldier's skill, so it proved.  The spears rested on the summits.  It soon became evident that the English general perceived that here there was no Hardrada to surprise; that the news brought to his ear had exaggerated neither the numbers, nor the arms, nor the discipline of the Norman; and that the battle was not to the bold but to the wary.  \"He doth right,\" said William, musingly; \"nor think, O my Quens, that we shall find a fool's hot brain under Harold's helmet of iron.  How is this broken ground of hillock and valley named in our chart?  It is strange that we should have overlooked its strength, and suffered it thus to fall into the hands of the foe.  How is it named?  Can any of ye remember?\"  \"A Saxon peasant,\" said De Graville, \"told me that the ground was called Senlac [256] or Sanglac, or some such name, in their musicless jargon.\"  \"Grammercy!\" quoth Grantmesnil, \"methinks the name will be familiar eno' hereafter; no jargon seemeth the sound to my ear--a significant name and ominous,--Sanglac, Sanguelac--the Lake of Blood.\"  \"Sanguelac!\" said the Duke, startled; \"where have I heard that name before? it must have been between sleeping and waking.--Sanguelac, Sanguelac!--truly sayest thou, through a lake of blood we must wade indeed!\"  \"Yet,\" said De Graville, \"thine astrologer foretold that thou wouldst win the realm without a battle.\"  \"Poor astrologer!\" said William, \"the ship he sailed in was lost. Ass indeed is he who pretends to warn others, nor sees an inch before his eyes what his own fate will be!  Battle shall we have, but not yet. Hark thee, Guillaume, thou hast been guest with this usurper; thou hast seemed to me to have some love for him--a love natural since thou didst once fight by his side; wilt thou go from me to the Saxon host with Hugues Maigrot, the monk, and back the message I shall send?\"  The proud and punctilious Norman thrice crossed himself ere he answered:  \"There was a time, Count William, when I should have deemed it honour to hold parle with Harold the brave Earl; but now, with the crown on his head, I hold it shame and disgrace to barter words with a knight unleal and a man foresworn.\"  \"Nathless, thou shalt do me this favour,\" said William, \"for\" (and he took the knight somewhat aside) \"I cannot disguise from thee that I look anxiously on the chance of battle.  Yon men are flushed with new triumph over the greatest warrior Norway ever knew, they will fight on their own soil, and under a chief whom I have studied and read with more care than the Comments of Caesar, and in whom the guilt of perjury cannot blind me to the wit of a great general.  If we can yet get our end without battle, large shall be my thanks to thee, and I will hold thine astrologer a man wise, though unhappy.\"  \"Certes,\" said De Graville gravely, \"it were discourteous to the memory of the star-seer, not to make some effort to prove his science a just one.  And the Chaldeans----\"  \"Plague seize the Chaldeans!\" muttered the Duke.  \"Ride with me back to the camp, that I may give thee my message, and instruct also the monk.\"  \"De Graville,\" resumed the Duke, as they rode towards the lines, \"my meaning is briefly this.  I do not think that Harold will accept my offer and resign his crown, but I design to spread dismay, and perhaps revolt amongst his captains; I wish that they may know that the Church lays its Curse on those who fight against my consecrated banner.  I do not ask thee, therefore, to demean thy knighthood, by seeking to cajole the usurper; no, but rather boldly to denounce his perjury and startle his liegemen.  Perchance they may compel him to terms-- perchance they may desert his banner; at the worst they shall be daunted with full sense of the guilt of his cause.\"  \"Ha, now I comprehend thee, noble Count; and trust me I will speak as Norman and knight should speak.\"  Meanwhile, Harold seeing the utter hopelessness of all sudden assault, had seized a general's advantage of the ground he had gained. Occupying the line of hills, he began forthwith to entrench himself behind deep ditches and artful palisades.  It is impossible now to stand on that spot, without recognising the military skill with which the Saxon had taken his post, and formed his precautions.  He surrounded the main body of his troops with a perfect breastwork against the charge of the horse.  Stakes and strong hurdles interwoven with osier plaits, and protected by deep dykes, served at once to neutralise the effect of that arm in which William was most powerful, and in which Harold almost entirely failed; while the possession of the ground must compel the foe to march, and to charge, up hill, against all the missiles which the Saxons could pour down from their entrenchments.  Aiding, animating, cheering, directing all, while the dykes were fast hollowed, and the breastworks fast rose, the King of England rode his palfrey from line to line, and work to work, when, looking up, he saw Haco leading towards him up the slopes, a monk, and a warrior whom, by the banderol on his spear and the cross on his shield, he knew to be one of the Norman knighthood.  At that moment Gurth and Leofwine, and those thegns who commanded counties, were thronging round their chief for instructions.  The King dismounted, and beckoning them to follow, strode towards the spot on which had just been planted his royal standard.  There halting, he said with a grave smile:  \"I perceive that the Norman Count hath sent us his bodes; it is meet that with me, you, the defenders of England, should hear what the Norman saith.\"  \"If he saith aught but prayer for his men to return to Rouen,-- needless his message, and short our answer,\" said Vebba, the bluff thegn of Kent.  Meanwhile the monk and the Norman knight drew near and paused at some short distance, while Haco, advancing, said briefly:  \"These men I found at our outposts; they demand to speak with the King.\"  \"Under his standard the King will hear the Norman invader,\" replied Harold; \"bid them speak.\"  The same sallow, mournful, ominous countenance, which Harold had before seen in the halls of Westminster, rising deathlike above the serge garb of the Benedict of Caen, now presented itself, and the monk thus spoke:  \"In the name of William, Duke of the Normans in the field, Count of Rouen in the hall, Claimant of all the realms of Anglia, Scotland, and the Walloons, held under Edward his cousin, I come to thee, Harold his liege and Earl.\"  \"Change thy titles, or depart,\" said Harold, fiercely, his brow no longer mild in its majesty, but dark as midnight.  \"What says William the Count of the Foreigners, to Harold, King of the Angles, and Basileus of Britain?\"  \"Protesting against thy assumption, I answer thee thus,\" said Hugues Maigrot.  \"First, again he offers thee all Northumbria, up to the realm of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7683"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 12 (#5)"],["body"," sub-king, if thou wilt fulfil thy vow, and cede him the crown.\"  \"Already have I answered,--the crown is not mine to give; and my people stand round me in arms to defend the king of their choice. What next?\"  \"Next, offers William to withdraw his troops from the land, if thou and thy council and chiefs will submit to the arbitrement of our most holy Pontiff, Alexander the Second, and, abide by his decision whether thou or my liege have the best right to the throne.\"  \"This, as Churchman,\" said the Abbot of the great Convent of Peterboro', (who, with the Abbot of Hide, had joined the march of Harold, deeming as one the cause of altar and throne), \"this as Churchman, may I take leave to answer.  Never yet hath it been heard in England, that the spiritual suzerain of Rome should give us our kings.\"  \"And,\" said Harold, with a bitter smile, \"the Pope hath already summoned me to this trial, as if the laws of England were kept in the rolls of the Vatican!  Already, if rightly informed, the Pope hath been pleased to decide that our Saxon land is the Norman's.  I reject a judge without a right to decide; and I mock at a sentence that profanes heaven in its insult to men.  Is this all?\"  \"One last offer yet remains,\" replied the monk sternly.  \"This knight shall deliver its import.  But ere I depart, and thou and thine are rendered up to Vengeance Divine, I speak the words of a mightier chief than William of Rouen.  Thus saith his Holiness, with whom rests the power to bind and to loose, to bless and to curse: 'Harold, the Perjurer, thou art accursed!  On thee and on all who lift hand in thy cause, rests the interdict of the Church.  Thou art excommunicated from the family of Christ.  On thy land, with its peers and its people, yea, to the beast in the field and the bird in the air, to the seed as the sower, the harvest as the reaper, rests God's anathema! The bull of the Vatican is in the tent of the Norman; the gonfanon of St. Peter hallows yon armies to the service of Heaven.  March on, then: ye march as the Assyrian; and the angel of the Lord awaits ye on the way!'\"  At these words, which for the first time apprised the English leaders that their king and kingdom were under the awful ban of excommunication, the thegns and abbots gazed on each other aghast. A visible shudder passed over the whole warlike conclave, save only three, Harold, and Gurth, and Haco.  The King himself was so moved by indignation at the insolence of the monk, and by scorn at the fulmen, which, resting not alone on his own head, presumed to blast the liberties of a nation, that he strode towards the speaker, and it is even said of him by the Norman chroniclers, that he raised his hand as if to strike the denouncer to the earth.  But Gurth interposed, and with his clear eye serenely shining with virtuous passion, he stood betwixt monk and king.  \"O thou,\" he exclaimed, \"with the words of religion on thy lips, and the devices of fraud in thy heart, hide thy front in thy cowl, and slink back to thy master.  Heard ye not, thegns and abbots, heard ye not this bad, false man offer, as if for peace, and as with the desire of justice, that the Pope should arbitrate between your King and the Norman? yet all the while the monk knew that the Pope had already predetermined the cause; and had ye fallen into the wile, ye would but have cowered under the verdict of a judgment that has presumed, even before it invoked ye to the trial, to dispose of a free people and an ancient kingdom!\"  \"It is true, it is true,\" cried the thegns, rallying from their first superstitious terror, and, with their plain English sense of justice, revolted at the perfidy which the priest's overtures had concealed. \"We will hear no more; away with the Swikebode.\" [257]  The pale cheek of the monk turned yet paler, he seemed abashed by the storm of resentment he had provoked; and in some fear, perhaps, at the dark faces bent on him, he slunk behind his comrade the knight, who as yet had said nothing, but, his face concealed by his helmet, stood motionless like a steel statue.  And, in fact, these two ambassadors, the one in his monk garb, the other in his iron array, were types and representatives of the two forces now brought to bear upon Harold and England--Chivalry and the Church.  At the momentary discomfiture of the Priest, now stood forth the Warrior; and, throwing back his helmet, so that the whole steel cap rested on the nape of the neck, leaving the haughty face and half- shaven head bare, Mallet de Graville thus spoke:  \"The ban of the Church is against ye, warriors and chiefs of England, but for the crime of one man!  Remove it from yourselves: on his single head be the curse and the consequence.  Harold, called King of England--failing the two milder offers of my comrade, thus saith from the lips of his knight, (once thy guest, thy admirer, and friend,) thus saith William the Norman:--'Though sixty thousand warriors under the banner of the Apostle wait at his beck, (and from what I see of thy force, thou canst marshal to thy guilty side scarce a third of the number,) yet will Count William lay aside all advantage, save what dwells in strong arm and good cause; and here, in presence of thy thegns, I challenge thee in his name to decide the sway of this realm by single battle.  On horse and in mail, with sword and with spear, knight to knight, man to man, wilt thou meet William the Norman?'\"  Before Harold could reply, and listen to the first impulse of a valour, which his worst Norman maligner, in the after day of triumphant calumny, never so lied as to impugn, the thegns themselves almost with one voice, took up the reply.  \"No strife between a man and a man shall decide the liberties of thousands!\"  \"Never!\" exclaimed Gurth.  \"It were an insult to the whole people to regard this as a strife between two chiefs, which should wear a crown. When the invader is in our land, the war is with a nation, not a king. And, by the very offer, this Norman Count (who cannot even speak our tongue) shows how little he knows of the laws, by which, under our native kings, we have all as great an interest as a king himself in our Fatherland.\"  \"Thou hast heard the answer of England from those lips, Sire de Graville,\" said Harold: \"mine but repeat and sanction it.  I will not give the crown to William in lieu for disgrace and an earldom.  I will not abide by the arbitrement of a Pope who has dared to affix a curse upon freedom.  I will not so violate the principle which in these realms knits king and people, as to arrogate to my single arm the right to dispose of the birthright of the living, and their races unborn; nor will I deprive the meanest soldier under my banner, of the joy and the glory to fight for his native land.  If William seek me, he shall find me, where war is the fiercest, where the corpses of his men lie the thickest on the plains, defending this standard, or rushing on his own.  And so, not Monk and Pope, but God in his wisdom, adjudge between us!\"  \"So be it,\" said Mallet de Graville, solemnly, and his helmet re- closed over his face.  \"Look to it, recreant knight, perjured Christian, and usurping King!  The bones of the Dead fight against thee.\"  \"And the fleshless hands of the Saints marshal the hosts of the living,\" said the monk.  And so the messengers turned, without obeisance or salute, and strode silently away.     CHAPTER VI.   The rest of that day, and the whole of the next, were consumed by both armaments in the completion of their preparations.  William was willing to delay the engagement as long as he could; for he was not without hope that Harold might abandon his formidable position, and become the assailing party; and, moreover, he wished to have full time for his prelates and priests to inflame to the utmost, by their representations of William's moderation in his embassy, and Harold's presumptuous guilt in rejection, the fiery fanaticism of all enlisted under the gonfanon of the Church.  On the other hand, every delay was of advantage to Harold, in giving him leisure to render his entrenchments yet more effectual, and to allow time for such reinforcements as his orders had enjoined, or the patriotism of the country might arouse; but, alas! those reinforcements were scanty and insignificant; a few stragglers in the immediate neighborhood arrived, but no aid came from London, no indignant country poured forth a swarming population.  In fact, the very fame of Harold, and the good fortune that had hitherto attended his arms, contributed to the stupid lethargy of the people.  That he who had just subdued the terrible Norsemen, with the mighty Hardrada at their head, should succumb to those dainty \"Frenchmen,\" as they chose to call the Normans; of whom, in their insular ignorance of the continent, they knew but little, and whom they had seen flying in all directions at the return of Godwin; was a preposterous demand on the imagination.  Nor was this all: in London, there had already formed a cabal in favour of the Atheling.  The claims of birth can never be so wholly set aside, but what, even for the most unworthy heir of an ancient line, some adherents will be found.  The prudent traders thought it best not to engage actively on behalf of the reigning King, in his present combat with the Norman pretender; a large number of would-be statesmen thought it best for the country to remain for the present neutral.  Grant the worst--grant that Harold were defeated or slain; would it not be wise to reserve their strength to support the Atheling?  William might have some personal cause of quarrel against Harold, but he could have none against Edgar; he might depose the son of Godwin, but could he dare to depose the descendant of Cerdic, the natural heir of Edward?  There is reason to think that Stigand, and a large party of the Saxon Churchmen, headed this faction.  But the main causes for defection were not in adherence to one chief or to another.  They were to be"]]]
