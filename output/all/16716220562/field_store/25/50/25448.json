If I take but one false step in this matter, woe indeed to thy lord!  Guy is hot and haughty, and in his droits; he is capable of sending me the Earl's head in reply to too dure a request for his freedom.  Much treasure and broad lands will it cost me, I fear, to ransom the Earl. But be cheered; half my duchy were not too high a price for thy lord's safety.  Go, then, and eat with a good heart, and drink to the Earl's health with a hopeful prayer.\"  \"And it please you, my lord,\" said De Graville, \"I know this gentle thegn, and will beg of you the grace to see to his entertainment, and sustain his spirits.\"  \"Thou shalt, but later; so noble a guest none but my chief seneschal should be the first to honour.\"  Then turning to the officer in waiting, he bade him lead the Saxon to the chamber tenanted by William Fitzosborne (who then lodged within the palace), and committed him to that Count's care.  As the Saxon sullenly withdrew, and as the door closed on him, William rose and strode to and fro the room exultingly.  \"I have him! I have him!\" he cried aloud; \"not as free guest, but as ransomed captive.  I have him--the Earl!--I have him!  Go, Mallet, my friend, now seek this sour-looking Englishman; and, hark thee! fill his ear with all the tales thou canst think of as to Guy's cruelty and ire.  Enforce all the difficulties that lie in my way towards the Earl's delivery.  Great make the danger of the Earl's capture, and vast all the favour of release.  Comprehendest thou?\"  \"I am Norman, Monseigneur,\" replied De Graville, with a slight smile; \"and we Normans can make a short mantle cover a large space.  You will not be displeased with my address.\"  \"Go then--go,\" said William, \"and send me forthwith--Lanfranc--no, hold--not Lanfranc, he is too scrupulous; Fitzosborne--no, too haughty.  Go, first, to my brother, Odo of Bayeux, and pray him to seek me on the instant.\"  The knight bowed and vanished, and William continued to pace the room, with sparkling eyes and murmuring lips.     CHAPTER II.   Not till after repeated messages, at first without talk of ransom and in high tone, affected, no doubt, by William to spin out the negotiations, and augment the value of his services, did Guy of Ponthieu consent to release his illustrious captive,--the guerdon, a large sum and un bel maneir [189] on the river Eaulne.  But whether that guerdon were the fair ransom fee, or the price for concerted snare, no man now can say, and sharper than ours the wit that forms the more likely guess.  These stipulations effected, Guy himself opened the doors of the dungeon; and affecting to treat the whole matter as one of law and right, now happily and fairly settled, was as courteous and debonnair as he had before been dark and menacing.  He even himself, with a brilliant train, accompanied Harold to the Chateau d'Eu [190], whither William journeyed to give him the meeting; and laughed with a gay grace at the Earl's short and scornful replies to his compliments and excuses.  At the gates of this chateau, not famous, in after times, for the good faith of its lords, William himself, laying aside all the pride of etiquette which he had established at his court, came to receive his visitor; and aiding him to dismount embraced him cordially, amidst a loud fanfaron of fifes and trumpets.  The flower of that glorious nobility, which a few generations had sufficed to rear out of the lawless pirates of the Baltic, had been selected to do honour alike to guest and host.  There were Hugo de Montfort and Roger de Beaumont, famous in council as in the field, and already grey with fame.  There was Henri, Sire de Ferrers, whose name is supposed to have arisen from the vast forges that burned around his castle, on the anvils of which were welded the arms impenetrable in every field.  There was Raoul de Tancarville, the old tutor of William, hereditary Chamberlain of the Norman Counts; and Geoffroi de Mandeville, and Tonstain the Fair, whose name still preserved, amidst the general corruption of appellations, the evidence of his Danish birth; and Hugo de Grantmesnil, lately returned from exile; and Humphrey de Bohun, whose old castle in Carcutan may yet be seen; and St. John, and Lacie, and D'Aincourt, of broad lands between the Maine and the Oise; and William de Montfichet, and Roger, nicknamed \"Bigod,\" and Roger de Mortemer; and many more, whose fame lives in another land than that of Neustria!  There, too, were the chief prelates and abbots of a church that since William's accession had risen into repute with Rome and with Learning, unequalled on this side the Alps; their white aubes over their gorgeous robes; Lanfranc, and the Bishop of Coutance, and the Abbot of Bec, and foremost of all in rank, but not in learning, Odo of Bayeux.  So great the assemblage of Quens and prelates, that there was small room in the courtyard for the lesser knights and chiefs, who yet hustled each other, with loss of Norman dignity, for a sight of the lion which guarded England.  And still, amidst all those men of mark and might, Harold, simple and calm, looked as he had looked on his war-ship in the Thames, the man who could lead them all!  From those, indeed, who were fortunate enough to see him as he passed up by the side of William, as tall as the Duke, and no less erect--of far slighter bulk, but with a strength almost equal, to a practised eye, in his compacter symmetry and more supple grace,--from those who saw him thus, an admiring murmur rose; for no men in the world so valued and cultivated personal advantages as the Norman knighthood.  Conversing easily with Harold, and well watching him while he conversed, the Duke led his guest into a private chamber in the third floor [191] of the castle, and in that chamber were Haco and Wolnoth.  \"This, I trust, is no surprise to you,\" said the Duke, smiling; \"and now I shall but mar your commune.\"  So saying, he left the room, and Wolnoth rushed to his brother's arms, while Haco, more timidly, drew near and touched the Earl's robe.  As soon as the first joy of the meeting was over, the Earl said to Haco, whom he had drawn to his breast with an embrace as fond as that bestowed on Wolnoth:  \"Remembering thee a boy, I came to say to thee, 'Be my son;' but seeing thee a man, I change the prayer;--supply thy father's place, and be my brother!  And thou, Wolnoth, hast thou kept thy word to me? Norman is thy garb, in truth; is thy heart still English?\"  \"Hist!\" whispered Haco; \"hist!  We have a proverb, that walls have ears.\"  \"But Norman walls can hardly understand our broad Saxon of Kent, I trust,\" said Harold, smiling, though with a shade on his brow.  \"True; continue to speak Saxon,\" said Haco, \"and we are safe.\"  \"Safe!\" echoed Harold.  \"Haco's fears are childish, my brother,\" said Wolnoth, \"and he wrongs the Duke.\"  \"Not the Duke, but the policy which surrounds him like an atmosphere,\" exclaimed Haco.  \"Oh, Harold, generous indeed wert thou to come hither for thy kinsfolk--generous!  But for England's weal, better that we had rotted out our lives in exile, ere thou, hope and prop of England, set foot in these webs of wile.\"  \"Tut!\" said Wolnoth, impatiently; \"good is it for England that the Norman and Saxon should be friends.\"  Harold, who had lived to grow as wise in men's hearts as his father, save when the natural trustfulness that lay under his calm reserve lulled his sagacity, turned his eye steadily on the faces of his two kinsmen; and he saw at the first glance that a deeper intellect and a graver temper than Wolnoth's fair face betrayed characterised the dark eye and serious brow of Haco.  He therefore drew his nephew a little aside, and said to him:  \"Forewarned is forearmed.  Deemest thou that this fairspoken Duke will dare aught against my life?\"  \"Life, no; liberty, yes.\"  Harold startled, and those strong passions native to his breast, but usually curbed beneath his majestic will, heaved in his bosom and flashed in his eye.  \"Liberty!--let him dare!  Though all his troops paved the way from his court to his coasts, I would hew my way through their ranks.\"  \"Deemest thou that I am a coward?\" said Haco, simply, \"yet contrary to all law and justice, and against King Edward's well-known remonstrance, hath not the Count detained me years, yea, long years, in his land?  Kind are his words, wily his deeds.  Fear not force; fear fraud.\"  \"I fear neither,\" answered Harold, drawing himself up, \"nor do I repent me one moment--No! nor did I repent in the dungeon of that felon Count, whom God grant me life to repay with fire and sword for his treason--that I myself have come hither to demand my kinsmen.  I come in the name of England, strong in her might, and sacred in her majesty.\"  Before Haco could reply, the door opened, and Raoul de Tancarville, as Grand Chamberlain, entered, with all Harold's Saxon train, and a goodly number of Norman squires and attendants, bearing rich vestures.  The noble bowed to the Earl with his country's polished courtesy, and besought leave to lead him to the bath, while his own squires prepared his raiment for the banquet to be held in his honour.  So all further conference with his young kinsmen was then suspended.  The Duke, who affected a state no less regal than that of the Court of France, permitted no one, save his own family and guests, to sit at his own table.  His great officers (those imperious lords) stood beside his chair; and William Fitzosborne, \"the Proud Spirit,\" placed on the board with his own hand the dainty dishes for which the Norman cooks were renowned.  And great"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7680"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 09 (#2)"],["body","were those Norman cooks; and often for some \"delicate,\" more ravishing than wont, gold chain and gem, and even \"bel maneir,\" fell to their guerdon [192].  It was worth being a cook in those days!  The most seductive of men was William in his fair moods; and he lavished all the witcheries at his control upon his guest. If possible, yet more gracious was Matilda the Duchess.  This woman, eminent for mental culture, for personal beauty, and for a spirit and ambition no less great than her lord's, knew well how to choose such subjects of discourse as might most flatter an English ear.  Her connection with Harold, through her sister's marriage with Tostig, warranted a familiarity almost caressing, which she assumed towards the comely Earl; and she insisted, with a winning smile, that all the hours the Duke would leave at his disposal he must spend with her.  The banquet was enlivened by the song of the great Taillefer himself, who selected a theme that artfully flattered alike the Norman and the Saxon; viz., the aid given by Rolfganger to Athelstan, and the alliance between the English King and the Norman founder.  He dexterously introduced into the song praises of the English, and the value of their friendship; and the Countess significantly applauded each gallant compliment to the land of the famous guest. If Harold was pleased by such poetic courtesies, he was yet more surprised by the high honour in which Duke, baron, and prelate evidently held the Poet: for it was among the worst signs of that sordid spirit, honouring only wealth, which had crept over the original character of the Anglo- Saxon, that the bard or scop, with them, had sunk into great disrepute, and it was even forbidden to ecclesiastics [193] to admit such landless vagrants to their company.  Much, indeed, there was in that court which, even on the first day, Harold saw to admire--that stately temperance, so foreign to English excesses, (but which, alas! the Norman kept not long when removed to another soil)--that methodical state and noble pomp which characterised the Feudal system, linking so harmoniously prince to peer, and peer to knight--the easy grace, the polished wit of the courtiers--the wisdom of Lanfranc, and the higher ecclesiastics, blending worldly lore with decorous, not pedantic, regard to their sacred calling--the enlightened love of music, letters, song, and art, which coloured the discourse both of Duke and Duchess and the younger courtiers, prone to emulate high example, whether for ill or good--all impressed Harold with a sense of civilisation and true royalty, which at once saddened and inspired his musing mind--saddened him when he thought how far behind-hand England was in much, with this comparatively petty principality--inspired him when he felt what one great chief can do for his native land.  The unfavorable impressions made upon his thoughts by Haco's warnings could scarcely fail to yield beneath the prodigal courtesies lavished upon him, and the frank openness with which William laughingly excused himself for having so long detained the hostages, \"in order, my guest, to make thee come and fetch them.  And, by St. Valery, now thou art here, thou shalt not depart, till, at least, thou hast lost in gentler memories the recollection of the scurvy treatment thou hast met from that barbarous Count.  Nay, never bite thy lip, Harold, my friend, leave to me thy revenge upon Guy.  Sooner or later, the very maneir he hath extorted from me shall give excuse for sword and lance, and then, pardex, thou shalt come and cross steel in thine own quarrel.  How I rejoice that I can show to the beau frere of my dear cousin and seigneur some return for all the courtesies the English King and kingdom bestowed upon me!  To-morrow we will ride to Rouen; there, all knightly sports shall be held to grace thy coming; and by St. Michael, knight-saint of the Norman, nought less will content me than to have thy great name in the list of my chosen chevaliers.  But the night wears now, and thou sure must need sleep;\" and, thus talking, the Duke himself led the way to Harold's chamber, and insisted on removing the ouche from his robe of state.  As he did so, he passed his hand, as if carelessly, along the Earl's right arm.  \"Ha!\" said he suddenly, and in his natural tone of voice, which was short and quick, \"these muscles have known practice!  Dost think thou couldst bend my bow!\"  \"Who could bend that of--Ulysses?\" returned the Earl, fixing his deep blue eye upon the Norman's.  William unconsciously changed colour, for he felt that he was at that moment more Ulysses than Achilles.     CHAPTER III.   Side by side, William and Harold entered the fair city of Rouen, and there, a succession of the brilliant pageants and knightly entertainments, (comprising those \"rare feats of honour,\" expanded, with the following age, into the more gorgeous display of joust and tourney,) was designed to dazzle the eyes and captivate the fancy of the Earl.  But though Harold won, even by the confession of the chronicles most in favour of the Norman, golden opinions in a court more ready to deride than admire the Saxon,--though not only the \"strength of his body,\" and \"the boldness of his spirit,\" as shown in exhibitions unfamiliar to Saxon warriors, but his \"manners,\" his \"eloquence, intellect, and other good qualities,\" [194] were loftily conspicuous amidst those knightly courtiers, that sublime part of his character, which was found in his simple manhood and intense nationality, kept him unmoved and serene amidst all intended to exercise that fatal spell which Normanised most of those who came within the circle of Norman attraction.  These festivities were relieved by pompous excursions and progresses from town to town, and fort to fort, throughout the Duchy, and, according to some authorities, even to a visit to Philip the French King at Compiegne.  On the return to Rouen, Harold and the six thegns of his train were solemnly admitted into that peculiar band of warlike brothers which William had instituted, and to which, following the chronicles of the after century, we have given the name of Knights. The silver baldrick was belted on, and the lance, with its pointed banderol, was placed in the hand, and the seven Saxon lords became Norman knights.  The evening after this ceremonial, Harold was with the Duchess and her fair daughters--all children.  The beauty of one of the girls drew from him those compliments so sweet to a mother's ear.  Matilda looked up from the broidery on which she was engaged, and beckoned to her the child thus praised.  \"Adeliza,\" she said, placing her hand on the girl's dark locks, \"though we would not that thou shouldst learn too early how men's tongues can gloze and flatter, yet this noble guest hath so high a repute for truth, that thou mayest at least believe him sincere when he says thy face is fair.  Think of it, and with pride, my child; let it keep thee through youth proof against the homage of meaner men; and, peradventure, St. Michael and St. Valery may bestow on thee a mate valiant and comely as this noble lord.\"  The child blushed to her brow; but answered with the quickness of a spoiled infant--unless, perhaps, she had been previously tutored so to reply: \"Sweet mother, I will have no mate and no lord but Harold himself; and if he will not have Adeliza as his wife, she will die a nun.\"  \"Froward child, it is not for thee to woo!\" said Matilda, smiling. \"Thou heardst her, noble Harold: what is thine answer?  \"That she will grow wiser,\" said the Earl, laughing, as he kissed the child's forehead.  \"Fair damsel, ere thou art ripe for the altar, time will have sown grey in these locks; and thou wouldst smile indeed in scorn, if Harold then claimed thy troth.\"  \"Not so,\" said Matilda, seriously; \"Highborn damsels see youth not in years but in fame--Fame, which is young for ever!\"  Startled by the gravity with which Matilda spoke, as if to give importance to what had seemed a jest, the Earl, versed in courts, felt that a snare was round him; and replied in a tone between jest and earnest: \"Happy am I to wear on my heart a charm, proof against all the beauty even of this court.\"  Matilda's face darkened; and William entering at that time with his usual abruptness, lord and lady exchanged glances, not unobserved by Harold.  The Duke, however, drew aside the Saxon; and saying gaily, \"We Normans are not naturally jealous; but then, till now, we have not had Saxon gallants closeted with our wives;\" added more seriously, \"Harold, I have a grace to pray at thy hands--come with me.\"  The Earl followed William into his chamber, which he found filled with chiefs, in high converse; and William then hastened to inform him that he was about to make a military expedition against the Bretons; and knowing his peculiar acquaintance with the warfare, as with the language and manners, of their kindred Welch, he besought his aid in a campaign which he promised him should be brief.  Perhaps the Earl was not, in his own mind, averse from returning William's display of power by some evidence of his own military skill, and the valour of the Saxon thegns in his train.  There might be prudence in such exhibition, and, at all events, he could not with a good grace decline the proposal.  He enchanted William therefore by a simple acquiescence; and the rest of the evening--deep into night--was spent in examining charts of the fort and country intended to be attacked.  The conduct and courage of Harold and his Saxons in this expedition are recorded by the Norman chroniclers.  The Earl's personal exertions saved, at the passage of Coesnon, a detachment of soldiers, who would otherwise have perished in the quicksands; and even the warlike skill of William, in the brief and brilliant campaign, was, if not eclipsed, certainly equalled, by that of the Saxon chief.  While the campaign lasted, William and Harold had but one table and one tent.  To outward appearance,"]]]
