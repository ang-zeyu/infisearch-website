Harold's brow fell.  \"Mother, not even to cheer thee will I deceive.  The time of the hostageship rests with the King and the Duke.  As long as the one affects fear from the race of Godwin, as long as the other feigns care for such priests or such knights as were not banished from the realm, being not courtiers, but scattered wide and far in convent and homestead, so long will Wolnoth and Haco be guests in the Norman halls.\"  Githa wrung her hands.  \"But comfort, my mother; Wolnoth is young, his eye is keen, and his spirit prompt and quick.  He will mark these Norman captains, he will learn their strength and their weakness, their manner of war, and he will come back, not as Edward the King came, a lover of things un- Saxon, but able to warn and to guide us against the plots of the camp- court, which threatens more, year by year, the peace of the world. And he will see there arts we may worthily borrow: not the cut of a tunic, and the fold of a gonna, but the arts of men who found states and build nations.  William the Duke is splendid and wise; merchants tell us how crafts thrive under his iron hand, and war-men say that his forts are constructed with skill and his battle-schemes planned as the mason plans key-stone and arch, with weight portioned out to the prop, and the force of the hand made tenfold by the science of the brain.  So that the boy will return to us a man round and complete, a teacher of greybeards, and the sage of his kin; fit for earldom and rule, fit for glory and England.  Grieve not, daughter of the Dane kings, that thy son, the best loved, hath nobler school and wider field than his brothers.\"  This appeal touched the proud heart of the niece of Canute the Great, and she almost forgot the grief of her love in the hope of her ambition.  She dried her tears and smiled upon Wolnoth, and already, in the dreams of a mother's vanity, saw him great as Godwin in council, and prosperous as Harold in the field.  Nor, half Norman as he was, did the young man seem insensible of the manly and elevated patriotism of his brother's hinted lessons, though he felt they implied reproof.  He came to the Earl, whose arm was round his mother, and said with a frank heartiness not usual to a nature somewhat frivolous and irresolute:  \"Harold, thy tongue could kindle stones into men, and warm those men into Saxons.  Thy Wolnoth shall not hang his head with shame when he comes back to our merrie land with shaven locks and spurs of gold. For if thou doubtest his race from his look, thou shalt put thy right hand on his heart, and feel England beat there in every pulse.\"  \"Brave words, and well spoken,\" cried the Earl, and he placed his hand on the boy's head as in benison.  Till then, Haco had stood apart, conversing with the infant Thyra, whom his dark, mournful face awed and yet touched, for she nestled close to him, and put her little hand in his; but now, inspired no less than his cousin by Harold's noble speech, he came proudly forward by Wolnoth's side, and said:  \"I, too, am English, and I have the name of Englishman to redeem.\"  Ere Harold could reply, Githa exclaimed:  \"Leave there thy right hand on my child's head, and say, simply: 'By my troth and my plight, if the Duke detain Wolnoth, son of Githa, against just plea, and King's assent to his return, I, Harold, will, failing letter and nuncius, cross the seas, to restore the child to the mother.'\" [107]  Harold hesitated.  A sharp cry of reproach that went to his heart broke from Githa's lips.  \"Ah! cold and self-heeding, wilt thou send him to bear a peril from which thou shrinkest thyself?\"  \"By my troth and my plight, then,\" said the Earl, \"if, fair time elapsed, peace in England, without plea of justice, and against my king's fiat, Duke William of Normandy detain the hostages;--thy son and this dear boy, more sacred and more dear to me for his father's woes,--I will cross the seas, to restore the child to the mother, the fatherless to his fatherland.  So help me, all-seeing One, Amen and Amen!\"     CHAPTER IV.   We have seen, in an earlier part of this record, that Harold possessed, amongst his numerous and more stately possessions, a house, not far from the old Roman dwelling-place of Hilda.  And in this residence he now (save when with the King) made his chief abode.  He gave as the reasons for his selection, the charm it took, in his eyes, from that signal mark of affection which his ceorls had rendered him, in purchasing the house and tilling the ground in his absence; and more especially the convenience of its vicinity to the new palace at Westminster; for, by Edward's special desire, while the other brothers repaired to their different domains, Harold remained near his royal person.  To use the words of the great Norwegian chronicler, \"Harold was always with the Court itself, and nearest to the King in all service.\"  \"The King loved him very much, and kept him as his own son, for he had no children.\"'  This attendance on Edward was naturally most close at the restoration to power of the Earl's family.  For Harold, mild and conciliating, was, like Alred, a great peacemaker, and Edward had never cause to complain of him, as he believed he had of the rest of that haughty house.  But the true spell which made dear to Harold the rude building of timber, with its doors open all day to his lithsmen, when with a light heart he escaped from the halls of Westminster, was the fair face of Edith his neighbour.  The impression which this young girl had made upon Harold seemed to partake of the strength of a fatality.  For Harold had loved her before the marvellous beauty of her womanhood began; and, occupied from his earliest youth in grave and earnest affairs, his heart had never been frittered away on the mean and frivolous affections of the idle.  Now, in that comparative leisure of his stormy life, he was naturally most open to the influence of a charm more potent than all the glamoury of Hilda.  The autumn sun shone through the golden glades of the forest-land, when Edith sate alone on the knoll that faced forestland and road, and watched afar.  And the birds sung cheerily; but that was not the sound for which Edith listened: and the squirrel darted from tree to tree on the sward beyond; but not to see the games of the squirrel sat Edith by the grave of the Teuton.  By-and-by, came the cry of the dogs, and the tall gre-hound [108] of Wales emerged from the bosky dells.  Then Edith's heart heaved, and her eyes brightened.  And now, with his hawk on his wrist, and his spear [109] in his hand, came, through the yellowing boughs, Harold the Earl.  And well may ye ween, that his heart beat as loud and his eye shone as bright as Edith's, when he saw who had watched for his footsteps on the sepulchral knoll; Love, forgetful of the presence of Death;--so has it ever been, so ever shall it be!  He hastened his stride, and bounded up the gentle hillock, and his dogs, with a joyous bark, came round the knees of Edith.  Then Harold shook the bird from his wrist, and it fell, with its light wing, on the altar-stone of Thor.  \"Thou art late, but thou art welcome, Harold my kinsman,\" said Edith, simply, as she bent her face over the hounds, whose gaunt heads she caressed.  \"Call me not kinsman,\" said Harold, shrinking, and with a dark cloud on his broad brow.  \"And why, Harold?\"  \"Oh, Edith, why?\" murmured Harold; and his thought added, \"she knows not, poor child, that in that mockery of kinship the Church sets its ban on our bridals.\"  He turned, and chid his dogs fiercely as they gambolled in rough glee round their fair friend.  The hounds crouched at the feet of Edith; and Edith looked in mild wonder at the troubled face of the Earl.  \"Thine eyes rebuke me, Edith, more than my words the hounds!\" said Harold, gently.  \"But there is quick blood in my veins; and the mind must be calm when it would control the humour.  Calm was my mind, sweet Edith, in the old time, when thou wert an infant on my knee, and wreathing, with these rude hands, flower-chains for thy neck like the swan's down, I said, 'The flowers fade, but the chain lasts when love weaves it.'\"  Edith again bent her face over the crouching hounds.  Harold gazed on her with mournful fondness; and the bird still sung and the squirrel swung himself again from bough to bough.  Edith spoke first:  \"My godmother, thy sister, hath sent for me, Harold, and I am to go to the Court to-morrow.  Shalt thou be there?\"  \"Surely,\" said Harold, in an anxious voice, \"surely, I will be there! So my sister hath sent for thee: wittest thou wherefore?\"  Edith grew very pale, and her tone trembled as she answered:  \"Well-a-day, yes.\"  \"It is as I feared, then!\" exclaimed Harold, in great agitation; \"and my sister, whom these monks have demented, leagues herself with the King against the law of the wide welkin and the grand religion of the human heart.  Oh!\" continued the Earl, kindling into an enthusiasm, rare to his even moods, but wrung as much from his broad sense as from his strong affection, \"when I compare the Saxon of our land and day, all enervated and decrepit by priestly superstition, with his forefathers in the first Christian era, yielding to the religion they adopted in its simple truths, but not to that rot of social happiness and free manhood which this cold and lifeless monarchism--making virtue the absence of human ties--spreads around--which the great Bede [110], though himself a monk, vainly but bitterly denounced;--yea, verily, when I see the Saxon already the theowe of the priest, I shudder to ask how long he will be folk-free of the tyrant.\"  He paused, breathed hard, and seizing, almost sternly, the girl's trembling arm, he resumed between his set teeth: \"So they would have thee be a nun?--Thou wilt not,--thou durst not,--thy heart would perjure thy vows!\"  \"Ah, Harold!\" answered Edith,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7675"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 04 (#4)"],["body","out of all bashfulness by his emotion and her own terror of the convent, and answering, if with the love of a woman, still with all the unconsciousness of a child: \"Better, oh better the grate of the body than that of the heart!--In the grave I could still live for those I love; behind the Grate, love itself must be dead.  Yes, thou pitiest me, Harold; thy sister, the Queen, is gentle and kind; I will fling myself at her feet, and say: 'Youth is fond, and the world is fair: let me live my youth, and bless God in the world that he saw was good!'\"  \"My own, own dear Edith!\" exclaimed Harold, overjoyed.  \"Say this.  Be firm: they cannot and they dare not force thee!  The law cannot wrench thee against thy will from the ward of thy guardian Hilda; and, where the law is, there Harold at least is strong,--and there at least our kinship, if my bane, is thy blessing.\"  \"Why, Harold, sayest thou that our kinship is thy bane?  It is so sweet to me to whisper to myself, 'Harold is of thy kith, though distant; and it is natural to thee to have pride in his fame, and joy in his presence!'  Why is that sweetness to me, to thee so bitter?\"  \"Because,\" answered Harold, dropping the hand he had clasped, and folding his arms in deep dejection, \"because but for that I should say: 'Edith, I love thee more than a brother: Edith, be Harold's wife!'  And were I to say it, and were we to wed, all the priests of the Saxons would lift up their hands in horror, and curse our nuptials, and I should be the bann'd of that spectre the Church; and my house would shake to its foundations; and my father, and my brothers, and the thegns and the proceres, and the abbots and prelates, whose aid makes our force, would gather round me with threats and with prayers, that I might put thee aside.  And mighty as I am now, so mighty once was Sweyn my brother; and outlaw as Sweyn is now, might Harold be; and outlaw if Harold were, what breast so broad as his could fill up the gap left in the defence of England?  And the passions that I curb, as a rider his steed, might break their rein; and, strong in justice, and child of Nature, I might come, with banner and mail, against Church, and House, and Fatherland; and the blood of my countrymen might be poured like water: and, therefore, slave to the lying thraldom he despises, Harold dares not say to the maid of his love, 'Give me thy right hand, and be my bride!'\"  Edith had listened in bewilderment and despair, her eyes fixed on his, and her face locked and rigid, as if turned to stone.  But when he had ceased, and, moving some steps away, turned aside his manly countenance, that Edith might not perceive its anguish, the noble and sublime spirit of that sex which ever, when lowliest, most comprehends the lofty, rose superior both to love and to grief; and rising, she advanced, and placing her slight hand on his stalwart shoulder, she said, half in pity, half in reverence: \"Never before, O Harold, did I feel so proud of thee: for Edith could not love thee as she doth, and will till the grave clasp her, if thou didst not love England more than Edith.  Harold, till this hour I was a child, and I knew not my own heart: I look now into that heart, and I see that I am woman. Harold, of the cloister I have now no fear: and all life does not shrink--no, it enlarges, and it soars into one desire--to be worthy to pray for thee!\"  \"Maid, maid!\" exclaimed Harold, abruptly, and pale as the dead, \"do not say thou hast no fear of the cloister.  I adjure, I command thee, build not up between us that dismal everlasting wall.  While thou art free Hope yet survives--a phantom, haply but Hope still.\"  \"As thou wilt I will,\" said Edith, humbly: \"order my fate so as pleases thee the best.\"  Then, not daring to trust herself longer, for she felt the tears rushing to her eyes, she turned away hastily, and left him alone beside the altar-stone and the tomb.     CHAPTER V.   The next day, as Harold was entering the palace of Westminster, with intent to seek the King's lady, his father met him in one of the corridors, and, taking him gravely by the hand said:  \"My son, I have much on my mind regarding thee and our House; come with me.\"  \"Nay,\" said the Earl, \"by your leave let it be later.  For I have it on hand to see my sister, ere confessor, or monk, or schoolman, claim her hours!\"  \"Not so, Harold,\" said the Earl, briefly.  \"My daughter is now in her oratory, and we shall have time enow to treat of things mundane ere she is free to receive thee, and to preach to thee of things ghostly, the last miracle at St. Alban's, or the last dream of the King, who would be a great man and a stirring, if as restless when awake as he is in his sleep.  Come.\"  Harold, in that filial obedience which belonged, as of course, to his antique cast of character, made no farther effort to escape, but with a sigh followed Godwin into one of the contiguous chambers.  \"Harold,\" then said Earl Godwin, after closing the door carefully, \"thou must not let the King keep thee longer in dalliance and idleness: thine earldom needs thee without delay.  Thou knowest that these East Angles, as we Saxons still call them, are in truth mostly Danes and Norsemen; people jealous and fierce, and free, and more akin to the Normans than to the Saxons.  My whole power in England hath been founded, not less on my common birth with the freefolk of Wessex --Saxons like myself, and therefore easy for me, a Saxon, to conciliate and control--than on the hold I have ever sought to establish, whether by arms or by arts, over the Danes in the realm.  And I tell and I warn thee, Harold, as the natural heir of my greatness, that he who cannot command the stout hearts of the Anglo-Danes, will never maintain the race of Godwin in the post they have won in the vanguard of Saxon England.\"  \"This I wot well, my father,\" answered Harold; \"and I see with joy, that while those descendants of heroes and freemen are blended indissolubly with the meeker Saxon, their freer laws and hardier manners are gradually supplanting, or rather regenerating, our own.\"  Godwin smiled approvingly on his son, and then his brow becoming serious, and the dark pupil of his blue eye dilating, he resumed:  \"This is well, my son; and hast thou thought also, that while thou art loitering in these galleries, amidst the ghosts of men in monk cowls, Siward is shadowing our House with his glory, and all north the Humber rings with his name?  Hast thou thought that all Mercia is in the hands of Leofric our rival, and that Algar his son, who ruled Wessex in my absence, left there a name so beloved, that had I stayed a year longer, the cry had been 'Algar', not 'Godwin'?--for so is the multitude ever!  Now aid me, Harold, for my soul is troubled, and I cannot work alone; and though I say naught to others, my heart received a death-blow when tears fell from its blood-springs on the brow of Sweyn, my first-born.\"  The old man paused, and his lip quivered.  \"Thou, thou alone, Harold, noble boy, thou alone didst stand by his side in the hall; alone, alone, and I blessed thee in that hour over all the rest of my sons.  Well, well! now to earth again.  Aid me, Harold.  I open to thee my web: complete the woof when this hand is cold.  The new tree that stands alone in the plain is soon nipped by the winter; fenced round with the forest, its youth takes shelter from its fellows [111].  So is it with a house newly founded; it must win strength from the allies that it sets round its slender stein.  What had been Godwin, son of Wolnoth, had he not married into the kingly house of great Canute?  It is this that gives my sons now the right to the loyal love of the Danes.  The throne passed from Canute and his race, and the Saxons again had their hour; and I gave, as Jephtha gave his daughter, my blooming Edith, to the cold bed of the Saxon King. Had sons sprung from that union, the grandson of Godwin, royal alike from Saxon and Dane, would reign on the throne of the isle.  Fate ordered otherwise, and the spider must weave web anew.  Thy brother, Tostig, has added more splendour than solid strength of our line, in his marriage with the daughter of Baldwin the Count.  The foreigner helps us little in England.  Thou, O Harold, must bring new props to the House.  I would rather see thee wed to the child of one of our great rivals than to the daughter of kaisar, or outland king.  Siward hath no daughter undisposed of.  Algar, son of Leofric, hath a daughter fair as the fairest; make her thy bride that Algar may cease to be a foe.  This alliance will render Mercia, in truth, subject to our principalities, since the stronger must quell the weaker.  It doth more.  Algar himself has married into the royalty of Wales [112]. Thou wilt win all those fierce tribes to thy side.  Their forces will gain thee the marches, now held so feebly under Rolf the Norman, and in case of brief reverse, or sharp danger, their mountains will give refuge from all foes.  This day, greeting Algar, he told me he meditated bestowing his daughter on Gryffyth, the rebel under-King of North Wales.  Therefore,\" continued the old Earl, with a smile, \"thou must speak in time, and win and woo in the same breath.  No hard task, methinks, for Harold of the golden tongue.\"  \"Sir, and father,\" replied the young Earl, whom the long speech addressed to him had prepared for its close, and whose habitual self- control saved him from disclosing his emotion, \"I thank you duteously, for your care for my future, and hope to profit by your wisdom.  I will ask the King's leave to go to my East Anglians, and hold there a folkmuth, administer justice, redress grievances, and make thegn and ceorl content with Harold, their Earl.  But vain is peace in the realm, if there is strife in the house.  And Aldyth, the daughter of Algar, cannot be house-wife to me.\"  \"Why?\"  asked the old Earl, calmly, and surveying his son's face with those eyes so clear yet so unfathomable.  \"Because, though I"]]]
