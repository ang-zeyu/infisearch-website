Frontispiece caption= THE SCENE OF OUR HISTORY IS LAID UPON A LITTLE PLANET, LOST IN THE VASTNESS OF THE UNIVERSE.   To JIMMIE \"What is the use of a book without pictures?\" said Alice.     FOREWORD  For Hansje and Willem:   WHEN I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of mine who gave me my love for books and pictures promised to take me upon a memorable expedition. I was to go with him to the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam.  And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that of Saint Peter opened a mysterious door. \"Ring the bell,\" he said, \"when you come back and want to get out,\" and with a great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the noise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new and strange experiences.  For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon of audible silence. When we had climbed the first flight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited knowledge of natural phenomena--that of tangible darkness. A match showed us where the upward road continued. We went to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly we had plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with the roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom. Covered with many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols of a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good people of the city many years ago. That which had meant life and death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rubbish. The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved images and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between the outspread arms of a kindly saint.  The next floor showed us from where we had derived our light. Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made the high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of pigeons. The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was filled with a weird and pleasing music. It was the noise of the town below us, but a noise which had been purified and cleansed by the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking of horses' hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing sound of the patient steam which had been set to do the work of man in a thousand different ways--they had all been blended into a softly rustling whisper which provided a beautiful background for the trembling cooing of the pigeons.  Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And after the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel his way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even greater wonder, the town-clock. I saw the heart of time. I could hear the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds--one--two--three--up to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise when all the wheels seemed to stop and another minute had been chopped off eternity. Without pause it began again--one--two--three--until at last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels a thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was the hour of noon.  On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and their terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made me turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the night telling a story of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it seemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which it had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of Rotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars in an old-fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who twice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the country-folk who had come to market to buy and sell and hear what the big world had been doing. But in a corner--all alone and shunned by the others--a big black bell, silent and stern, the bell of death.  Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and even more dangerous than those we had climbed before, and suddenly the fresh air of the wide heavens. We had reached the highest gallery. Above us the sky. Below us the city--a little toy-town, where busy ants were hastily crawling hither and thither, each one intent upon his or her particular business, and beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the open country.  It was my first glimpse of the big world.  Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have gone to the top of the tower and enjoyed myself. It was hard work, but it repaid in full the mere physical exertion of climbing a few stairs.  Besides, I knew what my reward would be. I would see the land and the sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind friend the watchman, who lived in a small shack, built in a sheltered corner of the gallery. He looked after the clock and was a father to the bells, and he warned of fires, but he enjoyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and thought his own peaceful thoughts. He had gone to school almost fifty years before and he had rarely read a book, but he had lived on the top of his tower for so many years that he had absorbed the wisdom of that wide world which surrounded him on all sides.  History he knew well, for it was a living thing with him. \"There,\" he would say, pointing to a bend of the river, \"there, my boy, do you see those trees? That is where the Prince of Orange cut the dikes to drown the land and save Leyden.\" Or he would tell me the tale of the old Meuse, until the broad river ceased to be a convenient harbour and became a wonderful highroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp upon that famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that the sea might be free to all.  Then there were the little villages, clustering around the protecting church which once, many years ago, had been the home of their Patron Saints. In the distance we could see the leaning tower of Delft. Within sight of its high arches, William the Silent had been murdered and there Grotius had learned to construe his first Latin sentences. And still further away, the long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home of the man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of many an emperor, the charity-boy whom the world came to know as Erasmus.  Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast, immediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys and houses and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways, which we called our home. But the tower showed us the old home in a new light. The confused commotion of the streets and the market-place, of the factories and the workshop, became the well-ordered expression of human energy and purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past, which surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face the problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily tasks.  History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit of the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are strong and it can be done.  Here I give you the key that will open the door.  When you return, you too will understand the reason for my enthusiasm.  HENDRIK WILLEM VAN LOON.    CONTENTS      1.  THE SETTING OF THE STAGE    2.

THEY EXPRESSED     THEIR HAPPINESS IN POETRY AND IN SCULPTURE AND     IN ARCHITECTURE AND PAINTING, AND IN THE BOOKS THEY     PRINTED    41. BUT NOW THAT PEOPLE HAD BROKEN THROUGH THE BONDS OF     THEIR NARROW MEDIEVAL LIMITATIONS, THEY HAD TO HAVE     MORE ROOM FOR THEIR WANDERINGS. THE EUROPEAN WORLD     HAD GROWN TOO SMALL FOR THEIR AMBITIONS. IT WAS THE     TIME OF THE GREAT VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY    42. CONCERNING BUDDHA AND CONFUCIUS    43.

HELENA, THE     RULERS WHO SO OFTEN HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY THE HATED     CORSICAN MET AT VIENNA AND TRIED TO UNDO THE MANY     CHANCES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE FRENCH     REVOLUTION    55. THEY TRIED TO ASSURE THE WORLD AN ERA OF UNDISTURBED     PEACE BY SUPPRESSING ALL NEW IDEAS. THEY MADE THE     POLICE-SPY THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARY IN THE STATE AND     SOON THE PRISONS OF ALL COUNTRIES WERE FILLED WITH     THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO     GOVERN THEMSELVES AS THEY SEE FIT    56. THE LOVE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, HOWEVER, WAS TOO     STRONG TO BE DESTROYED IN THIS WAY. THE SOUTH AMERICANS     WERE THE FIRST TO REBEL AGAINST THE REACTIONARY     MEASURES OF THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA. GREECE AND BELGIUM     AND SPAIN AND A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES     OF THE EUROPEAN CONTINENT FOLLOWED SUIT AND THE     NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS FILLED WITH THE RUMOR OF MANY     WARS OF INDEPENDENCE    57. BUT WHITE THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR     NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE, THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY LIVED     HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CHANGED BY A SERIES OF INVENTIONS,     WHICH HAD MADE THE CLUMSY OLD STEAM-ENGINE OF THE     EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE MOST FAITHFUL AND EFFICIENT     STAVE OF MAN    58. THE NEW ENGINES WERE VERY EXPENSIVE AND ONLY PEOPLE     OF WEALTH COULD AFFORD THEM. THE OLD CARPENTER OR     SHOEMAKER WHO HAD BEEN HIS OWN MASTER IN HIS LITTLE     WORKSHOP WAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HIMSELF OUT TO THE OWNERS     OF THE BIG MECHANICAL TOOLS, AND WHITE HE MADE     MORE MONEY THAN BEFORE, HE LOST HIS FORMER INDEPENDENCE     AND HE DID NOT LIKE THAT    59. THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY DID NOT BRING     ABOUT THE ERA OF HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY WHICH HAD     BEEN PREDICTED BY THE GENERATION WHICH SAW THE STAGE     COACH REPLACED BY THE RAILROAD. SEVERAL REMEDIES     WERE SUGGESTED, BUT NONE OF THESE QUITE SOLVED THE     PROBLEM    60. BUT THE WORLD HAD UNDERGONE ANOTHER CHANGE WHICH WAS     OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN EITHER THE POLITICAL OR THE     INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS. AFTER GENERATIONS OF OPPRESSION     AND PERSECUTION, THE SCIENTIST HAD AT LAST GAINED     LIBERTY OF ACTION AND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO DISCOVER     THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE UNIVERSE    61.

It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide. Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak.  When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day of eternity will have gone by.     THE SETTING OF THE STAGE   WE live under the shadow of a gigantic question mark.  Who are we?  Where do we come from?  Whither are we bound?  Slowly, but with persistent courage, we have been pushing this question mark further and further towards that distant line, beyond the horizon, where we hope to find our answer.  We have not gone very far.  We still know very little but we have reached the point where (with a fair degree of accuracy) we can guess at many things.  In this chapter I shall tell you how (according to our best belief) the stage was set for the first appearance of man.  If we represent the time during which it has been possible for animal life to exist upon our planet by a line of this length, then the tiny line just below indicates the age during which man (or a creature more or less resembling man) has lived upon this earth.  Man was the last to come but the first to use his brain for the purpose of conquering the forces of nature. That is the reason why we are going to study him, rather than cats or dogs or horses or any of the other animals, who, all in their own way, have a very interesting historical development behind them.  In the beginning, the planet upon which we live was (as far as we now know) a large ball of flaming matter, a tiny cloud of smoke in the endless ocean of space. Gradually, in the course of millions of years, the surface burned itself out, and was covered with a thin layer of rocks. Upon these lifeless rocks the rain descended in endless torrents, wearing out the hard granite and carrying the dust to the valleys that lay hidden between the high cliffs of the steaming earth.  Finally the hour came when the sun broke through the clouds and saw how this little planet was covered with a few small puddles which were to develop into the mighty oceans of the eastern and western hemispheres.  Then one day the great wonder happened. What had been dead, gave birth to life.  The first living cell floated upon the waters of the sea.  For millions of years it drifted aimlessly with the currents. But during all that time it was developing certain habits that it might survive more easily upon the inhospitable earth. Some of these cells were happiest in the dark depths of the lakes and the pools. They took root in the slimy sediments which had been carried down from the tops of the hills and they became plants. Others preferred to move about and they grew strange jointed legs, like scorpions and began to crawl along the bottom of the sea amidst the plants and the pale green things that looked like jelly-fishes. Still others (covered with scales) depended upon a swimming motion to go from place to place in their search for food, and gradually they populated the ocean with myriads of fishes.  Meanwhile the plants had increased in number and they had to search for new dwelling places. There was no more room for them at the bottom of the sea. Reluctantly they left the water and made a new home in the marshes and on the mud-banks that lay at the foot of the mountains. Twice a day the tides of the ocean covered them with their brine. For the rest of the time, the plants made the best of their uncomfortable situation and tried to survive in the thin air which surrounded the surface of the planet. After centuries of training, they learned how to live as comfortably in the air as they had done in the water. They"]]]
