VII.    So back he strode and thus he spoke, to that Archbishop meek:   \"I take the land thy king bestows from Eure to Michael-peak,   I take the maid, or foul or fair, a bargain with the toast,   And for thy creed, a sea-king's gods are those that give the most.   So hie thee back, and tell thy chief to make his proffer true,   And he shall find a docile son, and ye a saint in Rou.\"                         VIII.    So o'er the border stream of Epte came Rou the Norman, where,   Begirt with barons, sat the King, enthroned at green St. Clair;   He placed his hand in Charles's hand,--loud shouted all the throng,   But tears were in King Charles's eyes--the grip of Rou was strong.   \"Now kiss the foot,\" the Bishop said, \"that homage still is due;\"   Then dark the frown and stern the smile of that grim convert, Rou.                          IX.    He takes the foot, as if the foot to slavish lips to bring;   The Normans scowl; he tilts the throne, and backwards falls the       King.   Loud laugh the joyous Norman men--pale stare the Franks aghast;   And Rou lifts up his head as from the wind springs up the mast;   \"I said I would adore a God, but not a mortal too;   The foot that fled before a foe let cowards kiss!\" said Rou.  No words can express the excitement which this rough minstrelsy-- marred as it is by our poor translation from the Romance-tongue in which it was chanted--produced amongst the Norman guests; less perhaps, indeed, the song itself, than the recognition of the minstrel; and as he closed, from more than a hundred voices came the loud murmur, only subdued from a shout by the royal presence, \"Taillefer, our Norman Taillefer!\"  \"By our joint saint, Peter, my cousin the King,\" exclaimed William, after a frank cordial laugh; \"Well I wot, no tongue less free than my warrior minstrel's could have so shocked our ears.  Excuse his bold theme, for the sake of his bold heart, I pray thee; and since I know well\" (here the Duke's face grew grave and anxious) \"that nought save urgent and weighty news from my stormy realm could have brought over this rhyming petrel, permit the officer behind me to lead hither a bird, I fear, of omen as well as of song.\"  \"Whatever pleases thee, pleases me,\" said Edward, drily; and he gave the order to the attendant.  In a few moments, up the space in the hall, between either table, came the large stride of the famous minstrel, preceded by the officer and followed by the ecclesiastic. The hoods of both were now thrown back, and discovered countenances in strange contrast, but each equally worthy of the attention it provoked.  The face of the minstrel was open and sunny as the day; and that of the priest, dark and close as night.  Thick curls of deep auburn (the most common colour for the locks of the Norman) wreathed in careless disorder round Taillefer's massive unwrinkled brow.  His eye, of light hazel, was bold and joyous; mirth, though sarcastic and sly, mantled round his lips.  His whole presence was at once engaging and heroic.  On the other hand, the priest's cheek was dark and sallow; his features singularly delicate and refined; his forehead high, but somewhat narrow, and crossed with lines of thought; his mien composed, modest, but not without calm self-confidence.  Amongst that assembly of soldiers, noiseless, self-collected, and conscious of his surpassing power over swords and mail, moved the SCHOLAR.  William's keen eye rested on the priest with some surprise, not unmixed with pride and ire; but first addressing Taillefer, who now gained the foot of the dais, he said, with a familiarity almost fond:  \"Now, by're Lady, if thou bringest not ill news, thy gay face, man, is pleasanter to mine eyes that thy rough song to my ears.  Kneel, Taillefer, kneel to King Edward, and with more address, rogue, than our unlucky countryman to King Charles.\"  But Edward, as ill-liking the form of the giant as the subject of his lay, said, pushing back his seat as far as he could:  \"Nay, nay, we excuse thee, we excuse thee, tall man.\"  Nevertheless, the minstrel still knelt, and so, with a look of profound humility, did the priest.  Then both slowly rose, and at a sign from the Duke, passed to the other side of the table, standing behind Fitzosborne's chair.  \"Clerk,\" said William, eying deliberately the sallow face of the ecclesiastic; \"I know thee of old; and if the Church have sent me an envoy, per la resplendar De, it should have sent me at least an abbot.\"  \"Hein, hein!\"  said Taillefer, bluntly, \"vex not my bon camarade, Count of the Normans.  Gramercy, thou wilt welcome him, peradventure, better than me; for the singer tells but of discord, and the sage may restore the harmony.\"  \"Ha!\" said the Duke, and the frown fell so dark over his eyes that the last seemed only visible by two sparks of fire.  \"I guess, my proud Vavasours are mutinous.  Retire, thou and thy comrade.  Await me in my chamber.  The feast shall not flag in London because the wind blows a gale in Rouen.\"  The two envoys, since so they seemed, bowed in silence and withdrew.  \"Nought of ill-tidings, I trust,\" said Edward, who had not listened to the whispered communications that had passed between the Duke and his subjects.  \"No schism in thy Church?  The clerk seemed a peaceful man, and a humble.\"  \"An there were schism in my Church,\" said the fiery Duke, \"my brother of Bayeux would settle it by arguments as close as the gap between cord and throttle.\"  \"Ah! thou art, doubtless, well read in the canons, holy Odo!\" said the King, turning to the bishop with more respect than he had yet evinced towards that gentle prelate.  \"Canons, yes, Seigneur, I draw them up myself for my flock conformably with such interpretations of the Roman Church as suit best with the Norman realm: and woe to deacon, monk, or abbot, who chooses to misconstrue them.\" [61]  The bishop looked so truculent and menacing, while his fancy thus conjured up the possibility of heretical dissent, that Edward shrank from him as he had done from Taillefer; and in a few minutes after, on exchange of signals between himself and the Duke, who, impatient to escape, was too stately to testify that desire, the retirement of the royal party broke up the banquet; save, indeed, that a few of the elder Saxons, and more incorrigible Danes, still steadily kept their seats, and were finally dislodged from their later settlements on the stone floors, to find themselves, at dawn, carefully propped in a row against the outer walls of the palace, with their patient attendants, holding links, and gazing on their masters with stolid envy, if not of the repose at least of the drugs that had caused it.     CHAPTER II.   \"And now,\" said William, reclining on a long and narrow couch, with raised carved work all round it like a box (the approved fashion of a bed in those days), \"now, Sire Taillefer--thy news.\"  There were then in the Duke's chamber, the Count Fitzosborne, Lord of Breteuil, surnamed \"the Proud Spirit\"--who, with great dignity, was holding before the brazier the ample tunic of linen (called dormitorium in the Latin of that time, and night-rail in the Saxon tongue) in which his lord was to robe his formidable limbs for repose [62],--Taillefer, who stood erect before the Duke as a Roman sentry at his post,--and the ecclesiastic, a little apart, with arms gathered under his gown, and his bright dark eyes fixed on the ground.  \"High and puissant, my liege,\" then said Taillefer, gravely, and with a shade of sympathy on his large face, \"my news is such as is best told briefly: Bunaz, Count d'Eu and descendant of Richard Sanspeur, hath raised the standard of revolt.\"  \"Go on,\" said the Duke, clenching his hand.  \"Henry, King of the French, is treating with the rebel, and stirring up mutiny in thy realm, and pretenders to thy throne.\"  \"Ha!\" said the Duke, and his lip quivered; \"this is not all.\"  \"No, my liege! and the worst is to come.  Thy uncle Mauger, knowing that thy heart is bent on thy speedy nuptials with the high and noble damsel, Matilda of Flanders, has broken out again in thine absence--is preaching against thee in hall and from pulpit.  He declares that such espousals are incestuous, both as within the forbidden degrees, and inasmuch as Adele, the lady's mother, was betrothed to thine uncle Richard; and Mauger menaces excommunication if my liege pursues his suit! [63]  So troubled is the realm, that I, waiting not for debate in council, and fearing sinister ambassage if I did so, took ship from thy port of Cherbourg, and have not flagged rein, and scarce broken bread, till I could say to the heir of Rolf the Founder--Save thy realm from the men of mail, and thy bride from the knaves in serge.\"  \"Ho, ho!\" cried William; then bursting forth in full wrath, as he sprang from the couch.  \"Hearest thou this, Lord Seneschal?  Seven years, the probation of the patriarch, have I wooed and waited; and lo, in the seventh, does a proud priest say to me, 'Wrench the love from thy heart-strings!'--Excommunicate me--ME--William, the son of Robert the Devil!  Ha, by God's splendour, Mauger shall live to wish the father stood, in the foul fiend's true likeness, by his side, rather than brave the bent brow of the son!\"  \"Dread my lord,\" said Fitzosborne, desisting from his employ, and rising to his feet; \"thou knowest that I am thy true friend and leal knight; thou knowest how I have aided thee in this marriage with the lady of Flanders, and how gravely I think that what pleases thy fancy will guard thy realm; but rather than brave the order of the Church, and the ban of the Pope, I would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7673"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 02 (#3)"],["body","thee wed to the poorest virgin in Normandy.\"  William, who had been pacing the room like an enraged lion in his den, halted in amaze at this bold speech.  \"This from thee, William Fitzosborne!--from thee!  I tell thee, that if all the priests in Christendom, and all the barons in France, stood between me and my bride, I would hew my way through the midst.  Foes invade my realm--let them; princes conspire against me--I smile in scorn; subjects mutiny--this strong hand can punish, or this large heart can forgive.  All these are the dangers which he who governs men should prepare to meet; but man has a right to his love, as the stag to his hind.  And he who wrongs me here, is foe and traitor to me, not as Norman Duke but as human being.  Look to it--thou and thy proud barons, look to it!\"  \"Proud may thy barons be,\" said Fitzosborne, reddening, and with a brow that quailed not before his lord's; \"for they are the sons of those who carved out the realm of the Norman, and owned in Rou but the feudal chief of free warriors; vassals are not villeins.  And that which we hold our duty--whether to Church or chief--that, Duke William, thy proud barons will doubtless do; nor less, believe me, for threats which, braved in discharge of duty and defence of freedom, we hold as air.\"  The Duke gazed on his haughty subject with an eye in which a meaner spirit might have seen its doom.  The veins in his broad temples swelled like cords, and a light foam gathered round his quivering lips.  But fiery and fearless as William was, not less was he sagacious and profound.  In that one man he saw the representative of that superb and matchless chivalry--that race of races--those men of men, in whom the brave acknowledge the highest example of valiant deeds, and the free the manliest assertion of noble thoughts [64], since the day when the last Athenian covered his head with his mantle, and mutely died: and far from being the most stubborn against his will, it was to Fitzosborne's paramount influence with the council, that he had often owed their submission to his wishes, and their contributions to his wars.  In the very tempest of his wrath, he felt that the blow belonged to strike on that bold head would shiver his ducal throne to the dust.  Be felt too, that awful indeed was that power of the Church which could thus turn against him the heart of his truest knight: and he began (for with all his outward frankness his temper was suspicious) to wrong the great-souled noble by the thought that he might already be won over by the enemies whom Mauger had arrayed against his nuptials.  Therefore, with one of those rare and mighty efforts of that dissimulation which debased his character, but achieved his fortunes, he cleared his brow of its dark cloud, and said in a low voice, that was not without its pathos:  \"Had an angel from heaven forewarned me that William Fitzosborne would speak thus to his kinsman and brother in arms, in the hour of need and the agony of passion, I would have disbelieved him.  Let it pass----\"  But ere the last word was out of his lips, Fitzosborne had fallen on his knees before the Duke, and, clasping his hand, exclaimed, while the tears rolled down his swarthy cheek, \"Pardon, pardon, my liege! when thou speakest thus my heart melts.  What thou willest, that will I!  Church or Pope, no matter.  Send me to Flanders; I will bring back thy bride.\"  The slight smile that curved William's lip, showed that he was scarce worthy of that sublime weakness in his friend.  But he cordially pressed the hand that grasped his own, and said, \"Rise; thus should brother speak to brother.\"  Then--for his wrath was only concealed, not stifled, and yearned for its vent--his eye fell upon the delicate and thoughtful face of the priest, who had watched this short and stormy conference in profound silence, despite Taillefer's whispers to him to interrupt the dispute.  \"So, priest,\" he said, \"I remember me that when Mauger before let loose his rebellious tongue thou didst lend thy pedant learning to eke out his brainless treason.  Methought that I then banished thee my realm?\"  \"Not so, Count and Seigneur,\" answered the ecclesiastic, with a grave but arch smile on his lip; \"let me remind thee, that to speed me back to my native land thou didst graciously send me a horse, halting on three legs, and all lame on the fourth.  Thus mounted, I met thee on my road.  I saluted thee; so did the beast, for his head well nigh touched the ground.  Whereon I did ask thee, in a Latin play of words, to give me at least a quadruped, not a tripod, for my journey. [65] Gracious, even in ire, and with relenting laugh, was thine answer.  My liege, thy words implied banishment--thy laughter pardon.  So I stayed.\"  Despite his wrath, William could scarce repress a smile; but recollecting himself, he replied, more gravely, \"Peace with this levity, priest.  Doubtless thou art the envoy from this scrupulous Mauger, or some other of my gentle clergy; and thou comest, as doubtless, with soft words and whining homilies.  It is in vain.  I hold the Church in holy reverence; the pontiff knows it.  But Matilda of Flanders I have wooed; and Matilda of Flanders shall sit by my side in the halls of Rouen, or on the deck of my war-ship, till it anchors on a land worthy to yield a new domain to the son of the Sea-king.\"  \"In the halls of Rouen--and it may be on the throne of England--shall Matilda reign by the side of William,\" said the priest in a clear, low, and emphatic voice; \"and it was to tell my lord the Duke that I repent me of my first unconsidered obeisance to Mauger as my spiritual superior; that since then I have myself examined canon and precedent; and though the letter of the law be against thy spousals, it comes precisely under the category of those alliances to which the fathers of the Church accord dispensation:--it is to tell thee this, that I, plain Doctor of Laws and priest of Pavia, have crossed the seas.\"  \"Ha Rou!--Ha Rou!\" cried Taillefer, with his usual bluffness, and laughing with great glee, \"why wouldst thou not listen to me, monseigneur?\"  \"If thou deceivest me not,\" said William, in surprise, \"and thou canst make good thy words, no prelate in Neustria, save Odo of Bayeux, shall lift his head high as thine.\"  And here William, deeply versed in the science of men, bent his eyes keenly upon the unchanging and earnest face of the speaker.  \"Ah,\" he burst out, as if satisfied with the survey, \"and my mind tells me that thou speakest not thus boldly and calmly without ground sufficient.  Man, I like thee.  Thy name?  I forget it.\"  \"Lanfranc of Pavia, please you my lord; called some times 'Lanfranc the Scholar' in thy cloister of Bec.  Nor misdeem me, that I, humble, unmitred priest, should be thus bold.  In birth I am noble, and my kindred stand near to the grace of our ghostly pontiff; to the pontiff I myself am not unknown.  Did I desire honours, in Italy I might seek them; it is not so.  I crave no guerdon for the service I proffer; none but this--leisure and books in the Convent of Bec.\"  \"Sit down--nay, sit, man,\" said William, greatly interested, but still suspicious.  \"One riddle only I ask thee to solve, before I give thee all my trust, and place my very heart in thy hands.  Why, if thou desirest not rewards, shouldst thou thus care to serve me--thou, a foreigner?\"  A light, brilliant and calm, shone in the eyes of the scholar, and a blush spread over his pale cheeks.  \"My Lord Prince, I will answer in plain words.  But first permit me to be the questioner.\"  The priest turned towards Fitzosborne, who had seated himself on a stool at William's feet, and, leaning his chin on his hand, listened to the ecclesiastic, not more with devotion to his calling, than wonder at the influence one so obscure was irresistibly gaining over his own martial spirit, and William's iron craft.  \"Lovest thou not, William Lord of Breteuil, lovest thou not fame for the sake of fame?\"  \"Sur mon ame--yes!\" said the Baron.  \"And thou, Taillefer the minstrel, lovest thou not song for the sake of song?\"  \"For song alone,\" replied the mighty minstrel.  \"More gold in one ringing rhyme than in all the coffers of Christendom.\"  \"And marvellest thou, reader of men's hearts,\" said the scholar, turning once more to William, \"that the student loves knowledge for the sake of knowledge?  Born of high race, poor in purse, and slight of thews, betimes I found wealth in books, and drew strength from lore.  I heard of the Count of Rouen and the Normans, as a prince of small domain, with a measureless spirit, a lover of letters, and a captain in war.  I came to thy duchy, I noted its subjects and its prince, and the words of Themistocles rang in my ear: 'I cannot play the lute, but I can make a small state great.'  I felt an interest in thy strenuous and troubled career.  I believe that knowledge, to spread amongst the nations, must first find a nursery in the brain of kings; and I saw in the deed-doer, the agent of the thinker.  In those espousals, on which with untiring obstinacy thy heart is set, I might sympathise with thee; perchance\"--(here a melancholy smile flitted over the student's pale lips), \"perchance even as a lover: priest though I be now, and dead to human love, once I loved, and I know what it is to strive in hope, and to waste in despair.  But my sympathy, I own, was more given to the prince than to the lover.  It was natural that I, priest and foreigner, should obey at first the orders of Mauger, archprelate and spiritual chief, and the more so as the law was with him; but when I resolved to stay despite thy sentence which banished me, I resolved to aid thee; for if with Mauger was the dead law, with thee was the living cause of man.  Duke William, on thy nuptials with Matilda of Flanders rests thy duchy--rest, perchance, the mightier sceptres that are yet to come.  Thy title disputed, thy principality new and unestablished, thou, above all men, must link thy new "]]]
