That was the presence, the whole of the time, in the motley-coloured crowd, of one of the diabolical trio in question.  This very devil no sooner heard the question raised about the coloured feathers in their head gear, than he doffed his hat unperceived and pulled out the feather.  And then, as the controversy grew warmer, he sneaked off.  He made all possible haste for the garden gate.  Once here he was about to rush through, when he was accosted by two men, whose uniform gave him an unpleasant twinge.  They were gendarmes.  \"You cannot leave the ground yet, sir,\" said one of them sharply.  \"I don't wish to,\" replied the devil, promptly. \"I come to bring you orders.\"  \"I beg your pardon,\" said the gendarme.  \"A robbery has been committed.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"That is the reason you have had your orders to guard the gate. Oh, you know it. Well, what you don't know is that the robbery is supposed to have been committed by a masker dressed as I am. Take particular note of my dress.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  The gendarme grinned as he said this.  \"Keep your eyes open. These are the contessa's particular orders.\"  \"Trust me, sir.\"  \"There is a reward if you capture the thief.\"  The gendarme laughed at this, and said, with an air of self-confidence--\"I think I shall get him.\"  The merry devil slapped the gendarme upon the back heartily.  \"You are the sort of man for my money.\"  Saying which, he turned and left the spot.  Making his way to a place in the grounds previously agreed upon, he ran across the brigand Matteo armed with a change of dress for him.  The spot selected was up one of the narrowest alleys in the grounds, at the end of which was a species of Hampton Court maze in miniature.  Just as the diabolical one was about to divest himself of half of his skin, Matteo gave the alarm.  \"The devil!\" ejaculated the masker, which was, perhaps, the most natural exclamation he could make, all things considered. \"What can this be? Somebody watched me here.\"  He waited a minute or so in anxiety.  An unsteady footfall was heard upon the gravel walk, and a man in a cloak came staggering along.  \"They may call this a grand _fÃªte_ if they like,\" he mumbled. \"I call it a shabby affair. Why, there's not a respectable drink in the place. The lucky thing is that I have provided my own.\"  He had a bottle with him, and he sucked at it from time to time as he staggered on, until all of a sudden he ran on to the alarmed masker, who was growing impatient to change his garments.  The staggering one looked up, and seeing such an alarming figure towering over him, he gave a wild howl and fled.  \"The devil! the devil!\" he shouted wildly. \"Help! help!\"  \"Stop that fool, Matteo, or he will bring the whole house down about our ears.\"  Matteo seized the merrymaker, and was about to make short work with him, when his superior held his hand.  \"Put by your knife,\" he said; \"not that. Hold him tight and threaten him; but no knife.\"  But for this timely interference, it would have gone hard with the unfortunate new-comer, who was our old friend Mole.  Mole, it should be noted, had been compelled to change his cork legs, on which he could scarcely stand, for his old, familiar stumps, which Harvey had brought with him in case any accident should occur.  \"Forgive me, Mr. Devil,\" he implored, in drunken tones, \"oh, forgive me.\"  \"Mole!\" exclaimed the devil, in a thrilling voice, \"your evil deeds are known to me.\"  \"Oh, oh, oh!\" groaned the wretched Isaac, piteously.  \"Your time has come.\"  \"Mercy, mercy!\" gasped Mole.  \"Never.\"  \"Give me a little time, Mr. Devil.\"  \"No.\"  \"Oh, do, do, for the sake of my twins,\" said Mole, in his most persuasive manner, \"and I'll stand any thing you like to--hic--to name. Don't take me away, but come and liquor up with me.\"  \"Silence!\" thundered the irritable devil  \"I'm dumb.\"  \"Away with you, and repent.\"  Mole staggered off.  As soon as he was gone, Matteo assisted his master to change his garments, and in the space of five minutes at the outside, the devil disappeared, and was replaced by a gay cavalier, habited in a rich costume of blue slashed with amber, and a broad-brimmed sombrero.  The excitement occasioned by the impudent robbery of the contessa Maraviglia's jewels had not by any means subsided, so the confusion prevailing in consequence was highly favourable to Hunston's new villany for trapping little Emily.  Nearing the entrance to the ball-room, he came to a conservatory, into which Mr. Mole had strolled, or let us say staggered, and then dropped into a seat.  Hunston glided in unperceived by Mole, and concealed himself behind some thick shrubs close to him.  Mole was bent upon making himself comfortable.  The irrepressible bottle was out again.  \"I feel,\" mumbled Mole, little thinking there was a listener near, \"I feel that I am a devil of a fellow. All the ladies love me, and all the men fear me. I'm too much for anyone of them, ha, ha, ha! I've taken a rise out of the devil himself.\"  Here he had a suck at the bottle.  \"I'm getting quite familiar with evil spirits to-night,\" he said grinning; \"I don't think he will see me again in a hurry--he, he!\" He raised the bottle again to his lips, when a ghostly voice sounded in his ear--  \"Beware!\"  He turned pale, and then got very red in the face.  \"Who's there?\" said Mole, looking nervously round; \"come in, don't knock; what a fool I am.\"  \"Remember!\" said the same hollow voice as before.  \"Oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!\" cried Mole; \"I'm gone; he's there again.\"  \"Beware!\"  \"I'm gone, I'm going,\" cried Mole; \"oh, Lor', oh, Lor'!\"  And off he ran, Hunston following closely behind him.  Now Hunston got near enough to him to see that he was really trying to get little Emily and Paquita to take care of him for a time, and walk with him in the grounds.  \"There will be two of them to take care of,\" said Hunston, following them up as closely as was prudent; \"that complicates matters. I hope Matteo has taken his measures carefully.\"  Matteo had.  They drew near to the entrance of the maze, and then Hunston began to look anxiously about him for Matteo and the rest of their accomplices.  \"I think we had better return,\" he heard little Emily say.  Suddenly a whistle was blown, and five or six men sprang out from the maze.  In less time than it takes to record the outrage, the two girls were seized and borne off in stout, relentless arms, their cries being stifled by thick wraps thrown over their heads.  \"To the small gate,\" exclaimed Hunston.  Mole recognised the familiar voice of Hunston, and the whole danger flashed into his mind at once, sobering him most effectually.  \"Hunston, you villain, I know you!\" he cried. \"And I will lose my life rather than harm should come to these dear girls.\"  Hunston turned and faced him savagely.  \"If you know me, Mole,\" he said meaningly, \"then beware of me.\"  Mole's only reply was to grapple with him with all his strength.  But the foolish old man was hurled to the ground, and then one of the brigands fell upon him, brandishing a huge knife.  Hunston here interfered, and gave a command which made the men laugh very heartily.  A fresh outrage was perpetrated, and in the space of two minutes, Mr. Mole found himself alone, and on his back.  \"Hunston, you black-hearted thief,\" he cried, \"I'll follow you if--\"  He tried to rise, but down he went again.  He was lop-sided.  And why?  The brigands had amputated one of his wooden legs.         *       *       *       *       *  Leaving them for a moment, let us return to Mathias.  That daring scoundrel was not satisfied with having escaped a great danger scot free, and made a very rich prize, but he must needs return to the Palazzo Maraviglia in another dress, in quest of fresh plunder.  The fact was that he was flushed with wine.  Else he would have thought twice of returning.  Mingling with the crowd in the large ball-room, he came to a group discussing the late robbery in great excitement, and as he was pressing forward to learn what he could, he became entangled in a lady's lace flounces.  He turned sharply to apologise, and recognised the figure at once.  \"The lovely Marietta,\" Mathias exclaimed.  She heard him, and made off to the other end of the room, closely followed by Mathias, who had conceived a violent fancy for her.  \"Stay, Senorita,\" he exclaimed, seizing her hand.  \"What do you want with me?\" said Marietta.  \"Only to plead--\"  \"Nonsense,\" she exclaimed, interrupting him abruptly; \"you don't know me.\"  \"Let me plead--\"  \"Bother!\"  \"Nay,\" said the persistent robber, \"if you will not hear me speak, hear me sing.\"  And then, being an admirable mimic, he imitated her strut before the looking-glass, and general coquettish behaviour in the dressing-room at the villa, while he sang in a falsetto voice--                          \"Sweet Marietta,                            Rarely has been                          A sweeter or better                            Face or form seen.                          Dear Marietta!\"  \"Hah!\" cried the girl, starting back as if she had been shot.  Her first impulse was to faint.  But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7335"],["title","Jack Harkaway and His Son's Escape from the Brigands of Greece (#5)"],["body","soon as she gained the cooler air without, she recovered, and collecting her senses a little, she gave a pretty shrewd guess at the truth.  She was silly, yet not a bad-natured girl.  She saw her duty plainly enough.  She must make herself known at once to her master.  Harkaway was close at hand, discussing the robbery still with Jefferson.  The whole of this party were of course known to Marietta; so she made straight up to Harkaway, and said hurriedly--  \"Have that man seized, sir--see, that one who is following me. I am Marietta. He has just said something to me which convinces me that he was hiding in the villa to-night.\"  \"Hullo!\" exclaimed Harkaway, not a little startled at this sudden address; \"why, what in Heaven's name--\"  \"Lose no time,\" interrupted Marietta eagerly, \"or he will go--see, he has taken the alarm.\"  \"The girl's right,\" said Jefferson, striding off after Mathias.  The latter now began to perceive that he had made a false step, and he hurried through the crowded room towards the door, and was just passing out, when a dwarfed and ugly figure leaped upon him.  So sudden was the attack that Mathias was capsized, and together they rolled upon the floor.  \"Let go!\" said the Greek fiercely, \"or I'll--\"  \"Not me!\" exclaimed Magog Brand--for he was the Greek's assailant. \"I know you, my yellow-feathered devil, even though you have shed your skin!\"  \"Let go,\" hissed the Greek brigand, with compressed lips, \"or I'll have your life!\"  \"I'll not let go,\" cried the brave little Brand. \"I have got you, villain, and will hold you. Ah!\"  Mathias scrambled up, and tried to fly, but he was met with a blow from Jefferson's fist which might have felled an ox in the shambles.  He dropped lifeless on the ground beside Magog,  And then a sudden outcry arose, for it was found that in that brief struggle poor Magog Brand had been cruelly used.  A long-bladed poignard was buried up to the hilt in his side.  Poor Brand.  Death must have been almost instantaneous.  They tore the mask from Mathias' face, and thereupon an agent of the secret police stepped forward and made known who it was.  \"This is the notorious Mathias,\" he said. \"One of the most daring of the brigands hereabouts; we have been wanting him badly for some time past.\"  \"You have got him,\" said Harkaway, \"but oh!\" he added, glancing at the lifeless form of Magog Brand, \"at what a price for us!\"  At this juncture Harvey reached the spot, and taking in the whole scene at a glance, he dropped on his knees beside the body of Magog Brand, where Jefferson was already kneeling, seemingly half stupefied by the catastrophe.  \"He has fainted,\" said he to Harvey.  Harvey shook his head mournfully.  \"He'll never faint again, Jefferson.\"  \"What?\"  \"Never.\"  \"You surely--no, no, Brand, dear old boy, look up.\"  He faltered and broke down.  \"Yes, Jefferson,\" said Harvey in deep emotion. \"Poor Magog Brand is at the end of his troubles and pleasures alike--he is dead!\"  [Illustration: \"'MURDER! ABDUCTION! SHOUTED MOLE HUNSTON IS HERE\"--ADV IN GREECE VOL II PAGE 39.]     CHAPTER V.  THE PURSUIT OF THE BRIGANDS--THE BATTLE--VARYING FORTUNES--HOW HUNSTON AND TORO WERE LAID BY THE HEELS.   Consternation was upon every face.  The catastrophe was so sudden and unlocked for, that the people about were half stupefied with fear.  On one side lay poor Magog Brand, lately so full of life and animation.  On the other was his assassin, felled by the dead man's best friend, the doughty Jefferson, and with scarcely more life in him than his victim.  And while the people were staring hopelessly at each other thus, a voice was heard giving the alarm hard by.  \"Poor Brand, your murderer shall not escape,\" said Jefferson bitterly.  The noise continued, and presently the voice was recognised.  \"It is Mole,\" cried Harkaway.  He was right.  Just then the poor old gentleman appeared upon the scene.  \"Harkaway, Jefferson, Harvey!\" he cried.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"Murder!\" returned Mole. \"Hunston is here.\"  \"By Heaven! I thought it,\" ejaculated Jefferson.  \"He has carried off Emily and Paquita.\"  \"What?\"  \"I interfered, but they were too many for me. See how they have used me.\"  \"Was he with the brigands?\" demanded Harkaway.  \"I suppose so. A whole mob of ruffians.\"  \"Where are they gone?\"  \"By the small gate.\"  A hurried explanation ensued with the agent of the secret police, who gave them a few words of comfort.  \"He'll never be able to pass my men at the gate,\" said the officer, with great confidence.  This was doubtful.  They knew too well Hunston's boldness and audacity.  But they lost no time in getting up a pursuit.  The contessa's stables were well furnished, and two horses were speedily saddled for Harkaway and Jefferson.  Harvey, too impatient to wait for a mount, had rushed wildly away in the direction of the small gate, followed by Mr. Mole.  Here he saw to his dismay that a scramble had taken place, in which the gendarmes had got decidedly the worst of it.  The two who had been on guard at the gate had got very roughly handled, one having a broken crown and the other showing an ugly wound in the side.  \"They have gone this way, then?\" exclaimed Harvey, eagerly.  \"Yes.\"  \"Which way?\"  \"They made for the right,\" faltered one of the wounded men.  \"Is it long?\"  \"No; a few moments.\"  \"They can not get far,\" said the gendarme with the broken pate; \"the two girls were struggling hard with him.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried Harvey. \"I'll save my child yet.\"  \"You are not the first in the hunt,\" said the other gendarme, speaking with evident pain; \"there are two black men after them.\"  \"That must be Sunday and Monday,\" exclaimed Harvey.  And off he ran.  He bounded over the ground like a deer, and when he got about half a mile further on, he came suddenly upon two men struggling.  One of them was a negro.  Who, in fact, but our old friend the Prince of Limbi, the faithful Monday?  The other was one of the Greeks, a face unknown to Harvey, but one who has already figured in these pages.  Matteo!  And lying on the ground near him was a brigand struck down dead by brave Monday.  As Harvey came up, it was nearing the end of what had been a precious tough fight. Monday was uppermost, and Matteo, who had gradually succumbed to the wiry negro, was by this time in a very queer way indeed.  Monday held him by the throat, and in spite of his desperate efforts to set himself free, Matteo had lost his breath.  And there he lay completely at the negro's mercy.  \"There, you dam tief!\" exclaimed the Prince of Limbi, \"take dat, an' dat, an' dat, an' now, be golly, have dis for a little bit in.\"  At every word he pressed harder and harder and jerked his adversary back.  The \"little bit in\" settled Matteo completely.  Something seemed to crack in the wretched Greek's throat, and he dropped back.  \"Monday, Monday!\" said Harvey, eagerly, \"where are they?\"  \"Hullo, Massa Dick!\" said faithful Monday; \"I'se gwine to give this fellar toko an' den I'll jine yar.\"  \"He's done for,\" said Dick, hastily. \"Come now.\"  \"He might come too,\" said Monday, in some doubt.  \"No fear.\"  \"Perhaps.\"  \"Why, he'll never trouble anyone more,\" returned Harvey; \"tell me, where have they gone?\"  \"They went straight on.\"  \"This road?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Good. Come or stay. I'll go,\" exclaimed Harvey.  And off he ran.  Monday gave his silent enemy a shake to see if it was all over.  \"He's a gone coon,\" he said to himself. \"I'll bolt off after Massa Dick.\"  Away he ran at a good swinging trot.  In about ten minutes more he came up with him.  And this was under the most alarming circumstances.  Not very long after this a horseman dashed up to the spot, and only drew rein to give a glance at the lifeless form of the wretched Matteo.  \"He's dead,\" said the horseman, who was none other than Jack Harkaway. \"This looks like some of Dick's handiwork. Dick or some of our party. I hope Dick is safe.\" Saying which, he whipped up his horse, and tore on at a mad gallop.  A very few moments after this he came up with the brigands with their captives.  Just in the nick of time.  Hunston and Toro were there both with their hands full, while the Greeks had all their work to do to take care of the two captive girls.  Little Emily and Paquita, having now recovered from their surprise, were lending assistance to the cause by keeping all the Greeks fully occupied in looking after them.  And while they were thus occupied, Sunday and Dick Harvey were engaged with Toro and Hunston.  Dick had rushed so violently upon Hunston that the latter was toppled over, and it looked as though Harvey was about to make short work with their old enemy.  But alas for Sunday!  The poor negro was overmatched.  His heart was good, but the weight and enormous strength of the Italian were too much for him to vanquish.  That he had not as yet succumbed to Toro, was due only to his vastly superior agility and activity.  It was all in vain for the Italian ruffian to try and close with him.  Sunday would not have this.  He knew that his chance lay in keeping Toro at a respectful distance.  And so he danced round him, dropping in an occasional smart rap which goaded the Italian to fury.  \"Help!\" cried Hunston. \"Cut him down! cut him down!\"  One of the brigands rushed at Harvey knife in hand, and thus created a momentary diversion in his favour.  Had not Harkaway just then appeared upon the scene it might have gone hard with his comrade Dick.  Prompt, however, to act at this critical juncture, Harkaway spurred his horse into the group and rode them down.  Then reining up, he flung himself from his horse, and went into the melee.  \"I'm in it, Dick, old boy,\" cried Jack; \"here's one for Harkaway.\"  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Dick, in great excitement. \"A Harkaway! a Harkaway to the rescue!\"  Toro turned to Harkaway with a cry of rage.  \"Curse you!\" he exclaimed; \"I'll have your life now, or you shall have mine.\"  \"By all means,\" said old Jack, cheerfully.  \"Cur!\"  \"Come, now,\" said Harkaway, with subdued rage, \"I "]]]
