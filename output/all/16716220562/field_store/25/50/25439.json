But,\" added the knight, colouring, \"I forgot that he is not advised of my name and land; and, indeed, sith thou art to be spokesman, I marvel why Harold should have prayed my service at all, at the risk of subjecting a Norman knight to affronts contumelious.\"  \"Peradventure,\" replied Evan, \"peradventure thou hast something to whisper apart to the King, which, as stranger and warrior, none will venture to question; but which from me, as countryman and priest, would excite the jealous suspicions of those around him.\"  \"I conceive thee,\" said De Graville.  \"And see, spears are gleaming down the path; and per pedes Domini, yon chief with the mantle, and circlet of gold on his head, is the cat-king that so spitted and scratched in the melee last night.\"  \"Heed well thy tongue,\" said Evan, alarmed; \"no jests with the leader of men.\"  \"Knowest thou, good monk, that a facete and most gentil Roman (if the saintly writer from whom I take the citation reports aright--for, alas! I know not where myself to purchase, or to steal, one copy of Horatius Flaccus) hath said 'Dulce est desipere in loco.'  It is sweet to jest, but not within reach of claws, whether of kaisars or cats.\"  Therewith the knight drew up his spare but stately figure, and arranging his robe with grace and dignity, awaited the coming chief.  Down the paths, one by one, came first the chiefs, privileged by birth to attend the King; and each, as he reached the mouth of the pass, drew on the upper side, among the stones of the rough ground.  Then a banner, tattered and torn, with the lion ensign that the Welch princes had substituted for the old national dragon, which the Saxon of Wessex had appropriated to themselves [171], preceded the steps of the King. Behind him came his falconer and bard, and the rest of his scanty household.  The King halted in the pass, a few steps from the Norman knight; and Mallet de Graville, though accustomed to the majestic mien of Duke William, and the practised state of the princes of France and Flanders, felt an involuntary thrill of admiration at the bearing of the great child of Nature with his foot on his father's soil.  Small and slight as was his stature, worn and ragged his mantle of state, there was that in the erect mien and steady eye of the Cymrian hero, which showed one conscious of authority, and potent in will; and the wave of his hand to the knight was the gesture of a prince on his throne.  Nor, indeed, was that brave and ill-fated chief without some irregular gleams of mental cultivation, which under happier auspices, might have centred into steadfast light.  Though the learning which had once existed in Wales (the last legacy of Rome) had long since expired in broil and blood, and youths no longer flocked to the colleges of Caerleon, and priests no longer adorned the casuistical theology of the age, Gryffyth himself, the son of a wise and famous father [172], had received an education beyond the average of Saxon kings.  But, intensely national, his mind had turned from all other literature, to the legends, and songs, and chronicles of his land; and if he is the best scholar who best understands his own tongue and its treasures, Gryffyth was the most erudite prince of his age.  His natural talents, for war especially, were considerable; and judged fairly--not as mated with an empty treasury, without other army than the capricious will of his subjects afforded, and amidst his bitterest foes in the jealous chiefs of his own country, against the disciplined force and comparative civilisation of the Saxon--but as compared with all the other princes of Wales, in warfare, to which he was habituated, and in which chances were even, the fallen son of Llewellyn had been the most renowned leader that Cymry had known since the death of the great Roderic.  So there he stood; his attendants ghastly with famine, drawn up on the unequal ground; above, on the heights, and rising from the stone crags, long lines of spears artfully placed; and, watching him with deathful eyes, somewhat in his rear, the Traitor Three.  \"Speak, father, or chief,\" said the Welch King in his native tongue; \"what would Harold the Earl of Gryffyth the King?\"  Then the monk took up the word and spoke.  \"Health to Gryffyth-ap-Llewellyn, his chiefs and his people!  Thus saith Harold, King Edward's thegn:  By land all the passes are watched; by sea all the waves are our own.  Our swords rest in our sheaths; but famine marches each hour to gride and to slay.  Instead of sure death from the hunger, take sure life from the foe.  Free pardon to all, chiefs and people, and safe return to their homes,-- save Gryffyth alone.  Let him come forth, not as victim and outlaw, not with bent form and clasped hands, but as chief meeting chief, with his household of state.  Harold will meet him, in honour, at the gates of the fort.  Let Gryffyth submit to King Edward, and ride with Harold to the Court of the Basileus.  Harold promises him life, and will plead for his pardon.  And though the peace of this realm, and the fortune of war, forbid Harold to say, 'Thou shalt yet be a king;' yet thy crown, son of Llewellyn, shall at least be assured in the line of thy fathers, and the race of Cadwallader shall still reign in Cymry.\"  The monk paused, and hope and joy were in the faces of the famished chiefs; while two of the Traitor Three suddenly left their post, and sped to tell the message to the spearmen and multitudes above. Modred, the third conspirator, laid his hand on his hilt, and stole near to see the face of the King;--the face of the King was dark and angry, as a midnight of storm.  Then, raising the cross on high, Evan resumed.  \"And I, though of the people of Gwentland, which the arms of Gryffyth have wasted, and whose prince fell beneath Gryffyth's sword on the hearth of his hall--I, as God's servant, the brother of all I behold, and, as son of the soil, mourning over the slaughter of its latest defenders--I, by this symbol of love and command, which I raise to the heaven, adjure thee, O King, to give ear to the mission of peace,--to cast down the grim pride of earth.  And instead of the crown of a day, fix thy hopes on the crown everlasting.  For much shall be pardoned to thee in thine hour of pomp and of conquest, if now thou savest from doom and from death the last lives over which thou art lord.\"  It was during this solemn appeal that the knight, marking the sign announced to him, and drawing close to Gryffyth, pressed the ring into the King's hand, and whispered:  \"Obey by this pledge.  Thou knowest Harold is true, and thy head is sold by thine own people.\"  The King cast a haggard eye at the speaker, and then at the ring, over which his hand closed with a convulsive spasm.  And at that dread instant the man prevailed over the King; and far away from people and monk, from adjuration and duty, fled his heart on the wings of the storm--fled to the cold wife he distrusted: and the pledge that should assure him of life, seemed as a love-token insulting his fall:--Amidst all the roar of roused passions, loudest of all was the hiss of the jealous fiend.  As the monk ceased, the thrill of the audience was perceptible, and a deep silence was followed by a general murmur, as if to constrain the King.  Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man.  The red spot flushed the dark cheek, and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow.  He made one stride towards the monk, and said, in a voice loud, and deep, and slow, rolling far up the hill:  \"Monk, thou hast said; and now hear the reply of the son of Llewellyn, the true heir of Roderic the Great, who from the heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cymrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther.  King was I born, and king will I die.  I will not ride by the side of the Saxon to the feet of Edward, the son of the spoiler.  I will not, to purchase base life, surrender the claim, vain before men and the hour, but solemn before God and posterity--the claim of my line and my people.  All Britain is ours--all the island of Pines.  And the children of Hengist are traitors and rebels--not the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther.  Say to Harold the Saxon, Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle; but freedom and royalty are ours, in life and in death--not for you to demand them, not for us to betray.  Nor fear ye, O my chiefs, few, but unmatched in glory and truth; fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom, on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields!  No, die we may, but not mute and revengeless.  Go back, whispering warrior; go back, false son of Cymry--and tell Harold to look well to his walls and his trenches.  We will vouchsafe him grace for his grace--we will not take him by surprise, nor under cloud of the night.  With the gleam of our spears and the clash of our shields, we will come from the hill: and, famine-worn as he deems us, hold a feast in his walls which the eagles of Snowdon spread their pinions to share!\"  \"Rash man and unhappy!\" cried the monk; \"what curse drawest thou down on thy head!  Wilt thou be the murtherer of thy men, in strife unavailing and vain?  Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt cause to be shed.\"  \"Be dumb!--hush thy screech, lying raven!\" exclaimed Gryffyth, his eyes darting fire and, his slight form dilating.  \"Once, priest and monk went before us to inspire, not to daunt; and our cry, Alleluia! was taught us by "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7678"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 07 (#6)"],["body","saints of the Church, on the day when Saxons, fierce and many as Harold's, fell on the field of Maes-Garmon.  No, the curse is on the head of the invader, not on those who defend hearth and altar.  Yea, as the song to the bard, the CURSE leaps through my veins, and rushes forth from my lips.  By the land they have ravaged; by the gore they have spilt; on these crags, our last refuge; below the carn on yon heights, where the Dead stir to hear me,--I launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist!  They in turn shall know the steel of the stranger--their crown shall be shivered as glass, and their nobles be as slaves in the land.  And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire.  And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide, appeased, over the grave of their nation.  But we--WE, though weak in the body, in the soul shall be strong to the last!  The ploughshare may pass over our cities, but the soil shall be trod by our steps, and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards.  Nor in the great Judgment Day, shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth, to answer for the sins of the brave!\" [173]  So impressive the voice, so grand the brow, and sublime the wild gesture of the King, as he thus spoke, that not only the monk himself was awed; not only, though he understood not the words, did the Norman knight bow his head, as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloud,--but even the sullen and wide- spreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment.  But the spearmen and multitude above, excited by the tidings of safety to life, and worn out by repeated defeat, and the dread fear of famine, too remote to hear the King, were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators, creeping from rank to rank; and already they began to sway and move, and sweep slowly down towards the King.  Recovering his surprise, the Norman again neared Gryffyth, and began to re-urge his mission of peace.  But the chief waved him back sternly, and said aloud, though in Saxon:  \"No secrets can pass between Harold and me.  This much alone, take thou back as answer: I thank the Earl, for myself, my Queen, and my people.  Noble have been his courtesies, as foe; as foe I thank him-- as king, defy.  The torque he hath returned to my hand, he shall see again ere the sun set.  Messengers, ye are answered.  Withdraw, and speed fast, that we may pass not your steps on the road.\"  The monk sighed, and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle; and a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there, that the King was alone in his fierce defiance.  Then lifting again the rood, he turned away, and with him went the Norman.  The retirement of the messengers was the signal for one burst of remonstrance from the chiefs--the signal for the voice and the deeds of the Fatal Three.  Down from the heights sprang and rushed the angry and turbulent multitudes; round the King came the bard and the falconer, and some faithful few.  The great uproar of many voices caused the monk and the knight to pause abruptly in their descent, and turn to look behind.  They could see the crowd rushing down from the higher steeps; but on the spot itself which they had so lately left, the nature of the ground only permitted a confused view of spear points, lifted swords, and heads crowned with shaggy locks, swaying to and fro.  \"What means all this commotion?\" asked the knight, with his hand on his sword.  \"Hist!\" said the monk, pale as ashes, and leaning for support upon the cross.  Suddenly, above the hubbub, was heard the voice of the King, in accents of menace and wrath, singularly distinct and clear; it was followed by a moment's silence--a moment's silence followed by the clatter of arms, a yell, and a howl, and the indescribable shock of men.  And suddenly again was heard a voice that seemed that of the King, but no longer distinct and clear!--was it laugh?--was it groan?  All was hushed; the monk was on his knees in prayer; the knight's sword was bare in his hand.  All was hushed--and the spears stood still in the air; when there was again a cry, as multitudinous, but less savage than before.  And the Welch came down the pass, and down the crags.  The knight placed his back to a rock.  \"They have orders to murther us,\" he murmured; \"but woe to the first who come within reach of my sword!\"  Down swarmed the Welchmen, nearer and nearer; and in the midst of them three chiefs--the Fatal Three.  And the old chief bore in his hand a pole or spear, and on the top of that spear, trickling gore step by step, was the trunkless head of Gryffyth the King.  \"This,\" said the old chief, as he drew near, \"this is our answer to Harold the Earl.  We will go with ye.\"  \"Food! food!\" cried the multitude.  And the three chiefs (one on either side the trunkless head that the third bore aloft) whispered, \"We are avenged!\""]]]
