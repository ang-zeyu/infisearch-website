And the next thing against your Norman is (added the abbot, with a sly wink), that he is a close man, who loves not his stoup; now, I say, that a priest never has more hold over a sinner than when he makes the sinner open his heart to him.\"  \"That's clear!\" said a fat priest, with a lubricate and shining nose.  \"And how,\" pursued the abbot triumphantly, \"can a sinner open his heavy heart until you have given him something to lighten it?  Oh, many and many a wretched man have I comforted spiritually over a flagon of stout ale; and many a good legacy to the Church hath come out of a friendly wassail between watchful shepherd and strayed sheep! But what hast thou there?\" resumed the abbot, turning to a man, clad in the lay garb of a burgess of London, who had just entered the room, followed by a youth, bearing what seemed a coffer, covered with a fine linen cloth.  \"Holy father!\" said the burgess, wiping his forehead, \"it is a treasure so great, that I trow Hugoline, the King's treasurer, will scowl at me for a year to come, for he likes to keep his own grip on the King's gold.\"  At this indiscreet observation, the abbot, the monks, and all the priestly bystanders looked grim and gloomy, for each had his own special design upon the peace of poor Hugoline, the treasurer, and liked not to see him the prey of a layman.  \"Inprinis!\" quoth the abbot, puffing out the word with great scorn; \"thinkest thou, son of Mammon, that our good King sets his pious heart on gew-gaw, and gems, and such vanities?  Thou shouldst take the goods to Count Baldwin of Flanders; or Tostig, the proud Earl's proud son.\"  \"Marry!\" said the cheapman, with a smile; \"my treasure will find small price with Baldwin the scoffer, and Tostig the vain!  Nor need ye look at me so sternly, my fathers; but rather vie with each other who shall win this wonder of wonders for his own convent; know, in a word, that it is the right thumb of St. Jude, which a worthy man bought at Rome for me, for 3000 lb. weight of silver; and I ask but 500 lb. over the purchase for my pains and my fee.\" [119]  \"Humph!\" said the abbot.  \"Humph!\" said the aspiring young monk; the rest gathered wistfully round the linen cloth.  A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain was here heard; and all turning, saw a tall, fierce-looking thegn, who had found his way into that group, like a hawk in a rookery.  \"Dost thou tell me, knave,\" quoth the thegn, in a dialect that bespoke him a Dane by origin, with the broad burr still retained in the north; \"Dost thou tell me that the King will waste his gold on such fooleries, while the fort built by Canute at the flood of the Humber is all fallen into ruin, without a man in steel jacket to keep watch on the war fleets of Swede and Norwegian?\"  \"Worshipful minister,\" replied the cheapman, with some slight irony in his tone, \"these reverend fathers will tell thee that the thumb of St. Jude is far better aid against Swede and Norwegian than forts of stone and jackets of steel; nathless, if thou wantest jackets of steel, I have some to sell at a fair price, of the last fashion, and helms with long nose-pieces, as are worn by the Normans.\"  \"The thumb of a withered old saint,\" cried the Dane, not heeding the last words, \"more defence at the mouth of the Humber than crenellated castles and mailed men!\"  \"Surely, naught son,\" said the abbot, looking shocked, and taking part with the cheapman.  \"Dost thou not remember that, in the pious and famous council of 1014, it was decreed to put aside all weapons of flesh against thy heathen countrymen, and depend alone on St. Michael to fight for us?  Thinkest thou that the saint would ever suffer his holy thumb to fall into the hands of the Gentiles?--never!  Go to, thou art not fit to have conduct of the King's wars.  Go to, and repent, my son, or the King shall hear of it.\"  \"Ah, wolf in sheep's clothing!\" muttered the Dane, turning on his heel; \"if thy monastery were but built on the other side the Humber!\"  The cheapman heard him, and smiled.  While such the scene in the ante- room, we follow Harold into the King's presence.  On entering, he found there a man in the prime of life, and though richly clad in embroidered gonna, and with gilt ateghar at his side, still with the loose robe, the long moustache, and the skin of the throat and right hand punctured with characters and devices, which proved his adherence to the fashions of the Saxon [120].  And Harold's eye sparkled, for in this guest he recognized the father of Aldyth, Earl Algar, son of Leofric.  The two nobles exchanged grave salutations, and each eyed the other wistfully.  The contrast between the two was striking.  The Danish race were men generally of larger frame and grander mould than the Saxon [121]; and though in all else, as to exterior, Harold was eminently Saxon, yet, in common with his brothers, he took from the mother's side the lofty air and iron frame of the old kings of the sea.  But Algar, below the middle height, though well set, was slight in comparison with Harold. His strength was that which men often take rather from the nerve than the muscle; a strength that belongs to quick tempers and restless energies.  His light blue eye, singularly vivid and glittering; his quivering lip, the veins swelling at each emotion on the fair white temples; the long yellow hair, bright as gold, and resisting, in its easy curls, all attempts to curb it into the smooth flow most in fashion; the nervous movements of the gesture; the somewhat sharp and hasty tones of the voice; all opposed, as much as if the two men were of different races, the steady, deep eye of Harold, his composed mien, sweet and majestic, his decorous locks parted on the king-like front, with their large single curl where they touched the shoulder. Intelligence and will were apparent in both the men; but the intelligence of one was acute and rapid, that of the other profound and steadfast; the will of one broke in flashes of lightning, that of the other was calm as the summer sun at noon.  \"Thou art welcome, Harold,\" said the King, with less than his usual listlessness, and with a look of relief as the Earl approached him.  \"Our good Algar comes to us with a suit well worthy consideration, though pressed somewhat hotly, and evincing too great a desire for goods worldly; contrasting in this his most laudable father our well- beloved Leofric, who spends his substance in endowing monasteries and dispensing alms; wherefore he shall receive a hundred-fold in the treasure-house above.\"  \"A good interest, doubtless, my lord the King,\" said Algar; quickly, \"but one that is not paid to his heirs; and the more need, if my father (whom I blame not for doing as he lists with his own) gives all he hath to the monks--the more need, I say, to take care that his son shall be enabled to follow his example.  As it is, most noble King, I fear me that Algar, son of Leofric, will have nothing to give.  In brief, Earl Harold,\" continued Algar, turning to his fellow-thegn--\"in brief, thus stands the matter.  When our lord the King was first graciously pleased to consent to rule in England, the two chiefs who most assured his throne were thy father and mine: often foes, they laid aside feud and jealousy for the sake of the Saxon line.  Now, since then, thy father hath strung earldom to earldom, like links in a coat-mail.  And, save Northumbria and Mercia; well-nigh all England falls to him and his sons: whereas my father remains what he was, and my father's son stands landless and penceless.  In thine absence the King was graciously pleased to bestow on me thy father's earldom; men say that I ruled it well.  Thy father returns, and though\" (here Algar's eyes shot fire, and his hand involuntarily rested on his ateghar) \"I could have held it, methinks, by the strong hand, I gave it up at my father's prayer and the King's hest, with a free heart. Now, therefore, I come to my lord, and I ask, 'What lands and what lordships canst thou spare in broad England to Algar, once Earl of Wessex, and son to the Leofric whose hand smoothed the way to thy throne?'  My lord the King is pleased to preach to me contempt of the world; thou dost not despise the world, Earl of the East Angles,--what sayest thou to the heir of Leofric?\"  \"That thy suit is just,\" answered Harold, calmly, \"but urged with small reverence.\"  Earl Algar bounded like a stag that the arrow hath startled.  \"It becomes thee, who hast backed thy suits with warships and mail, to talk of reverence, and rebuke one whose fathers reigned over earldoms [122], when thine were, no doubt, ceorls at the plough.  But for Edric Streone, the traitor and low-born, what had been Wolnoth, thy grandsire?\"  So rude and home an assault in the presence of the King, who, though personally he loved Harold in his lukewarm way, yet, like all weak men, was not displeased to see the strong split their strength against each other, brought the blood into Harold's cheek; but he answered calmly:  \"We live in a land, son of Leofric, in which birth, though not disesteemed, gives of itself no power in council or camp.  We belong to a land where men are valued for what they are, not for what their dead ancestors might have been.  So has it been for ages in Saxon England, where my fathers, through Godwin, as thou sayest, might have been ceorls; and so, I have heard, it is in the land of the martial Danes, where my fathers, through Githa, reigned on the thrones of the North.\"  \"Thou dost well,\" said Algar, gnawing his lip, \"to shelter thyself on the spindle side, but we Saxons of pure descent think little of your kings of the North, pirates and idolaters, and eaters of horseflesh; but enjoy what thou hast, and let Algar have his clue.\"  \"It is for the King, not his servant, to answer the prayer of Algar,\" said Harold, withdrawing to the farther end of the room.  Algar's eye followed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7675"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 04 (#8)"],["body","im, and observing that the King was fast sinking into one of the fits of religious reverie in which he sought to be inspired with a decision, whenever his mind was perplexed, he moved with a light step to Harold, put his band on his shoulder, and whispered:  \"We do ill to quarrel with each other--I repent me of hot words-- enough.  Thy father is a wise man, and sees far--thy father would have us friends.  Be it so.  Hearken my daughter Aldyth is esteemed not the least fair of the maidens in England; I will give her to thee as thy wife, and as thy morgen gift, thou shalt will for me from the King the earldom forfeited by thy brother Sweyn, now parcelled out amongst sub- earls and thegns--easy enow to control.  By the shrine of St. Alban, dost thou hesitate, man?\"  \"No, not an instant,\" said Harold, stung to the quick.  \"Not, couldst thou offer me all Mercia as her dower, would I wed the daughter of Algar; and bend my knee, as a son to a wife's father, to the man who despises my lineage, while he truckles to my power.\"  Algar's face grew convulsed with rage; but without saying a word to the Earl he strode back to Edward, who now with vacant eyes looked up from the rosary over which he had been bending, and said abruptly:  \"My lord the King, I have spoken as I think it becomes a man who knows his own claims, and believes in the gratitude of princes.  Three days will I tarry in London for your gracious answer; on the fourth I depart.  May the saints guard your throne, and bring around it its best defence, the thegn-born satraps whose fathers fought with Alfred and Athelstan.  All went well with merrie England till the hoof of the Dane King broke the soil, and mushrooms sprung up where the oak-trees fell.\"  When the son of Leofric had left the chamber, the King rose wearily and said in Norman French, to which language he always yearningly returned when with those who could speak it:  \"Beau frere and bien aime, in what trifles must a king pass his life! And, all this while, matters grave and urgent demand me.  Know that Eadmer, the cheapman, waits without, and hath brought me, dear and good man, the thumb of St. Jude!  What thought of delight!  And this unmannerly son of strife, with his jay's voice and wolf's eyes, screaming at me for earldoms!--oh the folly of man!  Naught, naught, very naught!\"  \"Sir and King,\" said Harold; \"it ill becomes me to arraign your pious desires, but these relics are of vast cost; our coasts are ill defended, and the Dane yet lays claim to your kingdom.  Three thousand pounds of silver and more does it need to repair even the old wall of London and Southweorc.\"  \"Three thousand pounds!\" cried the King; \"thou art mad, Harold!  I have scarce twice that sum in the treasury; and besides the thumb of St. Jude, I daily expect the tooth of St. Remigius--the tooth of St. Remigius!\"  Harold sighed.  \"Vex not yourself, my lord, I will see to the defences of London.  For, thanks to your grace, my revenues are large, while my wants are simple.  I seek you now to pray your leave to visit my earldom.  My lithsmen murmur at my absence, and grievances, many and sore, have arisen in my exile.\"  The King stared in terror; and his look was that of a child when about to be left in the dark.  \"Nay, nay; I cannot spare thee, beau frere.  Thou curbest all these stiff thegns--thou leavest me time for the devout; moreover, thy father, thy father, I will not be left to thy father!  I love him not!\"  \"My father,\" said Harold, mournfully, \"returns to his own earldom; and of all our House you will have but the mild face of your queen by your side!\"  The King's lip writhed at that hinted rebuke, or implied consolation.  \"Edith the Queen,\" he said, after a slight pause, \"is pious and good; and she hath never gainsaid my will, and she hath set before her as a model the chaste Susannah, as I, unworthy man, from youth upward, have walked in the pure steps of Joseph [123].  But,\" added the King, with a touch of human feeling in his voice, \"canst thou not conceive, Harold, thou who art a warrior, what it would be to see ever before thee the face of thy deadliest foe--the one against whom all thy struggles of life and death had turned into memories of hyssop and gall?\"  \"My sister!\" exclaimed Harold, in indignant amaze, \"My sister thy deadliest foe!  She who never once murmured at neglect, disgrace--she whose youth hath been consumed in prayers for thee and thy realm--my sister!  O King, I dream?\"  \"Thou dreamest not, carnal man,\" said the King, peevishly.  \"Dreams are the gifts of the saints, and are not granted to such as thou! Dost thou think that, in the prune of my manhood, I could have youth and beauty forced on my sight, and hear man's law and man's voice say, 'They are thine, and thine only,' and not feel that war was brought to my hearth, and a snare set on my bed, and that the fiend had set watch on my soul?  Verily, I tell thee, man of battle, that thou hast known no strife as awful as mine, and achieved no victory as hard and as holy.  And now, when my beard is silver, and the Adam of old is expelled at the precincts of death; now, thinkest thou, that I can be reminded of the strife and temptation of yore, without bitterness and shame; when days were spent in fasting, and nights in fierce prayer; and in the face of woman I saw the devices of Satan?\"  Edward coloured as he spoke, and his voice trembled with the accents of what seemed hate.  Harold gazed on him mutely, and felt that at last he had won the secret that had ever perplexed him, and that in seeking to be above the humanity of love, the would-be saint had indeed turned love into the hues of hate--a thought of anguish, and a memory of pain.  The King recovered himself in a few moments, and said, with some dignity, \"But God and his saints alone should know the secrets of the household.  What I have said was wrung from me.  Bury it in thy heart. Leave me, then, Harold, sith so it must be.  Put thine earldom in order, attend to the monasteries and the poor, and return soon.  As for Algar, what sayest thou?\"  \"I fear me,\" answered the large-souled Harold, with a victorious effort of justice over resentment, \"that if you reject his suit you will drive him into some perilous extremes.  Despite his rash and proud spirit, he is brave against foes, and beloved by the ceorls, who oft like best the frank and hasty spirit.  Wherefore some power and lordship it were wise to give, without dispossessing others, and not more wise than due, for his father served you well.\"  \"And hath endowed more houses of God than any earl in the kingdom. But Algar is no Leofric.  We will consider your words and heed them. Bless you, beau frere! and send in the cheapman.  The thumb of St. Jude!  What a gift to my new church of St. Peter!  The thumb of St. Jude!  Non nobis gloria!  Sancta Maria!  The thumb of St. Jude!\""]]]
