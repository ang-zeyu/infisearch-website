Sho now, go easy, you!\" And at last they drew up at Mrs. Beebe's door.  There she stood in the doorway, in a cap with new pink ribbons, and old Mr. Beebe just a little back, smiling and rubbing his hands, and in the little window where the shoes and rubbers and slippers were hanging was a big round face plastered up against the small panes of glass.  \"There's Ab'm, now,\" exclaimed his mother, proudly. \"I guess when you see him you'll say there never was sech a boy. Well, I'm glad we're here safe an' sound, an' this horse hain't run nor nothin'. Now, hop out,\"--which injunction was not needed.  Good Mrs. Beebe ran her eye over the little bunch of Peppers as they jumped down over the wheel. \"Why, where's Joel?\" she cried. \"In the bottom o' th' wagon, I s'pose,\" she added, laughing and shaking her fat sides.  \"Yes, where's Joel?\" cried Mr. Beebe, rubbing his hands together harder than ever. \"I want him to tell me all about how he ketched them robbers.\"  Polly was just going to tell all about Joel, and why he couldn't come, when the big woman shouted out, \"They couldn't find him, for he warn't to home.\"  \"Sho, now, that's too bad!\" ejaculated Mr. Beebe, dreadfully disappointed. Mrs. Beebe already had Phronsie in her arms, and was whispering to her some of the delights to come. \"Well, well, well, come right in, all of you, and make yourselves to home. I'll take care of the horse, Marinthy; go in an' set down.\"  \"I'm sure I'm glad to,\" said Marinthy, getting over the little steps quickly after the Pepper children, and nearly knocking down David, who came last. \"Ab'm, come here an' make your manners,\" she called. Ab'm got down from the pile of boxes where he had been looking out of the window, and slouched forward, his finger in his mouth.  \"Speak up pretty, now,\" said his mother, pulling his jacket down with a twitch, and looking at him admiringly; \"these children's come to your party. Say how do you do, an' you're glad to see 'em.\"  \"How do you do, an' you're glad to see 'em--\"  \"Land sakes alive!\" cried his mother, with a shake; \"hain't you no more manners'n that? Do say it right.\"  \"You told me to say it so,\" said Ab'm, doggedly.  \"No, I didn't,\" retorted his mother with another shake. The little bunch of Peppers turned quite pale, and scarcely breathed.  \"Did anybody ever see sech a boy, an' he that's had no pains spared 'n his bringin' up? Well, he's ten to-day, thank fortune, an' he'll soon be a-takin' care o' himself.\"  Phronsie crept closer to Polly. \"Take me home,\" she said. \"I want my Mammy.\"  \"O dear me,\" thought Polly, \"whatever shall I do! It will make dear Mr. and Mrs. Beebe feel so badly if I don't stop her. Phronsie,\" and she drew her off one side of the shop, old Mrs. Beebe having gone into the inner room, \"you know Mamsie told us all to be good.\"  \"Yes,\" said Phronsie, her lips quivering, and the tears beginning to come in her blue eyes.  \"Well, it would just about make dear Mrs. Beebe and dear Mr. Beebe sick to have you feel badly and go home.\"  \"Would it?\" asked Phronsie, swallowing hard.  \"Yes,\" said Polly, decidedly, \"it would. People never go to a party, and then say they must go home.\"  \"Don't they, Polly?\" asked the little girl.  \"No,\" said Polly, decidedly, \"I never heard of such a thing. And just think, Phronsie Pepper, how Mamsie would look! Oh, you can't mean to be a naughty girl.\"  \"I--won't--be a naughty--girl, Polly,\" promised Phronsie, battling with her tears, \"an' I won't look at the big woman, nor the boy. Then I'll stay.\"  So Polly kissed her, and pretty soon Mrs. Beebe bustled in, her round face quite red with the exertions she had been making, and Mr. Beebe having seen to his horse, came in rubbing his hands worse than ever, saying, \"Now, if we only had Joel, we'd be all right.\"  \"Now, my dears,\"--began Mrs. Beebe. \"Why, you haven't laid off your things yet!\" to the Peppers.  \"No'm,\" said Polly, \"but we will now, thank you, Mrs. Beebe,\" and she untied Phronsie's sun-bonnet and took off the shawl, David putting his cap down on the counter, keeping a sharp, disapproving eye on Ab'm every minute.  \"When are you coming for a new pair of shoes?\" whispered Mr. Beebe, getting hold of Phronsie and lifting her to his knee.  Phronsie thrust out her little foot. \"See,\" she cried gleefully, forgetting for a moment the big woman and the boy, \"dear, nice Mr. Beebe, they're all here.\" Then she poked out the other foot. \"I buttoned 'em up all myself.\"  \"No?\" cried Mr. Beebe, greatly delighted; \"well, now, when those are worn out, you come and see me again, will you?\"  \"They aren't ever going to be worn out,\" said Phronsie, positively, and shaking her head.  \"Hoh, hoh!\" laughed Ab'm, suddenly finding his tongue, \"your shoes ain't never goin' to wear out! Ma, did you hear her?\"  Phronsie started and hid her face on Mr. Beebe's fat shoulder. Polly hurried to her side.  \"Be still!\" cried his mother; \"hain't you no manners, an' they're company? Ab'm Bennett, I'm ashamed of ye.\" With that she leaned over and gave him a box on the ear.  It was perfectly dreadful, and Polly had all she could do to keep from bursting out crying. And what they would have done, no one knows, if Mrs. Beebe hadn't said, \"Won't you all walk out into the parlor an' set down to the table? Come, Pa, you lead with Phronsie.\"  \"Ab'm oughter,\" said his mother; \"that's style, seein' th' party's fer his birthday.\"  \"Well, you go first then, Marinthy,\" said old Mr. Beebe, dryly, \"with him, an' Phronsie an' I'll foller on. Now then, my dear.\" He set her on the floor, and bent his old white head down to smile into her face reassuringly, while her trembling fingers held his hand fast.  \"Polly,\" said little David, as they brought up the rear of the procession, \"I am so very much afraid of that boy.\"  \"The party will soon be through,\" said Polly, encouragingly. \"I'm so glad that Joel isn't here, for he'd say something, I'm afraid, if Ab'm scares Phronsie again,\" and she gave a sigh of relief.  Oh, the table! There were doughnuts, sure enough, as Mrs. Marinthy had said, \"The biggest I ever see, and the sugariest.\" No wonder good Mrs. Beebe got up at four o'clock to make them! And a great dish of pink and white sticks and cunning little biscuits with real butter on them, and a cake, with little round candies sprinkled all over the top. Was there ever such a beautiful birthday party!  Phronsie, clinging to good Mr. Beebe's hand, thought not, and her glances wandered all up and down in delight, to bring her eyes at last up to Polly's brown ones, when her little face broke into a happy smile. Ab'm was so intent on choosing which of the pink and white sticks he should pick for, that he could think of nothing else, so Mrs. Beebe got them all seated without any further trouble. Old Mr. Beebe was just saying, \"Now, if Joel was only here, we'd be all right,\" when the shop door opened suddenly, and into the little parlor ran Joel, very red in the face.  \"Now that's nice enough,\" cried Mrs. Beebe, getting out of her chair, her pink cap-ribbons all in a flutter, while old Mr. Beebe exclaimed, with a beaming face, \"Well, I declare! ef I ain't glad to see you. Set right down by me.\"  \"No, he'll set here, Pa,\" said Mrs. Beebe, pushing up the chair next to Ab'm; \"there's more room this side.\" So Joel marched up and got into his seat.  \"An' so you thought you'd come,\" said Mr. Beebe, with a jolly little laugh. \"Now we'll have fine times, won't we, Phronsie?\" patting her hand. \"How'd you git here?\"  \"I walked,\" said Joel, who couldn't for his life keep his eyes from the doughnuts, \"'cept when I met a man with a load of hay. An' he was so slow I got down again, for I was afraid I'd miss the party.\"  \"Hee, hee, hee!\" chuckled Mr. Beebe; \"well, wife, do give Joel a doughnut; he must be tired, a-comin' so far.\"  \"Oh, thank you,\" cried Joel, thrusting out his hand eagerly.  \"'Tain't style, where I come from out West, to help the doughnuts first, an' specially when that boy's just come,\" said Mrs. Marinthy, with a great air.  Joel dropped his doughnut to his plate as if it had been a hot cake, and leaned over to fasten his black eyes on her big face. \"Well, pass the biscuits, do, then,\" said old Mr. Beebe, good-naturedly; \"let's get somethin' a-goin', Ma.\" So the little biscuits were passed, but Joel did not take one; he still sat regarding Ab'm's mother.  \"Ma, Ma,\" said Ab'm in a loud whisper, and twitching her elbow, \"this strange boy's a-lookin' at you all the time. Make him stop, do.\"  At this Phronsie gave a little cry. \"Don't let 'em hurt Joey,\" she gasped, turning to Mr. Beebe.  \"There shan't nothin' hurt Joel, don't you be afraid,\" he whispered back.  \"Hoh, hoh!\" cried Ab'm, pointing a big fat finger at her, that might have been cleaner; \"hear her now. An' she said her shoes warn't never goin' to wear out. Hoh, hoh!\"  \"You let our Phronsie alone,\" screamed Joel, tearing his black eyes off from Mrs. Marinthy's face to fasten them on her son. \"Ow! he pinched me,\" roared Ab'm, edging suddenly off to his mother.  \"I didn't,\" cried Joel, stoutly; \"I did't touch him a single bit! But he shan't scare Phronsie, or I'll pitch into him. Yes, sir-ree!\"  \"Joel!\" cried Polly, in great distress, across the table.  \"Well, he shan't scare Phronsie,\" cried Joel, \"this boy shan't, or I will pitch into him,\" and his black eyes blazed, and he doubled up his little brown fists.  \"Joel,\" commanded Polly, \"do you stop, this very minute,\" and, \"Oh, sir!\" looking up at Mr. Beebe, and, \"Oh, marm!\" and her brown eyes were fixed imploringly on Mrs. Beebe's round countenance, \"I do feel so ashamed, and Mamsie will be so sorry. But please will you let us go home?\" And poor Polly could say no more.  \"An' I sh'd think you'd better go home,\" said Ab'm's mother, with asperity; \"a-comin' to a birthday party and abusin' the boy it's give for. I never see th' like.

Blackmore   1887     CHAPTER I  WHEN THE SHIP COMES HOME   In the days when England trusted mainly to the vigor and valor of one man, against a world of enemies, no part of her coast was in greater peril than the fair vale of Springhaven. But lying to the west of the narrow seas, and the shouts both of menace and vigilance, the quiet little village in the tranquil valley forbore to be uneasy.  For the nature of the place and race, since time has outlived memory, continually has been, and must be, to let the world pass easily. Little to talk of, and nothing to do, is the healthy condition of mankind just there. To all who love repose and shelter, freedom from the cares of money and the cark of fashion, and (in lieu of these) refreshing air, bright water, and green country, there is scarcely any valley left to compare with that of Springhaven. This valley does not interrupt the land, but comes in as a pleasant relief to it. No glaring chalk, no grim sandstone, no rugged flint, outface it; but deep rich meadows, and foliage thick, and cool arcades of ancient trees, defy the noise that men make. And above the trees, in shelving distance, rise the crests of upland, a soft gray lias, where orchards thrive, and greensward strokes down the rigor of the rocks, and quick rills lace the bosom of the slope with tags of twisted silver.  In the murmur of the valley twenty little waters meet, and discoursing their way to the sea, give name to the bay that receives them and the anchorage they make. And here no muddy harbor reeks, no foul mouth of rat-haunted drains, no slimy and scraggy wall runs out, to mar the meeting of sweet and salt. With one or two mooring posts to watch it, and a course of stepping-stones, the brook slides into the peaceful bay, and is lost in larger waters. Even so, however, it is kindly still, for it forms a tranquil haven.  Because, where the ruffle of the land stream merges into the heavier disquietude of sea, slopes of shell sand and white gravel give welcome pillow to the weary keel. No southerly tempest smites the bark, no long groundswell upheaves her; for a bold point, known as the “Haven-head,”  baffles the storm in the offing, while the bulky rollers of a strong spring-tide, that need no wind to urge them, are broken by the shifting of the shore into a tier of white-frilled steps. So the deep-waisted smacks that fish for many generations, and even the famous “London trader” (a schooner of five-and-forty tons), have rest from their labors, whenever they wish or whenever they can afford it, in the arms of the land, and the mouth of the water, and under the eyes of Springhaven.  At the corner of the wall, where the brook comes down, and pebble turns into shingle, there has always been a good white gate, respected (as a white gate always is) from its strong declaration of purpose. Outside of it, things may belong to the Crown, the Admiralty, Manor, or Trinity Brethren, or perhaps the sea itself--according to the latest ebb or flow of the fickle tide of Law Courts--but inside that gate everything belongs to the fine old family of Darling.  Concerning the origin of these Darlings divers tales are told, according to the good-will or otherwise of the diver. The Darlings themselves contend and prove that stock and name are Saxon, and the true form of the name is “Deerlung,” as witness the family bearings. But the foes of the race, and especially the Carnes, of ancient Sussex lineage, declare that the name describes itself. Forsooth, these Darlings are nothing more, to their contemptuous certainty, than the offset of some court favorite, too low to have won nobility, in the reign of some light-affectioned king.  If ever there was any truth in that, it has been worn out long ago by friction of its own antiquity. Admiral Darling owns that gate, and all the land inside it, as far as a Preventive man can see with his spy-glass upon the top bar of it. And this includes nearly all the village of Springhaven, and the Hall, and the valley, and the hills that make it. And how much more does all this redound to the credit of the family when the gazer reflects that this is nothing but their younger tenement! For this is only Springhaven Hall, while Darling Holt, the headquarters of the race, stands far inland, and belongs to Sir Francis, the Admiral's elder brother.  When the tides were at their spring, and the year 1802 of our era in the same condition, Horatia Dorothy Darling, younger daughter of the aforesaid Admiral, choosing a very quiet path among thick shrubs and under-wood, came all alone to a wooden building, which her father called his Round-house. In the war, which had been patched over now, but would very soon break out again, that veteran officer held command of the coast defense (westward of Nelson's charge) from Beachy Head to Selsey Bill. No real danger had existed then, and no solid intent of invasion, but many sharp outlooks had been set up, and among them was this at Springhaven.  Here was established under thatch, and with sliding lights before it, the Admiral's favorite Munich glass, mounted by an old ship's carpenter (who had followed the fortunes of his captain) on a stand which would have puzzled anybody but the maker, with the added security of a lanyard from the roof. The gear, though rough, was very strong and solid, and afforded more range and firmer rest to the seven-feet tube and adjustments than a costly mounting by a London optician would have been likely to supply. It was a pleasure to look through such a glass, so clear, and full of light, and firm; and one who could have borne to be looked at through it, or examined even by a microscope, came now to enjoy that pleasure.  Miss Dolly Darling could not be happy--though her chief point was to be so--without a little bit of excitement, though it were of her own construction. Her imagination, being bright and tender and lively, rather than powerful, was compelled to make its own material, out of very little stuff sometimes. She was always longing for something sweet and thrilling and romantic, and what chance of finding it in this dull place, even with the longest telescope? For the war, with all its stirring rumors and perpetual motion on shore and sea, and access of gallant visitors, was gone for the moment, and dull peace was signed.  This evening, as yet, there seemed little chance of anything to enliven her. The village, in the valley and up the stream, was hidden by turns of the land and trees; her father's house beneath the hill crest was out of sight and hearing; not even a child was on the beach; and the only movement was of wavelets leisurely advancing toward the sea-wall fringed with tamarisk. The only thing she could hope to see was the happy return of the fishing-smacks, and perhaps the “London trader,” inasmuch as the fishermen (now released from fencible duty and from French alarm) did their best to return on Saturday night to their moorings, their homes, the disposal of fish, and then the deep slumber of Sunday. If the breeze should enable them to round the Head, and the tide avail for landing, the lane to the village, the beach, and even the sea itself would swarm with life and bustle and flurry and incident. But Dolly's desire was for scenes more warlike and actors more august than these.  Beauty, however, has an eye for beauty beyond its own looking-glass. Deeply as Dolly began to feel the joy of her own loveliness, she had managed to learn, and to feel as well, that so far as the strength and vigor of beauty may compare with its grace and refinement, she had her own match at Springhaven. Quite a hardworking youth, of no social position and no needless education, had such a fine countenance and such bright eyes that she neither could bear to look at him nor forbear to think of him. And she knew that if the fleet came home she would see him on board of the Rosalie.  Flinging on a shelf the small white hat which had scarcely covered her dark brown curls, she lifted and shored with a wooden prop the southern casement of leaded glass. This being up, free range was given to the swinging telescope along the beach to the right and left, and over the open sea for miles, and into the measureless haze of air. She could manage this glass to the best advantage, through her father's teaching, and could take out the slide and clean the lenses, and even part the object-glass, and refix it as well as possible. She belonged to the order of the clever virgins, but scarcely to that of the wise ones.    CHAPTER II  WITH HER CREW AND CARGO   Long after the time of those who write and those who read this history, the name of Zebedee Tugwell will be flourishing at Springhaven.  To achieve unmerited honor is the special gift of thousands, but to deserve and win befalls some few in every century, and one of these few was Zebedee. To be the head-man of any other village, and the captain of its fishing fleet, might prove no lofty eminence; but to be the leader of Springhaven was true and arduous greatness. From Selsey Bill to Orfordness, taking in all the Cinque Ports and all the port of London, there was not a place that insisted on, and therefore possessed, all its own rights so firmly as this village did. Not less than seven stout fishing-smacks--six of them sloops, and the seventh a dandy--formed the marine power of this place, and behaved as one multiplied by seven. All the bold fishermen held their line from long-established ancestry, and stuck to the stock of their grandfathers, and their wisdom and freedom from prejudice. Strength was condensed into clear law with them--as sinew boils down into jelly--and character carried out its force as the stamp of solid impress. What the father had been, the son became, as the generation squared itself, and the slates for the children to do their copies were the tombstones of their granddads. Thus brave Etruria grew, and thus the Rome which was"]]]
