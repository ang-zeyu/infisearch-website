With all her persuasion of her own powers in penetrating the future, we have seen that Hilda had never consulted her oracles on the fate of Harold, without a dark and awful sense of the ambiguity of their responses.  That fate, involving the mightiest interests of a great race, and connected with events operating on the farthest times and the remotest lands, lost itself to her prophetic ken amidst omens the most contradictory, shadows and lights the most conflicting, meshes the most entangled.  Her human heart, devotedly attached to the Earl, through her love for Edith,--her pride obstinately bent on securing to the last daughter of her princely race that throne, which all her vaticinations, even when most gloomy, assured her was destined to the man with whom Edith's doom was interwoven, combined to induce her to the most favourable interpretation of all that seemed sinister and doubtful.  But according to the tenets of that peculiar form of magic cultivated by Hilda, the comprehension became obscured by whatever partook of human sympathy.  It was a magic wholly distinct from the malignant witchcraft more popularly known to us, and which was equally common to the Germanic and Scandinavian heathens.  The magic of Hilda was rather akin to the old Cimbrian Alirones, or sacred prophetesses; and, as with them, it demanded the priestess-- that is, the person without human ties or emotions, a spirit clear as a mirror, upon which the great images of destiny might be cast untroubled.  However the natural gifts and native character of Hilda might be perverted by the visionary and delusive studies habitual to her, there was in her very infirmities a grandeur, not without its pathos.  In this position which she had assumed between the earth and the heaven, she stood so solitary and in such chilling air,--all the doubts that beset her lonely and daring soul came in such gigantic forms of terror and menace!--On the verge of the mighty Heathenesse sinking fast into the night of ages, she towered amidst the shades, a shade herself; and round her gathered the last demons of the Dire Belief, defying the march of their luminous foe, and concentering round their mortal priestess, the wrecks of their horrent empire over a world redeemed.  All the night that succeeded her last brief conference with Harold, the Vala wandered through the wild forest land, seeking haunts or employed in collecting herbs, hallowed to her dubious yet solemn lore; and the last stars were receding into the cold grey skies, when, returning homeward, she beheld within the circle of the Druid temple a motionless object, stretched on the ground near the Teuton's grave; she approached, and perceived what seemed a corpse, it was so still and stiff in its repose, and the face upturned to the stars was so haggard and death-like;--a face horrible to behold; the evidence of extreme age was written on the shrivelled livid skin and the deep furrows, but the expression retained that intense malignity which belongs to a power of life that extreme age rarely knows.  The garb, which was that of a remote fashion, was foul and ragged, and neither by the garb, nor by the face, was it easy to guess what was the sex of this seeming corpse.  But by a strange and peculiar odour that rose from the form [179], and a certain glistening on the face, and the lean folded hands, Hilda knew that the creature was one of those witches, esteemed of all the most deadly and abhorred, who, by the application of certain ointments, were supposed to possess the art of separating soul from body, and, leaving the last as dead, to dismiss the first to the dismal orgies of the Sabbat.  It was a frequent custom to select for the place of such trances, heathen temples and ancient graves.  And Hilda seated herself beside the witch to await the waking.  The cock crowed thrice, heavy mists began to arise from the glades, covering the gnarled roots of the forest trees, when the dread face on which Hilda calmly gazed, showed symptoms of returning life! a strong convulsion shook the vague indefinite form under its huddled garments, the eyes opened, closed,--opened again; and what had a few moments before seemed a dead thing sate up and looked round.  \"Wicca,\" said the Danish prophetess, with an accent between contempt and curiosity, \"for what mischief to beast or man hast thou followed the noiseless path of the Dreams through the airs of Night?\"  The creature gazed hard upon the questioner, from its bleared but fiery eyes, and replied slowly, \"Hail, Hilda, the Morthwyrtha! why art thou not of us, why comest thou not to our revels?  Gay sport have we had to-night with Faul and Zabulus [180]; but gayer far shall our sport be in the wassail hall of Senlac, when thy grandchild shall come in the torchlight to the bridal bed of her lord.  A buxom bride is Edith the Fair, and fair looked her face in her sleep on yester noon, when I sate by her side, and breathed on her brow, and murmured the verse that blackens the dream; but fairer still shall she look in her sleep by her lord.  Ha! ha!  Ho! we shall be there, with Zabulus and Faul; we shall be there!\"  \"How!\" said Hilda, thrilled to learn that the secret ambition she cherished was known to this loathed sister in the art.  \"How dost thou pretend to that mystery of the future, which is dim and clouded even to me?  Canst thou tell when and where the daughter of the Norse kings shall sleep on the breast of her lord?\"  A sound that partook of laughter, but was so unearthly in its malignant glee that it seemed not to come from a human lip, answered the Vala; and as the laugh died the witch rose, and said:  \"Go and question thy dead, O Morthwyrtha!  Thou deemest thyself wiser than we are; we wretched hags, whom the ceorl seeks when his herd has the murrain, or the girl when her false love forsakes her; we, who have no dwelling known to man; but are found at need in the wold or the cave, or the side of dull slimy streams where the murderess-mother hath drowned her babe.  Askest thou, O Hilda, the rich and the learned, askest thou counsel and lore from the daughter of Faul?\"  \"No,\" answered the Vala, haughtily, \"not to such as thou do the great Nornas unfold the future.  What knowest thou of the runes of old, whispered by the trunkless skull to the mighty Odin? runes that control the elements, and conjure up the Shining Shadows of the grave. Not with thee will the stars confer; and thy dreams are foul with revelries obscene, not solemn and haunted with the bodements of things to come!  Only I marvelled, while I beheld thee on the Saxon's grave, what joy such as thou can find in that life above life, which draws upward the soul of the true Vala.\"  \"The joy,\" replied the Witch, \"the joy which comes from wisdom and power, higher than you ever won with your spells from the rune or the star.  Wrath gives the venom to the slaver of the clog, and death to the curse of the Witch.  When wilt thou be as wise as the hag thou despisest?  When will all the clouds that beset thee roll away from thy ken?  When thy hopes are all crushed, when thy passions lie dead, when thy pride is abased, when thou art but a wreck, like the shafts of this temple, through which the starlight can shine.  Then only, thy soul will see clearly the sense of the runes, and then, thou and I will meet on the verge of the Black Shoreless Sea!\"  So, despite all her haughtiness and disdain, did these words startle the lofty Prophetess, that she remained gazing into space long after that fearful apparition had vanished, and up from the grass, which those obscene steps had profaned, sprang the lark carolling.  But ere the sun had dispelled the dews on the forest sward, Hilda had recovered her wonted calm, and, locked within her own secret chamber, prepared the seid and the runes for the invocation of the dead.     CHAPTER VI.   Resolving, should the auguries consulted permit him to depart, to entrust Gurth with the charge of informing Edith, Harold parted from his betrothed, without hint of his suspended designs; and he passed the day in making all preparations for his absence and his journey, promising Gurth to give his final answer on the morrow,--when either himself or his brother should depart for Rouen.  But more and more impressed with the arguments of Gurth, and his own sober reason, and somewhat perhaps influenced by the forebodings of Edith (for that mind, once so constitutionally firm, had become tremulously alive to such airy influences), he had almost predetermined to assent to his brother's prayer, when he departed to keep his dismal appointment with the Morthwyrtha.  The night was dim, but not dark; no moon shone, but the stars, wan though frequent, gleamed pale, as from the farthest deeps of the heaven; clouds grey and fleecy rolled slowly across the welkin, veiling and disclosing, by turns, the melancholy orbs.  The Morthwyrtha, in her dark dress, stood within the circle of stones. She had already kindled a fire at the foot of the bautastein, and its glare shone redly on the grey shafts; playing through their forlorn gaps upon the sward.  By her side was a vessel, seemingly of pure water, filled from the old Roman fountain, and its clear surface flashed blood-red in the beams.  Behind them, in a circle round both fire and water, were fragments of bark, cut in a peculiar form, like the head of an arrow, and inscribed with the mystic letters; nine were the fragments, and on each fragment were graved the runes.  In her right hand the Morthwyrtha held her seid-staff, her feet were bare, and her loins girt by the Hunnish belt inscribed with mystic letters; from the belt hung a pouch or gipsire of bearskin, with plates of silver.  Her face, as Harold entered the circle, had lost its usual calm--it was wild and troubled.  She seemed unconscious of Harold's presence, and her eye fixed and rigid, was as that of one in a trance.  Slowly, as if constrained by some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7679"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 08 (#5)"],["body","not her own, she began to move round the ring with a measured pace, and at last her voice broke low, hollow, and internal, into a rugged chaunt, which may be thus imperfectly translated--      \"By the Urdar-fount dwelling,        Day by day from the rill,      The Nornas besprinkle        The ash Ygg-drassill, [181]      The hart bites the buds,        And the snake gnaws the root,      But the eagle all-seeing        Keeps watch on the fruit.       These drops on thy tomb        From the fountain I pour;      With the rune I invoke thee,        With flame I restore.      Dread Father of men,        In the land of thy grave,      Give voice to the Vala,        And light to the Brave.\"  As she thus chaunted, the Morthwyrtha now sprinkled the drops from the vessel over the bautastein,--now, one by one, cast the fragments of bark scrawled with runes on the fire.  Then, whether or not some glutinous or other chemical material had been mingled in the water, a pale gleam broke from the gravestone thus sprinkled, and the whole tomb glistened in the light of the leaping fire.  From this light a mist or thin smoke gradually rose, and took, though vaguely, the outline of a vast human form.  But so indefinite was the outline to Harold's eye, that gazing on it steadily, and stilling with strong effort his loud heart, he knew not whether it was a phantom or a vapour that he beheld.  The Vala paused, leaning on her staff, and gazing in awe on the glowing stone, while the Earl, with his arms folded on his broad breast, stood hushed and motionless.  The sorceress recommenced:      \"Mighty dead, I revere thee,        Dim-shaped from the cloud,      With the light of thy deeds        For the web of thy shroud.       As Odin consulted        Mimir's skull hollow-eyed, [182]      Odin's heir comes to seek        In the Phantom a guide.\"  As the Morthwyrtha ceased, the fire crackled loud, and from its flame flew one of the fragments of bark to the feet of the sorceress:--the runic letters all indented with sparks.  The sorceress uttered a loud cry, which, despite his courage and his natural strong sense, thrilled through the Earl's heart to his marrow and bones, so appalling was it with wrath and terror; and while she gazed aghast on the blazing letters, she burst forth:      \"No warrior art thou,        And no child of the tomb;      I know thee, and shudder,        Great Asa of Doom.       Thou constrainest my lips        And thou crushest my spell;      Bright Son of the Giant        Dark Father of Hell!\" [183]  The whole form of the Morthwyrtha then became convulsed and agitated, as if with the tempest of frenzy; the foam gathered to her lips, and her voice rang forth like a shriek:      \"In the Iron Wood rages        The Weaver of Harm,      The giant Blood-drinker        Hag-born MANAGARM. [184]       A keel nears the shoal;        From the slime and the mud      Crawl the newt and the adder,        The spawn the of flood.       Thou stand'st on the rock        Where the dreamer beheld thee.      O soul, spread thy wings,        Ere the glamour hath spell'd thee.       O, dread is the tempter,        And strong the control;      But conquer'd the tempter,        If firm be the soul\"  The Vala paused; and though it was evident that in her frenzy she was still unconscious of Harold's presence, and seemed but to be the compelled and passive voice to some Power, real or imaginary, beyond her own existence, the proud man approached, and said:  \"Firm shall be my soul, nor of the dangers which beset it would I ask the dead or the living.  If plain answers to mortal sense can come from these airy shadows or these mystic charms, reply, O interpreter of fate; reply but to the questions I demand.  If I go to the court of the Norman, shall I return unscathed?\"  The Vala stood rigid as a shape of stone while Harold thus spoke; and her voice came so low and strange as if forced from her scarce-moving lips:  \"Thou shalt return unscathed.\"  \"Shall the hostages of Godwin, my father, be released\"  \"The hostages of Godwin shall be released,\" answered the same voice; \"the hostages of Harold be retained.\"  \"Wherefore hostage from me?\"  \"In pledge of alliance with the Norman.\"  \"Ha! then the Norman and Harold shall plight friendship and troth?\"  \"Yes!\" answered the Vala; but this time a visible shudder passed over her rigid form.  \"Two questions more, and I have done.  The Norman priests have the ear of the Roman Pontiff.  Shall my league with William the Norman avail to win me my bride?\"  \"It will win thee the bride thou wouldst never have wedded but for thy league with William the Norman.  Peace with thy questions, peace!\" continued the voice, trembling as with some fearful struggle; \"for it is the demon that forces my words, and they wither my soul to speak them.\"  \"But one question more remains; shall I live to wear the crown of England; and if so, when shall I be a king?\"  At these words the face of the Prophetess kindled, the fire suddenly leapt up higher and brighter; again, vivid sparks lighted the runes on the fragments of bark that were shot from the flame; over these last the Morthwyrtha bowed her head, and then, lifting it, triumphantly burst once more into song.      \"When the Wolf Month [185], grim and still,      Heaps the snow-mass on the hill;      When, through white air, sharp and bitter,      Mocking sunbeams freeze and glitter;      When the ice-gems, bright and barbed,      Deck the boughs the leaves had garbed      Then the measure shall be meted,      And the circle be completed.      Cerdic's race, the Thor-descended,      In the Monk-king's tomb be ended;      And no Saxon brow but thine      Wear the crown of Woden's line.       Where thou wendest, wend unfearing,      Every step thy throne is nearing.      Fraud may plot, and force assail thee,--      Shall the soul thou trusteth fail thee?      If it fail thee, scornful hearer,      Still the throne shines near and nearer.      Guile with guile oppose, and never      Crown and brow shall Force dissever:      Till the dead men unforgiving      Loose the war steeds on the living;      Till a sun whose race is ending      Sees the rival stars contending;      Where the dead men, unforgiving,      Wheel the war steeds round the living.       Where thou wendest, wend unfearing;      Every step thy throne is nearing.      Never shall thy House decay,      Nor thy sceptre pass away,      While the Saxon name endureth      In the land thy throne secureth;      Saxon name and throne together,      Leaf and root, shall wax and wither;      So the measure shall be meted,      And the circle close completed.       Art thou answer'd, dauntless seeker?      Go, thy bark shall ride the breaker,      Every billow high and higher,      Waft thee up to thy desire;      And a force beyond thine own,      Drift and strand thee on the throne.       When the Wolf Month, grim and still,      Piles the snow-mass on the hill,      In the white air sharp and bitter      Shall thy kingly sceptre glitter:      When the ice-gems barb the bough      Shall the jewels clasp thy brow;      Winter-wind, the oak uprending,      With the altar-anthem blending;      Wind shall howl, and mone shall sing,      'Hail to Harold--HAIL THE KING!'\"  An exultation that seemed more than human, so intense it was and so solemn,--thrilled in the voice which thus closed predictions that seemed signally to belie the more vague and menacing warnings with which the dreary incantation had commenced.  The Morthwyrtha stood erect and stately, still gazing on the pale blue flame that rose from the burial stone, still slowly the flame waned and paled, and at last died with a sudden flicker, leaving the grey tomb standing forth all weatherworn and desolate, while a wind rose from the north and sighed through the roofless columns.  Then as the light over the grave expired, Hilda gave a deep sigh, and fell to the ground senseless.  Harold lifted his eyes towards the stars and murmured:  \"If it be a sin, as the priests say, to pierce the dark walls which surround us here, and read the future in the dim world beyond, why gavest thou, O Heaven, the reason, ever resting, save when it explores?  Why hast thou set in the heart the mystic Law of Desire, ever toiling to the High, ever grasping at the Far?\"  Heaven answered not the unquiet soul.  The clouds passed to and fro in their wanderings, the wind still sighed through the hollow stones, the fire shot with vain sparks towards the distant stars.  In the cloud and the wind and the fire couldst thou read no answer from Heaven, unquiet soul?  The next day, with a gallant company, the falcon on his wrist [186], the sprightly hound gamboling before his steed, blithe of heart and high in hope, Earl Harold took his way to the Norman court."]]]
