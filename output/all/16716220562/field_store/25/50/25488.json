Earls and archbishops scrupled not to derive revenues from what we should now esteem the literal resources of trade.  [The Abbot of St. Alban's (temp. Henry III.) was a vendor of Yarmouth bloaters.  The Cistercian Monks were wool-merchants; and Macpherson tells us of a couple of Iceland bishops who got a license from Henry VI. for smuggling. (Matthew Paris.  Macpherson's \"Annals of Commerce,\" 10.)  As the Whig historians generally have thought fit to consider the Lancastrian cause the more \"liberal\" of the two, because Henry IV. was the popular choice, and, in fact, an elected, not an hereditary king, so it cannot be too emphatically repeated, that the accession of Edward IV. was the success of two new and two highly-- popular principles,--the one that of church reform, the other that of commercial calculation.  All that immense section, almost a majority of the people, who had been persecuted by the Lancastrian kings as Lollards, revenged on Henry the aggrieved rights of religious toleration.  On the other hand, though Henry IV., who was immeasurably superior to his warlike son in intellect and statesmanship, had favoured the growing commercial spirit, it had received nothing but injury under Henry V., and little better than contempt under Henry VI. The accession of the Yorkists was, then, on two grounds a great popular movement; and it was followed by a third advantage to the popular cause,--namely, in the determined desire both of Edward and Richard III. to destroy the dangerous influence of the old feudal aristocracy.  To this end Edward laboured in the creation of a court noblesse; and Richard, with the more dogged resolution that belonged to him, went at once to the root of the feudal power, in forbidding the nobles to give badges and liveries (this also was forbidden, it is true, by the edict of Edward IV. as well as by his predecessors from the reign of Richard II.; but no king seems to have had the courage to enforce the prohibition before Richard III.),--in other words, to appropriate armies under the name of retainers.  Henry VII., in short, did not originate the policy for which he has monopolized the credit; he did but steadily follow out the theory of raising the middle class and humbling the baronial, which the House of York first put into practice.] shown itself on this point more liberal in its policy, more free from feudal prejudices, than that of the Plantagenets.  Even Edward II. was tenacious of the commerce with Genoa, and an intercourse with the merchant princes of that republic probably served to associate the pursuits of commerce with the notion of rank and power.  Edward III. is still called the Father of English Commerce; but Edward IV. carried the theories of his ancestors into far more extensive practice, for his own personal profit.  This king, so indolent in the palace, was literally the most active merchant in the mart.  He traded largely in ships of his own, freighted with his own goods; and though, according to sound modern economics, this was anything but an aid to commerce, seeing that no private merchant could compete with a royal trader who went out and came in duty-free, yet certainly the mere companionship and association in risk and gain, and the common conversation that it made between the affable monarch and the homeliest trader, served to increase his popularity, and to couple it with respect for practical sense.  Edward IV. was in all this pre- eminently THE MAN OF HIS AGE,--not an inch behind it or before!  And, in addition to this happy position, he was one of those darlings of Nature, so affluent and blest in gifts of person, mind, and outward show, that it is only at the distance of posterity we ask why men of his own age admired the false, the licentious, and the cruel, where those contemporaries, over-dazzled, saw but the heroic and the joyous, the young, the beautiful,--the affable to friend, and the terrible to foe!  It was necessary to say thus much on the commercial tendencies of Edward, because, at this epoch, they operated greatly, besides other motives shortly to be made clear, in favour of the plot laid by the enemies of the Earl of Warwick, to dishonour that powerful minister and drive him from the councils of the king.  One morning Hastings received a summons to attend Edward, and on entering the royal chamber, he found already assembled Lord Rivers, the queen's father, Anthony Woodville, and the Earl of Worcester.  The king seemed thoughtful; he beckoned Hastings to approach, and placed in his hand a letter, dated from Rouen.  \"Read and judge, Hastings,\" said Edward.  The letter was from a gentleman in Warwick's train.  It gave a glowing account of the honours accorded to the earl by Louis XI., greater than those ever before manifested to a subject, and proceeded thus:--  \"But it is just I should apprise you that there be strange rumours as to the marvellous love that King Louis shows my lord the earl.  He lodgeth in the next house to him, and hath even had an opening made in the partition-wall between his own chamber and the earl's.  Men do say that the king visits him nightly, and there be those who think that so much stealthy intercourse between an English ambassador and the kinsman of Margaret of Anjou bodeth small profit to our grace the king.\"  \"I observe,\" said Hastings, glancing to the superscription, \"that this letter is addressed to my Lord Rivers.  Can he avouch the fidelity of his correspondent?\"  \"Surely, yes,\" answered Rivers; \"it is a gentleman of my own blood.\"  \"Were he not so accredited,\" returned Hastings, \"I should question the truth of a man who can thus consent to play the spy upon his lord and superior.\"  \"The public weal justifies all things,\" said the Earl of Worcester (who, though by marriage nearly connected to Warwick, eyed his power with the jealous scorn which the man of book-lore often feels for one whose talent lies in action),--\"so held our masters in all state- craft, the Greek and Roman.\"  \"Certes,\" said Sir Anthony Woodville, \"it grieveth the pride of an English knight that we should be beholden for courtesies to the born foe of England, which I take the Frenchman naturally to be.\"  \"Ah,\" said Edward, smiling sternly, \"I would rather be myself, with banner and trump, before the walls of Paris, than sending my cousin the earl to beg the French king's brother to accept my sister as a bride.  And what is to become of my good merchant-ships if Burgundy take umbrage and close its ports?\"  \"Beau sire,\" said Hastings,\" thou knowest how little cause I have to love the Earl of Warwick.  We all here, save your gracious self, bear the memory of some affront rendered to us by his pride and heat of mood! but in this council I must cease to be William de Hastings, and be all and wholly the king's servant.  I say first, then, with reference to these noble peers, that Warwick's faith to the House of York is too well proven to become suspected because of the courtesies of King Louis,--an artful craft, as it clearly seems to me, of the wily Frenchman, to weaken your throne, by provoking your distrust of its great supporter.  Fall we not into such a snare!  Moreover, we may be sure that Warwick cannot be false, if he achieve the object of his embassy,--namely, detach Louis from the side of Margaret and Lancaster by close alliance with Edward and York.  Secondly, sire, with regard to that alliance, which it seems you would repent,--I hold now, as I have held ever, that it is a master-stroke in policy, and the earl in this proves his sharp brain worthy his strong arm; for as his highness the Duke of Gloucester hath now clearly discovered that Margaret of Anjou has been of late in London, and that treasonable designs were meditated, though now frustrated, so we may ask why the friends of Lancaster really stood aloof; why all conspiracy was, and is, in vain?--Because, sire, of this very alliance with France; because the gold and subsidies of Louis are not forthcoming; because the Lancastrians see that if once Lord Warwick win France from the Red Rose, nothing short of such a miracle as their gaining Warwick instead can give a hope to their treason.  Your Highness fears the anger of Burgundy, and the suspension of your trade with the Flemings; but-- forgive me--this is not reasonable.  Burgundy dare not offend England, matched, as its arms are, with France; the Flemings gain more by you than you gain by the Flemings, and those interested burghers will not suffer any prince's quarrel to damage their commerce.  Charolois may bluster and threat, but the storm will pass, and Burgundy will be contented, if England remain neutral in the feud with France.  All these reasons, sire, urge me to support my private foe, the Lord Warwick, and to pray you to give no ear to the discrediting his Honour and his embassy.\"  The profound sagacity of these remarks, the repute of the speaker, and the well-known grudge between him and Warwick, for reasons hereafter to be explained, produced a strong effect upon the intellect of Edward, always vigorous, save when clouded with passion.  But Rivers, whose malice to the earl was indomitable, coldly recommenced,--  \"With submission to the Lord Hastings, sire, whom we know that love sometimes blinds, and whose allegiance to the earl's fair sister, the Lady of Bonville, perchance somewhat moves him to forget the day when Lord Warwick--\"  \"Cease, my lord,\" said Hastings, white with suppressed anger; \"these references beseem not the councils of grave men.\"  \"Tut, Hastings,\" said Edward, laughing merrily, \"women mix themselves up in all things: board or council, bed or battle,--wherever there is mischief astir, there, be sure, peeps a woman's sly face from her wimple.  Go on, Rivers.\"  \"Your pardon, my Lord Hastings,\" said Rivers, \"I knew not my thrust went so home; there is another letter I have not yet laid before "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7718"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 04 (#3)"],["body","king.\"  He drew forth a scroll from his bosom, and read as follows:--  \"Yesterday the earl feasted the king, and as, in discharge of mine office, I carved for my lord, I heard King Louis say, 'Pasque Dieu, my Lord Warwick, our couriers bring us word that Count Charolois declares he shall yet wed the Lady Margaret, and that he laughs at your ambassage.  What if our brother, King Edward, fall back from the treaty?'  'He durst not!' said the earl.\"  \"Durst not I\" exclaimed Edward, starting to his feet, and striking the table with his clenched hand, \"durst not!  Hastings, hear you that?\"  Hastings bowed his head in assent.  \"Is that all, Lord Rivers?\"  \"All! and methinks enough.\"  \"Enough, by my halidame!\" said Edward, laughing bitterly; \"he shall see what a king dares, when a subject threatens.  Admit the worshipful the deputies from our city of London,--lord chamberlain, it is thine office,--they await in the anteroom.\"  Hastings gravely obeyed, and in crimson gowns, with purple hoods and gold chains, marshalled into the king's presence a goodly deputation from the various corporate companies of London.  These personages advanced within a few paces of the dais, and there halted and knelt, while their spokesman read, on his knees, a long petition, praying the king to take into his gracious consideration the state of the trade with the Flemings; and though not absolutely venturing to name or to deprecate the meditated alliance with France, beseeching his grace to satisfy them as to certain rumours, already very prejudicial to their commerce, of the possibility of a breach with the Duke of Burgundy.  The merchant-king listened with great attention and affability to this petition; and replied shortly, that he thanked the deputation for their zeal for the public weal,--that a king would have enough to do if he contravened every gossip's tale; but that it was his firm purpose to protect, in all ways, the London traders, and to maintain the most amicable understanding with the Duke of Burgundy.  The supplicators then withdrew from the royal presence.  \"Note you how gracious the king was to me?\" whispered Master Heyford to one of his brethren; \"he looked at me while he answered.\"  \"Coxcomb!\" muttered the confidant, \"as if I did not catch his eye when he said, 'Ye are the pillars of the public weal!'  But because Master Heyford has a handsome wife he thinks he tosseth all London on his own horns!\"  As the citizens were quitting the palace, Lord Rivers joined them. \"You will thank me for suggesting this deputation, worthy sirs,\" said he, smiling significantly; \"you have timed it well!\"--and passing by them, without further comment, he took the way to the queen's chamber.  Elizabeth was playing with her infant daughter, tossing the child in the air, and laughing at its riotous laughter.  The stern old Duchess of Bedford, leaning over the back of the state-chair, looked on with all a grandmother's pride, and half chanted a nursery rhyme.  It was a sight fair to see!  Elizabeth never seemed more lovely: her artificial, dissimulating smile changed into hearty, maternal glee, her smooth cheek flushed with exercise, a stray ringlet escaping from the stiff coif!--And, alas, the moment the two ladies caught sight of Rivers, all the charm was dissolved; the child was hastily put on the floor; the queen, half ashamed of being natural, even before her father, smoothed back the rebel lock, and the duchess, breaking off in the midst of her grandam song, exclaimed,--  \"Well, well! how thrives our policy?\"  \"The king,\" answered Rivers, \"is in the very mood we could desire.  At the words, 'He durst not!' the Plantagenet sprung up in his breast; and now, lest he ask to see the rest of the letter, thus I destroy it; \"and flinging the scroll in the blazing hearth, he watched it consume.  \"Why this, sir?\" said the queen.  \"Because, my Elizabeth, the bold words glided off into a decent gloss,--'He durst not,' said Warwick, 'because what a noble heart dares least is to belie the plighted word, and what the kind heart shuns most is to wrong the confiding friend.\"  \"It was fortunate,\" said the duchess, \"that Edward took heat at the first words, nor stopped, it seems, for the rest!\"  \"I was prepared, Jacquetta; had he asked to see the rest, I should have dropped the scroll into the brazier, as containing what I would not presume to read.  Courage!  Edward has seen the merchants; he has flouted Hastings,--who would gainsay us.  For the rest, Elizabeth, be it yours to speak of affronts paid by the earl to your highness; be it yours, Jacquetta, to rouse Edward's pride by dwelling on Warwick's overweening power; be it mine to enlist his interest on behalf of his merchandise; be it Margaret's to move his heart by soft tears for the bold Charolois; and ere a month be told, Warwick shall find his embassy a thriftless laughing-stock, and no shade pass between the House of Woodville and the sun of England.\"  \"I am scarce queen while Warwick is minister,\" said Elizabeth, vindictively.  \"How he taunted me in the garden, when we met last!\"  \"But hark you, daughter and lady liege, hark you!  Edward is not prepared for the decisive stroke.  I have arranged with Anthony, whose chivalrous follies fit him not for full comprehension of our objects, how upon fair excuse the heir of Burgundy's brother--the Count de la Roche--shall visit London; and the count once here, all is ours! Hush! take up the little one,--Edward comes!\"     CHAPTER III.  WHEREIN MASTER NICHOLAS ALWYN VISITS THE COURT, AND THERE LEARNS MATTER OF WHICH THE ACUTE READER WILL JUDGE FOR HIMSELF.  It was a morning towards the end of May (some little time after Edward's gracious reception of the London deputies), when Nicholas Alwyn, accompanied by two servitors armed to the teeth,--for they carried with them goods of much value, and even in the broad daylight and amidst the most frequented parts of the city, men still confided little in the security of the law,--arrived at the Tower, and was conducted to the presence of the queen.  Elizabeth and her mother were engaged in animated but whispered conversation when the goldsmith entered; and there was an unusual gayety in the queen's countenance as she turned to Alwyn and bade him show her his newest gauds.  While with a curiosity and eagerness that seemed almost childlike Elizabeth turned over rings, chains, and brooches, scarcely listening to Alwyn's comments on the lustre of the gems or the quaintness of the fashion, the duchess disappeared for a moment, and returned with the Princess Margaret.  This young princess had much of the majestic beauty of her royal brother; but, instead of the frank, careless expression so fascinating in Edward, there was, in her full and curved lip and bright large eye, something at once of haughtiness and passion, which spoke a decision and vivacity of character beyond her years.  \"Choose for thyself, sweetheart and daughter mine,\" said the duchess, affectionately placing her hand on Margaret's luxuriant hair, \"and let the noble visitor we await confess that our rose of England outblooms the world.\"  The princess coloured with complaisant vanity at these words, and, drawing near the queen, looked silently at a collar of pearls, which Elizabeth held.  \"If I may adventure so to say,\" observed Alwyn, \"pearls will mightily beseem her highness's youthful bloom; and lo! here be some adornments for the bodice or partelet, to sort with the collar; not,\" added the goldsmith, bowing low, and looking down,--\"not perchance displeasing to her highness, in that they are wrought in the guise of the fleur de lis--\"  An impatient gesture in the queen, and a sudden cloud over the fair brow of Margaret, instantly betokened to the shrewd trader that he had committed some most unwelcome error in this last allusion to the alliance with King Louis of France, which, according to rumour, the Earl of Warwick had well-nigh brought to a successful negotiation; and to convince him yet more of his mistake, the duchess said haughtily, \"Good fellow, be contented to display thy goods, and spare us thy comments.  As for thy hideous fleur de lis, an' thy master had no better device, he would not long rest the king's jeweller.\"  \"I have no heart for the pearls,\" said Margaret, abruptly; \"they are at best pale and sicklied.  What hast thou of bolder ornament and more dazzling lustrousness?\"  \"These emeralds, it is said, were once among the jewels of the great House of Burgundy,\" observed Nicholas, slowly, and fixing his keen, sagacious look on the royal purchasers.  \"Of Burgundy!\" exclaimed the queen.  \"It is true,\" said the Duchess of Bedford, looking at the ornament with care, and slightly colouring,--for in fact the jewels had been a present from Philip the Good to the Duke of Bedford, and the exigencies of the civil wars had led, some time since, first to their mortgage, or rather pawn, and then to their sale.  The princess passed her arm affectionately round Jacquetta's neck, and said, \"If you leave me my choice, I will have none but these emeralds.\"  The two elder ladies exchanged looks and smiles.  \"Hast thou travelled, young man?\" asked the duchess.  \"Not in foreign parts, gracious lady, but I have lived much with those who have been great wanderers.\"  \"Ah, and what say they of the ancient friends of mine House, the princes of Burgundy?\"  \"Lady, all men agree that a nobler prince and a juster than Duke Philip never reigned over brave men; and those who have seen the wisdom of his rule, grieve sorely to think so excellent and mighty a lord should have trouble brought to his old age by the turbulence of his son, the Count of Charolois.\"  Again Margaret's fair brow lowered, and the duchess hastened to answer, \"The disputes between princes, young man, can never be rightly understood by such as thou and thy friends.  The Count of Charolois is a noble gentleman; and fire in youth will break out.  Richard the Lion Hearted of England was not less"]]]
