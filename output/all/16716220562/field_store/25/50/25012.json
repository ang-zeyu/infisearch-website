The Slave      having served six years must be paid for his Service, must be paid      liberally because he had been worth even more than a hired servant      during the period of his enslavement.       \"If, then,\" continued Mr. Harlan, \"the justice of this claim cannot      be found either in Reason, Natural Justice, or the principles of      the Common Law, or in any positive Municipal or Statute regulation      of any State, or in the Hebrew Code written by the Finger of God      protruded from the flame of fire on the summit of Sinai, I ask      whence the origin of the title to the services of the adult      offspring of the Slave mother?  or is it not manifest that there is      no just title?  Is it not a mere usurpation without any known mode      of justification, under any existing Code of Laws, human or      Divine?\"]  He also undertook to justify Secession on the singular ground that \"we are sprung from a Race of Secessionists,\" the proof of which he held to be in the fact that, while the preamble to, as well as the body of the Convention of Ratification of, the old Articles of Confederation between the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, declared that Confederation to be a \"Perpetual Union,\" yet, within nine years thereafter, all the other States Seceded from New York, Virginia, North Carolina, and Rhode Island by ratifying the new Constitution for \"a more perfect Union.\"  He also endeavored to maintain the extraordinary proposition that \"if the Senate of the United States were to adopt this Joint-resolution, and were to submit it to all the States of this Union, and if three-fourths of the States should ratify the Amendment, it would not be binding on any State whose interest was affected by it, if that State protested against it!\"  And beyond all this, he re-echoed the old, old cry of the Border-state men, that \"the time is unpropitious for such a measure as this.\"  Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, however, by his great speech, of April 5th, in the Senate, did much to clear the tangle in the minds of some faltering Union statesmen on this important subject.  He reviewed the question of human Slavery from the time when the Constitutional Convention was held; showed that at that period, as well as at the time of the Declaration of our Independence \"there was but one sentiment upon the subject among enlightened Southern statesmen\"--and that was, that Slavery \"is a great affliction to any Country where it prevails;\" and declared that \"a prosperous and permanent Peace can never be secured if the Institution is permitted to survive.\"  He then traversed the various methods by which statesmen were seeking to prevent that survival of Slavery, addressing himself by turns to the arguments of those who, with John Sherman, \"seemed,\" said he, \"to consider it as within the power of Congress by virtue of its Legislative authority;\" to those of the \"many well-judging men, with the President at their head, who,\" to again use his own words, \"seem to suppose that it is within the reach of the Executive;\" and lastly, to those \"who express the opinion that it is not within the scope of either Executive or Legislative authority, or of Constitutional Amendment;\" and after demolishing the arguments of those who held the two former of these positions, he proceeded to rebut the assumption that Slavery could not be abolished at all because it was not originally abolished by the Constitution.  Continuing, he said: \"Remember, now, the question is, can that Institution, which deals with Humanity as Property, which claims to shackle the mind, the soul, and the body, which brings to the level of the brute a portion of the race of Man, cease to be within the reach of the political power of the People of the United States, not because it was not at one time within their power, but because at that time they did not exert the power?  \"What says the Preamble to the Constitution?  How pregnant with a conclusive answer is the Preamble, to the proposition that Slavery cannot be abolished!  What does that Preamble state to have been the chief objects that the great and wise and good men had at heart, in recommending the Constitution, with that Preamble, to the adoption of the American People?  That Justice might be established; that Tranquillity might be preserved; that the common Defense and general Welfare might be maintained; and, last and chief of all, that Liberty might be secured.  \"Is there no Justice in putting an end to human Slavery?  Is there no danger to the Tranquillity of the Country in its existence?  May it not interfere with the common Defense and general Welfare?  And, above all, is it consistent with any notion, which the mind of man can conceive, of human Liberty?\"  He held that the very Amendatory clause of the Constitution under which it was proposed to make this Amendment, was probably inserted there from a conviction of that coming time \"when Justice would call so loudly for the extinction of the Institution that her call could not be disobeyed,\" and, when \"the Peace and Tranquillity of the Land would demand, in thunder tones,\" its destruction, \"as inconsistent with such Peace and Tranquillity.\"  To the atrocious pretence that \"there was a right to make a Slave of any human being\"--which he said would have shocked every one of the framers of the Constitution had they heard it; and, what he termed, the nauseous declaration that \"Slavery of the Black race is of Divine origin,\" and was intended to be perpetual; he said:  \"The Saviour of Mankind did not put an end to it by physical power, or by the declaration of any existing illegality, in word.  His mission upon Earth was not to propagate His doctrines by force.  He came to save, not to conquer.  His purpose was not to march armed legions throughout the habitable Globe, securing the allegiance of those for whose safety He was striving.  He warred by other influences.  He aimed at the heart, principally.  He inculcated his doctrines, more ennobling than any that the World, enlightened as it was before His advent upon Earth, had been able to discover.  He taught to Man the obligation of brotherhood.  He announced that the true duty of Man was to do to others as he would have others do to him--to all men, the World over; and unless some convert to the modern doctrine that Slavery itself finds not only a guarantee for its existence, but for its legal existence, in the Scripture, excepts from the operation of the influences which His morality brought to bear on the mind of the Christian world, the Black man, and shows that it was not intended to apply to Black men, then it is not true, it cannot be true, that He designed His doctrine not to be equally applicable to the Black and to the White, to the Race of Man as he then existed, or as he might exist in all after-time.\"  To the assumption that the African Slaves were too utterly deficient and degraded, mentally and morally, to appreciate the blessings of Freedom, he opposed the eloquent fact that \"wherever the flag of the United States, the symbol of human Liberty, now goes; under it, from their hereditary bondage, are to be found men and women and children assembling and craving its protection 'fleeing from' the iron of oppression that had pierced their souls, to the protection of that flag where they are 'gladdened by the light of Liberty.'\"  \"It is idle to deny,\" said he--\"we feel it in our own persons--how, with reference to that sentiment, all men are brethren.  Look to the illustrations which the times now afford, how, in the illustration of that sentiment, do we differ from the Black man?  He is willing to incur every personal danger which promises to result in throwing down his shackles, and making him tread the Earth, which God has created for all, as a man, and not as a Slave.\"  Said he: \"It is an instinct of the Soul.  Tyranny may "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7138"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 6 (#6)"],["body","it for ages and centuries; the pall of despotism may hang over it; but the sentiment is ever there; it kindles into a flame in the very furnace of affliction, and it avails itself of the first opportunity that offers, promising the least chance of escape, and wades through blood and slaughter to achieve it, and, whether it succeeds or fails, demonstrates, vindicates in the very effort, the inextinguishable right to Liberty.\"  He thought that mischiefs might result from this measure, owing to the uneducated condition of the Slave, but they would be but temporary.  At all events to \"suffer those Africans,\" said he, \"whom we are calling around our standard, and asking to aid us in restoring the Constitution and the power of the Government to its rightful authority, to be reduced to bondage again,\" would be \"a disgrace to the Nation.\"  The \"Institution\" must be terminated.  \"Terminate it,\" continued he, \"and the wit of man will, as I think, be unable to devise any other topic upon which we can be involved in a fratricidal strife.  God and nature, judging by the history of the past, intend us to be one.  Our unity is written in the mountains and the rivers, in which we all have an interest.  The very differences of climate render each important to the other, and alike important.  \"That mighty horde which, from time to time, have gone from the Atlantic, imbued with all the principles of human Freedom which animated their fathers in running the perils of the mighty Deep and seeking Liberty here, are now there; and as they have said, they will continue to say, until time shall be no more: 'We mean that the Government in future shall be, as it has been in the past--Once an exemplar of human Freedom, for the light and example of the World; illustrating in the blessings and the happiness it confers, the truth of the principles incorporated into the Declaration of Independence, that Life and Liberty are Man's inalienable right.\"  Fortunately the Democratic opposition, in the Senate, to this measure, was too small in numbers to beat the proposed Amendment, but by offering amendments to it, its enemies succeeded in delaying its adoption.  However, on the 5th of April, an amendment, offered by Garrett Davis, was acted upon.  It was to strike out all after the preamble of the XIIIth Article of Amendment to the Constitution, proposed by the Judiciary Committee, and insert the words:  \"No Negro, or Person whose mother or grandmother is or was a Negro, shall be a citizen of the United States and be eligible to any Civil or Military office, or to any place of trust or profit under the United States.\"  Mr. Davis's amendment was rejected by a vote of 5 yeas to 32 nays; when he immediately moved to amend, by adding precisely the same words at the end of Section 1 of the proposed Article.  It was again rejected.  He then moved to amend by adding to the said Section these words:  \"But no Slave shall be entitled to his or her Freedom under this Amendment if resident at the time it takes effect in any State, the laws of which forbid Free Negroes to reside therein, until removed from such State by the Government of the United States.\"  This also was rejected.  Whereupon Mr. Powell moved to add, at the end of the first Section, the words:  \"No Slave shall be Emancipated by this Article unless the owner thereof shall be first paid the value of the Slave or Slaves so Emancipated.\"  This likewise was rejected, on a yea and nay vote, by 2 yeas (Davis and Powell) to 34 nays; when Mr. Davis moved another amendment, viz.: to add at the end of Section 2 of the proposed Article, the following:  \"And when this Amendment of the Constitution shall have taken effect by Freeing the Slaves, Congress shall provide for the distribution and settlement of all the population of African descent in the United States among the several States and Territories thereof, in proportion to the White population of each State and Territory to the aggregate population of those of African descent.\"  This met a like fate; whereupon the Senate adjourned, but, on the following day, the matter came up again for consideration:  Hale, of New Hampshire, jubilantly declared that \"this is a day that I and many others have long wished for, long hoped for, long striven for. * * *  A day when the Nation is to commence its real life; or, if it is not the day, it is the dawning of the day; the day is near at hand * * * when the American People are to wake up to the meaning of the sublime truths which their fathers uttered years ago, and which have slumbered, dead-letters, upon the pages of our Constitution, of our Declaration of Independence, and of our history.\"  McDougall, of California, on the other hand,--utterly regardless of the grandly patriotic resolutions of the Legislature of his State, which had just been presented to the Senate by his colleague--lugubriously declared:  \"In my judgment, it may well be said of us:                 'Let the Heavens be hung in black                And let the Earth put mourning on,'  for in the history of no Free People, since the time the Persians came down upon Athens, have I known as melancholy a period as this day and year of Our Lord in our history; and if we can, by the blessing of God and by His favor, rise above it, it will be by His special providence, and by no act of ours.\"  The obstructive tactics were now resumed, Mr. Powell leading off by a motion to amend, by adding to the Judiciary Committee's proposed Thirteenth Article of the Constitution, the following:  \"ART. 14.--The President and Vice-President shall hold their Offices for the term of four--[Which he subsequently modified to: 'six years'] --years.  The person who has filled the Office of President shall not be reeligible.\"  This amendment was rejected by 12 yeas to 32 nays; whereupon Mr. Powell moved to add to the Committee's Proposition another new Article, as follows:  \"ART. 14.--The principal Officer in each of the Executive Departments, and all persons connected with the Diplomatic Service, may be removed from office at the pleasure of the President.  All other officers of the Executive Departments may be removed at any time by the President or other appointing power when their services are unnecessary, or for dishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty, and when so removed, the removal shall be reported to the Senate, together with the reasons therefor.\"  This amendment also being rejected, Mr. Powell offered another, which was to add a separate Article as follows:  \"ART. 14.--Every law, or Resolution having the force of law, shall relate to but one subject, and that shall be expressed in its title.\"  This also being rejected--the negative vote being, as in other cases, without reference to the merits of the proposition--and Mr. Powell having now apparently exhausted his obstructive amendatory talents, Mr. Davis came to the aid of his Kentucky colleague by moving an amendment, to come in as an additional Article, being a new plan of Presidential election designed to do away with the quadrennial Presidential campaign before the People by giving to each State the right to nominate one candidate, and leaving it to a Convention of both Houses of Congress --and, in case of disagreement, to the Supreme Court of the United States --to elect a President and a Vice-President.  The rejection of this proposition apparently exhausted the stock of possible amendments possessed by the Democratic opposition, and the Joint Resolution, precisely as it came from the Judiciary Committee, having been agreed to by that body, \"as in Committee of the Whole,\" was now, April 6th, reported to the Senate for its concurrence.  On the following day, Mr. Hendricks uttered a lengthy jeremiad on the War, and its lamentable results; intimated that along the Mississippi, the Negroes, freed by the advance of our invading Armies and Navies, instead of being happy and industrious, were without protection or provision and almost without clothing, while at least 200,000 of them had prematurely perished, and that such was the fate reserved for the 4,000,000 Negroes if liberated; and declared he would not vote for the Resolution, \"because,\" said he, \"the times are not auspicious.\"  Very different indeed was the attitude of Mr. Henderson, of Missouri, Border-State man though he was.  In the course of a speech, of much power, which he opened with an allusion to the 115,000 Slaves owned in his State in 1860--as showing how deeply interested Missouri \"must be in the pending proposition\"--the Senator announced that: \"Our great interest, as lovers of the Union, is in the preservation and perpetuation of the Union.\"  He declared himself a Slaveholder, yet none the less desired the adoption of this Thirteenth Article of Amendment, for, said he: \"We cannot save the Institution if we would.  We ought not if we could.  * * *  If it were a blessing, I, for one, would be defending it to the last.  It is a curse, and not a blessing.  Therefore let it go.  * * * Let the iniquity be cast away!\"  It was about this time that a remarkable letter written by Mr. Lincoln to a Kentuckian, on the subject of Emancipation, appeared in print.  It is interesting as being not alone the President's own statement of his views, from the beginning, as to Slavery, and how he came to be \"driven\" to issue the Proclamation of Emancipation, and as showing how the Union Cause had gained by its issue, but also in disclosing, indirectly, how incessantly the subject was revolved in his own mind, and urged by him upon the minds of others.  The publication of the letter, moreover, was not without its effect on the ultimate action of the Congress and the States in adopting the Thirteenth Amendment.  It ran thus:                        \"EXECUTIVE MANSION.                     \"WASHINGTON, April 4, 1864.  \"A. G. HODGES, Esq., Frankfort, Ky.  \"MY DEAR SIR: You ask me to put in writing the substance of--what I verbally said "]]]
