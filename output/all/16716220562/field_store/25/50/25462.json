I shudder at thy resolve.  I dread that thou should meet this man, whom an oath hath bound thee to obey.  Nay, frown not--I bow to thy will, my brother and my King.  I know that thou hast chosen as thy conscience sanctions, as thy duty ordains.  But come back--Oh, come back--thou who, like me,\" (her voice whispered,) \"hast sacrificed the household hearth to thy country's altars,--and I will never pray to Heaven to love thee less-- my brother, O my brother!\"  In all the room were then heard but the low sounds of sobs and broken exclamations.  All clustered to one spot-Leofwine and his betrothed-- Gurth and his bride--even the selfish Aldyth, ennobled by the contagion of the sublime emotion,--all clustered round Githa the mother of the three guardians of the fated land, and all knelt before her, by the side of Harold.  Suddenly, the widowed Queen, the virgin wife of the last heir of Cerdic, rose, and holding on high the sacred rood over those bended heads, said, with devout passion:  \"O Lord of Hosts--We Children of Doubt and Time, trembling in the dark, dare not take to ourselves to question thine unerring will. Sorrow and death, as joy and life, are at the breath of a mercy divine, and a wisdom all-seeing: and out of the hours of evil thou drawest, in mystic circle, the eternity of Good.  'Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.'  If, O Disposer of events, our human prayers are not adverse to thy pre-judged decrees, protect these lives, the bulwarks of our homes and altars, sons whom the land offers as a sacrifice.  May thine angel turn aside the blade--as of old from the heart of Isaac!  But if, O Ruler of Nations, in whose sight the ages are as moments, and generations but as sands in the sea, these lives are doomed, may the death expiate their sins, and, shrived on the battle-field, absolve and receive the souls!\"     CHAPTER IV.   By the altar of the Abbey Church of Waltham, that night, knelt Edith in prayer for Harold.  She had taken up her abode in a small convent of nuns that adjoined the more famous monastery of Waltham; but she had promised Hilda not to enter on the novitiate, until the birthday of Harold had passed. She herself had no longer faith in the omens and prophecies that had deceived her youth and darkened her life; and, in the more congenial air of our Holy Church, the spirit, ever so chastened, grew calm and resigned.  But the tidings of the Norman's coming, and the King's victorious return to his capital, had reached even that still retreat; and love, which had blent itself with religion, led her steps to that lonely altar.  And suddenly, as she there knelt, only lighted by the moon through the high casements, she was startled by the sound of approaching feet and murmuring voices.  She rose in alarm--the door of the church was thrown open--torches advanced--and amongst the monks, between Osgood and Ailred, came the King.  He had come, that last night before his march, to invoke the prayers of that pious brotherhood; and by the altar he had founded, to pray, himself, that his one sin of faith forfeited and oath abjured, might not palsy his arm and weigh on his soul in the hour of his country's need.  Edith stifled the cry that rose to her lips, as the torches fell on the pale and hushed and melancholy face of Harold; and she crept away under the arch of the vast Saxon columns, and into the shade of abutting walls.  The monks and the King, intent on their holy office, beheld not that solitary and shrinking form.  They approached the altar; and there the King knelt down lowlily, and none heard the prayer.  But as Osgood held the sacred rood over the bended head of the royal suppliant, the Image on the crucifix (which had been a gift from Alred the prelate, and was supposed to have belonged of old to Augustine, the first founder of the Saxon Church--so that, by the superstition of the age, it was invested with miraculous virtues) bowed itself visibly.  Visibly, the pale and ghastly image of the suffering God bowed over the head of the kneeling man; whether the fastenings of the rood were loosened, or from what cause soever,--in the eyes of all the brotherhood, the Image bowed. [254]  A thrill of terror froze every heart, save Edith's, too remote to perceive the portent, and save the King's, whom the omen seemed to doom, for his face was buried in his clasped hands.  Heavy was his heart, nor needed it other warnings than its own gloom.  Long and silently prayed the King; and when at last he rose, and the monks, though with altered and tremulous voices, began their closing hymn, Edith passed noislessly along the wall, and, stealing through one of the smaller doors which communicated to the nunnery annexed, gained the solitude of her own chamber.  There she stood, benumbed with the strength of her emotions at the sight of Harold thus abruptly presented.  How had the fond human heart leapt to meet him!  Twice, thus, in the august ceremonials of Religion, secret, shrinking, unwitnessed, had she, his betrothed, she, the partner of his soul, stood aloof to behold him.  She had seen him in the hour of his pomp, the crown upon his brow,--seen him in the hour of his peril and agony, that anointed head bowed to the earth.  And in the pomp that she could not share, she had exulted; but, oh, now--now,--oh now that she could have knelt beside that humbled form, and prayed with that voiceless prayer!  The torches flashed in the court below; the church was again deserted; the monks passed in mute procession back to their cloister; but a single man paused, turned aside, and stopped at the gate of the humbler convent: a knocking was heard at the great oaken door, and the watch-dog barked.  Edith started, pressed her hand on her heart and trembled.  Steps approached her door--and the abbess, entering, summoned her below, to hear the farewell greeting of her cousin the King.  Harold stood in the simple hall of the cloister: a single taper, tall and wan, burned on the oak board.  The abbess led Edith by the hand, and at a sign from the King, withdrew.  So, once more upon earth, the betrothed and divided were alone.  \"Edith,\" said the King, in a voice in which no ear but hers could have detected the struggle, \"do not think I have come to disturb thy holy calm, or sinfully revive the memories of the irrevocable past: where once on my breast, in the old fashion of our fathers, I wrote thy name, is written now the name of the mistress that supplants thee. Into Eternity melts the Past; but I could not depart to a field from which there is no retreat--in which, against odds that men say are fearful, I have resolved to set my crown and my life--without once more beholding thee, pure guardian of my happier days!  Thy forgiveness for all the sorrow that, in the darkness which surrounds man's hopes and dreams, I have brought on thee (dread return for love so enduring, so generous and divine!)--thy forgiveness I will not ask. Thou alone perhaps on earth knowest the soul of Harold; and if he hath wronged thee, thou seest alike in the wronger and the wronged, but the children of iron Duty, the servants of imperial Heaven.  Not thy forgivenness I ask--but--but--Edith, holy maid! angel soul!--thy--thy blessing!\"  His voice faltered, and he inclined his lofty head as to a saint.  \"Oh that I had the power to bless!\" exclaimed Edith, mastering her rush of tears with a heroic effort; \"and methinks I have the power-- not from virtues of my own, but from all that I owe to thee!  The grateful have the power to bless.  For what do I not owe to thee--owe to that very love of which even the grief is sacred?  Poor child in the house of the heathen, thy love descended upon me, and in it, the smile of God!  In that love my spirit awoke, and was baptised: every thought that has risen from earth, and lost itself in heaven, was breathed into my heart by thee!  Thy creature and thy slave, hadst thou tempted me to sin, sin had seemed hallowed by thy voice; but thou saidst 'True love is virtue,' and so I worshipped virtue in loving thee.  Strengthened, purified, by thy bright companionship, from thee came the strength to resign thee--from thee the refuge under the wings of God--from thee the firm assurance that our union yet shall be--not as our poor Hilda dreams, on the perishable earth,--but there! oh, there! yonder by the celestial altars, in the land in which all spirits are filled with love.  Yes, soul of Harold! there are might and holiness in the blessing the soul thou hast redeemed and reared sheds on thee!\"  And so beautiful, so unlike the Beautiful of the common earth, looked the maid as she thus spoke, and laid hands, trembling with no human passion, on that royal head-that could a soul from paradise be made visible, such might be the shape it would wear to a mortal's eye! Thus, for some moments both were silent; and in the silence the gloom vanished from the heart of Harold, and, through a deep and sublime serenity, it rose undaunted to front the future.  No embrace--no farewell kiss--profaned the parting of those pure and noble spirits--parting on the threshold of the grave.  It was only the spirit that clasped the spirit, looking forth from the clay into measureless eternity.  Not till the air of night came once more on his brow, and the moonlight rested on the roofs and fanes of the land entrusted to his charge, was the man once more the human hero; not till she was alone in her desolate chamber, and the terrors of the coming battle-field chased the angel from her thoughts was the maid inspired, once more the weeping woman.  A little after sunrise the abbess, who was distantly akin to the house of Godwin, sought Edith, so agitated by her own fear, that she did not remark the trouble of her visitor.  The supposed miracle of the sacred Image bowing over the kneeling King, had spread dismay through the cloisters of both nunnery"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7683"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 12 (#3)"],["body"," abbey; and so intense was the disquietude of the two brothers, Osgood and Ailred, in the simple and grateful affection they bore their royal benefactor, that they had obeyed the impulse of their tender credulous hearts, and left the monastery with the dawn, intending to follow the King's march [255], and watch and pray near the awful battle-field.  Edith listened, and made no reply; the terrors of the abbess infected her; the example of the two monks woke the sole thought which stirred through the nightmare dream that suspended reason itself; and when, at noon the abbess again sought the chamber, Edith was gone;--gone, and alone-- none knew wherefore--one guessed whither.  All the pomp of the English army burst upon Harold's view, as, in the rising sun, he approached the bridge of the capital.  Over that bridge came the stately march,--battle-axe, and spear, and banner, glittering in the ray.  And as he drew aside, and the forces filed before him, the cry of; \"God save King Harold!\" rose with loud acclaim and lusty joy, borne over the waves of the river, startling the echoes in the ruined keape of the Roman, heard in the halls restored by Canute, and chiming, like a chorus, with the chaunts of the monks by the tomb of Sebba in St. Paul's--by the tomb of Edward at St. Peter's.  With a brightened face, and a kindling eye, the King saluted his lines, and then fell into the ranks towards the rear, where among the burghers of London and the lithsmen of Middlesex, the immemorial custom of Saxon monarchs placed the kingly banner.  And, looking up, he beheld, not his old standard with the Tiger heads and the Cross, but a banner both strange and gorgeous.  On a field of gold was the effigies of a Fighting Warrior; and the arms were bedecked in orient pearls, and the borders blazed in the rising sun, with ruby, amethyst, and emerald.  While he gazed, wondering, on this dazzling ensign, Haco, who rode beside the standard-bearer, advanced, and gave him a letter.  \"Last night,\" said he, \"after thou hadst left the palace, many recruits, chiefly from Hertfordshire and Essex, came in; but the most gallant and stalwart of all, in arms and in stature, were the lithsmen of Hilda.  With them came this banner, on which she has lavished the gems that have passed to her hand through long lines of northern ancestors, from Odin, the founder of all northern thrones.  So, at least, said the bode of our kinswoman.\"  Harold had already cut the silk round the letter, and was reading its contents.  They ran thus:--  \"King of England, I forgive thee the broken heart of my grandchild. They whom the land feeds, should defend the land.  I send to thee, in tribute the best fruits that grow in the field, and the forest, round the house which my husband took from the bounty of Canute;--stout hearts and strong hands!  Descending alike, as do Hilda and Harold (through Githa thy mother,) from the Warrior God of the North, whose race never shall fail--take, O defender of the Saxon children of Odin, the banner I have broidered with the gems that the Chief of the Asas bore from the East.  Firm as love be thy foot, strong as death be thy hand, under the shade which the banner of Hilda,--under the gleam which the jewels of Odin,--cast on the brows of the King!  So Hilda, the daughter of monarchs, greets Harold the leader of men.\"  Harold looked up from the letter, and Haco resumed:  \"Thou canst guess not the cheering effect which this banner, supposed to be charmed, and which the name of Odin alone would suffice to make holy, at least with thy fierce Anglo-Danes, hath already produced through the army.\"  \"It is well, Haco,\" said Harold with a smile.  \"Let priest add his blessing to Hilda's charm, and Heaven will pardon any magic that makes more brave the hearts that defend its altars.  Now fall we back, for the army must pass beside the hill with the crommell and gravestone; there, be sure, Hilda will be at watch for our march, and we will linger a few moments to thank her somewhat for her banner, yet more justly, methinks, for her men.  Are not yon stout fellows all in mail, so tall and so orderly, in advance of the London burghers, Hilda's aid to our Fyrd?\"  \"They are,\" answered Haco.  The King backed his steed to accost them with his kingly greeting; and then, with Haco, falling yet farther to the rear seemed engaged in inspecting the numerous wains, bearing missiles and forage, that always accompanied the march of a Saxon army, and served to strengthen its encampment.  But when they came in sight of the hillock by which the great body of the army had preceded them, the King and the son of Sweyn dismounted and on foot entered the large circle of the Celtic ruin.  By the side of the Teuton altar they beheld two forms, both perfectly motionless: but one was extended on the ground as in sleep or in death; the other sate beside it, as if watching the corpse, or guarding the slumber.  The face of the last was not visible, propped upon the arms which rested on the knees, and bidden by the hands.  But in the face of the other, as the two men drew near, they recognised the Danish Prophetess.  Death in its dreadest characters was written on that ghastly face; woe and terror, beyond all words to describe, spoke in the haggard brow, the distorted lips, and the wild glazed stare of the open eyes.  At the startled cry of the intruders on that dreary silence, the living form moved; and though still leaning its face on its hands, it raised its head; and never countenance of Northern Vampire, cowering by the rifled grave, was more fiendlike and appalling.  \"Who and what art thou?\" said the King; \"and how, thus unhonored in the air of heaven, lies the corpse of the noble Hilda?  Is this the hand of Nature?  Haco, Haco, so look the eyes, so set the features, of those whom the horror of ruthless murder slays even before the steel strikes.  Speak, hag, art thou dumb?\"  \"Search the body,\" answered the witch, \"there is no wound!  Look to the throat,--no mark of the deadly gripe!  I have seen such in my day.--There are none on this corpse, I trow; yet thou sayest rightly, horror slew her!  Ha, ha! she would know, and she hath known; she would raise the dead and the demon; she hath raised them; she would read the riddle,--she hath read it.  Pale King and dark youth, would ye learn what Hilda saw, eh? eh?  Ask her in the Shadow-World where she awaits ye!  Ha! ye too would be wise in the future; ye too would climb to heaven through the mysteries of hell.  Worms! worms! crawl back to the clay--to the earth!  One such night as the hag ye despise enjoys as her sport and her glee, would freeze your veins, and sear the life in your eyeballs, and leave your corpses to terror and wonder, like the carcase that lies at your feet!\"  \"Ho!\" cried the King, stamping his foot.  \"Hence, Haco; rouse the household; summon hither the handmaids; call henchman and ceorl to guard this foul raven.\"  Haco obeyed; but when he returned with the shuddering and amazed attendants, the witch was gone, and the King was leaning against the altar with downcast eyes, and a face troubled and dark with thought.  The body of the Vala was borne into the house; and the King, waking from his reverie, bade them send for the priests and ordered masses for the parted soul.  Then kneeling, with pious hand he closed the eyes and smoothed the features, and left his mournful kiss on the icy brow.  These offices fulfilled, he took Haco's arm, and leaning on it, returned to the spot on which they had left their steeds.  Not evincing surprise or awe,--emotions that seemed unknown to his gloomy, settled, impassible nature--Haco said calmly, as they descended the knoll:  \"What evil did the hag predict to thee?\"  \"Haco,\" answered the King, \"yonder, by the shores of Sussex, lies all the future which our eyes now should scan, and our hearts should be firm to meet.  These omens and apparitions are but the ghosts of a dead Religion; spectres sent from the grave of the fearful Heathenesse; they may appal but to lure us from our duty.  Lo, as we gaze around--the ruins of all the creeds that have made the hearts of men quake with unsubstantial awe--lo, the temple of the Briton!--lo, the fane of the Roman!--lo, the mouldering altar of our ancestral Thor!  Ages past lie wrecked around us in these shattered symbols.  A new age hath risen, and a new creed.  Keep we to the broad truths before us; duty here; knowledge comes alone in the Hereafter.\"  \"That Hereafter!--is it not near?\" murmured Haco.  They mounted in silence; and ere they regained the army paused, by a common impulse, and looked behind.  Awful in their desolation rose the temple and the altar!  And in Hilda's mysterious death it seemed that their last and lingering Genius,--the Genius of the dark and fierce, the warlike and the wizard North, had expired for ever.  Yet, on the outskirt of the forest, dusk and shapeless, that witch without a name stood in the shadow, pointing towards them, with outstretched arm, in vague and denouncing menace;--as if, come what may, all change of creed,--be the faith ever so simple, the truth ever so bright and clear,--there is a SUPERSTITION native to that Border-land between the Visible and the Unseen, which will find its priest and its votaries, till the full and crowning splendour of Heaven shall melt every shadow from the world!     CHAPTER V.   On the broad plain between Pevensey and Hastings, Duke William had arrayed his armaments.  In the rear he had built a castle of wood, all the framework of which he had brought with him, and which was to serve as a refuge in case of retreat.  His ships he had run into deep water, and scuttled; so that the thought of return, without victory, might be banished from his miscellaneous and multitudinous force.  His outposts stretched for miles, keeping watch night and day against surprise. The ground chosen was adapted for all the manoeuvres of a cavalry never before paralleled in England nor perhaps"]]]
