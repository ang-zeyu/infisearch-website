Harold took the scroll, and bent over it, reading by the mingled light of the lamp and the dawn:  \"All hail, Harold, heir of Godwin the great, and Githa the king-born! Thou hast obeyed Hilda, and thou knowest now that Hilda's eyes read the future, and her lips speak the dark words of truth.  Bow thy heart to the Vala, and mistrust the wisdom that sees only the things of the daylight.  As the valour of the warrior and the song of the scald, so is the lore of the prophetess.  It is not of the body, it is soul within soul; it marshals events and men, like the valour--it moulds the air into substance, like the song.  Bow thy heart to the Vala. Flowers bloom over the grave of the dead.  And the young plant soars high, when the king of the woodland lies low!\"     CHAPTER VI.   The sun rose, and the stairs and passages without were filled with the crowds that pressed to hear news of the Earl's health.  The doors stood open, and Gurth led in the multitude to look their last on the hero of council and camp, who had restored with strong hand and wise brain the race of Cerdic to the Saxon throne.  Harold stood by the bed-head silent, and tears were shed and sobs were heard.  And many a thegn who had before half believed in the guilt of Godwin as the murderer of Alfred, whispered in gasps to his neighbour:  \"There is no weregeld for manslaying on the head of him who smiles so in death on his old comrades in life!\"  Last of all lingered Leofric, the great Earl of Mercia; and when the rest had departed, he took the pale hand, that lay heavy on the coverlid, in his own, and said:  \"Old foe, often stood we in Witan and field against each other; but few are the friends for whom Leofric would mourn as he mourns for thee.  Peace to thy soul!  Whatever its sins, England should judge thee mildly, for England beat in each pulse of thy heart, and with thy greatness was her own!\"  Then Harold stole round the bed, and put his arms round Leofric's neck, and embraced him.  The good old Earl was touched, and he laid his tremulous hands on Harold's brown locks and blessed him.  \"Harold,\" he said, \"thou succeedest to thy father's power: let thy father's foes be thy friends.  Wake from thy grief, for thy country now demands thee,--the honour of thy House, and the memory of the dead.  Many even now plot against thee and thine.  Seek the King, demand as thy right thy father's earldom, and Leofric will back thy claim in the Witan.\"  Harold pressed Leofric's hand, and raising it to his lips replied: \"Be our Houses at peace henceforth and for ever.\"  Tostig's vanity indeed misled him, when he dreamed that any combination of Godwin's party could meditate supporting his claims against the popular Harold--nor less did the monks deceive themselves, when they supposed that, with Godwin's death, the power of his family would fall.  There was more than even the unanimity of the chiefs of the Witan, in favour of Harold; there was that universal noiseless impression throughout all England, Danish and Saxon, that Harold was now the sole man on whom rested the state--which, whenever it so favours one individual, is irresistible.  Nor was Edward himself hostile to Harold, whom alone of that House, as we have before said, he esteemed and loved.  Harold was at once named Earl of Wessex; and relinquishing the earldom he held before, he did not hesitate as to the successor to be recommended in his place.  Conquering all jealousy and dislike for Algar, he united the strength of his party in favour of the son of Leofric, and the election fell upon him.  With all his hot errors, the claims of no other Earl, whether from his own capacities or his father's services, were so strong; and his election probably saved the state from a great danger, in the results of that angry mood and that irritated ambition with which he had thrown himself into the arms of England's most valiant aggressor, Gryffyth, King of North Wales.  To outward appearance, by this election, the House of Leofric--uniting in father and son the two mighty districts of Mercia and the East Anglians--became more powerful than that of Godwin; for, in that last House, Harold was now the only possessor of one of the great earldoms, and Tostig and the other brothers had no other provision beyond the comparatively insignificant lordships they held before.  But if Harold had ruled no earldom at all, he had still been immeasurably the first man in England--so great was the confidence reposed in his valour and wisdom.  He was of that height in himself, that he needed no pedestal to stand on.  The successor of the first great founder of a House succeeds to more than his predecessor's power, if he but know how to wield and maintain it.  For who makes his way to greatness without raising foes at every step? and who ever rose to power supreme, without grave cause for blame?  But Harold stood free from the enmities his father had provoked, and pure from the stains that slander or repute cast upon his father's name.  The sun of the yesterday had shone through cloud; the sun of the day rose in a clear firmament.  Even Tostig recognised the superiority of his brother; and after a strong struggle between baffled rage and covetous ambition, yielded to him, as to a father. He felt that all Godwin's House was centred in Harold alone; and that only from his brother (despite his own daring valour and despite his alliance with the blood of Charlemagne and Alfred, through the sister of Matilda, the Norman duchess,) could his avarice of power be gratified.  \"Depart to thy home, my brother,\" said Earl Harold to Tostig, \"and grieve not that Algar is preferred to thee.  For, even had his claim been less urgent, ill would it have beseemed us to arrogate the lordships of all England as our dues.  Rule thy lordship with wisdom: gain the love of thy lithsmen.  High claims hast thou in our father's name, and moderation now will but strengthen thee in the season to come.  Trust on Harold somewhat, on thyself more.  Thou hast but to add temper and judgment to valour and zeal, to be worthy mate of the first earl in England.  Over my father's corpse I embraced my father's foe.  Between brother and brother shall there not be love, as the best bequest of the dead?\"  \"It shall not be my fault, if there be not,\" answered Tostig, humbled though chafed.  And he summoned his men and returned to his domains.     CHAPTER VII.   Fair, broad, and calm set the sun over the western woodlands.  Hilda stood on the mound, and looked with undazzled eyes on the sinking orb. Beside her, Edith reclined on the sward, and seemed with idle hand tracing characters in the air.  The girl had grown paler still, since Harold last parted from her on the same spot, and the same listless and despondent apathy stamped her smileless lips and her bended head.  \"See, child of my heart,\" said Hilda, addressing Edith, while she still gazed on the western luminary, \"see, the sun goes down to the far deeps, where Rana and Aegir [136] watch over the worlds of the sea; but with morning he comes from the halls of the Asas--the golden gates of the East--and joy comes in his train.  And yet then thinkest, sad child, whose years have scarce passed into woman, that the sun, once set, never comes back to life.  But even while we speak, thy morning draws near, and the dunness of cloud takes the hues of the rose!\"  Edith's hand paused from its vague employment, and fell droopingly on her knee;--she turned with an unquiet and anxious eye to Hilda, and after looking some moments wistfully at the Vala, the colour rose to her cheek, and she said in a voice that had an accent half of anger:  \"Hilda, thou art cruel!\"  \"So is Fate!\" answered the Vala.  \"But men call not Fate cruel when it smiles on their desires.  Why callest thou Hilda cruel, when she reads in the setting sun the runes of thy coming joy!\"  \"There is no joy for me,\" returned Edith, plaintively; and I have that on my heart,\" she added, with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone, \"which at last I will dare to speak.  I reproach thee, Hilda, that thou hast marred all my life, that thou hast duped me with dreams, and left me alone in despair.\"  \"Speak on,\" said Hilda, calmly, as a nurse to a froward child.  \"Hast thou not told me, from the first dawn of my wondering reason, that my life and lot were inwoven with--with (the word, mad and daring, must out)--with those of Harold the peerless?  But for that, which my infancy took from thy lips as a law, I had never been so vain and so frantic!  I had never watched each play of his face, and treasured each word from his lips; I had never made my life but part of his life--all my soul but the shadow of his sun.  But for that, I had hailed the calm of the cloister--but for that, I had glided in peace to my grave.  And now--now, O Hilda--\" Edith paused, and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command.  \"And,\" she resumed quickly, \"thou knowest that these hopes were but dreams--that the law ever stood between him and me--and that it was guilt to love him.\"  \"I knew the law,\" answered Hilda, \"but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird.  Ye are sibbe to each other, some five times removed; and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed.  When the shavelings obey the old man at home, and put aside their own wives and frillas [137], and abstain from the wine cup, and the chase, and the brawl, I will stoop to hear of their laws,--with disrelish it may be, but without scorn. [138]  It is no sin to love Harold; and no monk and no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7676"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 05 (#5)"],["body"," shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together, form and heart.\"  \"Hilda! Hilda! madden me not with joy,\" cried Edith, starting up in rapturous emotion, her young face dyed with blushes, and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed, as if by the vision of Freya, the northern Venus, charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard.  \"But that day is distant,\" renewed the Vala.  \"What matters! what matters!\" cried the pure child of Nature; \"I ask but hope.  Enough,--oh! enough, if we were but wedded on the borders of the grave!\"  \"Lo, then,\" said Hilda, \"behold, the sun of thy life dawns again!\"  As she spoke, the Vala stretched her arm, and through the intersticed columns of the fane, Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward.  Presently into the space of the circle came Harold, her beloved.  His face was pale with grief yet recent; but, perhaps, more than ever, dignity was in his step and command on his brow, for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England.  And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of a man as the grave sense of power responsible, in an earnest soul?  \"Thou comest,\" said Hilda, \"in the hour I predicted; at the setting of the sun and the rising of the star.\"  \"Vala,\" said Harold, gloomily, \"I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies; for who shall judge of that power of which he knows not the elements? or despise the marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture?  But leave me, I pray thee, to walk in the broad light of the common day.  These hands are made to grapple with things palpable, and these eyes to measure the forms that front my way.  In my youth, I turned in despair or disgust from the subtleties of the schoolmen, which split upon hairs the brains of Lombard and Frank; in my busy and stirring manhood entangle me not in the meshes which confuse all my reason, and sicken my waking thoughts into dreams of awe.  Mine be the straight path and the plain goal!\"  The Vala gazed on him with an earnest look, that partook of admiration, and yet more of gloom; but she spoke not, and Harold resumed:  \"Let the dead rest, Hilda,--proud names with glory on earth and shadows escaped from our ken, submissive to mercy in heaven.  A vast chasm have my steps overleapt since we met, O Hilda--sweet Edith; a vast chasm, but a narrow grave.\"  His voice faltered a moment, and again he renewed,--\" Thou weepest, Edith; ah, how thy tears console me!  Hilda, hear me!  I love thy grandchild--loved her by irresistible instinct since her blue eyes first smiled on mine.  I loved her in her childhood, as in her youth--in the blossom as in the flower.  And thy grandchild loves me.  The laws of the Church proscribe our marriage, and therefore we parted; but I feel, and thine Edith feels, that the love remains as strong in absence: no other will be her wedded lord, no other my wedded wife.  Therefore, with heart made soft by sorrow, and, in my father's death, sole lord of my fate, I return, and say to thee in her presence, 'Suffer us to hope still!'  The day may come when under some king less enthralled than Edward by formal Church laws, we may obtain from the Pope absolution for our nuptials--a day, perhaps, far off; but we are both young, and love is strong and patient: we can wait.\"  \"O Harold,\" exclaimed Edith, \"we can wait!\"  \"Have I not told thee, son of Godwin,\" said the Vala, solemnly, \"that Edith's skein of life was inwoven with thine?  Dost thou deem that my charms have not explored the destiny of the last of my race?  Know that it is in the decrees of the fates that ye are to be united, never more to be divided.  Know that there shall come a day, though I can see not its morrow, and it lies dim and afar, which shall be the most glorious of thy life, and on which Edith and fame shall be thine,--the day of thy nativity, on which hitherto all things have prospered with thee.  In vain against the stars preach the mone and the priest: what shall be, shall be.  Wherefore, take hope and joy, O Children of Time! And now, as I join your hands, I betroth your souls.\"  Rapture unalloyed and unprophetic, born of love deep and pure, shone in the eyes of Harold, as he clasped the hand of his promised bride. But an involuntary and mysterious shudder passed over Edith's frame, and she leant close, close, for support upon Harold's breast. And, as if by a vision, there rose distinct in her memory a stern brow, a form of power and terror--the brow and the form of him who but once again in her waking life the Prophetess had told her she should behold.  The vision passed away in the warm clasp of those protecting arms; and looking up into Harold's face, she there beheld the mighty and deep delight that transfused itself at once into her own soul.  Then Hilda, placing one hand over their heads, and raising the other towards heaven, all radiant with bursting stars, said in her deep and thrilling tones:  \"Attest the betrothal of these young hearts, O ye Powers that draw nature to nature by spells which no galdra can trace, and have wrought in the secrets of creation no mystery so perfect as love,--Attest it, thou temple, thou altar!--attest it, O sun and O air!  While the forms are divided, may the souls cling together--sorrow with sorrow, and joy with joy.  And when, at length, bride and bridegroom are one,--O stars, may the trouble with which ye are charged have exhausted its burthen; may no danger molest, and no malice disturb, but, over the marriage-bed, shine in peace, O ye stars!\"  Up rose the moon.  May's nightingale called its mate from the breathless boughs; and so Edith and Harold were betrothed by the grave of the son of Cerdic.  And from the line of Cerdic had come, since Ethelbert, all the Saxon kings who with sword and with sceptre had reigned over Saxon England."]]]
