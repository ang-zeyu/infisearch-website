On the 16th of March, 1865, a part of Sherman's Forces met the Enemy, under General Joe Johnston, at Averysboro, N.  C., and forced him to retire.  On the 19th and 20th of March, occurred the series of engagements, about Mill Creek and the Bentonville and Smithfield cross-roads, which culminated in the attack upon the Enemy, of the 21st of March, and his evacuation, that night, of his entire line of works, and retreat upon Smithfield.  This was known as the Battle of Bentonville, and was the last battle fought between the rival Forces under Sherman and Johnston.  The Armies of Sherman, now swollen by having formed a junction with the troops under Schofield and Terry, which had come from Newbern and Wilmington, went into camp at Goldsboro, North Carolina, to await the rebuilding of the railroads from those two points on the coast, and the arrival of badly needed clothing, provision, and other supplies, after which the march would be resumed to Burksville, Virginia.  By the 25th of March, the railroad from Newbern was in running order, and General Sherman, leaving General Schofield in command of his eighty thousand troops, went to Newbern and Morehead City, and thence by steamer to City Point, for a personal interview with General Grant.  On the same day, Lee made a desperate but useless assault, with twenty thousand (of his seventy thousand) men upon Fort Stedman--a portion of Grant's works in front of Petersburg.  On the 27th, President Lincoln reached City Point, on the James River, in the steamer \"Ocean Queen.\"  Sherman reached City Point the same day, and, after meeting the General-in-Chief, Grant took him on board the \"Ocean Queen\" to see the President.  Together they explained to Mr. Lincoln the Military situation, during the \"hour or more\" they were with him.  Of this interview with Mr. Lincoln, General Sherman afterwards wrote: \"General Grant and I explained to him that my next move from Goldsboro would bring my Army, increased to eighty thousand men by Schofield's and Terry's reinforcements, in close communication with General Grant's Army, then investing Lee in Richmond, and that unless Lee could effect his escape, and make junction with Johnston in North Carolina, he would soon be shut up in Richmond with no possibility of supplies, and would have to surrender.  Mr. Lincoln was extremely interested in this view of the case, and when we explained that Lee's only chance was to escape, join Johnston, and, being then between me in North Carolina, and Grant in Virginia, could choose which to fight.  Mr. Lincoln seemed unusually impressed with this; but General Grant explained that, at the very moment of our conversation, General Sheridan was passing his Cavalry across James River, from the North to the South; that he would, with this Cavalry, so extend his left below Petersburg as to meet the South Shore Road; and that if Lee should 'let go' his fortified lines, he (Grant) would follow him so close that he could not possibly fall on me alone in North Carolina.  I, in like manner, expressed the fullest confidence that my Army in North Carolina was willing to cope with Lee and Johnston combined, till Grant could come up.  But we both agreed that one more bloody battle was likely to occur before the close of the War.  Mr. Lincoln * * * more than once exclaimed: 'Must more blood be shed?  Cannot this last bloody battle be avoided?'  We explained that we had to presume that General Lee was a real general; that he must see that Johnston alone was no barrier to my progress; and that if my Army of eighty thousand veterans should reach Burksville, he was lost in Richmond; and that we were forced to believe he would not await that inevitable conclusion, but make one more desperate effort.\"  President Lincoln's intense anxiety caused him to remain at City Point, from this time forth, almost until the end--receiving from General Grant, when absent, at the immediate front, frequent dispatches, which, as fast as received and read, he transmitted to the Secretary of War, at Washington.  Grant had already given general instructions to Major-Generals Meade, Ord, and Sheridan, for the closing movements of his immediate Forces, against Lee and his lines of supply and possible retreat.  He saw that the time had come for which he had so long waited, and he now felt \"like ending the matter.\"  On the morning of the 29th of March--preliminary dispositions having been executed--the movements began.  That night, Grant wrote to Sheridan, who was at Dinwiddie Court House, with his ten thousand Cavalry: \"Our line is now unbroken from the Appomattox to Dinwiddie.  * * *  I feel now like ending the matter, if it is possible to do so, before going back.  * * *  In the morning, push around the Enemy, if you can, and get on his right rear.  * * * We will all act together as one Army, until it is seen what can be done with the Enemy.\"  The rain fell all that night in torrents.  The face of the country, where forests, swamps, and quicksands alternated in presenting apparently insuperable obstacles to immediate advance, was very discouraging next morning, but Sheridan's heart was gladdened by orders to seize Five Forks.  On the 31st, the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House occurred--the Enemy attacking Sheridan and Warren with a largely superior force.  During the night, Sheridan was reinforced with the Fifth Corps, and other troops. On April 1st, Sheridan fought, and won, the glorious Battle of Five Forks, against this detached Rebel force, and, besides capturing 6,000 prisoners and six pieces of artillery, dispersed the rest to the North and West, away from the balance of Lee's Army.  That night, after Grant received the news of this victory, he went into his tent, wrote a dispatch, sent it by an orderly, and returning to the fire outside his tent, calmly said: \"I have ordered an immediate assault along the lines.\"  This was afterward modified to an attack at three points, on the Petersburg works, at 4 o'clock in the morning--a terrific bombardment, however, to be kept up all night.  Grant also sent more reinforcements to Sheridan.  On the morning of April 2nd, the assault was made, and the Enemy's works were gallantly carried, while Sheridan was coming up to the West of Petersburg.  The Rebel Chieftain Lee, when his works were stormed and carried, is said to have exclaimed: \"It has happened as I thought; the lines have been stretched until they broke.\"  At 10.30 A. M. he telegraphed to Jefferson Davis: \"My lines are broken in three places.  Richmond must be evacuated this evening.\"  This dispatch of Parke, Ord on Wright's left, Humphreys on Ord's left and Warren on Humphrey's left-Sheridan being to the rear and left of Warren, reached Davis, while at church.  All present felt, as he retired, that the end of the Rebellion had come.  At 10.40 A. M. Lee reported further: \"I see no prospect of doing more than holding our position here till night.  I am not certain that I can do that.  If I can, I shall withdraw tonight, North of the Appomattox, and if possible, it will be better to withdraw the whole line to-night from James river.  * * *  Our only chance of concentrating our Forces is to do so near Danville railroad, which I shall endeavor to do at once. I advise that all preparations be made for leaving Richmond to-night. I will advise you later, according to circumstances.  \"At 7 o'clock P. M. Lee again communicated to the Rebel Secretary of War this information: \"It is absolutely necessary that we should abandon our position to-night, or run the risk of being cut off in the morning.  I have given all the orders to officers on both sides of the river, and have taken every precaution that I can to make the movement successful.  It will be a difficult operation, but I hope not impracticable.  Please give all orders that you find necessary, in and about Richmond.  The troops will all be directed to Amelia Court House.\"  This was the last dispatch sent by Lee to the Rebel Government.  On the 3rd of April, Petersburg and Richmond were evacuated, and again under the Union flag, while Grant's immediate Forces were pressing forward to cut off the retreat of Lee, upon Amelia Court House and Danville, in an effort to form a junction with Johnston.  On the 6th, the important Battle of Sailor's Creek, Va., was fought and won by Sheridan.  On the evening of the 7th, at the Farmville hotel, where Lee had slept the night before, Grant, after sending dispatches to Sheridan at Prospect Station, Ord at Prince Edward's Court House, and Mead at Rice Station, wrote the following letter to Lee:                           \"FARMVILLE, April 7th, 1865.  \"GENERAL: The results of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance, on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia, in this struggle.  I feel that it is so, and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood, by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States' army known as the Army of Northern Virginia.  \"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"   Lee, however, in replying to this demand, and in subsequent correspondence, seemed to be unable to see \"the hopelessness of further resistance.\"  He thought \"the emergency had not yet come.\"  Hence, Grant decided to so press and harass him, as to bring the emergency along quickly.  Accordingly, by the night of the 8th of April, Sheridan with his Cavalry had completely headed Lee off, at Appomattox Court House. By morning, Ord's forces had reached Sheridan, and were in line behind him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7139"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 7 (#7)"],["body"," Corps of the Army of the Potomac, under Meade, were also, by this time, close on the Enemy's rear.  And now the harassed Enemy, conscious that his rear was threatened, and seeing only Cavalry in his front, through which to fight his way, advanced to the attack.  The dismounted Cavalry of Sheridan contested the advance, in order to give Ord and Griffin as much time as possible to form, then, mounting and moving rapidly aside, they suddenly uncovered, to the charging Rebels, Ord's impenetrable barrier of Infantry, advancing upon them at a double-quick!  At the same time that this appalling sight staggered them, and rolled them back in despair, they became aware that Sheridan's impetuous Cavalry, now mounted, were hovering on their left flank, evidently about to charge!  Lee at once concluded that the emergency \"had now come,\" and sent, both to Sheridan and Meade, a flag of truce, asking that hostilities cease, pending negotiations for a surrender--having also requested of Grant an audience with a view to such surrender.  That afternoon the two great rival Military Chieftains met by appointment in the plain little farm-house of one McLean--Lee dressed in his best full-dress uniform and sword, Grant in a uniform soiled and dusty, and without any sword--and, after a few preliminary words, as to the terms proposed by Grant, the latter sat down to the table, and wrote the following:                           \"APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE,                          \"VIRGINIA, April 9, 1865.  \"GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the 8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate.  The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the United States, until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.  The arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.  This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage.  This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be disturbed by United States authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside.                                     \"U. S. GRANT,                               \"Lieutenant-General.  \"General R. E. LEE.\"  After some further conversation, in which Grant intimated that his officers receiving paroles would be instructed to \"allow the Cavalry and Artillery men to retain their horses, and take them home to work their little farms\"--a kindness which Lee said, would \"have the best possible effect,\" the latter wrote his surrender in the following words:                 \"HEAD-QUARTERS, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,                               April 9, 1865.  \"GENERAL: I received your letter of this date containing the terms of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, as proposed by you.  As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter of the 8th instant, they are accepted.  I will proceed to designate the proper officers to carry the stipulations into effect.                               \"R. E. LEE, General.  \"Lieutenant-General U. S. GRANT.\"   Before parting, Lee told Grant that his men were starving; and Grant at once ordered 25,000 rations to be issued to the surrendered Rebels--and then the Rebel Chieftain, shaking hands with the Victor, rode away to his conquered legions.  It was 4.30 P.M. when Grant, on his way to his own headquarters, now with Sheridan's command, dismounted from his horse, and sitting on a stone by the roadside, wrote the following dispatch:                                \"Hon. E. M. STANTON,                          Secretary of War, Washington.  \"General Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia this afternoon on terms proposed by myself.  The accompanying additional correspondence will show the conditions fully.                     \"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant General.\"   Meanwhile on the 5th of April, Grant, who had kept Sherman, as well as Sheridan, advised of his main movements, had also ordered the former to press Johnston's Army as he was pressing Lee, so as, between them, they might \"push on, and finish the job.\"  In accordance with this order, Sherman's Forces advanced toward Smithfield, and, Johnston having rapidly retreated before them, entered Raleigh, North Carolina, on the 13th.  The 14th of April, brought the news of the surrender of Lee to Grant, and the same day a correspondence was opened between Sherman and Johnston, looking to the surrender of the latter's Army--terms for which were actually agreed upon, subject, however, to approval of Sherman's superiors.  Those terms, however, being considered unsatisfactory, were promptly disapproved, and similar terms to those allowed to Lee's Army, were substituted, and agreed to, the actual surrender taking place April 26th, near Durham, North Carolina.  On the 21st, Macon, Georgia, with 12,000 Rebel Militia, and sixty guns, was surrendered to Wilson's Cavalry-command, by General Howell Cobb.  On the 4th of May, General Richard Taylor surrendered all the armed Rebel troops, East of the Mississippi river; and on the 26th of May, General Kirby Smith surrendered all of them, West of that river.  On that day, organized, armed Rebellion against the United States ceased, and became a thing of the past.  It had been conquered, stamped out, and extinguished, while its civic head, Jefferson Davis, captured May 11th, at Irwinsville, Georgia, while attempting to escape, was, with other leading Rebels, a prisoner in a Union fort.  Four years of armed Rebellion had been enough for them.  They were absolutely sick of it. And the magnanimity of the terms given them by Grant, completed their subjugation.  \"The wisdom of his course,\" says Badeau,  \"was proved by the haste which the Rebels made to yield everything they had fought for. They were ready not only to give up their arms, but literally to implore forgiveness of the Government.  They acquiesced in the abolition of Slavery.  They abandoned the heresy of Secession, and waited to learn what else their conquerors would dictate.  They dreamed not of political power.  They only asked to be let live quietly under the flag they had outraged, and attempt in some degree to rebuild their shattered fortunes.  The greatest General of the Rebellion asked for pardon.\"                                  CHAPTER XXXI.                               ASSASSINATION!  But while some of the great Military events alluded to in the preceding Chapter, had been transpiring at the theatre of War, something else had happened at the National Capital, so momentous, so atrocious, so execrable, that it was with difficulty the victorious soldiers of the Union, when they first heard the news, could be restrained from turning upon the then remaining armed Rebels, and annihilating them in their righteous fury.  Let us go back, for a moment, to President Lincoln, whom we left on board the Ocean Queen, at City Point, toward the end of March and the beginning of April, receiving dispatches from Grant, who was victoriously engaged at the front.  On the very day that Richmond fell --April 4th--President Lincoln, with his little son \"Tad,\" Admiral Porter, and others, visited the burning city, and held a reception in the parlors of the Mansion which had now, for so many years, been occupied by the Chief Conspirator, Jefferson Davis, and which had been precipitately abandoned when the flight of that Arch-Rebel and his \"Cabinet\" commenced.  On the 6th, the President, accompanied by his wife, Vice-President Johnson, and others from Washington, again visited Richmond, and received distinguished Virginians, to whom he addressed words of wisdom and patriotism.       [\"On this occasion,\" says Arnold, \"he was called upon by several      prominent citizens of Virginia, anxious to learn what the policy of      the Government towards them would be.  Without committing himself      to specific details, he satisfied them that his policy would be      magnanimous, forgiving, and generous.  He told these Virginians      they must learn loyalty and devotion to the Nation.  They need not      love Virginia less, but they must love the Republic more.\"]  On the 9th of April, he returned to Washington, and the same day--his last Sunday on Earth--came the grand and glorious news of Lee's surrender.  On the Wednesday evening following, he made a lengthy speech, at the White House, to the great crowd that had assembled about it, to congratulate him, and the Nation, upon the downfall of Rebellion.  His first thought in that speech, was of gratitude to God.  His second, to put himself in the background, and to give all the credit of Union Military success, to those who, under God, had achieved it.  Said he: \"We meet this evening, not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart.  The evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, and the surrender of the principal Insurgent Army, give hope of a righteous and speedy Peace, whose joyous expression cannot be restrained.  In the midst of this, however, He from whom all blessings flow, must not be forgotten.  A Call for a National Thanksgiving is being prepared, and will be duly promulgated.  Nor must those whose harder part gives us the cause of rejoicing, be overlooked.  Their honors must not be parcelled out with others.  I myself was near the front, and had the high pleasure of transmitting much of the good news to you; but no part of the honor, for plan or execution, is mine.  To General Grant, his skilful officers and brave men, all belongs.\"  This speech was almost entirely devoted to the"]]]
