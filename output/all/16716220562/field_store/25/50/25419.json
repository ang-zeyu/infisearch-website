Matilda is the descendant of Charlemagne and Alfred.  Thy realm is insecure as long as France undermines it with plots, and threatens it with arms.  Marry the daughter of Baldwin--and thy wife is the niece of Henry of France --thine enemy becomes thy kinsman, and must, perforce, be thine ally. This is not all; it were strange, looking round this disordered royalty of England--a childless king, who loves thee better than his own blood; a divided nobility, already adopting the fashions of the stranger, and accustomed to shift their faith from Saxon to Dane, and Dane to Saxon; a people that has respect indeed for brave chiefs, but, seeing new men rise daily from new houses, has no reverence for ancient lines and hereditary names; with a vast mass of villeins or slaves that have no interest in the land or its rulers; strange, seeing all this, if thy day-dreams have not also beheld a Norman sovereign on the throne of Saxon England.  And thy marriage with the descendant of the best and most beloved prince that ever ruled these realms, if it does not give thee a title to the land, may help to conciliate its affections, and to fix thy posterity in the halls of their mother's kin.  Have I said eno' to prove why, for the sake of nations, it were wise for the pontiff to stretch the harsh girths of the law? why I might be enabled to prove to the Court of Rome the policy of conciliating the love, and strengthening the hands, of the Norman Count, who may so become the main prop of Christendom?  Yea, have I said eno' to prove that the humble clerk can look on mundane matters with the eye of a man who can make small states great?\"  William remained speechless--his hot blood thrilled with a half superstitious awe; so thoroughly had this obscure Lombard divined, detailed all the intricate meshes of that policy with which he himself had interwoven his pertinacious affection for the Flemish princess, that it seemed to him as if he listened to the echo of his own heart, or heard from a soothsayer the voice of his most secret thoughts.  The priest continued  \"Wherefore, thus considering, I said to myself, Now has the time come, Lanfranc the Lombard, to prove to thee whether thy self-boastings have been a vain deceit, or whether, in this age of iron and amidst this lust of gold, thou, the penniless and the feeble, canst make knowledge and wit of more avail to the destinies of kings than armed men and filled treasuries.  I believe in that power.  I am ready for the test. Pause, judge from what the Lord of Breteuil hath said to thee, what will be the defection of thy lords if the Pope confirm the threatened excommunication of thine uncle?  Thine armies will rot from thee; thy treasures will be like dry leaves in thy coffers; the Duke of Bretagne will claim thy duchy as the legitimate heir of thy forefathers; the Duke of Burgundy will league with the King of France, and march on thy faithless legions under the banner of the Church.  The handwriting is on the walls, and thy sceptre and thy crown will pass away.\"  William set his teeth firmly, and breathed hard.  \"But send me to Rome, thy delegate, and the thunder of Mauger shall fall powerless.  Marry Matilda, bring her to thy halls, place her on thy throne, laugh to scorn the interdict of thy traitor uncle, and rest assured that the Pope shall send thee his dispensation to thy spousals, and his benison on thy marriage-bed.  And when this be done, Duke William, give me not abbacies and prelacies; multiply books, and stablish schools, and bid thy servant found the royalty of knowledge, as thou shalt found the sovereignty of war.\"  The Duke, transported from himself, leaped up and embraced the priest with his vast arms; he kissed his cheeks, he kissed his forehead, as, in those days, king kissed king with \"the kiss of peace.\"  \"Lanfranc of Pavia,\" he cried, \"whether thou succeed or fail, thou hast my love and gratitude evermore.  As thou speakest, would I have spoken, had I been born, framed, and reared as thou.  And, verily, when I hear thee, I blush for the boasts of my barbarous pride, that no man can wield my mace, or bend my bow.  Poor is the strength of body--a web of law can entangle it, and a word from a priest's mouth can palsy.  But thou!--let me look at thee.\"  William gazed on the pale face: from head to foot he scanned the delicate, slender form, and then, turning away, he said to Fitzosborne:  \"Thou, whose mailed hand hath fell'd a war-steed, art thou not ashamed of thyself?  The day is coming, I see it afar, when these slight men shall set their feet upon our corslets.\"  He paused as if in thought, again paced the room, and stopped before the crucifix, and image of the Virgin, which stood in a niche near the bed-head.  \"Right, noble prince,\" said the priest's low voice, \"pause there for a solution to all enigmas; there view the symbol of all-enduring power; there, learn its ends below--comprehend the account it must yield above.  To your thoughts and your prayers we leave you.\"  He took the stalwart arm of Taillefer, as he spoke, and, with a grave obeisance to Fitzosborne, left the chamber.     CHAPTER III.   The next morning William was long closeted alone with Lanfranc,--that man, among the most remarkable of his age, of whom it was said, that \"to comprehend the extent of his talents, one must be Herodian in grammar, Aristotle in dialectics, Cicero in rhetoric, Augustine and Jerome in Scriptural lore,\" [66]--and ere the noon the Duke's gallant and princely train were ordered to be in readiness for return home.  The crowd in the broad space, and the citizens from their boats in the river, gazed on the knights and steeds of that gorgeous company, already drawn up and awaiting without the open gates the sound of the trumpets that should announce the Duke's departure.  Before the hall- door in the inner court were his own men.  The snow-white steed of Odo; the alezan of Fitzosborne; and, to the marvel of all, a small palfrey plainly caparisoned.  What did that palfrey amid those steeds?--the steeds themselves seemed to chafe at the companionship; the Duke's charger pricked up his ears and snorted; the Lord of Breteuil's alezan kicked out, as the poor nag humbly drew near to make acquaintance; and the prelate's white barb, with red vicious eye, and ears laid down, ran fiercely at the low-bred intruder, with difficulty reined in by the squires, who shared the beast's amaze and resentment.  Meanwhile the Duke thoughtfully took his way to Edward's apartments. In the anteroom were many monks and many knights; but conspicuous amongst them all was a tall and stately veteran, leaning on a great two-handed sword, and whose dress and fashion of beard were those of the last generation, the men who had fought with Canute the Great or Edmund Ironsides.  So grand was the old man's aspect, and so did he contrast in appearance the narrow garb and shaven chins of those around, that the Duke was roused from his reverie at the sight, and marvelling why one, evidently a chief of high rank, had neither graced the banquet in his honour, nor been presented to his notice, he turned to the Earl of Hereford, who approached him with gay salutation, and inquired the name and title of the bearded man in the loose flowing robe.  \"Know you not, in truth?\" said the lively Earl, in some wonder.  \"In him you see the great rival of Godwin.  He is the hero of the Danes, as Godwin is of the Saxons, a true son of Odin, Siward, Earl of the Northumbrians.\" [67]  \"Norse Dame be my aid,--his fame hath oft filled my ears, and I should have lost the most welcome sight in merrie England had I not now beheld him.\"  Therewith, the Duke approached courteously, and, doffing the cap he had hitherto retained, he greeted the old hero with those compliments which the Norman had already learned in the courts of the Frank.  The stout Earl received them coldly, and replying in Danish to William's Romance-tongue, he said:  \"Pardon, Count of the Normans, if these old lips cling to their old words.  Both of us, methinks, date our lineage from the lands of the Norse.  Suffer Siward to speak the language the sea-kings spoke.  The old oak is not to be transplanted, and the old man keeps the ground where his youth took root.\"  The Duke, who with some difficulty comprehended the general meaning of Siward's speech, bit his lip, but replied courteously:  \"The youths of all nations may learn from renowned age.  Much doth it shame me that I cannot commune with thee in the ancestral tongue; but the angels at least know the language of the Norman Christian, and I pray them and the saints for a calm end to thy brave career.\"  \"Pray not to angel or saint for Siward son of Beorn,\" said the old man hastily; \"let me not have a cow's death, but a warrior's; die in my mail of proof, axe in hand, and helm on head.  And such may be my death, if Edward the King reads my rede and grants my prayer.\"  \"I have influence with the King,\" said William; \"name thy wish, that I may back it.\"  \"The fiend forfend,\" said the grim Earl, \"that a foreign prince should sway England's King, or that thegn and earl should ask other backing than leal service and just cause.  If Edward be the saint men call him, he will loose me on the hell-wolf, without other cry than his own conscience.\"  The Duke turned inquiringly to Rolf; who, thus appealed to, said:  \"Siward urges my uncle to espouse the cause of Malcolm of Cumbria against the bloody tyrant Macbeth; and but for the disputes with the traitor Godwin, the King had long since turned his arms to Scotland.\"  \"Call not traitors, young man,\" said the Earl, in high disdain, \"those who, with all their faults and crimes, have placed thy kinsman on the throne of Canute.\"  \"Hush, Rolf,\" said the Duke, observing the fierce young Norman about to reply hastily.  \"But methought, though my knowledge of English troubles is but scant, that Siward was the sworn foe to Godwin?\"  \"Foe to him "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7673"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 02 (#5)"],["body","his power, friend to him in his wrongs,\" answered Siward.  \"And if England needs defenders when I and Godwin are in our shrouds, there is but one man worthy of the days of old, and his name is Harold, the outlaw.\"  William's face changed remarkably, despite all his dissimulation; and, with a slight inclination of his head, he strode on moody and irritated.  \"This Harold! this Harold!\" he muttered to himself, \"all brave men speak to me of this Harold!  Even my Norman knights name him with reluctant reverence, and even his foes do him honour;--verily his shadow is cast from exile over all the land.\"  Thus murmuring, he passed the throng with less than his wonted affable grace, and pushing back the officers who wished to precede him, entered, without ceremony, Edward's private chamber.  The King was alone, but talking loudly to himself, gesticulating vehemently, and altogether so changed from his ordinary placid apathy of mien, that William drew back in alarm and awe.  Often had he heard indirectly, that of late years Edward was said to see visions, and be rapt from himself into the world of spirit and shadow; and such, he now doubted not, was the strange paroxysm of which he was made the witness.  Edward's eyes were fixed on him, but evidently without recognising his presence; the King's hands were outstretched, and he cried aloud in a voice of sharp anguish:  \"Sanguelac, Sanguelac!--the Lake of Blood!--the waves spread, the waves redden!  Mother of mercy--where is the ark?--where the Ararat?-- Fly--fly--this way--this--\" and he caught convulsive hold of William's arm.  \"No! there the corpses are piled--high and higher--there the horse of the Apocalypse tramples the dead in their gore.\"  In great horror, William took the King, now gasping on his breast, in his arms, and laid him on his bed, beneath its canopy of state, all blazoned with the martlets and cross of his insignia.  Slowly Edward came to himself, with heavy sighs; and when at length he sate up and looked round, it was with evident unconsciousness of what had passed across his haggard and wandering spirit, for he said, with his usual drowsy calmness:  \"Thanks, Guillaume, bien aime, for rousing me from unseasoned sleep. How fares it with thee?\"  \"Nay, how with thee, dear friend and king? thy dreams have been troubled.\"  \"Not so; I slept so heavily, methinks I could not have dreamed at all. But thou art clad as for a journey--spur on thy heel, staff in thy hand!\"  \"Long since, O dear host, I sent Odo to tell thee of the ill news from Normandy that compelled me to depart.\"  \"I remember--I remember me now,\" said Edward, passing his pale womanly fingers over his forehead.  \"The heathen rage against thee.  Ah! my poor brother, a crown is an awful head-gear.  While yet time, why not both seek some quiet convent, and put away these earthly cares?\"  William smiled and shook his head.  \"Nay, holy Edward, from all I have seen of convents, it is a dream to think that the monk's serge hides a calmer breast than the warrior's mail, or the king's ermine.  Now give me thy benison, for I go.\"  He knelt as he spoke, and Edward bent his hands over his head, and blessed him.  Then, taking from his own neck a collar of zimmes (jewels and uncut gems), of great price, the King threw it over the broad throat bent before him, and rising, clapped his hands.  A small door opened, giving a glimpse of the oratory within, and a monk appeared.  \"Father, have my behests been fulfilled?--hath Hugoline, my treasurer, dispensed the gifts that I spoke of?\"  \"Verily yes; vault, coffer, and garde-robe--stall and meuse.-are well nigh drained,\" answered the monk, with a sour look at the Norman, whose native avarice gleamed in his dark eyes as he heard the answer.  \"Thy train go not hence empty-handed,\" said Edward fondly.  \"Thy father's halls sheltered the exile, and the exile forgets not the sole pleasure of a king--the power to requite.  We may never meet again, William,--age creeps over me, and who will succeed to my thorny throne?\"  William longed to answer,--to tell the hope that consumed him,--to remind his cousin of the vague promise in their youth, that the Norman Count should succeed to that \"thorny throne:\" but the presence of the Saxon monk repelled him, nor was there in Edward's uneasy look much to allure him on.  \"But peace,\" continued the King, \"be between thine and mine, as between thee and me!\"  \"Amen,\" said the Duke, \"and I leave thee at least free from the proud rebels who so long disturbed thy reign.  This House of Godwin, thou wilt not again let it tower above thy palace?\"  \"Nay, the future is with God and his saints;\" answered Edward, feebly. \"But Godwin is old--older than I, and bowed by many storms.\"  \"Ay, his sons are more to be dreaded and kept aloof--mostly Harold!\"  \"Harold,--he was ever obedient, he alone of his kith; truly my soul mourns for Harold,\" said the King, sighing.  \"The serpent's egg hatches but the serpent.  Keep thy heel on it,\" said William, sternly.  \"Thou speakest well,\" said the irresolute prince, who never seemed three days or three minutes together in the same mind.  \"Harold is in Ireland--there let him rest: better for all.\"  \"For all,\" said the Duke; \"so the saints keep thee, O royal saint!\"  He kissed the King's hand, and strode away to the hall where Odo, Fitzosborne, and the priest Lanfranc awaited him.  And so that day, halfway towards the fair town of Dover, rode Duke William, and by the side of his roan barb ambled the priest's palfrey.  Behind came his gallant train, and with tumbrils and sumpter-mules laden with baggage, and enriched by Edward's gifts; while Welch hawks, and steeds of great price from the pastures of Surrey and the plains of Cambridge and York, attested no less acceptably than zimme, and golden chain, and embroidered robe, the munificence of the grateful King. [68]  As they journeyed on, and the fame of the Duke's coming was sent abroad by the bodes or messengers, despatched to prepare the towns through which he was to pass for an arrival sooner than expected, the more highborn youths of England, especially those of the party counter to that of the banished Godwin, came round the ways to gaze upon that famous chief, who, from the age of fifteen, had wielded the most redoubtable sword of Christendom.  And those youths wore the Norman garb: and in the towns, Norman counts held his stirrup to dismount, and Norman hosts spread the fastidious board; and when, at the eve of the next day, William saw the pennon of one of his own favourite chiefs waving in the van of armed men, that sallied forth from the towers of Dover (the key of the coast) he turned to the Lombard, still by his side, and said:  \"Is not England part of Normandy already?\"  And the Lombard answered:  \"The fruit is well nigh ripe, and the first breeze will shake it to thy feet.  Put not out thy hand too soon.  Let the wind do its work.\"  And the Duke made reply:  \"As thou thinkest, so think I.  And there is but one wind in the halls of heaven that can waft the fruit to the feet of another.\"  \"And that?\" asked the Lombard.  \"Is the wind that blows from the shores of Ireland, when it fills the sails of Harold, son of Godwin.\"  \"Thou fearest that man, and why?\" asked the Lombard with interest.  And the Duke answered:  \"Because in the breast of Harold beats the heart of England.\""]]]
