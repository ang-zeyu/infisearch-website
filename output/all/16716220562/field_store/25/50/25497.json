The Lord of Harrington and Bonville is so noted a dolt, that even the Neviles cannot help him to rise,--the meanest office is above his mind's level; and, dragged down by the heavy clay to which her wings are yoked, Katherine, Lady of Harrington and Bonville--oh, give her her due titles!--is but a pageant figure in the court.  If the war-trump blew, his very vassals would laugh at a Bonville's banner, and beneath the flag of poor William Hastings would gladly march the best chivalry of the land. And this it is, I say, that galls her.  For evermore she is driven to compare the state she holds as the dame of the accepted Bonville with that she lost as the wife of the disdained Hastings.\"  And if, in the heat and passion that such words betrayed, Sibyll sighed to think that something of the old remembrance yet swelled and burned, they but impressed her more with the value of a heart in which the characters once writ endured so long, and roused her to a tender ambition to heal and to console.  Then looking into her own deep soul, Sibyll beheld there a fund of such generous, pure, and noble affection, such reverence as to the fame, such love as to the man, that she proudly felt herself worthier of Hastings than the haughty Katherine.  She entered then, as it were, the lists with this rival,--a memory rather, so she thought, than a corporeal being; and her eye grew brighter, her step statelier, in the excitement of the contest, the anticipation of the triumph.  For what diamond without its flaw?  What rose without its canker?  And bedded deep in that exquisite and charming nature lay the dangerous and fatal weakness which has cursed so many victims, broken so many hearts,--the vanity of the sex.  We may now readily conceive how little predisposed was Sibyll to the blunt advances and displeasing warnings of the Lady Bonville, and the more so from the time in which they chanced.  For here comes the answer to the question, \"Why was Sibyll sad?\"  The reader may determine for himself what were the ruling motives of Lord Hastings in the court he paid to Sibyll.  Whether to pique the Lady Bonville, and force upon her the jealous pain he restlessly sought to inflict; whether, from the habit of his careless life, seeking the pleasure of the moment, with little forethought of the future, and reconciling itself to much cruelty, by that profound contempt for human beings, man, and still more for woman, which sad experience often brings to acute intellect; or whether, from the purer and holier complacency with which one whose youth has fed upon nobler aspirations than manhood cares to pursue, suns itself back to something of its earlier lustre in the presence and the converse of a young bright soul,--whatever, in brief, the earlier motives of gallantries to Sibyll, once begun, constantly renewed, by degrees wilder and warmer and guiltier emotions roused up in the universal and all-conquering lover the vice of his softer nature.  When calm and unimpassioned, his conscience had said to him, \"Thou shalt spare that flower.\"  But when once the passion was roused within him, the purity of the flower was forgotten in the breath of its voluptuous sweetness.  And but three days before the scene we have described with Katherine, Sibyll's fabric of hope fell to the dust. For Hastings spoke for the first time of love, for the first time knelt at her feet, for the first time, clasping to his heart that virgin hand, poured forth the protestation and the vow.  And oh! woe--woe! for the first time she learned how cheaply the great man held the poor maiden's love, how little he deemed that purity and genius and affection equalled the possessor of fame and wealth and power; for plainly visible, boldly shown and spoken, the love that she had foreseen as a glory from the heaven sought but to humble her to the dust.  The anguish of that moment was unspeakable,--and she spoke it not. But as she broke from the profaning clasp, as escaping to the threshold she cast on the unworthy wooer one look of such reproachful sorrow as told at once all her love and all her horror, the first act in the eternal tragedy of man's wrong and woman's grief was closed. And therefore was Sibyll sad!     CHAPTER V.  KATHERINE.  For several days Hastings avoided Sibyll; in truth, he felt remorse for his design, and in his various, active, and brilliant life he had not the leisure for obstinate and systematic siege to a single virtue, nor was he, perhaps, any longer capable of deep and enduring passion; his heart, like that of many a chevalier in the earlier day, had lavished itself upon one object, and sullenly, upon regrets and dreams, and vain anger and idle scorn, it had exhausted those sentiments which make the sum of true love.  And so, like Petrarch, whom his taste and fancy worshipped, and many another votary of the gentil Dieu, while his imagination devoted itself to the chaste and distant ideal--the spiritual Laura--his senses, ever vagrant and disengaged, settled without scruple upon the thousand Cynthias of the minute.  But then those Cynthias were, for the most part, and especially of late years, easy and light-won nymphs; their coyest were of another clay from the tender but lofty Sibyll.  And Hastings shrunk from the cold-blooded and deliberate seduction of one so pure, while he could not reconcile his mind to contemplate marriage with a girl who could give nothing to his ambition; and yet it was not in this last reluctance only his ambition that startled and recoiled.  In that strange tyranny over his whole soul which Katherine Bonville secretly exercised, he did not dare to place a new barrier evermore between her and himself.  The Lord Bonville was of infirm health; he had been more than once near to death's door; and Hastings, in every succeeding fancy that beguiled his path, recalled the thrill of his heart when it had whispered \"Katherine, the loved of thy youth, may yet be thine!\" And then that Katherine rose before him, not as she now swept the earth, with haughty step and frigid eye and disdainful lip, but as--in all her bloom of maiden beauty, before the temper was soured or the pride aroused--she had met him in the summer twilight, by the trysting-tree, broken with him the golden ring of faith, and wept upon his bosom.  And yet, during his brief and self-inflicted absence from Sibyll, this wayward and singular personage, who was never weak but to women, and ever weak to them, felt that she had made herself far dearer to him than he had at first supposed it possible.  He missed that face, ever, till the last interview, so confiding in the unconsciously betrayed affection.  He felt how superior in sweetness and yet in intellect Sibyll was to Katherine; there was more in common between her mind and his in all things, save one.  But oh, that one exception!--what a world lies within it,--the memory of the spring of life!  In fact, though Hastings knew it not, he was in love with two objects at once; the one, a chimera, a fancy, an ideal, an Eidolon, under the name of Katherine; the other, youth and freshness and mind and heart and a living shape of beauty, under the name of Sibyll.  Often does this double love happen to men; but when it does, alas for the human object! for the shadowy and the spiritual one is immortal,--until, indeed, it be possessed!  It might be, perhaps, with a resolute desire to conquer the new love and confirm the old that Hastings, one morning, repaired to the house of the Lady Bonville, for her visit to the court had expired.  It was a large mansion, without the Lud Gate.  He found the dame in a comely chamber, seated in the sole chair the room contained, to which was attached a foot-board that served as a dais, while around her, on low stools, sat some spinning, others broidering--some ten or twelve young maidens of good family, sent to receive their nurturing under the high-born Katherine, [And strange as it may seem to modern notions, the highest lady who received such pensioners accepted a befitting salary for their board and education.] while two other and somewhat elder virgins sat a little apart, but close under the eye of the lady, practising the courtly game of \"prime:\" for the diversion of cards was in its zenith of fashion under Edward IV., and even half a century later was considered one of the essential accomplishments of a well-educated young lady.  [So the Princess Margaret, daughter of Henry VIL, at the age of fourteen, exhibits her skill, in prime or trump, to her betrothed husband, James IV. of Scotland; so, among the womanly arts of the unhappy Katherine of Arragon, it is mentioned that she could play at \"cards and dyce.\" (See Strutt: Games and Pastimes, Hones' edition, p. 327.)  The legislature was very anxious to keep these games sacred to the aristocracy, and very wroth with 'prentices and the vulgar for imitating the ruinous amusements of their betters.]  The exceeding stiffness, the solemn silence of this female circle, but little accorded with the mood of the graceful visitor.  The demoiselles stirred not at his entrance, and Katherine quietly motioned him to a seat at some distance.  \"By your leave, fair lady,\" said Hastings, \"I rebel against so distant an exile from such sweet company;\" and he moved the tabouret close to the formidable chair of the presiding chieftainess.  Katherine smiled faintly, but not in displeasure.  \"So gay a presence,\" she said, \"must, I fear me, a little disturb these learners.\"  Hastings glanced at the prim demureness written on each blooming visage, and replied,--  \"You wrong their ardour in such noble studies.  I would wager that nothing less than my entering your bower on horseback, with helm on head and lance in rest, could provoke even a smile from one pair of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7720"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 06 (#6)"],["body"," rosy lips round which, methinks, I behold Cupido hovering in vain!\"  The baroness bent her stately brows, and the twenty rosy lips were all tightly pursed up, to prevent the indecorous exhibition which the wicked courtier had provoked.  But it would not do: one and all the twenty lips broke into a smile,--but a smile so tortured, constrained, and nipped in the bud, that it only gave an expression of pain to the features it was forbidden to enliven.  \"And what brings the Lord Hastings hither?\" asked the baroness, in a formal tone.  \"Can you never allow for motive the desire of pleasure, fair dame?\"  That peculiar and exquisite blush, which at moments changed the whole physiognomy of Katherine, flitted across her smooth cheek, and vanished.  She said gravely,--  \"So much do I allow it in you, my lord, that hence my question.\"  \"Katherine!\" exclaimed Hastings, in a voice of tender reproach, and attempting to seize her hand, forgetful of all other presence save that to which the blush, that spoke of old, gave back the ancient charm.  Katherine cast a hurried and startled glance over the maiden group, and her eye detected on the automaton faces one common expression of surprise.  Humbled and deeply displeased, she rose from the awful chair, and then, as suddenly reseating herself, she said, with a voice and lip of the most cutting irony, \"My lord chamberlain is, it seems, so habituated to lackey his king amidst the goldsmiths and grocers, that he forgets the form of language and respect of bearing which a noblewoman of repute is accustomed to consider seemly.\"  Hastings bit his lip, and his falcon eye shot indignant fire.  \"Pardon, my Lady of Bonville and Harrington, I did indeed forget what reasons the dame of so wise and so renowned a lord hath to feel pride in the titles she hath won.  But I see that my visit hath chanced out of season.  My business, in truth, was rather with my lord, whose counsel in peace is as famous as his truncheon in war!\"  \"It is enough,\" replied Katherine, with a dignity that rebuked the taunt, \"that Lord Bonville has the name of an honest man,--who never rose at court.\"  \"Woman, without one soft woman-feeling!\" muttered Hastings, between his ground teeth, as he approached the lady and made his profound obeisance.  The words were intended only for Katherine's ear, and they reached it.  Her bosom swelled beneath the brocaded gorget, and when the door closed on Hastings, she pressed her hands convulsively together, and her dark eyes were raised upward.  \"My child, thou art entangling thy skein,\" said the lady of Bonville, as she passed one of the maidens, towards the casement, which she opened,--\"the air to-day weighs heavily!\"     CHAPTER VI.  JOY FOR ADAM, AND HOPE FOR SIBYLL--AND POPULAR FRIAR BUNGEY!  Leaping on his palfrey, Hastings rode back to the Tower, dismounted at the gate, passed on to the little postern in the inner court, and paused not till he was in Warner's room.  \"How now, friend Adam?  Thou art idle.\"  \"Lord Hastings, I am ill.\"  \"And thy child not with thee?\"  \"She is gone to her grace the duchess, to pray her to grant me leave to go home, and waste no more life on making gold.\"  \"Home!  Go hence!  We cannot hear it!  The duchess must not grant it. I will not suffer the king to lose so learned a philosopher.\"  \"Then pray the king to let the philosopher achieve that which is in the power of labour.\"  He pointed to the Eureka.  \"Let me be heard in the king's council, and prove to sufficing judges what this iron can do for England.\"  \"Is that all?  So be it.  I will speak to his highness forthwith.  But promise that thou wilt think no more of leaving the king's palace.\"  \"Oh, no, no!  If I may enter again into mine own palace, mine own royalty of craft and hope, the court or the dungeon all one to me!\"  \"Father,\" said Sibyll, entering, \"be comforted.  The duchess forbids thy departure, but we will yet flee--\"  She stopped short as she saw Hastings.  He approached her timidly, and with so repentant, so earnest a respect in his mien and gesture, that she had not the heart to draw back the fair hand he lifted to his lips.  \"No, flee not, sweet donzell; leave not the desert court, without the flower and the laurel, the beauty and the wisdom, that scent the hour, and foretype eternity.  I have conferred with thy father,--I will obtain his prayer from the king.  His mind shall be free to follow its own impulse, and thou\"--he whispered--\"pardon--pardon an offence of too much love.  Never shall it wound again.\"  Her eyes, swimming with delicious tears, were fixed upon the floor. Poor child! with so much love, how could she cherish anger?  With so much purity, how distrust herself?  And while, at least, he spoke, the dangerous lover was sincere.  So from that hour peace was renewed between Sibyll and Lord Hastings.--Fatal peace! alas for the girl who loves--and has no mother!  True to his word, the courtier braved the displeasure of the Duchess of Bedford, in inducing the king to consider the expediency of permitting Adam to relinquish alchemy, and repair his model.  Edward summoned a deputation from the London merchants and traders, before whom Adam appeared and explained his device.  But these practical men at first ridiculed the notion as a madman's fancy, and it required all the art of Hastings to overcome their contempt, and appeal to the native acuteness of the king.  Edward, however, was only caught by Adam's incidental allusions to the application of his principle to ships.  The merchant-king suddenly roused himself to attention, when it was promised to him that his galleys should cross the seas without sail, and against wind and tide.  \"By Saint George!\" said he, then, \"let the honest man have his whim. Mend thy model, and every saint in the calendar speed thee!  Master Heyford, tell thy comely wife that I and Hastings will sup with her to-morrow, for her hippocras is a rare dainty.  Good day to you, worshipful my masters.  Hastings, come hither; enough of these trifles,--I must confer with thee on matters really pressing,--this damnable marriage of gentle George's!\"  And now Adam Warner was restored to his native element of thought; now the crucible was at rest, and the Eureka began to rise from its ruins. He knew not the hate that he had acquired in the permission he had gained; for the London deputies, on their return home, talked of nothing else for a whole week but the favour the king had shown to a strange man, half-maniac, half-conjuror, who had undertaken to devise a something which would throw all the artisans and journeymen out of work!  From merchant to mechanic travelled the news, and many an honest man cursed the great scholar, as he looked at his young children, and wished to have one good blow at the head that was hatching such devilish malice against the poor!  The name of Adam Warner became a byword of scorn and horror.  Nothing less than the deep ditch and strong walls of the Tower could have saved him from the popular indignation; and these prejudices were skilfully fed by the jealous enmity of his fellow-student, the terrible Friar Bungey.  This man, though in all matters of true learning and science worthy the utmost contempt Adam could heap upon him, was by no means of despicable abilities in the arts of imposing upon men.  In his youth he had been an itinerant mountebank, or, as it was called, tregetour. He knew well all the curious tricks of juggling that then amazed the vulgar, and, we fear, are lost to the craft of our modern necromancers.  He could clothe a wall with seeming vines, that vanished as you approached; he could conjure up in his quiet cell the likeness of a castle manned with soldiers, or a forest tenanted by deer.  [See Chaucer, House of Time, Book III.; also the account given by Baptista Porta, of his own Magical Delusions, of which an extract may be seen in the \"Curiosities of Literature\" Art., Dreams at the Dawn of Philosophy.]  Besides these illusions, probably produced by more powerful magic lanterns than are now used, the friar had stumbled upon the wondrous effects of animal magnetism, which was then unconsciously practised by the alchemists and cultivators of white or sacred magic.  He was an adept in the craft of fortune-telling; and his intimate acquaintance with all noted characters in the metropolis, their previous history and present circumstances, enabled his natural shrewdness to hit the mark, at least now and then, in his oracular predictions.  He had taken, for safety and for bread, the friar's robes, and had long enjoyed the confidence of the Duchess of Bedford, the traditional descendant of the serpent-witch, Melusina.  Moreover, and in this the friar especially valued himself, Bungey had, in the course of his hardy, vagrant early life, studied, as shepherds and mariners do now, the signs of the weather; and as weather-glasses were then unknown, nothing could be more convenient to the royal planners of a summer chase or a hawking company than the neighbourhood of a skilful predictor of storm and sunshine.  In fact, there was no part in the lore of magic which the popular seers found so useful and studied so much as that which enabled them to prognosticate the humours of the sky, at a period when the lives of all men were principally spent in the open air.  The fame of Friar Bungey had travelled much farther than the repute of Adam Warner: it was known in the distant provinces: and many a northern peasant grew pale as he related to his gaping listeners the tales he had heard of the Duchess Jacquetta's dread magician.  And yet, though the friar was an atrocious knave and a ludicrous impostor, on the whole he was by no means unpopular, especially in the metropolis, for he was naturally a jolly, social fellow; he often ventured boldly forth into the different hostelries and reunions of the populace, and enjoyed the admiration he there excited, and pocketed the groats he there collected.  He had no pride,--none in"]]]
