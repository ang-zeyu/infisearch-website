The ambassador brought him out for a spin in his automobile and left him out in front a moment. When he went back to continue his morning ride the automobile and the boy were nowhere to be seen! This was before nine o'clock Monday morning. Yesterday, along about noon, the boy--or a lad very much resembling him--was seen by a lieutenant of infantry in a motor boat, speeding up the Potomac.\"  \"Why didn't he catch him, then?\" asked Jack.  \"Because he did not know at that time that the prince had been kidnapped. The authorities kept everything quiet! I presume they thought the thief didn't know that he had committed a crime, and were afraid the newspapers would tell him about it!\"  \"Tell that to Frank!\" laughed Jack. \"He'll go up in the air!\"  The boys found Jimmie and Oliver in the club-room when they went down. The garage and carriage house had been searched--in vain, of course, for the boys had encountered the Chinaman on his way down to the basement as they ascended the stairs, the elevator being closed for the night.  \"I believe that Chink had something to do with it, all the same,\" declared Jimmie. \"He ought to be watched every minute of the time!\"  \"Now, here's another point I don't understand,\" Jack said, going back to the conversation he had had with Ned in the attic. \"Why do the authorities think the boy has been taken to the mountains?\"  \"Because that would be a natural place for the thieves to hide,\" Ned answered. \"The mountains are easily within reach of Washington, and they are virtually inaccessible to known officers of the law--at least so it is reported. The mountains run from central Pennsylvania to central Alabama, a distance of about a thousand miles, and afford many desirable hiding places.\"  \"Yes, and we're likely to get our crusts split down there!\" Teddy grinned. \"We will if they find out that we belong to the Secret Service!\"  \"The Potomac river rises in West Virginia,\" continued Ned, \"and the prince may have been taken to the foothills in the launch he was seen in.\"  \"Are we going in a motor boat?\" asked Jimmie.  \"We are going by rail as far as we can go,\" Ned answered, \"and then take shank's horses for the wild country, with mules to tote the baggage. In the eastern part of West Virginia, we are likely to travel forty miles without seeing a cabin.\"  \"Where do we get our eatings?\" demanded Jimmie. \"It makes me hungry to climb mountains. We'll have to have a relief expedition sent after us if we don't get plenty of eatings,\" he added, with a wink at Teddy.  \"Plenty of game up there,\" Ned grinned. \"Plenty of deer, turkeys, coon, rabbits, birds and bears! We can dodge the game laws! Also a few wildcats are reported to have been seen there. And there is said to be plenty of moonshine in the caves, too. Oh, we'll have a sweet old vacation, boys. And we start tomorrow!\"     CHAPTER IV  A CAMP IN THE MOUNTAINS   It was early June, and the members of the Boy Scout Camera Club were camped on a mountain top in West Virginia. They had spent about two weeks in making the trip to the point where they had established camp.  Three mules, divested of their burdens now, were \"staked out\" in a little corral fragrant with grass down near the timber line. The tent they had carried was a short distance below the summit, on the eastern slope, with packages and bags and boxes of provisions piled around it.  To the south lay Virginia, to the north, east and west stretched the mountainous district of West Virginia. Far below them ran the North Fork of the Potomac river.  What they saw was a wild and lonely country, with more deer, wild turkeys, and raccoons than human beings. On their hard and frequently delayed journey in they had passed cabins, surrounded here and there by rail fences, but there were none in sight from where they now stood.  The sun, a round ball of fire in the west, would be out of sight in half an hour, and then the desolate darkness of the mountains would surround them. A wild turkey called to its mate in the distance, and small creatures of the air fluttered about, as if determined to know what human beings were doing there, in their ordinarily safe retreat.  The boys had visited Washington the day following the incidents at the clubroom of the Black Bear Patrol, but had learned nothing of importance there. The launch in which the young prince had been seen had been traced up the river to the vicinity of Cumberland, but there the trail had ended.  \"It is a case of needle-in-the-haystack,\" the Secret Service chief had said to Ned, on the morning of his departure for the mountains. \"We have men looking over every inch of the large cities. We want you to rake those mountains with a fine-tooth comb! Personally, I believe that the prince is there.\"  \"But,\" Ned had replied, \"how are we to communicate with you in case we require more definite instructions?\"  \"You know what Sherman did when he left Atlanta?\" laughed the chief.  \"Why, he cut the wires,\" returned Ned, \"so as not to have his movements hampered by orders from men who, not being on the ground, could not possibly know as much as he did of what ought to be done.\"  \"That is what I want you to do!\" the chief continued. \"Cut the wires.\"  \"But that is assuming a great responsibility,\" urged the boy.  \"Very true, but I have an idea that you want to work in your own way, so go to it. A mess of lively boys running up and down the mountain sides looking for game and snap-shots ought not to arouse the suspicion of the thieves if they are there. Make friends with the mountain people if you can. They are naturally suspicious, but good as gold at heart.\"  That was his last talk with the chief. After that supplies had been bought and transported by rail to the nearest point, and there the mules had been bought and the difficult journey begun. They had just made their first permanent camp.  \"I wouldn't mind living here a few years!\" Teddy said. \"It beats the hot old city! If I had plenty of reading matter and a full larder, I don't think I would ever go back. I wish Dad could step out of that Harvard thing and eat supper with us!\"  The shrill scream of a mule now came up from the feeding ground below, and a commotion at the tent showed that one of the animals was kicking up a row there.  \"That's that long-eared Uncle Ike,\" Jimmie McGraw exclaimed. \"I feel in my bones that I'm going to love that mule! He's so worthless! If he had two legs less he'd beat Jesse James to the tall timber in piracy! He won't work if you don't watch him, and he'll steal everything he gets his eyes on! Yes, sir, I feel that there's a common sympathy between that mule and me, yet I know that we'll have a falling out some day! He's so open and above-board in his mischief.\"  \"Can you see what he's doing now?\" asked Teddy.  \"Why, I saw him knocking at the door of the tent, and I presume that by this time he is sitting in my chair picking his teeth, after devouring the bread! That sure is some highwayman, that mule, yet I feel that I'm going to love and admonish him!\"  The boys dashed down the slope to the tent and found Uncle Ike, as Jimmie insisted on calling a tall, ungainly, raw-boned mule, chewing at a slice of ham which he had pilfered from a box by the side of the fire.  \"There's one thing about Uncle Ike,\" Jimmie grinned, as Ned drove the animal away with a club. \"He always looks like he had been sent for to lead an experience meeting! He'll put on a face as long as a cable to a freight train, and then he'll turn to me and wink one eye, as if explaining that it was all for a joke.\"  \"That's your ham he's chewing, Jimmie!\" Ned declared.  \"I suppose so,\" the boy replied. \"That's what you get by being brother to a long-eared mule that for cussedness has Becker's gunmen backed up a creek with the oars lost!\"  While the mule was being restored to his companions, Jimmie and Teddy began getting supper. They had plenty of tinned goods, plenty of flour, potatoes, meal and ham and bacon. Still, they thought they ought to have something in the way of game.  \"I saw a wild turkey back there,\" Teddy volunteered.  \"And I saw a coon,\" Jimmie added.  \"Is there any law on turkeys and coons?\" asked Jack, who was trying to make the fire burn bright with lengths of green wood.  \"There ain't no law of any kind up here,\" Frank insisted.  \"Then we'll go and get a coon,\" Jimmie declared. \"You boys get a red-hot fire and I'll have the bird here before Ned gets that mule tied up!\"  \"Guess I'll go along,\" Teddy suggested. \"I never did like to have anyone else go to the trouble of getting my wild meat for me! I'll go along, and Frank and Ned and Oliver can get supper.\"  Without waiting for any affirmative replies from their companions, the two lads darted away, and were soon lost in a canyon which ran at right angles with the ridge much farther down. Frank and Oliver began piling dry wood on the fire.  \"Those boys will be back here in time for breakfast--just about!\" Frank commented, as the coffee water boiled and the bacon began sizzling in the pan. \"If they get any supper here they'll have to cook it!\"  Presently Ned came back from the little valley where the mules were feeding and took a field glass from the tent.  \"What's up now?\" Teddy asked, as Ned walked back to the ridge and looked down into the valley of the North Fork. \"Ned must be seeing, things!\"  Ned remained oh the summit a long time, until the sun sank behind the range to the west and the valleys became ribbons of black between the lighter crests of the mountains.  Presently Frank scrambled up the yards of rugged, rock-strewn slope which led to the summit where Ned was standing, still with his field glass in his hand.  \"Anything in sight over that way?\" the boy asked, as he came to Ned's side.  \"There is a column of smoke in the valley,\" Ned answered. \"I thought at first that there were two, but I may have been mistaken. Do you remember what two columns of smoke would have indicated?\"  \"Of course!\" laughed Frank. \"If I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7356"],["title","The Boy Scout Camera Club; Or, the Confession of a Photograph (#4)"],["body"," become lost in woods or mountains, or anywhere, I'd build two fires and get wet wood to make smudge, good and plenty. That would mean that I was lost and needed assistance. That's the Boy Scout Indian signal for help. I remember when we saw it north of the Arctic Circle, don't you?\"  \"I won't be apt to forget it right away,\" was the reply.  The boys remained standing on the summit for some moments, although it was now too dark for them to distinguish objects in the valley below. All around the June night called to them with its silences and its sharp and sudden rasp of sounds. There were the mountains, brooding, heavy, mysterious, and there were the fleets of flying clouds reaching down to wrap their summits!  \"It is simply great up here!\" Ned exclaimed presently. \"That is the only word that seems to express it--great!\"  \"Yes, it is fine for a change,\" Frank admitted, \"though I don't believe in the wilds as a permanent thing! Everything in the mountains and forests seems to me to be crude and half done. This, I presume, is because the world isn't finished yet. Those who come to places like this catch the Creator with his sleeves rolled up, if that isn't a coarse way of saying it.\"  \"I like it, just the same!\" Ned declared. \"It is glorious! It is life!\"  \"It is healthful so far as animal life goes,\" laughed Frank, \"but what about mental life? There would never have been anything wonderful in the way of inventions--like the wireless, and the telephone, and the uses of electricity--if mankind had been content to live and die in the wilds! It is crude, as I said before, unfinished, out of line with all the decrees of art. I'll take the city for mine, with its marble buildings, its wonderful art galleries, its beautiful parks!\"  \"Say, you mooners!\" came a voice from the camp below, \"if you've got done surveying the beautiful black landscape, suppose you come down to supper?\"  The boys went down to the tent to find Jimmie and Teddy still absent.  \"There are two things we'll have to set aside time for,\" Ned declared, as he took a seat on the ground before the blaze, with a great plate of food in his lap. \"We'll have to arrange for keeping Uncle Ike, the mule, out of mischief, and for keeping track of Jimmie and Teddy. Those boys will get lost in the mountains yet, and go hungry for a few days. That would be punishment enough for Jimmie--hunger!\"  The boys sat by the campfire a long time, heaping dry wood on the blaze until they were obliged to widen the circle about it. There was only the light of the stars, looking down from a cloud-flecked sky, but there would be a moon shortly after ten o'clock.  \"If the boys don't return before long,\" Frank broke out, after a moment of silence, \"I'm going to take a searchlight and go out looking for them.\"  The boy expressed the thought which was brooding in the minds of them all. They were more than anxious for the safety of the two truants. Oliver arose and walked away from the fire up the slope, until his figure was out of sight, but shortly came back and sat down again, his face expressing impatience as well as anxiety.  \"There's no reason why they shouldn't see this fire,\" he said. \"I walked over the summit a bit to see if the light was reflected over there. It is. If anywhere within two miles, they ought to see this blaze or the glow from it. They're just doing this to make us worry. I'd like to get them by the neck, this minute,\" he added.  Uncle Ike, the mule, gave vent to a vicious scream at that moment, and Ned arose and started in the direction of the feeding ground. When he reached the spot he saw that the mules were agitated, weaving about on the tying lines in either fear or anger.  \"Uncle Ike,\" Ned said, patting the ugly beast on the neck, \"what is it about your sleeping chamber that you don't like? Or it is your supper you object to?\"  Uncle Ike thrust his long ears forward and elevated his heels, as if kicking at some imaginary object back of him. Then Ned saw a figure moving in the darkness.  \"Come out of that!\" he called. \"Why are you sneaking around here?\"  The figure advanced toward the boy then--the figure of an old woman!     CHAPTER V  JIMMIE AND TEDDY MISS A MEAL   \"I was scared to come up until I heard your voice,\" the old lady said, as she came close to Ned. \"I didn't know you were only a boy.\"  The woman appeared to be very old. Her hair was white and her lean face was wrinkled and leathery with time and storm and exposure to the winds of the hills. Still, old as she seemed to be, she walked alertly, with the swinging grace of the true mountain woman. She was very plainly dressed in a one-piece gown of dark calico. Her head was not covered at all, and the white hair took on a tinge of gold from the distant campfire. Her black eyes were sharp, yet kindly in expression.  \"Good evening, mother,\" Ned said, removing his cap as he greeted the old lady, \"we didn't expect to meet ladies here. Do you live in this locality?\"  \"Quite a step,\" the old lady said, in a gentle, hesitating tone, \"quite a bit down the slope is where I live. I wanted to know what the fire meant, and so I came up. You don't mind my being here, do you?\"  \"Glad to have you come!\" Ned responded, truthfully. \"If you care to come up to our camp we'll be glad to give you a cup of tea and whatever else you want.\"  \"I'll be glad to get a cup of tea,\" the woman declared. \"We don't get tea up here in the mountains--not very often. We don't have the money to pay for it, and, then it is such a long way to go after it. Yes, I'll go with you.\"  Ned noted that the woman did not speak the dialect of the mountains. He wondered how long she had lived there, and if she lived alone. She did not long leave him in doubt on these points, for she seemed anxious to talk.  \"I'm Mary Brady,\" she said, as they ascended the slope toward the fire. \"I came here years ago with my husband, Michael Brady, to live in peace. Mike was a good man when he was himself, but the saloon men of New York were always after him when he had any money. We came here to be rid of them.\"  \"That was the correct thing to do, it strikes me,\" Ned said, for want of something better, as she seemed to expect some friendly comment.  \"I don't know,\" she went on. \"We meant it for the best--but there was the moonshine! I didn't know about the moonshine when we came here. All I thought of was to get away from Houston street! He fell one day and they brought him home dead.\"  Ned was strangely interested in this simple life history. The poor old woman living there, probably alone and in want, after such an ending to a hopeful plan!  \"And you kept on here?\" he asked. \"Why didn't you go back to the city?\"  \"There was the boy,\" she answered. \"He was ten when we came here. I didn't want him to get the thirst! After Mike died I lived here to keep him in the good path. He is a good boy, but when he was twenty they got him, too--the moonshiners!\"  \"And he left you?\" asked Ned.  \"He said he couldn't make anything of himself here, so he went to Washington. He's never come back, though I've always kept a home for him, and never ceased to look for him. He writes me now and then that he's coming home, but he doesn't come! When I saw your fire I thought he might be with you.\"  By this time they were at the camp, and Mary Brady was presented to the boys and made comfortable by the fire, with tea and canned fruit before her. She enjoyed the lunch immensely and looked the gratitude she did not speak.  \"When did you hear from your boy last?\" asked Frank, by way of keeping the conversation going. \"Did he write from Washington? Was it to Washington you said he went?\"  \"It was Washington,\" was the reply. \"He wrote me a month or more ago that he would be here with friends in June. I thought he might be with you. He has been married since he left home, and has a child, though his wife is dead.\"  \"And he said he was thinking of bringing the child here?\" asked Ned, glancing significantly at Frank. \"Did he say that in his last letter?\"  \"Yes, that he was thinking of bringing the boy here. It is only a mite of a boy--not more than seven years old, he said. I'm anxious for him to come.\"  Jack and Oliver gathered closer about the old lady in order to hear every word that was spoken. One brought her more tea and the other filled the sauce dish with peaches. Ned motioned to them to remain silent.  \"And so you expect him to drop down on you any time?\" Ned asked.  \"Yes, my son and the boy. He's a cute little chap, Mike says. Mike was named for his father, and the lad's name is Mike, too. I'm anxious for him to get here. And I'm wondering whether he's light and blonde, with brown hair and blue eyes like his father, or dark, like my side of the family.  \"What do you make of it?\" Jack whispered to Oliver.  \"What do I make of what?\" demanded the other.  \"Of the old lady and her three Mikes?\" replied Jack, scornfully. \"Have you been asleep all this time?\"  \"I was waiting for you to express an opinion,\" Oliver declared. \"Do you think it possible that they would change the name of a prince of the royal blood to Mike?\"  \"So you've caught on, at last!\" whispered Jack. \"Do you really think we've tumbled on a streak of luck at the send-off?\"  \"I don't know,\" was the hesitating reply. \"We'll have to cultivate this old lady.\"  \"Sure thing!\"  \"Did she say where her cottage is?\" asked Oliver, directly. \"We ought to verify her story, it seems to me. I'd like to hear Ned's opinion!\"  \"Do you remember what she said about Mike II. having blonde hair and blue eyes?\" asked Jack, presently.  \"Sure!\" was the answer. \"That made me sit up and take notice. It brought back to my memory the light brown hair on the bloody blade of the shears.\"  \"Same here,\" announced Jack. \"If this Mike II. comes here we'll have to find out if he has a cicatrice on the right thumb and a scar on the head, a scar which might have been brought about by a pair of shears thrown by a frightened maid in the city of New York!\"  \"Think"]]]
