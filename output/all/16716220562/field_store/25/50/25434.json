Unless, despite all conjecture, Edward should be spared to earth till the Atheling's infant son acquires the age when bearded men will acknowledge a chief [151], I look round in England for the coming king, and all England reflects but mine own image.\"  His head rose erect as he spoke, and already the brow seemed august, as if circled by the diadem of the Basileus.  \"And if it be so,\" he added, \"I accept that solemn trust, and England shall grow greater in my greatness.\"  \"The flame breaks at last from the smouldering fuel!\" cried the Vala, \"and the hour I so long foretold to thee hath come!\"  Harold answered not, for high and kindling emotions deafened him to all but the voice of a grand ambition, and the awakening joy of a noble heart.  \"And then--and then,\" he exclaimed, \"I shall need no mediator between nature and monkcraft;--then, O Edith, the life thou hast saved will indeed be thine!\"  He paused, and it was a sign of the change that an ambition long repressed, but now rushing into the vent legitimately open to it, had already begun to work in the character hitherto so self-reliant, when he said in a low voice, \"But that dream which hath so long lain locked, not lost, in my mind; that dream of which I recall only vague remembrances of danger yet defiance, trouble yet triumph,--canst thou unriddle it, O Vala, into auguries of success?\"  \"Harold,\" answered Hilda, \"thou didst hear at the close of thy dream, the music of the hymns that are chaunted at the crowning of a king,-- and a crowned king shalt thou be; yet fearful foes shall assail thee-- foreshown in the shapes of a lion and raven, that came in menace over the bloodred sea.  The two stars in the heaven betoken that the day of thy birth was also the birthday of a foe, whose star is fatal to thine; and they warn thee against a battle-field, fought on the day when those stars shall meet.  Farther than this the mystery of thy dream escapes from my lore;--wouldst thou learn thyself, from the phantom that sent the dream;--stand by my side at the grave of the Saxon hero, and I will summon the Scin-laeca to counsel the living. For what to the Vala the dead may deny, the soul of the brave on the brave may bestow!\"  Harold listened with a serious and musing attention which his pride or his reason had never before accorded to the warnings of Hilda.  But his sense was not yet fascinated by the voice of the charmer, and he answered with his wonted smile, so sweet yet so haughty:  \"A hand outstretched to a crown should be armed for the foe; and the eye that would guard the living should not be dimmed by the vapours that encircle the dead.\"     CHAPTER V.   But from that date changes, slight, yet noticeable and important, were at work both in the conduct and character of the great Earl.  Hitherto he had advanced on his career without calculation; and nature, not policy, had achieved his power.  But henceforth he began thoughtfully to cement the foundations of his House, to extend the area, to strengthen the props.  Policy now mingled with the justice that had made him esteemed, and the generosity that had won him love. Before, though by temper conciliatory, yet, through honesty, indifferent to the enmities he provoked, in his adherence to what his conscience approved, he now laid himself out to propitiate all ancient feuds, soothe all jealousies, and convert foes into friends.  He opened constant and friendly communication with his uncle Sweyn, King of Denmark; he availed himself sedulously of all the influence over the Anglo-Danes which his mother's birth made so facile.  He strove also, and wisely, to conciliate the animosities which the Church had cherished against Godwin's house: he concealed his disdain of the monks and monkridden: he showed himself the Church's patron and friend; he endowed largely the convents, and especially one at Waltham, which had fallen into decay, though favourably known for the piety of its brotherhood.  But if in this he played a part not natural to his opinions, Harold could not, even in simulation, administer to evil.  The monasteries he favoured were those distinguished for purity of life, for benevolence to the poor, for bold denunciation of the excesses of the great.  He had not, like the Norman, the grand design of creating in the priesthood a college of learning, a school of arts; such notions were unfamiliar in homely, unlettered England.  And Harold, though for his time and his land no mean scholar, would have recoiled from favouring a learning always made subservient to Rome; always at once haughty and scheming, and aspiring to complete domination over both the souls of men and the thrones of kings.  But his aim was, out of the elements he found in the natural kindliness existing between Saxon priest and Saxon flock, to rear a modest, virtuous, homely clergy, not above tender sympathy with an ignorant population.  He selected as examples for his monastery at Waltham, two low-born humble brothers, Osgood and Ailred; the one known for the courage with which he had gone through the land, preaching to abbot and thegn the emancipation of the theowes, as the most meritorious act the safety of the soul could impose; the other, who, originally a clerk, had, according to the common custom of the Saxon clergy, contracted the bonds of marriage, and with some eloquence had vindicated that custom against the canons of Rome, and refused the offer of large endowments and thegn's rank to put away his wife.  But on the death of that spouse he had adopted the cowl, and while still persisting in the lawfulness of marriage to the unmonastic clerks, had become famous for denouncing the open concubinage which desecrated the holy office, and violated the solemn vows, of many a proud prelate and abbot.  To these two men (both of whom refused the abbacy of Waltham) Harold committed the charge of selecting the new brotherhood established there.  And the monks of Waltham were honoured as saints throughout the neighbouring district, and cited as examples to all the Church.  But though in themselves the new politic arts of Harold seemed blameless enough, arts they were, and as such they corrupted the genuine simplicity of his earlier nature.  He had conceived for the first time an ambition apart from that of service to his country.  It was no longer only to serve the land, it was to serve it as its ruler, that animated his heart and coloured his thoughts.  Expediencies began to dim to his conscience the healthful loveliness of Truth.  And now, too, gradually, that empire which Hilda had gained over his brother Sweyn began to sway this man, heretofore so strong in his sturdy sense.  The future became to him a dazzling mystery, into which his conjectures plunged themselves more and more.  He had not yet stood in the Runic circle and invoked the dead; but the spells were around his heart, and in his own soul had grown up the familiar demon.  Still Edith reigned alone, if not in his thoughts at least in his affections; and perhaps it was the hope of conquering all obstacles to his marriage that mainly induced him to propitiate the Church, through whose agency the object he sought must be attained; and still that hope gave the brightest lustre to the distant crown.  But he who admits Ambition to the companionship of Love, admits a giant that outstrides the gentler footsteps of its comrade.  Harold's brow lost its benign calm.  He became thoughtful and abstracted.  He consulted Edith less, Hilda more.  Edith seemed to him now not wise enough to counsel.  The smile of his Fylgia, like the light of the star upon a stream, lit the surface, but could not pierce to the deep.  Meanwhile, however, the policy of Harold throve and prospered.  He had already arrived at that height, that the least effort to make power popular redoubled its extent.  Gradually all voices swelled the chorus in his praise; gradually men became familiar to the question, \"If Edward dies before Edgar, the grandson of Ironsides, is of age to succeed, where can we find a king like Harold?\"  In the midst of this quiet but deepening sunshine of his fate, there burst a storm, which seemed destined either to darken his day or to disperse every cloud from the horizon.  Algar, the only possible rival to his power--the only opponent no arts could soften--Algar, whose hereditary name endeared him to the Saxon laity, whose father's most powerful legacy was the love of the Saxon Church, whose martial and turbulent spirit had only the more elevated him in the esteem of the warlike Danes in East Anglia (the earldom in which he had succeeded Harold), by his father's death, lord of the great principality of Mercia--availed himself of that new power to break out again into rebellion.  Again he was outlawed, again he leagued with the fiery Gryffyth.  All Wales was in revolt; the Marches were invaded and laid waste.  Rolf, the feeble Earl of Hereford, died at this critical juncture, and the Normans and hirelings under him mutinied against other leaders; a fleet of vikings from Norway ravaged the western coasts, and sailing up the Menai, joined the ships of Gryffyth, and the whole empire seemed menaced with dissolution, when Edward issued his Herr-bane, and Harold at the head of the royal armies marched on the foe.  Dread and dangerous were those defiles of Wales; amidst them had been foiled or slaughtered all the warriors under Rolf the Norman; no Saxon armies had won laurels in the Cymrian's own mountain home within the memory of man; nor had any Saxon ships borne the palm from the terrible vikings of Norway.  Fail, Harold, and farewell the crown!-- succeed, and thou hast on thy side the ultimam rationem regum (the last argument of kings), the heart of the army over which thou art chief.     CHAPTER VI.

The younger of these men was unmistakably a Norman; his cap only partially covered the head, which was shaven from the crown to the nape of the neck [152], while in front the hair, closely cropped, curled short and thick round a haughty but intelligent brow.  His dress fitted close to his shape, and was worn without mantle; his leggings were curiously crossed in the fashion of a tartan, and on his heels were spurs of gold.  He was wholly unarmed; but behind him and his companion, at a little distance, his war-horse, completely caparisoned, was led by a single squire, mounted on a good Norman steed; while six Saxon theowes, themselves on foot, conducted three sumpter-mules, somewhat heavily laden, not only with the armour of the Norman knight, but panniers containing rich robes, wines, and provender.  At a few paces farther behind, marched a troop, light-armed, in tough hides, curiously tanned, with axes swung over their shoulders, and bows in their hands.  The companion of the knight was as evidently a Saxon, as the knight was unequivocally a Norman.  His square short features, contrasting the oval visage and aquiline profile of his close-shaven comrade, were half concealed beneath a bushy beard and immense moustache.  His tunic, also, was of hide, and, tightened at the waist, fell loose to his knee; while a kind of cloak, fastened to the right shoulder by a large round button or brooch, flowed behind and in front, but left both arms free.  His cap differed in shape from the Norman's, being round and full at the sides, somewhat in shape like a turban.  His bare, brawny throat was curiously punctured with sundry devices, and a verse from the Psalms.  His countenance, though without the high and haughty brow, and the acute, observant eye of his comrade, had a pride and intelligence of its own--a pride somewhat sullen, and an intelligence somewhat slow.  \"My good friend, Sexwolf,\" quoth the Norman in very tolerable Saxon, \"I pray you not so to misesteem us.  After all, we Normans are of your own race: our fathers spoke the same language as yours.\"  \"That may be,\" said the Saxon, bluntly, \"and so did the Danes, with little difference, when they burned our houses and cut our throats.\"  \"Old tales, those,\" replied the knight, \"and I thank thee for the comparison; for the Danes, thou seest, are now settled amongst ye, peaceful subjects and quiet men, and in a few generations it will be hard to guess who comes from Saxon, who from Dane.\"  \"We waste time, talking such matters,\" returned the Saxon, feeling himself instinctively no match in argument for his lettered companion; and seeing, with his native strong sense; that some ulterior object, though he guessed not what, lay hid in the conciliatory language of his companion; \"nor do I believe, Master Mallet or Gravel--forgive me if I miss of the right forms to address you--that Norman will ever love Saxon, or Saxon Norman; so let us cut our words short.  There stands the convent, at which you would like to rest and refresh yourself.\"  The Saxon pointed to a low, clumsy building of timber, forlorn and decayed, close by a rank marsh, over which swarmed gnats, and all foul animalcules.  Mallet de Graville, for it was he, shrugged his shoulders, and said, with an air of pity and contempt:  \"I would, friend Sexwolf, that thou couldst but see the houses we build to God and his saints in our Normandy; fabrics of stately stone, on the fairest sites.  Our Countess Matilda hath a notable taste for the masonry; and our workmen are the brethren of Lombardy, who know all the mysteries thereof.\"  \"I pray thee, Dan-Norman,\" cried the Saxon, \"not to put such ideas into the soft head of King Edward.  We pay enow for the Church, though built but of timber; saints help us indeed, if it were builded of stone!\"  The Norman crossed himself, as if he had heard some signal impiety, and then said:  \"Thou lovest not Mother Church, worthy Sexwolf?\"  \"I was brought up,\" replied the sturdy Saxon, \"to work and sweat hard, and I love not the lazy who devour my substance, and say, 'the saints gave it them.'  Knowest thou not, Master Mallet, that one-third of all the lands of England is in the hands of the priests?\"  \"Hem!\" said the acute Norman, who, with all his devotion, could stoop to wring worldly advantage from each admission of his comrade; \"then in this merrie England of thine thou hast still thy grievances and cause of complaint?\"  \"Yea indeed, and I trow it,\" quoth the Saxon, even in that day a grumbler; \"but I take it, the main difference between thee and me is, that I can say what mislikes me out like a man; and it would fare ill with thy limbs or thy life if thou wert as frank in the grim land of thy heretogh.\"  \"Now, Notre Dame stop thy prating,\" said the Norman, in high disdain, while his brow frowned and his eye sparkled.  \"Strong judge and great captain as is William the Norman, his barons and knights hold their heads high in his presence, and not a grievance weighs on the heart that we give not out with the lip.\"  \"So have I heard,\" said the Saxon, chuckling; \"I have heard, indeed, that ye thegns, or great men, are free enow, and plainspoken.  But what of the commons--the sixhaendmen and the ceorls, master Norman? Dare they speak as we speak of king and of law, of thegn and of captain?\"  The Norman wisely curbed the scornful \"No, indeed,\" that rushed to his lips, and said, all sweet and debonnair: \"Each land hath its customs, dear Sexwolf: and if the Norman were king of England, he would take the laws as he finds them, and the ceorls would be as safe with William as Edward.\"  \"The Norman king of England!\" cried the Saxon, reddening to the tips of his great ears, \"what dost thou babble of, stranger?  The Norman!-- How could that ever be?\"  \"Nay, I did but suggest--but suppose such a case,\" replied the knight, still smothering his wrath.  \"And why thinkest thou the conceit so outrageous?  Thy King is childless; William is his next of kin, and dear to him as a brother; and if Edward did leave him the throne--\"  \"The throne is for no man to leave,\" almost roared the Saxon. \"Thinkest thou the people of England are like cattle and sheep, and chattels and theowes, to be left by will, as man fancies?  The King's wish has its weight, no doubt, but the Witan hath its yea or its nay, and the Witan and Commons are seldom at issue thereon.  Thy duke King of England!  Marry!  Ha! ha!\"  \"Brute!\" muttered the knight to himself; then adding aloud, with his old tone of irony (now much habitually subdued by years and discretion), \"Why takest thou so the part of the ceorls? thou a captain, and well-nigh a thegn!\"  \"I was born a ceorl, and my father before me,\" returned Sexwolf, \"and I feel with my class; though my grandson may rank with the thegns, and, for aught I know, with the earls.\"  The Sire de Graville involuntarily drew off from the Saxon's side, as if made suddenly aware that he had grossly demeaned himself in such unwitting familiarity with a ceorl, and a ceorl's son; and he said, with a much more careless accent and lofty port than before:  \"Good man, thou wert a ceorl, and now thou leadest Earl Harold's men to the war!  How is this?  I do not quite comprehend it.\"  \"How shouldst thou, poor Norman?\" replied the Saxon, compassionately. \"The tale is soon told.  Know that when Harold our Earl was banished, and his lands taken, we his ceorls helped with his sixhaendman, Clapa, to purchase his land, nigh by London, and the house wherein thou didst find me, of a stranger, thy countryman, to whom they were lawlessly given.  And we tilled the land, we tended the herds, and we kept the house till the Earl came back.\"  \"Ye had moneys then, moneys of your own, ye ceorls!\" said the Norman, avariciously.  \"How else could we buy our freedom?  Every ceorl hath some hours to himself to employ to his profit, and can lay by for his own ends. These savings we gave up for our Earl, and when the Earl came back, he gave the sixhaendman hides of land enow to make him a thegn; and he gave the ceorls who hade holpen Clapa, their freedom and broad shares of his boc-land, and most of them now hold their own ploughs and feed their own herds.  But I loved the Earl (having no wife) better than swine and glebe, and I prayed him to let me serve him in arms.  And so I have risen, as with us ceorls can rise.\"  \"I am answered,\" said Mallet de Graville, thoughtfully, and still somewhat perplexed.  \"But these theowes, (they are slaves,) never rise.  It cannot matter to them whether shaven Norman or bearded Saxon sit on the throne?\"  \"Thou art right there,\" answered the Saxon; \"it matters as little to them as it doth to thy thieves and felons, for many of them are felons and thieves, or the children of such; and most of those who are not, it is said, are not Saxons, but the barbarous folks whom the Saxons subdued.  No, wretched things, and scarce men, they care nought for the land.  Howbeit, even they are not without hope, for the Church takes their part; and that, at least, I for one think Church-worthy,\" added the Saxon with a softened eye.  \"And every abbot is bound to set free three theowes on his lands, and few who own theowes die without freeing some by their will; so that the sons of theowes may be thegns, and thegns some of them are at this day.\"  \"Marvels!\" cried the Norman.  \"But surely they bear a stain and stigma, and their fellow-thegns flout them?\"  \"Not a whit--why so? land is land, money money.  Little, I trow, care we what a man's father may have been, if the man himself hath his ten hides or more of good boc-land.\"  \"Ye value land and the moneys,\" said the Norman, \"so do we, but we value more name and birth.\"  \"Ye are still in your leading-strings, Norman,\" replied the Saxon, waxing good-humoured in his contempt.  \"We have an old saying and a wise one, 'All come from Adam except Tib the ploughman: but when Tib"]]]
