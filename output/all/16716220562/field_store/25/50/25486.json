Meanwhile Henry had concluded the letter, and with a heavy sigh glanced over the papers that accompanied it.  \"Alack! alack! more turbulence, more danger and disquiet, more of my people's blood!\"  He motioned to the young man, and drawing him to the window, while Adam returned to his model, put the papers in his hand.  \"Allerton,\" he said, \"thou lovest me, but thou art one of the few in this distraught land who love also God.  Thou art not one of the warriors, the men of steel.  Counsel me.  See: Margaret demands my signature to these papers; the one, empowering and craving the levy of men and arms in the northern counties; the other, promising free pardon to all who will desert Edward; the third--it seemeth to me more strange and less kinglike than the others--undertaking to abolish all the imposts and all the laws that press upon the commons, and (is this a holy and pious stipulation?) to inquire into the exactions and persecutions of the priesthood of our Holy Church!\"  \"Sire!\" said the young man, after he had hastily perused the papers, \"my lady liege showeth good argument for your assent to two, at least, of these undertakings.  See the names of fifty gentlemen ready to take arms in your cause if authorized by your royal warrant.  The men of the North are malcontent with the usurper, but they will not yet stir, unless at your own command.  Such documents will, of course, be used with discretion, and not to imperil your Grace's safety.\"  \"My safety!\" said Henry, with a flash of his father's hero soul in his eyes--\"of that I think not!  If I have small courage to attack, I have some fortitude to bear.  But three months after these be signed, how many brave hearts will be still! how many stout hands be dust!  O Margaret!  Margaret! why temptest thou?  Wert thou so happy when a queen?\"  The prisoner broke from Allerton's arm, and walked, in great disorder and irresolution, to and fro the chamber; and strange it was to see the contrast between himself and Warner,--both in so much alike, both so purely creatures out of the common world, so gentle, abstract, so utterly living in the life apart: and now the student so calm, the prince so disturbed!  The contrast struck Henry himself!  He paused abruptly, and, folding his arms, contemplated the philosopher, as, with an affectionate complacency, Adam played and toyed, as it were, with his beloved model; now opening and shutting again its doors, now brushing away with his sleeve some particles of dust that had settled on it, now retiring a few paces to gaze the better on its stern symmetry.  \"Oh, my Allerton!\" cried Henry, \"behold! the kingdom a man makes out of his own mind is the only one that it delighteth man to govern! Behold, he is lord over its springs and movements; its wheels revolve and stop at his bidding.  Here, here, alone, God never asketh the ruler, 'Why was the blood of thousands poured forth like water, that a worm might wear a crown?'\"  \"Sire,\" said Allerton, solemnly, \"when our Heavenly King appoints his anointed representative on earth, He gives to that human delegate no power to resign the ambassade and trust. What suicide is to a man, abdication is to a king!  How canst thou dispose of thy son's rights? And what becomes of those rights if thou wilt prefer for him the exile, for thyself the prison, when one effort may restore a throne!\"  Henry seemed struck by a tone of argument that suited both his own mind and the reasoning of the age.  He gazed a moment on the face of the young man, muttered to himself, and suddenly moving to the table, signed the papers, and restored them to Adam, who mechanically replaced them in their iron hiding-place.  \"Now begone, Sir!\" whispered Allerton, afraid that Henry's mind might again change.  \"Will not my lord examine the engine?\" asked Warner, half- beseechingly.  \"Not to-day!  See, he has already retired to his oratory, he is in prayer!\" and, going to the door, Allerton summoned the attendants in waiting to carry down the model.  \"Well, well, patience, patience! thou shalt have thine audience at last,\" muttered Adam, as he retired from the room, his eyes fixed upon the neglected infant of his brain.     CHAPTER VI.  HOW, ON LEAVING KING LOG, FOOLISH WISDOM RUNS A-MUCK ON KING STORK.  At the outer door of the Tower by which he had entered, the philosopher was accosted by Catesby,--a man who, in imitation of his young patron, exhibited the soft and oily manner which concealed intense ambition and innate ferocity.  \"Worshipful my master,\" said he, bowing low, but with a half sneer on his lips, \"the king and his Highness the Duke of Gloucester have heard much of your strange skill, and command me to lead you to their presence.  Follow, sir, and you, my men, convey this quaint contrivance to the king's apartments.\"  With this, not waiting for any reply, Catesby strode on.  Hugh's face fell; he turned very pale, and, imagining himself unobserved, turned round to slink away.  But Catesby, who seemed to have eyes at the back of his head, called out, in a mild tone,--  \"Good fellow, help to bear the mechanical--you, too, may be needed.\"  \"Cog's wounds!\" muttered Hugh, \"an' I had but known what it was to set my foot in a king's palace!  Such walking may do for the silken shoon, but the hobnail always gets into a hobble.\"  With that, affecting a cheerful mien, he helped to replace the model on the mule.  Meanwhile, Adam, elated, poor man! at the flattery of the royal mandate, persuaded that his fame had reached Edward's ears, and chafed at the little heed paid by the pious Henry to his great work, stalked on, his head in the air.  \"Verily,\" mused the student, \"King Edward may have been a cruel youth, and over hasty; it is horrible to think of Robert Hilyard's calamities!  But men do say he hath an acute and masterly comprehension.  Doubtless, he will perceive at a glance how much I can advantage his kingdom.\"  With this, we grieve to say, selfish reflection--which, if the thought of his model could have slept a while, Adam would have blushed to recall, as an affront to Hilyard's wrongs--the philosopher followed Catesby across the spacious yard, along a narrow passage, and up a winding turret-stair, to a room in the third story, which opened at one door into the king's closet, at the other into the spacious gallery, which was already a feature in the plan of the more princely houses.  In another minute Adam and his model were in the presence of the king.  The part of the room in which Edward sat was distinguished from the rest by a small eastern carpet on the floor (a luxury more in use in the palaces of that day than it appears to have been a century later); [see the Narrative of the Lord Grauthuse, before referred to] a table was set before him, on which the model was placed.  At his right hand sat Jacquetta, Duchess of Bedford, the queen's mother; at his left, Prince Richard.  The duchess, though not without the remains of beauty, had a stern, haughty, scornful expression in her sharp aquiline features, compressed lips, and imperious eye.  The paleness of her complexion, and the careworn, anxious lines of her countenance, were ascribed by the vulgar to studies of no holy cast. Her reputation for sorcery and witchcraft was daily increasing, and served well the purpose of the discontented barons, whom the rise of her children mortified and enraged.  \"Approach, Master--What say you his name is, Richard?\"  \"Adam Warner,\" replied the sweet voice of the Duke of Gloucester; \"of excellent skill in the mathematics.\"  \"Approach, sir, and show us the nature of this notable invention.\"  \"I desire nothing better, my lord king,\" said Adam, boldly; \"but first let me crave a small modicum of fuel.  Fire, which is the life of the world, as the wise of old held it, is also the soul of this, my mechanical.\"  \"Peradventure,\" whispered the duchess, \"the wizard desireth to consume us.\"  \"More likely,\" replied Richard, in the same undertone, \"to consume whatever of treasonable nature may lurk concealed in his engine.\"  \"True,\" said Edward, and then, speaking aloud, \"Master Warner,\" he added, \"put thy puppet to its purpose without fire,--we will it.\"  \"It is impossible, my lord,\" said Adam, with a lofty smile.  \"Science and nature are more powerful than a king's word.\"  \"Do not say that in public, my friend,\" said Edward, dryly, \"or we must hang thee!  I would not my subjects were told anything so treasonable.  Howbeit, to give thee no excuse in failure, thou shalt have what thou needest.\"  \"But surely not in our presence,\" exclaimed the duchess.  \"This may be a device of the Lancastrians for our perdition.\"  \"As you please, belle mere,\" said Edward, and he motioned to a gentleman, who stood a few paces behind his chair, and who, from the entrance of the mechanician, had seemed to observe him with intense interest. \"Master Nevile, attend this wise man; supply his wants, and hark, in thy ear, watch well that he abstract nothing from the womb of his engine; observe what he doeth; be all eyes.\"  Marmaduke bowed low to conceal his change of countenance, and, stepping forward, made a sign to Adam to follow him.  \"Go also, Catesby,\" said Richard to his follower, who had taken his post near him, \"and clear the chamber.\"  As soon as the three members of the royal family were left alone, the king, stretching himself, with a slight yawn, observed, \"This man looks not like a conspirator, brother Richard, though his sententiary as to nature and science lacked loyalty and respect.\"  \"Sire and brother,\" answered Richard, \"great leaders often dupe their own tools;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7717"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 03 (#8)"],["body","least, meseemeth that they would reason well so to do. Remember, I have told thee that there is strong cause to suppose Margaret to be in London.  In the suburbs of the city has also appeared, within the last few weeks, that strange and dangerous person, whose very objects are a mystery, save that he is our foe,-- Robin of Redesdale.  The men of the North have exhibited a spirit of insurrection; a man of that country attends this reputed wizard, and he himself was favoured in past times by Henry of Windsor.  These are ominous signs when the conjunctions be considered!\"  \"It is well said; but a fair day for breathing our palfrey is half- spent!\" returned the indolent prince.  \"By'r Lady!  I like the fashion of thy super-tunic well, Richard; but thou hast it too much puffed over the shoulders.\"  Richard's dark eye shot fire, and he gnawed his lip as he answered, \"God hath not given to me the fair shape of my kinsmen.\"  \"Thy pardon, dear boy,\" said Edward, kindly; \"yet little needest thou our broad backs and strong sinews, for thou hast a tongue to charm women and a wit to command men.\"  Richard bowed his face, little less beautiful than his brother's, though wholly different from it in feature, for Edward had the long oval countenance, the fair hair, the rich colouring, and the large outline of his mother, the Rose of Raby.  Richard, on the contrary, had the short face, the dark brown locks, and the pale olive complexion of his father, whom he alone of the royal brothers strikingly resembled.  [Pol. Virg. 544.]  The cheeks, too, were somewhat sunken, and already, though scarcely past childhood, about his lips were seen the lines of thoughtful manhood.  But then those small features, delicately aquiline, were so regular; that dark eye was so deep, so fathomless in its bright, musing intelligence; that quivering lip was at once so beautifully formed and so expressive of intellectual subtlety and haughty will; and that pale forehead was so massive, high, and majestic,--that when, at a later period, the Scottish prelate [Archibald Quhitlaw.--\"Faciem tuam summo imperio principatu dignam inspicit, quam moralis et heroica, virtus illustrat,\" etc.--We need scarcely observe that even a Scotchman would not have risked a public compliment to Richard's face, if so inappropriate as to seem a sarcasm, especially as the orator immediately proceeds to notice the shortness of Richard's stature,--a comment not likely to have been peculiarly acceptable in the Rous Roll, the portrait of Richard represents him as undersized, but compactly and strongly built, and without any sign of deformity, unless the inelegant defect of a short neck can be so called.] commended Richard's \"princely countenance,\" the compliment was not one to be disputed, much less contemned.  But now as he rose, obedient to a whisper from the duchess, and followed her to the window, while Edward appeared engaged in admiring the shape of his own long, upturned shoes, those defects in his shape which the popular hatred and the rise of the House of Tudor exaggerated into the absolute deformity that the unexamining ignorance of modern days and Shakspeare's fiery tragedy have fixed into established caricature, were sufficiently apparent.  Deformed or hunchbacked we need scarcely say he was not, for no man so disfigured could have possessed that great personal strength which he invariably exhibited in battle, despite the comparative slightness of his frame.  He was considerably below the ordinary height, which the great stature of his brother rendered yet more disadvantageous by contrast; but his lower limbs were strong-jointed and muscular.  Though the back was not curved, yet one shoulder was slightly higher than the other, which was the more observable from the evident pains that he took to disguise it, and the gorgeous splendour, savouring of personal coxcombry--from which no Plantagenet was ever free,--that he exhibited in his dress.  And as, in a warlike age, the physical conformation of men is always critically regarded, so this defect and that of his low stature were not so much redeemed as they would be in our day by the beauty and intelligence of his face.  Added to this, his neck was short, and a habit of bending his head on his bosom (arising either from thought, or the affectation of humility, which was a part of his character) made it seem shorter still.  But this peculiarity, while taking from the grace, added to the strength of his frame, which, spare, sinewy, and compact, showed to an observer that power of endurance, that combination of solid stubbornness and active energy, which, at the battle of Barnet, made him no less formidable to encounter than the ruthless sword of the mighty Edward.  \"So, prince,\" said the duchess, \"this new gentleman of the king's is, it seems, a Nevile.  When will Edward's high spirit cast off that hateful yoke?\"  Richard sighed and shook his head.  The duchess, encouraged by these signs of sympathy, continued,--  \"Your brother Clarence, Prince Richard, despises us, to cringe to the proud earl.  But you--\"  \"I am not suitor to the Lady Isabel; Clarence is overlavish, and Isabel has a fair face and a queenly dowry.\"  \"May I perish,\" said the duchess, \"ere Warwick's daughter wears the baudekin of royalty, and sits in as high a state as the queen's mother!  Prince, I would fain confer with thee; we have a project to abase and banish this hateful lord.  If you but join us, success is sure; the Count of Charolois--\"  \"Dear lady,\" interrupted Richard, with an air of profound humility, \"tell me nothing of plot or project; my years are too few for such high and subtle policy; and the Lord Warwick hath been a leal friend to our House of York.\"  The duchess bit her lip--\"Yet I have heard you tell Edward that a subject can be too powerful?\"  \"Never, lady! you have never heard me.\"  \"Then Edward has told Elizabeth that you so spoke.\"  \"Ah,\" said Richard, turning away with a smile, \"I see that the king's conscience hath a discreet keeper.  Pardon me, Edward, now that he hath sufficiently surveyed his shoon, must marvel at this prolonged colloquy.  And see, the door opens.\"  With this, the duke slowly moved to the table, and resumed his seat.  Marmaduke, full of fear for his ancient host, had in vain sought an opportunity to address a few words of exhortation to him to forbear all necromancy, and to abstain from all perilous distinctions between the power of Edward IV. and that of his damnable Nature and Science; but Catesby watched him with so feline a vigilance, that he was unable to slip in more than--\"Ah, Master Warner, for our blessed Lord's sake, recollect that rack and cord are more than mere words here!\"  To the which pleasant remark, Adam, then busy in filling his miniature boiler, only replied by a wistful stare, not in the least recognizing the Nevile in his fine attire, and the new-fashioned mode of dressing his long hair.  But Catesby watched in vain for the abstraction of any treasonable contents in the engine, which the Duke of Gloucester had so shrewdly suspected.  The truth must be told.  Adam had entirely forgotten that in the intricacies of his mechanical lurked the papers that might overthrow a throne!  Magnificent Incarnation was he (in that oblivion) of Science itself, which cares not a jot for men and nations, in their ephemeral existences; which only remembers THINGS,--things that endure for ages; and in its stupendous calculations loses sight of the unit of a generation!  No, he had thoroughly forgotten Henry, Edward, his own limbs and life,--not only York and Lancaster, but Adam Warner and the rack.  Grand in his forgetfulness, he stood before the tiger and the tiger-cat,--Edward and--Richard,--A Pure Thought, a Man's Soul; Science fearless in the presence of Cruelty, Tyranny, Craft, and Power.  In truth, now that Adam was thoroughly in his own sphere, was in the domain of which he was king, and those beings in velvet and ermine were but as ignorant savages admitted to the frontier of his realm, his form seemed to dilate into a majesty the beholders had not before recognized; and even the lazy Edward muttered involuntarily, \"By my halidame, the man has a noble presence!\"  \"I am prepared now, sire,\" said Adam, loftily, \"to show to my king and to this court, that, unnoticed and obscure, in study and retreat, often live those men whom kings may be proud to call their subjects. Will it please you, my lords, this way!\" and he motioned so commandingly to the room in which he had left the Eureka, that his audience rose by a common impulse, and in another minute stood grouped round the model in the adjoining chamber.  This really wonderful invention--so wonderful, indeed, that it will surpass the faith of those who do not pause to consider what vast forestallments of modern science have been made and lost in the darkness of ages not fitted to receive them--was, doubtless, in many important details not yet adapted for the practical uses to which Adam designed its application. But as a mere model, as a marvellous essay, for the suggestion of gigantic results, it was, perhaps, to the full as effective as the ingenuity of a mechanic of our own day could construct.  It is true that it was crowded with unnecessary cylinders, slides, cocks, and wheals--hideous and clumsy to the eye--but through this intricacy the great simple design accomplished its main object.  It contrived to show what force and skill man can obtain from the alliance of nature; the more clearly, inasmuch as the mechanism affixed to it, still more ingenious than itself, was well calculated to illustrate practically one of the many uses to which the principle was destined to be applied.  Adam had not yet fathomed the secret by which to supply the miniature cylinder with sufficient steam for any prolonged effect,--the great truth of latent heat was unknown to him; but he had contrived to regulate the supply of water so as to make the engine discharge its"]]]
