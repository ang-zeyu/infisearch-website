He likewise caused copies of the Law to be made, so that it might never be lost again; and the Jews have a story, that knowing the Temple was to be destroyed, he saved the Ark of the Covenant, Aaron's rod, and the pot of manna, from sacrilege, by hiding them away in the hollow of Mount Nebo, where they have never since been found; but this is quite uncertain.  Josiah lived between two mighty powers; the King of Babylon, who had newly taken Nineveh, and Pharaoh Necho, King of Egypt, a very bold and able man, who hired Phoenician ships to sail round Africa, and then did not believe the crews when they came back, because they said they had seen the sun to the north at noon, and wool growing on trees. He tried to cut a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea; and wishing to check the power of Babylon, he brought an army by sea to make war upon Assyria, landing at Acre under Mount Carmel, and intending to march through Gilead. Josiah, being a tributary of Babylon, thought it his duty to endeavour to stop him, and going out to battle with him at Megiddo, was there mortally wounded, and died on his way home, in the year 611. The mourning of the Jews over their good king was so bitter, that it was a proverb long after; and they had indeed reason to lament, for he was the last who stood between them and their sin and their punishment.  Jehoahaz, or Shallum, his third son, a wicked young man, only reigned while Necho was fighting a battle with the Babylonians on the Euphrates, and then was carried off in chains to Egypt, while Necho set up Eliakim, or Jehoiakim, another brother, in his stead. Jehoiakim was idolatrous, cruel, and violent; he persecuted the prophets, and did everything to draw on himself the punishment of Heaven. Necho, making another invasion, was defeated by the great Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, and hunted back by him into Egypt. On his way Nebuchadnezzar seized Jerusalem, in the year 606, and carried off some of the treasures of the Temple, and many of the royal family, to Babylon, among them the four holy children, but he let Jehoiakim continue to reign as his vassal. Jeremiah prophesied that the time of captivity and desolation should last seventy years from this time, but the worst was not yet come. Jehoiakim was bent on trusting for help to the Egyptians, who had made him king, and treated Jeremiah as a traitor for counselling him to be loyal to the Assyrians; he threw Jeremiah into prison, and when Baruch read the roll of his prophecies in the Temple, he caused it to be cut to pieces and destroyed. At last he rebelled, relying on help from Egypt, but it did not come, for Necho was dying; and in the year 598, Nebuchadnezzar himself came up against Jerusalem, and besieged it. Jehoiakim died in the midst of the war, and his equally wicked son, Jehoiachin, Coniah, or Jeconiah, was soon forced to come out, and surrender to Nebuchadnezzar, who dishonoured his father's corpse, and carried him away to Babylon, with the chief treasures of the Temple, and a great multitude of warriors and mechanics. Among them was the prophet Ezekiel, who, on the banks of the Chebar, saw mighty visions of the chariot of God borne up by the Cherubim; and while he rebuked the present Jews for their crimes, promised restoration, and beheld the new and more perfect Building of God measured out by the angel. A marble cylinder with most of this prophecy engraven on it in Assyrian characters, has lately been found in the ruins near the Tigris.  The last son of Josiah, Mattanias, or Zedekiah, was set up as king, and reigned for eleven years; like his brothers, wavering and sinning, and trusting to false prophets, instead of Jeremiah, who gave him hopes of rest, if he would only bear his present fallen state meekly, and not trust to Egypt. The counsellors who loved Egypt, however, persuaded him to rebel, as Pharaoh Hophra was actually coming out to his assistance; and he put Jeremiah into prison for prophesying that he would bring ruin on himself, Nebuchadnezzar soon marched upon him, and besieged Jerusalem; and his friend, Pharaoh Hophra, left him to his fate, showing himself the broken reed that Jeremiah had said he would prove. The siege of Jerusalem lasted a year, and no one suffered more than the prophet, who was thrown into a noisome prison, and afterwards lowered into a pit, where he nearly died; but not for all this did he cease to denounce the judgments of God on the rebellious city. Horrible famine prevailed, and the streets were full of dead; but Jeremiah told the king, that if he would go out and make terms with Nebuchadnezzar all might yet be saved. But Zedekiah would not listen, and at last broke out with his men of war to cut his way through the enemy. His self-will met its deserts; he was taken by Nebuzaradan, the captain who had been left to carry on the siege, and brought a prisoner to Babylon, after his sons had been slain in his very sight, and his eyes then put out, according to a prophecy of Ezekiel, which he is said to have thought impossible; namely, that he should die at Babylon, and yet never see it.  The Temple was stripped of the last remains of its glory, and utterly overthrown, the walls were broken down, and the place left desolate; the Edomites who were in the conqueror's army savagely exulting in the fall of their kindred nation; but both Psalm cxxxvii. and the Prophet Obadiah spoke of vengeance in store for them likewise. All the Jews of high rank were carried away, and none left but the poorer sort, who were to till the ground under a ruler named Gedaliah. Jeremiah, who was offered his choice of going to Babylon or remaining in Judea, preferred to continue near the once glorious city, whose solitude and ruin he bewailed in the mournful Book of Lamentations; and he did his utmost to persuade the remaining Jews to rest quietly under the dominion of Assyria. Had they done so, there would yet have been peace; but Ishmael, a prince of the seed royal, who had fled to the Ammonites during the invasion, came back, and in the hope of making himself king murdered Gedaliah at a harvest feast, with many Jews and Chaldeans, and was on his way to his friend, the King of Ammon, when Johanan, a friend of Gedaliah, came upon him and slew many of his party, so that he escaped with only eight men to the Ammonites. So shocked were the Jews at this murder of Gedaliah, that they ever after kept a fast on the anniversary. Johanan now asked counsel from Jeremiah, who still enjoined him to submit to the Assyrians, but assured him that if he went to Egypt it would only be to share the ruin of that country; but Johanan and his friends would not listen, and carried all the remnant of Judah, and Jeremiah himself, off by force into Egypt. All this happened in the miserable year 588, and Jerusalem remained utterly waste, the land enjoying a long sabbath of desolation, What became of Jeremiah afterwards is not known; he is said to have been stoned in Egypt, but this is not at all certain. He left behind him the promise that a Deliverer should come--the Lord our Righteousness--and that the former redemption out of bondage in Egypt should be as nothing in comparison with the ingathering of the New Covenant from the north country and from all countries; also that the New Covenant should be within, written upon the hearts and minds of the faithful.     LESSON XI.  BABYLON.  \"By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we remembered thee, O Sion.\"--_Psalm_ cxxxvii, 1.   Babylon, the city which was to be the place of captivity of the Jews, was the home of the Chaldeans, who are believed not to have been the sons of Gush, like the Assyrians whom they had conquered at Nineveh, but to have been at first a wandering tribe of the north, and to have descended from Japhet. They had nearly the same gods as the Ninevites, but thought the special protector of their city was Bel-Merodach, the name by which they called the planet Jupiter. They were such great observers of the courses of the stars, that astronomy is said to have begun with them; but this was chiefly because they fancied that the heavenly bodies would help them to foretel coming events, for they put great faith in soothsayers. They settled upon the bank of the Euphrates, near the ruins of the Tower of Babel, round which a city arose, sometimes free, sometimes under the power of the King of Nineveh.  In the time of the weak and luxurious Saracus, Nabopolassar was governor of Babylon. He joined himself to the Medea, giving his son, Nebuchadnezzar, in marriage to the Median Princess Amytis; and as has already been said, the two nations together destroyed Nineveh, after which, Babylon became the head of the Assyrian Empire, and Nebuchadnezzar was the king.  He made the city exceedingly grand and beautiful. It was fifty five miles in circuit, square, surrounded by a wall eighty-seven feet thick, and three hundred and fifty high, with houses and a street on the top, and an enormous ditch filled with water all round, another lesser wall some way within. There were one hundred brazen gates in the wall, besides two larger gateways upon the Euphrates, which ran through the middle, dividing the city into two parts. It was full of streets and houses, with such fields and vineyards, that it was like a whole country walled in; and the soil was exceedingly rich, being all brought down from the Armenian hills by the Euphrates. As this river rose in the mountains of Armenia, it used to overflow in the spring, when the snows melted and swelled the stream; but to prevent mischief, the country was covered with a network of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7298"],["title","William Tell Told Again (#0)"],["body","the Online Distributed Proofreading Team, and the Oxford College Library of Emory University        [Transcriber's note: _William Tell Told Again_ is two children's books in one.

WILLIAM TELL     CHAPTER I   Once upon a time, more years ago than anybody can remember, before the first hotel had been built or the first Englishman had taken a photograph of Mont Blanc and brought it home to be pasted in an album and shown after tea to his envious friends, Switzerland belonged to the Emperor of Austria, to do what he liked with.  One of the first things the Emperor did was to send his friend Hermann Gessler to govern the country. Gessler was not a nice man, and it soon became plain that he would never make himself really popular with the Swiss. The point on which they disagreed in particular was the question of taxes. The Swiss, who were a simple and thrifty people, objected to paying taxes of any sort. They said they wanted to spend their money on all kinds of other things. Gessler, on the other hand, wished to put a tax on everything, and, being Governor, he did it. He made everyone who owned a flock of sheep pay a certain sum of money to him; and if the farmer sold his sheep and bought cows, he had to pay rather more money to Gessler for the cows than he had paid for the sheep. Gessler also taxed bread, and biscuits, and jam, and buns, and lemonade, and, in fact, everything he could think of, till the people of Switzerland determined to complain. They appointed Walter Fürst, who had red hair and looked fierce; Werner Stauffacher, who had gray hair and was always wondering how he ought to pronounce his name; and Arnold of Melchthal, who had light-yellow hair and was supposed to know a great deal about the law, to make the complaint. They called on the Governor one lovely morning in April, and were shown into the Hall of Audience.  \"Well,\" said Gessler, \"and what's the matter now?\"  The other two pushed Walter Fürst forward because he looked fierce, and they thought he might frighten the Governor.  Walter Fürst coughed.  \"Well?\" asked Gessler.  \"Er--ahem!\" said Walter Fürst.  \"That's the way,\" whispered Werner; \"_give_ it him!\"  \"Er--ahem!\" said Walter Fürst again; \"the fact is, your Governorship--\"  \"It's a small point,\" interrupted Gessler, \"but I'm generally called 'your Excellency.' Yes?\"  \"The fact is, your Excellency, it seems to the people of Switzerland--\"  \"--Whom I represent,\" whispered Arnold of Melchthal.  \"--Whom I represent, that things want changing.\"  \"What things?\" inquired Gessler.  \"The taxes, your excellent Governorship.\"  \"Change the taxes? Why, don't the people of Switzerland think there are enough taxes?\"  Arnold of Melchthal broke in hastily.  \"They think there are many too many,\" he said. \"What with the tax on sheep, and the tax on cows, and the tax on bread, and the tax on tea, and the tax--\"  \"I know, _I_ know,\" Gessler interrupted; \"I know all the taxes. Come to the point. What about 'em?\"  \"Well, your Excellency, there are too many of them.\"  \"Too many!\"  \"Yes. And we are not going to put up with it any longer!\" shouted Arnold of Melchthal.  Gessler leaned forward in his throne.  \"Might I ask you to repeat that remark?\" he said.  \"We are not going to put up with it any longer!\"  Gessler sat back again with an ugly smile.  \"Oh,\" he said--\"oh, indeed! You aren't, aren't you! Desire the Lord High Executioner to step this way,\" he added to a soldier who stood beside him.  The Lord High Executioner entered the presence. He was a kind-looking old gentleman with white hair, and he wore a beautiful black robe, tastefully decorated with death's-heads.  \"Your Excellency sent for me?\" he said.  \"Just so,\" replied Gessler. \"This gentleman here\"--he pointed to Arnold of Melchthal--\"says he does not like taxes, and that he isn't going to put up with them any longer.\"  \"Tut-tut!\" murmured the executioner.  \"See what you can do for him.\"  \"Certainly, your Excellency. Robert,\" he cried, \"is the oil on the boil?\"  \"Just this minute boiled over,\" replied a voice from the other side of the door.  \"Then bring it in, and mind you don't spill any.\"  Enter Robert, in a suit of armour and a black mask, carrying a large caldron, from which the steam rose in great clouds.  \"Now, sir, if you please,\" said the executioner politely to Arnold of Melchthal.  Arnold looked at the caldron.  \"Why, it's hot,\" he said.  \"Warmish,\" admitted the executioner.  \"It's against the law to threaten a man with hot oil.\"  [Illustration: PLATE I]  \"You may bring an action against me,\" said the executioner. \"Now, sir, if _you_ please. We are wasting time. The forefinger of your left hand, if I may trouble you. Thank you. I am obliged.\"  He took Arnold's left hand, and dipped the tip of the first finger into the oil.  \"Ow!\" cried Arnold, jumping.  \"Don't let him see he's hurting you,\" whispered Werner Stauffacher. \"Pretend you don't notice it.\"  Gessler leaned forward again.  \"Have your views on taxes changed at all?\" he asked. \"Do you see my point of view more clearly now?\"  Arnold admitted that he thought that, after all, there might be something to be said for it.  \"That's right,\" said the Governor. \"And the tax on sheep? You don't object to that?\"  \"No.\"  \"And the tax on cows?\"  \"I like it.\"  \"And those on bread, and buns, and lemonade?\"  \"I enjoy them.\"  \"Excellent. In fact, you're quite contented?\"  \"Quite.\"  \"And you think the rest of the people are?\"  \"Oh, quite, quite!\"  \"And do you think the same?\" he asked of Walter and Werner.  \"Oh _yes_, your Excellency!\" they cried.  \"Then _that's_ all right,\" said Gessler. \"I was sure you would be sensible about it. Now, if you will kindly place in the tambourine which the gentleman on my left is presenting to you a mere trifle to compensate us for our trouble in giving you an audience, and if you\" (to Arnold of Melchthal) \"will contribute an additional trifle for use of the Imperial boiling oil, I think we shall all be satisfied. You've done it? _That's_ right. Good-bye, and mind the step as you go out.\"  And, as he finished this speech, the three spokesmen of the people of Switzerland were shown out of the Hall of Audience.     CHAPTER II   They were met in the street outside by a large body of their fellow-citizens, who had accompanied them to the Palace, and who had been spending the time since their departure in listening by turns at the keyhole of the front-door. But as the Hall of Audience was at the other side of the Palace, and cut off from the front-door by two other doors, a flight of stairs, and a long passage, they had not heard very much of what had gone on inside, and they surrounded the three spokesmen as they came out, and questioned them eagerly.  \"Has he taken off the tax on jam?\" asked Ulric the smith.  \"What is he going to do about the tax on mixed biscuits?\" shouted Klaus von der Flue, who was a chimney-sweep of the town and loved mixed biscuits.  \"Never mind about tea and mixed biscuits!\" cried his neighbour, Meier of Sarnen. \"What I want to know is whether we shall have to pay for keeping sheep any more.\"  \"What _did_ the Governor say?\" asked Jost Weiler, a practical man, who liked to go straight to the point.  The three spokesmen looked at one another a little doubtfully.  \"We-e-ll,\" said Werner Stauffacher at last, \"as a matter of fact, he didn't actually _say_ very much. It was more what he _did_, if you understand me, than what he said.\"  \"I should describe His Excellency the Governor,\" said Walter Fürst, \"as a man who has got a"]]]
