We came presently to a house of moderate size, and rather antique fashion.  This, the old man informed me, was his present abode.  A servant, almost as old as his master, came to the door, and, giving his arm to my host, led him, for he was rather lame and otherwise infirm, across a small hall into a long low apartment.  I followed.  A miniature of Oliver Cromwell, placed over the chimney-piece, forcibly arrested my attention.  \"It is the only portrait of the Protector I ever saw,\" said I, \"which impresses on me the certainty of a likeness; that resolute gloomy brow,--that stubborn lip,--that heavy, yet not stolid expression,--all seem to warrant a resemblance to that singular and fortunate man, to whom folly appears to have been as great an instrument of success as wisdom, and who rose to the supreme power perhaps no less from a pitiable fanaticism than an admirable genius.  So true is it that great men often soar to their height by qualities the least obvious to the spectator, and (to stoop to a low comparison) resemble that animal* in which a common ligament supplies the place and possesses the property of wings.\"   * The flying squirrel.   The old man smiled very slightly as I made this remark.  \"If this be true,\" said he, with an impressive tone, \"though we may wonder less at the talents of the Protector, we must be more indulgent to his character, nor condemn him for insincerity when at heart he himself was deceived.\"  \"It is in that light,\" said I, \"that I have always viewed his conduct. And though myself, by prejudice, a Cavalier and a Tory, I own that Cromwell (hypocrite as he is esteemed) appears to me as much to have exceeded his royal antagonist and victim in the virtue of sincerity, as he did in the grandeur of his genius and the profound consistency of his ambition.\"  \"Sir,\" said my host, with a warmth that astonished me, \"you seem to have known that man, so justly do you judge him.  Yes,\" said he, after a pause, \"yes, perhaps no one ever so varnished to his own breast his designs; no one, so covetous of glory, was ever so duped by conscience; no one ever rose to such a height through so few acts that seemed to himself worthy of remorse.\"  At this part of our conversation, the servant, entering, announced dinner.  We adjourned to another room, and partook of a homely yet not uninviting repast.  When men are pleased with each other, conversation soon gets beyond the ordinary surfaces to talk; and an exchange of deeper opinions was speedily effected by what old Barnes* quaintly enough terms, \"The gentleman-usher of all knowledge,--Sermocination!\"   * In the \"Gerania.\"   It was a pretty, though small room, where we dined; and I observed that in this apartment, as in the other into which I had been at first ushered, there were several books scattered about, in that confusion and number which show that they have become to their owner both the choicest luxury and the least dispensable necessary.  So, during dinner-time, we talked principally upon books, and I observed that those which my host seemed to know the best were of the elegant and poetical order of philosophers, who, more fascinating than deep, preach up the blessings of a solitude which is useless, and a content which, deprived of passion, excitement, and energy, would, if it could ever exist, only be a dignified name for vegetation.  \"So,\" said he, \"when, the dinner being removed, we were left alone with that substitute for all society,--wine! \"so you are going to town: in four hours more you will be in that great focus of noise, falsehood, hollow joy, and real sorrow.  Do you know that I have become so wedded to the country that I cannot but consider all those who leave it for the turbulent city, in the same light, half wondering, half compassionating, as that in which the ancients regarded the hardy adventurers who left the safe land and their happy homes, voluntarily to expose themselves in a frail vessel to the dangers of an uncertain sea?  Here, when I look out on the green fields and the blue sky, the quiet herds basking in the sunshine or scattered over the unpolluted plains, I cannot but exclaim with Pliny, 'This is the true Movoetov!' this is the source whence flow inspiration to the mind and tranquillity to the heart!  And in my love of Nature--more confiding and constant than ever is the love we bear to women--I cry with the tender and sweet Tibullus,--             \"'Ego composito securus acervo      Despiciam dites, despiciamque famem.'\"*   * \"Satisfied with my little hoard, I can despise wealth, and fear not hunger.\"   \"These,\" said I, \"are the sentiments we all (perhaps the most restless of us the most passionately) at times experience.  But there is in our hearts some secret but irresistible principle that impels us, as a rolling circle, onward, onward, in the great orbit of our destiny; nor do we find a respite until the wheels on which we move are broken--at the tomb.\"  \"Yet,\" said my host, \"the internal principle you speak of can be arrested before the grave,--at least stilled and impeded.  You will smile incredulously, perhaps (for I see you do not know who I am), when I tell you that I might once have been a monarch, and that obscurity seemed to me more enviable than empire; I resigned the occasion: the tide of fortune rolled onward, and left me safe but solitary and forsaken upon the dry land.  If you wonder at my choice, you will wonder still more when I tell you that I have never repented it.\"  Greatly surprised, and even startled, I heard my host make this strange avowal.  \"Forgive me,\" said I, \"but you have powerfully excited my interest; dare I inquire from whose experience I am now deriving a lesson?\"  \"Not yet,\" said my host, smiling, \"not till our conversation is over, and you have bid the old anchorite adieu, in all probability forever: you will then know that you have conversed with a man, perhaps more universally neglected and contemned than any of his contemporaries. Yes,\" he continued, \"yes, I resigned power, and I got no praise for my moderation, but contempt for my folly; no human being would believe that I could have relinquished that treasure through a disregard for its possession which others would only have relinquished through an incapacity to retain it; and that which, had they seen it recorded in an ancient history, men would have regarded as the height of philosophy, they despised when acted under their eyes, as the extremest abasement of imbecility.  Yet I compare my lot with that of the great man whom I was expected to equal in ambition, and to whose grandeur I might have succeeded; and am convinced that in this retreat I am more to be envied than he in the plenitude of his power and the height of his renown; yet is not happiness the aim of wisdom? if my choice is happier than his, is it not wiser?\"  \"Alas,\" thought I, \"the wisest men seldom have the loftiest genius, and perhaps happiness is granted rather to mediocrity of mind than to mediocrity of circumstance;\" but I did not give so uncourteous a reply to my host an audible utterance; on the contrary, \"I do not doubt,\" said I, as I rose to depart, \"the wisdom of a choice which has brought you self-gratulation.  And it has been said by a man both great and good, a man to whose mind was open the lore of the closet and the experience of courts that, in wisdom or in folly, 'the only difference between one man and another, is whether a man governs his passions or his passions him.' According to this rule, which indeed is a classic and a golden aphorism, Alexander, on the throne of Persia, might have been an idiot to Diogenes in his tub.  And now, Sir, in wishing you farewell, let me again crave your indulgence to my curiosity.\"  \"Not yet, not yet,\" answered my host; and he led me once more into the other room.  While they were preparing my horse, we renewed our conversation.  To the best of my recollection, we talked about Plato; but I had now become so impatient to rejoin Isora that I did not accord to my worthy host the patient attention I had hitherto given him.  When I took leave of him he blessed me, and placed a piece of paper in my hand; \"Do not open this,\" said he, \"till you are at least two miles hence; your curiosity will then be satisfied.  If ever you travel this road again, or if ever you pass by Cheshunt, pause and see if the old philosopher is dead.  Adieu!\"  And so we parted.  You may be sure that I had not passed the appointed distance of two miles very far, when I opened the paper and read the following words:--   Perhaps, young stranger, at some future period of a life, which I venture to foretell will be adventurous and eventful, it may afford you a matter for reflection, or a resting-spot for a moral, to remember that you have seen, in old age and obscurity, the son of him who shook an empire, avenged a people, and obtained a throne, only to be the victim of his own passions and the dupe of his own reason.  I repeat now the question I before put to you,--Was the fate of the great Protector fairer than that of the despised and forgotten                         RICHARD CROMWELL?   \"So,\" thought I, \"it is indeed with the son of the greatest ruler England, or perhaps, in modern times, Europe has ever produced, that I have held this conversation upon content!  Yes, perhaps your fate is more to be envied than that of your illustrious father; but who /would/ envy it more?  Strange that while we pretend that happiness is the object of all desire, happiness is the last thing which we covet.  Love and wealth and pleasure and honour,--these are the roads which we take so long that, accustomed to the mere travel, we forget that it was first undertaken not for the course but the goal; and in the common infatuation which pervades all our race, we make"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7626"],["title","Devereux — Volume 03 (#8)"],["body","toil the meed, and in following the means forsake the end.\"  I never saw my host again; very shortly afterwards he died:* I and Fate, which had marked with so strong a separation the lives of the father and the son, united in that death--as its greatest, so its only universal blessing--the philosopher and the recluse with the warrior and the chief!   * Richard Cromwell died in 1712--ED.    CHAPTER V.  IN WHICH THE HERO SHOWS DECISION ON MORE POINTS THAN ONE.--MORE OF ISORA'S CHARACTER IS DEVELOPED.  To use the fine image in the \"Arcadia,\" it was \"when the sun, like a noble heart, began to show his greatest countenance in his lowest estate,\" that I arrived at Isora's door.  I had written to her once, to announce my uncle's death and the day of my return: but I had not mentioned in my letter my reverse of fortunes; I reserved that communication till it could be softened by our meeting.  I saw by the countenance of the servant who admitted me that all was well: so I asked no question; I flew up the stairs; I broke into Isora's chamber, and in an instant she was in my arms.  Ah, Love, Love! wherefore art thou so transitory a pilgrim on the earth,--an evening cloud which hovers on our horizon, drinking the hues of the sun, that grows ominously brighter as it verges to the shadow and the night, and which, the moment that sun is set, wanders on in darkness or descends in tears?  \"And now, my bird of Paradise,\" said I, as we sat alone in the apartment I had fitted up as the banqueting-room, and on which, though small in its proportions, I had lavished all the love of luxury and of show which made one of my most prevailing weaknesses, \"and now how has time passed with you since we parted?\"  \"Need you ask, Morton?  Ah, have you ever noted a poor dog deserted by its master, or rather not deserted, for that you know is not my case yet,\" added Isora, playfully, \"but left at home while the master went abroad? have you noted how restless the poor animal is; how it refuses all company and all comfort; how it goes a hundred times a day into the room which its master is wont mostly to inhabit; how it creeps on the sofa or the chair which the same absent idler was accustomed to press; how it selects some article of his very clothing, and curls jealously around it, and hides and watches over it as I have hid and watched over this glove, Morton?  Have you ever noted that humble creature whose whole happiness is the smile of one being, when the smile was away,--then, Morton, you can tell how my time has passed during your absence.\"  I answered Isora by endearments and by compliments.  She turned away from the latter.  \"Never call me those fine names, I implore you,\" she whispered; \"call me only by those pretty pet words by which I know you will never call any one else.  Bee and bird are my names, and mine only; but beauty and angel are names you have given or may give to a hundred others!  Promise me, then, to address me only in your own language.\"  \"I promise, and lo, the seal to the promise.  But tell me, Isora, do you not love these rare scents that make an Araby of this unmellowed clime? Do you not love the profusion of light which reflects so dazzling a lustre on that soft cheek; and those eyes which the ancient romancer* must have dreamed of when he wrote so prettily of \"eyes that seemed a temple where love and beauty were married\"?  Does not yon fruit take a more tempting hue, bedded as it is in those golden leaves?  Does not sleep seem to hover with a downier wing over those sofas on which the limbs of a princess have been laid?  In a word, is there not in luxury and in pomp a spell which no gentler or wiser mind would disdain?\"   * Sir Philip Sydney, who, if we may judge from the number of quotations from his works scattered in this book, seems to have been an especial favourite with Count Devereux.--ED.   \"It may be so!\" said Isora, sighing; \"but the splendour which surrounds us chills and almost terrifies me.  I think that every proof of your wealth and rank puts me further from you: then, too, I have some remembrance of the green sod, and the silver rill, and the trees upon which the young winds sing and play; and I own that it is with the country, and not the town, that all my ideas of luxury are wed.\"  \"But the numerous attendants, the long row of liveried hirelings, through which you may pass, as through a lane, the caparisoned steeds, the stately equipage, the jewelled tiara, the costly robe which matrons imitate and envy, the music, which lulls you to sleep, the lighted show, the gorgeous stage,--all these, the attributes or gifts of wealth, all these that you have the right to hope you will one day or other command, you will own are what you could very reluctantly forego.\"  \"Do you think so, Morton?  Ah, I wish you were of my humble temper: the more we limit and concentre happiness, the more certain, I think, we are of securing it; they who widen the circle encroach upon the boundaries of danger; and they who freight their wealth upon a hundred vessels are more liable, Morton, are they not? to the peril of the winds and the waves than they who venture it only upon one.\"  \"Admirably reasoned, my little sophist; but if the one ship sink?\"  \"Why, I would embark myself in it as well as my wealth, and should sink with it.\"  \"Well, well, Isora, your philosophy will, perhaps, soon be put to the test.  I will talk to you to-morrow of business.\"  \"And why not to-night?\"  \"To-night, when I have just returned!  No, to-night I will only talk to you of love!\"  As may be supposed, Isora was readily reconciled to my change of circumstances; and indeed that sum which seemed poverty to me appeared positive wealth to her.  But perhaps few men are by nature and inclination more luxurious and costly than myself; always accustomed to a profuse expenditure at my uncle's, I fell insensibly and /con amore/, on my /debut/ in London, into all the extravagances of the age.  Sir William, pleased rather than discontented with my habits, especially as they were attended with some /eclat/, pressed upon me proofs of his generosity which, since I knew his wealth and considered myself his heir, I did not scruple to accept, and at the time of my return to London after his death, I had not only spent to the full the princely allowance I had received from him, but was above half my whole fortune in debt.  However, I had horses and equipages, jewels and plate, and I did not long wrestle with my pride before I obtained the victory, and sent all my valuables to the hammer.  They sold pretty well, all things considered, for I had a certain reputation in the world for taste and munificence; and when I had received the product and paid my debts, I found that the whole balance in my favour, including, of course, my uncle's legacy, was fifteen thousand pounds.  It was no bad younger brother's portion, perhaps, but I was in no humour to be made a younger brother without a struggle.  So I went to the lawyers; they looked at the will, considered the case, and took their fees.  Then the honestest of them, with the coolest air in the world, told me to content myself with my legacy, for the cause was hopeless; the will was sufficient to exclude a wilderness of elder sons.  I need not add that I left this lawyer with a very contemptible opinion of his understanding.  I went to another, he told me the same thing, only in a different manner, and I thought him as great a fool as his fellow practitioner.  At last I chanced upon a little brisk gentleman, with a quick eye and a sharp voice, who wore a wig that carried conviction in every curl; had an independent, upright mien, and such a logical, emphatic way of expressing himself, that I was quite charmed with him. This gentleman scarce heard me out before he assured me that I had a famous case of it, that he liked making quick work, and proceeding with vigour, that he hated rogues, and delay, which was the sign of a rogue, but not the necessary sign of law, that I was the most fortunate man imaginable in coming to him, and, in short that I had nothing to do but commence proceedings, and leave all the rest to him.  I was very soon talked into this proposal, and very soon embarked in the luxurious ocean of litigation.  Having settled this business so satisfactorily, I went to receive the condolence and sympathy of St. John.  Notwithstanding the arduous occupations both of pleasure and of power, in which he was constantly engaged, he had found time to call upon me very often, and to express by letter great disappointment that I had neither received nor returned his visits.  Touched by the phenomenon of so much kindness in a statesman, I paid him in return the only compliment in my power; namely, I asked his advice, with a view of taking it.  \"Politics--politics, my dear Count,\" said he in answer to that request, \"nothing like it; I will get you a seat in the House by next week,--you are just of age, I think,--Heavens! a man like you who has learning enough for a German professor; assurance that would almost abash a Milesian; a very pretty choice of words, and a pointed way of consummating a jest,--why, with you by my side, my dear Count, I will soon--\"  \"St. John,\" said I, interrupting him, \"you forget I am a Catholic!\"  \"Ah, I did forget that,\" replied St. John, slowly.  \"Heaven help me, Count, but I am sorry your ancestors were not converted; it was a pity they should bequeath you their religion without the estate to support it, for papacy has become a terrible tax to its followers.\"  \"I wonder,\" said I, \"whether the earth will ever be governed by Christians, not cavillers; by followers of our Saviour, not by co-operators of the devil; by men who obey the former, and 'love one another,' not by men who walk about with the latter (that roaring lion), 'seeking whom they may devour.'
