Range. _s._ A sieve.  To Rangle. _v. n._ To twine, or move in an irregular or sinuous manner. _Rangling plants_ are plants which entwine round other plants, as the woodbine, hops, etc.  Ran'gle. _s._ A sinuous winding.  Ras'ty. _adj._ Rancid: gross; obscene.  Rathe-ripe. _adj._ Ripening early. _Rath. English Dictionary:_   \"The rathe-ripe wits prevent their own perfection.\"   BP. HALL.  Raught. _part._ Reached.  Rawd. _part._ Rode.  To Rawn. _v. a._ To devour greedily.  Raw'ny. _adj._ Having little flesh: a thin person, whose bones are conspicuous, is said to be rawny.  To Ray. _v. a._ To dress.  To Read. _v. a._ To strip the fat from the intestines; _to read the inward_.  Read'ship. _s._ Confidence, trust, truth.  To Ream. _v. a._ To widen; to open.  Reamer. _s._ An instrument used to make a hole larger.  Re'balling. _s._ The catching of eels with earthworms attached to a ball of lead, hung by a string from a pole.  Reed. _s._ Wheat straw prepared for thatching.  Reen, Rhine. _s._ A water-course: an open drain.  To Reeve. _v. a._ To rivel; to draw into wrinkles.  Rem'let. _s._ A remnant.  Rev'el. _s._ A wake.  To Rig. _v. n._ To climb about; to get up and down a thing in wantonness or sport.  Hence the substantive _rig_, as used in _John Gilpin_, by COWPER.   \"He little dreamt of running such a _rig_.\"  To Rig. _v. a._ To dress.  Hence, I suspect, the origin of the _rigging_ of a vessel.   Righting-lawn. Adjusting the ridges after the wheat is sown.  Rip. _s._ A vulgar, old, unchaste woman. Hence, most probably, the origin of _Demirip_.  Robin-Riddick. _s._ A redbreast. [Also _Rabbin Hirddick_; the r and i transposed.]  Rode. _s._ _To go to rode_, means, late at night or early in the morning, to go out to shoot wild fowl which pass over head on the wing.  To Rose. _v. n._ To drop out from the pod, or other seed vessel, when the seeds are over-ripe.  To Rough. _v. a._ To roughen; to make rough.  Round-dock. _s._ The common mallow; _malva sylvestris_.  Called round-dock from the _roundness_ of its leaves. CHAUCER has the following expression which has a good deal puzzled the glossarists:   \"But canst thou playin raket to and fro,  _Nettle in, Docke out_, now this, now that, Pandare?\"   _Troilus and Cressida_, Book IV.  The round-dock leaves are used at this day as a supposed remedy or charm for the sting of a nettle, by being rubbed on the stung part, with the following words:--   _In dock, out nettle,  Nettle have a sting'd me_.  That is, _Go in dock, go out nettle_. Now, to play _Nettle in Docke out_, is to make use of such expedients as shall drive away or remove some previous evil, similar to that of driving out the venom of the nettle by the juice or charm of the dock.

This word ought to be in our English Dictionaries.  Rungs. _s. pl._ The round steps of a ladder.     S.   The sound of S is very often converted into the sound of Z. Thus many of the following words, _Sand-tot, Sar, Seed-lip, Silker, Sim, &c._, are often pronounced _Zand-tot, Zar, Zeeäd-lip, Zilker, Zim, &c._   Sâ'cer-eyes. Very large and prominent eyes.

Poor and mean, like scrawf.  Screed. _s_. A shred.  To Scrunch. _v. a._ and _v. n._ The act of crushing and bringing closer together is implied, accompanied with some kind of noise. A person may be said to scrunch an apple or a biscuit, if in eating it he made a noise; so a pig in eating acorns. Mr. SOUTHEY has used the word in _Thalaba_ without the s.   \"No sound but the wild, wild wind,  \"And the snow _crunching_ under his feet.\"  And, again, in the _Anthology_, vol 2, p. 240.   \"Grunting as they _crunch'd_ the mast.\"  Scud. _s_. A scab.  Sea-Bottle. _s_. Many of the species of the sea-wrack, or _fucus_, are called sea-bottles, in consequence of the stalks having round or oval vesicles or pods in them; the pod itself.

Applied to brutes only.  Shab-water. _s._ A. water prepared with tobacco, and some mercurial, to cure the shab.  Shabby. _adv._ Affected with the shab. Hence the origin of the common word _shabby_, mean, paltry.  Shackle. _s._ A twisted band. Shal'der. _s._ A kind of broad flat rush, growing in ditches.  Sharp. _s._ A shaft of a waggon, &c.  Shatt'n. Shalt not.  Sheer. _s._ A sheath.  Shil'lith. _s._ A shilling's worth.  Shine. _s._ Every _shine o'm_, is, every one of them.  To Shod. _v. a._ To shed: to spill.  Sholl. _v._ Shall.

This _may-game_ is played upon some other occasion besides the one here mentioned: it occurs, however, very rarely, and will soon, I apprehend, be quite obsolete. _See_ SKIMMINGTON, in _Johnson_.  Skiv'er. _s._ A skewer.  To Skram. _v. a._ To benumb with cold.  Skram. _adj._ Awkward: stiff, as if benumbed.   \"With hondis al _forskramyd_.\"   CHAUCER, _Second Merchant's Tale_.

Utch'y. _pron._ I. This word is not used in the Western or Eastern, but only in the Southern parts of the County of Somerset. It is, manifestly, a corrupt pronunciation of _Ich_, or _Ichč_, pronounced as two syllables, the Anglo-Saxon word for I. _What shall utchy do?_ What shall I do.  I think Chaucer sometimes uses _iche_ as a dissyllable; _vide_ his Poems _passim_. _Ch'am_, is I am, that is, _ich am_; _ch'ill_, is I will, _ich will_. See Shakespeare's King Lear, Act IV., Scene IV. What is very remarkable, and which confirms me greatly in the opinion which I here state, upon examining the first folio edition of Shakespeare, at the London Institution, I find that _ch_ is printed, in one instance, with a mark of elision before it thus, _'ch_, a proof that the _i_ in _iche_ was sometimes dropped in a common and rapid pronunciation. In short, this mark of elision ought always so to have been printed, which would, most probably, have prevented the conjectures which have been hazarded upon the origin of the mean- of such words _chudd_, _chill_, and _cham_. It is singular enough that Shakespeare has the _ch_ for _iche_ I, and _Ise_ for I, within the distance of a few lines in the passage above alluded to, in King Lear. But, perhaps, not more singular than that in Somersetshire may, at the present time, be heard for the pronoun I, _Utchy_, or _iché_, and _Ise_. In the Western parts of Somersetshire, as well as in Devonshire, _Ise_ is now used very generally for I. The Germans of the present day pronounce, I understand, their _ich_ sometimes as it is pronounced in the West, _Ise_, which is the sound"]]]
