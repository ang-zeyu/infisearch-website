There, alone in that gray vault, and by the sepulchral light of the single lamp, I read what follows:--   THE HERMIT'S MANUSCRIPT.  Morton Devereux, if ever this reach you, read it, shudder, and, whatever your afflictions, bless God that you are not as I am.  Do you remember my prevailing characteristic as a boy?  No, you do not.  You will say \"devotion!\"  It was not!  \"Gentleness.\"  It was not: it was JEALOUSY! Now does the truth flash on you?  Yes, that was the disease that was in my blood, and in my heart, and through whose ghastly medium every living object was beheld.  Did I love you?  Yes, I loved you,--ay, almost with a love equal to your own.  I loved my mother; I loved Gerald; I loved Montreuil.  It was a part of my nature to love, and I did not resist the impulse.  You I loved better than all; but I was jealous of each.  If my mother caressed you or Gerald, if you opened your heart to either, it stung me to the quick.  I it was who said to my mother, \"Caress him not, or I shall think you love him better than me.\"  I it was who widened, from my veriest childhood, the breach between Gerald and yourself.  I it was who gave to the childish reproach a venom, and to the childish quarrel a barb.  Was this love?  Yes, it was love; but I could not endure that ye should love one another as ye loved me.  It delighted me when one confided to my ear a complaint against the other, and said, \"Aubrey, this blow could not have come from thee!\"  Montreuil early perceived my bias of temper: he might have corrected it and with ease.  I was not evil in disposition; I was insensible of my own vice.  Had its malignity been revealed to me, I should have recoiled in horror.  Montreuil had a vast power over me; he could mould me at his will.  Montreuil, I repeat, might have saved me, and thyself, and a third being, better and purer than either of us was, even in our cradles.  Montreuil did not: he had an object to serve, and he sacrificed our whole house to it.  He found me one day weeping over a dog that I had killed.  \"Why did you destroy it?\" he said; and I answered, \"Because it loved Morton better than me!\"  And the priest said, \"Thou didst right, Aubrey!\"  Yes, from that time he took advantage of my infirmity, and could rouse or calm all my passions in proportion as he irritated or soothed it.  You know this man's object during the latter period of his residence with us: it was the restoration of the House of Stuart.  He was alternately the spy and the agitator in that cause.  Among more comprehensive plans for effecting this object, was that of securing the heirs to the great wealth and popular name of Sir William Devereux. This was only a minor mesh in the intricate web of his schemes; but it is the character of the man to take exactly the same pains, and pursue the same laborious intrigues, for a small object as for a great one. His first impression, on entering our house, was in favour of Gerald; and I believe he really likes him to this day better than either of us. Partly your sarcasms, partly Gerald's disputes with you, partly my representations,--for I was jealous even of the love of Montreuil,--prepossessed him against you.  He thought, too, that Gerald had more talent to serve his purposes than yourself and more facility in being moulded to them; and he believed our uncle's partiality to you far from being unalienable.  I have said that, at the latter period of his residence with us, he was an agent of the exiled cause.  At the time I /now/ speak of, he had not entered into the great political scheme which engrossed him afterwards.  He was merely a restless and aspiring priest, whose whole hope, object, ambition, was the advancement of his order. He knew that whoever inherited, or whoever shared, my uncle's wealth, could, under legitimate regulation, promote /any/ end which the heads of that order might select; and he wished therefore to gain the mastery over us all.  Intrigue was essentially woven with his genius, and by intrigue only did he ever seek to arrive at /any/ end he had in view.* He soon obtained a mysterious and pervading power over Gerald and myself.  Your temper at once irritated him, and made him despair of obtaining an ascendant over one who, though he testified in childhood none of the talents for which he has since been noted, testified, nevertheless, a shrewd, penetrating, and sarcastic power of observation and detection.  You, therefore, he resolved to leave to the irregularities of your own nature, confident that they would yield him the opportunity of detaching your uncle from you and ultimately securing to Gerald his estates.   * It will be observed that Aubrey frequently repeats former assertions; this is one of the most customary traits of insanity.--ED.   The trial at school first altered his intentions.  He imagined that he then saw in you powers which might be rendered availing to him: he conquered his pride--a great feature in his character--and he resolved to seek your affection.  Your subsequent regularity of habits and success in study confirmed him in his resolution; and when he learned from my uncle's own lips that the Devereux estates would devolve on you, he thought that it would be easier to secure your affection to him than to divert that affection which my uncle had conceived for you.  At this time, I repeat, he had no particular object in view; none, at least, beyond that of obtaining for the interest of his order the direction of great wealth and some political influence.  Some time after--I know not exactly when, but before we returned to take our permanent abode at Devereux Court--a share in the grand political intrigue which was then in so many branches carried on throughout England, and even Europe, was confided to Montreuil.  In this I believe he was the servant of his order, rather than immediately of the exiled House; and I have since heard that even at that day he had acquired a great reputation among the professors of the former. You, Morton, he decoyed not into this scheme before he left England: he had not acquired a sufficient influence over you to trust you with the disclosure.  To Gerald and myself he was more confidential. Gerald eagerly embraced his projects through a spirit of enterprise; I through a spirit of awe and of religion.  RELIGION!  Yes,--then,--long after,--now,--when my heart was and is the home of all withering and evil passions, Religion reigned,--reigns, over me a despot and a tyrant. Its terrors haunt me at this hour; they people the earth and the air with shapes of ghastly menace!  They--Heaven pardon me! what would my madness utter?  Madness?--madness?  Ay, /that/ is the real scourge, the real fire, the real torture, the real hell, of this fair earth!  Montreuil, then, by different pleas, won over Gerald and myself.  He left us, but engaged us in constant correspondence.  \"Aubrey,\" he said, before he departed, and when he saw that I was wounded by his apparent cordiality towards you and Gerald--\"Aubrey,\" he said, soothing me on this point, \"think not that I trust Gerald or the arrogant Morton as I trust you.  /You/ have my real heart and my real trust.  It is necessary to the execution of this project, so important to the interests of religion and so agreeable to the will of Heaven, that we should secure all co-operators: but they, your brothers, Aubrey, are the tools of that mighty design; you are its friend.\"  Thus it was that, at all times when he irritated too sorely the vice of my nature, he flattered it into seconding his views; and thus, instead of conquering my evil passions, he conquered by them.  Curses--No, no, no!--I /will/ be calm.  We returned to Devereux Court, and we grew from boyhood into youth.  I loved you then, Morton.  Ah! what would I not give now for one pure feeling, such as I felt in your love?  Do you remember the day on which you had extorted from my uncle his consent to your leaving us for the pleasures and pomps of London?  Do you remember the evening of that day, when I came to seek you, and we sat down on a little mound, and talked over your projects, and you spoke then to me of my devotion and my purer and colder feelings?  Morton, at that very moment my veins burned with passion!--at that very moment my heart was feeding the vulture fated to live and prey within it forever!  Thrice did I resolve to confide in you, as we then sat together, and thrice did my evil genius forbid it. You seemed, even in your affection to me, so wholly engrossed with your own hopes; you seemed so little to regret leaving me; you stung, so often and so deeply, in our short conference, that feeling which made me desire to monopolize all things in those I loved, that I said inly,--\"Why should I bare my heart to one who can so little understand it?\" And so we turned home, and you dreamed not of that which was then within me, and which was destined to be your curse and mine.  Not many weeks previous to that night, I had seen one whom to see was to love!  Love!--I tell you, Morton, that /that/ word is expressive of soft and fond emotion, and there should be another expressive of all that is fierce and dark and unrelenting m the human heart!--all that seems most like the deadliest and the blackest hate, and yet is not hate!  I saw this being, and from that moment my real nature, which had slept hitherto, awoke!  I remember well it was one evening in the beginning of summer that I first saw her.  She sat alore in the little garden beside the cottage door, and I paused, and, unseen, looked over the slight fence that separated us, and fed my eyes with a loveliness that I thought till then only twilight or the stars could wear!  From that evening I came, night after night, to watch her from the same spot; and every time I beheld her the poison entered deeper and deeper into my system.  At length I had an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7629"],["title","Devereux â€” Volume 06 (#7)"],["body","of being known to her, of speaking to her, of hearing her speak, of touching the ground she had hallowed, of entering the home where she dwelt!  I must explain: I said that both Gerald and myself corresponded privately with Montreuil; we were both bound over to secrecy with regard to you; and this, my temper and Gerald's coolness with you rendered an easy obligation to both;--I say my temper, for I loved to think I had a secret not known to another; and I carried this reserve even to the degree of concealing from Gerald himself the greater part of the correspondence between me and the Abbe.  In his correspondence with each of us, Montreuil acted with his usual skill; to Gerald, as the elder in years, the more prone to enterprise, and the manlier in aspect and in character, was allotted whatever object was of real trust or importance. Gerald it was who, under pretence of pursuing his accustomed sports, conferred with the various agents of intrigue who from time to time visited our coast; and to me the Abbe gave words of endearment and affected the language of more entire trust.  \"Whatever,\" he would say, \"in our present half mellowed projects, is exposed to danger, but does not promise reward, I entrust to Gerald; hereafter, far higher employment, under far safer and surer auspices, will be yours.  We are the heads: be ours the nobler occupation to plan; and let us leave to inferior natures the vain and perilous triumph to execute what we design.\"  All this I readily assented to; for, despite my acquiescence in Montreuil's wishes, I loved not enterprise, or rather I hated whatever roused me from the dreamy and abstracted indolence which was most dear to my temperament.  Sometimes, however, with a great show of confidence, Montreuil would request me to execute some quiet and unimportant commission; and of this nature was one I received while I was thus, unknown even to the object, steeping my soul in the first intoxication of love.  The plots then carried on by certain ecclesiastics I need not say extended, in one linked chain, over the greater part of the Continent.  Spain, in especial, was the theatre of these intrigues; and among the tools employed in executing them were some who, though banished from that country, still, by the rank they had held in it, carried a certain importance in their very names.  Foremost of these was the father of the woman I loved; and foremost, in whatever promised occupation to a restless mind, he was always certain to be.  Montreuil now commissioned me to seek out a certain Barnard (an underling in those secret practices or services, for which he afterwards suffered, and who was then in that part of the country), and to communicate to him some messages of which he was to be the bearer to this Spaniard.  A thought flashed upon me--Montreuil's letter mentioned, accidentally, that the Spaniard had never hitherto seen Barnard: could I not personate the latter, deliver the messages myself, and thus win that introduction to the daughter which I so burningly desired, and which, from the close reserve of the father's habits, I might not otherwise effect?  The plan was open to two objections: one, that I was known personally in the town in the environs of which the Spaniard lived, and he might therefore very soon discover who I really was; the other that I was not in possession of all the information which Barnard might possess, and which the Spaniard might wish to learn; but these objections had not much weight with me.  To the first, I said inly, \"I will oppose the most constant caution; I will go always on foot and alone; I will never be seen in the town itself; and even should the Spaniard, who seems rarely to stir abroad, and who, possibly, does not speak our language,--even should he learn by accident that Barnard is only another name for Aubrey Devereux, it will not be before I have gained my object; nor, perhaps, before the time when I myself may wish to acknowledge my identity.\"  To the second objection I saw a yet more ready answer.  \"I will acquaint Montreuil at once,\" I said, \"with my intention; I will claim his connivance as a proof of his confidence, and as an essay of my own genius of intrigue.\"  I did so; the priest, perhaps delighted to involve me so deeply, and to find me so ardent in his project, consented.  Fortunately, as I before said, Barnard was an underling,--young, unknown, and obscure.  My youth, therefore, was not so great a foe to my assumed disguise as it might otherwise have been. Montreuil supplied all requisite information.  I tried (for the first time, with a beating heart and a tremulous voice) the imposition! it succeeded; I continued it.  Yes, Morton, yes!--pour forth upon me your bitterest execration, in me, in your brother, in the brother so dear to you,--in the brother whom you imagined so passionless, so pure; so sinless,--behold that Barnard, the lover, the idolatrous lover--the foe, the deadly foe,--of Isora d'Alvarez!   Here the manuscript was defaced for some pages by incoherent and meaningless ravings.  It seemed as if one of his dark fits of frenzy had at that time come over the writer.  At length, in a more firm and clear character than that immediately preceding it, the manuscript continued as follows:--   I loved her, but even then it was with a fierce and ominous love (ominous of what it became).  Often in the still evenings, when we stood together watching the sun set; when my tongue trembled, but did not dare to speak; when all soft and sweet thoughts filled the heart and glistened in the eye of that most sensitive and fairy being; when my own brow perhaps seemed to reflect the same emotions,--feelings which I even shuddered to conceive raged within me.  Had we stood together in those moments upon the brink of a precipice, I could have wound my arms around her and leaped with her into the abyss.  Everything but one nursed my passion; nature, solitude, early dreams, all kindled and fed that fire: Religion only combated it; I knew it was a crime to love any of earth's creatures as I loved.  I used the scourge and the fast;* I wept hot, burning tears; I prayed, and the intensity of my prayer appalled even myself, as it rose from my maddened heart, in the depth and stillness of the lone night: but the flame burned higher and more scorchingly from the opposition; nay, it was the very knowledge that my love was criminal that made it assume so fearful and dark a shape.  \"Thou art the cause of my downfall from Heaven!\" I muttered, when I looked upon Isora's calm face: \"thou feelest it not, and I could destroy thee and myself,--myself the criminal, thee the cause of the crime!\"   * I need not point out to the novel-reader how completely the character of Aubrey has been stolen in a certain celebrated French romance.  But the writer I allude to is not so unmerciful as M. de Balzac, who has pillaged scenes in \"The Disowned\" with a most gratifying politeness.   It must have been that my eyes betrayed my feelings that Isora loved me not, that she shrank from me even at the first: why else should I not have called forth the same sentiments which she gave to you?  Was not my form cast in a mould as fair as yours? did not my voice whisper in as sweet a tone? did I not love her with as wild a love?  Why should she not have loved me?  I was the first whom she behold: she would--ay, perhaps she would have loved me, if you had not come and marred all. Curse yourself, then, that you were my rival! curse yourself that you made my heart as a furnace, and smote my brain with frenzy; curse--O sweet Virgin, forgive me!--I know not,--I know not what my tongue utters or my hand traces!  You came, then, Morton, you came; you knew her; you loved her; she loved you.  I learned that you had gained admittance to the cottage, and the moment I learned it, I looked on Isora, and felt my fate, as by intuition: I saw at once that she was prepared to love you; I saw the very moment when that love kindled from conception into form; I saw--and at that moment my eyes reeled and my ears rang as with the sound of a rushing sea, and I thought I felt a cord snap within my brain, which has never been united again.  Once only, after your introduction to the cottage, did I think of confiding to you my love and rivalship; you remember one night when we met by the castle cave, and when your kindness touched and softened me despite of myself.  The day after that night I sought you, with the intention of communicating to you all; and while I was yet struggling with my embarrassment and the suffocating tide of my emotions, you premeditated me by giving me /your/ confidence.  Engrossed by your own feelings, you were not observant of mine; and as you dwelt and dilated upon your love for Isora, all emotions, save those of agony and of fury, vanished from my breast.  I did not answer you then at any length, for I was too agitated to trust to prolix speech; but by the next day I had recovered myself, and I resolved, as far as I was able, to play the hypocrite.  \"he cannot love her as I do!\" I said; \"perhaps I may, without disclosure of my rivalship and without sin in the attempt, detach him from her by reason.\"  Fraught with this idea, I collected myself, sought you, remonstrated with you, represented the worldly folly of your love, and uttered all that prudence preaches--in vain, when it preaches against passion!  Let me be brief.  I saw that I made no impression on you; I stifled my wrath; I continued to visit and watch Isora.  I timed my opportunities well: my constant knowledge of your motions allowed me to do that; besides, I represented to the Spaniard the necessity, through political motives, of concealing myself from you; hence, we never encountered each other.  One evening, Alvarez had gone out to meet one of his countrymen and confederates.  I found Isora alone, in the most sequestered part of the garden; her loveliness, and her exceeding gentleness of manner, melted me.  For"]]]
