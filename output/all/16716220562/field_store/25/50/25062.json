He used to get up with the sun and work in the Garden or mow the lawn until it was time to go to work. He was a very good bowler and traveled to cities in the area to bowl for money. I recall one time when he won $100 in Auburn. One time he and Leon went with a team to bowl in the national tournament in Chicago. When he married again I moved out of the house and rented a room on South Main Street, staying there about a year before moving to another place just below Clark Street on Main. I also lived there about a year.  There was a diner next to where I was living--one of those diners made from an old trolley car--and I ate my meals there for two years. I got to know them so well that I would just walk in the diner, tell them I wanted dinner, and they would fix me a plate. I never did know what I would be getting until it was in front of me. On the nights I was going to square dances I would tell them to give me fried foods so the alcohol would not give me too much of a hangover. The food was good and they gave you a lot of it. In the winter I remember the windows being all frosted over and you couldn't see in or out.  I rented a garage just around the corner on Clark Street where I kept my car. One night after going to a Saturday night dance, I put the car in the garage. The next morning when I went to get it I noticed it had a flat tire. The garage floor was dirt and the wheels were down in hollows. The snow had melted off the car and all four wheels were frozen in the ice in the hollows. It was such a narrow garage I had to back the car out to change the tire. It was frozen so solid I had to get the jack out and put it from the bumper to the front of the garage and jack it backwards to get it loose. Not too easy when you have a hangover! Sundays I would get together with a couple of friends and we would ride to Bristol or around the lake and go to a movie in the evening. We were riding around the lake and parked somewhere up the East Lake Road on December 7, 1941 when we heard on the radio that Pearl Harbor had been attacked.  Sometime during 1941 I went to Rochester to find another car and found a 1936 Pontiac that looked almost new for $450. My old car was using a lot of oil and I had it parked in front of the used car lot. When the dealer was checking out my car for trade in value, I was hoping he would not start it up because when you did so the smoke was so thick you'd hardly see the car! I was lucky and made a deal. I had to drive back to Canandaigua for the money and once again to Rochester to close the deal. Just on that one trip I had to add four quarts of oil. Good thing it lasted the trip as the Pontiac was a real nice car.  In the fall of 1941 we had very little work and it was time for me to find work somewhere else. I had been called by Uncle Sam, had my physical and reported to the draft board. I was classified 4-F due to flat feet and a hernia (which I still have and was never bothered by). I wanted to be in service somewhere and so I went to Rochester and tried to join the Marines or the Navy. I even tried to get into the ambulance corps. With my 4-F status I couldn't get into anything. I borrowed $10 from my father and applied at about ten places in Rochester. This was the only time in my life that I borrowed money except for when I bought a car or house.  During this time some of my friends were entering the service. This was between Pearl Harbor and April of 1942. Pete Lenzi decided to hitch-hike to California and, if he couldn't find work, to join the Marines. He took one suitcase and I gave him a ride as far as Avon, letting him out at the statue in the center of the village. I'll write more about Pete later. Ken Montanye entered the army and we had a big party for him at the camp in Berby Hollow. Len Pierce also joined up about a month before I did.  In December of 1941 I got a reply from my application at Kodak and went in for an interview. I got a job at Kodak Park and was one of the first three hired for a new product. Ray Smith was hired soon after I was. The whole building where we worked was empty except for the three of us and a boss. Kodacolor film was being put on the market and the building was being set up for developing and printing. The first few weeks I spent polishing the reclaiming tanks on the ground floor. After the first month I had fourteen men working under me so it was a good opportunity for me. If I hadn't been drafted then, there is no telling how far I might have gone. When the film started coming in Ray Smith was working on the floor above me and I was in charge of the basement. By March things were really busy, and then, even though I was 4-F, they called me for the draft. I was glad to go, but now realize what a great opportunity I missed.  When I started working at Kodak, Ray Smith and I with another friend, Kippy Oskamp, who also worked in Rochester, rented an apartment on Alexander Street across from the Genesee Hospital. During the week I parked my car in a large old building in the area and they took the cars up an elevator to the top floors. It used to be an old flour mill and every Friday night I would get the car to go home for the weekend. It would be almost totally white from the remains of the flour in the building so I had to wash the car every weekend. We rode the bus to and from Kodak daily. We had to go up a stairway inside the apartment and were to be very quiet. One night some of the boys from home had a party. When they left we carried out a large bag of bottles and cans, the bottom gave out at about the top step and the entire contents clattered down the stairwell at two a.m. Needless to say, we were asked to move soon there after.  Kip Oskamp went into the Air Force ( a bombardier, I believe and his plane went down in the Japanese war...he was missing in action) so Ray Smith and I rented a room in a house on a small street in Greece NY which was nearer to Kodak. The owners name was Riley and now they live in the same trailer park in Florida as Ray. We worked different shifts so when we worked the noon to 8 pm shift we couldn't go downtown after work as the buses didn't run after 10 pm so we couldn't see any movies. We spent a lot of time sleeping. My car was still over by Alexander Street and I only got it on weekends. I remember standing out on the corner during the winter in a blizzard waiting for a bus to go to work. It was snowing so hard you couldn't see the bus until it was 20 feet away. I ate at the cafeteria at work and on the way home I would stop at the White Tower to get a bowl of soup.  The houses on Shady Lane were all the same and one night after midnight Ray Smith came home and went in the side door. The bathroom was just inside and there he was sitting on the john with the door open. You can imagine his embarrassment when the stranger indicated he was in the wrong house. It was a wonder the owner didn't shoot him as a burglar. I guess they changed the lock after finding out that the keys fit both houses.  At this time I was making $26 a week, renting a room, making car payments, and had enough left to run around with on weekends. It was in March or April that I received my draft notice. The day I left Rochester it snowed two feet and I had to shovel snow for hours to get my car out. I drove to Canandaigua and left all of my things with my father. I left the car with a friend who worked at a gas station down by the lake and he stored it in his barn. I owed some on it but they couldn't collect from you while you were in the service. After I was in the army about a year, I wrote to him and told him to let it go back to the finance company. I don't know why I didn't keep it or at least let someone in the family finish the payments. It was a very good Pontiac and I didn't owe more than a couple hundred dollars on it. In the service you soon got the feeling that your chances of living through the war were pretty slim.   Chapter 5 In Training  I entered the service on April 15, 1942. We left early in the morning from the railroad depot in Canandaigua for Rochester where we went through the induction center on State Street. From there we left for Ft. Niagara near Buffalo. It was still cold weather and they drilled us on the parade grounds in heavy army overcoats. One day I had a terrible headache and every step I took marching made it hurt more. They asked for volunteers to take a test for the Air Corps so I volunteered just to got out of marching. I had such a headache that I didn't think I did very well on the test. If I hadn't had that headache my war years would have been entirely different.  The first three or four days I wondered what I had gotten myself into and would have given anything to have been able to have gotten out. That soon passed and the rest of the time I wouldn't have missed the experience for anything. We were only at Ft. Niagara for about a week before being sent by train to Fort Bragg in North Carolina. This is where we were to take a 13 week training in field artillery. We trained for the 105 gun which was medium size, the shell being about five inches in diameter and about eighteen inches long. We would haul it around on a truck and set it up at a gun emplacement. The first time we shot it there were several officers there and the target was on a hillside about a quarter mile away. We fired the gun and watched for the hit. Nothing happened and we just stood waiting. We never did find out where it went. After the officers left we had a good laugh!  The land there was red sand and the trees mostly pine. It was very hot and muggy as we were there in June, July and August. We wore one piece coveralls and every time we got back to the barracks we would step in the shower with our clothes on and would dry off in about 10 minutes. We had to got up at 5:30 am and pick up all the cigarette butts and papers on the grounds before breakfast. This was loads "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7190"],["title","The Biography of a Rabbit (#8)"],["body","fun when it was raining... We spent most of our time in marching drills, rifle range, obstacle course and 1earning., about the big gun. The drill sergeants were mean, miserable and yelled at us all the time. They yelled at me continually for being out of step while marching. I couldn't figure out why because I was always in step. After 13 weeks, I could have easily killed both of them.  The obstacle course was about a mile long through woods, gullies and across water. I had such a competitive spirit that I would run the whole route and try to finish first. Some guys would walk, take short cuts and really goof off. It didn't seem to make any difference how you did it, but I still ran all the way.  The food was not too good and I especially remember when they served spare ribs. We sat seven to a table and if the bowl started at the other end of the table by the time it got to the last person there would only be bones 1eft. The PX did a big business selling candy bars in the  evenings. I remember one time my stepmother sent me a package of goodies. She put in some pickled seckle pears and just wrapped them in wax paper. The entire package was a squashed mess smelling of vinegar.  We were not allowed off the base during this period. When we had Saturday afternoon and Sunday off we wrote 1etters home did laundry and rested. I finally had time to make friends, especially with the men in my barracks. There was one man from Canandaigua and several from Buffalo, Syracuse and western New York. You can make good friends in a short time when you are that far from home. Ray Smith was in the Army too and I kept in touch with him even though we moved around a lot. We used to write gooey love letters to each other saying how much we missed each other. I took pictures and the ones that were so black they were nearly blank I sent to him \"with love\" It is a good thing no one saw those letters or they surely would have thought we were gay. (It is interesting that I never did run into any of that type in the service) There were all types of men in this outfit and they were from all over the east coast. Some couldn't read or write and one was straight out of the Kentucky backwoods. It made you wonder how they were taken into the service. There was one, Cliff Boll, who could neither read nor write so he got several of us to write his letters to his girlfriend. He was a real character so we wrote torrid love letters and included all the fantastic things he was doing. When he got a letter from her, we would all gather around and read it to him. I often wonder what happened when he went home on leave. I was accustomed to writing a lot of letters an I wrote to my dad, four sisters and three brothers. I also wrote to Duke and Mabel Montanye and Mabel's letters back were the longest of any I received. She would write about everyone in Cheshire, especially the Bunnell boys, who were always getting into trouble. Their barn burnt down, the house burnt down, the tractor tipped over and they would wreck cars. When I read her letters, all the guys in the barracks would gather round and I would read them aloud. Just like a serial on TV. Mabel wrote long letters in such a delicate hand that it must have taken her forever, but she wrote every month.  Marion Bunnell was in the service and he was home on leave when he ran into a wooden guard rail on the curve south of Cheshire and the rail went through the windshield. He was hit in the head and should have died, but after much surgery he survived. He was left retarded and was given a 100% disability from the government. I can't remember the year, but soon after the war Al Bunnell and another guy held up a bank in Rochester and were chased all the way-back to Canandaigua before the police caught them down on Coach Street. He spent several years in prison.  During training while loading the logs that braced the big guns, I broke a finger on my right hand and consequently had difficulty doing my laundry and writing letters. The medics put a splint of two tongue depressors on it and I still have one knuckle that doesn't bond. Sometimes at night we would have an alert drill and drive all the vehicles from the motor pool into the pine woods. Sometimes I would have to drive one of the big personnel carriers and I would grab blankets or anything big to put behind me so could reach the floor pedals. We drove without lights up steep banks and around curves in that deep sand. It was pitch dark and quite an experience. Then we would stop grab our gas masks and run into the woods as far as we could  and lay on the ground. We were supposed to put our gas masks on, but we  never did.  One day I was laying in my bunk looking at my gas mask hanging on the wall and decided to get it down and see if it fit. it was filled solid  with cockroaches! Guess what would have happened I had put it on out  there in the dark in the woods some night! The washroom had a cement  floor and when we went in there at night We would turn on the lights  and wait for the cockroaches to disappear. The boy from the Kentucky  hills spent all his extra time doing laundry for others for a small fee  and we all thought he was just too stupid to know any better. At the  end of the 13 weeks, however, we were given a three day pass. Nobody  had any money except the hillbilly and he went home for the three days and really lived it up. Sometimes the brains are not where they think  they are. I used my three days to visit Ken Montanye who was at Ft. Jackson in South Carolina. We met in a small dusty Southern town  halfway in between and stayed in a tourist home. There was nothing to  do in the little town so we just visited and walked the streets. I  traveled by Greyhound bus and it was so crowded I had to stand up in  front next to the driver. When I arrived back at base they were getting  ready to ship the men out to their next outfits. I received a letter  telling me that I had passed the test for the Air Corp and the company  commander told me to stay there and not leave with the rest.  The camp was empty for a week except for the sergeants who were instructors and myself. I did KP duty and cleaned barracks until the next group arrived. The next thirteen weeks I spent working around the  base and when they went an maneuvers I drove the supply truck. We would  go ahead about ten miles and I would set up the officer's tent, Wood  floor and cots. The new group would hike the ten miles and pitch their  pup tents. I Just crawled under a truck and slept in the sand. Sometimes during this period I got a pass and went down to Ft. Jackson  and stayed a few days with Ken in his barracks. Nobody knew what to do  with me so they just gave me jobs and I had my share of washing pots  and pans and peeling potatoes.  When this group shipped out, I got an order to see the camp commander,  a colonel. I didn't know what to expect but found out that I had been  listed as AWOL for the prior three months as they couldn't find me. I  was supposed to be at home waiting for them to call me! This is the way  everything went for me in the service. I could have been home living on  that big $21 a month and not doing all the dirty work. My orders  finally came and I went to Nashville, Tenn. by myself, probably by  train to the classification center. At the center we had three days of  intensive tests of all kinds to find out what we were best qualified  for: navigator, bombardier or pilot. Naturally, everyone was hoping for  pilot.  The tests were from morning till night and covered everything from physicals, eye, hearing and coordination to reaction time. The test for  depth perception was particularly interesting. At the end of a long  tunnel about a foot in diameter and dimly lit were two wooden pegs. You  had to pull them with strings until they were opposite each other.  Another one involved a board in front of you while you sat at a desk  and the board had little red lights with switches below them. When a  light came on, you had to turn the switch off and you had to move  quickly to keep up. Another was a small hole in a board with a wooden  peg that would just go in without touching the sides. While you held  the peg there, the instructor, Wolfgang Loganowiche ( I remember him  well and later read somewhere that he was a famous German scientist and  inventor) would yell and holler at us. He had a tremendous loud voice  and would sometimes sneak up behind you, yell, wave his arms and stomp  his feet. Ht would scare the daylights out of you and every time you  moved the peg would hit the sides and the loud buzzer would go off.  We also had written tests with a time limit so we had to work fast. I used to skip all the math problems as I was so bad in math. I didn't realize until later that it was a good thing I skipped the math as the  men who were good at it probably got sent to bombardier or navigator  training. Of course we really wanted to be pilots instead. The notices  were posted after three days and we were about worn out from the long  days of testing. I was lucky to be chosen for pilot training. This was  where I got used to standing in line and waiting. We had to wait in  line to get our issue of Air Corps uniforms and I stood in line from  8:00 am until almost 4:OO pm for my clothes. We couldn't get out of  line to get any dinner as we would lose our place. I now had all my  army clothes as well as my Air Corps cloths and everywhere I went I had  to make two trips carrying my barracks bags. When I got to my next  base, I either sent my Army clothing home or turned them in. I can't  recall which.  We were next sent by troop train to Maxwell Field in Alabama. Somewhere  on the trip we had to get off the train and spend the night in the  train station in one of those little southern towns. It was cold so we  made a mountain of barracks bags in the waiting room and then we  climbed up on them and tried to sleep. We arrived at Maxwell in  September and"]]]
