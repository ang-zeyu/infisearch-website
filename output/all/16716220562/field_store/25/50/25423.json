And Godwin still stood with his face covered by his robe.  And Harold anxiously watched the faces of the assembly, and saw no relenting.  And Gurth crept to Harold's side.  And the gay Leofwine looked sad.  And the young Wolnoth turned pale and trembled.  And the fierce Tostig played with his golden chain.  And one low sob was heard, and it came from the breast of Alred the meek accuser,--God's firm but gentle priest.     CHAPTER IV.   This memorable trial ended, as the reader will have forseen, in the formal renewal of Sweyn's outlawry, and the formal restitution of the Earl Godwin and his other sons to their lands and honours, with declarations imputing all the blame of the late dissensions to the foreign favourites, and sentences of banishment against them, except only, by way of a bitter mockery, some varlets of low degree, such as Humphrey Cock's-foot, and Richard son of Scrob. [92]  The return to power of this able and vigorous family was attended with an instantaneous effect upon the long-relaxed strings of the imperial government.  Macbeth heard, and trembled in his moors; Gryffyth of Wales lit the fire-beacon on moel and craig.  Earl Rolf was banished, but merely as a nominal concession to public opinion; his kinship to Edward sufficed to restore him soon, not only to England, but to the lordship of the Marches, and thither was he sent, with adequate force, against the Welch, who had half-repossessed themselves of the borders they harried.  Saxon prelates and abbots replaced the Norman fugitives; and all were contented with the revolution, save the King, for the King lost his Norman friends, and regained his English wife.  In conformity with the usages of the times, hostages of the loyalty and faith of Godwin were required and conceded.  They were selected from his own family; and the choice fell on Wolnoth, his son, and Haco, the son of Sweyn.  As, when nearly all England may be said to have repassed to the hands of Godwin, it would have been an idle precaution to consign these hostages to the keeping of Edward, it was settled, after some discussion, that they should be placed in the Court of the Norman Duke until such time as the King, satisfied with the good faith of the family, should authorise their recall:--Fatal hostage, fatal ward and host!  It was some days after this national crisis, and order and peace were again established in city and land, forest and shire, when, at the setting of the sun, Hilda stood alone by the altar-stone of Thor.  The orb was sinking red and lurid, amidst long cloud-wracks of vermeil and purple, and not one human form was seen in the landscape, save that tall and majestic figure by the Runic shrine and the Druid crommell.  She was leaning both hands on her wand, or seid-staff, as it was called in the language of Scandinavian superstition, and bending slightly forward as in the attitude of listening or expectation.  Long before any form appeared on the road below she seemed to be aware of coming footsteps, and probably her habits of life had sharpened her senses; for she smiled, muttered to herself, \"Ere it sets!\" and changing her posture, leant her arm on the altar, and rested her face upon her hand.  At length, two figures came up the road; they neared the hill; they saw her, and slowly ascended the knoll.  The one was dressed in the serge of a pilgrim, and his cowl thrown back, showed the face where human beauty and human power lay ravaged and ruined by human passions. He upon whom the pilgrim lightly leaned was attired simply, without the brooch or bracelet common to thegns of high degree, yet his port was that of majesty, and his brow that of mild command.  A greater contrast could not be conceived than that between these two men, yet united by a family likeness.  For the countenance of the last described was, though sorrowful at that moment, and indeed habitually not without a certain melancholy, wonderfully imposing from its calm and sweetness.  There, no devouring passions had left the cloud or ploughed the line; but all the smooth loveliness of youth took dignity from the conscious resolve of men.  The long hair, of a fair brown, with a slight tinge of gold, as the last sunbeams shot through its luxuriance, was parted from the temples, and fell in large waves half way to the shoulder.  The eyebrows, darker in hue, arched and finely traced; the straight features, not less manly than the Norman, but less strongly marked: the cheek, hardy with exercise and exposure, yet still retaining somewhat of youthful bloom under the pale bronze of its sunburnt surface: the form tall, not gigantic, and vigorous rather from perfect proportion and athletic habits than from breadth and bulk--were all singularly characteristic of the Saxon beauty in its highest and purest type.  But what chiefly distinguished this personage, was that peculiar dignity, so simple, so sedate, which no pomp seems to dazzle, no danger to disturb; and which perhaps arises from a strong sense of self-dependence, and is connected with self- respect--a dignity common to the Indian and the Arab, and rare except in that state of society in which each man is a power in himself.  The Latin tragic poet touches close upon that sentiment in the fine lines--      \"Rex est qui metuit nihil;      Hoc regnum sibi quisque dat.\" [93]  So stood the brothers, Sweyn the outlaw and Harold the Earl, before the reputed prophetess.  She looked on both with a steady eye, which gradually softened almost into tenderness, as it finally rested upon the pilgrim.  \"And is it thus,\" she said at last, \"that I see the first-born of Godwin the fortunate, for whom so often I have tasked the thunder, and watched the setting sun? for whom my runes have been graven on the bark of the elm, and the Scin-laeca [94] been called in pale splendour from the graves of the dead?\"  \"Hilda,\" said Sweyn, \"not now will I accuse thee of the seeds thou hast sown: the harvest is gathered and the sickle is broken.  Abjure thy dark Galdra [95], and turn as I to the sole light in the future, which shines from the tomb of the Son Divine.\"  The Prophetess bowed her head and replied:  \"Belief cometh as the wind.  Can the tree say to the wind, 'Rest thou on my boughs,' or Man to Belief, 'Fold thy wings on my heart'?  Go where thy soul can find comfort, for thy life hath passed from its use on earth.  And when I would read thy fate, the runes are as blanks, and the wave sleeps unstirred on the fountain.  Go where the Fylgia [96], whom Alfader gives to each at his birth, leads thee.  Thou didst desire love that seemed shut from thee, and I predicted that thy love should awake from the charnel in which the creed that succeeds to the faith of our sires inters life in its bloom.  And thou didst covet the fame of the Jarl and the Viking, and I blessed thine axe to thy hand, and wove the sail for thy masts.  So long as man knows desire, can Hilda have power over his doom.  But when the heart lies in ashes, I raise but a corpse, that at the hush of the charm falls again into its grave.  Yet, come to me nearer, O Sweyn, whose cradle I rocked to the chaunt of my rhyme.\"  The outlaw turned aside his face, and obeyed.  She sighed as she took his passive hand in her own, and examined the lines on the palm.  Then, as if by an involuntary impulse of fondness and pity, she put aside his cowl and kissed his brow.  \"Thy skein is spun, and happier than the many who scorn, and the few who lament thee, thou shalt win where they lose.  The steel shall not smite thee, the storm shall forbear thee, the goal that thou yearnest for thy steps shall attain.  Night hallows the ruin,--and peace to the shattered wrecks of the brave!\"  The outlaw heard as if unmoved.  But when he turned to Harold, who covered his face with his hand; but could not restrain the tears that flowed through the clasped fingers, a moisture came into his own wild, bright eyes, and he said, \"Now, my brother, farewell, for no farther step shalt thou wend with me.\"  Harold started, opened his arms, and the outlaw fell upon his breast.  No sound was heard save a single sob, and so close was breast to breast, that you could not say from whose heart it came.  Then the outlaw wrenched himself from the embrace, and murmured, \"And Haco--my son--motherless, fatherless--hostage in the land of the stranger! Thou wilt remember--thou wilt shield him; thou be to him mother, father in the days to come!  So may the saints bless thee!\"  With these words he sprang down the hillock.  Harold bounded after him; but Sweyn, halting, said, mournfully, \"Is this thy promise?  Am I so lost that faith should be broken even with thy father's son?\"  At that touching rebuke, Harold paused, and the outlaw passed his way alone.  As the last glimpse of his figure vanished at the turn of the road, whence, on the second of May, the Norman Duke and the Saxon King had emerged side by side, the short twilight closed abruptly, and up from the far forestland rose the moon.  Harold stood rooted to the spot, and still gazing on the space, when the Vala laid her hand on his arm.  \"Behold, as the moon rises on the troubled gloaming, so rises the fate of Harold, as yon brief, human shadow, halting between light and darkness, passes away to night.  Thou art now the first-born of a House that unites the hopes of the Saxon with the fortunes of the Dane.\"  \"Thinkest thou,\" said Harold, with a stern composure, \"that I can have joy and triumph in a brother's exile and woe?\"  \"Not now, and not yet, will the voice of thy true nature be heard; but the warmth of the sun brings the thunder, and the glory of fortune wakes the storm of the soul.\"  \"Kinswoman,\" said Harold, with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7674"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 03 (#7)"],["body"," slight curl of his lip, \"by me at least have thy prophecies ever passed as the sough of the air; neither in horror nor with faith do I think of thy incantations and charms; and I smile alike at the exorcism of the shaveling and the spells of the Saga.  I have asked thee not to bless mine axe, nor weave my sail. No runic rhyme is on the sword-blade of Harold.  I leave my fortunes to the chance of mine own cool brain and strong arm.  Vala, between thee and me there is no bond.\"  The Prophetess smiled loftily.  \"And what thinkest thou, O self-dependent! what thinkest thou is the fate which thy brain and thine arm shall will?\"  \"The fate they have won already.  I see no Beyond.  The fate of a man sworn to guard his country, love justice, and do right.\"  The moon shone full on the heroic face of the young Earl as he spoke; and on its surface there seemed nought to belie the noble words.  Yet, the Prophetess, gazing earnestly on that fair countenance, said, in a whisper, that, despite a reason singularly sceptical for the age in which it had been cultured, thrilled to the Saxon's heart, \"Under that calm eye sleeps the soul of thy sire, and beneath that brow, so haught and so pure, works the genius that crowned the kings of the north in the lineage of thy mother the Dane.\"  \"Peace!\" said Harold, almost fiercely; then, as if ashamed of the weakness of his momentary irritation, he added, with a faint smile, \"Let us not talk of these matters while my heart is still sad and away from the thoughts of the world, with my brother the lonely outlaw. Night is on us, and the ways are yet unsafe; for the king's troops, disbanded in haste, were made up of many who turn to robbers in peace. Alone, and unarmed, save my ateghar, I would crave a night's rest under thy roof; and\"--he hesitated, and as light blush came over his cheek--\"and I would fain see if your grandchild is as fair as when I last looked on her blue eyes, that then wept for Harold ere he went into exile.\"  \"Her tears are not at her command, nor her smiles,\" said the Vala, solemnly; \"her tears flow from the fount of thy sorrows, and her smiles are the beams from thy joys.  For know, O Harold! that Edith is thine earthly Fylgia; thy fate and her fate are as one.  And vainly as man would escape from his shadow, would soul wrench itself from the soul that Skulda hath linked to his doom.\"  Harold made no reply; but his step, habitually slow, grew more quick and light, and this time his reason found no fault with the oracles of the Vala.     CHAPTER V.   As Hilda entered the hall, the various idlers accustomed to feed at her cost were about retiring, some to their homes in the vicinity, some, appertaining to the household, to the dormitories in the old Roman villa.  It was not the habit of the Saxon noble, as it was of the Norman, to put hospitality to profit, by regarding his guests in the light of armed retainers.  Liberal as the Briton, the cheer of the board and the shelter of the roof were afforded with a hand equally unselfish and indiscriminate; and the doors of the more wealthy and munificent might be almost literally said to stand open from morn to eve.  As Harold followed the Vala across the vast atrium, his face was recognised, and a shout of enthusiastic welcome greeted the popular Earl.  The only voices that did not swell that cry, were those of three monks from a neighbouring convent, who choose to wink at the supposed practices of the Morthwyrtha [97], from the affection they bore to her ale and mead, and the gratitude they felt for her ample gifts to their convent.  \"One of the wicked House, brother,\" whispered the monk.  \"Yea; mockers and scorners are Godwin and his lewd sons,\" answered the monk.  And all three sighed and scowled, as the door closed on the hostess and her stately guest.  Two tall and not ungraceful lamps lighted the same chamber in which Hilda was first presented to the reader.  The handmaids were still at their spindles, and the white web nimbly shot as the mistress entered. She paused, and her brow knit, as she eyed the work.  \"But three parts done?\" she said, \"weave fast, and weave strong.\"  Harold, not heeding the maids or their task, gazed inquiringly round, and from a nook near the window, Edith sprang forward with a joyous cry, and a face all glowing with delight--sprang forward, as if to the arms of a brother; but, within a step or so of that noble guest, she stopped short, and her eyes fell to the ground.  Harold held his breath in admiring silence.  The child he had loved from her cradle stood before him as a woman.  Even since we last saw her, in the interval between the spring and the autumn, the year had ripened the youth of the maiden, as it had mellowed the fruits of the earth; and her cheek was rosy with the celestial blush, and her form rounded to the nameless grace, which say that infancy is no more.  He advanced and took her hand, but for the first time in his life in their greetings, he neither gave nor received the kiss.  \"You are no child now, Edith,\" said he, involuntarily; \"but still set apart, I pray you, some remains of the old childish love for Harold.\"  Edith's charming lips smiled softly; she raised her eyes to his, and their innocent fondness spoke through happy tears.  But few words passed in the short interval between Harold's entrance and his retirement to the chamber prepared for him in haste.  Hilda herself led him to a rude ladder which admitted to a room above, evidently added, by some Saxon lord, to the old Roman pile.  The ladder showed the precaution of one accustomed to sleep in the midst of peril, for, by a kind of windlass in the room, it could be drawn up at the inmate's will, and, so drawn, left below a dark and deep chasm, delving down to the foundations of the house; nevertheless the room itself had all the luxury of the time; the bedstead was quaintly carved, and of some rare wood; a trophy of arms--though very ancient, sedulously polished--hung on the wall.  There were the small round shield and spear of the earlier Saxon, with his vizorless helm, and the short curved knife or saex [98], from which some antiquarians deem that the Saxish men take their renowned name.  Edith, following Hilda, proffered to the guest, on a salver of gold, spiced wines and confections; while Hilda, silently and unperceived, waved her seid-staff over the bed, and rested her pale hand on the pillow.  \"Nay, sweet cousin,\" said Harold, smiling, \"this is not one of the fashions of old, but rather, methinks, borrowed from the Frankish manners in the court of King Edward.\"  \"Not so, Harold,\" answered Hilda, quickly turning; such was ever the ceremony due to Saxon king, when he slept in a subject's house, ere our kinsmen the Danes introduced that unroyal wassail, which left subject and king unable to hold or to quaff cup, when the board was left for the bed.\"  \"Thou rebukest, O Hilda, too tauntingly, the pride of Godwin's house, when thou givest to his homely son the ceremonial of a king.  But, so served, I envy not kings, fair Edith.\"  He took the cup, raised it to his lips, and when he placed it on the small table by his side the women had left the chamber, and he was alone.  He stood for some minutes absorbed in reverie, and his soliloquy ran somewhat thus:  \"Why said the Vala that Edith's fate was inwoven with mine?  And why did I believe and bless the Vala, when she so said?  Can Edith ever be my wife?  The monk-king designs her for the cloister--Woe, and well-a- day!  Sweyn, Sweyn, let thy doom forewarn me!  And if I stand up in my place and say, 'Give age and grief to the cloister--youth and delight to man's hearth,' what will answer the monks?  'Edith cannot be thy wife, son of Godwin, for faint and scarce traced though your affinity of blood, ye are within the banned degrees of the Church.  Edith may be wife to another, if thou wilt,--barren spouse of the Church or mother of children who lisp not Harold's name as their father.'  Out on these priests with their mummeries, and out on their war upon human hearts!\"  His fair brow grew stern and fierce as the Norman Duke's in his ire; and had you seen him at the moment you would have seen the true brother of Sweyn.  He broke from his thoughts with the strong effort of a man habituated to self-control, and advanced to the narrow window, opened the lattice, and looked out.  The moon was in all her splendour.  The long deep shadows of the breathless forest chequered the silvery whiteness of open sward and intervening glade.  Ghostly arose on the knoll before him the grey columns of the mystic Druid,--dark and indistinct the bloody altar of the Warrior god.  But there his eye was arrested; for whatever is least distinct and defined in a landscape has the charm that is the strongest; and, while he gazed, he thought that a pale phosphoric light broke from the mound with the bautastein, that rose by the Teuton altar.  He thought, for he was not sure that it was not some cheat of the fancy.  Gazing still, in the centre of that light there appeared to gleam forth, for one moment, a form of superhuman height. It was the form of a man, that seemed clad in arms like those on the wall, leaning on a spear, whose point was lost behind the shafts of the crommell.  And the face grew in that moment distinct from the light which shimmered around it, a face large as some early god's, but stamped with unutterable and solemn woe.  He drew back a step, passed his hand over his eyes, and looked again.  Light and figure alike had vanished; nought was seen save the grey columns and dim fane.  The Earl's lip curved in derision of his weakness.  He closed the lattice, undressed, knelt for a moment or so by the bedside, and his prayer was brief and simple, nor accompanied with the crossings and signs customary in his age.  He rose, extinguished the lamp, and threw himself on the bed.  The moon, thus relieved of the lamp-light, came clear and bright through the room, shone on the trophied"]]]
