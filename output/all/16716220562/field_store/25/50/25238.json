I was beginning to hate my legs, or rather my trousers, for I considered that under them I had as good a pair of calves as any man in the company.  Presently I thought of something to say, something very simple, which my dignified old friend would be able to answer without intimating that he considered me a wild man of the woods or an escaped lunatic.  \"Can you tell me,\" I said pleasantly, \"what is the name of your nearest town or city? how far it is from this place, and how I can get there?\"  At this question, or series of questions, the young girl turned quite round, and, waiting until I was even with her, she continued her walk at my side, although still holding her companion's hand.  The old man looked at me with a grave smile--that smile was fast becoming intolerable--and said: \"Are you so fond of honey, Smith? You shall have as much as you require without disturbing the bees. They are now taking advantage of this second spring to lay by a sufficient provision before winter sets in.\"  After pondering some time over these enigmatical words, I said: \"I daresay we are at cross purposes again. I mean,\" I added hurriedly, seeing the inquiring look on his face, \"that we do not exactly understand each other, for the subject of honey was not in my thoughts.\"  \"What, then, do you mean by a city?\" he asked.  \"What do I mean? Why, a city, I take it, is nothing more than a collection or congeries of houses--hundreds and thousands, or hundreds _of_ thousands of houses, all built close together, where one can live very comfortably for years without seeing a blade of grass.\"  \"I am afraid,\" he returned, \"that the accident you met with in the mountains must have caused some injury to your brain; for I cannot in any other way account for these strange fantasies.\"  \"Do you mean seriously to tell me, sir, that you have never even heard of the existence of a city, where millions of human beings live crowded together in a small space? Of course I mean a small space comparatively; for in some cities you might walk all day without getting into the fields; and a city like that might be compared to a beehive so large that a bee might fly in a straight line all day without getting out of it.\"  It struck me the moment I finished speaking that this comparison was not quite right somehow; but he did not ask me to explain: he had evidently ceased to pay any attention to what I said. The girl looked at me with an expression of pity, not to say contempt, and I felt at the same time ashamed and vexed. This served to rouse a kind of dogged spirit in me, and I returned to the subject once more.  \"Surely,\" I said, \"you have heard of such cities as Paris, Vienna, Rome, Athens, Babylon, Jerusalem?\"  He only shook his head, and walked on in silence.  \"And London! London is the capital of England. Why,\" I exclaimed, beginning to see light, and wondering at myself for not having seen it sooner, \"you are at present talking to me in the English language.\"  \"I fail to understand your meaning, and am even inclined to doubt that you have any,\" said he, a little ruffled. \"I am addressing you in the language of human beings--that is all.\"  \"Well, it seems awfully puzzling,\" said I; \"but I hope you don't think I have been indulging in--well, tarradiddles.\" Then, seeing that I was making matters no clearer, I added: \"I mean that I have not been telling untruths.\"  \"I could not think that,\" he answered sternly. \"It would indeed be a clouded mind which could mistake mere disordered fancies for willful offenses against the truth. I have no doubt that when you have recovered from the effects of your late accident these vain thoughts and imaginations will cease to trouble you.\"  \"And in the meantime, perhaps, I had better say as little as possible,\" said I, with considerable temper. \"At present we do not seem able to understand each other at all.\"  \"You are right, we do not,\" he said; and then added with a grave smile, \"although I must allow that this last remark of yours is quite intelligible.\"  \"I'm glad of that,\" I returned. \"It is distressing to talk and not to be understood; it is like men calling to each other in a high wind, hearing voices but not able to distinguish words.\"  \"Again I understand you,\" said he approvingly; while the beautiful girl bestowed on me the coveted reward of a smile, which had no pity or contempt in it.  \"I think,\" I continued, determined to follow up this new train of ideas on which I had so luckily stumbled, \"that we are not so far apart in mind after all. About some things we stand quite away from each other, like the widely diverging branches of a tree; but, like the branches, we have a meeting-place, and this is, I fancy, in that part of our nature where our feelings are. My accident in the hills has not disarranged that part of me, I am sure, and I can give you an instance. A little while ago when I was standing behind the bushes watching you all, I saw this young lady----\"  Here a look of surprise and inquiry from the girl warned me that I was once more plunging into obscurity.  \"When I saw _you_,\" I continued, somewhat amused at her manner, \"cast yourself on the earth to kiss the cold face of one you had loved in life, I felt the tears of sympathy come to my own eyes.\"  \"Oh, how strange!\" she exclaimed, flashing on me a glance from her green, mysterious eyes; and then, to increase my wonder and delight, she deliberately placed her hand in mine.  \"And yet not strange,\" said the old man, by way of comment on her words.  \"It seemed strange to Yoletta that one so unlike us outwardly should be so like us in heart,\" remarked the young man at her side.  There was something about this speech which I did not altogether like, though I could not detect anything like sarcasm in the tone of the speaker.  \"And yet,\" continued the lovely girl, \"you never saw him living--never heard his sweet voice, which still seems to come back to me like a melody from the distance.\"  \"Was he your father?\" I asked.  The question seemed to surprise her very much. \"_He_ is our father,\" she returned, with a glance at the old gentleman, which seemed strange, for he certainly looked aged enough to be her great-grandfather.  He smiled and said: \"You forget, my daughter, that I am as little known to this stranger to our country as all the great and illustrious personages he has mentioned are to us.\"  At this point I began to lose interest in the conversation. It was enough for me to feel that I held that precious hand in mine, and presently I felt tempted to administer a gentle squeeze. She looked at me and smiled, then glanced over my whole person, the survey finishing at my boots, which seemed to have a disagreeable fascination for her. She shivered slightly, and withdrew her hand from mine, and in my heart I cursed those rusty, thick-soled monstrosities in which my feet were cased. However, we were all on a better footing now; and I resolved for the future to avoid all dangerous topics, historical and geographical, and confine myself to subjects relating to the emotional side of our natures.  At the end our way to the house was over a green turf, among great trees as in a park; and as there was no road or path, the first sight of the building seen near, when we emerged from the trees, came as a surprise. There were no gardens, lawns, inclosures or hedges near it, nor cultivation of any kind. It was like a wilderness, and the house produced the effect of a noble ruin. It was a hilly stone country where masses of stone cropped out here and there among the woods and on the green slopes, and it appeared that the house had been raised on the natural foundation of one of these rocks standing a little above the river that flowed behind it. The stone was gray, tinged with red, and the whole rock, covering an acre or so of ground, had been worn or hewn down to form a vast platform which stood about a dozen feet above the surrounding green level. The sloping and buttressed sides of the platform were clothed with ivy, wild shrubs, and various flowering plants. Broad, shallow steps led up to the house, which was all of the same material--reddish-gray stone; and the main entrance was beneath a lofty portico, the sculptured entablature of which was supported by sixteen huge caryatides, standing on round massive pedestals. The building was not high as a castle or cathedral; it was a dwelling-place, and had but one floor, and resembled a ruin to my eyes because of the extreme antiquity of its appearance, the weather-worn condition and massiveness of the sculptured surfaces, and the masses of ancient ivy covering it in places. On the central portion of the building rested a great dome-shaped roof, resembling ground glass of a pale reddish tint, producing the effect of a cloud resting on the stony summit of a hill.  I remained standing on the grass about thirty yards from the first steps after the others had gone in, all but the old gentleman, who still kept with me. By-and-by, withdrawing to a stone bench under an oak-tree, he motioned to me to take a seat by his side. He said nothing, but appeared to be quietly enjoying my undisguised surprise and admiration.  \"A noble mansion!\" I remarked at length to my venerable host, feeling, Englishman-like, a sudden great access of respect towards the owner of a big house. Men in such a position can afford to be as eccentric as they like, even to the wearing of Carnivalesque garments, burying their friends or relations in a park, and shaking their heads over such names as Smith or Shakespeare. \"A glorious place! It must have cost a pot of money, and taken a long time to build.\"  \"What you mean by _a pot of money_ I do not know,\" said he. \"When you add _a long time to build_, I am also puzzled to understand you. For are not all houses, like the forest of trees, the human race, the world we live in, eternal?\"  \"If "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7401"],["title","A Crystal Age (#4)"],["body","stand forever they are so in one sense, I suppose,\" I answered, beginning to fear that I had already unfortunately broken the rule I had so recently laid down for my own guidance. \"But the trees of the forest, to which you compare a house, spring from seed, do they not? and so have a beginning. Their end also, like the end of man, is to die and return to the dust.\"  \"That is true,\" he returned; \"it is, moreover, a truth which I do not now hear for the first time; but it has no connection with the subject we are discussing. Men pass away, and others take their places. Trees also decay, but the forest does not die, or suffer for the loss of individual trees; is it not the same with the house and the family inhabiting it, which is one with the house, and endures forever, albeit the members composing it must all in time return to the dust?\"  \"Is there no decay, then, of the materials composing a house?\"  \"Assuredly there is! Even the hardest stone is worn in time by the elements, or by the footsteps of many generations of men; but the stone that decays is removed, and the house does not suffer.\"  \"I have never looked at it quite in this light before,\" said I. \"But surely we can build a house whenever we wish!\"  \"Build a house whenever we wish!\" he repeated, with that astonished look which threatened to become the permanent expression of his face--so long as he had me to talk with, at any rate.  \"Yes, or pull one down if we find it unsuitable--\" But his look of horror here made me pause, and to finish the sentence I added: \"Of course, you must admit that a house had a beginning?\"  \"Yes; and so had the forest, the mountain, the human race, the world itself. But the origin of all these things is covered with the mists of time.\"  \"Does it never happen, then, that a house, however substantially built--\"  \"However what! But never mind; you continue to speak in riddles. Pray, finish what you were saying.\"  \"Does it never happen that a house is overthrown by some natural force--by floods, or subsidence of the earth, or is destroyed by lightning or fire?\"  \"No!\" he answered, with such tremendous emphasis that he almost made me jump from my seat. \"Are you alone so ignorant of these things that you speak of building and of pulling down a house?\"  \"Well, I fancied I knew a lot of things once,\" I answered, with a sigh. \"But perhaps I was mistaken--people often are. I should like to hear you say something more about all these things--I mean about the house and the family, and the rest of it.\"  \"Are you not, then, able to read--have you been taught absolutely nothing?\"  \"Oh yes, certainly I can read,\" I answered, joyfully seizing at once on the suggestion, which seemed to open a simple, pleasant way of escape from the difficulty. \"I am by no means a studious person; perhaps I am never so happy as when I have nothing to read. Nevertheless, I do occasionally look into books, and greatly appreciate their gentle, kindly ways. They never shut themselves up with a sound like a slap, or throw themselves at your head for a duffer, but seem silently grateful for being read, even by a stupid person, and teach you very patiently, like a pretty, meek-spirited young girl.\"  \"I am very pleased to hear it,\" said he. \"You shall read and learn all these things for yourself, which is the best method. Or perhaps I ought rather to say, you shall by reading recall them to your mind, for it is impossible to believe that it has always been in its present pitiable condition. I can only attribute such a mental state, with its disordered fancies about cities, or immense hives of human beings, and other things equally frightful to contemplate, and its absolute vacancy concerning ordinary matters of knowledge, to the grave accident you met with in the hills. Doubtless in falling your head was struck and injured by a stone. Let us hope that you will soon recover possession of your memory and other faculties. And now let us repair to the eating-room, for it is best to refresh the body first, and the mind afterwards.\"       Chapter 3  We ascended the steps, and passing through the portico went into the hall by what seemed to me a doorless way. It was not really so, as I discovered later; the doors, of which there were several, some of colored glass, others of some other material, were simply thrust back into receptacles within the wall itself, which was five or six feet thick. The hall was the noblest I had ever seen; it had a stone and bronze fireplace some twenty or thirty feet long on one side, and several tall arched doorways on the other. The spaces between the doors were covered with sculpture, its material being a blue-gray stone combined or inlaid with a yellow metal, the effect being indescribably rich. The floor was mosaic of many dark colors, but with no definite pattern, and the concave roof was deep red in color. Though beautiful, it was somewhat somber, as the light was not strong. At all events, that is how it struck me at first on coming in from the bright sunlight. Nor, it appeared, was I alone in experiencing such a feeling. As soon as we were inside, the old gentleman, removing his cap and passing his thin fingers through his white hair, looked around him, and addressing some of the others, who were bringing in small round tables and placing them about the hall, said: \"No, no; let us sup this evening where we can look at the sky.\"  The tables were immediately taken away.  Now some of those who were in the hall or who came in with the tables had not attended the funeral, and these were all astonished on seeing me. They did not stare at me, but I, of course, saw the expression on their faces, and noticed that the others who had made my acquaintance at the grave-side whispered in their ears to explain my presence. This made me extremely uncomfortable, and it was a relief when they began to go out again.  One of the men was seated near me; he was of those who had assisted in carrying the corpse, and he now turned to me and remarked: \"You have been a long time in the open air, and probably feel the change as much as we do.\"  I assented, and he rose and walked away to the far end of the hall, where a great door stood facing the one by which we had entered. From the spot where I was--a distance of forty or fifty feet, perhaps--this door appeared to be of polished slate of a very dark gray, its surface ornamented with very large horse-chestnut leaves of brass or copper, or both, for they varied in shade from bright yellow to deepest copper-red. It was a double door with agate handles, and, first pressing on one handle, then on the other, he thrust it back into the walls on either side, revealing a new thing of beauty to my eyes, for behind the vanished door was a window, the sight of which came suddenly before me like a celestial vision. Sunshine, wind, cloud and rain had evidently inspired the artist who designed it, but I did not at the time understand the meaning of the symbolic figures appearing in the picture. Below, with loosened dark golden-red hair and amber-colored garments fluttering in the wind, stood a graceful female figure on the summit of a gray rock; over the rock, and as high as her knees, slanted the thin branches of some mountain shrub, the strong wind even now stripping them of their remaining yellow and russet leaves, whirling them aloft and away. Round the woman's head was a garland of ivy leaves, and she was gazing aloft with expectant face, stretching up her arms, as if to implore or receive some precious gift from the sky. Above, against the slaty-gray cloud-wrack, four exquisite slender girl-forms appeared, with loose hair, silver-gray drapery and gauzy wings as of ephemerae, flying in pursuit of the cloud. Each carried a quantity of flowers, shaped like lilies, in her dress, held up with the left hand; one carried red lilies, another yellow, the third violet, and the last blue; and the gauzy wings and drapery of each was also touched in places with the same hue as the flowers she carried. Looking back in their flight they were all with the disengaged hand throwing down lilies to the standing figure.  This lovely window gave a fresh charm to the whole apartment, while the sunlight falling through it served also to reveal other beauties which I had not observed. One that quickly drew and absorbed my attention was a piece of statuary on the floor at some distance from me, and going to it I stood for some time gazing on it in the greatest delight. It was a statue about one-third the size of life, of a young woman seated on a white bull with golden horns. She had a graceful figure and beautiful countenance; the face, arms and feet were alabaster, the flesh tinted, but with colors more delicate than in nature. On her arms were broad golden armlets, and the drapery, a long flowing robe, was blue, embroidered with yellow flowers. A stringed instrument rested on her knee, and she was represented playing and singing. The bull, with lowered horns, appeared walking; about his chest hung a garland of flowers mingled with ears of yellow corn, oak, ivy, and various other leaves, green and russet, and acorns and crimson berries. The garland and blue dress were made of malachite, _lapis lazuli_, and various precious stones.  \"Aha, my fair Phoenician, I know you well!\" thought I exultingly, \"though I never saw you before with a harp in your hand. But were you not gathering flowers, O lovely daughter of Agenor, when that celestial animal, that masquerading god, put himself so cunningly in your way to be admired and caressed, until you unsuspiciously placed yourself on his back? That explains the garland. I shall have a word to say about this pretty thing to my learned and very superior host.\"  The statue stood on an octagonal pedestal of a highly polished slaty-gray stone, and on each of its eight faces was a picture in which one human figure appeared. Now, from gazing on the statue itself I fell to contemplating one of these"]]]
