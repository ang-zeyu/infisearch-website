THE SACRIFICE ON THE ALTAR.     CHAPTER I.   The good Bishop Alred, now raised to the See of York, had been summoned from his cathedral seat by Edward, who had indeed undergone a severe illness, during the absence of Harold; and that illness had been both preceded and followed by mystical presentiments of the evil days that were to fall on England after his death.  He had therefore sent for the best and the holiest prelate in his realm, to advise and counsel with.  The bishop had returned to his lodging in London (which was in a Benedictine Abbey, not far from the Aldgate) late one evening, from visiting the King at his rural palace of Havering; and he was seated alone in his cell, musing over an interview with Edward, which had evidently much disturbed him, when the door was abruptly thrown open, and pushing aside in haste the monk, who was about formally to announce him, a man so travel-stained in garb, and of a mien so disordered, rushed in, that Alred gazed at first as on a stranger, and not till the intruder spoke did he recognise Harold the Earl.  Even then, so wild was the Earl's eye, so dark his brow, and so livid his cheek, that it rather seemed the ghost of the man than the man himself.  Closing the door on the monk, the Earl stood a moment on the threshold, with a breast heaving with emotions which he sought in vain to master; and, as if resigning the effort, he sprang forward, clasped the prelate's knees, bowed his head on his lap, and sobbed aloud.  The good bishop, who had known all the sons of Godwin from their infancy, and to whom Harold was as dear as his own child, folding his hands over the Earl's head, soothingly murmured a benediction.  \"No, no,\" cried the Earl, starting to his feet, and tossing the dishevelled hair from his eyes, \"bless me not yet!  Hear my tale first, and then say what comfort, what refuge, thy Church can bestow!\"  Hurriedly then the Earl poured forth the dark story, already known to the reader,--the prison at Belrem, the detention at William's court, the fears, the snares, the discourse by the riverside, the oath over the relics.  This told, he continued, \"I found myself in the open air, and knew not, till the light of the sun smote me, what might have passed into my soul.  I was, before, as a corpse which a witch raises from the dead, endows with a spirit not its own--passive to her hand-- life-like, not living.  Then, then it was as if a demon had passed from my body, laughing scorn at the foul things it had made the clay do.  O, father, father! is there not absolution from this oath,--an oath I dare not keep? rather perjure myself than betray my land!\"  The prelate's face was as pale as Harold's, and it was some moments before he could reply.  \"The Church can loose and unloose--such is its delegated authority. But speak on; what saidst thou at the last to William?\"  \"I know not, remember not--aught save these words.  'Now, then, give me those for whom I placed myself in thy power; let me restore Haco to his fatherland, and Wolnoth to his mother's kiss, and wend home my way.'  And, saints in heaven! what was the answer of this caitiff Norman, with his glittering eye and venomed smile?  'Haco thou shalt have, for he is an orphan and an uncle's love is not so hot as to burn from a distance; but Wolnoth, thy mother's son, must stay with me as a hostage for thine own faith.  Godwin's hostages are released; Harold's hostage I retain: it is but a form, yet these forms are the bonds of princes.'  \"I looked at him, and his eye quailed.  And I said, 'That is not in the compact.'  And William answered, 'No, but it is the seal to it.' Then I turned from the Duke and I called my brother to my side, and I said, 'Over the seas have I come for thee.  Mount thy steed and ride by my side, for I will not leave the land without thee.'  And Wolnoth answered, 'Nay, Duke William tells me that he hath made treaties with thee, for which I am still to be the hostage; and Normandy has grown my home, and I love William as my lord.'  Hot words followed, and Wolnoth, chafed, refused entreaty and command, and suffered me to see that his heart was not with England!  O, mother, mother, how shall I meet thine eye!  So I returned with Haco.  The moment I set foot on my native England, that moment her form seemed to rise from the tall cliffs, her voice to speak in the winds!  All the glamour by which I had been bound, forsook me; and I sprang forward in scorn, above the fear of the dead men's bones.  Miserable overcraft of the snarer!  Had my simple word alone bound me, or that word been ratified after slow and deliberate thought, by the ordinary oaths that appeal to God, far stronger the bond upon my soul than the mean surprise, the covert tricks, the insult and the mocking fraud.  But as I rode on, the oath pursued me--pale spectres mounted behind me on my steed, ghastly fingers pointed from the welkin; and then suddenly, O my father--I who, sincere in my simple faith, had, as thou knowest too well, never bowed submissive conscience to priest and Church--then suddenly I felt the might of some power, surer guide than that haughty conscience which had so in the hour of need betrayed me!  Then I recognised that supreme tribunal, that mediator between Heaven and man, to which I might come with the dire secret of my soul, and say, as I say now, on my bended knee, O father--father--bid me die, or absolve me from my oath!\"  Then Alred rose erect, and replied, \"Did I need subterfuge, O son, I would say, that William himself hath released thy bond, in detaining the hostage against the spirit of the guilty compact; that in the very words themselves of the oath, lies the release--'if God aid thee.' God aids no child to parricide--and thou art England's child!  But all school casuistry is here a meanness.  Plain is the law, that oaths extorted by compulsion, through fraud and in fear, the Church hath the right to loose: plainer still the law of God and of man, that an oath to commit crime it is a deadlier sin to keep than to forfeit. Wherefore, not absolving thee from the misdeed of a vow that, if trusting more to God's providence and less to man's vain strength and dim wit, thou wouldst never have uttered even for England's sake-- leaving her to the angels;--not, I say, absolving thee from that sin, but pausing yet to decide what penance and atonement to fix to its committal, I do in the name of the Power whose priest I am, forbid thee to fulfil the oath; I do release and absolve thee from all obligation thereto.  And if in this I exceed my authority as Romish priest, I do but accomplish my duties as living man.  To these grey hairs I take the sponsorship.  Before this holy cross, kneel, O my son, with me, and pray that a life of truth and virtue may atone the madness of an hour.\"  So by the crucifix knelt the warrior and the priest.     CHAPTER II.   All other thought had given way to Harold's impetuous yearning to throw himself upon the Church, to hear his doom from the purest and wisest of its Saxon preachers.  Had the prelate deemed his vow irrefragable, he would have died the Roman's death, rather than live the traitor's life; and strange indeed was the revolution created in this man's character, that he, \"so self-dependent,\" he who had hitherto deemed himself his sole judge below of cause and action, now felt the whole life of his life committed to the word of a cloistered shaveling.  All other thought had given way to that fiery impulse-- home, mother, Edith, king, power, policy, ambition!  Till the weight was from his soul, he was as an outlaw in his native land.  But when the next sun rose, and that awful burthen was lifted from his heart and his being--when his own calm sense, returning, sanctioned the fiat of the priest,--when, though with deep shame and rankling remorse at the memory of the vow, he yet felt exonerated, not from the guilt of having made, but the deadlier guilt of fulfilling it--all the objects of existence resumed their natural interest, softened and chastened, but still vivid in the heart restored to humanity.  But from that time, Harold's stern philosophy and stoic ethics were shaken to the dust; re-created, as it were, by the breath of religion, he adopted its tenets even after the fashion of his age.  The secret of his shame, the error of his conscience, humbled him.  Those unlettered monks whom he had so despised, how had he lost the right to stand aloof from their control! how had his wisdom, and his strength, and his courage, met unguarded the hour of temptation!  Yes, might the time come, when England could spare him from her side! when he, like Sweyn the outlaw, could pass a pilgrim to the Holy Sepulchre, and there, as the creed of the age taught, win full pardon for the single lie of his truthful life, and regain the old peace of his stainless conscience!  There are sometimes event and season in the life of man the hardest and most rational, when he is driven perforce to faith the most implicit and submissive; as the storm drives the wings of the petrel over a measureless sea, till it falls tame, and rejoicing at refuge, on the sails of some lonely ship.  Seasons when difficulties, against which reason seems stricken into palsy, leave him bewildered in dismay --when darkness, which experience cannot pierce, wraps the conscience, as sudden night wraps the traveller in the desert--when error entangles his feet in its inextricable web--when, still desirous of the right, he sees before him but a choice of evil; and the Angel of the Past, with a flaming sword, closes on him the gates of the Future. Then, Faith flashes on him, with a light from the cloud.  Then, he clings to Prayer as a drowning wretch to the plank.  Then, that solemn authority which clothes the Priest, as the interpreter between the soul and the Divinity, seizes on the heart that trembles with terror and joy; then, that mysterious"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7681"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 10 (#1)"],["body","of Atonement, of sacrifice, of purifying lustration (mystery which lies hid in the core of all religions), smoothes the frown on the Past, removes the flaming sword from the future.  The Orestes escapes from the hounding Furies, and follows the oracle to the spot where the cleansing dews shall descend on the expiated guilt.  He who hath never known in himself, nor marked in another, such strange crisis in human fate, cannot judge of the strength and the weakness it bestows.  But till he can so judge, the spiritual part of all history is to him a blank scroll, a sealed volume.  He cannot comprehend what drove the fierce Heathen, cowering and humbled, into the fold of the Church; what peopled Egypt with eremites; what lined the roads of Europe and Asia with pilgrim homicides; what, in the elder world, while Jove yet reigned on Olympus, is couched in the dim traditions of the expiation of Apollo, the joy-god, descending into Hades; or why the sinner went blithe and light-hearted from the healing lustrations of Eleusis.  In all these solemn riddles of the Jove world and the Christ's is involved the imperious necessity that man hath of repentance and atonement: through their clouds, as a rainbow, shines the covenant that reconciles the God and the man.  Now Life with strong arms plucked the reviving Harold to itself. Already the news of his return had spread through the city, and his chamber soon swarmed with joyous welcomes and anxious friends.  But the first congratulations over, each had tidings that claimed his instant attention, to relate.  His absence had sufficed to loosen half the links of that ill-woven empire.  All the North was in arms.  Northumbria had revolted as one man, from the tyrannous cruelty of Tostig; the insurgents had marched upon York; Tostig had fled in dismay, none as yet knew whither.  The sons of Algar had sallied forth from their Mercian fortresses, and were now in the ranks of the Northumbrians, who it was rumoured had selected Morcar (the elder) in the place of Tostig.  Amidst these disasters, the King's health was fast decaying; his mind seemed bewildered and distraught; dark ravings of evil portent that had escaped from his lip in his mystic reveries and visions, had spread abroad, bandied with all natural exaggerations, from lip to lip.  The country was in one state of gloomy and vague apprehension.  But all would go well, now Harold the great Earl--Harold the stout, and the wise, and the loved--had come back to his native land!  In feeling himself thus necessary to England,--all eyes, all hopes, all hearts turned to him, and to him alone,--Harold shook the evil memories from his soul, as a lion shakes the dews from his mane.  His intellect, that seemed to have burned dim and through smoke in scenes unfamiliar to its exercise, rose at once equal to the occasion.  His words reassured the most despondent.  His orders were prompt and decisive.  While, to and fro, went forth his bodes and his riders, he himself leaped on his horse, and rode fast to Havering.  At length that sweet and lovely retreat broke on his sight, as a bower through the bloom of a garden.  This was Edward's favourite abode: he had built it himself for his private devotions, allured by its woody solitudes and gloom of its copious verdure.  Here it was said, that once that night, wandering through the silent glades, and musing on heaven, the loud song of the nightingales had disturbed his devotions; with vexed and impatient soul, he had prayed that the music might be stilled: and since then, never more the nightingale was heard in the shades of Havering!  Threading the woodland, melancholy yet glorious with the hues of autumn, Harold reached the low and humble gate of the timber edifice, all covered with creepers and young ivy; and in a few moments more he stood in the presence of the King.  Edward raised himself with pain from the couch on which he was reclined [204], beneath a canopy supported by columns and surmounted by carved symbols of the bell towers of Jerusalem: and his languid face brightened at the sight of Harold.  Behind the King stood a man with a Danish battle-axe in his hand, the captain of the royal house- carles, who, on a sign from the King, withdrew.  \"Thou art come back, Harold,\" said Edward then, in a feeble voice; and the Earl drawing near, was grieved and shocked at the alteration of his face.  \"Thou art come back, to aid this benumbed hand, from which the earthly sceptre is about to fall.  Hush! for it is so, and I rejoice.\"  Then examining Harold's features, yet pale with recent emotions, and now saddened by sympathy with the King, he resumed: \"Well, man of this world, that went forth confiding in thine own strength, and in the faith of men of the world like thee,--well, were my warnings prophetic, or art thou contented with thy mission?\"  \"Alas!\" said Harold, mournfully.  \"Thy wisdom was greater than mine, O King; and dread the snares laid for me and our native land, under pretext of a promise made by thee to Count William, that he should reign in England, should he be your survivor.\"  Edward's face grew troubled and embarrassed.  \"Such promise,\" he said, falteringly, \"when I knew not the laws of England, nor that a realm could not pass like house and hyde by a man's single testament, might well escape from my thoughts, never too bent upon earthly affairs. But I marvel not that my cousin's mind is more tenacious and mundane. And verily, in those vague words, and from thy visit, I see the Future dark with fate and crimson with blood.\"  Then Edward's eyes grew locked and set, staring into space; and even that reverie, though it awed him, relieved Harold of much disquietude, for he rightly conjectured, that on waking from it Edward would press him no more as to those details, and dilemmas of conscience, of which he felt that the arch-worshipper of relics was no fitting judge.  When the King, with a heavy sigh, evinced return from the world of vision, he stretched forth to Harold his wan, transparent hand, and said:  \"Thou seest the ring on this finger; it comes to me from above, a merciful token to prepare my soul for death.  Perchance thou mayest have heard that once an aged pilgrim stopped me on my way from God's House, and asked for alms--and I, having nought else on my person to bestow, drew from my finger a ring, and gave it to him, and the old man went his way, blessing me.\"  \"I mind me well of thy gentle charity,\" said the Earl; \"for the pilgrim bruited it abroad as he passed, and much talk was there of it.\"  The King smiled faintly.  \"Now this was years ago.  It so chanced this year, that certain Englishers, on their way from the Holy Land, fell in with two pilgrims--and these last questioned them much of me.  And one, with face venerable and benign, drew forth a ring and said, 'When thou reachest England, give thou this to the King's own hand, and say, by this token, that on Twelfth-Day Eve he shall be with me.  For what he gave to me, will I prepare recompense without bound; and already the saints deck for the new comer the halls where the worm never gnaws and the moth never frets.'  'And who,' asked my subjects amazed, 'who shall we say, speaketh thus to us?'  And the pilgrim answered, 'He on whose breast leaned the Son of God, and my name is John!' [205] Wherewith the apparition vanished.  This is the ring I gave to the pilgrim; on the fourteenth night from thy parting, miraculously returned to me.  Wherefore, Harold, my time here is brief, and I rejoice that thy coming delivers me up from the cares of state to the preparation of my soul for the joyous day.\"  Harold, suspecting under this incredible mission some wily device of the Norman, who, by thus warning Edward (of whose precarious health he was well aware), might induce his timorous conscience to take steps for the completion of the old promise,--Harold, we say, thus suspecting, in vain endeavoured to combat the King's presentiments, but Edward interrupted him, with displeased firmness of look and tone:  \"Come not thou, with thy human reasonings, between my soul and the messenger divine; but rather nerve and prepare thyself for the dire calamities that lie greeding in the days to come!  Be thine, things temporal.  All the land is in rebellion.  Anlaf, whom thy coming dismissed, hath just wearied me with sad tales of bloodshed and ravage.  Go and hear him;--go hear the bodes of thy brother Tostig, who wait without in our hall;--go, take axe, and take shield, and the men of earth's war, and do justice and right; and on thy return thou shalt see with what rapture sublime a Christian King can soar aloft from his throne!  Go!\"  More moved, and more softened, than in the former day he had been with Edward's sincere, if fanatical piety, Harold, turning aside to conceal his face, said:  \"Would, O royal Edward, that my heart, amidst worldly cares, were as pure and serene as thine!  But, at least, what erring mortal may do to guard this realm, and face the evils thou foreseest in the Far--that will I do; and perchance, then, in my dying hour, God's pardon and peace may descend on me!\"  He spoke, and went.  The accounts he received from Anlaf (a veteran Anglo-Dane), were indeed more alarming than he had yet heard.  Morcar, the bold son of Algar, was already proclaimed, by the rebels, Earl of Northumbria; the shires of Nottingham, Derby, and Lincoln, had poured forth their hardy Dane populations on his behalf.  All Mercia was in arms under his brother Edwin; and many of the Cymrian chiefs had already joined the ally of the butchered Gryffyth.  Not a moment did the Earl lose in proclaiming the Herr-bann; sheaves of arrows were splintered, and the fragments, as announcing the War- Fyrd, were sent from thegn to thegn, and town to town.  Fresh messengers were despatched to Gurth to collect the whole force of his own earldom, and haste by quick marches to London; and, these preparations made, Harold returned to the metropolis, and with "]]]
