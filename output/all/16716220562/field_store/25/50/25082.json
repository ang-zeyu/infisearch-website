Set it up in the garret, if necessary, and then we can cut a hole in the roof if the tree chances to be too high for the room.  Tell Bridget to begin to fatten a turkey.  Tell her by the twentieth of December that turkey must not be able to stand on its legs for fat, and then on the next three days she must allow it to recline easily on its side, and stuff it to bursting.  (One ounce of stuffing beforehand is worth a pound afterwards.)  The pudding must be unusually huge, and darkly, deeply, lugubriously black in color.  It must be stuck so full of plums that the pudding itself will ooze out into the pan and not be brought on to the table at all.  I expect to be there by the twentieth, to manage these little things--remembering it is the early Bird that catches the worm--but give you the instructions in case I should be delayed.  And Carol must decide on the size of the tree--she knows best, she was a Christmas child; and she must plead for the snow-storm--the 'clerk of the weather' may pay some attention to her; and she must look up the boy with the dimple for me--she's likelier to find him than I am, this minute.  She must advise about the turkey, and Bridget must bring the pudding to her bedside and let her drop every separate plum into it and stir it once for luck, or I'll not eat a single slice--for Carol is the dearest part of Christmas to Uncle Jack, and he'll have none of it without her.  She is better than all the turkeys and puddings and apples and spare-ribs and wreaths and garlands and mistletoe and stockings and chimneys and sleigh-bells in Christendom.  She is the very sweetest Christmas Carol that was ever written, said, sung or chanted, and I am coming, as fast as ships and railway trains can carry me, to tell her so.\"  Carol's joy knew no bounds.  Mr. and Mrs. Bird laughed like children and kissed each other for sheer delight, and when the boys heard it they simply whooped like wild Indians, until the Ruggles family, whose back yard joined their garden, gathered at the door and wondered what was \"up\" in the big house.    IV.  \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER.\"  Uncle Jack did really come on the twentieth.  He was not detained by business, nor did he get left behind nor snowed up, as frequently happens in stories, and in real life too, I am afraid.  The snow-storm came also; and the turkey nearly died a natural and premature death from over-eating.  Donald came, too; Donald, with a line of down upon his upper lip, and Greek and Latin on his tongue, and stores of knowledge in his handsome head, and stories--bless me, you couldn't turn over a chip without reminding Donald of something that happened \"at College.\"  One or the other was always at Carol's bedside, for they fancied her paler than she used to be, and they could not bear her out of sight. It was Uncle lack, though, who sat beside her in the winter twilights. The room was quiet, and almost dark, save for the snow-light outside, and the flickering flame of the fire, that danced over the \"Sleeping Beauty's\" face, and touched the Fair One's golden locks with ruddier glory.  Carol's hand (all too thin and white these latter days) lay close clasped in Uncle Jack's, and they talked together quietly of many, many things.  \"I want to tell you all about my plans for Christmas this year, Uncle Jack,\" said Carol, on the first evening of his visit, \"because it will be the loveliest one I ever had.  The boys laugh at me for caring so much about it; but it isn't altogether because it is Christmas nor because it is my birthday; but long, long ago, when I first began to be ill, I used to think, the first thing when I waked on Christmas morning, 'To-day is Christ's birthday--AND MINE!'  I did not put the words close together, because that made it seem too bold but I first thought, 'Christ's birthday,' and then, in a minute, softly to myself--AND MINE!'  'Christ's birthday--AND MINE!' And so I do not quite feel about Christmas as other girls do.  Mama says she supposes that ever so many other children have been born on that day.  I often wonder where they are, Uncle Jack, and whether it is a dear thought to them, too, or whether I am so much in bed, and so often alone, that it means more to me.  Oh, I do hope that none of them are poor, or cold, or hungry; and I wish, I wish they were all as happy as I, because they are my little brothers and sisters.  Now, Uncle Jack, dear, I am going to try and make somebody happy every single Christmas that I live, and this year it is to be the 'Ruggleses in the rear.'\"  \"That large and interesting brood of children in the little house at the end of the back garden?\"  \"Yes; isn't it nice to see so many together?  We ought to call them the Ruggles children, of course; but Donald began talking of them as the 'Ruggleses in the rear,' and Papa and Mama took it up, and now we cannot seem to help it.  The house was built for Mr. Carter's coachman, but Mr. Carter lives in Europe, and the gentleman who rents his place doesn't care what happens to it, and so this poor Irish family came to live there.  When they first moved in, I used to sit in my window and watch them play in their backyard; they are so strong, and jolly, and good-natured; and then, one day, I had a terrible headache, and Donald asked them if they would please not scream quite so loud, and they explained that they were having a game of circus, but that they would change and play 'Deaf and Dumb School' all the afternoon.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Uncle Jack, \"what an obliging family, to be sure.\"  \"Yes, we all thought it very funny, and I smiled at them from the window when I was well enough to be up again.  Now, Sarah Maud comes to her door when the children come home from school, and if Mama nods her head, 'Yes,' that means 'Carol is very well,' and then you ought to hear the little Ruggleses yell--I believe they try to see how much noise they can make; but if Mama shakes her head, 'No,' they always play at quiet games.  Then, one day, 'Cary,' my pet canary, flew out of her cage, and Peter Ruggles caught her and brought her back, and I had him up here in my room to thank him.\"  \"Is Peter the oldest?\"  \"No; Sarah Maud is the oldest--she helps do the washing; and Peter is the next.  He is a dressmaker's boy.\"  \"And which is the pretty little red-haired girl?\"  \"That's Kitty.\"  \"And the fat youngster?\"  \"Baby Larry.\"  \"And that freckled one?\"  \"Now, don't laugh--that's Peoria!\"  \"Carol, you are joking.\"  \"No, really, Uncle dear.  She was born in Peoria; that's all.\"  \"And is the next boy Oshkosh?\"  \"No,\" laughed Carol, \"the others are Susan, and Clement, and Eily, and Cornelius.\"  \"How did you ever learn all their names?\"  \"Well, I have what I call a 'window-school.'  It is too cold now; but in warm weather I am wheeled out on my little balcony, and the Ruggleses climb up and walk along our garden fence, and sit down on the roof of our carriage-house.  That brings them quite near, and I read to them and tell them stories; On Thanksgiving Day they came up for a few minutes, it was quite warm at eleven o'clock, and we told each other what we had to be thankful for; but they gave such queer answers that Papa had to run away for fear of laughing; and I couldn't understand them very well.  Susan was thankful for 'TRUNKS,' of all things in the world; Cornelius, for 'horse cars;' Kitty, for 'pork steak;' while Clem, who is very quiet, brightened up when I came to him, and said he was thankful for 'HIS LAME PUPPY.'  Wasn't that pretty?\"  \"It might teach some of us a lesson, mightn't it, little girl?\"  \"That's what Mama said.  Now I'm going to give this whole Christmas to the Ruggleses; and, Uncle Jack, I earned part of the money myself.\"  \"You, my bird; how?\"  \"Well, you see, it could not be my own, own Christmas if Papa gave me all the money, and I thought to really keep Christ's birthday I ought to do something of my very own; and so I talked with Mama.  Of course she thought of something lovely; she always does; Mama's head is just brimming over with lovely thoughts, and all I have to do is ask, and out pops the very one I want.  This thought was, to let her write down, just as I told her, a description of how a little girl lived in her own room three years, and what she did to amuse herself; and we sent it to a magazine and got twenty-five dollars for it.  Just think!\"  \"Well, well,\" cried Uncle Jack, \"my little girl a real author!  And what are you going to do with this wonderful 'own' money of yours?\"  \"I shall give the nine Ruggleses a grand Christmas dinner here in this very room--that will be Papa's contribution, and afterwards a beautiful Christmas tree, fairly blooming with presents--that will be my part; for I have another way of adding to my twenty-five dollars, so that I can buy everything I like.  I should like it very much if you would sit at the head of the table, Uncle Jack, for nobody could ever be frightened of you, you dearest, dearest, dearest thing that ever was! Mama is going to help us, but Papa and the boys are going to eat together down stairs for fear of making the little Ruggleses shy; and after we've had a merry time with the tree we can open my window and all listen together to the music at the evening church-service, if it comes before the children go.  I have written a letter to the organist, and asked him if I might have the two songs I like best.  Will you see if it is all right?\"                           \"BIRDS NEST, Dec. 21st, 188-.  DEAR MR. WILKIE,--  I am the little sick girl who lives next door to the church, and, as I seldom go out, the music on practice days and Sundays is one of my greatest pleasures.  I want to know if you can let the boys sing 'Carol, brothers, carol,' on Christmas night, and if the one who sings 'My ain countree' so beautifully may please sing that too.  I think it is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/721"],["title","The Birds' Christmas Carol (#3)"],["body","loveliest song in the world, but it always makes me cry; doesn't it you?  If it isn't too much trouble, I hope they can sing them both quite early, as after ten o'clock I may be asleep.  --Yours respectfully,                                          CAROL BIRD.  P.S.--The reason I like 'Carol, brothers, carol,' is because the choir-boys sang it eleven years ago, the morning I was born, and put it into Mama's head to call me Carol.  She didn't remember then that my other name would be Bird, because she was half asleep, and couldn't think of but one thing at a time.  Donald says if I had been born on the Fourth of July they would have named me 'Independence,' or if on the twenty-second of February, 'Georgina,' or even 'Cherry,' like Cherry in Martin Chuzzlewit; but I like my own name and birthday best.  --Yours truly,                                          CAROL BIRD.\"   Uncle Jack thought the letter quite right, and did not even smile at her telling the organist so many family items.  The days flew by, as they always fly in holiday time, and it was Christmas eve before anybody knew it.  The family festival was quiet and very pleasant, but quite swallowed up in the grander preparations for next day.  Carol and Elfrida, her pretty German nurse, had ransacked books, and introduced so many plans, and plays, and customs and merry-makings from Germany, and Holland, and England and a dozen other places, that you would scarcely have known how or where you were keeping Christmas.  The dog and the cat had enjoyed their celebration under Carol's direction. Each had a tiny table with a lighted candle in the center, and a bit of Bologna sausage placed very near it, and everybody laughed till the tears stood in their eyes to see Villikins and Dinah struggle to nibble the sausages, and at the same time evade the candle flame.  Villikins barked, and sniffed, and howled in impatience, and after many vain attempts succeeded in dragging off the prize, though he singed his nose in doing it.  Dinah, meanwhile, watched him placidly, her delicate nostrils quivering with expectation, and, after all excitement had subsided, walked with dignity to the table, her beautiful gray satin tail sweeping behind her, and, calmly putting up one velvet paw, drew the sausage gently down, and walked out of the room without \"turning a hair,\" so to speak.  Elfrida had scattered handfuls of seeds over the snow in the garden, that the wild birds might have a comfortable breakfast next morning, and had stuffed bundles of dried grasses in the fireplaces, so that the reindeer of Santa Claus could refresh themselves after their long gallops across country.  This was really only done for fun, but it pleased Carol.  And when, after dinner, the whole family had gone to church to see the Christmas decorations, Carol limped wearily out on her little crutches, and, with Elfrida's help, placed all the family boots in a row in the upper hall.  That was to keep the dear ones from quarreling all through the year.  There were Papa's stout top boots; Mama's pretty buttoned shoes next; then Uncle Jack's, Donald's, Paul's and Hugh's; and at the end of the line her own little white worsted slippers.  Last, and sweetest of all, like the little children in Austria, she put a lighted candle in her window to guide the dear Christ-child, lest he should stumble in the dark night as he passed up the deserted street.  This done, she dropped into bed, a rather tired, but very happy Christmas fairy.    V.  SOME OTHER BIRDS ARE TAUGHT TO FLY.  Before the earliest Ruggles could wake and toot his five-cent tin horn, Mrs. Ruggles was up and stirring about the house, for it was a gala day in the family.  Gala day!  I should think so!  Were not her nine \"childern\" invited to a dinner-party at the great house, and weren't they going to sit down free and equal with the mightiest in the land? She had been preparing for this grand occasion ever since the receipt of the invitation, which, by the way, had been speedily enshrined in an old photograph frame and hung under the looking-glass in the most prominent place in the kitchen, where it stared the occasional visitor directly in the eye, and made him pale with envy:                           \"BIRDS' NEST, Dec. 17th, 188-.  DEAR MRS. RUGGLES,--  I am going to have a dinner-party on Christmas day, and would like to have all your children come.  I want them every one, please, from Sarah Maud to Baby Larry.  Mama says dinner will be at half-past five, and the Christmas tree at seven; so you may expect them home at nine o'clock.  Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I am, yours truly,                                               CAROL BIRD.\"   Breakfast was on the table promptly at seven o'clock, and there was very little of it, too; for it was an excellent day for short rations, though Mrs. Ruggles heaved a sigh as she reflected that even the boys, with their India-rubber stomachs, would be just as hungry the day after the dinner-party as if they had never had any at all.  As soon as the scanty meal was over, she announced the plan of the campaign: \"Now Susan, you an' Kitty wash up the dishes; an' Peter, can't you spread up the beds, so't I can git ter cuttin' out Larry's new suit?  I ain't satisfied with his close, an' I thought in the night of a way to make him a dress out of my old plaid shawl--kind o' Scotch style, yer know.  You other boys clear out from under foot!  Clem, you and Con hop into bed with Larry while I wash yer underflannins; 'twont take long to dry 'em.  Sarah Maud, I think 'twould be perfeckly han'som if you ripped them brass buttons off yer uncle's policeman's coat an' sewed 'em in a row up the front o' yer green skirt.  Susan, you must iron out yours an' Kitty's apurns; an' there, I came mighty near forgettin' Peory's stockin's!  I counted the whole lot last night when I was washin' of 'em, an' there ain't but nineteen anyhow yer fix 'em, an' no nine pairs mates nohow; an' I ain't goin' ter have my childern wear odd stockin's to a dinner-comp'ny, brought up as I was!  Eily, can't you run out and ask Mis' Cullen ter lend me a pair o' stockin's for Peory, an' tell her if she will, Peory'll give Jim half her candy when she gets home.  Won't yer, Peory?\"  Peoria was young and greedy, and thought the remedy so much worse than the disease that she set up a deafening howl at the projected bargain--a howl so rebellious and so out of all season that her mother started in her direction with flashing eye and uplifted hand; but she let it fall suddenly, saying, \"No, I won't lick ye Christmas day, if yer drive me crazy; but speak up smart, now, 'n say whether yer'd ruther give Tim Cullen half yer candy or go bare-legged ter the party?\" The matter being put so plainly, Peoria collected her faculties, dried her tears and chose the lesser evil, Clem having hastened the decision by an affectionate wink, that meant he'd go halves with her on his candy.  \"That's a lady;\" cried her mother.  \"Now, you young ones that ain't doin' nothin', play all yer want ter before noontime, for after ye git through eatin' at twelve o'clock me 'n Sarah Maud's goin' ter give yer such a washin' an' combin' an' dressin' as yer never had before an' never will agin, an' then I'm goin' to set yer down an' give yer two solid hours trainin' in manners; an' 'twon't be no foolin' neither.\"  \"All we've got ter do 's go eat!\" grumbled Peter.  \"Well, that's enough,\" responded his mother; \"there's more 'n one way of eatin', let me tell yer, an' you've got a heap ter learn about it, Peter Ruggles.  Lord sakes, I wish you childern could see the way I was fetched up to eat--never took a meal o' vittles in the kitchen before I married Ruggles; but yer can't keep up that style with nine young ones 'n yer Pa always off ter sea.\"  The big Ruggleses worked so well, and the little Ruggleses kept from \"under foot\" so successfully, that by one o'clock nine complete toilets were laid out in solemn grandeur on the beds.  I say, \"complete;\" but I do not know whether they would be called so in the best society.  The law of compensation had been well applied; he that had necktie had no cuffs; she that had sash had no handkerchief, and vice versa; but they all had boots and a certain amount of clothing, such as it was, the outside layer being in every case quite above criticism.  \"Now, Sarah Maud,\" said Mrs. Ruggles, her face shining with excitement, \"everything is red up an' we can begin.  I've got a boiler 'n a kettle 'n a pot o' hot water.  Peter, you go into the back bedroom, an' I'll take Susan, Kitty, Peory an' Cornelius; an' Sarah Maud, you take Clem, 'n Eily, 'n Larry, one to a time, an' git as fur as you can with 'em, an' then I'll finish 'em off while you do yerself.\"  Sarah Maud couldn't have scrubbed with any more decision and force if she had been doing floors, and the little Ruggleses bore it bravely, not from natural heroism, but for the joy that was set before them. Not being satisfied, however, with the \"tone\" of their complexions, she wound up operations by applying a little Bristol brick from the knife-board, which served as the proverbial \"last straw,\" from under which the little Ruggleses issued rather red and raw and out of temper. When the clock struck three they were all clothed, and most of them in their right minds, ready for those last touches that always take the most time.  Kitty's red hair was curled in thirty-four ringlets, Sarah Maud's was braided in one pig-tail, and Susan's and Eily's in two braids apiece, while Peoria's resisted all advances in the shape of hair oils and stuck out straight on all sides, like that of the Circassian girl of the circus--so Clem said; and he was sent into the bed-room for it too, from whence he was dragged out forgivingly by Peoria herself, five minutes later. Then--exciting moment--came linen collars for some and neckties and bows for others, and Eureka! the Ruggleses were dressed, and Solomon in all"]]]
