The reigning House of York owed much of its military success to the superiority of the bowmen under its banners, and the Londoners themselves were jealous of their reputation in this martial accomplishment.  For the last fifty years, notwithstanding the warlike nature of the times, the practice of the bow, in the intervals of peace, had been more neglected than seemed wise to the rulers.  Both the king and his loyal city had of late taken much pains to enforce the due exercise of \"Goddes instrumente,\" [So called emphatically by Bishop Latimer, in his celebrated Sixth Sermon.] upon which an edict had declared that \"the liberties and honour of England principally rested!\"  And numerous now was the attendance, not only of the citizens, the burghers, and the idle populace, but of the gallant nobles who surrounded the court of Edward IV., then in the prime of his youth,-- the handsomest, the gayest, and the bravest prince in Christendom.  The royal tournaments (which were, however, waning from their ancient lustre to kindle afresh, and to expire in the reigns of the succeeding Tudors), restricted to the amusements of knight and noble, no doubt presented more of pomp and splendour than the motley and mixed assembly of all ranks that now grouped around the competitors for the silver arrow, or listened to the itinerant jongleur, dissour, or minstrel, or, seated under the stunted shade of the old trees, indulged, with eager looks and hands often wandering to their dagger- hilts, in the absorbing passion of the dice; but no later and earlier scenes of revelry ever, perhaps, exhibited that heartiness of enjoyment, that universal holiday, which attended this mixture of every class, that established a rude equality for the hour between the knight and the retainer, the burgess and the courtier.  The revolution that placed Edward IV. upon the throne had, in fact, been a popular one.  Not only had the valour and moderation of his father, Richard, Duke of York, bequeathed a heritage of affection to his brave and accomplished son; not only were the most beloved of the great barons the leaders of his party; but the king himself, partly from inclination, partly from policy, spared no pains to win the good graces of that slowly rising, but even then important part of the population,--the Middle Class.  He was the first king who descended, without loss of dignity and respect, from the society of his peers and princes, to join familiarly in the feasts and diversions of the merchant and the trader.  The lord mayor and council of London were admitted, on more than one solemn occasion, into the deliberations of the court; and Edward had not long since, on the coronation of his queen, much to the discontent of certain of his barons, conferred the Knighthood of the hath upon four of the citizens.  On the other hand, though Edward's gallantries--the only vice which tended to diminish his popularity with the sober burgesses--were little worthy of his station, his frank, joyous familiarity with his inferiors was not debased by the buffooneries that had led to the reverses and the awful fate of two of his royal predecessors.  There must have been a popular principle, indeed, as well as a popular fancy, involved in the steady and ardent adherence which the population of London in particular, and most of the great cities, exhibited to the person and the cause of Edward IV. There was a feeling that his reign was an advance in civilization upon the monastic virtues of Henry VI., and the stern ferocity which accompanied the great qualities of \"The Foreign Woman,\" as the people styled and regarded Henry's consort, Margaret of Anjou. While thus the gifts, the courtesy, and the policy of the young sovereign made him popular with the middle classes, he owed the allegiance of the more powerful barons and the favour of the rural population to a man who stood colossal amidst the iron images of the Age,--the greatest and the last of the old Norman chivalry, kinglier in pride, in state, in possessions, and in renown than the king himself, Richard Nevile, Earl of Salisbury and Warwick.  This princely personage, in the full vigour of his age, possessed all the attributes that endear the noble to the commons.  His valour in the field was accompanied with a generosity rare in the captains of the time.  He valued himself on sharing the perils and the hardships of his meanest soldier.  His haughtiness to the great was not incompatible with frank affability to the lowly.  His wealth was enormous, but it was equalled by his magnificence, and rendered popular by his lavish hospitality.  No less than thirty thousand persons are said to have feasted daily at the open tables with which he allured to his countless castles the strong hands and grateful hearts of a martial and unsettled population.  More haughty than ambitious, he was feared because he avenged all affront; and yet not envied, because he seemed above all favour.  The holiday on the archery-ground was more than usually gay, for the rumour had spread from the court to the city that Edward was about to increase his power abroad, and to repair what he had lost in the eyes of Europe through his marriage with Elizabeth Gray, by allying his sister Margaret with the brother of Louis XI., and that no less a person than the Earl of Warwick had been the day before selected as ambassador on the important occasion.  Various opinions were entertained upon the preference given to France in this alliance over the rival candidate for the hand of the princess,--namely, the Count de Charolois, afterwards Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.  \"By 'r Lady,\" said a stout citizen about the age of fifty, \"but I am not over pleased with this French marriage-making!  I would liefer the stout earl were going to France with bows and bills than sarcenets and satins.  What will become of our trade with Flanders,--answer me that, Master Stokton?  The House of York is a good House, and the king is a good king, but trade is trade.  Every man must draw water to his own mill.\"  \"Hush, Master Heyford!\" said a small lean man in a light-gray surcoat. \"The king loves not talk about what the king does.  'T is ill jesting with lions.  Remember William Walker, hanged for saying his son should be heir to the crown.\"  \"Troth,\" answered Master Heyford, nothing daunted, for he belonged to one of the most powerful corporations of London,--it was but a scurvy Pepperer [old name for Grocer] who made that joke; but a joke from a worshipful goldsmith, who has moneys and influence, and a fair wife of his own, whom the king himself has been pleased to commend, is another guess sort of matter.  But here is my grave-visaged headman, who always contrives to pick up the last gossip astir, and has a deep eye into millstones.  Why, ho, there! Alwyn--I say, Nicholas Alwyn!--who would have thought to see thee with that bow, a good half-ell taller than thyself?  Methought thou wert too sober and studious for such man-at-arms sort of devilry.\"  \"An' it please you, Master Heyford,\" answered the person thus addressed,--a young man, pale and lean, though sinewy and large-boned, with a countenance of great intelligence, but a slow and somewhat formal manner of speech, and a strong provincial accent,--\"an' it please you, King Edward's edict ordains every Englishman to have a bow of his own height; and he who neglects the shaft on a holiday forfeiteth one halfpenny and some honour.  For the rest, methinks that the citizens of London will become of more worth and potency every year; and it shall not be my fault if I do not, though but a humble headman to your worshipful mastership, help to make them so.\"  \"Why, that's well said, lad; but if the Londoners prosper, it is because they have nobles in their gipsires, [a kind of pouch worn at the girdle] not bows in their hands.\"  \"Thinkest thou then, Master Heyford, that any king at a pinch would leave them the gipsire, if they could not protect it with the bow? That Age may have gold, let not Youth despise iron.\"  \"Body o' me!\" cried Master Heyford, \"but thou hadst better curb in thy tongue.  Though I have my jest,--as a rich man and a corpulent,--a lad who has his way to make good should be silent and--But he's gone.\"  \"Where hooked you up that young jack fish?\" said Master Stokton, the thin mercer, who had reminded the goldsmith of the fate of the grocer.  \"Why, he was meant for the cowl, but his mother, a widow, at his own wish, let him make choice of the flat cap.  He was the best 'prentice ever I had.  By the blood of Saint Thomas, he will push his way in good time; he has a head, Master Stokton,--a head, and an ear; and a great big pair of eyes always looking out for something to his proper advantage.\"  In the mean while, the goldsmith's headman had walked leisurely up to the archery-ground; and even in his gait and walk, as he thus repaired to a pastime, there was something steady, staid, and business-like.  The youths of his class and calling were at that day very different from their equals in this.  Many of them the sons of provincial retainers, some even of franklins and gentlemen, their childhood had made them familiar with the splendour and the sports of knighthood; they had learned to wrestle, to cudgel, to pitch the bar or the quoit, to draw the bow, and to practise the sword and buckler, before transplanted from the village green to the city stall.  And even then, the constant broils and wars of the time, the example of their betters, the holiday spectacle of mimic strife, and, above all, the powerful and corporate association they formed amongst themselves, tended to make them as wild, as jovial, and as dissolute a set of young fellows as their posterity are now sober, careful, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7715"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 01 (#6)"],["body","discreet. And as Nicholas Alwyn, with a slight inclination of his head, passed by, two or three loud, swaggering, bold-looking groups of apprentices --their shaggy hair streaming over their shoulders, their caps on one side, their short cloaks of blue torn or patched, though still passably new, their bludgeons under their arms, and their whole appearance and manner not very dissimilar from the German collegians in the last century--notably contrasted Alwyn's prim dress, his precise walk, and the feline care with which he stepped aside from any patches of mire that might sully the soles of his square-toed shoes.  The idle apprentices winked and whispered, and lolled out their tongues at him as he passed.  \"Oh, but that must be as good as a May- Fair day,--sober Nick Alwyn's maiden flight of the shaft!  Hollo, puissant archer, take care of the goslings yonder!  Look this way when thou pull'st, and then woe to the other side!\"  Venting these and many similar specimens of the humour of Cockaigne, the apprentices, however, followed their quondam colleague, and elbowed their way into the crowd gathered around the competitors at the butt; and it was at this spot, commanding a view of the whole space, that the spectator might well have formed some notion of the vast following of the House of Nevile.  For everywhere along the front lines, everywhere in the scattered groups, might be seen, glistening in the sunlight, the armourial badges of that mighty family.  The Pied Bull, which was the proper cognizance [Pied Bull the cognizance, the Dun Bull's head the crest] of the Neviles, was principally borne by the numerous kinsmen of Earl Warwick, who rejoiced in the Nevile name.  The Lord Montagu, Warwick's brother, to whom the king had granted the forfeit title and estates of the earls of Northumberland, distinguished his own retainers, however, by the special request of the ancient Montagus.--a Gryphon issuant from a ducal crown.  But far more numerous than Bull or Gryphon (numerous as either seemed) were the badges worn by those who ranked themselves among the peculiar followers of the great Earl of Warwick.  The cognizance of the Bear and Ragged Staff, which he assumed in right of the Beauchamps, whom he represented through his wife, the heiress of the lords of Warwick, was worn in the hats of the more gentle and well-born clansmen and followers, while the Ragged Staff alone was worked front and back on the scarlet jackets of his more humble and personal retainers.  It was a matter of popular notice and admiration that in those who wore these badges, as in the wearers of the hat and staff of the ancient Spartans, might be traced a grave loftiness of bearing, as if they belonged to another caste, another race, than the herd of men.  Near the place where the rivals for the silver arrow were collected, a lordly party had reined in their palfreys, and conversed with each other, as the judges of the field were marshalling the competitors.  \"Who,\" said one of these gallants, \"who is that comely young fellow just below us, with the Nevile cognizance of the Bull on his hat?  He has the air of one I should know.\"  \"I never saw him before, my Lord of Northumberland,\" answered one of the gentlemen thus addressed; \"but, pardieu, he who knows all the Neviles by eye must know half England.\"  The Lord Montagu--for though at that moment invested with the titles of the Percy, by that name Earl Warwick's brother is known to history, and by that, his rightful name, he shall therefore be designated in these pages--the Lord Montagu smiled graciously at this remark, and a murmur through the crowd announced that the competition for the silver arrow was about to commence.  The butts, formed of turf, with a small white mark fastened to the centre by a very minute peg, were placed apart, one at each end, at the distance of eleven score yards.  At the extremity where the shooting commenced, the crowd assembled, taking care to keep clear from the opposite butt, as the warning word of \"Fast\" was thundered forth; but eager was the general murmur, and many were the wagers given and accepted, as some well-known archer tried his chance.  Near the butt that now formed the target, stood the marker with his white wand; and the rapidity with which archer after archer discharged his shaft, and then, if it missed, hurried across the ground to pick it up (for arrows were dear enough not to be lightly lost), amidst the jeers and laughter of the bystanders, was highly animated and diverting.  As yet, however, no marksman had hit the white, though many had gone close to it, when Nicholas Alwyn stepped forward; and there was something so unwarlike in his whole air, so prim in his gait, so careful in his deliberate survey of the shaft and his precise adjustment of the leathern gauntlet that protected the arm from the painful twang of the string, that a general burst of laughter from the bystanders attested their anticipation of a signal failure.  \"'Fore Heaven!\" said Montagu, \"he handles his bow an' it were a yard- measure.  One would think he were about to bargain for the bow-string, he eyes it so closely.\"  \"And now,\" said Nicholas, slowly adjusting the arrow, \"a shot for the honour of old Westmoreland!\"  And as he spoke, the arrow sprang gallantly forth, and quivered in the very heart of the white.  There was a general movement of surprise among the spectators, as the marker thrice shook his wand over his head.  But Alwyn, as indifferent to their respect as he had been to their ridicule, turned round and said, with a significant glance at the silent nobles, \"We springals of London can take care of our own, if need be.\"  \"These fellows wax insolent.  Our good king spoils them,\" said Montagu, with a curl of his lip.  \"I wish some young squire of gentle blood would not disdain a shot for the Nevile against the craftsman. How say you, fair sir?\"  And with a princely courtesy of mien and smile, Lord Montagu turned to the young man he had noticed as wearing the cognizance of the First House in England.  The bow was not the customary weapon of the well-born; but still, in youth, its exercise formed one of the accomplishments of the future knight; and even princes did not disdain, on a popular holiday, to match a shaft against the yeoman's cloth-yard.  [At a later period, Henry VIII. was a match for the best bowman in his kingdom.  His accomplishment was hereditary, and distinguished alike his wise father and his pious son.]  The young man thus addressed, and whose honest, open, handsome, hardy face augured a frank and fearless nature, bowed his head in silence, and then slowly advancing to the umpires, craved permission to essay his skill, and to borrow the loan of a shaft and bow.  Leave given and the weapons lent, as the young gentleman took his stand, his comely person, his dress, of a better quality than that of the competitors hitherto, and, above all, the Nevile badge worked in silver on his hat, diverted the general attention from Nicholas Alwyn. A mob is usually inclined to aristocratic predilections, and a murmur of goodwill and expectation greeted him, when he put aside the gauntlet offered to him, and said, \"In my youth I was taught so to brace the bow that the string should not touch the arm; and though eleven score yards be but a boy's distance, a good archer will lay his body into his bow [\"My father taught me to lay my body in my bow,\" etc., said Latimer, in his well-known sermon before Edward VI.,--1549. The bishop also herein observes that \"it is best to give the bow so much bending that the string need never touch the arm.  This,\" he adds, \"is practised by many good archers with whom I am acquainted.\"] as much as if he were to hit the blanc four hundred yards away.\"  \"A tall fellow this!\" said Montagu; \"and one I wot from the North,\" as the young gallant fitted the shaft to the bow.  And graceful and artistic was the attitude he assumed,--the head slightly inclined, the feet firmly planted, the left a little in advance, and the stretched sinews of the bow-hand alone evincing that into that grasp was pressed the whole strength of the easy and careless frame.  The public expectation was not disappointed,--the youth performed the feat considered of all the most dexterous; his arrow, disdaining the white mark, struck the small peg which fastened it to the butts, and which seemed literally invisible to the bystanders.  \"Holy Saint Dunstan! there's but one man who can beat me in that sort that I know of,\" muttered Nicholas, \"and I little expected to see him take a bite out of his own hip.\"  With that he approached his successful rival.  \"Well, Master Marmaduke,\" said he, \"it is many a year since you showed me that trick at your father, Sir Guy's--God rest him!  But I scarce take it kind in you to beat your own countryman!\"  \"Beshrew me!\" cried the youth, and his cheerful features brightened into hearty and cordial pleasure, \"but if I see in thee, as it seems to me, my old friend and foster-brother, Nick Alwyn, this is the happiest hour I have known for many a day.  But stand back and let me look at thee, man.  Thou! thou a tame London trader!  Ha! ha! is it possible?\"  \"Hout, Master Marmaduke,\" answered Nicholas, \"every crow thinks his own baird bonniest, as they say in the North.  We will talk of this anon an' thou wilt honour me.  I suspect the archery is over now.  Few will think to mend that shot.\"  And here, indeed, the umpires advanced, and their chief--an old mercer, who had once borne arms, and indeed been a volunteer at the battle of Towton--declared that the contest was over,--\"unless,\" he added, in the spirit of a lingering fellow-feeling with the Londoner, \"this young fellow, whom I hope to see an alderman one of these days, will demand another shot, for as yet there hath been but one prick each at the butts.\"  \"Nay, master,\" returned Alwyn, \"I have met with my betters,--and, after all,\" he added indifferently, \"the silver arrow, though a"]]]
