It was about as follows:  \"I am naturally anti-Slavery.  If Slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.  I cannot remember when I did not so think and feel, and yet I have never understood that the 'Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling.  \"It was in the oath I took, that I would to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  I could not take the Office without taking the oath.  Nor was it my view that I might take an oath to get power, and break the oath in using the power.  \"I understood, too, that in ordinary and Civil Administration this oath even forbade me to practically indulge my primary abstract judgment on the moral question of Slavery.  I had publicly declared this many times, and in many ways.  \"And I aver that, to this day, I have done no Official act in mere deference to my abstract judgment and feeling on Slavery.  \"I did understand, however, that my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving by every indispensable means, that Government--that Nation, of which that Constitution was the Organic Law.  \"Was it possible to lose the Nation and yet preserve the Constitution?  \"By General Law, life and limb must be protected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life; but a life is never wisely given to save a limb.  I felt that measures, otherwise Unconstitutional, might become lawful, by becoming Indispensable to the Constitution through the preservation of the Nation.  \"Right or wrong, I assumed this ground, and now avow it.  I could not feel that, to the best of my ability, I have even tried to preserve the Constitution, if, to save Slavery, or any minor matter, I should permit the wreck of Government, Country, and Constitution, altogether.  \"When, early in the War, General Fremont attempted Military Emancipation, I forbade it, because I did not then think it an Indispensable Necessity.  \"When, a little later, General Cameron, then Secretary of War, suggested the Arming of the Blacks, I objected, because I did not yet think it an Indispensable Necessity.  \"When, still later, General Hunter attempted Military Emancipation, I again forbade it, because I did not yet think the Indispensable Necessity had come.  \"When in March, and May, and July, 1862, I made earnest and successive appeals to the Border-States to favor compensated Emancipation, I believed the Indispensable Necessity for Military Emancipation and arming the Blacks would come, unless averted by that measure.  \"They declined the proposition, and I was, in my best judgment, driven to the alternative of either surrendering the Union, and with it, the Constitution, or of laying strong hand upon the Colored element.  I chose the latter.  In choosing it, I hoped for greater gain than loss, but of this I was not entirely confident.  \"More than a year of trial now shows no loss by it in our Foreign Relations, none in our home popular sentiment, none in our white Military force, no loss by it anyhow, or anywhere.  On the contrary, it shows a gain of quite a hundred and thirty thousand soldiers, seamen, and laborers.  \"These are palpable facts, about which, as facts, there can be no cavilling.  We have the men; and we could not have had them without the measure.  \"And now let any Union man who complains of this measure, test himself by writing down in one line, that he is for subduing the Rebellion by force of arms; and in the next, that he is for taking one hundred and thirty thousand men from the Union side, and placing them where they would be best for the measure he condemns.  If he cannot face his case so stated, it is only because he cannot face the truth.  \"I add a word which was not in the verbal conversation.  In telling this tale, I attempt no compliment to my own sagacity.  I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now at the end of three years' struggle, the Nation's condition is not what either Party, or any man, devised or expected.  God alone can claim it.  \"Whither it is tending seems plain.  If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North, as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new causes to attest and revere the Justice and goodness of God.                     \"Yours truly,                               \"A. LINCOLN.\"   The 8th of April (1864) turned out to be the decisive field-day in the Senate.  Sumner endeavored to close the debate on that day in a speech remarkable no less for its power and eloquence of statement, its strength of Constitutional exposition, and its abounding evidences of extensive historical research and varied learning, than for its patriotic fervor and devotion to human Freedom.  Toward the end of that great speech, however, he somewhat weakened its force by suggesting a change in the phraseology of the proposed Thirteenth Amendment, so that, instead of almost precisely following the language of the Jeffersonian Ordinance of 1787, as recommended by the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, it should read thus:  \"All Persons are Equal before the Law, so that no person can hold another as a Slave; and the Congress may make all laws necessary and proper to carry this Article into effect everywhere within the United States and the jurisdiction thereof.\"  Mr. Sumner's idea in antagonizing the Judiciary Committee's proposition with this, was to introduce into our Organic Act, distinctive words asserting the \"Equality before the Law\" of all persons, as expressed in the Constitutional Charters of Belgium, Italy and Greece, as well as in the various Constitutions of France--beginning with that of September, 1791, which declared (Art. 1) that \"Men are born and continue Free and Equal in Rights;\" continuing in that of June, 1793, which declares that \"All Men are Equal by Nature and before the Law:\" in that of June, 1814, which declares that \"Frenchmen are Equal before the Law, whatever may be otherwise their title and ranks;\" and in the Constitutional Charter of August, 1830 in similar terms to the last.  \"But,\" said he, \"while desirous of seeing the great rule of Freedom which we are about to ordain, embodied in a text which shall be like the precious casket to the more precious treasure, yet * * * I am consoled by the thought that the most homely text containing such a rule will be more beautiful far than any words of poetry or eloquence, and that it will endure to be read with gratitude when the rising dome of this Capitol, with the Statue of Liberty which surmounts it, has crumbled to dust.\"  Mr. Sumner's great speech, however, by no means ended the debate.  It brought Mr. Powell to his feet with a long and elaborate contention against the general proposition, in the course of which he took occasion to sneer at Sumner's \"most remarkable effort,\" as one of his \"long illogical rhapsodies on Slavery, like:                                '--a Tale                Told by an Idiot, full of sound and fury,                Signifying nothing.'\"  He professed that he wanted \"the Union to be restored with the Constitution as it is;\" that he verily believed the passage of this Amendment would be \"the most effective Disunion measure that could be passed by Congress\"--and, said he, \"As a lover of the Union I oppose it.\"       [This phrase slightly altered, in words, but not in meaning, to      \"The Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is,\" afterward      became the Shibboleth under which the Democratic Party in the      Presidential Campaign of 1864, marched to defeat.]  He endeavored to impute the blame for the War, to the northern Abolitionists, for, said he: \"Had there been no Abolitionists, North, there never would have been a Fire-eater, South,\"--apparently ignoring the palpable fact that had there been no Slavery in the South, there could have been no \"Abolitionists, North.\"  He heatedly denounced the \"fanatical gentlemen\" who desired the passage of this measure; declared they intended by its passage \"to destroy the Institution of Slavery or to destroy the Union,\" and exclaimed: \"Pass this Amendment and you make an impassable chasm, as if you were to put a lake of burning fire, between the adhering States and those who are out. You will then have to make it a War of conquest and extermination before you can ever bring them back under the flag of the Government.  There is no doubt about that proposition.\"  Mr. Sumner, at this point, withdrew his proposed amendment, at the suggestion of Mr. Howard, who expressed a preference \"to dismiss all reference to French Constitutions and French Codes, and go back to the good old Anglo-Saxon language employed by our Fathers, in the Ordinance of 1787, (in) an expression adjudicated upon repeatedly, which is perfectly well understood both by the public and by Judicial Tribunals --a phrase, which is peculiarly near and dear to the people of the Northwestern Territory, from whose soil Slavery was excluded by it.\"       [The following is the language of \"the Ordinance of 1787\" thus      referred to:       \"ART. 6.--There shall be neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude      in the said Territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes,      whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: * * *.\"]  Mr. Davis thereupon made another opposition speech and, at its conclusion, Mr. Saulsbury offered, as a substitute, an Article, comprising no less than twenty sections--that, he said, \"embodied in them some things\" which \"did not meet his personal approbation,\" but he had consented to offer them to the Senate as \"a Compromise\"--as \"a Peace offering.\"  The Saulsbury substitute being voted down, the debate closed with a speech by Mr. McDougall--an eloquent protest from his standpoint, in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7138"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 6 (#8)"],["body","hich, after endorsing the wild statement of Mr. Hendricks that 250,000 of the people of African descent had been prematurely destroyed on the Mississippi, he continued.  \"This policy will ingulf them.  It is as simple a truth as has ever been taught by any history.  The Slaves of ancient time were not the Slaves of a different Race.  The Romans compelled the Gaul and the Celt, brought them to their own Country, and some of them became great poets, and some eloquent orators, and some accomplished wits, and they became citizens of the Republic of Greece, and of the Republic of Rome, and of the Empire.  \"This is not the condition of these persons with whom we are now associated, and about whose affairs we undertake to establish administration.  They can never commingle with us.  It may not be within the reading of some learned Senators, and yet it belongs to demonstrated Science, that the African race and the European are different; and I here now say it as a fact established by science, that the eighth generation of the Mixed race formed by the union of the African and European, cannot continue their species.  Quadroons have few children; with Octoroons reproduction is impossible.  \"It establishes as a law of nature that the African has no proper relation to the European, Caucasian, blood.  I would have them kindly treated.  * * *  Against all such policy and all such conduct I shall protest as a man, in the name of humanity, and of law, and of truth, and of religion.\"  The amendment made, as in Committee of the Whole, having been concurred in, etc., the Joint Resolution, as originally reported by the Judiciary Committee, was at last passed, (April 8th)--by a vote of 38 yeas to 6 nays--Messrs.  Hendricks and McDougall having the unenviable distinction of being the only two Senators, (mis-)representing Free States, who voted against this definitive Charter of American Liberty.       [The full Senate vote, on passing the Thirteenth Amendment, was:       YEAS-Messrs.  Anthony, Brown, Chandler, Clark, Collamer, Conness,      Cowan, Dixon, Doolittle, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Grimes, Hale,      Harding, Harlan, Harris, Henderson, Howard, Howe, Johnson, Lane of      Indiana, Lane of Kansas, Morgan, Morrill, Nesmith, Pomeroy, Ramsey,      Sherman, Sprague, Sumner, Ten Eyck, Trumbull, Van Winkle, Wade,      Wilkinson, Willey, and Wilson--38.

The immortal Charter of Freedom had, as we have seen, with comparative ease, after a ten days' debate, by the power of numbers, run the gauntlet of the Senate; but now it was to be subjected to the much more trying and doubtful ordeal of the House.  What would be its fate there? This was a question which gave to Mr. Lincoln, and the other friends of Liberty and Union, great concern.  It is true that various votes had recently been taken in that body, upon propositions which had an indirect bearing upon the subject of Emancipation, as, for instance, that of the 1st of February, 1864, when, by a vote of 80 yeas to 46 nays, it had adopted a Resolution declaring \"That a more vigorous policy to enlist, at an early day, and in larger numbers, in our Army, persons of African descent, would meet the approbation of the House;\" and that vote, although indirect, being so very nearly a two-thirds vote, was most encouraging.  But, on the other hand, a subsequent Resolution, squarely testing the sense of the House upon the subject, had been carried by much less than a two-thirds vote.  This latter Resolution, offered by Mr. Arnold, after conference with Mr. Lincoln, with the very purpose of making a test, was in these direct terms:  \"Resolved, That the Constitution shall be so amended as to Abolish Slavery in the United States wherever it now exists, and to prohibit its existence in every part thereof forever.\"  The vote, adopting it, was but 78 yeas to 62 nays.  * This vote, therefore, upon the Arnold Resolution, being nowhere near the two-thirds affirmative vote necessary to secure the passage through the House of the Senate Joint Resolution on this subject amendatory of the Constitution, was most discouraging.  It was definite enough, however, to show the necessity of a change from the negative to the affirmative side of at least fifteen votes.  While therefore the outlook was discouraging it was far from hopeless.  The debate in the Senate had already had its effect upon the public mind. That, and the utterances of Mr. Lincoln--and further discussion in the House, it was thought, might produce such a pressure from the loyal constituencies both in the Free and Border Slave-States as to compel success.  But from the very beginning of the year 1864, as if instinctively aware that their Rebel friends were approaching the crisis of their fate, and needed now all the help that their allies of the North could give them, the Anti-War Democrats, in Congress, and out, had been stirring themselves with unusual activity.  In both Houses of Congress, upon all possible occasions, they had been striving, as they still strove, with the venom of their widely-circulated speeches, to poison the loyal Northern and Border-State mind, in the hope that the renomination of Mr. Lincoln might be defeated, the chance for Democratic success at the coming Presidential election be thereby increased, and, if nothing else came of it, the Union Cause be weakened and the Rebel Cause correspondingly strengthened.  At the same time, evidently under secret instructions from their friends, the Conspirators in arms, they endeavored to create heart-burnings and jealousies and ill-feeling between the Eastern (especially the New England) States and the Western States, and unceasingly attacked the Protective-Tariff, Internal Revenue, the Greenback, the Draft, and every other measure or thing upon which the life of the Union depended.  Most of these Northern-Democratic agitators, \"Stealing the livery of Heaven to serve the Devil in,\" endeavored to conceal their treacherous designs under a veneer of gushing lip-loyalty, but that disguise was \"too thin\" to deceive either their contemporaries or those who come after them.  Some of their language too, as well as their blustering manner, strangely brought back to recollection the old days of Slavery when the plantation-whip was cracked in the House, and the air was blue with execration of New England.  Said Voorhees, of Indiana, (January 11, 1864) when the House was considering a Bill \"to increase the Internal Revenue and for other purposes:\"  \"I want to know whether the West has any friends upon the floor of this House?  We pay every dollar that is to be levied by this Tax Bill.  * * *  The Manufacturing Interest pays not a dollar into the public Treasury that stays there.  And yet airs of patriotism are put on here by men representing that interest.  I visited New England last Summer, * * * when I heard the swelling hum of her Manufactories, and saw those who only a short time ago worked but a few hands, now working their thousands, and rolling up their countless wealth, I felt that it was an unhealthy prosperity.  To my mind it presented a wealth wrung from the labor, the sinews, the bone and muscle of the men who till the soil, taxed to an illegitimate extent to foster and support that great System of local wealth.  * * *  I do not intend to stand idly by and see one portion of the Country robbed and oppressed for the benefit of another.\"  And the same day, replying to Mr. Morrill of Vermont, he exclaimed: \"Let him show me that the plethoric, bloated Manufacturers of New England are paying anything to support the Government, and I will recognize it.\"  Washburne, of Illinois got back at this part of Mr. Voorhees's speech rather neatly, by defending the North-west as being \"not only willing to stand taxation\" which had been \"already imposed, but * * * any additional taxation which,\" said he, \"may be necessary to crush out this Rebellion, and to hang the Rebels in the South, and the Rebel sympathizers in the North.\"  And, he pointedly added: \"Complaint has been made against New England.  I know that kind of talk.  I have heard too often that kind of slang about New England.  I heard it here for ten years, when your Barksdales, and your Keitts's, and your other Traitors, now in arms against the Government, filled these Halls with their pestilential assaults not only upon New England, but on the Free North generally.\"  Kelley of Pennsylvania, however, more fitly characterized the speech of Voorhees, when he termed it \"a pretty, indeed a somewhat striking, paraphrase of the argument of Mr. Lamar, the Rebel Agent,--[in 1886, Secretary of the Interior]--to his confreres in Treason, as we find it in the recently published correspondence: 'Drive gold coin out of the Country, and induce undue Importation of Foreign products so as to strike down the Financial System.  You can have no further hope for Foreign recognition.  It is evident the weight of arms is against us; and it is clear that we can only succeed by striking down the Financial System of the Country.' It was an admirable paraphrase of the Instructions of Mr. Lamar to the Rebel Agents in the North.\"  The impression was at this time abroad, and there were not wanting elements of proof, that certain members of Congress were trusted Lieutenants of the Arch-copperhead and Outlaw, Vallandigham.  Certain it is, that many of these leaders, six months before, attended and addressed the great gathering from various parts of the Country, of nearly one hundred thousand Vallandigham-Anti-War Peace-Democrats, at Springfield, Illinois--the very home of Abraham Lincoln--which adopted, during a lull, when they were not yelling themselves hoarse for Vallandigham, a resolution declaring against \"the further offensive prosecution of the War\" as being subversive of the"]]]
