C. FREMONT.  \"THE PRESIDENT.\"   President Lincoln subsequently rejoined, ordering a modification of the proclamation.  His letter ran thus:  \"WASHINGTON, September 11, 1861.  \"SIR: Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just received.  Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your Proclamation of August 30th, I perceived no general objection to it.  \"The particular clause, however, in relation to the Confiscation of Property and the Liberation of Slaves, appeared to me to be objectionable in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress, passed the 6th of last August, upon the same subjects; and hence I wrote you expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly.  \"Your answer, just received, expresses the preference, on your part, that I should make an open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do.  \"It is therefore Ordered, that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed as to conform to, and not to transcend, the provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress entitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary Purposes,' approved August 6, 1861, and that said Act be published at length with this Order.                           \"Your obedient servant,                                    \"A. LINCOLN.  \"Major-General JOHN C. FREMONT.\"   In consequence, however, of the agitation on the subject, the extreme delicacy with which it was thought advisable in the earliest stages of the Rebellion to treat it, and the confusion of ideas among Military men with regard to it, the War Department issued the following General Instructions on the occasion of the departure of the Port Royal Expedition, commanded by General T. W. Sherman:                       \"WAR DEPARTMENT, October 14, 1861.  \"SIR: In conducting Military Operations within States declared by the Proclamation of the President to be in a State of Insurrection, you will govern yourself, so far as Persons held to Service under the laws of such States are concerned, by the principles of the letters addressed by me to Major-General Butler on the 30th of May and the 8th of August, copies of which are herewith furnished to you.  \"As special directions, adapted to special circumstances, cannot be given, much must be referred to your own discretion as Commanding General of the Expedition.  You will, however, in general avail yourself of the services of any Persons, whether Fugitives from Labor or not, who may offer them to the National Government; you will employ such Persons in such services as they may be fitted for, either as ordinary employees, or, if special circumstances seem to require it, in any other capacity with such organization, in squads, companies, or otherwise, as you deem most beneficial to the service.  This, however, not to mean a general arming of them for Military service.  \"You will assure all Loyal masters that Congress will provide just compensation to them for the loss of the services of the Persons so employed.  \"It is believed that the course thus indicated will best secure the substantial rights of Loyal masters, and the benefits to the United States of the services of all disposed to support the Government, while it avoids all interference with the social systems or local Institutions of every State, beyond that which Insurrection makes unavoidable and which a restoration of peaceful relations to the Union, under the Constitution, will immediately remove.                               \"Respectfully,                                    \"SIMON CAMERON,                                    \"Secretary of War.  \"Brigadier-General T. W. SHERMAN, \"Commanding Expedition to the Southern Coast.\"   Brigadier-General Thomas W.  Sherman, acting upon his own interpretation of these instructions, issued a proclamation to the people of South Carolina, upon occupying the Forts at Port Royal, in which he said:  \"In obedience to the orders of the President of these United States of America, I have landed on your shores with a small force of National troops.  The dictates of a duty which, under these circumstances, I owe to a great sovereign State, and to a proud and hospitable people, among whom I have passed some of the pleasantest days of my life, prompt me to proclaim that we have come amongst you with no feelings of personal animosity, no desire to harm your citizens, destroy your property, or interfere with any of your lawful rights or your social or local Institutions, beyond what the causes herein alluded to may render unavoidable.\"  Major-General Wool, at Fortress Monroe, where he had succeeded General Butler, likewise issued a Special Order on the subject of Contrabands, as follows:   \"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, \"FORT MONROE, October 14, 1861. \"[Special Orders No. 72.]  \"All Colored Persons called Contrabands, employed as servants by officers and others residing within Fort Monroe, or outside of the Fort at Camp Hamilton and Camp Butler, will be furnished with their subsistence and at least eight dollars per month for males, and four dollars per month for females, by the officers or others thus employing them.  \"So much of the above-named sums, as may be necessary to furnish clothing, to be decided by the Chief Quartermaster of the Department, will be applied to that purpose, and the remainder will be paid into his hands to create a fund for the support of those Contrabands who are unable to work for their own support.  \"All able-bodied Colored Persons who are under the protection of the troops of this Department, and who are not employed as servants, will be immediately put to work in either the Engineer's or Quartermaster's Department.  \"By command of Major-General Wool:  \"[Signed]  WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE, \"Assistant Adjutant General.\"   He subsequently also issued the following General Order:  \"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, \"FORT MONROE, November 1, 1861. \"[General Orders No. 34.]  \"The following pay and allowances will constitute the valuation of the Labor of the Contrabands at work in the Engineer, Ordnance, Quartermaster, Commissary, and Medical Departments at this Post, to be paid as hereinafter mentioned;  \"Class 1st.--Negro man over eighteen years of age, and able-bodied, ten dollars per month, one ration and the necessary amount of clothing.  \"Class 2d.--Negro boys from 12 to 18 years of age, and sickly and infirm Negro men, five dollars per month, one ration, and the necessary amount of clothing.  \"The Quartermaster will furnish all the clothing.  The Department employing these men will furnish the subsistence specified above, and as an incentive to good behavior (to be withheld at the direction of the chiefs of the departments respectively), each individual of the first class will receive $2 per month, and each individual of the second class $1 per month, for their own use.  The remainder of the money valuation of their Labor, will be turned over to the Quartermaster, who will deduct from it the cost of the clothing issued to them; the balance will constitute a fund to be expended by the Quartermaster under the direction of the Commanding officer of the Department of Virginia for the support of the women and children and those that are unable to work.  \"For any unusual amount of Labor performed, they may receive extra pay, varying in amount from fifty cents to one dollar, this to be paid by the departments employing them, to the men themselves, and to be for their own use.  \"Should any man be prevented from working, on account of sickness, for six consecutive days, or ten days in any one month, one-half of the money value will be paid.  For being prevented from laboring for a longer period than ten days in any one month all pay and allowances cease.  \"By command of Major-General Wool:  \"[Signed]  \"WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE, \"Assistant Adjutant General.\"   On November 13, 1861, Major-General Dix, in a proclamation addressed to the people of Accomac and Northampton Counties, Va., ordered the repulsion of Fugitive Slaves seeking to enter the Union lines, in these words:  \"The Military Forces of the United States are about to enter your Counties as a part of the Union.  They will go among you as friends, and with the earnest hope that they may not, by your own acts, be forced to become your enemies.  They will invade no rights of person or property. On the contrary, your Laws, your Institutions, your Usages, will be scrupulously respected.  There need be no fear that the quietude of any fireside will be disturbed, unless the disturbance is caused by yourselves.  \"Special directions have been given not to interfere with the condition of any Person held to domestic service; and, in order that there may be no ground for mistake or pretext for misrepresent action, Commanders of Regiments and Corps have been instructed not to permit any such Persons to come within their lines.\"  On the 20th of November, 1861, Major General Halleck issued the following Genera., Order--which went even further, in that it expelled, as well as repelled Fugitive Slaves from our lines:   \"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSOURI, \"St. Louis, November 20, 1861. \"[General Orders No. 3.]  \"I.  It has been represented that important information respecting the number and condition of our Forces, is conveyed to the Enemy by means of Fugitive Slaves who are admitted within our lines.  In order to remedy this evil, it is directed that no such Persons be hereafter permitted to enter the lines of any camp, or of any forces on the march; and that any now within such lines be immediately excluded"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7136"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 4 (#6)"],["body","m.\"  This Order was subsequently explained in a letter, of December 8, 1861, from General Halleck to Hon. F. P.  Blair, in which he said:  \" * * * Order No. 3 was in my mind, clearly a Military necessity. Unauthorized persons, black or white, Free or Slaves, must be kept out of our camps, unless we are willing to publish to the Enemy everything we do or intend to do.  It was a Military and not a political order.  I am ready to carry out any lawful instructions in regard to Fugitive Slaves which my superiors may give me, and to enforce any law which Congress may pass.  But I cannot make law, and will not violate it.  You know my private opinion on the policy of Confiscating the Slave Property of Rebels in Arms.  If Congress shall pass it, you may be certain that I shall enforce it.  Perhaps my policy as to the treatment of Rebels and their property is as well set out in Order No. 13, issued the day (December 4, 1861), your letter was written, as I could now describe it.\"  It may be well also to add here, as belonging to this period of doubtfulness touching the status of escaped Slaves, the following communication sent by Secretary Seward to General McClellan, touching \"Contrabands\" in the District of Columbia:   \"DEPARTMENT OF STATE, \"WASHINGTON, December 4, 1861.  \"To Major-General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, Washington:  \"GENERAL: I am directed by the President to call your attention to the following subject:  \"Persons claimed to be held to Service or Labor under the laws of the State of Virginia, and actually employed in hostile service against the Government of the United States, frequently escape from the lines of the Enemy's Forces and are received within the lines of the Army of the Potomac.  \"This Department understands that such Persons afterward coming into the city of Washington are liable to be arrested by the city police, upon the presumption, arising from color, that they are Fugitives from Service or Labor.  \"By the 4th section of the Act of Congress approved August 6, 1861, entitled, 'An Act to Confiscate Property used for Insurrectionary purposes,' such hostile employment is made a full and sufficient answer to any further claim to Service or Labor.  Persons thus employed and escaping are received into the Military protection of the United States, and their arrest as Fugitives from Service or Labor should be immediately followed by the Military arrest of the parties making the seizure.  \"Copies of this communication will be sent to the Mayor of the city of Washington and to the Marshal of the District of Columbia, that any collision between the Civil and Military authorities may be avoided.  \"I am, General, your very obedient,                                \"WILLIAM H. SEWARD.\"                                   CHAPTER XVI.                    \"COMPENSATED GRADUAL EMANCIPATION.\"  Thus far the reader's eye has been able to review in their successive order some of the many difficulties and perplexities which beset the pathway of President Lincoln as he felt his way in the dark, as it were, toward Emancipation.  It must seem pretty evident now, however, that his chief concern was for the preservation of the Union, even though all other things--Emancipation with them--had to be temporarily sacrificed.  Something definite, however, had been already gained.  Congress had asserted its right under the War powers of the Constitution, to release from all claim to Service or Labor those Slaves whose Service or Labor had been used in hostility to the Union.  And while some of the Union Generals obstructed the execution of the Act enforcing that right, by repelling and even as we have seen, expelling, from the Union lines all Fugitive Slaves--whether such as had or had not been used in hostility to us--yet still the cause of Freedom to all, was slowly and silently perhaps, yet surely and irresistibly, marching on until the time when, becoming a chief factor in the determination of the question of \"whether we should have a Country at all,\" it should triumph coincidently with the preservation of the Republic.  But now a new phase of the Slave question arose--a question not involving what to do with Fugitive Slaves of any sort, whether engaged or not engaged in performing services hostile to the Union cause, but what to do with Slaves whom their panic-stricken owners had, for the time being, abandoned in the presence of our Armies.  This question was well discussed in the original draft of the report of the Secretary of War, December 1, 1861 in which Secretary Cameron said:  \"It has become a grave question for determination what shall be done with the Slaves abandoned by their owners on the advance of our troops into Southern territory, as in the Beaufort district of South Carolina. The whole White population therein is six thousand, while the number of Negroes exceeds thirty-two thousand.  The panic which drove their masters in wild confusion from their homes, leaves them in undisputed possession of the soil.  Shall they, armed by their masters, be placed in the field to fight against us, or shall their labor be continually employed in reproducing the means for supporting the Armies of Rebellion?  \"The War into which this Government has been forced by rebellious Traitors is carried on for the purpose of repossessing the property violently and treacherously seized upon by the Enemies of the Government, and to re-establish the authority and Laws of the United States in the places where it is opposed or overthrown by armed Insurrection and Rebellion.  Its purpose is to recover and defend what is justly its own.  \"War, even between Independent Nations, is made to subdue the Enemy, and all that belongs to that Enemy, by occupying the hostile country, and exercising dominion over all the men and things within its territory. This being true in respect to Independent Nations at war with each other, it follows that Rebels who are laboring by force of arms to overthrow a Government, justly bring upon themselves all the consequences of War, and provoke the destruction merited by the worst of crimes.  That Government would be false to National trust, and would justly excite the ridicule of the civilized World, that would abstain from the use of any efficient means to preserve its own existence, or to overcome a rebellious and traitorous Enemy, by sparing or protecting the property of those who are waging War against it.  \"The principal wealth and power of the Rebel States is a peculiar species of Property, consisting of the service or labor of African Slaves, or the descendants of Africans.  This Property has been variously estimated at the value of from seven hundred million to one thousand million dollars.  \"Why should this Property be exempt from the hazards and consequences of a rebellious War?  \"It was the boast of the leader of the Rebellion, while he yet had a seat in the Senate of the United States, that the Southern States would be comparatively safe and free from the burdens of War, if it should be brought on by the contemplated Rebellion, and that boast was accompanied by the savage threat that 'Northern towns and cities would become the victims of rapine and Military spoil,' and that 'Northern men should smell Southern gunpowder and feel Southern steel.'  \"No one doubts the disposition of the Rebels to carry that threat into execution.  The wealth of Northern towns and cities, the produce of Northern farms, Northern workshops and manufactories would certainly be seized, destroyed, or appropriated as Military spoil.  No property in the North would be spared from the hands of the Rebels, and their rapine would be defended under the laws of War.  While the Loyal States thus have all their property and possessions at stake, are the insurgent Rebels to carry on warfare against the Government in peace and security to their own property?  \"Reason and justice and self-preservation forbid that such should be; the policy of this Government, but demand, on the contrary, that, being forced by Traitors and Rebels to the extremity of war, all the rights and powers of war should be exercised to bring it to a speedy end.  \"Those who war against the Government justly forfeit all rights of property, privilege, or security, derived from the Constitution and Laws, against which they are in armed Rebellion; and as the labor and service of their Slaves constitute the chief Property of the Rebels, such Property should share the common fate of War to which they have devoted the property of Loyal citizens.  \"While it is plain that the Slave Property of the South is justly subjected to all the consequences of this Rebellious War, and that the Government would be untrue to its trust in not employing all the rights and powers of War to bring it to a speedy close, the details of the plan for doing so, like all other Military measures, must, in a great degree, be left to be determined by particular exigencies.  The disposition of other property belonging to the Rebels that becomes subject to our arms is governed by the circumstances of the case.  \"The Government has no power to hold Slaves, none to restrain a Slave of his Liberty, or to exact his service.  It has a right, however, to use the voluntary service of Slaves liberated by War from their Rebel masters, like any other property of the Rebels, in whatever mode may be most efficient for the defense of the Government, the prosecution of the War, and the suppression of Rebellion.  It is clearly a right of the Government to arm Slaves when it may become necessary, as it is to take gunpowder from the Enemy; whether it is expedient to do so, is purely a Military question.  The right is unquestionable by the laws of War.  The expediency must be determined by circumstances, keeping in view the great object of overcoming the Rebels, reestablishing the Laws, and restoring Peace to the Nation.  \"It is vain and idle for the Government to carry on this War, or hope to maintain its existence against"]]]
