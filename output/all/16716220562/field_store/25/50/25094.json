Bless me, what a day it has turned out! We are getting summer weather at last. What do you say to going for a drive, Eileen--Ellen, I mean? Black Bess is eating her head off in the stables. I want to go as far as Murphy's place, and you might as well come with me.”  “And I too?” said Nora.  “To be sure, child. Why not? You run round to the stables, Norrie, and give the order.”  Nora instantly left the room, the dogs following her.  “What ails her?” said the Squire, looking at his wife.  “Ails her, Pat? Nothing that I know of.”  “Then you know very little,” was his answer. “I never see that sort of anxious frown between the colleen's brows without knowing there's mischief in the wind. Somebody has been worrying her, and I won't have it.” He put down his great hand with a thump on the nearest table.  “Don't, Pat. You quite shatter my nerves.”  “Bless you and your nerves, Ellen. I want to give them all possible consideration; but I won't have Light o' the Morning worried.”  “You'll spoil that girl; you'll rue it yet.”  “Bless her heart! I couldn't spoil her; she's unspoilable. Did you ever see a sweeter bit of a thing, sound to the core, through and through?”  “Sweet or not,” said the mother, “she has got to learn her lesson of life; and it is no good to be too tender with her; she wants a little bracing.”  “You have been trying that on--eh?”  “Well, not exactly, Pat; but you cannot expect me to keep all our troubles to ourselves. There's that mortgage, you know.”  “Bother the mortgage!” said the Squire. “Why do you harp on things the way you do? I'll manage it right enough. I am going round to see Dan Murphy now; he won't be hard on an old friend.”  “Yes; but have you not to pay up?”  “Some day, I suppose.”  “Now listen, Patrick. Do be reasonable. Whenever I speak of money you fight shy of the subject.”  “I don't--I don't,” said the Squire restlessly; “but I am dead tired. I have had a ride of thirty miles; I want my tea. Where is Nora? Do you mind my calling her? She'll order Pegeen to bring the tea here.”  “No; I won't have it. We'll have tea in the dining room presently. I thought you objected to afternoon tea.”  “So I do, as a rule; but I am mighty dhry--thirsty, I mean, Ellen. Well, all the better; I'll get more to drink in the dining room. Order the tea as soon as you please.”  “Ring the bell, Patrick.”  The Squire strode to the mantelpiece, pulled a bell-cord which hung from the ceiling, a distant bell was heard ringing in noisy fashion, and a moment afterward Pegeen put in her head.  “Come right in, Margaret,” said her mistress.  “Aw! then, I'm sorry, ma'am, I forgot,” said the girl. She came in, hiding both her hands under her apron.  Mrs. O'Shanaghgan uttered an impatient sigh.  “It is impossible to train these creatures,” she said under her breath. Aloud, she gave her order in quiet, impassive tones:  “Tea as soon as possible in the west parlor, and sound the gong when it is ready.”  “Why, then, wasn't I getting it?” said Pegeen. She left the room, leaving the door wide open.  “Just like them,” said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan. “When you want the door open they invariably shut it, and when you want it shut they leave it open.”  “They do that in England too, as far as I can tell,” said the Squire, with a slightly nettled tone in his voice.  “Well, now, Patrick, while we have a few moments to ourselves, I want to know what you mean to do about that ten thousand pounds?”  “I am sure, Ellen, it is more than I can tell you.”  “You will have to pay it, you know.”  “I suppose so, some day. I'll speak to Dan to-night. He is the last man to be hard on a chap.”  “Some more of the land must go,” said the wife in a fretful tone. “Our rent-roll will be still smaller. There will be still less money to educate Terence. I had set my heart on his going to Cambridge or Oxford. You quite forget that he is eighteen now.”  “Cambridge or Oxford!” said the Squire. “Not a bit of it. My son shall either go to Old Trinity or he does without a university education. Cambridge or Oxford indeed! You forget, Ellen, that the lad is my son as well as yours.”  “I don't; but he is half an Englishman, three parts an Englishman, whatever his fatherhood,” said the Squire's wife in a tone of triumph.  “Well, well! he is Terence O'Shanaghgan, for all that, and he will inherit this old place some day.”  “Much there will be for him to inherit.”  Eager steps were heard on the gravel, and the next instant Nora entered by the open window.  “I have given the order,” she said; “Angus will have the trap round in a quarter of an hour.”  “That's right, my girl; you didn't let time drag,” said her father.  “Angus wants you and mother to be quite ready, for he says Black Bess is nearly off her head with spirit. Now, then, mother, shall I go upstairs and bring down your things?”  “I don't mind if you do, Nora; my back aches a good bit.”  “We'll put the air-cushion in the trap,” said the Squire, who, notwithstanding her fine-lady airs, had a great respect and admiration for his wife. “We'll make you right cozy, Ellen, and a rattle through the air will do you a sight of good.”  “May I drive, father?” said Nora.  “You, little one? Suppose you bring Black Bess down on her knees? That horse is worth three hundred pounds, if she's worth a penny.”  “Do you think I would?” said the girl reproachfully. “Now, dad, that is about the cruelest word you have said to your Nora for many a day.”  “Come and give me a hug, colleen,” said the Squire.  Nora ran to him, clasped her arms round his neck, and kissed him once or twice. He had moved away to the other end of the room, and now he looked her full in the face.  “You are fretting about something?”  “Not I--not I,” said the girl; but she flushed.  “Listen to me, colleen,” said the Squire; “if it is that bit of a mortgage, you get it right out of your head. It's not going to worry _me_. I am going this very evening to have a talk with Dan.”  “Oh, if it is Dan Murphy you owe it to,” said the girl.  “Ah, he's all right; he's the right sort; a chip of the old block--eh? He wouldn't be hard on a brother in adversity?”  “He wouldn't if he could help it,” said Nora; but the cloud had not left her sensitive face. Then, seeing that father looked at her with intense anxiety, she made a valiant effort.  “Of course, I believe in you,” she said; “and, indeed, what does the loss of money matter while we are together?”  “Right you are! right you are!” said the Squire, with a laugh. He clapped her on the shoulder. “Trust Light o' the Morning to look at things in the right direction,” he said.     CHAPTER III.   THE WILD MURPHYS.  Terence made his appearance at the tea table. In every respect he was a contrast to Nora. He was very good-looking--strikingly handsome, in fact; tall, with a graceful elegance of deportment which was in striking contrast to the burly figure of the old Squire. His face was of a nut-brown hue; his eyes dark and piercing; his features straight. Young as he was, there were the first indications of a black silky mustache on his short upper lip, and his clustering black curls grew in a high ridge off a lofty brow. Terence had the somewhat languid air which more or less characterized all his mother's movements. He was devoted to her, and took his seat now by her side. She laid her very thin and slender hand on his arm. He did not respond by look or movement to the gesture of affection; but had a very close observer been present he would have noticed that he drew his chair about the tenth of an inch nearer to hers.  Nora and her father at the other end of the table were chattering volubly. Nora's face was all smiles; every vestige of that little cloud which had sat between her dark brows a few moments before had vanished. Her blue eyes were sparkling with fun.  The Squire made brilliant sally after sally, to which she responded with all an Irish girl's aptitude for repartee.  Terence and his mother conversed in low tones.  “Yes, mother,” he was saying, “I had a letter from Uncle George this morning; he wants me to go next week. Do you think you can manage?”  “How long will you be away, Terence?”  “I don't know; a couple of months, perhaps.”  “How much money will it cost?”  “I shall want an evening suit, and a new dress-suit, and something for everyday. These things are disgraceful,” said the lad, just glancing at the frayed coat-sleeve, beneath which showed a linen cuff of immaculate whiteness.  Terence was always the personification of fastidiousness in his dress, and for this trait in his character alone Mrs. O'Shanaghgan adored him.  “You shall have it,” she said--“somehow.”  “Well, I must reply tonight,” he continued. “Shall I ask the governor, or will you?”  “We won't worry him, Terry; I can manage.”  He looked at her a little anxiously.  “You are not going to sell any more of them?” he said.  “There is a gold chain and that diamond ring; I never wear either. I would fifty times rather think that you were enjoying yourself with my relations in England. You are fitted to grace any society. Do not say another word, my boy.”  “You are the very best and noblest mother in the world,” said the lad with enthusiasm.  Meanwhile, Nora and her father continued their gay conversation.  “We will take a basket with us,” said Nora, “and Bridget shall give me a couple of dozen more of those little brown eggs. Mrs. Perch shall have a brood of chicks if I can manage it.”  “Trust the girleen for that,” said the Squire, and then they rose from table.  “Ellen,” he continued, addressing his wife, “have you and Terence done colloguing together? for I hear Black Bess coming to the front door.”  “Oh, hasten, mother; hasten!”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7231"],["title","Light O' the Morning: The Story of an Irish Girl (#2)"],["body"," Nora. “The mare won't stand waiting; she is so fresh she is just ready to fly.”  The next few moments witnessed a scene of considerable bustle. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, with all her English nerves, had plenty of pluck, and would scorn to show even a vestige of fear before the hangers-on, as she called the numerous ragged urchins who appeared from every quarter on each imaginable occasion. Although she was shaking from head to foot with absolute terror at the thought of a drive behind Black Bess, she stepped into her seat in the tall dog-cart without a remark. The mare fidgeted and half reared.  “Whoa! whoa! Black Bess, my beauty!” said the Squire. The groom, a bright-faced lad, with a wisp of yellow hair falling over his forehead, held firmly to the reins. Nora jumped up beside her mother.  “Are you going to drive?” asked that lady.  “Yes, mummy; you know I can. Whoa, Black Bess! it's me,” said the girl. She took the reins in her capable little hands; the Squire sprang up behind, and Black Bess flew down the avenue as if on the wings of the wind.  Mrs. O'Shanaghgan gave one hurried pant of suppressed anguish, and then sat perfectly still, her lips set, her hands tightly locked together. She endured these drives almost daily, but had never yet got accustomed to them. Nora, on the contrary, as they spun through the air, felt her spirits rising; the hot young blood coursed through her veins, and her eyes blazed with fun and happiness. She looked back at her father, who nodded to her briefly.  “That's it, Nora; keep her well in. Now that we are going uphill you can give her her head a bit. Whoa, Black Bess! Whoa!”  The mare, after her first wild canter, settled into a more jog-trot gait, and the dog-cart did not sway so violently from side to side. They were soon careering along a wide, well-made road, which ran for many miles along the top of some high cliffs. Below them, at their feet, the wild Atlantic waves curled and burst in innumerable fountains of spray; the roar of the waves came up to their ears, and the breath of the salt breeze, the freshest and most invigorating in the world, fanned their cheeks. Even Mrs. O'Shanaghgan felt her heart beating less wildly, and ventured to put a question or two to Nora with regard to the clucking hen, Mrs. Perch.  “I have not forgotten the basket, mammy,” said the girl; “and Hannah will put the eggs under the hen tonight.”  “I am quite certain that Hannah mismanaged the last brood,” said Mrs. O'Shanaghgan; “but everything goes wrong at the Castle just now.”  “Oh, mother, hush! he will hear,” said Nora.  “It is just like you, Nora; you wish to keep----”  “Oh, come, now,” said the Squire; “I hear the grumbles beginning. No grumbles when we are having our ride--eh, Ellen? I want you to come back with a hearty appetite for dinner, and a hearty inclination to sleep tonight.”  They drove faster and faster. Occasionally Nora touched the mare the faintest little flick with the end of her long whip. The creature responded to her touch as though girl and horse were one.  At last they drew up outside a dilapidated gate, one hinge of which was off. The Squire jumped down from his seat, came round, and held the horse's head.  “Whoa! whoa!” he said. “Hullo, you, Mike! Why aren't you in your place? Come and open the gate this minute, lad.”  A small boy, with bare feet and ragged trousers, came hurrying, head over heels, down the road. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan shuddered and shut her eyes. The gate was swung open. Nora led the mare skillfully round a somewhat sharp corner, and the next instant they were dashing with headlong speed up a steep avenue. It was neglected; weeds grew all over it, and the adjacent meadows were scarcely distinguishable from the avenue itself.  The Squire ran after the dog-cart, and leaped up while the mare was going at full speed.  “Well done, father!” called back Nora.  “Heaven preserve us!” thought Mrs. O'Shanaghgan, who still sat speechless, and as if made of iron.  At last they reached a long, rambling old house, with many small windows, interspersed with a few of enormous dimensions. These were called parliament windows, and had been put into many houses of that period in order to avoid the window-tax. Most of the windows were open, and out of some of them ragged towels were drying in the evening breeze. About half a dozen dogs, most of which were of mongrel breed, rushed forward at the sound of the wheels, barking vociferously. Nora, with a dexterous touch of her hand, drew the mare up just in front of the mansion, and then sprang lightly to her feet.'  “Now, mother, shall I help you down?”  “You had better find out first if Mrs. Murphy is in,” said the Squire's wife.  A ragged urchin, such as seemed to abound like mushrooms in the place, came and held the reins close to the horse's mouth. The creature stood trembling from the violence of her exertions, and pouring down moisture at every pore. “She wants to be well rubbed down,” said the Squire. “She doesn't get half exercise enough; this will never do. What if I have to make money on her, and she is spoiled?”  The low words which came to his lips were not heard by anyone; there was a frown, very like Nora's own, between his brows. The next moment a small man, with reddish hair, in a very shabby suit of half-worn tweed, appeared on the steps of the front door.  “Hullo, O'Shanaghgan, is that yourself?” he called out. “How are you, Mrs. O'Shanaghgan? Right glad to see you. You'll step inside--won't you? I believe the wife is somewhere round. Neil, my man, go and look for the missus. Tell her that Madam O'Shanaghgan is here, and the Squire. Well, Nora, I suppose you are wanting a chat with Bridget? You won't find her indoors this fine evening.”  “Where is she, Mr. Murphy?” asked the girl. “I do want to have a talk with her.”  “Ah! what's the basket for?”  “I want her to give me some of the pretty brown eggs.”  “Well, go right down there by the sea-path, and you'll find her, as likely as not.”  “Very well,” answered Nora. Slinging her basket on her arm, she started for her walk. As soon as she was out of sight she began to run. Presently she stopped and began whistling “The Wearing of the Green,”  which was responded to in a moment by another voice, sweet as that of a blackbird. She looked to right and left, and presently saw a pair of laughing black eyes looking down at her from beneath the shelter of a huge oak tree.  “Here I am. Will you climb up?” said the voice of Bridget Murphy.  “Give me a hand, and I'll be up with you in a moment,” said Nora. She tossed her basket on the ground; a very firm, little brown hand was extended; and the next moment the girls were seated side by side on a stout branch of the tree.  “Well, and what has brought you along here?” said Bridget.  “I came with father and mother in the dog-cart,” replied Nora. “Father let me drive Black Bess. I had a jolly time; but she did pull a bit--my wrists are quite stiff.”  “I am glad you have come,” said the other girl. “I was having a concert all by myself. I can imitate the thrush, the blackbird, and most of the birds round here. Shall I do the thrush for you?”  Before Nora could speak she began imitating the full liquid notes of the bird to perfection.  “I declare you have a genius for it,” said Nora. “But how are you yourself, Biddy?”  “What should ail me?” replied Biddy. “I never had a care nor a worry nor a trouble yet; the day is long, and my heart is light. I am at peace, and I never had an ache in my body yet. But what is up with you, Nora alannah?”  “It's that mortgage, you know,” said Nora, dropping her voice. “What is your father going to do?”  “Oh, the mortgage,” said Bridget. “Mr. Morgan came down from Dublin yesterday; he and father had a long talk. I don't know. I believe there's worry in the air, and when there is I always steer clear of it.”  “Your father, you mean?”  “I can't tell you; don't question me. I am glad you have come. Can't you stay for the night?”  “No, I can't. I must go back with father and mother. The fact is this, Bridget, I believe your father would do anything in the world for you.”  “I suppose he would. What do you want to coax out of me now? Oh, Nora alannah! don't let us talk of worries. Come down to the sea with me--won't you? I have found the most lovely cave. I mean to explore it with lanterns. You go into the cave, and you can walk in nearly half a mile; and then it takes a sudden turn to the right, and they say there's an entrance into another cave, and just beyond that there's a ghost supposed to be. Some people say it is the home of the O'Shanaghgans' Banshee; but whatever it is, I mean to see all about it.”  “Do you mean the Sea-Nymphs' Cave?” said Nora. “But you can only get to that by crossing the bay.”  “Yes. Well, I am going tomorrow night; the moon is at the full. You will come over and go with me--won't you?”  “Oh! I wish I could.”  “But why can't you? Don't let us worry about fathers and mothers. We're a pair of girls, and must have our own larks. There's Neil and there's Mike; they will get the boat all ready, and we can start off for the cave just when the tide is high; we can only get in then. We'll run the boat in as far as it will go, and we'll see what we'll see. You will come--won't you, Nora?”  “I should like it of all things in the world,” said Nora.  “Well, why not? You can come over tomorrow afternoon, and stay the night here. Just say that I have asked you.”  “But mother does not much like my sleeping out.”  “You mean that she does not like you to sleep at the house of the wild Murphys--that's what you mean, Nora. Then, get away; I don't want to force my company on you. I am as good as any other girl in Ireland; I have the blood of the old Irish kings in my veins; but if you are too proud to come, why----”  “I am not, and you know it,” said Nora; “but mother is an Englishwoman, and she thinks we are all a little rough, you and I into the bargain. All the same, I'll come to-morrow. I do"]]]
