It proceeds to recite that All Men were      Created Equal, and were Endowed by the Creator with the Inalienable      Right to Life, Liberty and the Fruits of honest Toil; that the      Government of the United States was Instituted to Secure those      Rights; that the Constitution declares that No Person shall be      Deprived of Liberty without due Process of Law, and also provides      --article five, clause two--that this Constitution, and the Laws of      the United States made in pursuance thereof, shall be the Supreme      Law of the Land, and the Judges in each State shall be bound      thereby, anything in the Constitution and Laws of any State to the      contrary notwithstanding; that it is now demonstrated by the      Rebellion that Slavery is absolutely incompatible with the Union,      Peace, and General Welfare for which Congress is to Provide; and it      therefore Enacts that All Persons heretofore held in Slavery in any      of the States or Territories of the United States are declared      Freedmen, and are Forever Released from Slavery or Involuntary      Servitude except as Punishment for Crime on due conviction.  On the      same day he introduced another Bill to Protect Freedmen and to      Punish any one for Enslaving them.  These were among his last      Public acts,\"--Cong. Globe, 1st S., 38th C., Pt. 2, p.  1334]  And staunch old Thaddeus Stevens said: \"The change to him, is great gain.  The only regret we can feel is that he did not live to see the salvation of his Country; to see Peace and Union restored, and universal Emancipation given to his native land.  But such are the ways of Providence.  Moses was not permitted to enter the Promised Land with those he had led out of Bondage; he beheld it from afar off, and slept with his fathers.\"  \"The deceased,\" he impressively added, \"needs no perishable monuments of brass or marble to perpetuate his name.  So long as the English language shall be spoken or deciphered, so long as Liberty shall have a worshipper, his name will be known!\"  What influence the death of Owen Lovejoy may have had on the subsequent proceedings touching Emancipation interrupted as we have seen by his demise--cannot be known; but among all the eloquent tributes to his memory called forth by the mournful incident, perhaps none, could he have heard it, would have better pleased him than those two opening sentences of Charles Summer's oration in the Senate--where he said of Owen Lovejoy: \"Could his wishes prevail, he would prefer much that Senators should continue in their seats and help to enact into Law some one of the several Measures now pending to secure the obliteration of Slavery.  Such an Act would be more acceptable to him than any personal tribute,--\" unless it might be these other words, which followed from the same lips: \"How his enfranchised Soul would be elevated even in those Abodes to which he has been removed, to know that his voice was still heard on Earth encouraging, exhorting, insisting that there should be no hesitation anywhere in striking at Slavery; that this unpardonable wrong, from which alone the Rebellion draws its wicked life, must be blasted by Presidential proclamation, blasted by Act of Congress, blasted by Constitutional prohibition, blasted in every possible way, by every available agency, and at every occurring opportunity, so that no trace of the outrage may continue in the institutions of the Land, and especially that its accursed foot-prints may no longer defile the National Statute-book.  Sir, it will be in vain that you pass Resolutions in tribute to him, if you neglect that Cause for which he lived, and do not hearken to his voice!\"                                  CHAPTER XXIII.                   \"THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT\" IN THE SENATE.  During the great debate, which now opened in the Senate, upon the Judiciary Committee's substitute resolution for the Amendment of the Constitution, so as forever to prohibit Slavery within the United States, and to empower Congress to pass such laws as would make that prohibition effective--participated in by Messrs. Trumbull, Wilson, Saulsbury, Davis, Harlan, Powell, Sherman, Clark, Hale, Hendricks, Henderson, Sumner, McDougall and others--the whole history of Slavery was enquired into and laid bare.  Trumbull insisted that Slavery was at the bottom of all the internal troubles with which the Nation had from its birth been afflicted, down to this wicked Rebellion, with all the resulting \"distress, desolation, and death;\" and that by 1860, it had grown to such power and arrogance that \"its advocates demanded the control of the Nation in its interests, failing in which, they attempted its overthrow.\"  He reviewed, at some length, what had been done by our Government with regard to Slavery, since the breaking out of hostilities against us in that mad attempt against the National life; how, \"in the earlier stages of the War, there was an indisposition on the part of the Executive Authority to interfere with Slavery at all;\" how, for a long time, Slaves, escaping to our lines, were driven back to their Rebel masters; how the Act of Congress of July, 1861, which gave Freedom to all Slaves allowed by their Rebel masters to assist in the erection of Rebel works and fortifications, had \"not been executed,\" and, said Mr. Trumbull, \"so far as I am advised, not a single Slave has been set at liberty under it;\" how, \"it was more than a year after its enactment before any considerable number of Persons of African descent were organized and armed\" under the subsequent law of December, 1861, which not only gave Freedom to all Slaves entering our Military lines, or who, belonging to Rebel masters, were deserted by them, or were found in regions once occupied by Rebel forces and later by those of the Union, but also empowered the President to organize and arm them to aid in the suppression of the Rebellion; how, it was not until this law had been enacted that Union officers ceased to expel Slaves coming within our lines--and then only when dismissal from the public service was made the penalty for such expulsion; how, by his Proclamations of Emancipation, of September, 1862, and January, 1863, the President undertook to supplement Congressional action--which had, theretofore, been confined to freeing the Slaves of Rebels, and of such of these only as had come within the lines of our Military power-by also declaring, Free, the Slaves \"who were in regions of country from which the authority of the United States was expelled;\" and how, the \"force and effect\" of these Proclamations were variously understood by the enemies and friends of those measures--it being insisted on the one side that Emancipation as a War-stroke was within the Constitutional War-power of the President as Commander-in-Chief, and that, by virtue of those Proclamations, \"all Slaves within the localities designated become ipso facto Free,\" and on the other, that the Proclamations were \"issued without competent authority,\" and had not effected and could not effect, \"the Emancipation of a single Slave,\" nor indeed could at any time, without additional legislation, go farther than to liberate Slaves coming within the Union Army lines.  After demonstrating that \"any and all these laws and Proclamations, giving to each the largest effect claimed by its friends, are ineffectual to the destruction of Slavery,\" and protesting that some more effectual method of getting rid of that Institution must be adopted, he declared, as his judgment, that \"the only effectual way of ridding the Country of Slavery, so that it cannot be resuscitated, is by an Amendment of the Constitution forever prohibiting it within the jurisdiction of the United States.\"  He then canvassed the chances of adoption of such an Amendment by an affirmative vote of two thirds in each House of Congress, and of its subsequent ratification by three-fourths of the States of the Union, and declared that \"it is reasonable to suppose that if this proposed Amendment passes Congress, it will, within a year, receive the ratification of the requisite number of States to make it a part of the Constitution.\"  His prediction proved correct--but only after a protracted struggle.  Henry Wilson also made a strong speech, but on different grounds.  He held that the Emancipation Proclamations formed, together, a \"complete, absolute, and final decree of Emancipation in Rebel States,\" and, being \"born of Military necessity\" and \"proclaimed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, is the settled and irrepealable Law of the Republic, to be observed, obeyed, and enforced, by Army and Navy, and is the irreversible voice of the Nation.\"  He also reviewed what had been done since the outbreak of the Rebellion, by Congress and the President, by Laws and Proclamations; and, while standing by the Emancipation Proclamations, declared that \"the crowning Act, in this series of Acts, for the restriction and extinction of Slavery in America, is this proposed Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the existence of Slavery in the Republic of the United States.\"  The Emancipation Proclamation, according to his view, only needed enforcement, to give \"Peace and Order, Freedom and Unity, to a now distracted Country;\" but the \"crowning act\" of incorporating this Amendment into the Constitution would do even more than all this, in that it would \"obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the Slave System; its chattelizing, degrading, and bloody codes; its malignant, barbarizing spirit; all it was, and is; everything connected with it or pertaining to it, from the face of the Nation it has scarred with moral desolation, from the bosom of the Country it has reddened with the blood and strewn with the graves of patriotism.\"  While the debate proceeded, President Lincoln watched it with careful interest.

The right man had at last been found--it was believed--to control as well as to lead our Armies.  That man was Ulysses S. Grant.  The grade of Lieutenant General of the Army of the United States--in desuetude since the days of Washington, except by brevet, in the case of Winfield Scott,--having been especially revived by Congress for and filled by the appointment and confirmation of Grant, March 2, 1864, that great soldier immediately came on to Washington, received his commission at the hands of President Lincoln, in the cabinet chamber of the White House, on the 9th, paid a flying visit to the Army of the Potomac, on the 10th, and at once returned to Nashville to plan future movements.  On the 12th, a General Order of the War Department (No.  98) was issued, relieving Major-General Halleck, \"at his own request,\" from duty as \"General-in-Chief\" of the Army, and assigning Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant to \"the command of the Armies of the United States,\" \"the Headquarters of the Army\" to be in Washington, and also with Lieutenant-General Grant in the Field, Halleck being assigned to \"duty, in Washington, as Chief-of-staff of the Army, under the direction of the Secretary of War and the Lieutenant-General commanding.\"  By the same order, Sherman was assigned to the command of the \"Military Division of the Mississippi,\" composed of the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Arkansas; and McPherson to that of the Department and Army of the Tennessee.  On the 23rd of March, Grant was back again at Washington, and at once proceeded to Culpepper Court-house, Virginia, where his Headquarters in the field were, for a time, to be.  Here he completed his plans, and reorganized his Forces, for the coming conflicts, in the South-west and South-east, which were to result in a full triumph to the Union Arms, and Peace to a preserved Union.  It is evident, from the utterances of Mr. Lincoln when Vicksburg fell, that he had then become pretty well satisfied that Grant was \"the coming man,\" to whom it would be safe to confide the management and chief leadership of our Armies.  Chattanooga merely confirmed that belief--as indeed it did that of Union men generally.  But the concurrent judgment of Congress and the President had now, as we have seen, placed Grant in that chief command; and the consequent relief to Mr. Lincoln, in thus having the heavy responsibility of Army-control, long unwillingly exercised by him, taken from his own shoulders and placed upon those of the one great soldier in whom he had learned to have implicit faith,--a faith earned by steady and unvaryingly successful achievements in the Field--must have been most grateful.  Other responsibilities would still press heavily enough upon the President's time and attention.  Questions touching the Military and Civil government of regions of the Enemy's country, conquered by the Union arms; of the rehabilitation or reconstruction of the Rebel States; of a thousand and one other matters, of greater or lesser perplexity, growing out of these and other questions; besides the ever pressing and gigantic problems involved in the raising of enormous levies of troops, and prodigious sums of money, needed in securing, moving, and supplying them, and defraying the extraordinary expenses growing out of the necessary blockade of thousands of miles of Southern Coast, and other Naval movements; not to speak of those expenditures belonging to the more ordinary business transactions of the Government.  But chief of all things claiming his especial solicitude, as we have seen, was this question of Emancipation by Constitutional enactment, the debate upon which was now proceeding in the Senate.  That solicitude was necessarily increased by the bitter opposition to it of Northern Copperheads, and by the attitude of the Border-State men, upon whose final action, the triumph or defeat of this great measure must ultimately depend.  Many of the latter, were, as has already been shown in these pages, loyal men; but the loyalty of some of these to their Country, was still so questionably and so thoroughly tainted with their worshipful devotion to Slavery--although they must have been blind indeed not to have discovered, long ere this, that it was a \"slowly-dying cause\"--that they were ever on the alert to delay, hamper, and defeat, any action, whether Executive or Legislative, and however necessary for the preservation of the Union and the overthrow of its mortal enemies, which, never so lightly, impinged upon their \"sacred Institution.\"  This fact was well set forth, in this very debate, by a Senator from New England--[Wilson of Massachusetts]--when, after adjuring the anti-Slavery men of the age, not to forget the long list of Slavery's crimes, he eloquently proceeded:  \"Let them remember, too, that hundreds of thousands of our countrymen in Loyal States--since Slavery raised the banners of Insurrection, and sent death, wounds, sickness, and sorrow, into the homes of the People--have resisted, and still continue to resist, any measure for the defense of the Nation, if that measure tended to impair the vital and animating powers of Slavery.  They resisted the Act making Free the Slaves used by Rebels for Military purposes; the Confiscation of Rebel property and the Freedom of the Slaves of Rebel masters; the Abolition of Slavery in the Capital of the Nation, and the consecration of the Territories to Free Labor and Free laboring men; the Proclamation of Emancipation; the enlistment of Colored men to fight the battles of the Country; the Freedom of the Black soldier, who is fighting, bleeding, dying for the Country; and the Freedom of his wife and children.  And now, when War has for nearly three years menaced the life of the Nation, bathed the Land in blood, and filled two hundred thousand graves with our slain sons, these men of the Loyal States still cling to the falling fortunes of the relentless and unappeasable Enemy of their Country and its democratic institutions; they mourn, and will not be comforted, over the expiring System, in the Border Slave-States; and, in tones of indignation or of anguish, they utter lamentations over the Proclamation of Emancipation, and the policy that is bringing Rebel States back again radiant with Freedom.\"  Among these \"loyal\" Democratic opponents of Emancipation, in any shape, or any where, were not wanting men--whether from Loyal Northern or Border States--who still openly avowed that Slavery was right; that Rebellion, to preserve its continuance, was justifiable; and that there was no Constitutional method of uprooting it.  Saulsbury of Delaware, was representative and spokesman of this class, and he took occasion during this very debate--[In the Senate, March 31, 1864.]--to defend Slavery as a Divine Institution, which had the sanction both of the Mosaic and Christian Dispensations!       [Said he: \"Slavery had existed under some form or other from the      first period of recorded history.  It dates back even beyond the      period of Abraham, the Father of the Faithful, in whose seed all      the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed.  We find that,      immediately after the Flood, the Almighty, for purposes inscrutable      to us, condemned a whole race to Servitude: 'Vayomer Orur Knoan      Efet Afoatim Yeahio Le-echot:' 'And he said, Cursed be Canaan;      Slave of Slaves he shall be to his brethren.'  It continued among      all people until the advent of the Christian era.  It was      recognized in that New Dispensation, which was to supersede the      Old.  It has the sanction of God's own Apostle; for when Paul sent      back Onesimus to Philemon, whom did he send?  A Freeman?  No, Sir.      He sent his (doulos,) a Slave, born as such, not even his      andrapodon, who was such by captivity in War.  Among all people,      and in all ages, has this Institution, if such it is to be called,      existed, and had the countenance of wise and good men, and even of      the Christian Church itself, until these modern times, up at least      to the Nineteenth Century.  It exists in this Country, and has      existed from the beginning.\"       Mr. Harlan's reply to the position of Mr. Saulsbury that Slavery is      right, is a Divine Institution, etc., was very able and      interesting.  He piled up authority after authority, English as      well as American, to show that there is no support of Slavery--and      especially of the title to services of the adult offspring of a      Slave--at Common Law; and, after also proving, by the mouth of a      favorite son of Virginia, that it has no legal existence by virtue      of any Municipal or Statutory Law, he declared that the only      remaining Law that can be cited for its support is the Levitical      Code\"--as follows:       \"'Both thy Bondmen, and thy Bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall      be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy      Bondmen and Bondmaids.       \"'Moreover, of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among      you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,      which they begat in your land; and they shall be your possession.       \"'And ye shall take them as an Inheritance for your children after      you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your Bondmen      forever.\"'       \"I remark,\" said he, \"in this connection, that the Levitical Code,      or the Hebrew Law, contains a provision for the Naturalization of      Foreigners, whether captives of War, or voluntary emigrants.  By      compliance with the requirements of this law they became citizens,      entitled to all the rights and privileges and immunities of native      Hebrews.  The Hebrew Slave Code, applicable to Enslaved Hebrews, is      in these words:       \"'And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold"]]]
