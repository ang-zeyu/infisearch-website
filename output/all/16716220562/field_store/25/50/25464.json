Accustomed already to kings of a foreign race, and having fared well under Canute, there were many who said, \"What matters who sits on the throne? the king must be equally bound by our laws.\"  Then too was heard the favourite argument of all slothful minds: \"Time enough yet! one battle lost is not England won.  Marry, we shall turn out fast eno' if Harold be beaten.\"  Add to all these causes for apathy and desertion, the haughty jealousies of the several populations not yet wholly fused into one empire.  The Northumbrian Danes, untaught even by their recent escape from the Norwegian, regarded with ungrateful coldness a war limited at present to the southern coasts; and the vast territory under Mercia was, with more excuse, equally supine; while their two young Earls, too new in their command to have much sway with their subject populations, had they been in their capitals, had now arrived in London; and there lingered, making head, doubtless, against the intrigues in favour of the Atheling;--so little had Harold's marriage with Aldyth brought him, at the hour of his dreadest need, the power for which happiness had been resigned!  Nor must we put out of account, in summing the causes which at this awful crisis weakened the arm of England, the curse of slavery amongst the theowes, which left the lowest part of the population wholly without interest in the defense of the land.  Too late--too late for all but unavailing slaughter, the spirit of the country rose amidst the violated pledges, but under the iron heel, of the Norman Master! Had that spirit put forth all its might for one day with Harold, where had been the centuries of bondage!  Oh, shame to the absent--All blessed those present!  There was no hope for England out of the scanty lines of the immortal army encamped on the field of Hastings. There, long on earth, and vain vaunts of poor pride, shall be kept the roll of the robber-invaders.  In what roll are your names, holy Heroes of the Soil?  Yes, may the prayer of the Virgin Queen be registered on high; and assoiled of all sin, O ghosts of the glorious Dead, may ye rise from your graves at the trump of the angel; and your names, lost on earth, shine radiant and stainless amidst the Hierarchy of Heaven!  Dull came the shades of evening, and pale through the rolling clouds glimmered the rising stars; when,--all prepared, all arrayed,--Harold sat with Haco and Gurth, in his tent; and before them stood a man, half French by origin, who had just returned from the Norman camp.  \"So thou didst mingle with the men undiscovered?\" said the King.  \"No, not undiscovered, my lord.  I fell in with a knight, whose name I have since heard as that of Mallet de Graville, who wilily seemed to believe in what I stated, and who gave me meat and drink, with debonnair courtesy.  Then said he abruptly,--'Spy from Harold, thou hast come to see the strength of the Norman.  Thou shalt have thy will--follow me.'  Therewith he led me, all startled I own, through the lines; and, O King, I should deem them indeed countless as the sands, and resistless as the waves, but that, strange as it may seem to thee, I saw more monks than warriors.\"  \"How! thou jestest!\" said Gurth, surprised.  \"No; for thousands by thousands, they were praying and kneeling; and their heads were all shaven with the tonsure of priests.\"  \"Priests are they not,\" cried Harold, with his calm smile, \"but doughty warriors and dauntless knights.\"  Then he continued his questions to the spy; and his smile vanished at the accounts, not only of the numbers of the force, but their vast provision of missiles, and the almost incredible proportion of their cavalry.  As soon as the spy had been dismissed, the King turned to his kinsmen.  \"What think you?\" he said; \"shall we judge ourselves of the foe?  The night will be dark anon--our steeds are fleet--and not shod with iron like the Normans;--the sward noiseless--What think you?\"  \"A merry conceit,\" cried the blithe Leofwine.  \"I should like much to see the boar in his den, ere he taste of my spear-point.\"  \"And I,\" said Gurth, \"do feel so restless a fever in my veins that I would fain cool it by the night air.  Let us go: I know all the ways of the country; for hither have I come often with hawk and hound.  But let us wait yet till the night is more hushed and deep.\"  The clouds had gathered over the whole surface of the skies, and there hung sullen; and the mists were cold and grey on the lower grounds, when the four Saxon chiefs set forth on their secret and perilous enterprise.      \"Knights and riders took they none,      Squires and varlets of foot not one;      All unarmed of weapon and weed,      Save the shield, and spear, and the sword at need.\" [258]  Passing their own sentinels, they entered a wood, Gurth leading the way, and catching glimpses, through the irregular path, of the blazing lights, that shone red over the pause of the Norman war.  William had moved on his army to within about two miles from the farthest outpost of the Saxon, and contracted his lines into compact space; the reconnoiterers were thus enabled, by the light of the links and watchfires, to form no inaccurate notion of the formidable foe whom the morrow was to meet.  The ground [259] on which they stood was high, and in the deep shadow of the wood; with one of the large dykes common to the Saxon boundaries in front, so that, even if discovered, a barrier not easily passed lay between them and the foe.  In regular lines and streets extended huts of branches for the meaner soldiers, leading up, in serried rows but broad vistas, to the tents of the knights, and the gaudier pavilions of the counts and prelates. There, were to be seen the flags of Bretagne and Anjou, of Burgundy, of Flanders, even the ensign of France, which the volunteers from that country had assumed; and right in the midst of this Capital of War, the gorgeous pavilion of William himself, with a dragon of gold before it, surmounting the staff, from which blazed the Papal gonfanon.  In every division they heard the anvils of the armourers, the measured tread of the sentries, the neigh and snort of innumerable steeds.  And along the lines, between hut and tent, they saw tall shapes passing to and from the forge and smithy, bearing mail, and swords, and shafts. No sound of revel, no laugh of wassail was heard in the consecrated camp; all was astir, but with the grave and earnest preparations of thoughtful men.  As the four Saxons halted silent, each might have heard, through the remoter din, the other's painful breathing.  At length, from two tents, placed to the right and left of the Duke's pavilion, there came a sweet tinkling sound, as of deep silver bells. At that note there was an evident and universal commotion throughout the armament.  The roar of the hammers ceased; and from every green hut and every grey tent, swarmed the host.  Now, rows of living men lined the camp-streets, leaving still a free, though narrow passage in the midst.  And, by the blaze of more than a thousand torches, the Saxons saw processions of priests, in their robes and aubes, with censer and rood, coming down the various avenues.  As the priests paused, the warriors knelt; and there was a low murmur as if of confession, and the sign of lifted hands, as if in absolution and blessing.  Suddenly, from the outskirts of the camp, and full in sight, emerged, from one of the cross lanes, Odo of Bayeux himself, in his white surplice, and the cross in his right hand.  Yea, even to the meanest and lowliest soldiers of the armament, whether taken from honest craft and peaceful calling, or the outpourings of Europe's sinks and sewers, catamarans from the Alps, and cut-throats from the Rhine,--yea, even among the vilest and the meanest, came the anointed brother of the great Duke, the haughtiest prelate in Christendom, whose heart even then was fixed on the Pontiff's throne--there he came, to absolve, and to shrive, and to bless.  And the red watchfires streamed on his proud face and spotless robes, as the Children of Wrath knelt around the Delegate of Peace.  Harold's hand clenched firm on the arm of Gurth, and his old scorn of the monk broke forth in his bitter smile and his muttered words.  But Gurth's face was sad and awed.  And now, as the huts and the canvas thus gave up the living, they could indeed behold the enormous disparity of numbers with which it was their doom to contend, and, over those numbers, that dread intensity of zeal, that sublimity of fanaticism, which from one end of that war-town to the other, consecrated injustice, gave the heroism of the martyr to ambition, and blended the whisper of lusting avarice with the self-applauses of the saint!  Not a word said the four Saxons.  But as the priestly procession glided to the farther quarters of the armament, as the soldiers in their neighbourhood disappeared within their lodgments, and the torches moved from them to the more distant vistas of the camp, like lines of retreating stars, Gurth heaved a heavy sigh, and turned his horse's head from the scene.  But scarce had they gained the centre of the wood, than there rose, as from the heart of the armament, a swell of solemn voices.  For the night had now come to the third watch [260], in which, according to the belief of the age, angel and fiend were alike astir, and that church-division of time was marked and hallowed by a monastic hymn.  Inexpressibly grave, solemn, and mournful came the strain through the drooping boughs, and the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7683"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 12 (#7)"],["body","darkness of the air; and it continued to thrill in the ears of the riders till they had passed the wood, and the cheerful watchfires from their own heights broke upon them to guide their way.  They rode rapidly, but still in silence, past their sentries; and, ascending the slopes, where the force lay thick, how different were the sounds that smote them!  Round the large fires the men grouped in great circles, with the ale-horns and flagons passing merrily from hand to hand; shouts of drink-hael and was-hael, bursts of gay laughter, snatches of old songs, old as the days of Athelstan, --varying, where the Anglo-Danes lay, into the far more animated and kindling poetry of the Pirate North,--still spoke of the heathen time when War was a joy, and Valhalla was the heaven.  \"By my faith,\" said Leofwine brightening; \"these are sounds and sights that do a man's heart good, after those doleful ditties, and the long faces of the shavelings.  I vow by St. Alban, that I felt my veins curdling into ice-bolts, when that dirge came through the woodholt. Hollo, Sexwolf, my tall man, lift us up that full horn of thine, and keep thyself within the pins, Master Wassailer; we must have steady feet and cool heads to-morrow.\"  Sexwolf, who, with a band of Harold's veterans, was at full carousal, started up at the young Earl's greetings, and looked lovingly into his smiling face as he reached him the horn.  \"Heed what my brother bids thee, Sexwolf,\" said Harold severely; \"the hands that draw shafts against us to-morrow will not tremble with the night's wassail.\"  \"Nor ours either, my lord the King,\" said Sexwolf, boldly; \"our heads can bear both drink and blows,--and--(sinking his voice into a whisper) the rumour runs that the odds are so against us, that I would not, for all thy fair brother's earldoms, have our men other than blithe tonight.\"  Harold answered not, but moved on, and coming then within full sight of the bold Saxons of Kent, the unmixed sons of the Saxon soil, and the special favourers of the House of Godwin, so affectionate, hearty, and cordial was their joyous shout of his name, that he felt his kingly heart leap within him.  Dismounting, he entered the circle, and with the august frankness of a noble chief, nobly popular, gave to all cheering smile and animating word.  That done, he said more gravely: \"In less than an hour, all wassail must cease,--my bodes will come round; and then sound sleep, my brave merry men, and lusty rising with the lark!\"  \"As you will, as you will, dear our King,\" cried Vebba, as spokesman for the soldiers.  \"Fear us not--life and death, we are yours.\"  \"Life and death yours, and freedom's,\" cried the Kent men.  Coming now towards the royal tent beside the standard, the discipline was more perfect, and the hush decorous.  For round that standard were both the special body-guard of the King, and the volunteers from London and Middlesex; men more intelligent than the bulk of the army, and more gravely aware, therefore, of the might of the Norman sword.  Harold entered his tent, and threw himself on his couch, in deep reverie; his brothers and Haco watched him silently.  At length, Gurth approached; and, with a reverence rare in the familiar intercourse between the two, knelt at his brother's side, and taking Harold's hand in his, looked him full in the face, his eyes moist with tears, and said thus:  \"Oh, Harold! never prayer have I asked of thee, that thou hast not granted: grant me this! sorest of all, it may be, to grant, but most fitting of all for me to press.  Think not, O beloved brother, O honoured King, think not that it is with slighting reverence, that I lay rough hand on the wound deepest at thy heart.  But, however surprised or compelled, sure it is that thou didst make oath to William, and upon the relics of saints; avoid this battle, for I see that thought is now within thy soul; that thought haunted thee in the words of the monk to-day; in the sight of that awful camp to-night;-- avoid this battle! and do not thyself stand in arms against the man to whom the oath was pledged!\"  \"Gurth, Gurth!\" exclaimed Harold, pale and writhing.  \"We,\" continued his brother, \"we at least have taken no oath, no perjury is charged against us; vainly the thunders of the Vatican are launched on our heads.  Our war is just: we but defend our country. Leave us, then, to fight to-morrow; thou retire towards London and raise fresh armies; if we win, the danger is past; if we lose, thou wilt avenge us.  And England is not lost while thou survivest.\"  \"Gurth, Gurth!\" again exclaimed Harold, in a voice piercing in its pathos of reproach.  \"Gurth counsels well,\" said Haco, abruptly; \"there can be no doubt of the wisdom of his words.  Let the King's kinsmen lead the troops; let the King himself with his guard hasten to London and ravage and lay waste the country as he retreats by the way [261]; so that even if William beat us, all supplies will fail him; he will be in a land without forage, and victory here will aid him nought; for you, my liege, will have a force equal to his own, ere he can march to the gates of London.\"  \"Faith and troth, the young Haco speaks like a greybeard; he hath not lived in Rouen for nought,\" quoth Leofwine.  \"Hear him, my Harold, and leave us to shave the Normans yet more closely than the barber hath already shorn.\"  Harold turned ear and eye to each of the speakers, and, as Leofwine closed, he smiled.  \"Ye have chid me well, kinsmen, for a thought that had entered into my mind ere ye spake\"--  Gurth interrupted the King, and said anxiously:  \"To retreat with the whole army upon London, and refuse to meet the Norman till with numbers more fairly matched!\"  \"That had been my thought,\" said Harold, surprised.  \"Such for a moment, too, was mine,\" said Gurth, sadly; \"but it is too late.  Such a measure, now, would have all the disgrace of flight, and bring none of the profits of retreat.  The ban of the Church would get wind; our priests, awed and alarmed, might wield it against us; the whole population would be damped and disheartened; rivals to the crown might start up; the realm be divided.  No, it is impossible!\"  \"Impossible,\" said Harold, calmly.  \"And if the army cannot retreat, of all men to stand firm, surely it is the captain and the King.  I, Gurth, leave others to dare the fate from which I fly!  I give weight to the impious curse of the Pope, by shrinking from its idle blast!  I confirm and ratify the oath, from which all law must absolve me, by forsaking the cause of the land, which I purify myself when I guard! I leave to others the agony of the martyrdom or the glory of the conquest!  Gurth, thou art more cruel than the Norman!  And I, son of Sweyn, I ravage the land committed to my charge, and despoil the fields which I cannot keep!  Oh, Haco, that indeed were to be the traitor and the recreant!  No, whatever the sin of my oath, never will I believe that Heaven can punish millions for the error of one man. Let the bones of the dead war against us; in life, they were men like ourselves, and no saints in the calendar so holy as the freemen who fight for their hearths and their altars.  Nor do I see aught to alarm us even in these grave human odds.  We have but to keep fast these entrenchments; preserve, man by man, our invincible line; and the waves will but split on our rock: ere the sun set to-morrow, we shall see the tide ebb, leaving, as waifs, but the dead of the baffled invader.\"  \"Fare ye well, loving kinsmen; kiss me, my brothers; kiss me on the cheek, my Haco.  Go now to your tents.  Sleep in peace and wake with the trumpet to the gladness of noble war!\"  Slowly the Earls left the King; slowest of all the lingering Gurth; and when all were gone, and Harold was alone, he threw round a rapid, troubled glance, and then, hurrying to the simple imageless crucifix that stood on its pedestal at the farther end of the tent, he fell on his knees, and faltered out, while his breast heaved, and his frame shook with the travail of his passion:  \"If my sin be beyond a pardon, my oath without recall, on me, on me, O Lord of Hosts, on me alone the doom.  Not on them, not on them--not on England!\"     CHAPTER VII.   On the fourteenth of October, 1066, the day of St. Calixtus, the Norman force was drawn out in battle array.  Mass had been said; Odo and the Bishop of Coutance had blessed the troops; and received their vow never more to eat flesh on the anniversary of that day.  And Odo had mounted his snow-white charger, and already drawn up the cavalry against the coming of his brother the Duke.  The army was marshalled in three great divisions.  Roger de Montgommeri and William Fitzosborne led the first; and with them were the forces from Picardy and the countship of Boulogne, and the fiery Franks; Geoffric Martel and the German Hugues (a prince of fame); Aimeri, Lord of Thouars, and the sons of Alain Fergant, Duke of Bretagne, led the second, which comprised the main bulk of the allies from Bretagne, and Maine, and Poitou.  But both these divisions were intermixed with Normans, under their own special Norman chiefs.  The third section embraced the flower of martial Europe, the most renowned of the Norman race; whether those knights bore the French titles into which their ancestral Scandinavian names had been transformed--Sires of Beaufou and Harcourt, Abbeville, and de Molun, Montfichet, Grantmesnil, Lacie, D'Aincourt, and D'Asnieres;--or whether, still preserving, amidst their daintier titles, the old names that had scattered dismay through the seas of the Baltic; Osborne and Tonstain, Mallet and Bulver, Brand and Bruse [262].  And over this division presided Duke William.  Here was the main body of the matchless cavalry, to which, however, orders were given to support either of the other sections, as need might demand.  And with this body were also the reserve.  For it is curious to notice, that William's strategy resembled in much that of the last great"]]]
