A strange expression flitted across his face.  Mathias was an adept in the art of dissimulation, and his face was schooled to tell neither more nor less than he wished.  \"Now, your excellency,\" said the visitor, \"this rascal appears strangely self-possessed.\"  \"He does.\"  \"What does it mean?\"  \"Brag.\"  \"Humph!\"  \"Ah, you do not know him, sir, as well as I do.\"  \"Perhaps not; but it might just be possible that he is in league with some of his comrades outside.\"  The governor smiled incredulously.  \"Impossible.\"  \"What if that scoundrel, Tomaso, of whom we were speaking, should be at work?\"  The prisoner's eyes glistened at this word.  A slight flash of intelligence passed between the prisoner and the visitor.  It was but momentary, and so slight as to be utterly unobserved by either the gaoler or the governor.  \"And if such could be the case, sir, what could he possibly do, eh? What on earth, that's what I ask.\"  \"There's no saying.\"  \"Indeed you're right.\"  \"Only he ought to be well guarded when you change him from one prison to another, or--\"  \"Stop, stop, my dear sir, why change him? He will never leave this place alive,\" said the governor.  \"Never?\"  \"Never!\"  \"But surely you don't keep your prisoners all confined in these stifling places?\"  \"We do, though.\"  \"And never let them breathe the air? Why, it is torture.\"  \"They do breathe the air. At noon every day they are allowed to walk for an hour in the prison yard.\"  \"At noon?\"  \"At noon.\"  The visitor fixed his eyes strangely upon the prisoner.  \"Very good; if I may be allowed to trespass again, I should like to see how this fellow bears himself in the yard amongst his fellow-criminals.\"  \"By all means.\"  \"I'll come, then, at noon.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At noon next day the German traveller was as good as his word.  The governor, full of his wonted courtesy, accompanied him to the yard, where all the prisoners were walking round two and two.  Some of the more desperate men were fastened by a single handcuff to the wrist of another man--a warder.  Of this category was the brigand Mathias.  His companion was a huge fellow, who topped him by a head and shoulders, and their wrists were linked securely together by a strong--if slender--pair of handcuffs.  The visitor's countenance fell when he observed this.  It upset all his plans at one fell swoop.  However, he did not utterly despair, but made an effort to get over the difficulty.  \"Your excellency,\" said he, \"this is indeed cruel.\"  \"What,\" demanded the governor, \"fastening them to the gaoler?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I only order it in special cases, such as that of Mathias.\"  \"He is then very dangerous?\"  \"Well, I scarcely believe that, only such precautions are the established rules.\"  \"I regret that.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Partly on the score of humanity,\" was the reply.  \"Ah, you would be too tender-hearted,\" said the governor.  \"No. But I also regret it because I hoped to see the brigand more like he appears when not under restraint. I suppose you would not like to set him free?\"  The governor shook his head.  \"That is against custom, and I should really not like to do it.\"  The visitor reflected a moment as they walked on.  He could not abandon his scheme now that he had gone so far.  The effort should be made all the same.  They walked up to the porter's lodge beside the gates, where an eager crowd had assembled for a glimpse of the prisoners.  \"And do you open those gates to admit the prisoners?\" asked the visitor innocently.  \"No, sir,\" replied the governor; \"this little side door is all we open. Now watch how it is done. This bar, which is like a lever, stops the door, and renders it immovable, now--hah!\"  The fallacy of his words was shown ere they were fairly uttered.  The visitor whistled in a very peculiar way.  And there was a sudden silent rush at the door in question.  The bar, immovable as it was, fell before that desperate onslaught, and the door was carried off its hinges.  The ragged and miserable-looking mob turned like magic into a crowd of armed desperadoes. And in they pressed.  On they came, tearing down the gates and dashing every thing before them.  The poor gatekeeper was trampled under foot, and the warders and governor got hustled and cruelly handled.  The mob of armed invaders made for Mathias and his companion, and bore them bodily outside the gates.  The brigands then wrenched off the handcuffs.  Once outside the gates, a horse was found waiting.  Suddenly there was a loud cry heard.  \"The soldiers--the soldiers!\"  The whole of the guard-room had turned out.  A charge was made, and it looked as though the rescue of Mathias were likely to cost them dear.  Cries of defiance and rage were heard.  Just when matters were at the worst for the robber band, a deafening explosion was heard, that shook the solid building to its base.  The soldiers turned back and re-formed at their officer's command.  Then it was that the brigands, headed by the sham visitor, Tomaso, found their chance.  Up till now, the retreat had been cut off by the unpleasant appearance of the military.  \"There goes the powder keg under the water gate,\" cried Tomaso. \"Lose not a moment. Follow me.\"  A desperate rush was made, and the brigands got clear of the prison.  The soldiers were divided into two lots, one party being sent in pursuit, the other remaining to guard the prison.  The roll-call of the prisoners made this discovery.  \"How many prisoners have escaped?\" inquired the governor.  \"Three absentees, your excellency,\" said the head man of the prison. \"One is an Italian, calling himself Toro; another an Englishman, calling himself Hunston; and the third, the brigand chief Mathias.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  A DEEP-LAID PLOT.   The news of the escape, or rescue--call it what you will--of the three desperadoes soon became known.  Emily and Mrs. Harvey were much alarmed.  The dogged obstinacy with which attempt after attempt was made by the villains made them imagine they were unsafe in such a lonely place.  Accordingly, a grand consultation was held, the result of which was that the Prince of Limbi was sent into the town to take rooms for the whole party at one of the two hotels the place could boast of.  And the next day they all quitted the villa.  The hotel in which our friends had secured apartments was a large straggling building, right at the extremity of the ill-built street which formed the chief part of the town.  Mr. Mole had been very particular when they went there in his inquiries about the brigands.  Would the party be quite safe from molestation?  The urbane proprietor, with many low bows, assured his excellency the Englishman that there was not the slightest possibility of their being molested.  The other male members of the party really troubled themselves very little about the brigands.  By ten o'clock, the day after the masquerade, hardly a person was stirring in the town.  A casual observer would have said there was literally no one to be seen. But hush!  Soft, cautious footsteps may be heard, and anyone whose eyes are accustomed to the gloom might have seen three figures creeping quietly down the street on the side opposite the hotel. Right over against that building they paused.  \"That is the place\" said one of the three, a giant almost in size.  \"Curse them! they always manage to get comfortable quarters, while I am an outcast,\" said another, who spoke like an Englishman.  \"Death, gentlemen! what better quarters can you desire than my cave, in which you have spent several pleasant evenings?\"  \"Bah! Captain Mathias, you have never tasted the sweets of civilisation.\"  \"And, Signor Hunstani, how much the better are you through having tasted those sweets?\"  \"Peace, peace!\" growled the giant. \"Let us unite in thought and action, and to-night obtain our long-sought revenge.\"  \"Well, Toro, I am sure I don't want to quarrel with anyone, except Harkaway.\"  \"Curse him! and especially that American.\"  \"Hush! let your curses be not loud but deep; you'll awake the town if you swear so.\"  \"Have I not good cause to? Has he not beaten and put me to shame?\"  \"And have I not suffered equal pain and shame? Yet I am content to bide my time; you should have patience, Toro.\"  \"Come, come to business, my friends,\" said Captain Mathias; \"there is the house where our foe resides. How are we to proceed?\"  \"Quietly; hush!\" said Hunston. \"Confound it, how still the air is; the whole street seems to echo back the lightest whisper.\"  \"Let me get once inside, and I care not if all the street hears,\" muttered Toro.  \"Which proves you care not if you are unsuccessful,\" said the Greek.  \"How so?\"  \"If we are heard, we shall have the whole street in arms against us, and I fancy these Inglesi, with their boys and the blacks, are quite sufficient for the three of us.\"  \"Bah!\" exclaimed Toro.  \"Seriously, though, let us consider how to get into this place,\" said Hunston.  \"There's the door facing us.\"  \"But have you the key?\"  \"No, but I could send my foot through that plank as easily as anything,\" growled Toro.  \"Certainly, and you would undoubtedly alarm the whole household by doing so, whereas we wish to catch them sleeping.\"  \"Well, then, how about the windows?\"  \"Too high to reach,\" said Hunston, \"unless we had a ladder.\"  \"And I doubt if such a thing can be found in the town,\" interposed Captain Mathias.  \"Well, then, let us see what there is at the back of the house. Captain, you have eyes like a cat or an owl; just glance up and down the street to see if there is anyone about.\"  The Greek looked in all directions.  \"Not even a mouse is stirring,\" said he.  So the three villains, drawing their cloaks closely round them, stole silently away from the shelter of the friendly doorway, where the foregoing conversation had taken place, and proceeded round to the back of the hotel.  To reach the point desired, they had, of course, to cross the road, which was tolerably wide, and then skirt a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7343"],["title","The Church and the Empire (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team.

Medley, M.A. Professor of History in the University of Glasgow     EDITORIAL NOTE  While there is a general agreement among the writers as to principles, the greatest freedom as to treatment is allowed to writers in this series. The volumes, for example, are not of the same length. Volume II, which deals with the formative period of the Church, is, not unnaturally, longer in proportion than the others. To Volume VI, which deals with the Reformation, has been allotted a similar extension. The authors, again, use their own discretion in such matters as footnotes and lists of authorities. But the aim of the series, which each writer sets before him, is to tell, clearly and accurately, the story of the Church, as a divine institution with a continuous life.  W. H. Hutton    PREFACE   The late appearance of this volume of the series needs some explanation. Portions of the book have been written at intervals; but it is only the enforced idleness of a long convalescence after illness which has given me the requisite leisure to finish it.  I have tried to avoid overloading my pages with details of political history; but in no period is it so easy to miss the whole lesson of events by an attempt to isolate the special influences which affected the organised society of the Church. The interpretation which I have adopted of the important events at Canossa is not, of course, universally accepted; but the fact that it has seldom found expression in any English work may serve as my excuse.  The Editor of the series, The Rev. W. H. Hutton, has laid me under a deep obligation, first, by his long forbearance, and more lately, by his frequent and careful suggestions over the whole book. It is dangerous for laymen to meddle with questions of technical theology. I trust that, guided by his expert hand, I have not fallen into any recognisable heresy!  Mears Ashby, _October_, 1910.

Its interests are manifold; but they almost all centre round the great struggle between Empire and Papacy, which gives to mediaeval history an unity conspicuously lacking in more modern times. The history of the Church during these three hundred years is more political than at any other period. In order to understand the reason for this it will be well at the outset to sketch in brief outline the political theories propounded in the Middle Ages on the relations of Church and State. So only can we avoid the inevitable confusion of mind which must result from the use of terms familiar in modern life.  [Sidenote: Unity of world.]  Medieval thought, then, drawing its materials from Roman, Germanic and Christian sources, conceived the Universe as _Civitas Dei_, the State of God, embracing both heaven and earth, with God as at once the source, the guide and the ultimate goal. Now this Universe contains numerous parts, one of which is composed of mankind; and the destiny of mankind is identified with that of Christendom. Hence it follows that mankind may be described as the Commonwealth of the Human Race; and unity under one law and one government is essential to the attainment of the divine purpose.  [Sidenote: Duality of organisation.]  But this very unity of the whole Universe gives a double aspect to the life of mankind, which has to be spent in this world with a view to its continuation in the next. Thus God has appointed two separate Orders, each complete in its own sphere, the one concerned with the arrangement of affairs for this life, the other charged with the preparation of mankind for the life to come.  [Sidenote: Relations of Church and State.]  But this dualism of allegiance was in direct conflict with the idea of unity. The two separate Orders were distinguished as _Sacerdotium_ and _Regnum_ or _Imperium_; and the"]]]
