It was pleasant enough to mark the gradual ascendency he gained over my uncle; and the timorous dislike which the good knight entertained for him, yet struggled to conceal.  Perhaps that was the only time in his life in which Sir William Devereux was a hypocrite.  Enough of the priest at present; I return to his charge.  To school we went: our parting with our uncle was quite pathetic; mine in especial. \"Hark ye, Sir Count,\" whispered he (I bore my father's title), \"hark ye, don't mind what the old priest tells you; your real man of wit never wants the musty lessons of schools in order to make a figure in the world.  Don't cramp your genius, my boy; read over my play, and honest George Etherege's 'Man of Mode;' they'll keep your spirits alive, after dozing over those old pages which Homer (good soul!) dozed over before. God bless you, my child; write to me; no one, not even your mother, shall see your letters; and--and be sure, my fine fellow, that you don't fag too hard.  The glass of life is the best book, and one's natural wit the only diamond that can write legibly on it.\"  Such were my uncle's parting admonitions; it must be confessed that, coupled with the dramatic gifts alluded to, they were likely to be of infinite service to the /debutant/ for academical honours.  In fact, Sir William Devereux was deeply impregnated with the notion of his time,--that ability and inspiration were the same thing, and that, unless you were thoroughly idle, you could not be thoroughly a genius. I verily believe that he thought wisdom got its gems, as Abu Zeid al Hassan* declares some Chinese philosophers thought oysters got their pearls, namely, /by gaping/!   * In his Commentary on the account of China by two Travellers.    CHAPTER III.  A CHANGE IN CONDUCT AND IN CHARACTER: OUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL SOMETIMES PRODUCE GOOD EFFECTS; AND ON THE CONTRARY, AN ALTERATION FOR THE BETTER IN MANNERS WILL, NOT UNFREQUENTLY, HAVE AMONGST ITS CAUSES A LITTLE CORRUPTION OF MIND; FOR THE FEELINGS ARE SO BLENDED THAT, IN SUPPRESSING THOSE DISAGREEABLE TO OTHERS, WE OFTEN SUPPRESS THOSE WHICH ARE AMIABLE IN THEMSELVES.  MY twin brother, Gerald, was a tall, strong, handsome boy, blessed with a great love for the orthodox academical studies, and extraordinary quickness of ability.  Nevertheless, he was indolent by nature in things which were contrary to his taste; fond of pleasure; and, amidst all his personal courage, ran a certain vein of irresolution, which rendered it easy for a cool and determined mind to awe or to persuade him.  I cannot help thinking, too, that, clever as he was, there was something commonplace in the cleverness; and that his talent was of that mechanical yet quick nature which makes wonderful boys but mediocre men. In any other family he would have been considered the beauty; in ours he was thought the genius.  My youngest brother, Aubrey, was of a very different disposition of mind and frame of body; thoughtful, gentle, susceptible, acute; with an uncertain bravery, like a woman's, and a taste for reading, that varied with the caprice of every hour.  He was the beauty of the three, and my mother's favourite.  Never, indeed, have I seen the countenance of man so perfect, so glowingly yet delicately handsome, as that of Aubrey Devereux.  Locks, soft, glossy, and twining into ringlets, fell in dark profusion over a brow whiter than marble; his eyes were black and tender as a Georgian girl's; his lips, his teeth, the contour of his face, were all cast in the same feminine and faultless mould; his hands would have shamed those of Madame de la Tisseur, whose lover offered six thousand marks to any European who could wear her glove; and his figure would have made Titania give up her Henchman, and the King of the Fairies be anything but pleased with the exchange.  Such were my two brothers; or, rather (so far as the internal qualities are concerned), such they seemed to me; for it is a singular fact that we never judge of our near kindred so well as we judge of others; and I appeal to any one, whether, of all people by whom he has been mistaken, he has not been most often mistaken by those with whom he was brought up.  I had always loved Aubrey, but they had not suffered him to love me; and we had been so little together that we had in common none of those childish remembrances which serve, more powerfully than all else in later life, to cement and soften affection.  In fact, I was the scapegoat of the family.  What I must have been in early childhood I cannot tell; but before I was ten years old I was the object of all the despondency and evil forebodings of my relations.  My father said I laughed at /la gloire et le grand monarque/ the very first time he attempted to explain to me the value of the one and the greatness of the other.  The countess said I had neither my father's eye nor her own smile,--that I was slow at my letters and quick with my tongue; and throughout the whole house nothing was so favourite a topic as the extent of my rudeness and the venom of my repartee.  Montreuil, on his entrance into our family, not only fell in with, but favoured and fostered, the reigning humour against me; whether from that /divide et impera/ system, which was so grateful to his temper, or from the mere love of meddling and intrigue, which in him, as in Alberoni, attached itself equally to petty as to large circles, was not then clearly apparent; it was only certain that he fomented the dissensions and widened the breach between my brothers and myself.  Alas! after all, I believe my sole crime was my candour.  I had a spirit of frankness which no fear could tame, and my vengeance for any infantine punishment was in speaking veraciously of my punishers.  Never tell me of the pang of falsehood to the slandered: nothing is so agonizing to the fine skin of vanity as the application of a rough truth!  As I grew older, I saw my power and indulged it; and, being scolded for sarcasm, I was flattered into believing I had wit; so I punned and jested, lampooned and satirized, till I was as much a torment to others as I was tormented myself.  The secret of all this was that I was unhappy.  Nobody loved me: I felt it to my heart of hearts.  I was conscious of injustice, and the sense of it made me bitter.  Our feelings, especially in youth, resemble that leaf which, in some old traveller, is described as expanding itself to warmth, but when chilled, not only shrinking and closing, but presenting to the spectator thorns which had lain concealed upon the opposite side of it before.  With my brother Gerald, I had a deadly and irreconcilable feud.  He was much stouter, taller, and stronger than myself; and, far from conceding to me that respect which I imagined my priority of birth entitled me to claim, he took every opportunity to deride my pretensions, and to vindicate the cause of the superior strength and vigour which constituted his own.  It would have done your heart good to have seen us cuff one another, we did it with such zeal.  There is nothing in human passion like a good brotherly hatred!  My mother said, with the most feeling earnestness, that she used to feel us fighting even before our birth: we certainly lost no time directly after it.  Both my parents were secretly vexed that I had come into the world an hour sooner than my brother; and Gerald himself looked upon it as a sort of juggle,--a kind of jockeyship by which he had lost the prerogative of birthright. This very early rankled in his heart, and he was so much a greater favourite than myself that, instead of rooting out so unfortunate a feeling on his part, my good parents made no scruple of openly lamenting my seniority.  I believe the real cause of our being taken from the domestic instructions of the Abbe (who was an admirable teacher) and sent to school, was solely to prevent my uncle deciding everything in my favour.  Montreuil, however, accompanied us to our academy, and remained with us during the three years in which we were perfecting ourselves in the blessings of education.  At the end of the second year, a prize was instituted for the best proficient at a very severe examination; two months before it took place we went home for a few days.  After dinner my uncle asked me to walk with him in the park.  I did so: we strolled along to the margin of a rivulet which ornamented the grounds.  There my uncle, for the first time, broke silence.  \"Morton,\" said he, looking down at his left leg, \"Morton, let me see; thou art now of a reasonable age,--fourteen at the least.\"  \"Fifteen, if it please you, sir,\" said I, elevating my stature as much as I was able.  \"Humph! my boy; and a pretty time of life it is, too.  Your brother Gerald is taller than you by two inches.\"  \"But I can beat him for all that, uncle,\" said I, colouring, and clenching my fist.  My uncle pulled down his right ruffle.  \"'Gad so, Morton, you're a brave fellow,\" said he; \"but I wish you were less of a hero and more of a scholar.  I wish you could beat him in Greek as well as in boxing.  I will tell you what Old Rowley said,\" and my uncle occupied the next quarter of an hour with a story.  The story opened the good old gentleman's heart; my laughter opened it still more.  \"Hark ye, sirrah!\" said he, pausing abruptly, and grasping my hand with a vigorous effort of love and muscle, \"hark ye, sirrah,--I love you,--'Sdeath, I do.  I love you better than both your brothers, and that crab of a priest into the bargain; but I am grieved to the heart to hear what I do of you. They tell me you are the idlest boy in the school; that you are always beating your brother Gerald, and making a scurrilous jest of your mother or myself.\"  \"Who says so? who dares say so?\" said I, with an emphasis that would have startled a less hearty man than Sir William Devereux.  \"They lie, Uncle; by my soul they do."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7624"],["title","Devereux â€” Volume 01 (#5)"],["body","  Idle I am; quarrelsome with my brother I confess myself; but jesting at you or my mother--never--never.  No, no; /you/, too, who have been so kind to me,--the only one who ever was. No, no; do not think I could be such a wretch:\" and as I said this the tears gushed from my eyes.  My good uncle was exceedingly affected.  \"Look ye, child,\" said he, \"I do not believe them.  'Sdeath, not a word; I would repeat to you a good jest now of Sedley's, 'Gad, I would, but I am really too much moved just at present.  I tell you what, my boy, I tell you what you shall do: there is a trial coming on at school--eh?--well, the Abbe tells me Gerald is certain of being first, and you of being last.  Now, Morton, you shall beat your brother, and shame the Jesuit.  There; my mind's spoken; dry your tears, my boy, and I'll tell you the jest Sedley made: it was in the Mulberry Garden one day--\"  And the knight told his story.  I dried my tears, pressed my uncle's hand, escaped from him as soon as I was able, hastened to my room, and surrendered myself to reflection.  When my uncle so good-naturedly proposed that I should conquer Gerald at the examination, nothing appeared to him more easy; he was pleased to think I had more talent than my brother, and talent, according to his creed, was the only master-key to unlock every science.  A problem in Euclid or a phrase in Pindar, a secret in astronomy or a knotty passage in the Fathers, were all riddles, with the solution of which application had nothing to do.  One's mother-wit was a precious sort of necromancy, which could pierce every mystery at first sight; and all the gifts of knowledge, in his opinion, like reading and writing in that of the sage Dogberry, \"came by nature.\"  Alas! I was not under the same pleasurable delusion; I rather exaggerated than diminished the difficulty of my task, and thought, at the first glance, that nothing short of a miracle would enable me to excel my brother.  Gerald, a boy of natural talent, and, as I said before, of great assiduity in the orthodox studies,--especially favoured too by the instruction of Montreuil,--had long been esteemed the first scholar of our little world; and though I knew that with some branches of learning I was more conversant than himself, yet, as my emulation had been hitherto solely directed to bodily contention, I had never thought of contesting with him a reputation for which I cared little, and on a point in which I had been early taught that I could never hope to enter into any advantageous comparison with the \"genius\" of the Devereuxs.  A new spirit now passed into me: I examined myself with a jealous and impartial scrutiny; I weighed my acquisitions against those of my brother; I called forth, from their secret recesses, the unexercised and almost unknown stores I had from time to time laid up in my mental armoury to moulder and to rust.  I surveyed them with a feeling that they might yet be polished into use; and, excited alike by the stimulus of affection on one side and hatred on the other, my mind worked itself from despondency into doubt, and from doubt into the sanguineness of hope.  I told none of my design; I exacted from my uncle a promise not to betray it; I shut myself in my room; I gave out that I was ill; I saw no one, not even the Abbe; I rejected his instructions, for I looked upon him as an enemy; and, for the two months before my trial, I spent night and day in an unrelaxing application, of which, till then, I had not imagined myself capable.  Though inattentive to the school exercises, I had never been wholly idle.  I was a lover of abstruser researches than the hackneyed subjects of the school, and we had really received such extensive and judicious instructions from the Abbe during our early years that it would have been scarcely possible for any of us to have fallen into a thorough distaste for intellectual pursuits.  In the examination I foresaw that much which I had previously acquired might be profitably displayed,--much secret and recondite knowledge of the customs and manners of the ancients, as well as their literature, which curiosity had led me to obtain, and which I knew had never entered into the heads of those who, contented with their reputation in the customary academical routine, had rarely dreamed of wandering into less beaten paths of learning.  Fortunately too for me, Gerald was so certain of success that latterly he omitted all precaution to obtain it; and as none of our schoolfellows had the vanity to think of contesting with him, even the Abbe seemed to imagine him justified in his supineness.  The day arrived.  Sir William, my mother, the whole aristocracy of the neighbourhood, were present at the trial.  The Abbe came to my room a few hours before it commenced: he found the door locked.  \"Ungracious boy,\" said he, \"admit me; I come at the earnest request of your brother Aubrey to give you some hints preparatory to the examination.\"  \"He has indeed come at my wish,\" said the soft and silver voice of Aubrey, in a supplicating tone: \"do admit him, dear Morton, for my sake!\"  \"Go,\" said I, bitterly, from within, \"go: ye are both my foes and slanderers; you come to insult my disgrace beforehand; but perhaps you will yet be disappointed.\"  \"You will not open the door?\" said the priest.  \"I will not; begone.\"  \"He will indeed disgrace his family,\" said Montreuil, moving away.  \"He will disgrace himself,\" said Aubrey, dejectedly.  I laughed scornfully.  If ever the consciousness of strength is pleasant, it is when we are thought most weak.  The greater part of our examination consisted in the answering of certain questions in writing, given to us in the three days immediately previous to the grand and final one; for this last day was reserved the paper of composition (as it was termed) in verse and prose, and the personal examination in a few showy, but generally understood, subjects. When Gerald gave in his paper, and answered the verbal questions, a buzz of admiration and anxiety went round the room.  His person was so handsome, his address so graceful, his voice so assured and clear, that a strong and universal sympathy was excited in his favour.  The head-master publicly complimented him.  He regretted only the deficiency of his pupil in certain minor but important matters.  I came next, for I stood next to Gerald in our class.  As I walked up the hall, I raised my eyes to the gallery in which my uncle and his party sat.  I saw that my mother was listening to the Abbe, whose eye, severe, cold, and contemptuous, was bent upon me.  But my uncle leaned over the railing of the gallery, with his plumed hat in his hand, which, when he caught my look, he waved gently,--as if in token of encouragement, and with an air so kind and cheering, that I felt my step grow prouder as I approached the conclave of the masters.  \"Morton Devereux,\" said the president of the school, in a calm, loud, austere voice, that filled the whole hall, \"we have looked over your papers on the three previous days, and they have given us no less surprise than pleasure.  Take heed and time how you answer us now.\"  At this speech a loud murmur was heard in my uncle's party, which gradually spread round the hall.  I again looked up: my mother's face was averted; that of the Abbe was impenetrable; but I saw my uncle wiping his eyes, and felt a strange emotion creeping into my own, I turned hastily away, and presented my paper; the head master received it, and, putting it aside, proceeded to the verbal examination. Conscious of the parts in which Gerald was likely to fail, I had paid especial attention to the minutiae of scholarship, and my forethought stood me in good stead at the present moment.  My trial ceased; my last paper was read.  I bowed, and retired to the other end of the hall.  I was not so popular as Gerald; a crowd was assembled round him, but I stood alone.  As I leaned against a column, with folded arms, and a countenance which I felt betrayed little of my internal emotions, my eye caught Gerald's.  He was very pale, and I could see that his hand trembled.  Despite of our enmity, I felt for him.  The worst passions are softened by triumph, and I foresaw that mine was at hand.  The whole examination was over.  Every boy had passed it.  The masters retired for a moment; they reappeared and reseated themselves.  The first sound I heard was that of my own name.  I was the victor of the day: I was more; I was one hundred marks before my brother.  My head swam round; my breath forsook me.  Since then I have been placed in many trials of life, and had many triumphs; but never was I so overcome as at that moment.  I left the hall; I scarcely listened to the applauses with which it rang.  I hurried to my own chamber, and threw myself on the bed in a delirium of intoxicated feeling, which had in it more of rapture than anything but the gratification of first love or first vanity can bestow.  Ah! it would be worth stimulating our passions if it were only for the pleasure of remembering their effect; and all violent excitement should be indulged less for present joy than for future retrospection.  My uncle's step was the first thing which intruded on my solitude.  \"Od's fish, my boy,\" said he, crying like a child, \"this is fine work,--'Gad, so it is.  I almost wish I were a boy myself to have a match with you,--faith I do,--see what it is to learn a little of life! If you had never read my play, do you think you would have done half so well?--no, my boy, I sharpened your wits for you.  Honest George Etherege and I,--we were the making of you! and when you come to be a great man, and are asked what made you so, you shall say, 'My uncle's play;' 'Gad, you shall.  Faith, boy, never smile!  Od's fish, I'll tell you a story as /a propos/ to the present occasion as if it had been made on purpose.  Rochester and I and Sedley were walking one day, and--/entre nous/--awaiting certain appointments--hem!--for my part I"]]]
