After repeated warnings and exhortations to discretion, Hilyard then, whose busy, active mind had made all the necessary arrangements, summoned a stout-looking fellow, whom he had left below, and with his aid conveyed the heavy machine across the garden, to a back lane, where a mule stood ready to receive the burden.  \"Suffer this trusty fellow to guide thee, dear Adam; he will take thee through ways where thy brutal neighbours are not likely to meet and molest thee.  Call all thy wits to the surface.  Speed and prosper!\"  \"Fear not,\" said Adam, disdainfully.  \"In the neighbourhood of kings, science is ever safe.  Bless thee, child,\" and he laid his hand upon Sibyll's head, for she had accompanied them thus far in silence, \"now go in.\"  \"I go with thee, Father,\" said Sibyll, firmly.  \"Master Hilyard, it is best so,\" she whispered; \"what if my father fall into one of his reveries?\"  \"You are right: go with him, at least, to the Tower gate.  Hard by is the house of a noble dame and a worthy, known to our friend Hugh, where thou mayest wait Master Warner's return.  It will not suit thy modesty and sex to loiter amongst the pages and soldiery in the yard. Adam, thy daughter must wend with thee.\"  Adam had not attended to this colloquy, and mechanically bowing his head, he set off, and was greatly surprised, on gaining the river-side (where a boat was found large enough to accommodate not only the human passengers, but the mule and its burden), to see Sibyll by his side.  The imprisonment of the unfortunate Henry, though guarded with sufficient rigour against all chances of escape, was not, as the reader has perceived, at this period embittered by unnecessary harshness.  His attendants treated him with respect, his table was supplied more abundantly and daintily than his habitual abstinence required, and the monks and learned men whom he had favoured, were, we need not repeat, permitted to enliven his solitude with their grave converse.  On the other hand, all attempts at correspondence between Margaret or the exiled Lancastrians and himself had been jealously watched, and when detected, the emissaries had been punished with relentless severity.  A man named Hawkins had been racked for attempting to borrow money for the queen from the great London merchant, Sir Thomas Cook.  A shoemaker had been tortured to death with red-hot pincers for abetting her correspondence with her allies.  Various persons had been racked for similar offences; but the energy of Margaret and the zeal of her adherents were still unexhausted and unconquered.  Either unconscious or contemptuous of the perils to which he was subjected, the student, with his silent companions, performed the voyage, and landed in sight of the Fortress-Palatine.  And now Hugh stopped before a house of good fashion, knocked at the door, which was opened by an old servitor, disappeared for a few moments, and returning, informed Sibyll, in a meaning whisper, that the gentlewoman within was a good Lancastrian, and prayed the donzell to rest in her company till Master Warner's return.  Sibyll, accordingly, after pressing her father's hand without fear-- for she had deemed the sole danger Adam risked was from the rabble by the way--followed Hugh into a fair chamber, strewed with rushes, where an aged dame, of noble air and aspect, was employed at her broidery frame.  This gentlewoman, the widow of a nobleman who had fallen in the service of Henry, received her graciously, and Hugh then retired to complete his commission.  The student, the mule, the model, and the porter pursued their way to the entrance of that part of the gloomy palace inhabited by Henry.  Here they were stopped, and Adam, after rummaging long in vain for the chamberlain's passport, at last happily discovered it, pinned to his sleeve, by Sibyll's forethought.  On this a gentleman was summoned to inspect the order, and in a few moments Adam was conducted to the presence of the illustrious prisoner.  \"And what,\" said a subaltern officer, lolling by the archway of the (now styled) \"Bloody Tower,\" hard by the turret devoted to the prisoner, [The Wakefield Tower] and speaking to Adam's guide, who still mounted guard by the model,--\"what may be the precious burden of which thou art the convoy?\"  \"Marry, sir,\" said Hugh, who spoke in the strong Yorkshire dialect, which we are obliged to render into intelligible English--\"marry, I weet not,--it is some curious puppet-box, or quiet contrivance, that Master Warner, whom they say is a very deft and ingenious personage, is permitted to bring hither for the Lord Henry's diversion.\"  \"A puppet-box!\" said the officer, with much animated curiosity. \"'Fore the Mass! that must be a pleasant sight.  Lift the lid, fellow!\"  \"Please your honour, I do not dare,\" returned Hugh,--\"I but obey orders.\"  \"Obey mine, then.  Out of the way,\" and the officer lifted the lid of the pannier with the point of his dagger, and peered within.  He drew back, much disappointed.  \"Holy Mother!\" said he, \"this seemeth more like an instrument of torture than a juggler's merry device.  It looks parlous ugly!\"  \"Hush!\" said one of the lazy bystanders, with whom the various gateways and courts of the Palace-Fortress were crowded, \"hush--thy cap and thy knee, sir!\"  The officer started; and, looking round, perceived a young man of low stature, followed by three or four knights and nobles, slowly approaching towards the arch, and every cap in the vicinity was off, and every knee bowed.  The eye of this young man was already bent, with a searching and keen gaze, upon the motionless mule, standing patiently by the Wakefield Tower; and turning from the mule to the porter, the latter shrunk, and grew pale, at that dark, steady, penetrating eye, which seemed to pierce at once into the secrets and hearts of men.  \"Who may this young lord be?\" he whispered to the officer.  \"Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, man,\" was the answer.  \"Uncover, varlet!\"  \"Surely,\" said the prince, pausing by the gate, \"surely this is no sumpter-mule, bearing provisions to the Lord Henry of Windsor.  It would be but poor respect to that noble person, whom, alas the day! his grace the king is unwillingly compelled to guard from the malicious designs of rebels and mischief-seekers, that one not bearing the king's livery should attend to any of the needful wants of so worshipful a lord and guest!\"  \"My lord,\" said the officer at the gate, \"one Master Adam Warner hath just, by permission, been conducted to the Lord Henry's presence, and the beast beareth some strange and grim-looking device for my lord's diversion.\"  The singular softness and urbanity which generally characterized the Duke of Gloucester's tone and bearing at that time,--which in a court so full of factions and intrigues made him the enemy of none and seemingly the friend of all, and, conjoined with abilities already universally acknowledged, had given to his very boyhood a pre-eminence of grave repute and good opinion, which, indeed, he retained till the terrible circumstances connected with his accession to the throne, under the bloody name of Richard the Third, roused all men's hearts and reasons into the persuasion that what before had seemed virtue was but dissimulation,--this singular sweetness, we say, of manner and voice, had in it, nevertheless, something that imposed and thrilled and awed.  And in truth, in our common and more vulgar intercourse with life, we must have observed, that where external gentleness of bearing is accompanied by a repute for iron will, determined resolution, and a serious, profound, and all-inquiring intellect, it carries with it a majesty wholly distinct from that charm which is exercised by one whose mildness of nature corresponds with the outward humility; and, if it does not convey the notion of falseness, bears the appearance of that perfect self-possession, that calm repose of power, which intimidates those it influences far more than the imperious port and the loud voice.  And they who best knew the duke, knew also that, despite this general smoothness of mien, his temperament was naturally irritable, quick, and subject to stormy gusts of passion, the which defects his admirers praised him for labouring hard and sedulously to keep in due control.  Still, to a keen observer, the constitutional tendencies of that nervous temperament were often visible, even in his blandest moments, even when his voice was most musical, his smile most gracious.  If something stung or excited him, an uneasy gnawing of the nether lip, a fretful playing with his dagger, drawing it up and down from its sheath, [Pol. Virg. 565] a slight twitching of the muscles of the face, and a quiver of the eyelid, betokened the efforts he made at self-command; and now, as his dark eyes rested upon Hugh's pale countenance, and then glanced upon the impassive mule, dozing quietly under the weight of poor Adam's model, his hand mechanically sought his dagger-hilt, and his face took a sinister and sombre expression.  \"Thy name, friend?\"  \"Hugh Withers, please you, my lord duke.\"  \"Um!  North country, by thine accent.  Dost thou serve this Master Warner?\"  \"No, my lord, I was only hired with my mule to carry--\"  \"Ah, true! to carry what thy pannier contains; open it.  Holy Paul! a strange jonglerie indeed!  This Master Adam Warner,--methinks, I have heard his name--a learned man--um--let me see his safe conduct. Right,--it is Lord Hastings's signature.\"  But still the prince held the passport, and still suspiciously eyed the Eureka and its appliances, which, in their complicated and native ugliness of doors, wheels, pipes, and chimney, were exposed to his view.  At this moment, one of the attendants of Henry descended the stairs of the Wakefield Tower, with a request that the model might be carried up to divert the prisoner.  Richard paused a moment, as the officer hesitatingly watched his countenance"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7717"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 03 (#6)"],["body"," giving the desired permission.  But the prince, turning to him, and smoothing his brow, said mildly, \"Certes! all that can divert the Lord Henry must be innocent pastime.  And I am well pleased that he hath this cheerful mood for recreation.  It gainsayeth those who would accuse us of rigour in his durance.  Yes, this warrant is complete and formal;\" and the prince returned the passport to the officer, and walked slowly on through that gloomy arch ever more associated with Richard of Gloucester's memory, and beneath the very room in which our belief yet holds that the infant sons of Edward IV. breathed their last; still, as Gloucester moved, he turned and turned, and kept his eye furtively fixed upon the porter.  \"Lovell,\" he said to one of the gentlemen who attended him, and who was among the few admitted to his more peculiar intimacy, \"that man is of the North.\"  \"Well, my lord?\"  \"The North was always well affected to the Lancastrians.  Master Warner hath been accused of witchcraft.  Marry, I should like to see his device--um; Master Catesby, come hither,--approach, sir.  Go back, and the instant Adam Warner and his contrivance are dismissed, bring them both to me in the king's chamber.  Thou understandest?  We too would see his device,--and let neither man nor mechanical, when once they reappear, out of thine eye's reach.  For divers and subtle are the contrivances of treasonable men!\"  Catesby bowed, and Richard, without speaking further, took his way to the royal apartments, which lay beyond the White Tower, towards the river, and are long since demolished.  Meanwhile the porter, with the aid of one of the attendants, had carried the model into the chamber of the august captive.  Henry, attired in a loose robe, was pacing the room with a slow step, and his head sunk on his bosom,--while Adam with much animation was enlarging on the wonders of the contrivance he was about to show him.  The chamber was commodious, and furnished with sufficient attention to the state and dignity of the prisoner; for Edward, though savage and relentless when his blood was up, never descended into the cool and continuous cruelty of detail.  The chamber may yet be seen,--its shape a spacious octagon; but the walls now rude and bare were then painted and blazoned with scenes from the Old Testament.  The door opened beneath the pointed arch in the central side (not where it now does), giving entrance from a small anteroom, in which the visitor now beholds the receptacle for old rolls and papers.  At the right, on entering, where now, if our memory mistake not, is placed a press, stood the bed, quaintly carved, and with hangings of damascene.  At the farther end the deep recess which faced the ancient door was fitted up as a kind of oratory.  And there were to be seen, besides the crucifix and the Mass-book, a profusion of small vessels of gold and crystal, containing the relics, supposed or real, of saint and martyr, treasures which the deposed king had collected in his palmier days at a sum that, in the minds of his followers, had been better bestowed on arms and war-steeds.  A young man named Allerton--one of the three gentlemen personally attached to Henry, to whom Edward had permitted general access, and who, in fact, lodged in other apartments of the Wakefield Tower, and might be said to share his captivity--was seated before a table, and following the steps of his musing master, with earnest and watchful eyes.  One of the small spaniels employed in springing game--for Henry, despite his mildness, had been fond of all the sports of the field-- lay curled round on the floor, but started up, with a shrill bark, at the entrance of the bearer of the model, while a starling in a cage by the window, seemingly delighted at the disturbance, flapped his wings, and screamed out, \"Bad men!  Bad world!  Poor Henry!\"  The captive paused at that cry, and a sad and patient smile of inexpressible melancholy and sweetness hovered over his lips.  Henry still retained much of the personal comeliness he possessed at the time when Margaret of Anjou, the theme of minstrel and minne singer, left her native court of poets for the fatal throne of England.  But beauty, usually so popular and precious a gift to kings, was not in him of that order which commanded the eye and moved the admiration of a turbulent people and a haughty chivalry.  The features, if regular, were small; their expression meek and timid; the form, though tall, was not firm-knit and muscular; the lower limbs were too thin, the body had too much flesh, the delicate hands betrayed the sickly paleness of feeble health; there was a dreamy vagueness in the clear soft blue eyes, and a listless absence of all energy in the habitual bend, the slow, heavy, sauntering tread,--all about that benevolent aspect, that soft voice, that resigned mien, and gentle manner, spoke the exquisite, unresisting goodness, which provoked the lewd to taunt, the hardy to despise, the insolent to rebel; for the foes of a king in stormy times are often less his vices than his virtues.  \"And now, good my lord,\" said Adam, hastening, with eager hands, to assist the bearer in depositing the model on the table--\"now will I explain to you the contrivance which it hath cost me long years of patient toil to shape from thought into this iron form.\"  \"But first,\" said Allerton, \"were it not well that these good people withdrew?  A contriver likes not others to learn his secret ere the time hath come to reap its profits.\"  \"Surely, surely!\" said Adam, and alarmed at the idea thus suggested, he threw the folds of his gown over the model.  The attendant bowed and retired; Hugh followed him, but not till he had exchanged a significant look with Allerton.  As soon as the room was left clear to Adam, the captive, and Master Allerton, the last rose, and looking hastily round the chamber, approached the mechanician.  \"Quick, sir!\" said he, in a whisper, \"we are not often left without witnesses.\"  \"Verily,\" said Adam, who had now forgotten kings and stratagems, plots and counterplots, and was all absorbed in his invention, \"verily, young man, hurry not in this fashion,--I am about to begin.  Know, my lord,\" and he turned to Henry, who, with an indolent, dreamy gaze, stood contemplating the Eureka,--\"know that more than a hundred years before the Christian era, one Hero, an Alexandrian, discovered the force produced by the vapour begot by heat on water.  That this power was not unknown to the ancient sages, witness the contrivance, not otherwise to be accounted for, of the heathen oracles; but to our great countryman and predecessor, Roger Bacon, who first suggested that vehicles might be drawn without steeds or steers, and ships might--\"  \"Marry, sir,\" interrupted Allerton, with great impatience, \"it is not to prate to us of such trivial fables of Man, or such wanton sports of the Foul Fiend, that thou hast risked limb and life.  Time is precious.  I have been prevised that thou hast letters for King Henry; produce them, quick!\"  A deep glow of indignation had overspread the enthusiast's face at the commencement of this address; but the close reminded him, in truth, of his errand.  \"Hot youth,\" said he, with dignity, \"a future age may judge differently of what thou deemest trivial fables, and may rate high this poor invention when the brawls of York and Lancaster are forgotten.\"  \"Hear him,\" said Henry, with a soft smile, and laying his hand on the shoulder of the young man, who was about to utter a passionate and scornful retort,--\"hear him,  sir.  Have I not often and ever said this same thing to thee?  We children of a day imagine our contests are the sole things that move the world.  Alack! our fathers thought the same; and they and their turmoils sleep forgotten!  Nay, Master Warner,\"--for here Adam, poor man, awed by Henry's mildness into shame at his discourteous vaunting, began to apologize,--\"nay, sir, nay-- thou art right to contemn our bloody and futile struggles for a crown of thorns; for--\"      'Kingdoms are but cares,        State is devoid of stay      Riches are ready snares,        And hasten to decay.'  [Lines ascribed to Henry VI., with commendation \"as a prettie verse,\" by Sir John Harrington, in the \"Nugae Antiquate.\"  They are also given, with little alteration, to the unhappy king by Baldwin, in his tragedy of \"King Henry VI.\"]  \"And yet, sir, believe me, thou hast no cause for vain glory in thine own craft and labours; for to wit and to lere there are the same vanity and vexation of spirit as to war and empire.  Only, O would-be wise man, only when we muse on Heaven do our souls ascend from the fowler's snare!\"  \"My saint-like liege,\" said Allerton, bowing low, and with tears in his eyes, \"thinkest thou not that thy very disdain of thy rights makes thee more worthy of them?  If not for thine, for thy son's sake, remember that the usurper sits on the throne of the conqueror of Agincourt!--Sir Clerk, the letters.\"  Adam, already anxious to retrieve the error of his first forgetfulness, here, after a moment's struggle for the necessary remembrance, drew the papers from the labyrinthine receptacle which concealed them; and Henry uttered an exclamation of joy as, after cutting the silk, his eye glanced over the writing--  \"My Margaret! my wife!\"  Presently he grew pale, and his hands trembled.  \"Saints defend her!  Saints defend her!  She is here, disguised, in London!\"  \"Margaret! our hero-queen! the manlike woman!\" exclaimed Allerton, clasping his hands.  \"Then be sure that--\"  He stopped, and abruptly taking Adam's arm, drew him aside, while Henry continued to read-- \"Master Warner, we may trust thee,--thou art one of us; thou art sent here, I know; by Robin of Redesdale,--we may trust thee?\"  \"Young sir,\" replied the philosopher, gravely, \"the fears and hopes of power are not amidst the uneasier passions of the student's mind.  I pledged myself but to bear these papers hither, and to return with what "]]]
