Amongst those opposed to the earl, and fit in all qualities to be the head of the new movement,--if the expressive modern word be allowed us,--stood at that moment in the very centre of the chamber Anthony Woodville, in right of the rich heiress he had married the Lord Scales.  As, when some hostile and formidable foe enters the meads where the flock grazes, the gazing herd gather slowly round their leader, so grouped the queen's faction slowly, and by degrees, round this accomplished nobleman, at the prolonged sojourn of Warwick.  \"Gramercy!\" said the Lord Scales, in a somewhat affected intonation of voice, \"the conjunction of the bear and the young lion is a parlous omen, for the which I could much desire we had a wise astrologer's reading.\"  \"It is said,\" observed one of the courtiers, \"that the Duke of Clarence much affects either the lands or the person of the Lady Isabel.\"  \"A passably fair damozel,\" returned Anthony, \"though a thought or so too marked and high in her lineaments, and wholly unlettered, no doubt; which were a pity, for George of Clarence has some pretty taste in the arts and poesies.  But as Occleve hath it--      'Gold, silver, jewel, cloth, beddyng, array,'  would make gentle George amorous of a worse-featured face than high- nosed Isabel; 'strange to spell or rede,' as I would wager my best destrier to a tailor's hobby, the damozel surely is.\"  \"Notest thou yon gaudy popinjay?\" whispered the Lord of St. John to one of his Towton comrades, as, leaning against the wall, they overheard the sarcasms of Anthony, and the laugh of the courtiers, who glassed their faces and moods to his.  \"Is the time so out of joint that Master Anthony Woodville can vent his scurrile japes on the heiress of Salisbury and Warwick in the king's chamber?\"  \"And prate of spelling and reading as if they were the cardinal virtues?\" returned his sullen companion.  \"By my halidame, I have two fair daughters at home who will lack husbands, I trow, for they can only spin and be chaste,--two maidenly gifts out of bloom with the White Rose.\"  In the mean while, unwitting, or contemptuous, of the attention they excited, Warwick and Clarence continued yet more earnestly to confer.  \"No, George, no,\" said the earl, who, as the descendant of John of Gaunt, and of kin to the king's blood, maintained, in private, a father's familiarity with the princes of York, though on state occasions, and when in the hearing of others, he sedulously marked his deference for their rank--\"no, George, calm and steady thy hot mettle, for thy brother's and England's sake.  I grieve as much as thou to hear that the queen does not spare even thee in her froward and unwomanly peevishness.  But there is a glamour in this, believe me, that must melt away soon or late, and our kingly Edward recover his senses.\"  \"Glamour!\" said Clarence; \"thinkest thou, indeed, that her mother, Jacquetta, has bewitched the king?  One word of thy belief in such spells, spread abroad amongst the people, would soon raise the same storm that blew Eleanor Cobham from Duke Humphrey's bed, along London streets in her penance-shift.\"  \"Troth,\" said the earl, indifferently, \"I leave such grave questions as these to prelate and priest; the glamour I spoke of is that of a fair face over a wanton heart; and Edward is not so steady a lover that this should never wear out.\"  \"It amates me much, noble cousin, that thou leavest the court in this juncture.  The queen's heart is with Burgundy, the city's hate is with France; and when once thou art gone, I fear that the king will be teased into mating my sister with the Count of Charolois.\"  \"Ho!\" exclaimed Warwick, with an oath so loud that it rung through the chamber, and startled every ear that heard it.  Then, perceiving his indiscretion, he lowered his tone into a deep and hollow whisper, and griped the prince's arm almost fiercely as he spoke.  \"Could Edward so dishonour my embassy, so palter and juggle with my faith, so flout me in the eyes of Christendom, I would--I would--\" he paused, and relaxed his hold of the duke, and added, with an altered voice--\"I would leave his wife and his lemans, and yon things of silk, whom he makes peers (that is easy) but cannot make men, to guard his throne from the grandson of Henry V.  But thy fears, thy zeal, thy love for me, dearest prince and cousin, make thee misthink Edward's kingly honour and knightly faith.  I go with the sure knowledge that by alliance with France I shut the House of Lancaster from all hope of this roiaulme.\"  \"Hadst thou not better, at least, see my sister Margaret?  She has a high spirit, and she thinks thou mightest, at least, woo her assent, and tell her of the good gifts of her lord to be!\"  \"Are the daughters of York spoiled to this by the manners and guise of a court, in which beshrew me if I well know which the woman and whom the man?  Is it not enough to give peace to broad England, root to her brother's stem?  Is it not enough to wed the son of a king, the descendant of Charlemagne and Saint Louis?  Must I go bonnet in hand and simper forth the sleek personals of the choice of her kith and House; swear the bridegroom's side-locks are as long as King Edward's, and that he bows with the grace of Master Anthony Woodville?  Tell her this thyself, gentle Clarence, if thou wilt: all Warwick could say would but anger her ear, if she be the maid thou bespeakest her.\"  The Duke of Clarence hesitated a moment, and then, colouring slightly, said, \"If, then, the daughter's hand be the gift of her kith alone, shall I have thy favour when the Lady Isabel--\"  \"George,\" interrupted Warwick, with a fond and paternal smile, \"when we have made England safe, there is nothing the son of Richard of York can ask of Warwick in vain.  Alas!\" he added mournfully, \"thy father and mine were united in the same murtherous death, and I think they will smile down on us from their seats in heaven when a happier generation cements that bloody union with a marriage bond!\"  Without waiting for further parlance, the earl turned suddenly away, threw his cap on his towering head, and strode right through the centre of the whispering courtiers, who shrunk, louting low, from his haughty path, to break into a hubbub of angry exclamations or sarcastic jests at his unmannerly bearing, as his black plume disappeared in the arch of the vaulted door.  While such the scene in the interior chambers of the palace, Marmaduke, with the frank simpleness which belonged to his youth and training, had already won much favour and popularity, and he was laughing loud with a knot of young men by the shovel-board when Warwick re-entered.  The earl, though so disliked by the courtiers more immediately about the person of the king, was still the favourite of the less elevated knights and gentry who formed the subordinate household and retainers; and with these, indeed, his manner, so proud and arrogant to his foes and rivals, relapsed at once into the ease of the manly and idolized chief.  He was pleased to see the way made by his young namesake, and lifting his cap, as he nodded to the group and leaned his arm upon Marmaduke's shoulder, he said, \"Thanks, and hearty thanks, to you, knights and gentles, for your courteous reception of an old friend's young son.  I have our king's most gracious permission to see him enrolled one of the court you grace.  Ah, Master Falconer, and how does thy worthy uncle?--braver knight never trod.  What young gentleman is yonder?--a new face and a manly one; by your favour, present him.  The son of a Savile!  Sir, on my return, be not the only Savile who shuns our table of Warwick Court.  Master Dacres, commend me to the lady, your mother; she and I have danced many a measure together in the old time,--we all live again in our children.  Good den to you, sirs.  Marmaduke, follow me to the office,--you lodge in the palace.  You are gentleman to the most gracious and, if Warwick lives, to the most puissant of Europe's sovereigns.  I shall see Montagu at home; he shall instruct thee in thy duties, and requite thee for all discourtesies on the archery-ground.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7717"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 03 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK III.  IN WHICH THE HISTORY PASSES FROM THE KING'S COURT TO THE STUDENT'S CELL, AND RELATES THE PERILS THAT BEFELL A PHILOSOPHER FOR MEDDLING WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD.     CHAPTER I.  THE SOLITARY SAGE AND THE SOLITARY MAID.  While such the entrance of Marmaduke Nevile into a court, that if far less intellectual and refined than those of later days, was yet more calculated to dazzle the fancy, to sharpen the wit, and to charm the senses,--for round the throne of Edward IV. chivalry was magnificent, intrigue restless, and pleasure ever on the wing,--Sibyll had ample leisure in her solitary home to muse over the incidents that had preceded the departure of the young guest. Though she had rejected Marmaduke's proffered love, his tone, so suddenly altered, his abrupt, broken words and confusion, his farewell, so soon succeeding his passionate declaration, could not fail to wound that pride of woman which never sleeps till modesty is gone.  But this made the least cause of the profound humiliation which bowed down her spirit.  The meaning taunt conveyed in the rhyme of the tymbesteres pierced her to the quick; the calm, indifferent smile of the stranger, as he regarded her, the beauty of the dame he attended, woke mingled and contrary feelings, but those of jealousy were perhaps the keenest: and in the midst of all she started to ask herself if indeed she had suffered her vain thoughts to dwell too tenderly upon one from whom the vast inequalities of human life must divide her evermore.  What to her was his indifference?  Nothing,--yet had she given worlds to banish that careless smile from her remembrance.  Shrinking at last from the tyranny of thoughts till of late unknown, her eye rested upon the gipsire which Alwyn had sent her by the old servant.  The sight restored to her the holy recollection of her father, the sweet joy of having ministered to his wants.  She put up the little treasure, intending to devote it all to Warner; and after bathing her heavy eyes, that no sorrow of hers might afflict the student, she passed with a listless step into her father's chamber.  There is, to the quick and mercurial spirits of the young, something of marvellous and preternatural in that life within life, which the strong passion of science and genius forms and feeds,--that passion so much stronger than love, and so much more self-dependent; which asks no sympathy, leans on no kindred heart; which lives alone in its works and fancies, like a god amidst his creations.  The philosopher, too, had experienced a great affliction since they met last. In the pride of his heart he had designed to show Marmaduke the mystic operations of his model, which had seemed that morning to open into life; and when the young man was gone, and he made the experiment alone, alas! he found that new progress but involved him in new difficulties.  He had gained the first steps in the gigantic creation of modern days, and he was met by the obstacle that baffled so long the great modern sage.  There was the cylinder, there the boiler; yet, work as he would, the steam failed to keep the cylinder at work.  And now, patiently as the spider re-weaves the broken web, his untiring ardour was bent upon constructing a new cylinder of other materials.  \"Strange,\" he said to himself, \"that the heat of the mover aids not the movement;\" and so, blundering near the truth, he laboured on.  Sibyll, meanwhile, seated herself abstractedly on a heap of fagots piled in the corner, and seemed busy in framing characters on the dusty floor with the point of her tiny slipper.  So fresh and fair and young she seemed, in that murky atmosphere, that strange scene, and beside that worn man, that it might have seemed to a poet as if the youngest of the Graces were come to visit Mulciber at his forge.  The man pursued his work, the girl renewed her dreams, the dark evening hour gradually stealing over both.  The silence was unbroken, for the forge and the model were now at rest, save by the grating of Adam's file upon the metal, or by some ejaculation of complacency now and then vented by the enthusiast. So, apart from the many-noised, gaudy, babbling world without, even in the midst of that bloody, turbulent, and semi-barbarous time, went on (the one neglected and unknown, the other loathed and hated) the two movers of the ALL that continues the airy life of the Beautiful from age to age,--the Woman's dreaming Fancy and the Man's active Genius.     CHAPTER II.  MASTER ADAM WARNER GROWS A MISER, AND BEHAVES SHAMEFULLY.  For two or three days nothing disturbed the outward monotony of the recluse's household.  Apparently all had settled back as before the advent of the young cavalier.  But Sibyll's voice was not heard singing, as of old, when she passed the stairs to her father's room. She sat with him in his work no less frequently and regularly than before; but her childish spirits no longer broke forth in idle talk or petulant movements, vexing the good man from his absorption and his toils.  The little cares and anxieties, which had formerly made up so much of Sibyll's day by forethought of provision for the morrow, were suspended; for the money transmitted to her by Alwyn in return for the emblazoned manuscripts was sufficient to supply their modest wants for months to come.  Adam, more and more engrossed in his labours, did not appear to perceive the daintier plenty of his board, nor the purchase of some small comforts unknown for years.  He only said one morning, \"It is strange, girl, that as that gathers in life (and he pointed to the model), it seems already to provide, to my fantasy, the luxuries it will one day give to us all in truth.  Methought my very bed last night seemed wondrous easy, and the coverings were warmer, for I woke not with the cold.\"  \"Ah,\" thought the sweet daughter, smiling through moist eyes, \"while my cares can smooth thy barren path through life, why should I cark and pine?\"  Their solitude was now occasionally broken in the evenings by the visits of Nicholas Alwyn.  The young goldsmith was himself not ignorant of the simpler mathematics; he had some talent for invention, and took pleasure in the construction of horologes, though, properly speaking, not a part of his trade.  His excuse for his visits was the wish to profit by Warner's mechanical knowledge; but the student was so rapt in his own pursuits, that he gave but little instruction to his visitor.  Nevertheless Alwyn was satisfied, for he saw Sibyll.  He saw her in the most attractive phase of her character,--the loving, patient, devoted daughter; and the view of her household virtues affected more and more his honest English heart.  But, ever awkward and embarrassed, he gave no vent to his feelings.  To Sibyll he spoke little, and with formal constraint; and the girl, unconscious of her conquest, was little less indifferent to his visits than her abstracted father.  But all at once Adam woke to a sense of the change that had taken place; all at once he caught scent of gold, for his works were brought to a pause for want of some finer and more costly materials than the coins in his own possession (the remnant of Marmaduke's gift) enabled him to purchase.  He had stolen out at dusk, unknown to Sibyll, and lavished the whole upon the model; but in vain!  The model in itself was, indeed, completed; his invention had mastered the difficulty that it had encountered.  But Adam had complicated the contrivance by adding to it experimental proofs of the agency it was intended to exercise.  It was necessary in that age, if he were to convince others, to show more than the principle of his engine,--he must show also something of its effects; turn a mill without wind or water, or set in motion some mimic vehicle without other force than that the contrivance itself supplied.  And here, at every step, new obstacles arose.  It was the misfortune to science in those days, not only that all books and mathematical instruments were enormously dear, but that the students, still struggling into light, through the glorious delusions of alchemy and mysticism, imagined that, even in simple practical operations, there were peculiar virtues in virgin gold and certain precious stones.  A link in the process upon which Adam was engaged failed him; his ingenuity was baffled, his work stood still; and in poring again and again over the learned manuscripts--alas! now lost--in which certain German doctors had sought to explain the pregnant hints of Roger Bacon, he found it inculcated that the axle of a certain wheel must be composed of a diamond.  Now, in truth, it so happened that Adam's contrivance, which (even without the appliances which were added in illustration of the theory) was infinitely more complicated than modern research has found necessary, did not even require the wheel in question, much less the absent diamond; it happened, also, that his understanding, which, though so obtuse in common life, was in these matters astonishingly clear, could not trace any mathematical operations by which the diamond axle would in the least correct the difficulty that had suddenly started up; and yet the accursed diamond began to haunt him,--the German authority was so positive on the point, and that authority had in many respects been accurate.  Nor was this all,--the diamond was to be no vulgar diamond; it was to be endowed, by talismanic skill, with certain properties and virtues; it was to be for a certain number of hours exposed to the rays of the full moon; it was to be washed in a primitive and wondrous elixir, the making of which consumed no little of the finest gold. This diamond was to be to the machine what the soul is to the body,--a glorious, all-pervading, mysterious principle of activity and life. Such were the dreams that obscured the cradle of infant science!  And Adam, with all his reasoning powers, big lore in the hard truths of"]]]
