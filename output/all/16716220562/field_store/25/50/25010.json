The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the Sea\".       [This admirable letter, reviewing \"the situation\" and his policy,      was in these words                           EXECUTIVE MANSION,                     WASHINGTON, August 26.  1863.       HON. JAMES C. CONKLING       MY DEAR SIR; Your letter inviting me to attend a Mass Meeting of      unconditional Union men to be held at the Capital of Illinois, on      the 3rd day of September, has been received.  It would be very      agreeable for me thus to meet my old friends at my own home; but I      cannot just now be absent from here so long a time as a visit there      would require.       The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional      devotion to the Union; and I am sure that my old political friends      will thank me for tendering, as I do, the Nation's gratitude to      those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can      make false to the Nation's life.       There are those who are dissatisfied with me.  To such I would say:      you desire Peace, and you blame me that we do not have it.  But how      can we attain it?  There are but three conceivable ways: First, to      suppress the Rebellion by force of Arms.  This I am trying to do.      Are you for it?  If you are, so far we are agreed.  If you are not      for it, a second way is to give up the Union.  I am against this.      Are you for it?  If you are, you should say so plainly.  If you are      not for Force, nor yet for Dissolution, there only remains some      imaginable Compromise.       I do not believe that any Compromise embracing the maintenance of      the Union is now possible.  All that I learn leads to a directly      opposite belief.  The strength of the Rebellion is its Military,      its Army.  That Army dominates all the Country, and all the people,      within its range.  Any offer of terms made by any man or men within      that range, in opposition to that Army, is simply nothing for the      present: because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce      their side of a Compromise, if one were made with them.       To illustrate: Suppose refugees from the South, and Peace men of      the North, get together in Convention, and frame and proclaim a      Compromise embracing a restoration of the Union.  In what way can      that Compromise be used to keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania?      Meade's Army can keep Lee's Army out of Pennsylvania, and, I think,      can ultimately drive it out of existence.  But no paper Compromise      to which the controllers of Lee's Army are not agreed, can at all      affect that Army.  In an effort at such Compromise we would waste      time, which the Enemy would improve to our disadvantage; and that      would be all.       A Compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who      control the Rebel Army, or with the people, first liberated from      the domination of that Army, by the success of our own Army.  Now,      allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that Rebel      Army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any      Peace Compromise, has ever come to my knowledge or belief.  All      charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and      groundless.  And I promise you that if any such proposition shall      hereafter come, it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from      you.  I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the People,      according to the bond of service, the United States Constitution;      and that, as such, I am responsible to them.       But, to be plain.  You are dissatisfied with me about the Negro.      Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and      myself upon that subject.  I certainly wish that all men could be      Free, while you, I suppose, do not.  Yet I have neither adopted nor      proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view,      provided that you are for the Union.  I suggested compensated      Emancipation; to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to      buy Negroes.  But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy Negroes,      except in such a way as to save you from greater taxation to save      the Union, exclusively by other means.       You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation, and perhaps would have      it retracted.  You say it is Unconstitutional.  I think      differently.  I think the Constitution invests the      Commander-in-Chief with the Law of War in Time of War.  The most      that can be said, if so much, is, that Slaves are property.  Is      there, has there ever been, any question that, by the Law of War,      property, both of enemies and friends, may be taken when needed?      And is it not needed whenever it helps us and hurts the Enemy?      Armies, the World over, destroy enemies' property when they cannot      use it; and even destroy their own to keep it from the Enemy.      Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or      hurt the Enemy, except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel.      Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and      non-combatants, male and female.       But the Proclamation, as law, either is valid or is not valid.  If      it is not valid, it needs no retraction.  If it is valid it cannot      be retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life.  Some      of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for      the Union.  Why better after the retraction than before the issue?      There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the      Rebellion before the Proclamation was issued, the last one hundred      days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming,      unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance.      The War has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the      issue of the Proclamation as before.       I know as fully as one can know the opinions of others that some of      the Commanders of our Armies in the field, who have given us our      most important victories, believe the Emancipation policy and the      use of Colored troops constitute the heaviest blows yet dealt to      the Rebellion, and that at least one of those important successes      could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of Black      soldiers.       Among the Commanders who hold these views are some who have never      had an affinity with what is called \"Abolitionism,\" or with      \"Republican party politics,\" but who hold them purely as Military      opinions.  I submit their opinions as entitled to some weight      against the objections often urged that Emancipation and arming the      Blacks are unwise as Military measures, and were not adopted as      such, in good faith.       You say that you will not fight to Free Negroes.  Some of them seem      willing to fight for you; but no matter.  Fight you, then,      exclusively to save the Union.  I issued the Proclamation on      purpose to aid you in saving the Union.  Whenever you shall have      conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to      continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare      you will not fight to Free Negroes.  I thought that in your      struggle for the Union, to whatever extent the Negroes should cease      helping the Enemy, to that extent it weakened the Enemy in his      resistance to you.  Do you think differently?  I thought whatever      Negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for      White soldiers to do in saving the Union.  Does it appear otherwise      to you?  But Negroes, like other people, act upon motives.  Why      should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?  If      they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the      strongest motives, even the promise of Freedom.  And the promise,      being made, must be kept.       The signs look better.  The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to      the Sea.  Thanks to the great Northwest for it; nor yet wholly to      them.  Three hundred miles up, they met New England, Empire,      Keystone, and Jersey, hewing their way right and left.  The Sunny      South, too, in more colors than one, also lent a helping hand.  On      the spot, their part of the history was jotted down in Black and      White.  The job was a great National one, and let none be slighted      who bore an honorable part in it.  And while those who have cleared      the Great River may well be proud, even that is not all.  It is      hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than      at Antietam, Murfreesboro, Gettysburg, and on many fields of less      note.  Nor must Uncle Sam's web-feet be forgotten.  At all the      watery margins they have been present, not only on the deep Sea,      the broad Bay, and the rapid River, but also up the narrow, muddy      Bayou, and wherever the ground was a little damp they had been, and      made their tracks.  Thanks to all.  For the Great Republic--for the      principle it lives by, and keeps alive--for Man's vast future      --thanks to all.       Peace does not appear so distant as it did.  I hope it will come      soon, and come to stay; and so come as to be worth the keeping in      all future time.  It will then have been proved that among Freemen      there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet,      and that they who take such appeal are sure to lose their case and      pay the cost.  And there will be some Black men who can remember      that, with silent tongue, and clinched teeth, and steady eye, and      well poised bayonet, they have helped mankind on to this great      consummation, while I fear there will be some White ones unable to      forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they have      striven to hinder it.       Still, let us"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7138"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 6 (#2)"],["body","be over sanguine of a speedy, final triumph.  Let      us be quite sober.  Let us diligently apply the means, never      doubting that a just God, in his own good time, will give us the      rightful result.                      Yours very truly,                                    A. LINCOLN.]   But Chattanooga, and the grand majorities in all the Fall State-elections, save that of New Jersey,--and especially the manner in which loyal Ohio sat down upon the chief Copperhead-Democrat and Treason-breeder of the North, Vallandigham--came most auspiciously to strengthen the President's hands.       [The head of the Knights of the Golden Circle, and the Democratic      candidate for Governor of Ohio]  And now he saw, more clearly still, the approach of that time when the solemn promise and declaration of Emancipation might be recorded upon the sacred roll of the Constitution, and thus be made safe for all time.  In his Annual Message of December, 1863, therefore, President Lincoln, after adverting to the fact that \"a year ago the War had already lasted nearly twenty months,\" without much ground for hopefulness, proceeded to say:  \"The preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, issued in September, was running its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year.  A month later the final Proclamation came, including the announcement that Colored men of suitable condition would be received into the War service.  The policy of Emancipation, and of employing Black soldiers, gave to the future a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt, contended in uncertain conflict.  \"According to our political system, as a matter of Civil Administration, the General Government had no lawful power to effect Emancipation in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that the Rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a Military measure.  It was all the while deemed possible that the necessity for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of the contest would then be presented.  It came, and, as was anticipated, it was followed by dark and doubtful days.  \"Eleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another view * * * Of those who were Slaves at the beginning of the Rebellion, full one hundred thousand are now in the United States Military service, about one half of which number actually bear arms in the ranks; thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the Insurgent cause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many White men.  So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good soldiers as any.  \"No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty, has marked the measures of Emancipation and arming the Blacks.  These measures have been much discussed in Foreign Countries, and contemporary with such discussion the tone of public sentiment there is much improved.  At home, the same measures have been fully discussed, supported, criticised, and denounced, and the annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the Country through this great trial.  Thus we have the new reckoning.  The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past.\"  After alluding to his Proclamation of Amnesty, issued simultaneously with this Message, to all repentant Rebels who would take an oath therein prescribed, and contending that such an oath should be (as he had drawn it) to uphold not alone the Constitution and the Union, but the Laws and Proclamations touching Slavery as well, President Lincoln continued:  \"In my judgment they have aided and will further aid, the Cause for which they were intended.  To now abandon them, would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and an astounding breach of faith.\"  And, toward the close of the Message, he added:  \"The movements by State action, for Emancipation, in several of the States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are matters of profound gratulation.  And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon the subject, my general views remain unchanged; and I trust that Congress will omit no fair opportunity of AIDING THESE IMPORTANT STEPS TO A GREAT CONSUMMATION.\"  Mr. Lincoln's patient but persistent solicitude, his earnest and unintermitted efforts--exercised publicly through his Messages and speeches, and privately upon Members of Congress who called upon, or whose presence was requested by him at the White House--in behalf of incorporating Emancipation in the Constitution, were now to give promise, at least, of bearing good fruit.  Measures looking to this end were submitted in both Houses of Congress soon after its meeting, and were referred to the respective Judiciary Committees of the same, and on the 10th of February, 1864, Mr. Trumbull reported to the Senate, from the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which he was Chairman, a substitute Joint Resolution providing for the submission to the States of an Amendment to the United States Constitution in the following words:  \"ART. XIII., SEC. I.  Neither Slavery nor Involuntary Servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.  \"SEC. II.  Congress shall have power to enforce this Article by appropriate legislation.\"  This proposed Amendment came up for consideration in the Senate, on the 28th of March, and a notable debate ensued.  On the same day, in the House of Representatives, Thaddeus Stevens--with the object perhaps of ascertaining the strength, in that Body, of the friends of out-and-out Emancipation--offered a Resolution proposing to the States the following Amendments to the United States Constitution:  \"ART. I.  Slavery and Involuntary Servitude, except for the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, is forever prohibited in the United States and all its Territories.  \"ART. II.  So much of Article four, Section two, as refers to the delivery up of Persons held to Service or Labor, escaping into another State, is annulled.\"  The test was made upon a motion to table the Resolution, which motion was defeated by 38 yeas to 69 nays, and showed the necessity for converting three members from the Opposition.  Subsequently, at the instance of Mr. Stevens himself, the second Article of the Resolution was struck out by 72 yeas to 26 nays.  The proceedings in both Houses of Congress upon these propositions to engraft upon the National Constitution a provision guaranteeing Freedom to all men upon our soil, were now interrupted by the death of one who would almost have been willing to die twice over, if, by doing so, he could have hastened their adoption.  Owen Lovejoy, the life-long apostle of Abolitionism, the fervid gospeller of Emancipation, was dead; and it seemed almost the irony of Fate that, at such a time, when Emancipation most needed all its friends to make it secure, its doughtiest champion should fall.  But perhaps the eloquent tributes paid to his memory, in the Halls of Congress, helped the Cause no less.  They at least brought back to the public mind the old and abhorrent tyrannies of the Southern Slave power; how it had sought not not only to destroy freedom of Action, but freedom of Speech, and hesitated not to destroy human Life with these; reminded the Loyal People of the Union of much that was hateful, from which they had escaped; and strengthened the purpose of Patriots to fix in the chief corner-stone of the Constitution, imperishable muniments of human Liberty.  Lovejoy's brother had been murdered at Alton, Illinois, while vindicating freedom of Speech and of the Press; and the blood of that martyr truly became \"the seed of the Church.\"  Arnold--recalling a speech of Owen Lovejoy's at Chicago, and a passage in it, descriptive of the martyrdom,--said to the House, on this sad occasion: \"I remember that, after describing the scene of that death, in words--which stirred every heart, he said he went a pilgrim to his brother's grave, and, kneeling upon the sod beneath which sleeps that brother, he swore, by the everlasting God, eternal hostility to African Slavery.\"  And, continued Arnold, \"Well and nobly has he kept that oath.\"  Washburne, too, reminded the House of the memorable episode in that very Hall when, (April 5, 1860), the adherents of Slavery crowding around Lovejoy with fierce imprecations and threats, seeking then and there to prevent Free Speech, \"he displayed that undaunted courage and matchless bearing which extorted the admiration of even his most deadly foes.\" \"His\"--continued the same speaker--\"was the eloquence of Mirabeau, which in the Tiers Etat and in the National Assembly made to totter the throne of France; it was the eloquence of Danton, who made all France to tremble from his tempestuous utterances in the National Convention. Like those apostles of the French Revolution, his eloquence could stir from the lowest depths all the passions of Man; but unlike them, he was as good and as pure as he was eloquent and brave, a noble minded Christian man, a lover of the whole human Race, and of universal Liberty regulated by Law.\"  Grinnell, in his turn, told also with real pathos, of his having recently seen Lovejoy in the chamber of sickness.  \"When,\" said Grinnell, \"I expressed fears for his recovery, I saw the tears course down his manly cheek, as he said 'Ah! God's will be done, but I have been laboring, voting, and praying for twenty years that I might see the great day of Freedom which is so near and which I hope God will let me live to rejoice in.  I want a vote on my Bill for the destruction of Slavery, root and branch.'\"        [Sumner, afterward speaking of Lovejoy and this Measure, said: \"On      the 14th of December, 1863, he introduced a Bill, whose title      discloses its character: 'A Bill to give effect to the"]]]
