At heart, however, Tostig was ill satisfied.  His chance conversations with the principal barons, who seemed to look upon the conquest of England as the dream of a madman, showed him how doubtful it was that William could induce his Quens to a service, to which the tenure of their fiefs did not appear to compel them; and at all events, Tostig prognosticated delays, that little suited his fiery impatience.  He accepted the offer of some two or three ships, which William put at his disposal, under pretence to reconnoitre the Northumbrian coasts, and there attempt a rising in his own favour.  But his discontent was increased by the smallness of the aid afforded him; for William, ever suspicious, distrusted both his faith and his power.  Tostig, with all his vices, was a poor dissimulator, and his sullen spirit betrayed itself when he took leave of his host.  \"Chance what may,\" said the fierce Saxon, \"no stranger shall seize the English crown without my aid.  I offer it first to thee.  But thou must come to take it in time, or----\"  \"Or what?\" asked the Duke, gnawing his lip.  \"Or the Father race of Rou will be before thee!  My horse paws without.  Farewell to thee, Norman; sharpen thy swords, hew out thy vessels, and goad thy slow barons.\"  Scarce had Tostig departed, ere William began to repent that he had so let him depart: but seeking counsel of Lanfranc, that wise minister reassured him.  \"Fear no rival, son and lord,\" said he.  \"The bones of the dead are on thy side, and little thou knowest, as yet, how mighty their fleshless arms!  All Tostig can do is to distract the forces of Harold.  Leave him to work out his worst; nor then be in haste.  Much hath yet to be done--cloud must gather and fire must form, ere the bolt can be launched.  Send to Harold mildly, and gently remind him of oath and of relics--of treaty and pledge.  Put right on thy side, and then----\"  \"Ah, what then?\"  \"Rome shall curse the forsworn--Rome shall hallow thy banner; this be no strife of force against force, but a war of religion; and thou shalt have on thy side the conscience of man, and the arm of the Church.\"  Meanwhile, Tostig embarked at Harfleur; but instead of sailing to the northern coasts of England, he made for one of the Flemish ports: and there, under various pretences, new manned the Norman vessels with Flemings, Fins, and Northmen.  His meditations during his voyage had decided him not to trust to William; and he now bent his course, with fair wind and favouring weather, to the shores of his maternal uncle, King Sweyn of Denmark.  In truth, to all probable calculation, his change of purpose was politic.  The fleets of England were numerous, and her seamen renowned.  The Normans had neither experience nor fame in naval fights; their navy itself was scarcely formed.  Thus, even William's landing in England was an enterprise arduous and dubious.  Moreover, even granting the amplest success, would not this Norman Prince, so profound and ambitious, be a more troublesome lord to Earl Tostig than his own uncle Sweyn?  So, forgetful of the compact at Rouen, no sooner had the Saxon lord come in presence of the King of the Danes, than he urged on his kinsman the glory of winning again the sceptre of Canute.  A brave, but a cautious and wily veteran, was King Sweyn; and a few days before Tostig arrived, he had received letters from his sister Githa, who, true to Godwin's command, had held all that Harold did and counselled, as between himself and his brother, wise and just. These letters had placed the Dane on his guard, and shown him the true state of affairs in England.  So King Sweyn, smiling, thus answered his nephew Tostig:  \"A great man was Canute, a small man am I: scarce can I keep my Danish dominion from the gripe of the Norwegian, while Canute took Norway without slash and blow [222]; but great as he was, England cost him hard fighting to win, and sore peril to keep.  Wherefore, best for the small man to rule by the light of his own little sense, nor venture to count on the luck of great Canute;--for luck but goes with the great.\"  \"Thine answer,\" said Tostig, with a bitter sneer, \"is not what I expected from an uncle and warrior.  But other chiefs may be found less afraid of the luck of high deeds.\"  \"So,\" saith the Norwegian chronicler, \"not just the best friends, the Earl left the King,\" and went on in haste to Harold Hardrada of Norway.  True Hero of the North, true darling of War and of Song, was Harold Hardrada!  At the terrible battle of Stiklestad, at which his brother, St. Olave, had fallen, he was but fifteen years of age, but his body was covered with the wounds of a veteran.  Escaping from the field, he lay concealed in the house of a Bonder peasant, remote in deep forests, till his wounds were healed.  Thence, chaunting by the way, (for a poet's soul burned bright in Hardrada,) \"That a day would come when his name would be great in the land he now left,\" he went on into Sweden, thence into Russia, and after wild adventures in the East, joined, with the bold troop he had collected around him, that famous body-guard of the Greek emperors [223], called the Vaeringers, and of these he became the chief.  Jealousies between himself and the Greek General of the Imperial forces, (whom the Norwegian chronicler calls Gyrger,) ended in Harold's retirement with his Vaeringers into the Saracen land of Africa.  Eighty castles stormed and taken, vast plunder in gold and in jewels, and nobler meed in the song of the Scald and the praise of the brave, attested the prowess of the great Scandinavian.  New laurels, blood-stained, new treasures, sword-won, awaited him in Sicily; and thence, rough foretype of the coming crusader, he passed on to Jerusalem.  His sword swept before him Moslem and robber.  He bathed in Jordan, and knelt at the Holy Cross.  Returned to Constantinople, the desire for his northern home seized Hardrada.  There he heard that his nephew Magnus, the illegitimate son of St. Olave, had become King of Norway,--and he himself aspired to a throne.  So he gave up his command under Zoe the empress; but, if Scald be believed, Zoe the empress loved the bold chief, whose heart was set on Maria her niece.  To detain Hardrada, a charge of mal- appropriation, whether of pay or of booty, was brought against him. He was cast into prison.  But when the brave are in danger, the saints send the fair to their help!  Moved by a holy dream, a Greek lady lowered ropes from the roof of the tower to the dungeon wherein Hardrada was cast. He escaped from the prison, he aroused his Vaeringers, they flocked round their chief; he went to the house of his lady Maria, bore her off to the galley, put out into the Black Sea, reached Novgorod, (at the friendly court of whose king he had safely lodged his vast spoils,) sailed home to the north: and, after such feats as became sea-king of old, received half of Norway from Magnus, and on the death of his nephew the whole of that kingdom passed to his sway.  A king so wise and so wealthy, so bold and so dread, had never yet been known in the north.  And this was the king to whom came Tostig the Earl, with the offer of England's crown.  It was one of the glorious nights of the north, and winter had already begun to melt into early spring, when two men sate under a kind of rustic porch of rough pine-logs, not very unlike those seen now in Switzerland and the Tyrol.  This porch was constructed before a private door, to the rear of a long, low, irregular building of wood which enclosed two or more courtyards, and covering an immense space of ground.  This private door seemed placed for the purpose of immediate descent to the sea; for the ledge of the rock over which the log-porch spread its rude roof, jutted over the ocean; and from it a rugged stair, cut through the crag, descended to the beach.  The shore, with bold, strange, grotesque slab, and peak, and splinter, curved into a large creek; and close under the cliff were moored seven warships, high and tall, with prows and sterns all gorgeous with gilding in the light of the splendid moon.  And that rude timber house, which seemed but a chain of barbarian huts linked into one, was a land palace of Hardrada of Norway; but the true halls of his royalty, the true seats of his empire, were the decks of those lofty war-ships.  Through the small lattice-work of the windows of the loghouse, lights blazed; from the roof-top smoke curled; from the hall on the other side of the dwelling, came the din of tumultuous wassail, but the intense stillness of the outer air, hushed in frost, and luminous with stars, contrasted and seemed to rebuke the gross sounds of human revel.  And that northern night seemed almost as bright as (but how much more augustly calm, than) the noon of the golden south!  On a table within the ample porch was an immense bowl of birchwood, mounted in silver, and filled with potent drink, and two huge horns, of size suiting the mighty wassailers of the age.  The two men seemed to care nought for the stern air of the cold night--true that they were wrapped in furs reft from the Polar bear.  But each had hot thoughts within, that gave greater warmth to the veins than the bowl or the bearskin.  They were host and guest; and as if with the restlessness of his thoughts, the host arose from his seat, and passed through the porch and stood on the bleak rock under the light of the moon; and so seen, he seemed scarcely human, but some war-chief of the farthest time,-- yea, of a time ere the deluge had shivered those rocks, and left beds on the land for the realm of that icy sea.  For Harold Hardrada was in height above all the children of modern men.  Five ells of Norway made the height of Harold Hardrada [224].  Nor was this stature accompanied by any of those imperfections in symmetry, nor by that heaviness of aspect, which generally render any remarkable excess above"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7682"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 11 (#4)"],["body","stature and strength rather monstrous than commanding.  On the contrary, his proportions were just; his appearance noble; and the sole defect that the chronicler remarks in his shape, was \"that his hands and feet were large, but these were well made.\" [225]  His face had all the fair beauty of the Norseman; his hair, parted in locks of gold over a brow that bespoke the daring of the warrior and the genius of the bard, fell in glittering profusion to his shoulders; a short beard and long moustache of the same colour as the hair, carefully trimmed, added to the grand and masculine beauty of the countenance, in which the only blemish was the peculiarity of one eyebrow being somewhat higher than the other [226], which gave something more sinister to his frown, something more arch to his smile.  For, quick of impulse, the Poet-Titan smiled and frowned often.  Harold Hardrada stood in the light of the moon, and gazing thoughtfully on the luminous sea.  Tostig marked him for some moments where he sate in the porch, and then rose and joined him.  \"Why should my words so disturb thee, O King of the Norseman?\"  \"Is glory, then, a drug that soothes to sleep?\" returned the Norwegian.  \"I like thine answer,\" said Tostig, smiling, \"and I like still more to watch thine eye gazing on the prows of thy war-ships.  Strange indeed it were if thou, who hast been fighting fifteen years for the petty kingdom of Denmark, shouldst hesitate now, when all England lies before thee to seize.\"  \"I hesitate,\" replied the King, \"because he whom Fortune has befriended so long, should beware how he strain her favour too far. Eighteen pitched battles fought I in the Saracen land, and in every one was a victor--never, at home or abroad, have I known shame and defeat.  Doth the wind always blow from one point?--and is Fate less unstable than the wind?\"  \"Now, out on thee, Harold Hardrada,\" said Tostig the fierce; \"the good pilot wins his way through all winds, and the brave heart fastens fate to its flag.  All men allow that the North never had warrior like thee; and now, in the mid-day of manhood, wilt thou consent to repose on the mere triumph of youth?\"  \"Nay,\" said the King, who, like all true poets, had something of the deep sense of a sage, and was, indeed, regarded as the most prudent as well as the most adventurous chief in the Northland,--\"nay, it is not by such words, which my soul seconds too well, that thou canst entrap a ruler of men.  Thou must show me the chances of success, as thou wouldst to a grey-beard.  For we should be as old men before we engage, and as youths when we wish to perform.\"  Then the traitor succinctly detailed all the weak points in the rule of his brother.  A treasury exhausted by the lavish and profitless waste of Edward; a land without castle or bulwark, even at the mouths of the rivers; a people grown inert by long peace, and so accustomed to own lord and king in the northern invaders, that a single successful battle might induce half the population to insist on the Saxon coming to terms with the foe, and yielding, as Ironsides did to Canute, one half of the realm.  He enlarged on the terror of the Norsemen that still existed throughout England, and the affinity between the Northumbrians and East Anglians with the race of Hardrada. That affinity would not prevent them from resisting at the first; but grant success, and it would reconcile them to the after sway.  And, finally, he aroused Hardrada's emulation by the spur of the news, that the Count of the Normans would seize the prize if he himself delayed to forestall him.  These various representations, and the remembrance of Canute's victory, decided Hardrada; and, when Tostig ceased, he stretched his hand towards his slumbering warships, and exclaimed:  \"Eno'; you have whetted the beaks of the ravens, and harnessed the steeds of the sea!\"     CHAPTER VII.   Meanwhile, King Harold of England had made himself dear to his people, and been true to the fame he had won as Harold the Earl.  From the moment of his accession, \"he showed himself pious, humble, and affable [227], and omitted no occasions to show any token of bounteous liberality, gentleness, and courteous behaviour.\"--\"The grievous customs, also, and taxes which his predecessors had raised, he either abolished or diminished; the ordinary wages of his servants and men- of-war he increased, and further showed himself very well bent to all virtue and goodness.\" [228]  Extracting the pith from these eulogies, it is clear that, as wise statesman no less than as good king, Harold sought to strengthen himself in the three great elements of regal power;--Conciliation of the Church, which had been opposed to his father; The popular affection, on which his sole claim to the crown reposed; And the military force of the land, which had been neglected in the reign of his peaceful predecessor.  To the young Atheling he accorded a respect not before paid to him; and, while investing the descendant of the ancient line with princely state, and endowing him with large domains, his soul, too great for jealousy, sought to give more substantial power to his own most legitimate rival, by tender care and noble counsels,--by efforts to raise a character feeble by nature, and denationalised by foreign rearing.  In the same broad and generous policy, Harold encouraged all the merchants from other countries who had settled in England, nor were even such Normans as had escaped the general sentence of banishment on Godwin's return, disturbed in their possessions.  \"In brief,\" saith the Anglo-Norman chronicler [229], \"no man was more prudent in the land, more valiant in arms, in the law more sagacious, in all probity more accomplished:\" and \"Ever active,\" says more mournfully the Saxon writer, \"for the good of his country, he spared himself no fatigue by land or by sea.\" [230]  From this time, Harold's private life ceased.  Love and its charms were no more.  The glow of romance had vanished.  He was not one man; he was the state, the representative, the incarnation of Saxon England: his sway and the Saxon freedom, to live or fall together!  The soul really grand is only tested in its errors.  As we know the true might of the intellect by the rich resources and patient strength with which it redeems a failure, so do we prove the elevation of the soul by its courageous return into light, its instinctive rebound into higher air, after some error that has darkened its vision and soiled its plumes.  A spirit less noble and pure than Harold's, once entering on the dismal world of enchanted superstition, had habituated itself to that nether atmosphere; once misled from hardy truth and healthful reason, it had plunged deeper and deeper into the maze.  But, unlike his contemporary, Macbeth, the Man escaped from the lures of the Fiend.  Not as Hecate in hell, but as Dian in heaven, did he confront the pale Goddess of Night.  Before that hour in which he had deserted the human judgment for the ghostly delusion; before that day in which the brave heart, in its sudden desertion, had humbled his pride--the man, in his nature, was more strong than the god.  Now, purified by the flame that had scorched, and more nerved from the fall that had stunned,--that great soul rose sublime through the wrecks of the Past, serene through the clouds of the Future, concentering in its solitude the destinies of Mankind, and strong with instinctive Eternity amidst all the terrors of Time.  King Harold came from York, whither he had gone to cement the new power of Morcar, in Northumbria, and personally to confirm the allegiance of the Anglo-Danes:--King Harold came from York, and in the halls of Westminster he found a monk who awaited him with the messages of William the Norman.  Bare-footed, and serge-garbed, the Norman envoy strode to the Saxon's chair of state.  His form was worn with mortification and fast, and his face was hueless and livid, with the perpetual struggle between zeal and flesh.  \"Thus saith William, Count of the Normans,\" began Hugues Maigrot, the monk.  \"With grief and amaze hath he heard that you, O Harold, his sworn liege-man, have, contrary to oath and to fealty, assumed the crown that belongs to himself.  But, confiding in thy conscience, and forgiving a moment's weakness, he summons thee, mildly and brother- like, to fulfil thy vow.  Send thy sister, that he may gave her in marriage to one of his Quens.  Give him up the stronghold of Dover; march to thy coast with thine armies to aid him,--thy liege lord,--and secure him the heritage of Edward his cousin.  And thou shalt reign at his right-hand, his daughter thy bride, Northumbria thy fief, and the saints thy protectors.\"  The King's lip was firm, though pale, as he answered:  \"My young sister, alas! is no more: seven nights after I ascended the throne, she died: her dust in the grave is all I could send to the arms of the bridegroom.  I cannot wed the child of thy Count: the wife of Harold sits beside him.\"  And he pointed to the proud beauty of Aldyth, enthroned under the drapery of gold.  \"For the vow that I took, I deny it not.  But from a vow of compulsion, menaced with unworthy captivity, extorted from my lips by the very need of the land whose freedom had been bound in my chains--from a vow so compelled, Church and conscience absolve me.  If the vow of a maiden on whom to bestow but her hand, when unknown to her parents, is judged invalid by the Church, how much more invalid the oath that would bestow on a stranger the fates of a nation [231], against its knowledge, and unconsulting its laws!  This royalty of England hath ever rested on the will of the people, declared through its chiefs in their solemn assembly.  They alone who could bestow it, have bestowed it on me:--I have no power to resign it to another--and were I in my grave, the trust of the crown would not pass to the Norman, but return to the Saxon people.\"  \"Is this, then, thy answer, unhappy son?\" said the monk,"]]]
