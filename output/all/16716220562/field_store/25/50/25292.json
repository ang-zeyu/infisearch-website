But. _s._ A conical and peculiar kind of basket or trap used in large numbers for catching salmon in the river Parret. The term _but_, would seem to be a generic one, the actual meaning of which I do not know; it implies, however, some containing vessel or utensil. _See_ BEE-BUT. _But_, applied to beef, always means _buttock._  Butter-and-eggs. _s._ A variety of the daffodil.  Bwile. _v._ Boil.  Bwye. _interj._ Bye! adieu. This, as well as _good-bye_ and _good-bwye_, is evidently corrupted from _God be with you_; God-be-wi' ye, equivalent to the French _ŕ Dieu_, to God. Bwye, and good-bwye, are, therefore, how vulgar soever they may seem, more analogous than _bye_ and _good-bye_.     C.   Callyvan'. _s._ A pyramidal trap for catching birds.  Car'riter. _s._ Character.  Câs. Because.  Cass'n, Cass'n't. Canst not: as, _Thee cass'n do it_, thou canst not do it.  Catch corner. A game commonly called elsewhere puss in the corner.  Cat'terpillar. _s._ The cockchafer; _Scarabeus melolontha_.  _West_ of the Parret this insect is called _wock-web_, oak-web, because it infests the _oak_, and spins its web on it in great numbers.

To Choóry. _v._ To do any kind of dirty household work.  Chub'by. _adj._ Full, swelling; as _chubby-faced_.  Claps, _s._ A clasp.  To claps, _v. a._ To clasp.  Clávy and Clávy-piece. _s._ A mantel-piecce.  [_Clavy_ was probably given to that piece of wood or other material laid over the front of the fireplace, because in many houses the keys are often hung on nails or pins driven into it; hence from _clavis_ (Latin) _a key_, comes _clavy_, the place where the keys are hung.]  Clavy-tack. _s._ The shelf over [tacked on to] the mantel- piece.  Clear-and-sheer. _adv._ Completely; totally.  Cleve-pink. _s._ A species of Carnation which grows wild in the crannies of Cheddar-cliffs: a variety of the _Dianthus deltoides_; it has an elegant smell.

Criss-cross-lain. _s._ The alphabet; so called in consequence of its being formerly preceded in the _horn-book_ by a cross to remind us of the cross of Christ; hence the term. _Christ-Cross- line_ came at last to mean nothing more than the alphabet.

Dame. _s._ This word is originally French, and means in that language, _lady_; but in this dialect it means a mistress; an old woman; and never a lady; nor is it applied to persons in the upper ranks of society, nor to the very lowest; when we say _dame_ Hurman, or _dame_ Bennet, we mean the wife of some farmer; a school-mistress is also sometimes called dame (dame-schools).  Dang. _interj._ Generally followed by pronoun, as _dang it_; _dang ęm_; _od dang it_: [an imprecation, a corruption of _God dang it_ (_God hang it_) or more likely corruption of _damn_.]  Dap, _v. n._ To hop; to rebound.  Dap. _s._ A hop; a turn. _To know the daps of a person_ is, to know his disposition, his habits, his peculiarities.  Dap'ster. _s._ A proficient.  To Daver. _v. n._ To fade; to fall down; to droop.  Dav'ison. _s._ A species of wild plum, superior to the bullin.  Daw'zin. _s._ The passing over land with a bent hazel rod, held in a certain direction, to discover whether veins of metal or springs are below, is called _Dawzin_, which is still practised in the mining districts of Somersetshire. There is an impression among the vulgar, that certain persons only have the gift of the _divining rod_, as it has been sometimes called; by the French, _Baguette Devinatoire_.  _Ray_, in his _Catalogus Plantarum Anglić, &c._, Art. _Corylus_, speaks of the divining rod: \" Vulgus metallicorum ad virgulam divinum, ut vocant, quâ venas metallorum inquírit prć cćteris furcam eligit colurnam.\" More may be seen in John Bauhin.

Duds. _s. pl._ Dirty cloaths.  Dum'bledore. _s._ A humble-bee; a stupid fellow.  Dunch, (Dunce?). _adj._ Deaf.  As a deaf person is very often, apparently at least, stupid; a stupid, intractable person is, therefore, called a DUNCE: one who is deaf and intractable. What now becomes of _Duns Scotus_, and all the rest of the recondite observations bestowed upon DUNCE?--_See_ GROSE.  I have no doubt that _Dunch_ is Anglo-Saxon, although I cannot find it in any of our old dictionaries, except Bailey's. But it ought not to be forgotten, that many words are floating about which are being arrested by our etymologists in the present advancing age of investigation.  Durns. _s. pl._ A door-frame.  Dwon't, Dwon. _v._ (Don't) do not.     E.   Eake. _adv._ Also.  Ear-wrig. _s._ Earwig.  This word ought to be spelled _Earwrig_, as it is derived, doubtless, from wriggle. See WRIGGLE.
