Two soldiers went down to the hold and released Tell. They bade him get up and come with them. Tell followed them on deck, and stood before the Governor.  \"Tell,\" said Gessler.  Tell looked at him without speaking.  \"Take the helm, Tell,\" said Gessler, \"and steer the ship through those rocks into the bay beyond, or instant death shall be your lot.\"  Without a word Tell took the helmsman's place, peering keenly into the cloud of foam before him. To right and to left he turned the vessel's head, and to right again, into the very heart of the spray. They were right among the rocks now, but the ship did not strike on them. Quivering and pitching, she was hurried along, until of a sudden the spray-cloud was behind her, and in front the calm waters of the bay.  Gessler beckoned to the helmsman.  \"Take the helm again,\" he said.  He pointed to Tell.  \"Bind him,\" he said to the soldiers.  The soldiers advanced slowly, for they were loath to bind the man who had just saved them from destruction. But the Governor's orders must he obeyed, so they came towards Tell, carrying ropes with which to bind him.  Tell moved a step back. The ship was gliding past a lofty rock. It was such a rock as Tell had often climbed when hunting the chamois. He acted with the quickness of the hunter. Snatching up the bow and quiver which lay on the deck, he sprang on to the bulwark of the vessel, and, with a mighty leap, gained the rock. Another instant, and he was out of reach.  Gessler roared to his bowmen.  \"Shoot! shoot!\" he cried.  The bowmen hastily fitted arrow to string. They were too late. Tell was ready before them. There was a hiss as the shaft rushed through the air, and the next moment Gessler the Governor fell dead on the deck, pierced through the heart.  Tell's second arrow had found its mark, as his first had done.  [Illustration: PLATE XV]     CHAPTER XV   There is not much more of the story of William Tell. The death of Gessler was a signal to the Swiss to rise in revolt, and soon the whole country was up in arms against the Austrians. It had been chiefly the fear of the Governor that had prevented a rising before. It had been brewing for a long time. The people had been bound by a solemn oath to drive the enemy out of the country. All through Switzerland preparations for a revolution were going on, and nobles and peasants had united.  Directly the news arrived that the Governor was slain, meetings of the people were held in every town in Switzerland, and it was resolved to begin the revolution without delay. All the fortresses that Gessler had built during his years of rule were carried by assault on the same night. The last to fall was one which had only been begun a short time back, and the people who had been forced to help to build it spent a very pleasant hour pulling down the stones which had cost them such labour to put in their place. Even the children helped. It was a great treat to them to break what they pleased without being told not to.  \"See,\" said Tell, as he watched them, \"in years to come, when these same children are gray-haired, they will remember this night as freshly as they will remember it to-morrow.\"  A number of people rushed up, bearing the pole which Gessler's soldiers had set up in the meadow. The hat was still on top of it, nailed to the wood by Tell's arrow.  \"Here's the hat!\" shouted Ruodi--\"the hat to which we were to bow!\"  \"What shall we do with it?\" cried several voices.  \"Destroy it! Burn it!\" said others. \"To the flames with this emblem of tyranny!\"  But Tell stopped them.  \"Let us preserve it,\" he said. \"Gessler set it up to be a means of enslaving the country; we will set it up as a memorial of our newly-gained liberty. Nobly is fulfilled the oath we swore to drive the tyrants from our land. Let the pole mark the spot where the revolution finished.\"  \"But _is_ it finished?\" said Arnold of Melchthal. \"It is a nice point. When the Emperor of Austria hears that we have killed his friend Gessler, and burnt down all his fine new fortresses, will he not come here to seek revenge?\"  \"He will,\" said Tell. \"And let him come. And let him bring all his mighty armies. We have driven out the enemy that was in our land. We will meet and drive away the enemy that comes from another country. Switzerland is not easy to attack. There are but a few mountain passes by which the foe can approach. We will stop these with our bodies. And one great strength we have: we are united. And united we need fear no foe.\"  \"Hurrah!\" shouted everybody.  \"But who is this that approaches?\" said Tell. \"He seems excited. Perhaps he brings news.\"  It was Rösselmann the pastor, and he brought stirring news.  \"These are strange times in which we live,\" said Rösselmann, coming up.  \"Why, what has happened?\" cried everybody.  \"Listen, and be amazed.\"  \"Why, what's the matter?\"  \"The Emperor----\"  \"Yes?\"  \"The Emperor is dead.\"  \"What! dead?\"  \"Dead!\"  \"Impossible! How came you by the news?\"  \"John Müller of Schaffhausen brought it. And he is a truthful man.\"  \"But how did it happen?\"  \"As the Emperor rode from Stein to Baden the lords of Eschenbach and Tegerfelden, jealous, it is said, of his power, fell upon him with their spears. His bodyguard were on the other side of a stream--the Emperor had just crossed it--and could not come to his assistance. He died instantly.\"  By the death of the Emperor the revolution in Switzerland was enabled to proceed without check. The successor of the Emperor had too much to do in defending himself against the slayers of his father to think of attacking the Swiss, and by the time he was at leisure they were too strong to be attacked. So the Swiss became free.  As for William Tell, he retired to his home, and lived there very happily ever afterwards with his wife and his two sons, who in a few years became very nearly as skilful in the use of the cross-bow as their father.     EPILOGUE.        Some say the tale related here        Is amplified and twisted;      Some say it isn't very clear        That William Tell existed;      Some say he freed his country _so_,        The Governor demolished.      Perhaps he did. I only know        That taxes aren't abolished!             *       *       *       *       *   [The Illustrations and accompanying descriptive verses]     [PROLOGUE.]       The Swiss, against their Austrian foes,        Had ne'er a soul to lead 'em,      Till Tell, as you've heard tell, arose        And guided them to freedom.      Tell's tale we tell again--an act        For which pray no one scold us--      This tale of Tell we tell, in fact,        As this Tell tale was told us.     PLATE I.        Beneath a tyrant foreign yoke,        How love of freedom waxes!      (Especially when foreign folk        Come round collecting taxes.)      The Swiss, held down by Gessler's fist,        Would fain have used evasion;      Yet none there seemed who could resist        His methods of persuasion.  [Illustration: GESSLER'S METHODS OF PERSUASION]     PLATE II.        And pride so filled this Gessler's soul        (A monarch's pride outclassing),      He stuck his hat up on a pole,        That all might bow in passing.      Then rose the patriot, William Tell--        \"We've groaned 'neath Austria's sway first;      Must we be ruled by poles as well?        I've just a word to say first!\"  [Illustration: THEY WOULD MARCH ABOUT, BEATING TIN CANS AND SHOUTING]     PLATE III.        The crowd about the pole at morn        Used various \"persuaders\"--      They flung old cans (to prove their scorn        Of all tin-pot invaders);      And cabbage-stumps were freely dealt,        And apples (inexpensive),      And rotten eggs (to show they felt        A foreign yoke offensive).  [Illustration: AN EGG FLEW ACROSS THE MEADOW, AND BURST OVER LEUTHOLD'S SHOULDER]     PLATE IV.        Said William Tell, \"And has this cuss        For conquest such a passion      He needs must set his cap at us        In this exalted fashion?\"      And then the people gave a cry,        'Twixt joy and apprehension,      To see him pass the symbol by        With studied inattention!  [Illustration: \"HERE! HI!\" SHOUTED THE SOLDIERS, \"STOP!\"]     PLATE V.        At first the sentinel, aghast,        Glared like an angry dumb thing;      Then \"Hi!\" he shouted, \"not so fast,        You're overlooking something!\"      The sturdy Tell made no response;        Then through the hills resounded      A mighty thwack upon his sconce--        The people were astounded.  [Illustration: THEY SAW FRIESSHARDT RAISE HIS PIKE, AND BRING IT DOWN WITH ALL HIS FORCE ON TELL'S HEAD]     PLATE VI.        Could Tell an insult such as this        Ignore or pass? I doubt it!      No, no; that patriotic Swiss        Was very cross about it.      The people, interested now,        Exclaimed, \"Here! Stop a minute      If there's to be a jolly row,        By Jingo! we'll be in it!\"  [Illustration: \"LOOK HERE!\" HE BEGAN. \"LOOK THERE!\" SAID FRIESSHARDT]     PLATE VII.        Said Tell, \"This satrap of the Duke        Is sore in need of gumption;      With my good bow I will rebuke        Such arrow-gant presumption.\"      \"Stand back!\" the soldier says, says he;        \"This roughness is unseemly!\"      The people cried, \"We _will_ be FREE!\"        And so they were--extremely!  [Illustration: FRIESSHARDT RUSHED TO STOP HIM]     PLATE VIII.        They dealt that soldier thump on thump        (He hadn't any notion,      When on Tell's head he raised that bump,        Of raising this commotion);      Tell's arrow sped, the people crowed,        And loudly cheered his action;      While Tell's expressive features showed        A certain satisfaction.

And when those soldiers lodged complaint        (Which truly didn't lack ground),      The people practised self-restraint        And fell into the background.  [Illustration: \"COME, COME, COME!\" SAID GESSLER, \"TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT\"]     PLATE X.        And Tell, before the tyrant hailed,        No patriot you'd have guessed him,      For even his stout bosom quailed        When Gessler thus addressed him:--      \"As you're the crack shot of these Swiss        (I've often heard it said so),      Suppose you take a shot at this,        Placed on your youngster's head--so!\"  [Illustration: \"I HAVE HERE AN APPLE\"]     PLATE XI.        \"The bearing,\" as they say, \"of that        Lay in the apple-cation,\"      And nobody will wonder at        A parent's agitation;      That anguish filled Tell's bosom proud        Needs scarcely to be stated,      And, it will be observed, the crowd        Was also agitated.  [Illustration: THERE WAS A STIR OF EXCITEMENT IN THE CROWD]     PLATE XII.        Said Gessler, \"This is all my eye!        Come, hurry up and _buck_ up!      Remember, if you miss, you die--        That ought to keep your pluck up.      The flying arrow may, no doubt,        Your offspring's bosom enter--\"      But here there rose a mighty shout:        \"By George! He's scored a centre!\"  [Illustration: A MOMENT'S SUSPENSE, AND THEN A TERRIFIC CHEER AROSE FROM THE SPECTATORS]     PLATE XIII.        But, as the arrow cleft the core,        Cried G. with indignation,      \"What was the second arrow for?        Come, no e-quiver-cation!      You had a second in your fist.\"        Said Tell, the missile grippin',      \"This shaft (had I that apple missed)        Was meant for you, my pippin!\"  [Illustration: \"SEIZE THAT MAN!\" HE SHOUTED]     PLATE XIV.        With rage the tyrant said, said he,        \"It's time to stop this prating;      I find your style of repartee        Extremely irritating.      You'll hang for this, be pleased to note.\"        On this they bound and gagged him      (For Gessler's castle booked by boat),        And through the village dragged him.  [Illustration: HE WAS LED AWAY TO THE SHORE OF THE LAKE]     PLATE XV.        But slips between the cup and lip,        When least expected, peer through--      A storm arose upon the trip        Which Tell alone could steer through.      Thus, of all hands he quickly got        (As you may see) the upper,      At Gessler took a parting shot,        And hurried home to supper.
