CHAPTER IV.  PARIS.--A FEMALE POLITICIAN AND AN ECCLESIASTICAL ONE.--SUNDRY OTHER MATTERS.  THE ex-minister was received both at Calais and at Paris with the most gratifying honours: he was then entirely the man to captivate the French.  The beauty of his person, the grace of his manner, his consummate taste in all things, the exceeding variety and sparkling vivacity of his conversation, enchanted them.  In later life he has grown more reserved and profound, even in habitual intercourse; and attention is now fixed to the solidity of the diamond, as at that time one was too dazzled to think of anything but its brilliancy.  While Bolingbroke was receiving visits of state, I busied myself in inquiring after a certain Madame de Balzac.  The reader will remember that the envelope of that letter which Oswald had brought to me at Devereux Court was signed by the letters C. de B.  Now, when Oswald disappeared, after that dreadful night to which even now I can scarcely bring myself to allude, these initials occurred to my remembrance, and Oswald having said they belonged to a lady formerly intimate with my father, I inquired of my mother if she could guess to what French lady such initials would apply.  She, with an evident pang of jealousy, mentioned a Madame de Balzac; and to this lady I now resolved to address myself, with the faint hope of learning from her some intelligence respecting Oswald.  It was not difficult to find out the abode of one who in her day had played no inconsiderable role in that 'Comedy of Errors,'--the Great World.  She was still living at Paris: what Frenchwoman would, if she could help it, live anywhere else?  \"There are a hundred gates,\" said the witty Madame de Choisi to me, \"which lead into Paris, but only two roads out of it,--the convent, or (odious word!) the grave.\"  I hastened to Madame Balzac's hotel.  I was ushered through three magnificent apartments into one which to my eyes seemed to contain a throne: upon a nearer inspection I discovered it was a bed.  Upon a large chair, by a very bad fire--it was in the month of March--sat a tall, handsome woman, excessively painted, and dressed in a manner which to my taste, accustomed to English finery, seemed singularly plain.  I had sent in the morning to request permission to wait on her, so that she was prepared for my visit.  She rose, offered me her cheek, kissed mine, shed several tears, and in short testified a great deal of kindness towards me.  Old ladies who have flirted with our fathers always seem to claim a sort of property in the sons!  Before she resumed her seat she held me out at arm's length.  \"You have a family likeness to your brave father,\" said she, with a little disappointment; \"but--\"  \"Madame de Balzac would add,\" interrupted I, filling up the sentence which I saw her /bienveillance/ had made her break off, \"Madame de Balzac would add that I am not so good-looking.  It is true: the likeness is transmitted to me within rather than without; and if I have not my father's privilege to be admired, I have at least his capacities to admire,\" and I bowed.  Madame de Balzac took three large pinches of snuff.  \"That is very well said,\" said she, gravely: \"very well indeed! not at all like your father, though, who never paid a compliment in his life.  Your clothes, by the by, are in exquisite taste: I had no idea that English people had arrived at such perfection in the fine arts.  Your face is a little too long!  You admire Racine, of course?  How do you like Paris?\"  All this was not said gayly or quickly: Madame de Balzac was by no means a gay or a quick person.  She belonged to a peculiar school of Frenchwomen, who affected a little languor, a great deal of stiffness, an indifference to forms when forms were to be used by themselves, and an unrelaxing demand of forms when forms were to be observed to them by others.  Added to this, they talked plainly upon all matters, without ever entering upon sentiment.  This was the school she belonged to; but she possessed the traits of the individual as well as of the species. She was keen, ambitious, worldly, not unaffectionate nor unkind; very proud, a little of the devotee,--because it was the fashion to be so,--an enthusiastic admirer of military glory, and a most prying, searching, intriguing schemer of politics without the slightest talent for the science.  \"Like Paris!\" said I, answering only the last question, and that not with the most scrupulous regard to truth.  \"Can Madame de Balzac think of Paris, and not conceive the transport which must inspire a person entering it for the first time?  But I had something more endearing than a stranger's interest to attach me to it: I longed to express to my father's friend my gratitude for the interest which I venture to believe she on one occasion manifested towards me.\"  \"Ah! you mean my caution to you against that terrible De Montreuil. Yes, I trust I was of service to you /there/.\"  And Madame de Balzac then proceeded to favour me with the whole history of the manner in which she had obtained the letter she had sent me, accompanied by a thousand anathemas against those /atroces Jesuites/ and a thousand eulogies on her own genius and virtues.  I brought her from this subject so interesting to herself, as soon as decorum would allow me; and I then made inquiry if she knew aught of Oswald or could suggest any mode of obtaining intelligence respecting him.  Madame de Balzac hated plain, blunt, blank questions, and she always travelled through a wilderness of parentheses before she answered them.  But at last I did ascertain her answer, and found it utterly unsatisfactory.  She had never seen nor heard anything of Oswald since he had left her charged with her commission to me.  I then questioned her respecting the character of the man, and found Mr. Marie Oswald had little to plume himself upon in that respect.  He seemed, however, from her account of him, to be more a rogue than a villain; and from two or three stories of his cowardice, which Madame de Balzac related, he appeared to me utterly incapable of a design so daring and systematic as that of which it pleased all persons who troubled themselves about my affairs to suspect him.  Finding at last that no further information was to be gained on this point, I turned the conversation to Montreuil.  I found, from Madame de Balzac's very abuse of him, that he enjoyed a great reputation in the country and a great favour at court.  He had been early befriended by Father la Chaise, and he was now especially trusted and esteemed by the successor of that Jesuit Le Tellier,--Le Tellier, that rigid and bigoted servant of Loyola, the sovereign of the king himself, the destroyer of the Port Royal, and the mock and terror of the bedevilled and persecuted Jansenists.  Besides this, I learned what has been before pretty clearly evident; namely, that Montreuil was greatly in the confidence of the Chevalier, and that he was supposed already to have rendered essential service to the Stuart cause.  His reputation had increased with every year, and was as great for private sanctity as for political talent.  When this information, given in a very different spirit from that in which I retail it, was over, Madame de Balzac observed, \"Doubtless you will obtain a private audience with the king?\"  \"Is it possible, in his present age and infirmities?\"  \"It ought to be, to the son of the brave Marshal Devereux.\"  \"I shall be happy to receive Madame's instructions how to obtain the honour: her name would, I feel, be a greater passport to the royal presence than that of a deceased soldier; and Venus's cestus may obtain that grace which would never be accorded to the truncheon of Mars!\"  Was there ever so natural and so easy a compliment?  My Venus of fifty smiled.  \"You are mistaken, Count,\" said she; \"I have no interest at court: the Jesuits forbid that to a Jansenist, but I will speak this very day to the Bishop of Frejus; he is related to me, and will obtain so slight a boon for you with ease.  He has just left his bishopric; you know how he hated it.  Nothing could be pleasanter than his signing himself, in a letter to Cardinal Quirini, 'Fleuri, Eveque de Frejus par l'indignation divine.'  The King does not like him much; but he is a good man on the whole, though jesuitical; he shall introduce you.\"  I expressed my gratitude for the favour, and hinted that possibly the relations of my father's first wife, the haughty and ancient house of La Tremouille, might save the Bishop of Frejus from the pain of exerting himself on my behalf.  \"You are very much mistaken,\" answered Madame de Balzac: \"priests point the road to court as well as to Heaven; and warriors and nobles have as little to do with the former as they have with the latter, the unlucky Duc de Villars only excepted,--a man whose ill fortune is enough to destroy all the laurels of France.  /Ma foi/!  I believe the poor Duke might rival in luck that Italian poet who said, in a fit of despair, that if he had been bred a hatter, men would have been born without heads.\"  And Madame de Balzac chuckled over this joke, till, seeing that no further news was to be gleaned from her, I made my adieu and my departure.  Nothing could exceed the kindness manifested towards me by my father's early connections.  The circumstance of my accompanying Bolingbroke, joined to my age, and an address which, if not animated nor gay, had not been acquired without some youthful cultivation of the graces, gave me a sort of /eclat/ as well as consideration.  And Bolingbroke, who was only jealous of superiors in power, and who had no equals in anything else, added greatly to my reputation by his panegyrics.  Every one sought me; and the attention of society at Paris would, to most, be worth a little trouble to repay.  Perhaps, if I had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7627"],["title","Devereux — Volume 04 (#5)"],["body","it, I might have been the rage; but that vanity was over.  I contented myself with being admitted into society as an observer, without a single wish to become the observed.  When one has once outlived the ambition of fashion I know not a greater affliction than an over-attention; and the Spectator did just what I should have done in a similar case, when he left his lodgings \"because he was asked every morning how he had slept.\" In the immediate vicinity of the court, the King's devotion, age, and misfortunes threw a damp over society; but there were still some sparkling circles, who put the King out of the mode, and declared that the defeats of his generals made capital subjects for epigrams.  What a delicate and subtle air did hang over those /soirees/, where all that were bright and lovely, and noble and gay, and witty and wise, were assembled in one brilliant cluster!  Imperfect as my rehearsals must be, I think the few pages I shall devote to a description of these glittering conversations must still retain something of that original piquancy which the /soirees/ of no other capital could rival or appreciate.  One morning, about a week after my interview with Madame de Balzac, I received a note from her requesting me to visit her that day, and appointing the hour.  Accordingly I repaired to the house of the fair politician.  I found her with a man in a clerical garb, and of a benevolent and prepossessing countenance.  She introduced him to me as the Bishop of Frejus; and he received me with an air very uncommon to his countrymen, namely, with an ease that seemed to result from real good-nature, rather than artificial grace.  \"I shall feel,\" said he, quietly, and without the least appearance of paying a compliment, \"very glad to mention your wish to his Majesty; and I have not the least doubt but that he will admit to his presence one who has such hereditary claims on his notice.  Madame de Maintenon, by the way, has charged me to present you to her whenever you will give me the opportunity.  She knew your admirable mother well, and for her sake wishes once to see you.  You know perhaps, Monsieur, that the extreme retirement of her life renders this message from Madame de Maintenon an unusual and rare honour.\"  I expressed my thanks; the Bishop received them with a paternal rather than a courtier-like air, and appointed a day for me to attend him to the palace.  We then conversed a short time upon indifferent matters, which I observed the good Bishop took especial pains to preserve clear from French politics.  He asked me, however, two or three questions about the state of parties in England,--about finance and the national debt, about Ormond and Oxford; and appeared to give the most close attention to my replies.  He smiled once or twice, when his relation, Madame de Balzac, broke out into sarcasms against the Jesuits, which had nothing to do with the subjects in question.  \"Ah, /ma chere cousine/,\" said he: \"you flatter me by showing that you like me not as the politician, but the private relation,--not as the Bishop of Frejus, but as Andre de Fleuri.\"  Madame de Balzac smiled, and answered by a compliment.  She was a politician for the kingdom, it is true, but she was also a politician for herself.  She was far from exclaiming, with Pindar, \"Thy business, O my city, I prefer willingly to my own.\"  Ah, there is a nice distinction between politics and policy, and Madame de Balzac knew it.  The distinction is this.  Politics is the art of being wise for others: policy is the art of being wise for one's self.  From Madame de Balzac's I went to Bolingbroke.  \"I have just been offered the place of Secretary of State by the English king on this side of the water,\" said he; \"I do not, however, yet like to commit myself so fully.  And, indeed, I am not unwilling to have a little relaxation of pleasure, after all these dull and dusty travails of state.  What say you to Boulainvilliers to-night? you are asked?\"  \"Yes! all the wits are to be there,--Anthony Hamilton, and Fontenelle, young Arouet, Chaulieu, that charming old man.  Let us go, and polish away the wrinkles of our hearts.  What cosmetics are to the face wit is to the temper; and, after all, there is no wisdom like that which teaches us to forget.\"  \"Come then,\" said Bolingbroke, rising, \"we will lock up these papers, and take a melancholy drive, in order that we may enjoy mirth the better by and by.\"    CHAPTER V.  A MEETING OF WITS.--CONVERSATION GONE OUT TO SUPPER IN HER DRESS OF VELVET AND JEWELS.  BOULAINVILLIERS!  Comte de St. Saire!  What will our great-grandchildren think of that name?  Fame is indeed a riddle!  At the time I refer to, wit, learning, grace--all things that charm and enlighten--were supposed to centre in one word,-/Boulainvilliers/!  The good Count had many rivals, it is true, but he had that exquisite tact peculiar to his countrymen, of making the very reputations of those rivals contribute to his own.  And while he assembled them around him, the lustre of their /bons mots/, though it emanated from themselves, was reflected upon him.  It was a pleasant though not a costly apartment in which we found our host.  The room was sufficiently full of people to allow scope and variety to one group of talkers, without being full enough to permit those little knots and /coteries/ which are the destruction of literary society.  An old man of about seventy, of a sharp, shrewd, yet polished and courtly expression of countenance, of a great gayety of manner, which was now and then rather displeasingly contrasted by an abrupt affectation of dignity, that, however, rarely lasted above a minute, and never withstood the shock of a /bon mot/, was the first person who accosted us.  This old man was the wreck of the once celebrated Anthony Count Hamilton!  \"Well, my Lord,\" said he to Bolingbroke, \"how do you like the weather at Paris?  It is a little better than the merciless air of London; is it not?  'Slife!--even in June one could not go open breasted in those regions of cold and catarrh,--a very great misfortune, let me tell you, my Lord, if one's cambric happened to be of a very delicate and brilliant texture, and one wished to penetrate the inward folds of a lady's heart, by developing to the best advantage the exterior folds that covered his own.\"  \"It is the first time,\" answered Bolingbroke, \"that I ever heard so accomplished a courtier as Count Hamilton repine, with sincerity, that he could not bare his bosom to inspection.\"  \"Ah!\" cried Boulainvilliers, \"but vanity makes a man show much that discretion would conceal.\"  \"/Au diable/ with your discretion!\" said Hamilton, \"'tis a vulgar virtue.  Vanity is a truly aristocratic quality, and every way fitted to a gentleman.  Should I ever have been renowned for my exquisite lace and web-like cambric, if I had not been vain?  Never, /mon cher/!  I should have gone into a convent and worn sackcloth, and from /Count Antoine/ I should have thickened into /Saint Anthony/.\"  \"Nay,\" cried Lord Bolingbroke, \"there is as much scope for vanity in sackcloth as there is in cambric; for vanity is like the Irish ogling master in the \"Spectator,\" and if it teaches the play-house to ogle by candle-light, it also teaches the church to ogle by day!  But, pardon me, Monsieur Chaulieu, how well you look!  I see that the myrtle sheds its verdure, not only over your poetry, but the poet.  And it is right that, to the modern Anacreon, who has bequeathed to Time a treasure it will never forego, Time itself should be gentle in return.\"  \"Milord,\" answered Chaulieu, an old man who, though considerably past seventy, was animated, in appearance and manner, with a vivacity and life that would have done honour to a youth,--\"Milord, it was beautifully said by the Emperor Julian that Justice retained the Graces in her vestibule.  I see, now, that he should have substituted the word /Wisdom/ for that of Justice.\"  \"Come,\" cried Anthony Hamilton, \"this will never do: compliments are the dullest things imaginable.  For Heaven's sake, let us leave panegyric to blockheads, and say something bitter to one another, or we shall die of /ennui/.\"  \"Right,\" said Boulainvilliers; \"let us pick out some poor devil to begin with.  Absent or present?--Decide which.\"  \"Oh, absent,\" cried Chaulieu, \"'tis a thousand times more piquant to slander than to rally!  Let us commence with his Majesty: Count Devereux, have you seen Madame Maintenon and her devout infant since your arrival?\"  \"No! the priest must be petitioned before the miracle is made public.\"  \"What!\" cried Chaulieu, \"would you insinuate that his Majesty's piety is really nothing less than a miracle?\"  \"Impossible!\" said Boulainvilliers, gravely,--\"piety is as natural to kings as flattery to their courtiers: are we not told that they are made in God's own image?\"  \"If that were true,\" said Count Hamilton, somewhat profanely,--\"if that were true, I should no longer deny the impossibility of Atheism!\"  \"Fie, Count Hamilton,\" said an old gentleman, in whom I recognized the great Huet, \"fie: wit should beware how it uses wings; its province is earth, not Heaven.\"  \"Nobody can better tell what wit is /not/ than the learned Abbe Huet!\" answered Hamilton, with a mock air of respect.  \"Pshaw!\" cried Chaulieu, \"I thought when we once gave the rein to satire it would carry us /pele-mele/ against one another.  But, in order to sweeten that drop of lemon-juice for you, my dear Huet, let me turn to Milord Bolingbroke, and ask him whether England can produce a scholar equal to Peter Huet, who in twenty years wrote notes to sixty-two volumes of Classics,* for the sake of a prince who never read a line in one of them?\"   * The Delphin Classics.   \"We have some scholars,\" answered Bolingbroke; \"but we certainly have no Huet.  It is strange enough, but learning seems to me like a circle: it grows weaker the more it spreads.  We now see many people capable of reading commentaries, but very few indeed "]]]
