Alas!\" and here St. John's countenance changed from gayety to thought; \"'tis a melancholy thing in human nature that so little is good and noble, both in itself and in its source!  Our very worst passions will often produce sublimer effects than our best. Phidias (we will apply to him for another illustration) made the wonderful statue of Minerva for his country; but, in order to avenge himself on that country, he eclipsed it in the far more wonderful statue of the Jupiter Olympius.  Thus, from a vicious feeling emanated a greater glory than from an exalted principle; and the artist was less celebrated for the monument of his patriotism than for that of his revenge!  But, /allons, mon cher/, we grow wise and dull.  Let us go to choose our Burgundy and our comrades to share it.\"  However with his characteristic affectation of bounding ambition, and consequently hope, to no one object in particular, and of mingling affairs of light importance with those of the most weighty, Lord Bolingbroke might pretend not to recur to, or to dwell upon, his causes of resentment, from that time they never ceased to influence him to a great, and for a statesman an unpardonable, degree.  We cannot, however, blame politicians for their hatred, until, without hating anybody, we have for a long time been politicians ourselves; strong minds have strong passions, and men of strong passions must hate as well as love.  The next two years passed, on my part, in perpetual intrigues of diplomacy, combined with an unceasing though secret endeavour to penetrate the mystery which hung over the events of that dreadful night. All, however, was m vain.  I know not what the English police may be hereafter, but, in my time, its officers seem to be chosen, like honest Dogberry's companions, among \"the most senseless and fit men.\"  They are, however, to the full, as much knaves as fools; and perhaps a wiser posterity will scarcely believe that, when things of the greatest value are stolen, the owners, on applying to the chief magistrate, will often be told that no redress can be given there, while one of the officers will engage to get back the goods, upon paying the thieves a certain sum in exchange: if this is refused, your effects are gone forever!  A pretty state of internal government!  It was about a year after the murder that my mother informed me of an event which tore from my heart its last private tie; namely, the death of Aubrey.  The last letter I had received from him has been placed before the reader; it was written at Devereux Court, just before he left it forever.  Montreuil had been with him during the illness which proved fatal, and which occurred in Ireland.  He died of consumption; and when I heard from my mother that Montreuil dwelt most glowingly upon the devotion he had manifested during the last months of his life, I could not help fearing that the morbidity of his superstition had done the work of physical disease.  On this fatal news, my mother retired from Devereux Court to a company of ladies of our faith, who resided together, and practised the most ascetic rules of a nunnery, though they gave not to their house that ecclesiastical name.  My mother had long meditated this project, and it was now a melancholy pleasure to put it into execution.  From that period I rarely heard from her, and by little and little she so shrank from all worldly objects that my visits, and I believe even those of Gerald, became unwelcome and distasteful.  As to my lawsuit, it went on gloriously, according to the assertions of my brisk little lawyer, who had declared so emphatically that he liked making quick work of a suit.  And, at last, what with bribery and feeing and pushing, a day was fixed for the final adjustment of my claim.  It came--the cause was heard and lost!  I should have been ruined, but for one circumstance; the old lady, my father's godmother, who had witnessed my first and concealed marriage, left me a pretty estate near Epsom.  I turned it into gold, and it was fortunate that I did so soon, as the reader is about to see.  The queen died; and a cloud already began to look menacing to the eyes of the Viscount Bolingbroke, and therefore to those of the Count Devereux.  \"We will weather out the shower,\" said Bolingbroke.  \"Could not you,\" said I, \"make our friend Oxford the Talapat?\"* and Bolingbroke laughed.  All men find wit in the jests broken on their enemies!   * A thing used by the Siamese for the same purpose as we now use the umbrella.  A work descriptive of Siam, by M. de la Loubere, in which the Talapat is somewhat minutely described, having been translated into English, and having excited some curiosity, a few years before Count Devereux now uses the word, the allusion was probably familiar.--ED.   One morning, however, I received a laconic note from him, which, notwithstanding its shortness and seeming gayety, I knew well signified that something not calculated for laughter had occurred.  I went, and found that his new Majesty had deprived him of the seals and secured his papers.  We looked very blank at each other.  At last, Bolingbroke smiled.  I must say that, culpable as he was in some points as a politician,--culpable, not from being ambitious (for I would not give much for the statesman who is otherwise), but from not having inseparably linked his ambition to the welfare of his country, rather than to that of a party; for, despite of what has been said of him, his ambition was never selfish,--culpable as he was when glory allured him, he was most admirable when danger assailed him!* and, by the shade of that Tully whom he so idolized, his philosophy was the most conveniently worn of any person's I ever met.  When it would have been in the way--at the supper of an actress, in the /levees/ of a court, in the boudoir of a beauty, in the arena of the senate, in the intrigue of the cabinet--you would not have observed a seam of the good old garment. But directly it was wanted--in the hour of pain, in the day of peril, in the suspense of exile, in (worst of all) the torpor of tranquillity--my extraordinary friend unfolded it piece by piece, wrapped himself up in it, sat down, defied the world, and uttered the most beautiful sentiments upon the comfort and luxury of his raiment, that can possibly be imagined.  It used to remind me, that same philosophy of his, of the enchanted tent in the Arabian Tale, which one moment lay wrapped in a nut-shell, and the next covered an army.   * I know well that it has been said otherwise, and that Bolingbroke has been accused of timidity for not staying in England, and making Mr. Robert Walpole a present of his head.  The elegant author of \"De Vere\" has fallen into a very great though a very hackneyed error, in lauding Oxford's political character, and condemning Bolingbroke's, because the former awaited a trial and the latter shunned it.  A very little reflection might perhaps have taught the accomplished novelist that there could be no comparison between the two cases, because there was no comparison between the relative danger of Oxford and Bolingbroke. Oxford, as their subsequent impeachment proved, was far more numerously and powerfully supported than his illustrious enemy: and there is really no earthly cause for doubting the truth of Bolingbroke's assertion; namely, that \"He had received repeated and certain information that a resolution was taken, by those who had power to execute it, to pursue him to the scaffold.\"  There are certain situations in which a brave and a good man should willingly surrender life--but I humbly opine that there may sometimes exist a situation in which he should preserve it; and if ever man was placed in that latter situation, it was Lord Bolingbroke.  To choose unnecessarily to put one's head under the axe, without benefiting any but one's enemies by the act, is, in my eyes, the proof of a fool, not a hero; and to attack a man for not placing his head in that agreeable and most useful predicament--for preferring, in short, to live for a world, rather than to perish by a faction--appears to be a mode of arguing that has a wonderful resemblance to nonsense. When Lord Bolingbroke was impeached, two men only out of those numerous retainers in the Lower House who had been wont so loudly to applaud the secretary of state, in his prosecution of those very measures for which he was now to be condemned,--two men only, General Ross and Mr. Hungerford, uttered a single syllable in defence of the minister disgraced.--ED.   Bolingbroke smiled, and quoted Cicero, and after an hour's conversation, which on his part was by no means like that of a person whose very head was in no enviable state of safety, he slid at once from a sarcasm upon Steele into a discussion as to the best measures to be adopted.  Let me be brief on this point.  Throughout the whole of that short session, he behaved in a manner more delicately and profoundly wise than, I think, the whole of his previous administration can equal.  He sustained with the most unflagging, the most unwearied, dexterity, the sinking spirits of his associates.  Without an act, or the shadow of an act, that could be called time-serving, he laid himself out to conciliate the king, and to propitiate Parliament; with a dignified prudence which, while it seemed above petty pique, was well calculated to remove the appearance of that disaffection with which he was charged, and discriminated justly between the king and the new administration, he lent his talents to the assistance of the monarch by whom his impeachment was already resolved on, and aided in the settlement of the civil list while he was in full expectation of a criminal accusation.  The new Parliament met, and all doubt was over.  An impeachment of the late administration was decided upon.

He took a chair, nodded to me not to dismiss my assistant, joined our conversation, and when conversation was merged in accounts, he took up a book of songs, and amused himself with it till my business was over and my disciple of Coke retired.  He then said, very slowly, and with a slight yawn, \"You have never been at Paris, I think?\"  \"Never: you are enchanted with that gay city.\"  \"Yes, but when I was last there, the good people flattered my vanity enough to bribe my taste.  I shall be able to form a more unbiased and impartial judgment in a few days.\"  \"A few days!\"  \"Ay, my dear Count: does it startle you?  I wonder whether the pretty De Tencin will be as kind to me as she was, and whether /tout le monde/ (that most exquisite phrase for five hundred people) will rise now at the Opera on my entrance.  Do you think that a banished minister can have any, the smallest resemblance to what he was when in power?  By Gumdragon, as our friend Swift so euphoniously and elegantly says, or swears, by Gumdragon, I think not!  What altered Satan so after his fall? what gave him horns and a tail?  Nothing but his disgrace.  Oh! years, and disease, plague, pestilence, and famine never alter a man so much as the loss of power.\"  \"You say wisely; but what am I to gather from your words? is it all over with us in real earnest?\"  \"Us! with /me/ it is indeed all over: /you/ may stay here forever.  I must fly: a packet-boat to Calais, or a room in the Tower, I must choose between the two.  I had some thoughts of remaining and confronting my trial: but it would be folly; there is a difference between Oxford and me.  He has friends, though out of power: I have none.  If they impeach him, he will escape; if they impeach me, they will either shut me up like a rat in a cage, for twenty years, till, old and forgotten, I tear my heart out with my confinement, or they will bring me at once to the block.  No, no: I must keep myself for another day; and, while they banish me, I will leave the seeds of the true cause to grow up till my return.  Wise and exquisite policy of my foes,--'/Frustra Cassium amovisti, si gliscere et vigere Brutorum emulos passurus es.'*  But I have no time to lose: farewell, my friend; God bless you; you are saved from these storms; and even intolerance, which prevented the exercise of your genius, preserves you now from the danger of having applied that genius to the welfare of your country.  Heaven knows, whatever my faults, I have sacrificed what I loved better than all things--study and pleasure--to her cause.  In her wars I served even my enemy Marlborough, in order to serve her; her peace I effected, and I suffer for it.  Be it so, I am        \"'Fidens animi atque in utrumque paratus.'**   \"Once more I embrace you; farewell.\"   * \"Vainly have you banished Cassius, if you shall suffer the rivals of the Brutuses to spread themselves and flourish.\"   ** \"Confident of soul and prepared for either fortune.\"   \"Nay,\" said I, \"listen to me; you shall not go alone.  France is already, in reality, my native country: there did I receive my birth; it is no hardship to return to my /natale solum/; it is an honour to return in the company of Henry St. John.  I will have no refusal: my law case is over; my papers are few; my money I will manage to transfer. Remember the anecdote you told me yesterday of Anaxagoras, who, when asked where his country was, pointed with his finger to heaven.  It is applicable, I hope, as well to me as to yourself: to me, uncelebrated and obscure; to you, the senator and the statesman.\"  In vain Bolingbroke endeavoured to dissuade me from this resolution; he was the only friend fate had left me, and I was resolved that misfortune should not part us.  At last he embraced me tenderly, and consented to what he could not resist.  \"But you cannot,\" he said, \"quit England to-morrow night, as I must.\"  \"Pardon me,\" I answered, \"the briefer the preparation, the greater the excitement, and what in life is equal to /that/?\"  \"True,\" answered Bolingbroke; \"to some natures, too restless to be happy, excitement can compensate for all,--compensate for years wasted, and hopes scattered,--compensate for bitter regret at talents perverted and passions unrestrained.  But we will talk philosophically when we have more leisure.  You will dine with me to-morrow: we will go to the play together; I promised poor Lucy that I would see her at the theatre, and I cannot break my word; and an hour afterwards we will commence our excursion to Paris.  And now I will explain to you the plan I have arranged for our escape.\"    CHAPTER III.  THE REAL ACTORS SPECTATORS TO THE FALSE ONES.  IT was a brilliant night at the theatre.  The boxes were crowded to excess.  Every eye was directed towards Lord Bolingbroke, who, with his usual dignified and consummate grace of manner, conversed with the various loiterers with whom, from time to time, his box was filled.  \"Look yonder,\" said a very young man, of singular personal beauty, \"look yonder, my Lord, what a panoply of smiles the Duchess wears to-night, and how triumphantly she directs those eyes, which they say were once so beautiful, to your box.\"  \"Ah,\" said Bolingbroke, \"her Grace does me too much honour: I must not neglect to acknowledge her courtesy; \"and, leaning over the box, Bolingbroke watched his opportunity till the Duchess of Marlborough, who sat opposite to him, and who was talking with great and evidently joyous vivacity to a tall, thin man, beside her, directed her attention, and that of her whole party, in a fixed and concentrated stare, to the imperilled minister.  With a dignified smile Lord Bolingbroke then put his hand to his heart, and bowed profoundly; the Duchess looked a little abashed, but returned the courtesy quickly and slightly, and renewed her conversation.  \"Faith, my Lord,\" cried the young gentleman who had before spoken, \"you managed that well!  No reproach is like that which we clothe in a smile, and present with a bow.\"  \"I am happy,\" said Lord Bolingbroke, \"that my conduct receives the grave support of a son of my political opponent.\"  \"/Grave/ support, my Lord! you are mistaken: never apply the epithet grave to anything belonging to Philip Wharton.  But, in sober earnest, I have sat long enough with you to terrify all my friends, and must now show my worshipful face in another part of the house.  Count Devereux, will you come with me to the Duchess's?\"  \"What! the Duchess's immediately after Lord Bolingbroke's!--the Whig after the Tory: it would be as trying to one's assurance as a change from the cold bath to the hot to one's constitution.\"  \"Well, and what so delightful as a trial in which one triumphs? and a change in which one does not lose even one's countenance?\"  \"Take care, my Lord,\" said Bolingbroke, laughing; \"those are dangerous sentiments for a man like you, to whom the hopes of two great parties are directed, to express so openly, even on a trifle and in a jest.\"  \"'Tis for that reason I utter them.  I like being the object of hope and fear to men, since my miserable fortune made me marry at fourteen, and cease to be aught but a wedded thing to the women.  But sup with me at the Bedford,--you, my Lord, and the Count.\"  \"And you will ask Walpole, Addison, and Steele,* to join us, eh?\" said Bolingbroke.  \"No, we have other engagements for to-night; but we shall meet again soon.\"   * All political opponents of Lord Bolingbroke.   And the eccentric youth nodded his adieu, disappeared, and a minute afterwards was seated by the side of the Duchess of Marlborough.  \"There goes a boy,\" said Bolingbroke, \"who, at the age of fifteen, has in him the power to be the greatest man of his day, and in all probability will only be the most singular.  An obstinate man is sure of doing well; a wavering or a whimsical one (which is the same thing) is as uncertain, even in his elevation, as a shuttlecock.  But look to the box at the right: do you see the beautiful Lady Mary?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Trefusis, who was with us, \"she has only just come to town.  'Tis said she and Ned Montagu live like doves.\"  \"How!\" said Lord Bolingbroke; \"that quick, restless eye seems to have very little of the dove in it.\"  \"But how beautiful she is!\" said Trefusis, admiringly.  \"What a pity that those exquisite hands should be so dirty!  It reminds me\" (Trefusis loved a coarse anecdote) \"of her answer to old Madame de Noailles, who made exactly the same remark to her.  'Do you call my hands dirty?' cried Lady Mary, holding them up with the most innocent /naivete/.  'Ah, Madame, /si vous pouviez voir mes pieds!'\"  \"/Fi donc/,\" said I, turning away; \"but who is that very small, deformed man behind her,--he with the bright black eye?\"  \"Know you not?\" said Bolingbroke; \"tell it not in Gath!--'tis a rising sun, whom I have already learned to worship,--the young author of the 'Essay on Criticism,' and 'The Rape of the Lock.' Egad, the little poet seems to eclipse us with the women as much as with the men.  Do you mark how eagerly Lady Mary listens to him, even though the tall gentleman in black, who in vain endeavours to win her attentions, is thought the handsomest gallant in London?  Ah, Genius is paid by smiles from all females but Fortune; little, methinks, does that young poet, in his first intoxication of flattery and fame, guess what a lot of contest and strife is in store for him.  The very breath which a literary man respires is hot with hatred, and the youthful proselyte enters that career which seems to him so glittering, even as Dame Pliant's brother in the 'Alchemist' entered town,--not to be fed with luxury, and diet on pleasure, but 'to learn to quarrel and live by his wits.'\"  The play was now nearly over.  With great gravity Lord Bolingbroke summoned one of the principal actors to his box, and bespoke a play for the next week; leaning then on my arm, he left the theatre."]]]
