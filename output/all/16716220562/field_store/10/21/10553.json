I could make him think he had help coming.  You wait until I get that drum.  I'll show you what's what.\"  Lights could now be seen moving on the mountain.  It seemed clear that men were massing there for some purpose.  Soon Frank and Jimmie were asleep.  Then Nestor asked:  \"George, do you remember whether the bolt in the corridor door of the Cameron suite turned under your key that night?  In other words, was the door locked?\"  \"I thought it was,\" was the reply.  \"But you are not certain?\"  \"No, because I was dazed when I opened the door and found the room dark and still.  I had expected to find Mr. Cameron at his desk, as there were lights there before I entered the building.\"  \"You saw no one on the stairs?\"  \"Not a soul.\"  \"When did you first meet Mr. Cameron?\"  \"Seven years ago, when I was selling newspapers.\"  \"He was a customer?\"  \"Yes, and a good one.  He talked with me quite a lot, and finally asked me to come to live with him and take a position in his office when I got older.\"  \"And you were glad to go?\"  \"Naturally.  My life was not a pleasant one.\"  \"Did he ever talk to you about that old life?\"  \"Often.  He asked me lots of questions about my parents.\"  \"And what did you tell him?\"  \"There was noting to tell.  I could not remember my parents.  At first there was Mother Scanlon, who beat me as often as she fed me, and then I was on the streets, sleeping in alleys and stairways.\"  \"Have you seen this Mother Scanlon lately?\" was the next question.  \"Never, but why are you asking me all these questions?  I'm no fairy prince under enchantment.  Just a waif left alone in New York.  There are plenty such.\"  \"I want you to look Mother Scanlon up when you get back to New York,\" Nestor said. He might have given some reason for the remark, only Jimmie and Frank awoke and called attention to signals on the mountain.  \"I know that wig-wag game,\" the latter said.  \"Keep still and I'll tell you what he says.\"  Four pair of eyes were instantly fixed on the heights above, where a slender column of flame, like a torch on fire most of its length, was plainly to be seen.  It was not a stationary column, however, for it moved to right and left in an arc of ninety degrees, starting at vertical and swinging back of it.  At times the point was lowered, as if the column had been dipped to the ground in front.  \"If he is talking United States instead of Spanish,\" Jimmie said, \"I'll read it for you. The Scouts use those signals.  The motion from vertical to right is ONE, that from vertical to left is TWO, and that from vertical to the front is THREE.  See!  It is United States, for there are two left motions, meaning A.  Now there's two twos and a one, repeated.  That means two 1's.  'All' is the word.\"  \"That is the way I read it,\" said Nestor.  \"Wait,\" said Jimmie.  \"He didn't give the signal which indicates the end of the word. Here's one two and two ones.  That means R. One one is I.  Two twos and two ones make G.  One one and two twos make H.  One two makes T.  There!  He's said 'All Right,' and in English.  Now, what are Americans doing up there?\"  \"That may not be the end of the message,\" suggested Fremont.  \"See the three threes?\" asked Jimmie.  \"That means the end of the sentence. Now, there's double two, double two, double two, triple three.  That means for the other fellow, who must be down the mountain somewhere, to quit signaling. He's gettin' exclusive, eh?\"  \"I don't understand why those signals are in English,\" said Nestor. \"There are plenty of Americans mixed up in this mess, but they are not doing the signaling, so far as I have heard.  It would seem that the wig-wag ought to be in Spanish. I wonder if I could get down the mountain to the man there?  It would be easier than climbing.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" decided Frank.  \"If I fall it will be like rolling a feather bed down the mountains.  Besides, you may need assistance.\"  And before the others could protest, the two boys were on their way down the steep descent.    CHAPTER VIII.  A STRANGE DISAPPEARANCE.  It was weirdly lonely in the dark little dent on the side of the mountain after the departure of the two boys, and Jimmie drew closer to his companion.  The wind which swept the heights was chilly.  The two lay close together in silence for a long time, each, doubtless, thinking of the Great White Way and the lights which would now be glittering there, of the bay, of the East River with its shipping, and of the hundred things which make New York a city, once seen, to be remembered forever.  Then a rumble as of a stone crashing down came to their ears and they sprang to their feet.  \"There's some one coming,\" whispered Jimmie, and they listened, but the only sound they heard was made by a bird winging its way through the dim upper light.  Then, in a moment, signals flashed out again.  \"One, two, one,\" counted Jimmie,  \"Now, two, one, one, two, two, one, and then one, two.  That means come.  Now, where does he want the other fellow to come?\"  \"There's a lot going on here to-night,\" said Fremont.  \"I wonder if they can see us from where they are?\"  \"We may as well get away from the tents,\" was the reply.  \"There's a good place to hide behind that rock.  When Nestor and Frank come we can let them know where we are.\"  Fremont agreed to this, and the lads were soon hidden in a shallow gully which cut a ridge not far from where the tents had been pitched. For a time all was still, then came the rattling of steel on steel, sounding threatening enough in the darkness.  \"Some one's got a gun,\" whispered Jimmie.  \"Our fire may have been seen from above,\" Fremont ventured.  \"Well, they can't find us here,\" consoled Jimmie.  \"Anyway, we'll lie here and listen for a few minutes.\"  The boys lay quiet for a considerable time.  There were no more signals then, but they could not banish the feeling that emissitious Mexicans were watching them from the shadows.  Directly noises were heard at the tents and a voice asked, in good English:  \"Where are they?  You said that only two went down the mountain.\"  \"That was right,\" was the reply.  \"I don't see where the others can be.\"  \"Do you think they are officers?\" asked Jimmie, as the men stumbled about the tents.  \"They aren't Mexicans.\"  \"I'm afraid they are officers,\" replied Fremont, \"and we must keep pretty still.  I presume these are the fellows who were wig-wagging a little while ago.\"  The intruders were heard moving about the tents for a time, and then they went away, blundering along over loose stones which rattled as they swept down the declivity.  When they were some distance off, and still going, judging by the sound, the boys walked back to the tents and tried to sleep, but the excitement of the time was too much for them, and they could not keep their eyes closed.  After a time there came a commotion in the valley below, from the direction Nestor and Frank had taken.  There were shouts of rage and then shooting.  Jimmie was on his feet instantly.  \"They're attacking Nestor,\" he cried, \"and I'm going down there to help him.\"  Before Fremont could protest the boy was off, scrambling down the mountain in the darkness like a goat.  At first Fremont thought of following him, but he was very tired and sleepy and so gave it up.  He crept back into a tent and threw himself down on a blanket, closing his eyes only for a moment, as he thought.  Jimmie pressed on down the slope for some distance without discovering the source of the disturbance, then turned back.  When, near the tents, he turned and looked over the valley, a torch far below was spelling out \"O.K.\"  \"There are a lot of Americans mixed up in this,\" the boy thought. \"I've heard that this revolt was being financed and executed by our people, but I did not believe the story.  Anyhow, they are giving their signals in United states.\"  As the lad approached nearer to the tents the silence which held the little dent on the slope sent a vague shiver of alarm through his veins.  When he came to the tents there was no one in sight.  He whistled softly, but there was no reply.  The moon, now peeping around a shoulder of the mountain, struck an object which glistened like silver, and the boy picked it up.  It was Fremont's revolver, and the chambers were full.  There had been no shooting.  Fremont's cap lay on the ground not far from where the weapon had been found.  Filled with apprehension, Jimmie dashed into the tents.  They were both empty. The boy had disappeared, leaving his weapon and his cap behind. It was plain to be seen, from marks on the rocks and the thin soil of the dent, that there had been a struggle.  Alarmed beyond the power of words to express, Jimmie crept into the hiding place they had used earlier in the evening and waited.  He was angry at Nestor for going away, and angry with himself for leaving Fremont alone. While the latter possessed courage and strength, he was not as apt in such things as they were facing as his companions.  He had been sheltered for years in the Cameron home, and was not so resourceful as his companions, not so ready to take advantage of any point which might occur in such a rough-and-tumble game as was now in progress.  Jimmie's fear was that Fremont had been captured by officers, and would be taken back to New York and thrust into the Tombs to await the action of the grand jury, based on the recovery or death of Mr. Cameron.  This would be fatal to all his hopes.  While the boy pondered and fretted over the matter, the long roll of a drum came around a cliff-corner, and then a file of ragged soldiers, or what seemed to be such, showed in the moonlight, with a diminutive drummer-boy, pounding for dear life, not far in the rear.  In the meantime the two who were in Jimmie's thoughts were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21913"],["title","The Talking Leaves: An Indian Story (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustration.

STODDARD        [Frontispiece: \"Halt!  They've brought out the boys\"]     Harper & Brothers Publishers New York and London Copyright, 1882, by Harper & Brothers Copyright, 1910, by William O. Stoddard     THE TALKING LEAVES  AN INDIAN STORY   CHAPTER I  \"Look, Rita! look!\"  \"What can it mean, Ni-ha-be?\"  \"See them all get down and walk about.\"  \"They have found something in the grass.\"  \"And they're hunting for more.\"  Rita leaned forward till her long hair fell upon the neck of the beautiful little horse she was riding, and looked with all her eyes.  \"Hark! they are shouting.\"  \"You could not hear them if they did.\"  \"They look as if they were.\"  Ni-ha-be sat perfectly still in her silver-mounted saddle, although her spirited mustang pony pawed the ground and pulled on his bit as if he were in a special hurry to go on down the side of the mountain.  The two girls were of about the same size, and could not either of them have been over fifteen years old.  They were both very pretty, very well dressed and well mounted, and they could both speak in a strange, rough, and yet musical language; but there was no other resemblance between them.  \"Father is there, Rita.\"  \"Can you see him?\"  \"Yes, and so is Red Wolf.\"  \"Your eyes are wonderful.  Everybody says they are.\"  Ni-ha-be might well be proud of her coal-black eyes, and of the fact that she could see so far and so well with them.  It was not easy to say just how far away was that excited crowd of men down there in the valley.  The air was so clear, and the light so brilliant among those snow-capped mountain ranges, that even things far off seemed sometimes close at hand.  For all that there were not many pairs of eyes, certainly not many brown ones like Rita's, which could have looked, as Ni-ha-be did, from the pass into the faces of her father and brother and recognized them at such a distance.  She need not have looked very closely to be sure of one thing more--there was not a single white man to be seen in all that long, deep, winding green valley.  Were there any white women?  There were plenty of squaws, old and young, but not one woman with a bonnet, shawl, parasol, or even so much as a pair of gloves. Therefore, none of them could have been white.  Rita was as well dressed as Ni-ha-be, and her wavy masses of brown hair were tied up in the same way, with bands of braided deer-skin, but neither of them had ever seen a bonnet.  Their sunburnt, healthy faces told that no parasol had ever protected their complexions, but Ni-ha-be was a good many shades the darker.  There must have been an immense amount of hard work expended in making the graceful garments they both wore.  All were of fine antelope-skin; soft, velvety, fringed, and worked and embroidered with porcupine quills.  Frocks and capes and leggings and neatly fitting moccasins, all of the best, for Ni-ha-be was the only daughter of a great Apache chief, and Rita was every bit as important a person according to Indian notions, for Ni-ha-be's father had adopted her as his own.  Either one of them would have been worth a whole drove of ponies or a wagon-load of guns and blankets, and the wonder was that they had been permitted to loiter so far behind their friends on a march through that wild, strange, magnificent land.  Had they been farther to the east, or south, or north, it is likely they would have been kept with the rest pretty carefully; but Many Bears and his band were on their way home from a long buffalo-hunt, and were already, as they thought, safe in the Apache country--away beyond any peril from other tribes of Indians, or from the approach of the hated and dreaded white men.  To be sure, there were grizzly bears and wolves and other wild animals to be found among those mountain passes, but they were not likely to remain very near a band of hunters like the one now gathered in that valley.  Great hunters, brave warriors, well able to take care of themselves and their families, but just now they were very much excited about something--something on the ground.  The younger braves, to the number of more than a hundred, were standing back respectfully, while the older and more experienced warriors carefully examined a number of deep marks on the grass around a bubbling spring.  There had been a camp there not long before, and the first discovery made by the foremost Apache who had ridden up to that spring was that it had not been a camp of his own people.  The prints of the hoofs of horses showed that they had been shod, and there are neither horseshoes nor blacksmiths among the red men of the South-west.  The tracks left by the feet of men were not such as can be made by moccasins.  There are no heels on moccasins, and no nails in the soles of them.  Even if there had been Indian feet in the boots, the toes would not have been turned out in walking.  Only white men do that.  So much was plain at a mere glance; but there were a good many other things to be studied and interpreted before Many Bears and his followers could feel satisfied.  It was a good deal like reading a newspaper.  Nobody tears one up till it has been read through, and the Apaches did not trample the ground around the spring till they had searched out all that the other tramplings could tell them.  Then the dark-faced, ferocious looking warriors who had made the search all gathered around their chief and, one after another, reported what they had found.  There had been a strong party of white men at that spot three days before; three wagons, drawn by mule teams; many spare mules; twenty-five men who rode horses, besides the men who drove the wagons.  \"Were they miners?\"  Every warrior and chief was ready to say \"No\" at once.  \"Traders?\"  No, it could not have been a trading-party.  \"All right,\" said Many Bears, with a solemn shake of his gray head. \"Blue-coats--cavalry.  Come from Great Father at Washington--no stay in Apache country--go right through--not come back--let them go.\"  Indian sagacity had hit the nail exactly on the head; for that had been a camp of a United States military exploring expedition, looking for passes and roads, and with instructions to be as friendly as possible with any wandering red men they might meet.  Nothing could be gained by following such a party as that, and Many Bears and his band began at once to arrange their own camp, for their morning's march through the pass had been a long and fatiguing one.  If the Apache chief had known a very little more, he would have sent his best scouts back upon the trail that squad of cavalry had come by, till he found out whether all who were travelling by that road had followed it as far as the spring.  He might thus have learned something of special importance to him.  Then, at the same time, he would have sent other scouts back upon his own trail, to see if anybody was following him, and what for.  He might have learned a good deal more important news in that way.  He did nothing of the kind; and so a very singular discovery was left for Rita and Ni-ha-be to make, without any help at all.  As they rode out from the narrow pass, down the mountain-side, and came into the valley, it was the most natural thing in the world for them to start their swift mustangs on a free gallop; not directly toward the camping-place, for they knew well enough that no girls of any age would be permitted to approach very near to warriors gathered in council. Away to the right they rode, following the irregular curve of the valley, side by side, managing the fleet animals under them as if horse and rider were one person.  So it came to pass that before the warriors had completed their task the two girls had struck the trail along which the blue-coated cavalry had entered the valley.  \"Rita, I see something.\"  \"What is it?\"  \"Come!  See!  Away yonder.\"  Rita's eyes were as good as anybody's, always excepting Apaches' and eagles', and she could see the white fluttering object at which her adopted sister was pointing.  The marks of the wheels and all the other signs of that trail, as they rode along, were quite enough to excite a pair of young ladies who had never seen a road, a pavement, a sidewalk, or anything of the sort; but when they came to that white thing fluttering at the foot of a mesquite-bush they both sprung from their saddles at the same instant.  One, two, three--a good deal dog's-eared and thumb-worn, for they had been read by every man of the white party who cared to read them before they were thrown away, but they were very wonderful yet.  Nothing of the kind had ever before been imported into that region of the country.  Ni-ha-be's keen black eyes searched them in vain, one after another, for anything she had ever seen before.  \"Rita, you are born white.  What are they?\"  Poor Rita!  Millions and millions of girls have been \"born white,\" and lived and died with whiter faces than her own rosy but sun-browned beauty could boast, and yet never looked into the fascinating pages of an illustrated magazine.  How could any human being have cast away in the wilderness such a treasure?  Rita was sitting on the grass, with one of the strange prizes open in her lap, rapidly turning the leaves, and more excited by what she saw than were Many Bears and his braves by all they were discovering upon the trampled level around the spring.  \"Rita,\" again exclaimed Ni-ha-be, \"what are they?\"  \"They are talking leaves,\" said Rita.
