CHAPTER I.  THE MEETING IN BOSTON.        \"MR. JOHN DIAMOND, Lexington, Pa.: If you wish cruise in down East      waters, join me Monday next at American Hotel, Boston. Have      purchased yacht. Hodge and Browning will be in party. Great sport      anticipated.       \"MERRIWELL.\"  Jack Diamond was reclining in a hammock suspended in the shade of an artificial arbor when this message from Frank Merriwell was handed to him by a boy. He tore open the envelope and read it, his eyes beginning to sparkle and a flush coming to his handsome, aristocratic face.  \"Just like him!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Before leaving Fardale he aroused our curiosity about that part of the country, and now he proposes taking us down there in his own yacht. Will I go? Will I? I wouldn't miss it for the world!\"  It had not taken him a minute to decide.         *       *       *       *       *  A cab rattled up to the front of the American Hotel, on Hanover Street, Boston, and stopped. The door flew open, and out stepped a smartly dressed young man, wearing russet shoes, a light-colored box coat and a brown Alpine hat. He carried a handsome alligator-skin traveling bag in his hand.  Paying cabbie without speaking a word, this youth turned and walked into the hotel. As he entered, a colored boy hastened forward and relieved him of his traveling bag. He stepped up to the clerk's desk and said:  \"I am Jack Diamond, of Virginia, and I wish to see Mr. Frank Merriwell, who is stopping here.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said the clerk, politely. \"Mr. Merriwell left orders that you be shown up immediately on your arrival. Twenty-three, show Mr. Diamond to Mr. Merriwell's rooms.\"  \"Right this way, sah,\" said the colored boy.  Jack followed the uniformed bell boy, who paused at the elevator shaft and pressed a button. In a moment the elevator came gliding noiselessly down, the door slid open, a lady and a gentleman stepped out and Diamond stepped in.  \"Third,\" said the bell boy, and then he turned and disappeared, while the elevator man closed the door and sent the car gliding upward. He stopped at the third floor, and, to Jack's surprise, the bell boy with the grip was there, calmly awaiting his arrival.  Jack followed him to the door of a room at the front of the house. As the boy lifted his hand to knock at the door, there was a burst of laughter within, plainly heard, as the transom was open, and Frank Merriwell's voice cried:  \"Hans, if you could tell that story on the stage just as you told it then you would make your fortune.\"  \"Vot vos der madder mit me?\" exclaimed the voice of Hans Dunnerwust, Frank's German friend. \"Dot nefer vos a funny stories! You don'd seen vot I larft ad! Dot peen a bathetic sdory. I oxbected you vould took mein handkersheft oudt und cried id indo, but you sed roundt und laugh ad dot bathetic sdory like I vos a lot of monkeys. You don't like dot as vell as I might!\"  Then there was another burst of laughter, and the knock of the bell boy was not heard.  \"Never mind,\" said Diamond, taking his traveling bag and giving the boy a dime; \"I'll go right in.\"  He opened the door and stepped into the room.  Hodge, Browning, Merriwell and Dunnerwust were there. Bart was tilted back in a chair, with his feet on the table, while lazy Bruce was half sitting and half reclining on a sofa. Frank sat astride a chair, looking over the back of it at Hans, who had stood in the middle of the room as he told his \"bathetic sdory.\"  \"Hello, fellows!\" cried the lad from Virginia, heartily.  There was a shout of welcome. Frank sprang forward quickly and grasped Diamond's hand.  \"Delighted, old man!\" laughed Merry. \"I was afraid you wouldn't come till I received your telegram stating that you would be on hand. Any trouble in persuading the mother?\"  \"Not much, though she said it did seem that I might remain at home a while longer, and she told me to tell you that she is beginning to get jealous of you, as I spend so much of my time during vacations with you.\"  \"How you vos, Shack?\" said Hans, getting hold of Diamond's free hand, the latter having dropped his traveling bag. \"I vos a sight vor sore eyes, ain'd you! You don'd knew how dickled you vos to seen me.\"  Hodge came forward and shook hands, expressing his pleasure, and, with sundry grunts, Browning succeeded in getting upon his feet, saying as he rose:  \"Suppose I'll have to stand to shake, or you'll challenge me. You Southerners are so confoundedly particular about courtesy and all that.\"  Jack smiled.  \"I know you too well to resent it if you lay on your back and offered to shake hands with me. In fact, it surprises me to discover you hadn't rather fight a duel after you were obliged to get up than to get up when not absolutely forced to do so.\"  \"What baggage did you bring?\" asked Merry.  \"A trunk. It will be brought to the hotel here.\"  \"There is no room for trunks on board the _White Wings_,\" said Frank. \"You'll have to store your trunk and such stuff as you do not absolutely need till we get back here.\"  \"The _White Wings_? Is that the name of your yacht?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Good name. How did you happen to buy a yacht?\"  \"Got a bargain of her. I came on to Boston with Miss Burrage, whose aunt was waiting here for her. I met Jack Benjamin. You remember him?\"  \"Harvard man?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Plays football?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I remember him. His sister is a stunningly handsome girl.\"  \"Huah!\" grunted Browning. \"That explains how you happen to remember him.\"  \"Well,\" Frank went on. \"Benjamin turned out to be a fine fellow. Invited me over to his house, treated me beautifully. He knows a lot of sporty chaps. Among them was Walter Pringle, who owned this yacht. Pringle took a party of us out for a cruise down the bay, and we had a grand time. Went to Nantasket. Coming back Pringle said he had planned to cruise down to the eastward this summer with a party of friends, but something had come up that knocked out the arrangement. Then it was that I thought of a talk we once had while at Fardale about making a cruise down along the Maine coast, and I spoke of it. Said I'd like to own his yacht. Saw Pringle looked a little queer. He stared at me a few moments, and then asked what I would give for the _White Wings_. I questioned him some about her, and then made an offer. He didn't take me up, but the next day he came and told me the yacht was mine. I was astonished, for I didn't offer much more than one-half what she is really worth. But he said he must have the money without delay, as he was going to get out of Boston in a hurry. I dispatched Prof. Scotch, and he wired me the amount. I bought the boat, and now I hear Pringle has left for Seattle, on his way to Alaska. His father is hot over it, for he didn't want his son to go. Pringle had the fever, and he sold the yacht in a hurry to raise money to go with. I have a bargain. We can make our cruise, and then, when it is over, by looking about, I'll be able to get rid of the _White Wings_ for more than I paid for her.\"  \"Are you sure the transaction is all right?\" asked Diamond.  \"All right? How do you mean?\"  \"Why, strictly on the level. Pringle is not a minor?\"  \"No,\" grunted Browning; \"but he has gone to be a miner.\"  \"Here! here!\" cried Frank, quickly; \"that won't do. It's prohibited.\"  \"It may be when we get on board the _White Wings_, but we're ashore now, and you are not Capt. Merriwell yet.\"  \"Pringle is twenty-one,\" said Frank, answering Diamond's question. \"He is all right.\"  \"And he was sole owner of the yacht? He had the right to sell her?\"  \"Of course. Benjamin told me Pringle was strictly on the level.\"  \"Well, you're always lucky!\" exclaimed the lad from Virginia. \"Now you will get the fun of this cruise, and, when it is over, you'll be likely to sell the yacht for enough so that you will come out ahead on the whole deal, expenses included.\"  \"I hope to,\" acknowledged Frank, laughing. \"I considered it a snap, but that was not why I wanted the boat. I wanted to make the cruise with my friends. Here are five of us, and that is all the _White Wings_ will carry with absolute comfort. There is plenty of room for us. We'll make a jolly cruise of it, fellows, and I don't believe we'll ever regret going. I have the boat stocked with provisions, and some Jew tailors up by Scollay Square are at work on uniforms for four of us. We'll go out right away, Jack, and you shall be measured for yours. Come on.\"     CHAPTER II.  INZA AND PAULA.   Frank and Jack left the American House and turned toward Scollay Square.  \"These tailors are rushers,\" said Merry. \"They have made a reputation by turning out work in short order. That is why we ordered the suits of them. You know we sail to-morrow morning.\"  \"What? Not to-morrow?\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Well, they will not have time to make up a suit for me.\"  \"Oh, yes, they will.\"  \"Impossible.\"  \"Not at all, old man. They will get the work out in a hurry, as I shall pay them to do it.\"  \"But I never heard of such a thing.\"  \"Possibly not. You are in Boston now. In Virginia they require more time to accomplish anything. Down in this part of the country things move.\"  Diamond could hardly believe that he could obtain a suit to order in such a short time.  They came to Scollay Square, into which trolley cars were pouring from various sections, and soon they reached the store of the Jew tailors. It was a large store, and at least a dozen customers were looking over samples, striking bargains or being measured. However, the boys were not forced to wait, for one of the proprietors came forward, greeted Frank by name, and said:  \"Your order will be ready for you on time, Mr. Merriwell.\"  \"We sail at nine o'c"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22265"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Cruise (#1)"],["body","to-morrow morning,\" said Frank. \"Here is a friend of mine who will require a suit like the others.\"  \"That is crowding us somewhat, sir,\" smiled the tailor. \"I hardly think we can----\"  \"I will pay five dollars extra if the suit is delivered at the American House at six o'clock in the morning,\" said Frank, quietly.  \"Very well, sir. I think that will cover the extra expense of rushing it through. If the gentleman will step back this way, his measure will be taken.\"  So Jack was measured, and, ten minutes after entering the store, the boys left it.  \"He didn't even ask a deposit of you, Merry,\" said Jack, in surprise.  \"No. Benjamin vouched for me, and that was all that was necessary. No deposit was required under such circumstances.\"  \"What if he fails to get the suits round on time?\"  \"He won't. He wouldn't want them left on his hands.\"  Frank's confidence reassured Jack, and they strolled over toward Tremont Street and finally came out at the Common.  \"I'd like to have a little time to look Boston over?\" said Jack.  \"You can do that when we come back. If you were to stop long enough to take in all the interesting sights, we wouldn't get down into Maine this summer. I want to spend a little more time in Boston, although I have seen Faneuil Hall, the new Public Library Building, the Old South Church, Bunker Hill Monument and a hundred other interesting things. The business portion of Boston is not particularly attractive, but the suburbs and the aristocratic dwelling sections are beautiful.\"  They walked across the Common to the Public Gardens, then turned round and strolled back. From Tremont Row they went down Temple Street to Washington, and just as they reached Jordan, Marsh & Co.'s store, two girls stepped out upon the sidewalk and came face to face with them.  \"Miss Burrage!\" exclaimed Diamond, lifting his hat.  \"Inza!\" cried Frank, also lifting his hat. \"Miss Benjamin, too! This is an unexpected pleasure. Miss Benjamin, permit me to present a particular friend of mine, Mr. Jack Diamond, of Virginia.\"  Paula Benjamin was a pretty girl. Her eyes met Jack's, and she showed her pearly teeth in a most bewitching smile as she bowed, saying:  \"I have heard of Mr. Diamond.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I was not aware I was quite as famous.\"  \"Yes. My brother mentioned you. Perhaps you know something of him--his name is Jack. He plays on the Harvard eleven.\"  \"And he spoke of me? That is surprising. Don't see what he could have said about me.\"  \"I don't believe I will tell,\" laughed the girl, and her manner aroused all of the Virginian's curiosity.  \"Please tell,\" he urged, smiling.  \"Well,\" hesitated Paula, still laughing, \"before the game on Jarvis Field, he said you were fool enough to think Frank Merriwell could beat the whole Harvard eleven. After the game he said you weren't half the fool he took you for.\"  This caused them all to laugh, and, as the street was crowded, they strolled on together.  \"Oh, Frank!\" exclaimed Inza; \"you can't guess what we are going to do!\"  \"Then I will give it up without trying. What is it?\"  \"Paula and I are going to Bar Harbor.\"  \"What?\"  \"It's true.\"  \"I am astonished!\"  \"I knew you would be. We've been talking about it, you know--saying we'd like to go. Yesterday Paula had a letter from her cousin, who is spending the summer down there. Her cousin urged her to come. Paula's mother said it was impossible, as two girls like us should not be traveling about alone. Then Aunt Abigail said she'd like to spend a week or two in Bar Harbor herself, and she volunteered to chaperone us. After a while, Paula obtained her mother's consent, and we take the Bangor boat for Rockland to-morrow night.\"  \"By Jove, this is interesting! We'll have to run in to Bar Harbor and see you on our cruise. I didn't suppose we would see much of each other after leaving Fardale.\"  \"I didn't know as you would care about that,\" said Inza, carelessly.  \"Care!\" exclaimed Frank. \"You should know I would care. How can you say anything like that! What made you imagine I wouldn't care?\"  \"Oh, something!\"  \"Something! What was it? Tell me, Inza.\"  \"Sometime--perhaps.\"  \"Tell me now,\" urged Frank, in his masterful way. \"During the last of my stay in Fardale I noticed a change in your treatment of me, Inza.\"  \"Did you?\" she murmured, lifting her eyebrows.  \"Yes. You were cold toward me, and you seemed to shun me. If I tried to be friendly, as in the old days, you would not give me the opportunity. I did not understand it.\"  \"That is singular. The reason was plain enough.\"  \"If so, I must have been thick-witted.\"  \"Elsie Bellwood was there.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"I read your secret. You made your choice between us.\"  Frank was astounded.  \"Choice? What can you mean, Inza? I did not make any choice.\"  \"Oh, but you did!\"  \"If you say so--but I--really----\"  \"You made your choice that time when the boat upset, and we were struggling in the water, Elsie and I. You plunged in to her rescue. I was quite as near to you as was Elsie--nearer, if anything.\"  Frank caught his breath, beginning to realize what she meant. Inza went on:  \"You swam to Elsie's rescue--you saved her. That was the test. I brought it about, for I upset the boat intentionally to settle the point. I wanted to know which one of us you cared the most for--and I found out!\"  It was like her, Frank realized that. He knew she was telling the truth when she said she upset the boat intentionally.  \"But you--you could swim some, Inza. I knew it.\"  \"Did you know Elsie could not swim?\"  \"N--no.\"  \"She is the daughter of a sea captain, and she has been with him on many voyages. There was every reason to suppose that she could swim quite as well as I--or better. No, Frank, you made your choice between us that day. It's all right,\" and she forced a laugh that was not very musical. \"I don't deny that, at one time, I did think more of you than any other fellow. There was every reason why I should. You saved me from a mad dog, saved me from death beneath a railroad engine, saved me from drowning. But I am not a fool, if I am a girl! I have not been taking stock in all the passionate love stories I have read. I got out of the way. I remained Elsie's friend, for she is the sweetest girl I know. I don't blame you for thinking more of her than you do of me.\"  \"Inza!\"  Frank uttered the word in protest; it was all he could say.  \"You can't deny it, so don't try,\" came almost harshly from the girl. \"It's all right. We're still friends. We'll always be friends--nothing more. Sometime I'll be bridesmaid at the wedding, and----\"  But Frank had heard enough, and he stopped her.  \"I am not likely to marry anyone very soon,\" he said. \"Elsie knows that. Let's talk about something else. How did it happen we met you?\"  Inza seemed willing enough to permit the conversation to be turned into another channel.  \"We were out shopping, you know--making our last purchases before starting for Bar Harbor. You must take us out on your yacht after we all get down there.\"  \"I'll do it. Your aunt----\"  \"Oh, she will not object. You know she thinks you the finest fellow in all the world. She will come along.\"  At last the boys were forced to part from the girls, but Jack had made such progress with Paula that she offered him her hand at parting, saying laughingly:  \"Next fall you will not pick the winner if you pick Yale, even if Mr. Merriwell is on that eleven. If you want to keep your record for wisdom, be careful.\"  \"Jove!\" exclaimed Jack, after they had seen the girls on board a car. \"She's a way-upper, Merry!\"  \"She's a good sample of the Boston girl.\"  \"Eh? Where's her glasses?\"  \"You have been reading the comic papers.\"  \"She didn't mention Emerson or Browning.\"  \"And that surprised you?\"  \"Why, I didn't suppose the genuine Boston girl could talk ten minutes without doing so.\"  \"Boston girls are very much like other nice girls, old man. They are well educated, refined and all that, but they are not always quoting Emerson and Browning, they do not all wear glasses, they are not all cold and freezing and they are handsome.\"  They came to Cornhill. A car was coming down from Scollay Square, and they paused close to it to let it swing out upon Washington Street.  Just as the front of the car approached, Frank Merriwell received a push from behind that sent him flat upon the track directly in front of the car wheels!  That particular car did not have a fender, and it seemed that Frank must be mangled beneath the wheels. The motorman saw the lad go down and put on the brake hard, but he could not stop the car in time.  Frank realized that he had been pushed upon the track by some one whose deliberate purpose it was to maim or murder him, but he could not save himself. He struck the paving, and the iron wheels seemed right upon him.  But Jack Diamond moved with marvelous quickness. He made a grasp at Frank as the latter fell, almost caught him, then stooped, grasped his coat and yanked Merry from the track.  The car brushed Frank as it passed, but he was not injured.  \"Thank you, old man,\" said Merriwell, as he quickly rose to his feet. \"You saved me that time. But who pushed me?\"  They looked about. A small crowd had witnessed Frank's peril and gathered. In the crowd was a person slipping away. With a bound Frank was after him, caught him by the shoulder, swung him to get a look at his face.  \"Get out!\"  The fellow snarled the words and struck at Frank's face with his clinched hand.  Frank dodged.  \"Wat Snell!\" he cried, astounded.  \"Yes, Wat Snell!\" grated the other, who was a boy well known to him--a boy who had been his enemy years before at Fardale Academy, when they both went to school.  \"You pushed me!\" accused Frank.  \"You lie! I did not touch you! You fell.\"  \"I felt you push me, you miserable dog!\"  \"Don't dare talk like that to me!\" hissed Snell. \"I'll have you----\"  \"What! You don't dare do anything that is cowardly and treacherous! You did push me!\"  \"That's right!\" exclaimed a boy. \"I seen "]]]
