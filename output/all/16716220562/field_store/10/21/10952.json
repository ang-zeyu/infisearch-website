Get busy, captains!\"  Forthwith the choosing began. Dick chose all his chums for his own eleven. And no boy lower than seventh grade was allowed on either team.  \"Now, who'll be referee?\" demanded Dick. \"Captain Craig, have you any choice?\"  \"Have we got any fellows, not on either team, who really know the rules?\" asked Tom Craig dubiously.  There was a hush, for this was surely a stumbling block. It seemed clear that a referee ought to know the rules of the game.  \"What's up, kids?\" called a friendly voice.  The speaker was Len Spencer, a young man who had been graduated from the High School the June before, and who was now serving his apprenticeship as reporter on one of the two local daily papers, the morning \"Blade.\"  \"Oh, see here, Len!\" called Dick joyously. \"You're just the right fellow for us. You know the football rules?\"  \"I have a speaking acquaintance with 'em,\" laughed Len.  Dick rapidly outlined what was being planned, adding:  \"You can put that in the 'Blade' to-morrow morning, Len, and state our challenge to North and South Grammars. Won't you?\"  \"Surely.\"  \"But we want to practise this afternoon,\" Dick continued earnestly, \"and we haven't any referee. Len, can't you spare us a little time? Won't you boss the first practice for us?\"  \"All right,\" agreed Len, after a little thought. \"I'll tackle it for a while. Have you got your teams picked?\"  \"Teams all picked, and the ball ready. We'll have to place stones for goal posts, though.\"  \"Hustle and do it, then,\" commanded Len. \"I can't stay here forever.\"  Five minutes later the field was as ready as it could be made.  \"Captains will now attend the toss-up,\" ordered Len Spencer, producing a coin from one of his pockets. \"Heads for Craig, tails for Prescott.\"  It fell head up, and Craig chose his goal, and also the first kick-off.  Dick had been busily engaged in making up his line and backfield. There was some delay while Tom Craig accomplished this same thing.  \"Now, one thing that all you youngsters want to remember,\" declared Len, \"is that no player can play off-side. All ready?\"  Both young football captains called out that they were. Len had provided himself with a pocket whistle loaned by one of the fifth-grade boys.  Trill-ll! Tom Craig kicked the ball himself, but it was a poor kick. The pigskin soon struck the ground.  \"I'll try that over again,\" announced Tom.  But Dick and his own fighting line had already started. Dick, at center, with Dave on his right hand and Greg Holmes on his left, snatched up the ball and started with it for the Rustlers' goal.  A bunch of Rustlers opposed and tackled Prescott. Dick succeeded, by the help of Dave and Greg, in breaking through the line, but the Rustlers turned and were after him. Down went Dick, but he had the pigskin under him.  \"Take it away from him, fellows!\" panted Craig. But Len blew his whistle, following up the signal by some sharp commands that brought the struggle to a close.  \"Prescott's side have the ball,\" declared Len, \"and will now play off a snap-back. And, boys, one thing I must emphasize. I've told you that under the rules no man may play off-side. So, hereafter, if I find any of you off-side, I'm going to penalize that eleven.\"  Dick was whispering to some of his players, for, without any code of signals, he must thus instruct his fellows in the play that was to be made with the ball.  Then the whistle sounded. The Rangers put the ball through the Rustlers' line, and onward for some fifteen yards before the ball was once more down.  \"Good work, Prescott,\" nodded Len Spencer. \"Now, pass your orders for the next play, then hustle into line and snap-back.\"  Len placed the whistle between his lips and was about to blow it when Dave Darrin darted forward, holding up one hand.  \"What's the trouble?\" asked Len.  \"Mr. Referee, count the men on the other team.\"  \"Fifteen players,\" summed up Len. \"That's too many. Captain Craig, you'll have to shed four men.\"  \"Oh, let him have 'em all,\" begged Dick serenely. \"Craig'll need 'em all to keep us from breaking through with the ball.\"  At blast of the whistle the pigskin was promptly in play again, both teams starting in with Indian yells. There was plenty of enthusiasm, but little or no skill. The thing became so mixed up that Len ran closer.  A human heap formed. Greg Holmes was somewhere down near the bottom of that mix-up, holding on to the ball for all he was worth. Over him sprawled struggling Rangers and fighting Rustlers. Other players, from both teams, darted forward, hurling themselves onto the heap with immense enthusiasm.  \"The ball is down,\" remarked one eager young spectator disgustedly. \"Len oughter blow his whistle.\"  \"Yes, where's the whistle?\" demanded other close-by spectators.  From somewhere away down toward the bottom of the heap came Len Spencer's muffled remark:  \"I'll blow the whistle all right, if half a hundred of you Indians will get off my face for a minute!\"  \"Come out of that tangle, all of you,\" ordered Tom Craig, after pulling himself out of the squirming heap of boys. \"It's against the rules to smother the referee to death. He has to be killed painlessly.\"  When the tangle had been straightened out Greg Holmes was found to be still doubled up, holding doggedly to the pigskin that had been his to guard.  \"Get ready for the next snap-back,\" ordered Captain Dick.  \"Don't do anything of the sort,\" countermanded Len. \"I can see that what you youngsters need more than play, just at present, is a working knowledge of the rules. So listen, and I'll introduce you to a few principles of the game.\"  After ten minutes of earnest talk Len Spencer allowed the ball to be put once more in play.  At one time it was discovered that Craig, reinforced by enthusiastic onlookers from the sidelines, had seventeen men in his team. Dick, on the other hand, kept an alert eye to see that no more than eleven ranged up with his team.  \"Now, that's enough for the first day,\" called out Len at last. \"Neither side won, but the Rangers had by far the better of it. Now, before you fellows play to-morrow I advise you all to do some earnest studying of the rules of the game.\"  \"Don't make too much fun of us in the 'Blade,' will you, Mr. Spencer?\" begged Dick. \"We really want to get a good Central Grammar eleven at work. We want to play the other Grammar Schools in town.\"  \"Oh, no one but a fool could find it in his heart to make fun of boys who display as much earnestness as you youngsters showed to-day,\" Spencer replied soothingly.  \"It's the first time we ever tried real play, you know,\" Dick went on.  \"Yes; and you'll have to do a lot more practising before you can convince any one that you are doing any real playing,\" Len nodded. \"Go after the rules. Memorize 'em. And watch the High School crowd play football. That will teach you a lot.\"  \"I know we need it,\" Dick sighed. \"But then, you see, Grammar School football is a brand-new thing.\"  \"Why, now I come to think of it, I don't believe I ever did hear before of a Grammar School eleven,\" Len Spencer admitted.  At least twenty other boys followed Dick and his chums from the field on the way home.  \"Say, Dick,\" called Tom Craig, \"is the Central Grammar team going to have a uniform?\"  \"Why, I suppose we must have one,\" Dick answered.  \"Where are we going to get the money?\"  Dick looked blank at that. A football uniform costs at least a few dollars, and who ever heard of an average Grammar School boy having a few dollars, all his own to spend?  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" muttered Prescott. \"Oh, well, we'll have to find some way of getting uniforms. We've got to have 'em. That's all there is to it.\"  \"'Where there's a will there's a way,'\" quoted Tom Reade blithely.  But most of the fellows shook their heads.  \"We can't get uniforms,\" declared several of the older eighth-grade boys.  \"Then, if we can't we'll have to play without uniforms,\" Dick maintained. \"We've got to play somehow. I hope you fellows won't go and lose your enthusiasm. Let's all hang together for football.\"  One by one the other boys dropped off, until only Dick and his five chums were left at a corner on Main Street.  \"I'm afraid a lot of the fellows will go and let their enthusiasm cool over night,\" declared Harry Hazelton.  \"Remember, fellows, we've got to have our football eleven, and we've got to keep at it until we can really play a good game,\" insisted Dick.  \"But what if most all the fellows drop out?\" demanded Dan Dalzell. \"You know, that's the trouble with Grammar School fellows. They don't stick.\"  \"There are six of us, and we'll all stick,\" proclaimed Dick. \"That means that we've got to get only five other fellows to stick. Surely we can do that, if we've got hustle enough in us to play football at all.\"  \"Oh, we'll have our eleven somehow,\" insisted Dave positively.  \"How about our uniforms?\" Tom Reade wanted to know.  \"We'll have them, too,\" asserted Dick. \"I don't know just how we'll do it, but we'll manage.\"  Dick Prescott and his chums were in much better spirits after that brief consultation. Then they separated, each going to his home for supper.  Dick's father and mother were proprietors of the most popular bookstore in Gridley. It stood on one of the side streets, just a little way down from Main Street. Over the store were the living rooms of the family. Dick was an only child.  After stowing away such an evening meal as only a healthy boy knows how to take care of, Dick reached for his cap.  \"I'm going out to meet the fellows, mother, if you don't mind,\" said young Prescott.  \"I'm sorry to say that there's just one matter that will delay you for perhaps twenty minutes,\" replied Mrs. Prescott. \"Mrs. Davis was in and ordered some books this afternoon. She wants them delivered this evening, so I said I'd send you around with them. That won't bother you much, will it?\"  \"Not so much but that I'll get over it,\" laughed the boy. \"Maybe I'll pick up one or two of the fellows, anyway.\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22307"],["title","The Grammar School Boys of Gridley; or, Dick & Co. Start Things Moving (#5)"],["body","Richard, I'd rather you'd deliver the books before you meet any of your friends,\" urged Mrs. Prescott. \"The books are worth about ten dollars, and if you have some of your friends along you may begin skylarking, and some of the books may get damaged.\"  \"All right, mother. I'll go alone.\"  Off Dick started with the bundle, whistling blithely. All his thoughts were centered on the forming of the Central Grammar eleven, and that plan now looked like a winner.  \"We won't let the High School fellows have all the fun,\" young Prescott mused as he hurried along.  He reached the rather large and handsome Davis house, rang the bell, delivered his books and then started back. His evening, up to nine o'clock, was now his own to do with as he pleased.  Suddenly the thought of the happenings at noon came back to his mind.  \"What a mean fellow that Dexter is!\" muttered the Grammar School boy. \"I've heard folks say that Dexter is mean enough, and scoundrel enough, to kill his wife one of these days. Whew! I should think it would hurt to be so all-fired mean, and to have everyone despising you, as folks seem to despise Dexter. I hope the upper court will give him six months in jail, instead of one.\"  Prescott was moving along a dark street now. It bordered a broad field, back of which stood a deep grove. At the street end of the field was a neat, solid, stone wall.  Had Dick been looking ahead all the time he would have seen a man, coming down the street, start, take a swift look at the boy, and then dart behind a tree. But Prescott did not see until he reached the tree. Then the man stepped out.  \"Prescott!\" uttered Abner Dexter hoarsely, \"I've been wanting to see you again!\"  \"That's more than I can say about you,\" retorted Dick, trying to edge away.  \"No! You don't get away from me like that!\" hissed Ab. Dexter sharply, twisting a hand on Dick's collar. Lifting the boy from his feet, Dexter hurled him over the wall into the field.  \"Now, I'm going to settle with you, young meddler!\" announced Dexter, vaulting the wall and throwing himself upon Dick. \"When I get through with you you'll never feel like meddling with any one again!\"     CHAPTER IV  AB. DEXTER'S TEMPER IS SQUALLY   \"You're taking a lot upon yourself!\" ventured Dick Prescott angrily.  \"That's all right,\" laughed Dexter savagely. \"Come along with me and I'll show you something really funny.\"  With that the man caught young Prescott up, starting across the field with him. Dick fought and struggled, but a grown man was too powerful for one thirteen-year-old boy.  \"Don't make any noise,\" warned Dexter, as he ran with his \"catch,\" \"or I'll make you wish you hadn't opened your mouth!\"  If he feared that Dick would call for help, this high-handed one was reckoning without a knowledge of the kind of boy he had to deal with. For Dick, though he was just a little more than slightly alarmed, would have been ashamed to call out for help.  \"You think you're having a lot of fun,\" sputtered young Prescott angrily, \"but you'll be sorry for this before you are through!\"  \"Through with whom?\" demanded Dexter blandly, now.  \"Before you're through with me. You'll find that you can't act like this around Gridley. Justice Lee will get hold of you again, first thing you know.\"  \"Huh! I'll talk to you about that in a few minutes!\"  \"See here, where are you taking me?\"  \"Wherever I please.\"  \"Then I don't know about that, either, Dexter. I've about made up my mind that I won't go any further with you.\"  \"Oh, you won't, eh, boy! Well, just help yourself, if you can.\"  By this time Dexter had crossed the field and had run well inside of the grove.  Dick wriggled, getting one hand free--and then he struck Dexter a stinging blow in the face.  \"Confound you!\" growled the other. \"I see that I've got to tame you, you young hornet!\"  \"You put me down, or I'll sting worse than a hornet,\" threatened Dick angrily. \"I'm not a doormat that you can wipe your feet on.\"  \"We'll see about that!\" muttered Dexter, halting suddenly and throwing Dick savagely to the ground. He followed this up by sitting on the Grammar School boy.  Whack! Whack! Dexter struck him so savagely, both blows in the face, that Prescott gasped.  \"I've got a few hundred more of those in reserve if you want 'em--or need 'em,\" Dick's captor advised him grimly. He still sat on the boy, looking down at him in the darkness with evil satisfaction.  \"It doesn't take one long to find your number, Dexter,\" observed the boy undauntedly. \"Your specialty is frightening women and pounding boys who offend you.\"  \"Well, a lot of you boys hammered me this noon, didn't you!\"  \"Yes; and I wish I had a couple of the fellows here now,\" retorted Dick with spirit. \"We'd soon make a coward like you seem small. You'd be on your knees, begging, if I had a couple of my chums here to help me.\"  \"Well, you haven't got 'em, and I'll do all the talking that amounts to anything. Dick Prescott, you're the worst and freshest boy in Gridley!\"  \"Such a statement, coming from a fellow like you, amounts to high praise, Dexter,\" Dick retorted doughtily.  \"None of your impudence, now, Dick Prescott! I've stood all the insolence from you that I'm going to allow.\"  \"My! How big the man talks to the small boy!\" taunted Dick. \"And he had to drag the boy away off here, so that there wouldn't be a chance of another boy coming along. A man of your caliber, Dexter, may be brave enough to face one boy, when he's angry enough, but you wouldn't dare say 'boo' if one of my boy friends were here to back me up.\"  \"I'll stop that sort of impudence right now,\" growled Dexter, stung more deeply by the taunts than he would have been willing to let the boy guess. \"I'm pretty savage in my mind against you, at any rate, and I may as well let some of it out!\"  Whack! smack! thump! Dexter began savagely to vent all of his bottled-up spite against young Prescott, striking him repeatedly, and with such force that the lad was soon aching all over.  Dick fought back as best he could, but, pinned down as he was, and in the grip of one three times as strong as himself, Dick could get in an effective blow only now and then. Such blows as he did land only served to fan Dexter's wrath to greater fury--and the boy suffered accordingly.  It would have been a brutal beating, under any circumstances, that Dick received. In his helpless condition it was doubly brutal.  \"Now, do you think you've got enough to hold you for a while?\" Ab. Dexter demanded, as he paused, panting.  \"I'm just thinking about the time when you'll get it all back with interest!\" snapped young Prescott.  \"Oh, then you haven't had enough--_yet_?\"  \"I had enough before you began.\"  \"But you haven't learned to keep a civil tongue in your head?\"  \"Dexter,\" retorted the lad, speaking more earnestly than he was aware, \"I try to keep not only a civil tongue, but a pleasant manner for every human being who tries to act decently. With you it's different. Before to-day I didn't know much about you. What little I did know wasn't to your credit. But now I know you to belong to nothing better than the scum of the earth. No human being with any self-respect could be decent with you!\"  \"You're getting worse than ever, are you?\" sneered Dexter. \"I see that my work is only half started.\"  With that Ab. Dexter threw himself upon the boy again, giving him an even more lively beating than before.  Dick Prescott, panting with his struggles, disdained to cry out, but saved all his strength to fight back.  At last, all but exhausted, Ab. Dexter paused.  \"You got a little better lesson that time,\" boasted the wretch.  \"And I got a small lunch while you were taking your dinner,\" retorted Prescott, no more daunted than before. \"Your nose is bleeding and your lip is cut!\"  \"Yes, I know it! I'm going to take that out of you presently.\"  \"Are you enjoying yourself, Dexter?\" asked the boy tauntingly.  \"Yes. And before I get through with you, I'm going to make sure that you'll never interfere in my affairs again.\"  \"Do you mean that you expect I'll stand off the next time that I see you trying to frighten your wife into supporting a lazy loafer in style?\" Dick asked dryly.  \"Hang you! You haven't learned your lesson yet, have you?\"  \"If you're trying to make me 'respect' you, Dexter, you've acted the wrong way all through to-day. You're entitled to no more respect than an Indian would show a rattlesnake.\"  Ab. Dexter's face was ablaze with wrath. He had expected to make this Grammar School boy beg for mercy before things had gone half as far as they had. Dick Prescott's undaunted pluck bewildered the mean bully.  \"I'll make you shut up, boy, before I'm through with you!\" he warned the lad.  \"There's just one way to do that, Dexter!\"  \"Eh?\"  \"You'll have to knock me out.\"  \"I'll do that, then!\"  It would be wrong to seek to give the reader an impression that young Prescott was not afraid, and did not mind his two thrashings. He was afraid that Dexter would go to great lengths, yet Dick would not give the bully satisfaction by admitting any fear.  \"What you've got to do, before I get through with you,\" Dexter announced, \"is to beg my pardon and to promise that you'll never again interfere with me.\"  \"You'll wait a long while, then,\" jeered Dick, \"and you'll get strong man's cramp in both arms!\"  \"And you've got to do more than promise that much,\" continued the bully. \"You've got to promise, solemnly, to help me in some plans that I have for the future.\"  \"Oh? Plans against your wife, I suppose.\"  \"Very likely,\" half admitted Dexter. \"Whatever the plans are, you're going to help me in them.\"  \"You're going about in a fine way, Dexter, to get my cheerful help.\"  \"Never mind about the cheerful part of it,\" snarled the man. \"You're going to help me, and I'm going to tame you.\"  \"Gracious! What a fine, large tail our cat is growing,\" laughed Dick, though his voice did not ring very mirthfully.  Dexter, still astride his young captive, raised his fist. Prescott did not"]]]
