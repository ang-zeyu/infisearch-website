There are in all, in the sky, 20 stars having an apparent magnitude brighter than 1m.5. The brightest of them is _Sirius_, which, owing to its brilliancy and position, is visible to the whole civilized world. It has a spectrum of the type A0 and hence a colour-index nearly equal to 0.0 (observations in Harvard give _c_ = +0.06). Its apparent magnitude is -1m.6, nearly the same as that of Mars in his opposition. Its absolute magnitude is -0m.3, _i.e._, fainter than the apparent magnitude, from which we may conclude that it has a distance from us smaller than one siriometer. We find, indeed, from the eighth column that _r_ = 0.5 sir. The proper motion of Sirius is 1″.32 per year, which is rather large but still not among the largest proper motions as will be seen below. From the 11th column we find that Sirius is moving towards us with a velocity of 1.6 sir./st. (= 7.6 km./sec.), a rather small velocity. The third column shows that its right ascension is 6h 40m and its declination -16°. It lies in the square GD_7 and its galactic coordinates are seen in the 5th and 6th columns.  The next brightest star is _Canopus_ or α Carinæ at the south sky. If we might place absolute confidence in the value of _M_ (= -8.2) in the 12th column this star would be, in reality, a much more imposing apparition than Sirius itself. Remembering that the apparent magnitude of the moon, according to §6, amounts to -11.6, we should find that Canopus, if placed at a distance from us equal to that of Sirius (_r_ = 0.5 sir.), would shine with a lustre equal to no less than a quarter of that of the moon. It is not altogether astonishing that a fanciful astronomer should have thought Canopus to be actually the central star in the whole stellar system. We find, however, from column 8 that its supposed distance is not less that 30 sir. We have already pointed out that distances greater than 4 sir., when computed from annual parallaxes, must generally be considered as rather uncertain. As the value of _M_ is intimately dependent on that of _r_ we must consider speculations based on this value to be very vague. Another reason for a doubt about a great value for the real luminosity of this star is found from its type of spectrum which, according to the last column, is F0, a type which, as will be seen, is seldom found among giant stars. A better support for a large distance could on the other hand be found from the small proper motion of this star. Sirius and Canopus are the only stars in the sky having a negative value of the apparent visual magnitude.  Space will not permit us to go through this list star for star. We may be satisfied with some general remarks.  In the fourth column is the galactic square. We call to mind that all these squares have the same area, and that there is therefore the same probability _a priori_ of finding a star in one of the squares as in another. The squares GC and GD lie along the galactic equator (the Milky Way). We find now from column 4 that of the 20 stars here considered there are no less than 15 in the galactic equator squares and only 5 outside, instead of 10 in the galactic squares and 10 outside, as would have been expected. The number of objects is, indeed, too small to allow us to draw any cosmological conclusions from this distribution, but we shall find in the following many similar instances regarding objects that are principally accumulated along the Milky Way and are scanty at the galactic poles. We shall find that in these cases we may _generally_ conclude from such a partition that we then have to do with objects _situated far from the sun_, while objects that are uniformly distributed on the sky lie relatively near us. It is easy to understand that this conclusion is a consequence of the supposition, confirmed by all star counts, that the stellar system extends much farther into space along the Milky Way than in the direction of its poles.  If we could permit ourselves to draw conclusions from the small material here under consideration, we should hence have reason to believe that the bright stars lie relatively far from us. In other words we should conclude that the bright stars seem to be bright to us not because of their proximity but because of their large intrinsic luminosity. Column 8 really tends in this direction. Certainly the distances are not in this case colossal, but they are nevertheless sufficient to show, in some degree, this uneven partition of the bright stars on the sky. The mean distance of these stars is as large as 7.5 sir. Only α Centauri, Sirius, Procyon and Altair lie at a distance smaller than one siriometer. Of the other stars there are two that lie as far as 30 siriometers from our system. These are the two giants Canopus and Rigel. Even if, as has already been said, the distances of these stars may be considered as rather uncertain, we must regard them as being rather large.  As column 8 shows that these stars are rather far from us, so we find from column 12, that their absolute luminosity is rather large. The mean absolute magnitude is, indeed, -2m.1. We shall find that only the greatest and most luminous stars in the stellar system have a negative value of the absolute magnitude.  The mean value of the proper motions of the bright stars amounts to 0″.56 per year and may be considered as rather great. We shall, indeed, find that the mean proper motion of the stars down to the 6th magnitude scarcely amounts to a tenth part of this value. On the other hand we find from the table that the high value of this mean is chiefly due to the influence of four of the stars which have a large proper motion, namely Sirius, Arcturus, α Centauri and Procyon. The other stars have a proper motion smaller than 1″ per year and for half the number of stars the proper motion amounts to approximately 0″.05, indicating their relatively great distance.  That the absolute velocity of these stars is, indeed, rather small may be found from column 10, giving their radial velocity, which in the mean amounts to only three siriometers per stellar year. From the discussion below of the radial velocities of the stars we shall find that this is a rather small figure. This fact is intimately bound up with the general law in statistical mechanics, to which we return later, that stars with large masses generally have a small velocity. We thus find in the radial velocities fresh evidence, independent of the distance, that these bright stars are giants among the stars in our stellar system.  We find all the principal spectral types represented among the bright stars. To the helium stars (B) belong Rigel, Achernar, β Centauri, Spica, Regulus and β Crucis. To the Sirius type (A) belong Sirius, Vega, Altair, Fomalhaut and Deneb. To the Calcium type (F) Canopus and Procyon. To the sun type (G) Capella and α Centauri. To the K-type belong Arcturus, Aldebaran and Pollux and to the M-type the two red stars Betelgeuze and Antares. Using the spectral indices as an expression for the spectral types we find that the mean spectral index of these stars is +1.1 corresponding to the spectral type F1.   31. _Stars with the greatest proper motion._ In table 3 I have collected the stars having a proper motion greater than 3″ per year. The designations are the same as in the preceding table, except that the names of the stars are here taken from different catalogues.  In the astronomical literature of the last century we find the star 1830 Groombridge designed as that which possesses the greatest known proper motion. It is now distanced by two other stars C. P. D. 5h.243 discovered in the year 1897 by KAPTEYN and INNES on the plates taken for the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung, and BARNARD's star in Ophiuchus, discovered 1916. The last-mentioned star, which possesses the greatest proper motion now known, is very faint, being only of the 10th magnitude, and lies at a distance of 0.40 sir. from our sun and is hence, as will be found from table 5 the third nearest star for which we know the distance. Its linear velocity is also very great, as we find from column 10, and amounts to 19 sir./st. (= 90 km./sec.) in the direction towards the sun. The absolute magnitude of this star is 11m.7 and it is, with the exception of one other, the very faintest star now known. Its spectral type is Mb, a fact worth fixing in our memory, as different reasons favour the belief that it is precisely the M-type that contains the very faintest stars. Its apparent velocity (_i.e._, the proper motion) is so great that the star in 1000 years moves 3°, or as much as 6 times the diameter of the moon. For this star, as well as for its nearest neighbours in the table, observations differing only by a year are sufficient for an approximate determination of the value of the proper motion, for which in other cases many tens of years are required.  Regarding the distribution of these stars in the sky we find that, unlike the brightest stars, they are not concentrated along the Milky Way. On the contrary we find only 6 in the galactic equator squares and 12 in the other squares. We shall not build up any conclusion on this irregularity in the distribution, but supported by the general thesis of the preceding paragraph we conclude only that these stars must be relatively near us. This follows, indeed, directly from column 8, as not less than eleven of these stars lie within one siriometer from our sun. Their mean distance is 0.87 sir.

For some of the stars (4) the radial velocity is for the present unknown, but the others have, with few exceptions, a rather great velocity amounting in the mean to 18 sir./st. (= 85 km./sec.), if no regard is taken to the sign, a value nearly five times as great as the absolute velocity of the sun. As this is only the component along the line of sight, the absolute velocity is still greater, approximately equal to the component velocity multiplied by √2. We conclude that the great proper motions depend partly on the proximity, partly on the great linear velocities of the stars. That both these attributes here really cooperate may be seen from the absolute magnitudes (_M_).  The apparent and the absolute magnitudes are for these stars nearly equal, the means for both been approximately 7m. This is a consequence of the fact that the mean distance of these stars is equal to one siriometer, at which distance _m_ and _M_, indeed, do coincide. We find that these stars have a small luminosity and may be considered as _dwarf_ stars. According to the general law of statistical mechanics already mentioned small bodies upon an average have a great absolute velocity, as we have, indeed, already found from the observed radial velocities of these stars.  As to the spectral type, the stars with great proper motions are all yellow or red stars. The mean spectral index is +2.8, corresponding to the type G8. If the stars of different types are put together we get the table      _Type_    _Number_       _Mean value of M_       G         8                 5.3       K         4                 7.5       M         4                 9.6  We conclude that, at least for these stars, the mean value of the absolute magnitude increases with the spectral index. This conclusion, however, is not generally valid.   32. _Stars with the greatest radial velocities._ There are some kinds of nebulae for which very large values of the radial velocities have been found. With these we shall not for the present deal, but shall confine ourselves to the stars. The greatest radial velocity hitherto found is possessed by the star (040822) of the eighth magnitude in the constellation Perseus, which retires from us with a velocity of 72 sir./st. or 341 km./sec. The nearest velocity is that of the star (010361) which approaches us with approximately the same velocity. The following table contains all stars with a radial velocity greater than 20 sir./st. (= 94.8 km./sec.). It is based on the catalogue of VOUTE mentioned above.  Regarding their distribution in the sky we find 11 in the galactic equator squares and 7 outside. A large radial velocity seems therefore to be a galactic phenomenon and to be correlated to a great distance from us. Of the 18 stars in consideration there is only one at a distance smaller than one siriometer and 2 at a distance smaller than 4 siriometers. Among the nearer ones we find the star (050744), identical with C. P. D. 5h.243, which was the “second” star with great proper motion. These stars have simultaneously the greatest proper motion and very great linear velocity. Generally we find from column 9 that these stars with large radial velocity possess also a large proper motion. The mean value of the proper motions amounts to 1″.34, a very high value.  In the table we find no star with great apparent luminosity. The brightest is the 10th star in the table which has the magnitude 5.1. The mean apparent magnitude is 7.7. As to the absolute magnitude (_M_) we see that most of these speedy stars, as well as the stars with great proper motions in table 3, have a rather great _positive_ magnitude and thus are absolutely faint stars, though they perhaps may not be directly considered as dwarf stars. Their mean absolute magnitude is +3.0.  Regarding the spectrum we find that these stars generally belong to the yellow or red types (G, K, M), but there are 6 F-stars and, curiously enough, two A-stars. After the designation of their type (A2 and A3) is the letter _p_ (= peculiar), indicating that the spectrum in some respect differs from the usual appearance of the spectrum of this type. In the present case the peculiarity consists in the fact that a line of the wave-length 448.1, which emanates from magnesium and which we may find on plate III in the spectrum of Sirius, does not occur in the spectrum of these stars, though the spectrum has otherwise the same appearance as in the case of the Sirius stars. There is reason to suppose that the absence of this line indicates a low power of radiation (low temperature) in these stars (compare ADAMS).
