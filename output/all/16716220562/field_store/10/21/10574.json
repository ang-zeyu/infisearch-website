Well, Mrs. Cricket wears at the end of her body a long spear. See this cricket of Peter's. Now she bores her hole with this spear and then guides her eggs carefully into the hole. Why, see here, Pete, what have you got here?\"  The children gazed eagerly over the old man's shoulder.  \"My, isn't it like velvet!\" exclaimed Peter.  \"And isn't it brown!\" added Hope.  \"But look at its stumpy front legs!\" called Jack, who had forgotten his empty stomach in the excitement about this little creature, which looked like a cricket and yet was so different.  \"And its little beads of eyes!\" said Betty.  \"Do you know what it is?\" No one knew. \"Well, it's a mole cricket. You rarely ever see one because they live underground and bore their way along just like moles, leaving tiny tracks and nibbling the roots of tender plants. You see, it doesn't need eyes any more than the mole does. But it does need those thickened fore legs to do its underground digging. Now, children, run out into the fields and let your crickets go. Be careful not to hurt them. We'll have supper, and after supper we'll catch a katydid.\"  Out ran the children. Soon they were setting the long wooden tables under the trees with delicious trout the boys had caught, with hot biscuits and jugs of maple syrup, with berries and cookies, with milk from the old cow, who, contentedly chewing her cud, was looking at them through the low crotch of a tree, and with little cakes of maple sugar which the guide had moulded into the shape of hearts.     V  HOW KATY DID   Never did trout, cookies, and maple sugar disappear so quickly; never were such appetites; never such laughing, and such interesting stories told by the guide.  \"Hush!\" said Ben Gile. \"Do you hear that?\"  \"Yes,\" cried Peter.  \"What is it?\"  \"It's a katydid,\" said Betty, \"over there.\"  \"Listen, children, what does it say?\"  \"It says, 'Chic-a-chee, chic-a-chee,' over and over again,\" answered Jack.  \"Pooh,\" interrupted Jimmie, \"it says, 'Katy did, Katy didn't!'\"  \"It says, 'Katy broke a china plate; yes, she did; no, she didn't,'\" called Betty.  \"Yes, she did; no, she didn't!\" the children shouted, merrily, together.  \"Well,\" said the old man, \"anyway, it's all about what Katy did do and what Katy didn't do. Probably Mr. Katy, like other good husbands in the world, is singing of the wonderful things Katy did do and the naughty things she didn't do. That is Mr. Katy's love-song. Ah, he finds Mrs. Katy very charming--her beautiful wings, her gracefully waving antennæ, her knowing, shining eyes! Now, listen again. Katydid carries its musical instrument at the base of its wing cover. On each side is a tiny membrane and a strong vein. When the wing covers are rubbed together the membrane speaks, and you hear--\"  \"Katy did, Katy didn't!\" shouted the children.  \"Do you think you know where they are? Well, take these lanterns\"--the guide had lighted half a dozen--\"and find them.\"  The children scurried off, certain of a quick victory. In the woods about the cabin you could hear them shouting: \"It's here!\" \"No, it isn't!\" \"Where is it?\"  \"A will-o'-the-wisp,\" murmured the old man; \"may they never have a harder one to find!\"  By-and-by the children came trotting back. They couldn't find the katydid in any place, and they had looked everywhere.  [Illustration: _A._ Eggs of the katydid. _B._ A katydid. _C._ Leg, showing katydid's ear. _D._ Musical instrument at base of wings.]  \"Couldn't? How did you look?\" He took one of the lanterns, went to a near-by tree, and held the lantern close to the leaves. \"Here it is! Why, it's a great fellow!\"  The children trooped into the cabin after him, crowding to look at the katydid.  \"I thought they were brown,\" said Hope.  \"So did I,\" echoed Betty.  \"See, you can't tell this fellow from the leaf, it is such a bright, fresh green. Woe to the katydid if it were anything but this bright green! Just think how easily the birds would find them. What nice salad Katy would make for a young robin!\"  \"Do the birds eat katydids?\" asked the children, in surprise.  \"Oh yes, and they haven't any stated luncheon or supper time for doing it. They are very informal. One time is as good as another, and the oftener the merrier. If Katy doesn't keep very quiet and demure, like her leafy background, whist! and Father Robin or Mother Bluebird has a meal for the youngsters.\"  \"Is that why it doesn't sing by day?\" asked Peter.  \"They wait till the birds go to bed, I suppose. See what a comical look this fellow has, waving its long, fine, silky antennæ about. Probably it's trying to find out what it is on, looking out for another nice green leaf to eat. They do a lot of damage eating leaves from the trees.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Betty, pointing to the edge of a leaf.  \"Well, you have sharp eyes,\" said the old man. \"Mrs. Katydid has laid her eggs there. See, the eggs are rounded and flattened, and each egg laps a little over the one in front of it. Once another man saw a row of katydid eggs laid as neatly as could be on the edge of a clean linen collar. I'll keep these eggs; then, in the spring, the young ones will hatch out. They will grow and shed their skins from time to time, just the way the locusts do. Ah, they leave so many old clothes about that they need an old clothes man! I wish I could tell you about the katydid I knew once upon a time who spent her days collecting old clothes, and how she made a fortune selling them to--\"  Ben Gile paused and sighed deeply.  \"Selling them to what?\" shouted the children.  \"I can't tell that to you,\" replied the old man, shaking his head sadly. \"It's the story of 'How Katy Did.' I have to be very careful, for Mr. John Burroughs, who is a wiser old man than I am, says I mustn't. Lately the scientists almost killed one man I know, and a good, clever, useful man, for telling that story--very savage, very savage.\"  The children began to look troubled. \"Will Mr. Burroughs hurt us?\" inquired Hope. \"My papa would--\"  \"No, no, child, you're too small. He likes something big, and he's especially fond of the Big Stick.\"  \"Is that what he does his beating with?\" Jack's eyes were frightened.  \"He hunts with the Big Stick,\" answered the guide. \"Dear me, where are we? It's half-past eight, and you children should have been in bed this time long, long ago. Hurry! Skip! Get the lanterns or we'll all be scolded.\"  And they scampered for the village, the guide driving them before him, and all the lights waving to and fro like so many crazy fireflies.     VI  FISHING   Have you ever started off on a bright, cool morning to fish? At the last it seems as if you would never get started, which, I suppose, is partly the eagerness to be gone; then you do get off, only to find you've forgot the can of worms or the salt for the luncheon-basket.  Jimmie and Betty were prancing on the lawn in front of Turtle Lodge. Jimmie had his camera over his back and a jointed steel rod done up in a neat little case in his hands, on his feet long rubber boots. Betty wore a big straw hat; she carried a little rod like Jim's and a pretty little knapsack, which held part of the luncheon. They were waiting for Jack and Ben Gile, who were to go with them to fish a stream that lay far back from the pond. It was to be a great day's sport. They had a creel and a rod for Jack; for the guide they needed to take nothing, for he had the most wonderful collection of rods and flies they had ever seen.  At last they saw him coming up the hill, Jack with him. Hastily they kissed Mrs. Reece, and ran shouting and jumping toward the old man and the boy, Lizzie after them, for they had left half the luncheon on the grass. \"Faith!\" she panted, catching up with them, \"and what can you be doing without the victuals, I'd like to know?\"  The guide took part of the bundles and Jack the rest. Off they went gayly talking and laughing.  Soon they were following the stream, Jack catching his line and fly in the alders almost every time he cast.  Jack was too poor ever to have had any rod except an alder stick cut beside the stream, a short line and hook, and any worm or grasshopper he might find. He was wonderfully proud of the rod he held. The children meant to give it to him at the end of the summer. But Jack did not know this good news yet.  Ben Gile led the way, and almost every time he cast his fly there was a swirl, the end of the slender rod bent, there was a minute of excitement, and then upon the bank lay a beautiful speckled trout. On, on, on they went over the cool, green leaves and bright red berries of the partridge vine, and past raspberries wherever the sun had struck in through the heavy trees to ripen them. The stream was running more and more swiftly as they travelled up grade; quick water was growing more frequent and the pools deeper.  At last they came to a deep, round pool, and the guide said, \"Now, Jim, you've the first try.\"  Jimmie cast his fly, there was a strike, a plunge, and out, out, out ran Jimmie's line. The boy's face turned quite pale. \"What shall I do, sir?\"  \"You have a big one,\" answered Ben, calmly. \"If you can play him long enough we may get him; otherwise he'll get your fly and line. Steady there, steady; let out a little more line, and now reel in a bit.\"  It seemed like hours to Jimmie as he let the line out and reeled it in again. Really, it was only a few minutes before the guide said: \"Seems to be getting a little tired; bring him in closer. That's it. There!\"  They had no landing-net with them, so at the last moment Ben Gile seized the line, and out came a two-pound trout. Jimmie's eyes were popping nearly out of his head, and Betty was jumping about and clapping her hands.  [Illustration: _A._ Front view of dragon-fly nymph. _B._ Top view of damsel-fly nymph. _C._ Adult dragon-fly.]  \"Tired?\" asked the old man.  \"Some,\" said the boy.  \"Well, this is the best place we shall find to eat our luncheon. We'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],["title","Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#5)"],["body","camp here. Now for the fire! Boys, get the wood and a small strip of birch bark! Then these two stones will hold the frying-pan. Now for the fish; we'll keep that big one of yours and I'll mount it for you, if you'd like me to. We'll eat the little fellows. After luncheon we must catch more for your mother, Betty, and for Jack to take home with him.\"  Soon the frying-pan was hot, and the trout were sizzling and curling up with the bacon in the pan. Never did a luncheon taste so good as that, with fried trout and bacon, and hard-boiled eggs, soda biscuits, and a mammoth apple pie. They listened to the fire crackling; they looked up into the shining trees; they watched the water beyond the pool go tumbling downhill.  Finally the old man said, \"It's going to be a clear day to-morrow.\"  The children gazed up into the sky.  At this Ben Gile laughed. \"Don't look at the sky, look at your plates.\"  Puzzled by this, the children did look at their plates.  \"But there's nothing left to look at,\" said Jack.  \"That's just it. There's an old saying that people who eat all their food make a clear day for the morrow. Now,\" he continued, \"I'll smoke my pipe of peace before we go on. Just look at that fellow darting about over the pool!\"  \"Oh!\" cried Betty, \"it's a darning-needle, and it will sew up my mouth and my eyes--oh, oh!\"  \"Nonsense, child, that's silly. The dragon-fly is a very useful and a very harmless fellow. It's a pity that there are so many superstitions about it.\"  \"There's another name for it,\" said Jack--\"devil's darning-needle.\"  \"And in the South the darkies call it the mule-killer, and believe it has power to bring snakes to life. It's all nonsense. They are not only harmless to human beings but also very useful, for they eat flies and mosquitoes at a great rate. Once upon a time I fed a dragon-fly forty house flies in two hours. And they eat beetles and spiders and centipedes. And sometimes they eat one another.\"  \"Like the crickets?\" said Betty.  \"Yes, like the crickets. Just see that fellow dart about. The sharpest sort of angles. There, it has something! It caught that lace-wing in its leg-basket.\"  \"Leg-basket!\" exclaimed the children.  \"Yes; it draws its six legs together, and makes a sort of basket right under its head. Then the dragon-fly devours what it catches by these strong-toothed jaws. It is a hungry fellow, it is.\"  The old man puffed away quietly for a few minutes, while the children watched the darning-needle and hoped Ben Gile would say something soon.  \"Those scientists,\" he continued, \"who are working on flying-machines could learn a good deal from this fellow. The dragon-fly is made for flight. A long, slender, tapering body that cuts the air, moved by four narrow, gauzy wings, and steered by that pointed abdomen. They eat, mate, and lay their eggs while they are flying. I don't know that they are still for more than a few seconds.\"  \"Can you find their eggs?\" asked Betty.  \"Yes; their eggs are laid in the water or fastened to the stems of water plants. See that damsel fly, the slender, smaller, pretty-colored darning-needle? Well, it goes entirely under water, cuts a slit in the stem with the sharp end of the abdomen, and lays the eggs in the groove it has made. And they lay thousands of eggs.\"  \"When they hatch out, what do they look like?\" asked Jack, who grew daily more interested in the creatures about him, and who, in the years to come, was destined to be a great scientist.  \"It looks a little like the mother,\" said Ben Gile, taking out his pipe, \"but not much. It goes through a great many changes before it is really grown up. All told, the growth takes from a few months to a whole year. The young one, called a nymph, is an ugly little fellow, dingy black with six sprawling legs, two staring eyes, and a big lower lip which covers up its cruel face like a mask. It is a true ogre, lurking under stones and in rubbish at the bottom of the pond seeking whom it may devour. It eats the smaller and weaker nymphs.\"  \"Oh,\" said Betty, studying the picture the guide had drawn, \"what an ugly, ugly fellow!\"  \"It changes its skin a good many times, and sometimes it looks a little better while the skin is still clean and light gray. But it soon turns dingy again. See these three little leaf-shaped gills I've drawn?\"  \"They are like the screw on a steamer,\" commented Jimmie.  \"They are, a little. Well, this chap uses these gills for the same purpose as the steamer uses its screw--to scull through the water.\"  \"What happens when it changes?\" asked Jack.  \"After the nymph has its full growth, some sunny morning soon after daylight, it makes its way up out of the water on to a stem and waits quietly for the old dark skin to split. Then out crawls a soft-skinned creature with gauzy wings. But the body is so moist and weak it has to wait awhile for the warm sunshine to harden the skin and strengthen the muscle. When this is done the new dragon-fly, with its glistening body, flies out from the pond in the bright, warm light.\"  \"Then does it live forever?\" asked Betty.  \"No; it dies after twenty-five to forty-five days of its flight. Here, Jack, catch that fellow!\"  There was a wild scramble, but every time Jack just missed the dragon-fly. Finally Betty lent him her broad hat, and at last Jack caught the insect.  \"Gee! aren't its eyes big?\"  \"And beautiful, too,\" said the guide. \"They are made up of thousands of facets (a facet is just a small, plain surface) as many as thirty thousand facets in one eye. Some look up, some look down, some look out, some look in; so that there is nothing that escapes the sight of this hawk of the air. Look at the wings on this fellow, and look at the picture I drew for you of the nymph. Well, this fellow's wings begin in the nymph as tiny sacs, or pads, made by the pushing out of the wall of the body. Running all through between the two layers of the wing are thickened lines of chitin, which divide and subdivide, forming this fine network. In the new wing, protected by these thickenings, are air-tubes, which divide and branch into all parts of the wing. But as the wing reaches its full growth most of the air-tubes die.\" The guide paused. \"We are talking too much and fishing too little. Time to go on. Put out the fire, boys. Be sure that it's out. Run water all around it. Now we're off!\" And up, up, up the brook they went.     VII  THE SWIMMING-POOL   Two or three days after the fishing expedition the boys had gathered together at the swimming-pool, Ben Gile with them. They had been racing, and climbing trees, and were very warm. \"Come, boys,\" said the guide, \"let's sit down a minute before you go into the water. It won't do to bathe when you're too warm. Look round on the stones under the water and see what you can find.\"  \"Look at this,\" called Peter; \"it's just like a sponge.\"  \"It is a fresh-water sponge.\"  \"I didn't suppose sponges grew in these parts at all,\" said Jimmie.  \"Oh yes, there are many of them in the ponds.\"  \"See this, sir,\" shouted Jack; \"what funny little legs it has!\"  \"That's a May-fly or shad-fly nymph. He was hiding carefully under that stone and keeping out of the way of the dragon-fly nymph, who would so gladly gobble him up.\"  \"It's prettier,\" said Jimmie, \"than that dragon-fly nymph you drew a picture of.\"  \"So it is. See, here on each side of its body are these fine little gill-plates, moving, moving, moving, so that they may get as much fresh air as possible out of the water. Each gill-plate is a tiny sac, and within these are the fine branches of the air-tubes. It's wonderful the way these creatures breathe.\"  \"Don't they breathe just the way we do?\" asked Jack.  \"No; throughout the body of an insect is a system of tiny white tubes. Some day we'll look at these tubes under the microscope, and you will see that they are made up of rings. From end to end of the tube is a fine thread of chitin twisted in a close spiral like a spring. It is these little coils which look like rings. The coiled thread holds the little tube open so that the air may pass readily. But your little fellow, Jack, cannot have pores on the sides of the body like the last nymph. It lives under water, and the water would get into its tubes; instead, it has tracheal gills.\"  [Illustration: _A._ May-fly. _B._ Nymph of May-fly.]  \"That's a pretty big word,\" said Peter, looking up at the guide. He was growing impatient, and wished to begin the swim. If he had known what that swim was to mean to him, probably he would not have been so anxious.  \"They aren't so hard to understand; they are just little oval sacs, inside of which is a limb of the air tube divided into tiny branches. The fresh air in the water passes through the thin wall of the gill and is taken by the air-tubes to all parts of the body, while the impure air passes out in the water. This is all that breathing means in any creature--a changing of impure for pure air.\"  \"Then that is what my nymph is doing,\" asked Jack, \"when it wiggles its gills so?\"  \"Just that. Your May-fly nymph, Jack, hatched from a tiny egg first. But it grows rapidly, and splits and sheds its skin sometimes as often as twenty times. During the last few months wings appear, which grow a little larger with each shedding of the skin. Finally, after three years--sometimes three years spent in growing and hiding away from its enemies--the little nymph floats up to the surface of the water. In a few minutes the old skin splits along the back, and from it flies forth a frail little May-fly. Its body is very soft and delicate. Its four wings are of a gauzy texture. At the tip of the body are two long, fine hairs. Its jaws are small and weak, but the life of this little creature is so short that it never eats. Up it flies into the air with thousands of its brothers and sisters, whirls in a mad dance for a few hours, then falls exhausted to the ground to die.  \"Well, now I think we'd better go into the water,\" ended the guide. \"You boys can go in"]]]
