His mother's bad.\"  Doctor Palmer's sternness and severity vanished in a moment.  So it was always with him.  Strict as he was, severe as he was, directly the punishment had been duly administered, he was kind-hearted and genial to the culprit long before _he_ had recovered the effects of his punishment.  \"Campbell, your mother is ill.\"  He knew nothing more than that Mrs Campbell was a confirmed invalid.  \"Go and get your cap; I will come with you.  Perhaps I can be of some use.\"  But Harry's heart was too stricken to accept those well-meant words; and the sudden change in the Doctor made Harry say what at another time he would never have dared to say.  \"No,\" he sobbed.  \"I'll go alone.  She doesn't want you.  She believes me, and you don't.  She won't speak to _you_.\"  And he rushed from the room, leaving the doctor far too affected and moved to attempt to stop him or call him back.     CHAPTER X.  SUNLIGHT.  Ministering friends--Watching--Past all tears--Taken home--The dark valley.   The summer sunlight lay thick about the room where Mrs Campbell was dying.  There was a square of deep blue sky, edged by the window frame, glistening before her eyes--eyes that now were lighted up with the fervour of a holy death--eyes that glowed in sweet anticipation of that pure light which shines forever on the hills of heaven.  The silence of the room was only broken now and then by the few soothing words the doctor's wife would say or read.  Mrs Valentine sat on the farther side of the bed, her eyes red with weeping; and, from time to time, tried to get some nourishment into the poor weak lips, though she knew well the while that all these tender ministerings were in vain.  It was a lonely death for the dying one, even though she had these two good friends with her.  He who had loved, and loved her still, so well, could not be there to hear her last words on earth. She must lay her head in other arms than his, and give up her soul to God, without a farewell word from him, without one prayer together uttered, that God would hasten the time of their meeting in that land where partings are unknown.  No!  She must die without the presence of her nearest, dearest one on earth, while he was beating out upon the great waters of the ocean.  In the morning after Harry had started for school, Mrs Campbell, in a violent fit of coughing, had broken a blood-vessel.  In her present state this meant speedy and certain death.  And Dr Bromley, when he returned home, after having seen her, had told his wife that Mrs Campbell could not last more than two or three hours.  So, sending at once to the Grammar-School to request Doctor Palmer to allow Harry to go home immediately, the tender-hearted Mrs Bromley started for the farm.  And there she sat reading and speaking words of comfort to the dying wife, watching and fearing each moment would be the last.  She was Mrs Campbell's only friend save Mrs Valentine.  It is true the vicar had been to visit her several times, but under such painful circumstances the absence of one so near and dear as her husband made her almost inconsolable.  Her parents had both been dead some years, and she was their only child.  And as it often happens, while so many people have relations in numbers almost too abundant, she had none.  Her only great friends were in Malta, friends whom she had known in the dear old days, when all seemed so bright and hopeful before her.  It was therefore but natural that she should cling to the doctor's good wife; and thus their friendship, born as it was of a time of sorrow and suffering, was one of pure and holy comfort to them both.  And the morning crept on, with words of heaven softly uttered by the living, and drunk in with eager ears by the dying; and outside the birds sang, and the green trees whispered, stretching out their tiny leaf-hands to the caressant breezes, and all was summery there without,--all was sunshine and gladness.  And through the heedless village ran Harry, heart-broken and afraid, and entered, from the brightness, his mother's peaceful room of death.  He was past all crying now.  The tears seemed dried up in one great burning spot within his brain.  He stood quietly by the bed, longing to hear that well-known voice, but not daring to speak; she lay so still he scarcely knew whether she were alive or really dead.  \"Here is Harry, dear Mrs Campbell,\" said the doctor's wife; \"he has come from school.  Don't you know him?  Here he is.\"  She turned her large grey eyes upon her boy for some time without recognising him.  Then, at last, opening her arms, said:  \"Harry, darling, is that you?  I'm going away now--going to heaven. You'll always be a good boy, won't you?\"  \"Mamma, mamma, you _do_ believe I'm innocent, don't you?\" said Harry. He could not let her die without hearing once more from own lips her trustful confidence in him.  \"Yes, darling boy, I know you have spoken the truth.  Kiss me now,\" she whispered, her voice growing weaker.  \"Good-bye, darling Harry; God bless you!  Good-bye, dear Mrs Bromley.  Good-bye, Mrs Valentine.  God will reward you!\"  And then her voice was hardly audible as she murmured to herself, \"Buried at Wilton, and Alan will come and see my grave.  Alan, darling Alan, God is taking me home.\"  And then as a heavenly light shone through her eyes, her voice regained its strength. \"Into thy hand, O Lord I commend my spirit!\" and so she died.  Harry's face was pressed close to hers, and his burning tears now fell thick upon the lifeless cheek.  \"Oh! mamma, mamma,\" he sobbed, \"what shall I do? what shall I do?\"  And, sinking on the floor, he wept as though his heart would break. Mrs Bromley and the farmer's wife were too much wrapt in their own grief to stir to comfort him.  So the three wept there together, in the quiet little farm beside old Wilton church; while she, for whom they wept, now henceforth knew no more sorrow, no more pain, nor any tears; and still outside the birds sang on unwitting, and, from without, the summer brightness mocked the darkness that was within--the darkness of the valley of the shadow of death.     CHAPTER XI.  MOVING HOME.  School again--Leaving the farm--Like father, like son--Tea for two--The doctor retires--Miss Parker's oration.   Clouds and sunshine, sunshine and clouds.  So runs the world away. Equally necessary, sorrow and gladness are as the rains and sunbeams for the fruits of the earth.  Were it all sadness the world would grow morose and torpid; were it all gladness men would be selfish and hard-hearted.  Four days had now elapsed since Mrs Campbell died; and it was the evening of the funeral-day, a sad, rainy evening, and Harry was waiting while Mrs Valentine packed his things, for that night he was to go to the Grammar-School to sleep; to be there as a boarder, at any rate till his father returned.  He scarcely spoke a word, and what he did say seemed to choke him.  His mother dead; his father away at sea; himself sent back to the school he had left but a few days since, smarting with the pain of his undeserved punishment and accusation; his plight was indeed a sad one.  Mrs Valentine tried to cheer him as well as she might, but she felt the blow that left Harry motherless too bitterly herself to be of much comfort to him.  At half-past seven William appeared with a light cart of Dr Palmer's, to take Harry and his luggage to school.  Perhaps the bluntness of the old butler was more opportune now than ever.  It prevented the lengthening of a parting that could not be otherwise than utterly sad and wretched to Harry.  There was the good kind Mrs Valentine to leave; and the dear old farm, where he had spent so many joyous days in happy ignorance of the blow which now had stricken him.  And there was the churchyard to say good-bye to, which now he could see but seldom, and when he was near her grave, his mother did not seem to him to be so far away.  But William was not unkindly blunt.  Yet the sight of him brought back to Harry's mind the recollection of all that had occurred at school on the last occasion he had seen William's obese person.  The crib found in his desk, the fight, the caning, and then--then, back came the recollection that he was indeed alone.  \"Good-bye, my dear, good-bye,\" said Mrs Valentine; \"be sure you come and see me when you can.  Papa'll be home soon, maybe,\" though she feared she was but holding out false hopes in this.  \"There, that'll do, missis,\" said William, interrupting the moist embraces of the good farmer's wife; and he flicked the fat pony across his sleek shoulder; and, with Harry and his boxes, was soon away down the lane, Mrs Valentine gazing after them, her long print apron at her eyes.  \"Just like his father, dear boy, as brave and composed like.  But 'tis harder a'most for all that.\"  And who would say that her moralising was wrong?  As a special favour, and \"in consideration of his late deplorable affliction,\" as Miss Parker, the matron, phrased it, Harry was to have his tea in Doctor Palmer's study that night, a favour Harry by no means saw in the light intended.  He would far rather have had his tea with the rest; though, for the matter of that, he didn't want any tea at all.  He was too miserable to eat.  But his face was quiet and composed when he reached Doctor Palmer's hall, and was ushered into the study.  The tea was all ready,--two cups, two saucers, two plates,--so Harry was prepared for a _tête-à-tête_ with the Doctor.  Everything looked very nice and tempting, at least, it would have looked so on any other occasion; but now there was that numerical horror staring him in the face; those two cups, those two saucers, those two plates!  It must be for Doctor Palmer and himself that all the preparations were made.  But he was not left long in doubt, for, at that moment, the Doctor entered. He greeted Harry most kindly, and told him to take a seat at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22183"],["title","Wilton School; or, Harry Campbell's Revenge (#6)"],["body","ble, which Harry did in silence; and then the Doctor poured out a cup of tea for him, and helped him to some cold meat.  Harry watching every motion the while; and then, taking a cup for himself, drank it standing.  Harry hated all this kindness.  He would almost have preferred angry words; but he ate what he had, and enjoyed it, though he said nothing more than \"yes,\" or \"no, thank you,\" or \"please,\" to the Doctor's various remarks.  It was becoming unbearable, and he longed for the distant etiquette which school-life sets between boys and masters.  He was in no mood for a master to try to play the parent, especially when now the contrast seemed so great, and lying, as he was, under false imputations.  But he was soon relieved, for Doctor Palmer said:  \"I have to go out now, Campbell.  Don't hurry over your tea, but when you have quite finished you can go to bed.  You need not wait up for prayers.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" answered Harry, brighter for the first time.  Relief was come at last, and the study-door closing over the Doctor's portly form was the welcomest sight Harry had seen for many days.  Once alone, he lingered over his tea.  He knew he wouldn't be interrupted, and the contents of the table seemed doubly good now.  He even looked at some books, and at last became so absorbed in one, that he went on reading, regardless of time, till he heard the boarders' prayer-bell ringing, at the sound of which he hurried off to bed.  On the stairs he met the matron.  \"Oh, Master Campbell, I was looking for you.  You're changed into No. 7 dormitory.  I put your box by your bed, so you'll know where you're to sleep.  How are you now, dear,\" she added, kindly, \"have you heard from your papa? when's he coming home?  You'll try and be a good boy, won't you?  You must think how it would vex your dear ma; and you won't give Doctor Palmer cause to cane you again, I know,\" and Miss Parker smoothed her apron, and took breath after her long-winded oration.  There it was at last.  Harry feared it would come sooner or later, this allusion to the crib.  He burst out indignantly,--  \"Mamma believed me, Miss Parker, if nobody else did.  She knew I didn't crib; but I won't bear it, I won't,\" he cried passionately, as he ran up-stairs to his new destination.     CHAPTER XII.  BULLYING.  \"Gas out.\"--The new boy's turn--\"To err is human\"--Resistance--Persecution--I'll run away.   \"Well, there now,\" ejaculated Miss Parker, \"I never!  That boy's not a bit brought down by his mother's death.  He sticks to it, just as indignant as ever.\"  But Harry was out of hearing, and was sitting on his bed, staring into his box which he had just opened.  Presently, there was a sound of footsteps scurrying up-stairs and along the passages, and the door of No. 7 dormitory burst open, and its sixteen boys rushed in one after another, huddling together like a flock of sheep.  The first thing that met their eyes was Harry, who didn't quite know whether they would speak to him or not.  So he waited till one or two greeted him with a shake of the hand, and a \"how-de-do, Campbell?\" two or three more with a cold \"hallo, Campbell!\" and the rest with only a stare.  Amongst the latter were Egerton and Warburton.  In about five minutes a step was heard on the landing-place below.  \"Gas out,\" cried Egerton, \"there's Lea coming.\"  \"Lea\" was a house-master.  No one moved to obey the order.  \"Now, then,\" cried Warburton, \"who's new boy?\"  Harry, where he knelt at his bedside saying his prayers, knew he was meant; but he had not jumped up from his knees to obey the order, when a slipper came hard at him.  He, however, first put out the gas, and was on his knees again, finishing his prayers, when Mr Lea entered.  All being quiet, and the light out, he retired.  As soon as his last step was heard below, one or two voices exclaimed--  \"I say, Jackson, go on with your story, where you left off last night.\"  \"Oh, no,\" answered Jackson, the boy appealed to, \"I ain't new boy now. I've done my turn.\"  The majority of the boys did not quite like to tell Harry plainly it was his turn to provide the usual nightly amusement of a story, for they felt some sort of compunction towards him, because of his mother's death, even though they had not spoken to him; but they did not hesitate to talk pointedly about its being the new boy's turn; that Jackson had done his turn; _he_ was the last new boy, and so on.  But as Harry took no notice of these remarks, Egerton solved the difficulty by saying curtly,--  \"Campbell, it's your turn to tell a story, so look sharp, and begin.\"  \"I haven't got one to tell,\" answered Harry, as he sat, still undressed, on his bed, unlacing his boots.  \"Can't help that,\" said Egerton, \"you must make up one.  You're a good hand at that, aren't you?\" he sneered, brutally.  Those few words clenched the feeling of hatred that had been gradually growing in Harry's breast towards Egerton.  Then first sprang up within him a great desire of revenge, which in after years increased with Harry's growth--of revenge on one who had thus blasted his reputation, it seemed for ever.  It is true, he had but shortly risen from his knees.  But do not call his prayers hypocritical, because these angry, revengeful thoughts had taken such root in him so soon.  If we had not these passions we should be divine.  The only strange thing is, he was so young; for \"vengeance\" is usually only the cry of those of mature age.  But a consideration of the circumstances in which he was placed, and the advanced temperament of his mind, will make the wonder vanish.  Harry took no notice of Egerton's speech as far as an answer was concerned.  He went on unlacing his boots in silence; but he felt his face burn white with anger.  \"Now then, Campbell,\" cried Egerton, \"none of your sulks; it won't do. Are you going to tell a story or not?\"  \"No,\" answered Harry, bluntly and firmly.  \"But it's your turn, Campbell,\" expostulated some of the others, wanting the story, but yet not wanting a row.  \"I'd have tried to, if Egerton hadn't said that,\" answered Harry to the last speakers, whose tone seemed somewhat consolatory to him.  \"Hadn't said what?\" they asked.  \"Why, said that I knew how to tell stories.  You know what he meant, and it's beastly bullying, it is,\" went on Harry, impetuously and indignantly, \"and he knows he's the liar, and not me,\" waxing bold from the apparent sympathy the silence of the room seemed to augur.  But in that silence the anger of Egerton, and of a number of his special friends, was gathering; and the words were scarcely out of Harry's mouth, when a boot came through the darkness, hitting him on the shoulder, and then another, and another.  Harry sat on his bed, boiling with rage.  He did not feel in the mood for fighting, and besides, in the dark it was impossible.  Then came another ominous silence; and suddenly a scuffle of feet sounded near his bed, and before he knew where he was, his bed was suddenly dragged out into the middle of the room, turned over, and clothes, boots, sponges, wet towels, and pillows heaped upon him.  Harry was maddened: he longed to find some one to hit, but the darkness prevented that.  He heard suppressed voices laughing at him, but could see not a sign of any one; the bedclothes entangled his movements; he was wet with the sponges and bruised from the boots.  What could he do? Where could he find help?  \"Not at school, not at school,\" he said to himself.  \"If I tell, I shan't be believed;\" and then the idea came across him--\"I'll run away.\"  The thought was no sooner in his head, than his mind was firmly resolved.  Yes, he would run away from this horrid place; anywhere, anywhere, rather than stay here.     CHAPTER XIII.  FLIGHT.  In the passage--Past the last door--Somebody coming--Across the lawn--A footstep--The doctor!   As luck would have it, Harry's bed was near the door.  If he could but get out of the dormitory unobserved by the boys, that would be at least one rung mounted on the ladder of escape.  He was fully dressed, his boots only being unlaced.  So taking them off, he crept towards the door, and waiting cautiously, hidden by the now-welcome darkness, till a fresh noisy onset was made by his assailants on the bed where they supposed him to be, he stealthily lifted the latch and stood on the stairs.  He was not long creeping down to the first landing--a narrow carpeted passage, full of numerous doors, and terminating in a window which looked over a shed where the boots and knives, etc., were cleaned.  The stairs which led below, joined those of No. 7 dormitory at one end of the passage, exactly opposite to the window, the distance from the window to the stairs being about ten yards.  When Harry left his room he had not the least notion how he was going to accomplish his purpose.  He had only a vague idea that he was running away; and it was not till he alighted at the end of the passage mentioned, and saw from the other end the moonlight streaming in through the curtainless window, that it entered his head that there he might find means of escape.  So he stole cautiously along the passage, nervous, excited, fearing lest he should disturb any of the sleepers in the various rooms he passed.  The whole place was so still, he could almost hear his heart thumping.  The only thing besides that stirred the silence was the subdued monotonous snoring from the rooms.  A waft of fresh summer night-air made his heart leap with delight and eagerness.  The window was open.  The rest seemed easy.  The last door was passed, and he stood at the ledge looking out into the moonlight.  How quiet everything was!  Far off, across the playground, he saw a few lights burning in the different masters' houses; but the Doctor's, in a wing of which he was, was quite dark. Of course, he remembered, the Doctor was out.  How fortunate! and the kitchen-windows looked the other way.  The roof of the boot-house was about six feet below the window-ledge.  At the"]]]
