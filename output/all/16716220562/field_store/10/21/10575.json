Soon there was the greatest splashing and paddling and shouts of, \"My goodness, isn't the water cold!\" \"Can you swim this way?\" \"How far can you go, anyway?\"  Jimmie and the guide were swimming around near the shore when suddenly, two hundred feet ahead of them, they saw Peter disappear in what they supposed was shallow water. Jack was half-way the distance between the guide and Peter. It did not take him an instant to realize what had happened. But before he could get to the place where Peter had gone down, the lad had come up, struggled, and gone down again. As he came up once more Jack caught him by his curly hair, turned over on his back, holding Peter's head high out of the water, and swam calmly for the shallow place. Once there, the old man took Peter in his arms and hurried to shore, where they rolled him until they had the water out of him. Not a word was said, and modest, quiet Jack did not seem to think that he had been brave.  When Peter opened his eyes he said, \"Guess my pores weren't in the right place.\"     VIII  THE RAINY DAY   It was a rainy day. Poor Betty flattened her little nose against the window-panes of Turtle Lodge a dozen times. But outside all she could see were just the long, straight lines of the down-coming rain and an empty road leading downhill to the edge of the pond; all she could hear was the drum of the water upon the roof. Inside, Jimmie was developing films in his laboratory, and was not in the least interested in what Betty might be doing.  \"Oh, mother,\" called Betty, \"I am so tired; there isn't anything to do!\"  \"Why don't you sew on a dress for Belinda?\" asked Mrs. Reece.  \"Belinda has too many clothes; she has more than I have, mother, and she's a naughty dolly to-day.\"  \"Well, let me see--get Lizzie to let you make cake.\"  \"Lizzie's cross, and I'm afraid to. I wish the guide were here. He's never cross, and never too busy to tell you something that's interesting.\" Betty looked out of the window. \"He's coming now! Goody! Goody!\"  When old Ben Gile reached the steps there was a little girl dancing inside the door and still shouting \"Goody!\"  \"What's this?\"  \"You'll tell me a story, won't you?\"  \"Tell you a story! Dear, dear, I never knew such a little greedy for stories. I've brought you something.\"  Betty's face was shining now. She had forgotten the rain, the dreary day, cross Lizzie, and everything. Ben Gile took a box out of his pocket. \"What is it?\" she asked.  \"I have a box full of little elves for you.\"  \"Elves!\" exclaimed Betty.  \"Yes, little elves, little brownies.\"  \"Come into the study, where there is a fire.\" Mrs. Reece led the way. \"Then you can tell us all about these elves.\" They sat down around the fire, and Mrs. Reece continued, \"Don't you think it would be fun to pop corn while we're hearing about the brownies?\"  Betty was delighted, and ran for a corn-popper, and soon there was the merry sound of crackling wood, popping corn, and happy voices--all sounds that proved so tempting that before long Jimmie joined the others.  \"My little elf is a bug,\" began the hermit.  \"A _bug_ an elf?\"  \"Yes, a bug; and when he doesn't look like an elf, he looks like a king with a high crown on his head or a naughty boy with a dunce cap.\"  \"Let's see him, please,\" said Betty.  The old man opened his box. Inside lay a lot of little creatures with backs like beechnuts. \"See, look through the lens!\"  Betty laughed. \"Oh, aren't they funny! The eyes are so big and so far apart.\"  \"And the lines on their heads make them look as if they were gazing through heavy-bowed spectacles,\" said Mrs. Reece.  \"There is a very wise man, and his name is Mr. Comstock, who says that Nature must have been in a joking mood when she made these little tree and leaf hoppers, they are so impish and knowing-looking. Ah, they are the naughty brownies of the insect world!\"  \"Betty, Betty,\" called Mrs. Reece, \"your popcorn is burning!\"  [Illustration: Tree and Leaf Hoppers]  \"Mother, I don't care to pop any more; let me just listen now. What makes them bad?\"  \"Well, they are born with a naughty desire to suck everything they can get their tiny sucking beaks upon. They hop around in great numbers on the fruit trees and pierce the leaves with their sharp beaks. Then, with a tubelike lower lip, they suck up the sap. They also make slits in the twigs in which to lay their eggs. In the following spring the eggs hatch, and there is a fresh supply of tree-hoppers ready to begin the mischief their parents left off only when they died.\"  \"And what is the difference between the leaf-hoppers and the tree-hoppers?\" asked Mr. Reece.  \"Not much. They are cousins--cousins in naughtiness. The leaf-hoppers are a great nuisance. Every year they destroy from one-fourth to one-fifth of the grass that springs up. They also suck the sap of the rose, the grape-vine, and of many grains. These sturdy fellows live during the winter by hiding under the rubbish in the fields and vineyards, ready when the warm spring does come to begin their naughty work.\"  \"What makes a little fellow like this able to do so much damage?\" asked Jimmie, who had come in, his hands all stained with chemicals.  \"Well, it is well covered by this horny substance called chitin, and then it is very active. You see, the chitin acts both as armor-plate for the soft parts and also as a firm support to the many muscles. As many as two thousand separate, tiny muscles have been counted in a certain caterpillar. That shows how very active insects are.\"  \"And they all have such big eyes they can see everything,\" said Betty.  \"So they have--bigger eyes than the old wolf of the story had.\"  \"You remember, I told you about the thousands of facets in the big eyes of the darning-needle? Not contented with these large eyes, most insects have three small eyes arranged in the form of a triangle on the front of the head.\"  \"This bug has feelers, too,\" said Jimmie.  \"So it has. Insects use these feelers, or antennæ, for all sorts of purposes--some for touch, some for smell, some for hearing. Ants exchange greetings by touching antennæ, and recognize a friend or an enemy by the odor. The antennæ of a male mosquito are covered with fine hairs. When Mrs. Mosquito sings, all the tiny hairs on Mr. Mosquito's feelers are set in motion, and he becomes aware of Mrs. Mosquito.\"  Mrs. Reece laughed. \"That's a new kind of romance!\"  \"Mother, what's a romance?\" asked Betty.  \"You'll know, dear, in time.\"  \"Notice this imp's mouth,\" said the guide. \"It's made for sucking. But there's a great difference in the mouths of insects: some are made for biting, some for lapping, some for piercing, and some for sucking. The butterfly, which lives on nectar in the depths of the flowers, has a long, coiled tube which scientists call a proboscis. This it unrolls and buries in the throat of the flower. Mrs. Mosquito has a file and pump, for it is she, and not her husband, who does all the singing and biting. The male mosquito has nothing more than a mouth for sucking nectar. And I told you about the biting jaws of the locust with which it nibbles grass and leaves.\"  \"And does the tree-hopper breathe the way the locust does--through those pores on the side?\"  \"Yes, child,\" said the old man, \"and the air-pores are protected by fine hairs which surround the openings, just the way the hairs in your nostrils keep the dust from getting up your nose and into your throat.\"  \"Things in the bugs,\" said Betty, \"are so like us.\"  \"The world becomes more and more like one great whole as you grow older,\" added Ben Gile. \"Those are interesting elves I've been telling you about, aren't they?\"  \"I didn't know bug elves could be so interesting.\"  \"Now run and get us some of the fresh cake Lizzie has been baking,\" said Mrs. Reece. \"I hope it will taste as good as it smells.\"     IX  THE PRIZE   There were two canoes going up the little river which led out from the pond. In the first were Ben Gile with Betty, Hope, and Jack. In the second Jimmie and Peter paddled Mrs. Reece. They had trout rods, although they did not plan to fish very much, and well-filled luncheon-baskets, magnifying-glasses, cameras, boxes, and various other things.  In two weeks they were to go on a camping expedition, and to-day's trip was taken chiefly to find a good place for the first night's stop.  The children were all excitement about the camping, which was to be the last jollity of their happy summer, and they asked so many questions about what they were to take with them, and they asked the same questions over so many times, that at last Mrs. Reece put her hands on her ears and called to the guide, who was paddling vigorously ahead.  \"Well,\" he called back, \"a frying-pan and an axe, and perhaps a tent.\" He allowed his canoe to drop nearer Mrs. Reece's. \"What naughty children you are,\" he continued, \"to bother the life out of your poor mother! I know of some other children, too, who are very naughty. I see one flying now.\"  \"That pretty little thing,\" exclaimed Betty, \"with the gauzy wings?\"  \"Yes, that pretty little thing; its wings have many, many veins. When Lace-Wing is a baby and is called a larva, it does not look like this, for its jaws are strong and very sharp. After it has eaten and grown for some time it makes a house for itself, where it rolls up for a nap. While it is lying very still in this little house many things are happening.\"  \"What happens?\" asked Jack.  \"Well, it is changing from a baby to a grown-up, and while it is growing up into an insect it is called a pupa. Don't mistake this for papa--it does not look like your papa at all.\"  Betty thought this was very funny, because her father was a great big man over six feet tall.  \"After its wings are made and it looks just like its mamma, Lace-Wing crawls out of its house and flies away.\"  [Illustration: Pit of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],["title","Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#7)"],["body","Ant-Lion]  \"Has it any cousins, like the locust?\" asked Betty.  \"Yes, it has cousins; the ant-lion and caddis-fly both belong to this family. But little Lace-Wing, with its beautiful green body, gauzy wings, and golden eyes, is the most graceful member of the family.\"  \"How do they live when they are babies?\" asked Hope.  \"When they are babies,\" said Ben Gile, opening his eyes wide and speaking in a loud, deep voice, \"they go about like lions seeking whom they may devour.\"  Betty was frightened.  \"No, no, child,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"not a real lion.\"  \"Just an aphis-lion,\" explained the guide, his eyes twinkling. \"They are called aphis-lions because they are very cruel to the little green plant-lice I told you about. You remember, the plant-lice live on plants, and with their sucking beaks pump the sap from the plants. The aphis-lions crawling over the plants come across the little aphid. Quick as a wink they stick their sharp claws in the soft body of the plant-louse and drink the blood with their sharp-pointed jaws. They are very fond of eggs, too, and Mamma Lace-Wing is careful of her eggs, because she knows the mischievous ways of her children.\"  \"What does Mamma Lace-Wing do with her eggs?\" inquired Mrs. Reece.  \"Each egg which she lays has a tiny stem, and the stems are fastened to a leaf or twig. When the babies hatch out they crawl down onto the leaf and hunt around for something to eat. Perhaps if they knew more they would crawl up the little egg stems and eat their own brothers and sisters.\"  \"Oh, what cannibals!\" cried Betty.  \"Yes, it is not pleasant, this Fiji Island of the insects, but it is their nature.\"  \"They do seek their meat from God,\" murmured Mrs. Reece.  \"Yes, it is a mystery,\" answered the old man. \"But, dear me, I have forgotten my story. Well, in about ten days they find a nicely sheltered spot and spin a little silken cocoon about themselves. In this they stay for a couple of weeks, while they are changing into grown-up lace-wings. When they are finished they cut a round door in their silken house, spread their gauzy wings, stretch their delicate green bodies, rub their eyes in wonder at the sunny world, and fly away to lay some little eggs on slender stems just like those which their mothers laid and from which they came.\"  \"See,\" said Jimmie, \"what a place for camping!\"  \"But it is too near home,\" objected Peter. \"We could get here in two hours.\"  \"So we could,\" admitted Jimmie.  \"Tell us something about the cousins, sir,\" said Jack.  \"We can't have much more now,\" replied the guide, \"for we shall have to stop for luncheon soon. But I'll tell you about a little fellow called the ant-lion. Along the side of almost any country path or road, if you keep your eyes open, you may notice some day little pits of sand with sloping sides, and down at the bottom of this is a hole. The hole is very dark, and unless you look sharply you will think it just a hole. But if you examine it you will see a little head and two little sharp, curved jaws. These are the jaws of the ant-lion, lying in wait to gobble up the first passer-by. The rest of the body is in a little tunnel burrowed out in the sand. They get their name, I suppose, because they think an ant an excellent dinner. They lie there knowing very well that Mr. and Mrs. Ant will surely slip on the steep-sloping sides. And if by any chance they don't, these ant-lions have been seen to throw up sand with their heads in order to hit a helpless little ant and knock it down into the pit.\"  The children exclaimed at this cleverness.  \"After it has eaten its fill, this cruel, greedy fellow makes a little room for itself of fine grains of sand firmly held together with silky fibres. In this room it lies quietly, sometimes all winter, until it changes into a grown-up ant-lion with four long, narrow wings. Then Mrs. Ant-Lion lays her eggs in the sand, and when the young ones hatch out they build the 'pits of destruction' which I told you about. What book is it, children, that uses the 'pit of destruction' so often as a figure?\"  \"The Bible!\" shouted Peter, who was the minister's son in Rangeley Village.  \"Good! Now, no more for the present, and here we are at a splendid place for luncheon--clear spring, dry ground, handy wood, and all.\"  The canoe beached noiselessly on the river's edge, the boys jumped out with a whoop, and soon luncheon and frying-pans were out of the canoes, and there was the sound of the axe chopping the dry wood, the good smell of smoke, and the sizzling of bacon. Betty and Hope went for water. The boys fetched wood. Mrs. Reece and the guide took care of the luncheon, Mrs. Reece spreading the table on the ground, and the guide frying the potatoes and bacon.  \"Oh, mother,\" said Jimmie, \"what does make things taste so good out-of-doors?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know.\"  \"And, mother,\" asked Betty, \"what does make everything so pretty?\"  \"You ask mother a hard question.\"  \"And oh, Mrs. Reece,\" exclaimed Jack, his thin, eager face shining with excitement, \"everything in the world is so wonderful!\"  \"It's all so different in the winter,\" said Peter, in between bites of bread-and-butter. \"It isn't half so nice, but I suppose it would be lovely if we could have you and Mr. Gile--\"  \"You dear child!\"  \"It is about three miles above here,\" the guide spoke, \"on the last of the Dead River Ponds, where we shall find our first camping ground. I want you to look at it.\"  \"And we'll be gone days and days.\"  \"Goody! goody!\" called Betty, clapping her hands. \"And we'll sleep out-of-doors, cook out-of-doors, and do everything out-of-doors.\"  Every one smiled with her, for there was not a person there who was not looking forward with happiness to this trip.  \"Before we start on I'll smoke my pipe,\" said the old man.  \"Then, please, sir, won't you tell us something else?\" asked Betty.  \"Why, I have nothing left in my head, you child.\"  \"Oh, please, sir, you said there was another cousin called the caddis-worm.\"  \"So I did,\" said the old man. \"Fetch me that stone, Jack.\" He pointed to a stone lying in the water. Jack brought it to him, and he broke something off from it. \"What's that?\"  \"That's a stick,\" answered Betty.  \"No, that's not a stick, that's a caddis-worm. This little fellow, unlike some spoiled children I know, has to find its own dinner, change its own clothes, tuck itself into bed, and build its own house. And it is brighter than some children I know,\" said the old man, looking kindly at Peter. \"The caddis-worm builds itself different kinds of houses. Some of the houses are shaped like the horns you blow on the Fourth of July, and one kind of house is made of the finest sand, fastened together with bands of finest silk, which the caddis spins. Our caddis-worm has patience,\" said the old man, shaking his head and looking at Jimmie--\"patience, plenty of patience.\" He puffed away at his pipe for a few seconds. \"Some build rougher houses, choosing small pebbles instead of sand. Of these it builds a long tube. Others make a little green summer cottage with twigs, grasses, and pine-needles, from which they build an attractive bungalow by laying down four pieces and crossing the ends like this: # These cottages are built about an inch long, and in them the young caddis-worms have a cool and cosey summer home. Often these little houses have silken hangings inside. The little owners fasten the hooks at the ends of their bodies to these and moor themselves securely.\"  \"What do you call it a worm for?\" asked Mrs. Reece.  \"Well, it looks a little like a worm. It has a long, slender body, but it has six jointed legs, which real worms don't have. See this fellow!\" Ben Gile pulled the worm out of its case.  \"Oh, see! part of the body is so pale and soft!\"  \"That, child, is because it is always covered by the little house. The front end and the legs, however, are darker. That's sunburn, I suppose.\"  \"When young Master Caddis-Worm goes out for a swim or a walk it pushes its six legs out-of-doors, and walks along, carrying its house with it. Very convenient, you see! No doors to lock! And if it gets tired it does not have to walk home; it just walks in and goes to sleep under a nice, smooth stone. Some roam about and some stay at home. These creatures are pretty much like human beings in their ways.  \"One of the young caddis-worms prefers fishing to walking, like some other young fellows I know. On a stone near its house it spins a fine web, turned up-stream, so that any tender little insects floating down-stream get lodged in it. An easy way to get your dinner--just to go to a net and eat.\"  The guide paused for a long time, clouds of smoke circling about his white beard and white hair. The children thought he would never go on. \"I've had something on my mind for days,\" he said, \"and I'll speak of it now. The boy or girl who learns most about the ants before September 15th shall win a prize. This prize is to be a magnifying-glass, a book of colored plates of the insects, very beautiful and very big, and a five-dollar gold piece.\"  \"A prize, a prize!\" shouted the children, jumping madly about, while Mrs. Reece and the guide smiled at each other.  \"Now we've had our dinner, our rest, our pipe of peace, a plan for a prize, and we must push on for the camping-ground. Get the canoes ready.\"  And, with laughter and talking, the canoes were off up the river again.     X  A NAGGING FAMILY   \"Do you know of a family around here whom no one likes?\" asked Ben Gile.  The lanterns were burning brightly out on the lawn of Turtle Lodge, and Mrs. Reece had just stopped playing so that the children might rest from dancing. All the lanterns moved gently to and fro on the piazza; the children were running about, and everybody seemed to be having a beautiful and breathless time. \"Do you know of a family around here,\" called the guide, \"whom nobody likes?\"  \"I do,\" replied Mrs. Reece, laughing and slapping the side of her face. \"They are just like some people, nagging,"]]]
