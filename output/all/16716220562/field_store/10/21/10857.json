It was explained to Lancaster that one Dr. Sophoulis had first seen the possibilities and organized the research. It had gone ahead slowly, hampered by a lack of needed materials and expert personnel. When Sophoulis died, none of his assistants felt capable of carrying on the work at any decent rate of speed. They were all competent in their various specialties, but it takes more than training to do basic research--a certain inborn, intuitive flair is needed. So they had sent to Earth for a new boss--Lancaster.  The physicist scratched his head in puzzlement. It didn't seem right that something so important should have to take the leavings of technical personnel. Secrecy or not, the most competent men on Earth should have been tapped for this job, and they should have been given everything they needed to carry it through. Then he forgot his bewilderment in the clean chill ecstasy of the work.         *       *       *       *       *  Man had been hunting superior dielectrics for a long time now. It was more than a question of finding the perfect electrical insulator, though that would be handy too. What was really important was the sort of condensers made possible by a genuinely good dielectric material. Given that, you could do fantastic things in electronics. Most significant of all was the matter of energy storage. If you could store large amounts of electricity in an accumulator of small volume, without appreciable leakage loss, you could build generators designed to handle average rather than peak load--with resultant savings in cost; you could build electric motors, containing their own energy supply and hence portable--which meant electric automobiles and possibly aircraft; you could use inconveniently located power sources, such as remote waterfalls, or dilute sources like sunlight, to augment--maybe eventually replace--the waning reserves of fuel and fissionable minerals; you could.... Lancaster's mind gave up on all the possibilities opening before him and settled down to the immediate task at hand.  \"The original mineral was found on Venus, in the Gorbu-vashtar country,\" explained Karen Marek. \"Here's a sample.\" She gave him a lump of rough, dense material which glittered in hard rainbow points of light. \"It was just a curiosity at first, till somebody thought to test its electrical properties. Those were slightly fantastic. We have all chemical and physical data on this stuff already, of course, as well as an excellent idea of its crystal structure. It's a funny mixture of barium and titanium compounds with some rare earths and--well, read the report for yourself.\"  Lancaster's eyes skimmed down the sheaf of papers she handed him. \"Can't make very good condensers out of this,\" he objected. \"Too brittle--and look how the properties vary with temperature. A practical dielectric has to be stable in every way, at least over the range of conditions you intend to use it in.\"  She nodded.  \"Of course. Anyway, the mineral is very rare on Venus, and you know how tough it is to search for anything in Gorbu-vashtar. What's important is the lead it gave Sophoulis. You see, the dielectric constant of this material isn't constant at all. It _increases_ with applied voltage. Look at this curve here.\"  Lancaster whistled. \"What the devil--but that's impossible! That much variability means a crystal structure which is--uh--flexible, damn it! But you've got a brittle substance here--\"  According to the accepted theory of dielectricity, this couldn't be. Lancaster realized with a thumping behind his veins that the theory would have to be modified. Rather, this was an altogether different phenomenon from normal insulation.  He supposed some geological freak had formed the mineral. Venus was a strange planet anyway. But that didn't matter. The important thing now was to get to know this process. He went off into a happy mist of quantum mechanics, oscillation theory, and periodic functions of a complex variable.  Karen and Isaacson exchanged a slow smile.         *       *       *       *       *  Sophoulis and his people had done heroic work under adverse conditions. A tentative theory of the mechanism involved had already been formulated, and the search had started for a means to duplicate the super-dielectricity in materials otherwise more suitable to man's needs. But as he grew familiar with the place and the job, Lancaster wondered just how adverse the conditions really were.  True, the equipment was old and cranky, much of it haywired together, much of it invented from scratch. But Rakkan the Martian, for all his lack of formal education, was unbelievably clever where it came to making apparatus and making it behave, and Friedrichs was a top-flight designer. The lab had what it needed--wasn't that enough?  The rest of Lancaster's crew were equally good. The Dufreres were physical chemists _par excellence_, Isaacson a brilliant crystallographer with an unusual brain for mathematics, Hwang an expert on quantum theory and inter-atomic forces, Karen an imaginative experimenter. None of them quite had the synthesizing mentality needed for an overall picture and a fore-vision of the general direction of work--that had been Sophoulis' share, and was now Lancaster's--but they were all cheerful and skilled where it came to detail work and could often make suggestions in a theoretical line.  Then, too, there was no Security snooping about, no petty scramble for recognition and promotion, no red tape. What was more important, Lancaster began to realize, was the personal nature of the whole affair. In a Project, the overall chief set the pattern, and it was followed by his subordinates with increasingly less latitude as you worked down through the lower ranks. You did what you were told, produced results or else, and kept your mouth shut outside your own sector of the Project. You had only the vaguest idea of what actually was being created, and why, and how it fitted into the broad scheme of society.  Hwang and Rakkan commented on that, one \"evening\" at dinner when they had grown more relaxed in Lancaster's presence. \"It was inevitable, I suppose, that scientific research should become corporate,\" said the Chinese. \"So much equipment was needed, and so many specialties had to be coordinated, that the solitary genius with only a few assistants hadn't a chance. Nevertheless, it's a pity. It's destroyed initiative in many promising young men. The top man is no longer a scientist at all--he's an administrator with some technical background. The lower ranks do have to exercise ingenuity, yes, but only along the lines they are ordered to follow. If some interesting sideline crops up, they can't investigate it. All they can do is submit a memorandum to the chief, and most likely if anything is done it will be carried out by someone else.\"  \"What would you do about it?\" shrugged Lancaster. \"You just admitted that the old-time genius in a garret can't compete.\"  \"No--but the small team of creative specialists, each with an excellent understanding of the others' fields, and each working in a loose, free-willed cooperation with the rest, can. Indeed, the results will be much better. It was tried once, you may know. The early cybernetics men, back in the last century, worked that way.\"  \"I wish we could co-opt some biologists and psychologists into this,\" murmured Rakkan. His English was good, though indescribably accented by his vocal apparatus. \"The cellular and neural implications of dielectricity look--promising. Maybe later.\"  \"Well,\" said Lancaster defensively, \"a large Project can be made more secure--less chance of leakage.\"  Hwang said nothing, but he cocked an eyebrow at an almost treasonable angle.         *       *       *       *       *  In going through Sophoulis' equations, Lancaster found what he believed was the flaw that was blocking progress. The man had used a simplified quantum mechanics without correction for relativistic effects. That made for neater mathematics but overlooked certain space-time aspects of the psi function. The error was excusable, for Sophoulis had not been familiar with the Belloni matrix, a mathematical tool that brought order into what was otherwise incomprehensible chaos. Belloni's work was still classified information, being too useful, in the design of new alloys, for general consumption. Lancaster went happily to work correcting the equations. But when he was finished, he realized that he had no business showing his results without proper clearance.  He wandered glumly into the lab. Karen was there alone, setting up an apparatus for the next attempt at heat treatment. A smock covered her into shapelessness, and her spectacular hair was bound up in a kerchief, but she still looked good. Lancaster, a shy man, was more susceptible to her than he wanted to be.  \"Where's Berg?\" he asked.  \"Back on Earth with Jessup,\" she told him. \"Why?\"  \"Damn! It holds up the whole business till he returns.\" Lancaster explained his difficulty.  Karen laughed. \"Oh, that's all right,\" she said in the low voice he liked to hear. \"We've all been cleared.\"  \"Not officially. I've got to see the papers.\"  She glared at him then and stamped her foot. \"How stupid can you get without having to be spoon fed?\" she snapped. \"You've seen how much we think of regulations here. Let's have those equations, Mac.\"  \"But--blast it, Karen, you don't appreciate the need for security. Berg explained it to me once--how dangerous the rebels are, and how easily they can steal our secrets. And they'll stop at nothing. Do you want another Hemispheric War?\"  She looked oddly at him, and when she spoke it was softly. \"Allen, do you really believe that?\"  \"Certainly! It's obvious, isn't it? Our country is maintaining the peace of the Solar System--once we drop the reins, all hell will run away from us.\"  \"What's wrong with setting up a world-wide federation of countries? Most"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22239"],["title","Security (#4)"],["body","nations are willing.\"  \"But that--it's not _practical_!\"  \"How do you know? It's never been tried.\"  \"Anyway, we can't decide policy. That's just not for us.\"  \"The United States is a democratic country--remember?\"  \"But--\" Lancaster looked away. For a moment he stood unspeaking, and she watched him with grave eyes and said nothing. Then, not really knowing why he did it, he lifted a defiant head. \"All right! We'll go ahead--and if Berg sends us all to camp, don't blame me.\"  \"He won't.\" She laughed and clapped his shoulder. \"You know, Allen, there are times when I think you're human after all.\"  \"Thanks,\" he grinned wryly. \"How about--uh--how about having a--a b-beer with me now? To celebrate.\"  \"Why, sure.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They went down to the shop. A cooler of beer was there, its contents being reckoned as among the essential supplies brought from Earth by Jessup. Lancaster uncapped two bottles, and he and Karen sat down on a bench, swinging their legs and looking over the silent, waiting machines. Most of the station personnel were off duty now, in the arbitrary \"night.\"  He sighed at last. \"I like it here.\"  \"I'm glad you do, Allen.\"  \"It's a funny place, but I like it. The station and all its wacky inhabitants. They're heterodox as the very devil and would have trouble getting a dog catcher's job back home, but they're all refreshing.\" Lancaster snapped his fingers. \"Say, that's it! That's why you're all out here. The government needs your talents, and you aren't quite trusted, so you're put here out of range of spies. Right?\"  \"Do you have to see a rebel with notebook in hand under every bed?\" she asked with a hint of weariness. \"The First Amendment hasn't been repealed yet, they say. Theoretically we're all entitled to our own opinions.\"  \"Okay, okay, I won't argue politics. Tell me about some of the people here, will you? They're an odd bunch.\"  \"I can't tell you much, Allen. That's where Security does apply. Isaacson is a Martian colonist, you've probably guessed that already. Jessup lost his hand in a--a fight with some enemies once. The Dufreres had a son who was killed in the Moroccan incident.\" Lancaster remembered that that affair had involved American power used to crush a French spy ring centered in North Africa. Sovereignty had been brushed aside. But damn it, you had to preserve the status quo, for your own survival if nothing else. \"Hwang had to go into exile when the Chinese government changed hands a few years back. I--\"  \"Yes?\" he asked when her voice faded out.  \"Oh, I might as well tell you. My husband and I lived in America after our marriage. He was a good biotechnician and had a job with one of the big pharmaceutical companies. Only he--went to camp. Later he died or was shot, I don't know which.\" Her words were flat.  \"That's a shame,\" he said inadequately.  \"The funny part of it is, he wasn't engaged in treason at all. He was quite satisfied with things as they were--oh, he talked a little, but so does everybody. I imagine some rival or enemy put the finger on him.\"  \"Those things happen,\" said Lancaster. \"It's too bad, but they happen.\"  \"They're bound to occur in a police state,\" she said. \"Sorry. We weren't going to argue politics, were we?\"  \"I never said the world was perfect, Karen. Far from it. Only what alternative have we got? Any change is likely to be so dangerous that--well, man can't afford mistakes.\"  \"No, he can't. But I wonder if he isn't making one right now. Oh, well. Give me another beer.\"  They talked on indifferent subjects till Karen said it was her bedtime. Lancaster escorted her to her apartment. She looked at him curiously as he said good night, and then went inside and closed the door. Lancaster had trouble getting to sleep.         *       *       *       *       *  The corrected equations provided an adequate theory of super-dielectricity--a theory with tantalizing hints about still other phenomena--and gave the research team a precise idea of what they wanted in the way of crystal structure. Actually, the substance to be formed was only semi-crystalline, with plastic features as well, all interwoven with a grid of carbon-linked atoms. Now the trick was to produce that stuff. Calculation revealed what elements would be needed, and what spatial arrangement--only how did you get the atoms to assume the required configuration and hook up in the right way?  Theory would get you only so far, thereafter it was cut and try. Lancaster rolled up his sleeves with the rest and let Karen take over the leadership--she was the best experimenter. He spent some glorious and all but sleepless weeks, greasy, dirty, living in a jungle of haywired apparatus with a restless slide rule. There were plenty of failures, a lot of heartbreak and profanity, an occasional injury--but they kept going, and they got there.  The day came--or was it the night?--when Karen took a slab of darkly shining substance out of the furnace where it had been heat-aging. Rakkan sawed it into several chunks for testing. It was Lancaster who worked on the electric properties.  He applied voltage till his generator groaned, and watched in awe as meters climbed and climbed without any sign of stopping. He discharged the accumulated energy in a single blue flare that filled the lab with thunder and ozone. He tested for time lag of an electric signal and wondered wildly if it didn't feel like sleeping on its weary path.  The reports came in, excited yells from one end of the long, cluttered room to the other, exultant whoops and men pounding each other on the back. This was it! This was the treasure at the rainbow's end.         *       *       *       *       *  The substance and its properties were physically and chemically stable over a temperature range of hundreds of degrees. The breakdown voltage was up in the millions. The insulation resistance was better than the best known to Earth's science.  The dielectric constant could be varied at will by a simple electric field normal to the applied voltage gradient--a field which could be generated by a couple of dry cells if need be--and ranged from a hundred thousand to about three billion. For all practical purposes, here was the ultimate dielectric.  \"We did it!\" Friedrichs slapped Lancaster's back till it felt that the ribs must crack. \"We have it!\"  \"Whooppee!\" yelled Karen.  Suddenly they had joined hands and were dancing idiotically around the induction furnace. Lancaster clasped Rakkan's talons without caring that it was a Martian. They sang then, sang till heads appeared at the door and the glassware shivered.      _Here we go 'round the mulberry bush,      The mulberry bush, the mulberry bush--_  It called for a celebration. The end of a Project meant no more than filing a last report and waiting for the next assignment, but they ran things differently out here. Somebody broke out a case of Venusian aguacaliente. Somebody else led the way to a storeroom, tossed its contents into the hall, and festooned it with used computer tape. Rakkan forgot his Martian dignity and fiddled for a square dance, with Isaacson doing the calling. The folk from the other end of the station swarmed in till the place overflowed. It was quite a party.  Hours later, Lancaster was hazily aware of lying stretched on the floor. His head was in Karen's lap and she was stroking his hair. The hardy survivors were following the Dufreres in French drinking songs, which are the best in the known universe. Rakkan's fiddle wove in and out, a lovely accompaniment to voices that were untrained but made rich and alive by triumph.      _\"Sur ma tomb' je veux qu'on inscrive:      'Ici-git le roi des buveurs.'      Sur ma tomb' je veux qu'on inscrive:      'Ici-git le roi des buveurs.        Ici-git, oui, oui, oui,        Ici-git, non, non, non--'\"_  Lancaster knew that he had never been really happy before.         *       *       *       *       *  Berg showed up a couple of days later, looking worried. Lancaster's vacation time was almost up. When he heard the news, his eyes snapped gleefully and he pumped the physicist's hand. \"Good work, boy!\"  \"There are things to clean up yet,\" said Lancaster, \"but it's all detail. Anybody can do it.\"  \"And the material--what do you call it, anyway?\"  Karen grinned. \"So far, we've only named it _ffuts_,\" she said. \"That's 'stuff' spelled backward.\"  \"Okay, okay. It's easy to manufacture?\"  \"Sure. Now that we know how, anybody can make it in his own home--if he's handy at tinkering apparatus together.\"  \"Fine, fine! Just what was needed. This is the ticket.\" Berg turned back to Lancaster. \"Okay, boy, you can pack now. We blast again in a few hours.\"  The physicist shuffled his feet. \"What are my chances of getting re-assigned back here?\" he asked. \"I've liked it immensely. And now that I know about it anyway--\"  \"I'll see. I'll see. But remember, this is top secret. You go back to your regular job and don't say a word on this to anyone less than the President--no matter what happens, understand?\"  \"Of course,\" snapped Lancaster, irritated. \"I know my duty.\"  \"Yeah, so you do.\" Berg sighed. \"So you do.\"  Leavetaking was tough for all concerned. They had grown fond of the quiet, bashful man--and as for him, he wondered how he'd get along among normal people. These were his sort. Karen wept openly and kissed him good-bye with a fervor that haunted his dreams afterward. Then she stumbled desolately back to her quarters. Even Berg looked glum.  He regained his cockiness on the trip home, though, and insisted on talking all the way. Lancaster, who wanted to be alone with his thoughts, was annoyed, but you don't insult a Security man.  \"You understand the importance of this whole business, and why it has to be secret?\" nagged Berg. \"I'm not thinking of the scientific and industrial applications, but the military ones.\"  \"Oh, sure. You can make lightning throwers if you want to. And you've overcome the fuel problem. With "]]]
