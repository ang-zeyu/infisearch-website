From Boston, Mass. (1645), the first American ship from the colonies set sail to engage in the stealing of African negroes.  Massachusetts then held, under sanction of law, a few blacks and Indians in bondage.( 8)  But slavery did not flourish in New England.  It was neither profitable nor in consonance with the judgment of the people generally.  The General Court of Massachusetts, as early as 1646, \"bearing witness against the heinous crimes of man-stealing, ordered the recently imported negroes to be restored, at the public charge, to their native country, with a _letter_ expressing the indignation of the General Court.\"  Unfortunately, persons guilty of stealing men could not be tried for crimes committed in foreign lands.  But the African slave trade, early found to be extremely profitable, and hence popular, did not cease.  England, then as now, the most enterprising of commercial nations on the high seas, engrossed the trade, in large part, from 1680 to 1780.  In 1711, there was established a slave depot in New York City on or near what is now Wall Street; and about the same time a depot was established for receiving slaves in Boston, near where the old Franklin House stood. From New England ships, and perhaps from others, negroes were landed and sent to these and other central slave markets.  But few of these freshly stolen negroes were sold to Northern slaveholders.  Slave labor was not even then found profitable in the climate of the North.  The bondsman went to a more southern clime, and to the cotton, rice, and tobacco fields of the large plantations of the South.  As late as 1804-7, negroes from the coast of Africa were brought to Boston, Bristol, Providence, and Hartford to be sold into slavery.  Shipowners of all the coast colonies, and later of all the coast States of the United States, engaged in the slave trade.  But it was among the planters of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas that slaves proved to be most profitable.  The people in these sections were principally rural; plantations were large, not subject to be broken up by frequent partition, if at all.  The crops raised were better suited to cultivation by slaves in large numbers; and the hot climate was better adapted to the physical nature of the African negro.  The first inhabitants of the South preferred a rural life, and on large plantations.  The Crown grants to early proprietors favored this, especially in the Virginia and Carolina colonies.  The Puritans did not love or foster slavery as did the Cavalier of the South. Castes or classes existed among the Southern settlers from the beginning, which, with other favoring causes, made it easier for slavery to take root and prosper, and ultimately fasten itself upon and become a dominating factor in the whole social and political fabric of the South.  Slavery there soon came to be considered of paramount importance in securing a high social status or a high, so-called, civilization.  But we have, by this brief _résumé_, sufficiently shown that the responsibility for the introduction and maintenance of slavery and the slave trade does not rest exclusively on any of our early colonies, North or South, nor on any one race or nationality of the world; it remains now to show, in a summary way, how slavery and the slave trade were treated and regarded by the different sections of the United States after allegiance to England was thrown off.  While slavery died out from local and natural causes, if not wholly for moral, social, and religious reasons, in the States north of Maryland, it flourished and ripened into strength and importance in States south, casting a controlling influence and power over the whole of the United States socially, and for the most part dominating the country politically.  The greatest statesmen and brightest intellects of the North, though convinced of the evils of slavery and of its fatal tendencies, were generally too cowardly to attack it politically, although but about one fifth of the whole white population of the slave states in 1860, or perhaps at any time, was, through family relationship, or otherwise, directly or indirectly interested in slaves or slave labor.  Old political parties were in time disrupted, and new ones were formed on slavery issues.  The slavery question rent in twain the Methodist Episcopal and Presbyterian churches.  The followers of Wesley and Calvin divided on slavery.  It was always essentially an aristocratic institution, and hence calculated to benefit only a few of the great mass of freemen.  In 1860, there was in the fifteen slave States a white population of 8,039,000 and a slave population of 3,953,696.  Of the white population only 384,884 were slaveholders, and, including their families, only about 1,600,000 were directly or indirectly interested in slaves or their labor.  About 6,400,000 (80 per cent.) of the whites in these States had, therefore, no interest in the institution, and yet they were wholly subordinated to the few who were interested in it.  Curiously enough, slavery continued to exist, until a comparatively recent period, in many of the States that had early declared it abolished.  The States formed out of the territory \"Northwest of the River Ohio\" cannot be said to have ever been slave States. The sixth section of the Ordinance of 1787 prohibited slavery forever therein.  The slaves reported in such States were only there by tolerance.  They were free of right.  The Constitution of Illinois, as we shall presently see, did not at first abolish slavery; only prohibited the introduction of slaves.  The rebellion of the thirteen colonies in 1776 and the war for independence did not grow out of slavery; that war was waged neither to perpetuate nor to abolish it.  The Puritan and Cavalier, the opponents and the advocates of slavery and the slave trade, alike, fought for independence, and, when successful, united in the purpose to foster and build up an American Republic, based on the sovereignty of individual citizenship, but ignoring the natural rights of the enslaved negro.  The following table, compiled from the United States Census Reports, may be of interest.  It shows the number of slaves reported in each State and Territory of the United States at each Federal census.( 9)  _North_              1790    1800    1810    1820    1830    1840    1850    1860 Cal.  . . .  . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .

( 8)  The following letter of Cotton Mather will show the Puritan's intolerance of Wm. Penn and his Society of Friends, and the prevailing opinion in his time on slavery and the slave trade.    \"Boston, Massachusetts, September, 3, 1681. \"To ye Aged and Beloved John Higginson:  There be now at sea a skipper (for our friend Esaias Holderoft of London did advise me by the last packet that it would sail sometime in August) called ye _Welcome_ (R. Green was master), which has aboard a hundred or more of ye heretics and malignants called Quakers, with W. Penn, who is ye scamp at ye head of them.  \"Ye General court has accordingly given secret orders to master Malachi Huxtell of ye brig _Porpoise_ to waylaye ye said _Welcome_ as near ye coast of Codd as may be, and make captives of ye Penn and his ungodly crew, so that ye Lord may be glorified, and not mocked on ye soil of this new country with ye heathen worshippe of these people.  Much spoil can be made by selling ye whole lot to Barbadoes, where slaves fetch good prices in rumme and sugar.  We shall not only do ye Lord great service by punishing the Wicked, but shall make gayne for his ministers and people.  Yours in the bowels of Christ,    \"Cotton Mather.\"  ( 9)  Slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia by law of Congress, passed April 16, 1862.  President Lincoln's proclamation of January 1, 1863, emancipated all slaves in the seceded States (save in Tennessee and in parts of Louisiana and Virginia excepted therefrom) to the number of 3,063,395; those remaining were freed by the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution, December 18, 1865.   III DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE  The Declaration of Independence, though accepted at once and to be regarded through all time by the liberty-loving world as the best and boldest declaration in favor of human rights, and the most pronounced protest against oppression of the human race, is totally silent as to the rights of the slaves in the colonies.  It is true that Jefferson in his draft of this instrument, in the articles of indictment against King George III., used this language:  \"He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of distant people who never offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in the transportation thither, . . . determined to keep open a market where white men should be bought and sold; he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce.\"  To conciliate Georgia and South Carolina, this part of the indictment was struck out.  These colonies had never sought to restrain, but had always fostered the slave trade.  Jefferson, in his _Autobiography_ (vol. i, p. 19), suggests that other sections sympathized with Georgia and South Carolina in this matter.  \"Our Northern brethren . . . felt a little tender under these censures: for though their people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been considerable carriers of them to others.\"  Jefferson said King George preferred the advantage:  \"of a few British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American States and to the rights of human nature, deeply wounded by this infamous practice.\"(10)  While it is not true, as has often been claimed, that England is solely responsible for the introduction of slavery into her American colonies, it is true that her King and Parliament opposed almost every attempt to prohibit it or to restrict the importation of slaves.  Colonial legislative enactments of Virginia and other colonies directed against slavery were vetoed by the King or by his command by his royal governors.  Such governors were early forbidden to give their assent to any measure restricting slavery in the American colonies, and this policy was pursued until the colonies became independent.(11)  The treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States, signed at Paris, September 3, 1783, contained a stipulation that Great Britain should withdraw her armies from the United States \"with all convenient speed, and without causing any destruction, or _carrying_ away any _negroes or other property_ of the American inhabitants.\"  Both governments thus openly recognized, not only the existence of slavery in the United States, but that slaves were merely _property_.  While slavery was deeply seated in the colonies and had many advocates, including noted divines, who preached the \"divinity of slavery,\" there were, in 1776, and earlier, many great men, South as well as North, who looked confidently to an early emancipation of slaves, and who were then active in suppressing the African slave trade, among whom were Jefferson, Washington, Franklin, and the two Adamses.  Washington presided at a \"Fairfax County Convention,\" before the Revolution.  It resolved that \"no slaves ought to be imported into any of the British colonies\"; and Washington himself expressed \"the most earnest wish to see an entire stop forever put to such a wicked, cruel, and unnatural trade.\"(12)  John Wesley, when fully acquainted with American slavery and the slave trade, pronounced the latter as \"_the execrable sum of all villanies_,\" and he inveighed against the former as the wickedest of human practices.  The Continental Congress of 1776 resolved, \"that no slaves be imported into any of the thirteen United Colonies.\"  There had then been imported by the cruel traffic above 300,000 blacks, bought or stolen from the African shore; and the blacks then constituted twenty per cent. of the total population, a greater per centum than at any time since.  During the century previous to 1776, English and colonial slavers had carried into the West Indies and to English colonies nearly 3,000,000 negroes; and it is estimated that a quarter of a million more died of cruel treatment on shipboard, and their bodies were cast into the sea.  The words of the Declaration:  \"We hold these truths to be self- evident:  That _all men are created equal;_ that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are _life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,_\" were not accepted in fact as a charter of freedom for the enslaved African, but it remained for a Chief-Justice of the United States (Taney) more than eighty years later (March 5, 1857), in the Dred Scott decision, that did so much (as we will hereafter show) to disrupt the Union, to say:  \"The language used in the Declaration of Independence shows that neither the class of persons who had been imported as slaves, nor their descendants, whether they had become free or not, were then acknowledged as a part of the people, nor intended to be included in the general words used.\"  And the Chief-Justice said further:  \"They [the negroes] had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race, either in social or political relations; and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect, and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit.\"  Quoting the Declaration, \"_that all men are created equal_,\" he continued:  \"The general words above quoted would seem to embrace the whole human family, and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day would be so understood.  But it is too clear for dispute that the enslaved African race were not intended to be included, and formed no part of the people who framed and adopted this Declaration.\"  Notwithstanding this interpretation of the Declaration, free negroes fought for American independence at Bunker Hill; and although later it was decided that colored men should not be accepted as enlisted soldiers, General Washington did accept them, and thereafter they served in his army to the end of the war,(13) notably in large numbers at Yorktown.  The Royal Governor of Virginia in vain tried to induce slaves to revolt against their masters by promising them their freedom.  During Lord Howe's march through Pennsylvania it is said the slaves prayed for his success, believing he would set them free.  The British Parliament discussed a measure to set the slaves in the colonies free with a view to weaken their masters' ardor for freedom.  In Rhode Island slaves were, by law, set free on condition that they enlisted in the army for the war.  (10)  Parton's _Life of Jefferson_, p. 138.

IV CONTINENTAL CONGRESS--ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION 1774-1789  The Continental Congress, which assembled for the first time, September 5, 1774, at Carpenters' Hall, Philadelphia, assumed few powers, and its proceedings were, until the adoption by it of the Declaration of Independence, little more than protests against British oppression.  Nor was any central government formed on the adoption of the Declaration.  That Congress continued, by common agreement, to direct affairs, though, in the beginning, possessing no delegated political or governmental powers.  Slavery existed in the colonies or States prior to the Declaration by the connivance of British colonial authorities without the sanction of and against English law; and after the Declaration, by mere toleration as an"]]]
