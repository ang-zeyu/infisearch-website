I wrote my thesis on the theory of dielectric polarization and since then--no, that's classified.\"  \"M-hm.\" Berg took another sip of his drink. \"And right now you're just a cog in a computer-development Project. You see, I do know a few things about you. However, we've decided--higher up, you know, in fact on the very top level--to take you off it for the time being and put you on this other job, one concerning your specialty. Furthermore, you won't be part of a great organizational machine, but very much on your own. The fewer who know of this, the better.\"  Lancaster wasn't sure he liked that. Once the job was done--if he were possessed of all information on it--he might be incarcerated or even shot as a Security risk. Things like that had happened. But there wasn't much he could do about it.  \"Have no fears.\" Berg seemed to read his thoughts. \"Your reward may be a little delayed for Security reasons, but it will come in due time.\" He leaned forward, earnestly. \"I repeat, this project is _top secret_. It's a vital link in something much bigger than you can imagine, and few men below the President even know of it. Therefore, the very fact that you've worked on it--that you've done any outside work at all--must remain unknown, even to the chiefs of your Project.\"  \"Good stunt if you can do it,\" shrugged Lancaster. \"But I'm hot. Security keeps tabs on everything I do.\"  \"This is how we'll work it. You have a furlough coming up in two weeks, don't you--a three months' furlough? Where were you going?\"  \"I thought I'd visit the Southwest. Get in some mountain climbing, see the canyons and Indian ruins and--\"  \"Yes, yes. Very well. You'll get your ticket as usual and a reservation at the Tycho Hotel in Phoenix. You'll go there and, on your first evening, retire early. Alone, I need hardly add. We'll be waiting for you in your room. There'll be a very carefully prepared duplicate--surgical disguise, plastic fingerprinting tips, fully educated in your habits, tastes, and mannerisms. He'll stay behind and carry out your vacation while we smuggle you away. A similar exchange will be affected when you return, you'll be told exactly how your double spent the summer, and you'll resume your ordinary life.\"  \"Ummm--well--\" It was too sudden. Lancaster had to hedge. \"But look--I'll be supposedly coming back from an outdoor vacation, with a suntan and well rested. Somebody's going to get suspicious.\"  \"There'll be sun lamps where you're going, my friend. And I think the chance to work independently on something that really interests you will prove every bit as restful to your nerves as a summer's travel. I know the scientific mentality.\" Berg chuckled. \"Yes, indeed.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The exchange went off so smoothly that it was robbed of all melodrama, though Lancaster had an unexpectedly eerie moment when he confronted his double. It was his own face that looked at him, there in the impersonal hotel room, himself framed against blowing curtains and darkness of night. Then Berg gestured him to follow and they went down a cord ladder hanging from the window sill. A car waited in the alley below and slid into easy motion the instant they had gotten inside.  There was a driver and another man in the front seat, both shadows against the moving blur of street lamps and night. Berg and Lancaster sat in the rear, and the secret agent chatted all the way. But he said nothing of informational content.  When the highway had taken them well into the loneliness of the desert, the car turned off it, bumped along a miserable dirt track until it had crossed a ridge, and slowed before a giant transcontinental dieselectric truck. A man emerged from its cab, waving an unhurried arm, and the car swung around to the rear of the van. There was a tailgate lowered, forming a ramp; above it, the huge double doors opened on a cavern of blackness. The car slid up the ramp, and the man outside pushed it in after them and closed the doors. Presently the truck got into motion.  \"This is _really_ secret!\" whistled Lancaster. He felt awed and helpless.  \"Quite so. Security doesn't like the government's right hand to know what its left is doing.\" Berg smiled, a dim flash of teeth in his shadowy face. Then he was serious. \"It's necessary, Lancaster. You don't know how strong and well-organized the subversives are.\"  \"They--\" The physicist closed his mouth. It was true--he hadn't the faintest notion, really. He followed the news, but in a cursory fashion, without troubling to analyze the meaning of it. Damn it all, he had enough else to think about. Just as well that elections had been suspended and bade fair to continue indefinitely in abeyance. If he, a member of the intelligentsia, wasn't sufficiently acquainted with the political and military facts of life to make rational decisions, it certainly behooved the ill-educated masses to obey.  \"We might as well stretch ourselves,\" said the driver. \"Long way to go yet.\" He climbed out and switched on an overhead light.         *       *       *       *       *  The interior of the van was roomy, even allowing for the car. There were bunks, a table and chairs, a small refrigerator and cookstove. The driver, a lean saturnine man who seemed to be forever chewing gum, began to prepare coffee. The other sat down, whistling tunelessly. He was young and powerfully built, but his right arm ended in a prosthetic claw. All of them were dressed in inconspicuous civilian garb.  \"Take us about ten hours, maybe,\" said Berg. \"The spaceship's 'way over in Colorado.\"  He caught Lancaster's blank stare, and grinned. \"Yes, my friend, your lab is out in space. Surprised?\"  \"Mmm--yeah. I've never been off Earth.\"  \"Sokay. We run at acceleration, you won't be spacesick.\" Berg drew up a chair, sat down, and tilted it back against a wall. The steady rumble of engines pulsed under his words:  \"It's interesting, really, to consider the relationship between government and military technology. The powerful, authoritarian governments have always arisen in such times as the evolution of warfare made a successful fighting machine something elaborate, expensive, and maintainable by professionals only. Like in the Roman Empire. It took years to train a legionnaire and a lot of money to equip an army and keep it in the field. So Rome became autarchic. However, it was not so expensive a proposition that a rebellious general couldn't put some troops up for a while--or he could pay them with plunder. So you did get civil wars. Later, when the Empire had broken up and warfare relied largely on the individual barbarian who brought his own weapons with him, government loosened. It had to--any ruler who got to throwing his weight around too much would have insurrection on his hands. Then as war again became an art--well, you see how it goes. There are other factors, of course, like religion--ideology in general. But by and large, it's worked out the way I explained it. Because there are always people willing to fight when government encroaches on what they consider their liberties, and governments are always going to try to encroach. So the balance struck depends on comparative strength. The American colonists back in 1776 relied on citizen levies and weapons were so cheap and simple that almost anyone could obtain them. Therefore government stayed loose for a long time. But nowadays, who except a government can make atomic bombs and space rockets? So we get absolute states.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lancaster looked around, feeling the loneliness close in on him. The driver was still clattering the coffee pot. The one-armed man was utterly blank and expressionless. And Berg sat there, smiling, pouring out those damnable cynicisms. Was it some kind of test? Were they probing his loyalty? What kind of reply was expected?  \"We're a democratic nation and you know it,\" he said. It came out more feebly than he had thought.  \"Oh, well, sure. This is just a state of emergency which has lasted unusually long, seventy-two years to be exact. If we hadn't lost World War III, and needed a powerful remilitarization to overthrow the Soviet world--but we did.\" Berg took out a pack of cigarettes. \"Smoke? I was just trying to explain to you why the subversives are so dangerous. They have to be, or they wouldn't stand any kind of chance. When you set out to upset something as big as the United States government, it's an all or nothing proposition. They've had a long time now to organize, and there's a huge percentage of malcontents to help them out.\"  \"Malcontents? Well, look, Berg--I mean, you're the expert and of course you know your business, but a natural human grumble at conditions doesn't mean revolutionary sentiments. These aren't such bad times. People have work, and their needs are supplied. They aren't hankering to have the Hemispheric Wars back again.\"  \"The standard revolutionary argument,\" said Berg patiently, \"is that the rebels aren't trying to overthrow the nation at all, but simply to restore constitutional and libertarian government. It's common knowledge that they have help and some subsidies from outside, but it's contended that these are merely countries tired of a world dominated by an American dictatorship and, being small Latin-American and European states, couldn't possibly think of conquering us. Surely you've seen subversive literature.\"  \"Well, yes. Can't help finding their pamphlets. All over the place. And--\" Lancaster closed his mouth. No, damned if he was going to admit that he knew three co-workers who listened to rebel propaganda broadcasts. Those were silly, harmless kids--why get them in trouble, maybe get them sent to camp?         *       *       *       *       *  \"You probably don't appreciate the hold that kind of argument has on all too many intellectuals--and a lot of the common herd, too,\" said Berg. \"Naturally you wouldn't--if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22239"],["title","Security (#2)"],["body","attitude has always been unsympathetic, these people aren't going to confide their thoughts to you. And then there are bought men, and spies smuggled in, and--oh, I needn't elaborate. It's enough to say that we've been thoroughly infiltrated, and that most of their agents have absolutely impeccable dossiers. We can't give neoscop to everybody, you know--Security has to rely on spot checks and the testing of key personnel. Only when organizations get as big as they are today, there's apt to be no real key man, and a few spies strategically placed in the lower echelons can pick-up a hell of a lot of information. Then there are the colonists out on the planets--our hold on them has always necessarily been loose, because of transportation and communication difficulties if nothing else. And, as I say, foreign powers. A little country like Switzerland or Denmark or Venezuela can't do much by itself, but an undercover international pooling of resources.... Anyway, we have reason to believe in the existence of a large, well financed, well organized underground, with trained fighting men, big secret weapons dumps, and saboteurs ready for the word 'go'--to say nothing of a restless population and any number of covert sympathizers who'd follow if the initial uprising had good results.\"  \"Or bad, depending on whose viewpoint you take,\" grinned the one-armed man.  Lancaster put his elbows on his knees and rested his forehead on shaking hands. \"What has all this got to do with me?\" he protested. \"I'm not the hero of some cloak-and-dagger spy story. I'm no good at undercover stuff--what do you want of me?\"  \"It's very simple,\" Berg replied quietly. \"The balance of power is still with the government, because it does have more of the really heavy weapons than any other group can possibly muster. Alphabet bombs, artillery, rockets, armor, spaceships and space missiles. You see? Only research has lately suggested that a new era in warfare is developing--a new weapon as decisive as the Macedonian phalanx, gunpowder, and aircraft were in their day.\" As Lancaster raised his eyes, he met an almost febrile glitter in Berg's gaze. \"And _this_ weapon may reverse the trend. It may be the cheap and simple arm that anyone can make and use--the equalizer! So we've got to develop it before the rebels do. They have laboratories of their own, and their skill at stealing our secrets makes it impossible for us to trust the research to a Project in the usual manner. The fewer who knew of this weapon, the better--because in the wrong hands it could mean--Armageddon!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The run from Earth was short, for the space laboratory wasn't far away at the moment as interplanetary distances go. Lancaster wasn't told anything about its orbit, but guessed that it had a path a million miles or so sunward from Earth and highly tilted with respect to the ecliptic. That made for almost perfect concealment, for what spaceship would normally go much north or south of the region containing the planets?  He was too preoccupied during the journey to estimate orbital figures, anyway. He had seen enough pictures of open space, and some of them had been excellent. But the reality towered unbelievably over all representations. There simply is no way of describing that naked grandeur, and when you have once experienced it you don't want to try. His companions--Berg and the one-armed Jessup, who piloted the spaceboat--respected his need for silence.  The station had been painted non-reflecting black, which complicated temperature control but made accidental observation of its existence almost impossible. It loomed against the cold glory of stars like a pit of ultimate darkness, and Jessup had to guide the boat in with radar. When the last lock had clanged shut behind him and he stood in a narrow metal corridor, shut away from the sky, Lancaster felt a sense of unendurable loss.  It faded, and he grew aware of others watching him. There were half a dozen people, a motley group dressed in any shabby garment they happened to fancy, with no sign of the semi-military discipline of a Project crew. A Martian hovered in the background, and Lancaster didn't notice him at first. Berg introduced the humans casually. There was a stocky gray-haired man named Friedrichs, a lanky space-tanned young chap called Isaacson, a middle-aged woman and her husband by the name of Dufrere, a quiet Oriental who answered to Hwang, and a red-haired woman presented as Karen Marek. These, Berg explained, were the technicians who would be helping Lancaster. This end of the space station was devoted to the labs and factories; for security reasons, Lancaster couldn't be permitted to go elsewhere, but it was hoped he would be comfortable here.  \"Ummm--pardon me, aren't you a rather mixed group?\" asked the physicist.  \"Yes, very,\" said Berg cheerfully. \"The Dufreres are French, Hwang is Chinese, and Karen here is Norwegian though her husband was Czech. Not to mention.... There you are, I didn't see you before! Dr. Lancaster, I'd like you to meet Rakkan of Thyle, Mars, a very accomplished labman.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Lancaster gulped, shifting his feet and looking awkwardly at the small gray-feathered body and the beaked owl-face. Rakkan bowed politely, sparing Lancaster the decision of whether or not to shake the clawlike hand. He assumed Rakkan was somebody's slave--but since when did slaves act as social equals?  \"But you said this project was top secret!\" he blurted.  \"Oh, it is,\" smiled Karen Marek. She had a husky, pleasant voice, and while she was a little too thin to be really good-looking, she was cast in a fine mold and her eyes were large and gray and lovely. \"I assure you, non-Americans are perfectly capable of preserving a secret. More so than most Americans, really--we don't have ties on Earth. No one to blab to.\"  \"It's not well known today, but the original Manhattan Project that constructed the first atomic bombs had quite an international character,\" said Berg. \"It even included German, Italian, and Hungarian elements though the United States was at war with those countries.\"  \"Come along and we'll get you settled in your quarters,\" invited Isaacson.  Lancaster followed him down the long hallways, rather dazed with the whole business. He noticed that the space station had a crude, unfinished look, as if it had been hastily thrown together from whatever materials were available. That didn't ring true for a government enterprise, no matter how secret.  Berg seemed to read his thought again. \"We've worked under severe handicaps,\" he said. \"Look, just suppose a lot of valuable material and equipment were ferried into space. If it's an ordinary government deal, you know how many light-years of red tape are involved. Requisitions have to be filled out in triplicate, every last rivet has to be accounted for--there'd simply have been too much chance of a rebel spy getting a lead on us. It was safer all around to use whatever chance materials could be obtained from salvage or through individual purchases on other planets. Ever hear of the _Waikiki_?\"  \"Ummm--seems so--wasn't she the big freighter that disappeared many years ago?\"  \"That's the one. A meteor swarm struck her on the way to Venus. Furthermore, one of them shorted out her engine controls, so that she swooped out of the ecliptic plane and fell into an eccentric skew orbit. When this project was first started, one of our astronomers thought he'd identified the swarm--it has a regular path of its own about the sun, though the orbit is so cockeyed that spaceships hardly ever even see the things. Anyway, knowing the orbit of the meteors and that of the _Waikiki_ at the time, he could calculate where the disaster must have taken place--which gave us a lead in searching for the hulk. We found it after a lot of investigation, moved it here, and built the station up around it. Very handy. And completely secret.\"  Lancaster had always suspected that Security was a little mad. Now he knew it. Oh, well--         *       *       *       *       *  His room was small and austere, but privacy was nice. The lab crew ate in a common refectory. Beyond the edge of their territory, great bulkheads blocked off three-fourths of the space station. Lancaster was sure that many people and several Martians lived there, for in the days that followed he saw any number of strangers appearing and disappearing in the region allowed him. Most of these were workmen of some kind or other, called in to help the lab crew as needed, but all of them were tight-lipped. They must have been cautioned not to speak to the guest more than was strictly necessary.  Living was Spartan in the station. It rotated fast enough to give weight, but even on the outer skin that was only one-half Earth gravity. A couple of silent Martians prepared undistinguished meals and did housework in the quarters. There were no films or other organized recreation, though Lancaster was told that the forbidden sector included a good-sized room for athletics.  But the crew he worked with didn't seem to mind. They had their own large collections of books and music wires, which they borrowed from each other. They played chess and poker with savage skill. Conversation was, at first, somewhat restrained in Lancaster's presence, and most of the humor had so little reference to things he knew that he couldn't follow it, but he became aware that they talked with more animation and intelligence than his friends on Earth. Manners were utterly informal, and it wasn't long before even Lancaster was being addressed by his first name; but cooperation was smooth and there seemed to be none of the intrigue and backbiting of a typical Project crew.  And the work filled their lives. Lancaster was caught up in it the \"day\" after his arrival, realized at once what it meant, and was plunged into the fascination of it. Berg hadn't lied; this was big!  The"]]]
