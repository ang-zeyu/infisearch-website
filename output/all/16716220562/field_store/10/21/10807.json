My dear Lucy, you little know what might have happened but for your mother's pluck and bravery.\"  \"I know,\" said Lucy, softened on the spot. \"But if she only wouldn't--wouldn't make so free with them when they come, and if there might be a little order, and if they could have been postponed till the resident governesses had arrived. But now they are there, all of them, as merry and jocular as you like, running about the place, racing here and there, and devouring all our best fruit, tramping in and out of the greenhouses and conservatory, and making such a noise just over your study. It would be much better to give up Sunnyside--anything would be better than this.\"  \"I don't think so, and you will find after a time that you will like your school friends. Your education will be finished without any extra cost whatever. We are being very well paid for these girls, we know they are all ladies, and your mother will be happy and in her element. How could you turn your dear mother into a precise, stately woman? It isn't in her, and you would not wish it to be.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Lucy. \"I think I would. But, father, you always make me ashamed of myself. You, who suffer so much, are so good, so patient.\"  \"If I am good and patient it is because of my dear wife and my dear daughter,\" said the man sadly. \"And now, Lucy darling, go back to them all and try to help your mother. The governesses will come to-morrow, and the day after lessons will begin. In a week's time you will see perfect order arising out of chaos, and you will be surprised at your present feelings.\"  Lucy raised her father's hand to her lips. She loved her mother, but she adored him, with his slight stoop, his scholarly face, his gentle smile, his kindly eyes. There were few men more beloved than Professor Merriman. He had given some really great books to the world, and was a scholar in the truest and best sense of the word. When he instructed Lucy, which he did now and then, she regarded those moments as the happiest and most sacred of her life.  \"Well, whatever happens, I have got him,\" she thought as she turned to go back to the house. \"And if it adds any years to his precious life, surely I can endure anything. But I do hope he won't get to like any of those girls. Perhaps he will. Perhaps he will even offer to teach some of them. I sincerely trust none of them are clever. Oh, who is this queer little creature coming to meet me?\"  The queer little creature in question, dressed in brown holland, with a small brown hat and cotton gloves, was no other than Phyllis Flower. She ran up to Lucy, and stood in front of her, and said, \"Is your father really the great Professor Ralph Merriman?\"  \"Yes,\" said Lucy, coloring and smiling, for it was delightful to her to hear the appreciative tone in Phyllis's voice.  \"I thought so, but I was not quite sure. Agnes Sparkes and I were arguing about it. Agnes said it couldn't be, but I said it was. I am very glad. I hope we shall see him sometimes.\"  \"He is not well,\" said Lucy. \"He can't be disturbed.\"  \"We would none of us dream of disturbing him; but we would love to look at him sometimes, and perhaps sometimes to hear him speak.\"  \"I dare say you will see him. When he is well enough he will dine with us,\" said Lucy. \"But you must not expect\"----  \"Oh, we expect nothing--nothing certainly from you,\" said Phyllis Flower, flushing angrily, for there was a tone in Lucy's voice which she could scarcely stand. Then she, continued, \"Why are you determined not to be nice to us, Miss Merriman?\"  \"You had better call me Lucy,\" said the girl after a pause. \"We are all girls together. You are at school and I am at school.\"  \"How old are you, Lucy?\"  \"I am fifteen.\"  \"And I am thirteen and a half. How old do you think I look?\"  \"Oh, any age. You are so thin.\"  \"And wizened,\" laughed Phyllis. \"Well, never mind. I dare say I shall grow tall enough by-and-by. Now, my dear,\" she continued after a pause, \"you have nothing whatever to be jealous of in me. I am not clever, I am not good-looking; in short, I am nothing at all, just the most ordinary person. But I can tell you something about the characters of your other school-fellows if you like. Would you care? There is plenty of time. Shall we walk up and down for a little?\"  Lucy could not resist the temptation. Phyllis, who was quite as frank and free as Mrs. Merriman herself, laid her hand on Lucy's arm. Lucy shuddered, but submitted.  \"The person who has got the greatest character among us is Rosamund Cunliffe. She will rule us all.\"  \"She won't rule me,\" interrupted Lucy angrily.  \"You can't help it, my dear. She has always ruled every one with whom she comes in contact; and she does it quite nicely, too, for she isn't unamiable. She simply has a strong character.\"  \"I hardly know what she is like,\" said Lucy.  \"Oh, you must have observed her--that tall, dark, pretty-looking girl, with rosy cheeks and a pretty mouth.\"  \"Yes, I think I know whom you mean.\"  \"And she is clever, too. But I don't think it is her beauty or her talent that makes her curious charm. It is something beyond all this. I never saw her do a really unamiable thing, and yet I think she must love power very much. You will soon find out for yourself what she is like. As for Janey Denton, she is just a good sort, something like me. And Laura Everett is very proud of her family, and she is clever. And Annie Millar is Laura's shadow, and does nothing whatever except what Laura wishes. Then there is Agnes Sparkes. She is supposed to be my friend, and she is very pretty, fair, and lively and clever. But of all the girls who have come here to-day the two who will make their mark in the world are beyond doubt Rosamund Cunliffe and Laura Everett. Now, I think I will let you find out the rest for yourself.\"     CHAPTER II.  ROSAMUND TAKES THE LEAD.   Before that day had come to an end, Lucy had discovered how true were Phyllis Flower's words. For Rosamund Cunliffe, without making herself in the least disagreeable, without saying one single rude thing, yet managed to take the lead, and that so effectively that even Lucy herself found that she could not help following in her train.  For instance, after dinner, when the girls--all of them rather tired, and perhaps some of them a little cross, and no one exactly knowing what to do--clustered about the open drawing-room windows, it was Rosamund who proposed that the rugs should be rolled back and that they should have a dance.  Lucy opened her eyes. Nobody before had ever dared to make such a suggestion in the house of Sunnyside. Lucy, it is true, had dancing lessons from a master who came once a week to instruct her and other girls in the winter season, and she had occasionally gone to a children's party. But beyond that she had never danced, looking forward to it, however, as a possible recreation by-and-by.  Rosamund's clear voice was now heard.  \"Let us push back the sofas. This is a splendid room. We can roll up the rugs in a twinkling. Where is Mrs. Merriman? She will play the dance music. Oh, there are seven of us--one too many. Perhaps you will play for us, Lucy?\"  \"But I don't know any dance music,\" said Lucy; \"and then mother would not like the rugs being disturbed. The room is arranged just as father and mother wish it to be. I think perhaps\"----  She colored painfully.  \"We will do nothing without leave, of course,\" said Phyllis Flower. \"I'll just run and find Mrs. Merriman and ask her.\"  Before Lucy could prevent her, Phyllis had darted out of the room, returning in a minute or two with the required permission.  \"It's all right, girls,\" she said; \"we can trip it on the light fantastic toe as long as ever we please, and the rugs may go to Hong-kong for all Mrs. Merriman cares.\"  Lucy colored with rage. Rosamund gave a quiet smile--a smile which seemed to denote power. Phyllis's dancing eyes lit for a moment on Lucy's face. Those eyes said in the most provoking manner, \"I told you so.\" And then some one went to the piano, and a minute or two later all the girls, Lucy included, were dancing round and round the room in the merry waltz.  Even Lucy enjoyed it when once it had begun, and the little performer at the piano played well, and kept excellent time. And by-and-by Lucy forgot herself, and could not help laughing when Rosamund seized her round the waist and whirled her round and round, and taught her to reverse, and instructed her in one or two other matters unknown to Lucy up to the present.  The dance lasted for over an hour; and just in the midst of it, when Lucy was really laughing in quite a heart-whole manner, she raised her eyes and saw no less a person than Mr. Merriman himself standing in the doorway. He was smiling, and his eyes were fixed on Rosamund's face.  The moment Rosamund saw him she stopped at once, and said to Lucy, \"Is that your father, the great professor?\"  \"Yes,\" said Lucy.  \"Please introduce him to me.\"  Lucy longed to say, \"It will tire him; I can't do it.\" She longed to give any sort of excuse, but none would come to her lips. She was forced to take Rosamund up to Mr. Merriman.  \"This is Rosamund Cunliffe,\" she said, \"and she wants to know you, father.\"  \"I am very much pleased to see you, Miss Cunliffe,\" said Mr. Merriman; and then Rosamund stood in the doorway and talked.  Lucy went back and tried to dance with another girl, and the dance music still went on. But she could not help straining her ears and trying to catch the subject of Rosamund's conversation. Why, she was absolutely laughing, and the Professor, who was generally so grave and quiet, was laughing also. What did it all mean?  \"Father, aren't you tired?--Miss Cunliffe, you are tiring father,\" said Lucy at last, running up to the door and trying to speak calmly.  \"No, my dear,\" said her father. \"On the contrary, I am intensely interested.--You must tell me that story again, Miss Cunliffe. Would you like to come and see my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22164"],["title","A Modern Tomboy: A Story for Girls (#2)"],["body","rary?\"  The two went off together, and Lucy felt almost as though she must burst into tears. Phyllis's eyes again met her face, and she had to restrain her feelings. The \"I told you so\" look was too maddening almost for endurance.  Rosamund's love of power showed itself further in the arrangement of her bedroom. She took down the dividing curtain between herself and Jane Denton without asking any one's permission; and she slept in the bed intended for Jane, and rearranged the drawers, putting them into another part of the room; and complained about the wardrobe, saying that she would like it put opposite the door instead of in its present position. And whatever she wished was immediately done, and whatever she said was said so politely that no one took offense. And Lucy had to confess to herself that Phyllis was right, and that Rosamund would be a power--the leading power--in the school.  Early the next day the two teachers arrived. Mademoiselle Omont was very French in appearance, very dark, with sparkling black eyes and neatly arranged soft dark hair. She had a truly Parisian accent, and a pretty, graceful way about her. Miss Archer was a stolid-looking woman of about five-and-thirty years of age. She had a long talk, on her arrival, with Mrs. Merriman, and then she went to her room and stayed there for some little time, so that it was not until tea-time that the girls and the two resident governesses met.  Lucy looked with great approbation at Miss Archer when she took her seat opposite the tea-tray.  \"She will bring order into this chaos,\" thought the girl. \"She will force all these girls to behave properly. She will insist on order. I see it in her face.\"  But as the thought passed through Lucy's mind, Rosamund jumped suddenly up from her own place, requested Phyllis Flower to change with her, and sat down close to Miss Archer. During tea she talked to the English governess in a low tone, asking her a great many questions, and evidently impressing her very much in her favor.  \"Oh, dear!\" thought Lucy, \"if this sort of thing goes on I shall lose my senses. If there is to be any order, if the whole scheme which mother has thought out so carefully, and father has approved of, means to establish a girl like Rosamund Cunliffe here as our leader, so that we are forced to do every single thing she wishes, I shall beg and implore of father and mother to let me go and live with Aunt Susan in the old Rectory at Dartford.\"  Lucy's cheeks were flushed, and she could scarcely keep the tears back from her eyes. After tea, however, as she was walking about in front of the house, wondering if she should ever know a happy moment again, Miss Archer made her appearance. When she saw Lucy she called her at once to her side.  \"What a nice girl Rosamund Cunliffe seems!\" was her first remark.  \"Oh! don't begin by praising her,\" said Lucy. \"I don't think I can quite stand it.\"  \"What is the matter, my dear? You are little Lucy Merriman, are you not--the daughter of Mrs. Merriman and the Professor?\"  \"I am.\"  \"And this house has always been your home?\"  \"I was born here,\" said Lucy almost tearfully.  \"Then, of course, you feel rather strange at first with all these girls scattered about the place. But when lessons really begin, and you get into working order, you will be different. You will have to take your place with the others in class, and everything is to be conducted as though it were a real school.\"  \"I will do anything you wish,\" said Lucy, and she turned a white face, almost of despair, towards Miss Archer. \"I will do anything in all the world you wish if you will promise me one thing.\"  Miss Archer felt inclined to say, \"What possible reason have you to expect that I should promise you anything?\" but she knew human nature, and guessed that Lucy was troubled.  \"Tell me what you wish,\" she said.  \"I want you not to make a favorite of Rosamund Cunliffe. Already she has begun to upset everything--last night all the drawing-room arrangements, her own bedroom afterwards; then, to-day, the other girls have done nothing but obey her. If this goes on, how is order to be maintained?\"  Miss Archer looked thoughtful.  \"From the little I have seen of Rosamund, she seems to be a very amiable and clever girl,\" she said. \"She evidently has a great deal of strength of character, and cannot help coming to the front. We must be patient with her, Lucy.\"  Lucy felt a greater ache than ever at her heart. She was certain that Miss Archer was already captivated by Rosamund's charms. What was she to do? To whom was she to appeal? It would be quite useless to speak to her mother, for her mother had already fallen in love with Rosamund; and indeed she had with all the young girls who had arrived such a short time ago. Mrs. Merriman was one of the most affectionate people on earth. She had the power of taking an unlimited number of girls, and boys, too, into her capacious heart. She could be spent for them, and live for them, and never once give a thought to herself. Now, in addition to the pleasure of having so many young people in the house, she knew she was helping her husband and relieving his mind from weighty cares. The Professor could, therefore, go on with the writing of his great work on Greek anthology; even if the money for this unique treatise came in slowly, there would be enough to keep the little family from the products of the school. Yes, he should be uninterrupted, and should proceed at his leisure, and give up the articles which were simply wearing him into an early grave.  Lucy knew, therefore, that no sympathy could be expected from her mother. It is true that her father might possibly understand; but then, dared she worry him? He had been looking very pale of late. His health was seriously undermined, and the doctors had spoken gravely of his case. He must be relieved. He must have less tension, otherwise the results would be attended with danger. And Lucy loved him, as she also loved her mother, with all her heart and soul.  When Miss Archer left her, having nothing particular to do herself and being most anxious to avoid the strange girls, she went up the avenue, and passing through a wicket-gate near the entrance, walked along by the side of a narrow stream where all sorts of wild flowers were always growing. Here might be seen the blue forget-me-not, the meadow-sweet, great branches of wild honeysuckle, dog-roses, and many other flowers too numerous to mention. As a rule, Lucy loved flowers, as most country girls do; but she had neither eyes nor ears for them to-day. She was thinking of her companions, and how she was to tolerate them. And as she walked she saw in a bend in the road, coming to meet her, a stout, elderly, very plainly dressed woman.  Lucy stood still for an instant, and then uttered a perfect shout of welcome, and ran into the arms of her aunt Susan.  Mrs. Susan Brett was the wife of a hard-working clergyman in a town about ten miles away. She had no children of her own, and devoted her whole time to helping her husband in his huge parish. She spent little or no money on dress, and was certainly a very plain woman. She had a large, pale face, somewhat flat, with wide nostrils, a long upper lip, small pale-blue eyes, and a somewhat bulgy forehead. Plain she undoubtedly was, but no one who knew her well ever gave her looks a thought, so genial was her smile, so hearty her hand-clasp, so sympathetic her words. She was beloved by her husband's parishioners, and in especial she was loved by Lucy Merriman, who had a sort of fascination in watching her and in wondering at her.  From time to time Lucy had visited the Bretts in their small Rectory in the town of Dartford. Nobody in all the world could be more welcome to the child in her present mood than her aunt Susan, and she ran forward with outstretched arms.  \"Oh, Aunt Susy, I am glad to see you! But what has brought you to-day?\"  \"Why, this, my dear,\" said Mrs. Brett. \"I just had three hours to spare while William was busy over his sermon for next Sunday. He is writing a new sermon--he hasn't done that for quite six months--and he said he wanted the house to himself, and no excuse for any one to come in. And he just asked me if I'd like to have a peep into the country; that always means a visit to Sunnyside. So I said I'd look up the trains, and of course there was one just convenient, so I clapped on my hat--you don't mind it being my oldest one--and here I am.\"  \"Oh, I am so glad!\" said Lucy. \"I think I wanted you, Aunt Susan, more than any one else in all the world.\"  She tucked her hand through her aunt's arm as she spoke, and they turned and walked slowly along by the riverside.  Mrs. Brett, if she had a plain face, had by no means a correspondingly plain soul. On the contrary, it was attuned to the best, the richest, the highest in God's world. She could see the loveliness of trees, of river, of flowers. She could listen to the song of the wild birds, and thank her Maker that she was born into so good a world. Nothing rested her, as she expressed it, like a visit into the country. Nothing made the dreadful things she had often to encounter in town seem more endurable than the sweet-peas, the roses, the green trees, the green grass, the fragrance and perfume of the country; and when she saw her little niece--for she was very fond of Lucy--looking discontented and unhappy, Mrs. Brett at once perceived a reason for her unexpected visit to Sunnyside.  \"We needn't go too fast, need we?\" she said. \"If we go down this path, and note the flowers--aren't the flowers lovely, Lucy?\"----  \"Yes,\" replied Lucy.  \"We shall be in time for tea, shall we not? But tell me, how is your father, dear? I see you are in trouble of some sort. Is he worse?\"  \"No, Aunt Susy; I think he is better. He has had better nights of late, and mother is not so anxious about him.\"  \"Then what is the worry, my love, for worry of some sort there doubtless is?\"  \"It is the girls, Aunt Susy.\" "]]]
