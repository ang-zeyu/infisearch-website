The line, made of linen sheets, still was taut, and Ross, peering out of the window, saw to his great delight that the boat was still there with all its passengers safe, Rex, Lassie, and the puppies.  A lurch almost threw Ross upon his face and the whole house swayed as though with a violent earthquake. The next instant, a sense of motion beneath them told the boys that the house was afloat.  \"The house has gone, the house has gone! What are we going to do?\" cried the crippled boy.  \"That's all right, Anton,\" the older lad said consolingly, \"things aren't so bad. See, it's beginning to get daylight.\"  \"But,\" said the younger boy, \"the house is floating down to Pirate's Cave, that gully where the big rocks are. If we run up against those, the house'll be smashed to bits, sure.\"  Ross thought for a moment and saw that his chum was right.  \"Guess we'll have to take to the boat after all, Anton,\" he said, \"it's a good thing the house got on a level keel again, when she came afloat.\"  Action was needed and that immediately. Ross climbed half-way through the window.  \"I've got to get that boat up here in a hurry,\" he said, \"the current's swift enough, when you're in that small boat, but this house doesn't float down so fast. It's a mile, anyway, to the gully.\"  So saying, he swung himself out of the window, went down the linen rope and dropped into the water. Hand over hand, again, up the rope came the boat until once more it was under the window. Meanwhile, by heroic exertions, Anton had swung himself up on the window-sill. As the boat came beneath him, the crippled lad swung out on the rope and proceeded to climb down into the boat.  He was not a moment too soon. While Ross had been bringing the boat to place, the speed of the current had increased and the house, like a clumsy Noah's Ark, began to sweep swiftly towards the gully of which Anton had spoken.  \"Quick, Anton,\" said Ross, as the smaller lad hesitated, \"we've got to be quick.\"  He cut the boat loose.  In spite of his blunt words, it was with the greatest gentleness that Ross handed the lad to a seat in the rough craft where they had played pirates during the preceding summer, and settled down to his oars.  Lassie, finding her master safe in the boat, came and laid her head on his knee, while the shore went slipping by. Here and there a barn still stood, the tops of the trees showed above the flood, but all the ground was hidden and the torrent was running like a mill-race. Little by little, Ross edged the boat towards the shore, not trying to stem the current but rowing diagonally across it. Only a few hundred yards separated the house from the gorge which the boys knew as Pirates Cave. By this time the boat had reached the higher portion of the hollow, where the current slackened. A few strong strokes of the oars and the boat grounded, safely.  At that instant the slight lightening of the rain-filled skies showed that, behind the clouds, the sun had risen. The boys turned to look at the house which had been Anton's refuge, and which so nearly had been his tomb. As they looked, the structure struck against the uppermost of the rocks with a crash and collapsed as though made of matchwood, while, a second after, into the medley of boards and timbers some uprooted trees came crashing.  \"You wouldn't have stood much chance there, Anton,\" said Ross.  The crippled lad put his hand on the older boy's shoulder, with as close an approach to a gesture of affection as boy nature would permit.  \"I guess I'd have been a goner,\" he answered, \"but for you.\"     CHAPTER II  THE HOME OF THE RAIN   The gray morning broke over the desolate scene, and Anton, hollow-eyed and exhausted, looked at the muddy waters rushing savagely over the place where his home had stood. By the tops of the trees, only, was he able to trace the outline of the fields he had known all his boyhood.  \"Do you suppose it'll ever dry up, Ross?\" he asked.  \"Of course it will, Anton,\" the older lad said, reassuringly, \"you'll see. In a week or two all this water'll run off and you'll forget that the old place ever looked like this.\"  The crippled lad shook his head, as though in doubt.  \"My books have gone,\" he said mournfully.  The tones were quiet, but a tragedy lay beneath the words, and no one knew better than Ross how largely his chum's life lay in the world revealed in his tiny library. The flood would pass away and the fertility of summer would hide every trace of the disaster, but for Anton's loss there was no such swift remedy. His books were his closest friends, and now, at one stroke, he was bereft of all of them.  \"Come,\" said Ross, to change the current of his chum's thoughts, \"we'll have to make a start. Where do you suppose your folks are?\"  The younger lad turned to his friend with the quick responsiveness and willing resignation often found among those who have suffered a great deal or who are handicapped in Life's race.  \"I haven't the least idea,\" he said, \"they might have gone over to the other shore.\"  \"Yes,\" agreed Ross, thoughtfully, \"that's likely. They'd certainly have more chance of finding help and grub over there. And, talking of grub, Anton, aren't you hungry?\"  \"Starving,\" admitted the younger lad.  \"Then I tell you what, we'd better go and hunt up Levin.\"  \"The chap who used to be with the Weather Bureau, you mean?\" Anton asked.  \"Yes.\"  \"Don't you think that I ought to try to find Father first?\" queried the younger lad, hesitatingly. \"He might be worrying.\"  \"It's because of your folks that I think we ought to go first to the camp,\" explained Ross. \"We couldn't possibly row right across the flood to the other shore. We've had trouble enough getting as far as this. Besides, Anton, even if we did get over, we wouldn't know where to look for your people. There's a chance that Levin may have heard from them, and if he hasn't, he might send some one with a message. We couldn't do much searching, anyway.\"  In truth, the boys were utterly exhausted. The only member of the party who seemed in high spirits was Rex. He frisked about and jumped on the two boys, his tail sticking straight up in the air, as though he were convinced that it was solely through his exertions that Lassie and the puppies had been rescued.  Ross slung the basket, with its living freight, across his shoulders and started off. Lassie watched this elevation of her children with manifest uneasiness, but as her master seemed satisfied, there was nothing for her to do but to follow behind, which she did with her nose as close to the basket as possible.  Nerve-frazzled and tired out, Anton pegged away behind. The heavy downpour of rain, which had not ceased for a day and a night, and which had followed upon the heavy rains of the week before, had made the ground as soft as a bog. The crippled lad's crutch sank in so deeply at every step that it was only with great pain that he could keep up at all. Still, he struggled along bravely.  Ross, turning to see how his chum was faring, caught the boy's tense and haggard look, and understood.  \"Look here, Anton,\" he said, at once, \"we'll never get anywhere this way. You get into the boat and I'll tow you.\"  \"But you can't, you're just about all in,\" protested the younger boy. \"You can't tow the boat with me in it, all the way.\"  \"Got to!\" declared Ross abruptly. \"It's a sure thing that you're not able to walk there with the ground in this sodden condition. Anyway, I won't have to carry the puppies.\"  Thankful but still protesting, Anton got into the boat and the journey began anew.  It was a weary way. Ross staggered forward, half-blind with sleep, wading knee-deep, sometimes waist-deep, in the water. The rain had stopped, but the sky was heavy and the clouds hung low. Twice Anton had to jerk on the tow-rope to jolt Ross awake, for, unnoticing, he was heading for deep water. Even near the shore the torrent was full of floating debris. The bodies of horses and cattle drifting down the stream told of many impoverished farms and the flotsam was eloquent of wrecked and demolished houses and indicative of suffering.  When, after an hour's toil, rescuer and rescued reached the drier land that sloped up to the levee, it was hard to tell which was the more exhausted. To the last, however, Ross refused to let his chum bear the burden of the puppies, and he lurched up the road to the place where he had left the gang at work on the cave-in, not so many hours before. It seemed weeks ago.  The Weather Man was still at work. He had been up all night, also, but he greeted the lad cheerily as he came in sight.  \"Hello, Boss!\" he called, then, as the boy's exhausted state became more evident, \"what have you been doing? Has anything happened?\"  \"Anton was marooned,\" answered Ross in the dull, listless voice of extreme fatigue.  \"Marooned? You mean he was caught by the flood?\"  As though in answer, Anton, toiling heavily and wearily on his crutch, came in sight.  \"Yes,\" said Ross, in the same tone, \"he was left behind.\"  \"How was that?\" the Weather Man asked sharply.  \"It wasn't anybody's fault, Mr. Levin,\" replied Anton, who had heard the last two sentences as he came up, \"Father thought I'd gone with Uncle Jack, and Uncle Jack thought I'd gone with Father.\"  \"You're not hurt?\"  \"No, sir,\" the crippled lad answered, \"not a bit. Ross is, though. He cut his arm diving through the window.\"  The Forecaster turned swiftly to the older boy and began examining the injury.  \"Is the house still standing?\" he asked.  \"No, sir,\" the boy answered, \"it's all in bits down by Jackson's Gully.\"  The weather expert nodded. He knew the lay of the land and had expected the water from the flooded hollow to pour down towards the entrance to the gully.  \"How did you get out, then?\" he asked.  Anton burst into a glowing account of his rescue in the little boat which the boys had made for their pirate adventures of two years before. Even the excitement of the story,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22156"],["title","The Boy with the U. S. Weather Men (#5)"],["body"," however, was not strong enough to keep his overtaxed frame from showing signs of a breakdown and the Weather Man cut the story short.  \"I'm going to breakfast later,\" he said curtly, \"but not for a couple of hours. You two had better take a rest now. Here, Sam,\" he called to one of the negroes, \"bring me a bucket of coffee from your camp-kettle, and fetch some corn-pone. Quick now, these boys are famished.\"  \"Yas, suh! Yas, suh!\" came the reply, and, a moment later, a bucket of coffee and some corn-bread and molasses were brought.  Despite their hunger, neither Ross nor Anton could eat more than a few mouthfuls, and the hot drink was the last straw to their sleepiness. Ross fell asleep with an unfinished piece of corn-pone in his hand, and Anton's head was nodding.  \"Ain' no more weight than a babby, Mister Levin,\" said the laborer, as he picked up the little crippled lad and carried him to a tiny open shed near by, which was the only dry spot to be found in the neighborhood.  Very tenderly he laid the boy down on a pile of clothes that had been salvaged while the Forecaster put his overcoat over Ross and laid him beside his chum.  \"There,\" said the Weather Man, \"let them sleep a while. They'll be ready for a real breakfast in a couple of hours.\"  Though hungry himself, the Forecaster waited for three hours before awakening the lads. Anton, by nature a light sleeper, awoke easily and was refreshed, but the awakening of Ross was a real task. He had been on a severe strain for twenty-seven hours and Nature demanded sleep. At last, however, he was roused and after he had plunged his head in a pail of cold water, he felt as full of ginger as ever and ready to start on rescue work all over again.  \"I'm just going to breakfast,\" the Forecaster announced. \"Do you want to go along?\"  \"Do I? I should say I did! But I'm afraid, sir, that Anton and I will eat up everything in sight.\"  \"You don't need to worry about that,\" the Forecaster replied, \"my men have been hauling supplies all night. Why, Ross, there are over two thousand people homeless this morning, right around this district. They've all got to eat breakfast, too, so you see even your best efforts won't seriously decrease the supply.\"  \"I'm not so sure about that, sir,\" Ross said laughing, \"right now I feel as though I could eat all you've gathered for the entire two thousand.\"  \"Come and try, then,\" the Weather Man said, smiling. Then, turning to Anton, he continued, \"Likely enough, some of your people will be at the big tent that's been put up. If they're not there, I'll send out a couple of the boys on horseback to cover both sides of the flooded area and pass the word that you're safe.\" He turned to the older boy. \"I've already sent word to your father, Ross.\"  The boys thanked him and started down the levee. Owing to the continuous work of the night, the cave-in had gradually been filled up, averting a break at this point. The river, turbid and swollen, was swirling by, not more than three feet below the top of the levee.  \"Is the water going down yet, Mr. Levin?\" asked Ross. \"It looks as though the rain were over.\"  \"Yes,\" answered the Forecaster, \"the rain is over, but the water's not going down yet. It's rising. I'm fairly sure that there won't be any more rain for a few days, fortunately, but I heard from Greenville this morning that the river was still rising. We can stand another nine or ten inches, but a foot would be serious. Of course, the break that flooded out Jackson's Hollow, where your place was, Anton, is relieving the pressure a little. We've been lucky here. I haven't heard of any loss of life so far. It's a nasty flood, but when the rainfall last week was reported as being so heavy, I knew we couldn't escape trouble.\"  \"Is it just the rain that makes floods?\" Anton asked.  \"Just rain,\" was the laconic answer.  \"Why is it,\" asked the younger boy, \"that there's more rain one year than another?\"  \"If I could tell you that,\" the old Weather Forecaster replied, \"I'd be the cleverest meteorologist in the world.\"  \"But doesn't anybody know why it rains?\"  \"Certainly, we know why it rains.\"  \"Why, Mr. Levin?\"  The Forecaster pushed back his hat from his forehead and looked quizzically at the white-faced lad.  \"You really want to know why rain comes? Very well, Anton, I'll try to tell you. Stop me, though, if you don't quite understand.  \"The Earth goes whirling about in space, revolving around the Sun, as you know, and it has, like a sort of skin around it, an envelope of air. This air is kept from flying off by the force of gravity. You know what that is?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the cripple answered, \"it's what makes a stone fall to the ground.\"  \"Exactly. Now the air is made up of little particles or molecules, like the stone, only, of course, not so heavy. They're heavy enough, though. How much weight of air do you suppose you're carrying, Anton?\"  The boy looked puzzled.  \"I don't quite see what you mean, sir,\" he answered.  \"Suppose you had a pea on your head, it wouldn't be heavy to carry, would it?\"  \"Why, no,\" answered the lad, laughing.  \"Supposing you had a basket of peas, the basket being only about as big round as your head, but six feet high, that would make quite a load, wouldn't it?\"  \"I don't believe I could carry it,\" was the answer.  \"And if the basket were sixty feet high, as high as a barn?\"  \"I'd be squashed under it.\"  \"And if it were six miles high!\"  \"Why,\" answered Anton, \"a basket six miles high, even if you filled it up with cotton fluff, would weigh tons and tons!\"  \"Well, my boy,\" said the Weather Forecaster, \"you're carrying on the top of your head a column of air, not only six, but sixty miles high, yes, and more than that! You don't notice it, of course, because you're used to it, and your body is made to accommodate itself to that weight by your tissues being full of air at the same pressure. Just the same, not counting the weight which presses on your whole body, amounting to about seventeen tons, you're carrying on your head, at this minute, a weight of over six hundred pounds.\"  \"Six hundred pounds! As much as if I were carrying three heavy men sitting on my head!\"  \"Every bit of it, and more, under certain conditions of the atmosphere. This depends mainly on the circulation of the winds, especially those great movements a thousand miles in diameter known as 'lows' and 'highs' or cyclones and anti-cyclones. In the United States, an anti-cyclone generally means fair weather, and in an anti-cyclone the barometric column rises. That's why a barometer helps to foretell weather some time in advance; it responds to the vast movements of the atmosphere rather than to local conditions.  \"Of course, Anton, at sixty miles up, the air is so thin that it has hardly any weight. Indeed, we wouldn't know there was any air at that height but for the trail that shooting stars leave. A meteor glows because of friction, and in a vacuum there is no friction. Therefore there must be air at the vast heights where shooting stars are first seen.\"  \"Could an aeroplane get up there?\"  The Forecaster shook his head.  \"Never,\" he answered. \"Even six miles up, the air would be too thin to sustain the weight of an aeroplane unless the machine were flying at terrific velocity, and besides, at that height, there wouldn't be enough air for an aviator to breathe. At that, Anton, you can see for yourself that if the air is saturated with water vapor--and the cloud-bearing atmosphere is eight or ten miles thick--there is room for a lot of water.\"  \"It's evaporation that puts water into the air, isn't it, sir?\" asked Ross.  \"Exactly. The sun is shining on some part of the earth all the time. There's never a second, day or night, that water is not being evaporated from the seas, from lakes, from rivers and from the earth itself. All the water that is taken up must fall somewhere, and all the rain that falls means that the atmosphere must fill itself with water vapor again. It's a continuous performance, and the water which is being evaporated into the air falls to the earth, sooner or later, as rain, hail, or snow.\"  \"If it's all so regular,\" said Anton thoughtfully, \"I don't see why we don't get the same amount of rain every day, or at least every season.\"  \"It isn't regular at all,\" the Weather Forecaster explained. \"If climatic conditions were regular, we could forecast the weather several years in advance, instead of only a few days. There are a thousand complicating factors. Land and sea are irregularly divided, and as there is more evaporation from the sea than the land, every little curve in a coast line means a disturbance of regularity. Then, Anton, remember, while the earth is almost a globe it is not perfectly round, so that every variation from the regular curve disturbs the air currents. Moreover, the motions of the earth are very complicated. Sometimes it is nearer the sun than at other times. It wobbles slightly on its axis. It is inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, causing the seasons, and that brings a new set of factors into the problem. A mountain range or a desert will modify the atmosphere, even the difference between a forest and a prairie is noticeable.\"  \"Suppose you could figure all those things out, couldn't you foretell the weather, then?\"  The Forecaster shook his head.  \"Suppose you had a thousand marbles of different colors,\" he said, \"and you dropped them from the top of a house to the hard ground below, a rough and rocky piece of ground, could you ever figure out what kind of a pattern they would make? You might measure the size of the marbles and compute how many times they would strike against each other in falling, meantime figuring the angles of direction that each collision would produce. You might measure the resistance of the ground and the elasticity of the marbles and estimate the manner in which they would bounce after striking the ground and the distance to which they would roll. After you had done all that,"]]]
