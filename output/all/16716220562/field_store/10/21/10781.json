February 1, 1920.     _I.--DEATH_  _I.--Death. A Philosophical Discussion_   _The back parlor of any average American home. The blinds are drawn and a single gas-jet burns feebly. A dim suggestion of festivity: strange chairs, the table pushed back, a decanter and glasses. A heavy, suffocating, discordant scent of flowers--roses, carnations, lilies, gardenias. A general stuffiness and mugginess, as if it were raining outside, which it isn't._  _A door leads into the front parlor. It is open, and through it the flowers may be seen. They are banked about a long black box with huge nickel handles, resting upon two folding horses. Now and then a man comes into the front room from the street door, his shoes squeaking hideously. Sometimes there is a woman, usually in deep mourning. Each visitor approaches the long black box, looks into it with ill-concealed repugnance, snuffles softly, and then backs of toward the door. A clock on the mantel-piece ticks loudly. From the street come the usual noises--a wagon rattling, the clang of a trolley car's gong, the shrill cry of a child._  _In the back parlor six pallbearers sit upon chairs, all of them bolt upright, with their hands on their knees. They are in their Sunday clothes, with stiff white shirts. Their hats are on the floor beside their chairs. Each wears upon his lapel the gilt badge of a fraternal order, with a crêpe rosette. In the gloom they are indistinguishable; all of them talk in the same strained, throaty whisper. Between their remarks they pause, clear their throats, blow their noses, and shuffle in their chairs. They are intensely uncomfortable. Tempo: Adagio lamentoso, with occasionally a rise to andante maesto. So:_  FIRST PALLBEARER  Who woulda thought that _he_ woulda been the next?   SECOND PALLBEARER  Yes; you never can tell.   THIRD PALLBEARER  (_An oldish voice, oracularly._) We're here to-day and gone to-morrow.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  I seen him no longer ago than Chewsday. He never looked no better. Nobody would have----   FIFTH PALLBEARER  I seen him Wednesday. We had a glass of beer together in the Huffbrow Kaif. He was laughing and cutting up like he always done.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  You never know who it's gonna hit next. Him and me was pallbearers together for Hen Jackson no more than a month ago, or say five weeks.   FIRST PALLBEARER  Well, a man is lucky if he goes off quick. If I had _my_ way I wouldn't want no better way.   SECOND PALLBEARER  My brother John went thataway. He dropped like a stone, settin' there at the supper table. They had to take his knife out of his hand.   THIRD PALLBEARER  I had an uncle to do the same thing, but without the knife. He had what they call appleplexy. It runs in my family.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  They say it's in _his'n_, too.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  But he never looked it.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  No. Nobody woulda thought _he_ woulda been the next.   FIRST PALLBEARER  Them are the things you never can tell anything about.   SECOND PALLBEARER  Ain't it true!   THIRD PALLBEARER  We're here to-day and gone to-morrow.  (_A pause. Feet are shuffled. Somewhere a door bangs._)   FOURTH PALLBEARER  (_Brightly._) He looks elegant. I hear he never suffered none.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  No; he went too quick. One minute he was alive and the next minute he was dead.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Think of it: dead so quick!   FIRST PALLBEARER  Gone!   SECOND PALLBEARER  Passed away!   THIRD PALLBEARER  Well, we all have to go _some_ time.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  Yes; a man never knows but what his turn'll come next.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  You can't tell nothing by looks. Them sickly fellows generally lives to be old.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Yes; the doctors say it's the big stout person that goes off the soonest. They say typhord never kills none but the healthy.   FIRST PALLBEARER  So I have heered it said. My wife's youngest brother weighed 240 pounds. He was as strong as a mule. He could lift a sugar-barrel, and then some. Once I seen him drink damn near a whole keg of beer. Yet it finished him in less'n three weeks--and _he_ had it mild.   SECOND PALLBEARER  It seems that there's a lot of it this fall.   THIRD PALLBEARER  Yes; I hear of people taken with it every day. Some say it's the water. My brother Sam's oldest is down with it.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  I had it myself once. I was out of my head for four weeks.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  That's a good sign.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Yes; you don't die as long as you're out of your head.   FIRST PALLBEARER  It seems to me that there is a lot of sickness around this year.   SECOND PALLBEARER  I been to five funerals in six weeks.   THIRD PALLBEARER  I beat you. I been to six in five weeks, not counting this one.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  A body don't hardly know what to think of it scarcely.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  That's what _I_ always say: you can't tell who'll be next.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Ain't it true! Just think of _him_.   FIRST PALLBEARER  Yes; nobody woulda picked _him_ out.   SECOND PALLBEARER  Nor my brother John, neither.   THIRD PALLBEARER  Well, what _must_ be _must_ be.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  Yes; it don't do no good to kick. When a man's time comes he's got to go.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  We're lucky if it ain't us.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  So I always say. We ought to be thankful.   FIRST PALLBEARER  That's the way _I_ always feel about it.   SECOND PALLBEARER  It wouldn't do _him_ no good, no matter _what_ we done.   THIRD PALLBEARER  We're here to-day and gone to-morrow.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  But it's hard all the same.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  It's hard on _her_.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Yes, it is. Why should _he_ go?   FIRST PALLBEARER  It's a question nobody ain't ever answered.   SECOND PALLBEARER  Nor never won't.   THIRD PALLBEARER  You're right there. I talked to a preacher about it once, and even _he_ couldn't give no answer to it.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  The more you think about it the less you can make it out.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  When I seen him last Wednesday he had no more ideer of it than what you had.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  Well, if I had _my_ choice, that's the way I would always want to die.   FIRST PALLBEARER  Yes; that's what _I_ say. I am with you there.   SECOND PALLBEARER  Yes; you're right, both of you. It don't do no good to lay sick for months, with doctors' bills eatin' you up, and then have to go anyhow.   THIRD PALLBEARER  No; when a thing has to be done, the best thing to do is to get it done and over with.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  That's just what I said to my wife when I heerd.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  But nobody hardly thought that _he_ woulda been the next.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  No; but that's one of them things you can't tell.   FIRST PALLBEARER  You never know _who'll_ be the next.   SECOND PALLBEARER  It's lucky you don't.   THIRD PALLBEARER  I guess you're right.   FOURTH PALLBEARER  That's what my grandfather used to say: you never know what is coming.   FIFTH PALLBEARER  Yes; that's the way it goes.   SIXTH PALLBEARER  First one, and then somebody else.   FIRST PALLBEARER  Who it'll be you can't say.   SECOND PALLBEARER  _I_ always say the same: we're here to-day----   THIRD PALLBEARER  (_Cutting in jealousy and humorously._) And to-morrow we ain't here.  (_A subdued and sinister snicker. It is followed by sudden silence. There is a shuffling of feet in the front room, and whispers. Necks are craned. The pallbearers straighten their backs, hitch their coat collars and pull on their black gloves. The clergyman has arrived. From above comes the sound of weeping._)     _II.--FROM THE PROGRAMME OF A CONCERT_  _II.--From The Programme of a Concert_       _\"Ruhm und Ewigkeit\" (Fame and Eternity), a symphonic poem in B      flat minor, Opus 48, by Johann Sigismund Timotheus Albert Wolfgang      Kraus (1872-)._   Kraus, like his eminent compatriot, Dr. Richard Strauss, has gone to Friedrich Nietzsche, the laureate of the modern German tone-art, for his inspiration in this gigantic work. His text is to be found in Nietzsche's _Ecce Homo_, which was not published until after the poet's death, but the composition really belongs to _Also sprach Zarathustra_, as a glance will show:       I      _Wie lange sitzest du schon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22145"],["title","A Book of Burlesques (#1)"],["body","deinem Missgeschick?     Gieb Acht! Du brütest mir noch       ein Ei,       ein Basilisken-Ei,     aus deinem langen Jammer aus._       II      _Was schleicht Zarathustra entlang dem Berge?--_       III      _Misstrauisch, geschwürig, düster,       ein langer Lauerer,--     aber plötzlich, ein Blitz,       hell, furchtbar, ein Schlag     gen Himmel aus dem Abgrund:       --dem Berge selber schüttelt sich     das Eingeweide...._       IV      _Wo Hass und Blitzstrahl     Eins ward, ein Fluch,--     auf den Bergen haust jetzt Zarathustra's Zorn,       eine Wetterwolke schleicht er seines Wegs._       V      _Verkrieche sich, wer eine letzte Decke hat!       In's Bett mit euch, ihr Zärtlinge!     Nun rollen Donner über die Gewölbe,       nun zittert, was Gebälk und Mauer ist,     nun zucken Blitze und schwefelgelbe Wahrheiten--       Zarathustra flucht ...!_  For the following faithful and graceful translation the present commentator is indebted to Mr. Louis Untermeyer:       I      How long brood you now     On thy disaster?     Give heed! You hatch me soon       An egg,       From your long lamentation out of.       II      Why prowls Zarathustra among the mountains?      III      Distrustful, ulcerated, dismal,       A long waiter--     But suddenly a flash,       Brilliant, fearful. A lightning stroke     Leaps to heaven from the abyss:     --The mountains shake themselves and     Their intestines....       IV      As hate and lightning-flash       Are united, a _curse_!     On the mountains rages now Zarathustra's wrath,     Like a thunder cloud rolls it on its way.       V      Crawl away, ye who have a roof remaining!       To bed with you, ye tenderlings!     Now thunder rolls over the great arches,       Now tremble the bastions and battlements,     Now flashes palpitate and sulphur-yellow truths--     Zarathustra swears ...!  The composition is scored for three flutes, one piccolo, one bass piccolo, seven oboes, one English horn, three clarinets in D flat, one clarinet in G flat, one corno de bassetto, three bassoons, one contra-bassoon, eleven horns, three trumpets, eight cornets in B, four trombones, two alto trombones, one viol da gamba, one mandolin, two guitars, one banjo, two tubas, glockenspiel, bell, triangle, fife, bass-drum, cymbals, timpani, celesta, four harps, piano, harmonium, pianola, phonograph, and the usual strings.  At the opening a long B flat is sounded by the cornets, clarinets and bassoons in unison, with soft strokes upon a kettle-drum tuned to G sharp. After eighteen measures of this, _singhiozzando_, the strings enter _pizzicato_ with a figure based upon one of the scales of the ancient Persians--B flat, C flat, D, E sharp, G and A flat--which starts high among the first violins, and then proceeds downward, through the second violins, violas and cellos, until it is lost in solemn and indistinct mutterings in the double-basses. Then, the atmosphere of doom having been established, and the conductor having found his place in the score, there is heard the motive of brooding, or as the German commentators call it, the _Quälerei Motiv_:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  The opening chord of the eleventh is sounded by six horns, and the chords of the ninth, which follow, are given to the woodwind. The rapid figure in the second measure is for solo violin, heard softly against the sustained interval of the diminished ninth, but the final G natural is snapped out by the whole orchestra _sforzando_. There follows a rapid and daring development of the theme, with the flutes and violoncellos leading, first harmonized with chords of the eleventh, then with chords of the thirteenth, and finally with chords of the fifteenth. Meanwhile, the tonality has moved into D minor, then into A flat major, and then into G sharp minor, and the little arpeggio for the solo violin has been augmented to seven, to eleven, and in the end to twenty-three notes. Here the influence of Claude Debussy shows itself; the chords of the ninth proceed by the same chromatic semitones that one finds in the _Chansons de Bilitis_. But Kraus goes much further than Debussy, for the tones of his chords are constantly altered in a strange and extremely beautiful manner, and, as has been noted, he adds the eleventh, thirteenth and fifteenth. At the end of this incomparable passage there is a sudden drop to C major, followed by the first statement of the _Missgeschick Motiv_, or motive of disaster (misfortune, evil destiny, untoward fate):  [Illustration: Musical Score]  This graceful and ingratiating theme will give no concern to the student of Ravel and Schoenberg. It is, in fact, a quite elemental succession of intervals of the second, all produced by adding the ninth to the common chord--thus: C, G, C, D, E--with certain enharmonic changes. Its simplicity gives it, at a first hearing, a placid, pastoral aspect, somewhat disconcerting to the literalist, but the discerning will not fail to note the mutterings beneath the surface. It is first sounded by two violas and the viol da gamba, and then drops without change to the bass, where it is repeated _fortissimo_ by two bassoons and the contra-bassoon. The tempo then quickens and the two themes so far heard are worked up into a brief but tempestuous fugue. A brief extract will suffice to show its enormously complex nature:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  A pedal point on B flat is heard at the end of this fugue, sounded _fortissimo_ by all the brass in unison, and then follows a grand pause, twelve and a half measures in length. Then, in the strings, is heard the motive of warning:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  Out of this motive comes the harmonic material for much of what remains of the composition. At each repetition of the theme, the chord in the fourth measure is augmented by the addition of another interval, until in the end it includes every tone of the chromatic scale save C sharp. This omission is significant of Kraus' artistry. If C sharp were included the tonality would at once become vague, but without it the dependence of the whole gorgeous edifice upon C major is kept plain. At the end, indeed, the tonic chord of C major is clearly sounded by the wood-wind, against curious triplets, made up of F sharp, A flat and B flat in various combinations, in the strings; and from it a sudden modulation is made to C minor, and then to A flat major. This opens the way for the entrance of the motive of lamentation, or, as the German commentators call it, the _Schreierei Motiv_:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  This simple and lovely theme is first sounded, not by any of the usual instruments of the grand orchestra, but by a phonograph in B flat, with the accompaniment of a solitary trombone. When the composition was first played at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig the innovation caused a sensation, and there were loud cries of sacrilege and even proposals of police action. One indignant classicist, in token of his ire, hung a wreath of _Knackwürste_ around the neck of the bust of Johann Sebastian Bach in the Thomaskirche, and appended to it a card bearing the legend, _Schweinehund_! But the exquisite beauty of the effect soon won acceptance for the means employed to attain it, and the phonograph has so far made its way with German composers that Prof. Ludwig Grossetrommel, of Göttingen, has even proposed its employment in opera in place of singers.  This motive of lamentation is worked out on a grand scale, and in intimate association with the motives of brooding and of warning. Kraus is not content with the ordinary materials of composition. His creative force is always impelling him to break through the fetters of the diatonic scale, and to find utterance for his ideas in archaic and extremely exotic tonalities. The pentatonic scale is a favorite with him; he employs it as boldly as Wagner did in _Das Rheingold_. But it is not enough, for he proceeds from it into the Dorian mode of the ancient Greeks, and then into the Phrygian, and then into two of the plagal modes. Moreover, he constantly combines both unrelated scales and antagonistic motives, and invests the combinations in astounding orchestral colors, so that the hearer, unaccustomed to such bold experimentations, is quite lost in the maze. Here, for example, is a characteristic passage for solo French horn and bass piccolo:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  The dotted half notes for the horn obviously come from the motive of brooding, in augmentation, but the bass piccolo part is new. It soon appears, however, in various fresh aspects, and in the end it enters into the famous quadruple motive of \"sulphur-yellow truth\"--_schwefelgelbe Wahrheit_, as we shall presently see. Its first combination is with a jaunty figure in A minor, and the two together form what most of the commentators agree upon denominating the Zarathustra motive:  [Illustration: Musical Score]  I call this the Zarathustra motive, following the weight of critical opinion, but various influential critics dissent. Thus, Dr. Ferdinand Bierfisch, of the Hochschule für Musik at Dresden, insists that it is the theme of \"the elevated mood produced by the spiritual isolation and low barometric pressure of the mountains,\" while Prof. B. Moll, of Frankfurt a/M., calls it the motive of prowling. Kraus himself, when asked by Dr. Fritz Bratsche, of the Berlin _Volkszeitung_, shrugged his shoulders and answered in his native Hamburg dialect, \"_So gehts im Leben! 'S giebt gar kein Use_\"--Such is life; it gives hardly any use (to inquire?). In much the same way Schubert made reply to one who asked the meaning of the opening subject of the slow movement of his C major symphony: \"_Halt's Maul, du verfluchter Narr!_\"--Don't ask such question, my dear sir!  But whatever the truth, the novelty and originality of the theme cannot be denied, for it is in two distinct keys, D major and A minor, and they preserve their identity whenever it appears.
