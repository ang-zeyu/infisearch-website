I know I am a boy, but I do not like to be taken for a fool.\"  The doctor looked up and saw the indignation expressed on the faces of the three lads. Then he chuckled in a singular way and said:  \"Wait till I get through, young man. I do not take you for a fool ordinarily, but you can easily make a fool of yourself over this matter.\"  He had taken the short white hair, which was very coarse, in his fingers, having separated it from the others.  \"Notice the peculiar place where this hair seems to grow,\" he directed. \"It is not a part of the fetlock, but the fetlock hid it from view. I am going to pull this hair out, but first I want you to notice that there is another hair, it seems, on the other side of the ankle, and it is just like this. See it?\"  The boys saw it.  \"In a moment you won't see it,\" declared the doctor, as he adjusted the tweezers, getting a careful grip on the end of the hair. \"Here it comes.\"  Then he quickly drew it out and Nemo started a bit, but was quieted by Grody.  \"Young man,\" said the doctor, \"look at this. This hair appeared to be about an inch in length, but now it is three inches long. It is not broken off, and yet it has no root. I will guarantee there is not another hair on this horse like it! I will guarantee it did not grow on this horse! I will guarantee it was what made this horse lame! And I do not want my fee if this horse shows any lameness two hours from now!\"  The boys were astonished, as their faces indicated.  \"But, doctor, I do not understand!\" cried Frank. \"You must explain. How could a hair----\"  \"I will explain. It's an old trick, but one seldom tried. This hair came from the tail of a white horse. It was threaded into a long, keen needle. The fellow who got at your horse yesterday was an expert. With one jab of that needle he passed the hair through the flesh just back of this cord. It went in at one side, and came out on the other. After that, while he was pretending to look at the horse's feet, he clipped off the ends, and the hair was left in there. It could remain a day or so without doing any particular injury, but it was bound to make the horse lame as soon as he used that leg much. If it had been left there permanently it might have ruined the horse. That is all, young man.\"  \"Why was a white hair chosen, doctor?\"  \"The fellow felt sure it would not be noticed, and yet he could quickly locate it by its color when the time came for him to cure your horse of its lameness.\"  Once more the boys looked at each other, and this time it was plain they realized there were some things they did not know.  \"Doctor,\" said Frank, promptly, \"I wish to beg your pardon. I believe I said something rather hastily, but now I wish to say that you know your business thoroughly.\"  The doctor smiled, and closed his case.  \"I have been in the business all my life,\" he said, \"but I expect to continue to learn something new about it as long as I live. I will say that I doubt if I should have seen what was the matter with your horse if you had not told me of the fellow you believed had lamed him and how the horse kicked up a racket when the man was in the stall. That set me to looking for tricks, and I found the hair.\"  Frank offered to pay the doctor, but he refused to take it then, saying:  \"Here's my card, young man. If your horse is all right this afternoon you may send me five dollars. You may need me again some time.\"  Then he strode out of the stable, flung the case under the seat, scrambled into his carriage, caught up the reins, and away he went in a hurry.  \"Well, may I be farred and tethered--I mean tarred and feathered!\" cried Harry Rattleton. \"I never saw anything like that before.\"  \"Nor I,\" confessed Jack Diamond. \"It's astonishing! I have learned something to-day that I never knew before. I never would have dreamed that a hair could lame a horse in that way!\"  \"You want to look out for Nemo now,\" said Harry, \"and not let that chap get at him again.\"  \"I mean to,\" asserted Frank. \"I have sent for my colored boy, Toots, to come on and keep watch here when Grody is unable to do so. Till he gets here, Grody, I want you to watch Nemo like a hawk. I hardly think the whelp will try another trick, but there is no telling. I gave him a bad thumping.\"  \"But not half what he deserved!\" cried Diamond.     CHAPTER VI.  PRINCE AND THE EAVESDROPPER.   Nemo's lameness seemed to vanish as if by magic, and Frank was well satisfied. Grody took the utmost care of Nemo till Toots arrived.  The colored boy was delighted to come on to New Haven, and, as he was a lover of horses, his new occupation suited him very well. When Frank could not find time to take the horse out for his daily exercise Toots did it.  One evening a party of students gathered in Diamond's room. He had invited them there to show them his new bulldog.  Diamond had a fad, and it was dogs. His dog had caused trouble between Diamond and Merriwell early in their college career by taking a strip out of Frank's trousers. That dog had received mortal injuries in a fight, and now Diamond had another dog.  \"Isn't he a beauty!\" cried Jack, as he displayed the ugly-looking brute. \"Look at that head and those jaws! He comes from a line of gladiators.\"  \"What do you call him, Diamond?\" asked Ben Halliday.  \"Prince.\"  \"Put not thy trust in princes,\" croaked Dismal Jones.  \"Is he kind?\" asked Bandy Robinson.  \"Oh, he has a sunny disposition,\" assured Jack, smiling.  \"A sunny disposition,\" chirped Griswold, from the top of the table, upon which he had climbed so that he might be out of the way. \"By that I presume that you mean he will make it hot for any other dog he may tackle.\"  \"Hold on, Danny, old man!\" cried Jack, reprovingly. \"Haven't I treated you right?\"  \"Not lately, but if you've got any beer in the coop you can.\"  \"That gives me a pain!\" cried Robinson.  \"You must have been eating window glass,\" chuckled Griswold. \"That's how you happen to feel the pane.\"  \"You ramed little bunt--I mean you blamed little runt!\" exclaimed Rattleton, catching Danny by the neck. \"If you keep up this reckless punning you'll receive a check some day.\"  \"I hope so,\" was the instant retort. \"I'm broke, and I sent to the governor for one to-day.\"  \"Let him alone, Harry,\" advised Merriwell, laughing. \"You simply make him worse by talking to him.\"  \"That's the only thing I have against Griswold,\" declared Jack. \"He will pun in the most reckless manner at all times. Some of his jokes are not what they are cracked up to be.\"  \"Like the eggs we used to get down at Mrs. Harrington's when we were freshmen,\" grinned Griswold.  \"Even the vilest sinner may repent and be forgiven,\" came solemnly from Dismal Jones. \"There's a faint ray of hope for Griswold.\"  \"But it's mighty dim,\" declared Robinson.  Once more attention was given to Jack's dog, and Diamond pointed out the animal's fine features.  \"When are dogs at their best?\" asked Halliday, seriously.  \"In winter,\" Griswold instantly put in. \"There are no flies on them then.\"  \"Smother him!\" howled Robinson, wildly.  \"Smother time,\" cackled Danny, as he slipped off the table and dodged around a chair to get out of reach.  Halliday caught up a pair of scissors and pretended to sharpen them, looking at Griswold as if he meant to shed his gore.  \"What are you going to do?\" asked Danny. \"Going into the scissors-grinding business? It's great when things are dull.\"  It was plain that Danny could not be suppressed, and so the boys tried to ignore him. Prince was admired some more, and then Halliday picked up a banjo, put it in tune, and sang a song.  \"Your voice is somewhat off color to-night, old man,\" observed Robinson, \"and I think you skipped a bar.\"  \"You don't know him,\" cried Griswold, instantly. \"I was out with him last night and he didn't skip any.\"  Then almost every other fellow in the room grabbed up something and threw it at Danny, who could do nothing but shield his face and take the pelting he received.  \"Diamond is a dog crank, and Merriwell is a horse crank,\" said Robinson. \"By the way, I hear you think of racing your horse this spring, Merriwell?\"  \"Who told you that?\" asked Frank.  \"Who told me? Oh, I don't know. Is it a secret? I think I have heard several fellows speak of it.\"  \"Oh, I don't know as it is a secret,\" said Frank. \"I may try him in some small country race, if I get a good opportunity; but I am not likely to have much of a chance, between baseball, rowing, and my studies. I'm kept pretty busy.\"  \"The only wonder to me is that you get time to study at all,\" declared Halliday. \"I never before saw a fellow who could carry on so many things at the same time and make successes of them all.\"  \"I hear two more men have been dropped a class,\" said Diamond.  \"That's right,\" sighed Jones. \"Dorman and Street have departed hence. May peace go with them.\"  \"Poor old Easy!\" exclaimed Robinson. \"He was a fine fellow, but he was altogether too easy. He wouldn't skin, and he couldn't keep up with the push.\"  \"There are some other fellows who are bound to go sooner or later,\" observed Rattleton. \"I can name several.\"  \"Both Harris and Ditson are bound to get it in the neck,\" said Griswold. \"They are skinners of the worst kind.\"  \"That's right,\" agreed Halliday. \"Ditson is an expert at it. He spends more time and ingenuity in concocting schemes to fool the examining tutor or professor than it would take to learn his subjects ten times over.\"  \"Sure's you're born!\" exclaimed Jones. \"Why, he has his finger nails, cuffs, and the palms of his hands covered with writing and diagrams every time he knows he is to be called up, and in this way he always succeeds in making a clean rush.\"  \"Harris knows something about photography,\" said Halliday, \"and he is continually making minute pictures of diagrams and writing, which he arranges on little tabs, which he can hold in his palm. He seldom flunks, but he'll trip some time.\"  \"Hanged if I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21958"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Races (#7)"],["body","see why fellows should work so hard to fool tutors or professors when they might learn all that was required of them without half the trouble,\" cried Harry.  \"That is easy enough to explain,\" smiled Merriwell. \"Harris is a natural gambler. He delights in excitement and danger, and he actually enjoys taking such desperate ventures.\"  \"Well, there is something in that,\" laughed Rattleton. \"I never regarded it that way before. I'll be fanged if there isn't hascination in it--no, I'll be hanged if there isn't fascination in it!\"  \"It's too bad this matter was mentioned, fellows,\" said Merriwell, with pretended seriousness. \"I regret it very much.\"  \"Why?\" asked Robinson, curiously.  \"Notice how excited Rattleton has become over it? He's not quite such a sport as Harris, but he had rather take chances on anything than eat, and it's ten to one he'll be skinning within a week.\"  \"Sometimes a fellow has to skin,\" declared Griswold.  \"Did you ever, Danny?\" asked Diamond.  \"Did I? Well! I have a patent scheme of my own.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Rattleton, eagerly.  \"Why, I have a box of chalk crayons which I bought for myself. I have soaked them in alum water till they are hard, and I usually have several of them about my person. They are covered with diagrams and everything that may prove interesting or necessary. But I want to tell you something. I never use 'em unless I am driven to the wall.\"  \"By that he means the blackboard,\" laughed Halliday.  \"And you were talking about Harris and Ditson being skinners!\" came reproachfully from Jones. \"My dear young man, there is a place that burneth with fire and brimstone!\"  \"That is reserved for liars,\" chuckled Danny. \"Jones, beware, any moment may be your next.\"  \"That's right,\" agreed Jones, sadly. \"I am sure I shall not live to see another day--if I die to-night.\"  \"Gentleman,\" said Merriwell, \"death is a grave subject to jest upon. You'd better bury it.\"  \"That's all right,\" put in Robinson. \"If he catches cold any of us may go to coffin.\"  \"I'll not undertaker pun,\" murmured Rattleton.  Then there was a deathlike silence, and the lads all looked at one another reproachfully.  \"Let's change the subject,\" cried Diamond. \"Speaking of Ditson, I believe he claims to have blue blood in his veins. Says his ancestors came over on the _Mayflower_, and were among the first to settle in this country.\"  \"They may have settled,\" said Griswold, \"but none of his family has ever settled since that time. They owe everybody that will trust them.\"  \"Ditson has stuck his friends right and left since coming to Yale, till he has not a friend left,\" said Robinson.  \"Why, he owed Hartwick several hundred dollars when Hartwick left,\" declared Diamond.  \"Just the same, Hartwick is back in New Haven and in is chummy with Ditson again,\" asserted Jones.  Merriwell displayed some interest.  \"How do you know he is chummy with Ditson?\" he asked.  \"I have seen them together!\"  \"That means something!\" cried Rattleton, excitedly. \"Those pads are cotting--I mean those cads are plotting! You want to look out for trouble, Merry!\"  \"I will!\" exclaimed Frank. \"Ditson is treading on dangerous ground. If he makes a break, I'll descend on him. I have been easy with a chap of his treacherous nature quite long enough.\"  \"Too long!\" burst fiercely from Diamond. \"If I had been in your place I'd ended Mr. Ditson's career long ago.\"  \"I don't know what the fellows can do to injure me,\" said Frank.  \"They'll find some way to give it to you if you don't watch out,\" said Rattleton. \"Perhaps one of them hired that fellow to lame your horse.\"  \"Perhaps so.\"  \"You think a great deal of that horse,\" said Jack. \"You want to be constantly on your guard or something will happen to it.\"  \"Toots is on the watch, and any one will have hard work getting the best of that darky. He is about as sharp as they make 'em.\"  \"He is a very clever coon,\" admitted Harry; \"and he seems to know his business, still you can't tell what may happen.\"  \"I wouldn't have anything happen to Nemo for worlds. I don't quite understand why I think so much of that horse, but he is a wonderfully intelligent creature.\"  \"Don't tell that you care so much for him. If your enemies were to find it out they would scheme to fix Nemo.\"  \"I'd have no mercy on the person that injured that horse.\"  \"What's the matter with your dog, Jack?\" asked Robinson. \"He is acting in a very queer manner.\"  Prince was sniffing at the door, whining and growling, while the hair on his neck bristled in a significant manner.  Diamond got up and quickly approached the door. In a moment he flung it open, and out shot Prince.  There was a sound of swiftly retreating feet, a clatter on the stairs, a scramble, a shout of pain or fear, and a sudden blow.  \"Quick, fellows!\" cried Jack, excitedly. \"Prince has found an eavesdropper!\"  They rushed out, they sprang down the stairs, and at the foot they found the dog, apparently in a dazed condition, but with a piece of cloth in his mouth.  \"Good dog!\" cried Jack. \"Where is he?\"  Prince growled and chewed away at the piece of cloth.  \"He got away,\" said Frank. \"He must have struck Prince with a heavy cane, or a club, for we heard the blow. The dog was stunned, but he held fast to this piece of the fellow's trousers.\"  \"After him!\" spluttered Rattleton. \"He may not be able to get away! We'll try to capture him!\"  But the effort was vain. The eavesdropper had made good his escape.  After a little time the boys all came back to Diamond's room. They found Jack examining the piece of cloth, which he had taken from the bulldog with no small difficulty.  \"It is from somebody's trousers,\" said Jack, seriously. \"Whoever the sneak was, he'll have to buy a new pair. He hit Prince a frightful blow behind the ear, but the good old fellow held fast to this trophy.\"  \"If we'd nabbed the fellow, we wouldn't have done a thing to him--not a thing!\" cried Griswold.  \"See if any of you fellows recognize this piece of cloth as belonging to the clothing of any chap you know,\" invited Diamond.  They all examined it.  \"If I mistake not,\" said Dismal Jones, \"this came from a certain section of a certain individual's trousers, and the section to which I refer is located about eight inches south of the back strap.\"  \"And the fellow,\" exclaimed Robinson, \"the fellow is----\"  \"Roland Ditson!\" finished Rattleton.  \"In that case,\" said Diamond, \"Merriwell's enemies have received a good tip concerning his fondness for Nemo. You will have to be doubly careful about that horse after this, Frank.\"     CHAPTER VII.  THE PLOT.   If Roland Ditson was the person from whose trousers the piece of cloth had been torn he took good care to destroy what he had retained of the breeches without delay, for they were never again seen in his possession.  The figure on the cloth was not pronounced enough to distinguish it in a manner to make it absolute proof that it came from a garment owned by Roland.  Nevertheless Diamond accused Ditson of listening at his door, but Roll vigorously denied that he had done so. Diamond told him he was a natural-born prevaricator, and let it go at that.  But Ditson was watched like a hawk by the boy from Virginia, for Jack felt sure the fellow was up to crookedness.  Frank Merriwell knew that if Ditson had been listening to the conversation that was taking place in that room his enemies must know in what light he regarded Nemo.  This caused Frank to caution both Toots and Grody to redouble their vigilance in watching over and caring for the splendid creature.  \"Don' yo' worry about me, Marser Frank,\" assured the darky lad. \"Dat's de fines' hawse dat dis chile ebber seen, an' I'se gwan ter watch ober heem lek he wus de apple ob mah eye.\"  \"I have decided to enter Nemo in the Mystic Park races at Bethany, Toots,\" Merriwell declared, \"and I think I'll let you ride him, my boy.\"  Toots showed two rows of gleaming ivories and beamed with the greatest delight.  \"If yer done dat, Marser Frank, I'se gwan ter win on dat hawse jes ez shore ez yeh bawn, sar!\" he cried. \"I'se done rid dat critter enough teh know he's a wondah, sar. Dat hawse is wuf a forchune, sar!\"  \"If you win, Toots, I may give you a chance to ride him in some races later in the season.\"  \"If I don' win dat race, I done hope I nebber dror annodder bref, sar!\" cried the darky boy, excitedly. \"Dat'll show yo' what yo' kin do at de Coney Islan' races. If yo's gwan ter gamble on dat hawse, yo's a dead sho' winnar, sar!\"  \"I am not much of a gambler, Toots, but I may back Nemo for a little something.\"  \"Yo'll win, Marser Frank. If dis darky ebber knowed what he wus talking about yo'll win!\"  Frank's enemies seemed remarkably quiet, but something told him that every move he made was watched. This was true, and they soon knew exactly what races he intended to enter Nemo for, and that the darky was going to ride the horse.  One night Harris, Hartwick, Harlow, Ditson and Mike Hogan met in the saloon where they had first formed a combine against Merriwell. They were there by appointment, called together by Hartwick, who seemed to have assumed the leadership.  Hartwick was taking no chances on any thin partitions, and so he secured a little back room in the place, where it seemed that nothing could be overheard by any one who might chance to be watching them.  Drinks were ordered, and when they were brought and the waiter had departed Hartwick said:  \"Gentlemen, we may as well get down to business at once. I have called you together to make arrangements for striking a blow at our common enemy.\"  \"Well, I think it's erbout time!\" growled Mike Hogan. \"I've been wantin' ter do something fer a long while, but you have kept holdin' me back.\"  \"You have been too much on the jump, my friend,\" said Hartwick, scowling. \"If we'd let you gone it alone you'd had Merriwell on his guard, and that would have ruined everything.\"  \"It strikes me that Merriwell is on his guard now,\" observed Harris. \"He acts as if he knew there was"]]]
