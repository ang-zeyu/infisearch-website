Slaves crouching on the very plains   Where rolled the storm of Freedom's war! A groan from Eutaw's haunted wood--   A wail where Camden's martyrs fell-- By every shrine of patriot blood,   From Moultrie's wall and Jasper's well.  By storied hill and hallow'd grot,   By mossy wood and marshy glen, Whence rang of old the rifle-shot,   And hurrying shout of Marion's men! The groan of breaking hearts is there--   The falling lash--the fetter's clank! Slaves--SLAVES are breathing in that air,   Which old De Kalb and Sumter drank!  What, ho!--our countrymen in chains!   The whip on WOMAN'S shrinking flesh! Our soil yet reddening with the stains,   Caught from her scourging, warm and fresh! What! mothers from their children riven!   What! God's own image bought and sold! AMERICANS to market driven,   And barter'd as the brute for gold!  Speak! shall their agony of prayer   Come thrilling to our hearts in vain? To us, whose fathers scorn'd to bear   The paltry menace of a chain; To us, whose boast is loud and long   Of holy Liberty and Light-- Say, shall these writhing slaves of wrong,   Plead vainly for their plunder'd Right?  Shall every flap of England's flag   Proclaim that all around are free, From \"farthest Ind\" to each blue crag   That beetles o'er the Western Sea? And shall we scoff at Europe's kings,   When Freedom's fire is dim with us, And round our country's altar clings   The damning shade of Slavery's curse?  Just God! and shall we calmly rest,   The Christian's scorn--the Heathen's mirth-- Content to live the lingering jest   And by-word of a mocking Earth? Shall our own glorious land retain   That curse which Europe scorns to bear? Shall our own brethren drag the chain   Which not even Russia's menials wear?  Down let the shrine of Moloch sink,   And leave no traces where it stood; No longer let its idol drink   His daily cup of human blood: But rear another altar there,   To Truth, and Love, and Mercy given, And Freedom's gift, and Freedom's prayer,   Shall call an answer down from Heaven!     Myron Holley.  BY W.H. BURLEIGH.   Yes--fame is his:--but not the fame   For which the conqueror pants and strives, Whose path is tracked through blood and flame,   And over countless human lives! His name no armed battalions hail   With bugle shriek or thundering gun,-- No widows curse him, as they wail   For slaughtered husband and for son.  Amid the moral strife alone,   He battled fearlessly and long, And poured, with clear, untrembling tone,   Rebuke upon the hosts of Wrong-- To break Oppression's cruel rod,   He dared the perils of the fight, And in the name of FREEDOM'S GOD   Struck boldly for the TRUE and RIGHT!  With faith, whose eye was never dim,   The triumph, yet afar, he saw, When, bonds smote off from soul and limb,   And freed alike by Love and Law, The slave--no more a slave--shall stand   Erect--and loud, from sea to sea, Exultant burst o'er all the land   The glorious song of jubilee!  Why should we mourn, thy labor done,   That thou art called to thy reward; Rest, Freedom's war-worn champion!   Rest, faithful soldier of the LORD! For oh, not vainly hast thou striven,   Through storm, and gloom, and deepest night-- Not vainly hath thy life been given   For GOD, for FREEDOM, and for RIGHT.     VOICE OF NEW ENGLAND AGAINST SLAVERY.  Words by Whittier. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Up the hill side, down the glen, Rouse the sleeping citizen; Summon out the might of men! Like a lion growling low, Like a nightstorm rising slow, Like the tread of unseen foe.  It is coming--it is nigh! Stand your homes and altars by; On your own free threshholds die. Clang the bells in all your spires; On the gray hills of your sires Fling to heaven your signal fires.  Whoso shrinks or falters now, Whoso to the yoke would bow, Brand the craven on his brow. Freedom's soil hath only place For a free and fearless race-- None for traitors false and base.  Take your land of sun and bloom; Only leave to Freedom room For her plough, and forge, and loom. Take your slavery-blackened vales; Leave us but our own free gales, Blowing on our thousand sails.  Onward with your fell design; Dig the gulf and draw the line; Fire beneath your feet the mine: Deeply, when the wide abyss Yawns between your land and this, Shall ye feel your helplessness.  By the hearth, and in the bed, Shaken by a look or tread, Ye shall own a guilty dread. And the curse of unpaid toil, Downward through your generous soil, Like a fire shall burn and spoil.  Our bleak hills shall bud and blow, Vines our rocks shall overgrow, Plenty in our valleys flow;-- And when vengeance clouds your skies, Hither shall ye turn your eyes, As the damned on Paradise!  We but ask our rocky strand, Freedom's true and brother band, Freedom's strong and honest hand, Valleys by the slave untrod, And the Pilgrim's mountain sod, Blessed of our fathers' God!     THE CLARION OF FREEDOM.  Words from the Emancipator. Music \"The Chariot.\"   [Music]  The clarion--the clarion of Freedom now sounds, From the east to the west Independence resounds; From the hills, and the streams, and the far distant skies, Let the shout Independence from Slav'ry arise.  The army--the army have taken the field, And the Liberty hosts never, never will yield; By free principles strengthened, each bosom now glows, And with ardor immortal the struggle they close.  The armor, the armor that girds every breast, Is the hope of deliverance for millions oppressed; O'er the tears, and the sighs, and the wrongs of the slave, See the white flag of freedom triumphantly wave.  The conflict--the conflict will shortly be o'er, And the demon of slavery shall rule us no more; And the laurels of victory shall surely reward The heroes immortal who've conquered for God.     STRIKE FOR LIBERTY.  Words from the Christian Freeman. Air, \"Scots wha hae.\"   [Music]  Sons of Freedom's honored sires, Light anew your beacon fires, Fight till every foe retires     From your hallowed soil. Sons of Pilgrim Fathers blest, Pilgrim Mothers gone to rest, Listen to their high behest,     Strike for Liberty.  Ministers of God to men, Heed ye not the nation's sin? Heaven's blessing can ye win     If ye falter now? Men of blood now ask your vote, O'er your heads their banners float; Raise, Oh raise the warning note,     God and duty call!  Men of justice, bold and brave, To the ballot-box and save Freedom from her opening grave--     Onward! brothers, on! Christian patriots, tried and true, Freedom's eyes now turn to you; Foes are many--are ye few?     Gideon's God is yours!     On to Victory.  BY REV. MRS. MARTYN.   Children of the glorious dead, Who for freedom fought and bled, With her banner o'er you spread,     On to victory. Not for stern ambition's prize, Do our hopes and wishes rise; Lo, our leader from the skies,     Bids us do or die.  Ours is not the tented field-- We no earthly weapons wield-- Light and love, our sword and shield,     Truth our panoply. This is proud oppression's hour; Storms are round us; shall we cower? While beneath a despot's power     Groans the suffering slave?  While on every southern gale, Comes the helpless captive's tale, And the voice of woman's wail,     And of man's despair? While our homes and rights are dear, Guarded still with watchful fear, Shall we coldly turn our ear     From the suppliant's prayer?  Never! by our Country's shame-- Never! by a Saviour's claim, To the men of every name,     Whom he died to save. Onward, then, ye fearless band-- Heart to heart, and hand to hand; Yours shall be the patriot's stand--     Or the martyr's grave.     THE MAN FOR ME.  Parody by J.N.T. Tucker. Air, \"The Rose that all are praising.\"   [Music]  Oh, he is not the man for me,   Who buys or sells a slave, Nor he who will not set him free,   But sends him to his grave; But he whose noble heart beats warm   For all men's life and liberty; Who loves alike each human form--   Oh that's the man for me,   Oh that's the man for me,   Oh that's the man for me.  He's not at all the man for me,   Who sells a man for gain, Who bends the pliant servile knee,   To Slavery's God of shame! But he whose God-like form erect   Proclaims that all alike are free To think, and speak, and vote, and act,   Oh that's the man for me.  He sure is not the man for me   Whose spirit will succumb, When men endowed with Liberty   Lie bleeding, bound and dumb; But he whose faithful words of might   Ring through the land from shore to sea, For man's eternal equal right,   Oh that's the man for me.  No, no, he's not the man for me   Whose voice o'er hill and plain, Breaks forth for glorious liberty,   But binds himself, the chain! The mightiest of the noble band   Who prays and toils the world to free, With head, and heart, and voice, and vote--   Oh that's the man for me.     PILGRIM SONG.  Words by Geo. Lunt. Air \"Troubadour.\"   [Music]  Over the mountain wave   See where they come; Storm-cloud and wintry wind   Welcome them home; Yet where the sounding gale   Howls to the sea, There their song peals along,   Deep toned and free.     Pilgrims and wanderers,     Hither we come;     Where the free dare to be,     This is our home.  England hath sunny dales,   Dearly they bloom; Scotia hath heather-hills,   Sweet their perfume: Yet through the wilderness   Cheerful we stray, Native land, native land--   Home far away!     Pilgrims, &c.  Dim grew the forest path,   Onward they trod: Firm beat their noble hearts,   Trusting in God! Gray men and blooming maids,   High rose their song-- Hear it sweep, clear and deep   Ever along!     Pilgrims, &c.  Not theirs the glory-wreath,   Torn by the blast; Heavenward their holy steps,   Heavenward they passed! Green be their mossy graves!   Ours be their fame, While their song peals along,   Ever the same!     Pilgrims, &c.     The Bondman.  FROM THE LIBERATOR.   Feebly the bondman toiled,   Sadly he wept-- Then to his wretched cot   Mournfully crept: How doth his free-born soul   Pine "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],["title","The Liberty Minstrel (#7)"],["body","'neath his chain! Slavery! Slavery!   Dark is thy reign.  Long ere the break of day,   Roused from repose, Wearily toiling   Till after its close-- Praying for freedom,   He spends his last breath: Liberty! Liberty!   Give me, or death.  When, when, oh Lord! will right   Triumph o'er wrong? Tyrants oppress the weak,   Oh Lord! how long? Hark! hark! a peal resounds   From shore to shore-- Tyranny! Tyranny!   Thy reign is o'er.  E'en now the morning   Gleams from the East-- Despots are feeling   Their triumph is past-- Strong hearts are answering   To freedom's loud call-- Liberty! Liberty!   Full and for all.     FOURTH OF JULY.  Words by Mrs. Sigourney. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  We have a goodly clime,   Broad vales and streams we boast; Our mountain frontiers frown sublime,   Old Ocean guards our coast.  Suns bless our harvests fair,   With fervid smile serene, But a dark shade is gathering there,   What can its blackness mean?  We have a birth-right proud,   For our young sons to claim-- An eagle soaring o'er the cloud,   In freedom and in fame.  We have a scutcheon bright,   By our dead fathers bought; A fearful blot distains its white--   Who hath such evil wrought?  Our banner o'er the sea   Looks forth with starry eye, Emblazoned glorious, bold and free,   A letter on the sky--  What hand with shameful stain,   Hath marred its heavenly blue? The yoke, the fasces, and the chain,   Say, are these emblems true?  This day doth music rare   Swell through our nation's bound, But Afric's wailing mingles there,   And Heaven doth hear the sound.  O God of power! we turn   In penitence to thee, Bid our loved land the lesson learn--   To bid the slave be free.     YE SPIRITS OF THE FREE.  Air--\"My faith looks up to thee.\"   [Music]  Ye spirits of the free, Can ye for ever see   Your brother man A yoked and scourged slave, Chains dragging to his grave, And raise no hand to save?   Say if you can.  In pride and pomp to roll, Shall tyrants from the soul   God's image tear, And call the wreck their own,-- While from th' eternal throne, They shut the stifled groan,   And bitter prayer?  Shall he a slave be bound, Whom God hath doubly crowned   Creation's lord? Shall men of Christian name, Without a blush of shame, Profess their tyrant claim   From God's own word?  No! at the battle cry, A host prepared to die,   Shall arm for fight-- But not with martial steel, Grasped with a murderous zeal; No arms their foes shall feel,   But love and light.  Firm on Jehovah's laws, Strong in their righteous cause,   They march to save. And vain the tyrant's mail, Against their battle-hail, Till cease the woe and wail   Of tortured slave!     Sing Me a Triumph Song.   Sing me a triumph song, Roll the glad notes along,   Great God, to thee! Thine be the glory bright, Source of all power and might! For thou hast said, in might,   Man shall be free.  Sing me a triumph song, Let all the sound prolong,   Air, earth, and sea, Down falls the tyrant's power, See his dread minions cower; Now, from this glorious hour,   Man will be free.  Sing me a triumph song, Sing in the mighty throng,   Sing Jubilee! Let the broad welkin ring, While to heaven's mighty King, Honor and praise we sing,   For man is free.     WAKE, SONS OF THE PILGRIMS.  Air--\"M'Gregor's Gathering.\"   [Music]  Wake, sons of the Pilgrims, and look to your right! The despots of Slav'ry are up in their might: Indulge not in sleep, it's like digging the graves Of blood-purchased freedom--'tis yielding like slaves. Then halloo, halloo, halloo to the contest, Awake from your slumbers, no longer delay, But struggle for freedom, while struggle you may-- Then rally, rally, rally, rally, rally, rally, While our forests shall wave or while rushes a river, Oh, yield not your birth-right! maintain it for ever!  Wake, Sons of the Pilgrims! why slumber ye on? Your chains are now forging, your fetters are done; Oh! sleep not, like Samson, on Slavery's foul arm, For, Delilah-like, she's now planning your harm. Then halloo, halloo, halloo, to the contest! Awake from your sleeping--nor slumber again, Once bound in your fetters, you'll struggle in vain; While your eye-balls may move, O wake up now, or never-- Wake, freemen! awake, or you're ruined forever!  Yes, freemen are waking! we fling to the breeze, The bright flag of freedom, the banner of Peace; The slave long forgotten, forlorn, and alone, We hail as a brother--our own mother's son! Then halloo, halloo, halloo, to the contest! For freedom we rally--for freedom to all-- To rescue the slave, and ourselves too from thrall. We rally, rally, rally, rally, rally, rally-- While a slave shall remain, bound, the weak by the stronger, We will never disband, but strive harder and longer.     OUR COUNTRYMEN ARE DYING.  Words by C.W. Dennison. Tune--\"From Greenland's Icy Mountains.\"   [Music]  Our countrymen are dying   Beneath their cankering chains, Full many a heart is sighing,   Where nought but slav'ry reigns; No note of joy and gladness,   No voice with freedom's lay, Fall on them in their sadness,   To wipe those tears away.  Where proud Potomac dashes   Along its northern strand, Where Rappahannock lashes   Virginia's sparkling sand; Where Eutaw, famed in story,   Flows swift to Santee's stream, There, there in grief and gory,   The pining slave is seen!  And shall New England's daughters,   Descendants of the free, Beside whose far-famed waters   Is heard sweet minstrelsy-- Shall they, when hearts are breaking,   And woman weeps in woe, Shall they, all listless waiting,   No hearts of pity show.  No! let the shout for freedom   Ring out a certain peal, Let sire and youthful maiden,   All who have hearts to feel, Awake! and with the blessing   Of Him who came to save, A holy, peaceful triumph,   Shall greet the kneeling slave!     We ask not Martial Glory.   We ask not \"martial glory,\"   Nor \"battles bravely won;\" We tell no boastful story   To laud our \"favorite son;\" We do not seek to gather   From glory's field of blood, The laurels of the warrior,   Steeped in the crimson flood--  But we can boast that Birney   Holds not the tyrant's rod, Nor binds in chains and fetters,   The image of his God; No vassal, at his bidding,   Is doomed the lash to feel; No menial crouches near him,   No Charley's[3] at his heel.  His heart is free from murder,   His hand without its stain; His head and heart united,   To loose the bondman's chain: His deeds of noble daring,   Shall make the tyrant cower; Oppression flees before him,   With all its boasted power.  Soon shall the voice of freedom,   O'er earth its echoes roll-- And earth's rejoicing millions   Be free, from pole to pole. Then rally round your leader,   Ye friends of liberty; And let the shout for Birney,   Ring out o'er land and sea.  [Footnote 3: Clay's body servant.]     COME, JOIN THE ABOLITIONISTS.  Air--\"When I can read my title clear.\"   [Music]  Come, join the Abolitionists,   Ye young men bold and strong, And with a warm and cheerful zeal,   Come, help the cause along: Come help the cause along, Come help the cause along; And with a warm and cheerful zeal, Come, help the cause along. Oh that will be joyful, joyful, joyful, Oh that will be joyful, When Slav'ry is no more, When Slav'ry is no more, When Slav'ry is no more: 'Tis then we'll sing, and off'rings bring, When Slav'ry is no more.  Come, join the Abolitionists,   Ye men of riper years, And save your wives and children dear,   From grief and bitter tears: From grief and bitter tears, From grief and bitter tears; And save your wives and children dear, From grief and bitter tears. Oh that will be joyful, joyful, joyful, Oh that will be joyful, When Slav'ry is no more, When Slav'ry is no more, When Slav'ry is no more: 'Tis then we'll sing, and off'rings bring, When Slav'ry is no more.  Come join the Abolitionists,   Ye dames and maidens fair; And breathe around us in our path,   Affection's hallowed air. O that will be joyful, joyful, joyful, O that will be joyful, When woman cheers us on, When woman cheers us on, When woman cheers us on, To conquests not yet won; 'Tis then we'll sing, and offerings bring, When woman cheers us on.  Come, join the Abolitionists,   Ye sons and daughters all; Of this our own America,   Come at the friendly call. O that will be joyful, joyful, O that will be joyful, When all shall proudly say, This, this is Freedom's day, Oppression flee away! 'Tis then we'll sing and offerings bring, When Freedom wins the day.     WE ARE COME, ALL COME.  By G.W.C.   [Music]  We are come, all come, with the crowded throng, To join our notes in a plaintive song; For the bond man sighs, and the scalding tear Runs down his cheek while we mingle here.  We are come, all come, with a hallowed vow, At the shrine of slavery never to bow, For the despot's reign o'er hill and plain, Spreads grief and woe in his horrid train.  We are come, all come, a determined band, To rescue the slave from the tyrant's hand; And our prayers shall ascend with our songs to Him Who sits in the midst of the cherubim.  We are come, all come, in the strength of youth, In the light of hope and the power of truth; And we joy to see in our ranks to-day, The honored locks of the good and grey.  We are come, all come, in our holy might, And freedom's foes shall be put to flight; Oh God! with favoring smiles from thee, Our songs shall soon chant the victory.     THE LAW OF LOVE.  Words by a Lady. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Blest is the man whose tender heart   Feels all another's pain, To whom the supplicating eye   Was never raised in vain,   Was never raised in vain.  Whose breast expands with generous warmth,   A stranger's woe to feel, And bleeds in pity o'er the wound,   He wants the power to heal,   He wants the power to heal.  He spreads his kind supporting arms,   To every child of grief; His secret bounty largely flows,   And brings unasked relief.  To gentle offices of love   His feet are never slow; He views, through mercy's melting eye,   A"]]]
