She had curves. She definitely had curves. As a matter of fact, Malone didn't really think he had ever seen curves before. These were something new and different and truly three-dimensional. But it wasn't the curves, or the long straight lines of her legs, or the quiet beauty of her face, that made her so special. After all, Malone had seen legs and bodies and faces before.  At least, he thought he had. Offhand, he couldn't remember where. Looking at the girl, Malone was ready to write brand-new definitions for every anatomical term. Even a term like \"hands.\" Malone had never seen anything especially arousing in the human hand before--anyway, not when the hand was just lying around, so to speak, attached to its wrist but not doing anything in particular. But these hands, long, slender and tapering, white and cool-looking....  And yet, it wasn't just the sheer physical beauty of the girl. She had something else, something more and something different. _(Something borrowed_, Malone thought in a semidelirious haze, _and something blue.)_ Personality? Character? Soul?  Whatever it was, Malone decided, this girl had it. She had enough of it to supply the entire human race, and any others that might exist in the Universe. Malone smiled at the girl and she smiled back.  After seeing the smile, Malone wasn't sure he could still walk evenly. Somehow, though, he managed to go over to her and extend his hand. The notion that a telepath would turn out to be this mind-searing Epitome had never crossed his mind, but now, somehow, it seemed perfectly fitting and proper.  \"Good morning, Miss Thompson,\" he said in what he hoped was a winning voice.  The smile disappeared. It was like the sun going out.  The vision appeared to be troubled. Malone was about to volunteer his help--if necessary, for the next seventy years--when she spoke.  \"I'm not Miss Thompson,\" she said.  \"This is one of our nurses,\" Dr. Harman put in. \"Miss Wilson, Mr. Malone. And Mr. Boyd. Miss Thompson, gentlemen, is over there.\"  Malone turned.  There, in a corner of the room, an old lady sat. She was a small old lady, with apple-red cheeks and twinkling eyes. She held some knitting in her hands, and she smiled up at the FBI men as if they were her grandsons come for tea and cookies, of a Sunday afternoon.  She had snow-white hair that shone like a crown around her old head in the lights of the room. Malone blinked at her. She didn't disappear.  \"You're Miss Thompson?\" he said.  She smiled sweetly. \"Oh, my, no,\" she said.  There was a long silence. Malone looked at her. Then he looked at the unbelievably beautiful Miss Wilson. Then he looked at Dr. Harman. And, at last, he looked at Boyd.  \"All right,\" he said. \"I get it. _You're_ Miss Thompson.\"  \"Now, wait a minute, Malone,\" Boyd began.  \"Wait a minute?\" Malone said. \"There are four people here, not counting me. I know I'm not Miss Thompson. I never was, not even as a child. And Dr. Harman isn't, and Miss Wilson isn't, and Whistler's Great-Grandmother isn't, either. So you must be. Unless she isn't here. Or unless she's invisible. Or unless I'm crazy.\"  \"It isn't _you_, Malone,\" Boyd said. \"What isn't me?\"  \"That's crazy,\" Boyd said.  \"Okay,\" Malone said. \"I'm not crazy. Then will somebody please tell me--\"  The little old lady cleared her throat. A silence fell. When it was complete she spoke, and her voice was as sweet and kindly as anything Malone had ever heard.  \"You may call me Miss Thompson,\" she said. \"For the present, at any rate. They all do here. It's a pseudonym I have to use.\"  \"A pseudonym?\" Malone said.  \"You see, Mr. Malone,\" Miss Wilson began.  Malone stopped her. \"Don't talk,\" he said. \"I have to concentrate and if you talk I can barely think.\" He took off his hat suddenly, and began twisting the brim in his hands. \"You understand, don't you?\"  The trace of a smile appeared on her face. \"I think I do,\" she said.  \"Now,\" Malone said. \"You're Miss Thompson, but not really, because you have to use a pseudonym.\" He blinked at the little old lady. \"Why?\"  \"Well,\" she said, \"otherwise people would find out about my little secret.\"  \"Your little secret,\" Malone said.  \"That's right,\" the little old lady said. \"I'm immortal, you see.\"  Malone said: \"Oh.\" Then he kept quiet for a long time. It didn't seem to him that anyone in the room was breathing.  He said: \"Oh,\" again, but it didn't sound any better than it had the first time. He tried another phrase. \"You're immortal,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" the little old lady agreed sweetly.  There was only one other question to ask, and Malone set his teeth grimly and asked it. It came out just a trifle indistinct, but the little old lady nodded.  \"My real name?\" she said. \"Elizabeth. Elizabeth Tudor, of course. I used to be Queen.\"  \"Of England,\" Malone said faintly. \"Malone, look--\" Boyd began.  \"Let me get it all at once,\" Malone told him. \"I'm strong. I can take it.\" He twisted his hat again and turned back to the little old lady.  \"You're immortal, and you're not really Miss Thompson, but Queen Elizabeth I?\" he said slowly.  \"That's right,\" she said. \"How clever of you. Of course, after little Jimmy--cousin Mary's boy, I mean--said I was dead and claimed the Throne, I decided to change my name and all. And that's what I did. But I am Elizabeth Regina.\" She smiled, and her eyes twinkled merrily. Malone stared at her for a long minute.  _Burris_, he thought, _is going to love this._  \"Oh, I'm so glad,\" the little old lady said. \"Do your really think he will? Because I'm sure I'll like your Mr. Burris, too. All of you FBI men are so charming. Just like poor, poor Essex.\"  Well, Malone told himself, that was that. He'd found himself a telepath.  And she wasn't an imbecile.  Oh, no. That would have been simple.  Instead, she was battier than a cathedral spire.                                * * * * *  The long silence was broken by the voice of Miss Wilson.  \"Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"You've been thinking.\" She stopped. \"I mean, you've been so quiet.\"  \"I like being quiet,\" Malone said patiently. \"Besides--\" He stopped and turned to the little old lady. _Can you really read my mind?_ he thought deliberately. After a second he added: ... _your Majesty?_  \"How sweet of you, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"Nobody's called me that for centuries. But of course I can. Although it's not reading, really. After all, that would be like asking if I can read your voice. Of course I can, Mr. Malone.\"  \"That does it,\" Malone said. \"I'm not a hard man to convince. And when I see the truth, I'm the first one to admit it, even if it makes me look like a nut.\" He turned back to the little old lady. \"Begging your pardon,\" he said.  \"Oh, my,\" the little old lady said. \"I really don't mind at all. Sticks and stones, you know, can break my bones. But being called nuts, Mr. Malone, can never hurt me. After all, it's been so many years--so many hundreds of years--\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said easily.  Boyd broke in. \"Listen, Malone,\" he said. \"Do you mind telling me what the hell is going on?\"  \"It's very simple,\" Malone said. \"Miss Thompson here--pardon me; I mean Queen Elizabeth I--really is a telepath. That's all. I think I want to lie down somewhere until it goes away.\"  \"Until what goes away?\" Miss Wilson said.  Malone stared at her almost without seeing her, if not quite. \"Everything,\" he said. He closed his eyes.  \"My goodness,\" the little old lady said after a second. \"Everything's so confused. Poor Mr. Malone is terribly shaken up by everything.\" She stood up, still holding her knitting, and went across the room. Before the astonished eyes of the doctor and nurse, and Tom Boyd, she patted the FBI agent on the shoulder. \"There, there, Mr. Malone,\" she said. \"It will all be perfectly all right. You'll see.\" Then she returned to her seat.  Malone opened his eyes. \"My God,\" he said. He closed them again but they flew open as if of their own accord. He turned to Dr. Harman. \"You called up Boyd here,\" he said, \"and told him that--er--Miss Thompson was a telepath. How'd you know?\"  \"It's all right,\" the little old lady put in from her chair. \"I don't mind your calling me Miss Thompson, not right now, anyhow.\"  \"Thanks,\" Malone said faintly.  Dr. Harman was blinking in a kind of befuddled astonishment. \"You mean she really _is_ a--\" He stopped and brought his tenor voice to a squeaking halt, regained his professional poise, and began again. \"I'd rather not discuss the patient in her presence, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"If you'll just come into my office--\"  \"Oh, _bosh_, Dr. Harman,\" the little old lady said primly. \"I do wish you'd give your own Queen credit for some ability. Goodness knows you think _you're_ smart enough.\"  \"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" he said in what was obviously his best Grade A Choice Government Inspected couchside manner. \"Don't--\"  \"--upset yourself,\" she finished for him. \"Now, really, Doctor. I know what you're going to tell them.\"  \"But Miss Thompson, I--\"  \"You didn't honestly think I _was_ a telepath,\" the little old lady said. \"Heavens, we know that. And you're going to tell them how I used to say I could read minds--oh, years and years ago. And because of that you thought it might be worthwhile to tell the FBI about me-- which wasn't very kind of you, Doctor, before you know anything about why they wanted somebody like me.\"  \"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" Miss Wilson said, walking across the room to put an arm around the little old lady's shoulder. Malone wished for one brief second that he were the little old lady. Maybe if he were a patient in the hospital he would get the same treatment.  He wondered if he could possibly work such a deal.  Then he wondered if it would be worthwhile, being nuts. But of course it would. He was nuts anyhow, wasn't he?  Sure, he told himself. They were all nuts.  \"Nobody's going to hurt you,\" Miss Wilson said. She was talking to the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22338"],["title","The Impossibles (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note:  This etext was produced from the 1963 book publication of the story.

Janifer) Phillips (Randall Philip Garrett) has, or have, undergone several changes. In order to keep the reader posted on the latest developments regarding this author, or these authors, he, or they, has, or have, passed on the following details:  GARRETT is still engaged. He and his charming fiancee plan to run out of excuses during the early Fall of 1994, but this date may be changed at any time by mutual agreement, or the end of the world. He has given up an interest in river pollution in favor of a new hobby, grading type-cleaner. Garrett, who spends an hour each day expanding his repertoire, now claims the ability to distinguish year and vineyard for over one thousand type-cleaners.  JANIFER is still on the other hand. He has had his eyeglasses cleaned, and is happy to report that he has recently met a woman. The woman, however, seems to have been looking for a man. Janifer's hobbies, humming and blinking, remain constant, but in an effort to add more healthful activity to his life he has begun training in leaping to conclusions. He states that he can now clear a conclusion of better than seven feet, eight and one-half inches from a running start.  THE IMPOSSIBLES was written in six days. On the seventh day, nothing of any interest whatsoever occurred.

Malone lay curled on it, thinking about nothing at all. He was drifting off into a wonderful dream, and he didn't want to interrupt it. There was this girl, a beautiful girl, more wonderful than anything he had ever imagined, with big blue eyes and long blonde hair and a figure that made the average pin-up girl look like a man. And she had her soft white hand on his arm, and she was looking, up at him with trust and devotion and even adoration in her eyes, and her voice was the softest possible whisper of innocence and promise.  \"I'd love to go up to your apartment with you, Mr. Malone,\" she said.  Malone smiled back at her, gently but with complete confidence. \"Call me Ken,\" he said, noticing that he was seven feet tall and superbly muscled. He put his free hand on the girl's warm, soft shoulder and she wriggled with delight.  \"All right--Ken,\" she said. \"You know, I've never met anyone like you before. I mean, you're so wonderful and everything.\"  Malone chuckled modestly, realizing, in passing, how full and rich his voice had become. He felt a weight pressing over his heart, and knew that it was his wallet, stuffed to bursting with thousand-dollar bills.  But was this a time to think of money?  No, Malone told himself. This was the time for adventure, for romance, for love. He looked down at the girl and put his arm around her waist. She snuggled closer.  He led her easily down the long wide street to his car at the end of the block. It stood in godlike solitude, a beautiful red Cadillac capable of going a hundred and ten miles an hour in any gear, equipped with fully automatic steering and braking, and with a stereophonic radio, a hi-fi and a 3-D set installed in both front and back seats. It was a 1972 job, but he meant to trade it in on something even better when the 1973 models came out. In the meantime, he decided, it would do.  He handed the girl in, went round to the other side and slid in under the wheel. There was soft music playing somewhere, and a magnificent sunset appeared ahead of them as Malone pushed a button on the dashboard and the red Cadillac started off down the wide, empty, wonderfully paved street into the sunset, while he... The red Cadillac?  The sidewalk became a little harder, and, Malone suddenly realized that he was lying on it. Something terrible had happened; he knew that right away. He opened his eyes to look for the girl, but the sunset had become much brighter; his head began to pound with the slow regularity of a dead-march, and he closed his eyes again in a hurry.  The sidewalk swayed a little, but he managed to keep his balance on it somehow; and after a couple of minutes it was quiet again. His head hurt. Maybe that was the terrible thing that had happened, but Malone wasn't quite sure. As a matter of fact, he wasn't very sure about anything, and he started to ask himself questions to make certain he was all there.  He didn't feel all there. He felt as if several of his parts had been replaced with second- or even third-hand experimental models, and something had happened to the experiment. It was even hard to think of any questions, but after a while he managed to come up with a few.  _What is your name?_  Kenneth Malone.  _Where do you live?_  Washington, D. C.  _What is your work?_  I work for the FBI.  _Then what the hell are you doing on a sidewalk in New York in broad daylight?_  He tried to find an answer to that, but there didn't seem to be any, no matter where he looked. The only thing he could think of was the red Cadillac.  And if the red Cadillac had anything to do with anything, Malone didn't know about it.  Very slowly and carefully, he opened his eyes again, one at a time. He discovered that the light was not coming from the gorgeous Hollywood sunset he had dreamed up. As a matter of fact, sunset was several hours in the past, and it never looked very pretty in New York anyhow. It was the middle of the night, and Malone was lying under a convenient street lamp.  He closed his eyes again and waited patiently for his head to go away.  A few minutes passed. It was obvious that his head had settled down for a long stay, and no matter how bad it felt, Malone told himself, it _was_ his head, after all. He felt a certain responsibility for it. And he couldn't just leave it lying around somewhere with its eyes closed.  He opened the head's eyes once more, and this time he kept them open. For a long time he stared at the post of the street lamp, considering it, and he finally decided that it looked sturdy enough to support a hundred and sixty-five pounds of FBI man, even with the head added in. He grabbed for the post with both hands and started to pull himself upright, noticing vaguely that his legs had somehow managed to get underneath him.  As soon as he was standing, he wished he'd stayed on the nice horizontal sidewalk. His head was spinning dizzily, and his mind was being sucked down into the whirlpool. He held on to the post grimly and tried to stay conscious.  A long time, possibly two or three seconds, passed. Malone hadn't moved at all when the two cops came along.  One of them was a big man with a brassy voice and a face that looked as if it had been overbaked in a waffle iron. He came up behind Malone and tapped him on the shoulder, but Malone barely felt the touch. Then the cop bellowed into Malone's ear: \"What's the matter, buddy?\"  Malone appreciated the man's sympathy. It was good to know that you had friends. But he wished, remotely, that the cop and his friend, a shorter and thinner version of the beat patrolman, would go away and leave him in peace. Maybe he could lie down on the sidewalk again and get a couple of hundred years' rest.  Who could tell? \"Mallri,\" he said.  \"You're all right?\" the big cop said. \"That's fine. That's great. So why don't you go home and sleep it off?\"  \"Sleep?\" Malone said. \"Home?\"  \"Wherever you live, buddy,\" the big cop said. \"Come on. Can't stand around on the sidewalk all night.\"  Malone shook his head, and decided at once never to do it again. He had some kind of rare disease, he realized. His brain was loose, and the inside of his skull was covered with sandpaper. Every time his head moved, the brain jounced against some of the sandpaper.  But the policemen thought he was drunk. That wasn't right. He couldn't let the police get the wrong impression of FBI agents. Now the men would go around telling people that the FBI was always drunk and disorderly.  \"Not drunk,\" he said clearly.  \"Sure,\" the big cop said. \"You're fine. Maybe just one too many, huh?\"  \"No,\" Malone said. The effort exhausted him, and he had to catch his breath before he could say anything else. But the cops waited patiently. At last he said, \"Somebody slugged me.\"  \"Slugged?\" the big cop said.  \"Right.\" Malone remembered just in time not to nod his head.  \"How about a description, buddy?\" the big cop said.  \"Didn't see him,\" Malone said. He let go of the post with one hand, keeping a precarious grip with the other. He stared at his watch. The hands danced back and forth, but he focused on them after a while. It was 1:05. \"Happened just--a few minutes ago,\" he said. \"Maybe you can catch him.\"  The big cop said, \"Nobody around here. The place is deserted--except for you, buddy.\" He paused and then added: \"Let's see some identification, huh? Or did he take your wallet?\"  Malone thought about getting the wallet, and decided against it. The motions required would be a little tricky, and he wasn't sure he could manage them without letting go of the post entirely. At last he decided to let the cop get his wallet. \"Inside coat pocket,\" he said.  The other policeman blinked and looked up. His face was a studied blank. \"Hey, buddy,\" he said. \"You know you got blood on your head?\"  \"Be damned,\" the big cop said. \"Sam's right. You're bleeding, mister.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said.   The big cop said, \"Huh?\"  \"I thought maybe my skull was going to explode from high blood pressure,\" Malone said. It was beginning to be a little easier to talk. \"But as long as there's a slow leak, I"]]]
