My cabin door, with all its flowers, was still profusely gay, As when I lightly sported there, in childhood's careless day! But trees that were as sapling twigs, with broad and shadowing bough, Around the well-known threshhold spread a freshening coolness now.  The birds whose notes I used to hear, were shouting on the earth, As if to greet me back again with their wild strains of mirth; My own bright stream was at my feet, and how I laughed to lave My burning lip, and cheek, and brow, in that delicious wave!  My boy, my first-born babe, had died amid his early hours, And there we laid him to his sleep among the clustering flowers; Yet lo! without my cottage-door he sported in his glee, With her whose grave is far from his, beneath yon linden tree.  I sprang to snatch them to my soul; when breathing out my name, To grasp my hand, and press my lip, a crowd of loved ones came! Wife, parents, children, kinsmen, friends! the dear and lost ones all, With blessed words of welcome came, to greet me from my thrall.  Forms long unseen were by my side; and thrilling on my ear, Came cadences from gentle tones, unheard for many a year; And on my cheeks fond lips were pressed, with true affection's kiss-- And so ye waked me from my sleep--but 'twas a dream of bliss!     SONG OF THE COFFLE GANG.[2]  [Footnote 2: This song is said to be sung by Slaves, as they are chained in gangs, when parting from friends for the far off South--children taken from parents, husbands from wives, and brothers from sisters.]  Words by the Slaves. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]    See these poor souls from Africa,   Transported to America; We are stolen, and sold to Georgia, will you go along with me? We are stolen and sold to Georgia, go sound the jubilee.    See wives and husbands sold apart,   The children's screams!--it breaks my heart; There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me? There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.    O gracious Lord! when shall it be,   That we poor souls shall all be free? Lord, break them Slavery powers--will you go along with me? Lord, break them Slavery powers, go sound the jubilee.    Dear Lord! dear Lord! when Slavery'll cease,   Then we poor souls can have our peace; There's a better day a coming, will you go along with me? There's a better day a coming, go sound the jubilee.     HARK! I HEAR A SOUND OF ANGUISH.  Air, \"Calvary.\"   [Music]  Hark! I hear a sound of anguish   In my own, my native land; Brethren, doomed in chains to languish,   Lift to heaven the suppliant hand,           And despairing,           And despairing,   Death the end of woe demand.  Let us raise our supplication   For the wretched suffering slave, All whose life is desolation,   All whose hope is in the grave;           God of mercy!   From thy throne, O hear and save.  Those in bonds we would remember   As if we with them were bound; For each crushed, each suffering member   Let our sympathies abound,           Till our labors   Spread the smiles of freedom round.  Even now the word is spoken;   \"Slavery's cruel power must cease, From the bound the chain be broken,   Captives hail the kind release,\"           While in splendor   Comes to reign the Prince of Peace.     BROTHERS BE BRAVE FOR THE PINING SLAVE.  Air--\"Sparkling and Bright.\"   [Music]  Solo.  Heavy and cold in his dungeon hold,   Is the yoke of the oppressor; Dark o'er the soul is the fell control   Of the stern and dread transgressor.  Chorus.      Oh then come all to bring the thrall       Up from his deep despairing,     And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,       Retake the prey he's tearing:     O then come all to bring the thrall       Up from his deep despairing,     And out of the jaw of the bandit's law,       Retake the prey he's tearing.  Brothers be brave for the pining slave,   From his wife and children riven; From every vale their bitter wail   Goes sounding up to Heaven.     Then for the life of that poor wife,       And for those children pining;     O ne'er give o'er till the chains no more       Around their limbs are twining.  Gloomy and damp is the low rice swamp,   Where their meagre bands are wasting; All worn and weak, in vain they seek   For rest, to the cool shade hasting;     For drivers fell, like fiends from hell,       Cease not their savage shouting;     And the scourge's crack, from quivering back,       Sends up the red blood spouting.  Into the grave looks only the slave,   For rest to his limbs aweary; His spirit's light comes from that night,   To us so dark and dreary.     That soul shall nurse its heavy curse       Against a day of terror,     When the lightning gleam of his wrath shall stream       Like fire, on the hosts of error.  Heavy and stern are the bolts which burn   In the right hand of Jehovah; To smite the strong red arm of wrong,   And dash his temples over;     Then on amain to rend the chain,       Ere bursts the vallied thunder;     Right onward speed till the slave is freed--       His manacles torn asunder.  E.D.H.     THE QUADROON MAIDEN.  Words by Longfellow. Theme from the Indian Maid.   [Music]  The Slaver in the broad lagoon,   Lay moored with idle sail; He waited for the rising moon,   And for the evening gale.  The Planter under his roof of thatch,   Smoked thoughtfully and slow; The Slaver's thumb was on the latch,   He seemed in haste to go.  He said, \"My ship at anchor rides   In yonder broad lagoon; I only wait the evening tides,   And the rising of the moon.\"  Before them, with her face upraised,   In timid attitude, Like one half curious, half amazed,   A Quadroon maiden stood.  And on her lips there played a smile   As holy, meek, and faint, As lights, in some cathedral aisle,   The features of a saint.  \"The soil is barren, the farm is old,\"   The thoughtful Planter said, Then looked upon the Slaver's gold,   And then upon the maid.  His heart within him was at strife,   With such accursed gains; For he knew whose passions gave her life,   Whose blood ran in her veins.  But the voice of nature was too weak:   He took the glittering gold! Then pale as death grew the maiden's cheek,   Her hands as icy cold.  The Slaver led her from the door,   He led her by the hand, To be his slave and paramour   In a far and distant land.     Domestic Bliss.  BY REV. JAMES GREGG.   Domestic bliss; thou fairest flower   That erst in Eden grew, Dear relic of the happy bower,   Our first grand parents knew!  We hail thee in the rugged soil   Of this waste wilderness, To cheer our way and cheat our toil,   With gleams of happiness.  In thy mild light we travel on,   And smile at toil and pain; And think no more of Eden gone,   For Eden won again.  Such, Emily, the bliss, the joy   By Heaven bestowed on you; A husband kind, a lovely boy,   A father fond and true.  Religion adds her cheering beams,   And sanctifies these ties; And sheds o'er all the brighter gleams,   She borrows from the skies.  But ah! reflect; are _all_ thus blest?   Hath home such charms for _all_? Can such delights as these invest   Foul slavery's wretched thrall?  Can those be happy in these ties   Who wear her galling chain? Or taste the blessed charities   That in the household reign?  Can those be blest, whose hope, whose life,   Hang on a tyrant's nod; To whom nor husband, child, nor wife   Are known--yea, scarcely God?  Whose ties may all be rudely riven,   At avarice' fell behest; Whose only hope of _home_ is heaven,   The grave their only rest.  Oh! think of those, the poor, th' oppressed,   In your full hour of bliss; Nor e'er from prayer and effort rest,   While earth bears woe like this.     O PITY THE SLAVE MOTHER.  Words from the Liberator. Air, Araby's Daughter.   [Music]  I pity the slave mother, careworn and weary,   Who sighs as she presses her babe to her breast; I lament her sad fate, all so hopeless and dreary,   I lament for her woes, and her wrongs unredressed. O who can imagine her heart's deep emotion,   As she thinks of her children about to be sold; You may picture the bounds of the rock-girdled ocean,   But the grief of that mother can never be known.  The mildew of slavery has blighted each blossom,   That ever has bloomed in her pathway below; It has froze every fountain that gushed in her bosom,   And chilled her heart's verdure with pitiless woe: Her parents, her kindred, all crushed by oppression;   Her husband still doomed in its desert to stay; No arm to protect from the tyrant's aggression--   She must weep as she treads on her desolate way.  O, slave-mother, hope! see--the nation is shaking!   The arm of the Lord is awake to thy wrong! The slave-holder's heart now with terror is quaking   Salvation and Mercy to Heaven belong! Rejoice, O rejoice! for the child thou art rearing,   May one day lift up its unmanacled form, While hope, to thy heart, like the rain-bow so cheering,   Is born, like the rain-bow, 'mid tempest and storm.     How long! O! how long!   How long will the friend of the slave plead in vain? How long e'er the Christian will loosen the chain? If he, by our efforts, more hardened should be, O Father, forgive him! we trust but in thee. That 'we're all free and equal,' how senseless the cry, While millions in bondage are groaning so nigh! O where is our freedom? equality where? To this none can answer, but echo cries, where?  O'er this stain on our country we'd fain draw a veil, But history's page will proclaim the sad tale, That Christians, unblushing, could shout 'we are free,' Whilst they the oppressors of millions could be. They can feel for themselves, for the Pole they can feel, Towards Afric's children their hearts are like steel; They are deaf to their call, to their wrongs they are blind; In error they slumber nor seek truth to find.  Though scorn and oppression on our pathway attend, Despised and reviled, we the slave will befriend; Our Father, thy blessing! we look but to thee, Nor cease from our labors till"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22089"],["title","The Liberty Minstrel (#3)"],["body","shall be free. Should mobs in their fury with missiles assail, The cause it is righteous, the truth will prevail; Then heed not their clamors, though loud they proclaim That freedom shall slumber, and slavery reign.     THE FUGITIVE SLAVE TO THE CHRISTIAN.  Words by Elizur Wright, jr. Music arranged from Cracovienne.   [Music]  The fetters galled my weary soul,-- A soul that seemed but thrown away; I spurned the tyrant's base control, Resolved at last the man to play:--  Chorus.    The hounds are baying on my track;   O Christian! will you send me back?   The hounds are baying on my track;   O Christian! will you send me back?  I felt the stripes, the lash I saw, Red, dripping with a father's gore; And, worst of all their lawless law, The insults that my mother bore!   The hounds are baying on my track,   O Christian! will you send me back?  Where human law o'errules Divine, Beneath the sheriff's hammer fell My wife and babes,--I call them mine,-- And where they suffer, who can tell?   The hounds are baying on my track,   O Christian! will you send me back?  I seek a home where man is man, If such there be upon this earth, To draw my kindred, if I can, Around its free, though humble hearth.   The hounds are baying on my track,   O Christian! will you send me back!     The Strength of Tyranny.   The tyrant's chains are only strong   While slaves submit to wear them; And, who could bind them on the strong,   Determined not to wear them? Then clank your chains, e'en though the links   Were light as fashion's feather: The heart which rightly feels and thinks   Would cast them altogether.  The lords of earth are only great   While others clothe and feed them! But what were all their pride and state   Should labor cease to heed them? The swain is higher than a king:   Before the laws of nature, The monarch were a useless thing,   The swain a useless creature.  We toil, we spin, we delve the mine,   Sustaining each his neighbor; And who can hold a right divine   To rob us of our labor? We rush to battle--bear our lot   In every ill and danger-- And who shall make the peaceful cot   To homely joy a stranger?  Perish all tyrants far and near,   Beneath the chains that bind us; And perish too that servile fear   Which makes the slaves they find us: One grand, one universal claim--   One peal of moral thunder-- One glorious burst in Freedom's name,   And rend our bonds asunder!     THE BLIND SLAVE BOY.  Words by Mrs. Dr. Bailey. Music arranged from Sweet Afton.   [Music]  Come back to me mother! why linger away From thy poor little blind boy, the long weary day! I mark every footstep, I list to each tone, And wonder my mother should leave me alone! There are voices of sorrow, and voices of glee, But there's no one to joy or to sorrow with me; For each hath of pleasure and trouble his share, And none for the poor little blind boy will care.  My mother, come back to me! close to thy breast Once more let thy poor little blind one be pressed; Once more let me feel thy warm breath on my cheek, And hear thee in accents of tenderness speak! O mother! I've no one to love me--no heart Can bear like thine own in my sorrows a part, No hand is so gentle, no voice is so kind, Oh! none like a mother can cherish the blind!  Poor blind one! No mother thy wailing can hear, No mother can hasten to banish thy fear; For the slave-owner drives her, o'er mountain and wild, And for one paltry dollar hath sold thee, poor child! Ah! who can in language of mortals reveal The anguish that none but a mother can feel, When man in his vile lust of mammon hath trod On her child, who is stricken and smitten of God!  Blind, helpless, forsaken, with strangers alone, She hears in her anguish his piteous moan; As he eagerly listens--but listens in vain, To catch the loved tones of his mother again! The curse of the broken in spirit shall fall On the wretch who hath mingled this wormwood and gall, And his gain like a mildew shall blight and destroy, Who hath torn from his mother the little blind boy!     SLAVE'S WRONGS.  Words by Miss Chandler. Arranged from \"Rose of Allandale.\"   [Music]  With aching brow and wearied limb,   The slave his toil pursued; And oft I saw the cruel scourge   Deep in his blood imbrued; He tilled oppression's soil where men   For liberty had bled, And the eagle wing of Freedom waved   In mockery, o'er his head.  The earth was filled with the triumph shout   Of men who had burst their chains; But his, the heaviest of them all,   Still lay on his burning veins; In his master's hall there was luxury,   And wealth, and mental light; But the very book of the Christian law,   Was hidden from his sight.  In his master's halls there was wine and mirth,   And songs for the newly free; But his own low cabin was desolate   Of all but misery. He felt it all--and to bitterness   His heart within him turned; While the panting wish for liberty,   Like a fire in his bosom burned.  The haunting thought of his wrongs grew changed   To a darker and fiercer hue, Till the horrible shape it sometimes wore   At last familiar grew; There was darkness all within his heart,   And madness in his soul; And the demon spark, in his bosom nursed,   Blazed up beyond control.  Then came a scene! oh! such a scene!   I would I might forget The ringing sound of the midnight scream,   And the hearth-stone redly wet! The mother slain while she shrieked in vain   For her infant's threatened life; And the flying form of the frighted child,   Struck down by the bloody knife.  There's many a heart that yet will start   From its troubled sleep, at night, As the horrid form of the vengeful slave   Comes in dreams before the sight. The slave was crushed, and his fetters' link   Drawn tighter than before; And the bloody earth again was drenched   With the streams of his flowing gore.  Ah! know they not, that the tightest band   Must burst with the wildest power?-- That the more the slave is oppressed and wronged,   Will be fiercer his rising hour? They may thrust him back with the arm of might,   They may drench the earth with his blood-- But the best and purest of their own,   Will blend with the sanguine flood.  I could tell thee more--but my strength is gone,   And my breath is wasting fast; Long ere the darkness to-night has fled,   Will my life from the earth have passed: But this, the sum of all I have learned,   Ere I go I will tell to thee;-- If tyrants would hope for tranquil hearts,   They must let the oppressed go free.     MY CHILD IS GONE.  Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  Hark! from the winds a voice of woe, The wild Atlantic in its flow, Bears on its breast the murmur low,           My child is gone!  Like savage tigers o'er their prey, They tore him from my heart away; And now I cry, by night by day--           My child is gone!  How many a free-born babe is press'd With fondness to its mother's breast, And rocked upon her arms to rest,           While mine is gone!  No longer now, at eve I see, Beneath the sheltering plantain tree, My baby cradled on my knee,           For he is gone!  And when I seek my cot at night, There's not a thing that meets my sight, But tells me that my soul's delight,           My child, is gone!  I sink to sleep, and then I seem To hear again his parting scream I start and wake--'tis but a dream--           My child _is_ gone!  Gone--till my toils and griefs are o'er, And I shall reach that happy shore, Where negro mothers cry no more--           My child is gone!     COMFORT IN AFFLICTION.  Words by William Leggett. Music by G.W.C.   [Music]  If yon bright stars which gem the night,   Be each a blissful dwelling sphere, Where kindred spirits reunite   Whom death has torn asunder here, How sweet it were at once to die,   And leave this blighted orb afar! Mix soul with soul to cleave the sky,   And soar away from star to star!  But oh! how dark, how drear, how lone,   Would seem the brightest world of bliss, If, wandering through each radiant one,   We failed to find the loved of this!  If there no more the ties should twine,   Which Death's cold hand alone can sever, Ah! then those stars in mockery shine,   More hateful as they shine forever!  It cannot be--each hope and fear,   That lights the eye or clouds the brow, Proclaims there is a happier sphere   Than this bleak world that holds us now!  There is a voice which sorrow hears,   When heaviest weighs life's galling chain, 'Tis heaven that whispers, \"dry thy tears,   The pure in heart shall meet again.\"     The Poor Little Slave.  FROM \"THE CHARTER OAK.\"   O pity the poor little slave,   Who labors hard through all the day--     And has no one,     When day is done,   To teach his youthful heart to pray.  No words of love--no fond embrace--   No smiles from parents kind and dear;     No tears are shed     Around his bed,   When fevers rage, and death is near.  None feel for him when heavy chains   Are fastened to his tender limb;     No pitying eyes,     No sympathies,   No prayers are raised to heaven for him.  Yes I will pity the poor slave,   And pray that he may soon be free;     That he at last,     When days are past,   In heaven may have his liberty.     THE BEREAVED MOTHER.  Words by Jesse Hutchinson. Air, \"Kathleen O'Moore.\"   [Music]  Oh deep was the anguish of the slave mother's heart, When called from her darling for ever to part; So grieved that lone mother, that heart broken mother,           In sorrow and woe.  The lash of the master her deep sorrows mock, While the child of her bosom is sold on the block; Yet loud shrieked that mother, poor heart broken mother,           In sorrow and woe.  The babe in return, for its fond mother cries, While the sound of their wailings together arise; They shriek for each other, the child and the mother,           In sorrow and woe.  The harsh auctioneer to sympathy cold, Tears the babe from its mother and sells it for gold; While the infant and mother, loud shriek for each other,           In sorrow and woe.  At last came the"]]]
