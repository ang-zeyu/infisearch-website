He had been living in luxury for some time, while I was broke almost continually. I kicked and refused to give up. Then he had the insolence to threaten me with exposure. I lost my head and choked him. Directly after that he turned like a viper and blowed everything to Merriwell. That was my downfall. I had to skip. Is there any reason why I should not hate the sneak?\"  \"No, I do not wonder that you are sore on him; but he did not make anything out of the trick.\"  \"Didn't make anything! Why, he forced me out of college!\"  \"That was not the main thing he was looking for.\"  \"Then what was?\"  \"He hoped to get in with Merriwell, and he fancied Merriwell would think him a fine fellow for blowing.\"  \"Well?\"  \"Well, he made a mistake in Frank Merriwell, for Merriwell despised him all the more, although he did nothing to injure Ditson. He does not recognize Ditson at all, and now Ditson is more eager than before to do Merriwell an injury.\"  \"All the same, Ditson can't be trusted.\"  \"Not unless he is so deep in the game that it means ruin for him to blow. Then he is caught. As I said in the first place, he is a good man to do the dirty work that we do not want to touch.\"  \"I think Harris is right,\" nodded Harlow, \"and you may get a chance to even up with Ditson by throwing him down when we have fixed Merriwell nicely.\"  \"But you want to remember you are going up against a bad man in Frank Merriwell,\" warned Sport. \"I do not care to be forced out of Yale.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Hartwick and Harlow.  \"You fellows have not so much to look out for. You can do things that would be beyond me.\"  \"We made a bluff at doing something to-day,\" growled Hartwick. \"We were out for a drive, and we came upon Merriwell. He was on his new horse, and we tried to run him down, but he got out of the way.\"  \"I don't know but it is a good thing he did,\" confessed Harlow. \"If we had struck him there'd been a general smashup. I was driving, and we were making the old nag hit a hot pace. We came near going bottom up as it was.\"  \"You must have been badly rattled,\" exclaimed Harris.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" laughed Hartwick, harshly. \"We've been up against it for the past three days. Eh, Harlow?\"  \"That's what,\" nodded the card sharp. \"Hartwick is a hard man to follow. He can kill more stuff than anybody I ever saw.\"  \"Well,\" said Harris, \"I have asked Ditson to come in here this evening. I took a chance on it, for I thought we could get rid of him easily enough if we didn't want him. He is liable to be along at any moment.\"  Harlow looked at a handsome watch.  \"A quarter to ten,\" he said. \"He ought to be around soon if he is coming at all.\"  \"He will be. Where'd you get that ticker, old man?\"  \"Oh, I took it off a sucker in a game. I'll have to soak it if I don't strike some sort of graft pretty soon. I'm getting down to hard pan.\"  \"I suppose you are all right, Hartwick?\" questioned Harris. \"You can call on your old man and make him give up any time.\"  \"Well, I guess not! I haven't been able to get a dollar out of the old duffer since I left college. He is icy toward me, and he says I can go it for myself and be hanged.\"  \"That's pleasant! What have you been doing to gather in the coin?\"  \"Why, confound it! haven't I formed a partnership with Harlow! I don't know anything about card tricks, but he works all of that, and I win the money. He gives me the hands to do it on, you see. If there is suspicion aroused, the poor suckers take to watching me, and they are unable to catch me at anything crooked. Our only trouble is to find the right sort of fruit for plucking. We generally pretend we are strangers to each other. Sometimes we have a little disagreement over the table, just to fool the fools all the more.\"  \"That's first-rate,\" laughed Harris. \"I wish the gang here was not onto Harlow. I could get you some ripe plums.\"  \"And that's what made me so sore on Merriwell,\" growled Harlow. \"But for that fellow we'd be right in it now. Oh, I want to soak him some way, and soak him hard!\"  \"And we'll find a way to soak him, too!\" growled Hartwick. \"Let's have another round, fellows.\"  He pushed a button and a waiter appeared. Drinks were ordered. When they were brought, Ditson came in with the waiter.  \"Hello, Roll!\" called Harris. \"Glad you came along. Mr. Ditson, Mr. Harlow. I think you have met the other gentleman.\"  Ditson started and turned pale when he saw Hartwick, who was glowering at him.  \"Oh, yes! Mr. Ditson has met me!\" said Evan, significantly. \"We do not need an introduction!\"  Ditson seemed on the point of getting out in a hurry, but Harris arose and took him by the arm.  \"It's all right,\" he assured. \"Sit down, Roll.\"  \"What sort of a game is this?\" hesitatingly asked Ditson, keeping his eyes on Hartwick. \"Have you fellows got me in here to do me up?\"  \"Nothing of the sort.\"  \"Not but I'd like to do you, and do you good,\" confessed Hartwick, \"but Harris won't have it.\"  \"No,\" said Sport; \"I hold that we are all united by our hatred for a common foe, and we cannot afford to be anything but friends.\"  \"All the same, it was a dirty deal you gave me, Ditson,\" growled Evan, who seemed to be longing to pick a row with the newcomer.  \"You forced me into it,\" declared Ditson, weakly.  \"Forced you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How was that?\"  \"You know well enough. You set on me like a mad tiger, and I'll bet you would have choked me to death in your room if you hadn't been seized with one of your attacks of heart trouble. I was afraid of you, and I had to do something to protect myself.\"  \"So you blew the whole thing to Merriwell! That was a brave trick. But I understand Merriwell has turned you down in great shape since that.\"  \"Well, he hasn't used me right,\" admitted Ditson. \"Sometimes I think I'd like to kick the wind out of him, but I know I can't do it.\"  \"You may have the chance to take the wind out of him,\" said Harris. \"Sit down, old man, and we will talk matters over. What are you drinking?\"  \"Bring me a sherry flip, waiter,\" ordered Ditson, seeing the waiter had paused outside.  Then he sat down in a chair offered him, saying:  \"If there's any sure way of doing Merriwell up, I'm in for it; but I give it to you straight that I am sick of trying to do him and having him come out on top. It's got to be a sure thing this time, or I don't touch it.\"  Beyond a thin partition in a room next to the one occupied by the four plotters sat a man who had a cut and bruised face and a pair of swollen black eyes.  This man had been drinking heavily. A bottle of whiskey and a glass sat on the little table before him. He was alone in the room.  He had seemed to suddenly lose all interest in the whiskey, and he was leaning against the board partition with his ear close to a crack, intently listening to the talk of the four lads in the next room.  The man had heard Frank Merriwell's name spoken, and that was the first thing to attract his attention to what the occupants of the next room were saying.  \"That's the fellow!\" muttered the man, hoarsely. \"He's the one what gave me these beautiful peepers and pretty mug! I'll give him something worse than this before long.\"  Then he decided to listen.  \"Wonder if them chaps is his friends? I'll jest see what they're sayin' about him.\"  It was not long before the man was able to hear enough to satisfy him that the lads in the next room were anything but friends of Frank Merriwell, and he listened with fresh eagerness.  He heard Ditson come in with the waiter, and caught much of the conversation that followed. Then Ditson sat down, and the plotters lowered their voices.  \"That settles it!\" exclaimed the man. \"I'm goin' right in there and see if they don't want to take me inter the gang. Them college ducks will be jest the fellers to help me in gettin' back at Frank Merriwell.\"  He got up, left the little room, and went around to the door of the other room. Without stopping to knock, he opened the door and walked in.  \"H'waryer,\" he saluted, as the four lads stared at him in amazement. \"My name's Mike Hogan, and I want ter join in with ther push.\"  \"Get out of here, you bum!\" cried Hartwick, fiercely. \"You are intruding on a private party.\"  \"Hold hard, young feller!\" returned the fellow who had given his name as Mike Hogan. \"Don't call me a bum! I'm onto your curves, and there ain't no reason why you and me shouldn't be friends.\"  \"Friends!\" exclaimed Hartwick--\"friends! Well, I prefer to choose my friends.\"  \"And you didn't make much of a success when you chose a young gent here what is named Ditson. Keep yer seat!\"  \"Press the button, Harlow, and we'll have this fellow thrown out!\" came savagely from Hartwick's lips.  \"Wait a minute before you press the button,\" urged Mike Hogan. \"Do you see this face?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"It's a peach, now, ain't it?\"  \"You can consider yourself lucky if it isn't worse than that when you get out of here, my man.\"  \"Don't 'my man' me, young feller! I don't like it! Do yer know who give me this face and these two beautiful eyes?\"  \"No, and we----\"  \"Well, I'll tell yer who it was. It was a feller what goes by the name of Frank Merriwell.\"  \"Well, he did a first-class job,\" commented Harris. \"That really looks like some of Merriwell's work.\"  \"He done it,\" nodded Mike. \"Nacherlly I ain't got no love to speak of for him. Well, I was in the room next to this just now, and as I was leanin' against the partition I happened to overhear what you chaps was sayin' in here. From what I heard, I judged you didn't love this Merriwell none to brag about, and I says to myself, 'Mike, if you want to get even, them is the boys to hitch fast to.' Then I got right up and came in here without bein' invited. I hope you'll excuse me, gents, but I couldn't help it under the circumstances. I had a sort of feller-feelin' for you chaps, and I thought mebbe we might arrange some sort of a deal together that would do this Merriwell,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21958"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Races (#5)"],["body"," and do him for keeps. I'm not a chap with much education, but I'll bet anything I can hate just as hard as you fellers, and if there's anybody I hate on the earth, it's Frank Merriwell.  \"There, now, gents, you have heard what I have ter say, and I hope you'll tumble ter ther fact that I am on the level. This is no case of stringing. I want ter pay back that feller for these two black eyes and this mug. Mebbe you can help me to do it, and I can help you to square yerselves with him at the same time. If that is right, why shouldn't we kinder go into partnerships for a short period? I put the question to yer, and you can do as ye please.\"  The quartet at the table looked at one another inquiringly and doubtingly. They seemed to hesitate.  \"If this man tells the truth, and I should judge that he does, he may be of service to us and we to him,\" said Sport Harris.  \"That's right,\" nodded Harlow. \"If Merriwell gave him that mug and those beautiful eyes, I don't wonder that he wants to get square.\"  Hartwick was silent. He was looking Mike Hogan over, and he was thinking:  \"Is it possible I have fallen to the point where I have to take such a fellow as a comrade? No! It will not be as a comrade. We can use him as a tool, perhaps, and that is what we will do, if we use him at all.\"  \"Sit down,\" invited Hartwick, suddenly rising and offering Mike his chair. \"I'll get another. I want to hear just how you came by those eyes.\"  Hogan sat down at the table and Hartwick brought a chair from a corner.  \"We are all anxious to hear how you came by those eyes,\" declared Harlow.  \"Some gent order drinks, and I will tell ye. Never mind,\" he cried, as he saw them look at each other knowingly, as if they thought he was trying to work them for liquor, \"I'll order, myself! Don't you think for a second that I'm broke!\"  Then he flung a small roll of bills on the table before them, reached past Harlow, and pressed the button. When the waiter appeared, he said:  \"Give these gents anything they want, Pete.\"  \"Wot if they orders champagne?\" grinned Pete, winking at the boys.  \"Then bring it, dern ye!\" snarled Hogan, as he grabbed up the roll of money and thrust it at the waiter. \"Take the pay out of that and gimme the change.\"  Drinks were ordered and quickly brought. Hogan paid for them and gave the waiter a quarter as a tip.  \"How about it, Pete?\" he asked. \"Am I all right?\"  \"Ye're all right, Mike,\" declared the waiter, promptly; \"and the young gents will find that anything you says sticks.\"  Then he went out.  \"Now,\" said Hogan, \"before I begin I want to tell you chaps this: I'm on the make. That is how I happened to get up against this chap Merriwell. I heard that he paid a cool thousand for that horse of his, and I kinder admitted that a boy who could pay that sum for a horse must be in circumstances that would permit him to burn money in an open grate. Such a chap was worth my attention. I know horses from their hoofs to the tips of their ears. There ain't much of anything I don't know about 'em. And I knew Merriwell must be stuck on the horse for which he paid a thousand plunks.  \"Well, gents, I'll tell ye my scheme. I kinder thought it would be easy to play the horse doctor, and work Merriwell for a good pot. All that was necessary was to make something ail the horse. Then I went round to the stable where he keeps the critter, after I had first learned the name of one of Merriwell's friends. I wanted to get at the horse, and I knew it wouldn't be easy unless I appeared to be on the inside track with Merriwell. I went round and said I was this friend of Merriwell, and in that way I got into the stall with the horse.  \"Don't you care what I done to make that horse lame, but I done it all right. When Merriwell rode out this afternoon the critter went to limpin' under him. When he came back to the stable I was there, but I had changed my clothes and I wore a beard. I introduced myself as a horse doctor, and offered to cure his horse, or not to charge him a dollar. If I cured the critter, which I could do easy, I meant to charge him a hundred dollars, and I thought he'd be fool enough to pay it without a kick.\"  \"That shows you didn't know the kind of a fellow you were trying to fool,\" said Harris.  \"I found that out all right. He wouldn't make any talk with me. Then when I got hot and was going away he suddenly took a notion to stop me. The first thing I knew he had snatched off my hat and beard, and the hostler recognized me as the same chap as was in to see the horse this afternoon.  \"I didn't feel alarmed then,\" Mike went on, \"for Merriwell is a young chap, and I know something about fighting. That is, I thought I knew something about it. I'm not sure about that now. I told him to get out of the way, or I would do him up. I saw my scheme was bu'sted, but I felt sure it'd be some time before he'd find out what ailed his horse.  \"That young fool didn't seem at all scared of me. He wouldn't get out of the way and let me go, but he put himself in my way, and then we had it. When we got through I found that I had it, and I had it bad. There ain't no need to tell just what happened. Take a look at my mug and you'll see for yourself. That young cuss can fight like a tiger!  \"But now I'm goin' to get level with him, and don't you fergit it! I'll make him sorry that he ever gave Mike Hogan a pair of black eyes! I'll never be satisfied till I have done him the worst kind of a turn.  \"I heard you chaps talkin', and it struck me that we might pull together to do him dirt. That's why I came right in. What do you say to it?\"  The boys looked at each other, and then they nodded approval.  \"You'll do,\" said Harris. \"You may prove a very valuable man for us.\"     CHAPTER V.  WHAT A HAIR CAN DO.   At his first opportunity to get away from recitations the following day Frank took Diamond and Rattleton and hastened down to the stable to find out how Nemo was coming along.  Grody, who had just saddled a horse for a gentleman, met Frank, and the expression on his face was anything but reassuring.  \"Well, how is the pony this morning?\" asked Merriwell, anxiously.  \"Just as lame as he were, sir,\" answered Grody. \"I've been tryin' to find out what it were that happened to him, but I can't, sir.\"  \"Did you take him to the shoer the first thing this morning and have his feet examined, as I directed?\"  \"I did that, sir.\"  \"And what did the shoer say?\"  \"He located the lameness in the same foot what we said were lame, sir, and he took off the shoe, but he said as how it were all right, and no fault of the shoeing. He didn't know but a nail might have gone too deep, sir, but he found that were not it.\"  This was anything but satisfactory, and Frank showed it by his face.  \"Well,\" he said, \"you know I told you to summon Dr. Cobb, if it proved something beyond the shoeing.\"  \"And that were what I done, sir.\"  \"And the doctor could not tell what ailed the horse?\"  \"The doctor has not come yet, sir. He were busy when I send the message to him, but he said---- Here he is now, sir.\"  A rig drew up at the door, and a short, stubbed, red-bearded man stepped out. This man entered the stable with a quick step and called to the hostler:  \"Well, Grody, did you telephone me?\"  \"Yes, sir, I did, sir,\" said the hostler, quickly.  \"Important case, you said?\"  \"Yes, sir, very important.\"  \"Where's the horse?\"  \"I'll bring him right out, sir.\"  The hostler hastened to do so, and Dr. Cobb looked keenly at Nemo.  \"Walk him around,\" directed the doctor.  Grody obeyed.  \"Just a bit lame,\" commented the doctor. \"It may be a slight strain. It doesn't seem to be much.\"  \"But it grows worse when he is taken out on the road,\" said Frank. \"It was very bad yesterday afternoon.\"  The doctor glanced at the boy.  \"Your horse?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"When did you first notice he was lame?\"  \"Yesterday afternoon.\"  \"Had him out this morning?\"  \"Grody took him to the shoer, that's all.\"  \"What did he say?\"  \"Said there was nothing the matter with the way Nemo is shod.\"  \"Perhaps he lied. Didn't want to hurt his business. Did he do anything?\"  \"Yes, he reset the shoe on the lame foot.\"  \"Hum! Horse may be all right by to-morrow or next day.\"  \"I do not think he will, doctor.\"  \"Eh? Why not?\"  \"Because I have reasons to believe he was made to go lame.\"  \"Is that so? Well, now the matter becomes more interesting. What causes you to think anything of the sort?\"  Frank explained, and the doctor listened attentively to his story.  \"This is worth investigating,\" he declared. \"I know a few of the tricks of these fellows, and I think I'll find out what was done to your horse, if anything was done.\"  The boys watched the doctor with great interest. They saw him examine the lame leg from the knee down. In doing this he put on a pair of spectacles.  Nemo was nervous. He seemed afraid the doctor would hurt him, and it was not found easy to make him stand.  At last Dr. Cobb uttered a sharp exclamation.  \"Bring my case, which you will find under the seat in my carriage, Grody,\" he directed.  Grody hastened to obey.  \"Have you found out what the matter is, doctor?\" Frank anxiously asked.  \"I believe so, but I am not sure yet.\"  Jack and Harry came near, eager to learn what had been done to lame the horse.  The doctor opened his case, and took out some tweezers.  \"Do you see this hair here?\" he asked, having brushed the fetlock aside and taken the end of a hair in his fingers.  The boys saw it, but wondered what that hair could have to do with the lameness of the horse.  \"It is not the right color,\" declared the doctor. \"You see it is white, instead of being the color of the other hairs here.\"  Despite himself Frank felt his anger rising. How could the color of a hair make the horse lame? Did the man take him for a fool because he was a boy?  The three boys exchanged glances, and Harry made a threatening gesture at the back of the doctor's head.  \"I see the hair is white, sir,\" said Frank, his voice cold"]]]
