A WORD TO THE CHILDREN AND THE WISE  We hope that the children who read this book will like the boys and girls who are in it. They are real, and the good times they have are real, as any boy or girl who has lived out-of-doors will know. And the stories are true. Peter is not always good. But do you expect a child _always_ to be good? We do not. Sometimes, too, the frolics turn in to a scramble to catch a dragon-fly that will not be caught, and there are accidents. Also, Betty and Jack work hard to win a prize which the guide gives to the child who learns most about ants.  Of course it would be impossible for five children to go in search of locusts, grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, dragon-flies, May-flies, leaf-hoppers, lace-wings, caddis-worms, butterflies, beetles, bees, wasps--and so many other six-legged creatures that among them they have wings and legs enough to fill a new Pandora's box--without having a good deal happen. And a good deal does happen. It is all true enough, and every word about the six-legged busybodies is true as true. The other books, too, that come after this in our _Story-Told Science Series_ will be every word true.  And we who wrote this book? Well, we, too, have been children. We used to climb trees and turn somersaults; why--But that is another story! And we remember so well what it used to be like to have to learn dull things we did not wish to know. So we said to ourselves, as we looked over our spectacles at each other, \"No, they sha'n't be told a single uninteresting fact; they sha'n't be dull, poor dears, as we were so long ago, before we put on spectacles and began to call ourselves wise.\"  And so, although we sat down and wrote a book just about long enough for a school-year's work; although we felt very proud because our stories had more wonderful six-legged creatures than any book written for children; although we took pains to have in the book only such little creatures as any one of us could see any day; although we hoped that mothers and teachers would say, \"At last, this is a book the children and I can like and find useful!\" or, \"There, that will help as a starting-point to tell about the bees and the flowers!\" or, \"This story about the flies will teach the children what it means to be clean!\" Although, I say, we hoped all these things, yet our chief hope was that we might give all sorts of children a good time.  So we put our spectacles on and looked very wise, and took a quantity of ink on our pens and began to write. And we wrote and wrote and wrote. And part of the time, while one of us was writing and hoping the stories would be so interesting the children would want to write about them, too, the other was drawing and labelling each sketch so plainly that any child could understand it, even if the ears were quite where they could not be expected to be, or there were more eyes than, seemingly, one creature ought to have, or wings and legs served to make music, as no sensible child could possibly guess.  And now we can't do better than wish you a good time before we say good-bye. We wish you to enjoy all the frolics, to feel how jolly it is to be out-of-doors in the woods and fields and lakes, climbing, canoeing, picnicing, and swimming.  But still more, we hope that you will realize that more wonderful than the most wonderful fairy story ever told is the marvel of the created life of these little insects; we want you to come to know something of their joys and troubles; we want you to learn how to be kind to them, and how they may be useful to you; and we want you to find out for yourselves the places they take in the great plan of creation.  In other words, we want you to think and feel about the lives of these six-legged busybodies, and see for yourselves how much even a butterfly can add to the interest and beauty of living. Does this seem a little bit like a sermon? Well, you see, we forgot we had kept on our spectacles so long, and somehow spectacles always turn into sermons. Perhaps it is because both begin with the letter S.  And now this is all of our short word to the wise. We expect to make each one of our books better than the last, and you can help us to do this by writing any suggestions you may have. We shall be glad to hear from children, big or little.  J. M. and J. M.  South Hadley, Massachusetts, January 27, 1909.       LITTLE BUSYBODIES  I  THE JOURNEY   \"It will be stories all summer, won't it?\" said Betty to her mother.  \"Yes, dear.\"  \"And hunting, too?\" said Jimmie.  \"Hunting with your new gun and hunting with your camera.\"  Jimmie unfastened the case of his new camera and looked in. What a beautiful one it was, and what pictures he meant to take, and how the camera would impress Ben Gile! Jimmie looked about proudly. He knew no other boy in that whole great train had a camera like the one his father had given him.  \"Mother, when will it be lunch?\" asked Betty.  \"Luncheon so soon!\"  \"I'm as hungry as a bear,\" declared Jimmie.  \"And hear Kitty mewing; she's hungry, too.\" Betty looked at the big round basket, whose cover kept restlessly stirring.  \"Did you leave something in the baggage-car for Max to eat?\" Mrs. Reece asked Jimmie.  \"Yes, mum. It's one o'clock; can't we have something now?\"  \"As late as that! No wonder you chickens are hungry for--\"  \"Chicken!\" squealed Betty.  \"And ham sandwiches!\" added Jimmie.  \"And chocolate cake!\"  \"And root-beer!\"  \"And peppermints!\"  \"Ssh!\" said Mrs. Reece, \"or every one in the car will know what little piggies you are. Ask Lizzie for the basket.\"  [Illustration: _A._ Outer wing of locust. _B._ Inner wing of locust. _C._ Sideview of locust.    _a._ Antenna.    _b._ Simple eye.    _c._ Compound eye.    _d._ Thorax.    _e._ Abdomen.    _f._ Breathing pore.    _g._ Ear. _D._ Hind leg of locust.]  Every minute the air was growing cooler. The children could smell the pine woods, and once in a while the train flashed by a great big sawmill, or a lake set like a sapphire in the deep green of the forests. And the hills were rolling nearer and nearer in great shadows. The children ate their luncheon contentedly, looking out of the windows and thinking of the mountains there would be to climb, the ponds, the streams to fish, the pictures to take, and the stories they were to hear the summer long.  \"Mother,\" said Betty, eating her second piece of chocolate cake--\"mother, what will Ben Gile tell us this summer?\"  \"Let me see,\" said her mother, \"perhaps it will be about the little creatures--grasshoppers and katydids, butterflies and bees.\"  \"Goody!\"  \"Pooh!\" said Jimmie, \"I don't see what you want to know of those old things. I'd much rather hear about porcupines. There isn't anything to say about a grasshopper except that it hops.\"  \"Isn't there, my son? Well, that shows that you don't use your eyes. Suppose some one said there was nothing to say about you except that you whistle?\"  \"Well, what is there about an old grasshopper, anyhow?\"  \"I don't know, but Ben will.\"  \"But tell us"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],["title","Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#1)"],["body","ing, mum,\" urged Jimmie, who loved his mother dearly, and was certain she knew more than anybody else, in part because she had been to college, but chiefly because she was his mother.  \"Let me see,\" said Mrs. Reece, \"I shall have to think about it.\" Both of the children came as close to her as they could, while she continued:  \"What a strange world it would be if there were no insects in it! We should have no little crickets chirping in the sunny fields or in the dark corners and cracks of our houses. There would be no katydids singing all night, no clacking of the locusts in the tall grass along dusty roads, no drowsy hum of bees. There would be no little ants and big ants digging out underground tunnels and carrying the grains of sand as far from their doorways as possible. There would be no brightly colored moths and butterflies flitting from flower to flower. We should find no sparkling fairy webs spun anew for us every morning.\"  \"But, mother, all these creatures aren't insects,\" said Jimmie.  \"Yes, they are, dear. It is hard to believe that they all belong to the same family called insecta, but they do.\"  \"Mother, what's that word mean?\"  \"It doesn't mean anything more than cut up into parts. You see, Betty, all these insect bodies are made up of separate rings joined nicely together. If you look carefully you will find that behind the head there is another distinct part. This is called the thorax, which means chest. Behind that there is a pointed part of the body, which is called the abdomen. Then, if you look again, you will see that all these little creatures are alike in that they have six jointed legs.\"  \"And are they all good, like the bee and the butterfly?\" asked Betty, who wasn't always a good little girl herself, and who thought it would be much nicer if insects were naughty sometimes.  \"Not all, dear,\" answered Mrs. Reece; \"some do us real service, but others are troublesome; insects are such hungry little fellows, and they don't have chocolate cake every day to keep them from getting hungry. They are hungry when they are babies and hungry when they grow up. Some eat all they can see--like a little boy I know--and some prefer the tender leaves and twigs. Some care only for the sweet sap flowing into the new leaves and buds. And still others like best the tender new roots of plants.\"  \"Mother, what are the baddest ones?\" asked Betty.  \"Pooh! I know,\" said Jimmie; \"the beetles are, because they eat everything. Why, they'd eat the buttons off your coat or the nose off your face or--\"  \"Jim! Jim! do tell the truth! The beetles, and bugs, too, are the most troublesome. Many of the bugs are such tiny little creatures that it is hard to realize that they can hurt a plant. But bugs have sucking beaks. With these beaks they bore into the leaves or the buds of the plant, and then by means of tiny muscles at the back of the mouth they pump up the sap. To be sure, one little pump could do no harm; but think of millions of little sucking beaks, millions of little pumps busy at work on a single plant! Do you remember the pansies mother had in the winter, and how they were all covered by green plant-lice? Well, those are bugs called aphids. You remember they were pale green, just the color of the plant, and so transparent and soft they looked most harmless. The scale insects are very troublesome, too, but mother doesn't know anything about them.\"  \"Oh, I know what _they_ are,\" announced Jimmie, \"they get into the fruit trees.\"  \"And sometimes onto shrubs, too. Mother has heard of a scale insect out in California which has been a great nuisance to fruit-growers. A certain ladybug finds this cottony-cushion scale a tender morsel, so many ladybugs were taken out there to help the owners of the fruit farms get rid of the scale.\"  \"Did they carry them all the way out, mother?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Jimmie; \"they got a Pullman car for them, and Mr. and Mrs. Ladybug and family travelled in style.\"  \"Mother, tell Jim to be still.\" Betty, not unlike other little sisters, hated to be teased by her brother.  \"And now, let me see,\" said Mrs. Reece. \"I don't know that I can tell you any more until I know more myself. Yes, I do know what baby beetles are called. They are called grubs, and they live in the ground until it is time for them to turn into grown-up beetles. While they are babies they eat as much and as fast as they can, as no baby but a beetle should. The more they eat the sooner they come out into the bright world as a June-bug or some other kind of beetle. They eat all the tender little roots they can find. This is very nice--\"  \"For Mary Ann, but rather hard on Abraham.\"  \"You horrid boy,\" said Betty, \"you don't even let me hear a story in peace! It's very nice what, mother?\"  \"It's very nice for the little grubs, but it's rather hard on the plants, for if too many roots are nibbled away the plants die. The caterpillars are great eaters, too.\"  Betty leaned over and whispered something to her mother; then they both giggled.  \"I know what you're saying,\" said Jimmie, but after that he was quieter.  \"Sometimes a caterpillar will thrive on just one kind of a plant; it may be carrot, it may be milkweed. On that it feeds until it has grown as large as possible. Then it spins itself a nice silken cocoon, or rolls itself up in a soft leaf and takes a long, long nap. And now it is time for us to take a nap, too, for we shall soon reach Bemis, and then there will be still two long lakes to cross and a carry to walk.\"     II  RANGELEY VILLAGE   The next morning great was the stir in the town, for it was known by the village children that Betty and Jimmie had come, and by the grown-ups that Mrs. Reece was there. All winter long the children had looked forward to their coming, for it meant jolly times: picnics, parties, expeditions, and games. Then, too, Ben Gile would begin to tell them wonderful things. Through the winter he had been teaching school, and it was only when the ice broke up in the big lake and the beavers decided to stop sleeping that Ben Gile came back to his guiding.  There was great excitement about Turtle Lodge. Lizzie kept flying out with rugs, and then forgetting they hadn't been brushed and flying in again. The cat was playing croquet with the balls and spools of an open work-basket, and Max had discovered an old straw hat which tasted very good to him. Only Mrs. Reece kept her head and stayed indoors, moving about quietly from room to room, putting the house in that beautiful order which little children never think about.  Out on the grass that sloped down to the street, which, in its turn, tumbled head over heels down to the lake, Betty and Jimmie were playing with their playmates. They were all so wild with joy that every time Jimmie saw another boy he shouted, \"Come over!\" when the boy was coming, anyway, just as fast as he could.  Up, up from the foot of the lake climbed an old man; up, up, up the steep street he came, his white hair shaking and shining in the brisk June breeze, his long, white beard caught every once in a while by the wind and tossed sideways.  \"Mother,\" called Jimmie, \"Ben Gile is coming!\"  Out came Mrs. Reece to greet the old man.  Then, one by one, the children spoke with Ben Gile.  \"You're having a good time before you can say Jack Robinson, aren't you?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" came in a chorus of voices. Then, \"Tell us a story; tell us a story!\"  [Illustration: _A._ A few facets of the compound eye of an insect. _B._ Brain and nerve cord of an insect.]  \"Not to-day,\" said the old man. \"Why, you want a story before you've had time to turn around.\"  Betty stuck her head out from behind her mother. \"Mother said you would tell us about crickets and moths, and everything.\"  \"Well, well, well,\" murmured the old man, \"did she? But I can't tell a story to-day. I'll tell you, though, something, so that when you come to collect the little creatures you'll know what to do. All sit down.\"  They all sat down cross-legged on the ground, the old man in the middle.  \"Here, you big Jim-boy, catch me that butterfly.\"  There was a wild rush, and the bright wings were soon caught.  \"There, you've torn off one of its legs,\" said the old man.  Jimmie looked troubled. \"I didn't mean to, sir.\"  \"Do you know how it hurts to have your leg torn off, boy? Do you know, children?\"  \"No,\" came in a chorus.  The guide took out a piece of paper and drew a picture on it. \"There, every part of that little fellow's body I've drawn has muscles, such fine muscles no naked eye could ever see them. I'll show them to you under the microscope in my cabin. Those muscles move the body, and each muscle is controlled by threads, still more fine, called nerves.\"  The old man reached out like a flash and pinched Jimmie.  \"Ouch!\" cried the boy, and there was a shout of laughter from the children.  \"You felt that?\"  \"I guess I did,\" said Jim, sulkily.  \"Well, that's because you're made something the same way this butterfly is. When anything hurts us it's because some of our nerves are hurt, and quick as a flash the news travels to the brain, and we try to get away from the thing that causes pain--a pinch, perhaps, or, still worse, the hurt of a poor leg that has been torn off.\"  \"But a butterfly hasn't any brain,\" objected Jimmie, who was still cross.  \"Hasn't it? Well, we'll see. Now, you watch my pencil.\" He pointed to the head of the butterfly. \"This little fellow has a very tiny brain there. Also running through the body, from end to end, is a little tube through which the food passes. It is in the head above this tube where the tiny brain is, and from which two little threads run down around the tube and join to form another little knot of nerve cells like that of the brain. Then, from this second one there runs a series of little knots united by fine threads the entire length of the body, one in each ring of the body. Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes,\" piped up Betty, \"mother told us an insect is made up of rings, and--and--\""]]]
