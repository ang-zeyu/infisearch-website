He examined both of the horse's hind feet, but could not see that anything was wrong.  \"If that rascally shoer has blundered in his work he'll not get another chance at you, boy,\" Merriwell declared.  After patting Nemo's neck and fondling the fine creature a bit, Frank mounted once more.  But Nemo limped worse than ever.  \"This is singular,\" muttered the perplexed lad. \"I don't understand it at all. There's something wrong, for a fact.\"  He watched the horse, and decided that he had made no mistake in locating the lameness in the left hind leg.  Again he dismounted and made an examination, and again the result was far from satisfactory.  \"I wish you might speak and tell me what is the matter,\" said Frank, in dismay. \"I'll have you examined without delay by somebody who knows his business.\"  He rode slowly into the outskirts of the city.  Of a sudden there was a rattle of wheels and a clatter of hoofs behind him.  He turned and looked back, to see a carriage coming along the road at a reckless rate. Two persons were seated in the carriage, and the horse was covered with sweat.  \"Why are those fools driving like that?\" muttered Merriwell. \"Are they drunk, or is it a matter of life or death?\"  \"Get out of the road!\"  The command was hoarsely shouted, and Frank reined aside, having no desire to get in the way of the reckless driver.  Once more the boy on the horse turned to look back.  \"Drunk, sure enough,\" he decided. \"And they are two young fellows, too. Students on a tear, perhaps.\"  The occupants of the carriage had been drinking heavily, but they were not so drunk that they did not recognize the boy in advance when he turned in the saddle the second time.  \"Hey, Rolf!\" exclaimed the one who was not driving. \"It's Merriwell!\"  \"That's what it is!\" cried the driver. \"I haven't seen him for some time, but I know his face too well to ever forget it!\"  \"He's out on his new horse.\"  \"Sure.\"  \"Run him down! run him down! Throw him off! Now's our chance!\"  The driver was just intoxicated enough to be utterly reckless of consequences, and he snarled:  \"Hang me if I don't do it!\"  And then, when they were very near the boy and the horse, he suddenly reined toward Frank with the intention of running into Merriwell's mount.  In another moment there might have been a grand smash there on the road, but Frank had caught the words \"Run him down!\" and he gave Nemo a light cut with the whip, at the same time pulling him still farther into the ditch.  Nemo was not used to the whip, and he leaped like a flash. Such a spring would have unseated any but a most expert rider, but the boy in the saddle seemed to move as a part of the horse. Into the ditch they went, and past them spun the carriage containing the two reckless young men.  The carriage came very near upsetting. It careened and spun along on two wheels, threatening to hurl its occupants into the ditch, for the driver had reined the horse back toward the middle of the road. Both clung on for life.  \"Don't blame me!\" muttered Merriwell, through his teeth. \"You were looking for a smash.\"  But the carriage did not go over; it righted at last. One of the young men looked back and shook his fist at the boy on the horse, and then away they went in a cloud of dust.  \"If that was not Evan Hartwick, I am greatly mistaken!\" exclaimed Frank, as he reined Nemo back into the road. \"So he is back here as soon as this? I know what that means. He is looking for revenge on me.\"  Frank had seen the face of the driver as the carriage spun past, and he added:  \"Hartwick's companion is somebody I know. I did not obtain a fair look at him, but--great Scott! it was the card sharp, Rolf Harlow!\"  Harlow was a fellow who had entered Harvard, but had not completed his second year there, leaving suddenly for reasons not generally known.  A Yale man by the name of Harris, familiarly known as \"Sport,\" because of his gambling inclinations, had known Harlow, and had introduced him to a number of Yale students.  Harris and Harlow were both poker players, but they claimed that they played the game \"merely for amusement.\"  A number of Harris' acquaintances had been induced to enter into the game, and there had been some very \"hot sittings.\"  No one seemed to suspect that Harlow was crooked, for he almost always lost, although he never lost large sums.  Harris won almost continually. He seemed to be the luckiest fellow in the world in drawing cards. He would hold up one ace on a large jackpot and catch two more aces and a small pair. It seemed the greatest kind of \"bull luck.\"  Harry Rattleton, Merriwell's roommate, was following the game. Frank tried to induce him to keep away, but it was without avail.  Then Frank seemed to take an interest in the game, and it was not long before he proved that Harlow was a card manipulator, and caught him at one of his tricks.  That finished Harlow's career at plucking Yale \"fruit,\" and the fellow left New Haven suddenly.  Harris had remained under a cloud of suspicion since that time, as there seemed very little doubt but he had been in league with Harlow, and they had divided the plunder between them.  The proof had not been sufficient to incriminate Harris, but it had been enough to make him unpopular and cause him to be shunned.  He had seemed to take this very meekly, but some of Merriwell's friends declared that Harris had not forgotten or forgiven, and that he would strike back at Frank if the opportunity ever presented.  Now Harlow was back in New Haven, and Hartwick, who had been forced to leave college to escape expulsion, was also there.  That meant something.  \"Hartwick, Harlow and Harris--the three hard tickets. They are birds of a feather. All they need is Ditson to make a most delectable quartet!\"  So muttered Frank Merriwell, as he gazed at the receding cloud of dust.  Frank began to realize that there was more trouble in store for him.  \"I shall not deal gently with that gang this time,\" he declared, with a hard-set face. \"This little adventure has put me on my guard, and I don't propose to let them have much fun with me. Those two fools were just full enough to drive right into me with the hope of doing me an injury, without a thought of their own necks. They might have been thrown out and killed, but they did not hesitate because of that. The one thought was to do me some way--any way. Hartwick always was a desperate fellow, but I did not fancy Harlow could be such a chap. However, he was driving that horse, and the way he drove was proof enough that he is careless of life and limb at times.\"  For some time Frank paid very little attention to Nemo, but the lameness of the horse became so pronounced at last that he could not help observing it once more.  \"That worries me, old fellow,\" he admitted, with a troubled face. \"It is something I can't understand.\"  He rode slowly back to the stable.  It was growing dark when he arrived at the stable. A strange man was standing outside as Frank rode up. The man looked keenly at the boy and the horse, and then, as the doors rolled open, followed into the stable.  \"Horse is lame, eh?\" he said, questioningly. \"I didn't notice that when he went out. He wasn't lame then, was he?\"  Frank paid not the least attention to this question. The man was a stranger, and the boy did not care to talk with him.  \"I spotted that horse when yer rode out, young man,\" the stranger persisted. \"Fine lookin' critter--just the kind I've been wantin' some time for a saddle horse. Whose critter is it?\"  \"Grody,\" said Frank, utterly ignoring the man, \"I want you to see if you can tell what ails Nemo. He is lame in one of his hind feet. He was taken that way after I had been out a while. I think it possible there is something the matter with the way he is shod. Will you look after him without delay?\"  \"To be sure, sir--I'll not fail, sir,\" said Grody.  \"Then the horse belongs ter you, does it?\" asked the strange man, coming forward and addressing Frank in a point-blank manner. \"I am a horseman, and I know all about critters. If there's anything the matter--and there seems to be--I can tell what it is in five minutes. Shall I make an examination, young man?\"  \"No, sir!\" came sharply from Merriwell's lips. \"I do not propose to have strangers fooling around my horse. I do not know you, sir, so your offer is respectfully declined.\"     CHAPTER III.  TEACHING A RASCAL A LESSON.   \"Now hold on, young man, don't be so fast,\" said the stranger. \"You do not know me now, and I don't blame yer fer not wantin' anybody yer don't know doing anything fer yer horse; but here's my card--Professor James Colbath--and now I know you have heard of me. I am one of the greatest veterinary surgeons in the country.\"  Frank ignored the card, and the man began to show signs of anger.  \"This is no bluff!\" he exclaimed. \"It's on the level. I have nary doubt but I can find out what's the matter with the critter in five minutes, and if I don't give yer a square deal I don't want a cent for my services, that's all.\"  He would have lifted one of Nemo's feet, but Frank cried:  \"Drop that! I tell you I don't want you, and I won't have you! Get away from this horse!\"  The man growled and stiffened up.  \"All right,\" he said, somewhat savagely. \"I did think of trying to buy the critter off yer, but you're too flip. If the animal stays lame, don't blame me.\"  Although Frank had seemed to pay very little attention to the stranger, he was inspecting him closely. He saw the man had pulled his hat down over his eyes, and wore his coat collar turned up. He had a black beard that concealed his features to a great extent.  Grody was also looking the stranger over closely. He fancied he detected a familiar sound in the man's voice. The light in the stable was rather dim, and that served to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21958"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Races (#3)"],["body","the inspection of the boy and the hostler rather unsatisfactory.  All at once, Grody started as if struck by a sudden idea. As soon as possible, he whispered in Frank's ear:  \"That mug is the same chap that were here this afternoon, sir.\"  \"The same chap? What chap?\"  \"The one what gave his name as Diamond.\"  \"No? You said that fellow had no beard.\"  \"I don't believe this man's beard is all right.\"  Frank was aroused. He fancied that he saw a ray of light.  The fellow who had called himself Professor Colbath turned away. He had heard the hostler whisper, and he caught Frank's question. Immediately he showed a desire to get out.  Leaving the horse to Grody, Frank quickly placed himself before the stranger, saying:  \"Hold on a minute. I don't know but I'll talk with you a little.\"  \"No, yer won't!\" growled the man. \"I'm done tryin' to talk with a fresh youngster like you--I'm done with you.\"  \"Well, I am not done with you!\"  Frank's voice rang out sharp and stern.  \"What do you want?\" asked the man, uneasily.  \"I want to see your face.\"  \"Well, look at it, and when ye've seen it I'll proceed to smash yours! I don't take no insolence from a kid!\"  \"Take off your hat!\"  \"I will--nit!\"  \"And that beard--take it off!\"  \"Ye're crazy!\" cried the man, as he started back.  \"Am I?\"  Frank gave a spring and a grab with both hands. One hand snatched away the cap, and the other tore off the black beard, which, indeed, proved to be false.  The man uttered an exclamation of rage, and struck at Frank, who dodged the blow.  \"Is this the fellow, Grody?\" cried Frank.  \"The same mug!\" declared the hostler, excitedly.  \"Well, that's all I want to know!\" burst from Frank, as he flung the hat and beard to the floor. \"So you were monkeying around my horse to-day, you fakir! Well, what you need is a pair of good black eyes, and I propose to give them to you!\"  Snap!--off came the boy's jacket in a twinkling, and he still stood between the unmasked man and the door.  The man, who was a coarse-looking young ruffian, ground his teeth and uttered some violent language.  \"Git out the way!\" he snarled. \"I'm a fighter, and I'll kill yer! I can put yer ter sleep with one punch!\"  Merriwell's blood was thoroughly stirred, and he felt just like teaching the fellow a lesson. Although a youth in years, Frank was, as my old readers know, a trained athlete, and he could handle his fists in the most scientific manner.  \"I am going to give you a chance to put me to sleep,\" he shot back. \"I see your dirty game from start to finish! You are a fakir of the worst sort, and you tried to work me. You did something to my horse to make him lame, and you thought you would get a fat pull out of me for doctoring him. Instead of that, you have run your head into a bad scrape, and it will be damaged when you get it out.\"  \"You talk big for a kid. Why, I can blow yer over with my breath.\"  \"It is strong enough. But I don't go over so easy. Up with your hands if you are such a fighter! I'm coming for you!\"  \"All right! If ye're bound to have it, come on!\"  The man put up his guard, and then Merriwell went at him, while Grody gasped for breath, thinking the college lad could be no match for the young ruffian.  There were a few swift passes, and then Frank went under the fellow's guard and gave him a terrific uppercut on the chin. That was a staggerer, and the boy followed it up while the man was dazed.  Punk!--biff!--two blows, one on the body and the other fairly in the eye.  The second blow nearly knocked the man down, and it made him as fierce as a famished tiger. Snarling like an enraged beast, he tried to close in on the lively lad.  \"Oh, let me get hold of you!\" he grated. \"I'll crush the life out of ye!\"  Frank avoided the rush by stepping aside, and gave the fellow another body blow as he passed.  Body blows, however, were not as effective as they should have been, on account of the fellow's clothing, and Merriwell quickly decided to waste no more energy in that manner.  The man turned, and went for Frank again. This time the boy did not try to get out of the way, but he met his antagonist squarely, and gave him a heavy one in the other eye.  \"That ought to make them mates,\" said Frank, with a laugh. \"You won't know yourself when you look in the glass to-morrow morning. Perhaps it'll teach you better than to try any of your rackets on a boy. You can't always tell what you are getting up against.\"  The man's teeth could be heard grinding together. He was so furious that he quite lost his head. Then Frank sailed in to finish the affair as soon as possible.  Grody held his breath, nearly bursting with astonishment and admiration.  \"Oh, say!\" he chuckled. \"I never saw a youngster what were that fellow's match! He's hot stuff!\"  The hostler could scarcely believe it possible that Merriwell was giving the scoundrel a first-class whipping, but this became more and more evident with each passing moment.  In fact, Frank was struck just once during the entire encounter, and that was a glancing blow on the forehead, which he scarcely noticed. He thumped the rascal to his heart's satisfaction, and then knocked him flat with a round-arm swing that landed on the jaw.  The ruffian lay on the floor and groaned. When he started to get up Merriwell exclaimed:  \"There, I think that will do you for to-night! When you want some more of the same just come fooling around my horse!\"  He caught the man by the shoulders, yanked him to his feet, ran him to the door, and booted him out of the stable.  Having done this, Frank turned back and coolly put on his coat.  \"There, Grody,\" he said, \"I feel better. I think it is possible I have given that rascal a lesson he will not forget in a hurry.\"  The hostler stared, and then he cried:  \"Mr. Merriwell, sir, you are a wonder! If as how you were to go inter ther ring you'd make some of the duffers hustle. That were the neatest job what I ever see!\"  \"It was not so much of a trick,\" declared Frank. \"The fellow is strong, I'll warrant, but he is too heavy on his feet and too slow in his movements. There are scores of fellows in college who can polish him off.\"  \"I will allow I never knowed you college chaps were able to fight like that before. I knowed some of you were for fighting among yourselves all right, but I didn't think you could go up against a reg'ler scrapper.\"  \"It's a part of the education at Yale,\" smiled Frank; \"and I've found it comes in handy occasionally. The man who can't fight his way through this world in one manner or another gets walked over by chaps who are not his equal in any other way. I do not believe a man should fight only at the proper time, but when he has to fight, I hold that he should be able to do a good turn at it.\"  \"Well, you can do your turn all right, sir.\"  \"Now, Grody, Nemo must receive proper attention. I am sure that fellow did something to make the horse lame. What he did I can't tell. I don't see how he did it without getting his brains kicked out.\"  Grody hesitated, and then he said:  \"Mr. Merriwell, sir, I wants to tell ye something.\"  \"All right, Grody, go on.\"  \"I didn't tell all what happened in the stall to-day when that bloke were here.\"  \"Oh, you didn't?\"  \"No, sir. What called my attention to the fact that he had gone inter the stall were a racket.\"  \"What sort of a racket?\"  \"Nemo kicked and squealed, sir, and I heard the man speaking to him. Then I ran over and looked in.\"  \"What was the rascal doing, Grody?\"  \"He were examinin' Nemo's feet, sir.\"  \"And that was when he got in his dirty work!\" cried Frank, angrily. \"I'm afraid I didn't thump him as much as he deserved! I feel like hunting him up and giving him a few more!\"     CHAPTER IV.  BIRDS OF A FEATHER.   In a little back room of a saloon three young men were sitting. They were talking earnestly, for all that two of the three showed they had taken altogether too much liquor to be entirely sober.  \"We're glad to see you, Sport,\" one of the drinkers declared.  \"Well, I am glad to see you, Harlow, old man, and you, too, Hartwick, although we were never friendly before you left Yale so suddenly.\"  \"That was my fault,\" admitted Hartwick, huskily. \"I didn't know enough to pick out the right sort of pals. I trusted too much to Ditson. He's no good!\"  \"Now there is where you make a mistake,\" asserted Sport Harris, quickly. \"I know Ditson has no nerve, but he hates the same fellow we hate, and he is good to do the dirty work. We can make use of him, Hartwick.\"  \"I don't know anything about him,\" confessed Harlow.  \"No, he hasn't the nerve to play poker, and so you did not get acquainted with him when you were here.\"  \"I don't know that he hates Merriwell so much,\" growled Hartwick. \"You remember that Ditson blowed everything to Merriwell, and that is why I was forced to skip. Oh, I'd like the satisfaction of punching the face off the dirty little traitor!\"  \"But what caused Ditson to blow? He says you misused him.\"  \"I choked the cad a little, that is all.\"  \"But there was something back of that,\" declared Harris. \"What led you to choke him?\"  \"Oh, we had a little trouble. He was trying to squeeze me too hard, and I wouldn't stand for it.\"  \"Trying to squeeze you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How?\"  \"Well, I don't mind telling you. You know I tried to mark Merriwell for life by punching my foil through the mask that protected his face while we were engaged in a fencing bout. I had prepared my foil for that in advance by fixing the button so I could remove it, and by sharpening the point of the foil. I wanted to spoil the fellow's pretty face!\"  The most malignant hatred was expressed in Hartwick's words and manner. He went on:  \"I tried the trick, but did not succeed. Ditson carried off the foil, and kept it. He would not give it up, although he promised to a hundred times. He used it to aid in blackmailing me. When he asked me for money, I did not feel like refusing him, for he could throw me down hard by turning the foil over to Merriwell. But he"]]]
