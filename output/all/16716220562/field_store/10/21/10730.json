Failing any other indication my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these cheques. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our case will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will certainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard.”  I do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but when I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early editions of the morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.  “What do you think of this, Watson?” he asked, tossing it across.  It was from Norwood, and ran as follows:--       “IMPORTANT FRESH EVIDENCE TO HAND.  MCFARLANE'S GUILT      DEFINITELY ESTABLISHED.  ADVISE YOU TO ABANDON CASE.      --LESTRADE.”  “This sounds serious,” said I.  “It is Lestrade's little cock-a-doodle of victory,” Holmes answered, with a bitter smile. “And yet it may be premature to abandon the case. After all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade imagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together and see what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and your moral support to-day.”  My friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition. “At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion,” he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was not surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just such a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade met us, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.  “Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you found your tramp?” he cried.  “I have formed no conclusion whatever,” my companion answered.  “But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct; so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time, Mr. Holmes.”  “You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,” said Holmes.  Lestrade laughed loudly.  “You don't like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,” said he. “A man can't expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson? Step this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can convince you once for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime.”  He led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.  “This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done,” said he. “Now, look at this.” With dramatic suddenness he struck a match and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match nearer I saw that it was more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.  “Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.”  “Yes, I am doing so.”  “You are aware that no two thumb marks are alike?”  “I have heard something of the kind.”  “Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young McFarlane's right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?”  As he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.  “That is final,” said Lestrade.  “Yes, that is final,” I involuntarily echoed.  “It is final,” said Holmes.  Something in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. An extraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward merriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter.  “Dear me! Dear me!” he said at last. “Well, now, who would have thought it? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a nice young man to look at! It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment, is it not, Lestrade?”  “Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade. The man's insolence was maddening, but we could not resent it.  “What a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very natural action, too, if you come to think of it.” Holmes was outwardly calm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he spoke. “By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?”  “It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night constable's attention to it.”  “Where was the night constable?”  “He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so as to see that nothing was touched.”  “But why didn't the police see this mark yesterday?”  “Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall. Besides, it's not in a very prominent place, as you see.”  “No, no, of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday?”  Lestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind. I confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation.  “I don't know whether you think that McFarlane came out of gaol in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,”  said Lestrade. “I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb.”  “It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.”  “There, that's enough,” said Lestrade. “I am a practical man, Mr. Holmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If you have anything to say you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room.”  Holmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his expression.  “Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?” said he. “And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client.”  “I am delighted to hear it,” said I, heartily. “I was afraid it was all up with him.”  “I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance.”  “Indeed, Holmes! What is it?”  “Only this: that I KNOW that that mark was not there when I examined the hall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine.”  With a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden. Holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined it with great interest. He then led the way inside and went over the whole building from basement to attics. Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but none the less Holmes inspected them all minutely. Finally, on the top corridor, which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a spasm of merriment.  “There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,”  said he. “I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into our confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of this problem proves to be correct. Yes, yes; I think I see how we should approach it.”  The Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes interrupted him.  “I understood that you were writing a report of this case,” said he.  “So I am.”  “Don't you think it may be a little premature? I can't help thinking that your evidence is not complete.”  Lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down his pen and looked curiously at him.  “What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?”  “Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.”  “Can you produce him?”  “I think I can.”  “Then do so.”  “I will do my best. How many constables have you?”  “There are three within call.”  “Excellent!” said Holmes. “May I ask if they are all large, able-bodied men with powerful voices?”  “I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices have to do with it.”  “Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or two other things as well,” said Holmes. “Kindly summon your men, and I will try.”  Five minutes later three policemen had assembled in the hall.  “In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,” said Holmes. “I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I require. Thank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your pocket, Watson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing.”  As I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside three empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all marshalled by Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade staring at my friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other across his features. Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick.  “Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water? Put the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. Now I think that we are all ready.”  Lestrade's face had begun to grow red and angry.  “I don't know whether you are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said he. “If you know anything, you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery.”  “I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for everything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge, so you must not grudge me a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22100"],["title","Slavery and Four Years of War, Vol. 1-2 (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note:    Footnotes are at the end of each chapter, except at the end of   each section in Chapter I.

S. A.; AND MAJOR-GENERAL OF VOLUNTEERS, SPANISH WAR.  ILLUSTRATED  VOLUME I. 1861-1863  G. P. Putnam's Sons New York and London The Knickerbocker Press 1900   Copyright, 1900  BY JOSEPH WARREN KEIFER  The Knickerbocker Press, New York   To the  memory of the dead and as a tribute of esteem to the living officers and soldiers who served immediately with and under the author in battles and campaigns of the great American rebellion  This Book is Dedicated   PREFACE  The writer of this book was a volunteer officer in the Union army throughout the war of the Great Rebellion, and his service was in the field.  The book, having been written while the author was engaged in a somewhat active professional life, lacks that literary finish which results from much pruning and painstaking.  He, however, offers no excuse for writing it, nor for its completion; he has presumed to nothing but the privilege of telling his own story in his own way. He has been at no time forgetful of the fact that he was a subordinate in a great conflict, and that other soldiers discharged their duties as faithfully as himself; and while no special favors are asked, he nevertheless opes that what he has written may be accepted as the testimony of one who entertains a justifiable pride in having been connected with large armies and a participant in important campaigns and great battles.  He flatters himself that his summary of the political history of slavery in the United States, and of the important political events occurring upon the firing on Fort Sumter, and the account he has given of the several attempts to negotiate a peace before the final overthrow of the Confederate armies, will be of special interest to students of American history.  Slavery bred the doctrine of State-rights, which led, inevitably, to secession and rebellion.  The story of slavery and its abolition in the United States is the most tragic one in the world's annals. The \"Confederate States of America\" is the only government ever attempted to be formed, avowedly to perpetuate _human slavery_. A history of the Rebellion without that of slavery is but a recital of brave deeds without reference to the motive which prompted their performance.  The chapter on slavery narrates its history in the United States from the earliest times; its status prior to the war; its effect on political parties and statesmen; its aggressions, and attempts at universal domination if not extension over the whole Republic; its inexorable demands on the friends of freedom, and its plan of perpetually establishing itself through secession and the formation of a slave nation.  It includes a history of the secession of eleven Southern States, and the formation of \"The Confederate States of America\"; also what the North did to try to avert the Rebellion. It was written to show why and how the Civil War came, what the conquered lost, and what the victors won.  In other chapters the author has taken the liberty, for the sake of continuity, of going beyond the conventional limits of a personal _memoir_, but in doing this he has touched on no topic not connected with the war.  The war campaigns cover the first one in Western Virginia, 1861; others in Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, 1862; in West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, 1863; and in Virginia, 1864; ending with the capture of Richmond and Petersburg, the battles of Five Forks and Sailor's Creek, and the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomattox, 1865.  A chapter on the New York riots of 1863, also one on the \"Peace Negotiations,\" will be found, each in its proper place.  Personal mention and descriptions of many officers known to the writer are given; also war incidents deemed to be of interest to the reader.  But few generalizations are indulged in either as to events, principles, or the character of men; instead, facts are given from which generalizations may be formed.  The author is indebted to his friends, General George D. Ruggles (General Meade's Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac, late Adjutant-General, U.S.A.), for important data furnished from the War Department, and to his particular friends, both in peace and war, General John Beatty and Colonel Wm. S. Furay of Columbus, Ohio, for valuable suggestions.    J. W. K. December, 1899.   CONTENTS  CHAPTER I Slavery:  Its Political History in the United States, (I.) Introductory--(II.)
