In a moment, however, he saw his uncle coming towards him. He was clasping his wallet and putting it in his pocket.  \"Uncle George,\" said he, \"see that beautiful little dog!\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  \"I wish I had such a dog as that to travel with me,\" said Rollo. \"But, uncle George where are we to get our tickets?\"  \"I've got mine,\" said Mr. George. \"When I come to a railway station I always get my ticket the first thing, and look at the pretty little dogs afterwards.\"  So saying, Mr. George took a newspaper out of his pocket and began to walk away, adding, as he went,--  \"I'll sit down here and read my newspaper till you have got your ticket, and then we will go into the waiting room.\"  \"But, uncle George,\" said Rollo, \"why did not you get me a ticket when you got yours?\"  \"Because,\" said Mr. George, \"among other reasons, I did not know which class carriage you wished to go in.\"  \"Why, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo, surprised. \"I must go in the same carriage that you do of course.\"  \"Not of course,\" said Mr. George. \"I have got a ticket in the first class; and I should like to have your company in my car very much if you choose to pay the price for a first-class ticket. But if you choose to take a second or a third-class ticket you will save, perhaps, half your money.\"  So saying, Mr. George went away and left Rollo to himself.  This was the way that Mr. George always treated Rollo when he was travelling with him. He left him to act for himself and to take care of himself in almost all the emergencies that occurred. He did this, not because he wished to save himself the trouble of taking care of a boy, but because he thought it was much better for boys early to learn to take care of themselves.  The manner in which Mr. George thus threw the responsibility upon Rollo seemed sometimes to be a little blunt. One would suppose, in some of these cases, from the way in which he spoke and acted, that he did not care at all what became of Rollo, so coolly and with such an air of unconcern did he leave him to his own resources. In fact, Rollo was frequently at such times a little frightened, or at least perplexed, and often, at first, felt greatly at a loss to know what to do. But, on reflecting a little upon the subject, he usually soon succeeded in extricating himself from the difficulty; and then he was always quite proud of having done so, and was pleased with his uncle George for having given him the opportunity. So Mr. George, having learned by experience that Rollo liked, on the whole, to be treated in this way, always adopted it; and in carrying it out he sometimes spoke and acted in such a way as might, under other circumstances have appeared somewhat stern.  The idea of taking a second-class car for himself in order to save a portion of his money, while his uncle went in one of the first-class, took Rollo's imagination strongly, and he was half inclined to adopt it.  \"On the whole,\" said he to himself, \"I will not do it to-day; but I will some other day. And now I wonder which is the ticket office for Strasbourg.\"  So saying, Rollo looked about the room and soon found the proper place to apply for his ticket. He procured a ticket without any difficulty, asking for it in French, with a pronunciation which, if it was not perfectly correct, was at least perfectly intelligible. As soon as he had received his ticket and had taken up his change he went to the bench where his uncle George was sitting and said that he was ready.  \"Well,\" said Mr. George, \"then we'll go. I like to travel with a boy that is capable of taking care of himself and is willing to be treated like a man.\"  Saying these words, Mr. George rose from his seat, and, after attending properly to the baggage, he and Rollo passed through a door guarded by a man in uniform, who required them to show him their tickets before he would allow them to pass, and then entered a spacious apartment which was reserved as the waiting room for the first-class passengers. This room was beautifully finished and richly adorned, and the splendid sofas and ottomans which were ranged about the sides of it were occupied by well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, carrying shawls, greatcoats, and small travelling bags upon their arms, and exhibiting other similar indications of their being travellers. Mr. George and Rollo took seats at a vacant place upon one of the sofas. In a few minutes an officer came and informed the company, in a very respectful manner, that the train was ready; whereupon they all rose from their seats and walked out upon the platform where the train was waiting. Here there were several railway servants, all dressed in uniform, whose business it was to conduct the passengers to the several cars, or carriages, as they call them, and open the doors. These carriages were entirely different in their construction from the long and open cars used in America, which form but one compartment, that extends through the whole length of the car. The French cars were like three elegant carriages, joined together in such a manner that, though the three formed but one car, they were still entirely distinct from each other. The seats in these carriages were very spacious, and they were richly stuffed and lined, so that they formed soft and luxurious places of repose. The railway porter opened one of the doors and admitted Mr. George and Rollo, and when they had entered he closed it again.  \"Ah,\" said Rollo, seating himself upon the soft cushion on one of the seats, \"is not this superb? I am _very glad_ I did not take a second-class car.\"  \"And yet the second-class cars in France are very comfortable and very respectable,\" said Mr. George, \"and they are very much cheaper.\"  \"How much should we have saved,\" asked Rollo, \"in going to Strasbourg, if we had taken a second-class car?\"  \"I don't know, precisely,\" said Mr. George. \"We should have saved a great deal.\"  The train now began to move; and, soon after it left the station, Mr. George took out his newspaper again and began to read. It was a copy of a very celebrated newspaper, called the London Times. Mr. George had another London paper which was full of humorous engravings. The name of it was Punch. Mr. George gave the Punch to Rollo, thinking that the pictures and caricatures in it might perhaps amuse him; but Rollo, after turning it over a moment, concluded that he should prefer to amuse himself by looking out the window.  [Illustration: IN THE CAR.]  Rollo saw a great many beautiful views and witnessed a great many strange and striking scenes as he was whirled onward by the train across the country from Paris towards Strasbourg. We cannot, however, stop to describe what he saw, but must hasten on to the Swiss frontier. The travellers arrived at Strasbourg in the evening. They spent the night at a hotel; and the next morning they took another railway which led along the bank of the Rhine, up the river, towards Switzerland. The country was magnificent. There was the river on one side, and a range of mountains rising sublimely in the interior on the other. The mountains were at a distance of several miles from the river; and the country between was an extremely fertile and luxuriant plain, covered with villages, castles, parks, pleasure grounds, gardens, and cultivated fields, which presented every where most enchanting pictures of rural beauty. This province is called Alsatia.  The terminus of the railway was at the city of Basle, which lies just within the confines of Switzerland. A short distance before reaching the gates of Basle, the train stopped at what seemed at first to be a station. It was, however, only the custom house, where the trunks and passports were to be examined.  \"What are we to do here,\" asked Rollo.  \"_I_ am going to do what I see other people do,\" replied Mr. George. \"You can do whatever you please.\"  At this moment a guard, dressed, like all the other railway servants, in a sort of uniform, opened the door of the car in which Mr. George and Rollo were sitting, and said in a very respectful manner, in French,--  \"The custom house, gentlemen.\"  Mr. George observed that the passengers were getting out from all the other cars; so he stepped out too, and Rollo followed him.  When they reached the platform they observed that a company of porters were employed in carrying all the trunks and baggage from the cars to the custom house, and that the passengers were going into the custom house too, though by another door. Mr. George and Rollo went in with them. They found an office within, and a desk, where one or two secretaries sat and examined the passports of the travellers as they successively presented them. As fast as they were examined they were impressed with a new stamp, which denoted permission for the travellers to pass the Swiss frontier. The several travellers, as fast as their passports were examined, found right, and stamped, were allowed to pass between two soldiers through a door into another hall, where they found all the trunks and baggage arranged on a sort of counter, which extended around the centre of the room, so as to enclose a square place within. The custom-house officers who were to examine the baggage were within this enclosure, while the travellers who owned the baggage stood without. These last walked around the counter, looking at the trunks, boxes, bundles, and carpet bags that covered it, each selecting his own and opening the several parcels, in order that the officers within might examine them.  The object of examining the trunks of passengers in this way is, to ascertain that they have not any _goods_ concealed in them. As a general thing, persons are not allowed to take _goods_ from one country to another without paying a tax for them. Such a tax is called technically a _duty_, and the avails of it go to support the government of the country which the goods are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22377"],["title","Rollo in Switzerland (#4)"],["body","into. Travellers are allowed to take with them all that is necessary _for their own personal use, as travellers_, without paying any duty; but articles that are intended for sale as merchandise, or those which, though intended for the traveller's own use, are not strictly _personal_, are liable to pay duty. The principle is, that whatever the traveller requires for his own personal use, _in travelling_, is not liable to duty. What he does not so require must pay duty, no matter whether he intends to use it himself or to sell it.  Many travellers do not understand this properly, and often get into difficulty by not understanding it, as we shall see in the sequel.  Mr. George and Rollo went into the baggage room together, showing their passports as they passed through between the soldiers. They then walked slowly along the room, looking at the baggage, as it was arranged upon the counter, in search of their own.  \"I see _my_ trunk,\" said Mr. George, looking along at a little distance before him. \"There it is.\"  \"And where do you suppose mine is?\" asked Rollo.  \"I have not the least idea,\" said Mr. George. \"I advise you to walk all around the room and see if you can find it; and when you find it, get it examined.\"  Rollo, taking this advice, walked on, leaving Mr. George in the act of taking out his key in order to open his trunk for the purpose of allowing an officer to inspect it as soon as one should be ready.  Rollo soon found his trunk. It was in a part of the room remote from his uncle's. Near his trunk was a very large one, which the officers were searching very thoroughly. They had found something in it which was not personal baggage and which the lady had not declared. Rollo could not see what the article was which the officers had found. It was something contained in a pretty box. The lady had put it into the bottom of her trunk. The officers had taken it out, and were now examining it. The lady stood by, seemingly in great distress.  Rollo's attention, which had begun to be attracted by this scene, was, however, almost immediately called off from it by the voice of another officer, who pointed to his trunk and asked him if it was his.  \"Is that yours?\" said the officer, in French.  \"Yes,\" replied Rollo, in the same language, \"it is mine;\" and so saying, he proceeded to take out his key and unlock the trunk.  \"Have you any thing to declare?\" asked the man.  Rollo looked perplexed. He did not know what the officer meant by asking him if he had any thing to declare. After a moment's hesitation he said,--  \"I don't know; but I will go ask my uncle.\"  So Rollo went to the place where he had left his uncle George, and accosted him by saying,--  \"They want to know if I have any thing to _declare_. What do they mean?\"  \"They mean whether you have any goods in your trunk that are liable to pay duty. Tell them no.\"  So Rollo went back and told the officer that he had not any thing to declare. He then opened his trunk; but the officer, instead of examining it, shut down the lid, saying, \"Very well;\" and by means of a piece of chalk he marked it upon the top with some sort of character. A porter then took the trunk and carried it back to the train.  Rollo perceived that the difficulty about the lady's baggage had been settled in some way or other, but he feared it was settled in a manner not very satisfactory to the lady herself; for, as the porters took up her trunk to carry it back, she looked quite displeased and out of humor.  Rollo went back to the place where he had left his uncle George, and then they went together out to the platform. Here Rollo found the lady who had had difficulty about her baggage explaining the case to some friends that she found there. She seemed to be very indignant and angry, and was telling her story with great volubility. Rollo listened for a moment; but she spoke so rapidly that he could not understand what she said, as she spoke in French.  \"What does she say?\" he asked, speaking to Mr. George.  \"She says,\" replied Mr. George, \"that they were going to seize something that she had in her trunk because she did not declare it.\"  \"What does that mean?\" said Rollo.  \"Why, the law is,\" said Mr. George, \"that when people have any thing in their trunks that is dutiable, if they _declare_ it, that is, acknowledge that they have it and show it to the officers, then they have only to pay the duty, and they may carry the article in. But if they do not declare it, but hide it away somewhere in their trunks, and the officers find it there, then the thing is forfeited altogether. The officers seize it and sell it for the benefit of the government.\"  \"O, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"that is what they do; and it is right. If people wish to bring any thing that is subject to duty into any country they ought to be willing to pay the duty, and not, by refusing to pay, make other people pay more than their share.\"  \"If one man does not pay his duty,\" rejoined Rollo, \"do the others have to pay more?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"in the end they do. At least I suppose so. Whatever the amount of money may be that is required for the expenses of government, if one man does not pay his share, the rest must make it up, I suppose.\"  \"They did not look into my trunk at all,\" said Rollo. \"Why didn't they? I might have had ever so many things hid away there.\"  \"I suppose they knew from the circumstances of the case,\" said Mr. George, \"that you would not be likely to have any smuggled goods in your trunk. They saw at once that you were a foreign boy, and knew that you must be coming to Switzerland only to make a tour, and that you could have no reason for wishing to smuggle any thing into the country. They scarcely looked into _my_ trunk at all.\"  While Mr. George and Rollo had been holding this conversation they had returned to their places in the car, and very soon the train was in motion to take them into the town.  Thus our travellers passed the Swiss frontier. In half an hour afterwards they were comfortably established at a large and splendid hotel called the Three Kings. The hotel has this name in three languages, English, French, and German, as people speaking those several languages come, in almost equal numbers, to Switzerland. Thus when you leave the station you may, in your directions to the coachman, say you wish to go to the Three Kings, or to the Trois Rois, or to the Drei Könige, whichever you please. They all mean the same hotel--the best hotel in Basle.     CHAPTER III.  BASLE.   The city of Basle stands upon the banks of the Rhine, on the northern frontier of Switzerland. The waters of the Rhine are gathered from hundreds of roaring and turbid torrents which come out, some from vast icy caverns in the glaciers, some from the melting debris of fallen avalanches, some from gushing fountains which break out suddenly through crevices in the rocks or yawning chasms, and some from dark and frightful ravines on the mountain sides, down which they foam and tumble perpetually, fed by vast fields of melting snow above. The waters of all these torrents, being gathered at last into one broad, and deep, and rapid stream, flow to a vast reservoir called the Lake of Constance, where they repose for a time, or, rather, move slowly and insensibly forward, enjoying a comparative quiescence which has all the characteristics and effects of repose. The waters enter this reservoir wild and turbid. They leave it calm and clear; and then, flowing rapidly for one hundred miles along the northern frontier of Switzerland, and receiving successively the waters of many other streams that have come from hundreds of other torrents and have been purified in the repose of other lakes extending over the whole northern slope of Switzerland, they form a broad and rapid river, which flows swiftly through Basle, and then, turning suddenly to the northward, bids Basle and Switzerland farewell together.  \"And then where does it go?\" said Rollo to Mr. George when his uncle had explained this thus far to him.  \"Straight across the continent to the North Sea,\" said Mr. George.  Thus the whole northern slope of Switzerland is drained by a system of waters which, when united at Basle, form the River Rhine.  The morning after Mr. George and Rollo arrived at Basle they were looking out upon the River Rhine from the windows of the hotel.  \"What a swift river!\" said Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George.  \"And how blue the water is!\" continued Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"The water of the streams which come from the Swiss mountains is turbid at first and very gray from the grinding up of the rocks in the _moraines_ and glaciers and by the avalanches.\"  \"What is a moraine?\" asked Rollo.  \"I will explain it to you one of these days,\" said Mr. George, \"when you come to see one.\"  \"And a glacier,\" said Rollo; \"what is that?\"  \"I will explain that to you, too, some other time,\" said Mr. George, \"but not now; for the breakfast will come in in a minute or two.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I can hear while I am eating my breakfast.\"  \"That may be,\" replied Mr. George; \"but I cannot lecture very well while I am eating _my_ breakfast.\"  Rollo laughed. \"I did not think of that,\" said he.  \"What queer boats!\" continued Rollo, looking out again upon the river. \"And there is a long bridge leading over to the other side. May I go out and walk over on that bridge after breakfast?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"you may go any where you please.\"  \"But suppose I should get lost,\" said Rollo. \"What should I do then?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George, \"unless you should ask somebody to tell you the way to the Three Kings.\"  \"But perhaps they would not understand English,\" said Rollo.  \"Then you must say _Trois Rois_,[3a] which is the French name for the hotel,\" rejoined Mr. George.  \"But perhaps they would not understand French,\" said Rollo.  \"No,\" replied Mr. George; \"I think it probable they would not; for people talk German generally in"]]]
