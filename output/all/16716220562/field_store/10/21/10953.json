Dexter had never looked for a young Grammar School boy to be so firm and undaunted.  \"Now, don't be a fool, Prescott,\" he began, trying a new tack.  \"You ought to be a fine teacher in the subject of good sense,\" suggested Dick mockingly.  \"I think I can be.\"  \"Fire away, then.\"  \"Prescott, you don't have much spending money, do you?\"  \"Not enough to worry the bank with.\"  \"You'd like more?\"  \"Of course.\"  \"I'm going to find it for you.\"  \"You are--or do you mean that your wife is?\"  Ab. Dexter winked. He had not looked for the youngster to be so keen.  \"Prescott, take it from an older man. It doesn't make so much difference, in this world, where the money comes from, if a fellow only has it.\"  \"I guess, from your actions, that's about the way you feel about it, Dexter,\" rejoined the boy.  \"Don't you feel the same way?\"  \"No; I'd like to be worth a million dollars, Dexter, but I don't believe I ever shall be.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because the opportunities for getting a million honestly are not very plentiful, and I wouldn't have a dollar--or a million--with a stain on it!\"  \"You simpleton!\" sneered Dexter.  \"There are a few of us left in the world,\" Dick retorted complacently. \"But you, Dexter, you wouldn't care whether it was money or slime, as long as you could spend it!\"  \"You're talking nonsense, boy,\" argued Dexter, restraining himself as best he could. \"Now, see here, I'm sorry I thumped you. I've got a lot of use for a boy with as much sand and grit as you've shown. I can use you, and I can show you how to make a nice little lot of money by helping me in something that I have on hand. So come on. Get up and walk along with me while we talk it over.\"  Dexter rose, and Dick got to his feet as nimbly as he could. He ached, though, fortunately, he was not badly crippled by the pummeling that he had received.  \"Come on, now, and let's take a little walk,\" urged the man persuasively.  But Dick Prescott glared back at the bully with all the contempt in the world in his look.  \"Nothing doing in the way of walking together, Dexter,\" announced the boy.  \"Why not?\"  \"Folks might see me with you.\"  \"Suppose they did!\"  \"Then they'd imagine that I knew you. Dexter, a boy who hopes to grow up and become a useful citizen can't be too careful about the company he keeps.\"  \"You confounded little imp! You're not tamed yet.\"  Dexter's foot struck against a stick lying on the ground. Snatching this weapon up and uttering a cry of rage, he sprang forward to fell the boy with the club.     CHAPTER V  FOOTBALL UNIFORMS IN SIGHT   Had Dick turned to run Ab. Dexter would have darted after him. The bully possessed much longer legs and prided himself on his speed.  To Dexter's amazement, however, Dick did not flinch or turn.  Perhaps there was not time enough. Again, perhaps young Prescott saw two other figures moving in the darkness.  At all events, the man suddenly felt the stick fly from his hand. Then, before he could regain his self-possession, two boyish figures crouched swiftly one on each side of him.  Dexter felt his knees gripped. In the same instant two boys rose suddenly, holding on, and the bully toppled over backward.  \"Never hit a man when he's down,\" quoth the dry voice of Greg Holmes. \"But, if he isn't even any sort of a man, it doesn't matter!\"  Thump! Greg brought his not very big fist down on Dexter's nose. It was an ugly blow, delivered before the bully could recover from his own amazement.  Dave Darrin, the other boy, did not even wait to speak. He began to rain down blows on the prostrate enemy.  \"Here, stop that, Davey!\" urged Dick, darting forward. \"Don't hit the cur any more.\"  \"But he was going to club you,\" argued Dave, hitting two more blows.  \"Stop this, boys! Let up! I'll clear out,\" begged Ab. Dexter.  Dick, finding that neither of his chums was much inclined to stop the merited punishment, darted in and forcibly dragged Darrin off Dexter's prostrate form.  \"Let me have him, for a minute or two yet,\" coaxed Greg Holmes. \"You know, Dick, he was going to club you.\"  \"I know it,\" rejoined young Prescott doggedly. \"He did thrash me twice, and it hurt. I don't believe in soiling our hands on anything like this fellow, when it can be helped. Besides, we're too many.\"  Though Dave and Greg had now both been pulled off their prey, they hovered over Dexter, who seemed afraid to rise for fear it would lead to a renewed onslaught.  \"Stand back, fellows,\" coaxed Dick, pushing them gently. \"Dexter, I told you you'd be a booby in any fight where you couldn't have it all your own way. I was right about it. Get up, now--and make your fly-away while I'm still able to hold these two bulldogs in leash. Hustle now!\"  Dick emphasized his advice with a kick, but it was not a vicious one. Ab. Dexter looked up in wonder. Then he rose, crouchingly, next made a sprinter's start and bolted.  \"Humph! We can never get him now,\" uttered Dave Darrin disgustedly. \"Whew! I wish I could run as fast as that.\"  \"You can learn,\" replied Dick.  \"Yes; in about ten years!\"  \"Dave, you could learn to run a heap faster than you do, and in a mighty short time.\"  \"How?\"  \"Just start in to train. Get someone who knows something about it to give you pointers on running. Pshaw! I believe our whole crowd ought to start in to learn to run. To run, really, I mean. If I had been a faster runner to-night I might have gotten away from that bully. I might have saved myself from a good many aches that I've got just now.\"  \"You aching?\" questioned Darrin. \"What makes you ache?\"  \"Dexter gave me two hard thrashings before you fellows got along.\"  \"He did?\" sputtered Dave vengefully. \"O Dick, why did you ever let him get away from us?\"  \"I'm glad I did something to the sneak while I had the chance,\" declared Greg Holmes.  \"First of all, tell me how you fellows came to find me,\" suggested Dick Prescott.  \"Oh, that's easy enough to account for,\" Dave replied. \"Greg and I were on Main Street looking for you. Then we went down to the store. Your mother told us that you'd gone to Mrs. Davis's with a package of books, so we set out to meet you on your return. And right over there, on the street, we came across a little girl, white, scared and half crying. She said she had seen a man grab you up, throw you over the wall----\"  \"Yes, that happened,\" nodded Prescott.  \"And the little kiddie said she saw the man jump over the wall, grab you up and start for the woods. She was sure the wicked man was going to kill you.\"  \"Dexter was mad enough, but he lacked the sand for going that far, I guess,\" remarked Prescott.  \"He might not be without the sand,\" argued Dave. \"I've got a notion that Dexter, while a coward, perhaps, about some things, would go about as far as his anger drove him. I'm glad we came along, anyway.\"  \"So am I. You fellows sneaked in so quietly in the dark, that I didn't see you until just before you tackled Dexter. Well, there's no great harm done, thanks to you, Dave, and to you, Greg. Let's get back to Main Street.\"  As the youngsters crossed the field and strolled up the street, Dick gave an accurate account of what had befallen him.  \"So the sneak wanted to pay you to help him in some dirty sort of work?\" demanded Dave, his dark eyes ablaze with disgust.  \"I imagine it must have been dirty work, since Dexter had planned it out,\" Dick admitted, smiling.  \"The hound! But then, see here, Dick; if Dexter wanted you to help him in anything of that sort, it means that he's going to try to bother that poor wife of his again.\"  \"It looks that way, Dave.\"  \"Then we ought to warn Mrs. Dexter, so that she can be on her guard against the worthless rascal.\"  \"I've been thinking of that, Dave. Yes; I'm sure we must go and give Mrs. Dexter a hint. It wouldn't be right not to tell her of what may be ahead of her.\"  \"We might go around to her house to-morrow afternoon after school, eh?\" proposed Greg.  \"Football practice to-morrow afternoon,\" retorted Dave Darrin dryly.  \"Besides, to-morrow afternoon might be too late,\" urged Dick. \"Fellows, when we have a message like this, which may be of great importance to some other human being, there's no time for doing the errand like--_now_!\"  \"That's right, too,\" approved Dave. \"It won't take us more than five minutes to reach Mrs. Dexter's house. Let's head for there at the next corner?\"  That being agreed to, the three chums set out at a brisk walk. A few minutes later Dick was pulling the doorbell of Mrs. Dexter's new home, while Dave and Greg stood just a little below him on the steps.  It was a pretty little house, of ten rooms; not as large a house as Mrs. Dexter might have been able to afford, but one that was a happy contrast to the three-room flat in which Mrs. Dexter had lived when obliged to support herself at dressmaking. As yet there were but two servants on the place--a woman who did the house-work and a hired man, who slept in a room over the little barn at the rear of the house.  \"Will you ask Mrs. Dexter if she can see us, please?\" asked Dick, lifting his cap, when the woman-of-all-work opened the door. \"Kindly tell her that we have news for her which we think may be very important.\"  \"Come in, boys,\" replied the housekeeper, doubtless pleased by Dick's deference in raising his cap, an example in which he had been promptly followed by Dave and Greg.  The woman showed them into a little parlor. Mrs. Dexter soon came down and greeted them.  \"I'm very glad you boys have called on me,\" she said. \"You and your other friends did me a service to-day that I can't forget. I was on the way to the bank to leave the jewels and the money when you helped me so handsomely.\"  \"We've come, Mrs. Dexter,\" said Dick, \"to tell you what happened to-night. It may be the means of saving you from further trouble with Mr. Dexter.\"  Then Dick told the story of his adventure that evening. Dave and Greg added a few words at the end.  \"So we"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22307"],["title","The Grammar School Boys of Gridley; or, Dick & Co. Start Things Moving (#7)"],["body","k,\" summed up Dick, \"that Mr. Dexter may not yet be through with his schemes against you. Excuse us, Mrs. Dexter, but don't you think it would be well to have a man sleep in the house--one that you can depend on if Dexter comes here to make trouble?\"  \"Yes, indeed. My hired man is a straight-forward fellow. I'll have him stay around here more, and I'll have a room fitted up in the house for him. Mr. Dexter isn't usually extremely brave. I imagine that the hired man can take care of him if he puts in an appearance. At all events, I shall feel safer for having a man in the house.\"  Their errand being done, the three Grammar School boys would have risen to go, but Mrs. Dexter detained them, asking many questions about their school life.  Then, somehow, the story came out of the newly organized Central Grammar football squad.  \"Oh, but that is going to be fine!\" cried Mrs. Dexter. \"Manly sports always make boys stronger, and give them a better sense of fair play when such a sense is needed. You'll have uniforms, of course. What will your uniforms be like?\"  \"That's one of the points we haven't decided on yet,\" smiled Dick. \"The uniforms will have to come, in good time.\"  \"Your football organization has a treasurer, of course?\"  \"He's a luxury we don't need yet,\" laughed Dave.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because there isn't any treasury.\"  \"Yet there will be, of course--that is, if----\"  Suddenly Mrs. Dexter looked mightily pleased and clapped her hands.  \"I've stumbled on to one of your secrets, boys,\" she cried. \"You haven't any treasury, and you're still wondering where the money can come from to pay for uniforms. Well, you needn't wonder any longer. All of you boys who helped me to-day are interested in the football plan. You did me a very great service to-day, and you've done me another one to-night. Now I'm going to buy the football uniforms. How much will they cost--ten dollars apiece?\"  \"Five or six ought to buy as good uniforms as we'll need,\" replied Dick Prescott, reddening. \"But, Mrs. Dexter, we don't want----\"  \"Let me have my own way, won't you?\" she pleaded plaintively. \"It's such a very new thing for me to be able to have my own way. I'm going to write the check, to-night, to pay for the uniforms. Don't stop me, please don't.\"  Mrs. Dexter rose and went over to a little desk, where she sat fingering her checkbook.  \"Now please give me some idea of what such uniforms cost. I want to do it nicely for you boys. Excuse me just a moment, though.\"  Mrs. Dexter touched a bell on her desk and the housekeeper entered.  \"Jane, when I put Myra to bed this evening, she showed signs of a cough. I don't want the child to get croupy and not know anything about it. Just run up and watch Myra, won't you, without waking her? Then come down and let me know, after a few minutes.\"  The housekeeper started upstairs. Mrs. Dexter returned to the subject of football uniforms, while the three boys, red-faced and reluctant, answered her questions. They appreciated her kindness, but they did not want her to pay for the uniforms. To Dick and his chums it looked too much like begging.  A shriek sounded upstairs. Then Jane came rushing down.  \"Oh, ma'am!\" she cried in dismay. \"Myra's gone--her bed's empty, and the clothes that she wore have been taken from the chair!\"  While Mrs. Dexter turned deathly pale and tottered, Dick Prescott leaped up, exclaiming:  \"It's the work of Dexter. That's the scheme he had!\"     CHAPTER VI  ON THE TRAIL OF THE CAB   \"The wretch has stolen Myra! I didn't I think he would dare do that,\" cried the woman.  Mrs. Dexter had never made any effort to secure a divorce from her worthless husband. After he had abandoned her she had appeared in court and had had herself appointed sole guardian and custodian of little Myra. Under the law, therefore, Dexter, if he stole Myra away from the mother, could be arrested and punished for abduction.  At this frantic moment, however, Mrs. Dexter was not thinking of punishments. All she wanted was to get her child back in her own keeping.  \"Isn't it possible there's a mistake?\" demanded Greg of the dismayed housekeeper. \"The little one may have gotten up out of bed. She may be in some other part of the house.\"  \"Not much!\" interjected the housekeeper. \"The child's jacket and coat are gone from a hook near by.\"  After the first moment of fright Mrs. Dexter had raced upstairs; now she came down again.  \"Myra's really gone,\" she cried, sobbing. \"And no one but Dexter would think of stealing her from me. He has done it for spite--or as the means of extorting more money from me.\"  \"A man could hardly go through the streets carrying a child that didn't want to be carried. The child could cry out and attract attention,\" guessed Dick.  \"Myra wouldn't cry out. She would be cowed by her father's threats. She always was afraid of him,\" wailed Mrs. Dexter.  \"Are you going to appeal to the police?\" Dick asked.  \"I--I must.\"  \"Then you're losing time, Mrs. Dexter--and there's your telephone. We boys will go out into the streets and see if we can find any trace--pick up any word. When we came along there was a cab standing in front of the Grahams. But I suppose that cab belonged to some of their visitors.\"  \"The Grahams have been out of town for the last few days,\" broke in Mrs. Dexter. \"There has been no one at their house, except one old man who acts as care-taker.\"  \"Then Dexter may have had that cab waiting for him,\" flashed young Prescott. \"Come along, fellows! Let's see what we can find out.\"  Dave and Greg were at the street door ahead of their young leader. None of the boys paused longer, for Mrs. Dexter was already at her telephone.  Out in the street the three Grammar School lads raced along the sidewalk until they reached the house of the Graham family. The cab was gone.  \"We can find that cab anywhere,\" declared Dick. \"Any one else would recognize it. It had one brown, or dark horse, and one gray horse.\"  \"I didn't notice the driver,\" stated Darrin.  \"He was sitting inside the cab,\" spoke up Greg. \"I didn't get a good look at him, either.\"  \"Going to race on into Main Street?\" asked Dave, as the three came to a street corner.  \"Dexter would hardly drive right into the clutches of the police, would he?\" pondered Prescott. \"No; I think it'll turn out that he went the opposite way, out of town.\"  Saying this, Dick headed for the outskirts of Gridley, still keeping along at a dog-trot. Dave and Greg didn't talk now; they were husbanding their store of \"wind.\"  After a short time all three boys had to slow down to a walk. That \"pain in the side,\" which seizes all boys who try to run far without training and practice, had caught them. Still, they moved along as fast as they could go.  \"Excuse me, mister,\" hailed Dick, halting the first man they met, who came strolling toward them, smoking a pipe, \"have you seen a cab go by?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Oldish cab?\" broke in Dave.  \"One gray horse and one dark or brown?\" breathed Greg.  \"Yep.\"  \"How long ago?\" asked all three.  \"'Bout two minutes ago. Why?\"  \"Which way did it go?\" breathed Dick anxiously.  \"Why, the driver stopped me,\" explained the man, taking out his pipe, \"and asked if there was a drug store ahead in this part of the town. I told him he'd find one on the next block, around the next corner to the left. So----\"  \"Thank you!\" came politely from three breathless boys, and off they started again on a trot.  \"Any one sick?\" called the man after them. \"Huh! Curious how excited those boys are!\"  \"Two minutes! I'm afraid horses will leave us far behind with that start,\" groaned Dick.  Then they turned around the corner. Ahead of them, in front of the little drug store, or rather, just past the entrance, stood the cab that occupied all their thoughts at the present time.  \"There it is!\" breathed Dick excitedly, as though forgetful of the fact that his chums had eyes also. \"Come along--over on the other side of the street--in the dark.\"  In a twinkling all three lads had crossed stealthily to the further side of the little street.  \"Oh, for a policeman!\" appealed Dick. \"Or any full-grown man, who would listen to us and have the grit to give us a strong hand.\"  \"If Dexter has the little girl, and that's his cab, what has he taken her into a drug store for?\" whispered Dave.  \"We don't know that he has taken her into the store. We don't know anything until we see it,\" was Dick's answer. \"Dexter didn't stop for a trifle. He isn't buying Myra a glass of soda, or anything like that.\"  The three boys were stealing down the street, on the further side, keeping close in the shadow of the buildings. They did not wish to risk being seen until they had had a chance for a good look at the cab and its possible contents.  Dick's reason for crossing the street had been that he had first caught sight of the driver standing on the sidewalk beside the cab. If he could get down close to the cab, and have that vehicle between himself and the driver, Dick hoped that he would have a chance to steal across the street and look inside the rig.  By good luck, combined with stealth, Dick, Dave and Greg succeeded in gaining a point on the street opposite the cab.  \"Careful, now,\" whispered Dick, \"one bad move might spoil everything.\"  On tip-toe they crossed. At a point midway in the street they halted a brief instant. From this point they could make out the unmistakable form of Ab. Dexter at the back of the drug store, walking to and fro as if waiting for something.  No word was spoken. Still on tip-toe the boys went on until they stood by one of the doors of the cab.  Dave and Greg made way for Dick to get up close and peer into the vehicle.  Young Prescott gave a start of exultation as he made out a little, wrapped-up human bundle huddled on the back seat. It was little four-year-old Myra. She had collapsed into a heap and was very softly sobbing to herself, wholly unaware of what might be passing outside.  On the further side of the cab, standing on the sidewalk, Dick"]]]
