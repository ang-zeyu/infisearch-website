Edgar got up several times, and walked backwards and forwards. He was less accustomed to waiting, and was burning for action. Just at eight o'clock there came suddenly to their ears an outburst of firing, the boom of cannon, and the sound of a crackling roll of musketry.  \"The French have lost no time in beginning,\" he said.  The young Arab nodded. A flush of excitement glowed through the olive skin, his hand tightly grasped his spear, and his eyes were fixed on the distant city. Suddenly the sheik raised the vibrating battle-cry of the Arabs, in which the whole of his followers joined, and then at a wild gallop they dashed forward, the horses seeming to share in the excitement of their riders. After maintaining the pace for a couple of miles they reined in their horses somewhat, and at a canter swept along the neck that divided in old time the lakes of Aboukir and Mareotis, slackened down into a walk as they approached the fresh-water canal, where they stopped for a few minutes to allow their horses to drink, and then continued at a leisurely pace until they mounted the high ground at Ramleh. From here they obtained a view of the eastern side of Alexandria. They could hear the din of battle on the other side of the town, and could see the great fleet anchored, a mile from shore, some two miles to the west of the town. The wind, which had been blowing strongly the night before, and had seriously hindered the work of disembarkation of the French troops, had now subsided. Some of the men-of-war were engaging the forts, but at so great a distance that it was evident that it was a demonstration to distract the attention of the besieged rather than a serious attack. Four or five ships, under the shortest sail, were cruising backwards and forwards parallel with the shore eastward of the town, and occasionally a white puff of smoke burst out from one or other of them, and a shot was sent in the direction of scattered bands of horsemen near the shore.  After gazing at the scene in silence for some minutes, the sheik turned his horse and rode back to a spot near the canal, where the moisture, permeating through its banks, had given growth to a luxuriant crop of grass. Here all dismounted and tethered their horses. Four of the Arabs were appointed to watch over their safety, and the rest reascended the mound, and squatted down on the sands. Gradually the other parties of horse gathered there, and the sheiks gravely consulted together. All had a conviction that Alexandria would hold out until help came from Cairo. The question of entering the town was discussed. Presently the sound of cannon ceased, but the rattle of musketry continued unabated.  \"Why have the guns ceased firing, think you?\" the sheik asked Edgar.  \"It is one of two things, sheik. Either the French have got so close up to the walls that the cannon can no longer be brought to fire upon them, or they have stormed the walls and the fighting is now in the streets of the town.\"  \"But there are two walls,\" the sheik said; \"the one known as the Arab wall, and the inner defences. It is impossible that they can have carried both.\"  \"It would seem so,\" Edgar agreed; \"but as the musketry is as hot, or hotter, than ever, it is evident that fighting is going on at close quarters, and that either the guns cannot be fired, or they have been captured. You see the walls were in many places weak, and the attempts that have been made during the past three or four days to repair the breaches that existed were very incompletely done. I am very much afraid that it is as I said, and that the French have gained an entrance.\"  Half an hour later, a number of horsemen, followed by a crowd of people on foot, poured out from the eastern gate. One of the leading horsemen drew rein for a moment as he passed the group of Arabs.  \"The town is lost,\" he said; \"the Franks have won their way into the streets, and Koraim has surrendered.\"  An exclamation of fury broke from the Arabs.  \"It will be our turn next,\" Ben Ouafy said, shaking his spear towards the city. \"This is but the beginning of the work. They may take a city, but the sands will devour them.\"  As they knew that the French had no cavalry the Arabs remained quiet; the stream of fugitives continued to pour past them, men, women, and children.  \"We will return,\" Ben Ouafy said at last. \"We will move south and join the rest of the tribe, and then see what the government of Cairo are going to do.\"  The capture of the town had not been effected without loss. Menou's column had attacked on the right, Kleber in the centre, Bon had moved round south of the town. The Arab wall was obstinately defended, Kleber and Menou were both wounded as they led the grenadiers to the assault; Bon, however, had met with less resistance, and had captured the inner wall before the other columns succeeded in doing so. For some time the battle had raged in the streets, but the captain of a Turkish vessel had been sent by Napoleon to the governor, pointing out that further resistance would bring destruction upon the town, while if he yielded, the French troops, who came as friends to deliver them from the tyranny of the Mamelukes, would do no harm to anyone. Koraim thereupon capitulated. He was at once attached to the general staff, and charged with maintaining order in the town and disarming its inhabitants.  Proclamations were at once sent out through the country, declaring that the French had come to destroy the Mameluke domination, and that they were friends of the Sultan of Turkey. Protection was offered to all the villages that submitted; those that did not do so would be burnt. Seven hundred Turkish slaves, who had been delivered at the capture of Malta, and who had been extremely well treated, were at once sent to their homes in Tripoli, Algiers, Morocco, Syria, Smyrna, and Constantinople, being provided with ample sums of money to support them on their way. These measures had an excellent effect. Koraim sent out messengers to the Arab tribes of the neighbourhood. His influence among them was great, and their sheiks for the most part went at once into Alexandria, and agreed to keep the road open from Alexandria to Damanhour, and to sell and deliver within forty-eight hours 300 horses, 500 dromedaries, and 1000 camels. They were presented with dresses of honour and money. By this time the transports had all entered the old port of Alexandria, and were busy discharging their cargo and the troops they carried, and in a short time the whole French army was on shore.  Scarce a word was spoken among Ben Ouafy's party on their homeward ride. The sheik gave his orders on his arrival.  \"We will wait for a day or two,\" he said to Edgar as they dismounted. \"The French have no cavalry, and would not come out here. Let us see what the other tribes are going to do; we are but a small body.\"  When, two days later, a messenger arrived from Koraim, the sheik, after reading the contents of the proclamation, indignantly tore it in pieces.  \"Tell Koraim,\" he said to the messenger, \"that hitherto I have regarded him as an honourable man, now I spit upon him as a traitor. Whatever others may do, I will fight against the Franks till the last.\"  As soon as the messenger had departed, he gave orders for the tents to be struck.  \"We must be going, Sidi,\" he said; \"some of the tribes may be taken in by these promises, and may give aid to the enemy; in that case they would doubtless obey orders to attack those who refuse to do so. Three of them can each put four or five hundred spears into the field. We will move away at once. With fifty men we cannot fight two thousand.\"  The process of packing-up occupied but a short time. As soon as the tents were made into bundles the thirty camels were brought in and loaded. The women and children took their places on the top of the baggage, and then the men mounted their horses, and the cavalcade started across the desert.  \"Which way do we travel, Sidi?\"  \"We are not going direct. There are but few wells, and the distances are long between. Mounted men alone can do the journey without difficulty, but it is a painful one with women and children, and we never go that way unless in case of great necessity. We shall travel towards the south-east, keeping near the edge of the cultivated country until we reach the Nile, and then follow along the river bank until within a few miles of Cairo, thence it is three days' journey to the south-west. There is a well half-way.\"   After proceeding some ten miles, they perceived a party of Arabs galloping in the direction of Alexandria. They changed their course, however, and soon came up with the Ben Ouafy caravan. Two of the sheiks of the party rode forward and exchanged salutations with the chief.  \"Whither are you journeying, Ben Ouafy?\"  \"I am going south to join my tribe; and you--are you going to Alexandria?\"  \"I am going there at once.\"  \"Hast not the news reached you that the Franks have captured it?\"  \"Truly we have heard so, and a messenger came to us but this morning, saying that they had come to deliver us from the Turks, and inviting us to go in thither and see them. Have you not received a message also?\"  \"I received such a message, indeed, but its words were idle. For the Turks and their Mamelukes I have no great love. They prey upon the land, and enrich themselves at our expense; but the Franks would doubtless do the same, and I would rather be fleeced by those of the true faith than by kaffirs.\"  \"But they come as our friends.\"  Ben Ouafy smiled. \"Why should they come as our friends, Chief of Oulad A'Ly; what have we done for them? Why should they cross the sea in their ships at great expense and much danger, to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22225"],["title","Mary Louise in the Country (#0)"],["body","LOUISE IN THE COUNTRY  By Edith Van Dyne Author of \"Aunt Jane's Nieces Series\"   Frontispiece by J.

No, my dear; but the station isn't Cragg's Crossing, you know; it is merely the nearest railway point to our new home.\"  The conductor opened their drawing-room door.  \"The next stop is Chargrove, Colonel,\" he said.  \"Thank you.\"  The porter came for their hand baggage and a moment later the long train stopped and the vestibule steps were let down.  If you will refer to the time-table of the D. R. & G. Railway you will find that the station of Chargrove is marked with a character dagger ([Picture: Character dagger]), meaning that trains stop there only to let off passengers or, when properly signaled, to let them on. Mary Louise, during the journey, had noted this fact with misgivings that were by no means relieved when she stepped from the sumptuous train and found before her merely a shed-like structure, open on all sides, that served as station-house.  Colonel Hathaway and his granddaughter stood silently upon the platform of this shed, their luggage beside them, and watched their trunks tumbled out of the baggage car ahead and the train start, gather speed, and go rumbling on its way. Then the girl looked around her to discover that the primitive station was really the only barren spot in the landscape.  For this was no Western prairie country, but one of the oldest settled and most prosperous sections of a great state that had been one of the original thirteen to be represented by a star on our national banner. Chargrove might not be much of a railway station, as it was only eleven miles from a big city, but the country around it was exceedingly beautiful. Great oaks and maples stood here and there, some in groups and some in stately solitude; the land was well fenced and carefully cultivated; roads--smooth or rutty--led in every direction; flocks and herds were abundant; half hidden by hills or splendid groves peeped the roofs of comfortable farmhouses that evidenced the general prosperity of the community.  \"Uncle Eben is late, isn't he, Gran'pa Jim?\" asked the girl, as her eyes wandered over the pretty, peaceful scene.  Colonel Hathaway consulted his watch.  \"Our train was exactly on time,\" he remarked, \"which is more than can be said for old Eben. But I think, Mary Louise, I now see an automobile coming along the road. If I am right, we have not long to wait.\"  He proved to be right, for presently a small touring car came bumping across the tracks and halted at the end of the platform on which they stood. It was driven by an old colored man whose hair was snow white but who sprang from his seat with the agility of a boy when Mary Louise rushed forward with words of greeting.  \"My, Uncle Ebe, but it's good to see you again!\" she exclaimed, taking both his dusky hands in her own and shaking them cordially. \"How is Aunt Polly, and how is your 'rheum'tics'?\"  \"Rheum'tics done gone foh good, Ma'y Weeze,\" he said, his round face all smiles. \"Dis shuah am one prosterous country foh health. Nobuddy sick but de invahlids, an' dey jus' 'magines dey's sick, dat's all.\"  \"Glad to see you, Uncle,\" said the Colonel. \"A little late, eh?--as usual. But perhaps you had a tire change.\"  \"No, seh, Kun'l, no tire change. I was jus' tryin' to hurry 'long dat lazy Joe Brennan, who's done comin' foh de trunks. Niggehs is slow, Kun'l, dey ain't no argyment 'bout dat, but when a white man's a reg'leh loaf eh, seh, dey ain' no niggeh kin keep behind him.\"  \"Joe Brennan is coming, then?\"  \"Dat's right, Kun'l; he's comin'. Done start befoh daylight, in de lumbeh-wagin. But when I done ketch up wi' dat Joe--a mile 'n' a half away--he won't lis'n to no reason. So I dodged on ahead to tell you-uns dat Joe's on de way.\"  \"How far is it from here to Cragg's Crossing, then?\" inquired Mary Louise.  \"They call it ten miles,\" replied her grandfather, \"but I imagine it's nearer twelve.\"  \"And this is the nearest railway station?\"  \"Yes, the nearest. But usually the Crossing folks who own motor cars drive to the city to take the trains. We alighted here because in our own case it was more convenient and pleasant than running into the city and out again, and it will save us time.\"  \"We be home in half'n hour, mos' likely,\" added Uncle Eben, as he placed the suit cases and satchels in the car. Colonel Hathaway and Mary Louise followed and took their seats.  \"Is it safe to leave our trunks here?\" asked the girl.  \"Undoubtedly,\" replied her grandfather. \"Joe Brennan will doubtless arrive before long and, really, there is no person around to steal them.\"  \"I've an idea I shall like this part of the country,\" said Mary Louise musingly, as they drove away.  \"I am confident you will, my dear.\"  \"Is Cragg's Crossing as beautiful as this?\"  \"I think it more beautiful.\"  \"And how did you happen to find it, Gran'pa Jim? It seems as isolated as can be.\"  \"A friend and I were taking a motor trip and lost our way. A farmer told us that if we went to Cragg's Crossing we would find a good road to our destination. We went there, following the man's directions, and encountered beastly roads but found a perfect gem of a tiny, antiquated town which seems to have been forgotten or overlooked by map-makers, automobile guides and tourists. My friend had difficulty in getting me away from the town, I was so charmed with it. Before I left I had discovered, by dint of patient inquiry, a furnished house to let, and you know, of course, that I promptly secured the place for the summer. That's the whole story, Mary Louise.\"  \"It is interesting,\" she remarked. \"As a result of your famous discovery you sent down Uncle Eben and Aunt Polly, with our car and a lot of truck you thought we might need, and now--when all is ready--you and I have come to take possession.\"  \"Rather neatly arranged, I think,\" declared the Colonel, with satisfaction.  \"Do you know anything about the history of the place, Gran'pa, or of the people who live in your tiny, forgotten town?\"  \"Nothing whatever. I imagine there are folks Cragg's Crossing who have never been a dozen miles away from it since they were born. The village boasts a 'hotel'--the funniest little inn you can imagine--where we had an excellent home-cooked meal; and there is one store and a blacksmith's shop, one church and one schoolhouse. These, with half a dozen ancient and curiously assorted residences, constitute the shy and retiring town of Cragg's Crossing. Ah, think we have found Joe Brennan.\"  Uncle Eben drew up beside a rickety wagon drawn by two sorry nags who just now were engaged in cropping grass from the roadside. On the seat half reclined a young man who was industriously eating an apple. He wore a blue checked shirt open at the throat, overalls, suspenders and a straw hat that had weathered many seasons of sunshine and rain. His feet were encased in heavy boots and his bronzed face betokened an out-of-door life. There are a million countrymen in the United States just like Joe Brennan in outward appearance.  Joe did not stop munching; he merely stared as the automobile stopped beside him.  \"Say, you Joe!\" shouted Uncle Eben indignatly, \"wha' foh yo' done sett'n' heah?\"  \"Rest'n',\" said Joe Brennan, taking another bite from his apple.  \"Ain't yo' gwine git dem trunks home to-day?\" demanded the old darkey.  Joe seemed to consider this question carefully before he ventured to commit himself. Then he looked at Colonel Hathaway and said:  \"What I want t' know, Boss, is whether I'm hired by the hour, er by the day?\"  \"Didn't Uncle Eben tell you?\"  \"Naw, he didn't. He jes' said t' go git the trunks an' he'd gimme a dollar fer the trip.\"  \"Well, that seems to settle the question, doesn't it!\"  \"Not quite, Boss. I be'n thinkin' it over, on the way, an' a dollar's too pesky cheap fer this trip. Sometimes I gits twenty-five cents a hour fer haulin' things, an' this looks to me like a day's work.\"  \"If you made good time,\" said Colonel Hathaway, \"you might do it easily in four hours.\"  Joe shook his head.  \"Not me, sir,\" he replied. \"I hain't got the constitution fer it. An' them hosses won't trot 'less I lick 'em, an' ef I lick 'em I'm guilty o' cru'lty ter animals--includin' myself. No, Boss, the job's too cheap, so I guess I'll give it up an' go home.\"  \"But you're nearly at the station now,\" protested the Colonel.  \"I know; but it's half a mile fu'ther an' the hosses is tired. I guess I'll go home.\"  \"Oh, Gran'pa!\" whispered Mary Louise, \"it'll never do to leave our trunks lying there by the railroad tracks.\"  The Colonel eyed Joe thoughtfully.  \"If you were hired by the day,\" said he, \"I suppose you would do a day's work?\"  \"I'd hev to,\" admitted Joe. \"That's why I 'asked ye how about it. Jes' now it looks to me like I ain't hired at all. The black"]]]
