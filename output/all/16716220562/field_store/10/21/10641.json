It is of the essence of spaciality that the parts of the object shall be thought of as existing side by side, outside one another.  But this side-by-sideness, this outsideness, is after all a way in which the things present themselves to a mind.  Space is made up of relations; and what is the meaning of relations apart from a mind which relates, or _for_ which the things are related?  If spaciality were a quality of the thing in itself, it would exist no matter what became of other things.  It would be quite possible, therefore, {11} that the top of this table should exist without the bottom: yet everybody surely would admit the meaninglessness of talking about a piece of matter (no matter how small, be it an atom or the smallest electron conceived by the most recent physical speculation) which had a top without a bottom, or a right-hand side without a left.  This space-occupying quality which is the most fundamental element in our ordinary conception of matter is wholly made up of the relation of one part of it to another.  Now can a relation exist except for a mind?  As it seems to me, the suggestion is meaningless.  Relatedness only has a meaning when thought of in connection with a mind which is capable of grasping or holding together both terms of the relation.  The relation between point A and point B is not _in_ point A or _in_ point B taken by themselves.  It is all in the 'between': 'betweenness' from its very nature cannot exist in any one point of space or in several isolated points of space or things in space; it must exist only in some one existent which holds together and connects those points.  And nothing, as far as we can understand, can do that except a mind.  Apart from mind there can be no relatedness: apart from relatedness no space: apart from space no matter.  It follows that apart from mind there can be no matter.  It will probably be known to all of you that the {12} first person to make this momentous inference was Bishop Berkeley.  There was, indeed, an obscure medieval schoolman, hardly recognized by the historians of Philosophy, one Nicholas of Autrecourt, Dean of Metz,[3] who anticipated him in the fourteenth century, and other better-known schoolmen who approximated to the position; and there are, of course, elements in the teaching of Plato and even of Aristotle, or possible interpretations of Plato and Aristotle, which point in the same direction.  But full-blown Idealism, in the sense which involves a denial of the independent existence of matter, is always associated with the name of Bishop Berkeley.  I can best make my meaning plain to you by quoting a passage or two from his _Principles of Human Knowledge_, in which he extends to the primary qualities of matter the analysis which Locke had already applied to the secondary.   'But, though it were possible that solid, figured, moveable substances may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this?  Either we must know it by Sense or by Reason.--As for our senses, by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations, ideas, or those things that are immediately perceived by sense, call them what you will; but they do not inform us that things exist {13} without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are perceived.  This the Materialists themselves acknowledge.--It remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things, it must be by Reason inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense.  But what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind, from what we perceive, since the very patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend there is any _necessary_ connexion betwixt them and our ideas?  I say it is granted on all hands--and what happens in dreams, frenzies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute--that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now, though there were no bodies existing without resembling them.  Hence, it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas; since it is granted they are produced sometimes, and might possibly be produced always in the same order we see them in at present, without their concurrence.        *      *      *      *      *      *  'In short, if there were external bodies, it is impossible we should ever come to know it; and if there were not, we might have the very same reasons to think there were that we have now.  Suppose--what no one can deny possible--an intelligence _without the help of external bodies_, to be affected with the same train of sensations or ideas that you are, imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his mind.  I ask whether that intelligence hath not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances, represented by his ideas, and exciting them in his mind, that you can possibly have for believing the same thing?  Of this there can be no {14} question--which one consideration were enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments he may think himself to have, for the existence of bodies without the mind.'[4]   Do you say that in that case the tables and chairs must be supposed to disappear the moment we all leave the room?  It is true that we do commonly think of the tables and chairs as remaining, even when there is no one there to see or touch them.  But that only means, Berkeley explains, that if we or any one else were to come back into the room, we should perceive them.  Moreover, even in thinking of them as things which might be perceived under certain conditions, they have entered our minds and so proclaimed their ideal or mind-implying character.  To prove that things exist without the mind we should have to conceive of things as unconceived or unthought of.  And that is a feat which no one has ever yet succeeded in accomplishing.  Here is Berkeley's own answer to the objection:   'But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody by to perceive them.  I answer, you may so, there is no difficulty in it; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees, and {15} at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them?  But do not you yourself perceive or think of them all the while?  This therefore is nothing to the purpose: it only shews you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind; but it does not shew that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind.  To make out this, it is necessary that _you_ conceive them existing unconceived or unthought of, which is a manifest repugnancy.  When we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies, we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas.  But the mind, _taking no notice of itself_, is deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind, though at the same time they are apprehended by, or exist in, itself.  A little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said, and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of _material substance_.'[5]   Berkeley no doubt did not adequately appreciate the importance of the distinction between mere sensations and mental relations.  In the paragraph which I have read to you he tends to explain space away into mere subjective feelings: in this respect and in many others he has been corrected by Kant and the post-Kantian Idealists.  Doubtless we cannot analyse away our conception of space or of substance into mere feelings.  But relations imply mind no less than sensations.  Things are no mere {16} bundles of sensations; we do think of them as objects or substances possessing attributes.  Indeed to call them (with Berkeley), 'bundles of sensations' implies that the bundle is as important an element in thinghood as the sensations themselves.  The bundle implies what Kant would call the intellectual 'categories' of Substance, Quantity, Quality, and the like.  We do think objects: but an object is still an object of thought.  We can attach no intelligible meaning to the term 'object' which does not imply a subject.  If there is nothing in matter, as we know it, which does not obviously imply mind, if the very idea of matter is unintelligible apart from mind, it is clear that matter can never have existed without mind.  What then, it may be asked, of the things which no human eye has ever seen or even thought of?  Are we to suppose that a new planet comes into existence for the first time when first it sails into the telescope of the astronomer, and that Science is wrong in inferring that it existed not only before that particular astronomer saw it, but before there were any astronomers or other human or even animal intelligences upon this planet to observe it?  Did the world of Geology come into existence for the first time when some eighteenth-century geologist first suspected that the world was more than six thousand years old?  Are all those ages of past {17} history, when the earth and the sun were but nebulae, a mere imagination, or did that nebulous mass come into existence thousands or millions of years afterwards when Kant or Laplace first conceived that it had existed?  The supposition is clearly self-contradictory and impossible.  If Science be not a mass of illusion, this planet existed millions of years before any human--or, so far as we know, any animal minds--existed to think its existence. And yet I have endeavoured to show the absurdity of supposing that matter can exist except for a mind.  It is clear, then, that it cannot be merely for such minds as ours"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21995"],["title","Philosophy and Religion (#4)"],["body","the world has always existed. Our minds come and go.  They have a beginning; they go to sleep; they may, for aught that we can immediately know, come to an end.  At no time does any one of them, at no time do all of them together, apprehend all that there is to be known.  We do not create a Universe; we discover it piece by piece, and after all very imperfectly.  Matter cannot intelligibly be supposed to exist apart from Mind: and yet it clearly does not exist merely for _our_ minds.  Each of us knows only one little bit of the Universe: all of us together do not know the whole.  If the whole is to exist at all, there must be some one mind which knows the whole.  The mind which is necessary to the very existence of the Universe is the mind that we call God.  {18}  In this way we are, as it seems to me, led up by a train of reasoning which is positively irresistible to the idea that, so far from matter being the only existence, it has no existence of its own apart from some mind which knows it--in which and for which it exists.  The existence of a Mind possessing universal knowledge is necessary as the presupposition both of there being any world to know, and also of there being any lesser minds to know it.  It is, indeed, possible to believe in the eternal existence of limited minds, while denying the existence of the one Omniscient Mind.  That is a hypothesis on which I will say a word hereafter.[6]  It is enough here to say that it is one which is not required to explain the world as we know it.  The obvious _prima facie_ view of the matter is that the minds which apparently have a beginning, which develope slowly and gradually and in close connexion with certain physical processes, owe their origin to whatever is the ultimate source or ground of the physical processes themselves.  The order or systematic interconnexion of all the observable phenomena in the Universe suggests that the ultimate Reality must be one Being of some kind; the argument which I have suggested leads us to regard that one Reality as a spiritual Reality.  We are not yet entitled to speak of this physical Universe as _caused_ {19} by God: that is a question which I hope to discuss in our next lecture.  All that I want to establish now is that we cannot explain the world without the supposition of one universal Mind in which and for which all so-called material things exist, and always have existed.  So far I have endeavoured to establish the existence of God by a line of thought which also leads to the position that matter has no independent existence apart from conscious mind, that at bottom nothing exists except minds and their experiences.  Now I know that this is a line of thought which, to those who are unfamiliar with it, seems so paradoxical and extravagant that, even when a man does not see his way to reply to it, it will seldom produce immediate or permanent conviction the first time he becomes acquainted with it.  It is for the most part only by a considerable course of habituation, extending over some years, that a man succeeds in thinking himself into the idealistic view of the Universe.  And after all, there are many minds--some of them, I must admit, not wanting in philosophical power--who never succeed in accomplishing that feat at all.  Therefore, while I feel bound to assert that the clearest and most irrefragable argument for the existence of God is that which is supplied by the idealistic line of thought, I should be sorry to have to admit that a man {20} cannot be a Theist, or that he cannot be a Theist on reasonable grounds, without first being an Idealist.  From my own point of view most of the other reasons for believing in the existence of God resolve themselves into idealistic arguments imperfectly thought out.  But they may be very good arguments, as far as they go, even when they are not thought out to what seem to me their logical consequences.  One of these lines of thought I shall hope to develope in my next lecture; but meanwhile let me attempt to reduce the argument against Materialism to a form in which it will perhaps appeal to Common-sense without much profound metaphysical reflection.  At the level of ordinary common-sense thought there appear to be two kinds of Reality--mind and matter.  And yet our experience of the unity of Nature, of the intimate connexion between human and animal minds and their organisms (organisms governed by a single intelligible and interconnected system of laws) is such that we can hardly help regarding them as manifestations or products or effects or aspects of some one Reality.  There is, almost obviously, some kind of Unity underlying all the diversity of things.  Our world does not arise by the coming together of two quite independent Realities--mind and matter--governed by no law or by unconnected and independent systems of law.  {21} All things, all phenomena, all events form parts of a single inter-related, intelligible whole: that is the presupposition not only of Philosophy but of Science.  Or if any one chooses to say that it _is_ a presupposition and so an unwarrantable piece of dogmatism, I will say that it is the hypothesis to which all our knowledge points. It is at all events the one common meeting-point of nearly all serious thinkers.  The question remains, 'What is the nature of this one Reality?'  Now, if this ultimate Reality be not mind, it must be one of two things.  It must be matter, or it must be a third thing which is neither mind nor matter, but something quite different from either. Now many who will not follow the idealistic line of thought the whole way--so far as to recognize that the ultimate Reality is Mind--will at least admit that Idealists have successfully shown the impossibility of supposing that the ultimate Reality can be matter.  For all the properties of matter are properties which imply some relation to our sensibility or our thought.  Moreover, there is such a complete heterogeneity between consciousness and unconscious matter, considered as something capable of existing without mind, that it seems utterly impossible and unthinkable that mind should be simply the product or attribute of matter.  That the ultimate Reality cannot be what we mean by matter has been admitted by the most naturalistic, {22} and, in the ordinary sense, anti-religious thinkers--Spinoza, for instance, and Haeckel, and Herbert Spencer.  The question remains, 'Which is the easier, the more probable, the more reasonable theory--that the ultimate Reality should be Mind, or that it should be something so utterly unintelligible and inconceivable to us as a _tertium quid_--a mysterious Unknown and Unknowable--which is neither mind nor matter?' For my own part, I see no reason to suppose that our inability to think of anything which is neither matter nor mind but quite unlike either is a mere imperfection of human thought.  It seems more reasonable to assume that our inability to think of such a mysterious X is due to there being no such thing.[7]  Our only way of judging of the Unknown is by the analogy of the known. It is more probable, surely, that the world known to us should exhibit something of the characteristics of the Reality from which it is derived, or of which it forms a manifestation, than that it should exhibit none of these characteristics.  No doubt, if we were to argue from some small part of our experience, or from the detailed characteristics of one part of our experience to what is beyond our experience; if, for instance {23} (I am here replying to an objection of Höffding's), a blind man were to argue that the world must be colourless because he sees no colour, or if any of us were to affirm that in other planets there can be no colours but what we see, no sensations but what we feel, no mental powers but what we possess, the inference would be precarious enough.  The Anthropomorphist in the strict sense--the man who thinks that God or the gods must have human bodies--no doubt renders himself liable to the gibe that, if oxen could think, they would imagine the gods to be like oxen, and so on.  But the cases are not parallel.  We have no difficulty in thinking that in other worlds there may be colours which we have never seen, or whole groups of sensation different from our own: we cannot think that any existence should be neither mind nor matter, but utterly unlike either. We are not arguing from the mere absence of some special experience, but from the whole character of _all_ the thought and experience that we actually possess, of all that we are and the whole Universe with which we are in contact.  The characteristic of the whole world which we know is that it consists of mind and matter in close connexion--we may waive for a moment the nature of that connexion.  Is it more probable that the ultimate Reality which lies beyond our reach should be something which possesses the characteristics of mind, or that it should {24} be totally unlike either mind or matter?  Do you insist that we logically ought to say it might contain the characteristics of both mind and matter?  There is only one way in which such a combination seems clearly thinkable by us, _i.e._ when we represent matter as either in the idealistic sense the thought or experience of mind, or (after the fashion of ordinary realistic Theism) as created or produced by mind.  But if you insist on something more than this, if you want to think of the qualities of matter as in some other way included in the nature of the ultimate Reality as well as those of mind, at all events we could still urge that we shall get nearer to the truth by thinking of this ultimate Reality in its mind-aspect than by thinking of it in its matter-aspect.  I do not believe that the human mind is really equal to the task of thinking of a Reality which is one and yet is neither mind nor matter but something which combines the nature of both.  Practically, where such a creed is professed, the man either thinks"]]]
