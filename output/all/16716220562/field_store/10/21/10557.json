They were dressed in every way that could be thought of, except well and cleanly.  If the odds and ends of several clothing-stores had been picked up after a fire, and then about worn out, and patched and mended with bits of blankets and greasy buckskin, something like those twenty odd suits of clothes might have been produced; that is, if the man who tried to do it could have had these for a pattern.  If not, he would have failed.  The men themselves were as much out of the common way as were the clothes they wore, but they had somehow managed to keep their horses and mules in pretty good condition.  Horses and mules are of more importance than clothing to men who are far away from tailors and civilization as were these new-comers in the neighborhood of Steve's mine.  If Steve had seen them he would probably have trembled for the \"Buckhorn,\" for Murray would at once have told him that these men were miners.  That was nothing against them, certainly, and they must have been daring fellows to push their hunt for gold so far beyond any region known to such hunters.  One look at their hard, reckless faces would have convinced anybody about their \"daring.\"  They looked as if they were ready for anything.  So they were, indeed; and it is quite probable a man of Murray's experience would have guessed at once that they were ready for a good many other things besides mining.  Just now, certainly, they were thinking something else.  \"Bill,\" said the foremost rider to a man a little behind him, \"we were wrong to leave the trail of them army fellers.  We're stuck and lost in here among the mountains.\"  \"It looks like It.  We'll hev to go into camp and scout around till we find a pass.  But it wasn't any use follerin' the cavalry arter we found they was bound west.\"  \"That's so.  It won't do for us to come out on the Pacific slope.  It's Mexico or Texas for us.\"  \"We'd better say Santa Fé.\"  \"They'd make us give too close an account of ourselves there.  Some of the boys might let out somethin'.\"  \"Guess it's Mexico, then.  That isn't far away now.  But I wish I knew the way down out of this.\"  The ruins, strange and wonderful as they were, did not seem to excite any great degree of curiosity among those men.  They talked about them, to be sure, but in a way which showed that they had all seen the same sort of thing before during their wild rovings among the mountains and valleys of the great South-west.  Just such ruins are to be found in a great many places.  We do not even know how many, and nobody has been able yet to more than guess by whom they were built or when.  Mere ravines and gorges and cañons would not do for this party.  They must find a regular \"pass,\" down which they could manage to take their horses and mules and wagons.  Even before they halted, several of them had been looking and pointing toward what Murray had spoken of as \"the western gap.\"  That was the opening through the ranges which had been for a moment such a temptation to Steve Harrison.  \"It's west'ard, Bill, but it may hev to do for us.\"  \"It may take us down to some lower level, or it may show us a way south.\"  \"The great Southern Pass is down hereaway, somewhar.\"  \"Farther east than this.  We ort to strike it, though, before we cross the border.\"  \"Mexico ain't a country I'd choose to go inter, ef I hed my own way; but we've got to go for it this time.\"  But whatever may have been their reason for seeking Mexico, they were just now a good deal puzzled as to the precise path by means of which they might reach it.  It was getting late in the day, too, for any kind of exploration, and the mule-teams looked as if they had done about enough.  So it came to pass that the ruined village of the forgotten people was once more occupied.  Did they go into the houses?  No, it was the man called Bill who said it, but all the rest of them seemed to feel just as he did, when he remarked:  \"Sleep in one of them things?  No, I guess not.  Not even if it was roofed in.  They were set up too long ago to suit me.\"  That stamped him as an American, for there is no other people in the world that hate old houses.  No real American was ever known to use an old building of any kind a day longer than he could help.  He would as soon think of wearing old clothes just because they were old.  The ground near the ruins was covered with fragments of stone and fallen masonry, but there was a good camping-ground between that and the trees from which Murray and Steve had fired at the buck.  \"It's the loneliest kind of a place, Captain Skinner,\" said Bill, just after he had helped turn the mules loose on the grass.  \"I wish I knew just how lonely it is.  I kind o' smell something.\"  \"Do ye, Cap?\"  Every such band of men has its \"Captain\" of some kind, and sometimes very good discipline and order is kept up.  But Captain Skinner was hardly the man anybody would have picked out for a leader, before seeing how the rest listened to what he said, and how readily they seemed to obey him.  He was the shortest, thinnest, ugliest, and most ragged man in the whole party; and just at this moment he did not appear to be carrying any arms except the knife and pistol in his belt.  \"If I don't smell it, I can see it.  Look yonder, Bill.\"  \"That's so!  Blood!\"  It was the spot on which the buck had fallen, and in a moment more than half a dozen men were looking around in all directions.  They understood all they saw, too, as well as any Indians in the world, for in less than five minutes Captain Skinner said,  \"That'll do, boys.  We must follow that trail.  Two white hunters. They killed the buck.  Both wore moccasins.  So they ain't fresh from the settlements.  There's something queer about it.  They were on foot, and they carried off their game.\"  It was, indeed, very queer, and it would not do to let any such puzzle as that go by unsolved.  So, while several men were ordered out after game, and several more were left to guard the camp, Captain Skinner himself, with Bill and five others, armed to the teeth, set out at once on the trail of Murray and Steve Harrison.  It was easy enough to follow those two pairs of footprints as long as they were made in the grass.  After they got upon rocky ground it was not so easy, and the miners did not get ahead so fast, but they did not lose the trail for a moment.  Indeed, it was about as straight in one direction as the nature of the ground would permit.  \"Two fellers out yer among these 'ere mountains all by themselves,\" growled Bill, as they drew near the ledge at the head of the deep cañon.  \"We don't know that they're all alone yet,\" said Captain Skinner. \"They carried that deer somewhere.\"  \"Right down yonder, Captain.  They stopped here to rest from kerryin' of it, and I don't blame 'em, if they'd got to tote it down through that thar cañon.\"  \"It's a deep one, no mistake.\"  \"Captain, look yer!\" suddenly exclaimed one of the men.  \"We've lit on it this time.\"  \"The ledge?  I wasn't looking at that.\"  A perfect storm of exclamations followed from every pair of lips in the party.  Such a ledge as that they had never seen before, old mine-hunters as they were; but each one seemed inclined to ask, just as Murray had asked of Steve, what could be done with it?  Gold enough, but nothing to get it out of the rock with, and nowhere to carry it to.  It was a sad problem for men who cared for nothing in the wide world but just such ledges and just such gold.  What was the use of it?  Steve Harrison never knew it, but his mine was of a good deal of use to him and Murray just then.  It kept Captain Skinner and his men looking at it long enough for them to get nearly back to the camp of the Lipans.  \"It won't do, boys,\" said Captain Skinner, at last; \"we're wasting time.  Come on.\"  They followed him, every man turning his head as he did so to take another look at the yellow spots that shone here and there in the quartz.  Their way down the ravine was made with care and circumspection, for they did not know at what moment they might come in sight of \"those two fellers and their deer.\"  It was well for them, probably, that they were cautious, for after a good deal of steep climbing, just as they were about to clamber down one of the rocky \"stairs,\" the man called Bill exclaimed,  \"Captain, thar it is--\"  \"The deer?  They've left it.  I see it.\"  \"More'n that farther down.\"  \"A big-horn!  And if that ain't a painter lying beside it!\"  \"More'n that, Cap.  They didn't give up that thar game for nothin'.\"  \"Lay low, boys!  Git to cover right away!  Red-skins!\"  There was no difficulty in hiding among so many rocks and bowlders, and the miners were out of sight in a moment.  They could see, though, even if they were not seen, and they were soon able to count a dozen Indian warriors leading three pack-ponies as far up the ravine as four-footed beasts could be led.  \"Wonder if they've wiped out the two fellers?\" said Bill.  \"Looks like it.  Or they may have captured 'em.  Lost their game, if they haven't lost their scalps.  Wonder what tribe of redskins they are, anyhow?\"  There was a better reason than that why No Tongue and Yellow Head did not come back with their friends, but it was just as well that Captain Skinner and his miners did not understand it.  \"Captain,\" whispered one of the men near him, \"shall we let drive at 'em?  We could pick off half of 'em first fire.\"  \"Not a shot.  All we want just now is to be let alone.  I don't mind killing a few redskins.\"  \"Mebbe they killed the two fellers.\"  \"Likely as not.  I'm kind o' glad they did.  That there ledge is ours now.  Let 'em carry off their game, and then we'll climb back.  I reckon I know now how we'd best work our way down to the level those Indians came from.\"  The Lipans made short work of loading their ponies, and the moment they were out of sight the miners began their climb out of that cañon.

CHAPTER VIII  A refusal to go out with the hunters was a strange thing to come from Red Wolf.  No other young brave in that band of Apaches had a better reputation for killing deer and buffaloes.  It was a common saying among the older squaws that when he came to have a lodge of his own \"there would always be plenty of meat in it.\"  He was not, therefore, a \"lazy Indian,\" and it was something he had on his mind that kept him in the camp that day.  It had also made him beckon to Ni-ha-be, and look very hard after Rita when she hurried away toward the bushes with her three magazines of \"talking leaves.\"  Red Wolf was curious.  He hardly liked to say as much to a squaw, even such a young squaw as Ni-ha-be, and his own sister, but he had some questions to ask her, nevertheless.  He might have asked some of them of his father, but the great war-chief of that band of Apaches was now busily watching Dolores and her saucepan, and everybody knew better than to speak to him just before supper.  Ni-ha-be saw at a glance what was the matter with her haughty brother, and she was glad enough to tell him all there was to know of how and where the talking leaves had been found.  \"Did they speak to you?\"  \"No.  But I saw pictures.\"  \"Pictures of what?\"  \"Mountains; big lodges; trees; braves; pale-face squaws; pappooses; white men's bears; and pictures that lied--not like anything.\"  \"Ugh!  Bad medicine.  Talk too much.  So blue-coat soldier throw them away.\"  \"They talk to Rita.\"  \"What say to her?\"  \"I don't know.  She'll tell me.  She'll tell you if you ask her.\"  \"Ugh!  No.  Red Wolf is a warrior.  Not want any squaw talk about pictures.  You ask Rita some things.\"  \"What things?\"  \"Make the talking leaves tell where all blue-coat soldiers go.  All that camped here.  Know then whether we follow 'em.\"  \"Maybe they won't tell.\"  \"Burn some.  The rest talk then.  White man's leaves not want to tell about white man.  Rita must make them talk.  Old braves in camp say they know.  Many times the talking leaves tell the pale-faces all about Indians.  Tell where go.  Tell what do.  Tell how to find and kill. Bad medicine.\"  The \"old braves\" of many an Indian band have puzzled their heads over the white man's way of learning things and sending messages to a distance, and Red Wolf's ideas had nothing unusual in them.  If the talking leaves could say anything at all, they could be made to tell a chief and his warriors the precise things they wanted to know.  Ni-ha-be's talk with her brother lasted until he pointed to the camp-fire, where Many Bears was resting after his first attack upon the results of Mother Dolores's cooking.  \"Great chief eat.  Good time talk to him.  Go now.\"  There was no intentional lack of politeness in the sharp, overbearing tone of Red Wolf.  It was only the ordinary manner of a warrior speaking to a squaw.  It would therefore have been very absurd for Ni-ha-be to get out of temper about it; but her manner and the toss of her head as she turned away was decidedly wanting in the submissive meekness to be expected of her age and sex.  \"It won't be long before I have a lodge of my own,\" she said, positively.  \"I'll have Rita come and live with me.  Red Wolf shall not make her burn the talking leaves.  Maybe she can make them talk to me. My eyes are better than hers.  She's nothing but a pale-face, if she did get brought into my father's lodge.\"  A proud-spirited maiden was Ni-ha-be, and one who wanted a little more of \"her own way\" than she could have under the iron rule of her great father and the watchful eyes of Mother Dolores.  \"I'll go to the bushes and see Rita.  Our supper won't be ready yet for a good while.\"  It would be at least an hour, but Ni-ha-be had never seen a clock in her life, and knew nothing at all about \"hours.\"  There is no word for such a thing in the Apache language.  She was as light of foot as an antelope, and her moccasins hardly made a sound upon the grass as she parted the bushes and looked in upon Rita's hiding-place.  \"Weeping?  The talking leaves have been scolding her!  I will burn them!  They shall not say things to make her cry!\"  In a moment more her arms were around the neck of her adopted sister. It was plain enough that the two girls loved each other dearly.  \"Rita, what is the matter?  Have they said strong words to you?\"  \"No, Ni-ha-be; good words, all of them.  Only I cannot understand them all.\"  \"Tell me some.  See if I can understand them.  I am the daughter of a great chief.\"  Ni-ha-be did not know how very little help the wealth of a girl's father can give her in a quarrel with her school-books.  But just such ideas as hers have filled the silly heads of countless young white people of both sexes.  \"I can tell you some of it.\"  \"Tell me what made you cry.\"  \"I can't find my father.  He is not here.  Not in any of them.\"  \"You don't need him now.  He was only a pale-face.  Many Bears is a great chief.  He is your father now.\"  Something seemed to tell Rita that she would not be wise to arouse her friend's national jealousy.  It was better to turn to some of the pictures and try to explain them.  Very funny explanations she gave, too, but she at least knew more than Ni-ha-be, and the latter listened seriously enough.  \"Rita, was there ever such a mule as that?--one that could carry a pack under his skin?\"  It was Rita's turn now to be proud, for that was one of the pictures she had been able to understand.  She had even read enough to be able to tell Ni-ha-be a good deal about a camel.  It was deeply interesting, but the Apache maiden suddenly turned from the page to exclaim,  \"Rita, Red Wolf says the talking leaves must tell you about the blue-coat soldiers or he will burn them up.\"  \"I'm going to keep them.\"  \"I won't let him touch them.\"  \"But, Ni-ha-be, they do tell about the soldiers.  Look here.\"  She picked up another of the magazines, and turned over a few leaves.  \"There they are.  All mounted and ready to march.\"  Sure enough, there was a fine woodcut of a party of cavalry moving out of camp with wagons.  Over went the page, and there was another picture.  Ten times as many cavalry on the march, followed by an artillery force with cannon.  \"Oh, Rita!  Father must see that.\"  \"Of course he must; but that is not all.\"  Another leaf was turned, and there was a view of a number of Indian chiefs in council at a fort, with a strong force of both cavalry and infantry drawn up around them.  Rita had not read the printed matter on any of those pages, and did not know that it was only an illustrated description of campaigning and treaty-making on the Western plains.  She was quite ready to agree with Ni-ha-be that Many Bears ought to hear at once what the talking leaves had to say about so very important a matter.  It was a good time to see him now, for he was no longer very hungry, and word had come in from the hunters that they were having good success.  A fine prospect of a second supper, better than the first, was just the thing to make the mighty chief good-tempered, and he was chatting cosily with some of his \"old braves\" when Rita and Ni-ha-be drew near.  They beckoned to Red Wolf first.  \"The talking leaves have told Rita all you wanted them to.  She must speak to father.\"  Red Wolf's curiosity was strong enough to make him arrange for that at once, and even Many Bears himself let his face relax into a grim smile as the two girls came timidly nearer the circle of warriors.  After all, they were the pets and favorites of the chief; they were young and pretty, and so long as they did not presume to know more than warriors and counsellors they might be listened to.  Besides, there were the talking leaves, and Rita's white blood, bad as it was for her, might be of some use in such a matter.  \"Ugh!\"  Many Bears looked at the picture of the cavalry squad with a sudden start.  \"No lie this time.  Camp right here.  Just so many blue-coats. Just so many wagons.  Good.  Now where go?\"  Rita turned the leaf, and her Indian father was yet more deeply interested.  \"Ugh!  More blue-coats.  Great many.  No use follow.  Get all killed. Big guns.  Indians no like 'em.  Ugh!\"  If the cavalry expedition was on its way to join a larger force, it would indeed be of no use to follow it, and Many Bears was a cautious leader as well as a brave one.  Rita's news was not yet all given, however, and when the eyes of the chief fell upon the picture of the \"treaty-making\" he sprang to his feet.  \"Ugh!  Big talk come.  Big presents.  Other Apaches all know--all be there--all get blanket, gun, tobacco, new axe.  Nobody send us word, because we off on hunt beyond the mountains.  Now we know, we march right along.  Rest horse, kill game, then ride.  Not lose our share of presents.\"  Rita could not have told him his mistake; and, even if she had known it, she would have been puzzled to explain away the message of the talking leaves.  Did not every brave in the band know that that first picture told the truth about the cavalry?  Why, then, should they doubt the correctness of the rest of it?  No, a treaty there was to be, and presents were to come from the red man's \"Great Father at Washington,\" and that band of Apaches must manage to be on hand, and secure all that belonged to it, and as much more as possible.  Red Wolf had nothing more to say about burning up leaves which had talked so well, and his manner toward Rita was almost respectful as he led her and Ni-ha-be away from the group of great men that was now gathering around the chief.  Red Wolf was too young a brave to have any business to remain while gray heads were in council.  A chief would almost as soon take advice from a squaw as from a \"boy.\"  Mother Dolores had heard nothing of all this, but her eyes had not missed the slightest thing.  She had even permitted a large slice of deer-meat to burn to a crisp, in her eager curiosity.  \"What did they say to the chief?\" was her first"]]]
