CHAPTER VII THE LIBERTY SHOP  Mary Louise said to her grandfather that night, after explaining Irene's novel scheme to raise money: \"We haven't been housekeeping many years in Dorfield and I'm not sure I can find among our household possessions anything to give the Liberty Shop. But I've some jewelry and knickknacks that I never wear and, if you don't mind, Gran'pa Jim, I'll donate that to our shop.\"  The Colonel was really enthusiastic over the plan and not only approved his granddaughter's proposition to give her surplus jewelry but went over the house with her and selected quite an imposing lot of odds and ends which were not in use and could readily be spared. Eager to assist the girls, the old colonel next morning went to town and ordered a big sign painted, to be placed over the store entrance, and he also induced the editors of the two newspapers to give the Liberty Girls' latest venture publicity in their columns, inviting the cooperation of the public.  Peter Conant turned over the keys of the big store to the girls and the first load of goods to be delivered was that from the Hathaway residence.  The Liberty Girls were astonished at the success of their solicitations. From almost every house they visited they secured donations of more or less value. It may have seemed \"rubbish\" to some of the donors, but the variety of goods that soon accumulated in the store room presented an interesting collection and the girls arranged their wares enticingly and polished up the brass and copper ornaments and utensils until they seemed of considerable value.  They did not open their doors to the public for ten days, and Joe Neal began to grumble because one of his trucks was kept constantly running from house to house, gathering up the articles contributed to the Liberty Girls' Shop. But the girls induced other trucks to help Joe and the enthusiasm kept growing. Curiosity was spurred by the big sign over the closed doors, and every woman who donated was anxious to know what others had given to the shop. It was evident there would be a crowd at the formal \"opening,\" for much was expected from the unique enterprise.  Meantime, the girls were busily occupied. Each day one group solicited donations while another stayed at the store to arrange the goods. Many articles of furniture, more or less decrepit, were received, and a man was hired to varnish and patch and put the chairs, stands, tables, desks and whatnots into the best condition possible. Alora Jones thought the stock needed \"brightening,\" so she induced her father to make purchases of several new articles, which she presented the girls as her share of the donations. And Peter Conant, finding many small pieces of jewelry, silverware and bric-a-brac among the accumulation, rented a big showcase for the girls, in which such wares were properly displayed.  During these ten days of unflagging zeal the Liberty Girls were annoyed to discover that another traitorous circular had been issued. A large contingent of the selective draft boys had just been ordered away to the cantonment and the day before they left all their parents received a circular saying that the draft was unconstitutional and that their sons were being sacrificed by autocratic methods to further the political schemes of the administration. \"Mr. Wilson,\" it ended, \"is trying to make for himself a place in history, at the expense of the flesh and blood of his countrymen.\"  This vile and despicable screed was printed from the same queer type as the former circulars denouncing the Liberty Bond sale and evidently emanated from the same source. Mary Louise was the first to secure one of the papers and its envelope, mailed through the local post-office, and her indignation was only equalled by her desire to punish the offender. She realized, however, her limitations, and that she had neither the time nor the talent to unmask the traitor. She could only hope that the proper authorities would investigate the matter.  That afternoon, with the circular still in her handbag, she visited the clothing store of Jacob Kasker and asked the proprietor if he had any goods he would contribute to the Liberty Girls' Shop.  Kasker was a stolid, florid-faced man, born in America of naturalized German parents, and therefore his citizenship could not be assailed. He had been quite successful as a merchant and was reputed to be the wealthiest clothing dealer in Dorfield.  \"No,\" said Kasker, shortly, in answer to the request. Mary Louise was annoyed by the tone.  \"You mean that you _won't_ help us, I suppose?\" she said impatiently.  He turned from his desk and regarded her with a slight frown. Usually his expression was stupidly genial.  \"Why should I give something for nothing?\" he asked. \"It isn't my war; I didn't make it, and I don't like it. Say, I got a boy--one son. Do you know they've drafted him--took him from his work without his consent, or mine, and marched him off to a war that there's no good excuse for?\"  \"Well,\" returned Mary Louise, \"your boy is one of those we're trying to help.\"  \"You won't help make him a free American again; you'll just help give him knickknacks so he won't rebel against his slavery.\"  The girl's eyes flashed.  \"Mr. Kasker,\" she said sternly, \"I consider that speech disloyal and traitorous. Men are being jailed every day for less!\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  \"I believe that is true, and it proves what a free country this is--does it not? Mr. Wilson's democracy is the kind that won't allow people to express their opinions, unless they agree with him. If I say I will stand by the American constitution, they will put me in jail.\"  Mary Louise fairly gasped. She devoutly wished she had never approached this dreadful man. She felt ashamed to breathe the same air with him. But she hated to retreat without a definite display of her disgust at his perfidious utterances. Drawing the circular from her bag she spread it before him on his desk and said:  \"Read that!\"  He just glanced at it, proving he knew well its wording. Mary Louise was watching him closely.  \"Well, what about it?\" he asked brusquely.  \"It expresses your sentiments, I believe.\"  He turned upon her suspiciously.  \"You think I wrote it?\" he demanded.  \"My thoughts are my own,\" retorted Mary Louise.  Kasker's frown deepened.  \"Your thoughts may get you into trouble, my girl,\" he said slowly. \"Let me tell you this: However much I hate this war, I'm not fighting it publicly. To you I have spoken in private--just a private conversation. The trouble with me is, I talk too much; I don't know enough to keep my mouth shut. I guess I'll never learn that. I ain't a hypocrite, and I ain't a pacifist. I say the United States must win this war because it has started the job, and right or wrong, must finish it. I guess we could beat the whole world, if we had to. But I ain't fool enough to say that all they do down at Washington is right, 'cause I know it ain't. But I'm standing by the flag. My boy is standing by the flag, and he'll fight as well as any in the whole army to keep the flag flying over this great republic. By and by we'll get better congressmen; the ones we got now are accidents. But in spite of all accidents--and they're mostly our own fault--I'm for America first, last and all the time. That's Jake Kasker. I don't like the Germans and I don't like the English, for Jake Kasker is a George Washington American. What are you doing, girl?\" he suddenly asked with a change of tone.  \"I'm putting down that speech in shorthand in my notebook,\" said Mary Louise, \"and I think I've got every word of it.\" She slipped the book in her bag and picked up the circular. \"Good afternoon, Mr. Kasker!\"  The German seemed bewildered; he ran his fingers through his bushy hair as if trying to remember what he had said.  \"Wait!\" he cried, as she turned away. \"I've changed my mind about those goods; I'll send some over to your shop to be sold.\"  \"Don't do it,\" she replied, \"for we won't accept them. Only those whose patriotism rings true are allowed to help us.\"  Then she marched out of the big store, the proprietor at the desk staring at her fixedly until she had disappeared.  \"That's it, Jake,\" he said to himself, turning to his papers; \"you talk too much. If a man prints a thing, and nobody knows who printed it, he's safe.\"   CHAPTER VIII THE DETECTIVE'S DAUGHTER  \"I'm pretty sure, Gran'pa Jim,\" said Mary Louise that evening, \"that I've trailed the traitor to his lair, and he's none other than--Jake Kasker!\"  This was the first time she had mentioned her suspicion of Kasker to him, and her statement was received by the colonel with moderate surprise, followed by a doubtful smile.  \"I know Jake,\" he remarked, \"and while he is uneducated and his mind is unformed concerning most things outside the clothing business, I should hesitate to accuse him of downright disloyalty.\"  \"He's a German, and sympathizes with the Kaiser,\" asserted Mary Louise.  \"Did he say that?\"  \"Well, not in so many words.\"  \"A German-American is not usually pro-German,\" the colonel declared, \"for Germans who come to America come to escape the militarism and paternalism of the Junkers, which is proof in itself that they disapprove of what we term kaiserism. I know that Kasker talks foolishly against the war and resents the drafting of his son, but I think he is a good American at heart. He has bought Liberty Bonds more liberally than some who proclaim their patriotism from the housetops. I don't fear these outspoken objectors, my dear, as much as those who work slyly in the dark--such as the writers of those disgraceful circulars.\"  \"I practically accused Kasker of sending out those circulars,\" said Mary Louise, \"and his defense was very lame and unconvincing. Listen, Grand'pa, to what he said. I took the speech down in shorthand, and that worried him, I'm sure.\"  The colonel listened and shook his head gravely. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21876"],["title","Mary Louise and the Liberty Girls (#8)"],["body"," \"Yes, Jake Kasker talks too much,\" he confessed, \"and much that he says is disloyal to our government and calculated to do much harm, especially if widely circulated. This is no time to criticise the men who are working hard to win the war; we should render them faithful support. The task before us is difficult and it will require a united country to defeat our enemies. I must talk to Jake Kasker.\"  \"Won't it be better to let the authorities deal with him?\" suggested the girl. \"They're certain to get him, in time, if he goes on this way. I believe I frightened him a bit this afternoon, but he's too dull to take warning. Anyhow, I shall relate the whole interview to Chief Farnum to-morrow morning.\"  This she did, but the Chief gave her little satisfaction.  \"No one pays any attention to Kasker,\" he said.  \"He's a German, and a traitor!\" she insisted. \"A woman's intuition is seldom at fault, and I'm convinced he's responsible for this latest and most dreadful circular,\" and she laid it before him.  \"A girl's intuition is not as mature as a woman's intuition,\" the Chief answered in an impatient tone. \"You force me to say, my dear young lady, that you are dabbling in affairs that do not concern you. I've plenty of those circulars on file and I'm attending to my duty and keeping an eye open for the rascal who wrote them. But there is no proof that Kasker is the man. The federal officers are also investigating the case, and I imagine they will not require your assistance.\"  Mary Louise flushed but stood her ground.  \"Isn't it the duty of every patriotic person to denounce a traitor?\" she inquired.  \"Yes, if there is proof. I think you are wrong about Kasker, but if you are able to bring me proof, I'll arrest him and turn him over to the federal agents for prosecution. But, for heaven's sake, don't bother me with mere suspicions.\"  Mary Louise did not accept this rebuke graciously. She went away with the feeling that Chief Farnum was, for some reason, condoning a crime, and she was firmly resolved to obtain the required proof if it could be secured without subjecting herself to the annoyance of such rebuffs as the one she had just endured.  \"We ought not to permit such a snake in the grass to exist in dear old Dorfield,\" she told her girl associates. \"Let us all try to discover absolute proof of Kasker's treachery.\"  The other Liberty Girls were as indignant as Mary Louise, but were too intent on their present duties to pay much attention to Jake Kasker. For the Liberty Girls' Shop was now open to the public, and men, women and children crowded in to see what the girls had to offer. Sales were so brisk during the first week that the stock became depleted and once more they made a house to house canvass to obtain a new supply of material.  This kept all six of the girls busily occupied. Irene each morning rode down to the shop in the Hathaway automobile--wheel-chair and all--and acted as cashier, so as to relieve the others of this duty. She could accomplish this work very nicely and became the Liberty Girls' treasurer and financial adviser. Each day she deposited in the bank the money received, and the amounts were so liberal that enthusiasm was easily maintained.  \"The soldier boys have reason to rejoice,\" said Irene complacently, \"for we shall soon be able to provide them with numerous comforts and luxuries--all of which they are surely entitled to.\"  So the new enterprise was progressing finely when, one evening, on reaching home from a busy day at the shop, Mary Louise found a letter that greatly pleased her. It was from an old and valued girl friend in Washington and after rambling along pleasantly on a variety of subjects the writer concluded as follows:  \"But we can talk all this over at our leisure, my dear, for I'm going to accept one of your many pressing invitations (the _first_ one, of course) and make you another little visit. I love Dorfield, and I love you, and the dear Colonel, and Irene and Alora, and I long to see all of you again. Moreover, Daddy is being sent abroad on a secret mission, and I should be lonely without him. So expect me at any time. In my usual erratic fashion I may follow on the heels of this letter, or I may lag behind it for a few days, but whenever I turn up at the Hathaway gate, I'll demand a kiss and a welcome for \"JOSIE O'GORMAN.\"  Now, this girl was in many ways so entirely unlike Mary Louise that one might wonder what link of sympathy drew them together, unless it was \"the law of opposites.\" However, there was one quality in both their natures that might warrant the warm friendship existing between the two girls. Mary Louise was sweet and winning, with a charming, well-bred manner and a ready sympathy for all who were in trouble. She was attractive in person, particular as to dress, generous and considerate to a fault. The girl had been carefully reared and had well repaid the training of the gallant old colonel, her grandfather, who had surrounded her with competent instructors. Yet Mary Louise had a passion for mysteries and was never quite so happy as when engaged in studying a baffling personality or striving to explain a seeming enigma. Gran'pa Jim, who was usually her confidant when she \"scented a mystery,\" often accused her of allowing her imagination to influence her judgment, but on several occasions the girl had triumphantly proven her intuitions to be correct. You must not think, from this statement, that Mary Louise was prone to suspect everyone she met; it was only on rare occasions she instinctively felt there was more beneath the surface of an occurrence than appeared to the casual observer, and then, if a wrong might be righted or a misunderstanding removed--but only in such event--she eagerly essayed to discover the truth. It was in this manner that she had once been of great service to her friend Alora Jones, and to others as well. It was this natural quality, combined with sincere loyalty, which made her long to discover and bring to justice the author of the pro-German circulars.  Josie O'Gorman was small and \"pudgy\"--her own expression--red-haired and freckled-faced and snub-nosed. Her eyes redeemed much of this personal handicap, for they were big and blue as turquoises and as merry and innocent in expression as the eyes of a child. Also, the good humor which usually pervaded her sunny features led people to ignore their plainness. In dress, Josie was somewhat eccentric in her selections and careless in methods of wearing her clothes, but this might be excused by her engrossing interest in people, rather than in apparel.  The girl was the daughter--the only child, indeed--of John O'Gorman, an old and trusted lieutenant of the government's secret-service. From Josie's childhood, the clever detective had trained her in all the subtle art of his craft, and allowing for her youth, which meant a limited experience of human nature and the intricacies of crime, Josie O'Gorman was now considered by her father to be more expert than the average professional detective. While the astute secret-service agent was more than proud of his daughter's talent, he would not allow her to undertake the investigation of crime as a profession until she was older and more mature. Sometimes, however, he permitted and even encouraged her to \"practise\" on minor or unimportant cases of a private nature, in which the United States government was not interested.  Josie's talent drew Mary Louise to her magnetically. The detective's daughter was likewise a delightful companion. She was so well versed in all matters of national import, as well as in the foibles and peculiarities of the human race, that even conservative, old Colonel Hathaway admired the girl and enjoyed her society. Josie had visited Mary Louise more than once and was assured a warm welcome whenever she came to Dorfield. Most of the Liberty Girls knew Josie O'Gorman, and when they heard she was coming they straightway insisted she be made a member of their band.  \"She'll just _have_ to be one of us,\" said Mary Louise, \"for I'm so busy with our wonderful Shop that I can't entertain Josie properly unless she takes a hand in our game, which I believe she will be glad to do.\"  And Josie _was_ glad, and proclaimed herself a Liberty Girl the first hour of her arrival, the moment she learned what the patriotic band had already accomplished and was determined to accomplish further.  \"It's just play, you know, and play of the right sort--loyal and helpful to those who deserve the best we can give them, our brave soldiers and sailors. Count me in, girls, and you'll find me at the Liberty Shop early and late, where I promise to sell anything from an old hoopskirt to a decayed piano at the highest market price. We've had some 'rummage sales' in Washington, you know, but nothing to compare with this thorough and businesslike undertaking of yours. But I won't wear your uniform; I can't afford to allow the glorious red-white-and-blue to look dowdy, as it would on my unseemly form.\"   CHAPTER IX GATHERING UP THE THREADS  Josie O'Gorman had been in Dorfield several days before Mary Louise showed her the traitorous circulars that had been issued by some unknown obstructionist. At first she had been a little ashamed to acknowledge to her friend that a citizen of her own town could be so disloyal, but the matter had weighed heavily on her mind and so she decided to unload it upon Josie's shrewder intelligence.  \"I feel, dear, that the best service you can render us while here--the best you can render the nation, too--will be to try to discover this secret enemy,\" she said earnestly. \"I'm sure he has done a lot of harm, already, and he may do much more if he is left undisturbed. Some folks are not too patriotic, even now, when we are facing the most terrible ordeal in our history, and some are often so weak as to be influenced by what I am sure is pro-German propaganda.\"  Josie studied the various circulars. She studied the handwriting"]]]
