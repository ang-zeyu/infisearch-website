My purpose was no secret. I had my pile and wanted to enjoy life a bit and perhaps I wanted to show off a bit, too. That was only natural, I suppose. I am proud of my success.\"  \"Did you not hint that the purpose was something sinister--that you were going to have revenge, or something like that?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Very well; let us get on,\" said the captain of detectives. \"You say that you first met Rufus Shepley aboard the _Manatee_?\"  \"Never saw him in my life until I met him in the smoking room on the ship, and never had heard his name before.\"  \"That is peculiar. Mr. Shepley was a man of large affairs.\"  \"But I had been in Honduras for ten years, out of touch with men of affairs in the United States,\" Prale replied. \"I did the most of my business with firms in South America.\"  \"Just how did you happen to meet Mr. Shepley?\"  \"In the smoking room. We spoke, as passengers are liable to speak to each other on a boat or a train. We talked of ordinary things and exchanged cards.\"  \"Did you happen to _play_ cards?\"  \"One evening, for a short time. But the game did not amount to anything, and we quit early. Are you trying to insinuate that I killed the man as the outcome of a gambling quarrel?\"  \"Nothing of the sort,\" said the captain, \"Let us get on. You had no trouble with Mr. Shepley on the ship--no trouble of any sort?\"  \"Not the slightest. We parted good friends just before the ship docked. I went to my stateroom for my things and I suppose that he did the same.\"  \"When did you see him next?\" the captain asked.  \"Last evening, in the lobby of a hotel on Broadway,\" said Prale.  \"What happened then?\"  \"Ah, I see where you are trying to get the motive,\" Prale said. \"But I think that you will agree with me, before we are done, that it is a slim thing upon which to hang a serious charge of murder. I saw Mr. Shepley sitting in the lobby and went up and spoke to him. We had been friendly on the ship, I was feeling lonesome, and was glad to find somebody with whom I could talk. Besides, he had expressed a desire to see me again.\"  \"Well, what happened?\"  \"Something I am at a loss to understand. He berated me for daring to address him. He acted like a maniac. I rebuked him for his manner, and the hotel detective advised us to leave the place until we cooled off, or something like that.\"  \"Who left first?\" the captain asked.  \"I did. I was angry because there was a crowd around and I hated the scene that had been caused. I went through the main entrance and stepped to the curb.\"  \"Shepley follow you?\"  \"Almost immediately.\"  \"And you went up to him and threatened him, didn't you?\"  Prale thought a moment. \"I told him that I didn't know why he had insulted me, but I didn't want him to do it again.\"  \"What else?\" the captain demanded.  \"I believe I said that I ought to settle with him for what he had said already.\"  \"And then----\"  \"And then I went on down the street. The hotel detective, I think, heard me speak to Mr. Shepley.\"  \"Yes, I know that he did,\" said the captain. \"And the hotel detective also says that you were white with anger, and that you went off down Broadway like a man with murder in his mind. Do you care to say anything more?\"  \"Of course,\" said Prale. \"I went down to Madison Square, and there I sat down on a bench.\"  \"Meet anybody there?\"  \"I did. I met an old friend, Jim Farland, who used to be on your detective force, and who now runs a private agency.\"  \"I know Farland well, and I'll send for him.\"  \"I talked with Jim for some time,\" Prale went on. \"I told him, I believe, that I seemed to have enemies working in the dark. I told him about the scene with Shepley.\"  \"Um! What did Farland have to say?\"  \"Nothing, except that he couldn't understand why Shepley had acted so. We talked the matter over for a while and then we separated.\"  \"Very well. And where did you go next?\"  \"I walked up Fifth Avenue,\" said Prale. \"It was after nine o'clock by that time.\"  \"Go straight to your hotel?\"  \"I did not,\" Prale said.  \"Care to tell me where you went and what you did?\"  \"I have no objections. I walked up the Avenue, and met my cousin, George Lerton, the broker.\"  \"Meet him accidentally?\"  \"He overtook me--called to me.\"  \"How long did you talk to him?\"  \"For only a few minutes,\" said Prale. \"You must understand that, while George Lerton is my cousin, we are not exceptionally friendly, and never have been. We worked for the same firm ten years ago, and after I went to Honduras, George made some money and got into business for himself; at least he told me so last night.\"  \"So you merely shook hands and renewed your acquaintance?\" the captain asked.  \"There was something peculiar about the meeting,\" Prale replied.  \"In what way?\"  \"Lerton urged me to leave New York and remain away. He said that I had powerful enemies.\"  \"What about that?\"  \"It is what has been puzzling me. So far as I know, I haven't a powerful enemy on earth. I suppose I have a few business foes in Central America; a man can't make a million without acquiring some enemies at the same time. But I don't know of a single influential person who is my enemy.\"  \"Didn't Lerton explain to you?\"  \"He refused to do so,\" said Prale, \"and I told him to go his way and that I'd go mine.\"  \"Doesn't that story seem a bit weak to you, Mr. Prale?\"  \"It may, but it is a true story. Get Lerton and question him if you wish. I couldn't make him talk--maybe you can. I'd like to know the names of these enemies of mine, if I really have them.\"  \"Anything else lead you to believe you might have enemies?\"  \"Yes. I have received several anonymous notes, some on board ship and some since landing, that say something about retribution about to be visited upon me.\"  \"Why?\"  \"I don't know, captain. I never did anything in my life to merit such retribution. I am sure of that.\"  \"What time was it when you parted from Lerton?\"  \"It must have been about nine thirty or a quarter to ten.\"  \"Go to your hotel then?\"  \"No; I turned east and went to the river.\"  \"Wasn't that a peculiar thing to do at that hour of the night?\"  \"It may seem so to you,\" said Prale, \"and I scarcely can tell why I did it. I suppose it was because I wanted to think over what George Lerton had told me, and down in Honduras I always used to walk along the beach when I was thinking.\"  \"Well?\"  \"I went out on a dock and sat down in the darkness to think.\"  \"How long did you remain there?\"  \"For more than half an hour; and I had an experience. Another man came on the dock. He was going to jump into the river, but I convinced him that suicide was folly, and said I'd give him a job.\"  \"Did you?\"  \"I did,\" said Prale. \"I took him downtown and bought him some clothes, and then took him to a barber shop, and afterward to the hotel. I registered him as my valet. I call him Murk. I can prove by him that I could not have killed Rufus Shepley about eleven o'clock, because I was in Murk's company at that time.\"  \"What time did you get back to your hotel with him?\"  \"It was a few minutes of midnight. We spent considerable time buying the clothes and visiting the barber shop.\"  \"Um!\" the captain said. \"We'll have to question a few of these people. It seems peculiar to me that a millionaire would pick up a tramp and turn him into a trusted servant.\"  \"Perhaps it was peculiar. I can read men, I believe, and I decided that Murk needed only a chance, and he would make good. He was broke and friendless, and I was a millionaire and almost as friendless. That's the only way I can explain it.\"  \"I'm going to send you to another office under guard, Mr. Prale,\" the captain said. \"I'll have these people here in a short time, and we'll question them. Just tell me where you bought the clothes for this man, and what barber shop you visited.\"  Sidney Prale did so, and the captain of detectives made notes regarding the addresses.  \"That will be all for the present, Mr. Prale,\" he said. \"I don't want to cause any innocent man annoyance, but I can tell you this much--things look very bad for you!\"     CHAPTER VIII  LIES AND LIARS   Sidney Prale waited in an adjoining office, a detective sitting in one corner of it and watching him closely. It was almost a prison room, for there were steel bars at the windows, and only the one door. Prale walked to one of the windows and looked down at the street, his arms folded across his breast, trying to think it out.  The finding of that fountain pen in the room beside Rufus Shepley's body was what puzzled and bothered him the most. How on earth could it have come there? He tried to remember when he had used it last, when he had last seen it. All that he could recall was that, the afternoon before, he had used it to write a note in a memorandum book. How and where had he lost it, and how had it come into Shepley's suite? Had he dropped it in the hotel lobby during his short quarrel with Shepley, while he was shaking the man? Had Shepley picked it up later and carried it home with him? Prale did not think Shepley would have done that under the circumstances.  Well, he'd be at liberty soon enough, he told himself. It was natural for the police to learn of his quarrel with Shepley and to make an arrest on the strength of that and of finding the fountain pen. His alibi was perfect; they soon would know that he could not have committed the crime.  It was almost an hour later when he was taken back into the other room again. Prale had spent the time standing before the window, smoking and trying to think things out. The captain of detectives was before his desk when Prale was ushered into the office.  \"I've been investigating your story, Mr. Prale,\" the captain said, looking at him peculiarly. \"It always has been a mystery to me why a man keen in business and supposed to possess brains goes to pieces when he commits a crime and tells a tale that is full of holes.\"  \"I beg your pardon!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21894"],["title","The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets (#0)"],["body","Team at https://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from scans of public domain material produced by Microsoft for their Live Search Books site.)

GROSSET & DUNLAP, Publishers, New York  COPYRIGHT, 1917, BY EDWARD STRATEMEYER   _The Rover Boys at Colby Hall_     INTRODUCTION   MY DEAR BOYS: This book is a complete story in itself, but forms the first volume in a line issued under the general title, \"The Second Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  As mentioned in several of the other volumes of the first series, this line was started a number of years ago with the publication of \"The Rover Boys at School,\" in which my readers were introduced to Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover, three wide-awake American lads. In that volume and in those which followed I gave the particulars of their adventures while attending Putnam Hall Military Academy, Brill College, and while on numerous outings, both in our own country and abroad.  The Rover boys were, of course, growing older; and, having met three young ladies very much to their liking, each married and settled down, as related in detail in the several volumes immediately preceding this. They were well established in business; and in due course of time Dick Rover was blessed with a son, as was also Sam, while the fun-loving Tom became the proud possessor of a pair of twins who were as full of life as their father had ever been.  In this volume the younger Rover boys are old enough to go to boarding school. They are sent to Colby Hall Military Academy, presided over by an old friend and schoolmate of their fathers; and there they make both friends and enemies, and have numerous adventures.  In the beginning this chronicle of the younger Rovers, I wish to thank my numerous readers for all the kind things they have said about the other volumes in these series, and I trust that they will make just as good friends of Jack, Andy and Randy, and Fred as they did of Dick, Tom, and Sam Rover.  Affectionately and sincerely yours,  EDWARD STRATEMEYER.

But don't be too severe with 'em,\" pleaded Tom Rover. \"Remember, boys will be boys.\"  \"That's true, Tom. But we've got to take 'em in hand sooner or later,\" remonstrated his brother Sam. \"If we don't, they'll grow up the wildest bunch ever known.\"  A number of cries of alarm and protest, mingled with fierce cheering, had reached the house from the garden just beyond the broad veranda. As the three Rover brothers hurried through the hallway and outside, the yelling and cheering were renewed. Then, just as Tom Rover stepped out on the veranda, there was a sudden swish and a stream of water from a garden hose caught him directly in the left ear.  \"Hi! Hi! Stop that!\" cried Tom Rover, doing his best to dodge the stream of water, which suddenly seemed to play all over the piazza. \"What do you mean by wetting me this way?\"  \"It wasn't my fault, Dad,\" came from a boy standing on the lawn, both hands clutching a rubber hose held, also, by another boy of about the same age. \"It was Fred who turned the hose that way.\"  \"Nothing of the sort! It was Randy twisted it that way trying to get it away from me,\" cried Fred Rover. \"And he isn't going to do it!\" and thereupon ensued a struggle between the two boys which caused the stream of water to fly over the garden first in one direction and then another.  In the meanwhile, not far away another stream of water was issuing from a hose held by two other lads. This, as well as the water from hose number one, had been directed towards the back of the garden, where an elderly white man and an equally elderly colored man were trying to shelter themselves behind a low hedge to keep from becoming drenched.  \"Fo' de lan's' sake, Massa Dick! won't you make dem boys stop?\" cried out the old colored man, when he caught sight of Dick Rover hurrying out on the lawn. \"Dem boys is jest nacherly tryin' to drown old Aleck Pop, dat's what dey is!\"  \"They didn't have no call to touch them hoses,\" came from the elderly white man. \"I tol' 'em they mustn't muss with the water; but they won't mind nohow!\" and thus speaking old Jack Ness held up his hands in comic despair.  \"Why! we didn't know you were behind the hedge,\" came from one of the boys holding the second hose. \"We thought you were both down at the barn.\"  \"You can't make believe like that, Andy Rover!\" returned the old man of all work, shaking his head vigorously. \"You knowed I was goin' to trim up this hedge a bit and that Aleck was goin' to help me.\"  \"You boys let up with this nonsense,\" came sternly from Tom Rover. He turned to face one of his twins. \"Randy, I ought to give you a thrashing for wetting me like this.\"  \"Don't Fred get half the thrashing?\" questioned Randy Rover, quizzically, for he could readily see that his parent was not as angry as his words seemed to imply. \"I don't like to be selfish, you know. He can have more than his share if he wants it.\"  \"You'll take your own thrashings--I don't want 'em,\" broke in his cousin Fred quickly.  \"Jack,\" cried Dick Rover, turning to his son, \"turn that water off at once.\"  \"I don't know where to turn it off. I didn't turn it on,\" answered Jack Rover, the oldest of the four boys who had been fooling.  \"I'll turn it off and fix it so they can't turn it on ag'in,\" came from old Jack Ness, and away hobbled the man of all work.  \"I think it's a shame for you boys to drench old Ness and Aleck,\" was Sam Rover's sober comment. \"Both of them might catch cold or get rheumatism.\"  \"We didn't start to "]]]
