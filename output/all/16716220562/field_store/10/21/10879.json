A contemporary of the saintly Ulfilas (who surely should be accepted as the first national hero of the Bulgarians) states that Ulfilas had originally lived on the other side of the Danube and had been driven by persecution to settle in Bulgaria. This contemporary, Auxentius, records:      And when, through the envy and mighty working of the enemy,     there was kindled a persecution of the Christians by an     irreligious and sacrilegious Judge of the Goths, who spread     tyrannous affright through the barbarian land, it came to pass     that Satan, who desired to do evil, unwillingly did good; that     those whom he sought to make deserters became confessors of the     faith; that the persecutor was conquered, and his victims wore     the wreath of victory. Then, after the glorious martyrdom of     many servants and handmaids of Christ, as the persecution still     raged vehemently, after seven years of his episcopate were     expired, the blessed Ulfilas being driven from \"Varbaricum\" with     a great multitude of confessors, was honourably received on the     soil of Roumania by the Emperor Constantius of blessed memory.     Thus as God by the hand of Moses delivered His people from the     violence of Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and made them pass     through the Red Sea, and ordained that they should serve Him [on     Mount Sinai], even so by means of Ulfilas did God deliver the     confessors of His only-begotten Son from the \"Varbarian\" land,     and cause them to cross over the Danube, and serve Him upon the     mountains [of Haemus] like his saints of old.  Ulfilas civilised as well as Christianised the Goths of Bulgaria, and was responsible for the earliest Gothic alphabet--the Moeso-Gothic. He translated most of the Scriptures into Gothic, leaving out of his translation only such war stories as \"the Book of Kings,\" judging that these would be too exciting for his Gothic flock and would incite them to war.  [Illustration: A SHÃ”P WOMAN OF THE DISTRICT OF SOFIA]  After a century of peace war broke out again between the Goths and the Roman Empire--which may now be called rather the Greek Empire--in A.D. 369. The course of the war was at first favourable to the Emperor Valens. All the independent Goths were driven back behind the Danube boundary, but were allowed to live there in peace. The Roman orator Themistius, in congratulating the Emperor Valens, put on record the extent of his achievement and of his magnanimity:      But now, along almost all the frontiers of the Empire, peace     reigns, and all the preparation for war is perfect; for the     Emperor knows that they most truly work for peace who thoroughly     prepare for war. The Danube-shore teems with fortresses, the     fortresses with soldiers, the soldiers with arms, the arms both     beautiful and terrible. Luxury is banished from the legions, but     there is an abundance of all necessary stores, so that there is     now no need for the soldier to eke out his deficient rations by     raids on the peaceful villagers. There was a time when the     legions were terrible to the provincials, and afraid of the     barbarians. Now all that is changed: they despise the barbarians     and fear the complaint of one plundered husbandman more than an     innumerable multitude of Goths.      To conclude, then, as I began. We celebrate this victory by     numbering not our slaughtered foes but our living and tamed     antagonists. If we regret to hear of the entire destruction even     of any kind of animal, if we mourn that elephants should be     disappearing from the province of Africa, lions from Thessaly,     and hippopotami from the marshes of the Nile, how much rather,     when a whole nation of men, barbarians it is true, but still     men, lies prostrate at our feet, confessing that it is entirely     at our mercy, ought we not instead of extirpating, to preserve     it, and make it our own by showing it compassion?  Valens restored Bulgaria to the position of a wholly Roman province, even the Gothic Minores being driven across the Danube. But there was now to come another racial element into the making of Bulgaria--the Huns.  I can still recall the resentment and indignation of the Bulgarian officers in 1913 because a French war correspondent had, in a despatch which had escaped the Censor, likened the crossing of the Thracian Plain by the great convoys of Bulgarian ox-wagons to the passage of the Danube by the Huns in the fourth century. The Bulgarians, always inclined to be sensitive, thought that the allusion made them out to be barbarians. But it was intended rather, I think, to show the writer's knowledge of the early history of the Balkan Peninsula and of the close racial ties between the Bulgarians of to-day and the original Huns. We have seen how the Gothic invasion, coming from the Baltic to the Black Sea, pushed on to the borders of the Hun people living east of the Volga. These Huns now prepared an answering wave of invasion.  To the Goths the Huns--the first of the Tartar hordes to invade Europe--were a source of superstitious terror. The Gothic historian Jordanes writes with frank horror of them:      We have ascertained that the nation of the Huns, who surpassed     all others in atrocity, came thus into being. When Filimer,     fifth king of the Goths, after their departure from Sweden, was     entering Scythia, with his people, as we have before described,     he found among them certain sorcerer-women, whom they call in     their native tongue Haliorunnas, whom he suspected and drove     forth from his army into the wilderness. The unclean spirits     that wander up and down in desert places, seeing these women,     made concubines of them; and from this union sprang that most     fierce people, the Huns, who were at first little, foul,     emaciated creatures, dwelling among the swamps and possessing     only the shadow of human speech by way of language.      According to Priscus they settled first on the eastern shore of     the Sea of Azof, lived by hunting, and increased their substance     by no kind of labour, but only by defrauding and plundering     their neighbours.      Once upon a time when they were out hunting beside the Sea of     Azof, a hind suddenly appeared before them, and having entered     the water of that shallow sea, now stopping, now dashing     forward, seemed to invite the hunters to follow on foot. They     did so, through what they had before supposed to be trackless     sea with no land beyond it, till at length the shore of Scythia     lay before them. As soon as they set foot upon it, the stag that     had guided them thus far mysteriously disappeared. This, I trow,     was done by those evil spirits that begat them, for the injury     of the Goths. But the hunters who had lived in complete     ignorance of any other land beyond the Sea of Azof were struck     with admiration of the Scythian land and deemed that a path     known to no previous age had been divinely revealed to them.     They returned to their comrades to tell them what had happened,     and the whole nation resolved to follow the track thus opened     out before them. They crossed that vast pool, they fell like a     human whirlwind on the nations inhabiting that part of Scythia,     and offering up the first tribes whom they overcame, as a     sacrifice to victory, suffered the others to remain alive, but     in servitude.      With the Alani especially, who were as good warriors as     themselves, but somewhat less brutal in appearance and manner of     life, they had many a struggle, but at length they wearied out     and subdued them. For, in truth, they derived an unfair     advantage from the intense hideousness of their countenances.     Nations whom they would never have vanquished in fair fight fled     horrified from those frightful--faces I can hardly call them,     but rather--shapeless black collops of flesh, with little points     instead of eyes. No hair on their cheeks or chins gives grace to     adolescence or dignity to age, but deep furrowed scars instead,     down the sides of their faces, show the impress of the iron     which with characteristic ferocity they apply to every male     child that is born among them, drawing blood from its cheeks     before it is allowed its first taste of milk. They are little in     stature, but lithe and active in their motions, and especially     skilful in riding, broad-shouldered, good at the use of the bow     and arrows, with sinewy necks, and always holding their heads     high in their pride. To sum up, these beings under the form of     man hide the fierce nature of the beast.  That was a view very much coloured by race prejudice and the superstitious fears of the time. It suggests that at a very early period of Balkan history the different races there had learned how to abuse one another. English readers might contrast it with Matthew Arnold's picture of a Tartar camp in _Sohrab and Rustum_:        The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog     From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.     And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed     Into the open plain; so Haman bade--     Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled     The host, and still was in his lusty prime.     From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;     As when some grey November morn the files,     In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes     Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes     Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,     Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound     For the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd.     The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,     First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;     Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come     And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.     Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,     The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],["title","Bulgaria (#4)"],["body","     And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;     Light men and on light steeds, who only drink     The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.     And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came     From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;     The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks     Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards     And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes     Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,     Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray     Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,     Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;     These all filed out from camp into the plain.  Matthew Arnold gives to the Tartar camp tents of lattice-work, thick-piled carpets; to the Tartar leaders woollen coats, sandals, and the sheep-skin cap which is still the national head-dress of the Bulgarians. More important, in proof of his idea of their civilisation, he credits them with a high sense of chivalry and a faithful regard for facts. _Sohrab and Rustum_ is, of course, a flight of poetic fancy; but its \"local colour\" is founded on good evidence. Probably the Huns, despite the terrors of their name, the echoes of which still come down the corridors of time; despite the awful titles which their leaders won (such as Attila, \"the Scourge of God\"), were not on a very much lower plane of civilisation than the Goths with whom they fought, or with the other barbarians who tore at the prostrate body of the Roman Empire. One may see people of very much the same type to-day on the outer edges of Islam in some desert quarters; one may see and, if one has such taste for the wild and the free in life as has Cunninghame Graham, one may admire:      There in the Sahara the wild old life, the life in which man and     the animals seem to be nearer to each other than in the     countries where we have changed beasts into meat-producing     engines deprived of individuality, still takes its course, as it     has done from immemorial time. Children respect their parents,     wives look at their husbands almost as gods, and at the tent     door elders administer what they imagine justice, stroking their     long white beards, and as impressed with their judicial     functions as if their dirty turbans or ropes of camels' hair     bound round their heads, were horse-hair wigs, and the torn mat     on which they sit a woolsack or a judge's bench, with a carved     wooden canopy above it, decked with the royal arms.      Thus, when the blue baft-clad, thin, wiry desert-dweller on his     lean horse or mangy camel comes into a town, the townsmen look     on him as we should look on one of Cromwell's Ironsides, or on a     Highlander, of those who marched to Derby and set King George's     teeth, in pudding time, on edge.  The Huns' movement from the north-east was the first Asiatic invasion of Europe since the fall of the Persian Empire. Almost simultaneously with it the Saracen first entered from the south, as the ally of the Christian Emperor against the Goths; and another Gothic chronicler, Ammianus, tells how the Saracen warriors inspired also a lively horror in the Gothic mind. They came into battle almost naked, and having sprung upon a foe \"with a hoarse and melancholy howl, sucked his life-blood from his throat.\" The Saracen of Ammianus was the forerunner of the Turk, the Hun of Jordanes, the forerunner of the Bulgarian. In neither case, of course, can the Gothic chronicler be accepted as an unprejudiced witness. But it is interesting to note how the first warriors from the Asiatic steppes impressed their contemporaries!  The first effect of the invasion of the country of the Goths by the Huns was to force the Goths to recross the Danube and trespass again on Roman territory. They sought leave from the Emperor Valens to do this. A contemporary historian records:      The multitude of the Scythians escaping from the murderous     savagery of the Huns, who spared not the life of woman or of     child, amounted to not less than 200,000 men of fighting age     [besides old men, women, and children]. These, standing upon the     river-bank in a state of great excitement, stretched out their     hands from afar with loud lamentations, and earnestly     supplicated that they might be allowed to cross over the river,     bewailing the calamity that had befallen them, and promising     that they would faithfully adhere to the Imperial alliance if     this boon were granted them.  [Illustration: A WOMAN OF THRACE, OF THE SHÃ”P TRIBE, AND OF MACEDONIA The ShÃ´ps inhabit the Mountain District of Sofia]  The Emperor Valens allowed the Gothic host to cross the Danube into Bulgaria and Thrace, and having given them shelter, starved them and treated them so harshly and cruelly that they were close to rebellion when another great Gothic host, under King Fritigern, crossed the Danube without leave and came down as far as Marcianople (now Schumla). Here he was entertained at a \"friendly\" banquet by the Roman general Lupicinus. But whilst the banquet was in progress disorder arose among the Goths and the Romans outside the hall. The Gothic historians tell:      News of this disturbance was brought to Lupicinus as he was     sitting at his gorgeous banquet, watching the comic performers     and heavy with wine and sleep. He at once ordered that all the     Gothic soldiers, who, partly to do honour to their rank, and     partly as a guard to their persons, had accompanied the generals     into the palace, should be put to death. Thus, while Fritigern     was at the banquet, he heard the cry of men in mortal agony, and     soon ascertained that it proceeded from his own followers shut     up in another part of the palace, whom the Roman soldiers at the     command of their general were attempting to butcher. He drew his     sword in the midst of the banqueters, exclaimed that he alone     could pacify the tumult which had been raised among his     followers, and rushed out of the dining-hall with his     companions. They were received with shouts of joy by their     countrymen outside; they mounted their horses and rode away,     determined to revenge their slaughtered comrades.      Delighted to march once more under the generalship of one of the     bravest of men, and to exchange the prospect of death by hunger     for death on the battlefield, the Goths at once rose in arms.     Lupicinus, with no proper preparation, joined battle with them     at the ninth milestone from Marcianople, was defeated, and only     saved himself by a shameful flight. The barbarians equipped     themselves with the arms of the slain legionaries, and in truth     that day ended in one blow the hunger of the Goths and the     security of the Romans; for the Goths began thenceforward to     comport themselves no longer as strangers but as inhabitants,     and as lords to lay their commands upon the tillers of the soil     throughout all the Northern provinces.  That began a war which inflicted the third great blow on the Roman Empire--the defeat and death of the Emperor Valens before Adrianople. The Goths in this campaign seem to have brought in some of their old enemies, the Huns, as allies--pretty clear proof of the contention I have set up that the Huns were not such desperate savages; but these Asiatics made the war rather more brutal than was usual for those days, without a doubt. Theodosius, the younger (son of that brave general who had just won back Britain for the Roman Empire), restored somewhat the Roman power in the provinces south of the Balkans for a time. But in the year 380 the Romans made peace again with the Goths, allowing them to settle in Bulgaria as well as north of the Danube as allies of the Roman Power.  In the latter part of the fourth century and the first half of the fifth century the Huns fill the pages of Bulgarian history. Then came the Slavs; and then, in the seventh century, the Bulgars, almost certainly a Hun tribe, but Huns modified by two centuries of time. But the death of Valens may be said to have ended the Roman Empire as a World Power. Let us retrace our steps a little and give the chief facts as to how a Bulgarian Empire for a time--a very short time--replaced the Roman Empire over a great area of the Balkan Peninsula.     CHAPTER III  THE SCRAP-HEAP OF RACES   The historian, rightly, must always march under a banner inscribed \"Why?\" The facts of history bring no real informing to the human mind unless they can be traced to their causes, and thus a chain of events followed link by link to see why some happening was so fruitful in results, and to search for the relation of apparently isolated and accidental incidents.  The Balkan Peninsula has to-day just emerged from a most bloody war. It prepares for another to break out as soon as the exhaustion of the moment has passed. Since ever the pages of history were inscribed it has been vexed by savage wars. Why?  There is an explanation near at hand and clear. In the Balkans there is a geographical area, which could house one nation comfortably, and is occupied by the scraps of half a dozen nations.  (1) There are the remnants of the Turks who at one time threatened the conquest of all Europe. Back from the walls of Vienna they have been driven little by little until now they occupy the toe only of the Balkan Peninsula. But the days have not far departed when they held almost all the Peninsula, and the present smallness of their portion dates back only from 1913.  (2) There are the Greeks, heirs of the traditions of Philip and Alexander, and of the old Roman Empire. For centuries their national but not their racial existence was dormant under the heel of the Turk. Greek independence was restored recently, and since the war of 1912-1913 has established itself vigorously.  (3) There are the Roumanians, descendants of the old Roman colony of Trajan in Dacia.  (4) There are the Bulgars, originally a Tartar people coming from the banks of the Volga, who"]]]
