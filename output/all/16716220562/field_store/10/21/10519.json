I immediately brought this to the notice of the chief clerks of     (p. xxxi) the Navy and of the Treasury Departments, and also to that of Captain (now Rear-Admiral) George H. Preble, a connection of the commodore's, and these dies are now where they belong, in the Mint in Philadelphia. Shortly afterward I was also instrumental in having restored to the mint the dies of the Vanderbilt medal, which were lying in the cellar of one of the New York city banks.  I have found it impossible to obtain any trustworthy information respecting the designer and the engraver of the medal, voted on March 29, 1800, in honor of Captain Thomas Truxtun. As there were no competent medallists in the United States at the period, and as we were then at war with France, it is presumable that the dies were made in England. If so, they were probably cut at the private mint of Matthew Boulton, of Birmingham, who furnished the United States Government for a long time with planchets for its copper coinage.  The work now offered to the public consists of two volumes: Volume I., Text; Volume II., Plates.  The text is subdivided into eighty-six sections, corresponding to the number of the medals, in each of which is included, besides the descriptive matter, all the documents that could be obtained relating to the respective piece, and arranged according to the following plan:  1. The number of the medal, its date, and its number in the book of plates. The medals are arranged chronologically: those voted by Congress according to the dates of the several resolutions or acts awarding them, and not in the order of the events which they commemorate; the unofficial ones in the order of events which they commemorate; and the presidential pieces according to the date   (p. xxxii) of inauguration of each President.  2. The descriptive titles of each medal, in the following order: 1st, the legends of the obverse and of the reverse; 2d, the name of the person honored, or of the title by which the piece is known; 3d, the event commemorated.  3. A description of the medal, beginning with the obverse: 1st, the whole legend; 2d, the description of the emblems and devices; 3d, the legend of the exergue; 4th, the names of the designer and of the engraver. The same order has been followed for the reverse. The legends are copied exactly from the medals, and when in Latin, translated; the abbreviations are explained, and are, like the translations, placed between parentheses. The words, \"facing the right\" and \"facing the left\" mean the right or the left of the person looking at the piece.  4. A short biographical sketch of the designers and of the engravers.  5. A short biographical sketch of the person in whose honor the medal was struck, or of the President of the United States, in case of the Indian peace tokens.  6. Original documents, such as Resolutions or Acts of Congress, the official reports of the events commemorated, and letters of interest.  The original documents have been given in the belief that the reader would prefer them to a mere recital of the events of which they treat. Many of these are now printed for the first time.  It is interesting to note that Mr. Jefferson, as early as 1789, entertained the idea of publishing an account of all the        (p. xxxiii) American medals struck up to that time, as will be seen from the following letter;       To        M. DUPRÉ,           Engraver of Medals, Paris.       Mr. Jefferson is going to have a description of all the medals      printed, in order to send them, with copies of the medals, to the      sovereigns of Europe. The one of Mr. Franklin, made by M. Dupré,      is wanting; he begs you to lend him a copy, and to communicate to      him the description also, if any has been made, as is probable.       February 23, 1789[17].                     [Footnote 17: The original of this letter, which is                    in French, and which was communicated to me in                    Paris by M. Narcisse Dupré, is undoubtedly in the                    handwriting of Mr. Jefferson. I have sought in vain                    for the document mentioned in it. See I, page 1.]  No mention is made of the size of the medals, as the plates show their exact dimensions.  Being desirous that the execution of the engravings should be as perfect as possible, I invited M. Jules Jacquemart, of Paris, to undertake the whole of them. M. Jacquemart needs no praise. All amateurs know his etchings from Van der Meer, Franz Hals, Rembrandt, etc., and his plates for the \"History of Porcelain,\" by M. Albert Jacquemart, his father, for the \"Gems and Jewels of the Crown,\" published by M. Barbet de Jouy, and for the \"Collection of Arms\" of Count de Nieuwerkerke. The American public has had, moreover, an opportunity of admiring the works of this eminent artist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York city. His collaboration adds great value to the artistic portion of this work.     ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS                                               (p. xxxiv)  REFERRED TO IN THE INTRODUCTION.  A                                           Mount Vernon, November, 1787.      To        THE PRINTER OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM (Mr. CAREY.)       Sir: I understand that a part, if not all, of the medals which,      in the course of the late war, were voted by Congress to officers      of distinguished merit, and for the execution of which I      contracted with artists at Paris, have lately arrived in America.      But, not having seen any account published of the devices and      inscriptions, I presume it will not be ungrateful to the public      to receive some authentic information respecting these memorials      of national glory. However superfluous the publication of the      correspondence[18] on this subject with the Perpetual Secretary      of the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres might be      deemed, it will not, I conceive, be improper it should be known      that this learned society, to whom a reference was made, entered      on the discussion with the same alacrity as if the subject had      been designed to illustrate the actions of their compatriots, or      to immortalize some glorious events in the annals of their own      nation. You will be at liberty to insert in your _Museum_ the      result of their deliberations.       In our free republics certainly nothing should be suppressed that      can tend to awaken a noble spirit of emulation, to cherish the      fine feelings of patriotism, to exhibit alluring examples for      imitation, or to extend and perpetuate the remembrance of those      heroic achievements which have ennobled the era of the American      Revolution. Few inventions could be more happily calculated to      diffuse the knowledge and preserve the memory of illustrious      characters and splendid events than medals--whether we take into      consideration the imperishable nature of the substance whence      they are formed, the facility of multiplying copies, or the      practice of depositing them in the cabinets of the curious.      Perhaps one improvement might be made. The sage and venerable Dr.      Franklin, whose patriotic genius is active in old age, and ever      prolific in projects of public utility, once suggested,[19] in      conversation with me, as an expedient for propagating still more      extensively the knowledge of facts designed to be perpetuated in      medals, that their devices should be impressed on the current      coin of the nation.       Under influence of such ideas, I shall claim the indulgence  (p. xxxv)      of my countrymen for bringing forward a communication which might      possibly have come more satisfactorily from some other quarter.      An apprehension that the subject might remain unnoticed is my      apology.       I am, Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,                                              David HUMPHREYS.
