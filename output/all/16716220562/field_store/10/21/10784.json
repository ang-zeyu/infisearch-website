If one of them breaks a leg or loses an arm or gets too old to work, I turn him loose without complaining, and he is free to go home if he wants to.  \"But are they contented? Do they show any gratitude? Not at all. Scarcely a day passes that I don't hear of some fresh soldiering. And, what is worse, they have stirred up some of my own people--the carpenters, stone-cutters, gang bosses and so on. Every now and then my inspectors find some rotten libel cut on a stone--something to the effect that I am overworking them, and knocking them about, and holding them against their will, and generally mistreating them. I haven't the slightest doubt that some of these inscriptions have actually gone into the pyramid: it's impossible to watch every stone. Well, in the years to come, they will be dug out and read by strangers, and I will get a black eye. People will think of Cheops as a heartless old rapscallion--_me_, mind you! Can you beat it?\"     _V.--THE ARTIST_  _V.--The Artist. A Drama Without Words_   CHARACTERS:    A GREAT PIANIST   A JANITOR   SIX MUSICAL CRITICS   A MARRIED WOMAN   A VIRGIN   SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-THREE OTHER WOMEN   SIX OTHER MEN   PLACE--_A City of the United States._  TIME--_A December afternoon._  (_During the action of the play not a word is uttered aloud. All of the speeches of the characters are supposed to be unspoken meditations only._)  _A large, gloomy hall, with many rows of uncushioned, uncomfortable seats, designed, it would seem, by some one misinformed as to the average width of the normal human pelvis. A number of busts of celebrated composers, once white, but now a dirty gray, stand in niches along the walls. At one end of the hall there is a bare, uncarpeted stage, with nothing on it save a grand piano and a chair. It is raining outside, and, as hundreds of people come crowding in, the air is laden with the mingled scents of umbrellas, raincoats, goloshes, cosmetics, perfumery and wet hair._  _At eight minutes past four,_ THE JANITOR, _after smoothing his hair with his hands and putting on a pair of detachable cuffs, emerges from the wings and crosses the stage, his shoes squeaking hideously at each step. Arriving at the piano, he opens it with solemn slowness. The job seems so absurdly trivial, even to so mean an understanding, that he can't refrain from glorifying it with a bit of hocus-pocus. This takes the form of a careful adjustment of a mysterious something within the instrument. He reaches in, pauses a moment as if in doubt, reaches in again, and then permits a faint smile of conscious sapience and efficiency to illuminate his face. All of this accomplished, he tiptoes back to the wings, his shoes again squeaking._   THE JANITOR  Now all of them people think I'm the professor's tuner. (_The thought gives him such delight that, for the moment, his brain is numbed. Then he proceeds._) I guess them tuners make pretty good money. I wish I could get the hang of the trick. It _looks_ easy. (_By this time he has disappeared in the wings and the stage is again a desert. Two or three women, far back in the hall, start a halfhearted handclapping. It dies out at once. The noise of rustling programs and shuffling feet succeeds it._)   FOUR HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN  Oh, I do _certainly_ hope he plays that lovely _Valse Poupée_ as an encore! They say he does it better than Bloomfield-Zeisler.   ONE OF THE CRITICS  I hope the animal doesn't pull any encore numbers that I don't recognize. All of these people will buy the paper to-morrow morning just to find out what they have heard. It's infernally embarrassing to have to ask the manager. The public expects a musical critic to be a sort of walking thematic catalogue. The public is an ass.   THE SIX OTHER MEN  Oh, Lord! What a way to spend an afternoon!   A HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN  I wonder if he's as handsome as Paderewski.   ANOTHER HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN  I wonder if he's as gentlemanly as Josef Hofmann.   STILL ANOTHER HUNDRED WOMEN  I wonder if he's as fascinating as De Pachmann.   YET OTHER HUNDREDS  I wonder if he has dark eyes. You never can tell by those awful photographs in the newspapers.   HALF A DOZEN WOMEN  I wonder if he can really play the piano.   THE CRITIC AFORESAID  What a hell of a wait! These rotten piano-thumping immigrants deserve a hard call-down. But what's the use? The piano manufacturers bring them over here to wallop their pianos--and the piano manufacturers are not afraid to advertise. If you knock them too hard you have a nasty business-office row on your hands.   ONE OF THE MEN  If they allowed smoking, it wouldn't be so bad.   ANOTHER MAN  I wonder if that woman across the aisle----  (THE GREAT PIANIST _bounces upon the stage so suddenly that he is bowing in the center before any one thinks to applaud. He makes three stiff bows. At the second the applause begins, swelling at once to a roar. He steps up to the piano, bows three times more, and then sits down. He hunches his shoulders, reaches for the pedals with his feet, spreads out his hands and waits for the clapper-clawing to cease. He is an undersized, paunchy East German, with hair the color of wet hay, and an extremely pallid complexion. Talcum powder hides the fact that his nose is shiny and somewhat pink. His eyebrows are carefully penciled and there are artificial shadows under his eyes. His face is absolutely expressionless._)   THE VIRGIN  Oh!   THE MARRIED WOMEN  Oh!   THE OTHER WOMEN  Oh! How dreadfully handsome!   THE VIRGIN  Oh, such eyes, such depth! How he must have suffered! I'd like to hear him play the Prélude in D flat major. It would drive you crazy!   A HUNDRED OTHER WOMEN  I certainly _do_ hope he plays some Schumann.   OTHER WOMEN  What beautiful hands! I could kiss them!  (THE GREAT PIANIST, _throwing back his head, strikes the massive opening chords of a Beethoven sonata. There is a sudden hush and each note is heard clearly. The tempo of the first movement, which begins after a grand pause, is_ allegro con brio, _and the first subject is given out in a sparkling cascade of sound. But, despite the buoyancy of the music, there is an unmistakable undercurrent of melancholy in the playing. The audience doesn't fail to notice it._)   THE VIRGIN  Oh, perfect! I could love him! Paderewski played it like a fox trot. What poetry _he_ puts into it! I can see a soldier lover marching off to war.   ONE OF THE CRITICS  The ass is dragging it. Doesn't _con brio_ mean--well, what the devil _does_ it mean? I forget. I must look it up before I write the notice. Somehow, _brio_ suggests cheese. Anyhow, Pachmann plays it a damn sight faster. It's safe to say _that_, at all events.   THE MARRIED WOMAN  Oh, I could listen to that sonata all day! The poetry he puts into it--even into the _allegro_! Just think what the _andante_ will be! I like music to be sad.   ANOTHER WOMAN  What a sob he gets into it!   MANY OTHER WOMEN  How exquisite!   THE GREAT PIANIST  (_Gathering himself together for the difficult development section._) That American beer will be the death of me! I wonder what they put in it to give it its gassy taste. And the so-called German beer they sell over here--_du heiliger Herr Jesu!_ Even Bremen would be ashamed of it. In München the police would take a hand.  (_Aiming for the first and second C's above the staff, he accidentally strikes the C sharps instead and has to transpose three measures to get back into the key. The effect is harrowing, and he gives his audience a swift glance of apprehension._)   TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN  What new beauties he gets out of it!   A MAN  He can tickle the ivories, all right, all right!   A CRITIC  Well, at any rate, he doesn't try to imitate Paderewski.   THE GREAT PIANIST  (_Relieved by the non-appearance of the hisses he expected._) Well, it's lucky for me that I'm not in Leipzig to-day! But in Leipzig an artist runs no risks: the beer is pure. The authorities see to that. The worse enemy of technic is biliousness, and biliousness is sure to follow bad beer. (_He gets to the_ coda _at last and takes it at a somewhat livelier pace._)   THE VIRGIN  How I envy the woman he loves! How it would thrill me to feel his arms about me--to be drawn closer, closer, closer! I would give up the whole world! What are conventions, prejudices, legal forms, morality, after all? Vanities! Love is beyond and above them all--and art is love! I think I must be a pagan.   THE GREAT PIANIST  And the herring! Good God, what herring! These barbarous Americans----   THE VIRGIN  Really, I am quite indecent! I should blush, I suppose. But love is never ashamed--How people misunderstand me!   THE MARRIED WOMAN  I wonder if he's faithful. The chances are against it. I never heard of a man who was. (_An agreeable melancholy overcomes her and she gives herself up to the mood without thought._)   THE GREAT PIANIST  I wonder whatever became of that girl in Dresden. Every time I think of her, she suggests pleasant thoughts--good beer, a fine band, _Gemütlichkeit_. I must have been in love with her--not much, of course, but just enough to make things pleasant. And not a single letter from her! I suppose she thinks I'm starving to death over here--or tuning pianos. Well, when I get back with the money there'll be a shock for her. A shock--but not a _Pfennig_!   THE MARRIED WOMAN  (_Her emotional coma ended._) Still, you can hardly blame him. There must be a good deal of temptation for a great artist. All of these frumps here would----   THE VIRGIN  Ah, how dolorous, how exquisite is love! How small the world would seem if----   THE MARRIED WOMAN  Of course you could hardly call such old scarecrows temptations. But still----   (THE GREAT PIANIST _comes to the last measure of the_ coda--_a passage of almost Haydnesque clarity and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22145"],["title","A Book of Burlesques (#7)"],["body","t. As he strikes the broad chord of the tonic there comes a roar of applause. He arises, moves a step or two down the stage, and makes a series of low bows, his hands to his heart._)   THE GREAT PIANIST  (_Bowing._) I wonder why the American women always wear raincoats to piano recitals. Even when the sun is shining brightly, one sees hundreds of them. What a disagreeable smell they give to the hall. (_More applause and more bows._) An American audience always smells of rubber and lilies-of-the-valley. How different in London! There an audience always smells of soap. In Paris it reminds you of sachet bags--and _lingerie_.  (_The applause ceases and he returns to the piano._)  And now comes that _verfluchte adagio_.  (_As he begins to play, a deathlike silence falls upon the hall._)   ONE OF THE CRITICS  What rotten pedaling!   ANOTHER CRITIC  A touch like a xylophone player, but he knows how to use his feet. That suggests a good line for the notice--\"he plays better with his feet than with his hands,\" or something like that. I'll have to think it over and polish it up.   ONE OF THE OTHER MEN  Now comes some more of that awful classical stuff.   THE VIRGIN  Suppose he can't speak English? But that wouldn't matter. Nothing matters. Love is beyond and above----   SIX HUNDRED WOMEN  Oh, how beautiful!   THE MARRIED WOMAN  Perfect!   THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS  (_Sinking quickly into the slumber which always overtakes him during the_ adagio.) C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h!   THE YOUNGEST CRITIC  There is that old fraud asleep again. And to-morrow he'll print half a column of vapid reminiscence and call it criticism. It's a wonder his paper stands for him. Because he once heard Liszt, he....   THE GREAT PIANIST  That plump girl over there on the left is not so bad. As for the rest, I beg to be excused. The American women have no more shape than so many matches. They are too tall and too thin. I like a nice rubbery armful--like that Dresden girl. Or that harpist in Moscow--the girl with the Pilsner hair. Let me see, what was her name? Oh, Fritzi, to be sure--but her last name? Schmidt? Kraus? Meyer? I'll have to try to think of it, and send her a postcard.   THE MARRIED WOMAN  What delicious flutelike tones!   ONE OF THE WOMEN  If Beethoven could only be here to hear it! He would cry for very joy! Maybe he _does_ hear it. Who knows? I believe he does. I am _sure_ he does.  (THE GREAT PIANIST _reaches the end of the_ adagio, _and there is another burst of applause, which awakens_ THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS.)   THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS  Oh, piffle! Compared to Gottschalk, the man is an amateur. Let him go back to the conservatory for a couple of years.   ONE OF THE MEN  (_Looking at his program._) Next comes the _shirt-so_. I hope it has some tune in it.   THE VIRGIN  The _adagio_ is love's agony, but the _scherzo_ is love triumphant. What beautiful eyes he has! And how pale he is!   THE GREAT PIANIST  (_Resuming his grim toil._) Well, there's half of it over. But this _scherzo_ is ticklish business. That horrible evening in Prague--will I ever forget it? Those hisses--and the papers next day!   ONE OF THE MEN  Go it, professor! That's the best you've done yet!   ONE OF THE CRITICS  Too fast!   ANOTHER CRITIC  Too slow!   A YOUNG GIRL  My, but ain't the professor just full of talent!   THE GREAT PIANIST  Well, so far no accident. (_He negotiates a difficult passage, and plays it triumphantly, but at some expenditure of cold perspiration._) What a way for a man to make a living!   THE VIRGIN  What passion he puts into it! His soul is in his finger-tips.   A CRITIC  A human pianola!   THE GREAT PIANIST  This _scherzo_ always fetches the women. I can hear them draw long breaths. That plump girl is getting pale. Well, why shouldn't she? I suppose I'm about the best pianist she has ever heard--or ever _will_ hear. What people can see in that Hambourg fellow I never could imagine. In Chopin, Schumann, Grieg, you might fairly say he's pretty good. But it takes an _artist_ to play Beethoven. (_He rattles on to the end of the_ scherzo _and there is more applause. Then he dashes into the_ finale.)   THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS  Too loud! Too loud! It sounds like an ash-cart going down an alley. But what can you expect? Piano-playing is a lost art. Paderewski ruined it.   THE GREAT PIANIST  I ought to clear 200,000 marks by this tournee. If it weren't for those thieving agents and hotelkeepers, I'd make 300,000. Just think of it--twenty-four marks a day for a room! That's the way these Americans treat a visiting artist! The country is worse than Bulgaria. I was treated better at Bucharest. Well, it won't last forever. As soon as I get enough of their money they'll see me no more. Vienna is the place to settle down. A nice studio at fifty marks a month--and the life of a gentleman. What was the name of that little red-cheeked girl at the café in the Franzjosefstrasse--that girl with the gold tooth and the silk stockings? I'll have to look her up.   THE VIRGIN  What an artist! What a master! What a----   THE MARRIED WOMAN  Has he really suffered, or is it just intuition?   THE GREAT PIANIST  No, marriage is a waste of money. Let the other fellow marry her. (_He approaches the closing measures of the finale._) And now for a breathing spell and a swallow of beer. American beer! Bah! But it's better than nothing. The Americans drink water. Cattle! Animals! _Ach, München, wie bist du so schön!_  (_As he concludes there is a whirlwind of applause and he is forced to bow again and again. Finally, he is permitted to retire, and the audience prepares to spend the short intermission in whispering, grunting, wriggling, scraping its feet, rustling its programs and gaping at hats. The_ SIX MUSICAL CRITICS _and_ SIX OTHER MEN, _their lips parched and their eyes staring, gallop for the door. As_ THE GREAT PIANIST _comes from the stage_, THE JANITOR _meets him with a large seidel of beer. He seizes it eagerly and downs it at a gulp._)   THE JANITOR  My, but them professors can put the stuff away!     _VI.--SEEING THE WORLD_  _VI.--Seeing The World_   _The scene is the brow of the Hungerberg at Innsbruck. It is the half hour before sunset, and the whole lovely valley of the Inn_--still wie die Nacht, tief wie das Meer--_begins to glow with mauves and apple greens, apricots and silvery blues. Along the peaks of the great snowy mountains which shut it in, as if from the folly and misery of the world, there are touches of piercing primary colours--red, yellow, violet. Far below, hugging the winding river, lies little Innsbruck, with its checkerboard parks and Christmas garden villas. A battalion of Austrian soldiers, drilling in the Exerzierplatz, appears as an army of grey ants, now barely visible. Somewhere to the left, beyond the broad flank of the Hungerberg, the night train for Venice labours toward the town.  It is a superbly beautiful scene, perhaps the most beautiful in all Europe. It has colour, dignity, repose. The Alps here come down a bit and so increase their spell. They are not the harsh precipices of Switzerland, nor the too charming stage mountains of the Trentino, but rotting billows of clouds and snow, the high flung waves of some titanic but stricken ocean. Now and then comes a faint clank of metal from the funicular railway, but the tracks themselves are hidden among the trees of the lower slopes. The tinkle of an angelus bell (or maybe it is only a sheep bell) is heard from afar. A great bird, an eagle or a falcon, sweeps across the crystal spaces.  Here where we are is a shelf on the mountainside, and the hand of man has converted it into a terrace. To the rear, clinging to the mountain, is an Alpine_ gasthaus--_a bit overdone, perhaps, with its red-framed windows and elaborate fretwork, but still genuinely of the Alps. Along the front of the terrace, protecting sightseers from the sheer drop of a thousand feet, is a stout wooden rail.  A man in an American sack suit, with a bowler hat on his head, lounges against this rail. His elbows rest upon it, his legs are crossed in the fashion of a figure four, and his face is buried in the red book of Herr Baedeker. It is the volume on Southern Germany, and he is reading the list of Munich hotels. Now and then he stops to mark one with a pencil, which he wets at his lips each time. While he is thus engaged, another man comes ambling along the terrace, apparently from the direction of the funicular railway station. He, too, carries a red book. It is Baedeker on Austria-Hungary. After gaping around him a bit, this second man approaches the rail near the other and leans his elbows upon it. Presently he takes a package of chewing gum from his coat pocket, selects two pieces, puts them into his mouth and begins to chew. Then he spits idly into space, idly but homerically, a truly stupendous expectoration, a staggering discharge from the Alps to the first shelf of the Lombard plain! The first man, startled by the report, glances up. Their eyes meet and there is a vague glimmer of recognition._   THE FIRST MAN  American?   THE SECOND MAN  Yes; St. Louis.   THE FIRST MAN  Been over long?   THE SECOND MAN  A couple of months.   THE FIRST MAN  What ship'd you come over in?   THE SECOND MAN  The _Kronprinz Friedrich_.   THE FIRST MAN  Aha, the German line! I guess you found the grub all right.   THE SECOND MAN  Oh, in the main. I have eaten better, but then again, I have eaten worse.   THE FIRST MAN  Well, they charge you enough for it, whether you get it or not. A man could live at the Plaza cheaper.   THE SECOND MAN  I should _say_ he could. What boat did _you_ come over in?   THE FIRST MAN  The _Maurentic_.   THE SECOND MAN  How is she?   THE FIRST MAN  Oh, so-so.   THE SECOND MAN  I hear the meals on those English ships are nothing to what they used to be.   THE FIRST MAN  That's what everybody tells me. But, as for me, I can't say I found them so bad. I had to send back the potatoes twice and"]]]
