So Frank sang the song that has sounded beneath the elms at Yale so many times. It was a beautiful song, and it awakened in the memories of the listening lads thoughts of the gay times at college, the moonlight nights, the roistering lads, the lighted windows of the Quad and the groups gathered at the Fence.  Jack brushed his eyes.  \"Don't sing anything more like that,\" he urged. \"Make it something lively--'Solomon Levi,' or any old thing.\"  So \"Solomon Levi\" followed, and they all joined in on the chorus. Other lively songs were sung, and, by the time Frank put aside the guitar all were in fairly good spirits.  Merriwell arranged the program of standing watch. Hans was relieved before they turned in.  All through the night they took turns at standing watch and blowing away at intervals on the fog horn. And the night passed quickly enough without event.  When morning came, however, the fog still hung on the surface of the water. They ate a light breakfast, and Frank fell to walking the deck impatiently.  \"If there was a breeze, this fog would be liable to lift,\" he said. \"It is disgusting.\"  After a little a light breeze rose, but it did not clear away the fog entirely. However, the coming of the sun had some effect on it, and it was not long before Merry decided to get up anchor and run up the sails.  The anchor was hoisted and the sails set. Frank took the wheel.  During the night the old swell had run out. Frank had studied his chart till he believed he knew about where they lay, and he set his course by the compass.  Not ten minutes after getting under way they found they were headed straight for an island. In their vicinity the fog was not heavy, but out beyond the island lay a bank of it.  Immediately on sighting the island, Frank changed the course of the yacht, bringing her almost about. Then he ran out past the island, headed for the fog bank.  All at once there was a strange sound, a roaring swish of water. Not one of them was certain which direction the sound came from.  \"Vot dot vos?\" exclaimed Hans, in alarm.  \"Keep still!\" ordered Frank.  The sounds grew louder.  Then, all at once, Hans flung up his hands and shouted:  \"Reef your rudder, Vrankie! You vos running a sdeampoat ofer us!\"  Out of the fog bank, just ahead, came a large side-wheel steamer, headed straight toward them!  Frank sighted the steamer at the same moment Hans saw it, and he realized their peril. It was the Boston boat, _City of Bangor_, on its course up the bay.  In the twinkling of an eye, Merriwell threw the wheel over and over, the _White Wings_ swung to port, but headed straight across the course of the great steamer.  Hoo-oo-oot! hoo-oo-oot! hoo-oo-oot! sounded the hoarse warning whistle from the steamer.  \"If you had been whistling through that fog bank all would have been right,\" muttered Merriwell, through his set teeth. \"Now, if you run me down, you'll pay for this yacht!\"  There was a jangling sound of a bell on board the steamer, and the pilot in the pilot house was seen to send his wheel spinning over with frantic haste at the same moment that the headway of the steamer grew less.  \"Will she clear us?\" cried Hodge.  \"She is bound to cut us in two!\" shouted Diamond. \"There isn't breeze enough for us to get out of her way!\"  \"Vere vos der life breserfers?\" squawked Hans. \"I vant to got me onto a life-breserfer a hurry in!\"  The Dutch lad made a headlong leap for the companion way. At the head of the steps he stubbed his toe and down he went head first.  It happened that Bruce Browning had heard the commotion on deck, and, strange to relate, it had aroused him so that he was coming up.  Bruce had just started to go above when Hans came flying through the air like a huge toad, struck him full and fair, and both went down in a heap on the cabin floor.  \"Dot seddles id!\" yelled the frightened Dutch lad. \"Der yocht vos sunkin' und I vos a goner!\"  \"You blundering Dutch chump!\" gasped Bruce, when he could catch his breath. \"What is the matter?\"  \"Didn't you toldt me der yocht vos sunkin'?\" shrieked Hans. \"Id haf run ofer a pig sdeampoat! Uf you kept myseluf drownting from I vill haf to got oudt und valk ashore!\"  Browning managed to get himself together and rise to his feet. Then he hurried up the companion way and reached the deck just in time to see the huge white hull of a steamboat looming above the yacht.  But Merriwell's prompt action and steady nerve had saved the _White Wings_, for the steamer, with motionless paddlewheels, was slipping past, the yacht having cut square across her course.  It was a close shave, and a few white faces looked over the forward starboard rail of the huge steamer.  \"If you chaps knew your business you would be at anchor instead of cruising round in this fog,\" called a hoarse voice from the steamer.  \"If you knew your business you would blow your fog whistle while running through a fog bank,\" returned Frank Merriwell, promptly.  \"That's the stuff, Merry!\" grated Hodge, whose face was still pale. \"How do you suppose they happened to do such a thing?\"  \"Probably that bank of fog is narrow, and they only ran into it a few minutes ago. Perhaps they did not strike heavy fog till just before they broke through and came into view.\"  \"Well, it was a piece of reprehensible carelessness, and it's lucky the _White Wings_ was not cut in two.\"  As the huge steamer slipped past, the boys saw not many persons were astir on her. She had made an all-night run from Boston, and the passengers were still sleeping in their staterooms, with a few exceptions.  Near the stern of the steamer were two persons in mackintoshes. They seemed to regard the yacht with interest, not to say excitement, and their movements attracted the attention of the boys.  One of the passengers clutched the other by the arm and pointed out the _White Wings_, then both leaned over the rail.  Jack Diamond leaped to Merriwell's side, grasped Merry by the shoulder, and cried in his ear:  \"Look, Merriwell--look!\"  \"Where?\"  \"On the steamer there! The two fellows astern!\"  \"I see them.\"  \"Know them?\"  \"By Jove! I believe I do!\"  \"One of them is----\"  \"Wat Snell!\"  \"Sure! And the other is----\"  \"The chap who claimed this yacht--Parker Flynn!\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"Great Scott! What are they doing on that boat?\"  \"Following us!\"  \"Perhaps they are.\"  \"Perhaps! There is no perhaps about it! Of course they are!\"  \"But Snell and Flynn together--how does that happen?\"  \"I can't tell that, but they are together, and they are following us--that's sure. You are not done with Flynn, it seems.\"  \"He will get into trouble if he bothers me any more. I shall not stand any nonsense from him. As for Wat Snell, all I want is a good chance to square up with him. I will make him sorry he ever heard of me!\"  \"That's the talk, Frank!\" exclaimed Diamond, approvingly. \"Snell will be easier to dispose of than the other chap, for it is probable that Flynn believes he can take this boat away from you because he has a right to it, or he would not be following us.\"  \"He has no right to it, and he will not be able to take it.\"  \"See, Frank! What is the fellow going to---- Look out!\"  On the steamer Flynn had been seen to hastily unbutton his mackintosh, jerk something bright out of his hip pocket and point it toward the yacht.  It was a revolver.  Jack Diamond realized the desperate fellow's purpose, and he caught hold of Frank Merriwell and gave him a push that threw him to the deck beside the wheel.  There was a flash of fire from the revolver, a puff of smoke, and then a bullet whistled over the yacht, striking the water beyond.  \"Well, of all the foolhardy, cowardly tricks, I believe that takes the premium!\" said Frank, as he arose and grasped the wheel again. \"That man is drunk or crazy!\"  The moment Flynn fired, Snell took to his heels and scudded out of sight, disappearing on the other side of the steamer. Flynn hastily put up his revolver, shook his fist toward the yacht, and then followed Snell, both of them getting out of the way before anyone, attracted by the sound of the shot, came aft to investigate.  The big paddlewheels of the steamer were in motion again, and she was forging on her course, as if nothing had happened.  Frank brought the _White Wings_ round and set his course to follow as closely as the wind would allow. In a short time the steamer was almost out of sight in the thin mist that hung over the water where there was no fog.  Then, at last, Hans Dunnerwust came puffing and stumbling on deck, fairly loaded down with life-preservers. He fell at the head of the companion way, and the life-preservers flew all over the deck.  \"Put me onto them kvick!\" he squealed. \"Uf I don'd haf a life breserfer on ven der yocht sinks you vos a goner!\"  The boys laughed at his ludicrous appearance, and he sat up on the deck, staring around blankly.  \"Vere dot sdeampoat vos?\" he asked, in astonishment.  \"Why, the steamer is a mile away by this time,\" said Hodge.  \"If she had run into us, we'd been at the bottom long before this,\" laughed Frank. \"You are too slow, Hans.\"  \"Vale, I done your duty, anyhow,\" sturdily declared the Dutch boy. \"You don'd got me to makin' no mistake in dot.\"  Then he was set to gathering up the life preservers and carrying them below again.  The encounter with the steamer and the desperate action of Parker Flynn furnished food for conversation on board the yacht. The boys talked it over and over, and it was the general opinion that the presence of Flynn and Snell in company on the steamer was not an accident.  \"We'll see more of those fellows before long,\" prophesied Diamond. \"And it strikes me that Flynn is more dangerous than Snell, for he is a desperate fellow. If he had shot anybody on this boat there was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22265"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Cruise (#5)"],["body","way of making it seem an accident. When Snell pushed you in front of the car he could have sworn it was an accident if the car had killed you. Look out for Parker Flynn.\"  \"I will,\" said Merriwell.  It was nearly nine o'clock before they rounded Owl's Head and pointed into Rockland harbor. The mist still hung on the water, and the outlines of the city were hidden. Frank, however, felt confident that he was all right.  \"We'll take dinner ashore if you say so, fellows,\" he said.  \"Oh, I don't know,\" said Jack. \"I don't believe these natives down in this country know how to cook anything fit to eat.\"  Frank smiled.  \"I fancy you have a few notions that will be knocked out of your head after you have been down this way a short time. You still seem to fancy you are going into a howling wilderness where there are only savages and half-civilized white people.\"  \"Perhaps we are,\" said Jack, by way of being odd. \"You don't know yourself, for this is your first visit down here.\"  Out through the mist came a tiny steam launch. All at once it was headed straight toward the _White Wings_.  \"She acts as if she is coming for us,\" said Hodge, scowling.  As the launch came nearer five persons were seen in her. The interest of the boys increased rapidly, for everything seemed to indicate that she was making straight for the yacht.  All at once Diamond uttered a cry, turned to Frank and said:  \"I knew it! I told you we'd see more of him! See the fellow in the bow of that launch? It's Parker Flynn!\"     CHAPTER V.  A BOARDING PARTY.   \"Sure as shooting!\" nodded Frank. \"He is in a hurry to see me--that's plain.\"  \"Yes, he couldn't wait till we got into the harbor.\"  \"It's probable he thought we might not come into Rockland after seeing him on the steamer, and so, as soon as he could get ashore, he hired the launch to run out and head us off.\"  \"Snell is with him,\" said Hodge. \"Oh, I'd like to get a crack at that fellow!\"  \"You may have a chance,\" smiled Merriwell, coolly.  \"How?\"  \"I don't propose to let those chaps come aboard my yacht unless they show that they have a right to do so.\"  \"Good for you!\" cried Bart, his face growing stern. \"I am with you, Merry!\"  \"And I!\" exclaimed Diamond.  \"Vale, I don'd knew but I vos re'dy vor a liddle schraps,\" observed Hans.  \"Then we will stand by to repel boarders if they try the trick,\" said Frank. \"Call Browning on deck.\"  So the big Yale man was called, and he came up in his shirt sleeves. He was interested immediately the situation was explained to him, and he seemed well pleased when Frank expressed his intention of preventing the strangers from boarding without authority.  \"This promises to be a real warm morning,\" he said, with a lazy smile. \"I'm rather glad I'm here.\"  By this time the launch was close at hand.  \"Ahoy the yacht!\" called a voice.  \"Ay! ay!\" called back Merriwell, in true nautical style. \"On board the launch, what's wanted?\"  \"Lay to. We have business with you.\"  \"Keep off. We haven't time to bother with you.\"  \"Don't act foolish!\" was the angry exclamation. \"If you do, you will be sorry!\"  \"If you bother us without a legal right you will be sorry,\" flung back Frank. \"We are not to be trifled with this morning.\"  The launch made a circle and swung round so that she was heading in the same direction as the yacht.  \"If you don't lay to,\" said the spokesman on board the launch, \"we'll run alongside and board you.\"  \"Try it. You will find the warmest job you ever struck!\"  \"Why, you will not resist officers of the law?\"  \"Not if we know the officers have authority.\"  \"Well, we have the authority, so head up into the wind.\"  \"You say you have authority, but I do not even know you are an officer. In fact, judging by the company you are in, I should take you for anything else.\"  There were muttered words on the launch, savage, suppressed oaths and a stir that was significant.  \"They do mean to run alongside and board!\" exclaimed Diamond. \"Are you still in for keeping them off, Merry?\"  \"You bet!\" nodded Frank, grimly. \"If I decide otherwise, I will give you the word in time.\"  Bruce Browning began to roll up his sleeves, baring his brawny arms. There was a flush on his face and an eager look in his eyes.  \"Some of those gentlemen will take a bath this morning,\" he said.  Both Diamond and Hodge flung aside their coats.  The men on the launch saw these significant movements and could not misunderstand them. They were surprised by the attitude of the crew of the _White Wings_.  \"You fools!\" cried the spokesman of the party, who had a full black beard. \"You will get yourselves jailed if you make any resistance. I am Sheriff Ulmer, of Rockland!\"  \"Where is your badge?\" demanded Frank. \"Show that.\"  The man who claimed to be the sheriff hesitated.  \"He can't do it!\" muttered Hodge, triumphantly.  \"I have papers to serve on you,\" said the black-bearded man.  \"You can serve them when I come ashore,\" returned Frank. \"I am going into the harbor, and I shall be ashore in thirty minutes after dropping anchor.\"  \"But you are on a stolen yacht, and I am here to take possession of it.\"  \"I am not on a stolen yacht, and I do not mean that you shall take possession of it unless you have the right to do so. This yacht belongs to me. I bought it and paid for it with good money, and I mean to hold it. If you really are Sheriff Ulmer, which I am inclined to doubt, you have been deceived by that rascal in the bow of the launch. He holds a worthless bill of sale of this boat, which, if it is not a forgery, was made out by a crazy man who did not own the boat at the time.\"  \"It's a lie!\" snarled Flynn. \"The bill of sale is all right, and we're going to take that yacht!\"  \"You will have to fight for her, if you do!\"  \"If you fight, you fool, you will go to jail. There is a first-class jail in Rockland, too.\"  \"I'll take my chances of going to jail. Keep off! This is a fair warning.\"  By this time the launch was close to the yacht, and the faces of all the persons in the small boat could be seen and studied. Wat Snell was pale, and it was plain he did not relish his position. With the fellow who claimed to be sheriff was a hang-dog looking chap who looked like a fighter. The man who was running the launch acted as if he had no intention of taking any part in the fight, if one should occur. It was plain he had been hired to set the others on board the _White Wings_, and he did not mean to do anything more than that.  \"Hans!\" called Frank, \"take the wheel and hold her steady as she is. You will get out of the scrimmage, and I want to have a hand in that.\"  Hans took the wheel, and Frank prepared to take a hand in the repulse if the enemy tried to board.  The man in the launch who had claimed to be sheriff stood up and waved his clinched fist above his head.  \"In the name of the law, I command you to surrender!\" he shouted.  \"Show your authority,\" calmly returned Merriwell.  \"Here it is--the bill of sale of that yacht.\"  \"That is no authority. Do you think you can bluff us because we are young? You will find you have made a big mistake.\"  \"Board them!\" cried Flynn. \"Take the yacht! That is the only way to do it!\"  \"You will find that is a mighty hard way to do it!\" grated Bart Hodge. \"Come on, Snell! I want to get at you!\"  The launch ran alongside the yacht, and the man with the fellow who claimed to be the sheriff caught the rail of the _White Wings_ with a boat hook.  \"Come on!\" roared the black-whiskered chap.  \"Stand by to repel boarders!\" rang out Frank's clear voice.     CHAPTER VI.  THE STRUGGLE FOR THE YACHT.   The big man with the whiskers was the first to make an attempt to reach the deck of the yacht. He gave a leap that landed him on the rail. Then Bruce Browning picked him up and tossed him back into the launch.  The man was surprised, but he made another rush to get onto the _White Wings_.  In the meantime Parker Flynn had tried to get aboard, but had been struck on the jaw by Merriwell's hard fist and knocked back into the launch.  Snell started to climb over the rail of the yacht, but tumbled back of his own accord when Hodge made a rush for him.  The hang-dog-appearing chap was the spryest man on the launch. With a catlike leap, he cleared the rail of the _White Wings_ and reached the deck. He found himself face to face with Jack Diamond, and a second later they clinched.  \"You are not wanted here!\" exclaimed Jack.  \"But I'm going to stay here!\" said the other.  Diamond was strong and smart, but he found his hands full. Had he not taken the chap at a slight disadvantage in getting the first hold, the stranger would have been his master. As it was, they slipped and staggered about the deck, the stranger struggling to break Jack's hold.  In his excitement, Hans failed to hold the yacht steadily on her course, as Frank had directed, and suddenly she swung, so the main boom swept across the deck. It struck Diamond's antagonist on the back of the head and stunned him for a moment. That moment was long enough for Jack to lift him and drop him over into the launch.  Hans sent over the wheel and brought the yacht back, so the boom swung out of the way, but his negligence had aided Diamond to a large extent.  On falling back into the boat, Snell had scrambled up and stood snarling at Hodge, who was urging him to come within reach.  \"Oh, I do want to get my hands on you!\" said Bart. \"I'll give you something to remember me by, you sneaking cur!\"  \"You are a sneak yourself!\" cried Snell, \"or you would not be hanging around with Frank Merriwell after he licked you and got the best of you in everything you did!\"  \"It is a compliment to be called a sneak by you, you coward! Come up here! Let me give you a black eye!\"  But Snell kept just out of reach, although he made several bluff attempts to board the _White Wings_.  Probably the most astonished man was the big fellow with the black whiskers. He realized that Browning had handled him easily and carelessly, but still it did not seem possible"]]]
