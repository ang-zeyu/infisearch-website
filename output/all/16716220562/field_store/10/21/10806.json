When Tom came out on the street he almost ran into the arms of two burly men who had come out of the tenement. Both caught him by the arms.  \"What does this mean, young fellow?\" asked one, savagely. \"Doing the sneak-thief act?\"  \"I am after a thief,\" was the answer. \"Did you see a man running away?\"  \"No, and we don't think there was a man,\" answered one of the tenement dwellers.  \"Well, there was a man,\" said Tom. \"Come, if you will help me catch him I will reward you well.\"  \"What did he steal?\"  \"Some bonds worth ten thousand dollars--they belonged to my uncle,\" explained Tom, hastily.  The promise of a reward made the men attentive and they soon agreed to assist Tom as much as possible. Then Dick and Sam came in sight, and had to be told of what had happened.  The two men knew the tenement and factory district well, and they led in a hunt lasting over half an hour, and a policeman was likewise called into service.  \"I've heard of that bond case,\" said the policeman. \"I'd like to lay my hands on Merrick.\"  But the hunt was a useless one, for Merrick could not be found. For their trouble Tom gave the two men from the tenement a dollar each, with which they had to be satisfied. The policeman promised to report the matter at headquarters, and as there seemed to be nothing else to do, the three Rover boys walked down to the steamboat dock, first, however, sending a telegram to Randolph Rover, relating briefly what had occurred.  \"It's a great pity we didn't catch this Merrick,\" sighed Tom, when they were steaming along the lake shore. \"Perhaps we'll never see or hear of him again.\"  \"Well, we don't want Merrick as much as we want Uncle Randolph's traction company bonds,\" answered Dick. \"If he has disposed of the bonds it won't do much good to catch him,--unless, of course, he can get the bonds back.\"  \"And he may not have had the bonds,\" put in Sam. \"That fellow Pike may have handled them.\"  \"That is true, too,--although I somehow think Merrick is the prime mover in this swindle.\"  \"I think that, too,\" said Tom.  The _Golden Star_ was a trim little side-wheeler with a fair-sized deck fore and aft. The boys sat on the forward deck, and as the boat ran along the shore of the lake they pointed out many localities known to them.  \"There is where we went on the paper chase,\" said Sam.  \"Yes, and that is where we went on one of the encampments,\" added Tom.  \"We came fishing down here once,\" put in Dick. \"One of the boys went overboard.\"  \"It was John Fenwick, the fellow we used to call Mumps,\" said Tom. \"By the way, I wonder what has become of him?\"  \"Went west, I think,\" answered Sam. \"One of the boys said he was in the insurance business with some relative.\"  \"He was a great toady to Dan Baxter.\"  \"So he was, but he had some good points, too.\"  So the talk ran on, until Cedarville was reached. On account of the delay it was dark, and the boys wondered if they would find any conveyance to take them to the Hall.  \"Hullo, here is Peleg Snuggers with the carryall!\" cried Sam, as the general utility man of the school appeared. \"How are you, Peleg?\"  \"Fust rate,\" replied the man, grinning. \"Been waiting a long time for you.\"  \"Sorry, but we couldn't make the captain hurry the boat,\" answered Dick.  \"Peleg, you're a sight for tired optics,\" said Tom, giving the man's hand a squeeze that made him wince. \"How's your grandmother?\"  \"Why, Master Tom, I ain't----\"  \"And your great-granduncle? Is he over the shingles yet?\"  \"Why, Master Tom, I ain't got no----\"  \"And your second cousin by your first wife's sister? Did she get over the heart failure she had when the canary took a fit?\"  \"Now, see here, Master Tom, don't you go for to joking an old man----\"  \"Joking, Peleg?\" returned Tom, solemnly. \"Why, you know I never joke.\" And he took on an injured look.  \"Don't joke, eh? Well, if you ain't the greatest joker Putnam Hall ever see then I'll eat my hat,\" declared Peleg. \"Jump in an' don't ask me about no grandfathers, or wife's sisters, nor nuthing. Ain't you hungry?\"  \"Hungry? I could eat a brickbat fried in lemon oil.\"  \"Then, unless you hurry, you won't get no supper.\"  \"Oh, Mrs. Green will get something for us, never fear,\" said Dick, mentioning the matron of Putnam Hall, who was a warm-hearted and generous woman, even though a little bit \"peppery\" at times.  \"All the other boys here now?\" asked Dick, as they drove off in the direction of Putnam Hall.  \"I reckon the most of 'em are, Master Dick. So many coming an' going I can hardly keep track of 'em.\"  \"Fred Garrison, Songbird Powell and Hans Mueller back?\" asked Sam.  \"Yes, an' they told me some wonderful stories of your doings down south.\"  \"Are Larry Colby and George Granbury here?\" questioned Dick.  \"Yes.\"  \"I'll be glad to meet Larry and George again,\" went on Dick. \"I suppose they'll have something to tell of what they did during vacation.\"  \"Every time I come to the Hall I think of the first time I came,\" said Tom. \"Do you remember how I set off that giant firecracker?\"  \"Yes, and how old Josiah Crabtree put you under arrest for it,\" added Sam. \"Wonder where old Crabtree is now?\"  \"He is out of prison,\" answered Peleg Snuggers. \"I got that from a man in Cedarville. The man said as how Crabtree went to Canada.\"  \"Hope he stays there and never attempts to bother Mrs. Stanhope again,\" was Dick's comment.  About half the distance to the Hall had been covered when there came a shout on the road and Peleg Snuggers had to rein in his team. Then several boys appeared, dressed in cadet uniforms, for Putnam Hall was a military academy.  \"Whoop! here they are, fellows! Hurrah for the Rovers!\"  \"Rovers by name and rovers by nature!\"  \"Say, Tom, how do you like being adrift on the Gulf of Mexico?\"  \"Sam, don't you want to become a regular cowboy?\"  \"Dick, when I buy a houseboat I'm going to engage you as captain.\"  And then the students in the road clambered into the carryall and tumbled all over the Rovers, hugging them and trying to shake hands at the same time.  \"Larry, glad to see you, but please don't smother me.\"  \"I'll love you, George, if only you won't put your elbow through my ribs.\"  \"I knew Fred would meet us.\"  \"You gif me der honor of dis,\" came from Hans Mueller. \"I tole dem fellers to come along alretty.\"  \"Good for you, Hansy, old boy!\" cried Sam, and gave the German cadet a tight squeeze.  \"Songbird, why don't you turn on the poetry pipe line and let her flow?\" queried Larry Colby, who, even though an officer of one of the companies, was as jolly as the rest of the students.  \"Yes, give us something by all means,\" said Tom. \"Something about 'stilly night,' 'fond recollections,' 'starved cats,' and the like.\"  \"Humph! 'stilly night' and 'starved cats'!\" snorted Songbird Powell. \"You must think I'm running a hash mill instead of----\"  \"By no means, Songbird, dear!\" piped Tom. \"We all know you're the sole owner of the largest poem factory in New York state. Let her flow by all means.\"  \"If you don't recite, we'll sing,\" said Dick.  \"No, don't do that--yet,\" pleaded Songbird. \"I've got a verse or two all ready,\" and he began, in slow, measured tones:      \"Back to dear old Putnam Hall!         Back to the days of yore!     Back to the good old times we had!         May we have many more!     Back to our lessons and our books,         And to the teachers, too,     Back to the drills and hours off----\"      \"And to the mutton stew!\"  finished Tom. \"Don't forget to put in Mrs. Green's wonderful mutton stews.\"  \"No mutton stews in this!\" snorted Songbird. \"The last line was, 'When days were bright and blue,'\" and then he continued:      \"We love to gather here again,         And talk of times to come,     And plot and plan, and plan and plot----         And plan and plot----and plot and plot----     And plan----and plan----and plan----\"  \"Songbird, you've plotted and planned too much,\" interrupted Dick, as the would-be poet hesitated. \"Let's sing a song.\"  \"That's the talk!\" cried Fred Garrison, and started up the song well known to all of them:      \"Putnam Hall's the place for me!         Tra la lee! Tra la lee!     Putnam Hall's the place for me!         The best old school I know!\"  And then, as the carryall swung up to the campus, they set up the school yell, which brought out a score of students to witness the arrival of the Rover boys.     CHAPTER XI  WILLIAM PHILANDER TUBBS   As my old readers know, Putnam Hall was a handsome structure of brick and stone standing in the center of a large plot of ground, bounded on two sides by cedar woods. To the front was the campus and the wagon road and beyond this a slope leading to the lake. To the rear were rich farm lands, cultivated solely for the benefit of the institution. Besides the school, there were a building fitted up as a gymnasium, and also several barns and carriage houses. The Hall was built in the form of the letter E, and was three stories high. It contained numerous classrooms, a private office, a large mess hall, or dining room, and both large and small dormitories.  The master of the school was Captain Victor Putnam, who was a bachelor, and as kind as he was strict. Captain Putnam was a West Point graduate, and had modeled his school somewhat after that famous government institution. When the school was first organized the Rover boys did not go there, but a number of other bright and lively lads did, and what these cadets accomplished has already been related in a line of stories called \"The Putnam Hall Series,\" starting with \"The Putnam Hall Cadets.\" These lads had some awful quarrels with the head assistant, Josiah Crabtree, and they were glad when the Rovers appeared and made it so hot for Crabtree that he had to leave. George Strong was now first assistant in place of Crabtree, and the cadets found him a teacher after their own heart.  \"Hurrah! here are the Rovers!\" was the cry from the campus. \"Welcome back!\"  \"Boys, I am glad to see you again,\" came from"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22164"],["title","A Modern Tomboy: A Story for Girls (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net          A Modern Tomboy  _A Story for Girls_  By MRS.

BURT COMPANY, PUBLISHERS NEW YORK     A MODERN TOMBOY.     CHAPTER I.  OPENING THE SCHOOL.   Mrs. Merriman and Lucy were standing at the white gates of Sunnyside, waiting for the arrival of the girls. Mrs. Merriman had soft brown hair, soft brown eyes to match, and a kindly, gentle face. Lucy was somewhat prim, very neat in her person, with thick fair hair which she wore in two long plaits far below her waist, a face full of intensity and determination, and a slightly set and formal way of speaking.  \"Aren't you at all excited about their arrival?\" said Mrs. Merriman, turning to her daughter as she spoke. \"It will make a great change in the house, will it not?\"  \"How many of them are there, mother?\" was Lucy's response.  \"Oh, my dear child, how often I have explained all to you! There's Laura Everett, my dear friend Lady Everett's only daughter; then there is Annie Millar, whom I do not know anything about--but she is a friend of Laura's, and that alone is recommendation enough.\"  \"Laura Everett, Annie Millar,\" quoted Lucy in a low tone. \"Have you seen either of them, mother?\"  \"No, dear, of course not.\"  \"Has father ever seen them?\"  \"No. But my dear friend Lady Everett----\"  \"Oh, mother darling, when have you seen your dear friend?\"  \"Not since we were girls. But it is so nice to think she should trust her daughter to me.\"  \"Well, yes, mother, I suppose so. I suppose I must be quite satisfied. Well, that means two--Laura and Annie. How old are they, mother?\"  \"They are both fourteen.\"  \"Then the others, mother?\"  \"Rosamund Cunliffe. I did meet her mother a year ago, who told me she was very pretty. I remember that. Then there is Phyllis Flower. Think of any one with such a dear name--Phyllis and Flower! The whole name is too sweet! I told your father that I knew I should fall in love with Phyllis.\"  \"Mother dear, you really mustn't make favorites,\" said Lucy in a reproving tone. \"If these girls must come to us and form the beginning of a school, why, we must behave accordingly. You are not half as steady as I am, mother, and I am fifteen, and you are----\"  \"Forty-five,\" said Mrs. Merriman; \"but then I only feel twenty, and I am very happy about all this. The house is perfectly arranged, everything in apple-pie order, and they will have such a good time, dear girls! Well, now, let us count them over. Laura Everett, fourteen; Annie Millar, ditto; Rosamund Cunliffe, fifteen; and Phyllis Flower, thirteen. Then there is Jane Denton. Well, I know nothing whatever about her except that her mother says she is a good girl, and does her utmost to learn, and she is sure will be absolutely obedient. Then comes Agnes Sparkes. I quite expect she will be the witty one. Altogether that makes six girls, and you, my dear, are the seventh--the perfect number, you know.\"  \"And the whole house turned topsy-turvy!\" said Lucy. \"Really and truly, mother, I wish we had thought it over before we did anything so queer.\"  \"We could not help it, love. Your father's health is very bad, and he cannot continue his work as a professor. There is no other manner in which to earn money. Why not take the whole thing cheerfully, Lucy? Remember, you will have your education practically free.\"  \"I don't suppose I'd mind the girls so very much,\" said Lucy, \"if it were not for the horrid governesses. To think of having a creature like Mademoiselle Omont living in the house! And then, I am not specially in love with Miss Archer. But there, I suppose we must make the best of it.\"  \"We must, and will, and can,\" said Mrs. Merriman in her cheery voice.  She had scarcely said the words before a wagonette was seen driving down the summer lane. Girls in different-colored dresses, with bright faces, eager eyes, suddenly appeared in view. The wagonette drew up at the gate, and Mrs. Merriman, to Lucy's disgust, went impulsively forward.  \"Here you all are, dears!\" she said. \"Oh, I am so glad to welcome you! Now, you must tell me who's who. Won't you get down? It will be nice to stretch your legs in walking up the avenue. Your luggage, of course, is coming in the cart which was sent to meet the train.--Tell me, my love, are you Laura Everett?\"  Mrs. Merriman darted forward and took the somewhat irresponsive hand of a tall, pale girl, who replied languidly that her name was Jane Denton.  \"I beg your pardon, dear--I do truly. Then which is Laura? For I want to welcome the dear child of a very dear friend of my youth.\"  A girl with a merry face, bright blue eyes, and fair hair now extricated herself from the group of her companions. \"I am Laura,\" she said, \"and this is my friend Annie.\"  Mrs. Merriman rapturously kissed both girls.  \"Welcome to Sunnyside!\" she said. \"You may be certain I will do my utmost to make you happy. This is my daughter Lucy.\"  \"Can I show you the house, Miss Everett?\" said Lucy, speaking stiffly; \"and will you come, too, Miss Millar?\"  The three girls went on in front.  \"I must get to know the rest of you,\" said Mrs. Merriman, who was too much accustomed to Lucy to mind her ways. \"Which is--now let me guess--which is Phyllis Flower? I am longing to know her. And which is Rosamund Cunliffe?--Jane Denton, I shall not forget you, dear. I am so glad to see you.\"  Here Mrs. Merriman gave Jane's hand an affectionate squeeze.  \"And Agnes Sparkes--I have not noticed Agnes Sparkes. I am sure you--whoever you are, but I can't quite make out yet--will be the wit of the school. Ah! you are Agnes Sparkes?\" and Mrs. Merriman pounced upon a small, very thin, dark girl, with no beauty whatever about her.  A peal of laughter greeted her ears. \"Indeed, I am Phyllis Flower,\" said the young lady in question; and Mrs. Merriman started back with a look of disappointment. \"You thought because I had rather a pretty name that I'd look it,\" continued the girl. \"But I do not--I am neither witty nor beautiful, and I know I am not clever. I have got just nothing but my name. I'd rather like to live up to it; but somehow I don't think I can. Perhaps I may at Sunnyside. It seems such a novel idea to come to a sort of home school like this, and not to be treated a bit formally. Thank you so much, Mrs. Merriman!\" and Phyllis held out a small, neatly gloved hand and clasped Mrs. Merriman's, looking at her all the time with delight beaming in her eyes.  The other girls followed suit. They managed to introduce themselves one by one, and presently Mrs. Merriman was seen trotting contentedly down the avenue, followed by her new pupils. She looked something like a well-groomed pony herself, and the girls were much amused at her way of greeting them, and so thoroughly pleased that peals of laughter reached the displeased ears of Lucy, who was waiting with Annie and Laura in the porch.  \"Really,\" thought Lucy, \"poor mother gets worse and worse. What sort of school will this be? Not the slightest vestige of order, and all these girls being spoken to at the gate. Mother has no dignity. It is really terrible. I shall be glad when Miss Archer and Mademoiselle Omont come. How are we to spend the present evening?\"  The girls themselves seemed to arrange that matter. Having lost all shyness with regard to Mrs. Merriman, they were not likely to feel it towards Lucy. They accordingly requested to be taken into the house, and were much pleased with the arrangements made for their comfort. The old house of Sunnyside was one of the prettiest in the southwest of England. It had spacious grounds, beautiful gardens, and the rooms themselves, although somewhat low, were large and numerous. One or two girls had a room each, and the others were arranged two in a room, with a curtain between.  When Mrs. Merriman started the idea of a small school for the special education of special girls, she had spared no expense to have everything done in as thoroughly nice a manner as possible; and the girls themselves were delighted, and showed their appreciation by behaving in a hoydenish and school-girl fashion. They laughed and joked with each other, declaring that Mrs. Merriman was quite too funny for anything, but that she was also an old dear; that Lucy was rather a nuisance, and very prim, but that she shouldn't stand much in their way. And then they paced about in the garden arm-in-arm, and talked to one another, just, as Lucy said afterwards, as though they had lived there all their lives.  Poor Lucy in every respect was her mother's opposite. Neither did she specially take after her gentle, patient father, who was always satisfied to make the best of things, his motto being peace on any terms, and who was surprised now when Lucy ran up to him as he was pacing up and down in the walnut walk at some distance from the house.  \"Ah, my little girl!\" he said when he saw her approaching. \"Why, what is the matter? How flushed your cheeks are!\"  \"And no wonder, father,\" answered Lucy. \"If you could flush up at anything you'd feel hot and indignant now. Oh, father dear, I wish--I wish we weren't obliged to have those detestable girls!\"  \"What, Lucy! Have they come?\"  \"I should think they have. They'll waylay you in a minute or two.\"  \"Oh, no, my dear. I don't specially want to see them now.\"  \"Then let us go straight by this gate into the paddock. I don't suppose they will find the paddock before to-morrow. Father, I don't think mother is at all suited to keep a school.\"  \"Lucy, I will not have your dear mother abused. Talk on any other subject, but I can't stand that.\"  \"I suppose it is very wrong of me.\"  \"It is more than wrong. You can scarcely realize what a good, brave, and noble woman she is. Who but she would have acted as she has done lately? She has taken the bull by the horns and saved us from absolute ruin. By her plucky ways and determination has "]]]
