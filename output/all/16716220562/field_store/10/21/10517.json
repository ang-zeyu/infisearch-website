(p. xii) He explained his action in this respect to the President of Congress in the following letter:       To His Excellency                       Paris, March 18, 1785.         THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS.       Sir: Before I left America, I made application to the      Superintendent of Finances for the sword which Congress had been      pleased to order, by their resolution of the 17th of November,      1781, to be presented to me, in consequence of which Mr. Morris      informed me verbally that he would take the necessary      arrangements for procuring all the honourary presents which had      been directed to be given to different officers during the late      war, and requested that I would undertake to have them executed      in Europe. Some time after my arrival here, I received the      inclosed letter[1] from him, accompanied with a list of medals,      etc., and a description of those intended for General Morgan and      Colonels Washington and Howard.       Upon the receipt of these documents I did not delay to make the      proper inquiries from the characters who were the best skilled in      subjects of this nature, and after having spoken to some of the      first artists, I was advised to apply to the Abbé Barthélémy,      member of the academies of London, Madrid, Cortona, and      Hesse-Cassel, and actual keeper of the King's Cabinet of Medals      and Antiquities, at whose instance I wrote a letter to the Royal      Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, of which a copy is      inclosed. Being informed at the same time that the description of      medals for General Morgan, etc., was not in the style and manner      such medals were usually executed, I took the liberty of      suspending the execution of them, until I could learn whether it      is the pleasure of Congress to have them performed _exactly_ in      the manner prescribed--which shall be done accordingly, in case I      should not be honoured with further instructions on the subject      before their approaching recess.       The medals voted for the capture of Stony Point have been, or I      believe may be, all struck from the die originally engraved to      furnish one of them for Colonel de Fleury.       As to the swords in question, it is proposed to have them all      constructed in precisely the same fashion, the hilt to be of      silver, round which a foliage of laurel to be enameled in    (p. xiii)      gold in such a manner as to leave a medallion in the centre      sufficient to receive the arms of the United States on one side,      and on the reverse an inscription in English, \"The United States      to Colonel Meigs, July 25, 1777,\" and the same for the others.      The whole ten, executed in this manner, may probably cost about      three hundred louis d'or, which is (as I have been informed) but      little more than was paid for the sword which some time since was      presented on the part of the United States to the Marquis de la      Fayette.       I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect,                                              D. HUMPHREYS.       P.S. I forgot to mention that, in order to have the medals for      General Morgan, etc., executed in the manner originally proposed,      it will be necessary for me to have more particular information      of the numbers on both sides, of the killed, wounded, prisoners,      trophies, etc., which the enemy lost in the action of the      Cowpens.                     [Footnote 1: I have not been able to find this                    letter.]  The following is the letter to the Royal Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, referred to by Colonel Humphreys in the above:                                               Paris, March 14, 1785.      Mr. DACIER,          Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions                and Belles-Lettres, Rue Chabanais, Paris.       Sir: Having it in charge to procure the honourary presents which      (during the late war) have been voted by Congress to several      meritorious officers in their service, particularly three medals      in gold, one for General Washington, another for General Gates,      and a third for General Greene; and, being extremely desirous      that these medals should be executed in a manner grateful to the      illustrious personages for whom they are designed, worthy the      dignity of the sovereign power by whom they are presented, and      calculated to perpetuate the remembrance of those great events      which they are intended to consecrate to immortality, I therefore      take the liberty to address, through you, Sir, the Academy of      Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, on the subject, and entreat that      this learned body will be pleased to honour me, as soon as    (p. xiv)      may be convenient, with their advice and sentiments respecting      the devices and inscriptions proper for the before mentioned      medals. A memoir,[2] which has been left in the hands of M.      Barthélémy, one of their members, will give the necessary      information.       In addressing so respectable an assembly of _literati_ I do not      think myself permitted to enlarge on the importance of this      subject, because they must know, much better than I can inform      them, in how great a degree such monuments of public gratitude      are calculated to produce a laudable emulation, a genuine love of      liberty, and all the virtues of real patriotism, not only among      the innumerable generations who are yet to people the wastes of      America, but on the human character in general. Nor do I make      those apologies for the trouble I am now giving, which would be      requisite, did I not feel a conviction that whatever is      interesting to the national glory of America, to the good of      posterity, or to the happiness of the human race, cannot be      indifferent to a society composed of the most enlightened and      liberal characters in Europe, fostered by the royal protection of      a monarch whose name will forever be as dear to the United States      as it will be glorious in the annals of mankind.       Being so unfortunate as not to be able to write myself in French,      my intimate friend and brave companion in arms, M. le marquis de      la Fayette, has had the goodness to make a translation of this      letter into that language, which I inclose herewith.       I have the honour to be, with the most perfect respect, Sir, your      most obedient and most humble servant,                                              D. HUMPHREYS.                     [Footnote 2: I have not been able to find any trace                    of this memoir in the archives of the French                    Academy.]  A letter written by Franklin, about the same time, to John Jay, then Secretary for Foreign Affairs, is of much interest in this connection:       To the Honourable         John JAY,                            Passy, May 10, 1785.              Secretary for Foreign Affairs.         -       -       -       -       -       P.S. The striking of the medals being now in agitation here, I      send the inclosed for consideration.       _A thought concerning the Medals that are to be struck by      (p. xv)      order of Congress._       The forming of dies in steel to strike medals or money, is      generally with the intention of making a great number of the same      form.       The engraving those dies in steel is, from the hardness of the      substance, very difficult and expensive, but, once engraved, the      great number to be easily produced afterward by stamping      justifies the expense, it being but small when divided among a      number.       Where only one medal of a kind is wanted, it seems an unthrifty      way to form dies for it in steel to strike the two sides of it,      the whole expense of the dies resting on that medal.       It was by this means that the medal voted by Congress for M. de      Fleury cost one hundred guineas, when an engraving of the same      figures and inscriptions might have been beautifully done on a      plate of silver of the same size for two guineas.       The ancients, when they ordained a medal to record the memory of      any laudable action, and do honour to the performer of that      action, struck a vast number and used them as money. By this      means the honour was extended through their own and neighbouring      nations, every man who received or paid a piece of such money was      reminded of the virtuous action, the person who performed it, and      the reward attending it, and the number gave such security to      this kind of monuments against perishing and being forgotten,      that some of each of them exist to this day, though more than two      thousand years old, and, being now copied in books by the arts of      engraving and painting, are not only exceedingly multiplied but      likely to remain some thousands of years longer.       The man who is honoured only by a single medal is obliged to show      it to enjoy the honour, which can be done only to a few and often      awkwardly. I therefore wish the medals of Congress were ordered      to be money, and so continued as to be convenient money, by being      in value aliquot parts of a dollar.       Copper coins are wanting in America for small change. We have      none but those of the King of England. After one silver or gold      medal is struck from the dies, for the person to be honoured,      they may be usefully employed in striking copper money, or in      some cases small silver.       The nominal value of the pieces might be a little more than the      real, to prevent their being melted down, but not so much more as      to be an encouragement of counterfeiting.     I am, etc.,                                              B. FRANKLIN.

Narcisse Dupré, son of Augustin Dupré, I am enabled to give the contract between his father and Colonel Humphreys for the engraving of the medal for General Greene:[5]                     [Footnote 5: For the French original see C, page                    xli.]       I, the undersigned, Augustin Dupré, engraver of medals and      medallist of the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, bind      myself to Colonel Humphreys to engrave the medal representing the      portrait of General Greene. On the reverse, Victory treading      under her feet broken arms, with the legend and the exergue, and      I hold myself responsible for any breakage of the dies up to      twenty-four medals, and bind myself to furnish one at my own      expense (the diameter of the medal to be twenty-four _lignes_).       All on the following conditions: That for the two engraved dies      of the said medal shall be paid me the sum of two thousand four      hundred _livres_, on delivery of the two dies after the      twenty-four medals which the Colonel desires have been struck.       Done in duplicate between us, in Paris, this nineteenth of      November, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-five (1785).                                               D. HUMPHREYS.                                              DUPRÉ.  On November 25th of the same year, M. Dacier, the perpetual secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, communicated another letter from Colonel Humphreys, in which he requested the Academy to compose designs for three more medals, which had been voted to General Morgan and to Lieutenant-Colonels Washington and Howard.  (p. xvii) Commissioners were appointed and designs made for these also.[6]                     [Footnote 6: See B, page xxxvi.]  Colonel Humphreys having returned to America before the medals were finished, their superintendence was undertaken by Mr. Jefferson, as will be seen from the following letter:       To the Honourable         John JAY,                            Paris, February 14, 1787.              Secretary for Foreign Affairs.       Sir: Mr. Morris, during his office, being authorized to have the      medals and swords executed, which had been ordered by Congress,      he authorized Colonel Humphreys to take measures here for the      execution. Colonel Humphreys did so, and the swords were finished      in time for him to carry them. The medals not being finished, he      desired me to attend to them. The workman who was to make that of      General Greene brought me yesterday the medal in gold,      twenty-three in copper, and the die. Mr. Short, during my      absence, will avail himself of the first occasion which shall      offer of forwarding the medals to you. I must beg leave, through      you, to ask the pleasure of Congress as to the number they would      choose to have struck. Perhaps they might be willing to deposit      one of each person in every college of the United States. Perhaps      they might choose to give a series of them to each of the crowned      heads of Europe, which would be an acceptable present to them.      They will be pleased to decide. In the meantime I have sealed up      the die, and shall retain it till I am honoured with their orders      as to this medal, and the others also, when they shall be      finished.                 With great respect and esteem,                                              Th: JEFFERSON.  In another letter to Mr. Jay, dated Marseilles, May 4, 1787, Mr. Jefferson again refers to this subject:         -       -       -       -       -       I am in hopes Mr. Short will be able to send you the medals of      General Gates by this packet. I await a general instruction as to      these medals. The academies of Europe will be much pleased to      receive a set.          -       -       -       -       -  Mr. Jefferson's communication of the 14th of February was        (p. xviii) brought to the notice of Congress by Mr. Jay, and was referred back to him by Congress. The result was the following report:                                               OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,                                                     July 11, 1787.       The Secretary of the United States for the Department of Foreign      Affairs, to whom was referred a letter from the Honourable Mr.      Jefferson of the 14th of February last,       _Reports_, Your secretary presumes that the following paragraphs      in this letter occasion its being referred to him, viz.: \"The      workman who was to make a medal of General Greene brought me      yesterday the medal in gold, twenty-three in copper, and the die.      I must beg leave, through you, to ask the pleasure of Congress as      to the number they would choose to have struck. Perhaps they      might be willing to deposit one of each person in every college      of the United States. Perhaps they might choose to give a series      of them to each of the crowned heads of Europe, which would be an      acceptable present to them. They will be pleased to decide. In      the meantime I have sealed up the die, and shall retain it till I      am honoured with their orders as to this medal, and the others      also, when they shall be finished.\"       As these medals were directed to be struck in order to signalize      and commemorate certain interesting events and conspicuous      characters, the distribution of them should in his opinion be      such as may best conduce to that end. He therefore thinks that      both of Mr. Jefferson's hints should be improved, to wit, that a      series of these medals should be presented to each of the crowned      heads in Europe, and that one of each set be deposited in each of      the American colleges. He presumes that Mr. Jefferson does not      mean that any should be presented to the King of Great Britain,      for it would not be delicate; nor that by crowned heads he meant      to exclude free states from the compliment, for to make      discriminations would give offense.       In the judgment of your secretary it would be proper to instruct      Mr. Jefferson to present in the name of the United States one      silver medal of each denomination to every monarch (except His      Britannic Majesty), and to every sovereign and independent state      without exception in Europe; and also to the Emperor of Morocco.      That he also be instructed to send fifteen silver medals of each      set to Congress, to be by them presented to the thirteen      (p. xix)      United States respectively, and also to the Emperor of China with      an explanation and a letter, and one to General Washington.      That he also be instructed to present a copper medal of each      denomination to each of the most distinguished universities      (except the British) in Europe, and also to Count de Rochambeau,      to Count d'Estaing, and to Count de Grasse; and, lastly, that he      be instructed to send to Congress two hundred copper ones of each      set, together with the dies.       Your secretary thinks that of these it would be proper to present      one to each of the American colleges, one to the Marquis de la      Fayette, and one to each of the other major-generals who served      in the late American army; and that the residue with the dies be      deposited in the Secretary's Office of the United States, subject      to such future orders as Congress may think proper to make      respecting them.       It might be more magnificent to give gold medals to sovereigns,      silver ones to distinguished persons, and copper ones to the      colleges; but, in his opinion, the nature of the American      Governments, as well as the state of their finance, will      apologize for their declining the expense.       All which is submitted to the wisdom of Congress.                                               John JAY.  The records of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres show that in 1789, at the request of Mr. Jefferson, it also composed designs for the medals awarded by Congress to General Wayne, Major Stewart, and Captain John Paul Jones.[7] Mr. Jefferson had previously had an interview with M. Augustin Dupré on the subject, as will be seen by the following note, the original of which is in Mr. Jefferson's handwriting:[8]                     [Footnote 7: See D, page xli.]                     [Footnote 8: For the French originals of this and                    the following letter, see E, page xliv.]      To       M. DUPRÉ,          Engraver of Medals and Medallist of the              Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.       Mr. Jefferson having received orders concerning medals to be      struck would like to talk about them with M. Dupré, if he will      please do him the honour to call on him to-morrow morning before      eleven o'clock.       Saturday, January 3, 1789.  In the following month, Mr. Jefferson again wrote to M. Dupré,      (p. xx) inclosing descriptions of the designs for the medals of General Morgan and of Admiral Jones. The reader will note some slight differences between these and those originally composed by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres:      To       M. DUPRÉ,          Engraver of Medals and Medallist of the              Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture.       Mr. Jefferson has the honour to send to M. Dupré the devices for      the medals for General Morgan"]]]
