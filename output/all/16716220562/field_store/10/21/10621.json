Now what are some of these effects?  In the first place, every sin weakens the soul.  It takes from it not only its innocence, but its power of resistance.  Just as a wound weakens you by the loss of blood, so a sin weakens you by loss of resisting power.  You are not so strong to fight against evil after sinning as you were before.  In the second place, you have become more careless and even hardened about sin than you were before.  When you have a new coat or gown, you are very careful of it that it be not spotted and torn, but once it loses its first newness, you are not so particular, and the more spotted and torn it becomes, the less you care for the injuries done it, you say, \"It is an old dress and very much used, another stain or patch does not matter.\"  So with the soul, when you have become accustomed to sinning, you no longer dread sin.  CONCLUSION.--And now remember, in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace, and dread sin for its consequences, lest by over much confidence you may exceed your measure, and then the chance of recovery will be gone from you for ever.     XLVIII.  _SELF-INSPECTION._  11th Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke xviii., 13.  \"The Publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner.\"   INTRODUCTION.--I have spoken to you on former occasions pretty strongly upon the evil of backbiting, slandering, and casting of blame without sufficient cause.  I am not going to address this day those who speak evil, but those of whom evil is spoken.  The Publican in the Parable stood far from the Pharisee, who had no good word for him, even in his prayer, and he took a great deal of blame to heart, and prayed to God for mercy on him for his shortcomings.  No doubt the Publican was well aware in what estimation he was held by the people, and how utterly he was despised by the Pharisee.  The Publican was the tax-gatherer, and as the tax-gatherers in those days were often hard men, and exacted more than was due to the State, that they might pocket the difference, the general opinion was that they were all of them dishonest men, and men without hearts.  This was not true, we know, of this Publican, nor of Zacchaeus, nor of Levi, who are commended in the Gospel.  Perhaps this Publican who was praying, saw the Pharisee cast a contemptuous glance at him, perhaps he even heard the words of his prayer, but if so, he made no attempt at justifying himself.  His prayer was not, \"God, I am not what other men say of me, unjust, hard-hearted, peculating, exacting: on the contrary, I am strictly honest in my dealings, and I am very forbearing and tender-hearted, and I do not press for payment when no money is to be got.\"  No! nothing of the sort! all he says is--\"God, be merciful to me, a sinner.\"  SUBJECT.--I would have those who are blamed by others, instead of manifesting great eagerness to excuse themselves, and clamouring against those who speak against them, look into their own hearts and lives, and see if there be not something blameworthy there.  I.  King Philip of Macedon was informed by some of his courtiers that one of his officers, Nicanor by name, was always speaking evil of him, that wherever Nicanor was, there he did nothing but grumble against the king, and disparage and blame him.  What was to be done?  Should he be arrested and thrown into prison.  \"No!\" said King Philip, \"Before punishing Nicanor, I must look and see whether I have not given occasion for this abuse of me.\"  Then the king thought things over, and it occurred to him for the first time that he had not rewarded Nicanor for some signal services he had rendered him.  By some oversight no notice had been taken of Nicanor, though he had risked his life for the king.  Then Philip sent for him, and gave him a good appointment, which brought him in a handsome income, and was one of great honour.  Some while after, Philip said to his courtiers, \"How does Nicanor speak of me now?\"  They answered that he was never weary of praising the king. Then Philip said, \"Do you not see? it lies in ourselves whether we are well or evil spoken of.\"  It is seldom indeed that you will escape blame, that evil of some sort will not be spoken about you.  When that is the case, remember what Philip said, \"I must look and see whether I have not given occasion.\" Always go to your own heart, always examine your own life, and see whether, after all, there be not something there which is wrong or unwise, and which may be altered, so as to cut off occasion from evil speakers.  As the proverb says, \"There is no smoke without a fire,\" and it is not often that blame is cast without there being some cause for it.  It may be attributed unjustly, but it is sometimes just, though excessive.  Everything casts a shadow, and if you see a shadow you may be sure there is some body to cast it, though the shape and size of the shadow may be wholly unlike and out of proportion to the object which throws it.  A tree casts a shadow, a house casts a shadow, a needle casts a shadow, even a hair--where the shadow is, there is some substance to fling it; where great blame is cast, there is some occasion for it.  You may have stood on a rock, and seen your shadow thrown all down a valley and up the side of an opposite hill, an enormous figure, and a ridiculous caricature of yourself.  So the blame cast on you is often excessive and altogether unreasonable and monstrous.  Nevertheless it would never be cast at all unless there were some little fault to cast it.  Stick up a pin on a table when the sun is low, and it will throw a shadow from one end of the table to the other, four feet long, and the pin is only an inch in height.  So is it with faults: little faults throw long shadows, cause great talk, but there would be no talk at all if the little faults were not there.  II.  What then is it that you should do?  Examine yourselves whenever you are blamed, and do your utmost to correct what is amiss in you. \"Blessed are ye,\" said our Lord, \"when men shall revile you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely.\"  Why?  Why when falsely? Because it will make you all the more watchful that you give no offence, that you avoid even the appearance of evil.  Blessed are ye when men revile you, and say all manner of evil against you, for then you will examine yourselves, and if you see there is any ground whatever for what they say, you will amend your ways; and blessed are ye when they speak evil against you falsely, for then, though their blame be exaggerated and lying, yet it will make you infinitely more particular to live a blameless life, and to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men.  CONCLUSION.--If you do not use for your self-correction any blame you may undergo, then you may be sure that more and more will attach to you.  You may surmount one calumny, but others will follow at its heels.  In Revelation we hear that an angel cried, \"One woe is past; and behold there come two woes more hereafter.\"  So will it be with you, if the first woe does not profit you to make you better.  If the plague of stinging, tormenting insects had made Pharaoh better, and amend his ways, the other plagues would not have fallen upon him. Thus, when you are tormented by evil tongues and spiteful words, if you do not strive your utmost to live better lives, and undo any wrong you may have committed, though the first woe may be past: behold, there will come two more woes hereafter.     XLIX.  _PERFECTION TO BE SOUGHT._  12th Sunday after Trinity.  S. Mark vii., 37.  \"He hath done all things well.\"   INTRODUCTION.--It was said by an old heathen writer that God cares for Adverbs rather than for Substantives.  That is to say, God had rather have things done _well_, than that the things should be merely done. He had rather have you pray earnestly than pray, communicate piously than merely communicate, forgive your enemies heartily than say you forgive, work diligently than spend so many hours at work, do your duty thoroughly than solely be content with discharging your duty.  Of Christ, observe what is said.  It is not \"He hath opened the eyes of the blind, He hath unstopped the ears of the deaf.  He hath loosed the tongue of the dumb, He hath healed the sick,\" but--\"He hath done all things well.\"  The eyes do not become dull again, nor the ears again lose their power of hearing, nor the tongue stutter once more, nor the sick relapse into their sickness--what He hath done He hath done well and thoroughly.  SUBJECT.--This, then, is what God desires of you--whatever you undertake, to do it well.  Whatsoever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might.  If a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.  It is not sufficient for us to coldly perform our duties, we must perform them with zeal and thoroughness.  The prophet Amos was one day shown a vision.  \"Behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in His hand.  And the Lord said unto me, Amos, what seest thou?  And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.\"  In this vision we have the work of God, as carried out by the Israelites, represented under the form of a wall.  God had given them certain duties to perform, so much work in this world to be done for Him, and He left them to themselves for a while.  Then they thought, \"God is not here, He is not a hard overseer, we will work as we like, and take it easy.  So long as the thing is done, it does not matter very much how it is done.\"  So they did every thing in a careless, slovenly manner.  They neglected their duties or carried them out in a bare formal manner.  If we come back to the comparison of a wall, it was just as though masons engaged on one put in any sort of stones,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21988"],["title","Breaking Point (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (https://www.pgdp.net)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

GUNN  Illustrated by Ebel        [Illustration: Frontispiece: spaceman studying a chess board.]  [Illustration: Spider and rat in outer space surrounded by planets.]    The ship was proof against any test, but the men inside her could be strained and warped, individually and horribly. Unfortunately, while the men knew that, they couldn't really believe it. The Aliens could--and did.      _They sent the advance unit out to scout the new planet in the     _Ambassador_, homing down on the secret beeping of a featureless     box dropped by an earlier survey party. Then they sat back at     GHQ and began the same old pattern of worry that followed every     advance unit._      _Not about the ship. The _Ambassador_ was a perfect machine,     automatic, self-adjusting, self-regulating. It was built to last     and do its job without failure under any and all conditions, as     long as there was a universe around it. And it could not fail.     There was no question about that._      _But an advance unit is composed of men. The factors of safety     are indeterminable; the duplications of their internal     mechanisms are conjectural, variable. The strength of the unit     is the sum of the strengths of its members. The weakness of the     unit can be a single small failing in a single man._   _Beep ... boop ..._  \"Gotcha!\" said Ives. Ives was Communications. He had quick eyes, quick hands. He was huge, almost gross, but graceful. \"On the nose,\" he grinned, and turned up the volume.  _Beep ... boop ..._  \"What else do you expect?\" said Johnny. Johnny was the pilot--young, wide, flat. His movements were as controlled and decisive as those of the ship itself, in which he had an unshakeable faith. He slid into the bucket seat before the great master console.  _Beep ... boop ..._  \"We expect the ship to do her job,\" said Hoskins, the Engineer. He was mild and deft, middle-aged, with a domed head and wide, light-blue eyes behind old fashioned spectacles. He shared Johnny's belief in the machine, but through understanding rather than through admiration. \"But it's always good to see her do it.\"  _Beep ... boop ..._  \"Beautiful,\" said Captain Anderson softly, and he may have been talking about the way the ship was homing in on the tiny, featureless box that Survey had dropped on the unexplored planet, or about the planet itself, or even about the smooth integration of his crew.  _Beep ... boop ..._  Paresi said nothing. He had eyebrows and nostrils as sensitive as a radarscope, and masked eyes of a luminous black. Faces and motives were to him what gauges and log-entries were to the Engineer. Paresi was the Doctor, and he had many a salve and many a splint for invisible ills. He saw everything and understood much. He leaned against the bulkhead, his gaze flicking from one to the other of the crew. Occasionally his small mustache twitched like the antennae of a cat watching a bird.  Barely audible, faint as the blue outline of a distant hill, hungry and lost as the half-heard cry of a banshee, came the thin sound of high atmosphere against the ship's hull.  An hour passed.   _Bup-bup-bup-bup ..._  \"Shut that damned thing off!\"  Ives looked up at the pilot, startled. He turned the gain down to a whisper. Paresi left the bulkhead and stood behind Johnny. \"What's the matter?\" he asked. His voice was feline, too--a sort of purr.  Johnny looked up at him quickly, and grinned. \"I can put her down,\" he said. \"That's what I'm here for. I--like to think maybe I'll get to do it, that's all. I can't think that with the autopilot blasting out an 'on course'.\" He punched the veering-jet controls. It served men perfectly. The ship ignored him, homed on the beam. The ship computed velocity, altitude, gravity, magnetic polarization, windage; used and balanced and adjusted for them all. It adjusted for interference from the manual controls. It served men perfectly. It ignored them utterly.  Johnny turned to look out and downward. Paresi's gaze followed. It was a beautiful planet, perhaps a shade greener than the blue-green of earth. It seemed, indefinably, more park-like than wild. It had an air of controlled lushness and peace.  The braking jets thundered as Johnny depressed a control. Paresi nodded slightly as he saw the pilot's hand move, for he knew that the autopilot had done it, and that Johnny's movement was one of trained reflex. The youngster was intense and alert, hair-trigger schooled, taught to pretend in such detail that the pretense was reality to him; a precise pretense that would become reality for all of them if the machine failed.  But of course the machine would not fail.  Fields fled beneath them, looking like a crazy-quilt in pastel. On them, nothing moved. Hoskins moved to the viewport and watched them mildly. \"Very pastoral,\" he said. \"Pretty.\"  \"They haven't gotten very far,\" said Ives.  \"Or they've gotten very far indeed,\" said Captain Anderson.  Johnny snorted. \"No factories. No bridges. Cow-tracks and goat paths.\"  The Captain chuckled. \"Some cultures go through an agrarian stage to reach a technological civilization, and some pass through technology to reach the pastoral.\"  \"I don't see it,\" said Johnny shortly, eyes ahead.  Paresi's hand touched the Captain's arm, and the Captain then said nothing.   _Pwing-g-g!_  \"Stand by for landing,\" said the Captain.  Ives and Hoskins went aft to the shock-panels in the after bulkhead. Paresi and the Captain stepped into niches flanking the console. Johnny touched a control that freed his chair in its hydraulic gimbals. Chair and niches and shock-panels would not be needed as long as the artificial gravity and inertialess field functioned; it was a ritual.  The ship skimmed treetops, heading phlegmatically for a rocky bluff. A gush of flame from its underjets and it shouldered heavily upward, just missing the jagged crest. A gout of fire forward, another, and it went into a long flat glide, following the fall of a foothill to the plain beyond. It held course and reduced speed, letting the ground billow up to it rather than descending. There was a moment of almost-flight, almost-sliding, and then a rush of dust and smoke which over-took and passed them. When it cleared, they were part of the plain, part of the planet.  \"A good landing, John,\" Paresi said. Hoskins caught his eye and frowned. Paresi grinned broadly, and the exchange between them was clear: _Why do you needle the kid?_ and _Quiet, Engine-room. I know what I'm doing._ Hoskins shrugged, and, with Ives, crossed to the communications desk.  Ives ran his fat, skilled hands over the controls and peered at his indicators. \"It's more than a good landing,\" he grunted. \"That squeak-box we homed in on can't be more than a hundred meters from here. First time I've ever seen a ship bullseye like that.\"  Johnny locked his gimbals, ran a steady, sensitive hand over the turn of the console as if it were a woman's flank. \"Why--how close do you usually come?\"  \"Planetfall's close enough to satisfy Survey,\" said the Captain. \"Once in a while the box will materialize conveniently on a continent. But this--this is too good to be true. We practically landed on it.\"  Hoskins nodded. \"It's usually buried in some jungle, or at the bottom of a sea. But this is really all right. What a lineup! Point nine-eight earth gravity, Earth-type atmosphere--\"  \"Argon-rich,\" said, Ives, from the panel. \"Very rich.\"  \"That'll make no real difference,\" Hoskins went on. \"Temperature, about normal for an early summer back home ... looks as if there's a fiendish plot afoot here to make things easy for us.\"  Paresi said, as if to himself, \"I worry about easy things.\"   \"Yeah, I know,\" snorted Johnny, rising to stretch. \"The head-shrinker always does it the hard way. You can't just dislike rice pudding; it has to be a sister-syndrome. If the shortest distance is from here to there, don't take it--remember your Uncle Oedipus.\"  Captain Anderson chuckled. \"Cut your jets, Johnny. Maybe Paresi's tortuous reasoning does seem out of order on such a nice day. But remember--eternal vigilance isn't just the price of liberty, as the old books say. It's the price of existence. We know we're here--but we don't know where 'here' is, and won't until after we get back. This is _really_ Terra Incognita. The location of Earth, or even of our part of the galaxy, is something that has to be concealed at all costs, until we're sure we're not going to turn up a potentially dangerous, possibly superior alien"]]]
