She has changed the manner but not the substance, and she has used them because they were \"true stories\" and she wished that breath of life within the book. To all recorders of these things that verily happened, she here acknowledges her indebtedness and gives her thanks.     CONTENTS    I. THE BOTETOURT RESOLUTIONS    II. THE HILLTOP    III.

THE LONG ROLL     CHAPTER I  THE BOTETOURT RESOLUTIONS   On this wintry day, cold and sunny, the small town breathed hard in its excitement. It might have climbed rapidly from a lower land, so heightened now were its pulses, so light and rare the air it drank, so raised its mood, so wide, so very wide the opening prospect. Old red-brick houses, old box-planted gardens, old high, leafless trees, out it looked from its place between the mountain ranges. Its point of view, its position in space, had each its value--whether a lesser value or a greater value than other points and positions only the Judge of all can determine. The little town tried to see clearly and to act rightly. If, in this time so troubled, so obscured by mounting clouds, so tossed by winds of passion and of prejudice, it felt the proudest assurance that it was doing both, at least that self-infatuation was shared all around the compass.  The town was the county-seat. Red brick and white pillars, set on rising ground and encircled by trees, the court house rose like a guidon, planted there by English stock. Around it gathered a great crowd, breathlessly listening. It listened to the reading of the Botetourt Resolutions, offered by the President of the Supreme Court of Virginia, and now delivered in a solemn and a ringing voice. The season was December and the year, 1860.         *       *       *       *       *      _The people of Botetourt County, in general meeting assembled,     believe it to be the duty of all the citizens of the Commonwealth,     in the present alarming condition of our country, to give some     expression of their opinion upon the threatening aspect of public     affairs....      In the controversies with the mother country, growing out of the     effort of the latter to tax the Colonies without their consent, it     was Virginia who, by the resolution against the Stamp Act, gave the     example of the first authoritative resistance by a legislative body     to the British Government, and so imparted the first impulse to the     Revolution.      Virginia declared her Independence before any of the Colonies, and     gave the first written Constitution to mankind.      By her instructions her representatives in the General Congress     introduced a resolution to declare the Colonies independent States,     and the Declaration itself was written by one of her sons.      She furnished to the Confederate States the father of his country,     under whose guidance Independence was achieved, and the rights and     liberties of each State, it was hoped, perpetually established.      She stood undismayed through the long night of the Revolution,     breasting the storm of war and pouring out the blood of her sons     like water on every battlefield, from the ramparts of Quebec to the     sands of Georgia._  A cheer broke from the throng. \"That she did--that she did! 'Old Virginia never tire.'\"      _By her unaided efforts the Northwestern Territory was conquered,     whereby the Mississippi, instead of the Ohio River, was recognized     as the boundary of the United States by the treaty of peace.      To secure harmony, and as an evidence of her estimate of the value     of the Union of the States, she ceded to all for their common     benefit this magnificent region--an empire in itself.      When the Articles of Confederation were shown to be inadequate to     secure peace and tranquillity at home and respect abroad, Virginia     first moved to bring about a more perfect Union.      At her instance the first assemblage of commissioners took place at     Annapolis, which ultimately led to a meeting of the Convention which     formed the present Constitution.      The instrument itself was in a great measure the production of one     of her sons, who has been justly styled the Father of the     Constitution.      The government created by it was put into operation, with her     Washington, the father of his country, at its head; her Jefferson,     the author of the Declaration of Independence, in his cabinet; her     Madison, the great advocate of the Constitution, in the legislative     hall._  \"And each of the three,\" cried a voice, \"left on record his judgment as to the integral rights of the federating States.\"      _Under the leading of Virginia statesmen the Revolution of 1798 was     brought about, Louisiana was acquired, and the second war of     independence was waged.      Throughout the whole progress of the Republic she has never     infringed on the rights of any State, or asked or received an     exclusive benefit.      On the contrary, she has been the first to vindicate the equality of     all the States, the smallest as well as the greatest.      But, claiming no exclusive benefit for her efforts and sacrifices in     the common cause, she had a right to look for feelings of fraternity     and kindness for her citizens from the citizens of other States....     And that the common government, to the promotion of which she     contributed so largely, for the purpose of establishing justice and     ensuring domestic tranquillity, would not, whilst the forms of the     Constitution were observed, be so perverted in spirit as to inflict     wrong and injustice and produce universal insecurity.      These reasonable expectations have been grievously disappointed--_  There arose a roar of assent. \"That's the truth!--that's the plain truth! North and South, we're leagues asunder!--We don't think alike, we don't feel alike, and we don't interpret the Constitution alike! I'll tell you how the North interprets it!--Government by the North, for the North, and over the South! Go on, Judge Allen, go on!\"      _In view of this state of things, we are not inclined to rebuke or     censure the people of any of our sister States in the South,     suffering from injury, goaded by insults, and threatened with such     outrages and wrongs, for their bold determination to relieve     themselves from such injustice and oppression by resorting to their     ultimate and sovereign right to dissolve the compact which they had     formed and to provide new guards for their future security._  \"South Carolina!--Georgia, too, will be out in January.--Alabama as well, Mississippi and Louisiana.--Go on!\"      _Nor have we any doubt of the right of any State, there being no     common umpire between coequal sovereign States, to judge for itself     on its own responsibility, as to the mode and manner of redress.      The States, each for itself, exercised this sovereign power when     they dissolved their connection with the British Empire.      They exercised the same power when nine of the States seceded from     the Confederation and adopted the present Constitution, though two     States at first rejected it.      The Articles of Confederation stipulated that those articles should     be inviolably observed by every State, and that the Union should be     perpetual, and that no"]]]
