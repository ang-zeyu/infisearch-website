However, the princess did not think about right and wrong, unluckily.  She went to the bookcase and took down her _Cornelius Agrippa_, in one great tall black volume, with silver clasps which nobody else could open; for, as the princess said, there are books which it would never do to leave lying about where the servants or anybody could read them.  Nobody could undo the clasps, however strong or clever he might be; but the princess just breathed on them and made a sign, and the book flew open at the right place--Book IV., chapter vi., about the middle of page 576.  The magic spell was in Latin, of course; but the princess knew Latin very well, and soon she had the magic song by heart.  Then she closed the book and put it back on the shelf.  Then she threw open the window and drew back the curtains, and put out all the lights except two scented candles that burned with a white fire under a round mirror with a silver frame, opposite the window.  And into that mirror the moon shone white and full, filling all the space of it, so that the room was steeped in a strange silver light.  Now the whole room seemed to sway gently, waving and trembling; and as it trembled it sounded and rang with a low silver music, as if it were filled with the waves of the sea.  Then the princess took a great silver basin, covered with strange black signs and figures raised in the silver.  She poured water into the basin, and as she poured it she sang the magic spell from the Latin book.  It was something like this, in English:     \"Oh Lady Moon, on the waters riding,       On shining waters, in silver sheen,    Show me the secret the heart is hiding,       Show me the truth of the thought, oh Queen!     \"Oh waters white, where the moon is riding,       That knows what shall be and what has been,    Tell me the secret the heart is hiding,       Wash me the truth of it, clear and clean!\"  As she sang the water in the silver basin foamed and bubbled, and then fell still again; and the princess knelt in the middle of the room, and the moon and the white light from the mirror of the moon fell in the water.  Then the princess raised the basin, and stooped her mouth to it and drank the water, spilling a few drops, and so she _drank the moon_ and the knowledge of the moon.  Then the moon was darkened without a cloud, and there was darkness in the sky for a time, and all the dogs in the world began to howl.  When the moon shone again, the princess rose and put out the two white lights, and drew the curtains; and presently she went to bed.  {The Princess drinks the Moon: p41.jpg}  \"Now I know all about it,\" she said.  \"It is clever; everything the king does is clever, and he is so kind that I daresay he does not mean any harm.  But it seems a cruel trick to play on poor Ricardo.  However, Jaqueline is on the watch, and I'll show them a girl can do more than people think,\"--as, indeed, she could.  After meditating in this way, the princess fell sleep, and did not waken till her maid came to call her.  \"Oh! your Royal Highness, what's this on the floor?\" said the faithful Rosina, as she was arranging the princess's things for her to get up.  \"Why, what is it?\" asked the princess.  \"Ever so many--four, five, six, seven--little shining drops of silver lying on the carpet, as if they had melted and fallen there!\"  \"They have not hurt the carpet?\" said the princess.  \"Oh dear! the queen won't be pleased at all.  It was a little chemical experiment I was trying last night.\"  But she knew very well that she must have dropped seven drops of the enchanted water.  \"No, your Royal Highness, the carpet is not harmed,\" said Rosina; \"only your Royal Highness should do these things in the laboratory.  Her Majesty has often spoke about it.\"  \"You are quite right,\" said the princess; \"but as there is no harm done, we'll say nothing about it this time.  And, Rosina, you may keep the silver drops for yourself.\"  \"Your Royal Highness is always very kind,\" said Rosina, which was true; but how much better and wiser it is not to _begin_ to deceive!  We never know how far we may be carried, and so Jaqueline found out.  For when she went down to breakfast, there was the king in a great state of excitement, for him.  \"It's _most_ extraordinary,\" said his Majesty.  \"What is?\" asked the queen.  \"Why, didn't you notice it?  No, you had gone to bed before it happened. But I was taking a walk in the moonlight, on the balcony, and I observed it carefully.\"  \"Observed what, my dear?\" asked the queen, who was pouring out the tea.  \"Didn't you see it, Dick?  Late as usual, you young dog!\" the king remarked as Ricardo entered the room.  \"See what, sir?\" said Dick.  \"Oh, you were asleep hours before, now I think of it!  But it was _the_ most extraordinary thing, an unpredicted eclipse of the moon!  You must have noticed it, Jaqueline; you sat up later.  How the dogs howled!\"  \"No; I mean yes,\" murmured poor Jaqueline, who of course had caused the whole affair by her magic arts, but who had forgotten, in the excitement of the moment, that an eclipse of the moon, especially if entirely unexpected, is likely to attract very general attention.  Jaqueline could not bear to tell a fib, especially to a king who had been so kind to her; besides, fibbing would not alter the facts.  \"Yes, I did see it,\" she admitted, blushing.  \"Had it not been predicted?\"  \"Not a word about it whispered anywhere,\" said his Majesty.  \"I looked up the almanack at once.  It is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw, and I've seen a good many.\"  \"The astronomers must be duffers,\" said Prince Ricardo.  \"I never thought there was much in physical science of any sort; most dreary stuff.  Why, they say the earth goes round the sun, whereas any fool can see it is just the other way on.\"  King Prigio was struck aghast by these sentiments in the mouth of his son and heir, the hope of Pantouflia.  But what was the king to say in reply? The astronomers of Pantouflia, who conceived that they knew a great deal, had certainly been taken by surprise this time.  Indeed, they have not yet satisfactorily explained this eclipse of the moon, though they have written volumes about it.  \"Why, it may be the sun next!\" exclaimed his Majesty.  \"Anything may happen.  The very laws of gravitation themselves may go askew!\"  At this moment the butler, William, who had been in the queen's family when she was a girl, entered, and announced:  \"Some of the royal tradesmen, by appointment, to see your Majesty.\"  So the king, who had scarcely eaten any breakfast, much to the annoyance of the queen, who was not agitated by eclipses, went out and joined the tailors and the rest of them.     CHAPTER III. The Adventure of the Shopkeepers.   {Man with sword: p48.jpg}  Dick went on with his breakfast.  He ate cold pastry, and poached eggs, and ham, and rolls, and raspberry jam, and hot cakes; and he drank two cups of coffee.  Meanwhile the king had joined the tradesmen who attended by his orders.  They were all met in the royal study, where the king made them a most splendid bow, and requested them to be seated.  But they declined to sit in his sacred presence, and the king observed that, in that case he must stand up.  \"I have invited you here, gentlemen,\" he said, \"on a matter of merely private importance, but I must request that you will be entirely silent as to the nature of your duties.  It is difficult, I know, not to talk about one's work, but in this instance I am sure you will oblige me.\"  \"Your Majesty has only to command,\" said Herr Schnipp.  \"There have been monarchs, in neighbouring kingdoms, who would have cut off all our heads after we had done a bit of secret business; but the merest word of your Majesty is law to your loving subjects.\"  The other merchants murmured assent, for King Prigio was really liked by his people.  He was always good-tempered and polite.  He never went to war with anybody.  He spent most of the royal income on public objects, and of course there were scarcely any taxes to speak of.  Moreover, he had abolished what is called compulsory education, or making everybody go to school whether he likes it or not; a most mischievous and tyrannical measure!  \"A fellow who can't teach himself to read,\" said the king, \"is not worth teaching.\"  For all these reasons, and because they were so fond of the queen, his subjects were ready to do anything in reason for King Prigio.  Only one tradesman, bowing very deep and blushing very much, said:  \"Your Majesty, will you hear me for one moment?\"  \"For an hour, with pleasure, Herr Schmidt,\" said the monarch.  \"It is an untradesman-like and an unusual thing to decline an order; and if your Majesty asked for my heart's blood, I am ready to shed it, not to speak of anything in the line of my business--namely, boot and shoe making.  But keep a secret from my wife, I fairly own to your Majesty that I can _not_.\"  Herr Schmidt went down on his knees and wept.  {Herr Schmidt went down on his knees: p52.jpg}  \"Rise, Herr Schmidt,\" said the king, taking him by the hand.  \"A more honourable and chivalrous confession of an amiable weakness, if it is to be called a weakness, I never heard.  Sir, you have been true to your honour and your prince, in face of what few men can bear, the chance of ridicule.  There is no one here, I hope, but respects and will keep the secret of Herr Schmidt's confession?\"  The assembled shopkeepers could scarcely refrain from tears.  \"Long live King Prigio the Good!\" they exclaimed, and vowed that everything should be kept dark.  \"Indeed, sire,\" said the swordmaker, \"all the rest of us are bachelors.\"  \"That is none the worse for my purpose gentlemen,\" said his Majesty; \"but I trust that you will not long deprive me of sons and subjects worthy to succeed to such fathers.  And now, if Herr Schmidt will kindly find his way to the buttery, where refreshments are ready, I shall "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21994"],["title","Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son (#3)"],["body","the pleasure of conducting you to the scene of your labours.\"  Thus speaking, the king, with another magnificent bow, led the way upstairs to a little turret-room, in a deserted part of the palace. Bidding the tradesmen enter, he showed them a large collection of miscellaneous things: an old cap or two, a pair of boots of a sort long out of fashion, an old broadsword, a shabby old Persian rug, an ivory spy- glass, and other articles.  These were, in fact, the fairy presents, which had been given to the king at his christening, and by aid of which (and his natural acuteness) he had, in his youth, succeeded in many remarkable adventures.  The caps were the Wishing Cap and the Cap of Darkness.  The rug was the famous carpet which carried its owner through the air wherever he wished to go.  The sword was the Sword of Sharpness.  The ivory glass showed you anyone you wanted to see, however far off.  The boots were the Seven-league Boots, which Hop-o'-my-Thumb stole from the Ogre about 1697. There were other valuable objects, but these were the most useful and celebrated.  Of course the king did not tell the tradesmen what they were.  \"Now, gentlemen,\" said his Majesty, \"you see these old things.  For reasons which I must ask you to excuse me for keeping to myself, I wish you to provide me with objects exactly and precisely similar to these, with all the look of age.\"  The tradesmen examined the objects, each choosing that in his own line of business.  \"As to the sword, sire,\" said the cutler, \"it is an Andrea Ferrara, a fine old blade.  By a lucky accident, I happen to have one at home in a small collection of ancient weapons, exactly like it.  This evening it shall be at your Majesty's disposal.\"  \"Perhaps, Herr Schnitzler, you will kindly write an order for it, as I wish no one of you to leave the palace, if you can conveniently stay, till your business is finished.\"  \"With pleasure, your Majesty,\" says the cutler.  \"As to the old rug,\" said the upholsterer, \"I have a Persian one quite identical with it at home, at your Majesty's service.\"  \"Then you can do like Herr Schnitzler,\" who was the cutler.  \"And I,\" said the hatter, \"have two old caps just like these, part of a bankrupt theatrical stock.\"  \"We are most fortunate,\" said the king.  \"The boots, now I come to think of it, are unimportant, at least for the present.  Perhaps we can borrow a pair from the theatre.\"  \"As for the glass,\" said the optician, \"if your Majesty will allow me to take it home with me--\"  \"I am afraid I cannot part with it,\" said the king; \"but that, too, is unimportant, or not very pressing.\"  Then he called for a servant, to order luncheon for the shopkeepers, and paper for them to write their orders on.  But no one was within hearing, and in that very old part of the palace there were no bells.  \"Just pardon me for an instant, while I run downstairs,\" said his Majesty; \"and, it seems a strange thing to ask, but may I advise you not to sit down on that carpet?  I have a reason for it.\"  In fact, he was afraid that someone might sit down on it, and wish he was somewhere else, and be carried away, as was the nature of the carpet.  King Prigio was not absent a minute, for he met William on the stairs; but when he came back, there was not one single person in the turret-room!  \"Where on earth are they?\" cried the king, rushing through all the rooms in that part of the castle.  He shouted for them, and looked everywhere; but there was not a trace of tailor, hatter, optician, swordmaker, upholsterer.  The king hastened to a window over the gate, and saw the sentinels on duty.  \"Hi!\" he called.  And the sentinels turned round, looked up, and saluted.  \"Have you seen anyone go out?\" he cried.  \"No one, sire,\" answered the soldiers.  The king, who began to guess what had happened, hurried back to the turret-room.  There were all the tradesmen with parcels under their arms.  \"What means this, gentlemen?\" said his Majesty, severely.  \"For what reason did you leave the room without my permission?\"  They all knelt down, humbly imploring his compassion.  \"Get up, you donkeys!\" said the king, forgetting his politeness.  \"Get up, and tell me where you have been hiding yourselves.\"  The hatter came forward, and said:  \"Sire, you will not believe me; indeed, I can scarcely believe it myself!\"  \"Nor none of us can't,\" said the swordmaker.  \"We have been home, and brought the articles.  All orders executed with punctuality and dispatch,\" he added, quoting his own advertisement without thinking of it.  On this the swordmaker took out and exhibited the Andrea Ferrara blade, which was exactly like the Sword of Sharpness.  The upholsterer undid his parcel, and there was a Persian rug, which no one could tell from the magical carpet.  The hatter was fumbling with the string of his parcel, when he suddenly remembered, what the king in his astonishment had not noticed, that he had a cap on himself.  He pulled it off in a hurry, and the king at once saw that it was his Wishing Cap, and understood all about the affair.  The hatter, in his absence, had tried on the Wishing Cap, and had wished that he himself and his friends were all at home and back again with their wares at the palace.  And what he wished happened, of course, as was natural.  In a moment the king saw how much talk this business would produce in the country, and he decided on the best way to stop it.  Seizing the Wishing Cap, he put it on, wished all the tradesmen, including the shoemaker, back in the town at their shops, and also wished that none of them should remember anything about the whole affair.  In a moment he was alone in the turret-room.  As for the shopkeepers, they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed something odd; but, as it went no further, of course they did not talk about it, and nobody was any the wiser.  \"Owl that I am!\" said King Prigio to himself.  \"I might have better wished for a complete set of sham fairy things which would not work.  It would have saved a great deal of trouble; but I am so much out of the habit of using the cap, that I never thought of it.  However, what I have got will do very well.\"  Then, putting on the Cap of Darkness, that nobody might see him, he carried all the _real_ fairy articles away, except the Seven-league Boots, to his own room, where he locked them up, leaving in their place the sham Wishing Cap, the sham Cap of Darkness, the sham Sword of Sharpness, and the carpet which was not a magic carpet at all.  His idea was, of course, that Ricardo would start on an expedition confiding in his fairy things, and he would find that they did not act. Then he would be left to his own cleverness and courage to get him out of the scrape.  That would teach him, thought the king, to depend on himself, and to set a proper value on cleverness and learning, and minding his book.  Of course he might have locked the things up, and forbidden Ricardo to touch them, but that might have seemed harsh.  And, as you may easily imagine, with all the powers at his command, the king fancied he could easily rescue Ricardo from any very serious danger at the hands of giants or magicians or monsters.  He only wanted to give him a fright or two, and make him respect the judgment of older and wiser people than himself.     CHAPTER IV. Two Lectures.   {The Prince with the telescope: p64.jpg}  For several days Prince Ricardo minded his books, and, according to his tutors, made considerable progress in polite learning.  Perhaps he ought not to be praised too highly for this, because, in fact, he saw no means of distinguishing himself by adventures just at that time.  Every morning he would climb the turret and sweep the horizon, and even _much_ beyond the horizon, with the ivory spy-glass.  But look as he would, he saw no monsters preying on human-kind anywhere, nor princesses in distress.  To be sure he saw plenty of poor people in distress, and, being a good-hearted, though careless, lad, Dick would occasionally fly off with the Purse of Fortunatus in his pocket, and give them as much money as they needed--it cost him nothing.  But this was not the kind of adventure which he enjoyed.  Dragons for his money!  One day the Princess Jaqueline took a curious plan of showing Ricardo how little interest, after all, there is in performing the most wonderful exploits without any real difficulty or danger.  They were drifting before a light breeze on a hill lake; Ricardo was fishing, and Jaqueline was sculling a stroke now and then, just to keep the boat right with the wind.  Ricardo had very bad sport, when suddenly the trout began to rise all over the lake.  Dick got excited, and stumbled about the boat from stern to bow, tripping over Jaqueline's feet, and nearly upsetting the vessel in his hurry to throw his flies over every trout he saw feeding.  {Drifting in a light breeze: p66.jpg}  But, as too often occurs, they were taking one particular fly which was on the water, and would look at nothing else.  \"Oh, bother them!\" cried Ricardo.  \"I can't find a fly in my book in the least like that little black one they are feeding on!\"  He tried half-a-dozen different fly-hooks, but all to no purpose; he lost his temper, got his tackle entangled in Jaqueline's hair and then in the landing-net; and, though such a big boy, he was nearly crying with vexation.  The Princess Jaqueline, with great pains and patience, disentangled the casting line, first from her hair, which Ricardo was anxious to cut (the great stupid oaf,--her pretty hair!) then from the landing-net; but Dick had grown sulky.  \"It's no use,\" he said; \"I have not a fly that will suit.  Let's go home,\" and he threw a tin can at a rising trout.  \"Now, Dick,\" said Jaqueline, \"you know I can help you.  I did not learn magic for nothing.  Just you look the other way for a minute or two, and you will find the right fly at the end of your line.\"  Dick turned his head away (it is not proper to look on at magical arts), and then "]]]
