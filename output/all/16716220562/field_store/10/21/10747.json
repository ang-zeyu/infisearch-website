The old \"Peggy Stewart\" house famous in history, though no longer occupied by her own family, still stood, a landmark, in the heart of the town and was pointed to with pride by all.  \"Dis sho' is de capital city ob de State, Ma'am. Yonder de guv'nor's mansion, jist over dar stan' de co't house, an' yonder de Cap'tal an' all de yether 'ministrashum buildin's, an' we'all's powerful proud ob 'em.\"  Mrs. Stewart smiled a superior smile as she replied:  \"I have heard that the South is not progressive and is perfectly apathetic to conditions. It _must_ be. Heavens! Look at these streets! They are perfectly disgusting, and the odor is horrible. I shall be glad to drive home.\"  \"De town done been pave all mos' all new,\" bridled Jess. \"Dis hyar pavement de bes' ob brick. Miss Peggy done tole me ter be keerful whar I drive yo' at, an' I tecken yo' on de very be's.\"  \"And what, may I inquire, is your very worst then? Have you no street cleaning department in your illustrious city?\"  \"We suttenly _has_! Dey got six men a-sweeping de hull endurin' time.\"  \"What an overwhelming force!\" and Mrs. Stewart gave way to mirth.  It was fortunate that Peggy should have arrived at that opportune moment, for there is no telling what might have occurred: Jess's patience was at the snapping-point. But Peggy's talk with Nelly Bolivar had served to restore her mental equilibrium to a certain degree--and her swift ride into Annapolis had completed the process. It was a sunny, smiling face which drew up to the surrey and greeted Mrs. Stewart. Peggy had made up her mind that she would not let little things annoy her, and was already reproaching herself for having done so. She had resolved to keep her temper during her aunt's visit if a whole legion of tormenting imps were let loose upon her.  Three weeks of Mrs. Stewart's visit passed. Upon her part, three weeks of striving to establish a firmer foothold in the home of her brother-in-law; to obtain the place in it she so ardently coveted--that of mistress and absolute dictator. But each day proved to her that she was striving against some vaguely comprehended opposition. It did not lie in Peggy, that she had the grace to concede, for Peggy had complied with every wish, which she had graciously or otherwise, expressed, except the one debarring Tzaritza from following Shashai when she rode abroad, and be it said to Peggy's credit that she had held to her resolution in spite of endless aggravations, for Madam was a past mistress of criticism either spoken or implied. Never before in all her sunny young life had Peggy been forced to live in such an atmosphere.  Little by little during those weeks Mrs. Stewart had pre-empted Peggy's position as mistress of the household; a position held by every claim of right, justice and natural development, for Peggy had grown into it, and its honors and privileges rested upon her young shoulders by right of inheritance. She had not rushed there, or forced her claim to it, hence had it been gradually given into her hands by old Mammy, her nurse, Harrison, the trusty housekeeper, and at length, as she had more and more clearly demonstrated her ability to hold it, by Dr. Llewellyn, her guardian, who regarded it as an essential part of a Southern gentlewoman's education.  Then had come Mrs. Harold, whose tact and affection seemed to supply just the little touch which the young girl required to round out her life, and fit her to ultimately assume the entire control of her father's home.  But all this was entirely beyond Mrs. Stewart's comprehension. Her own early life had been passed in a small New Jersey village in very humble surroundings. She had been educated in the little grammar school, going later to an adjoining town for a year at high-school. In her home, domestic help of any sort had been unknown, she and her mother, an earnest, hard-working woman, having performed all the household work. There were no traditions connected with that simple home; it was just an everyday round of commonplace duties, accepted as a matter of course. Then Mrs. Stewart, at that time \"pretty Kitty Snyder,\" went as a sort of \"mother's helper\" to a lady residing in Elizabeth, whose brother was in a New Jersey College. Upon one of his visits to his sister he had brought Peyton Stewart home for a visit: Peyton, the happy-go-lucky, irresponsible madcap. Kitty Snyder's buxom beauty had turned all that was left to be turned of his shallow head and she had become Mrs. Peyton Stewart within a month.  The rest has been told elsewhere. For a good many years she had \"just lived around\" as she expressed it, her income from her husband's share of the very comfortable little fortune left him by his father, being a vast deal more than she had ever dreamed of in her youthful days. She felt very affluent. All things considered, it was quite as well that Peyton had quit this earthly scene after two years of married life for \"Kitty\" had rapidly developed extravagant tastes and there were many \"scenes.\" Her old associates saw her no more, and later the new ones often wondered why the dashing young widow did not marry again.  They did not suspect how often her plans laid to that end had misscarried, for her ambitions were entirely out of proportion to her qualifications.  Now, however, chance had brought her once more in touch with her husband's family, and she was resolved to make hay while the sun shone. If Neil Stewart had not been an odd mixture of manly strength and child-like simplicity, exceptional executive ability and credulity, kindliness and quick temper, he would never in the wide world have become responsible for the state of affairs at present turning his old home topsy-turvy, and in a fair way to undo all the good works of others, and certainly make Peggy extremely unhappy.  But he had \"made a confounded mess of the whole job,\" he decided upon receiving a letter from Peggy. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say upon reading between the lines, because it was not so much what Peggy had _said_ as that which she left unsaid, which puzzled him, and to which puzzle Harrison supplied the key in her funny monthly report. Never in all the ten years of her stewardship had she failed to send her monthly letter.  Harrison was a most conscientious old body if somewhat below par in educational advantages. Nevertheless, she had filled her position as nurse, maid and housekeeper to Peggy's mother for over thirty years, and to Peggy for ten more and her idea of duty was \"Peggy first, Martha Harrison second.\" Her letter to Neil Stewart, which he read while his ship was being overhauled in the Boston Navy Yard, set him thinking. It ran:       Severndale, Maryland.      September 21, 19--       Captain Neil Stewart,      U. S. N.       Respected Sir:--       As has been my habit these many years, I take my pen in hand to      make my monthly report concerning the happenings and the events of      the past month. Most times there isn't many of either outside the      regular accounts which, praises be, ain't never got snarled up none      since I've had the handling of them.       As to the past three weeks considerable has took place in this      quiet, peaceful (most times, at least) home, and I ain't quite sure      where I stand at, or am likely to. Things seem sort of stirred      round. Like enough we-all are old-fashioned and considerable sot in      our ways and can't rightly get used to new-fangled ones. Then, too,      we--I speak for everybody--find it kinder hard to take our orders      from anybody but Miss Peggy, who has got the right to give them,      which we can't just see that anybody else _has got_. Howsoever,      some folks seem to think they have, and what I am trying to get at      is, _have they_? If I have got to take them from other folks, why,      of course I have got to, but it has got to be _you_ that tells me I      must.       Up to the present time I seem to have been pretty capable of      running things down here, though I am free to confess I was right      glad when Mrs. Harold come along as she done, to give me a hint or      two where Miss Peggy was concerned, for that child had taken to      growing up in a way that was fair taking the breath out of my body,      and was a-getting clear beyond _me_ though, praises be, she didn't      suspicion the fact. If she had a-done it _my_ time would a-come for      sure. But the good Lord sent Mrs. Harold to us long about that time      and she was a powerful help and comfort to us all. _He_ don't make      no mistakes as a rule and I reckon we would a done well to let well      enough alone and not go trying to improve on his plans for us. When      we do that the _other one_ is just as likely as not for to take a      hand in the job and if he ain't a-kinder stirring round on these      premises right this very minute I'm missing my guess and sooner or      later there is going to be ructions.       Cording to the way _we_-all think down here Miss Peggy's mighty      close to the angels, but maybe we are blinded by the light o'love,      so to speak. Howsoever and nevertheless, we have got along pretty      comfortable till _lately_ when we have begun to discover that our      educasyons has been terribl neglected and we have all got to be      took in hand. _And we are being took powerful strong, let me tell      you!_ It is some like a Spanish fly blister: It may do good in the      end but the means thereto is some harrowing to the flesh and the      spirit.       I don't suppose there is no hope of your a-visiting your home      before the ship is ordered South for the fall target practice, more      is the pity. Tain't for me to name nothing but I wish to the Lord      Mrs. Harold was here. SHE is a lady--Amen.                                  Your most humble and obedient housekeeper,                                         Martha Harrison.  The day after this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22113"],["title","Peggy Stewart at School (#5)"],["body","was written Dr. Llewellyn 'phoned to Peggy that he would return at the end of the week and if quite agreeable would like to pass a few days at Severndale with her, as his own housekeeper had not yet returned from her holiday.  Peggy was in an ecstasy of joy. To have Compadre under her own roof from Saturday to Monday would be too delightful. Brimful of her pleasurable anticipations, and more like the natural, joyous girl of former days than she had been since leaving Mrs. Harold and Polly, she flew to the piazza where her aunt, arrayed in a filmy lingerie gown, reclined in one of the big East India chairs. For a moment she forgot that she did not hold her aunt's sympathies as she held Mrs. Harold's, and cried:  \"Oh, Aunt Katherine, Compadre will be here on Friday evening and will remain until Monday! Isn't that too good to believe?\"  \"Do you mean Dr. Llewellyn?\" asked Mrs. Stewart, coldly.  \"Yes, Aunt Katherine, you had no chance to know him before he went away, but you will just love him.\"  \"Shall I?\" asked Mrs. Stewart with a smile which acted like a wet blanket upon poor Peggy.  \"But why do you call him by that absurd name? Why not call him Dr. Llewellyn?\"  \"Call him Dr. Llewellyn?\" echoed Peggy. \"Why, I have never called him anything else since he taught me to call him by that dear name when I was a wee little thing.\"  \"And do you expect to cling to childish habits all your days, Peggy dear? Isn't it about time you began to think about growing up? Sit here upon this cushion beside me. I wish to have a serious talk with you and this seems a most opportune moment. I have felt the necessity of it ever since my arrival, but have refrained from speaking because I feared I might be misjudged and do harm rather than good. Sit down, dear.\"  Mrs. Stewart strove to bring into her voice an element of deep interest, affection was beyond her,--and Peggy was sufficiently intuitive to feel it. Nevertheless, if anything could have appealed to this self-centered woman's affection it ought surely to have been the young girl who obediently dropped upon the big Turkish cushion, and clasping her hands upon the broad arm of the chair, looked up into the steely, calculating eyes with a pair so soft, so brown, so trustful yet so perplexed, that an ordinary woman would have gathered her right into her arms and claimed all the richness and loyalty of affection so eager to find an outlet. If it could only have been Mrs. Harold, or Polly's mother, how quick either would have been to comprehend the loving nature of the girl and reap the reward of it.  Mrs. Stewart merely smiled into the wild-rose face in a way which she fondly believed to accentuate her own charms, and tapping the pretty brown hands with her fan, said:  \"I am growing extremely proud of my lovely niece. She is going to be a great credit to me, and, also, I foresee, a great responsibility.\"  \"A responsibility, Aunt Katherine?\" asked Peggy, a perplexed pucker upon her forehead. \"Have I been a responsibility to you since you came here? I am sorry if I have. Of course I know my life down here in the old home is quite different from most girls' lives. I didn't realize that until I met Mrs. Harold and Polly and then, later, went up to New London and saw more of other girls and the way they live. But I have been very happy here, Aunt Katherine, and since I have known Mrs. Harold and Polly a good many things have been made pleasanter for me. I can never repay them for their kindness to me.\"  Peggy paused and a wonderfully sweet light filled her eyes, for her love for her absent friends was very true and deep, and speaking of them seemed to bring them back to the familiar surroundings which she knew they had grown to love so well, and where she and Polly had passed so many happy hours.  Mrs. Stewart was not noted for her capacity for deep feeling and was more amused than otherwise affected by Peggy's earnest speech, classifying it as \"a girl's sentimentality.\" Finer qualities were wasted upon that lady. So she now smiled indulgently and said:  \"Of course I can understand your appreciation of what you consider Mrs. Harold's and her niece's kindness to you, but, have you ever looked upon the other side of the question? Have you not done a great deal for them? It seems to me you have quite cancelled any obligation to them. It must have been some advantage to them to have such a lovely place as this to visit at will, and, if I can draw deductions correctly, to practically have the run of. It seems to me there was considerable advantage upon _their_ side of the arrangement. You, naturally, can not see this, but I'll venture to say Mrs. Harold was not so unsophisticated,\" and a pat upon Peggy's hand playfully emphasized the lady's charitable view.  Peggy felt bewildered and her hands fell from the arm of the chair to her lap, though her big soft eyes never changed their gaze, which proved somewhat disconcerting to the older woman who had the grace to color slightly. Peggy then rallied her forces and answered:  \"Aunt Katherine, I am sure neither Mrs. Harold nor Polly ever had the faintest idea of any advantage to themselves in being nice to me. Why in this world should they? They have ten times more than _I_ could ever give to them. Why think of how extensively Mrs. Harold has traveled and what hosts of friends she has! And Polly too. Goodness, they let me see and enjoy a hundred things I never could have seen or enjoyed otherwise.\"  Mrs. Stewart laughed a low, incredulous laugh, then queried:  \"And you the daughter of Neil Stewart and a little Navy girl? Really, Peggy, you are deliciously _ingenue_. Well, never mind. It is of more intimate matters I wish to speak, for with each passing day I recognize the importance of a radical reconstruction in your mode of living. That is what I meant when I said I foresaw greater responsibilities ahead. You are no longer a child, Peggy, to run wild over the estate, but--well, I must not make you vain. In a year or two at most, you will make your _début_ and someone must provide against that day and be prepared to fill properly the position of chaperone to you. Meantime, you must have proper training and as near as I can ascertain you have never had the slightest. But it can not be deferred a moment longer. It is absolutely providential that I, the only relative you have in this world, should have met you as I did, though I can hardly understand how your father overlooked the need so long. Perhaps it was from motives of unselfishness, though he must have known that I stood ready to make any sacrifice for my dear dead Peyton's brother.\" Just here Mrs. Peyton's feelings almost overcame her and a delicate handkerchief was pressed to her eyes for a moment.  Ordinarily tender and sympathetic to the last degree, Peggy could not account for her strange indifference to her aunt's distress. She simply sat with hands clasped about her knees and waited for her to resume the conversation. Presently Madam emerged from her temporary eclipse and said:  \"Forgive me, dear, my feelings quite overcame me for a moment. To resume: I know dear Neil would never ask it of me, but I have been thinking very seriously upon the subject and have decided to forget self, and my many interests in New York, and devote my time to you. I shall remain with you and relieve you of all responsibility in this great household, a responsibility out of all proportion to your years. Indeed, I can not understand how you have retained one spark of girlish spontaneity under such unnatural conditions. Such cares were meant for older, more experienced heads than your pretty one, dear. It will be a joy to me to relieve you of them and I can not begin too soon. We will start at once. I shall write to your father to count upon me for everything and, if he feels so disposed, to place everything in my hands. Furthermore, I shall suggest that he send you to a fine school where you will have the finishing your birth and fortune entitle you to. You know absolutely nothing of association, with other girls,--no, please let me finish,\" as Peggy rose to her feet and stood regarding her aunt with undisguised consternation, \"I know of a most excellent school in New York, indeed, it is conducted by a very dear friend of mine, where you would meet only girls of the wealthiest families\" (Mrs. Stewart did not add that the majority had little beside their wealth to stand as a bulwark for them; they were the daughters of New York City's newly rich whose ancestry would hardly court inspection) \"and even during your school days you would get a taste of New York's social advantages; a thing utterly impossible in this dull--ahem!--this remote place. I shall strongly advise dear Neal to consider this. You simply cannot remain buried here. _I shall_, of course, since I feel it my duty to do so, but I can have someone pass the winter with me, and can make frequent trips to Washington.\"  Mrs. Stewart paused for breath. Peggy did not speak one word, but with a final dazed look at her aunt, turned and entered the house.     CHAPTER IV  HOSTILITIES RESUMED   As Peggy left the piazza her aunt's eyes followed her with an expression which held little promise for the girl's future happiness should it be given into Mrs. Stewart's keeping. A more calculating, triumphant one, or one more devoid of any vestige of affection for Peggy it would have been hard to picture. As her niece disappeared Mrs. Stewart's lips formed just two words, \"little fool,\" but never had she so utterly miscalculated. She was sadly lacking in a discrimination of values. Peggy had chosen one of two evils; that of losing her temper and saying something which would have outraged her conception of the obligations of a hostess, or of getting away by herself without a moment's delay. She felt as though she were strangling, or that some horrible calamity threatened her. Hurrying to her own room she flung herself upon her couch and did that which Peggy Stewart"]]]
