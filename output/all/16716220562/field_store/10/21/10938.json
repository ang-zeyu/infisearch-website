How'd you like to spend a winter here?\"  Dick Jarvis, chemist of the party, shivered as he looked up from his notebook. \"I'd just as soon spend it in a liquid air tank!\" he averred. \"These eighty-below zero summer nights are plenty for me.\"  \"Well,\" mused the captain, \"the first successful Martian expedition ought to be home long before then.\"  \"Successful if we get home,\" corrected Jarvis. \"I don't trust these cranky rockets--not since the auxiliary dumped me in the middle of Thyle last week. Walking back from a rocket ride is a new sensation to me.\"  \"Which reminds me,\" returned Harrison, \"that we've got to recover your films. They're important if we're to pull this trip out of the red. Remember how the public mobbed the first moon pictures? Our shots ought to pack 'em to the doors. And the broadcast rights, too; we might show a profit for the Academy.\"  \"What interests me,\" countered Jarvis, \"is a personal profit. A book, for instance; exploration books are always popular. _Martian Deserts_--how's that for a title?\"  \"Lousy!\" grunted the captain. \"Sounds like a cook-book for desserts. You'd have to call it 'Love Life of a Martian,' or something like that.\"  Jarvis chuckled. \"Anyway,\" he said, \"if we once get back home, I'm going to grab what profit there is, and never, never, get any farther from the earth than a good stratosphere plane'll take me. I've learned to appreciate the planet after plowing over this dried-up pill we're on now.\"  \"I'll lay you odds you'll be back here year after next,\" grinned the Captain. \"You'll want to visit your pal--that trick ostrich.\"  \"Tweel?\" The other's tone sobered. \"I wish I hadn't lost him, at that. He was a good scout. I'd never have survived the dream-beast but for him. And that battle with the push-cart things--I never even had a chance to thank him.\"  \"A pair of lunatics, you two,\" observed Harrison. He squinted through the port at the gray gloom of the Mare Cimmerium. \"There comes the sun.\" He paused. \"Listen, Dick--you and Leroy take the other auxiliary rocket and go out and salvage those films.\"  Jarvis stared. \"Me and Leroy?\" he echoed ungrammatically. \"Why not me and Putz? An engineer would have some chance of getting us there and back if the rocket goes bad on us.\"  The captain nodded toward the stern, whence issued at that moment a medley of blows and guttural expletives. \"Putz is going over the insides of the _Ares_,\" he announced. \"He'll have his hands full until we leave, because I want every bolt inspected. It's too late for repairs once we cast off.\"  \"And if Leroy and I crack up? That's our last auxiliary.\"  \"Pick up another ostrich and walk back,\" suggested Harrison gruffly. Then he smiled. \"If you have trouble, we'll hunt you out in the _Ares_,\" he finished. \"Those films are important.\" He turned. \"Leroy!\"  The dapper little biologist appeared, his face questioning.  \"You and Jarvis are off to salvage the auxiliary,\" the Captain said. \"Everything's ready and you'd better start now. Call back at half-hour intervals; I'll be listening.\"  Leroy's eyes glistened. \"Perhaps we land for specimens--no?\" he queried.  \"Land if you want to. This golf ball seems safe enough.\"  \"Except for the dream-beast,\" muttered Jarvis with a faint shudder. He frowned suddenly. \"Say, as long as we're going that way, suppose I have a look for Tweel's home! He must live off there somewhere, and he's the most important thing we've seen on Mars.\"  Harrison hesitated. \"If I thought you could keep out of trouble,\" he muttered. \"All right,\" he decided. \"Have a look. There's food and water aboard the auxiliary; you can take a couple of days. But keep in touch with me, you saps!\"  Jarvis and Leroy went through the airlock out to the grey plain. The thin air, still scarcely warmed by the rising sun, bit flesh and lung like needles, and they gasped with a sense of suffocation. They dropped to a sitting posture, waiting for their bodies, trained by months in acclimatization chambers back on earth, to accommodate themselves to the tenuous air. Leroy's face, as always, turned a smothered blue, and Jarvis heard his own breath rasping and rattling in his throat. But in five minutes, the discomfort passed; they rose and entered the little auxiliary rocket that rested beside the black hull of the _Ares_.  The under-jets roared out their fiery atomic blast; dirt and bits of shattered biopods spun away in a cloud as the rocket rose. Harrison watched the projectile trail its flaming way into the south, then turned back to his work.  It was four days before he saw the rocket again. Just at evening, as the sun dropped behind the horizon with the suddenness of a candle falling into the sea, the auxiliary flashed out of the southern heavens, easing gently down on the flaming wings of the under-jets. Jarvis and Leroy emerged, passed through the swiftly gathering dusk, and faced him in the light of the _Ares_. He surveyed the two; Jarvis was tattered and scratched, but apparently in better condition than Leroy, whose dapperness was completely lost. The little biologist was pale as the nearer moon that glowed outside; one arm was bandaged in thermo-skin and his clothes hung in veritable rags. But it was his eyes that struck Harrison most strangely; to one who lived these many weary days with the diminutive Frenchman, there was something queer about them. They were frightened, plainly enough, and that was odd, since Leroy was no coward or he'd never have been one of the four chosen by the Academy for the first Martian expedition. But the fear in his eyes was more understandable than that other expression, that queer fixity of gaze like one in a trance, or like a person in an ecstasy. \"Like a chap who's seen Heaven and Hell together,\" Harrison expressed it to himself. He was yet to discover how right he was.  He assumed a gruffness as the weary pair sat down. \"You're a fine looking couple!\" he growled. \"I should've known better than to let you wander off alone.\" He paused. \"Is your arm all right, Leroy? Need any treatment?\"  Jarvis answered. \"It's all right--just gashed. No danger of infection here, I guess; Leroy says there aren't any microbes on Mars.\"  \"Well,\" exploded the Captain, \"Let's hear it, then! Your radio reports sounded screwy. 'Escaped from Paradise!' Huh!\"  \"I didn't want to give details on the radio,\" said Jarvis soberly. \"You'd have thought we'd gone loony.\"  \"I think so, anyway.\"  \"_Moi aussi!_\" muttered Leroy. \"I too!\"  \"Shall I begin at the beginning?\" queried the chemist. \"Our early reports were pretty nearly complete.\" He stared at Putz, who had come in silently, his face and hands blackened with carbon, and seated himself beside Harrison.  \"At the beginning,\" the Captain decided.  \"Well,\" began Jarvis, \"we got started all right, and flew due south along the meridian of the _Ares_, same course I'd followed last week. I was getting used to this narrow horizon, so I didn't feel so much like being cooped under a big bowl, but one does keep overestimating distances. Something four miles away looks eight when you're used to terrestrial curvature, and that makes you guess its size just four times too large. A little hill looks like a mountain until you're almost over it.\"  \"I know that,\" grunted Harrison.  \"Yes, but Leroy didn't, and I spent our first couple of hours trying to explain it to him. By the time he understood (if he does yet) we were past Cimmerium and over that Xanthus desert, and then we crossed the canal with the mud city and the barrel-shaped citizens and the place where Tweel had shot the dream-beast. And nothing would do for Pierre here but that we put down so he could practice his biology on the remains. So we did.  \"The thing was still there. No sign of decay; couldn't be, of course, without bacterial forms of life, and Leroy says that Mars is as sterile as an operating table.\"  \"_Comme le coeur d'une fileuse_,\" corrected the little biologist, who was beginning to regain a trace of his usual energy. \"Like an old maid's heart!\"  \"However,\" resumed Jarvis, \"about a hundred of the little grey-green biopods had fastened onto the thing and were growing and branching. Leroy found a stick and knocked 'em off, and each branch broke away and became a biopod crawling around with the others. So he poked around at the creature, while I looked away from it; even dead, that rope-armed devil gave me the creeps. And then came the surprise; the thing was part plant!\"  \"_C'est vrai!_\" confirmed the biologist. \"It's true!\"  \"It was a big cousin of the biopods,\" continued Jarvis. \"Leroy was quite excited; he figures that all Martian life is of that sort--neither plant nor animal. Life here never differentiated, he says; everything has both natures in it, even the barrel-creatures--even Tweel! I think he's right, especially when I recall how Tweel rested, sticking his beak in the ground and staying that way all night. I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22301"],["title","Valley of Dreams (#1)"],["body","saw him eat or drink, either; perhaps his beak was more in the nature of a root, and he got his nourishment that way.\"  \"Sounds nutty to me,\" observed Harrison.  \"Well,\" continued Jarvis, \"we broke up a few of the other growths and they acted the same way--the pieces crawled around, only much slower than the biopods, and then stuck themselves in the ground. Then Leroy had to catch a sample of the walking grass, and we were ready to leave when a parade of the barrel-creatures rushed by with their push-carts. They hadn't forgotten me, either; they all drummed out, 'We are v-r-r-iends--ouch!' just as they had before. Leroy wanted to shoot one and cut it up, but I remembered the battle Tweel and I had had with them, and vetoed the idea. But he did hit on a possible explanation as to what they did with all the rubbish they gathered.\"  \"Made mud-pies, I guess,\" grunted the captain.  \"More or less,\" agreed Jarvis. \"They use it for food, Leroy thinks. If they're part vegetable, you see, that's what they'd want--soil with organic remains in it to make it fertile. That's why they ground up sand and biopods and other growths all together. See?\"  \"Dimly,\" countered Harrison. \"How about the suicides?\"  \"Leroy had a hunch there, too. The suicides jump into the grinder when the mixture has too much sand and gravel; they throw themselves in to adjust the proportions.\"  \"Rats!\" said Harrison disgustedly. \"Why couldn't they bring in some extra branches from outside?\"  \"Because suicide is easier. You've got to remember that these creatures can't be judged by earthly standards; they probably don't feel pain, and they haven't got what we'd call individuality. Any intelligence they have is the property of the whole community--like an ant-heap. That's it! Ants are willing to die for their ant-hill; so are these creatures.\"  \"So are men,\" observed the captain, \"if it comes to that.\"  \"Yes, but men aren't exactly eager. It takes some emotion like patriotism to work 'em to the point of dying for their country; these things do it all in the day's work.\" He paused.  \"Well, we took some pictures of the dream-beast and the barrel-creatures, and then we started along. We sailed over Xanthus, keeping as close to the meridian of the _Ares_ as we could, and pretty soon we crossed the trail of the pyramid-builder. So we circled back to let Leroy take a look at it, and when we found it, we landed. The thing had completed just two rows of bricks since Tweel and I left it, and there it was, breathing in silicon and breathing out bricks as if it had eternity to do it in--which it has. Leroy wanted to dissect it with a Boland explosive bullet, but I thought that anything that had lived for ten million years was entitled to the respect due old age, so I talked him out of it. He peeped into the hole on top of it and nearly got beaned by the arm coming up with a brick, and then he chipped off a few pieces of it, which didn't disturb the creature a bit. He found the place I'd chipped, tried to see if there was any sign of healing, and decided he could tell better in two or three thousand years. So we took a few shots of it and sailed on.  \"Mid afternoon we located the wreck of my rocket. Not a thing disturbed; we picked up my films and tried to decide what next. I wanted to find Tweel if possible; I figured from the fact of his pointing south that he lived somewhere near Thyle. We plotted our route and judged that the desert we were in now was Thyle II; Thyle I should be east of us. So, on a hunch, we decided to have a look at Thyle I, and away we buzzed.\"  \"_Der_ motors?\" queried Putz, breaking his long silence.  \"For a wonder, we had no trouble, Karl. Your blast worked perfectly. So we hummed along, pretty high to get a wider view, I'd say about fifty thousand feet. Thyle II spread out like an orange carpet, and after a while we came to the grey branch of the Mare Chronium that bounded it. That was narrow; we crossed it in half an hour, and there was Thyle I--same orange-hued desert as its mate. We veered south, toward the Mare Australe, and followed the edge of the desert. And toward sunset we spotted it.\"  \"Shpotted?\" echoed Putz. \"Vot vas shpotted?\"  \"The desert was spotted--with buildings! Not one of the mud cities of the canals, although a canal went through it. From the map we figured the canal was a continuation of the one Schiaparelli called Ascanius.  \"We were probably too high to be visible to any inhabitants of the city, but also too high for a good look at it, even with the glasses. However, it was nearly sunset, anyway, so we didn't plan on dropping in. We circled the place; the canal went out into the Mare Australe, and there, glittering in the south, was the melting polar ice-cap! The canal drained it; we could distinguish the sparkle of water in it. Off to the southeast, just at the edge of the Mare Australe, was a valley--the first irregularity I'd seen on Mars except the cliffs that bounded Xanthus and Thyle II. We flew over the valley--\" Jarvis paused suddenly and shuddered; Leroy, whose color had begun to return, seemed to pale. The chemist resumed, \"Well, the valley looked all right--then! Just a gray waste, probably full of crawlers like the others.  \"We circled back over the city; say, I want to tell you that place was--well, gigantic! It was colossal; at first I thought the size was due to that illusion I spoke of--you know, the nearness of the horizon--but it wasn't that. We sailed right over it, and you've never seen anything like it!  \"But the sun dropped out of sight right then. I knew we were pretty far south--latitude 60--but I didn't know just how much night we'd have.\"  Harrison glanced at a Schiaparelli chart. \"About 60--eh?\" he said. \"Close to what corresponds to the Antarctic circle. You'd have about four hours of night at this season. Three months from now you'd have none at all.\"  \"Three months!\" echoed Jarvis, surprised. Then he grinned. \"Right! I forget the seasons here are twice as long as ours. Well, we sailed out into the desert about twenty miles, which put the city below the horizon in case we overslept, and there we spent the night.  \"You're right about the length of it. We had about four hours of darkness which left us fairly rested. We ate breakfast, called our location to you, and started over to have a look at the city.  \"We sailed toward it from the east and it loomed up ahead of us like a range of mountains. Lord, what a city! Not that New York mightn't have higher buildings, or Chicago cover more ground, but for sheer mass, those structures were in a class by themselves. Gargantuan!  \"There was a queer look about the place, though. You know how a terrestrial city sprawls out, a nimbus of suburbs, a ring of residential sections, factory districts, parks, highways. There was none of that here; the city rose out of the desert as abruptly as a cliff. Only a few little sand mounds marked the division, and then the walls of those gigantic structures.  \"The architecture was strange, too. There were lots of devices that are impossible back home, such as set-backs in reverse, so that a building with a small base could spread out as it rose. That would be a valuable trick in New York, where land is almost priceless, but to do it, you'd have to transfer Martian gravitation there!  \"Well, since you can't very well land a rocket in a city street, we put down right next to the canal side of the city, took our small cameras and revolvers, and started for a gap in the wall of masonry. We weren't ten feet from the rocket when we both saw the explanation for a lot of the queerness.  \"The city was in ruin! Abandoned, deserted, dead as Babylon! Or at least, so it looked to us then, with its empty streets which, if they had been paved, were now deep under sand.\"  \"A ruin, eh?\" commented Harrison. \"How old?\"  \"How could we tell?\" countered Jarvis. \"The next expedition to this golf ball ought to carry an archeologist--and a philologist, too, as we found out later. But it's a devil of a job to estimate the age of anything here; things weather so slowly that most of the buildings might have been put up yesterday. No rainfall, no earthquakes, no vegetation is here to spread cracks with its roots--nothing. The only aging factors here are the erosion of the wind--and that's negligible in this atmosphere--and the cracks caused by changing temperature. And one other agent--meteorites. They must crash down occasionally on the city, judging from the thinness of the air, and the fact that we've seen four strike ground right here near the _Ares_.\"  \"Seven,\" corrected the captain. \"Three dropped while you were gone.\"  \"Well, damage by meteorites must be slow, anyway. Big ones would be as rare here as on earth, because big ones get through in spite of the atmosphere, and those buildings could sustain a lot of little ones. My guess at the city's age--and it may be wrong by a big percentage--would be fifteen thousand years. Even that's thousands of years older than any human civilization; fifteen thousand years ago was the Late Stone Age in the history of mankind.  \"So Leroy and I crept up to those tremendous buildings feeling like pygmies, sort of awe-struck, and talking in whispers. I tell you, it was ghostly walking down that dead and deserted street, and every time we passed through a shadow, we shivered, and not just because shadows are cold on Mars. We felt like intruders, as if the great race that had built the place might resent our presence even across a hundred and fifty centuries. The place was as quiet as a grave, but we kept imagining things and peeping down the dark lanes between buildings and looking over our shoulders. Most of the structures were windowless, but when we did see an opening in those vast walls, we couldn't look away, expecting to see some horror peering out of it.  \"Then we passed an edifice with an open arch; the doors were there, but blocked open by sand. I got up nerve enough to take a look inside,"]]]
