In that case you must ask the way to _Drei Könige_.\"[3b]  Here the waiter came in with the breakfast. It consisted of a pot of coffee, another of boiled milk, an omelette, some excellent cakes, and some honey. There was a long table extending up and down the room, which was a very large and handsome apartment, and there were besides several round tables in corners and in pleasant places near the windows. The breakfast for Mr. George and Rollo was put upon one of the round tables; and, in sitting down to it, Rollo took pains to place himself in such a manner that he could look out the window and see the water while he was eating.  \"What a dreadful river that would be to fall into!\" said Rollo. \"It runs so swift and looks so angry!\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"It runs swift because the descent is very great. Switzerland is very high; and the water, in running from it, flows very swiftly.\"  \"I did not know that Switzerland was all high,\" said Rollo. \"I knew that the mountains were high; but the valleys must be low.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"it is all high. The bottoms of the valleys are higher than the tops of the mountains in many other countries. In going into Switzerland, we go up hill nearly all the way; and so, even when we are at the bottom of the deepest valleys in Switzerland, we are up very high. There is Chamouni, for example, which is a deep valley near the foot of Mont Blanc. The bottom of that valley is six or seven times as high as the top of the Palisades on the North River.\"  \"O, uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"and it is so with all the Swiss valleys; and, accordingly, the water that comes down through them has a great descent to make in getting to the sea. Thus there are a great many falls, and cascades, and rapids; and, even in those places where the rivers run smoothly, the current is very swift and very strong.\"  While Mr. George and Rollo were eating their breakfast the attention of Rollo was occupied partly by the prospect of the river as he saw it through the open window, and partly by the various groups of travellers who were constantly coming into the room, or going out, or taking their breakfasts in little parties at the tables. Some who had finished their breakfasts were looking at maps and guide books which they had spread out before them on the tables. The room was very large, and very beautiful; and, as it was lighted on the back side by a row of wide and lofty windows which looked out upon the river, it wore a very bright and cheerful expression. At one end of it were glass doors, which led into another room very similar to this, as it likewise had windows looking out upon the river. This room was used as a sort of sitting room and reading room. There was a table in the centre, with newspapers, some French, some English, and some German, lying upon it. Rollo determined to go into this room as soon as he had finished his breakfast to see who was there and what they were doing.  \"Rollo,\" said Mr. George, after a short pause, \"do you wish to travel in Switzerland intelligently or blindly?\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, do you wish to understand something of the general features of the country first, so as to know always, as we go travelling on, where you are, and where you are going, and what you are to expect to see, or would you rather not trouble yourself at all about this, but take things as they come along, and enjoy them as you see them, without thinking or caring what is to come next.\"  \"Which is the best way?\" asked Rollo.  \"Either is a very good way,\" replied Mr. George. \"There is a pleasure in understanding and anticipating, and there is also a pleasure in wondering what is to come next and meeting with surprises. You can take your choice.\"  Rollo reflected a moment, and then he said that he thought he should like best to understand.  \"Very well,\" said Mr. George. \"Then I will explain to you the general features of Switzerland. Switzerland--or at least that portion of it which is the chief scene of the rambles of tourists and travellers--consists substantially of a long and deep valley, extending from east to west through the centre, and bordered by a range of mountains on each side. The range of mountains on the northern side of this valley is, of course, towards Germany; the one on the southern side is towards Italy. On the north side of the northern range of mountains is a broad slope of land, extending a hundred miles towards the German frontier. On the southern side of the southern range of mountains is a steep and narrow slope, extending to the Italian frontier.  \"Thus we may say,\" continued Mr. George, \"that Switzerland consists substantially of a broad northern slope of land and a narrow southern slope, with a deep valley between them. Do you understand this?\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo. \"If I had some damp sand, and a little wooden shovel, I think I could make it.\"  \"People do make models of the Swiss valleys and mountains,\" said Mr. George. \"In fact, they have maps of Switzerland, embossed with all the mountains in relief; and I wish very much that we had one here to look at.\"  \"There is one here,\" said Rollo, his face brightening up very luminously as he spoke. \"I saw it hanging up in the gallery, and I did not know what it was. It must be that. I'll go and show it to you after breakfast.\"  \"I am very glad,\" said Mr. George. \"I wished to see one very much. We will go and see it immediately after breakfast. But now let me tell you a little more about the country. You must not imagine that the northern slope, as I called it, is one smooth and uniform surface of descending land. There are mountains, and valleys, and lakes, and precipices, and waterfalls, and every other variety of mountain scenery scattered all over it, making it a most picturesque and romantic region. It is, however, on the whole, a slope. It begins with comparatively smooth and level land on the north and it terminates in a range of lofty mountain crests on the south; and you have to go over this crest somewhere, by some of the steep and difficult passes that cross it, to get into the central valley. We are on the margin of this slope now. When we leave here and strike into the heart of Switzerland we shall be gradually ascending it. I am going first to a place called Interlachen, which is in a deep valley far up this slope, just under the ridge of mountains. Interlachen is surrounded, in fact, by mountains, and a great many pleasant excursions can be made from it. We shall stop there a few days and make excursions, and then cross over by some of the mountain passes into the valley.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, in a tone of great satisfaction. \"I shall like that; I should like to go over a mountain pass. Shall we go in a carriage, or on horseback.\"  \"That depends upon which of the passes we take,\" said Mr. George. \"Some of them are carriage roads, some are bridle paths; and you ride over on mules or horses. Others are too steep and dangerous to ride over in any way. You have to go on foot, climbing up zigzag paths cut out of the rock, and over great patches of snow that horses and mules would sink into.\"  \"Let's go in one of those,\" said Rollo, straightening himself up.  \"Sometimes the path becomes narrower and narrower,\" continued Mr. George, \"until it is finally lost among the rocks, and you have to clamber around the point of some rocky cliff a thousand feet in the air, with scarcely any thing but the jagged roughness of the rocks to cling to.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Rollo, eagerly. \"Yes, sir. Let's go there. That's just the kind of road I want to go in.\"  \"Well, we'll see,\" said Mr. George. \"The first thing is to go to Interlachen. That is in the heart of the mountains, and very near the passes which lead over into the valley. When we get there we will study the guide book and the maps and determine which way to go.\"  \"And after you get into the valley,\" said Rollo, \"shall you go across it, and go over the mountains on the other side, into Italy?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Mr. George. \"Perhaps we shall not have time. I may think it is best to spend the time in rambling about among the mountains and glaciers near the head of the valley, where I believe is to be found the most stupendous scenery in all Switzerland.\"  The breakfast was now nearly finished, though the process of eating it had been a good deal impeded by the conversation, so large a share of it having fallen to Mr. George. Mr. George, however, explained to Rollo that their first day's journey from Basle would be south, towards Berne, the capital of the country--a city which was situated near the centre of the northern slope which Mr. George had described.  \"Do we go by a railway?\" asked Rollo.  \"No,\" said Mr. George; \"by a diligence.\"  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote 3a-3b: Mr. George, in speaking these words, did not pronounce them as you would suppose from the manner in which they are written. He pronounced them very much as if they were spelled Tru-ah Ru-ah. In the same manner, the German words, Drei Könige, he pronounced as if they were spelled Dhrai Ker-nig-ger.]     CHAPTER IV.  THE DILIGENCE.   A diligence is a sort of stage coach used in France and Switzerland, and generally on the continent of Europe. It is constructed very differently, however, from an American stage coach, being divided into four distinct compartments. Rollo had seen a diligence in Paris, and so he could understand very easily the conversation which ensued between himself and his uncle in respect to the seats which they should take in the one in which they were to travel to Berne. In order, however, to enable the reader of this book to understand it, I must here give a brief description of this kind of vehicle. The engraving on page 77 is a very faithful representation of one of them. There are three windows in the side of it. Each of these windows leads to a different compartment of the coach. In addition to these three"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22377"],["title","Rollo in Switzerland (#6)"],["body","ompartments, there is, over the foremost of these, on the top of the coach, another, making four in all. This compartment on the top is called the _banquette_.  These coaches are so large that they have a conductor. The man who drives sometimes sits on a small seat placed in front of the banquette, and sometimes he rides on one of the horses. In either case, however, he has nothing to do but to attend to his team. The passengers and the baggage are all under the conductor's care.  The compartment immediately beneath the banquette, which is the front compartment of the body of the coach, is called the _coupé_. The coupé extends across the whole coach, from one side to the other; but it is quite narrow. It has only one seat,--a seat facing the horses,--with places upon it for three passengers. There are windows in front, by which the passengers can look out under the coachman's seat when there is a coachman's seat there. The doors leading to the coupé are in the sides.  The compartment immediately behind the coupé is called the _interior_. It is entirely separate from the coupé. There are two seats, which extend from one side of the coach to the other, and have places upon them for three passengers each, making six in all. The three passengers who sit on one of these seats must, of course, ride with their backs to the horses. The doors leading to the interior are in the sides. In fact, the interior has within exactly the appearance of a common hackney coach, with seats for six passengers.  Behind the interior is the fourth compartment, which is called the _rotonde_. It is like a short omnibus. The door is behind, and the seats are on the sides. This omnibus compartment is so short that there is only room for three people on each side, and the seats are not very comfortable.  Very genteel people, who wish to be secluded and to ride somewhat in style, take the coupé. The seats in the coupé are very comfortable, and there is a very good opportunity to see the country through the front and side windows. The price is much higher, however, for seats in the coupé than in any other part of the diligence.  The mass of common travellers generally take places in the interior. The seats there are comfortable, only there is not a very good opportunity to see the country; for there are only two windows, one on each side, in the top of the door.  People who do not care much about the style in which they travel, but only desire to have the best possible opportunity to view the country and to have an amusing time, generally go up to the banquette. The places here are cheaper than they are even in the interior, and very much cheaper than they are in the coupé.  The cheapest place of all, however, is in the rotonde, which is the omnibus-like compartment, in the end of the diligence, behind. This compartment is generally filled with laborers, soldiers, and servants; and sometimes nurses and children are put here.  The baggage is always stored upon the top of the diligence, behind the banquette, and directly over the interior and the rotonde. It is packed away very carefully there, and is protected by a strong leather covering, which is well strapped down over it. All these things you see plainly represented in the engraving.  We now return to the conversation which was held between Rollo and Mr. George at the close of their breakfast.  \"I have got some letters to write after breakfast,\" said Mr. George, \"and I should like to go directly to my room and write them. So I wish you would find out when the diligence goes next to Berne, and take places in it for you and me.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I will; only how shall I do it? Where shall I go?\"  \"I don't know any thing about it,\" replied Mr. George. \"The guide book says that there is a diligence from Basle to Berne; and I suppose there is an office for it somewhere about town. Do you think you can find it?\"  \"I'll try,\" said Rollo. \"But how do we take seats in it? Is there a book for us to write our names in, with the place where they are to call for us?\"  \"I do not know any thing about it,\" said Mr. George. \"All I know is, that I want to go to Berne with you some way or other in the diligence, and I wish to have you plan and arrange it all.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I will, if I can find out. Only tell me what places I shall take.\"  \"I don't care particularly about that,\" replied Mr. George; \"only let it be where we can see best. It must be either in the coupé or in the banquette. We can't see at all, scarcely, in the other compartments.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo, \"I should like to be where I can see. But would you rather it would be in the coupé, or in the banquette?\"  \"That is just as you please,\" replied Mr. George. \"There are some advantages in being in the banquette.\"  \"What are they?\" asked Rollo.  \"There are four advantages,\" replied Mr. George. \"First, it is up very high, and is all open, so that you have a most excellent chance to see.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo. \"I shall like that.\"  \"The second advantage,\" said Mr. George, \"is, that it costs less. The places in the banquette are quite cheap.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo. \"I like that. So we can save some of our money.\"  \"The third advantage,\" continued Mr. George, \"is, that we have a great deal better opportunity to hear talking there. There are usually five persons in that part of the coach--the coachman, the conductor, and three passengers. That is, there will be one passenger besides you and me. He will probably be talking with the conductor part of the time, and the conductor will be talking with the coachman, and we shall be amused by hearing what they say.\"  \"But there are _six_ persons in the interior,\" said Rollo, \"to talk.\"  \"True,\" replied Mr. George; \"but, then, they are usually not so sociable there as they are up on the banquette. Besides, the noise of the wheels on the hard gravel roads is so loud there that we cannot hear very well. Then, moreover, when we stop to change horses, the hostlers and postilions come out, and our coachman and conductor often have a great deal of amusing conversation with them, which we can hear from the banquette; but we could not hear it, or see the process of harnessing and unharnessing, from the interior, nor even very well from the coupé.\"  \"Well,\" said Rollo. \"I like that. But that makes only three advantages. You said there were four.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"But as to the fourth, I do not know whether you will consider it an advantage or not.\"  \"What is it?\" said Rollo. \"I've no doubt but I shall.\"  \"Why, in getting up and down to and from the banquette you will have a great deal of hard climbing to do.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo. \"I shall like that. They are all advantages--very great advantages indeed.\"  So Rollo fully determined in his own mind that he would take places on the banquette. He thought that there was one disadvantage in that part of the coach; and that was, that in case of storm the rain would drive in directly upon them; but he found in the end that an excellent provision was made against this contingency.  The young gentlemen had now finished their breakfasts; and so they rose and went out to what Rollo called the gallery, to see the embossed map of Switzerland which he said that he had seen hanging there. The plan of this hotel was very peculiar. In the centre of it was a very large, open hall, almost like a court, only it was covered above with a roof and lighted by a skylight. Around this hall there was, in each story, an open gallery, with a railing on one side, over which you could look down to the floor below; and on the other side, at short intervals, there were doors leading to the various apartments. Between these doors, and against the walls, were hanging maps, plans, pictures, and other embellishments, which gave to these galleries a very attractive appearance. Here and there, too, on the different stories, there were sofas or other seats, with persons sitting upon them. Some were sewing, and some were attending children who were playing near. At the two ends of the hotel there were broad staircases connected with these galleries and leading from one to the other. Besides the galleries there were long corridors, extending each way from the centre of the building to ranges of apartments situated in the wings. The hotel, in fact, was very spacious, and it was very admirably arranged.  Rollo conducted Mr. George to the third story; and there, hanging against the wall, he found the embossed map of Switzerland which he had described. Mr. George and Rollo took this map down from its nail, and, seating themselves upon a settee which was near, they held it before them and examined it very attentively for some time. Mr. George showed Rollo the great central valley of Switzerland, with the ranges of mountains on each side of it. He showed him, too, the great slope of land which extended over the whole northern part of Switzerland. It was bounded on the north by the River Rhine and the frontier, and on the south by the great range of mountains which separated it from the valley. He showed him, too, the numerous lakes which were scattered over the surface of it.  \"You see,\" said he, \"that the waters which come out from the glaciers and the snow fields, and down through the chasms and ravines in the mountain sides, flow on till they come to some valley or place of comparatively low land; and they spread all over this depression, and flow into it more and more until they fill it up and make a lake there. When the lake is full the surplus waters run off clear wherever they find a channel.\"  \"Is that the way the lakes are formed?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"You will see that it is so when we get up to them.\"  \"_Up_ to them?\" said Rollo. \"You mean down to them.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. George. \"The lakes are up quite high. Many of them are far up the sides of the mountains. The water, in leaving them, runs very rapidly, showing that there is a great descent in the land where they are"]]]
