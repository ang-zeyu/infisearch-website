I merely meant that you could point out to her, as a father, where her duty and happiness lie.\"  \"Drink this!\" cried his lordship with sudden fury, spraying his can over the nearest bush, and addressing his remark to the invisible thrips. He had forgotten Lady Caroline completely. \"Don't stint yourselves! There's lots more!\"  A girl came down the steps of the castle and made her way towards them. She was a good-looking girl, with an air of quiet efficiency about her. Her eyes were grey and whimsical. Her head was uncovered, and the breeze stirred her dark hair. She made a graceful picture in the morning sunshine, and Reggie Byng, sighting her from the terrace, wobbled in his tracks, turned pink, and lost the thread of his remarks.  The sudden appearance of Alice Faraday always affected him like that.  \"I have copied out the notes you made last night, Lord Marshmoreton. I typed two copies.\"  Alice Faraday spoke in a quiet, respectful, yet subtly authoritative voice. She was a girl of great character. Previous employers of her services as secretary had found her a jewel. To Lord Marshmoreton she was rapidly becoming a perfect incubus. Their views on the relative importance of gardening and family histories did not coincide. To him the history of the Marshmoreton family was the occupation of the idle hour: she seemed to think that he ought to regard it as a life-work. She was always coming and digging him out of the garden and dragging him back to what should have been a purely after-dinner task. It was Lord Marshmoreton's habit, when he awoke after one of his naps too late to resume work, to throw out some vague promise of \"attending to it tomorrow\"; but, he reflected bitterly, the girl ought to have tact and sense to understand that this was only polite persiflage, and not to be taken literally.  \"They are very rough,\" continued Alice, addressing her conversation to the seat of his lordship's corduroy trousers. Lord Marshmoreton always assumed a stooping attitude when he saw Miss Faraday approaching with papers in her hand; for he laboured under a pathetic delusion, of which no amount of failures could rid him, that if she did not see his face she would withdraw. \"You remember last night you promised you would attend to them this morning.\" She paused long enough to receive a non-committal grunt by way of answer. \"Of course, if you're busy--\" she said placidly, with a half-glance at Lady Caroline. That masterful woman could always be counted on as an ally in these little encounters.  \"Nothing of the kind!\" said Lady Caroline crisply. She was still ruffled by the lack of attention which her recent utterances had received, and welcomed the chance of administering discipline. \"Get up at once, John, and go in and work.\"  \"I am working,\" pleaded Lord Marshmoreton.  Despite his forty-eight years his sister Caroline still had the power at times to make him feel like a small boy. She had been a great martinet in the days of their mutual nursery.  \"The Family History is more important than grubbing about in the dirt. I cannot understand why you do not leave this sort of thing to MacPherson. Why you should pay him liberal wages and then do his work for him, I cannot see. You know the publishers are waiting for the History. Go and attend to these notes at once.\"  \"You promised you would attend to them this morning, Lord Marshmoreton,\" said Alice invitingly.  Lord Marshmoreton clung to his can of whale-oil solution with the clutch of a drowning man. None knew better than he that these interviews, especially when Caroline was present to lend the weight of her dominating personality, always ended in the same way.  \"Yes, yes, yes!\" he said. \"Tonight, perhaps. After dinner, eh? Yes, after dinner. That will be capital.\"  \"I think you ought to attend to them this morning,\" said Alice, gently persistent. It really perturbed this girl to feel that she was not doing work enough to merit her generous salary. And on the subject of the history of the Marshmoreton family she was an enthusiast. It had a glamour for her.  Lord Marshmoreton's fingers relaxed their hold. Throughout the rose-garden hundreds of spared thrips went on with their morning meal, unwitting of doom averted.  \"Oh, all right, all right, all right! Come into the library.\"  \"Very well, Lord Marshmoreton.\" Miss Faraday turned to Lady Caroline. \"I have been looking up the trains, Lady Caroline. The best is the twelve-fifteen. It has a dining-car, and stops at Belpher if signalled.\"  \"Are you going away, Caroline?\" inquired Lord Marshmoreton hopefully.  \"I am giving a short talk to the Social Progress League at Lewisham. I shall return tomorrow.\"  \"Oh!\" said Marshmoreton, hope fading from his voice.  \"Thank you, Miss Faraday,\" said Lady Caroline. \"The twelve-fifteen.\"  \"The motor will be round at a quarter to twelve.\"  \"Thank you. Oh, by the way, Miss Faraday, will you call to Reggie as you pass, and tell him I wish to speak to him.\"  Maud had left Reggie by the time Alice Faraday reached him, and that ardent youth was sitting on a stone seat, smoking a cigarette and entertaining himself with meditations in which thoughts of Alice competed for precedence with graver reflections connected with the subject of the correct stance for his approach-shots. Reggie's was a troubled spirit these days. He was in love, and he had developed a bad slice with his mid-iron. He was practically a soul in torment.  \"Lady Caroline asked me to tell you that she wishes to speak to you, Mr. Byng.\"  Reggie leaped from his seat.  \"Hullo-ullo-ullo! There you are! I mean to say, what?\"  He was conscious, as was his custom in her presence, of a warm, prickly sensation in the small of the back. Some kind of elephantiasis seemed to have attacked his hands and feet, swelling them to enormous proportions. He wished profoundly that he could get rid of his habit of yelping with nervous laughter whenever he encountered the girl of his dreams. It was calculated to give her a wrong impression of a chap--make her think him a fearful chump and what not!  \"Lady Caroline is leaving by the twelve-fifteen.\"  \"That's good! What I mean to say is--oh, she is, is she? I see what you mean.\" The absolute necessity of saying something at least moderately coherent gripped him. He rallied his forces. \"You wouldn't care to come for a stroll, after I've seen the mater, or a row on the lake, or any rot like that, would you?\"  \"Thank you very much, but I must go in and help Lord Marshmoreton with his book.\"  \"What a rotten--I mean, what a dam' shame!\"  The pity of it tore at Reggie's heart strings. He burned with generous wrath against Lord Marshmoreton, that modern Simon Legree, who used his capitalistic power to make a slave of this girl and keep her toiling indoors when all the world was sunshine.  \"Shall I go and ask him if you can't put it off till after dinner?\"  \"Oh, no, thanks very much. I'm sure Lord Marshmoreton wouldn't dream of it.\"  She passed on with a pleasant smile. When he had recovered from the effect of this Reggie proceeded slowly to the upper level to meet his step-mother.  \"Hullo, mater. Pretty fit and so forth? What did you want to see me about?\"  \"Well, Reggie, what is the news?\"  \"Eh? What? News? Didn't you get hold of a paper at breakfast? Nothing much in it. Tam Duggan beat Alec Fraser three up and two to play at Prestwick. I didn't notice anything else much. There's a new musical comedy at the Regal. Opened last night, and seems to be just like mother makes. The Morning Post gave it a topping notice. I must trickle up to town and see it some time this week.\"  Lady Caroline frowned. This slowness in the uptake, coming so soon after her brother's inattention, displeased her.  \"No, no, no. I mean you and Maud have been talking to each other for quite a long time, and she seemed very interested in what you were saying. I hoped you might have some good news for me.\"  Reggie's face brightened. He caught her drift.  \"Oh, ah, yes, I see what you mean. No, there wasn't anything of that sort or shape or order.\"  \"What were you saying to her, then, that interested her so much?\"  \"I was explaining how I landed dead on the pin with my spoon out of a sand-trap at the eleventh hole yesterday. It certainly was a pretty ripe shot, considering. I'd sliced into this baby bunker, don't you know; I simply can't keep 'em straight with the iron nowadays--and there the pill was, grinning up at me from the sand. Of course, strictly speaking, I ought to have used a niblick, but--\"  \"Do you mean to say, Reggie, that, with such an excellent opportunity, you did not ask Maud to marry you?\"  \"I see what you mean. Well, as a matter of absolute fact, I, as it were, didn't.\"  Lady Caroline uttered a wordless sound.  \"By the way, mater,\" said Reggie, \"I forgot to tell you about that. It's all off.\"  \"What!\"  \"Absolutely. You see, it appears there's a chappie unknown for whom Maud has an absolute pash. It seems she met this sportsman up in Wales last summer. She was caught in the rain, and he happened to be passing and rallied round with his rain-coat, and one thing led to another. Always raining in Wales, what! Good fishing, though, here and there. Well, what I mean is, this cove was so deucedly civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else. He's the blue-eyed boy, and everybody else is an also-ran, with about as much chance as a blind man with one arm trying to get out of a bunker with a tooth-pick.\"  \"What perfect nonsense! I know all about that affair. It was just a passing fancy that never meant anything. Maud has got over that long ago.\"  \"She didn't seem to think so.\"  \"Now, Reggie,\" said Lady Caroline tensely, \"please listen to me. You know that the castle will be full of people in a day or two for Percy's coming-of-age, and this next few days may be your last chance of having a real, long,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2233"],["title","A Damsel in Distress (#2)"],["body","talk with Maud. I shall be seriously annoyed if you neglect this opportunity. There is no excuse for the way you are behaving. Maud is a charming girl--\"  \"Oh, absolutely! One of the best.\"  \"Very well, then!\"  \"But, mater, what I mean to say is--\"  \"I don't want any more temporizing, Reggie!\"  \"No, no! Absolutely not!\" said Reggie dutifully, wishing he knew what the word meant, and wishing also that life had not become so frightfully complex.  \"Now, this afternoon, why should you not take Maud for a long ride in your car?\"  Reggie grew more cheerful. At least he had an answer for that.  \"Can't be done, I'm afraid. I've got to motor into town to meet Percy. He's arriving from Oxford this morning. I promised to meet him in town and tool him back in the car.\"  \"I see. Well, then, why couldn't you--?\"  \"I say, mater, dear old soul,\" said Reggie hastily, \"I think you'd better tear yourself away and what not. If you're catching the twelve-fifteen, you ought to be staggering round to see you haven't forgotten anything. There's the car coming round now.\"  \"I wish now I had decided to go by a later train.\"  \"No, no, mustn't miss the twelve-fifteen. Good, fruity train. Everybody speaks well of it. Well, see you anon, mater. I think you'd better run like a hare.\"  \"You will remember what I said?\"  \"Oh, absolutely!\"  \"Good-bye, then. I shall be back tomorrow.\"  Reggie returned slowly to his stone seat. He breathed a little heavily as he felt for his cigarette case. He felt like a hunted fawn.  Maud came out of the house as the car disappeared down the long avenue of elms. She crossed the terrace to where Reggie sat brooding on life and its problem.  \"Reggie!\"  Reggie turned.  \"Hullo, Maud, dear old thing. Take a seat.\"  Maud sat down beside him. There was a flush on her pretty face, and when she spoke her voice quivered with suppressed excitement.  \"Reggie,\" she said, laying a small hand on his arm. \"We're friends, aren't we?\"  Reggie patted her back paternally. There were few people he liked better than Maud.  \"Always have been since the dear old days of childhood, what!\"  \"I can trust you, can't I?\"  \"Absolutely!\"  \"There's something I want you to do for me, Reggie. You'll have to keep it a dead secret of course.\"  \"The strong, silent man. That's me. What is it?\"  \"You're driving into town in your car this afternoon, aren't you, to meet Percy?\"  \"That was the idea.\"  \"Could you go this morning instead--and take me?\"  \"Of course.\"  Maud shook her head.  \"You don't know what you are letting yourself in for, Reggie, or I'm sure you wouldn't agree so lightly. I'm not allowed to leave the castle, you know, because of what I was telling you about.\"  \"The chappie?\"  \"Yes. So there would be terrible scenes if anybody found out.\"  \"Never mind, dear old soul. I'll risk it. None shall learn your secret from these lips.\"  \"You're a darling, Reggie.\"  \"But what's the idea? Why do you want to go today particularly?\"  Maud looked over her shoulder.  \"Because--\" She lowered her voice, though there was no one near. \"Because he is back in London! He's a sort of secretary, you know, Reggie, to his uncle, and I saw in the paper this morning that the uncle returned yesterday after a long voyage in his yacht. So--he must have come back, too. He has to go everywhere his uncle goes.\"  \"And everywhere the uncle went, the chappie was sure to go!\" murmured Reggie. \"Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.\"  \"I must see him. I haven't seen him since last summer--nearly a whole year! And he hasn't written to me, and I haven't dared to write to him, for fear of the letter going wrong. So, you see, I must go. Today's my only chance. Aunt Caroline has gone away. Father will be busy in the garden, and won't notice whether I'm here or not. And, besides, tomorrow it will be too late, because Percy will be here. He was more furious about the thing than anyone.\"  \"Rather the proud aristocrat, Percy,\" agreed Reggie. \"I understand absolutely. Tell me just what you want me to do.\"  \"I want you to pick me up in the car about half a mile down the road. You can drop me somewhere in Piccadilly. That will be near enough to where I want to go. But the most important thing is about Percy. You must persuade him to stay and dine in town and come back here after dinner. Then I shall be able to get back by an afternoon train, and no one will know I've been gone.\"  \"That's simple enough, what? Consider it done. When do you want to start?\"  \"At once.\"  \"I'll toddle round to the garage and fetch the car.\" Reggie chuckled amusedly. \"Rum thing! The mater's just been telling me I ought to take you for a drive.\"  \"You are a darling, Reggie, really!\"  Reggie gave her back another paternal pat.  \"I know what it means to be in love, dear old soul. I say, Maud, old thing, do you find love puts you off your stroke? What I mean is, does it make you slice your approach-shots?\"  Maud laughed.  \"No. It hasn't had any effect on my game so far. I went round in eighty-six the other day.\"  Reggie sighed enviously.  \"Women are wonderful!\" he said. \"Well, I'll be legging it and fetching the car. When you're ready, stroll along down the road and wait for me.\"                      *   *   *  When he had gone Maud pulled a small newspaper clipping from her pocket. She had extracted it from yesterday's copy of the Morning Post's society column. It contained only a few words:       \"Mr. Wilbur Raymond has returned to his residence at     No. 11a Belgrave Square from a prolonged voyage in his     yacht, the Siren.\"  Maud did not know Mr. Wilbur Raymond, and yet that paragraph had sent the blood tingling through every vein in her body. For as she had indicated to Reggie, when the Wilbur Raymonds of this world return to their town residences, they bring with them their nephew and secretary, Geoffrey Raymond. And Geoffrey Raymond was the man Maud had loved ever since the day when she had met him in Wales.    CHAPTER 2.  The sun that had shone so brightly on Belpher Castle at noon, when Maud and Reggie Byng set out on their journey, shone on the West-End of London with equal pleasantness at two o'clock. In Little Gooch Street all the children of all the small shopkeepers who support life in that backwater by selling each other vegetables and singing canaries were out and about playing curious games of their own invention. Cats washed themselves on doorsteps, preparatory to looking in for lunch at one of the numerous garbage cans which dotted the sidewalk. Waiters peered austerely from the windows of the two Italian restaurants which carry on the Lucretia Borgia tradition by means of one shilling and sixpenny _table d'hôte_ luncheons. The proprietor of the grocery store on the corner was bidding a silent farewell to a tomato which even he, though a dauntless optimist, had been compelled to recognize as having outlived its utility. On all these things the sun shone with a genial smile. Round the corner, in Shaftesbury Avenue, an east wind was doing its best to pierce the hardened hides of the citizenry; but it did not penetrate into Little Gooch Street, which, facing south and being narrow and sheltered, was enabled practically to bask.  Mac, the stout guardian of the stage door of the Regal Theatre, whose gilded front entrance is on the Avenue, emerged from the little glass case in which the management kept him, and came out to observe life and its phenomena with an indulgent eye. Mac was feeling happy this morning. His job was a permanent one, not influenced by the success or failure of the productions which followed one another at the theatre throughout the year; but he felt, nevertheless, a sort of proprietary interest in these ventures, and was pleased when they secured the approval of the public. Last night's opening, a musical piece by an American author and composer, had undoubtedly made a big hit, and Mac was glad, because he liked what he had seen of the company, and, in the brief time in which he had known him, had come to entertain a warm regard for George Bevan, the composer, who had travelled over from New York to help with the London production.  George Bevan turned the corner now, walking slowly, and, it seemed to Mac, gloomily towards the stage door. He was a young man of about twenty-seven, tall and well knit, with an agreeable, clean-cut face, of which a pair of good and honest eyes were the most noticeable feature. His sensitive mouth was drawn down a little at the corners, and he looked tired.  \"Morning, Mac.\"  \"Good morning, sir.\"  \"Anything for me?\"  \"Yes, sir. Some telegrams. I'll get 'em. Oh, I'll _get_ 'em,\" said Mac, as if reassuring some doubting friend and supporter as to his ability to carry through a labour of Hercules.  He disappeared into his glass case. George Bevan remained outside in the street surveying the frisking children with a sombre glance. They seemed to him very noisy, very dirty and very young. Disgustingly young. Theirs was joyous, exuberant youth which made a fellow feel at least sixty. Something was wrong with George today, for normally he was fond of children. Indeed, normally he was fond of most things. He was a good-natured and cheerful young man, who liked life and the great majority of those who lived it contemporaneously with himself. He had no enemies and many friends.  But today he had noticed from the moment he had got out of bed that something was amiss with the world. Either he was in the grip of some divine discontent due to the highly developed condition of his soul, or else he had a grouch. One of the two. Or it might have been the reaction from the emotions of the previous night. On the morning after an opening your sensitive artist is always apt to feel as if he had been dried over a barrel.  Besides, last night there had been a supper party after the performance at the flat which the comedian of the troupe had rented in Jermyn Street, a forced, rowdy supper party where a number of tired people with over-strained nerves had seemed to"]]]
