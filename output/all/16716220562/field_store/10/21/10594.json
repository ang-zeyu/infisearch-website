He guards that horse as if the animal was worth its weight in dollar bills.\"  \"Which comes entirely from the fact that Hogan here tried to knock the horse out once,\" declared Harlow.  \"I don't know about that, either,\" said Hartwick. \"But I want to say one thing here and now: If there's any one of this party who is playing double and carrying information to Merriwell, he'd better order his own coffin without delay, for he is bound to be found out, and we'll throw him cold in a minute.\"  He looked at Ditson in a most significant manner as he said this, but Roll showed no signs of guilt.  \"Well, what's yer plan of war, boss?\" asked Hogan, impatiently.  \"Don't get in too much of a hurry,\" scowled Hartwick.  \"We know Merriwell intends to enter Nemo in the Mystic Park races, at Bethany.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"That is the time to get at him.\"  \"How?\"  \"He has money to burn. Get him to back Nemo for large sums for any of the first three positions. Give him all sorts of odds, if necessary; but get him to chuck up the dough, and then beat him out.\"  \"That's all right,\" growled Hogan; \"but where's the dough comin' from what is shoved up against his good stuff?\"  \"Let me alone for that,\" said Hartwick, significantly. \"I know a way to get it, and we'll have it. I wish we might get Merriwell to stake his entire fortune on that horse. We'd end his career at Yale.\"  Harris laughed.  \"I'd like to know how you are going to get so much money, Hart?\" he cried. \"Why, I had to lend you twenty as capital the last game of poker you entered.\"  \"Don't let anything worry you if you don't know all about it, Sport,\" advised Hartwick. \"You've got your twenty back, haven't you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, you can't kick.\"  \"All right; but I'm afraid your scheme won't work out very well.\"  \"It will, just as hard, if we can depend on Mike here to make sure Merriwell's horse does not win.\"  \"Watcher want me ter do?\" asked Mike.  \"Doctor the animal at the last moment, if you can't buy off the jockey.\"  \"That's easy! But where does my share of ther profits come in?\"  \"You shall have your share, don't you worry. We'll have that all arranged in advance.\"  \"Then that goes! I am with yer, gents.\"  \"What are the rest of us to do?\" asked Harris.  \"There will be something for all of us to do. Ditson must continue to play the spy on Merriwell.\"  \"And that's the most dangerous job of all!\" cried Roll. \"You know what came near happening to me the night I found out Merriwell intended to put Nemo in the Mystic Park races. I was nearly chewed up by Diamond's dog.\"  \"But you escaped with your life,\" said Harris.  \"Because I took that cane with the loaded end. If it hadn't been for that the infernal dog would have eaten me. I hit him an awful blow. It would have killed any other dog.\"  \"Well,\" said Harlow, \"we'll strike a different kind of a blow directly--one that will do more than lay out a dog.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  TAKING CHANCES.   It was the day of the spring races at Mystic Park, and Bethany was filled with strangers. Horsemen, sporting men, sightseers, touts, race-track gamblers, women in gay attire, and all the different kinds of persons usually seen at a country horse race in the State of Connecticut were on hand.  A number of Yale lads had come up to Bethany to attend the races. The most of them were friends of Frank Merriwell. Some of his enemies were there, also.  Frank had brought Nemo up himself, and he scarcely slept the night before the races. He felt that there was danger in the air.  Nemo had been entered in the \"free for all,\" and his name was on the bills. Frank had been informed that he would be given odds that his horse did not take a purse. He had received an anonymous letter ridiculing him for thinking of entering such a horse. He had been taunted and told that he dared not stake money on Nemo.  Merriwell knew well enough that there was a plot afloat, and it seemed that the scheme was to make him lose money on his horse. If he had been timid he would have hesitated about backing Nemo for anything; but the ones who had been taunting him had reckoned well on his mettle, and they had succeeded in pricking his pride and arousing him.  Frank had seen Nemo work on a track with Toots in the saddle. He had timed the horse repeatedly, and he felt confident that Nemo could not fail to take a position if he were in proper form when he entered the race.  Frank sent for money. He demanded it. His guardian did not feel like refusing, as he remembered that his last effort to suppress Frank had resulted in a most painful train of incidents, the culmination being his arrest for kidnaping a baby. He sent Frank a check for the sum desired.  When Bethany was reached Merriwell was approached by a tall, thin man, who wore a Prince Albert coat and looked like a parson. This man introduced himself as John Baldwin, and he proved to be very \"smooth.\"  Frank knew in a moment that the stranger was trying to catch him for a sucker. He felt like knocking the man down, but, instead of that, he bet three hundred and fifty dollars against a thousand dollars that Nemo would take a purse in the \"free for all.\"  John Baldwin departed, apparently looking for other bloods who wished to take flyers. But Frank was to see Baldwin again. The man came back and in the most sneering manner possible, offered to let him out of his bet for fifty dollars. He told Frank that Nemo was a \"dead one\" and could not even crawl. The result was that Merriwell bet the man five hundred even that Nemo would take a purse, and there were but three purses in the \"free for all.\"  After Baldwin departed the second time Frank regretted that he had not booted the insolent fellow.  \"Never mind,\" thought the lad. \"I'll win his cash all right.\"  In the morning there was a row in the stable where Nemo was kept. Toots was found vigorously punishing a flashily dressed negro.  \"Tek dat, yo' dirty brack nigger!\" shouted Toots, as he smashed the other fellow on the nose. \"Yo' cayn't com' 'roun' dis chile wid none ob yere 'swinuations an' yore offers ob money to throw de race! I'll kick part ob yore panjaloons clean out frough de top of yore hade, yo' brack son ob a gun!\"  The colored boy fought like a furious tiger, and the other fellow, after trying to strike back a few times, took to his heels, leaving a smashed silk hat behind him.  \"What's the matter, Toots?\" asked Frank, who had rushed to the scene of the conflict, accompanied by others.  \"Mattah, sar?\" cried Toots, fiercely. \"Why, dat brack whelp come call me out ob de stall har, an' he says to me, says he, 'If yo' pulls Nemo so he don' take a purse it am wuff two hundred dollars to yo'.' An' he flashes his roll ob bills in mah face. I didn't wait fo' no mo' conwersashun, sar, but I jes' soaked him a dandy under der ear.\"  \"Good boy, Toots!\" laughed Frank. \"You're all right!\"  \"Well, w'en dey fools 'roun' dis chile dey strikes hot stuff,\" grinned the boy.  Frank knew now that there was a \"job\" to knife him in the race. Rattleton and Diamond were on hand, and they took turns in helping Toots keep guard over Nemo.  Merriwell was angry. He went out looking for John Baldwin. When he found Baldwin he offered to bet all the money he had about him that Nemo would take either the first or the second purse. Baldwin snapped at the bet in a manner that showed he believed he had a \"soft thing.\"  \"You'll go back to Yale broke,\" he sneered.  \"Don't let that worry you,\" returned Frank, coolly. \"It strikes me that the fellow who is furnishing you with cash stands a chance of dropping something.\"  \"You say that very mildly. You're scared now.\"  \"If I had more money about my clothes I'd put it all up.\"  \"That shows what an easy thing you are. I'll take your paper against my good money, and now you don't dare do a thing.\"  \"How much do you want to risk that way?\"  \"Any sum you like.\"  \"I'll go you for five hundred.\"  \"Done.\"  Frank had made the original selection of stakeholder, and he had chosen a man who was interested in the track, but was known to be perfectly square. This choice had proved satisfactory to Baldwin.  Once more this man was hunted up, and he felt it his duty to caution Frank. The boy simply smiled.  \"Don't lose any sleep about me, Mr. Davis,\" said Frank, quietly. \"It isn't necessary.\"  Twenty minutes after this bet was made John Baldwin informed Evan Hartwick.  \"Good!\" cried Hartwick, fiercely. \"If I get hold of that piece of paper I'll use it to ruin Frank Merriwell at Yale. I can do it! Nemo must be fixed for fair!\"  Then he rushed away.  \"Oh, well!\" said Baldwin, with a satisfied smile; \"I don't care which way the wind blows now. I have made my commission on this work to-day, and I have nothing to lose. If those fellows slip up in their plans it won't be my funeral.\"  Then he lighted a cigar and strolled away.  Rattleton and Diamond watched Nemo closely, permitting Toots to get an hour's sleep. Then the colored boy came out feeling first rate, and Merriwell showed up to take his friends to have something to eat.  \"By Jove!\" he exclaimed, with a happy laugh. \"One of you fellows will have to loan me the money to settle for the feed. I've staked every cent on Nemo, and I haven't enough left to purchase a sandwich.\"  \"Whew!\" whistled Diamond. \"Haven't you been plunging pretty steep, old man?\"  \"Oh, I don't know!\" smiled Frank. \"We'll have money to start a conflagration with when we return to New Haven.\"  \"I think so,\" agreed Jack; \"but there are slips.\"  \"Now, Toots,\" said Frank, \"we are going to leave Nemo in your care for a short time. You know what I expect of you.\"  \"Yes, sar, an' you may 'pend on me, sar.\"  \"All right, my boy. Come on, fellows.\"  Away the three went, arm in arm, laughing and joking, like the light-hearted fellows they were.  Ten minutes after they left Toots decided to give Nemo some water. He stepped out of the stall for a bucket. As he picked it up he fancied he heard "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21973"],["title","Anecdotes of the Habits and Instinct of Animals (#0)"],["body","was produced from images generously made available by The University of Florida, The Internet Archive/Children's Library)       [Illustration: THE MONKEY PAINTER--Page 7.]  ANECDOTES OF THE HABITS AND INSTINCT OF ANIMALS.

In making a selection of anecdotes, those have been assembled which were supplied by me to other works, and in most instances have received considerable amplification; others have been given which never before were printed--perhaps not even written; while all which have been transferred from other pages to mine have received the stamp of authenticity. Besides those whose names are already mentioned, I have to thank several friends who have drawn from their private stores for my advantage, and thus enabled me to offer much that is perfectly new.         *       *       *       *       *  Dry details of science and classification have been laid aside, but a certain order has been kept to avoid confusion; and, although endeavours have been made to throw as much interest as possible over these recorded habits and actions of the brute creation; I love the latter too well to raise a doubt by one word of embellishment, even if I did not abstain from principle.         *       *       *       *       *  The intentions with which this work was commenced have not been carried out, inasmuch as materials have crowded upon me beyond all calculation; and, although a large portion has been rejected, the anecdotes related go no farther than the Mammalia, while almost all animals were to have been included.         *       *       *       *       *  With regard to the remaining orders--if the present work should meet with a favourable reception, I shall hope next year to present the public with touching and amusing proofs of the sagacity and dispositions of birds, and of \"hair-breadth scapes\" from reptiles, etc., some of which will, like those in the present volume, be carefully selected from the works of travellers, from the resources of friends, and from my own experience.         *       *       *       *       *  To the pleasing task of enlightening those, who, shut up in close cities, have no opportunity of observing for themselves, and to the still higher enjoyment of directing young minds to an elevating pursuit, the naturalist adds a gratification even better than all, by making known the hidden wonders of nature; and leaving to those who delight in argument, the ever unsolved question of where instinct ends and reason begins, he sets forth the love of the great Creator towards all His creatures, and the ways He takes to show His wisdom.

THE QUADRUMANA, OR MONKEY TRIBE.   Formed like man, and practicing similar gestures, but with thumbs instead of great toes upon their feet, and with so narrow a heel-bone, that even those who constantly walk upright have not the firm and dignified step of human beings; the Quadrumana yet approximate so closely to us, that they demand the first place in a book devoted principally to the intellectual (whether it be reason or instinct) history of animals. This approximation is a matter of amusement to some; but to the larger portion of mankind, I should say, it is a source of disgust. \"Rapoynda,\" I exclaimed, one day, to a troublesome, inquisitive, restless negro, pointing to a black monkey, which much resembled him in character, \"that is your brother.\" Never shall I forget the malignant scowl which passed over the man's features at my heedless comparison. No apology, no kindness, not even the gift of a smart waistcoat, which he greatly coveted, ever restored me to his good graces; and I was not sorry when his Chief summoned him from my vicinity, for I dreaded his revenge.  A few years after, I stood lost in admiration before Sir Edwin Landseer's inimitable picture of \"the monkey who had seen the world,\" in which nature and truth lend their tone and force to the highest efforts of art; when a voice exclaimed, \"How can you waste your time looking at that thing; such creatures ought never to have been painted;\" and although the speaker was a religious man, he muttered to himself, \"I am not sure they ought ever to have been made.\" The voice proceeded from one of the finest instances of manly beauty; one famed also for talent and acquirement. Rapoynda started into my recollection; and as I slowly left the talented picture, I could not help smiling at the common feeling between the savage and the gentleman, thereby proving its universality.  Never did any one start for a tropical climate with a greater antipathy towards these \"wild men\" than I did; I lived years in their vicinity and yet contrived to avoid all contact with them, and it was not till I was homeward-bound that my conversion was effected. The ship in which Mr. Bowdich and myself took a round-about course to England, was floating on a wide expanse of water, disturbed only by the heavy swell, which forms the sole motion in a calm; the watch on deck were seated near the bows of the vessel, the passengers and officers were almost all below, there was only myself and the helmsman on the after-deck; he stood listlessly by the binnacle, and I was wholly occupied in reading. A noise between a squeak and a chatter suddenly met my ears; and before I could turn my head to see whence it proceeded, a heavy, living creature jumped on to my shoulders from behind, and its tail encircled my throat. I felt it was Jack, the cook's monkey; the mischievous, malicious, mocking, but inimitable Jack, whose pranks had often made me laugh against my will, as I watched him from a distance, but with whom I had never made the least acquaintance. Whether from fear or presence of mind I do not pretend to say, but I remained perfectly still, and in a minute or two Jack put his head forward and stared me in the face, uttering a sort of croak; he then descended on to my knees, examined my hands as if he were counting my fingers, tried to take off my rings, and when I gave him some biscuit, curled himself compactly into my lap. We were friends from that moment. My aversion thus cured, I have ever since felt indescribable interest and entertainment in watching, studying, and protecting monkeys. We had several on board the above-mentioned vessel, but Jack was the prince of them all.  Exclusively belonging to the cook, although a favourite with the whole crew, my friend (a Cercopithecus from Senegal) had been at first kept by means of a cord, attached to the caboose; but, as he became more and more tame, his liberty was extended, till at last he was allowed the whole range of the ship, with the exception of the captain's and passengers' cabins. The occupations which he marked out for himself began at early dawn, by overturning the steward's parrot-cage whenever he could get at it, in order to secure the lump of sugar which then rolled out, or lick up the water which ran from the upset cup; he evidently intended to pull the parrot's feathers, but the latter, by turning round as fast as Jack turned, always faced him, and his beak was too formidable to be encountered. I was frequently awakened by the quick trampling of feet at this early hour, and knew it arose from a pursuit of Jack, in consequence of some mischief on his part. Like all other nautical monkeys, he descended into the forecastle, where he twisted off the night-caps of the sailors as they lay in their hammocks, stole their knives, tools, etc., and if they were not very active in the pursuit, these purloinings were thrown"]]]
