The improvement in the River-Smithites' team became a topic of conversation in the college, and there were rumours that they had put themselves into regular training, and that some one had seen them come in in a body at seven in the morning after having been for a run. The challenge cup matches were now at hand, and as it happened they were drawn to meet the Greenites, and the match was regarded with special interest throughout the school. The rivalry between the two houses was notorious, and although the Greenites scoffed at the idea of their being defeated by a team they had before so easily beaten, the great improvement the latter had made gave promise that the struggle would be an exceptionally severe one. Skinner had for some days before looked after the team with extreme vigilance, scarcely letting one of them out of his sight, lest they might eat forbidden things, or in other ways transgress the rules laid down.  \"We may not win,\" he admitted, as they talked over the prospect on the evening before the match, \"but at any rate they will have all their work cut out to beat us. I know they are very confident, and of course their weight is tremendously in their favour. Now, mind, we must press them as hard as we can for the first half the game, and never leave them for a single moment. They are sure to get savage when they find they have not got it all their own way, and that will help to pump them. We shall have more left in us the second half than they will, and then will be our chance.\"  These tactics were followed out, and from the first the game was played with exceptional spirit on both sides; and as the Greenites failed, even by the most determined rushes, to carry the ball into their opponents' goal, the game became, as Skinner had predicted, more and more savage.  The sympathies of the school were for the most part with River-Smith's, and the loud shouts of applause and encouragement with which their gallant defence of their goal was greeted, added to the irritation of the Greenites. When the half-play was called neither party had scored a point, and as they changed sides it was evident that the tremendous pace had told upon both parties.  \"Now is our time,\" Skinner said to his team; \"they are more done than we are, and our training will tell more and more every minute. Keep it up hard, and when we see a chance make a big rush and carry it down to their end.\"  But the Greenites were equally determined, and in spite of the efforts of their opponents, kept the ball at their end of the field. Then Skinner got it and made a rush. One of the heaviest of the Greenites charged down upon them at full speed, but was encountered by Easton before he reached him, and the two rolled over together. The River-Smithites backed up their leader well, and he was more than half-way down the ground before the Greenites had arrested his progress. Then there was a close scrimmage, and for a time the mass swayed backwards and forwards. But here weight counted for more than wind, and the Greenites were pushing their opponents back when the ball rolled out from the mass.  Edgar Clinton picked it up, and was off with it in a moment, dodging through those who attempted to check his course. He was down near the Greenites' goal before two of them threw themselves upon him together; but his friends were close behind, and after a desperate scrimmage the ball was driven behind the Greenite goal. Some loose play followed, and a Greenite who had the ball threw it forward to one of his own team, who caught it and started running. The River-Smithites shouted \"Dead ball!\" \"Dead ball!\" and claimed the point; but the holder of the ball, without heeding the shouts, ran right through followed by the rest of his team, and touched down behind the River-Smith goal. The ball was then brought out and a goal kicked. All this time the River-Smithites had not moved from behind the Greenite goal, but had remained there awaiting the result of their appeal to the umpire, who now at once decided in their favour. Not satisfied with this the Greenites appealed to the referee, who confirmed the decision of the umpire. Too angry to be reasonable, the captain refused to continue the game, and called upon his team to leave the field. They were going, when the derisive shouts of the lookers-on caused them again to alter their intentions, and the game was renewed.  There were ten minutes yet remaining, and for that time the game was played with a fury that caused it to be long memorable in the annals of Cheltenham football. But weight and strength could not prevail over the superior last and coolness of the defenders of the River-Smith goal. Every attempt was beaten off, every rush met, and as no point had been added to the score when time was called, the umpire decided that the game had been won by the River-Smithites by one touch down to nothing. The captain of the Greenites appealed from the umpire's and referee's decision to the football committee of the college, who gave it against him, and he then appealed to the Rugby Union, who decided that the umpire's decision was perfectly right, and the victory thus remained beyond further contention with the River-Smithites.     CHAPTER III.  GONE.   \"Bravo, Clinton! Well done, indeed!\" so shouted one of the big boys, and a score of others joined in in chorus.  \"Which is Clinton?\" a woman who was standing looking on at the game asked one of the younger boys.  The boy looked up at the questioner. She was a woman of about forty years old, quietly dressed in black with a gloss of newness on it.  \"I will point him out to you directly. They are all mixed up again now.\"  \"There are two of them, are there not?\" the woman asked.  \"Yes, that's the other; there--that one who has just picked up the ball and is running with it; there, that's the other, the one who is just charging the fellow who is trying to stop his brother.\"  \"Well done!\" he shouted, as Edgar's opponent rolled over.  The woman asked no more questions until the match was over, but stood looking on intently as the players came off the ground. Rupert and Edgar were together, laughing and talking in high spirits; for each had kicked a goal, and the town boys had been beaten by four goals to one. The boy to whom she had been speaking had long before strolled away to another part of the field, but she turned to another as the Clintons approached.  \"Those are the Clintons, are they not?\" she asked.  \"Yes, and a good sort they are,\" the boy said heartily.  She stood looking at them intently until they had passed her, then walked away with her eyes bent on the ground, and made her way to a small lodging she had taken in the town. For several days she placed herself so that she could see the boys on their way to and fro between River-Smith's and the college, and watched them at football.  \"I wonder who that woman is,\" Rupert said one day to his brother. \"I constantly see her about, and she always seems to be staring at me.\"  \"I thought she stared at me too,\" Edgar said. \"I am sure I do not know her. I don't think I have ever seen her face before.\"  \"She asked me whether you were Clinton the other day when you were playing football. It was just after you had made a run with the ball, and some one shouted, 'Well done, Clinton!' And she asked me which was Clinton, and whether there were not two of them. And of course I pointed you both out,\" a youngster said who was walking with them.  \"That is rum, too,\" Rupert said. \"I wonder who the woman is, Edgar, and what interest she can have in us.\"  \"If she has any interest, Rupert, I suppose she will stop staring some day and speak. Perhaps it is some old servant, though I don't remember her. Well, it is no odds any way.\"  Jane Humphreys was much puzzled as to what step she should take first. During all these years she had waited she had always expected that she should have known which was her own child as soon as she set eyes on the boys, and was surprised and disappointed to find that even after a week's stay at Cheltenham, and examining their faces as closely as she could, she had not the slightest idea which was which. She had imagined that she should not only know, but feel an affection for the boy who was her own, and she had fully intended to place him in the position of Captain Clinton's heir, trusting to receive the promise of a large sum from him when he should come into possession.  Now it seemed to her that she cared no more for one than for the other, and that her best plan therefore was to place in the position of heir whichever of them was most likely to suit her purpose. But here, again, she was in a difficulty. If they resembled each other in no other point, they both looked thoroughly manly, straightforward, and honest lads, neither of whom would be likely to entertain any dishonourable proposition. Her intention had been to say to her son, \"You are not really the twin brother, as you suppose, of the other. Captain and Mrs. Clinton do not know which of you two is their child.\" She wondered whether they already knew as much as that. Probably they did. So many people had known of that affair at Agra, that Captain Clinton had probably told them himself. She would tell the boy, \"I am the only person in the world who can clear up the mystery. I have the key to it in my hand, and can place either you or the other in the position of sole heir to the estate. I shall expect to be paid a handsome sum from the one I put into possession. Remember, on one hand I can give you a splendid property, on the other I can show you to have been from the first a usurper of things you had no right to--an interloper and a fraud.\"  It had seemed to her a simple matter before she came down to Cheltenham. Surely no boy in his senses would hesitate a moment in accepting her offer. It had always been a fixed thing in her mind that this would be so, but now she felt that it was not so certain as she before imagined. She "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21986"],["title","The Dash for Khartoum: A Tale of the Nile Expedition (#8)"],["body","whether she should not defer it until the boys came of age, and the one she chose could sign a legal document; but she was anxious to leave England, and go right away to America or Australia. Besides, if she had the promise she could enforce its fulfilment. Which boy should she select? She changed her mind several times, and at last determined that she would leave it to chance, and would choose the one whom she next met.  It chanced that Edgar was the first she encountered after having taken this resolution, and it happened that he was walking by himself, having remained in the class-room a few minutes after the rest of the boys had left, to speak to the master respecting a difficult passage in a lesson. The woman placed herself in his way.  \"Well, what is it?\" he said. \"You have been hanging about for the last week. What is it you want?\"  \"I want to speak to you about something very important.\"  \"Oh, nonsense!\" he said. \"There is nothing important you can have to tell me.\"  \"Yes, there is; something of the greatest importance. You do not suppose that I should have been here for a week waiting to tell it to you, if it was not.\"  \"Well, I suppose you think it important,\" he said; \"so fire away.\"  \"I cannot tell you now,\" she said; \"it is too long a story. Could you spare me half an hour, young sir? You will not be sorry for it afterwards, I promise you.\"  Edgar looked impatiently at his watch. He had nothing particular to do at the moment, and his curiosity was excited. \"I can spare it you now,\" he said.  \"I am staying at this address,\" she said, handing him a piece of paper. \"It is not five minutes' walk from here. I will go on, if you will follow me.\"  \"All right,\" Edgar said, looking at the paper; \"though I expect it is some fooling or other.\" She walked away rapidly, and he sauntered after her. She was standing with the door open when he arrived, and he followed her into a small parlour. He threw himself down into a chair.  \"Now, fire away,\" he said; \"and be as quick as you can.\"  \"Before I begin,\" she said quietly, \"will you tell me if you know anything relating to the circumstances of your birth?\"  [Illustration: \"THE WOMAN PLACED HERSELF IN HIS WAY.\"]  He looked at her in astonishment. \"No,\" he said. \"What in the world should I know about the circumstances of my birth?\"  \"You know that you were born at Agra in India?\"  \"Of course I know that.\"  \"And your father, Captain Clinton, has never spoken to you about the circumstances?\"  Edgar shook his head. \"No; I only know that I was born there.\"  \"I should have thought that he would have told you the story,\" she said; \"for there were many knew of it, and you would be sure to hear it sooner or later.\"  \"I do not want to hear of it,\" he said, leaping to his feet. \"If there was anything my father wanted me to know he would tell it to me at once. You do not suppose I want to hear it from anyone else?\"  He was making for the door, when she said, \"Then you do not know that you are not his son?\"  He stopped abruptly. \"Don't know I am not his son!\" he repeated. \"You must be mad.\"  \"I am not mad at all,\" she said. \"You are not his son. Not any relation in the world to him. Sit down again and I will tell you the story.\"  He mechanically obeyed, feeling overwhelmed with the news he had heard. Then as she told him how the children had become mixed, and how Captain Clinton had decided to bring them up together until he should be able to discover by some likeness to himself or wife which was his son, Edgar listened to the story with a terrible feeling of oppression stealing over him. He could not doubt that she was speaking the truth, for if it were false it could be contradicted at once. There were circumstances too which seemed to confirm it. He recalled now, that often in their younger days his father and mother had asked casual visitors if they saw any likeness between either of the children to them; and he specially remembered how closely Colonel Winterbottom, who had been major in his father's regiment, had scrutinized them both, and how he had said, \"No, Clinton, for the life of me I cannot see that one is more like you and your wife than the other.\" And now this woman had told him that he was not their son; and he understood that she must be this sergeant's wife, and that if he was not Captain Clinton's son she must be his mother.  \"You are Mrs. Humphreys, I suppose?\" he said in a hard, dry voice when she had ceased speaking.  \"I am your mother,\" she said. He moved as if struck with sudden pain as she spoke, but said nothing.  \"I sacrificed myself for your sake,\" she went on after a pause. \"I had them both, and it seemed to me hard that my boy should grow up to be a boy of the regiment, with nothing better to look forward to than to enlist in it some day, while the other, no better in any respect than him, should grow up to be a rich man, with everything the heart could desire, and I determined that he should have an equal chance with the other. I knew that perhaps some day they might find out which was which by a likeness, but that was not certain, and at any rate you would get a good education and be well brought up, and you were sure to be provided for, and when the time should come, if there was still doubt, I could give you the chance of either having the half or all just as you chose. It was terrible for me to give you up altogether, but I did it for your good. I suffered horribly, and the women of the regiment turned against me. Your father treated me badly, and I had to leave him and come home to England. But my comfort has all along been that I had succeeded; that you were being brought up as a gentleman, and were happy and well cared for.\"  Edgar sat silent for some time. \"How do you know,\" he asked suddenly, \"that it is Rupert and not I who is the real son?\"  \"One of the infants,\" she said, \"had a tiny mole no bigger than a pin's head on his shoulder, and I was sure that I would always know them apart from that.\"  \"Yes, Rupert has a mark like that,\" Edgar admitted, for he had noticed it only a short time before.  \"Yes,\" the woman said quietly. \"Mrs. Clinton's child had that mark. It was very, very small and scarcely noticeable, but as I washed and dressed them when babies, I noticed it.\"  \"Well, what next?\" Edgar asked roughly.  \"As I said, my boy,\"--Edgar winced as she spoke--\"it is for you to choose whether you will have half or all the property. If I hold my tongue you will go on as you are now, and they will never know which is their son. If you like to have it all, to be the heir of that grand place and everything else, I have only to go and say that my boy had a mole on his shoulder. There is nothing I would not do to make you happy.\"  \"And I suppose,\" Edgar said quietly, \"you will want some money for yourself?\"  \"I do not wish to make any bargain, if that is what you mean,\" she said in an indignant tone. \"I know, of course, that you can give me no money now. I suppose that in either case you would wish to help a mother who has done so much for you. I don't expect gratitude at present. Naturally you are upset about what I have told you. Some day when you grow to be a man you will appreciate better than you can now what I have done for you, and what you have gained by it.\"  Edgar sat silent for a minute or two, and then he rose quietly and said, \"I will think it all over. You shall have my answer in a day or two,\" and without another word left the room and sauntered off.  \"What is the matter, Edgar?\" Rupert asked two hours later. \"I have been looking for you everywhere, and young Johnson has only just said that you told him to tell me you were feeling very seedy, and were going to lie down for a bit.\"  \"I have got a frightful headache, Rupert,\" Edgar, who was lying with his face to the wall, said. \"I am too bad to talk, old fellow; let me alone. I daresay I shall be all right when I have had a night's sleep. Tell River-Smith, will you, that I am seedy, and cannot come down to tea. I do not want the doctor or anything of that sort, but if I am not all right in the morning, I will see him.\"  Rupert went out quietly. It was something new Edgar's being like this, he never remembered him having a bad headache before. \"I expect,\" he said to himself, \"he got hurt in one of those scrimmages yesterday, although he did not say anything about it. I do hope that he is not going to be ill. The examinations are on next week, it will be a frightful nuisance for him to miss them.\" He went into Edgar's dormitory again the last thing. He opened the door very quietly in case he should be asleep.  \"I am not asleep,\" Edgar said; \"I am rather better now. Good-night, Rupert,\" and he held out his hand. Rupert was surprised at the action, but took his hand and pressed it.  \"Good-night, Edgar. I do hope that you will be all right in the morning.\"  \"Good-night, old fellow. God bless you!\" and there was almost a sob in the lad's voice.  Rupert went out surprised and uneasy. \"Edgar must be worse than he says,\" he thought to himself. \"It is rum of him saying good-night in that way. I have never known him do such a thing before. I wish now that I had asked River-Smith to send round for the doctor. I daresay Edgar would not have liked it, but it would have been best; but he seemed so anxious to be quiet and get off to sleep, that I did not think of it.\"  The first thing in the morning Rupert went to his brother's dormitory to see how he was. He tapped at the door, but there was no answer. Thinking that his brother was asleep, he turned the handle and went in. An exclamation of surprise broke from him. Edgar was not there and the bed had not been slept in, but was just as he had seen it when Edgar was lying on the outside. On the table was a letter directed to himself. He tore it open.  \"My dear Rupert,\" it began, \"a horrible thing has happened, and I shall be off to-night. I have learned that I am not your brother at all, but that I was fraudulently put in that"]]]
