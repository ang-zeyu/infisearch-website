They set out together, and when his companion was fatigued with walking, Grasshopper would put him forward on his journey a mile or two by giving him a cast in the air, and lighting him in a soft place among the trees, or in a cool spot in a water-pond, among the sedges and water-lilies. At other times he would lighten the way by showing off a few tricks, such as leaping over trees, and turning round on one leg till he made the dust fly; at which the pipe-bearer was mightily pleased, although it sometimes happened that the character of these gambols frightened him. For Grasshopper would, without the least hint of such an intention, jump into the air far ahead, and it would cost the little pipe-bearer half a day's hard travel to come up with him; and then the dust Grasshopper raised was often so thick and heavy as to completely bury the poor little pipe-bearer, and compel Grasshopper to dig diligently and with might and main to get him out alive.  One day they came to a very large village, where they were well received. After staying in it some time (in the course of which Grasshopper, in a fit of abstraction, walked straight through the sides of three lodges without stopping to look for the door), they were informed of a number of wicked spirits, who lived at a distance, and who made it a practice to kill all who came to their lodge. Attempts had been made to destroy them, but they had always proved more than a match for such as had come out against them.  Grasshopper determined to pay them a visit, although he was strongly advised not to do so. The chief of the village warned him of the great danger he would incur, but finding Grasshopper resolved, he said:  \"Well, if you will go, being my guest, I will send twenty warriors to serve you.\"  Grasshopper thanked him for the offer, although he suggested that he thought he could get along without them, at which the little pipe-bearer grinned, for his master had never shown in that village what he could do, and the chief thought that Grasshopper, being little himself, would be likely to need twenty warriors, at the least, to encounter the wicked spirits with any chance of success. Twenty young men made their appearance. They set forward, and after about a day's journey they descried the lodge of the Manitoes.  Grasshopper placed his friend, the pipe-bearer, and the warriors, near enough to see all that passed, while he went alone to the lodge.  As he entered, Grasshopper saw five horrid-looking Manitoes in the act of eating. It was the father and his four sons. They were really hideous to look upon. Their eyes were swimming low in their heads, and they glared about as if they were half starved. They offered Grasshopper something to eat, which he politely refused, for he had a strong suspicion that it was the thigh-bone of a man.  \"What have you come for?\" said the old one.  \"Nothing,\" answered Grasshopper; \"where is your uncle?\"  They all stared at him, and answered:  \"We ate him, yesterday. What do you want?\"  \"Nothing,\" said Grasshopper; \"where is your grandfather?\"  They all answered, with another broad stare:  \"We ate him a week ago. Do you not wish to wrestle?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Grasshopper, \"I don't mind if I do take a turn; but you must be easy with me, for you see I am very little.\"  Pipe-bearer, who stood near enough to overhear the conversation, grinned from ear to ear when he caught this remark. The Manitoes answered:  \"Oh yes, we will be easy with you.\"  And as they said this they looked at each other, and rolled their eyes about in a dreadful manner. A hideous smile came over their faces as they whispered among themselves:  \"It's a pity he's so thin. You go,\" they said to the eldest brother.  The two got ready--the Manito and Grasshopper--and they were soon clinched in each other's arms for a deadly throw. Grasshopper knew their object--his death; they wanted a taste of his delicate little body, and he was determined they should have it, perhaps in a different sense from that they intended.  \"Haw! haw!\" they cried, and soon the dust and dry leaves flew about as if driven by a strong wind. The Manito was strong, but Grasshopper thought he could master him; and all at once giving him a sly trip, as the wicked spirit was trying to finish his breakfast with a piece out of his shoulder, he sent the Manito head-foremost against a stone; and, calling aloud to the three others, he bade them come and take the body away.  The brothers now stepped forth in quick succession, but Grasshopper having got his blood up, and limbered himself by exercise, soon dispatched the three--sending one this way, another that, and the third straight up into the air, so high that he never came down again.  It was time for the old Manito to be frightened, and dreadfully frightened he got, and ran for his life, which was the very worst thing he could have done; for Grasshopper, of all his gifts of strength, was most noted for his speed of foot. The old Manito set off, and for mere sport's sake, Grasshopper pursued him. Sometimes he was before the wicked old spirit, sometimes he was flying over his head, and then he would keep along at a steady trot just at his heels, till he had blown all the breath out of the old knave's body.  Meantime his friend, the pipe-bearer, and the twenty young warriors, cried out:  \"Ha, ha, ah! ha, ha, ah! Grasshopper is driving him before him!\"  The Manito only turned his head now and then to look back. At length, when he was tired of the sport, to be rid of him, Grasshopper, with a gentle application of his foot, sent the wicked old Manito whirling away through the air, in which he made a great number of the most curious turn-overs in the world, till he came to alight, when it so happened that he fell astride of an old bull-buffalo, grazing in a distant pasture, who straightway set off with him at a long gallop, and the old Manito has not been heard of to this day.  The warriors and the pipe-bearer and Grasshopper set to work and burned down the lodge of the wicked spirits, and then when they came to look about, they saw that the ground was strewn on all sides with human bones bleaching in the sun; these were the unhappy victims of the Manitoes. Grasshopper then took three arrows from his girdle, and after having performed a ceremony to the Great Spirit, he shot one into the air, crying, \"You are lying down; rise up, or you will be hit!\"  The bones all moved to one place. He shot the second arrow, repeating the same words, when each bone drew toward its fellow-bone; the third arrow brought forth to life the whole multitude of people who had been killed by the Manitoes. Grasshopper conducted the crowd to the chief of the village, who had proved his friend, and gave them into his hands. The chief was there with his counselors, to whom he spoke apart.  \"Who is more worthy,\" said the chief to Grasshopper, \"to rule than you. _You_ alone can defend them.\"  Grasshopper thanked him, and told him that he was in search of more adventures. \"I have done some things,\" said little Grasshopper, rather boastfully, \"and I think I can do some more.\"  The chief still urged him, but he was eager to go, and naming pipe-bearer to tarry and take his place, he set out again on his travels, promising that he would some time or other come back and see them.  \"Ho! ho! ho!\" they all cried. \"Come back again and see us!\" He renewed his promise that he would; and then set out alone.  After traveling some time he came to a great lake, and on looking about he discovered a very large otter on an island. He thought to himself, \"His skin will make me a fine pouch.\" And he immediately drew up at long shots, and drove an arrow into his side. He waded into the lake, and with some difficulty dragged him ashore, and up a hill overlooking the lake.  As soon as Grasshopper got the otter into the sunshine where it was warm, he skinned him, and threw the carcass some distance off, thinking the war-eagle would come, and that he should have a chance to secure his feathers as ornaments for the head; for Grasshopper began to be proud, and was disposed to display himself.  He soon heard a rushing noise as of a loud wind, but could see nothing. Presently a large eagle dropped, as if from the air, upon the otter's carcass. Grasshopper drew his bow, and the arrow passed through under both of his wings. The bird made a convulsive flight upward, with such force that the cumbrous body was borne up several feet from the ground; but with its claws deeply fixed, the heavy otter brought the eagle back to the earth. Grasshopper possessed himself of a handful of the prime feathers, crowned his head with the trophy, and set off in high spirits on the look out for something new.  After walking awhile, he came to a body of water which flooded the trees on its banks--it was a lake made by beavers. Taking his station on the raised dam where the stream escaped, he watched to see whether any of the beavers would show themselves. A head presently peeped out of the water to see who it was that disturbed them.  \"My friend,\" said Grasshopper, in his most persuasive manner, \"could you not oblige me by turning me into a beaver like yourself. Nothing would please me so much as to make your acquaintance, I can assure you;\" for Grasshopper was curious to know how these watery creatures lived, and what kind of notions they had.  \"I do not know,\" replied the beaver, who was rather short-nosed and surly. \"I will go and ask the others. Meanwhile stay where you are, if you please.\"  \"To be sure,\" answered Grasshopper, stealing down the bank several paces as soon as the beaver's back was turned.  Presently there was a great splashing of the water, and all the beavers showed their heads, and looked warily to where he stood, to see if he was armed; but he had knowingly left his bow and arrows in a hollow tree at a short distance.  After a long conversation, which they conducted in a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22248"],["title","The Indian Fairy Book: From the Original Legends (#5)"],["body","so that Grasshopper could not catch a word, strain his ears as he would, they all advanced in a body toward the spot where he stood; the chief approaching the nearest, and lifting his head highest out of the water.  \"Can you not,\" said Grasshopper, noticing that they waited for him to speak first, \"turn me into a beaver? I wish to live among you.\"  \"Yes,\" answered their chief; \"lie down.\" And Grasshopper in a moment found himself a beaver, and was gliding into the water, when a thought seemed to strike him, and he paused at the edge of the lake. \"I am very small,\" he said, to the beaver, in a sorrowful tone. \"You must make me large,\" he said; for Grasshopper was terribly ambitious, and wanted always to be the first person in every company. \"Larger than any of you; in my present size it's hardly worth my while to go into the water.\"  \"Yes, yes!\" said they. \"By and by, when we get into the lodge it shall be done.\"  They all dived into the lake, and in passing great heaps of limbs and logs at the bottom, he asked the use of them; they answered, \"It is for our winter's provisions.\"  When they all got into the lodge their number was about one hundred. The lodge was large and warm.  \"Now we will make you large,\" said they. \"Will _that_ do?\"  \"Yes,\" he answered; for he found that he was ten times the size of the largest.  \"You need not go out,\" said the others; \"we will bring you food into the lodge, and you will be our chief.\"  \"Very well,\" Grasshopper answered. He thought, \"I will stay here and grow fat at their expense.\" But, soon after, one ran into the lodge, out of breath, crying out, \"We are visited by the Indians!\"  All huddled together in great fear. The water began to lower, for the hunters had broken down the dam, and they soon heard them on the roof of the lodge, breaking it up. Out jumped all the beavers into the water, and so escaped.  Grasshopper tried to follow them; but, unfortunately, to gratify his ambition, they had made him so large that he could not creep out at the hole. He tried to call them back, but either they did not hear or would not attend to him; he worried himself so much in searching for a door to let him out, that he looked like a great bladder, swollen and blistering in the sun, and the sweat stood out upon his forehead in knobs and huge bubbles.  Although he heard and understood every word that the hunters spoke--and some of their expressions suggested terrible ideas--he could not turn himself back into a man. He had chosen to be a beaver, and a beaver he must be. One of the hunters, a prying little man, with a single lock dangling over one eye--this inquisitive little fellow put his head in at the top of the lodge. \"_Ty-au!_\" cried he. \"_Tut ty-au!_ Me-shau-mik--king of beavers is in.\" Whereupon the whole crowd of hunters began upon him with their clubs, and knocked his scull about until it was no harder than a morass in the middle of summer. Grasshopper thought as well as ever he did, although he was a beaver; and he felt that he was in a rather foolish scrape, inhabiting the carcass of a beaver.  Presently seven or eight of the hunters hoisted his body upon long poles, and marched away home with him. As they went, he reflected in this manner: \"What will become of me? My ghost or shadow will not die after they get me to their lodges.\"  Invitations were immediately sent out for a grand feast; but as soon as his body got cold, his soul being uncomfortable in a house without heat, flew off.  Having reassumed his mortal shape, Grasshopper found himself standing near a prairie. After walking a distance, he saw a herd of elk feeding. He admired their apparent ease and enjoyment of life, and thought there could be nothing more pleasant than the liberty of running about and feeding on the prairies. He had been a water animal and now he wished to become a land animal, to learn what passed in an elk's head as he roved about. He asked them if they could not turn him into one of themselves.  \"Yes,\" they answered, after a pause. \"Get down on your hands and feet.\"  He obeyed their directions, and forthwith found himself to be an elk.  \"I want big horns, big feet,\" said he; \"I wish to be very large;\" for all the conceit and vain-glory had not been knocked out of Grasshopper, even by the sturdy thwacks of the hunters' clubs.  \"Yes, yes,\" they answered. \"There,\" exerting their power, \"are you big enough?\"  \"That will do,\" he replied; for, looking into a lake hard by, Grasshopper saw that he was very large. They spent their time in grazing and running to and fro; but what astonished Grasshopper, although he often lifted up his head and directed his eyes that way, he could never see the stars, which he had so admired as a human being.  Being rather cold, one day, Grasshopper went into a thick wood for shelter, whither he was followed by most of the herd. They had not been long there when some elks from behind passed the others like a strong wind, calling out:  \"The hunters are after us!\"  All took the alarm, and off they ran, Grasshopper with the rest.  \"Keep out on the plains,\" they said. But it was too late to profit by this advice, for they had already got entangled in the thick woods. Grasshopper soon scented the hunters, who were closely following his trail for they had left all the others and were making after him in full cry. He jumped furiously, dashed through the underwood, and broke down whole groves of saplings in his flight. But this only made it the harder for him to get on, such a huge and lusty elk was he by his own request.  Presently, as he dashed past an open space, he felt an arrow in his side. They could not well miss it, he presented so wide a mark to the shot. He bounded over trees under the smart, but the shafts clattered thicker and thicker at his ribs, and at last one entered his heart. He fell to the ground, and heard the whoop of triumph sounded by the hunters. On coming up, they looked on the carcass with astonishment, and with their hands up to their mouths, exclaimed: \"_Ty-au! ty-au!_\"  There were about sixty in the party, who had come out on a special hunt, as one of their number had, the day before, observed his large tracks on the plains. When they had skinned him his flesh grew cold, and his spirit took its flight from the dead body, and Grasshopper found himself in human shape, with a bow and arrows.  But his passion for adventure was not yet cooled; for on coming to a large lake with a sandy beach, he saw a large flock of brant, and speaking to them in the brant language, he requested them to make a brant of him.  \"Yes,\" they replied, at once; for the brant is a bird of a very obliging disposition.  \"But I want to be very large,\" he said. There was no end to the ambition of little Grasshopper.  \"Very well,\" they answered; and he soon found himself a large brant, all the others standing gazing in astonishment at his great size.  \"You must fly as leader,\" they said.  \"No,\" answered Grasshopper; \"I will fly behind.\"  \"Very well,\" rejoined the brant; \"one thing more we have to say to you, brother Grasshopper\" (for he had told them his name). \"You must be careful, in flying, not to look down, for something may happen to you.\"  \"Well, it is so,\" said he; and soon the flock rose up into the air, for they were bound north. They flew very fast--he behind. One day, while going with a strong wind, and as swift as their wings could flap, as they passed over a large village the Indians raised a great shout on seeing them, particularly on Grasshopper's account, for his wings were broader than two large mats. The village people made such a frightful noise that he forgot what had been told him about looking down. They were now scudding along as swift as arrows; and as soon as he brought his neck in and stretched it down to look at the shouters, his huge tail was caught by the wind, and over and over he was blown. He tried to right himself, but without success, for he had no sooner got out of one heavy air-current than he fell into another, which treated him even more rudely than that he had escaped from. Down, down he went, making more turns than he wished for, from a height of several miles.  The first moment he had to look about him, Grasshopper, in the shape of a big brant, was aware that he was jammed into a large hollow tree. To get backward or forward was out of the question, and there, in spite of himself, was Grasshopper forced to tarry till his brant life was ended by starvation, when, his spirit being at liberty, he was once more a human being.  As he journeyed on in search of further adventures, Grasshopper came to a lodge in which were two old men, with heads white from extreme age. They were very fine old men to look at. There was such sweetness and innocence in their features that Grasshopper would have enjoyed himself very much at their lodge, if he had had no other entertainment than such as the gazing upon the serene and happy faces of the two innocent old men with heads white from extreme age afforded.  They treated him well, and he made known to them that he was going back to his village, his friends and people, whereupon the two white-headed old men very heartily wished him a good journey and abundance of comfort in seeing his friends once more. They even arose, old and infirm as they were, and tottering with exceeding difficulty to the door, were at great pains to point out to him the exact course he should take; and they called his attention to the circumstance that it was much shorter and more direct than he would have taken himself. Ah! what merry deceivers were these two old men with very white heads.  Grasshopper, with blessings showered on him until he was fairly out of sight, set forth with good heart. He thought he heard loud laughter resounding after him in the direction of the lodge of the two old men; but it could not have been the two old men, for they were, certainly, too old to laugh.  He walked briskly all day, and at night he had the"]]]
