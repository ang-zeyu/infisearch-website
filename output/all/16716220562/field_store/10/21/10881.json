And if he goes within, he will see on     either side buildings decorated with stone and wainscoted with     wood of various colours. And if he goes yet farther into the     courtyard he will behold lofty palaces and churches, bedecked     with countless stones and wood and frescoes without, and with     marble and copper and silver and gold within. Such grandeur he     has never seen before, for in his own land there are only     miserable huts of straw. Beside himself with astonishment, he     will scarce believe his eyes. But if he perchance espy the     prince sitting in his robe covered with pearls, with a chain of     coins round his neck and bracelets on his wrists, girt about     with a purple girdle and a sword of gold at his side, while on     either hand his nobles are seated with golden chains, girdles,     and bracelets upon them; then will he answer when one asks him     on his return home what he has seen: \"I know not how to     describe it; only thine own eyes could comprehend such     splendour.\"  Under Simeon, art and literature flourished (in a Middle Ages sense) in Bulgaria; the Cyrillic alphabet--still used in Russia, Bulgaria, and Servia--had supplanted the Greek alphabet and had added to the growing sense of national consciousness. Simeon encouraged the production of books, and tradition credits him with having himself translated into the Slav language some of the writings of St. Chrysostom.  [Illustration: A WEDDING IN THE RHODOPES]  But all this Bulgarian prosperity had a serious check when Simeon died in 927 and the Czar Peter ascended the throne. Scarcely was Simeon cold in his grave before internal struggles had begun, owing to the jealousies of some of the nobles and their spirit of adventure. The boyars (knights) of Bulgaria had always had great authority. Now they took advantage of a monarch who was more suited for the cloister than the Court to revive old pretensions to independent power. Czar Peter turned to the Greek Empire for help, and sought to strengthen his position at home by a marriage with the grand-daughter of the Emperor Romanus Lecapenus. That policy served until a vigorous Greek Emperor came to the throne at Constantinople and set himself to avenge the victories of Simeon. The Greek Emperor called in the aid of the northern Russians against their kinsfolk the Bulgarian Slavs. There followed a typical Balkan year of war. The Russians succeeded only too well against the Bulgarians, and then the Greeks, in fear, joined with the Bulgarians to resist their further progress. Then the Servians took advantage of the war to shake off the Bulgarian suzerainty and regain their independence. An opposition party in Bulgaria, disgusted with the misfortunes which had befallen their country under Peter, added to these misfortunes by a revolt, and seceded to found the kingdom of Western Bulgaria under the boyar Shishman Mokar (963). To add to the troubles of the Balkans, the Bogomil heresy appeared, dividing further the strength of the Bulgarian nation. The Bogomils were the first of a long series of Slavonic fanatics, ancestors in spirit of the Doukhobors, the Stundists, and the Tolstoyans of our days, preaching the hermit life as the only truly holy one, forbidding marriage as well as war and the eating of meat. It was with such dissensions among the Christian states of the Balkans that the way was prepared for the coming of the Turk to the Peninsula.  In 969 Boris II. followed Peter on the Bulgarian throne. He was faced by a new Russian invasion and by an attack from Czar David of Western Bulgaria. This latter attack he beat off, but was overwhelmed before the tide of Russian invasion and himself captured in battle. The Russians passed over Bulgaria to attack Constantinople, and that brought the Greeks into line with the Bulgarians to resist the invader. The Emperor John Zemissius made bold war upon the Russians, and captured from them their Bulgarian prisoner, the Czar Boris II. The Greek Emperor made no magnanimous use of his victory. He deposed the Bulgarian Czar and the Bulgarian Patriarch, emasculated the Czar's brother, and turned Bulgaria into a Greek province. Only in the rebel province of West Bulgaria did Bulgarian independence at this time survive, and from that province there arose in time a deliverer, the Czar Samuel, who was the fourth son of that boyar Shishman who founded the Western Bulgarian kingdom. At the beginning of his reign, in 976, Samuel had control only over the territory which is now known as Macedonia, but soon he united to it all the old Empire of Bulgaria, and stretched the sway of his race over much of the land which is now comprised in Albania, Greece, and Servia. He began, then, a stern war with the Greek Emperor, Basil II., known to history as \"the Bulgar-slayer,\" against whom is alleged a cruelty horrible even for the Balkans.  Capturing a Bulgarian army of over 10,000 men, Basil II. had all the soldiers blinded, leaving to each of their centurions, however, one eye, so that the mutilated men might be led back to their own country. A realistically horrible picture in the Sofia National Gallery commemorates this classic horror.  The war between the Czar Samuel and the Emperor Basil II. was marked by fluctuating fortunes. At first the Bulgarians were altogether successful, and in 981 Basil was so completely defeated that for fifteen years he was obliged to leave Samuel as the real master of the Balkan Peninsula. Then the tide turned. Near Thermopylae, Samuel was decisively defeated by the Greeks, and soon after found his Empire reduced to the dimensions of Albania and West Macedonia. War troubles that the Greeks had with Asia brought to the Czar Samuel a brief respite, but a campaign in 1014--this was the one marked by the blinding of the captive Bulgarian army--shattered finally his power. He died that year heart-broken, it is said, at the sight of the return of his blinded army.  Thus, to quote a Bulgarian chronicle:      In 1015 Bulgaria was brought to subjection. A new state of     things began for the Bulgarians, who till then had never felt     the control of an enemy. The people longed for liberty, and     there were many attempts at revolt. Towards 1186, two brothers,     John and Peter Assen, raised a revolt and succeeded in     re-establishing the ancient kingdom, choosing as capital     Tirnova, their native town. It was then that Tirnova became what     it still remains, the historic town of Bulgaria. The reign of     John and Peter Assen was a brilliant time for Bulgaria. Art and     literature flourished as never before, and commerce developed to     a considerable extent. Once more the Bulgarian Empire was     respected and feared abroad.  But this Bulgarian Empire was doomed to as short a life as its predecessor, though for a brief while it held out the illusionary hope of permanency. Bulgaria, from the Danube to the Rhodope Mountains, was won from the Greeks, and John Assen was powerful enough to dream of entering into alliance with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. An assassin's sword, however, ended John Assen's life prematurely. He was followed on the throne by his brother Peter. He, too, was assassinated, and was succeeded by his brother Kalojan, who had all the warlike virtues of John Assen, and re-established the Bulgarian Empire with territories which embraced more than half the whole Balkan Peninsula. Seeking to add to the reality of power some validity of title, Kalojan entered into negotiations with the Pope of Rome, made his submission to the Roman Church, and was crowned by a Papal nuncio as king.  It was about this time that Constantinople was captured by the Crusaders, and Count Baldwin of Flanders ascended the throne of the Caesars. The Greeks, driven from their capital but still holding some territory, made an alliance with Kalojan, and once again Greek and Bulgar fought side by side, defeating the Franks and taking the Emperor Baldwin prisoner. Then the alliance ended--never, it seems, can Bulgar and Greek be long at peace--and a war raged between the Greek Empire and Bulgaria, until in 1207 Kalojan was assassinated.  A brief period of prosperity continued for Bulgaria while John Assen II. was on the throne. He was the most civilised and humane of all the rulers of ancient Bulgaria, and there is no stain of a massacre or a murder remembered against his name. He made wars reluctantly, but always successfully. An inscription in a church at Tirnova records his prowess:      In the year 1230, I, John Assen, Czar and Autocrat of the     Bulgarians, obedient to God in Christ, son of the old Assen,     have built this most worthy church from its foundations, and     completely decked it with paintings in honour of the Forty holy     Martyrs, by whose help, in the 12th year of my reign, when the     church had just been painted, I set out to Roumania to the war     and smote the Greek army and took captive the Czar Theodore     Komnenus with all his nobles. And all lands have I conquered     from Adrianople to Durazzo, the Greek, the Albanian, and the     Servian land. Only the towns round Constantinople and that city     itself did the Franks hold; but these too bowed themselves     beneath the hand of my sovereignty, for they had no other Czar     but me, and prolonged their days according to my will, as God     had so ordained. For without Him no word or work is     accomplished. To Him be honour for ever. Amen.  John Assen II. was a great administrator as well as a great soldier. Whilst he declared the Church of Bulgaria independent, repudiating alike the Churches of Rome and of Constantinople, he tolerated all religions and gave sound encouragement to education. With his death passed away the last of the glory of ancient Bulgaria. Her story now was to be of almost unrelieved misfortune until the culminating misery of the Turkish conquest.  Internal"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22257"],["title","Bulgaria (#8)"],["body","sensions, wars with the Venetians, the Hungarians, the Serbs, the Greeks, the Tartars,--all these vexed Bulgaria. The country became subject for a time to the Tartars, then recovered its independence, then came under the dominion of Servia after the battle of Kostendil (1330). The Servians, closely akin by blood, proved kind conquerors, and for some years the two Slav peoples of the Balkans kept peace by a common policy in which Bulgaria, if dependent, was not enslaved. But the Turk was rapidly pouring into Europe. In 1366 the Bulgarian Czar, Sisman III., agreed to become the vassal of the Turkish Sultan Murad, and the centuries of subjection to the Turk began. After the battle of Kossovo the grip of the Turk on Bulgaria was tightened. Tirnova was captured, the nobles of the nation massacred, the national freedom obliterated. The desire for independence barely survived. But there was one happy circumstance:      \"It is a noteworthy fact,\" writes a Bulgarian authority, \"that     the Osmanlis, being themselves but little civilised, did not     attempt to assimilate the Bulgarians in the sense in which     civilised nations try to effect the intellectual and ethnic     assimilation of a subject race. Except in isolated cases, where     Bulgarian girls or young men were carried off and forced to     adopt Mohammedanism, the Government never took any general     measures to impose Mohammedanism or assimilate the Bulgarians to     the Moslems. The Turks prided themselves on keeping apart from     the Bulgarians, and this was fortunate for our nationality.     Contented with their political supremacy and pleased to feel     themselves masters, the Turks did not trouble about the     spiritual life of the _rayas_, except to try to trample out all     desires for independence. All these circumstances contributed to     allow the Bulgarian people, crushed and ground down by the     Turkish yoke, to concentrate and preserve their own inner     spiritual life. They formed religious communities attached to     the churches. These had a certain amount of autonomy, and,     beside seeing after the churches, could keep schools. The     national literature, full of the most poetic melancholy, handed     down from generation to generation and developed by tradition,     still tells us of the life of the Bulgarians under the Ottoman     yoke. In these popular songs, the memory of the ancient     Bulgarian kingdom is mingled with the sufferings of the present     hour. The songs of this period are remarkable for the Oriental     character of their tunes, and this is almost the sole trace of     Moslem influence.      \"In spite of the vigilance of the Turks, the religious     associations served as centres to keep alive the national     feeling. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, when     Russia declared war against Turkey (1827), Bulgaria awoke.\"  From 1366 to 1827 Bulgaria had been enslaved by the Turk. Now within the space of a few days and with hardly an effort on her own behalf, she was suddenly to be restored to independence.  [Illustration: ROUSTCHOUK, ON THE DANUBE]     CHAPTER V  THE LIBERATION OF BULGARIA   Significantly enough, the first sign of a renaissance of Bulgarian national feeling was an agitation not against the Turks but the Greeks. Patriotic Bulgarians, under the Sublime Porte, sought to re-establish their old National Church and shake it free from its subjection to the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople. The Sublime Porte was induced to look upon this demand with favour. A step which promised to emphasise the divisions between the Christians evidently should be of advantage to the Turks. The Greek Patriarch was urged to consent to the appointment of a Bulgarian bishop. He refused. In the face of that refusal Turkey acted as the creator of a new Christian Church, and in 1870 a firman of the Sultan created the Bulgarian Exarchate, and Bulgaria had again a national ecclesiastical organisation. Two years later the first Exarch was elected by the Bulgarian clergy. But gratitude for this religious concession did not extinguish the longings for political independence of the Bulgarian people. When a Christian insurrection broke out in Herzegovina against Turkey in 1875, the Bulgarian patriots rose in arms in different parts of their country. The massacres of Batak were the Turkish response, those \"Bulgarian atrocities\" which sent a shudder through all Europe and set a term to Turkish rule over the Christian populations in her European provinces.  I have been recently in the Balkans with the veteran war artist, Mr. Frederick Villiers, who has personal recollections of those times of massacre and atrocity. Speaking with him, an eye-witness of the devastation then wrought, it was possible to understand the fierce indignation with which the English-speaking world was stirred as the details of the horrors in the Balkans were unveiled. In all about 12,000 Bulgarian people perished, mostly butchered in cold blood. Turkish anger, it seems, was inflamed against the Bulgarians, because, in spite of the recent church concession, some of them had dared to strike for freedom; and this display of Turkish anger made the full freedom of Bulgaria certain.  [Illustration: \"MYSTERY\"--A STUDY IN THE ROUSTCHOUK DISTRICT]  At first an attempt had been made by the Powers to exert peaceful pressure upon Turkey, so that her Christian provinces should be granted local autonomy. The project of the Powers for Bulgaria proposed that the districts inhabited by Bulgarians should be divided into two provinces; the Eastern Province, with Tirnovo as capital, was to include the Sandjaks of Roustchouk, Tirnovo, Toultcha, Varna, Sliven, Philippopolis (not including Sultan-Eri and Ahi-Tchélebi), the kazas of Kirk Kilisse, Mustapha Pasha and Kasilagatch; and the Western Province, with Sofia as capital, the Sandjaks of Sofia, Vidin, Nisch, Uskub, Monastir, the three kazas of the north of Sérès, and the kazas of Stroumitza, Tikvesch, Velès, and Kastoria. Districts of from five to ten thousand inhabitants were to stand as the administrative unit. Christian and Mohammedans were to be settled homogeneously in these districts. Each district was to have at its head a mayor and a district council, elected by universal suffrage, and was to enjoy entire autonomy as regards local affairs. Several districts would form a Sandjak with a prefect at its head who was to be Christian or Mohammedan, according to the majority of the population of the Sandjak. He would be proposed by the Governor-General, and nominated by the Porte for four years.  Finally, every two Sandjaks were to be administered by a Christian Governor-General nominated by the Porte for five years, with consent of the Powers. He would govern the province with the help of a provincial assembly, composed of representatives chosen by the district councils for a term of four years, at the rate of one deputy to thirty or forty thousand inhabitants. This assembly would nominate an administrative council of ten members. The provincial assembly would be summoned every year to decide the budget and the taxes. The armed force was to be concentrated in the towns and there would be local militia beside. The language of the predominant nationality was to be employed, as well as Turkish. Finally, a Commission of International Control was to supervise the working of these proposals.  The Porte promised reforms on these lines, but did not go beyond promising. The task of forcing her to end a cruel tyranny was one for the battlefield.  The Russo-Turkish War broke out on April 12, 1877, and what Turkey had refused to yield of her own accord was wrested from her by force of arms, in the preliminary treaty of San Stefano. By this treaty, Bulgaria was made an autonomous principality subject to Turkey, with a Christian government and national militia. The Prince of Bulgaria was to be freely chosen by the Bulgarian people and accepted by the Sublime Porte, with the consent of the Powers. It was agreed that an assembly of notables, presided over by a Russian Commissioner and attended by a Turkish Commissioner, should meet at Philippopolis or Tirnovo before the election of the Prince to draw up a constitutional statute similar to those of the other Danubian principalities agreed to after the Treaty of Adrianople in 1830.  The Treaty of San Stefano brought into being on paper a Bulgaria greater in area than the Bulgaria of 1912, and greater even than the Bulgaria of 1914. But the Treaty was not ratified. Other European Powers, alarmed at the prospect of Russia becoming supreme in the Balkans through the aid of a Bulgarian vassal state, interfered, and the Congress of Berlin substituted for the Treaty of San Stefano the Treaty of Berlin.  The Treaty of Berlin provided:      Bulgaria is to be an independent Principality, subject to the     Sultan, with a Christian government and a national militia; the     Prince of Bulgaria will be freely chosen by the Bulgarian nation     and accepted by the Sublime Porte, with the approval of the     Great Powers; no member of a reigning European family can be     elected Prince of Bulgaria; in case of a vacancy of the throne     the election will be repeated under the same conditions and with     the same forms; before the election of the Prince, an assembly     of notables will decide on the constitutional statute of the     Principality at Tirnovo. The laws will be based on principles of     civil and religious liberty.  By the Treaty of Berlin the boundaries of Bulgaria were very greatly curtailed as compared with those of the Treaty of San Stefano, shrinking from an area as great almost as the Bulgarian Empire of Simeon down to a broad band of territory running between Eastern Roumelia and Roumania.  [Illustration: A BLIND BEGGAR WOMAN]  But the Bulgars kept the Treaty of San Stefano rather than the Treaty of Berlin before their eyes as their national charter. Almost from the"]]]
