He would have to engage Jim Farland, he told himself, and learn a few things concerning Miss Kate Gilbert.  Had the journey because of ill health been a subterfuge? Had Kate Gilbert gone to Honduras to watch him? If she had, what was the reason for it?  \"It's enough to make a man a maniac,\" Prale mused. \"And that Shepley man! He was all right when we parted on the ship. Somebody said something to him about me after he landed. He treated me as if I had been a skunk.\"  Then he thought of George Lerton, his cousin. He couldn't quite make up his mind about Lerton. The man seemed frenzied in his eagerness to get Prale to leave New York. And Prale knew that it was not because of an overwhelming love George Lerton had for him, not anxiety lest ill fortune should come to Sidney Prale.  He would have to think it out, he told himself. At least, he knew that he had foes working against him, and could be on guard continually. Down in Honduras he had won a reputation as a fighter, and a fight was a fight in any clime, he knew; there might be a difference in the rules here and there, but the same qualities decided the winner.  He continued walking down the street toward the river. In Honduras he had become accustomed to walking up and down the beach and looking at the water whenever he wanted to think and solve some problem, and it probably was habit that sent him to the water front now.  He tossed away the butt of his cigar and did not light another at the moment. For a time he stood looking out at the black water, at the craft plying back and forth, their lights flashing. He stepped upon a little dock and started walking its length. After a time he came near the end of it without having encountered a watchman, and sat down on a box in a dark, secluded corner.  There, his back braced against the building and the building shielding him from the cold wind that came up from the distant sea, Sidney Prale sat and tried to think it out.  One thing made a comfortable thought--he had money with which to fight. Either he was the victim of some injustice, or a grave mistake was being made. He wished that he had forced George Lerton to tell him more, and he decided that he would do so if they met again. He might even hunt him out and force him to speak. Sidney Prale thought nothing of handling a man like Lerton.  He heard steps on the dock and remained silent in the darkness, thinking that possibly some watchman was making the rounds. If he was discovered, he would say that he had been looking at the river, give the watchman his card and a tip, and leave.  The steps came nearer and Prale could make out the form of a man slipping along the dock's edge in a furtive manner. There was not light enough for Prale to see his features. He was walking bent over, a short, heavy-set man who did not wear an overcoat.  Prale watched as the man passed within six feet of him and went to the edge of the dock. There he stood, outlined against the sky, looking down at the water. Prale imagined that he heard something like a sob, and gave closer attention. Then he saw the man take off his coat and drop it behind him, remove his cap and place it on the coat, and look down at the water again.  And then Sidney Prale sprang straight forward, and grasped the body of the other as it was in mid-air.  \"No, you don't!\" Prale exclaimed.  He found immediately that he had a fight on his hands. The other whirled and began kicking and striking. Sidney Prale hurled him backward, rushed, caught him up again in a better hold, threw him back against the building, and held him there, breathless and panting.  \"Another smash out of you, and I'll drop you into the river myself!\" Prale said. \"Suppose you take time to get your breath now.\"  \"I--I thought you was a cop.\"  \"Afraid of the cops?\"  \"It's against the law to--to try to commit suicide.\"  \"So I understand,\" said Prale. \"Well, I am not a cop. Trying to drown yourself, were you? Why?\"  \"Why not?\" the other asked. \"I'm done with livin'.\"  \"Not just yet, but you would have been if I hadn't been sitting here.\"  \"I've knocked all over the world--and made a few mistakes,\" said the derelict. \"Oh, nothin' that would get me in trouble with the cops! But I just found out that I'm clutterin' up the earth and don't amount to anything. I'm sick of half starvin' to death, and workin' like a dog when I get the chance just to get enough to keep a few old clothes hung on me.\"  \"Disgusted generally with your lot?\" Prale asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Friends or relatives?\"  \"Not any.\"  \"What's your name?\" Prale asked.  \"You mean my real name? I don't remember. It's been so long since I've used it, and I've used so many others since that I don't know. What's the difference?\"  \"I'll call you Murk,\" said Prale. \"That expresses the dark river, the deed you were about to do, and the evident state of your feelings.\"  \"It's as good as any, I suppose.\"  \"What's your particular grievance against the world in general?\"  \"It ain't anything in particular,\" said Murk. \"It's just general.\"  \"I see. A drifter, are you?\"  \"I reckon I am.\"  \"Sore at existence, eh?\"  \"Well, what's the use of livin'?\" Murk demanded. \"There ain't a man, woman or child in the world that gives a whoop what becomes of me. I'm just in the way to be kicked around.\"  \"Maybe you haven't found your proper place in the scheme of things.\"  \"I've sure done some travelin' lookin' for it, boss, but maybe I ain't found it, as you say. I sure ain't found any place that looks like it needed me bad.\"  \"Hard to make a living?\"  \"Oh, I get along. But, what's the use?\" Murk wanted to know. \"I ain't got anybody--I get lonesome lots of times. If I had money, it might be different.\"  \"I'm not so sure about that,\" said Prale, smiling a bit. \"I've got a million dollars, and, as far as I know right this minute, I have just one friend in New York.\"  \"If I had a million dollars I wouldn't care whether I had a friend or not,\" Murk said.  \"You can be just as lonesome with a million dollars as you can without a cent,\" Prale told him. \"I was sitting down here because I was lonesome, and because there are some enemies working at me, and I don't know who they are or why they want to trouble me.\"  \"Well, let's jump in the drink together,\" Murk said.  \"Why not fight it out?\" asked Sidney Prale.  \"Mister, I've been fightin' for years, and it don't get me anything. It just tires me out--that's all. The next world can't be any worse than this.\"  \"Are you a fighter, or a quitter?\"  \"Nobody ever called me a quitter.\"  \"But you were trying to be a few minutes ago. You were going to quit like a yellow dog!\" Prale told him. \"You were going to throw up the sponge and give the devil a laugh.\"  \"That's between me and the devil--nobody else would care.\"  \"If you had a friend, an influential friend, and didn't have to keep up a continual fight to hold body and soul together, could you manage to face the world a little longer?\"  \"I reckon I could.\"  \"How old are you?\"  \"Thirty-five,\" said Murk.  \"Old enough to have some sense. I am three years older. I'm almost as lonesome as you are. Why not join forces, Murk?\"  \"Sir?\"  \"If I showed you a corner where you would fit in, would you be loyal? Would you stand by me, help me fight if it was necessary, and all that?\"  \"You just try me--that's all.\"  \"Very well, Murk, I'm going to trust you. I told you the truth when I said I had a million dollars. I have but one friend I can depend upon, and I have enemies. I like to fight, Murk, but I like to have a good pal at my back when I do.\"  \"That's me, too, sir; but I ain't ever had the pal.\"  \"You've got one now, Murk. You'd be dead now, but for me. So you must be my man, understand?\"  \"I don't quite getcha.\"  \"You're under my orders from now on, Murk. We'll have a nice row, standing back to back perhaps. I'll take you on as a sort of valet and bodyguard. You'll have good clothes and a home and plenty to eat and a bit of money to spend. I'll expect you to be loyal. If I find that you are not--well, Murk, I got back yesterday from Central America. I got my million down there, by fighting for it, and there were times when I had to handle men roughly. I can read men, Murk. Can you imagine what I'd do to a man who double crossed me?\"  \"I getcha now! You needn't be afraid I'll double cross you. I don't think this is real.\"  \"It's real, Murk, if we strike a bargain. Do we?\"  \"I've got everything to win and nothin' to lose--so we do!\" Murk said.  \"Fair enough. Now we'll get off this dock. Pick up your cap and coat.\"  Murk picked them up and put them on, and then he followed at Prale's heels until they were on the street and beneath the nearest light. There they stopped and looked each other over.  Murk was short, but he was built for strength. Prale could tell at a glance that the man, even poorly nourished as he was, had muscles that could be depended on. Prale liked the look around Murk's eyes, too. Murk was a dog man, the sort that proves faithful to the end if treated right.  \"Well, how do you like me?\" Prale asked.  \"You look good to me, sir.\"  \"My name is Sidney Prale.\"  \"Yes, Mr. Prale.\"  \"You understand our little deal thoroughly?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Come along, then. Here is a cigar--light up!\"  Murk lighted the cigar, and Prale lighted another, and they went rapidly up the street to Fifth Avenue. Prale signaled a passing taxicab, and they got in. When the cab stopped, it was in a district where some cheap clothing stores remain open until almost midnight.  Half an hour later they emerged again. Murk was dressed in a suit which was somber in tone, and which was not at all a bad fit. He was dressed in new clothing from the skin out. Prale took him to a barber shop, and waited until the barber gave Murk a hair cut and a shave.  \"Gosh!\" Murk said, when he looked at himself in the glass. \"This can't be me!\"  \"It is, however,\" Prale assured him. \"Now, we'll go home, Murk, and get settled.\"  \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21891"],["title","The Brand of Silence: A Detective Story (#7)"],["body","is home?\"  Prale named the hotel.  \"I'd get thrown out on my bean if I ever stuck my nose in the kitchen door,\" Murk said.  \"You're not going into the kitchen, Murk. You're going to be registered as my valet and bodyguard, and you're going up in the elevator with me. Kindly remember, Murk, that you are the personal servant of Mr. Sidney Prale.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And your boss has a million dollars and nobody knows how many secret enemies. Those things give you a standing, Murk. When we are alone, of course, you'll be a sort of pal. I never had a valet before and I couldn't stand a regular one. Instead of being a valet, when we are alone, I want you to be a regular fellow.\"  \"I getcha, Mr. Prale.\"  \"Off we go, then.\"  They arrived at the hotel, and Prale registered Murk as his valet and took him up to the suite.  \"You bunk in there, Murk,\" Prale said, pointing to another room. \"Take a bath and go to bed and get some rest. If you are inclined to throw me down, you'll find some money and jewelry in the top drawer of the dresser. Rob me and sneak out during the night, if you want to. Cut my throat, if it's necessary.\"  \"You needn't be afraid, sir--you can trust me!\"  \"I do!\" said Sidney Prale.  Prale slept well that night. When he awoke in the morning, Murk was dressed and sitting by the window. He drew Prale's bath without being told, and then stood around as if waiting to be of service.  \"I--I found this slipped under your door, sir,\" he said, after a time.  \"What is it, Murk?\"  \"A piece of paper with writing on it, sir.\"  \"More news from the enemy, I suppose. What does it say?\"  \"It says as how a man's sin always finds him out.\"  \"That's interesting, isn't it? Do you think I am a sinner of some sort, Murk?\"  \"I don't care if you are, sir!\"  \"Murk! You needn't get excited about it. Put the paper in the lower drawer of the dresser; I'm making a collection of them,\" Prale said. He went back into the other room and continued dressing. \"Go to the telephone and order breakfast served to us here, Murk,\" he directed.  \"What shall I order, sir?\"  \"Order plenty of whatever you like, and tell them to make it double,\" said Prale.  Murk grinned and gave a proper order. Prale was dressed by the time the breakfast was served. He and Murk made a hearty meal.  And then Prale lighted his morning cigar and began reading the newspapers. Murk went around the suite, straightening things and trying to be of service. He looked at Sidney Prale often; it was plain to be seen that Prale was Murk's kind of man.  There came a knock at the door.  \"See who it is, Murk,\" Sidney Prale said.  He did not even look up from the paper he was reading. He supposed it was some hotel employee. Murk stalked across to the door and threw it open. Two men stood there. Murk flinched when he saw them. He did not know either of them, but he knew them immediately for what they were. Murk was a man of experience.  \"Mr. Prale in?\" one of them asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  Without asking permission, the two men stepped inside, and one of them closed the door. Prale dropped the newspaper and turned around to face them.  \"Are you Sidney Prale?\" one of them asked.  \"I am.\"  \"You are under arrest, Mr. Prale.\"  \"I beg your pardon?\"  \"Under arrest,\" I said. \"You know your rights, perhaps, so you need not talk unless you wish to do so.\"  \"You are officers?\"  They showed their shields.  \"Straight from headquarters,\" one of them replied. \"We want to take a look around your room while we are here.\"  \"Suppose,\" said Sidney Prale, \"that you tell me, first, why I am under arrest? Of what crime am I accused?\"  \"You are charged with murder.\"  \"Murder? What crazy joke is this?\" Prale cried. \"And what particular person am I accused of murdering?\"  \"You are charged with the murder of Mr. Rufus Shepley,\" the detective replied.     CHAPTER VII  EVIDENCE   Many times in his life, Sidney Prale had been greatly surprised, astonished, shocked. But never had he experienced such a feeling as he did at this bald announcement of a police detective.  The statement was like a blow between the eyes. Prale stared at the two detectives for an instant, his face flushed, and then he began to laugh.  \"It isn't a laughing matter, Mr. Prale,\" one of the detectives told him.  \"Pardon me, but it is so utterly preposterous,\" Prale replied. \"I fail to see how I can be accused of such a crime. I am not a cut-throat, and Rufus Shepley was a man I met on shipboard casually, and have seen him only once since.\"  \"You can do your talking at headquarters, Mr. Prale,\" the officer said. \"I'll have to ask you to come along with us. I'll leave my partner here to look through your rooms.\"  \"The sooner I get to headquarters, the sooner this thing will be straightened out,\" Prale said. \"Murk, you will remain here in the rooms until you hear from me. Let the officer look at anything he wishes to inspect.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Murk, glaring at the two detectives.  Prale faced the detective who had been speaking to him.  \"Be with you as soon as I get my hat and coat,\" he said. \"It'll not be necessary, I hope, to put handcuffs on me.\"  \"We can go to headquarters in a taxi, and I guess I can handle you if you try any tricks,\" the detective replied.  \"There are going to be no tricks tried,\" Prale said.  \"Nevertheless, I think I'll keep a close eye on you.\"  \"Do so, by all means!\" Prale retorted.  \"Ain't there anything I can do, sir?\" Murk asked.  \"Nothing except to remain in the rooms until you hear from me,\" Prale told him. \"If I should--er--be detained, I'll probably send for you.\"  \"Very well, sir.\"  One of the detectives left the suite with Prale and walked down the hall to the elevator. The second officer remained behind to go through Prale's things in an effort to find evidence.  Prale said nothing regarding the crime as they journeyed in the taxicab to police headquarters. His mind was busy, though. This appeared to be a culmination of the annoyances to which he had been subjected.  At headquarters he was ushered into a room where a captain of detectives awaited him.  \"Don't have to talk unless you want to, Mr. Prale, but it probably will be better for you to do so, and have an end of it,\" the captain said. \"Why did you kill Rufus Shepley?\"  \"That's a fool question. I didn't kill him. I had no idea he was dead until the officer arrested me for his murder. I scarcely know the man, captain. I made his acquaintance aboard a ship coming from Central America, and I met him but once after leaving the ship. He told me his business and gave me his card, and that is all. I'm ready to answer any questions you may ask. This is some terrible mistake. I want to talk about it--have an end of it, as you say.\"  \"Very well, Prale,\" the captain said.  \"Mr. Prale, if you please. I have not been convicted yet and am entitled to some courtesy, it seems to me.\"  \"All right, if you're going to be nasty about it,\" the captain said. \"But you won't gain anything by taking a high-and-mighty attitude with me.\"  \"I simply object to being addressed in the tone you used,\" Prale replied. \"I am no crook. Let's get down to business. Ask me any questions you like, and I'd like to ask a few myself.\"  \"That is fair enough,\" the captain said, a shrewd expression coming into his face.  \"Suppose you take it for granted, for a few minutes, that I am innocent, and tell me when Rufus Shepley was killed, and where, and just how.\"  \"Very well, Mr. Prale. A hotel attendant found the body at an early hour this morning. It was in Mr. Shepley's room. The man was fully dressed. The physicians say that he was killed about eleven o'clock last night.\"  \"I understand; go on, please.\"  \"He had been stabbed through the heart,\" said the captain. \"Death had been instantaneous.\"  \"But why suspect me of the crime?\" Prale asked.  \"This was found beside the body,\" the captain replied.  From the desk before him he picked up a fountain pen. It was an elaborate pen, chased with gold, and on one side of it was a tiny gold plate, upon which Prale's name had been engraved.  \"You recognize it?\" the captain asked.  \"Certainly; it is mine.\"  \"Oh, you admit that, do you?\"  \"Naturally. But I fail to see how it came to be beside the body of Rufus Shepley.\"  \"A man who has committed a murder generally is in a hurry to get away,\" said the captain. \"It is easy to drop a fountain pen from a pocket, especially if a man is bending over.\"  \"I don't even know where Shepley's rooms were located,\" Prale said. \"I didn't know the pen was missing until this minute----\"  \"Possibly not,\" replied the captain of detectives.  \"And I am quite sure I do not know how it came to be beside the body, but of one thing I am certain--I did not drop it there.\"  \"Naturally, you would say that.\"  \"And where is the motive?\" Prale demanded. \"Suppose you tell me what you have against me, and then I'll proceed to tear your shabby evidence to pieces.\"  \"We have this particular case so well in hand that I can afford to do that,\" the captain said. \"Attend me closely and you'll see the futility of denying your guilt.\"  \"I am waiting to hear the evidence,\" Prale said.  \"Very well. In the first place, you have recently spent some years in Central America.\"  \"Ten years in Honduras,\" said Prale.  \"You made a fortune down there. We have communicated with the authorities there and have learned many things about you. We have learned that you have a hot temper and know how to handle men. You have been known to beat natives terribly----\"  \"Rot! I was kinder than nine out of ten men of affairs. I have punished a few natives caught stealing, for instance.\"  \"Recently, Mr. Prale, you cashed in on all your properties down there and announced that you were about to leave the country.\"  \"That is correct,\" said Prale. \"I made the million I went down there to make. Honduras is all right in some ways, but a man likes to live with his own kind. My home was in New York, and so, naturally, I decided to return here.\"  \"Did you not tell some of your"]]]
