Regarding the distances in the stellar system the astronomers have had a varying practice. German astronomers, SEELIGER and others, have long used a stellar unit of distance corresponding to an annual parallax of 0″.2, which has been called a “Siriusweite”. To this name it may be justly objected that it has no international use, a great desideratum in science. Against the theoretical definition of this unit it may also be said that a distance is suitably to be defined through another distance and not through an angle--an angle which corresponds moreover, in this case, to the _harmonic_ mean distance of the star and not to its arithmetic mean distance. The same objection may be made to the unit “parsec.” proposed in 1912 by TURNER.  For my part I have, since 1911, proposed a stellar unit which, both in name and definition, nearly coincides with the proposition of SEELIGER, and which will be exclusively used in these lectures. A _siriometer_ is put equal to 10^6 times the planetary unit of distance, corresponding to a parallax of 0″.206265 (in practice sufficiently exactly 0″.2).  In popular writings, another unit: a _light-year_, has for a very long time been employed. The relation between these units is      1 siriometer = 15.79   light-years,     1 light-year =  0.0633 siriometers.   5. In regard to _time_ also, the terrestrial units (second, day, year) are too small for stellar wants. As being consistent with the unit of distance, I have proposed for the stellar unit of time a _stellar year_ (st.), corresponding to 10^6 years. We thus obtain the same relation between the stellar and the planetary units of length and time, which has the advantage that a _velocity_ of a star expressed in siriometers per stellar year is expressed with the same numerals in planetary units of length per year.  Spectroscopic determinations of the velocities, through the DOPPLER-principle, are generally expressed in km. per second. The relation with the stellar unit is the following:      1 km./sec. = 0.2111 sir./st.,                = 0.2111 planetary units per year,     1 sir./st. = 4.7375 km./sec.  Thus the velocity of the sun is 20 km./sec. or 4.22 sir./st. (= 4.22 earth distances from the sun per year).  Of the numerical value of the stellar velocity we shall have opportunity to speak in the following. For the present it may suffice to mention that most stars have a velocity of the same degree as that of the sun (in the mean somewhat greater), and that the highest observed velocity of a star amounts to 72 sir./st. (= 340 km./sec.). In the next chapter I give a table containing the most speedy stars. The least value of the stellar velocity is evidently equal to zero.   6. _Intensity of the radiation._ This varies within wide limits. The faintest star which can give an impression on the photographic plates of the greatest instrument of the Mount Wilson observatory (100 inch reflector) is nearly 100 million times fainter than Sirius, a star which is itself more than 10000 million times fainter than the sun--speaking of apparent radiation.  The intensity is expressed in _magnitudes_ (_m_). The reason is partly that we should otherwise necessarily have to deal with very large numbers, if they were to be proportional to the intensity, and partly that it is proved that the human eye apprehends quantities of light as proportional to _m_.  This depends upon a general law in psycho-physics, known as FECHNER's _law_, which says that changes of the apparent impression of light are proportional not to the changes of the intensity but to these changes divided by the primitive intensity. A similar law is valid for all sensations. A conversation is inaudible in the vicinity of a waterfall. An increase of a load in the hand from nine to ten hectograms makes no great difference in the feeling, whereas an increase from one to two hectograms is easily appreciable. A match lighted in the day-time makes no increase in the illumination, and so on.  A mathematical analysis shows that from the law of FECHNER it follows that the impression increases in _arithmetical_ progression (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) simultaneously with an increase of the intensity in _geometrical_ progression (_I_, _I_^2, _I_^3, _I_^4, ...). It is with the sight the same as with the hearing. It is well known that the numbers of vibrations of the notes of a harmonic scale follow each other in a geometrical progression though, for the ear, the intervals between the notes are apprehended as equal. The magnitudes play the same rôle in relation to the quantities of light as do the logarithms to the corresponding numbers. If a star is considered to have a brightness intermediate between two other stars it is not the _difference_ but the _ratio_ of the quantities of light that is equal in each case.  The branch of astronomy (or physics) which deals with intensities of radiation is called _photometry_. In order to determine a certain scale for the magnitudes we must choose, in a certain manner, the _zero-point_ of the scale and the _scale-ratio_.  Both may be chosen arbitrarily. The _zero-point_ is now almost unanimously chosen by astronomers in accordance with that used by the Harvard Observatory. No rigorous definition of the Harvard zero-point, as far as I can see, has yet been given (compare however H. A. 50[3]), but considering that the Pole-star (α Ursæ Minoris) is used at Harvard as a fundamental star of comparison for the brighter stars, and that, according to the observations at Harvard and those of HERTZSPRUNG (A. N. 4518 [1911]), the light of the Pole-star is very nearly invariable, we may say that _the zero-point of the photometric scale is chosen in such a manner that for the Pole-star _m_ = 2.12_. If the magnitudes are given in another scale than the Harvard-scale (H. S.), it is necessary to apply the zero-point correction. This amounts, for the Potsdam catalogue, to -0m.16.  It is further necessary to determine the _scale-ratio_. Our magnitudes for the stars emanate from PTOLEMY. It was found that the scale-ratio--giving the ratio of the light-intensities of two consecutive classes of magnitudes--according to the older values of the magnitudes, was approximately equal to 2½. When exact photometry began (with instruments for measuring the magnitudes) in the middle of last century, the scale-ratio was therefore put equal to 2.5. Later it was found more convenient to choose it equal to 2.512, the logarithm of which number has the value 0.4. The magnitudes being themselves logarithms of a kind, it is evidently more convenient to use a simple value of the logarithm of the ratio of intensity than to use this ratio itself. This scale-ratio is often called the POGSON-scale (used by POGSON in his “Catalogue of 53 known variable stars”, Astr. Obs. of the Radcliffe Observatory, 1856), and is now exclusively used.  It follows from the definition of the scale-ratio that two stars for which the light intensities are in the ratio 100:1 differ by exactly 5 magnitudes. A star of the 6th magnitude is 100 times fainter than a star of the first magnitude, a star of the 11th magnitude 10000 times, of the 16th magnitude a million times, and a star of the 21st magnitude 100 million times fainter than a star of the first magnitude. The star magnitudes are now, with a certain reservation for systematic errors, determined with an accuracy of 0m.1, and closer. Evidently, however, there will correspond to an error of 0.1 in the magnitude a considerable uncertainty in the light ratios, when these differ considerably from each other.      Sun         -26m.60     Full moon   -11m.77     Venus       - 4m.28     Jupiter     - 2m.35     Mars        - 1m.79     Mercury     - 0m.90     Saturn      + 0m.88     Uranus      + 5m.86     Neptune     + 7m.66  A consequence of the definition of _m_ is that we also have to do with _negative_ magnitudes (as well as with negative logarithms). Thus, for example, for _Sirius_ _m_ = -1.58. The magnitudes of the greater planets, as well as those of the moon and the sun, are also negative, as will be seen from the adjoining table, where the values are taken from “Die Photometrie der Gestirne” by G. MÜLLER.  The apparent magnitude of the sun is given by ZÖLLNER (1864). The other values are all found in Potsdam, and allude generally to the maximum value of the apparent magnitude of the moon and the planets.  The brightest star is _Sirius_, which has the magnitude _m_ = -1.58. The magnitude of the faintest visible star evidently depends on the penetrating power of the instrument used. The telescope of WILLIAM HERSCHEL, used by him and his son in their star-gauges and other stellar researches, allowed of the discerning of stars down to the 14th magnitude. The large instruments of our time hardly reach much farther, for visual observations. When, however, photographic plates are used, it is easily possible to get impressions of fainter stars, even with rather modest instruments. The large 100-inch mirror of the Wilson Observatory renders possible the photographic observations of stars of the 20th apparent magnitude, and even fainter.  The observations of visual magnitudes are performed almost exclusively with the photometer of ZÖLLNER in a more or less improved form.   7. _Absolute magnitude._ The apparent magnitude of a star is changed as the star changes its distance from the observer, the intensity increasing indirectly as the square of the distance of the star. In order to make the magnitudes of the stars comparable with each other it is convenient to reduce them to their value at a certain unit of distance. As such we choose one siriometer. The corresponding magnitude will be called the _absolute_ magnitude and is denoted by _M_.[4] We easily find from the table given in the preceding paragraph that the absolute magnitude of the sun, according to ZÖLLNER's value of _m_, amounts to +3.4, of the moon to +31.2. For Jupiter we find "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22157"],["title","Lectures on Stellar Statistics (#2)"],["body","= +24.6, for Venus _M_ = +25.3. The other planets have approximately _M_ = +30.  For the absolute magnitudes of those stars for which it has hitherto been possible to carry out a determination, we find a value of _M_ between -8 and +13. We shall give in the third chapter short tables of the absolutely brightest and faintest stars now known.   8. _Photographic magnitudes._ The magnitudes which have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs all refer to observations taken with the eye, and are called _visual_ magnitudes. The total intensity of a star is, however, essentially dependent on the instrument used in measuring the intensity. Besides the eye, the astronomers use a photographic plate, bolometer, a photo-electric cell, and other instruments. The difference in the results obtained with these instruments is due to the circumstance that different parts of the radiation are taken into account.  The usual photographic plates, which have their principal sensibility in the violet parts of the spectrum, give us the _photographic_ magnitudes of the stars. It is, however, to be remarked that these magnitudes may vary from one plate to another, according to the distributive function of the plate (compare L. M. 67). This variation, which has not yet been sufficiently studied, seems however to be rather inconsiderable, and must be neglected in the following.  The photographic magnitude of a star will in these lectures be denoted by _m′_, corresponding to a visual magnitude _m_.  In practical astronomy use is also made of plates which, as the result of a certain preparation (in colour baths or in other ways), have acquired a distributive function nearly corresponding to that of the eye, and especially have a maximum point at the same wave-lengths. Such magnitudes are called _photo-visual_ (compare the memoir of PARKHURST in A. J. 36 [1912]).  The photographic magnitude of a star is generally determined from measurements of the diameter of the star on the plate. A simple mathematical relation then permits us to determine _m′_. The diameter of a star image increases with the time of exposure. This increase is due in part to the diffraction of the telescope, to imperfect achromatism or spherical aberration of the objective, to irregular grinding of the glass, and especially to variations in the refraction of the air, which produce an oscillation of the image around a mean position.  The _zero-point_ of the photographic magnitudes is so determined that this magnitude coincides with the visual magnitude for such stars as belong to the spectral type A0 and have _m_ = 6.0, according to the proposal of the international solar conference at Bonn, 1911.  Determinations of the photographic or photo-visual magnitudes may now be carried out with great accuracy. The methods for this are many and are well summarised in the Report of the Council of the R. A. S. of the year 1913. The most effective and far-reaching method seems to be that proposed by SCHWARZSCHILD, called the half-grating method, by which two exposures are taken of the same part of the sky, while at one of the exposures a certain grating is used that reduces the magnitudes by a constant degree.   9. _Colour of the stars._ The radiation of a star is different for different wave-lengths (λ). As regarding other mass phenomena we may therefore mention:--(1) the _total radiation_ or intensity (_I_), (2) the _mean wave-length_ (λ_0), (3) the _dispersion of the wave-length_ (σ). In the preceding paragraphs we have treated of the total radiation of the stars as this is expressed through their magnitudes. The mean wave-length is pretty closely defined by the _colour_, whereas the dispersion of the wave-length is found from the _spectrum_ of the stars.  There are blue (B), white (W), yellow (Y) and red (R) stars, and intermediate colours. The exact method is to define the colour through the mean wave-length (and not conversely) or the _effective_ wave-length as it is most usually called, or from the _colour-index_. We shall revert later to this question. There are, however, a great many direct eye-estimates of the colour of the stars.  _Colour corresponding to a given spectrum._      _Sp._    _Colour_       _Number_      B3        YW-            161      A0        YW-            788      A5        YW             115      F5        YW, WY-        295      G5        WY             216      K5        WY+, Y-        552      M         Y, Y+           95      -----------------------------                      Sum ... 2222  _Spectrum corresponding to a given colour._      _Colour_       _Sp._       _Number_      W, W+          A0           281      YW-            A0           356      YW             A5           482      YW+, YW-       F3           211      WY             G4           264      WY+, Y-        K1           289      Y, Y+          K4           254      RY-, RY        K5            85      --------------------------------                         Sum ... 2222  The signs + and - indicate intermediate shades of colour.  The preceding table drawn up by Dr. MALMQUIST from the colour observations of MÜLLER and KEMPF in Potsdam, shows the connection between the colours of the stars and their spectra.  The Potsdam observations contain all stars north of the celestial equator having an apparent magnitude brighter than 7m.5.  We find from these tables that there is a well-pronounced _regression_ in the correlation between the spectra and the colours of the stars. Taking together all white stars we find the corresponding mean spectral type to be A0, but to A0 corresponds, upon an average, the colour yellow-white. The yellow stars belong in the mean to the K-type, but the K-stars have upon an average a shade of white in the yellow colour. The coefficient of correlation (_r_) is not easy to compute in this case, because one of the attributes, the colour, is not strictly graduated (_i.e._ it is not expressed in numbers defining the colour).[5] Using the coefficient of contingency of PEARSON, it is, however, possible to find a fairly reliable value of the coefficient of correlation, and MALMQUIST has in this way found _r_ = +0.85, a rather high value.  In order to facilitate the discussion of the relation between colour and spectrum it is convenient to deal here with the question of the spectra of the stars.   10. _Spectra of the stars._ In order to introduce the discussion I first give a list of the wave-lengths of the FRAUENHOFER lines in the spectrum, and the corresponding chemical elements.      _FRAUENHOFER line_    _Element_          λ        A                                   759.4        B                                   686.8        C(α)               H (hydrogen)     656.3        D_1                Na (sodium)      589.6        D_3                He               587.6        E                  Fe (iron)        527.0        F(β)               H                486.2         (γ)               H                434.1        G                  Ca (calcium)     430.8        h(δ)               H                410.2        H(ε)               Ca(H)            396.9        K                  Ca               393.4  The first column gives the FRAUENHOFER denomination of each line. Moreover the hydrogen lines α, β, γ, δ, ε are denoted. The second column gives the name of the corresponding element, to which each line is to be attributed. The third column gives the wave-length expressed in millionths of a millimeter as unit (μμ).  On plate III, where the classification of the stellar spectra according to the Harvard system is reproduced, will be found also the wave-lengths of the principal H and He lines.  By the visual spectrum is usually understood the part of the radiation between the FRAUENHOFER lines A to H (λ = 760 to 400 μμ), whereas the photographic spectrum generally lies between F and K (λ = 500 to 400 μμ).  In the earliest days of spectroscopy the spectra of the stars were classified according to their visual spectra. This classification was introduced by SECCHI and was later more precisely defined by VOGEL. The three classes I, II, III of VOGEL correspond approximately to the colour classification into white, yellow, and red stars. Photography has now almost entirely taken the place of visual observations of spectra, so that SECCHI's and VOGEL's definitions of the stellar spectra are no longer applicable. The terminology now used was introduced by PICKERING and Miss CANNON and embraces a great many types, of which we here describe the principal forms as they are defined in Part. II of Vol. XXVIII of the Annals of the Harvard Observatory. It may be remarked that PICKERING first arranged the types in alphabetical order A, B, C, &c., supposing that order to correspond to the temperature of the stars. Later this was found to be partly wrong, and in particular it was found that the B-stars may be hotter than those of type A. The following is the temperature-order of the spectra according to the opinion of the Harvard astronomers.  _Type O_ (WOLF-RAYET stars). The spectra of these stars consist mainly of bright lines. They are characterized by the bright bands at wave-lengths 463 μμ and 469 μμ, and the line at 501 μμ characteristic of gaseous nebulae is sometimes present.  This type embraces mainly stars of relatively small apparent brightness. The brightest is γ Velorum with _m_ = 2.22. We shall find that the absolute magnitude of these stars nearly coincides with that of the stars of type B.  The type is grouped into five subdivisions represented by the letters Oa, Ob, Oc, Od and Oe. These subdivisions are conditioned by the varying intensities of the bright bands named above. The due sequence of these sub-types is for the present an open question.  Among interesting stars of this type is ζ Puppis (Od), in the spectrum of which PICKERING discovered a previously unknown series of helium lines. They were at first attributed (by RYDBERG) to hydrogen and were called “additiona"]]]
