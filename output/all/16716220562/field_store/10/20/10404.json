This was a great novelty to me, being the first that I had ever seen, and it gave me something to talk of and think about for the next four days.  The ships now began to close in, as we neared the entrance of the straits, and we had the pleasure of sailing in company for a few days. The shores of the straits became visible occasionally, and soon we passed with perfect confidence and security among those narrow channels and mountains of ice that damped the ardour and retarded the progress of Hudson, Button, Gibbons, and other navigators in days of yore.  One day, during a dead calm, our ship and the _Prince of Wales_ lay close to each other, rolling in the swell of the glassy ocean.  There seemed to be no prospect of a breeze, so the captain ordered his gig to be launched, and invited the doctor, Mr Carles, and myself to go on board the _Prince of Wales_ with him.  We accepted his offer, and were soon alongside.  Old Captain Ryle, a veteran in the Company's service, received us kindly, and insisted on our staying to tea.  The passengers on board were--a chief factor, [_The chief factorship is the highest rank attainable in the service, the chief trader being next_] who had been home on leave of absence, and was returning to end his days, perhaps, in the North-West; and Mr John Leagues, a young apprentice clerk, going, like myself, to try his fortune in Hudson Bay.  He was a fine, candid young fellow, full of spirit, with a kind, engaging disposition.  From the first moment I saw him I formed a friendship for him, which was destined to ripen into a lasting one many years after.  I sighed on parting from him that evening, thinking that we should never meet again; but about six years from the time I bade him farewell in Hudson Straits, I again grasped his hand on the shores of the mighty St. Lawrence, and renewed a friendship which afforded me the greatest pleasure I enjoyed in the country, and which, I trust, neither time nor distance will ever lessen or destroy.  We spent the evening delightfully, the more so that we were not likely to have such an opportunity again, as the _Prince of Wales_ would shortly part company from us, and direct her course to Moose Factory, in James Bay, while we should proceed across Hudson Bay to York Factory. We left the ship just as a few cats-paws on the surface of the water gave indications of a coming breeze.  Ice now began to surround us in all directions; and soon after this I saw, for the first time, that monster of the Polar Seas, an iceberg.  It was a noble sight.  We passed quite close, and had a fine opportunity of observing it.  Though not so large as they are frequently seen, it was beautifully and fantastically formed.  High peaks rose from it on various places, and down its sides streams of water and miniature cataracts flowed in torrents.  The whole mass was of a delicate greenish-white colour, and its lofty pinnacles sparkled in the moonbeams as it floated past, bending majestically in the swell of the ocean. About this time, too, we met numerous fields and floes of ice, to get through which we often experienced considerable difficulty.  My favourite amusement, as we thus threaded our way through the ice, was to ascend to the royal-yard, and there to sit and cogitate whilst gazing on the most beautiful and romantic scenes.  It is impossible to convey a correct idea of the beauty, the magnificence, of some of the scenes through which we passed.  Sometimes thousands of the most grotesque, fanciful, and beautiful icebergs and icefields surrounded us on all sides, intersected by numerous serpentine canals, which glittered in the sun (for the weather was fine nearly all the time we were in the straits), like threads of silver twining round ruined palaces of crystal.  The masses assumed every variety of form and size; and many of them bore such a striking resemblance to cathedrals, churches, columns, arches, and spires, that I could almost fancy we had been transported to one of the floating cities of Fairyland.  The rapid motion, too, of our ship, in what appeared a dead calm, added much to the magical effect of the scene.  A light but steady breeze urged her along with considerable velocity through a maze of ponds and canals, which, from the immense quantity of ice that surrounded them, were calm and unruffled as the surface of a mill-pond.  Not a sound disturbed the delightful stillness of nature, save the gentle rippling of the vessel's bow as she sped on her way, or the occasional puffing of a lazy whale, awakened from a nap by our unceremonious intrusion on his domains.  Now and then, however, my reveries were interrupted by the ship coming into sudden contact with huge lumps of ice.  This happened occasionally when we arrived at the termination of one of those natural canals through which we passed, and found it necessary to force our way into the next.  These concussions were occasionally very severe--so much so, at times, as to make the ship's bell ring; but we heeded this little, as the vessel was provided with huge blocks of timber on her bows, called ice-pieces, and was, besides, built expressly for sailing in the northern seas.  It only became annoying at meal-times, when a spoonful of soup would sometimes make a little private excursion of its own over the shoulder of the owner instead of into his mouth.  As we proceeded, the ice became more closely packed, and at last compelled us to bore through it.  The ship, however, was never altogether arrested, though often much retarded.  I recollect, while thus surrounded, filling a bucket with water from a pool on the ice, to see whether it was fresh or not, as I had been rather sceptical upon this point.  It was excellent, and might almost compete with the water from the famous spring of Crawley.  In a few days we got out of the ice altogether; and in this, as the ships are frequently detained for weeks in the straits, we considered ourselves very fortunate.  We all experienced at this time a severe disappointment in the non-appearance of the Esquimaux from the coast.  The captain said they would be sure to come off to us, as they had always been in the habit of doing so, for the purpose of exchanging ivory and oil for saws, files, needles, etcetera, a large chestful of which is put on board annually for this purpose.  The ivory usually procured from them is walrus tusks. These are not very large, and are of inferior quality.  As we approached the shores of the straits, we shortened sail and fired three or four guns, but no noisy \"_chimo_\" floated across the water in answer to our salute; still we lingered for a while, but, as there was no sign of the natives on shore, the captain concluded they had gone off to the interior, and he steered out to sea again.  I was very much disappointed at this, as it was wholly unexpected, and Wiseacre and I had promised ourselves much pleasure in trading with them; for which purpose all the buttons of our old waistcoats had been amputated.  It was useless, however, to repine, so I contented myself with the hope that they would yet visit us in some other part of the straits.  We afterwards learned that our guns had attracted them to the coast in time to board the _Prince Albert_ (which was out of sight astern), though too late for us.  The passage across Hudson Bay was stormy, but no one on board cared for this, all having become accustomed to rough weather.  For my part, I had become quite a sailor, and could ascend and descend easily to the truck without creeping through the _lubber's hole_.  I shall not forget the first time I attempted this: our youngest apprentice had challenged me to try it, so up we went together--he on the fore and I on the main mast.  The tops were gained easily, and we even made two or three steps up the top-mast shrouds with affected indifference; but, alas! our courage was failing--at least _mine_ was--very fast.  However, we gained the cross-trees pretty well, and then sat down for a little to recover breath.  The topgallant-mast still reared its taper form high above me, and the worst was yet to come.  The top-gallant shrouds had no ratlines on them, so I was obliged to _shin_ up; and, as I worked myself up the two small ropes, the tenacity with which I grasped them was fearful.  At last I reached the top, and with my feet on the small collar that fastens the ropes to the mast, and my arms circling the mast itself--for nothing but a bare pole, crossed by the royal-yard, now rose above me--I glanced upwards.  After taking a long breath, and screwing up my courage, I slowly shinned up the slender pole, and, standing on the royal-yard, laid my hand upon the _truck_.  After a time I became accustomed to it, and thought nothing of taking an airing on the royal-yard after breakfast.  About the 5th or 6th of August, the captain said we must be near the land.  The deep-sea lead was rigged, and a sharp lookout kept, but no land appeared.  At last, one fine day, while at the mast-head, I saw something like land on the horizon, and told them so on deck.  They saw it too, but gave me no answer.  Soon a hurried order to \"Dowse top-gallant-sails and reef top-sails\" made me slide down rather hastily from my elevated position.  I had scarcely gained the deck, when a squall, the severest we had yet encountered, struck the ship, laying her almost on her beam-ends; and the sea, which had been nearly calm a few minutes before, foamed and hissed like a seething caldron, and became white as snow.  This, I believe, was what sailors call a _white squall_. It was as short as it was severe, and great was our relief when the ship regained her natural position in the water.  Next day we saw land in earnest, and in the afternoon anchored in \"Five Fathom Hole,\" after passing in safety a sandbar, which renders the entrance into this roadstead rather difficult.  Here, then, for the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21758"],["title","Hudson Bay (#4)"],["body","time I beheld the shores of Hudson Bay; and truly their appearance was anything but prepossessing.  Though only at the distance of two miles, so low and flat was the land, that it appeared ten miles off, and scarcely a tree was to be seen.  We could just see the tops of one or two houses in York Factory, the principal depot of the country, which was seven miles up the river at the mouth of which we lay.  In a short time the sails of a small schooner came in sight, and in half an hour more the _Frances_ (named after the amiable lady of the governor, Sir George Simpson) was riding alongside.  The skipper came on board, and immediately there commenced between him and the captain a sharp fire of questions and answers, which roused me from a slumber in which I had been indulging, and hurried me on deck. Here the face of things had changed.  The hatches were off, and bales of goods were scattered about in all directions.  Another small schooner had arrived, and the process of discharging the vessel was going rapidly forward.  A boat was then dispatched to the factory with the packet-box and letter-bag, and soon after the _Frances_ stood in for the shore.  The _Prince Albert_ had arrived almost at the same moment with the _Prince Rupert_, and was now visited by the second schooner, which soon returned to our ship to take the passengers on shore.  The passengers who came out in the _Prince Albert_ were on board--namely, the Reverend Mr Gowley, a clergyman of the Church of England, and his lady; and Mr Rob, a sort of catechist, or semi-clerical schoolmaster.  They were missionaries bound for Red River Colony; and as I had some prospect of going there myself, I was delighted to have the probable chance of travelling with companions who, from the short survey I had of them while they conversed with the captain and Mr Carles, seemed good-natured and agreeable.  Mr Carles, Mr Wiseacre, and I now bade adieu to the good ship which had been our home for such a length of time (but I must say I did not regret the parting), and followed our baggage on board the schooner, expecting to reach the factory before dusk.  \"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip,\" is a proverb well authenticated and often quoted, and on the present occasion its truth was verified.  We had not been long under weigh before the ebb tide began to run so strong against us as to preclude the possibility of our reaching the shore that night. There was no help for it, however; so down went the anchor to the bottom, and down went I to the cabin.  Such a cabin!  A good-sized trunk, with a small table in it, and the lid shut down, had about as much right to the name.  It was awfully small-- even _I_ could not stand upright in it, though at the time I had scarcely attained to the altitude of five feet; yet here were we destined to pass the night--and a wretched night we did pass.  We got over the first part tolerably, but as it grew late our eyes grew heavy. We yawned, fidgeted and made superhuman efforts to keep awake and seem happy; but it would not do.  There were only two berths in the cabin; and, as so many gentlemen were present, Mrs Gowley would not get into either of them, but declared she would sit up all night.  The gentlemen, on the other hand, could not be so ungallant as to go to sleep while the only lady present sat up.  The case was desperate, and so I went off to the hold, intending to lie down on a bale, if I could find one.  In my search I tumbled over something soft, which gave vent to a frightful howl, and proved to be no less a personage than Mr Wiseacre, who had anticipated me, and found a convenient place whereon to lie.  My search, however, was less successful.  Not a corner big enough for a cat to sleep in was to be found, all the goods having been flung hastily into the hold, so that it was a chaos of box corners, stove legs, edges of kegs and casks, which presented a surface that put to flight all hope of horizontal repose; so I was obliged to return to the cabin, where I found the unhappy inmates winking and blinking at each other like owls in the sunshine.  \"You had better make use of one of these berths, my young friend,\" said Mr Gowley, with a bland smile, as I entered; \"you seem very much overcome with sleep, and _we_ have resolved to sit up all night.\"  \"Do get in,\" urged Mrs Gowley, who was a sweet, gentle creature, and seemed much too delicate and fragile to stand the rough life that was likely to be the lot of the wife of a missionary to the Red men of the Far North; \"I do not intend to lie down to-night; and besides, it will soon be morning.\"  A sweet but very sleepy smile flitted across her face as she spoke.  Of course, I protested against this with great vehemence, assuring them that I could not think of anything so ungallant, and that I meant to sit it out manfully with the rest.  Mr Rob, who was a comical little Welshman, of about thirty years of age, with a sharp, snub nose, which was decorated with spectacles, sat huddled up in a corner, immersed in sleepiness to such an extent that he would not have smiled for worlds, and spent the weary hours in vain efforts to keep his head on his shoulders--an object, apparently, of some difficulty, seeing that it swayed backwards and forwards and round about like that of a Chinese mandarin!  For a few minutes I sat gazing steadfastly at the revolving object before me, when my own head became similarly affected, and fell suddenly back against the bulk-head with a tremendous crash, wakening them all up, and causing Mr Rob to stare at me with an expression of vacant gravity, mingled with surprise, which slowly and gradually faded away again as sleep reasserted its irresistible power.  Flesh and blood could not stand this.  I would have lain down on the table, but poor Mrs Gowley's head already covered the greater part of that; or on the floor, but, alas! it was too small.  At last I began to reason thus with myself: \"Here are two capital beds, with nobody in them; it is the height of folly to permit them to remain empty; but then, what a selfish-looking thing to leave Mrs Gowley sitting up! After all, she _won't_ go to bed.  Oh dear! what _is_ to be done?\" (Bang went the head again.) \"You'd better turn in,\" said Mr Gowley. Again I protested that I could not think of it; but my eyes would not keep open to look him in the face.  At last my scruples--I blush to say it--were overcome, and I allowed myself to be half forced into the berth; while Mr Rob, whose self-denial could endure no longer, took advantage of the confusion thus occasioned, and vanished into the other like a harlequin.  Poor Mr and Mrs Gowley laid their innocent heads side by side upon the table, and snored in concert.  How long I slept I know not, but long before day a tremendous thumping awoke me, and after I had collected my faculties enough to understand it, I found that the schooner was grounding as the tide receded.  \"Oh!\" thought I; and, being utterly incapable of thinking more, I fell back on the pillow again, sound asleep, and did not awake till long after daybreak.  Next morning was beautiful; but we were still aground, and, from what the skipper said, there appeared to be no prospect of getting ashore till the afternoon.  Our patience, however, was not tried so long; for, early in the day, a boat came off from the factory to take us ashore: but the missionaries preferred remaining in the schooner.  Mr Carles, young Wiseacre, and I gladly availed ourselves of the opportunity, and were soon sailing with a fair breeze up Hayes River.  We approached to within a few yards of the shore; and I formed, at first sight, a very poor opinion of the country which, two years later, I was destined to traverse full many a mile in search of the feathered inhabitants of the marshes.  The Point of Marsh, which was the first land we made, was quite low-- only a few feet above the sea--and studded here and there with thick willows, but not a single tree.  Long lank grass covered it in every place, affording ducks and geese shelter, in the autumn and spring.  In the centre of it stood the ship-beacon--a tall, ungainly-looking pile, which rose upwards like a monster out of the water.  Altogether, a more desolate prospect could not well be imagined.  The banks of Hayes River are formed of clay, and they improved a little in verdure as we ascended; but still, wherever the eye turned, the same universal flatness met the gaze.  The river was here about two miles wide, and filled with shallows and sandbanks, which render the navigation difficult for vessels above fifty tons.  As we proceeded, a small bark canoe, with an Indian and his wife in it, glided swiftly past us; and this was the first Indian, and the first of these slender craft, I had seen.  Afterwards, I became more intimately acquainted with them than was altogether agreeable.  In a short time we reached the wooden wharf, which, owing to the smallness of everything else in the vicinity, had rather an imposing look, and projected a long way into the water; but our boat passed this and made for a small slip, on which two or three gentlemen waited to receive us.  My voyage was ended.  The boat's keel grated harshly on the gravel; the next moment my feet once more pressed _terra firma_, and I stood at last on the shores of the New World, a stranger in a strange land.  I do not intend to give a minute description of York Factory here, as a full account of it will be found in a succeeding chapter, and shall, therefore, confine myself to a slight sketch of the establishment, and our proceedings there during a stay of about three weeks.  York Factory is the principal depot of the Northern department, from whence all the supplies for the trade are issued, and where all the furs of the district are collected and shipped for England.  As may be supposed, then, the establishment is a large one.  There are always between thirty and forty men resident at the post, [_The word \"_pos"]]]
