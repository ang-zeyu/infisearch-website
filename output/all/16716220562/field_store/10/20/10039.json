The first issue of MOTHER EARTH appeared in the month of March, 1906, the initial expenses of the periodical partly covered by the proceeds of a theater benefit given by Orleneff, Mme. Nazimova, and their company, in favor of the Anarchist magazine.  Under tremendous difficulties and obstacles the tireless propagandist has succeeded in continuing MOTHER EARTH uninterruptedly since 1906--an achievement rarely equalled in the annals of radical publications.  In May, 1906, Alexander Berkman at last left the hell of Pennsylvania, where he had passed the best fourteen years of his life.  No one had believed in the possibility of his survival.  His liberation terminated a nightmare of fourteen years for Emma Goldman, and an important chapter of her career was thus concluded.  Nowhere had the birth of the Russian revolution aroused such vital and active response as among the Russians living in America.  The heroes of the revolutionary movement in Russia, Tchaikovsky, Mme. Breshkovskaia, Gershuni, and others visited these shores to waken the sympathies of the American people toward the struggle for liberty, and to collect aid for its continuance and support.  The success of these efforts was to a considerable extent due to the exertions, eloquence, and the talent for organization on the part of Emma Goldman.  This opportunity enabled her to give valuable services to the struggle for liberty in her native land.  It is not generally known that it is the Anarchists who are mainly instrumental in insuring the success, moral as well as financial, of most of the radical undertakings.  The Anarchist is indifferent to acknowledged appreciation; the needs of the Cause absorb his whole interest, and to these he devotes his energy and abilities.  Yet it may be mentioned that some otherwise decent folks, though at all times anxious for Anarchist support and co-operation, are ever willing to monopolize all the credit for the work done.  During the last several decades it was chiefly the Anarchists who had organized all the great revolutionary efforts, and aided in every struggle for liberty.  But for fear of shocking the respectable mob, who looks upon the Anarchists as the apostles of Satan, and because of their social position in bourgeois society, the would-be radicals ignore the activity of the Anarchists.  In 1907 Emma Goldman participated as delegate to the second Anarchist Congress, at Amsterdam.  She was intensely active in all its proceedings and supported the organization of the Anarchist INTERNATIONALE.  Together with the other American delegate, Max Baginski, she submitted to the congress an exhaustive report of American conditions, closing with the following characteristic remarks:   \"The charge that Anarchism is destructive, rather than constructive, and that, therefore, Anarchism is opposed to organization, is one of the many falsehoods spread by our opponents.  They confound our present social institutions with organization; hence they fail to understand how we can oppose the former, and yet favor the latter. The fact, however, is that the two are not identical.  \"The State is commonly regarded as the highest form of organization. But is it in reality a true organization?  Is it not rather an arbitrary institution, cunningly imposed upon the masses?  \"Industry, too, is called an organization; yet nothing is farther from the truth.  Industry is the ceaseless piracy of the rich against the poor.  \"We are asked to believe that the Army is an organization, but a close investigation will show that it is nothing else than a cruel instrument of blind force.  \"The Public School!  The colleges and other institutions of learning, are they not models of organization, offering the people fine opportunities for instruction?  Far from it.  The school, more than any other institution, is a veritable barrack, where the human mind is drilled and manipulated into submission to various social and moral spooks, and thus fitted to continue our system of exploitation and oppression.  \"Organization, as WE understand it, however, is a different thing. It is based, primarily, on freedom.  It is a natural and voluntary grouping of energies to secure results beneficial to humanity.  \"It is the harmony of organic growth which produces variety of color and form, the complete whole we admire in the flower.  Analogously will the organized activity of free human beings, imbued with the spirit of solidarity, result in the perfection of social harmony, which we call Anarchism.  In fact, Anarchism alone makes non-authoritarian organization of common interests possible, since it abolishes the existing antagonism between individuals and classes.  \"Under present conditions the antagonism of economic and social interests results in relentless war among the social units, and creates an insurmountable obstacle in the way of a co-operative commonwealth.  \"There is a mistaken notion that organization does not foster individual freedom; that, on the contrary, it means the decay of individuality.  In reality, however, the true function of organization is to aid the development and growth of personality.  \"Just as the animal cells, by mutual co-operation, express their latent powers in formation of the complete organism, so does the individual, by co-operative effort with other individuals, attain his highest form of development.  \"An organization, in the true sense, cannot result from the combination of mere nonentities.  It must be composed of self-conscious, intelligent individualities.  Indeed, the total of the possibilities and activities of an organization is represented in the expression of individual energies.  \"It therefore logically follows that the greater the number of strong, self-conscious personalities in an organization, the less danger of stagnation, and the more intense its life element.  \"Anarchism asserts the possibility of an organization without discipline, fear, or punishment, and without the pressure of poverty: a new social organism which will make an end to the terrible struggle for the means of existence,--the savage struggle which undermines the finest qualities in man, and ever widens the social abyss.  In short, Anarchism strives towards a social organization which will establish well-being for all.  \"The germ of such an organization can be found in that form of trades unionism which has done away with centralization, bureaucracy, and discipline, and which favors independent and direct action on the part of its members.\"   The very considerable progress of Anarchist ideas in America can best be gauged by the remarkable success of the three extensive lecture tours of Emma Goldman since the Amsterdam Congress of 1907.  Each tour extended over new territory, including localities where Anarchism had never before received a hearing.  But the most gratifying aspect of her untiring efforts is the tremendous sale of Anarchist literature, whose propagandist effect cannot be estimated. It was during one of these tours that a remarkable incident happened, strikingly demonstrating the inspiring potentialities of the Anarchist idea.  In San Francisco, in 1908, Emma Goldman's lecture attracted a soldier of the United States Army, William Buwalda.  For daring to attend an Anarchist meeting, the free Republic court-martialed Buwalda and imprisoned him for one year.  Thanks to the regenerating power of the new philosophy, the government lost a soldier, but the cause of liberty gained a man.   A propagandist of Emma Goldman's importance is necessarily a sharp thorn to the reaction.  She is looked upon as a danger to the continued existence of authoritarian usurpation.  No wonder, then, that the enemy resorts to any and all means to make her impossible. A systematic attempt to suppress her activities was organized a year ago by the united police force of the country.  But like all previous similar attempts, it failed in a most brilliant manner.  Energetic protests on the part of the intellectual element of America succeeded in overthrowing the dastardly conspiracy against free speech. Another attempt to make Emma Goldman impossible was essayed by the Federal authorities at Washington.  In order to deprive her of the rights of citizenship, the government revoked the citizenship papers of her husband, whom she had married at the youthful age of eighteen, and whose whereabouts, if he be alive, could not be determined for the last two decades.  The great government of the glorious United States did not hesitate to stoop to the most despicable methods to accomplish that achievement.  But as her citizenship had never proved of use to Emma Goldman, she can bear the loss with a light heart.   There are personalities who possess such a powerful individuality that by its very force they exert the most potent influence over the best representatives of their time.  Michael Bakunin was such a personality.  But for him, Richard Wagner had never written DIE KUNST UND DIE REVOLUTION.  Emma Goldman is a similar personality.  She is a strong factor in the socio-political life of America.  By virtue of her eloquence, energy, and brilliant mentality, she moulds the minds and hearts of thousands of her auditors.  Deep sympathy and compassion for suffering humanity, and an inexorable honesty toward herself, are the leading traits of Emma Goldman.  No person, whether friend or foe, shall presume to control her goal or dictate her mode of life.  She would perish rather than sacrifice her convictions, or the right of self-ownership of soul and body.  Respectability could easily forgive the teaching of theoretic Anarchism; but Emma Goldman does not merely preach the new philosophy; she also persists in living it,--and that is the one supreme, unforgivable crime.  Were she, like so many radicals, to consider her ideal as merely an intellectual ornament; were she to make concessions to existing society and compromise with old prejudices,--then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],["title","Anarchism and Other Essays (#6)"],["body"," the most radical views could be pardoned in her.  But that she takes her radicalism seriously; that it has permeated her blood and marrow to the extent where she not merely teaches but also practices her convictions--this shocks even the radical Mrs. Grundy.  Emma Goldman lives her own life; she associates with publicans--hence the indignation of the Pharisees and Sadducees.  It is no mere coincidence that such divergent writers as Pietro Gori and William Marion Reedy find similar traits in their characterization of Emma Goldman.  In a contribution to LA QUESTIONE SOCIALE, Pietro Gori calls her a \"moral power, a woman who, with the vision of a sibyl, prophesies the coming of a new kingdom for the oppressed; a woman who, with logic and deep earnestness, analyses the ills of society, and portrays, with artist touch, the coming dawn of humanity, founded on equality, brotherhood, and liberty.\"  William Reedy sees in Emma Goldman the \"daughter of the dream, her gospel a vision which is the vision of every truly great-souled man and woman who has ever lived.\"  Cowards who fear the consequences of their deeds have coined the word of philosophic Anarchism.  Emma Goldman is too sincere, too defiant, to seek safety behind such paltry pleas.  She is an Anarchist, pure and simple.  She represents the idea of Anarchism as framed by Josiah Warrn, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Tolstoy.  Yet she also understands the psychologic causes which induce a Caserio, a Vaillant, a Bresci, a Berkman, or a Czolgosz to commit deeds of violence.  To the soldier in the social struggle it is a point of honor to come in conflict with the powers of darkness and tyranny, and Emma Goldman is proud to count among her best friends and comrades men and women who bear the wounds and scars received in battle.  In the words of Voltairine de Cleyre, characterizing Emma Goldman after the latter's imprisonment in 1893: The spirit that animates Emma Goldman is the only one which will emancipate the slave from his slavery, the tyrant from his tyranny--the spirit which is willing to dare and suffer.  HIPPOLYTE HAVEL.  New York, December, 1910.     PREFACE   Some twenty-one years ago I heard the first great Anarchist speaker--the inimitable John Most.  It seemed to me then, and for many years after, that the spoken word hurled forth among the masses with such wonderful eloquence, such enthusiasm and fire, could never be erased from the human mind and soul.  How could any one of all the multitudes who flocked to Most's meetings escape his prophetic voice! Surely they had but to hear him to throw off their old beliefs, and see the truth and beauty of Anarchism!  My one great longing then was to be able to speak with the tongue of John Most,--that I, too, might thus reach the masses.  Oh, for the naivety of Youth's enthusiasm!  It is the time when the hardest thing seems but child's play.  It is the only period in life worth while. Alas!  This period is but of short duration.  Like Spring, the STURM UND DRANG period of the propagandist brings forth growth, frail and delicate, to be matured or killed according to its powers of resistance against a thousand vicissitudes.  My great faith in the wonder worker, the spoken word, is no more.  I have realized its inadequacy to awaken thought, or even emotion. Gradually, and with no small struggle against this realization, I came to see that oral propaganda is at best but a means of shaking people from their lethargy: it leaves no lasting impression.  The very fact that most people attend meetings only if aroused by newspaper sensations, or because they expect to be amused, is proof that they really have no inner urge to learn.  It is altogether different with the written mode of human expression. No one, unless intensely interested in progressive ideas, will bother with serious books.  That leads me to another discovery made after many years of public activity.  It is this: All claims of education notwithstanding, the pupil will accept only that which his mind craves.  Already this truth is recognized by most modern educators in relation to the immature mind.  I think it is equally true regarding the adult.  Anarchists or revolutionists can no more be made than musicians.  All that can be done is to plant the seeds of thought. Whether something vital will develop depends largely on the fertility of the human soil, though the quality of the intellectual seed must not be overlooked.  In meetings the audience is distracted by a thousand non-essentials. The speaker, though ever so eloquent, cannot escape the restlessness of the crowd, with the inevitable result that he will fail to strike root.  In all probability he will not even do justice to himself.  The relation between the writer and the reader is more intimate. True, books are only what we want them to be; rather, what we read into them.  That we can do so demonstrates the importance of written as against oral expression.  It is this certainty which has induced me to gather in one volume my ideas on various topics of individual and social importance.  They represent the mental and soul struggles of twenty-one years,--the conclusions derived after many changes and inner revisions.  I am not sanguine enough to hope that my readers will be as numerous as those who have heard me.  But I prefer to reach the few who really want to learn, rather than the many who come to be amused.  As to the book, it must speak for itself.  Explanatory remarks do but detract from the ideas set forth.  However, I wish to forestall two objections which will undoubtedly be raised.  One is in reference to the essay on ANARCHISM; the other, on MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.  \"Why do you not say how things will be operated under Anarchism?\" is a question I have had to meet thousands of times.  Because I believe that Anarchism can not consistently impose an iron-clad program or method on the future.  The things every new generation has to fight, and which it can least overcome, are the burdens of the past, which holds us all as in a net.  Anarchism, at least as I understand it, leaves posterity free to develop its own particular systems, in harmony with its needs.  Our most vivid imagination can not foresee the potentialities of a race set free from external restraints. How, then, can any one assume to map out a line of conduct for those to come?  We, who pay dearly for every breath of pure, fresh air, must guard against the tendency to fetter the future.  If we succeed in clearing the soil from the rubbish of the past and present, we will leave to posterity the greatest and safest heritage of all ages.  The most disheartening tendency common among readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a criterion of the writer's ideas or personality.  Friedrich Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the weak because he believed in the UEBERMENSCH.  It does not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant mind that this vision of the UEBERMENSCH also called for a state of society which will not give birth to a race of weaklings and slaves.  It is the same narrow attitude which sees in Max Stirner naught but the apostle of the theory \"each for himself, the devil take the hind one.\"  That Stirner's individualism contains the greatest social possibilities is utterly ignored.  Yet, it is nevertheless true that if society is ever to become free, it will be so through liberated individuals, whose free efforts make society.  These examples bring me to the objection that will be raised to MINORITIES VERSUS MAJORITIES.  No doubt, I shall be excommunicated as an enemy of the people, because I repudiate the mass as a creative factor.  I shall prefer that rather than be guilty of the demagogic platitudes so commonly in vogue as a bait for the people.  I realize the malady of the oppressed and disinherited masses only too well, but I refuse to prescribe the usual ridiculous palliatives which allow the patient neither to die nor to recover.  One cannot be too extreme in dealing with social ills; besides, the extreme thing is generally the true thing.  My lack of faith in the majority is dictated by my faith in the potentialities of the individual.  Only when the latter becomes free to choose his associates for a common purpose, can we hope for order and harmony out of this world of chaos and inequality.  For the rest, my book must speak for itself.  Emma Goldman     ANARCHISM: WHAT IT REALLY STANDS FOR                              ANARCHY.            Ever reviled, accursed, ne'er understood,             Thou art the grisly terror of our age.           \"Wreck of all order,\" cry the multitude,             \"Art thou, and war and murder's endless rage.\"           O, let them cry. To them that ne'er have striven             The truth that lies behind a word to find,           To them the word's right meaning was not given.             They shall continue blind among the blind.           But thou, O word, so clear, so strong, so pure,             Thou sayest all which I for goal have taken.           I give thee to the future! Thine secure             When each at least unto himself shall waken.           Comes it in sunshine? In the tempest's thrill?             I cannot tell--but it the earth shall see!           I am an Anarchist! Wherefore I will             Not rule, and also ruled I will not be!                                         JOHN HENRY MACKAY.   The history of human growth and development is at the same time the history of the terrible struggle of every new idea heralding the approach of a brighter dawn.  In its tenacious hold on tradition, the Old has never hesitated to make use of the foulest and cruelest means to stay the advent of the New, in whatever form or period the latter may have asserted itself.  Nor need we retrace our steps into the distant past to realize the enormity of opposition, difficulties, and hardships placed in the path of every progressive idea.  The rack, the"]]]
