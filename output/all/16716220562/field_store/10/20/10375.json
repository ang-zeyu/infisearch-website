They now explained to their entertainer all the circumstances attending the capture of the Firefly, and their subsequent adventures and vicissitudes in the forest; all of which Barney detailed in a most graphic manner, and to all of which their new friend listened with grave attention and unbroken silence.  When they had concluded he said,--\"Very good.  You have seen much in very short time.  Perhaps you shall see more by-and-by.  For the present you will go to rest, for you must be fatigued.  I will _think_ to-night,--to-morrow I will _speak_.\"  \"An', if I may make so bould,\" said Barney, glancing with a somewhat rueful expression round the hard earthen floor of the hut, \"whereabouts may I take the liberty o' sleepin'?\"  The hermit replied by going to a corner, whence, from beneath a heap of rubbish, he dragged two hammocks, curiously wrought in a sort of light net-work.  These he slung across the hut at one end, from wall to wall, and, throwing a sheet or coverlet into each, he turned with a smile to his visitors,--\"Behold your beds!  I wish you a very good sleep,-- adios!\"  So saying, this strange individual sat down at the table, and was soon as deeply engaged with his large book as if he had suffered no interruption; while Martin and Barney, having gazed gravely and abstractedly at him for five minutes, turned and smiled to each other, jumped into their hammocks, and were soon buried in deep slumber.    CHAPTER TEN.  AN ENEMY IN THE NIGHT--THE VAMPIRE BAT--THE HERMIT DISCOURSES ON STRANGE, AND CURIOUS, AND INTERESTING THINGS.  Next morning Martin Rattler awoke with a feeling of lightness in his head, and a sensation of extreme weakness pervading his entire frame. Turning his head round to the right he observed that a third hammock was slung across the further end of the hut; which was, no doubt, that in which the hermit had passed the night.  But it was empty now.  Martin did not require to turn his head to the other side to see if Barney O'Flannagan was there, for that worthy individual made his presence known, for a distance of at least sixty yards all round the outside of the hut, by means of his nose, which he was in the habit of using as a trumpet when asleep.  It was as well that Martin did not require to look round; for he found, to his surprise, that he had scarcely strength to do so.  While he was wondering in a dreamy sort of manner what could be the matter with him, the hermit entered the hut bearing a small deer upon his shoulders.  Resting his gun in a corner of the room, he advanced to Martin's hammock.  \"My boy,\" he exclaimed, in surprise, \"what is wrong with you?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Martin, faintly; \"I think there is something wet about my feet.\"  Turning up the sheet, he found that Martin's feet were covered with blood!  For a few seconds the hermit growled forth a number of apparently very pithy sentences in Portuguese, in a deep guttural voice, which awakened Barney with a start.  Springing from his hammock with a bound like a tiger, he exclaimed, \"Och! ye blackguard, would ye murther the boy before me very nose?\" and seizing the hermit in his powerful grasp, he would infallibly have hurled him, big though he was, through his own doorway, had not Martin cried out, \"Stop, stop, Barney.  It's all right; he's done nothing:\" on hearing which the Irishman loosened his hold, and turned towards his friend.  \"What's the matter, honey?\" said Barney, in a soothing tone of voice, as a mother might address her infant son.  The hermit whose composure had not been in the slightest degree disturbed, here said--\"The poor child has been sucked by a vampire bat.\"  \"Ochone!\" groaned Barney, sitting down on the table, and looking at his host with a face of horror.  \"Yes, these are the worst animals in Brazil for sucking the blood of men and cattle.  I find it quite impossible to keep my mules alive, they are so bad.\"  Barney groaned.  \"They have killed two cows which I tried to keep here, and one young horse--a foal you call him, I think; and now I have no cattle remaining, they are so bad.\"  Barney groaned again, and the hermit went on to enumerate the wicked deeds of the vampire-bats, while he applied poultices of certain herbs to Martin's toe, in order to check the bleeding, and then bandaged it up; after which he sat down to relate to his visitors, the manner in which the bat carries on its bloody operations.  He explained, first of all, that the vampire-bats are so large and ferocious that they often kill horses and cattle by sucking their blood out.  Of course they cannot do this at one meal, but they attack the poor animals again and again, and the blood continues to flow from the wounds they make long afterwards, so that the creatures attacked soon grow weak and die.  They attack men, too,--as Martin knew to his cost; and they usually fix upon the toes and other extremities.  So gentle are they in their operations, that sleepers frequently do not feel the puncture, which they make, it is supposed, with the sharp hooked nail of their thumb; and the unconscious victim knows nothing of the enemy who has been draining his blood until he awakens, faint and exhausted, in the morning.  Moreover, the hermit told them that these vampire-bats have very sharp, carnivorous teeth, besides a tongue, which is furnished with the curious organs, by which they suck the lifeblood of their fellow-creatures; that they have a peculiar, leaf-like, overhanging lip; and that he had a stuffed specimen of a bat that measured no less than two feet across the expanded wings, from tip to tip.  \"Och, the blood-thirsty spalpeen!\" exclaimed Barney, as he rose and crossed the room to examine the bat in question, which was nailed against the wall.  \"Bad luck to them, they've ruined Martin intirely.\"  \"O no,\" remarked the hermit with a smile.  \"It will do the boy much good, the loss of the blood; much good, and he will not be sick at all to-morrow.\"  \"I'm glad to hear you say so,\" said Martin, \"for it would be a great bore to be obliged to lie here when I've so many things to see.  In fact I feel better already, and if you will be so kind as to give me a little breakfast I shall be quite well.\"  While Martin was speaking, the obliging hermit--who, by the way, was now habited in a loose short hunting-coat of brown cotton,--spread a plentiful repast upon his table; to which, having assisted Martin to get out of his hammock, they all proceeded to do ample justice: for the travellers were very hungry after the fatigue of the previous day; and as for the hermit, he looked like a man whose appetite was always sharp set, and whose food agreed with him.  They had cold meat of several kinds, and a hot steak of venison just killed that morning, which the hermit cooked while his guests were engaged with the other viands.  There was also excellent coffee, and superb cream, besides cakes made of a species of coarse flour or meal, fruits of various kinds, and very fine honey.  \"Arrah! ye've the hoith o' livin' here!\" cried Barney, smacking his lips as he held out his plate for another supply of a species of meat which resembled chicken in tenderness and flavour.  \"What sort o' bird or baste may that be, now, av' I may ask ye, Mister--what's yer name?\"  \"My name is Carlos,\" replied the hermit, gravely; \"and this is the flesh of the armadillo.\"  \"Arms-what-o?\" inquired Barney.  \"_Armadillo_,\" repeated the hermit.  \"He is very good to eat but very difficult to catch.  He digs down so fast we cannot catch him, and must smoke him out of his hole.\"  \"Have you many cows?\" inquired Martin, as he replenished his cup with coffee.  \"Cows?\" echoed the hermit, \"I have got no cows.\"  \"Where do you get such capital cream, then?\" asked Martin in surprise.  The hermit smiled.  \"Ah! my friends, that cream has come from a very curious cow.  It is from a cow that grows in the ground.\"  \"Grows!\" ejaculated his guests.  \"Yes, he grows.  I will show him to you one day.\"  The hermit's broad shoulders shook with a quiet internal laugh.  \"I will explain a little of that you behold on my table.\"  \"The coffee I get from the trees.  There are plenty of them here.  Much money is made in Brazil by the export of coffee,--very much.  The cakes are made from the mandioca-root which I grow near my house.  The root is dried and ground into flour, which, under the general name _farina_, is used all over the country.  It is almost the only food used by the Indians and Negroes.\"  \"Then there are Injins and Niggers here, are there?\" inquired Barney.  \"Yes, a great many.  Most of the Negroes are slaves; some of the Indians too; and the people who are descended from the Portuguese who came and took the country long ago, they are the masters.--Well, the honey I get in holes in the trees.  There are different kinds of honey here; some of it is _sour_ honey.  And the fruits and roots, the plantains, and bananas, and yams, and cocoa-nuts, and oranges, and plums, all grow in the forest and much more besides, which you will see for yourselves if you stay long here.\"  \"It's a quare country, intirely,\" remarked Barney, as he wiped his mouth and heaved a sigh of contentment.  Then, drawing his hand over his chin, he looked earnestly in the hermit's face, and, with a peculiar twinkle in his eye, said,--\"I s'pose ye couldn't favour me with the lind of a raazor, could ye?\"  \"No, my friend; I never use that foolish weapon.\"  \"Ah, well, as there's only monkeys and jaguars, and sich like to see me, it don't much signify; but my moustaches is gittin' mighty long, for I've been two weeks already without a shave.\"  Martin laughed heartily at the grave, anxious expression of his comrade's face.  \"Never mind, Barney,\" he said, \"a beard and moustache will improve you vastly.

Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the H.B.C.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.  One of these series is \"On the Coast\", which includes \"Saved by the Lifeboat\".

BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  AN ALGERINE STORY.  THE HERO IS BLOWN AWAY, CAPTURED, CRUSHED, COMFORTED, AND ASTONISHED.  One beautiful summer night, about the beginning of the present century, a young naval officer entered the public drawing-room of a hotel at Nice, and glanced round as if in search of some one.  Many people were assembled there--some in robust, others in delicate, health, many in that condition which rendered it doubtful to which class they belonged, but all engaged in the quiet buzz of conversation which, in such a place, is apt to set in after dinner.  The young Englishman, for such he evidently was, soon observed an elderly lady beckoning to him at the other end of the _salon_, and was quickly seated between her and a fragile girl whose hand he gently took hold of.  \"Mother,\" he said, to the elderly lady, \"I'm going to have a row on the Mediterranean.  The night is splendid, the air balmy, the stars gorgeous.\"  \"Now, George,\" interrupted the girl, with a little smile, \"don't be flowery.  We know all about that.\"  \"Too bad,\" returned the youth; \"I never rise to poetry in your presence, Minnie, without being snubbed.  But you cannot cure me.  Romance is too deeply ingrained in my soul.  Poetry flows from me like--like anything! I am a midshipman in the British Navy, a position which affords scope for the wildest enthusiasm, and--and--I'll astonish you yet, see if I don't.\"  \"I am sure you will, dear boy,\" said his mother; and she believed that he would!  \"Of course you will,\" added his sister; and she at least hoped that he would.  To say truth, there was nothing about the youth--as regards appearance or character--which rendered either the assurance or the hope unwarrantable.  He was not tall, but he was strong and active.  He was not exactly handsome, but he was possessed of a genial, hearty disposition, a playful spirit, and an earnest soul; also a modestly reckless nature which was quite captivating.  \"You won't be anxious about me, mother, if I don't return till pretty late,\" he said, rising.  \"I want a good long, refreshing pull, but I'll be back in time to say good-night to you, Minnie, before you go to sleep.\"  \"Your leave expires on Thursday, mind,\" said his sister; \"we cannot spare you long.\"  \"I shall be back in good time, trust me.  _Au revoir_,\" he said, with a pleasant nod, as he left the room.  And they did trust him; for our midshipman, George Foster, was trustworthy; but those \"circumstances\" over which people have \"no control\" are troublesome derangers of the affairs of man.  That was the last the mother and sister saw of George for the space of nearly two years!  Taking his way to the pebbly shore, young Foster hired a small boat, or punt, from a man who knew him well, declined the owner's services, pushed off, seized the oars, and rowed swiftly out to sea.  It was, as he had said, a splendid night.  The stars bespangled the sky like diamond-dust.  The water was as clear as a mirror, and the lights of Nice seemed to shoot far down into its depths.  The hum of the city came off with ever-deepening softness as the distance from the shore increased.  The occasional sound of oars was heard not far off, though boats and rowers were invisible, for there was no moon, and the night was dark notwithstanding the starlight.  There was no fear, however, of the young sailor losing himself while the city lights formed such a glorious beacon astern.  After pulling steadily for an hour or more he rested on his oars, gazed up at the bright heavens, and then at the land lights, which by that time resembled a twinkling line on the horizon.  \"Must 'bout ship now,\" he muttered.  \"Won't do to keep Minnie waiting.\"  As he rowed leisurely landward a sudden gust of wind from the shore shivered the liquid mirror into fragments.  It was the advance-guard of a squall which in a few minutes rushed down from the mountains of the Riviera and swept out upon the darkening sea.  Young Foster, as we have said, was strong.  He was noted among his fellows as a splendid oarsman.  The squall, therefore, did not disconcert him, though it checked his speed greatly.  After one or two lulls the wind increased to a gale, and in half an hour the youth found, with some anxiety, that he was making no headway against it.  The shore at that point was so much of a straight line as to render the hope of being able to slant-in a faint one.  As it was better, however, to attempt that than to row straight in the teeth of the gale, he diverged towards a point a little to the eastward of the port of Nice, and succeeded in making better way through the water, though he made no perceptible approach to land.  \"Pooh!  It's only a squall--be over in a minute,\" said the middy, by way of encouraging himself, as he glanced over his shoulder at the flickering lights, which were now barely visible.  He was wrong.  The gale increased.  Next time he glanced over his shoulder the lights were gone.  Dark clouds were gathering up from the northward, and a short jabble of sea was rising which occasionally sent a spurt of spray inboard.  Feeling now that his only chance of regaining the shore lay in a strong, steady, persevering pull straight towards it, he once more turned the bow of the little boat into the wind's eye, and gave way with a will.  But what could human muscle and human will, however powerful, do against a rampant nor'wester?  Very soon our hero was forced to rest upon his oars from sheer exhaustion, while his boat drifted slowly out to sea. Then the thought of his mother and Minnie flashed upon him, and, with a sudden gush, as it were, of renewed strength he resumed his efforts, and strained his powers to the uttermost--but all in vain.  Something akin to despair now seized on him, for the alternative was to drift out into the open sea, where no friendly island lay between him and the shores of Africa.  The necessity for active exertion, however, gave him no time either to rest or think.  As the distance from land increased the seas rose higher, and broke so frequently over the boat that it began to fill.  To stop rowing--at least, to the extent of keeping the bow to the wind--would have risked turning broadside-on, and being overturned or swamped; there was nothing, therefore, to be done in the circumstances except to keep the boat's head to the wind and drift.  In the midst of the rushing gale and surging seas he sat there, every gleam of hope almost extinguished, when there came to his mind a brief passage from the Bible--\"Hope thou in God.\"  Many a time had his mother tried, in days gone by, to impress that text on his mind, but apparently without success.  Now it arose before him like a beacon-star.  At the same time he thought of the possibility that he might be seen and picked up by a"]]]
