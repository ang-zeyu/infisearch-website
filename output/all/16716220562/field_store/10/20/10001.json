Within these last few years samples have been brought to England, and as the quantities must be inexhaustible, when they are sought for and found, no doubt it may one day become a valuable article of our carrying trade.  Here comes Mr Fairburn; I hope he intends to continue his notices of the Cape settlement.\"  \"They have interested me much, I must confess; he appears well acquainted with the colony.\"  \"He has had the advantage of a long residence, and during that time an insight into all the public documents: this you may be certain of, that he knows more than he will tell.\"  As soon as Mr Fairburn joined them, Alexander requested him to continue his narrative, which he did as follows.  \"You must not suppose, Mr Wilmot, that because the English had now possession of the colony, everything went right; governors who are appointed to the control of a colony require to be there some time before they can see with their own eyes; they must, from their want of information, fall into the hands of some interested party or another, who will sway their councils.  Thus it was at the Cape.  \"It is true that much good had already been done by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of the Hottentot; but this was effected, not by the colonial government, but by the representations of the missionaries and an influential and benevolent party at home.  The prejudices against the Hottentots, and particularly the Caffres, still existed, and were imbibed by the colonial authorities.  Commandoes, or, as they should be more properly termed, marauding parties, were still sent out, and the Caffre was continually oppressed, and, in defiance of the government orders, little justice could be obtained for the Hottentot, although his situation was somewhat improved.  \"I will give one instance to show how the rights of the Hottentots were respected by the Cape authorities in 1810,--previous to the emancipation, it is true, but still at a time when the position of the Hottentots and their sufferings had been strenuously pressed upon the colonial authorities by the government at home.  \"When the conduct of the Dutch boors had roused the Caffres and Hottentots to war, there were three brothers of the name of Stuurman, Hottentots, who were the leaders.  Peace was at length restored, which was chiefly effected by the exertions of these men, who retired peaceably with their own kraal to Algoa Bay; and the government, being then Dutch, appointed Stuurman as captain of the kraal.  This independent horde of Hottentots gave great offence to the Dutch boors,-- the more so as the three brothers had been the leaders of the Hottentots in the former insurrection.  For seven years they could find no complaint to make against them, until at last two of his Hottentots, who had engaged to serve a boor for a certain time, went back to the kraal at the expiration of the term, against the wish of the boor, who would have detained them; the boor went and demanded them back, but Stuurman refused to give them up; upon which, although justice was clearly on the side of the Hottentots, an armed force was despatched to the kraal. Stuurman still refused to surrender the men, and the armed force retired, for they knew the courage of the Hottentots, and were afraid to attack them.  \"By treachery they gained possession of Stuurman and one of his brothers (the other having been killed hunting the buffalo), and sent them to Cape Town, from whence, against all justice, they were sent as prisoners to Robin Island, where malefactors are confined.  They made their escape, and returned to Caffre-land.  Three years afterwards, Stuurman, anxious to see his family, returned to the colony without permission. He was discovered and apprehended, and sent as a convict to New South Wales; for the government was at that time English.  \"Such was the fate of the first Hottentot who stood up for the rights of his countrymen, and such was the conduct of the English colonial government; so you will observe, Mr Wilmot, that although the strides of cruelty and oppression are most rapid, the return to even-handed justice is equally slow.  Eventually the gross injustice to this man was acknowledged, for an order from the home government was procured for his liberation and return; but it was too late,--Stuurman had died a convict.  \"I have mentioned this circumstance, as it will prepare you for a similar act of injustice to the Caffres.  When the colony was in possession of the Dutch, there was a space of about thirty thousand square miles between the colonial boundary (that is, the land formerly possessed by the Hottentots) and the Great Fish River.  This extent of thirty thousand square miles belonged to the Caffres, and was the site of continual skirmishing and marauding between the Dutch boors and the Caffres.  \"In 1811 it was resolved by the colonial government that the Caffres should be driven from this territory, and confined to the other side of the Great Fish River.  This was an act of injustice and great hardship, and was proceeded in with extreme cruelty, the Caffres being obliged to leave all their crops, and turned out with great and unnecessary slaughter.  \"It may be proper, however, to state the causes which led to this Caffre war with the English.  At this time the colonial governor had entered into negotiations with a Caffre chief of the name of Gaika.  He was a chief of a portion of the Caffres, but not the principal chief, and although the English treated with him as such, the Caffres would not acknowledge his authority.  This is a very frequent error committed in our intercourse with savage nations, who are as pertinacious of their rights as the monarchs of Europe.  The error on our part was soon discovered, but the government were too proud to acknowledge it.  \"It so happened that the other Caffre chiefs formed a powerful confederacy against Gaika, who, trusting to the support of the English, had treated them with great arrogance.  They fought and conquered him, carrying off, as usual, his cattle.  As this was a war between the Caffres, and confined to their own land, we certainly had no business to interfere; but the colonial government thought otherwise, and an expedition was prepared.  \"The Caffres sent forward messengers declaring their wish to remain at peace with the English, but refusing to submit to Gaika, who was only a secondary chief, and whom they had conquered.  No regard was paid to this remonstrance; the English troops were sent forward, the Caffres attacked in their hamlets, slaughtered or driven into the woods, 23,000 head of cattle taken from them, of which 9000 were given to Gaika, and the rest distributed to the Dutch boors, or sold to defray part of the expenses of the expedition.  \"Deprived of their means of subsistence by the capture of their cattle, the Caffres were rendered furious and reckless, and no sooner had the expedition returned, than they commenced hostilities.  They poured into the frontier districts, captured several detached military forts, drove the Dutch boors from the Zurweld, or neutral territory, and killed a great many of our soldiers and of the Dutch boors.  All the country was overrun as far as the vicinity of Algoa Bay, and nothing could at first check their progress.\"  \"Why, it really does not appear that the colonial government, when in our hands, was more considerate than when it was held by the Dutch,\" replied Alexander.  \"Not much, I fear,\" said Mr Fairburn.  \"The councils of the Caffre chiefs were at that time much influenced by a most remarkable personage of the name of Mokanna.  In the colony he was usually known by the sobriquet of `Links,' or the left-handed.  He was not a chief, but had by his superior intellect obtained great power. He gave himself out to be a prophet, and certainly showed quite as much skill as ever did Mahomed or any other false prophet.  He had often visited Cape Town, and had made himself master of all that he could acquire of European knowledge.  \"This man, by his influence, his superior eloquence, and his pretended revelations from heaven, was now looked up to by the whole Caffre nation; and he promised the chiefs, if they would implicitly obey his orders, he would lead them to victory, and that he would drive the English into the ocean.  He resolved upon the bold measure of making an attack upon Graham's Town, and marched an army of between nine and ten thousand men to the forest bordering on the Great Fish River.  \"According to the custom of the Caffres, who never use surprise or ambush on great occasions, they sent a message to the commandant of Graham's Town, stating that they would breakfast with him the next morning.  The commandant, who had supposed the message to be a mere bravado, was very ill prepared when on the following morning he perceived, to his great astonishment, the whole force of the Caffres on the heights above the town.  \"Had the Caffres advanced in the night, there is no doubt but that they would have had possession of the place, and that with the greatest ease. There were about 350 regular troops and a small force of Hottentots in Graham's Town, and fortunately a few field-pieces.  The Caffres rushed to the assault, and for some time were not to be checked; they went up to the very muzzles of the field-pieces, and broke their spears off short, to decide the battle by a hand-to-hand conflict.  \"At this critical moment, the field-pieces opened their fire of grape and canister, and the front ranks of the Caffres were mowed down like grass.  After several rallyings under Mokanna, the Caffres gave way and fled.  About 1400 of the bravest remained on the field of battle, and as many more perished from their wounds before they could regain their country.  Mokanna, after using every exertion, accompanied the Caffre army in their flight.\"  \"It certainly was a bold attempt on the part of the Caffres, and showed Mokanna to be a great man even in the failure.\"  \"It was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21555"],["title","The Mission; or Scenes in Africa (#7)"],["body","unprecedented an attempt, that the colonial government were dreadfully alarmed, and turned out their whole force of militia as well as of regular troops.  The Caffre country was again overrun, the inhabitants destroyed, without distinction of age or sex, their hamlets fired, cattle driven away, and when they fled to the thickets, they were bombarded with shells and Congreve rockets.  Mokanna and the principal chiefs were denounced as outlaws, and the inhabitants threatened with utter extermination if they did not deliver them up dead or alive. Although driven to despair, and perishing from want, not a single Caffre was to be found who would earn the high reward offered for the surrender of the chiefs.\"  \"The more I hear of them, the more I admire the Caffres,\" observed Alexander Wilmot; \"and I may add--but never mind, pray go on.\"  \"I think I could supply the words which you have checked, Mr Wilmot, but I will proceed, or dinner will be announced before I have finished this portion of my history.\"  \"The course adopted by Mokanna under these circumstances was such as will raise him much higher in your estimation.  As he found that his countrymen were to be massacred until he and the other chiefs were delivered up, dead or alive, he resolved to surrender himself as a hostage for his country.  He sent a message to say that he would do so, and the next day, with a calm magnanimity that would have done honour to a Roman patriot, he came, unattended, to the English camp.  His words were, `People say that I have occasioned this war: let me see if my delivering myself up will restore peace to my country.'  The commanding officer, to whom he surrendered himself immediately forwarded him as a prisoner to the colony.\"  \"What became of him?\"  \"Of that hereafter; but I wish here to give you the substance of a speech made by one of Mokanna's head-men, who came after Mokanna's surrender into the English camp.  I am told that the imperfect notes taken of it afford but a very faint idea of its eloquence; at all events, the speech gives a very correct view of the treatment which the Caffres received from our hands.  \"`This war,' said he, `British chiefs, is an unjust one, for you are striving to extirpate a people whom you have forced to take up arms. When our fathers and the fathers of the boors first settled on the Zurweld, they dwelt together in peace.  Their flocks grazed the same bills, their herdsmen smoked out of the same pipe; they were brothers until the herds of the Amakosa (Caffres) increased so much as to make the hearts of the Dutch boors sore.  What those covetous men could not get from our fathers for old buttons, they took by force.  Our fathers were men; they loved their cattle; their wives and children lived upon milk; they fought for their property; they began to hate the colonists, who coveted their all, and aimed at their destruction.  \"`Now their kraals and our fathers' kraals were separate.  The boors made commandoes for our fathers; our fathers drove them out of the Zurweld, and we dwelt there because we had conquered it; there we married wives; there our children were born; the white men hated us, but could not drive us away; when there was war, we plundered you; when there was peace, some of our bad people stole; but our chiefs forbade it.  \"`We lived in peace; some bad people stole, perhaps; but the nation was quiet; Gaika stole; his chiefs stole; you sent him copper; you sent him beads; you sent him horses, on which he rode to steal more; to _us_ you only sent _commandoes_.  We quarrelled with Gaika about grass;--no business of yours; you send a commando; you take our last cow; you leave only a few calves, which die for want, and so do our children; you give half the spoil to Gaika; half you kept yourselves.  \"`Without milk; our corn destroyed; we saw our wives and children perish: we followed, therefore, the tracks of our cattle into the colony; we plundered, and we fought for our lives; we found you weak, and we destroyed your soldiers; we saw that we were strong, and we attacked your head-quarters, and if we had succeeded, our right was good, for you began the war; we failed, and you are here.  \"`We wish for peace; we wish to rest in our huts; we wish to get milk for our children; our wives wish to till the land; but your troops cover the plains, and swarm in the thickets, where they cannot distinguish the men from the women, and shoot _all_.  You wish us to submit to Gaika; that man's face is fair to you, but his heart is false; leave him to himself; make peace with us: let him fight for himself; and we shall not call upon you for help; set Mokanna at liberty, and all our chiefs will make peace with you at any time you fix; but if you still make war, you may indeed kill the last man of us, but Gaika shall not rule over the followers of those who think him a woman.'  \"If eloquence consists (as it does not in the English House of Commons) in saying much in few words, I know no speech more comprehensive of the facts and arguments of a case than the above.  I am sorry to say it had no effect in altering the destination of Mokanna, or of obtaining any relief for his countrymen, who were still called upon to deliver up the other chiefs _outlawed_ by the government.\"  \"I before remarked the absurdity of that expression,\" said Mr Swinton; \"we outlaw a member of our own society and belonging to our own country; but to _outlaw_ the chiefs of another country is something too absurd; I fear the English language is not much studied at the Cape.\"  \"At all events, every attempt made to obtain possession of these _outlawed_ chiefs was unavailing.  After plundering the country of all that could be found in it, leaving devastation and misery behind, the expedition returned without obtaining their object, but with the satisfaction of knowing that by taking away 30,000 more cattle, they left thousands of women and children to die of starvation.  But I must leave off now.  The results of the war, and the fate of Mokanna, shall be the subject of another meeting.\"  \"We are much obliged to you, Mr Fairburn, for the interesting narrative you have given us.  It is, however, to be hoped that you will have no more such painful errors and injustice to dwell upon.\"  \"As I before observed, Mr Wilmot, it requires time for prejudice and falsehood to be overthrown; and until they are mastered, it cannot be expected that justice can be administered.  The colonial government had to contend with the whole white population of the colony who rose up in arms against them, considering, from long habit, that any interference with their assumed despotism over the natives was an infringement of their rights.  \"You must also recollect how weak was the power of the colonial government for a long time, and how impossible it was to exert that power over such an extensive country; and to give you some idea of this, I will state what was the reply of some of the Dutch boors to the traveller Le Vaillant, when the latter expressed his opinion that government should interfere with an armed force to put an end to their cruelty and oppression.  \"`Are you aware,' said they, `what would be the result of such an attempt?--Assembling all in an instant, we would massacre the half of the soldiers, salt their flesh, and send it back by those we might spare, with threats of doing the same thing to those who should be bold enough to appear among us afterwards.'  It is not an easy task for any government to deal with such a set of people, Mr Wilmot.\"  \"I grant it,\" replied Alexander; \"and the conviction makes me more anxious to know what has been since done.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  The following morning the wind was very light, and before noon it fell calm.  Two sharks of a large size came under the stern of the vessel, and the sailors were soon very busy trying to hook one of them; but they refused the bait, which was a piece of salt pork, and after an hour they quitted the vessel and disappeared, much to the disappointment both of passengers and ship's company, the former wishing very much to see the sharks caught, and the latter very anxious to cut them up and fry them for their suppers.  \"I thought that sharks always took the bait,\" observed Alexander.  \"Not always, as you have now seen,\" replied Mr Swinton; \"all depends upon whether they are hungry or not.  In some harbours where there are plenty of fish, I have seen sharks in hundreds, which not only refused any bait, but would not attempt to seize a man if he was in the water; but I am surprised at these Atlantic sharks refusing the bait, I must confess, for they are generally very ravenous, as are, indeed, all the sharks which are found in the ocean.\"  \"I can tell you, sir, why they refused the bait,\" said the boatswain of the vessel, who was standing by; \"it's because we are now in the track of the Brazilian slavers, and they have been well fed lately, depend upon it.\"  \"I should not be surprised if you were correct in your idea,\" replied Mr Swinton.  \"There are many varieties of sharks, are there not?\" inquired Wilmot.  \"Yes, a great many; the fiercest, however, and the largest kind is the one which has just left us, and is termed the white shark; it ranges the whole Atlantic Ocean, but is seldom found far to the northward, as it prefers the tropics: it is, however, to be seen in the Mediterranean, in the Gulf of Lyons, and is there remarkably fierce.  In the English Channel you find the blue shark, which is seldom dangerous; there is also a very large-sized but harmless shark found in the north seas, which the whalers frequent.  Then there is the spotted or tiger shark, which is very savage, although it does not grow to a large size; the hammer-headed shark, so called from the peculiar formation of its head; and the ground shark, perhaps the most dangerous of all, as it lies at the bottom and rises under you without giving you notice of its approach.  I believe I have now mentioned the principal"]]]
