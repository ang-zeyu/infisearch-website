It is needless to say that they supped and slept well notwithstanding--or notwithforstanding, as Rollin put it.  Rollin was fond of long words, and possessed a few that were his own private property.  Victor had a dream that night.  He dreamt that he caught sight of an Indian on the plains with Tony on his shoulder; that he gave chase, and almost overtook them, when, to save himself, the Indian dropped his burden; that he, Victor, seized his rescued brother in a tight embrace, and burst into tears of joy; that Tony suddenly turned into Petawanaquat, and that, in the sharp revulsion of feeling, he, Victor, seized the nose of the savage and pulled it out to a length of three yards, twisted it round his neck and choked him, thrust his head down into his chest and tied his arms in a knot over it, and, finally, stuffing him into a mud-puddle, jumped upon him and stamped him down.  It was an absurd dream, no doubt, but are not dreams generally absurd?  While engaged in the last mentioned humane operation, Victor was awakened by Ian.  \"It's time to be moving,\" said his comrade with a laugh.  \"I would have roused you before, but you seemed to be so busily engaged with some friend that I hadn't the heart to part you sooner.\"  The whole of that day they spent in a fruitless effort to detect the footprints of Petawanaquat, either among the tracks made by the band of Indians or among those diverging from the main line of march.  In so doing they wandered far from the camp at the lakelet, and even lost sight of each other.  The only result was that Ian and Rollin returned in the evening dispirited and weary, and Victor lost himself.  The ease with which this is done is scarcely comprehensible by those who have not wandered over an unfamiliar and boundless plain, on which the clumps of trees and shrubs have no very distinctive features.  Victor's comrades, however, were alive to the danger.  Not finding him in camp, they at once went out in different directions, fired shots until they heard his answering reply, and at last brought him safely in.  That night again they spent on the margin of the little lake, and over the camp-fire discussed their future plans.  It was finally assumed that Petawanaquat had joined the Indians, and resolved that they should follow up the trail as fast as they could travel.  This they did during many days without, however, overtaking the Indians. Then the pemmican began to wax low, for in their anxiety to push on they neglected to hunt.  At last, one evening, just as it was growing dark, and while they were looking out for a convenient resting-place, they came on the spot where the Indians had encamped, evidently the night before, for the embers of their fires were still smoking.  Here, then, they lay down with the pleasing hope, not unmingled with anxiety, that they should overtake the band on the following day.    CHAPTER FIVE.  TONY BECOMES A REDSKIN, AND THE PURSUERS CHANGE THEIR GAME.  When Petawanaquat joined the band of Indians, of whom we left Victor Ravenshaw and his comrades in eager pursuit, he deemed it advisable for various reasons to alter the costume and general appearance of his captive, and for that purpose took him to a sequestered spot in the bushes outside the camp.  Poor Tony had at first shrunk from his captor with inexpressible horror, but when he found that the Indian did not eat him his mind was calmed. As time advanced, and he perceived that Petawanaquat, although stern and very silent, took much pains to assist him on his long marches, and, above all, fed him with a liberal hand, his feelings changed considerably, and at last he began to regard the taciturn red man with something like fondness.  Petawanaquat made no positive effort to gain the child's affections; he never fondled him, and seldom spoke, save for the purpose of giving a brief command, which Tony always obeyed with miraculous promptitude.  The utmost that can be said is that the savage was gentle and supplied his wants.  Could a civilised man have done much more?  It may be well to remark in passing that Tony, having associated a good deal with Indian boys in Red River, could speak their language pretty well.  The Indian, of course, spoke his own tongue correctly, while Tony spoke it much as he spoke his own--childishly.  As the reader probably does not understand the Indian language, we will give its equivalent as spoken by both in English.  On reaching the sequestered spot above referred to, Petawanaquat sat down on a fallen tree and made the wondering child stand up before him.  \"The white man's boy must become an Indian,\" he said solemnly.  \"How zat poss'ble?\" demanded the child with equal solemnity.  \"By wearing the red man's clothes and painting his face,\" returned his captor.  \"Zat'll be jolly,\" said Tony, with a smile of hearty approval.  How he expressed the word \"jolly\" in the Indian tongue we cannot tell, but he conveyed it somehow, for the Indian's lips expanded in a grim smile, the first he had indulged in since the day of the abduction.  The process by which Tony was transformed was peculiar.  Opening a little bundle, the Indian took therefrom a small coat, or capote, of deer-skin; soft, and of a beautiful yellow, like the skin of the chamois.  It was richly ornamented with porcupine-quill-work done in various colours, and had fringes of leather and little locks of hair hanging from it in various places.  Causing Tony to strip, he put this coat on him, and fastened it round his waist with a worsted belt of bright scarlet.  Next he drew on his little legs a pair of blue cloth leggings, which were ornamented with beads, and clothed his feet in new moccasins, embroidered, like the coat, with quill-work.  Tony regarded all this with unconcealed pleasure, but it did not seem to please him so much when the Indian combed his rich curly hair straight down all round, so that his face was quite concealed by it.  Taking a pair of large scissors from his bundle, the Indian passed one blade under the hair across the forehead, gave a sharp snip, and the whole mass fell like a curtain to the ground.  It was a sublimely simple mode of clearing the way for the countenance--much in vogue among North American savages, from whom it has recently been introduced among civilised nations.  The Indian then lifted the clustering curls at the back, and again opened the scissors.  For a few moments his fingers played with the locks as he gazed thoughtfully at them; then, apparently changing his mind, he let them drop, and put the scissors away.  But the toilet was not yet complete.  The versatile operator drew from his bundle some bright-red, yellow ochre, and blue paint, with a piece of charcoal, and set to work on Tony's countenance with all the force of a Van Dyck and the rich colouring of a Rubens.  He began with a streak of scarlet from the eyebrows to the end of the nose.  Skipping the mouth, he continued the streak from the lower lip down the chin, under which it melted into a tender half-tint made by a smudge of yellow ochre and charcoal.  This vigorous touch seemed to rouse the painter's spirit in Petawanaquat, for he pushed the boy out at arm's length, drew himself back, frowned, glared, and breathed hard.  Three bars of blue from the bridge of the nose over each cheek, with two red circles below, and a black triangle on the forehead, were touched in with consummate skill and breadth.  One of the touches was so broad that it covered the whole jaw, and had to be modified.  On each closed upper eyelid an intensely black spot was painted, by which simple device Tony, with his azure orbs, was made, as it were, to wink black and gaze blue.  The general effect having thus been blocked in, the artist devoted himself to the finishing touches, and at last turned out a piece of work which old Samuel Ravenshaw himself would have failed to recognise as his son.  It should have been remarked that previous to this, Petawanaquat had modified his own costume.  His leggings were fringed with scalp-locks; he had painted his face, and stuck a bunch of feathers in his hair, and a gay firebag and a tomahawk were thrust under his belt behind.  \"Ho!\" he exclaimed, with a look of satisfaction, \"now Tony is Tonyquat, and Petawanaquat is his father!\"  \"When will zoo take me back to my own fadder?\" asked Tony, emboldened by the Indian's growing familiarity.  No reply was given to this, but the question seemed to throw the red man into a savage reverie, and a dark frown settled on his painted face, as he muttered, \"The Little Wolf meant to take the white man's life, but he was wise: he spared his life and took his _heart_.  His revenge is sweeter.  Wah!\"  Tony failed to catch the meaning of this, but fearing to rouse the anger of his new father, he held his tongue.  Meanwhile the Indian put the child on a stump a few yards off in front of him, filled his pipe, lighted it, placed an elbow on each knee, rested his chin on his doubled fists, and glared at his handiwork.  Tony was used to glaring by that time, though he did not like it.  He sat still for a long time like one fascinated, and returned the stare with interest.  At last the Indian spoke.  \"Is Tonyquat a Christian?\"  Somewhat surprised but not perplexed by the question Tony answered, \"Ho, yis,\" promptly.  The Indian again looked long and earnestly at the child, as if he were considering how far such a juvenile mind might be capable of going into a theological discussion.  \"What _is_ a Christian?\" asked the Indian abruptly.  \"A Kist'n's a dood boy,\" replied Tony; then, dropping his eyes for a moment in an effort to recall past lessons, he suddenly looked up with an intelligent smile, and said, \"Oh, yis, I 'memers now.  Elsie teach me a Kist'n boy's one what tries to be like de Lord--dood,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21697"],["title","The Red Man's Revenge: A Tale of The Red River Flood (#7)"],["body","d, gentle, fo'givin', patient, an' heaps more; zat's what a Kist'n is.\"  The Indian nodded approvingly.  This accorded, as far as it went, with what he had learned from the missionaries of Red River, but his mind was evidently perplexed.  He smoked, meditated a considerable time, and glared at Tony in silence; then said suddenly--  \"Tonyquat, your father is _not_ a Christian.\"  \"My fadder would knock zoo down if zoo say dat to hims face,\" replied the child confidently.  This seemed so palpable a truth that the Indian nodded several times, and grinned fiendishly.  \"Do Christians swear, an' drink, and fight, and get angry till the blood makes the face blue, and strike with the fist?\" asked Petawanaquat.  \"Oh, no--_never_,\" replied Tony, adopting that shocked tone and look which Elsie was in the habit of using when anything wicked was propounded to her; \"dey's always dood, like Josuf an' Abel an' Sam'l, an' Cain, an' David, an' Saul--\"  Tony stopped short, with an indistinct idea that he was mixing pattern characters.  \"Ho!\" muttered the savage, with a gleam of triumph in his eyes, \"Petawanaquat has got his _heart_.\"  \"Eh, zoo got 'im by heart a'ready?  Took me long, long time to git 'em by heart,\" said Tony, with a look of admiration, which was sadly marred by the paint.  \"Me's not got 'em all off yet.  But you's clever, an'-- an'--big.\"  The Indian's smile became a sad one, and his look was again perplexed, as he rose and returned to the camp, followed by his adopted son.  It was obvious that no light was to be thrown on his religious difficulties, whatever they were, by Tonyquat.  After leaving the lakelet on the plains, the Indian travelled for several days with his friends; and then parting from them, went towards the west, to rejoin his family.  This point of divergence the pursuers had missed, and when they overtook the Indian band, they found, to their intense regret, that the kidnapper had escaped them.  \"We will hold on with the redskins,\" said Ian Macdonald, while sitting in council with his companions after this discovery.  \"The chief tells me that buffaloes have been reported in a spot which lies in the direction we must follow to recover the trail.  This advantage we now possess, however: we know where Petawanaquat is going--thanks to his so-called friends here, who don't seem to care much about him--and as he believes he has distanced all pursuers, he will now journey slower than before.  Besides, we must help to kill a buffalo or two, our meat being nearly done.  What say you, Vic?\"  \"I say what you say, of course, though I'd rather set off ahead of the band, and push on as fast as we can.\"  \"Vich means dat youth bees impetoous toujours,\" said Rollin.  In pursuance of this plan they journeyed with the Indians for three days, when an event occurred which modified their plans considerably. This was the discovery one afternoon of a broad trail, made by the passage of numerous carts and horsemen over the prairie.  \"Buffalo-runners!\" exclaimed Rollin, when they came upon the track.  \"From Red River!\" cried Victor.  \"Even so, boys,\" said Ian.  The Indian chief, who led the party, held the same opinion, and added that they were evidently journeying in the same direction with themselves.  This rendered it necessary that they should make a forced march during the night, it being otherwise impossible for men on foot to overtake a party of horsemen.  Towards midnight of the same day they had the satisfaction of seeing their campfires in the distance.  Soon afterwards they were within the circle of the camp, where men were still smoking and eating round the fires, and women and children were moving busily about.  \"Why, there are John Flett and David Mowat,\" exclaimed Victor, as several of the men came forward to meet the party.  \"An' Hayes, an' Vinklemann,\" cried Rollin.  Another minute and they were shaking hands amid a chorus of surprised and hearty questions and replies.  \"Is Louis Lambert with you?\" asked Victor, after mutual explanations had been given.  \"No,\" said David Mowat, with a laugh, \"he's got other fish to fry at home.\"  Poor Ian winced, for he at once pictured to himself Elsie as the mermaid hinted at.  \"Now, boys, I'm going to ask some of you to make a sacrifice,\" said Ian. \"We had intended to follow up this chase on foot, but of course will be able to accomplish our end sooner on horseback.  I want three of you to lend us your horses.  You're sure to be well paid for them by Sam Ravenshaw and my father.  I'll guarantee you that--\"  \"We want no guarantee,\" interrupted John Flett, \"and we have spare horses enough in the camp to mount you without giving up our own; so make your mind easy.\"  \"Zat is troo,\" said Herr Winklemann; \"ve has goot horse to spare; buff'lo-runners every von.  Bot you mus' stay vid us von day for run ze buff'lo an' git supply of meat.\"  Victor and his friends at once agreed to this, all the more readily that the possession of horses would now enable them easily to overtake the fugitives.  Accordingly, they sat down to a splendid supper of robbiboo, and continued to eat, chat, and quaff tea far into the following morning, until nature asserted herself by shutting up their eyelids.  The band with which our adventurers were now associated was composed of a motley crew of Red River half-breeds, out for the great spring buffalo hunt.  It consisted of nearly 700 hunters, as many women, more than 400 children, and upwards of 1000 carts, with horses and draught oxen, besides about 700 buffalo-runners, or trained hunting-horses, and more than 500 dogs.  These latter, although useless in the spring hunt, were, nevertheless, taken with them, fed, and cared for, because of their valuable qualities as draught animals for light sledges in winter.  Some of the hunters were steady-going and respectable enough; others were idle, thriftless fellows, who could not settle to farming in the colony, and even in the chase were lazy, bad hunters.  The women were there for the purpose of attending to camp duties--cooking, dressing the buffalo skins, making bags from the animals' green hides, with the hair left on the outside, and filling the same with pemmican.  This substance, as we have elsewhere remarked, is by no means unpalatable; it is very nutritious, and forms the chief food of the hundreds of voyageurs who traverse Rupert's Land in boats and canoes during the open season of the year.  It must be understood, however, that the compost is not attractive in appearance.  It is made in the open air by women who are not very particular in their habits.  Hence, during windy weather, a modicum of dust is introduced into it.  Even stray leaves and twigs may get into it at times, and it is always seasoned more or less profusely with buffalo hairs.  But these are trifles to strong and hungry men.  Two trips to the plains were made annually by these hunters.  The proceeds of the spring hunt were always sold to supply them with needed clothing, ammunition, etcetera, for the year.  The \"fall or autumn hunt\" furnished them with their winter stock of food, and helped to pay off their debts, most of them being supplied on credit.  Sometimes the fall hunt failed, in which case starvation stared the improvident among them in the face, and suffering, more or less severe, was the lot of all.  Little, however, did the reckless, jovial half-breeds care for such considerations on the occasion about which we write.  It was the spring hunt.  The year was before them.  Health rolled in the veins and hope revelled in the breasts of all as they mounted their steeds, and sallied forth to the chase.  Ah! it was a memorable day for Victor, when, at early dawn, he vaulted into the saddle of the horse lent to him, and went off to hunt the buffalo.  The said horse began by standing straight up on its hind legs like a man!  Victor held on by the mane.  Reversing the process, it pointed its tail to the sky.  Victor stood in the stirrups.  It swerved to the right, it swerved to the left, but Victor swerved with it accommodatingly.  He was a splendid horseman.  Finding that out at last, the steed took the bit in its teeth and ran away.  Victor let it run-- nay, he whacked its sides and _made_ it run.  Dozens of wild fellows were curvetting and racing around him.  It was his _first_ hunt.  Mad with excitement, he finally swept away from his comrades with a series of war-whoops that would have done credit to the fiercest redskin on the North American plains.    CHAPTER SIX.  DESCRIBES A GREAT HUNT.  The huge bison, or buffalo, of the North American prairie is gregarious; in other words, it loves society and travels in herds.  These herds are sometimes so vast as absolutely to blacken the plains for miles around.  The half-breed buffalo-hunters of Red River were also gregarious.  From the moment of their quitting the settlements they kept together for mutual help and protection.  Although a free, wild, and lawless set, they found it absolutely necessary for hunting purposes to organise themselves, and thus by voluntary submission to restraint, unwittingly did homage to Law!  On a level plain at a place called Pembina, three days out from Red River, the whole camp squatted down; the roll was called, and rules and regulations for the journey were agreed upon and settled.  Then ten captains were named, the senior being Baptiste Warder, an English half-breed, a fine bold-looking and discreet man of resolute character, who was thus elected the great war chief of the little army.  As commander-in-chief Baptiste had various duties to perform, among others to see that lost property picked up about the camp should be restored to its owner through the medium of a public crier, who went his rounds every evening.  Each captain had ten stout fellows under him to act as soldiers or policemen.  Ten guides were also appointed, each of whom led the camp day about and carried its flag or standard.  The hoisting of the flag each morning was the"]]]
