He flung down his hammer, seized his battle-axe, and throwing it on his shoulder as he hurried out, speedily overtook her.  \"Forgive my rude manners,\" he said.  \"My soul was chafed by the thoughts that filled my brain, and I scare knew what I did.\"  \"Truly, thou man of fire,\" replied the girl, with an offended look, \"I am of half a mind not to pardon thee.  See, my kirtle is destroyed by the shower thou didst bestow upon me so freely.\"  \"I will repay thee that with such a kirtle as might grace a queen the next time I go on viking cruise.\"  \"Meantime,\" said Hilda, \"I am to go about like a witch plucked somewhat hastily from the fire by a sympathising crone.\"  \"Nay; Herfrida will make thee a new kirtle of the best wool at Haldorstede.\"  \"So thy mother, it seems, is to work and slave in order to undo thy mischief?\"  \"Then, if nothing else will content thee,\" said Erling gaily, \"I will make thee one myself; but it must be of leather, for I profess not to know how to stitch more delicate substance.  But let me carry thy pitcher, Hilda.  I will go to Ulfstede to hold converse with thy father on these matters, for it seemed to me that the clouds are gathering somewhat too thickly over the dale for comfort or peace to remain long with us.\"  As the young man and maiden wended their way down the rocky path that skirted the foaming Horlingdal river, Hilda assumed a more serious tone, and sought to convince her companion of the impropriety of being too fond of fighting, in which attempt, as might be supposed, she was not very successful.  \"Why, Hilda,\" said the youth, at the close of a speech in which his fair companion endeavoured to point out the extreme sinfulness of viking cruises in particular, \"it is, as thou sayest, unjust to take from another that which belongs to him if he be our friend; but if he is our enemy, and the enemy of our country, that alters the case.  Did not the great Odin himself go on viking cruise and seize what prey he chose?\"  Erling said this with the air of a man who deemed his remark unanswerable.  \"I know not,\" rejoined Hilda.  \"There seems to me much mystery in our thoughts about the gods.  I have heard it said that there is no such god as Odin.\"  The maiden uttered this in a subdued voice, and her cheek paled a little as she glanced up at Erling's countenance.  The youth gazed at her with an expression of extreme surprise, and for a few minutes they walked slowly forward without speaking.  There was reason for this silence on both sides.  Hilda was naturally of a simple and trustful nature.  She had been brought up in the religion of her fathers, and had listened with awe and with deep interest on many a long winter night to the wild legends with which the scalds, or poets of the period, were wont to beguile the evening hours in her father's mansion; but about a year before the time of which we write, an aged stranger had come from the south, and taken up his abode in the valley, in a secluded and dilapidated hut, in which he was suffered to dwell unmolested by its owner, Haldor the Fierce; whose fierceness, by the way, was never exhibited except in time of war and in the heat of battle!  With this hermit Hilda had held frequent converse, and had listened with horror, but with a species of fascination which she could not resist, to his calm and unanswerable reasoning on the fallacy of the religion of Odin, and on the truth of that of Jesus Christ.  At first she resolved to fly from the old man, as a dangerous enemy, who sought to seduce her from the paths of rectitude; but when she looked at his grave, sad face, and listened to the gentle and--she knew not why--persuasive tones of his voice, she changed her mind, and resolved to hear what he had to say.  Without being convinced of the truth of the new religion--of which she had heard rumours from the roving vikings who frequented Horlingdal--she was much shaken in regard to the truth of her own, and now, for the first time, she had ventured to hint to a human being what was passing in her mind.  At this period Christianity had not penetrated into Norway, but an occasional wanderer or hermit had found his way thither from time to time to surprise the inhabitants with his new doctrines, and then, perchance, to perish as a warlock because of them.  Erling had heard of this old man, and regarded him with no favour, for in his sea rovings he had met with so-called Christians, whose conduct had not prepossessed him in their favour.  As for their creed, he knew nothing whatever about it.  His mind, however, was of that bold, straightforward, self-reliant, and meditative cast, which happily has existed in all ages and in all climes, and which, in civilised lands, usually brings a man to honour and power, while in barbarous countries and ages, if not associated with extreme caution and reticence, it is apt to bring its possessor into trouble.  It was with astonishment that Erling heard sentiments which had long been harboured in his own mind drop from the lips of one whose natural character he knew to be the reverse of sceptical in matters of faith, or speculative in matters of opinion.  Instead of making a direct reply to Hilda's remark, he said, after a pause:  \"Hilda, I have my doubts of the old man Christian; men say he is a warlock, and I partly believe them, for it is only such who shun the company of their fellows.  I would caution thee against him.  He believes not in Odin or Thor, which is matter of consideration mainly to himself, but methinks he holdeth fellowship with Nikke, [Satan, or the Evil One] which is matter of consideration for all honest men, aye, and women too, who would live in peace; for if the Evil Spirit exists at all, as I firmly believe he does, in some shape or other, it were well to keep as far from him as we may, and specially to avoid those erring mortals who seem to court his company.\"  \"The old man is misjudged, believe me,\" replied the girl earnestly; \"I have spoken much with him and oft.  It may be he is wrong in some things--how can a woman judge of such matters?--but he is gentle, and has a kind heart.\"  \"I like him not,\" was Erling's curt reply.  The youth and maiden had now reached a part of the valley where a small footpath diverged from the main track which led to Ulf's dwelling.  The path ran in the direction of the hayfields that bordered the fiord. Just as they reached it, Hilda observed that her father was labouring there with his thralls.  \"See,\" she exclaimed, stopping abruptly, and taking her pitcher from Erling, \"my father is in the hayfield.\"  The youth was about to remonstrate and insist on being allowed to carry the pitcher to the house before going to the field; but on second thoughts he resigned his slight burden, and, saying \"farewell\", turned on his heel and descended the path with rapid step and a somewhat burdened heart.  \"She loves me not,\" he muttered to himself, almost sternly.  \"I am a brother, nothing more.\"  Indulging in these and kindred gloomy reflections, he advanced towards a rocky defile where the path diverged to the right.  Before taking the turn he looked back.  Hilda was standing on the spot where they had parted, but her face was not directed towards her late companion.  She was looking steadily up the valley.  Presently the object which attracted her attention appeared in view, and Erling felt a slight sensation of anger, he scarce knew why, on observing the old man who had been the subject of their recent conversation issue from among the rocks.  His first impulse was to turn back, but, checking himself, he wheeled sharply round and hurried away.  Scarcely had he taken three steps, however, when he was arrested by a sound that resembled a crash of thunder.  Glancing quickly upwards, he beheld an enormous mass of rock, which had become detached from the mountain side, descending in shattered fragments into the valley.  The formation of Horlingdal at that particular point was peculiar.  The mountain ranges on either side, which rose to a height of at least four thousand feet, approached each other abruptly, thus forming a dark gloomy defile of a few hundred yards in width, with precipitous cliffs on either side, and the river roaring in the centre of the pass.  The water rushed in white-crested billows through its rock-impeded bed, and terminated in a splendid foss, or fall, forty or fifty feet high, which plunged into a seething caldron, whence it issued in a troubled stream to the plain that opened out below.  It here found rest in the level fields of Ulfstede, that lay at the head of the fiord.  The open amphitheatre above this pass, with its circlet of grand glacier-capped mountains, was the abode of a considerable number of small farmers, in the midst of whose dwellings stood the residence of Haldor, where the meeting in the smithy just described took place.  It was in this narrow defile that the landslip happened, a catastrophe which always has been and still is of frequent occurrence in the mountain regions of Norway.  Hilda and the old man (whom we shall henceforth call Christian) cast their eyes hastily upwards on hearing the sound that had arrested Erling's steps so suddenly.  The enormous mass of rock was detached from the hill on the other side of the river, but the defile was so narrow that falling rocks often rebounded quite across it.  The slip occurred just opposite the spot on which Hilda and the old man stood, and as the terrible shower came on, tearing down trees and rocks, the heavier masses being dashed and spurned from the hillside in innumerable fragments, it became evident that to escape beyond the range of the chaotic deluge was impossible.  Hilda understood the danger so well that she was panic stricken and rooted to the spot.  Erling understood it also, and, with a sudden cry, dashed at full speed to the rescue.  His cry was one almost of despair, for the distance between them was so great that he had no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21730"],["title","Erling the Bold (#4)"],["body",", he knew, of reaching her in time.  In this extremity the hermit looked round for a crevice or a rock which might afford protection, but no such place of safety was at hand.  The side of the pass rose behind them like a wall to a height of several hundred feet.  Seeing this at a glance the old man planted himself firmly in front of Hilda.  His lips moved, and the single word \"Jesus\" dropped from them as he looked with a calm steady gaze at the avalanche.  Scarcely had he taken his stand when the first stones leaped across the gorge, and, striking on the wall of rock behind, burst into fragments and fell in a shower around them.  Some of the smaller _debris_ struck the old man's breast, and the hands which he had raised to protect his face; but he neither blanched nor flinched.  In another instant the greater part of the hurling rubbish fell with a terrible crash and tore up the earth in all directions round them.  Still they stood unhurt! The height from which the ruin had descended was so great that the masses were scattered, and although they flew around over, and close to them, the great shock passed by and left them unscathed.  But the danger was not yet past.  Several of the smaller masses, which had been partially arrested in their progress by bushes, still came thundering down the steep.  The quick eye of the hermit observed one of these flying straight towards his head.  Its force had been broken by a tree on the opposite hill, but it still retained tremendous impetus.  He knew that there was no escape for him.  To have moved aside would have exposed Hilda to almost certain destruction.  Once again he murmured the Saviour's name, as he stretched out both hands straight before his face. The rock struck full against them, beat them down on his forehead, and next instant old man and maid were hurled to the ground.  Well was it for Erling that all this occurred so quickly that the danger was past before he reached the spot.  Part of the road he had to traverse was strewn so thickly with the rocky ruin that his destruction, had he been a few seconds sooner on the ground, would have been inevitable.  He reached Hilda just in time to assist her to rise.  She was slightly stunned by the shock, but otherwise unhurt.  Not so the hermit.  He lay extended where he had fallen; his grey beard and thin scattered locks dabbled with blood that flowed from a gash in his forehead.  Hilda kneeled at his side, and, raising his head, she laid it in her lap.  \"Now the gods be praised,\" said Erling, as he knelt beside her, and endeavoured to stanch the flow of blood from the wound; \"I had thought thy last hour was come, Hilda; but the poor old man, I fear much he will die.\"  \"Not so; he recovers,\" said the girl; \"fetch me some water from the spring.\"  Erling ran to a rill that trickled down the face of the rock at his side, dipped his leathern bonnet into it, and, quickly returning, sprinkled a little on the old man's face, and washed the wound.  \"It is not deep,\" he remarked, after having examined the cut.  \"His hands are indeed badly bruised, but he will live.\"  \"Get thee to the stede, Erling, and fetch aid,\" said Hilda quickly; \"the old man is heavy.\"  The youth smiled.  \"Heavy he is, no doubt, but he wears no armour; methinks I can lift him.\"  So saying Erling raised him in his strong arms and bore him away to Ulfstede, where, under the tender care of Hilda and her foster-sister Ada, he speedily revived.  Erling went out meanwhile to assist in the hayfield.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  The great assembly, or parliament, which was considered the only \"Thing\" which could confer the sovereignty of the whole of Norway, the other Things having no right or powers beyond their circles.  It was convened only for the special purpose of examining and proclaiming the right of the aspirant to the crown, but the King had still to repair to each Law Thing or Small Thing to obtain its acknowledgement of his right and the power of a sovereign within its jurisdiction.    CHAPTER THREE.  SHOWS HOW CHIEF FRIENDS MAY BECOME FOES, AND CROSS-PURPOSES MAY PRODUCE CROSS CONSEQUENCES, INVOLVING WORRY AND CONFUSION.  When Christian had been properly cared for, Hilda sent Ada to the hayfield, saying that she would follow her in a short time.  Now it so happened, by one of those curious coincidences which are generally considered unaccountable, that as Ada ascended the track which led to the high field above the foss, Glumm the Gruff descended towards the same point from an opposite direction, so that a meeting between the two, in the secluded dell, where the tracks joined, became inevitable.  Whether or not this meeting was anticipated we cannot tell.  If it was, the young man and maiden were inimitable actors by nature, for they appeared to be wholly unconscious of aught save the peculiar formation of the respective footpaths along which they slowly moved.  There was, indeed, a twinkle in Ada's eyes; but then Ada's eyes were noted twinklers; besides, a refractory eyelash might account for such an expression.  As for Glumm, he frowned on the path most unamiably while he sauntered along with both hands thrust into the breast of his tunic, and the point of his sword rasping harshly against rocks and bushes.  Glumm was peculiar in his weapons.  He wore a double-handed and double-edged sword, which was so long that he was obliged to sling it across his back in order to keep it off the ground.  The handle projected above his left shoulder, and the blade, lying diagonally across his person, extended beyond his right calf.  The young man was remarkably expert in the use of this immense weapon, and was not only a terror to his foes, but, owing to the enormous sweep of its long blade, an object of some anxiety to his friends when they chanced to be fighting alongside of him.  He wore a knife or dagger at his girdle on the right side, which was also of unusual size; in all probability it would have been deemed a pretty good sword by the Romans.  There were only two men in the dale who could wield Glumm's weapons.  These were Erling and his father, Haldor.  The latter was as strong a man as Glumm, Erling was even stronger; though, being an amiable man he could not be easily persuaded to prove his strength upon his friends.  Glumm wore his hair very short.  It was curly, and lay close to his head.  As he sauntered along he kicked the stones out of his way savagely, and appeared to find relief to his feelings in so doing, as well as by allowing his sword to rasp across the rocks and shrubs at his side.  It might have been observed, however, that Glumm only kicked the little stones out of his way; he never kicked the big ones.  It is interesting to observe how trifling a matter will bring out a trait of human nature! Men will sometimes relieve their angry feelings by storming violently at those of their fellows who cannot hurt them, but, strangely enough, they manage to obtain relief to these same feelings without storming, when they chance to be in the company of stronger men than themselves, thereby proving that they have powers of self-restraint which prudence-- not to say fear--can call into exercise! commend this moral reflection particularly to the study of boys.  After Glumm had kicked all the _little_ stones out of his way, carefully letting the big ones alone, he came suddenly face to face with Ada, who saluted him with a look of startled surprise, a slight blush, and a burst of hearty laughter.  \"Why, Glumm,\" exclaimed the maiden, with an arch smile, \"thou must have risen off thy wrong side this morning.  Methinks, now, were I a man, I should have to look to my weapons, for that long blade of thine seems inclined to fight with the rocks and shrubs of its own accord.\"  Poor Glumm blushed as red as if he had been a young girl, at being thus unexpectedly caught giving vent to his ill-humour; he stammered something about bad dreams and evil spirits, and then, breaking into a good-humoured smile, said:  \"Well, Ada, I know not what it is that ails me, but I do feel somewhat cross-grained.  Perchance a walk with thee may cure me, I see thou art bound for the hayfield.  But hast thou not heard the news?  The Danish vikings are off the coast, burning and murdering wherever they go.  It is rumoured, too, that their fleet is under that king of scoundrels, Skarpedin the Red.  Surely there is reason for my being angry.\"  \"Nay, then, if thou wert a bold man thou wouldst find reason in this for being glad,\" replied Ada.  \"Is not the chance of a fight the joy of a true Norseman's heart?  Surely a spell must have been laid on thee, if thy brow darkens and thy heart grows heavy on hearing of a stout enemy. It is not thus with Erling the Bold.  His brow clears and his eye sparkles when a foe worthy of--But what seest thou, Glumm?  Has the Dane appeared in the forest that thy brow becomes so suddenly clouded?  I pray thee do not run away and leave me unprotected.\"  \"Doubtless if I did, Erling the Bold would come to thine aid,\" replied the young man with some asperity.  \"Nay, do not be angry with me, Glumm,\" said the girl, laughing, as they reached the field where Haldor and his stout son were busily at work assisting Ulf, who, with all his thralls and freemen, was engaged in cutting and gathering in his hay.  \"Hey! here come cloud and sunshine hand in hand,\" cried Erling, pausing in his work, as Glumm and his pretty companion approached the scene of labour.  \"Get on with thy work, then, and make the hay while I am shining,\" retorted Ada, bestowing on the youth a bright smile, which he returned cheerfully and with interest.  This was the wicked Ada's finishing touch.  Glumm saw the exchange of smiles, and a pang of fierce jealousy shot through his breast.  \"The cloud sometimes darts out lightning,\" he muttered angrily, and, turning on his heel, began to toss the hay with all his might in order to relieve his"]]]
