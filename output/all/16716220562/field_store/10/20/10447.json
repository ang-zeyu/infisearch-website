Then the Pyramids of Mexico are built on the same plan, and located, astronomically, the same as those in Egypt.\"  \"But could not the ancients have crossed the seas, and in that way given the same knowledge to both sections?\"  \"There is absolutely no evidence that the ancients had vessels capable of traversing 2000 miles of ocean.\"  \"But the book I read said that the Western Hemisphere merely broke away from the main body of the land, and that is why the people here knew all that those in Europe had learned.\"  \"That is very plausible, and for the purpose of giving you a fair understanding of the matter, I make a sketch, showing (Fig. 2), the Atlantean theory, in which the western shores of Europe and Africa, and the eastern shores of North and South America are outlined, and between them, in dotted lines, is Atlantis, the only part of that vast continent now being visible being the Azore Islands, at the northern extremity.\"  \"But what evidence is there that such a continent existed? Is it only a theory?\"  \"It is supported by some evidence, much of which, like the account which the Egyptian priests gave to Solon, would take too long to state; but some years ago, while Darwin was engaged in making the deep sea soundings in the ship _Challenger_, it was found that the bed of the Atlantic showed a raised plateau, where the legendary Atlantis was claimed to be.\"  \"But might it not be possible that the other theory could be correct, also,--that is, that North America merely broke away, and in breaking away, left Atlantis as an island?\"  \"I do not see how it can be reconciled. In the first sketch (Fig. 2), note the shape of the continent of Atlantis. Now, in the next sketch (Fig. 3), I have brought the two continents close up to each other. The outlines appear similar, and it would be difficult to make them fit together, if Atlantis should be placed there, or left in that space, after the breaking apart.\"  The discussion was closed for the night and arrangements made for sleep and sentry duty.  Frequently during the night the beating of the singular drums was heard. After the entertainment of the evening both Muro and Uraso undertook some scouting on their own account. The boys were awake early, and then learned of their expeditions.  Three miles north of the rocky point the main village was located. They had crept forward cautiously until close enough to learn that there must be fully five hundred inhabitants. But what was more surprising still, was the evidence they obtained that the tribes believed in the Hoodoos and the witch doctors.  [Illustration: _Fig. 3. The Severed Hemispheres._]  The boys were jubilant at the information, and John was full of smiles as he imparted the information. The difficulty was to get into communication with the natives, as their efforts of the preceding day did not offer much encouragement in that direction.  The fact that the people on the island observed peculiar rites was evidence to John that they must be steeped in the superstitions that are a necessary part of the craft of the witch doctors, and to the boys, as well as to Uraso and Muro, the opportunity for John to match his intelligence with the crafty Krishnos, was awaited with interest.  It was shown on Wonder Island, that while the people had the most implicit confidence in their medicine men, they were the first to cause their overthrow when it was shown that they maintained their superiority through deceit.  Before nine o'clock the drums began to beat. They were plainly heard, as there was a slight breeze from that direction. John selected fifteen of the warriors, and accompanied by the boys, and Muro and Uraso, started for the village.  \"You are to remain here until you get word from us. If you should hear heavy firing it will be the signal for you to come on without delay. In such a case approach cautiously, and rush them, so as to reach us. We do not want to cause the loss of a single life among them, except as a last resort to save our own. Otherwise you are not to leave the cove. One must be sent to the height beyond, to keep a watch for the _Pioneer_.  \"If the vessel is sighted send a runner to the shore, and try to get into communication with it, so they may know where we are.  \"As soon as Tarra returns, send him forward to us without delay. He should be back before noon to-day.\" John was thus precise to deliver the instructions, because he did not know what their reception was likely to be at the village.  As stated, his prime object was to prevent the sacrifice of captives, if such there should be, or to put off the rites which he knew would take place that day and the next.  They marched down the hill, taking all precautions on the way, but they met no opposition. Beyond them was a well wooded plain, and at intervals they could see, in the distance, detached huts, and in many places evidences of crude cultivation of the soil.  The huts were unoccupied, but it was evident from their appearance that they had been used up to that very day.  \"I cannot understand why no people are living here,\" remarked George.  \"They have gone to the village to attend the sacred rites,\" responded Uraso.  They were now less than a mile from the village, which could be seen in the distance through the trees. Something unusual was taking place to their left, and more than a mile away. Uraso agreed to go in that direction, and gain the slight elevation, which might afford him an opportunity to discover the cause of the excitement.  There was considerable shouting, and then the beating of the drums, which they had not heard since the early morning. Uraso was gone not to exceed a half hour.  \"They are having something unusual in that quarter. A number of natives have just come in, and a hundred, or more, from the village met the visitors. I cannot account for the demonstration,\" observed one of the boys.  \"It is quite likely,\" suggested John, \"that some other tribe has come in to attend the ceremonies.\"  \"I do not think so, because the visitors belong to the same people who live in the village.\"  John was determined to go on, and they proceeded, reaching the outlying portion of the village, just as the visitors, and those from the village were entering it from the other angle.  \"They have a prisoner there,\" said Muro. \"I am sure that man in the first group is being conducted to the village.\"  \"Unquestionably, Muro is correct. It is plain that a party of the villagers have captured the man, and the excitement we heard was caused by that fact.\" And John began to speculate on the probability of the island containing more than the one tribe.  \"That man is a native, I am sure,\" was Uraso's observation.  \"That looks like Tarra,\" said George, in excitement.  This announcement had an electrical effect on those present. If such should prove to be the case, what likelihood was there that he had delivered the message at the landing? Was he captured going, or coming.  \"It looks to me as though he was captured this morning,\" observed Harry, \"because if he had been taken last night, on his way over, they would not wait until to-day to bring him in.\"  This looked like a reasonable supposition; but they must first make sure that it was Tarra.  \"Forward march!\" said John.  But before they had time to go far the whole town seemed to be alive. From every part of the village men were running, and forming in the open space next the first row of huts.  It was a most curious proceeding that the boys now witnessed. In the center of the warriors was a large man, with a curious garb. On each side of him were noticed men with dissimilar clothing, but bedecked with every sort of device, the peculiarities of which could not be distinguished, owing to the distance.  \"That large man in the middle, is the Chief, and those about him are the witch doctors. The Chief has brought the witch doctors so as to terrify and destroy us,\" and John laughed as he remembered some of the wiles of that class on Wonder Island.  To the beating of the drums, the Chief marched forward, his men following, and closing in on his sides to afford him protection. John motioned Uraso and Muro to step forward, and they advanced twenty feet beyond the warriors, and awaited the Chief.  The latter stopped when within hailing distance, and John held up a hand. Uraso then addressed the Chief, telling him that they came as friends, and not as enemies, and desired to be present at the ceremonies about to take place.  He also recited that they came from a neighboring island, where they had a wonderful village, where all the people were happy, and they now wanted to show, their friendship by offering presents.  The Chief was silent, and then said: \"Why did you kill my people?\"  \"We only defended ourselves. Your warriors were the ones who attacked us. We could have killed all of your warriors if we had been enemies.\"  \"You speak lies,\" answered the Chief. \"Why did you take my warrior?\"  \"Because he was wounded and we are making him well, and will then return him to you so he can tell you that what we say is true.\"  \"You are again speaking lies,\" he retorted. Notwithstanding the manner in which Uraso had steeled himself, he was visibly affected by the blunt manner in which the savage accused him, but he was judicious enough not to appear disturbed.  \"Ask him,\" said John, \"what he wants us to do to prove that we are friends, and not enemies.\"  The Chief, at this question, drew himself up proudly, and answered: \"You are on my dominion, and you have no right to ask any favor from me. You must deliver yourself up as prisoners, and we shall then deal with you as we see fit.\"  \"In what way will you deal with us? Have we committed a wrong? Do you intend to punish us?\"  \"You had no right to come here. Every one who does so without my permission, must die.\"  \"Then you expect us to surrender so you may kill us?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then our Chief tells you that he has a right to come"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21810"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: Treasures of the Islands (#7)"],["body",", and that you have no right to prevent it, and that if you try to kill us we will have the Great Spirit visit you the same as he visited your warriors the other day,\" said Uraso.  The Chief was astounded at the audacity of the visitors. He could not understand the presumption of Uraso, and the defiant attitude of the little group behind him.  \"Then I command the Korinos to destroy you!\" he shouted.  Muro turned to the boys, and smiled as he said: \"Do you know what he means? He calls them Korinos. On Wonder Island they are Krishnos. That seems pretty close to the same thing.\"  Uraso held up a hand, as he said: \"I have a Korino here (pointing to John), and he will destroy your Korinos.\"  The witch doctors then ranged themselves in front of the Chief, and the latter said: \"They will sacrifice your friend who came to us to-day.\"  To the astonishment of all, Tarra was led forward, and ordered to kneel down. Then a great burly man, clothed in the garb so common to the sorceress among savage tribes, followed him with a huge knotted club.  \"Tell him that if he raises the club I will order the Korino to die.\"  This was imparted, but it made no difference to the executioner. He stepped forward, and slowly raised the club, but before it had reached its highest point, a revolver in the hands of John spoke, and the savage dropped the club, and slowly sank to the earth.  It would be impossible to describe the consternation that showed itself at this catastrophe.  \"Come here, Tarra,\" cried John.  Tarra leaped to his feet, and with a few bounds was at Uraso's side, while Harry jumped forward and cut the thongs that bound his hands.  The Chief was bewildered, no less than those around him. No effort was made to prevent Tarra from escaping. The other Korinos did not even go forward to the relief of their slain comrade. He lay there motionless.  \"I am sorry,\" said John. \"I must have made a miscalculation, but I am afraid he is dead.\"  Then one of the Korinos moved toward the fallen man. \"Stop!\" cried John. \"It will be death for any one to touch him now!\"  Uraso hurriedly informed the Chief of this new piece of information, which, in reality, caused more terror than the shot itself. What species of sorcery was this that they dared not even touch the victim who disobeyed the white Korino?     CHAPTER IV  RESCUING A WHITE CAPTIVE   \"Did you deliver the message at the landing place?\" asked George, after Tarra was freed.  \"No; they captured me late last night. I tried for hours to get through, but they were within a mile of the landing,\" answered Tarra.  \"But where have you been all this time?\"  \"They took me north to another village.\"  But more interesting things were now happening. The witch doctor who was about to go to his fallen companion, hesitated. He turned to the Chief. The latter merely stretched out his hand, and with an impatient gesture appeared to order him on.  \"I warn you!\" said Uraso. \"It will be death to touch him.\"  If there is one thing, more than another, that is liable to add terror to a low order of human beings, it is noise. It may be said that the most intelligent are not entirely devoid of the feeling of fear at inexplainable noises.  As an example, take the sensations produced by thunder and lightning, one which affects the ear, and the other the eye. During a thunderstorm, the feeling of fear becomes acute only when the roar is heard.  In this case we know what it is that produces the reverberations; but even under those circumstances many people are seriously affected by it. A terrific explosion, of which we do not know the cause, is often the source of great terror.  This is particularly true with all savage people. The drums referred to, evidence this particular feeling of awe, and the louder and more violent, the more intense is it to the untutored mind. It is with this idea in their minds that they exercise the bad spirits by driving them away by making great noises, a practice true of most savage tribes.  When John returned to Wonder Island from the United States he had taken with him several of the well-known Silencers, which, when attached to the muzzle of a gun, will so deaden the sound that no explosion is heard.  [Illustration: _Fig. 4. Silencer. Convolute Blades._]  For general use, John knew that the unmuffled gun would be far more effective than those equipped with the new invention. Smokeless powder was also used in the guns which John and his company carried. The absence of smoke thus centers the mind of the native on the sound alone, and he sees the effect on the victim.  To the savage the sound and the effect of the shot produce the sensation that there is something more than human in the discharge. It is hard for them to form an idea of the connection between the report and the mission of the bullet. It is some monster which speaks in a loud voice.  But it was more than that to the islanders when they saw the witch doctor fall. There was a white Korino who spoke with a voice of thunder. They were not aware that he held something in his hand like a weapon, and the noise and the result of that noise stunned them.  John also carried a revolver with one of the silencers. When the Korino turned to the Chief, and the latter, determined not to be swayed by the power of the white man, there was but one thing for him to do. He must obey. He knew that if he shrunk from the task it would be a confession that his power was gone.  The man approached the prostrate form. \"Stop!\" again cried Uraso. \"The white Korino will not again speak, but if he touches the body you will die!\"  He stood there for a moment, irresolute, and then slowly stooped down, and with hesitation at every motion, finally touched the figure. In the meantime John had leveled the revolver with the silencer, and as the man again rose to an erect position, and glanced at John defiantly, he quickly threw up his hands and fell forward across his former companion with a shot through his arm, as it was not John's intention to kill him if it could by any possibility be avoided.  The white Korino had not spoken, as Uraso predicted, but the results were the same. The savages who were lined up on both sides of the Chief, began to waver. They were moving to the rear. The Korinos around the Chief, finally broke and fled, and when the people saw this evidence of fear on the part of their Wise Men, they could not be restrained.  The Chief followed them hurriedly. \"Now, quickly, boys, fire two rounds. No; not at the natives, but up in the air.\"  The boys could not understand what John could mean by such an order, but they did not have an opportunity to ask the reason for it.  After the volleys John turned to Muro and Uraso, and remarked: \"As soon as the men come up you and Muro must contrive in some way to find out the direction that the Korinos have taken.\"  They now saw the object of the volleys. It would bring up those of their party who had remained at the rocky cove. The watch for the Korinos was equally plain. The experience on Wonder Island showed that the witch doctors inhabited the caves.  In the excitement they had entirely forgotten this part of their enterprise. They thought of the treasure. John had the treasure of the records in his mind. The hills all about; the limestone formations of the elevations were ample assurance to his mind that some caverns would be found; and while they might, eventually, be able to locate the entrances, it would be better to find out where they were by watching and charting the direction they took on their way to the dark places where they hoped to rest in fancied security.  Within fifteen minutes their rear guard came into sight, rushing over the hills, all expectant to find an enemy in their front. Great was their surprise to see the village beyond, and John and his party bending over the two bodies, one of them moving and the other inert. Apparently, he and his force were unconcerned, although many savages were in the village, and in plain sight.  An examination of the fallen men made John happy, because he feared that his aim had been untrue. Both had been severely wounded, and when an hour afterwards both men were able to move, thanks to the knowledge and care of John, they were carried into the village.  Before this was done, however, John ordered the force to march boldly into the village. On the approach of the party the Chief and his followers, together with the women and children, hurriedly fled to the north.  Among the huts were found a dozen or more sick and injured men and women, and a number of old people who were unable to be carried away. John went to each, and after carefully examining them, administered medicine.  In one place they found two warriors, who had been wounded in the battle four days previously. These were given special attention, the villagers meanwhile looking on the proceeding with a feeling of awe, and wonder. They could not comprehend the care and treatment which was being given them.  John's companions were most eager to render aid, and spoke to the patients freely, telling them that they were friends, and not enemies. During this investigation into every corner of the village, George and Harry were the most active. They found many amusing things, but the care of the sick and the infirm was the first duty, and they had many willing helpers.  While thus engaged they reached a long, low thatched enclosure, so entirely different from the huts scattered about. There was no visible opening. They walked around the enclosure with more and more curiosity. Some of their companions from Wonder Island then drew near.  \"We have found it!\" cried one of them.  \"What is it?\" asked Harry.  \"This is the place where they keep the captives.\"  \"But how can we get into it?\" asked George, then adding, \"Get one of the hatchets, quickly.\"  Several men ran back and opened the packages containing their equipment, and others followed to see the prisoners. Uraso was one of the first to come up, "]]]
