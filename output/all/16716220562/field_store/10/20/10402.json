As it was, other things helped to quicken his sensibilities.  Bladud's unfailing arrow went indeed straight for the heart, but a strong rib caught and checked its progress.  The captain's shaft, probably by good luck, entered deep into the creature's flank not far from the tail.  To say that the forest was instantly filled with ear-splitting shrieks is to express the result but feebly.  We might put it as a sort of indefinite question in the rule of three, thus--if an ordinary civilised pig with injured feelings can yell as we all know how, what must have been the explosion of a wild-boar of the eighth century BúCú, in circumstances such as we have described?  Railway whistles of the nineteenth century, intermittently explosive, is the only possible answer to the question, and that is but an approximation to the truth.  For one instant the infuriated creature paused to look for its assailants.  Catching sight of them as they were fitting arrows to their bows, it gave vent to a prolonged locomotive-express yell, and charged. Bladud's arrow hit it fair between the eyes, but stuck in the impenetrable skull.  The shaft of the captain missed, and the javelin of Maikar went wildly wide of the mark.  By order of Bladud the three had separated a few yards from each other. Even in its rage the monster was perplexed by this, for it evidently perceived the impossibility of attacking three foes at the same moment. Which to go for was the question.  Like an experienced warrior it went for the \"little one.\"  Maikar had drawn his last weapon--the short sword of bronze--and, like a brave man as he was, \"prepared to receive boarelry.\"  Another instant and the enemy was upon him.  More than that, it was over him, for, trusting to his agility--for which he was famed--he tried to leap to one side, intending to make a vigorous thrust at the same moment.  In doing so his foot slipped; he fell flat on his side, and the boar, tripping over him, just missed ripping him with its fearful tusks.  It fell, with a bursting squeak, beyond.  To leap up and turn was the work of an instant for the boar, and would have been the same for the man if he had not been partially stunned by the fall.  As it was, the captain, who was nearest, proved equal to the emergency, for, using his javelin as a spear, he plunged it into the boar's side.  But that side was tougher than he had expected.  The spear was broken by a sharp twist as the animal turned on its new foe, who now stood disarmed and at its mercy.  Bladud's ponderous sword, however, flashed in the air at that moment, and fell on the creature's neck with a force that would have made Hercules envious if he had been there. Deep into the brawn it cut, through muscle, fat, and spine, almost slicing the head from the trunk, and putting a sudden stop to the last yell when it reached the windpipe.  The boar rolled head over heels like a shot hare, almost overturning Bladud as it wrenched the sword from his hand, and swept the captain off his legs, carrying him along with it in a confusion of blood and bristles.  It was truly a terrific encounter, and as the prince stood observing the effect of his blow, he would probably have burst into a fit of laughter, had he not been somewhat solemnised by Captain Arkal's fearful appearance, as he arose ensanguined, but uninjured, from the ground.  CHAPTER EIGHT.  DISCOVERY AND FLIGHT.  Being now provided with material for making shields, they resolved to spend a day in camp.  This was all the more necessary, that the shoes or sandals which they had worn at sea were not well suited for the rough travelling which they had now to undertake.  Accordingly they selected a spot on the brow of a hill from which the surrounding country could be seen in nearly all directions.  But they were careful also to see that several bushes shielded themselves from view, for it was a matter of uncertainty whether or where natives might make their appearance.  Here, bathed in glorious sunshine, with a lovely prospect of land and water, tangled wood and flowery plains, to gladden their eyes, and the savoury smell of pork chops and turkey to tickle their nostrils, they spent two days in manufacturing the various necessary articles.  Captain Arkal provided himself with a new javelin.  Maikar made another bow, and both fabricated tough round shields with double plies of the boar's hide.  Out of the same substance Bladud made a pair of shoes for each of them.  \"The sandals you wear at home,\" he said, \"are not so good as those used by us in Albion.  They don't cover the feet sufficiently, and they expose the toes too much.  Yet our sandals are easily and quickly made. Look here--I will show you.\"  His companions paused in their labour and looked on, while the prince took up an oblong piece of boar-hide, over a foot in length and six inches broad, which had been soaking in water till it had become quite soft and limp.  Placing one of his feet on this he drew the pattern of it on the skin with a pointed stick.  Around this pattern, and about a couple of inches from it, he bored a row of holes an inch or so apart. Through these holes he rove a thong of hide, and then rounded away the corners of the piece.  \"There,\" said he, placing his foot in the centre of it and drawing the thong, \"my sandal is ready.\"  The tightening of the thong drew up the edges of the shoe until they overlapped and entirely encased his foot.  \"Good,\" said the captain, \"but that kind of sandal is not new to me. I've seen it before, not only in your country, but in other lands.\"  \"Indeed?  Well, after all, it is so simple, and so likely to hit the minds of thoughtful men, that I doubt not it is used wherever travelling is bad or weather cold.  We shall need such sandals in this land, for there is, no doubt, great variety of country, also of weather, and many thorns.\"  While our travellers were thus labouring and commenting on their work, unseen eyes were gazing at them with profound interest and curiosity.  A boy, or youth just emerging from the state of boyhood, lay low in a neighbouring thicket with his head just elevated sufficiently above the grass to enable his black eyes to peer over it.  He was what we of the nineteenth century term a savage.  That is to say, he was unkempt, unwashed, and almost naked--but not uneducated, though books had nothing to do with his training.  The prince chanced to look round, and saw the black eyes instantly, but being, as we have said, an adept in woodcraft--including savage warfare--he did not permit the slightest evidence of recognition to escape him.  He continued his gaze in the same direction, allowing his eyes slowly to ascend, as if he were looking through the tree-tops at the sky.  Then turning his head quietly round he resumed his work and whistled--for whistling had been invented even before that time.  \"Comrades,\" he said, after a few minutes, \"don't look up from your work, but listen.  We are watched.  You go on with your occupations as if all was right, and leave me to deal with the watcher.\"  His comrades took the hint at once and went quietly on with their labours, while the prince arose, stretched himself, as if weary of his work.  After a few minutes of looking about him, as though undecided what to do next, he sauntered into the bush at the side of their encampment opposite to that where the watcher lay.  The moment he got out of range of the boy's eyes, however, his careless air vanished, and he sped through the underwood with the quietness and something of the gait of a panther--stooping low and avoiding to tread on dead twigs.  Making a wide circle, he came round behind the spot where the watcher was hid.  But, trained though he had been in the art of savage warfare, the boy was equal to him.  From the first he had observed in Bladud's acting the absence of that \"touch of nature which makes the whole world kin,\" and kept a bright look-out to his rear as well as in his front, so that when Bladud, despite his care, trod on a dry stick the boy heard it.  Next moment he was off, and a moment after that he was seen bounding down the hill like a wild-cat.  The prince, knowing the danger of letting the boy escape and carry information to his friends, dashed after him at full speed--and the rate of his running may be estimated when it is remembered that many a time he had defeated men who had been victors at the Olympic games.  But the young savage was nearly his match.  Feeling, however, that he was being slowly yet surely overtaken, the boy doubled like a hare and made for a ridge that lay on his left.  By that time the chase was in full view of the two men in camp, who rose and craned their necks in some excitement to watch it.  \"He's after something,\" said the captain.  \"A boy!\" said Maikar.  \"Ay, and running him down, hand over hand.\"  \"There seems to be no one else in sight, so we don't need to go to his help.\"  \"If he needs our help he'll come for it,\" returned the captain with a laugh, \"and it will puzzle the swiftest runner in the land to beat his long legs.  See, he's close on the lad now.\"  \"True,\" responded the other, with a sigh of disappointment, \"but we shan't see the end of it, for the boy will be over the ridge and out of sight before he is caught.\"  Maikar was right.  Even while he spoke the youthful savage gained the summit, where his slim, agile figure was clearly depicted against the sky.  Bladud was running at full speed, not a hundred yards behind him, yet, to the amazement of the spectators, the boy suddenly stopped, turned round, and waved his hand with a shout of defiance.  Next moment he was over the ridge and gone.  A few seconds later the prince was seen to halt at the same point, but instead of continuing the pursuit, he remained immovable for a few"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21758"],["title","Hudson Bay (#0)"],["body","BAY, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    PREFACE.  In publishing the present work, the Author rests his hopes of its favourable reception chiefly upon the fact that its subject is comparatively new.  Although touched upon by other writers in narratives of Arctic discovery, and in works of general information, the very nature of those publications prohibited a lengthened or minute description of that EVERYDAY LIFE whose delineation is the chief aim of the following pages.    PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION.  Since this book was written, very considerable changes have taken place in the affairs and management of the Hudson Bay Company.  The original charter of the Company is now extinct.  Red River Settlement has become a much more important colony than it was, and bids fair to become still more important--for railway communication will doubtless, ere long, connect it with Canada on the one hand and the Pacific seaboard on the other, while the presence of gold in the Saskatchewan and elsewhere has already made the country much more generally known than it was when the Author sojourned there.  Nevertheless, all these changes--actual and prospective--have only scratched the skirt of the vast wilderness occupied by the fur-traders; and as these still continue their work at the numerous and distant outposts in much the same style as in days of yore, it has been deemed advisable to reprint the book almost without alteration, but with a few corrections.  R.M.  Ballantyne.    CHAPTER ONE.  APPOINTMENT TO THE SERVICE OF THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY--THE \"PRINCE RUPERT\"--THE ANNUAL DINNER OF THE \"H.B.C.\"--FELLOW-VOYAGERS--THREATENING WEATHER--A SQUALL--ISLAND OF LEWIS.  Reader,--I take for granted that you are tolerably well acquainted with the different modes of life and travelling peculiar to European nations. I also presume that you know something of the inhabitants of the East; and, it may be, a good deal of the Americans in general.  But I suspect--at least I would fain hope--that you have only a vague and indefinite knowledge of life in those wild, uncivilised regions of the northern continent of America that surround the shores of Hudson Bay.  I would fain hope this, I say, that I may have the satisfaction of giving you information on the subject, and of showing you that there is a body of civilised men who move, and breathe (pretty cool air, by the way!), and spend their lives in a quarter of the globe as totally different, in most respects, from the part you inhabit, as a beaver, roaming among the ponds and marshes of his native home, is from that sagacious animal when converted into a fashionable hat.  About the middle of May eighteen hundred and forty-one, I was thrown into a state of ecstatic joy by the arrival of a letter appointing me to the enviable situation of apprentice clerk in the service of the Honourable Hudson Bay Company.  To describe the immense extent to which I expanded, both mentally and bodily, upon the receipt of this letter, is impossible; it is sufficient to know that from that moment I fancied myself a complete man of business, and treated my old companions with the condescending suavity of one who knows that he is talking to his inferiors.  A few days after, however, my pride was brought very low indeed, as I lay tossing about in my berth on the tumbling waves of the German Ocean, eschewing breakfast as a dangerous meal, and looking upon dinner with a species of horror utterly incomprehensible by those who have not experienced an attack of sea-sickness.  Miseries of this description, fortunately, do not last long.  In a couple of days we got into the comparatively still water of the Thames; and I, with a host of pale-faced young ladies and cadaverous-looking young gentlemen, emerged for the first time from the interior of the ship, to behold the beauties and wonders of the great metropolis, as we glided slowly up the crowded river.  Leave-taking is a disagreeable subject either to reflect upon or to write about, so we will skip that part of the business and proceed at once to Gravesend, where I stood (having parted from all my friends) on the deck of the good ship _Prince Rupert_, contemplating the boats and crowds of shipping that passed continually before me, and thinking how soon I was to leave the scenes to which I had been so long accustomed for a far-distant land.  I was a boy, however; and this, I think, is equivalent to saying that I did not sorrow long.  My future companion and fellow-clerk, Mr Wiseacre, was pacing the deck near me.  This turned my thoughts into another channel, and set me speculating upon his probable temper, qualities, and age; whether or not he was strong enough to thrash me, and if we were likely to be good friends.  The captain, too, was chatting and laughing with the doctor as carelessly as if he had not the great responsibility of taking a huge ship across a boundless waste of waters, and through fields and islands of ice, to a distant country some three thousand miles to the north-west of England. Thus encouraged, my spirits began to rise, and when the cry arose on deck that the steamer containing the committee of the Honourable Hudson Bay Company was in sight, I sprang up the companion-ladder in a state of mind, if not happy, at least as nearly so as under the circumstances could be expected.  Upon gaining the deck, I beheld a small steamboat passing close under our stern, filled with a number of elderly-looking gentlemen, who eyed us with a very critical expression of countenance.  I had a pretty good guess who these gentlemen were; but had I been entirely ignorant, I should soon have been enlightened by the remark of a sailor, who whispered to his comrade, \"I say, Bill, them's the great guns!\"  I suppose the fact of their being so had a sympathetic effect upon the guns of the Company's three ships--the _Prince Rupert, Prince Albert_, and _Prince of Wales_--for they all three fired a salute of blank cartridge at the steamer as she passed them in succession.  The steamer then ranged alongside of us, and the elderly gentlemen came on board and shook hands with the captain and officers, smiling blandly as they observed the neat, trim appearance of the three fine vessels, which, with everything in readiness for setting sail on the following morning, strained at their cables, as if anxious to commence their struggle with the waves.  It is a custom of the directors of the Hudson Bay Company to give a public dinner annually to the officers of their ships upon the eve of their departure from Gravesend.  Accordingly, one of the gentlemen of the committee, before leaving the vessel, invited the captain and officers to attend; and, to my astonishment and delight, also _begged me_ to honour them with my company.  I accepted the invitation with extreme politeness; and, from inability to express my joy in any other way, winked to my friend Wiseacre, with whom I had become, by this time, pretty familiar.  He, being also invited, winked in return to me; and having disposed of this piece of juvenile freemasonry to our satisfaction, we assisted the crew in giving three hearty cheers, as the little steamer darted from the side and proceeded to the shore.  The dinner, like all other public dinners, was as good and substantial as a lavish expenditure of cash could make it; but really my recollections of it are very indistinct.  The ceaseless din of plates, glasses, knives, forks, and tongues was tremendous; and this, together with the novelty of the scene, the heat of the room, and excellence of the viands, tended to render me oblivious of much that took place. Almost all the faces present were strange to me.  Who were, and who were not, the gentlemen of the committee, was to me matter of the most perfect indifference; and as no one took the trouble to address me in particular, I confined myself to the interesting occupation of trying to make sense of a conversation held by upwards of fifty pairs of lungs at one and the same time.  Nothing intelligible, however, was to be heard, except when a sudden lull in the noise gave a bald-headed old gentleman near the head of the table an opportunity of drinking the health of a red-faced old gentleman near the foot, upon whom he bestowed an amount of flattery perfectly bewildering; and after making the unfortunate red-faced gentleman writhe for half an hour in a fever of modesty, sat down amid thunders of applause.  Whether the applause, by the way, was intended for the speaker or the _speakee_, I do not know; but being quite indifferent, I clapped my hands with the rest.  The red-faced gentleman, now purple with excitement, then rose, and during a solemn silence delivered himself of a speech, to the effect that the day then passing was certainly the happiest in his mortal career, that he could not find words adequately to express the varied feelings which swelled his throbbing bosom, and that he felt quite faint with the mighty load of honour just thrown upon his delighted shoulders by his bald-headed friend.  The red-faced gentleman then sat down to the national air of rat-tat-tat, played in full chorus with knives, forks, spoons, nut-crackers, and knuckles on the polished surface of the mahogany table.  We left the dinner-table at a late hour, and after I, in company with some other youngsters, had done as much mischief as we conveniently could without risking our detention by the strong arm of the law, we went down to the beach and embarked in a boat with the captain for the ship.  How the sailors ever found her in the impenetrable darkness which prevailed all around is a mystery to me to this day.  Find her, however, they did; and in half an hour I was in the land of Nod.  The sun was blazing high in the heavens next morning when I awoke, and gazed around for a few moments to discover where I was; but the rattling of ropes and blocks, the stamping of feet overhead, the shouts of gruff voices, and, above all, a certain strange and disagreeable"]]]
