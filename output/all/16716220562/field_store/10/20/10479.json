And I want you to leave your hat with him. I'll have him check my spectacles, as he calls it,\" Mrs. Rabbit added, \"for I shall not need them. I can hear exactly as well without them.\"  Mr. Rabbit always tried to please his wife. So he let Peter Mink check his hat. But he felt uncomfortable during the whole concert. It was a new hat. And he didn't like the thought of losing it.  That same thing happened in a good many families. Most of the gentlemen said that Peter's idea was a good one, but they thought they would wait till another time. And their wives generally persuaded them to let Peter Mink check something, just to help him along.  But Uncle Jerry Chuck refused to leave a single thing with Peter. He said he had had his hat for a great many years.  The music was not so good as usual that night. And when the fife-and-drum corps played \"Pop! Goes the Weasel!\"--which was their favorite tune, and the first they had ever learned--they had to stop in the middle of it three times, and begin again, because there were so many interruptions. People kept standing up in their seats and looking around to see if Peter Mink was still there. And almost everybody except Uncle Jerry Chuck seemed worried.  But Uncle Jerry had a fine time. You see, whenever the fifers and drummers had to stop, and begin again, Uncle Jerry felt he was getting more music. And he enjoyed it especially because he had found his ticket in the woods and didn't have to pay for it. And on account of what happened when the concert was over, Uncle Jerry was even happier the next day.     UNCLE JERRY HELPS   The concert given by the Grouse boys and the Woodchuck brothers came to an end early. Billy Woodchuck, who was one of the fifers--because he was such a good whistler--made a short speech.  \"We shall have to stop now,\" he said, \"because so many people keep bobbing up and looking around that they make us nervous. Maybe the piece we just played didn't sound quite right. So I want to explain that each of us was playing a different tune, we were so upset. And, of course, we can't keep on.\" Then he made a low bow.  All at once there was a great rush toward the place where Peter Mink was waiting, with the hats and sticks, umbrellas and spectacles, coats and rubbers, and other things that he had checked for the people who came to the concert.  When Peter Mink saw everybody hurrying up all at the same time the smile faded from his face.  \"Don't crowd!\" he begged them. \"There's something here for everybody.\" He took the half oak leaf that Mr. Rabbit handed to him and hunted around until he found another half that seemed to match it. And since that other half was stuck in an old umbrella, he gave the umbrella to Mr. Rabbit.  \"But I didn't leave an umbrella with you. I left a hat!\" Mr. Rabbit cried.  Peter Mink shook his head.  \"You must be mistaken,\" he replied. \"You said yourself my idea was a good one, you remember.\"  Now, Mr. Rabbit didn't intend to lose his new hat. So he began to hunt for it, though Peter Mink told him to stand back.  That was only the first of a number of disputes. There was Mr. Woodchuck--he had left his favorite walking-stick with Peter; and all he received in its place was one worn-out rubber and one mitten with a hole in it.  Old Mr. Crow made a terrible noise when Peter Mink tried to make him take an overcoat that was at least four times too big for him. And Peter insisted on attempting to squeeze Fatty Coon into a coat that was twenty-three sizes too small for him, and which really belonged to Sandy Chipmunk.  There was such an uproar, with all the people complaining, and trying to find their own things, that Peter Mink began to think he had better leave before he found himself in worse trouble. So he slipped away. And nobody noticed that he was gone, because there was such confusion.  It was a long time before everybody went home. And even then there were many who weren't satisfied. For instance, there was Mrs. Rabbit. To be sure, she found a pair of spectacles. But they weren't the ones she had given Peter. And she couldn't see through them very well.  Uncle Jerry Chuck did everything he could to help. He pushed right in where the crowd was thickest and pawed over everything he could find. There were some unkind people who objected, and said that he had no business there, because Peter Mink had checked nothing for him.  But that made no difference to Uncle Jerry. He wouldn't leave until he was ready to go. And the next day he appeared in a brand new hat. He said that his old one had really become shabby. But whenever any one asked him where he got his new hat he pretended not to hear, and hurried away. And after that people liked him even less than they had before.  As for Peter Mink, he never tried to work again. Some of the forest-people said that he had never meant to work, anyhow. They claimed that he had mixed up everything on purpose, to play a trick on people. And for a long time no one saw Peter Mink in that neighborhood.  Mr. Rabbit said that that was the only pleasant part of the whole affair.  [Illustration]     PETER'S NEW COAT   Perhaps you never heard how Mr. Mink lost his tail in the woods, and how Jimmy Rabbit found it and wore it until Mr. Mink came along and took the tail away from him.  Peter Mink knew all about it, anyhow, for Mr. Mink was his uncle. And Peter knew that Jimmy Rabbit was still on the lookout for a fine, bushy tail.  So one day when Peter met Jimmy Rabbit he told Jimmy that if he would go to a certain place, near Broad Brook, he might find something that would interest him.  \"You'll find a small place where the earth has been stirred up,\" Peter said, \"if you look exactly where I tell you to. There's something hidden there. And I won't say just what it is. It might be a tail; and then again, it might not,\" Peter told him. \"Anyhow, if you go and dig in that spot, I know you won't hurry away, when you find what's there.\"  Now, Jimmy Rabbit ought to have known Peter Mink well enough to suspect that there was something wrong. But the moment he heard the word \"tail\" he couldn't start for Broad Brook fast enough.  It took him some time to find the place Peter Mink had described, for a light snow had covered the ground. But at last Jimmy discovered the loose earth, exactly as Peter had said.  Jimmy Rabbit was just going to begin to dig when some one called his name. And he jumped back quickly and looked all around. At first he could see no one. But after a moment he saw some one beckoning to him. It was Paddy Muskrat. He had crawled out of the brook just in time to stop Jimmy Rabbit before it was too late.  \"What are you going to do?\" Paddy Muskrat asked.  \"I'm going to dig in this dirt,\" Jimmy explained. \"I believe there's a tail hidden there. I need one, you know. And Peter Mink told me----\"  \"Peter Mink!\" Paddy interrupted. \"I'd advise you to have nothing to do with Peter Mink. Because sooner or later he'll get you into trouble.... Do you know what's hidden beneath that dirt? I'll tell you: it's a trap! Johnnie Green set it there, thinking he could catch _me_ in it. But I saw him when he buried it. And I wouldn't go near it for anything.\"  As soon as Jimmy heard the word \"trap\" he couldn't get away from that place fast enough. He turned and ran off in great bounds; and he never even stopped to thank Paddy Muskrat for warning him. Now, that was not like Jimmy at all. But you see, he was frightened.  Paddy Muskrat was a wise little chap. And though he had said he wouldn't go near the trap for anything, he thought it was about time somebody fixed the trap so it couldn't do any harm. And very carefully he scraped the dirt away from it.  \"There!\" he said to himself. \"Now everybody can see it. And no one will get caught.\" Then he jumped into Broad Brook again and swam away.  Not long afterwards a slim figure came stealing through the woods. It was Peter Mink; and he had a bag in his hand. He expected to use the bag, too. For he was very sure that he would find Jimmy Rabbit fast in the trap and he intended to put him in the bag and drag him away.  Peter was disappointed when he saw that the trap was empty. And he wondered what had happened.  \"Well, here's the bag, anyhow,\" he said to himself. \"I've got that!\" And he sat down and made a hole in the bag for his head, and two more for his arms, and drew the bag on. It fitted him very well.  \"Why, here I've a new coat!\" he said. \"I see now that the bag would have been much too small to hold Jimmy Rabbit. So it's just as well he didn't get caught in the trap.\"  And Peter Mink walked away. He liked his new coat But probably it wasn't the kind you would care for at all.  [Illustration]     THE DUCK POND   Sometimes Peter Mink grew tired of not knowing where he was going to sleep. And now and then, when he happened to be in some neighborhood that he liked, he would try to find a place where he might stay until he felt like roaming on again.  There was one neighborhood that Peter liked very much. He often said that of all the places in Pleasant Valley that he knew anything about, there was no other as charming as Farmer Green's duck pond.  The reason for his thinking that was that he was specially fond of duck meat. And, of course, it was convenient to be able to swim under water, and steal upon a fat duck, and seize her before she knew that Peter was anywhere near.  [Illustration: PETER PULLED JIMMY OUT OF THE MUD]  Now, Peter Mink learned that there was a muskrat who had built him a house in the bank of the duck pond. And as soon as Peter found out where the muskrat's home was, he drove away the owner and began to live in the house himself.  He found it very comfortable. And he caught a duck every day, until at last Farmer Green noticed that his ducks were disappearing.  \"I believe it's a mink that's taking them,\" Farmer Green said to his son Johnnie. \"If it was a coon, he'd steal more than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21845"],["title","The Tale of Peter Mink (#6)"],["body","one a day.... Now, you take the old gun and go down to the pond and hide. And when I let the ducks go out for their swim, I want you to watch for a mink.\"  Naturally, Peter Mink didn't hear what Farmer Green said. If he had, no doubt he would have left the muskrat's house at once and moved on to some other neighborhood.  Early the next morning Johnnie Green put the old gun on his shoulder and stole down to the edge of the duck pond, where he hid among some cat-tails. He kept his sharp eyes on the bank of the pond, for the ducks were just waddling down from the barnyard, to enjoy their morning swim.  As sharp as Johnnie's eyes were, they did not see Peter Mink as he crept out of his house and stretched himself in the sun. Peter had fallen into the habit of sleeping late and awaking each morning just as the ducks reached the pond.  He saw them as they picked their way down the bank. And for once he didn't seem to care anything about them. To tell the truth, he had breakfasted on duck so often that he had at last grown a bit tired of duck meat. And now he thought that for a change an eel would taste good. For the first time since Peter had driven the muskrat from his home the ducks were safe.  Peter paid no attention to them. And unnoticed by Johnnie Green, he slipped into the water and swam quickly to a place in the pond where there was a warm spring. He knew that the warm water rose to the top of the pond. And he knew, as well, that if an eel should happen to swim over the spring, the rising water would bear him to the surface of the duck pond.  Peter Mink must have been a lucky fellow. For he had hardly reached the spring when he saw an eel right in front of him. He seized the eel and swam toward the bank. And there was such a commotion in the water that Johnnie Green couldn't help noticing it.  You see, the eel did not want to leave the duck pond. He had always lived there, and he liked it, too. So he twisted and squirmed, trying his hardest to break away from Peter Mink.  But Peter swam steadily on, though to be sure he couldn't swim very fast, dragging such a slippery fellow along with him.  But finally he reached the shore. And then he pulled the eel out of the water.  Still the eel tried to get away from him. He wound himself about Peter Mink. And several times he managed to throw Peter head over heels. But Peter Mink always rushed upon the eel again before he could wriggle into the pond.  All this time Johnnie Green had entirely forgotten about his gun. He had never seen such a sight before. And he looked on with staring eyes, until at last Peter dragged the eel away from the pond and into some bushes.  Then Johnnie Green remembered why his father had sent him down to the duck pond. And he ran forward, all ready to shoot.  But Peter Mink had vanished. He had heard Johnnie running; and that was enough to send him skipping away.  Peter was disappointed, because he lost his breakfast. And Johnnie Green was disappointed, because he lost Peter.  In fact, of all those present, the ducks seemed to be the only ones that were really contented. They had a fine swim. And when night came, not one of them was missing.     HOW TO BE LUCKY   There was one thing that Peter Mink couldn't understand. No matter how hard he tried to get Jimmy Rabbit into trouble, Jimmy always managed to escape. Peter wondered what the reason might be. And one day he said to Jimmy:  \"Why is it that you're always able to get out of a scrape?\"  \"Don't you know?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked him. \"I thought everybody knew that.... _It's because I'm lucky_.\"  \"Oh, I know that!\" said Peter Mink. \"What I'd like to know is what makes you so lucky?\"  \"I supposed everybody knew that, too,\" Jimmy Rabbit answered. \"_It's because I have the left hind-foot of a rabbit._\"  Peter Mink answered that he didn't see what that had to do with being lucky.  \"You ask anybody about it,\" Jimmy told him. \"There's Mr. Crow, over on the fence. Go and ask him why I'm lucky.\"  So Peter Mink went over to the fence where Mr. Crow was resting, and put the question to him.  \"Oh, ask me something hard!\" Mr. Crow cried. \"That's too easy. Everybody knows that one.\"  For once Peter Mink remembered the word Jimmy Rabbit had taught him when he was caught beneath the big log.  \"Please!\" he said. \"I'd really like to know, Mr. Crow!\"  \"Left hind-foot!\" Mr. Crow replied briefly. \"It's a rabbit's, you know; and there's nothing like 'em to bring luck.\"  That set Peter Mink to thinking. He couldn't help wishing that he might have Jimmy's left hind-foot for himself. It ought to bring luck to him, he thought, just as it did to Jimmy Rabbit.  After Peter Mink had thought the matter over for some time, he said to Jimmy:  \"I wish you'd come over to the creek with me. There's something there that I want to show you. Of course, it's a long way off; and maybe your mother wouldn't like to have you go so far from home.\"  \"I'll come!\" Jimmy Rabbit said quickly.  \"Maybe you'd better ask your mother first,\" Peter suggested.  But Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.  \"That wouldn't do any good,\" he replied. \"Let's be on our way!\"  So Peter Mink started off toward the creek, with Jimmy close behind him.  At last they reached the bank of the creek. The water was low. And before them was a stretch of mud, which looked dry and firm. There were a few weeds growing in it. And it certainly looked harmless enough.  \"What is it you're going to show me?\" Jimmy asked.  \"Follow me!\" said Peter Mink. \"You'll see pretty soon what it is.\" And he jumped off the bank and landed lightly on his feet on the mud-flat, and started on again.  It never once entered Jimmy Rabbit's head that there could be any danger. So he jumped off the bank, too. And to his great surprise his legs sank entirely out of sight in the mud.  You see, he was at least four times heavier than Peter Mink. And when he landed on the thin, sun-baked crust that covered the mud-flat he had broken through it.  Jimmy Rabbit had a terrible feeling that he was going right down until the mud closed over his head.  \"Help!\" he shrieked. \"Help! Help!\"  But Peter Mink walked straight on. He never once looked around.  And though Jimmy Rabbit called and called, he couldn't seem to make Peter Mink hear him.  [Illustration]     A BARGAIN   Stuck fast in the mud as he was, Jimmy Rabbit couldn't do a thing except shout. Or you might spy there were only two things he could do--shouting being one of them, and keeping still being the other.  At first, Jimmy couldn't help calling out at the top of his lungs. But Peter Mink, you remember, didn't appear to hear him. And there seemed to be no one else near. After a time Jimmy Rabbit grew so hoarse that he stopped shouting for help and tried to think of some way in which he might escape.  It occurred to him that if he could only manage to get his left hind-foot free of the mud (that was his lucky foot, you know) perhaps he would be able to crawl out, somehow. With his lucky foot buried deep in the mud, and quite out of sight, Jimmy thought it was not at all strange that he had not been able to free himself.  So he tried to raise his left hind-foot. At first the mud actually seemed to suck it deeper, as he tried. But after a long time Jimmy succeeded in lifting that foot the least bit. And he was pleased--until he discovered that his other hind-foot had only sunk further into the mire.  At last he happened to look up. And there on the bank, gazing down at him, stood Peter Mink.  \"What are you doing down there?\" Peter Mink called. \"Why didn't you follow me, as I told you to?\"  \"I fell into this mud,\" Jimmy Rabbit told him. \"And I called and called to you. Couldn't you hear me?\"  \"The wind was blowing,\" said Peter--and anyone can see that _that_ was no answer at all.  \"Well, if you'd looked around, you could have seen what happened to me,\" Jimmy Rabbit complained.  \"The sun was shining in my eyes,\" Peter Mink told him--and I shouldn't say that this answer of Peter's was any better than the first.  \"Well--you can help me out of this bog, anyhow,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"So please give me your hand. I'm pretty tired of being stuck here.\"  But Peter Mink never stirred. \"Where's your lucky left hind-foot?\" he asked. \"I should think _that_ could help you out, if anything could.\"  \"The trouble is,\" said Jimmy Rabbit, \"my left hind-foot is so deep in this mire that I can't pull it up where it can do me any good at all. It's the first time I've ever known it to fail me. And you can't really blame the foot, either, for it hasn't a chance. I don't suppose it even knows what a fix I'm in.\"  Still Peter Mink made no move.  \"What are you waiting for?\" Jimmy inquired. \"I've been here long enough.\"  \"Maybe you have--for you,\" said Peter Mink. \"But you haven't been there long enough to suit me.\" And he pretended to start to go away.  Jimmy Rabbit called to him.  \"I'll give you something, if you'll help me,\" he said.  Peter turned around.  \"There's just one thing you can give me,\" he said, \"that will make me willing to pull you out of the mud.\"  \"What's that?\" Jimmy asked him.  \"Your left hind-foot!\" Peter Mink told him. \"I need a lucky foot. I'm always getting into trouble of some sort and a rabbit's left hind-foot would be a great help to me--unless I happened to get stuck in the mud,\" he added with a sly smile. Jimmy Rabbit knew then that Peter Mink had meant all the time to lead him into that mud. He knew that Peter had meant all the time to get his left hind-foot away from him. But he didn't let Peter Mink know that he knew.  \"You can have my left hind-foot,\" Jimmy Rabbit said, \"on two conditions. You must always carry it in your pocket, and you have to agree to take--along with the foot--all the luck and everything else that goes with it.\"  Peter Mink quickly agreed to that.  And Jimmy Rabbit said it was a bargain, and that something awful always happened to people that didn't stand by their bargains.  Well, after that Peter jumped down and pulled Jimmy"]]]
