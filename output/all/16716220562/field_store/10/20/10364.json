The speaking countenance of the Portuguese girl changed as if by magic. She had seen little and thought little about slavery during the brief period of her residence on the coast, and had scarcely realised the fact that Sambo, with the thick lips--her father's gardener--or the black cook and house-maids, were slaves.  It was the first entrance of a new idea with something like power into her mind when she saw a delicate, mild-looking, and pretty negro girl actually offered for sale.  Before she could bethink herself of any remark the door opened, and in walked, unannounced, a man on whose somewhat handsome countenance villainy was clearly stamped.  \"Ha!  Marizano,\" exclaimed Senhor Letotti, rising, \"you have thought better of it, I presume?\"  \"I have, and I agree to your arrangement,\" replied Marizano, in an off-hand, surly tone.  \"There is nothing like necessity,\" returned the Governor, with a laugh. \"'Twere better to enjoy a roving life for a short time with a lightish purse in one's pocket, than to attempt to keep a heavy purse with the addition of several ounces of lead in one's breast!  How say you?\"  Marizano smiled and shrugged his broad shoulders, but made no reply, for just then his attention had been attracted to the slave-girl.  \"For sale?\" he inquired of the Arab carelessly.  Yoosoof bowed his head slightly.  \"How much?\"  \"Come, come, gentlemen,\" interposed the Governor, with a laugh and a glance at his daughter, \"you can settle this matter elsewhere.  Yoosoof has come here to talk with me on other matters.--Now, Maraquita dear, you had better retire for a short time.\"  When the Senhorina had somewhat unwillingly obeyed, the Governor turned to Yoosoof: \"I presume you have no objection to Marizano's presence during our interview, seeing that he is almost as well acquainted with your affairs as yourself?\"  As Yoosoof expressed no objection, the three drew their chairs together and sat down to a prolonged private and very interesting palaver.  We do not mean to try the reader's patience by dragging him through the whole of it; nevertheless, a small portion of what was said is essential to the development of our tale.  \"Well, then, be it as you wish, Yoosoof,\" said the Governor, folding up a fresh cigarette; \"you are one of the most active traders on the coast, and never fail to keep correct accounts with your Governor.  You deserve encouragement but I fear that you run considerable risk.\"  \"I know that; but those who make much must risk much.\"  \"Bravo!\" exclaimed Marizano, with hearty approval; \"nevertheless those who risk most do not always make most.  Contrast yourself with me, now. You risk your boats and cattle, and become rich.  I risk my life, and behold!  I am fleeced.  I have little or nothing left, barely enough to buy yonder girl from you--though I _think_ I have enough for that.\"  He pointed as he spoke to Azinte, who still stood on the spot where she had been left near the door.  \"Tell me,\" resumed Senhor Letotti, \"how do you propose to elude the English cruiser? for I know that her captain has got wind of your whereabouts, and is determined to watch the coast closely--and let me tell you, he is a vigorous, intelligent man.\"  \"You tell me he has a number of captured slaves already in his ship?\" said Yoosoof.  \"Yes, some hundreds, I believe.\"  \"He must go somewhere to land these, I presume?\" rejoined the Arab.  Yoosoof referred here to the fact that when a British cruiser engaged in the suppression of the slave-trade on the east coast of Africa has captured a number of slaves, she is under the necessity of running to the Seychelles Islands, Aden, or some other British port of discharge, to land them there as free men, because, were she to set them free on any part of the coast of Africa, belonging either to Portugal or the Sultan of Zanzibar, they would certainly be recaptured and again enslaved.  When therefore the cruisers are absent--it may be two or three weeks on this duty, the traders in human flesh of course make the most of their opportunity to run cargoes of slaves to those ports in Arabia and Persia where they always find a ready market.  On the present occasion Yoosoof conceived that the captain of the `Firefly' might be obliged to take this course to get rid of the negroes already on board, who were of course consuming his provisions, besides being an extremely disagreeable cargo, many of them being diseased and covered with sores, owing to their cruel treatment on board the slave-dhows.  \"He won't go, however, till he has hunted the coast north and south for you, so he assures me,\" said the Governor, with a laugh.  \"Well, I must start to-night, therefore I shall give him a small pill to swallow which will take him out of the way,\" said Yoosoof, rising to leave the room.  \"I wish you both success,\" said the Governor, as Marizano also rose to depart, \"but I fear that you will find the Englishman very troublesome.--Adieu.\"  The Arab and the half-caste went out talking earnestly together, and followed by Azinte, and immediately afterwards the Senhorina Maraquita entered hurriedly.  \"Father, you must buy that slave-girl for me.  I want a pretty slave all to myself,\" she said, with unwonted vehemence.  \"Impossible, my child,\" replied the Governor kindly, for he was very fond as well as proud of his daughter.  \"Why impossible?  Have you not enough of money?\"  \"Oh yes, plenty of that, but I fear she is already bespoken, and I should not like to interfere--\"  \"Bespoken! do you mean sold?\" cried Maraquita, seizing her father's hands, \"not sold to that man Marizano?\"  \"I think she must be by this time, for he's a prompt man of business, and not easily thwarted when he sets his mind to a thing.\"  The Senhorina clasped her hands before her eyes, and stood for a moment motionless, then rushing wildly from the room she passed into another apartment the windows of which commanded a view of a considerable part of the road which led from the house along the shore.  There she saw the Arab and his friend walking leisurely along as if in earnest converse, while Azinte followed meekly behind.  The Senhorina stood gazing at them with clenched hands, in an agony of uncertainty as to what course she ought to pursue, and so wrapt up in her thoughts that she failed to observe a strapping young lieutenant of H.M.S. steamer `Firefly,' who had entered the room and stood close to her side.  Now this same lieutenant happened to be wildly in love with Senhorina Maraquita.  He had met her frequently at her father's table, where, in company with his captain, he was entertained with great hospitality, and on which occasions the captain was assisted by the Governor in his investigations into the slave-trade.  Lieutenant Lindsay had taken the romantic plunge with all the charming enthusiasm of inexperienced youth, and entertained the firm conviction that, if Senhorina Maraquita did not become \"his,\" life would thenceforth be altogether unworthy of consideration; happiness would be a thing of the past, with which he should have nothing more to do, and death at the cannon's mouth, or otherwise, would be the only remaining gleam of comfort in his dingy future.  \"Something distresses you, I fear,\" began the lieutenant, not a little perplexed to find the young lady in such a peculiar mood.  Maraquita started, glanced at him a moment, and then, with flashing eyes and heightened colour, pointed at the three figures on the road.  \"Yes, Senhor,\" she said; \"I am distressed--deeply so.  Look! do you see yonder two men, and the girl walking behind them?\"  \"I do.\"  \"Quick! fly after them and bring them hither--the Arab and the girl I mean--not the other man.  Oh, be quick, else they will be out of sight and then she will be lost; quick, if you--if--if you really mean what you have so often told me.\"  Poor Lindsay!  It was rather a sudden and severe test of fidelity to be sent forth to lay violent hands on a man and woman and bring them forcibly to the Governor's house, without any better reason than that a self-willed girl ordered him so to do; at the same time, he perceived that, if he did not act promptly, the retreating figures would soon turn into the town, and be hopelessly beyond his power of recognition.  \"But--but--\" he stammered, \"if they won't come--?\"  \"They _must_ come.  Threaten my father's high displeasure.--Quick, Senhor,\" cried the young lady in a commanding tone.  Lindsay flung open the casement and leapt through it as being the shortest way out of the house, rushed with undignified speed along the road, and overtook the Arab and his friend as they were about to turn into one of the narrow lanes of the town.  \"Pardon me,\" said the lieutenant laying his hand on Yoosoof's shoulder in his anxiety to make sure of him, \"will you be so good as to return with me to the Governor's residence?\"  \"By whose orders?\" demanded Yoosoof with a look of surprise.  \"The orders of the Senhorina Maraquita.\"  The Arab hesitated, looked somewhat perplexed, and said something in Portuguese to Marizano, who pointed to the slave-girl, and spoke with considerable vehemence.  Lindsay did not understand what was said, but, conjecturing that the half-caste was proposing that Azinte should remain with him, he said:--\"The girl must return with you--if you would not incur the Governor's displeasure.\"  Marizano, on having this explained to him, looked with much ferocity at the lieutenant and spoke to Yoosoof in wrathful tones, but the latter shook his head, and the former, who disliked Marizano's appearance excessively, took not the least notice of him.  \"I do go,\" said Yoosoof, turning back.  Motioning to Azinte to follow, he retraced his steps with the lieutenant and the slave--while Marizano strode into the town in a towering rage.  We need scarcely say that Maraquita, having got possession of Azinte, did not find it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21748"],["title","Black Ivory (#5)"],["body"," to persuade her father to purchase her, and that Yoosoof, although sorry to disappoint Marizano, who was an important ally and assistant in the slave-trade, did not see his way to thwart the wishes of the Governor, whose power to interfere with his trade was very great indeed, and to whom he was under the necessity of paying head-money for every slave that was exported by him from that part of the coast.  Soon after Azinte had been thus happily rescued from the clutches of two of the greatest villains on the East African coast--where villains of the deepest dye are by no means uncommon--Lindsay met Captain Romer of the `Firefly' on the beach, with his first lieutenant Mr Small, who, by the way, happened to be one of the largest men in his ship.  The three officers had been invited to dine that day with the Governor, and as there seemed no particular occasion for their putting to sea that night, and a fresh supply of water had to be taken on board, the invitation had been accepted, all the more readily, too, that Captain Romer thought it afforded an opportunity for obtaining further information as to the movements of certain notorious slavers who were said to be thereabouts at that time.  Lieutenant Lindsay had been sent ashore at an earlier part of the day, accompanied by one of the sailors who understood Portuguese, and who, being a remarkably intelligent man, might, it was thought, acquire some useful information from some of the people of the town.  \"Well, Mr Lindsay, has Jackson been of any use to you?\" inquired the captain.  \"Not yet,\" replied the lieutenant; \"at least I know not what he may have done, not having met him since we parted on landing; but I have myself been so fortunate as to rescue a slave-girl under somewhat peculiar circumstances.\"  \"Truly, a most romantic and gallant affair,\" said the captain, laughing, when Lindsay had related the incident, \"and worthy of being mentioned in despatches; but I suspect, considering the part that the Senhorina Maraquita played in it and the fact that you only rescued the girl from one slaveholder in order to hand her over to another, the less that is said about the subject the better!--But here comes Jackson.  Perhaps he may have learned something about the scoundrels we are in search of.\"  The seaman referred to approached and touched his cap.  \"What news?\" demanded the captain, who knew by the twinkle in Jack's eye that he had something interesting to report.  \"I've diskivered all about it sir,\" replied the man, with an ill-suppressed chuckle.  \"Indeed! come this way.  Now, let's hear what you have to tell,\" said the captain, when at a sufficient distance from his boat to render the conversation quite private.  \"Well, sir,\" began Jackson, \"w'en I got up into the town, arter leavin' Mr Lindsay, who should I meet but a man as had bin a messmate o' mine aboard of that there Portuguese ship w'ere I picked up a smatterin' o' the lingo?  Of course we hailed each other and hove-to for a spell, and then we made sail for a grog-shop, where we spliced the main-brace. After a deal o' tackin' and beatin' about, which enabled me to find out that he'd left the sea an' taken to business on his own account, which in them parts seems to mean loafin' about doin' little or nothin', I went slap into the subject that was uppermost in my mind, and says I to him, says I, they does a deal o' slavin' on this here coast, it appears--Black Ivory is a profitable trade, ain't it?  W'y, sir, you should have seen the way he grinned and winked, and opened out on 'em.--`Black Ivory!' says he, `w'y, Jackson, there's more slaves exported from these here parts annooally than would fill a good-sized city.  I could tell you--but,' says he, pullin' up sudden, `you won't split on me, messmate?'  `Honour bright,' says I, `if ye don't call tellin' my captain splittin'.'  `Oh no,' says he, with a laugh, `it's little I care what _he_ knows, or does to the pirates--for that's their true name, and murderers to boot--but don't let it come to the Governor's ears, else I'm a ruined man.'  I says I wouldn't and then he goes on to tell me all sorts of hanecdots about their doin's--that they does it with the full consent of the Governor, who gets head-money for every slave exported; that nearly all the Governors on the coast are birds of the same feather, and that the Governor-General himself, [See Consul McLeod's _Travels in Eastern Africa_, volume one page 306.] at Mozambique, winks at it and makes the subordinate Governors pay him tribute.  Then he goes on to tell me more about the Governor of this here town, an' says that, though a kind-hearted man in the main, and very good to his domestic slaves, he encourages the export trade, because it brings him in a splendid revenue, which he has much need of, poor man, for like most, if not all, of the Governors on the coast, he do receive nothin' like a respectible salary from the Portuguese Government at home, and has to make it up by slave-tradin'.\"  [See McLeod's _Travels_, volume one page 293.]  It must be explained here that British cruisers were, and still are, kept on the east coast of Africa, for the purpose of crushing only the _export_ slave-trade.  They claim no right to interfere with \"domestic slavery,\" an institution which is still legal in the dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar and in the so-called colonies of Portugal on that coast.  \"But that is not the best of it, sir,\" continued Jackson, with a respectful smile, \"after we'd had our jaw out I goes off along the road by the beach to think a bit what I'd best do, an' have a smoke--for that's wot usually sets my brain to work full-swing.  Bein' hot I lay down in the lee of a bush to excogitate.  You see, sir, my old messmate told me that there are two men here, the worst characters he ever know'd--ashore or afloat.  One they calls Yoosoof--an Arab he is; the other Marizano--he's a slave-catcher, and an outlaw just now, havin' taken up arms and rebelled against the Portuguese authorities. Nevertheless these two men are secretly hand and glove with the Governor here, and at this moment there are said to be a lot o' slaves ready for shipment and only waitin' till the `Firefly' is out of the way.  More than this my friend could not tell, so that's w'y I went to excogitate.--I beg parding, sir, for being so long wi' my yarn, but I ain't got the knack o' cuttin' it short, sir, that's w'ere it is.\"  \"Never mind, lad; go on to the end of it,\" replied the captain.  \"Did you excogitate anything more?\"  \"I can't say as I did, sir, but it was cooriously enough excogitated _for_ me.  W'en I was lying there looking through the bush at the bay, I sees two men comin' along, arm in arm.  One of 'em was an Arab.  W'en they was near I saw the Arab start; I thought he'd seen me, and didn't like me.  No more did I like him or his comrade.  However, I was wrong, for after whisperin' somethin' very earnest-like to his friend, who laughed very much; but said nothin', they came and sat down not far from the bush where I lay.  Now, thinks I, it ain't pleasant to be an eavesdropper, but as I'm here to find out the secrets of villains, and as these two look uncommon like villains, I'll wait a bit; if they broach business as don't consarn me or her Majesty the Queen, I'll sneeze an' let 'em know I'm here, before they're properly under weigh; but if they speaks of wot I wants to know, I'll keep quiet.  Well, sir, to my surprise, the Arab--he speaks in bad English, whereby I came to suppose the other was an Englishman, but, if he is, the climate must have spoiled him badly, for I never did see such a ruffian to look at. But he only laughed, and didn't speak, so I couldn't be sure.  Well, to come to the pint, sir, the Arab said he'd got hold of two shipwrecked Englishmen, whom he meant to put on board of his dhow, at that time lyin' up a river not three miles off, and full of slaves, take 'em off the coast, seize 'em when asleep, and heave 'em overboard; the reason bein' that he was afraid, if they was left ashore here, they'd discover the town, which they are ignorant of at present, and give the alarm to our ship, sir, an' so prevent him gettin' clear off, which he means to attempt about midnight just after the moon goes down.\"  This unexpected information was very gratifying to Captain Romer, who immediately gave orders to get steam up and have everything in readiness to start the moment he should make his appearance on board, at the same time enjoining absolute silence on his lieutenants and Jackson, who all returned to the `Firefly,' chuckling inwardly.  If they had known that the Arab's information, though partly true, was a _ruse_; that Jackson had indeed been observed by the keen-eyed Oriental, who had thereupon sat down purposely within earshot, and after a whispered hint to his companion, gave forth such information as would be likely to lead the British cruiser into his snares--speaking in bad English, under the natural impression that the sailor did not understand Portuguese, to the immense amusement of Marizano, who understood the _ruse_, though he did not understand a single word of what his companion said--had they known all this, we say, it is probable that they would have chuckled less, and--but why indulge in probabilities when facts are before us?  The sequel will show that the best-laid plans may fail.    CHAPTER THREE.  RELATES THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF HAROLD AND DISCO, AND LIFTS THE CURTAIN A LITTLE HIGHER IN REGARD TO THE SLAVE-TRADE.  So Captain Romer and his lieutenants went to dine with the worthy Governor Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, while Yoosoof returned to the creek to carry out his deep-laid plans.  In regard to the dinner, let it suffice to observe that it was good, and that the Governor was urbane, hospitable, communicative, and every way agreeable.  It is probable that if he had been trained in another sphere and in different circumstances he might have been a better"]]]
