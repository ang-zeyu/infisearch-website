Being a man of promptitude, his first act, on making this discovery, was to lower the sail.  This was, fortunately, done in time; had he kept it up a few minutes longer, he must inevitably have passed the only opening in the reef that existed on that side of the island.  This opening was not more than fifty yards wide.  To the right and left of it the breakers on the reef extended, in lines of seething foam.  Already the raft was rolling in the commotion caused by these breakers, as it drifted towards the opening.  Jarwin was by no means devoid of courage.  Many a time, in days gone by, when his good ship was tossing on the stormy sea, or scudding under bare poles, had he stood on the deck with unshaken confidence and a calm heart, but now he was face to face with the seaman's most dreaded enemy--\"breakers ahead!\"--nay, worse, breakers around him everywhere, save at that one narrow passage, which appeared so small, and so involved in the general turmoil, as to afford scarcely an element of hope.  For the first time in his life Jarwin's heart sank within him--at least so he said in after years while talking of the event--but we suspect that John was underrating himself.  At all events, he showed no symptoms of fear as he sat there calmly awaiting his fate.  As the raft approached the reef, each successive roller lifted it up and dropped it behind more violently, until at last the top of one of the glittering green walls broke just as it passed under the end of the raft nearest the shore.  Jarwin now knew that the next billow would seal his fate.  There was a wide space between each of those mighty waves.  He looked out to sea, and beheld the swell rising and taking form, and increasing in speed as it came on.  Calmly divesting himself of his coat and boots, he sat down beside his dog, and awaited the event.  At that moment he observed, with intense gratitude to the Almighty, that the raft was drifting so straight towards the middle of the channel in the reef, that there seemed every probability of being carried through it; but the hope thus raised was somewhat chilled by the feeling of weakness which pervaded his frame.  \"Now, Cuffy,\" said he, patting the terrier gently, \"rouse up, my doggie; we must make a brave struggle for life.  It's neck or nothing this time. If we touch that reef in passing, Cuff, you an' I shall be food for the sharks to-night, an' it's my opinion that the shark as gits us won't have much occasion to boast of his supper.\"  The sailor ceased speaking abruptly.  As he looked back at the approaching roller he felt solemnised and somewhat alarmed, for it appeared so perpendicular and so high from his low position, that it seemed as if it would fall on and overwhelm the raft.  There was, indeed, some danger of this.  Glancing along its length, Jarwin saw that here and there the edge was lipping over, while in one place, not far off, the thunder of its fall had already begun.  Another moment, and it appeared to hang over his head; the raft was violently lifted at the stern, caught up, and whirled onward at railway speed, like a cork in the midst of a boiling cauldron of foam.  The roar was deafening.  The tumultuous heaving almost overturned it several times.  Jarwin held on firmly to the mast with his right arm, and grasped the terrier with his left hand, for the poor creature had not strength to resist such furious motion.  It all passed with bewildering speed.  It seemed as if, in one instant, the raft was hurled through the narrows, and launched into the calm harbour within.  An eddy, at the inner side of the opening, swept it round, and fixed the end of one of the largest spars of which it was composed on the beach.  There were fifty yards or so of sandy coral-reef between the beach outside, that faced the sea, and the beach inside, which faced the land; yet how great the difference!  The one beach, buffeted for ever, day and night, by the breakers--in calm by the grand successive rollers that, as it were, symbolised the ocean's latent power--in storm by the mad deluge of billows which displayed that power in all its terrible grandeur.  The other beach, a smooth, sloping circlet of fair white sand, laved only by the ripples of the lagoon, or by its tiny wavelets, when a gale chanced to sweep over it from the land.  Jarwin soon gained this latter beach with Cuffy in his arms, and sat down to rest, for his strength had been so much reduced that the mere excitement of passing through the reef had almost exhausted him.  Cuffy, however, seemed to derive new life from the touch of earth again, for it ran about in a staggering drunken sort of way; wagged its tail at the root,--without, however, being able to influence the point,--and made numerous futile efforts to bark.  In the midst of its weakly gambols the terrier chanced to discover a dead fish on the sands.  Instantly it darted forward and began to devour it with great voracity.  \"Halo!  Cuffy,\" shouted Jarwin, who observed him; \"ho! hold on, you rascal! share and share alike, you know.  Here, fetch it here!\"  Cuffy had learned the first great principle of a good and useful life-- whether of man or beast--namely, prompt obedience.  That meek but jovial little dog, on receiving this order, restrained its appetite, lifted the fish in its longing jaws, and, carrying it to his master, humbly laid it at his feet.  He was rewarded with a hearty pat on the head, and a full half of the coveted fish--for Jarwin appeared to regard the \"share-and-share-alike\" principle as a point of honour between them.  The fish was not good, neither was it large, and of course it was raw, besides being somewhat decayed; nevertheless, both man and dog ate it, bones and all, with quiet satisfaction.  Nay, reader, do not shudder! If you were reduced to similar straits, you would certainly enjoy, with equal gusto, a similar meal, supposing that you had the good fortune to get it.  Small though it was, it sufficed to appease the appetite of the two friends, and to give them a feeling of strength which they had not experienced for many a day.  Under the influence of this feeling, Jarwin remarked to Cuffy, that \"a man could eat a-most anything when hard put to it,\" and that \"it wos now high time to think about goin' ashore.\"  To which Cuffy replied with a bark, which one might imagine should come from a dog in the last stage of whooping-cough, and with a wag of his tail--not merely at the root thereof, but a distinct wag--that extended obviously along its entire length to the extreme point.  Jarwin observed the successful effort, laughed feebly, and said, \"Brayvo, Cuffy,\" with evident delight; for it reminded him of the days when that little shred of a door-mat, in the might of its vigour, was wont to wag its tail so violently as to convulse its whole body, insomuch that it was difficult to decide whether the tail wagged the body, or the body the tail!  But, although Jarwin made light of his sufferings, his gaunt, wasted frame would have been a sad sight to any pitiful spectator, as with weary aspect and unsteady gait he moved about on the sandy ridge in search of more food, or gazed with longing eyes on the richly-wooded island.  For it must be remembered that our castaway had not landed on the island itself, but on that narrow ring of coral-reef which almost encircled it, and from which it was separated by the lagoon, or enclosed portion of the sea, which was, as we have said, about a quarter of a mile wide.  John Jarwin would have thought little of swimming over that narrow belt of smooth water in ordinary circumstances, but now he felt that his strength was not equal to such a feat.  Moreover, he knew that there were sharks in these waters, so he dismissed the idea of swimming, and cast about in his mind how he should manage to get across.  With Jarwin, action soon followed thought.  He resolved to form a small raft out of portions of the large one.  Fortunately his clasp-knife had been attached, as seamen frequently have it, to his waist-belt, when he forsook his ship.  This was the only implement that he possessed, but it was invaluable.  With it he managed to cut the thick ropes that he could not have untied, and, in the course of two hours--for he laboured with extreme difficulty--a few broken planks and spars were lashed together. Embarking on this frail vessel with his dog, he pushed off, and using a piece of plank for an oar, sculled himself over the lagoon.  It was touching, even to himself, to observe the slowness of his progress.  All the strength that remained in him was barely sufficient to move the raft.  But the lagoon was as still as a mill-pond.  Looking down into its clear depths, he could see the rich gardens of coral and sea-weed, among which fish, of varied and brilliant colours, sported many fathoms below.  The air, too, was perfectly calm.  Very slowly he left the reef astern; the middle of the lagoon was gained; then, gradually, he neared the island-shore, but oh! it was a long, weary pull, although the space was so short, and, to add to the poor man's misery, the fish which he had eaten caused him intolerable thirst.  But he reached the shore at last.  The first thing that greeted his eye as he landed was the sparkle of a clear spring at the foot of some cocoanut-trees.  He staggered eagerly towards it, and fell down beside a hollow in the rock, like a large cup or bowl, which had been scooped out by it.  Who shall presume to describe the feelings of that shipwrecked sailor as he and his dog drank from the same cup at that sparkling crystal fountain?  Delicious odours of lime and citron trees, and well-nigh forgotten herbage, filled his nostrils, and the twitter of birds thrilled his ears, seeming to bid him welcome to the land, as he sank down on the soft grass, and raised his eyes in thanksgiving to heaven. An irresistible tendency to sleep then seized him.  \"If there's a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21742"],["title","Jarwin and Cuffy (#2)"],["body","upon earth, I'm in it now,\" he murmured, as he laid down his head and closed his eyes.  Cuffy, nestling into his breast, placed his chin on his neck, and heaved a deep, contented sigh.  This was the last sound the sailor recognised, as he sank into profound repose.    CHAPTER TWO.  ISLAND LIFE.  There are few of the minor sweets of life more agreeable than to awake refreshed, and to become gradually impressed with the conviction that you are a perfectly free agent,--that you may rise when you choose, or lie still if you please, or do what you like, without let or hindrance.  So thought our hero, John Jarwin, when he awoke, on the same spot where he had thrown himself down, after several hours of life-giving slumber. He was still weak, but his weakness did not now oppress him.  The slight meal, the long draught, and the deep sleep, had restored enough of vigour to his naturally robust frame to enable him, while lying on his back, to enjoy his existence once more.  He was, on first awaking, in that happy condition of mind and body in which the former does not care to think and the latter does not wish to move--yet both are pleased to be largely conscious of their own identity.  That he had not moved an inch since he lay down, became somewhat apparent to Jarwin from the fact that Cuffy's chin still rested immovable on his neck, but his mind was too indolent to pursue the thought.  He had not the most remote idea as to where he was, but he cared nothing for that.  He was in absolute ignorance of the time of day, but he cared, if possible, still less for that.  Food, he knew, was necessary to his existence, but the thought gave him no anxiety.  In short, John and his dog were in a state of quiescent felicity, and would probably have remained so for some hours to come, had not the setting sun shone forth at that moment with a farewell gleam so intense, that it appeared to set the world of clouds overhead on fire, converting them into hills and dales, and towering domes and walls and battlements of molten glass and gold.  Even to the wearied seaman's sleepy vision the splendour of the scene became so fascinating, that he shook off his lethargy, and raised himself on one elbow.  \"Why, Cuffy!\" he exclaimed, to the yawning dog, \"seems to me that the heavens is a-fire!  Hope it won't come on dirty weather before you an' I get up somethin' in the shape o' a hut.  That minds me, doggie,\" he added, glancing slowly round him, \"that we must look after prokoorin' of our supper.  I do believe we've bin an' slep away a whole day!  Well, well, it don't much matter, seein' that we hain't got no dooty for to do--no trick at the wheel, no greasin' the masts--wust of all, no splicin' the main brace, and no grub.\"  This latter remark appeared to reach the understanding of the dog, for it uttered a melancholy howl as it gazed into its master's eyes.  \"Ah, Cuffy!\" continued the sailor with a sigh, \"you've good reason to yowl, for the half of a rotten fish ain't enough for a dog o' your appetite.  Come, let's see if we can't find somethin' more to our tastes.\"  Saying this the man rose, stretched himself, yawned, looked helplessly round for a few seconds, and then, with a cheery \"Hallo!  Cuff, come along, my hearty,\" went down to the beach in quest of food.  In this search he was not unsuccessful, for the beach abounded with shell-fish of various kinds; but Jarwin ate sparingly of these, having been impressed, in former years, by some stories which he had heard of shipwrecked sailors having been poisoned by shell-fish.  For the same reason he administered a moderate supply to Cuffy, telling him that \"it warn't safe wittles, an' that if they was to be pisoned, it was as well to be pisoned in moderation.\"  The dog, however, did not appear to agree with its master on this point, for it went picking up little tit-bits here and there, and selfishly ignoring the \"share-and-share-alike\" compact, until it became stuffed alarmingly, and could scarcely follow its master back to the fountain.  Arrived there, the two slaked their thirst together, and then Jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe, and Cuffy lay down to suffer the well-merited reward of gluttony.  We have said that Jarwin sat down to enjoy a pipe, but he did _not_ enjoy it that night, for he discovered that the much-loved little implement, which he had cherished tenderly while on the raft, was broken to atoms in his coat-pocket!  In his eagerness to drink on first landing, he had thrown himself down on it, and now smoking was an impossibility, at least for that night.  He reflected, however, that it would not be difficult to make a wooden pipe, and that cigarettes might perhaps be made by means of leaves, or bark, while his tobacco lasted; so he consoled himself in the meantime with hopeful anticipations, and a quid.  Being still weak and weary, he lay down again beside the fountain, and almost immediately fell into a sleep, which was not at all disturbed by the starts and groans and frequent yelps of Cuffy, whose sufferings could scarcely have been more severe if he had supped on turtle-soup and venison, washed down with port and claret.  Thus did those castaways spend the first night on their island.  It must not be supposed, however, that we are going to trace thus minutely every step and sensation in the career of our unfortunate friends.  We have too much to tell that is important to devote our \"valuable space\" to everyday incidents.  Nevertheless, as it is important that our readers should understand our hero thoroughly, and the circumstances in which we find him, it is necessary that we should draw attention to some incidents--trifling in themselves, but important in their effects--which occurred to John Jarwin soon after his landing on the island.  The first of these incidents was, that John one day slipped his foot on a tangle-covered rock, and fell into the sea.  A small matter this, you will say, to a man who could swim, and in a climate so warm that a dip, with or without clothes, was a positive luxury.  Most true; and had the wetting been all, Jarwin would have had nothing to annoy him; for at the time the accident occurred he had been a week on the island, had managed to pull and crack many cocoa-nuts, and had found various excellent wild-fruits, so that his strength, as well as Cuffy's, had been much restored.  In fact, when Jarwin's head emerged from the brine, after his tumble, he gave vent to a shout of laughter, and continued to indulge in hilarious demonstrations all the time he was wringing the water out of his garments, while the terrier barked wildly round him.  But suddenly, in the very midst of a laugh, he became grave and pale,-- so pale, that a more obtuse creature than Cuffy might have deemed him ill.  While his mouth and eyes slowly opened wider and wider, his hands slapped his pockets, first his trousers, then his vest, then his coat, after which they fell like pistol-shots on his thighs, and he exclaimed, in a voice of horror--\"Gone!\"  Ay, there could be no doubt about it; every particle of his tobacco was gone!  It had never been much, only three or four plugs; but it was strong, and he had calculated that, what with careful husbanding, and mixing it with other herbs, it would last him for a considerable length of time.  In a state bordering on frenzy, the sailor rushed back to the rock from which he had fallen.  The \"baccy\" was not there.  He glanced right and left--no sign of it floating on the sea.  In he went, head foremost, like a determined suicide; down, down to the bottom, for he was an expert diver, and rioted among the coral groves, and horrified the fish, until he well-nigh burst, and rose to the surface with a groan and splutter that might have roused envy in a porpoise.  Then down he went again, while Cuffy stood on the shore regarding him with mute amazement.  Never did pearl-diver grope for the treasures of the deep with more eager intensity than did John Jarwin search for that lost tobacco.  He remained under water until he became purple in the face, and, coming to the surface after each dive, stayed only long enough to recharge his lungs with air.  How deeply he regretted at that time the fact that man's life depended on so frequent and regular a supply of atmospheric air!  How enviously he glanced at the fish which, with open eyes and mouths, appeared to regard him with inexpressible astonishment--as well they might!  At last Jarwin's powers of endurance began to give way, and he was compelled to return to the shore, to the great relief of Cuffy, which miserable dog, if it had possessed the smallest amount of reasoning power, must have deemed its master hopelessly insane.  \"But why so much ado about a piece of tobacco?\" we hear some lady-reader or non-smoker exclaim.  Just because our hero was, and had been since his childhood, an inveterate smoker.  Of course we cannot prove our opinion to be correct, but we are inclined to believe that if all the smoke that had issued from Jarwin's lips, from the period of his commencing down to that terrible day when he lost his last plug, could have been collected in one vast cloud, it would have been sufficient to have kept a factory chimney going for a month or six weeks.  The poor man knew his weakness. He had several times tried to get rid of the habit which had enslaved him, and, by failing, had come to know the tyrannical power of his master.  He had once been compelled by circumstances to forego his favourite indulgence for three entire days, and retained so vivid a recollection of his sufferings that he made up his mind never more to strive for freedom, but to enjoy his pipe as long as he lived--to swim with the current, in fact, and take it easy.  It was of no use that several men, who objected to smoking from principle, and had themselves gone through the struggle and come off victorious, pointed out that if he went on at his present rate, it would cut short his life.
