Ruby rose and followed.  \"You haven't any--\"  The captain stopped, stroked his bald head, and looked perplexed.  \"Well, uncle?\"  \"Well, nephy, you haven't--in short, have ye got any money about you, lad?\"  \"Money? yes, a _little_; but why do you ask?\"  \"Well, the fact is, that your poor mother is hard up just now,\" said the captain earnestly, \"an' I've given her the last penny I have o' my own; but she's quite--\"  Ruby interrupted his uncle at this point with a boisterous laugh.  At the same time he flung open the door and dragged the old man with gentle violence back to the kitchen.  \"Come here, uncle.\"  \"But, avast! nephy, I haven't told ye all yet.\"  \"Oh! don't bother me with such trifles just now,\" cried Ruby, thrusting his uncle into a chair and resuming his own seat at his mother's side; \"we'll speak of that at some other time; meanwhile let me talk to mother.\"  \"Minnie, dear,\" he continued, \"who keeps the cash here; you or mother?\"  \"Well, we keep it between us,\" said Minnie, smiling; \"your mother keeps it in her drawer and gives me the key when I want any, and I keep an account of it.\"  \"Ah! well, mother, I have a favour to ask of you before I go.\"  \"Well, _Ruby_?\"  \"It is that you will take care of my cash for me.  I have got a goodish lot of it, and find it rather heavy to carry in my pockets--so, hold your apron steady and I'll give it to you.\"  Saying this he began to empty handful after handful of coppers into the old woman's apron; then, remarking that \"that was all the browns\", he began to place handful after handful of shillings and sixpences on the top of the pile until the copper was hid by silver.  The old lady, as usual when surprised, became speechless; the captain smiled and Minnie laughed, but when Ruby put his hand into another pocket and began to draw forth golden sovereigns, and pour them into his mother's lap, the captain became supremely amazed, the old woman laughed, and,--so strangely contradictory and unaccountable is human nature,--Minnie began to cry.  Poor girl! the tax upon her strength had been heavier than anyone knew, heavier than she could bear, and the sorrow of knowing, as she had come to know, that it was all in vain, and that her utmost efforts had failed to \"keep the wolf from the door\", had almost broken her down.  Little wonder, then, that the sight of sudden and ample relief upset her altogether.  But her tears, being tears of joy, were soon and easily dried--all the more easily that it was Ruby who undertook to dry them.  Mrs Brand sat up late that night, for there was much to tell and much to hear.  After she had retired to rest the other three continued to hold converse together until grey dawn began to appear through the chinks in the window-shutters.  Then the two men rose and went out, while Minnie laid her pretty little head on the pillow beside Mrs Brand, and sought, and found, repose.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  THE SCENE CHANGES--RUBY IS VULCANISED.  As Captain Ogilvy had predicted, Ruby was at once engaged as an assistant blacksmith on the Bell Rock.  In fact, they were only too glad to get such a powerful, active young fellow into their service; and he was shipped off with all speed in the sloop _Smeaton_, with a few others who were going to replace some men who had become ill and were obliged to leave.  A light westerly breeze was blowing when they cast off the moorings of the sloop.  \"Goodbye, Ruby,\" said the captain, as he was about to step on the pier. \"Remember your promise, lad, to keep quiet, and don't try to get ashore, or to hold communication with anyone till you hear from me.\"  \"All right, uncle, I won't forget, and I'll make my mind easy, for I know that my case is left in good hands.\"  Three hours elapsed ere the _Smeaton_ drew near to the Bell Rock. During this time, Ruby kept aloof from his fellow-workmen, feeling disposed to indulge the sad thoughts which filled his mind.  He sat down on the bulwarks, close to the main shrouds, and gazed back at the town as it became gradually less and less visible in the faint light of morning.  Then he began to ponder his unfortunate circumstances, and tried to imagine how his uncle would set about clearing up his character and establishing his innocence; but, do what he would, Ruby could not keep his mind fixed for any length of time on any subject or line of thought, because of a vision of sweetness which it is useless to attempt to describe, and which was always accompanied by, and surrounded with, a golden halo.  At last the youth gave up the attempt to fix his thoughts, and allowed them to wander as they chose, seeing that they were resolved to do so whether he would or no.  The moment these thoughts had the reins flung on their necks, and were allowed to go where they pleased, they refused, owing to some unaccountable species of perversity, to wander at all, but at once settled themselves comfortably down beside the vision with golden hair, and remained there.  This agreeable state of things was rudely broken in upon by the hoarse voice of the mate shouting--  \"Stand by to let go the anchor.\"  Then Ruby sprang on the deck and shook himself like a great mastiff, and resolved to devote himself, heart and soul, from that moment, to the work in which he was about to engage.  The scene that presented itself to our hero when he woke up from his dreams would have interested and excited a much less enthusiastic temperament than his.  The breeze had died away altogether, just as if, having wafted the _Smeaton_ to her anchorage, there were no further occasion for its services.  The sea was therefore quite calm, and as there had only been light westerly winds for some time past, there was little or none of the swell that usually undulates the sea.  One result of this was, that, being high water when the _Smeaton_ arrived, there was no sign whatever of the presence of the famous Bell Rock.  It lay sleeping nearly two fathoms below the sea, like a grim giant in repose, and not a ripple was there to tell of the presence of the mariner's enemy.  The sun was rising, and its slanting beams fell on the hulls of the vessels engaged in the service, which lay at anchor at a short distance from each other.  These vessels, as we have said, were four in number, including the _Smeaton_.  The others were the _Sir Joseph Banks_, a small schooner-rigged vessel; the _Patriot_, a little sloop; and the _Pharos_ lightship, a large clumsy-looking Dutch-built ship, fitted with three masts, at the top of which were the lanterns.  It was intended that this vessel should do duty as a lightship until the lighthouse should be completed.  Besides these there were two large boats, used for landing stones and building materials on the rock.  These vessels lay floating almost motionless on the calm sea, and at first there was scarcely any noise aboard of them to indicate that they were tenanted by human beings, but when the sound of the _Smeaton's_ cable was heard there was a bustle aboard of each, and soon faces were seen looking inquisitively over the sides of the ships.  The _Smeaton's_ boat was lowered after the anchor was let go, and the new hands were transferred to the _Pharos_, which was destined to be their home for some time to come.  Just as they reached her the bell rang for breakfast, and when Ruby stepped upon the deck he found himself involved in all the bustle that ensues when men break off from work and make preparation for the morning meal.  There were upwards of thirty artificers on board the lightship at this time.  Some of these, as they hurried to and fro, gave the new arrivals a hearty greeting, and asked, \"What news from the shore?\"  Others were apparently too much taken up with their own affairs to take notice of them.  While Ruby was observing the busy scene with absorbing interest, and utterly forgetful of the fact that he was in any way connected with it, an elderly gentleman, whose kind countenance and hearty manner gave indication of a genial spirit within, came up and accosted him:  \"You are our assistant blacksmith, I believe?\"  \"Yes, sir, I am,\" replied Ruby, doffing his cap, as if he felt instinctively that he was in the presence of someone of note.  \"You have had considerable practice, I suppose, in your trade?\"  \"A good deal, sir, but not much latterly, for I have been at sea for some time.\"  \"At sea?  Well, that won't be against you here,\" returned the gentleman, with a meaning smile.  \"It would be well if some of my men were a little more accustomed to the sea, for they suffer much from sea-sickness.  You can go below, my man, and get breakfast.  You'll find your future messmate busy at his, I doubt not.  Here, steward,\" (turning to one of the men who chanced to pass at the moment,) \"take Ruby Brand--that is your name, I think?\"  \"It is, sir.\"  \"Take Brand below, and introduce him to James Dove as his assistant.\"  The steward escorted Ruby down the ladder that conducted to those dark and littered depths of the ship's hull that were assigned to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21747"],["title","The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers (#0)"],["body","LONELY ISLAND; OR, THE REFUGE OF THE MUTINEERS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE REFUGE OF THE MUTINEERS.  THE MUTINY.  On a profoundly calm and most beautiful evening towards the end of the last century, a ship lay becalmed on the fair bosom of the Pacific Ocean.  Although there was nothing piratical in the aspect of the ship--if we except her guns--a few of the men who formed her crew might have been easily mistaken for roving buccaneers.  There was a certain swagger in the gait of some, and a sulky defiance on the brow of others, which told powerfully of discontent from some cause or other, and suggested the idea that the peaceful aspect of the sleeping sea was by no means reflected in the breasts of the men.  They were all British seamen, but displayed at that time none of the well-known hearty off-hand rollicking characteristics of the Jack-tar.  It is natural for man to rejoice in sunshine.  His sympathy with cats in this respect is profound and universal.  Not less deep and wide is his discord with the moles and bats.  Nevertheless, there was scarcely a man on board of that ship on the evening in question who vouchsafed even a passing glance at a sunset which was marked by unwonted splendour.  The vessel slowly rose and sank on a scarce perceptible ocean-swell in the centre of a great circular field of liquid glass, on whose undulations the sun gleamed in dazzling flashes, and in whose depths were reflected the fantastic forms, snowy lights, and pearly shadows of cloudland.  In ordinary circumstances such an evening might have raised the thoughts of ordinary men to their Creator, but the circumstances of the men on board of that vessel were not ordinary--very much the reverse.  \"No, Bill McCoy,\" muttered one of the sailors, who sat on the breach of a gun near the forecastle, \"I've bin flogged twice for merely growlin', which is an Englishman's birthright, an' I won't stand it no longer.  A pretty pass things has come to when a man mayn't growl without tastin' the cat; but if Captain Bligh won't let me growl, I'll treat him to a roar that'll make him cock his ears an' wink six times without speakin'.\"  The sailor who said this, Matthew Quintal by name, was a short, thick-set young man of twenty-one or thereabouts, with a forbidding aspect and a savage expression of face, which was intensified at the moment by thoughts of recent wrongs.  Bill McCoy, to whom he said it, was much the same in size and appearance, but a few years older, and with a cynical expression of countenance.  \"Whether you growl or roar, Matt,\" said McCoy, with a low-toned laugh, \"I'd advise you to do it in the minor key, else the Captain will give you another taste of the cat.  He's awful savage just now.  You should have heard him abusin' the officers this afternoon about his cocoa-nuts.\"  \"So I should,\" returned Quintal.  \"As ill luck would have it, I was below at the time.  They say he was pretty hard on Mr Christian.\"  \"Hard on him!  I should think he was,\" rejoined McCoy.  \"Why, if Mr Christian had been one of the worst men in the ship instead of the best officer, the Cap'n could not have abused him worse.  I heard and saw 'im with my own ears and eyes.  The cocoa-nuts was lyin', as it might be here, between the guns, and the Cap'n he came on deck an' said he missed some of his nuts.  He went into a towerin' rage right off--in the old style--and sent for all the officers.  When they came aft he says to them, says he, `Who stole my cocoa-nuts?'  Of course they all said they didn't know, and hadn't seen any of the people take 'em.  `Then,' says the Cap'n, fiercer than ever, `you must have stole 'em yourselves, for they couldn't have been taken away without your knowledge.'  So he questioned each officer separately.  Mr Christian, when he came to him, answered, `I don't know, sir, who took the nuts, but I hope you do not think me so mean as to be guilty of stealing yours.'  Whereupon the Cap'n he flared up like gunpowder.  `Yes, you hungry hound, I do,' says he; `you must have stolen them from me, or you would have been able to give a better account of them.'\"  \"That was pitchin' into 'im pretty stiff,\" said Quintal, with a grim smile.  \"What said Mr Christian?\"  \"He said nothin', but he looked thunder.  I saw him git as red as a turkey cock, an' bite his lips till the blood came.  It's my opinion, messmate,\" added McCoy, in a lower tone, \"that if Cap'n Bligh don't change his tone there'll be--\"  \"Come, come, mate,\" interrupted a voice behind him; \"if you talk mutiny like that you'll swing at the end o' the yard-arm some fine mornin'.\"  The sailor who joined the others and thus spoke was a short, sturdy specimen of his class, and much more like a hearty hare-brained tar than his two comrades.  He was about twenty-two years of age, deeply pitted with small-pox, and with a jovial carelessness of manner that had won for him the sobriquet of Reckless Jack.  \"I'm not the only one that talks mutiny in this ship,\" growled McCoy. \"There's a lot of us whose backs have bin made to smart, and whose grog has been stopped for nothin' but spite, John Adams, and you know it.\"  \"Yes, I do know it,\" returned Adams, sharply; \"and I also know that there's justice to be had in England.  We've got a good case against the Captain, so we'd better wait till we get home rather than take the law into our own hands.\"  \"I don't agree with you, Jack,\" said Quintal, with much decision, \"and I wonder to see you, of all men, show the white feather.\"  Adams turned away with a light laugh of contempt, and the other two joined a group of their mates, who were talking in low tones near the windlass.  Matthew Quintal was not the only man on board who did not agree with the more moderate counsels of Reckless Jack, _alias_ John Adams, _alias_ John Smith, for by each of those names was he known.  On the quarter-deck as well as on the forecastle mutterings of deep indignation were heard.  The vessel was the celebrated _Bounty_, which had been fitted up for the express purpose of proceeding to the island of Otaheite, (now named Tahiti), in the Pacific for plants of the breadfruit tree, it being thought desirable to introduce that tree into the West India Islands. We may remark in passing, that the transplantation was afterwards accomplished, though it failed at this time.  The _Bounty_ had been placed under the command of Lieutenant Bligh of the Royal Navy.  Her burden was about 215 tons.  She had been fitted with every appliance and convenience for her special mission, and had sailed from Spithead on the 23rd December 1787.  Lieutenant Bligh, although an able and energetic seaman, was of an angry tyrannical disposition.  On the voyage out, and afterwards at Otaheite, he had behaved so shamefully, and with such unjustifiable severity, both to officers and men, that he was regarded by a large proportion of them with bitter hatred.  It is painful to be obliged to write thus of one who rose to positions of honour in the service; but the evidence led in open court, coupled with Bligh's own writings, and testimony from other quarters, proves beyond a doubt that his conduct on board the _Bounty_ was not only dishonourable but absolutely brutal.  When the islanders were asked at first the name of the island, they replied, \"O-Tahiti,\" which means, \"It is Tahiti\", hence the earlier form of the name--_Otaheite_.  It was after the _Bounty_ had taken in the breadfruit trees at Otaheite, and was advanced a short distance on the homeward voyage, that the events we are about to narrate occurred.  We have said that mutterings of deep discontent were heard on the quarter-deck.  Fletcher Christian, acting lieutenant, or master's mate, leaned over the bulwarks on that lovely evening, and with compressed lips and frowning brows gazed down into the sea.  The gorgeous clouds and their grand reflections had no beauty for him, but a shark, which swam lazily alongside, showing a fin now and then above water, seemed to afford him a species of savage satisfaction.  \"Yes,\" he muttered, \"if one of his legs were once within your ugly jaws, we'd have something like peace again after these months of torment.\"  Fletcher Christian, although what is called a high-spirited youth, was not quick to resent injury or insult.  On the contrary, he had borne with much forbearance the oft-repeated and coarse insolence of his superior.  His natural expression was bright and his temperament sunny. He possessed a powerful frame and commanding stature, was agile and athletic, and a favourite with officers and men.  But Bligh's conduct had soured him.  His countenance was now changed.  The last insult about the cocoa-nuts, delivered openly, was more than he could bear.  \"When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war.\"  In this case the tug was tremendous, the immediate results were disastrous, and the ultimate issues amazing, as will be seen in the sequel of our tale.  \"To whom does your amiable wish refer?\" asked a brother-officer named Stewart, who came up just then and leaned over the bulwarks beside him.  \"Can you not guess?\" said the other, sternly.  \"Yes, I can guess,\" returned the midshipman, gazing contemplatively at the shark's fin.  \"But, I say, surely you don't really mean to carry out your mad intention of deserting.\"  \"Yes, I do,\" said Christian with emphasis.  \"I've been to the fore-cockpit several times to-day, and seen the boatswain and carpenter, both of whom have agreed to help me.  I've had a plank rigged up with staves into a sort of raft, on which I mean to take my chance.  There's a bag all ready with some victuals in it, and another with a few nails, beads, etcetera, to propitiate the natives.  Young Hayward is the only other officer besides yourself to whom I have revealed my intention. Like you, he attempts to dissuade me, but in vain.  I shall go to-night.\"  \"But where will you go to?\" asked Stewart.  Christian pointed to Tofoa, one of the Friendly Islands, which was then in"]]]
