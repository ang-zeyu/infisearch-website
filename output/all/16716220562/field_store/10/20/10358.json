If I fail to escape, you see, there will be no chance of taking me alive.\"  \"_Better try to take the ship_!\" whispered a voice behind him.  Christian started and grew paler, but did not turn his head to see who had spoken.  The midshipman at his side had evidently not heard the whisper.  \"I cannot help thinking you are wrong,\" said Stewart.  \"We have only to bear it a little longer, and then we shall have justice done to us in England.\"  Well would it have been for Fletcher Christian, and well for all on board the _Bounty_, if he had taken the advice of his young friend, but his spirit had been tried beyond its powers of endurance--at least so he thought--and his mind was made up.  What moral suasion failed to effect, however, the weather accomplished.  It prevented his first intention from being carried out.  While the shades of evening fell and deepened into a night of unusual magnificence, the profound calm continued, and the ship lay motionless on the sea.  The people, too, kept moving quietly about the deck, either induced thereto by the sweet influences around them, or by some indefinable impression that a storm sometimes succeeds a calm as well in the moral as the material world.  As the ship had no way through the water, it was impossible for the rash youth to carry out his plan either during the first or middle watches.  He was therefore compelled to give it up, at least for that night, and about half-past three in the morning he lay down to rest a few minutes, as he was to be called by Stewart to relieve the watch at four o'clock.  He had barely fallen into a troubled slumber when he was awakened by Stewart, and rose at once to go on deck.  He observed in passing that young Hayward, the mate of his watch, had lain down to take a nap on the arm-chest.  Mr Hallet, the other midshipman of the watch, had also gone to sleep somewhere, for he was not to be seen.  Whether the seriously reprehensible conduct of these two officers roused his already excited spirit to an ungovernable pitch, or their absence afforded a favourable opportunity, we cannot tell, but certain it is that Fletcher Christian opened his ear at that time to the voice of the tempter.  \"_Better try to take the ship_,\" seemed burning in words of fire into his brain.  Quick to act as well as to conceive, he looked lustily and earnestly at the men of his watch.  The one who stood nearest him, looking vacantly out upon the sea, was Matthew Quintal.  To him Christian revealed his hastily adopted plan of seizing the ship, and asked if he would join him.  Quintal was what men call a deep villain.  He was quite ripe for mutiny, but from some motive known only to himself he held back, and expressed doubt as to the possibility of carrying out the plan.  \"I did not expect to find cowardice in _you_,\" said Christian, with a look of scornful indignation.  \"It is not cowardice, sir,\" retorted Quintal.  \"I will join if others do.  Try some one else.  Try Martin there, for instance.\"  Isaac Martin was a raw-boned, sallow, six-foot man of about thirty, who had been undeservedly flogged by Bligh.  Christian went to him at once, and put the question, \"Will you join me in taking the ship?\"  \"The very thing, Mr Christian.  I'm with you,\" answered Martin, promptly.  The eager readiness of this man at once decided Quintal.  Christian then went to every man in his watch, all of whom had received more or less harsh treatment from the Captain, and most of whom were more than willing to join the conspirators.  Those who hesitated, whatever might have been their motives, had not sufficient regard for their commander to warn him of his danger.  Perhaps the very suddenness of the proposal, as well as fear of the mutineers, induced them to remain silent.  In passing along the deck Christian encountered a man named William Brown. He was assistant-botanist, or gardener, to the expedition, and having been very intimate with Christian, at once agreed to join him.  Although a slenderly made young man, Brown was full of vigour and resolution.  \"We must look sharp,\" said Christian to him, in that low eager whisper in which the conversation among the mutineers had hitherto been carried on.  \"It will soon be daylight.  You know the men as well as I do.  Go below and gain over those whom you feel sure of influencing.  Don't waste your time on the lukewarm or cowardly.  Away with you.  Here, Williams,\" he added, turning to another man who was already in the plot, \"go below and send up the gunner's mate, I want him; then call John Adams,--I feel sure that Reckless Jack will join; but do it softly.  No noise or excitement.\"  In a few seconds John Mills, the gunner's mate, a strongly-built middle-aged man, came on deck, and agreeing at once to join, was sent to fetch the keys of the arm-chest from the armourer, under pretence of getting out a musket to shoot a shark which was alongside.  Meanwhile John Williams went to the hammock of John Adams and roused him.  \"I don't half like it,\" said Adams, when he was sufficiently awake to understand the message of his mate.  \"It's all very true what you say, Williams; the ship _has_ been little better than a hell since we left Spithead, and Captain Bligh don't deserve much mercy, but mutiny is wrong any way you look at it, and I've got my doubts whether any circumstances can make it right.\"  The reasoning of Adams was good, but his doubts were cleared away, if not solved, by the abrupt entrance of Christian, who went to the arm-chest just opposite Adams's hammock and began to distribute arms to all the men who came for them.  Seeing this, and fearing to be left on the weaker side, Adams rose, armed himself with a cutlass, and went on deck.  The morning of the 28th of April was now beginning to dawn.  Before that the greater part of the ship's company had been gained over and armed; yet all this was done so quietly and with such firmness that the remainder of the crew were ignorant of what was going on.  No doubt a few who might have given the alarm were afraid to do so.  Among those who were asleep was one deserving of special notice, namely, Peter Heywood, a midshipman who was true as steel at heart, but whose extreme youth and inexperience, coupled with the surprise and alarm of being awakened to witness scenes of violence, produced a condition of inaction which resulted in his being left, and afterwards classed, with the mutineers.  Shortly after five o'clock the armed men streamed quietly up the fore-hatch and took possession of the deck.  Sentinels were placed below at the doors of the officers' berths, and above at the hatchways.  Then Fletcher Christian, John Adams, Matthew Quintal, William McCoy, Isaac Martin, and several others went aft, armed with muskets, bayonets, and cutlasses.  Leaving Martin in charge of the quarter-deck, they descended to Captain Bligh's cabin.  The commander of the _Bounty_, all ignorant of the coming storm which his ungentlemanly and cruel conduct had raised, was sleeping calmly in his berth.  He was roughly awakened and bidden to rise.  \"What is the reason of such violence?\" he demanded, addressing Christian, as they half forced him out of bed.  \"Silence, sir,\" said Christian, sternly; \"you know the reason well enough.  Tie his hands, lads.\"  Disregarding the order to be silent, Bligh shouted \"murder!\" at the top of his voice.  \"Hold your tongue, sir, else you're a dead man,\" said Christian, seizing him by the tied hands with a powerful grasp, and holding a bayonet to his breast.  Of course no one responded to the Captain's cry, the hatchways, etcetera, being guarded.  They gave him no time to dress, but hurried him on deck, where, amid much confusion and many abusive cries, preparations were being made for getting out a boat, for it was resolved to set Bligh and his friends adrift.  At first there was some disputing among the mutineers as to which boat should be given to them. Eventually the launch was decided on.  \"Hoist her out, bo's'n.  Do it smartly and instantly, or look-out for yourself.\"  The order was given sternly, for the boatswain was known to be friendly to Bligh.  He obeyed at once, with the assistance of willing men who were only too glad to get rid of their tyrannical commander.  \"Now, Mr Hayward and Mr Hallet, get into the boat,\" said Christian, who seemed to be torn with conflicting emotions.  His tone and look were sufficient for those young midshipmen.  They obeyed promptly.  Mr Samuel the clerk and several more of the crew were then ordered into the boat.  At this point Captain Bligh attempted to interfere.  He demanded the intentions of the mutineers, but was told to hold his tongue, with threats of instant death if he did not obey.  Particular persons were then called on to go into the boat, and some of these were allowed to collect twine, canvas, lines, sails, cordage, and other things to take with them.  They were also allowed an eight-and-twenty gallon cask of water, fifty pounds of bread, a small quantity of rum and wine, a quadrant, and a compass.  When all the men obnoxious to the mutineers were in the boat, Captain Bligh was ordered into it.  Isaac Martin had been placed as a guard over the Captain, and appeared to favour him, as he enabled him to moisten his parched lips with a shaddock.  For this he was removed, and Adams took his place.  Bligh looked round, but no friendly eye"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21747"],["title","The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers (#2)"],["body","his.  He had forfeited the regard of all on board, though there were undoubtedly men there whose detestation of mutiny and whose sense of honour would have inclined them to aid him if they had not been overawed by the numbers and resolution of the mutineers.  The master, indeed, had already made an attempt to rally some of the men round him, but had failed, and been sent to his cabin.  He, with the others, was now in the boat.  Poor young Peter Heywood the middy looked on bewildered as if in a dream.  He could not be said in any sense, either by look or act, to have taken part with the mutineers.  At last he went below for some things, intending to go in the boat, but was ordered to remain below.  So also, it is thought, was Edward Young, another midshipman, who did not make his appearance on deck at all during the progress of the mutiny.  It was afterwards said that the leading seamen among the mutineers had purposely ordered these officers below, and detained them with a view to their working the ship in the event of anything happening to Christian.  Bligh now made a last appeal.  \"I'll give you my honour, Mr Christian,\" he said, \"never to think of what has passed this day if you will desist.  To cast us adrift here in an open boat is to consign us to destruction.  Think of my wife and family!\"  \"No, Captain Bligh,\" replied Christian, sternly; \"if you had any honour things had not come to this; and if you had any regard for your wife and family, you should have thought of them before and not behaved so much like a villain.  It is too late.  You have treated me like a dog all the voyage.  Come, sir, your officers and men are now in the boat, and you must go with them.  If you attempt resistance you shall be put to death.\"  Seeing that further appeal would be useless, Bligh allowed himself to be forced over the side.  When in the boat his hands were untied.  \"You will at least allow us arms, to defend ourselves from the savages,\" he said.  Fire-arms were refused, but four cutlasses were ultimately allowed him.  At this point Isaac Martin quietly descended into the boat, but Quintal, pointing a musket at him, threatened to shoot him if he did not return to the ship.  He obeyed the order with reluctance, and soon after the boat was cast adrift.  The crew of the _Bounty_ at the time consisted of forty-four souls, all told.  Eighteen of these went adrift with the Captain.  The remaining twenty-five steered back to the sunny isles of the Pacific.    CHAPTER TWO.  RECORDS THE DUTIES AND TROUBLES OF THE MUTINEERS.  It is not our purpose to follow the fortunes of Captain Bligh.  The mutineers in the _Bounty_ claim our undivided attention.  As regards Bligh, it is sufficient to say that he performed one of the most remarkable boat-voyages on record.  In an overloaded and open boat, on the shortest allowance of provision compatible with existence, through calm and tempest, heat and cold, exposed to the attacks of cannibals and to the reproaches of worn-out and mutinous men, he traversed 3618 miles of ocean in forty-one days, and brought himself and his followers to land, with the exception of one man who was killed by the natives.  In this achievement he displayed those qualities of indomitable resolution and unflagging courage which ultimately raised him to high rank in the navy.  But we leave him now to trace those incidents which result from the display of his other qualities-- ungovernable passion, overbearing impetuosity, and incomprehensible meanness.  The first act of Fletcher Christian, after taking command of the ship, was to serve out a glass of grog all round.  He then called a council of war, in which the mutineers discussed the question what they should do.  \"You see, lads,\" said Christian, \"it is absolutely certain that we shan't be left among these islands in peace.  Whether Bligh manages to get home or not, the British Government is sure to send out to see what has become of us.  My notion is that we should bear away to the south'ard, far out of the usual track of ships, find out some uninhabited and suitable island, and establish ourselves thereon?\"  \"What! without wives, or sisters, or mothers, or grandmothers, to say nothin' o' mothers-in-law, to cook our victuals an' look after our shirt-buttons?\" said Isaac Martin, who, having been detained against his will, had become lugubriously, or recklessly, facetious, and was stimulated to a sort of fierce hilarity by his glass of rum.  \"You're right, Martin,\" said Brown, the assistant botanist, \"we couldn't get along without wives, so I vote that we go back to Otaheite, get married, every man of us, an' ho! for the South Pole.  The British cruisers would never find us there.\"  There was a general laugh at this sally, but gravity returned almost instantly to every face, for they were in no humour just then for jesting.  It is probable that each man began to realise the dreadful nature of his position as an outlaw whose life was forfeited to his country, and who could never more hope to tread the shores of Old England, or look upon the faces of kindred or friends.  In such circumstances men sometimes try to hide their true feelings under a veil of recklessness or forced mirth, but seldom succeed in the attempt.  \"No man in his senses would go back to Otaheite--at least not to stay there,\" said John Adams, gravely; \"it's the first place they will send to look for us.\"  \"What's the odds?\" growled one of the seamen.  \"They won't look there for us for a long time to come, unless Cap'n Bligh borrows a pair of wings from an albatross, an' goes home as the crow flies.\"  At this point John Mills, the gunner's mate, a man of about forty, cleared his throat and gave it as his opinion that they should not go back to Otaheite, but should leave the matter of their future destination in the hands of Mr Christian, who was well able to guide them.  This proposal was heartily backed by Edward Young, midshipman, a stout young fellow of twenty-two, who was fond of Christian; but there were one or two dissentient voices, among which were the little middy Peter Heywood, his brother-officer George Stewart, and James Morrison the boatswain's mate.  These wished to return to Otaheite, but the counsel of the majority prevailed, and Christian ultimately steered for the island of Toubouai, which lay some five hundred miles to the south of Otaheite.  There he expected to be safe from pursuit, and there it was resolved that the mutineers should take up their abode if the natives proved friendly.  That night, while the _Bounty_ was skimming gently over the starlit sea before a light breeze, the three officers, Heywood, Stewart, and Young, leaned over the weather side of the quarter-deck, and held a whispered conversation.  \"Why did you vote for going back to Otaheite, Heywood?\" asked Young.  \"Because it is to Otaheite that they will send to look after us, and I should like to be there to give myself up, the instant a man-of-war arrives, and declare my innocence of the crime of mutiny.\"  \"You are right, Heywood,\" said Stewart; \"I, too, would like to give myself up the moment I get the chance.  Captain Bligh knows that you and I had no hand in the mutiny, and if he reaches England will clear us of so foul a stain.  It's a pity that those who voted for Otaheite were not in the majority.\"  \"That's all very well for you, who were seen to go below to fetch your clothes, and were detained against your will,\" said Young, \"but it was not so with me.  I was forcibly detained below.  They would not allow me to go on deck at all until the launch had left, so that it would go hard with me before a court-martial.  But the die is now cast, and there's no help for it.  Although I took no part in the mutiny, I won't risk falling into the hands of justice, with such an unprincipled scoundrel as Bligh to witness against me.  My future fortunes now lie with Fletcher Christian.  I cannot avoid my fate.\"  Young spoke sadly, yet with some bitterness of tone, like one who has made up his mind to face and endure the worst.  On reaching the remote island of Toubouai the mutineers were much impressed with its beauty.  It seemed exceedingly fertile, was wooded to the water's edge, and surrounded by a coral reef, with one opening through which a ship might enter.  Altogether it seemed a most suitable refuge, but here they met with an insurmountable difficulty.  On drawing near to the shore they saw hundreds of natives, who, armed with clubs and spears, lined the beach, blew their shell-horns, and resolutely opposed the landing of the strangers.  As all efforts to conciliate them were fruitless, resort was had to cannon and musketry.  Of course the terrible thunder of the white man's artillery had its usual effect on the savages.  They fled inland, and the mutineers gained a footing on the island.  But the natives continued their opposition so vigorously, that this refuge proved to be the reverse of a place of rest.  Christian therefore changed his plan, and, re-embarking in the _Bounty_, set sail for Otaheite.  On the way thither the mutineers disagreed among themselves.  Some of those who had been forcibly detained even began to plot the retaking of the ship, but their intentions were discovered and prevented.  On the 6th of June they reached their former anchorage in Otaheite, where the natives received them with much joy and some surprise, but a story was trumped up to account for this sudden re-appearance of the mutineers.  Christian, however, had not yet given up his intention of settling on the island of Toubouai.  He foresaw the doom that awaited him if he should remain at Otaheite, and resolved to return to the former island with a quantity of livestock.  He began to barter with the friendly Otaheitans, and soon had as many hogs, goats, fowls, cats, and dogs as he required, besides a bull and a cow which had been left there by Captain Cook.  With these and several natives he sailed again for Toubouai."]]]
