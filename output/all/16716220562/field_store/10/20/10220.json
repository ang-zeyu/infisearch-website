In course I can't say whether there's a popilation, as you calls it, of over twelve thousand, always afloat, never havin' counted 'em myself, but I know there must be a-many thousand men an' boys there.\"  \"Billy was right.  There is really a population of over 12,000 men and boys afloat all the year round on the North Sea, engaged in the arduous work of daily supplying the London and other markets with fresh fish.\"  \"And what port do they run for when a storm comes on?\" asked Ruth.  \"What port, Miss? why, they don't run for no port at all, cos why? there's no port near enough to run for.\"  \"Do you mean to say, that they remain at sea during all the storms--even the worst?\"  \"That's just what we does, Miss.  Blow high, blow low, it's all the same; we must weather it the best way we can.  An' you should see how it blows in winter!  That's the time we catches it wust.  It's so cold too! I've not bin out in winter yet myself, but father says it's cold enough to freeze the nose off your face, an' it blows 'ard enough a'most to blow you inside out.  You wouldn't like to face that sort o' thing-- would you, Miss?\"  With a light laugh Ruth admitted that she disliked the idea of such North Sea experiences.  \"Oh! you've no idea, Miss, how it do blow sometimes,\" continued Billy, who was a naturally communicative boy, and felt that he had got hold of a sympathetic ear.  \"Have you ever heard of the gale that blew so 'ard that they had to station two men an' a boy to hold on to the captain's hair for fear it should be blowed right off his 'ead?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Ruth, with a silvery laugh.  \"I've heard of that gale.\"  \"Have you, Miss?\" said Billy with a slightly surprised look.  \"That's queer, now.  I thought nobody know'd o' that gale 'cept us o' the North Sea, an', p'raps, some o' the people o' Yarmouth an' Gorleston.\"  \"I rather think that I must have read of it somewhere,\" said Ruth. Billy glanced reproachfully at the surrounding books, under the impression that it must have been one of these which had taken the wind out of his sails.  \"Well, Miss,\" he continued, \"I don't mean for to say I ever was in a gale that obliged us to be careful of the skipper's hair, but I do say that father's seed somethink like it, for many a time our smack has bin blowed over on her beam-ends--that means laid a'most flat, Miss, with 'er sails on the sea.  One night father's smack was sailin' along close-hauled when a heavy sea struck 'er abaft the channels, and filled the bag o' the mains'l.  She was just risin' to clear herself when another sea follared, filled the mains'l again, an' sent 'er on 'er beam-ends.  The sea was makin' a clean breach over 'er from stem to stern, an' cleared the deck o' the boat an' gear an' everythink.  Down went all hands below an' shut the companion, to prevent 'er being swamped.  Meanwhile the weight o' water bu'st the mains'l, so that the vessel partly righted, an' let the hands come on deck agin.  Then, after the gale had eased a bit, two or three o' their comrades bore down on 'em and towed 'em round, so as the wind got under 'er an' lifted 'er a bit, but the ballast had bin shot from the bilge into the side, so they couldn't right her altogether, but had to tow 'er into port that way-- over two hundred miles--the snow an' hail blowin', too, like one o'clock!\"  \"Really, they must have had a terrible time of it,\" returned Ruth, \"though I don't know exactly how dreadful `one o'clock' may be.  But tell me, Billy, do the fishermen like the worsted mitts and helmets and comforters that were sent to them from this house last year?\"  \"Oh! don't they, just!  I've heard them blessin' the ladies as sent 'em, many a time.  You see, Miss, the oil-skins chafe our wrists most awful when we're workin' of the gear--\"  \"What is the gear, Billy?\"  \"The nets, Miss, an' all the tackle as belongs to 'em.  An' then the salt water makes the sores wuss--it used to be quite awful, but the cuffs keeps us all right.  An' the books an' tracts, too, Miss--the hands are wery fond o' them, an'--\"  \"We will talk about the books and tracts another time,\" said Ruth, interrupting, \"but just now we must proceed to business.  Of course you understand that I must have some object in view in sending for a fisher-boy from Yarmouth.\"  \"Well, Miss, it did occur to me that I wasn't axed to come here for nuffin'.\"  \"Just so, my boy.  Now I want your help, so I will explain.  We are to have what is called a drawing-room meeting here in a few days, in behalf of the Mission to Deep-Sea Fishermen, and one of your fisher captains is to be present to give an account of the work carried on among the men of the fleet by the mission vessels.  So I want you to be there as one of the boys--\"  \"Not to speak to 'em, Miss, I hope?\" said Billy, with a look of affected modesty.  \"No, not to speak,\" replied Ruth, laughing, \"only to represent the boys of the fleet.  But that's not the main thing I want you for.  It is this, and remember, Billy, that I am now taking you into my confidence, so you must not tell what I shall speak to you about to any living soul.\"  \"Not even to mother?\" asked the boy.  \"No, not even--well, you _may_ tell it to your mother, for boys ought to have no secrets from their mothers; besides, _your_ mother is a discreet woman, and lives a long way off from London.  You must know, then, Billy, that I have two very dear friends--two ladies--who are in deep poverty, and I want to give them money--\"  \"Well, why don't you give it 'em, Miss?\" said Billy, seeing that Ruth hesitated.  \"You must have lots of it to give away,\" he added, looking contemplatively round.  \"Yes, thank God, who gave it to me, I have, as you say, lots of it, but I cannot give it to the dear ladies I speak of because--because--\"  \"They're too proud to take it, p'raps,\" suggested Billy.  \"No; they are not proud--very far from it; but they are sensitive.\"  \"What's that, Miss?\"  Ruth was puzzled for a reply.  \"It--it means,\" she said, \"that they have delicate feelings, which cannot bear the idea of accepting money without working for it, when there are so many millions of poor people without money who _cannot_ work for it.  They once said to me, indeed, that if they were to accept money in charity they would feel as if they were robbing the really poor.\"  \"Why don't they work, then?\" asked Billy in some surprise.  \"Why don't they go to sea as stooardesses or somethink o' that sort?\"  \"Because they have never been trained to such work, or, indeed, to any particular work,\" returned Ruth; \"moreover, they are in rather delicate health, and are not young.  Their father was rich, and meant to leave them plenty to live on, but he failed, and left them in broken health without a penny.  Wasn't it sad?\"  \"Indeed it was, Miss,\" replied the boy, whose ready sympathy was easily enlisted.  \"Well, now, Billy, I want you to go to see these ladies.  Tell them that you are a fisher-boy belonging to the North sea trawling fleet, and that you have called from a house which wants a job undertaken.  You will then explain about the fishery, and how the wrists of the men are chafed, and break out into painful sores, and how worsted mitts serve the purpose at once of prevention and cure.  Say that the house by which you have been sent has many hands at work--and so I have, Billy, for many ladies send the cuffs and things made by them for the fleet to _me_ to be forwarded, only they work gratuitously, and I want the work done by my two friends to be paid for, you understand?  Tell them that still more hands are wanted, and ask them if they are open to an engagement. You must be very matter-of-fact, grave, and businesslike, you know.  Ask them how many pairs they think they will be able to make in a week, and say that the price to be paid will be fixed on receipt of the first sample.  But, remember, on no account are you to mention the name of the house that sent you; you will also leave with them this bag of worsted. Now, do you fully understand?\"  Billy replied by a decided wink, coupled with an intelligent nod.  After a good deal of further advice and explanation, Ruth gave Billy the name and address of her friends, and sent him forth on his mission.    CHAPTER FIVE.  HOW BILLY CONDUCTS THE BUSINESS--HOW CAPTAIN BREAM OVERCOMES THE SISTERS, AND HOW JESSIE SEAWARD SEES MYSTERY IN EVERYTHING.  \"I wonder,\" said Billy to himself on reaching the street as he looked down at the legs of his trousers, \"I wonder if they're any shorter. Yes, they don't seem to be quite so far down on the shoes as when I left Yarmouth.  I _must_ have grow'd an inch or two since I came up to Lun'on!\"  Under this gratifying impression the fisher-boy drew himself up to his full height, his little chest swelling with new sensations, and his whole body rolling along with a nautical swagger that drew on him the admiration of some, the contempt of others, and caused several street boys to ask \"if his mother knowed 'e was hout,\" and other insolent questions.  But Billy cared for none of these things.  The provincial boy was quite equal to the occasion, though his return \"chaff\" smacked much of salt water.  Arrived at the poverty-stricken street in which the Misses Seaward dwelt, Billy mounted the narrow staircase and knocked at the door.  It was opened by Liffie Lee, who had remained on that day to accomplish some extra work.  \"Is your missis at home, my dear?\"  \"There ain't no missis here, an' I ain't _your_ dear,\" was the prompt reply.  Billy was taken aback.  He had not anticipated so ready and caustic a response, in one so small and child-like.  \"Come now--no offence meant,\" he said, \"but you're not a-goin' to deny that the Miss Seawards does live here.\"  \"I ain't a-goin' to deny nothink,\" replied Liffie, a little softened by the boy's apologetic tone, \"only when I'm expected to give a civil answer, I expects a civil question.\"  \"That's all fair an'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21713"],["title","The Young Trawler (#8)"],["body","boveboard.  Now, will you tell the Miss Seawards I wants to see 'em, on a matter of business--of importance.\"  Another minute and Billy stood in the presence of the ladies he wished to see.  Prepared beforehand to like them, his affections were at once fixed for ever by the first glimpse of their kindly faces.  With a matter-of-fact gravity, that greatly amused the sisters--though they carefully concealed their feelings--little Billy stated his business, and, in so doing, threw his auditors into a flutter of hope and gratitude, surprise and perplexity.  \"But what is the name of the house that sends you?\" asked Miss Jessie.  \"That I am not allowed for to tell,\" said the boy-of-business, firmly.  \"A mercantile house in the city, I suppose,\" said Kate.  \"What sort o' house it may be is more than a sea-farin' man like me knows, an' of course it's in the city.  You wouldn't expect a business-house to be in the country, would you? all I know is that they want mitts made--hundreds of 'em--no end o' mitts--an' they hain't got hands enough to make 'em, so they sent me to ask if you'll undertake to help in the work, or if they're to git some one else to do it.  Now, will you, or will you not? that's the pint.\"  \"Of course we shall be only too happy,\" answered Jessie, \"though the application is strange.  How did you come to know that we were in want of--that is, who sent you to us?\"  \"The house sent me, as I said afore, Miss.\"  \"Yes, but how did the house come to know of our existence, and how is it that a house of any sort should send a sailor-boy as its messenger?\"  \"How the house came to know of you is more than I can say.  They don't tell me all the outs-an'-ins of their affairs, you know.  As to a house sendin' a sailor-boy as its messenger--did you ever hear of the great house of Messrs. Hewett and Company, what supplies Billin'sgate with fish?\"  \"I'm not sure--well, yes, I think I have heard of that house,\" said Kate, \"though we are not in the way of hearing much about the commercial houses of London.\"  \"Well,\" continued Billy, \"that house sends hundreds of fisher-boys as messengers.  It sends 'em to the deep-sea with a message to the fish, an the message is--`come out o' the water you skulkin' critters, an' be sent up to Billin'sgate to be sold an' eaten!'  The fish don't come willin'ly, I'm bound for to say that, but we make 'em come all the same, willin' or not, for we've wonderful powers o' persuasion.  So you see, houses _do_ send fisher-boys as messengers sometimes; now, what am I to say to the partikler house as sends _me_? will you go in for mitts? you may take comforters if you prefer it, or helmets.\"  \"What do you mean by helmets, my boy?\"  \"Worsted ones, of course.  Things made to kiver up a man's head and neck and come down to his shoulders, with a hole in front just big enough to let his eyes, nose, and cheek-bones come through.  With a sou'-wester on top, and a comforter round the neck, they're not so bad in a stiff nor'-wester in Janoowairy.  Now's your chance, ladies, now, or niver!\"  There was something so ludicrous in the manly tone and decided manner of the smooth-faced little creature before them, that the sisters burst into a hearty fit of laughter.  \"Forgive us, dear boy, but the idea of our being asked in this sudden way to make innumerable mitts and comforters and worsted helmets seems so odd that we can't help laughing.  What is your name?  That is not a secret, I hope?\"  \"By no means.  My name is Billy Bright.  If you're very partikler, you may call me Willum.\"  \"I prefer Billy,\" said Kate.  \"Now, Billy, it is near our dinner hour. Will you stay and dine with us?  If you do, you'll meet such a nice man--such a big man too--and somewhat in your own line of life; a sea-captain.  We expect him every--\"  \"No, thank 'ee, Miss,\" interrupted the boy, rising abruptly.  \"I sees more than enough o' big sea-captings when I'm afloat.  Besides, I've got more business on hand, so I'll bid 'ee good-day.\"  Pulling his forelock he left the room.  \"The ladies has undertook some work for me, my dear,\" said Billy to Liffie Lee, as he stood at the door buttoning up his little coat, \"so p'raps I may see you again.\"  \"It won't break my 'art if you don't,\" replied Liffie; \"no, nor yet yours.\"  \"Speak for yourself, young 'ooman.  You don't know nothing about _my_ 'art.\"  As he spoke, a heavy foot was heard at the bottom of the stair.  \"That's our lodger,\" said Liffie; \"no foot but his can bang the stair or make it creak like that.\"  \"Well, I'm off,\" cried Billy, descending two steps at a time.  Half-way down he encountered what seemed to him a giant with a chest on his shoulder.  It was the darkest part of the stair where they met.  \"Look out ahead!  Hard a starboard!\" growled Captain Bream, who seemed to be heavily weighted.  \"Ay, ay, sir!\" cried Billy, as he brushed past, bounded into the street, and swaggered away.  \"What boy was that, Liffie?\" asked the captain, letting down the chest he carried with a shock that caused the frail tenement to quiver from cellar to roof-tree.  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"He must be a sailor-boy, from his answer,\" rejoined the captain.  \"Open the door o' my cabin, lass, and I'll carry it right in.  It's somewhat heavy.\"  He lifted the chest, which was within an eighth of an inch of being too large to pass through the little door-way, and put it in a corner, after which he entered the parlour, and sat down in a solid wooden chair which he had supplied to the establishment for his own special use.  \"You see,\" he had said, on the day when he introduced it, \"I've come to grief so often in the matter of chairs that I've become chary as to how I use 'em.  If all the chairs that I've had go crash under me was put together they'd furnish a good-sized house.  Look before you leap is a well-known proverb, but, look before you sit down, has become a more familiar experience to me through life.  It's an awkward thing bein' so heavy, and I hope you'll never know what it is, ladies.\"  Judging from their appearance just then there did not seem much prospect of that!  \"Now,\" continued the captain, rubbing his hands and looking benignantly at Jessie, \"I have settled the matter at last; fairly said good-bye to old Ocean, an' fixed to cast anchor for good on the land.\"  \"Have you indeed, captain?\" said Jessie, \"I should fancy that you must feel rather sorry to bid farewell to so old a friend.\"  \"That's true, Miss Seaward.  An old and good friend the sea has been to me, thank God.  But I'm gettin' too old myself to be much of a friend to _it_, so I've fixed to say good-bye.  And the question is, Am I to stop on here, or am I to look out for another lodgin'?  You see I've been a good many weeks with you now, an' you've had a fair taste of me, so to speak.  I know I'm a rough sort o' fish for the like o' you to have to do with, and, like some o' the hermit crabs, rather too big for my shell, so if you find me awkward or uncomfortable don't hesitate to say so.  I won't be surprised, though I confess I should be sorry to leave you.\"  \"Well, Captain Bream,\" said Kate, who was generally the speaker when delicate, difficult or unpleasant subjects had to be dealt with, \"since you have been so candid with us we will be equally candid with you. When you first came to us, I confess that we were much alarmed; you seemed--so very big,\" (the captain tried to shrink a little--without success--and smiled in a deprecating manner), \"and our rooms and furniture seemed so very small and delicate, so to speak; and then your voice was so fearfully deep and gruff,\" (the captain cleared his throat softly--in B natural of the bass clef--and smiled again), \"that we were almost frightened to receive you; but, now that we have had experience of you, we are quite willing that you should continue with us--on one condition, however.\"  \"And that is?\" asked the captain anxiously.  \"That you pay us a lower rent.\"  \"A--a higher rent you mean, I suppose?\"  \"No; I mean a lower.\"  Captain Bream's benign visage became grave and elongated.  \"You see, captain,\" continued Kate, flushing a little, \"when you first came, we tried--excuse me--to get rid of you, to shake you off, and we almost doubled the rent of our little room, hoping that--\"  \"Quite right, quite right,\" interrupted the captain, \"and according to strict justice, for ain't I almost double the size of or'nary men, an' don't I give more than double the trouble?\"  \"Not so,\" returned Kate, firmly, \"you don't give half the trouble that other men do.\"  \"Excuse me, Miss Kate,\" said the captain with a twinkle in his grey eye, \"you told me I was your first lodger, so how can you know how much trouble other men would give?\"  \"No matter,\" persisted Kate, a little confused, \"you don't give _half_ the trouble that other lodgers would have given if we had had them.\"  \"Ah! h'm--well,\" returned the captain softly, in the profoundest possible bass, \"looking at the matter in that light, perhaps you are not far wrong.  But, go on.\"  \"Well, I have only to add,\" continued Kate, \"that you have been so kind to us, and so considerate, and have given us so little--so _very_ little trouble, that it will give us both great pleasure to have you continue to lodge with us, if you agree to the reduction of the rent.\"  \"Very well,\" said Captain Bream, pulling out an immense gold chronometer--the gift, in days gone by, of a band of highly grateful and appreciative passengers.  \"I've got business in the city an hour hence. We shall have dinner first.  Two hours afterwards I will return with a cab and take away my boxes.  That will give you plenty of time to make out your little bill and--\"  \"What _do_ you mean, captain?\" interrupted Kate, in much surprise.  \"I mean, dear ladies, that you and I entered into an agreement to rent your little cabin for so much.  Now it has been my rule in life to stick to agreements, and I mean to stick to this one or throw up my situation. Besides, I'm not goin' to submit to have"]]]
