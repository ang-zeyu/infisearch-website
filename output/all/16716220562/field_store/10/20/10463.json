Their departure was not discovered until morning had been well advanced, and Muro's runner did not reach Blakely until the train from the Cataract came in sight.  This was most discouraging news, as it meant danger to those left with the Professor.  \"There is but one alternative now,\" said John. \"We must make a forced march to the relief of the Professor. Uraso has the matter of controlling the force well in hand, and Blakely, you and I will take all the men excepting the one hundred in charge of the material, and go forward rapidly.\"  The first news the Professor had of the new situation was gleaned from the messenger which Muro had dispatched the moment the escape of the allies was discovered.  \"Has the Professor been notified?\" asked Blakely.  \"I sent two messengers early this morning,\" was Muro's response.  \"That was a wise thing,\" remarked John. \"You are to be commended for the step. We must make a forced march at once, and you must lead the advance with your best men.\"  Muro was much gratified at this position of trust, and called up the warriors selected and spoke a few words to them. Without waiting to make any other preparations than to provide a day's provisions, his party sallied forth, and headed straight for the southwest.  The following day, the scouts sent out by the Professor to the southeast, discovered the allies rapidly moving toward the direction of the Kurabus' village, but he knew that he had not a sufficient force to meet them, and he also deemed it wise to permit them to reach their village, so that they might be able to learn for themselves that, while he had their homes in his power, he had not despoiled them.  This was surprising news to the allies. Such a course meant, either that the Professor and the tribes with him, were afraid of them, or, that Blakely's message to them was in reality true.  Muro's column reached the Professor the following day, and before evening John and the main body came up. The allies were still at the Kurabus' village, and without waiting for the wagon and the remaining part of the force to come up, all started on the march for the south.  The scouts reported commotion in the village, but its cause could not be determined. Undoubtedly they knew of the presence of the force from the north. Camp was made for the night, and when morning came it was evident that the Kurabus had been deserted by their allies, the Tuolos and the Illyas.  Early in the morning the advance was begun, and before ten o'clock a messenger from the Kurabus was taken, and he was brought before the Professor.  \"Why have you been fighting us?\" asked the Professor.  \"My people thought you were trying to kill us.\"  \"Why do you come to see us now?\"  \"Because my chief has been deserted by the Illyas and the Tuolos.\"  \"Does he wish to surrender?\"  \"Yes; if the White Chief will not punish him and his people.\"  \"Have any of your warriors gone with the two tribes?\"  \"No.\"  \"You may tell your chief that we do not want war, but peace and friendship, and that we will not injure him or his people and that if we desired bloodshed we would have killed the warriors we took three days ago, and also would have destroyed your villages and taken your women and children captive.\"  The messenger was conducted to the front, and within two hours he returned with the message that the terms were accepted.  \"Then tell your chief that all his weapons must be brought to this place within two hours, and he must come here with them, and surrender to us in person.\"  Within the stipulated time, the Kurabus, with their chief, appeared in their front, and Muro, with his warriors, went out to receive them. It must be understood that Muro's tribe, the Saboros, lived in the territory adjoining the Kurabus to the southeast, and that for years there had been bitter enmity between the two, but the Professor did not affect to know this.  When the chief, Tastoa, entered the camp, he glanced around at the warriors, but did not exhibit apparent alarm. He marched direct to the Professor, with arms folded, and showed a dignified attitude, notwithstanding his humiliation. His mien plainly showed that he surrendered to the White Chief, and not to his late allies or enemies.  In explanation of this, it should be said, that in a previous expedition against the Professor the Kurabus and the Saboros had been allied, and on the way, while they were surrounding the party of whites, had a disagreement which resulted in a separation and enmity.  \"I have come to surrender to the White Chief. The Tuolo and the Illyas would not agree with me that you meant no harm, and that you would do as you said, and have left me.\"  \"Then you have surrendered only because your allies left you?\"  \"No; but because we believed you did not want revenge.\"  \"What made you think so?\"  \"When we saw that you did not destroy our villages, and did not take our women and children, when you could have done so, we believed you. We believe the Great White Chief, but we do not believe the different tribes.\"  \"Then I cannot accept your surrender. You may take all your weapons and return to your village, and if you choose to do so, join your late allies. We will not make a movement against you until you have done so. You must believe Suros and Uraso, and Oma and Muro, as well as myself.\"  He cast a curious glance about him, as the Professor spoke. This was a new species of warfare. What! allow him to return and continue the war, after he was in their power? The savage mind could not comprehend its meaning.  \"Why does the White Chief offer me such terms? I am in his power.\"  \"Because the white man does not believe in taking advantage of an enemy who has entrusted himself in his hands. As long as he is here he will not permit it, and the chiefs who are with me will not ask me to do it.\"  \"I do not understand this. Does Suros say so?\"  \"The White Chief says the truth. He brings us a message from the Great Spirit. That message is different from the ones we learned. He has told me why our message is wrong, and my people will never again attack another people.\"  This declaration bewildered Tastoa. He had heard the words of the wise Suros. But Oma arose and said: \"I have been your enemy and you have been ours. The White Chief has been good to us, and I could not understand why. He has told us new things, and how we may live in happiness, and we believe him. When we took your warriors and captured your villages three days ago, he ordered that no one should be hurt, and he has given the warriors the best of food, and treated them as he treated his own warriors. We will follow his ways.\"  Muro's eyes glistened as he arose to speak. \"I and my people love the Great White Chief. I have come from their village, and all they have in the village is now coming to all of our people, and we are to learn the new way of living. From the time the White Chief rescued me from you, he has said to us, 'Do not kill; do not kill; but you have a right to defend yourselves.' They have made the weapons which talk with fire, and there are so many of them that they could quickly kill all of your people, if he would permit it. Now we are going to live like the White Chief tells us.\"  \"Then, if the White Chief tells me I must believe the Chiefs I will do so.\"  \"There is another thing which you must do. The Illyas have some of the white people in captivity. You must send a messenger and say that if they injure the captives I will visit them and destroy them and their villages, and that they must at once return to us, and if they do not, we will go there and take them by force.\"  \"It shall be done.\"  \"Muro, you may restore the weapons to the Kurabus.\"  While the foregoing proceedings caused the utmost wonder in all of its phases, the restoration of the arms was one which so completely astonished them that the Chief could hardly speak. He finally approached the Professor, and grasping him by the hand, said:  \"I have never heard of such things before.\"  \"You must have your weapons, because your people must have food. Go to your villages now, and take with you the warriors we took three days ago. We have given them back their weapons, as you see.\"  Ralsea, Oma and Suros then pressed forward, and held out the hands of friendship to him. He then turned to the Professor and said: \"I do not see Uraso.\"  \"No; he is with the people who are coming from our village, but he will be the first one to go to you and tell you what the others have said.\"  The first act of Tastoa was to select the fleetest runner, to attempt overtaking the Illyas, in order to deliver the message which the Professor had instructed him to communicate.     CHAPTER V  THE NEW TOWN SITE. THE WATER WHEEL AND THE SAWMILL   The Professor and his party immediately left for the Brabos' village, and before noon of the next day, Uraso, with the wagons and package train, came in sight. The warriors, together with the chiefs, and the two boys, Jim and Will, rushed to meet them, leaving the Professor and Chief Suros almost deserted. They smiled at the eagerness of all. They were just like boys.  When the procession from the village came up they surrounded the wagon and Uraso's warriors, and took the packages from the carriers, bearing them in triumph to the village, and passed before the Professor and Suros. The boys began the dancing, and the warriors took up the suggestion, and improved on it. The hilarity knew no bounds.  Uraso was the first to tell the warriors who were with him of the surrender of the Kurabus. This acted like a stimulant to the assembly.  Later in the day, when peace and order had been restored, the Professor addressed them as follows: \"Suros and I have enjoyed the dance and the joys you have had as much as you who have taken part in it. We are both so happy to know that you have become brothers. When we leave this village the Brabos will know that they are safe from all harm, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21833"],["title","Experiences of a Dug-out, 1914-1918 (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This file was produced from images generously made available by The Internet Archive/Canadian Libraries)      [Transcriber's note: Obvious printer's errors have been corrected, all other inconsistencies are as in the original.
