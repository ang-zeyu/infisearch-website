The old gentleman would only rise into the air and sail away with a loud haw-haw.  Now, Mr. Crow was a famous tease. He dearly loved to annoy others. And he gave Turkey Proudfoot a sly glance.  \"Ouch!\" he exclaimed. \"I have a twinge of rheumatism.\"  \"Where is your pain?\" asked Turkey Proudfoot.  \"In one of my drumsticks,\" said old Mr. Crow promptly, with a spluttering cough, to keep from laughing.  Turkey Proudfoot was furious.  \"Cranberry sauce and drumsticks!\" he exclaimed. \"You do choose the most painful things to talk about.\"  \"I was only trying to be polite,\" Mr. Crow told him. \"You're always complaining that I don't talk about matters you can understand.\"  \"I understand these only too well--\" Turkey Proudfoot said--\"especially at this season of the year!\"     XXIII  VACATION TIME   It was well along in November. And Turkey Proudfoot was feeling fidgetty. Whenever Farmer Green or the hired man stepped into the yard, he started up with a wild look in his eye.  Turkey Proudfoot was no longer roosting at night in the tree near the farmhouse.  With the coming of cold weather he had been glad enough to roost under a shed beside the barn.  Ever since the winter before, Turkey Proudfoot had enjoyed sound sleeps at night. But for weeks now he had often waked up in the middle of the night and found himself all a-shiver.  \"It's the fault of that horrid old Mr. Crow,\" Turkey Proudfoot complained to old dog Spot one day. \"He would talk about cranberry sauce and drumsticks. And of course a person can't sleep well with such things on his mind.\"  Old dog Spot nodded.  \"Isn't it about time for you to go on your yearly vacation?\" he inquired.  \"Don't talk so loud!\" Turkey Proudfoot hissed. And he took a quick glance all around. Then he said to old dog Spot, in almost a whisper, \"To-morrow morning I'll be missing. Now, don't tell anybody!\"  \"Certainly not!\" Spot promised. \"I'm glad you're going away for a little change. I've thought lately that you were getting more peevish and quarrelsome than ever.\"  \"I'm not!\" Turkey Proudfoot gobbled. \"I may be a bit excitable because I've lost a good deal of sleep lately. But I'm as good-natured as I ever was.\"  \"Oh, very well!\" said Spot. \"I'll admit all that. I certainly don't want to quarrel with you just as you're going to leave us for a while.... We shall miss you while you're gone,\" he added with a sly smile. \"The place will seem very quiet without your gobble.\"  \"Yes, I dare say it will be lonesome around here,\" Turkey Proudfoot agreed. \"And I suppose things will be in a muddle in the farmyard by the time I get back, with nobody to keep order there.\"  \"I'll do the best I can while you're away,\" old dog Spot promised.  Turkey Proudfoot seemed doubtful that Spot could take his place.  \"Keep your tail still when you bark,\" he told the old dog. \"These farmyard fowls won't pay much attention to you if they see your tail a-wagging.\"  \"I'll remember what you say,\" Spot answered.  \"Be sure to keep a sharp eye on that Rooster.\" Turkey Proudfoot went on. \"I don't want him to get the idea into his head that he's running things in this, farmyard.\"  \"Very well!\" said Spot. \"Shall I let him crow a bit, if he wants to?\"  \"Let him crow--yes!\" Turkey Proudfoot answered. \"But if he starts to gobbling--well, you'd better send for me at once.\"  \"What about the Peacock?\" Spot inquired wickedly. He knew that Turkey Proudfoot was frightfully jealous of Johnnie Green's newest pet.  \"The Peacock!\" Turkey Proudfoot squawked. \"Pull out his tail feathers--every one of them! I've been intending to do that myself. But I've been so busy that I haven't had the time for it.\"  Then they said good-by.  \"You ought to tell me where you're going,\" Spot suggested. \"If the Rooster should gobble I must know where to find you.\"  So Turkey Proudfoot told him. He told him in such a low tone that nobody else could hear.     XXIV  BROTHER TOM   It was almost dark in the cornfield on a crisp evening late in November. It was not Farmer Green's field, but that of a neighbor of his. And it was far from any house.  The pumpkins had been gathered weeks before. The cornstalks had long since been cut and now stood in shocks amidst the stubble.  On the whole, the scene was bleak and dismal. Not a creature moved anywhere. Even the meadow, mice had already found the nights too chilly for their liking. Turkey Proudfoot was there alone, standing like a statue, as if he were waiting for somebody.  \"I don't see where he can be,\" Turkey Proudfoot muttered. \"I've spent three days and three nights here already. And he has never been late before in all the years that I've been coming here for my vacation.\"  At last Turkey Proudfoot bestirred himself. With a hop, skip and a jump he landed on top of the rail fence that surrounded the field and settled himself for the night.  He had scarcely closed his eyes when a faint \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble_\" from across the cornfield drove all idea of sleep out of his head. He started up, stretched his long neck as high as he could, and burst forth with a deafening \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble!_\" Then he paused and listened.  The answer soon reached him. It was nearer this time. And after Turkey Proudfoot had repeated his interesting remark about a dozen times a huge old turkey cock came running up and alighted, panting, upon the fence-rail where Turkey Proudfoot was roosting.  \"You're late,\" Turkey Proudfoot greeted him. \"I'd begun to fear that you had met with an accident. What kept you?\"  \"They shut me up in a pen,\" the newcomer told him. He was still somewhat out of breath, partly because of rage at having been imprisoned, partly because he had been hurrying. \"They shut me up two days ago,\" he explained.  \"Ah!\" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. \"You ought to have left home three days ago. Did you forget our yearly meeting?\"  \"No!\" said the other. \"But I must have miscounted the days.\"  \"That's very dangerous at this time of year,\" Turkey Proudfoot replied. \"It's a wonder that you escaped from the pen. How did you manage to slip out!\"  \"Somebody left the door ajar,\" said the strange turkey.  \"Ah! I've always claimed that our family was lucky!\" Turkey Proudfoot cried. And he gave his companion a slap on the back with his wing.  Now, that was a jolly thing to do--and not at all like Turkey Proudfoot. But he was glad to see the newcomer. They were brothers. They had been separated when quite young; and they had lived on neighboring farms all their lives.  For a time they talked together pleasantly enough. Of course Turkey Proudfoot couldn't help boasting about the way he ruled the roost when he was at home. But his brother Tom was just as great a boaster. And after a time each began to think the other's stories somewhat tiresome. So they began to yawn. And at last they fell asleep.  A crescent moon peeped down at them from a clear, cold sky that crackled with stars. A chilling breeze swept down the valley. And sometime during the night Turkey Proudfoot woke up and found himself a-shiver. He sidled along the rail and huddled against his brother Tom.  Brother Tom stirred and stretched himself.  \"This night's a nipper, isn't it?\" he remarked. \"I can't help wishing my legs were like Mr. Grouse's.\"  \"Huh!\" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. \"You'd look queer--as fat as you are--if you had legs as short as his.\"  \"Ah! But his legs are feathered out. And there's nothing like feathers to keep the cold off,\" said Brother Tom.  \"I suppose,\" said Turkey Proudfoot, \"Mr. Grouse's legs wouldn't get as cold as ours do, even if he hadn't a feather on them.\"  \"Why not?\" asked Brother Tom.  \"Because they're shorter,\" said Turkey Proudfoot.  Brother Tom made no reply. He was no longer awake.  Being on the leeward side of his brother, Turkey Proudfoot began to feel warmer.  \"I'm glad Tom's a big fellow,\" he murmured drowsily. \"He makes a fine windbreak.\" Then he too fell asleep.  And the next day was Thanksgiving."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21845"],["title","The Tale of Peter Mink (#0)"],["body","TALE OF PETER MINK  [Illustration: CHECK YOUR HAT AND COAT?]   THE TALE  OF  PETER MINK   BY  ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY   AUTHOR OF  THE CUFFY BEAR STORIES  SLEEPY-TIME TALES, ETC.

In the first place, he had no home; and in the second, he had a very long neck.  The reason why Peter had no home was because he didn't want one. And the reason why he had such a long neck was because he couldn't help it.  When he grew sleepy he would crawl into any snug place he happened to find--sometimes in a hollow stump, or in a pile of rocks, or a haystack. And often he even drove a muskrat out of his house, so he could sleep there.  Most of the time Peter Mink went about in rags and tatters. Whenever he did have a new suit (which wasn't often) it never looked well for long. Naturally, sleeping in all sorts of places did not improve it. But what specially wore out his clothes was the way he was always squeezing through small holes and cracks. Wherever Peter saw a narrow place he never could resist trying to get through it.  He was a long, slim fellow, with a small, snake-like head. And he always knew that if he could squeeze his head through a crack he could get his body through it, too.  It is not at all strange that Mrs. Rabbit and Mrs. Squirrel and Mrs. Woodchuck--as well as a good many other people--did not care to have their sons in Peter Mink's company. They said that any one who went about looking as untidy as he did, and without a home, was not likely to set a good example to the young.  But Jimmy Rabbit and Frisky Squirrel and Billy Woodchuck loved to be with Peter Mink. To be sure, he was quarrelsome. And he was always ready to fight any one four times as big as he was. So they had to be careful not to offend him. But in spite of that, they found him interesting--he was such a fine swimmer. He could swim under water just as well as he could swim with his head above the surface. And in winter he was not afraid to swim under the ice in Broad Brook.  There was another thing about Peter Mink that made the _younger_ forest people admire him. He was a famous fisherman. He could dive for a trout and catch him too, just as likely as not. And there was nothing more exciting than to see Peter Mink pull an eel out of the water.  It is really a great pity that he was so rough. But you see, he left home at an early age and grew up without having any one to tell him what he ought--and ought not--to do. No doubt he didn't know the difference between right and wrong. Jimmy Rabbit's mother used to call him \"the Pest.\" She often remarked that she wished Peter would leave the neighborhood and never come back.  I am sure that Johnnie Green's father would have agreed with her, because Peter Mink was too fond of ducks to suit Farmer Green. Of course, Peter didn't care to eat ducks _all_ the time. Sometimes he dined on a fat hen. But even then Farmer Green was angry. No doubt Peter Mink thought him hard to please.     SAWING WOOD   It was really no wonder that Mrs. Rabbit did not like Peter Mink. When you hear what happened the very first time she saw him you will understand why Mrs. Rabbit always called him \"the Pest.\"  One day Mrs. Rabbit heard a knock on her door. And when she went to see who was there, she found a ragged young fellow, with his hat tipped far over on one side. Instead of a collar, he wore a handkerchief about his neck. But it would have taken at least a dozen handkerchiefs, tied one above another, to cover the stranger's neck; for it was by far the longest neck Mrs. Rabbit had ever seen.  \"What do you want?\" Mrs. Rabbit asked.  \"Something to eat!\" said the stranger.  You notice that he didn't say \"Please!\" That was a word that Peter Mink had never used. Probably he didn't even know what it meant.  Now, Mrs. Rabbit saw that the stranger was very thin. She did not know that no matter how much he ate, he would never be what you might call _fat_. That slimness was something that ran in Peter Mink's family. The Minks were always slender people.  Being a kind-hearted soul, Mrs. Rabbit went back to her kitchen. And soon she brought Peter a plateful of the best food she had.  \"You're not ill, are you?\" she asked Peter.  \"No!\" he answered, as he took the dish.  \"Then,\" said Mrs. Rabbit, \"I shall expect you to do some work, to pay for this food.\"  \"All right!\" said Peter. But he wished that he had said he was ill. For he simply hated work. And he made it a rule never to do a stroke of work if he could avoid it.  Well, he sat down on Mrs. Rabbit's doorstep and ate what she had given him. And while he was eating, Jimmy Rabbit came out and watched him. Even Jimmy Rabbit could see that he had very bad manners. He held something to eat in each hand. And he didn't seem to care from which hand he ate, so long as he kept his mouth stuffed so full that he could hardly talk.  \"What's your name?\" Peter Mink asked Jimmy. And when Jimmy told him, he said: \"No wonder you're fat, with such good things to eat as your mother makes.\"  When Mrs. Rabbit heard that she was pleased. And for a time she thought that perhaps the stranger was not so bad as he looked.  When he had almost finished his lunch, Mrs. Rabbit went back into her house once more. And pretty soon she came out with a saw in her hand. She gave the saw to Peter Mink and said:  \"Now you may saw some wood, to pay me for the food. You'll find the wood-pile behind the house. And you may saw all of it,\" she added.  Peter Mink took the saw and started for the wood-pile. And Jimmy Rabbit followed him. Peter sawed just one stick of wood; and then he said to Jimmy:  \"Go in and ask your mother if she can't find an old pair of shoes for me.\"  So Jimmy ran into the house to find his mother. And kind-hearted Mrs. Rabbit began at once to hunt for a pair of shoes to give the stranger. She had noticed that his toes were sticking out.  Pretty soon she found some shoes which she thought would fit the stranger. And when she stepped to her door again, there he was, waiting for her.  \"What! Is the wood all sawed so soon?\" asked Mrs. Rabbit. \"If it is, you're a spry worker, young man!\"  \"The saw--\" said Peter Mink--\"the saw is no good at all. It broke before I finished sawing half the wood-pile.\" And that was true, too, in a way; because he had only sawed one stick.  \"Well, if you've finished half of it you haven't done badly,\" Mrs. Rabbit told him. And she gave Peter Mink the shoes.  \"They're not very new,\" he grumbled. \"But they're better than none.\"  They certainly were much better than the shoes he had been wearing.  Then Peter Mink went slouching off. He did not even thank Mrs. Rabbit for her kindness. He did not even take away his old shoes, but left them on the doorstep for Mrs. Rabbit to pick up.  \"I must say that young man has had no bringing up at all,\" she told Jimmy. \"I hope this is the last we'll see of him.... Come!\" she said. \"Help me bring in some of the wood he sawed.\"  Well, Mrs. Rabbit was surprised when she found that the stranger had sawed only one stick.  When Mr. Rabbit came home he took just one look at his broken saw. And _he_ was more than surprised. _He_ was angry.  \"Why,\" he said, \"I do believe that good-for-nothing rascal broke my saw on purpose, so he wouldn't have to work.\"     MAKING PETER WORK   Peter Mink waited several days before he knocked at Mrs. Rabbit's door again. And when he did at last come back, he first made sure that her husband was not at home. You see, Peter had heard that Mr. Rabbit had told some of the forest-people that Peter had broken his saw, so he wouldn't have to saw wood to pay for the food that Mrs. Rabbit gave him.  When Mrs. Rabbit saw who it was that knocked, she came very near shutting the door in Peter's face. But she couldn't help noticing again how thin Peter was. And when he asked again for something to eat she hadn't the heart to refuse him.  \"You're not ill, are you?\" she asked.  \"Well--yes, I am!\" said Peter Mink, boldly. He would actually rather tell a lie than work. And he thought that if he said he was ill, Mrs. Rabbit wouldn't expect him to do any work to pay for what she might give him.  \"You look to me as if you needed some cambric tea,\" Mrs. Rabbit said.  Now, if there was anything that Peter Mink disliked, it was cambric tea. If she had said \"chicken broth,\" he might have liked that.  \"I've been very ill,\" he said. \"But now the doctor tells me I must have good, nourishing food--and plenty of it.\"  \"Well, if you're well enough to eat, you're well enough to work,\" said Mrs. Rabbit.  \"Oh, certainly!\" answered Peter.  Mrs. Rabbit went into the house then. And when she came out again Peter Mink was surprised at what she brought. He had expected another plateful of goodies. But instead of that, Mrs. Rabbit"]]]
