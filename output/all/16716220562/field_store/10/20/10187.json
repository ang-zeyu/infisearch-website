Well, boys, that's what the ghost said in a muffled vice--their vices are muffled, you know, an their virtues too, for all I know to the contrairy.  It's a good sentiment is that `Now or niver' for every wan of ye--so ye may putt it in yer pipes an' smoke it, an' those of ye who haven't got pipes can make a quid of it an' chaw it, or subject it to meditation.  `Now or niver!'  Think o' that!  You see I'm partikler about it, for the whole story turns on that pint, as the ghost's life depended on it, but ye'll see an' onderstan' better whin I come to the end o' the story.\"  Paddy said this so earnestly that it had the double effect of chaining the attention of his hearers and sending a flash of light into Tom Brixton's brain.  \"Now or never!\" he muttered to himself, and turned gently on his side so as to be able to feel the cord that bound his wrists.  It was still tight, but, by moving his fingers, he could feel that one of its coils had really been cut, and that with a little patience and exertion he might possibly free his hands.  Slight as the motion was, however, Gashford observed it, for the fire-light shone brightly on Tom's recumbent figure.  \"Lie still, there!\" he cried, sternly.  Tom lay perfectly still, and the Irishman continued his story.  It grew in mystery and in horror as he proceeded, and his audience became entranced, while some of the more superstitious among them cast occasional glances over their shoulders into the forest behind, which ere long was steeped in the blackness of an unusually dark night.  A few of those outside the circle rose and drew nearer to the story-teller.  At that moment a gleam of light which had already entered Brixton's brain flashed into that of Fred Westly, who arose, and, under pretext of being too far off from the speaker, went round to the opposite side of the fire so as to face him.  By so doing he placed himself between the fire and his friend Tom.  Two or three of the others followed his example, though not from the same motive, and thus, when the fire burnt low, the prisoner found himself lying in deep shadow.  By that time he had freed his benumbed hands, chafed them into a condition of vitality, and was considering whether he should endeavour to creep quietly away or spring up and make a dash for life.  \"`Now or niver,' said the ghost, in a solemn muffled vice,\" continued Paddy--  \"Who did he say that to?\" asked Gashford, who was by that time as much fascinated as the rest of the party.  \"To the thief, sor, av coorse, who was standin' tremblin' fornint him, while the sexton was diggin' the grave to putt him in alive--in the dark shadow of a big tombstone.\"  The Irishman had now almost reached the climax of his story, and was intensely graphic in his descriptions--especially at the horrible parts. He was obviously spinning it out, and the profound silence around told how completely he had enchained his hearers.  It also warned Tom Brixton that his time was short, and that in his case it was indeed, \"now or never.\"  He crept quietly towards the bushes near him.  In passing a tree against which several rifles had been placed he could not resist the temptation to take one.  Laying hold of that which stood nearest, and which seemed to be similar in make to the rifle they had taken from himself when he was captured, he drew it towards him.  Unfortunately it formed a prop to several other rifles, which fell with a crash, and one of them exploded in the fall.  The effect on Paddy's highly-strung audience was tremendous.  Many of them yelled as if they had received an electric shock.  All of them sprang up and turned round just in time to see their captive vanish, not unlike a ghost, into the thick darkness!  That glance, however, was sufficient to enlighten them.  With shouts of rage many of them darted after the fugitive, and followed him up like bloodhounds.  Others, who had never been very anxious for his capture or death, and had been turned somewhat in his favour by the bold stand he had made against the bear, returned to the fire after a short run.  If there had been even a glimmering of light Tom would certainly have been retaken at once, for not a few of his pursuers were quite as active and hardy as himself, but the intense darkness favoured him. Fortunately the forest immediately behind him was not so dense as elsewhere, else in his first desperate rush, regardless of consequences, he would probably have dashed himself against a tree.  As it was he went right through a thicket and plunged headlong into a deep hole.  He scrambled out of this with the agility of a panther, just in time to escape Gashford, who chanced to plunge into the same hole, but not so lightly.  Heavy though he was, however, his strength was equal to the shock, and he would have scrambled out quickly enough if Crossby had not run on the same course and tumbled on the top of him.  Amid the growling half-fight, half-scramble that ensued, Tom crept swiftly away to the left, but the pursuers had so scattered themselves that he heard them panting and stumbling about in every direction-- before, on either hand, and behind.  Hurrying blindly on for a few paces, he almost ran into the arms of a man whom he could hear, though he could not see him, and stopped.  \"Hallo! is that you, Bill Smith?\" demanded the man.  \"Ay, that's me,\" replied Tom, promptly, mimicking Bill Smith's voice and gasping violently.  \"I thought you were Brixton.  He's just passed this way.  I saw him.\"  \"Did you?--where?\"  \"Away there--to the left!\"  Off went the pursuer as fast as he dared, and Tom continued his flight with more caution.  \"Hallo! hi! hooroo!\" came at that moment from a long distance to the right, in unmistakable tones.  \"Here he is, down this way.  Stop, you big thief!  Howld him.  Dick!  Have ye got him?\"  There was a general rush and scramble towards the owner of the bass voice, and Tom, who at once perceived the ruse, went quietly off in the opposite direction.  Of course, the hunt came to an end in a very few minutes.  Every one, having more or less damaged his head, knees, elbows, and shins, came to the natural conclusion that a chase in the dark was absurd as well as hopeless, and in a short time all were reassembled round the fire, where Fred Westly still stood, for he had not joined in the pursuit.  Gashford was the last to come up, with the exception of Paddy Flinders.  The bully came forward, fuming with rage, and strode up to Fred Westly with a threatening look.  \"You were at the bottom of this!\" he cried, doubling his huge fist.  \"It was you who cut the rope, for no mortal man could have untied it!\"  \"Indeed I did not!\" replied Fred, with a steady but not defiant look.  \"Then it must have bin your little chum Flinders.  Where is he?\"  \"How could Flinders ha' done it when he was tellin' a ghost story?\" said Crossby.  Gashford turned with a furious look to the speaker, and seemed on the point of venting his ill-humour upon him, when he was arrested by the sound of the Irishman's voice shouting in the distance.  As he drew nearer the words became intelligible.  \"Howld him tight, now! d'ye hear?  Och! whereiver have ye gone an' lost yersilf?  Howld him tight till I come an' help ye!  What! is it let him go ye have?  Ah then it's wishin' I had the eyes of a cat this night for I can't rightly see the length of my nose.  Sure ye've niver gone an' let him go?  Don't say so, now!\" wound up Paddy as, issuing from the wood, he advanced into the circle of light.  \"Who's got hold of him, Flin?\" asked one of the men as he came up.  \"Sorrow wan o' me knows,\" returned the Irishman, wiping the perspiration from his brow; \"d'ye suppose I can see in the dark like the moles?  All I know is that half a dozen of ye have bin shoutin' `Here he is!' an' another half-dozen, `No, he's here--this way!' an' sure I ran this way an' then I ran that way--havin' a nat'ral disposition to obey orders, acquired in the Louth Militia--an' then I ran my nose flat on a tree-- bad luck to it!--that putt more stars in me hid than you'll see in the sky this night.  Ah! ye may laugh, but it's truth I'm tellin'.  See, there's a blob on the ind of it as big as a chirry!\"  \"That blob's always there, Paddy,\" cried one of the men; \"it's a grog-blossom.\"  \"There now, Peter, don't become personal.  But tell me--ye've got him, av coorse?\"  \"No, we haven't got him,\" growled Crossby.  \"Well, now, you're a purty lot o' hunters.  Sure if--\"  \"Come, shut up, Flinders,\" interrupted Gashford, swallowing his wrath. (Paddy brought his teeth together with a snap in prompt obedience.) \"You know well enough that we haven't got him, and you know you're not sorry for it; but mark my words, I'll hunt him down yet.  Who'll go with me?\"  \"I'll go,\" said Crossby, stepping forward at once.  \"I've a grudge agin the puppy, and I'll help to make him swing if I can.\"  Half a dozen other men, who were noted for leading idle and dissipated lives, and who would rather have hunted men than nothing, also offered to go, but the most of the party had had enough of it, and resolved to return home in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21706"],["title","Twice Bought (#5)"],["body"," morning.  \"We can't go just now, however,\" said Crossby, \"we'd only break our legs or necks.\"  \"The moon will rise in an hour,\" returned Gashford; \"we can start then.\"  He flung himself down sulkily on the ground beside the fire and began to fill his pipe.  Most of the others followed his example, and sat chatting about the recent escape, while a few, rolling themselves in their blankets, resigned themselves to sleep.  About an hour later, as had been predicted, the moon rose, and Gashford with his men set forth.  But by that time the fugitive, groping his way painfully with many a stumble and fall, had managed to put a considerable distance between him and his enemies, so that when the first silvery moonbeans tipped the tree-tops and shed a faint glimmer on the ground, which served to make darkness barely visible, he had secured a good start, and was able to keep well ahead.  The pursuers were not long in finding his track, however, for they had taken a Red Indian with them to act as guide, but the necessity for frequent halts to examine the footprints carefully delayed them much, while Tom Brixton ran straight on without halt or stay.  Still he felt that his chance of escape was by no means a good one, for as he guessed rightly, they would not start without a native guide, and he knew the power and patience of these red men in following an enemy's trail.  What made his case more desperate was the sudden diminution of his strength.  For it must be borne in mind that he had taken but little rest and no food since his flight from Pine Tree Diggings, and the wounds he had received from the bear, although not dangerous, were painful and exhausting.  A feeling of despair crept over the stalwart youth when the old familiar sensation of bodily strength began to forsake him.  Near daybreak he was on the point of casting himself on the ground to take rest at all hazards, when the sound of falling water broke upon his ear.  His spirit revived at once, for he now knew that in his blind wandering he had come near to a well-known river or stream, where he could slake his burning thirst, and, by wading down its course for some distance, throw additional difficulty in the pursuers' way.  Not that he expected by that course to throw them entirely off the scent, he only hoped to delay them.  On reaching the river's brink he fell down on his breast and, applying his lips to the bubbling water, took a deep refreshing draught.  \"God help me!\" he exclaimed, on rising, and then feeling the burden of gold (which, all through his flight had been concealed beneath his shirt, packed flat so as to lie close), he took it off and flung it down.  \"There,\" he said bitterly, \"for _you_ I have sold myself body and soul, and now I fling you away!\"  Instead of resting as he had intended, he now, feeling strengthened, looked about for a suitable place to enter the stream and wade down so as to leave no footprints behind.  To his surprise and joy he observed the bow of a small Indian canoe half hidden among the bushes.  It had apparently been dragged there by its owner, and left to await his return, for the paddles were lying under it.  Launching this frail bark without a moment's delay, he found that it was tight; pushed off and went rapidly down with the current.  Either he had forgotten the gold in his haste, or the disgust he had expressed was genuine, for he left it lying on the bank.  He now no longer fled without a purpose.  Many miles down that same stream there dwelt a gold-digger in a lonely hut.  His name was Paul Bevan.  He was an eccentric being, and a widower with an only child, a daughter, named Elizabeth--better known as Betty.  One phase of Paul Bevan's eccentricity was exhibited in his selection of a spot in which to search for the precious metal.  It was a savage, gloomy gorge, such as a misanthrope might choose in which to end an unlovely career.  But Bevan was no misanthrope.  On the contrary, he was one of those men who are gifted with amiable dispositions, high spirits, strong frames, and unfailing health.  He was a favourite with all who knew him, and, although considerably past middle life, possessed much of the fire, energy, and light-heartedness of youth.  There is no accounting for the acts of eccentric men, and we make no attempt to explain why it was that Paul Bevan selected a home which was not only far removed from the abodes of other men, but which did not produce much gold.  Many prospecting parties had visited the region from time to time, under the impression that Bevan had discovered a rich mine, which he was desirous of keeping all to himself; but, after searching and digging all round the neighbourhood, and discovering that gold was to be found in barely paying quantities, they had left in search of more prolific fields, and spread the report that Paul Bevan was an eccentric fellow.  Some said he was a queer chap; others, more outspoken, styled him an ass, but all agreed in the opinion that his daughter Betty was the finest girl in Oregon.  Perhaps this opinion may account for the fact that many of the miners-- especially the younger among them--returned again and again to Bevan's Gully to search for gold although the search was not remunerative. Among those persevering though unsuccessful diggers had been, for a considerable time past, our hero Tom Brixton.  Perhaps the decision with which Elizabeth Bevan repelled him had had something to do with his late reckless life.  But we must guard the reader here from supposing that Betty Bevan was a beauty.  She was not.  On the other hand, she was by no means plain, for her complexion was good, her nut-brown hair was soft and wavy, and her eyes were tender and true.  It was the blending of the graces of body and of soul that rendered Betty so attractive.  As poor Tom Brixton once said in a moment of confidence to his friend Westly, while excusing himself for so frequently going on prospecting expeditions to Bevan's Gully, \"There's no question about it, Fred; she's the sweetest girl in Oregon--pshaw! in the world, I should have said.  Loving-kindness beams in her eyes, sympathy ripples on her brow, grace dwells in her every motion, and honest, straightforward simplicity sits enthroned upon her countenance!\"  Even Crossby, the surly digger, entertained similar sentiments regarding her, though he expressed them in less refined language.  \"She's a bu'ster,\" he said once to a comrade, \"that's what _she_ is, an' no mistake about it.  What with her great eyes glarin' affection, an' her little mouth smilin' good-natur', an' her figure goin' about as graceful as a small cat at play--why, I tell 'ee what it is, mate, with such a gal for a wife a feller might snap his fingers at hunger an' thirst, heat an' cold, bad luck an' all the rest of it.  But she's got one fault that don't suit me.  She's overly religious--an' that don't pay at the diggin's.\"  This so-called fault did indeed appear to interfere with Betty Bevan's matrimonial prospects, for it kept a large number of dissipated diggers at arm's-length from her, and it made even the more respectable men feel shy in her presence.  Tom Brixton, however, had not been one of her timid admirers.  He had a drop or two of Irish blood in his veins which rendered that impossible! Before falling into dissipated habits he had paid his addresses to her boldly.  Moreover, his suit was approved by Betty's father, who had taken a great fancy to Tom.  But, as we have said, this Rose of Oregon repelled Tom.  She did it gently and kindly, it is true, but decidedly.  It was, then, towards the residence of Paul Bevan that the fugitive now urged his canoe, with a strange turmoil of conflicting emotions however; for, the last time he had visited the Gully he had been at least free from the stain of having broken the laws of man.  Now, he was a fugitive and an outlaw, with hopes and aspirations blighted and the last shred of self-respect gone.    CHAPTER FOUR.  When Tom Brixton had descended the river some eight or ten miles he deemed himself pretty safe from his pursuers, at least for the time being, as his rate of progress with the current far exceeded the pace at which men could travel on foot; and besides, there was the strong probability that, on reaching the spot where the canoe had been entered and the bag of gold left on the bank, the pursuers would be partially satisfied as well as baffled, and would return home.  On reaching a waterfall, therefore, where the navigable part of the river ended and its broken course through Bevan's Gully began, he landed without any show of haste, drew the canoe up on the bank, where he left it concealed among bushes, and began quietly to descend by a narrow footpath with which he had been long familiar.  Up to that point the unhappy youth had entertained no definite idea as to why he was hurrying towards the hut of Paul Bevan, or what he meant to say for himself on reaching it.  But towards noon, as he drew near to it, the thought of Betty in her innocence and purity oppressed him.  She rose before his mind's eye like a reproving angel.  How could he ever face her with the dark stain of a mean theft upon his soul?  How could he find courage to confess his guilt to her? or, supposing that he did not confess it, how could he forge the tissue of lies that would be necessary to account for his sudden appearance, and in such guise--bloodstained, wounded, haggard, and worn out with fatigue and hunger?  Such thoughts now drove him to the verge of despair.  Even if Betty were to refrain from putting awkward questions, there was no chance whatever of Paul Bevan being so considerate.  Was he then to attempt to deceive them, or was he to reveal all?  He shrank from answering the question, for he believed that Bevan was an honest man, and feared that he would have nothing further to do with him when he learned that he had become a common thief.  A thief!  How the idea burned into his heart, now that the"]]]
