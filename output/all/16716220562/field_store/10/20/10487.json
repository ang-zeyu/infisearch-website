Vol. 2 (#4)"],["body","that the petition requested Congress to take action on a question over which they had no control. Waln, Thacher, Smilie, Dana, and Gallatin contended that there were portions of the petition that came within the jurisdiction of the Constitution, and, therefore, ought to be received and acted upon. Mr. Rutledge demanded the yeas and nays; but in such a spirit as put Mr. Waln on his guard, so he withdrew his motion, and submitted another one by which such parts of the memorial as came within the jurisdiction of Congress should be referred. Mr. Rutledge raised a point of order on the motion of the gentleman from Pennsylvania that a \"part\" of the memorial could not be referred, but was promptly overruled. Mr. Gray, of Virginia, moved to amend by adding a declaratory clause that the portions of the memorial, not referred, inviting Congress to exercise authority not delegated, \"have a tendency to create disquiet and jealousy, and ought, therefore, to receive the pointed disapprobation of this House.\" After some discussion, it was finally agreed to strike out the last clause and insert the following: \"ought therefore to receive no encouragement or countenance from this House.\" The call of the roll resulted in the adoption of the amendment, with but one vote in the negative by Mr. Thacher, of Maine, an uncompromising enemy of slavery. The committee to whom the memorial was referred brought in a bill during the session prohibiting American ships from supplying slaves from the United States to foreign markets.  On the 2d of April, 1802, Georgia ceded the territory lying west of her present limits, now embracing the States of Alabama and Mississippi. Among the conditions she exacted was the following:       \"That the territory thus ceded shall become a State, and be      admitted into the Union as soon as it shall contain sixty      thousand free inhabitants, or at an earlier period, if Congress      shall think it expedient, on the same conditions and      restrictions, with the same privileges, and in the same manner,      as provided in the ordinance of Congress of the 13th day of July,      1787, for the government of the western territory of the United      States: which ordinance shall, in all its parts, extend to the      territory contained in the present act of cession, the article      only excepted which forbids slavery.\"  The demand was acceded to, and, as the world knows, Alabama and Mississippi became the most cruel slave States in the United States.  Ohio adopted a State constitution in 1802-3, and the residue of the territory not included in the State as it is now, was designated as Indiana Territory. William Henry Harrison was appointed governor. One of the earliest moves of the government of the new territory was to secure a modification of the ordinance of 1787 by which slavery or involuntary servitude was prohibited in the territory northwest of the Ohio River. It was ordered by a convention presided over by Gen. Harrison in 1802-3, that a memorial be sent to Congress urging a restriction of the ordinance of 1787. It was referred to a select committee, with John Randolph as chairman. On the 2d of March, 1803, he made a report by the unanimous request of his committee, and the portion referring to slavery was as follows:       \"The rapid population of the State of Ohio sufficiently evinces,      in the opinion of your committee, that the labor of slaves is not      necessary to promote the growth and settlement of colonies in      that region. That this labor--demonstrably the dearest of      any--can only be employed in the cultivation of products more      valuable than any known to that quarter of the United States;      that the committee deem it highly dangerous and inexpedient to      impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and      prosperity of the northwestern country, and to give strength and      security to that extensive frontier. In the salutary operations      of this sagacious and benevolent restraint, it is believed that      the inhabitants of Indiana will, at no very distant day, find      ample remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of      emigration.\"  After discussing the subject-matter embodied in the memorial from the territory of Indiana, the committee presented eight resolves, one of which related to the subject of slavery, and was as follows:       \"_Resolved_, That it is inexpedient to suspend, for a limited      time, the operation of the sixth article of the compact between      the original States and the people and the States west of the      river Ohio.\"  Congress was about to close its session, and, therefore, there was no action taken upon this report. At the next session it went into the hands of a new committee whose chairman was CÃ¦sar Rodney, of Delaware, who had just been elected to Congress. On the 17th of February, 1804, Mr. Rodney made the following report:       \"That taking into their consideration the facts stated in the      said memorial and petition, they are induced to believe that a      qualified suspension, for a limited time, of the sixth article of      compact between the original States and the people and States      west of the river Ohio, might be productive of benefit and      advantage to said territory.\"  After discussing other matters contained in the Indiana petition, the committee says, in reference to slavery:       \"That the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787, which      prohibited slavery within the said territory, be suspended in a      qualified manner for ten years, so as to permit the introduction      of slaves born within the United States, from any of the      individual States: _provided_, that such individual State does      not permit the importation of slaves from foreign countries;      _and_ provided _further_, that the descendants of all such slaves      shall, if males, be free at the age of twenty-five years, and, if      female, at the age of twenty-one years.\"  The House did not take up and act upon this report, and so the matter passed for the time being. But the original memorial, with several petitions of like import, came before Congress in 1805-6. They were referred to a select committee, and on the 14th of February, 1806, Mr. Garnett, of Virginia, the chairman, made the following favorable report:       \"That, having attentively considered the facts stated in the said      petitions and memorials, they are of opinion that a qualified      suspension for a limited time, of the sixth article of compact      between the original States and the people and States west of the      river Ohio, would be beneficial to the people of the Indiana      Territory. The suspension of this article is an object almost      universally desired in that Territory.       \"It appears to your committee to be a question entirely different      from that between Slavery and Freedom; inasmuch as it would      merely occasion the removal of persons, already slaves, from one      part of the country to another. The good effects of this      suspension, in the present instance, would be to accelerate the      population of that Territory, hitherto retarded by the operation      of that article of compact, as slave-holders emigrating into the      Western country might then indulge any preference which they      might feel for a settlement in the Indiana Territory, instead of      seeking, as they are now compelled to do, settlements in other      States or countries permitting the introduction of slaves. The      condition of the slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by      it, as it is evident, from experience, that the more they are      separated and diffused, the more care and attention are bestowed      on them by their masters--each proprietor having it in his power      to increase their comforts and conveniences, in proportion to the      smallness of their numbers. The dangers, too (if any are to be      apprehended), from too large a black population existing in any      one section of country, would certainly be very much diminished,      if not entirely removed. But whether dangers are to be feared      from this source or not, it is certainly an obvious dictate of      sound policy to guard against them, as far as possible. If this      danger does exist, or there is any cause to apprehend it, and our      Western brethren are not only willing but desirous to aid us in      taking precautions against it, would it not be wise to accept      their assistance?       \"We should benefit ourselves, without injuring them, as their      population must always so far exceed any black population which      can ever exist in that country, as to render the idea of danger      from that source chimerical.\"  After a lengthy discussion of matters embodied in the Indiana memorial, the committee recommended the following resolve on the question of slavery:       \"_Resolved_, That the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787,      which prohibits slavery within the Indiana Territory, be      suspended for ten years, so as to permit the introduction of      slaves born within the United States, from any of the individual      States.\"  The report and resolves were made the special order for the following Monday, but were never called up.  At the opening of the next session, Gen. Harrison presented another letter, accompanied by several resolves passed by the Legislative Council and House of Representatives, urging the passage of a measure restricting the ordinance of 1787. The letter and enclosures were received on the 21st of January, 1807, and referred to the following select committee: Parke, of Indiana, chairman; Alston, North Carolina; Masters, New York; Morrow, Ohio; Rhea, Tennessee; Sandford, Kentucky; Trigg, Virginia.  On the 12th of February, 1807, the chairman, Mr. Parke, made the following report in favor of the request of the memorialists [the _third_]. It was unanimous.       \"The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21851"],["title","History of the Negro Race in America from 1619 to 1880. Vol. 2 (#5)"],["body","of the Legislative Council and House of      Representatives of the Indiana Territory relate to a suspension,      for the term of ten years, of the sixth article of compact      between the United States and the Territories and States      northwest of the river Ohio, passed the 13th July, 1787. That      article declares that there shall be neither Slavery nor      involuntary servitude in the said Territory.       \"The suspension of the said article would operate an immediate      and essential benefit to the Territory, as emigration to it will      be inconsiderable for many years, except from those States where      Slavery is tolerated.       \"And although it is not considered expedient to force the      population of the Territory, yet it is desirable to connect its      scattered settlements, and, in admitted political rights, to      place it on an equal footing with the different States. From the      interior situation of the Territory, it is not believed that      slaves could ever become so numerous as to endanger the internal      peace or future prosperity of the country. The current of      emigration flowing to the Western country, the Territories should      all be opened to their introduction. The abstract question of      Liberty and Slavery is not involved in the proposed measure, as      Slavery now exists to a considerable extent in different parts of      the Union; it would not augment the number of slaves, but merely      authorize the removal to Indiana of such as are held in bondage      in the United States. If Slavery is an evil, means ought to be      devised to render it least dangerous to the community, and by      which the hapless situation of the slaves would be most      ameliorated; and to accomplish these objects, no measure would be      so effectual as the one proposed. The Committee, therefore,      respectfully submit to the House the following resolution:       \"_Resolved_, That it is expedient to suspend, from and after the      1st day of January, 1808, the sixth article of compact between      the United States and the Territories and States northwest of the      Ohio, passed the 13th day of July, 1787, for the term of ten      years.\"  Like its predecessor this report was made a special order, but was never taken up.  On the 7th of November, 1807, the President laid a letter from Gen. Harrison [probably the one already referred to], and the resolves of his Legislature, before Congress, and that body referred them to a select committee consisting of Franklin, of North Carolina; Ketchel, of New Jersey; and Tiffin, of Ohio.  On the 13th of November, Mr. Franklin made the following adverse report:       \"The Legislative Council and House of Representatives, in their      resolutions, express their sense of the propriety of introducing      Slavery into their Territory, and solicit the Congress of the      United States to suspend, for a given number of years, the sixth      article of compact, in the ordinance for the government of the      Territory northwest of the Ohio, passed the 13th day of July,      1787. That article declares: 'There shall be neither Slavery nor      involuntary servitude within the said Territory.'       \"The citizens of Clark County, in their remonstrance, express      their sense of the impropriety of the measure, and solicit the      Congress of the United States not to act on the subject, so as to      permit the introduction of slaves into the Territory; at least,      until their population shall entitle them to form a constitution      and State government.       \"Your Committee, after duly considering the matter, respectfully      submit the following resolution:       \"_Resolved_, That it is not expedient at this time to suspend the      sixth article of compact for the government of the Territory of      the United States northwest of the river Ohio.\"  Thus ended in defeat the stubborn effort to secure a restriction of the ordinance of 1787, and the admission of slavery into the Territory lying west of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, now comprising the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.  In his message to Congress at the commencement of the session of 1806-7, President Jefferson suggested to that body the wisdom of abolishing the African slave-trade. He said in this connection:       \"I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the      period at which you may interpose your authority,      constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens of the United States      from all further participation in those violations of human      rights which have so long been continued on the unoffending      inhabitants of Africa, and which the morality, the reputation,      and the best interest of our country have long been eager to      proscribe.\"  This portion of the message was referred to a select committee; and in due time they reported a bill \"to prohibit the importation or bringing of slaves into the United States or the territories thereof after the 31st day of December, 1807.\"  Mr. Early, of Georgia, the chairman of the committee, inserted a clause into the bill requiring that all slaves illegally imported \"should be forfeited and sold for life for the benefit of the United States.\" A long debate ensued and was conducted with fiery earnestness from beginning to end. It was urged in support of the above regulation, that nothing else could be done but to sell them; that it would never do to release them in the States where they might be captured, poor, ignorant, and dangerous. It was said by the opponents of the measure, that Congress could not regulate the matter, as the States had the reserved authority to have slavery, and were, therefore, competent to say who should be free and who bond. It was suggested, farther along in the debate, that Congress might order such slaves into such States as prohibited slavery, where they could be bound out for a term of years. After a great many able speeches the House refused to strike out the forfeiture clause by a vote of sixty-three to thirty-six. When the act was called up for final passage, it was amended by inserting a clause imposing a fine of $20,000, upon all persons concerned in fitting out a vessel for the slave-trade; and likewise a fine of $5,000, and forfeiture of the vessel for taking on board any Negro or Mulatto, or any person of color, in any foreign port with the intention of selling them in the United States.  During these efforts at restriction the slave population was growing daily. The census of 1810 showed that within a decade the slave population had sprung from 893,041, in 1800, to 1,191,364,--an increase of 33 per cent. The following table exhibits this remarkable fact:    CENSUS OF 1810.--SLAVE POPULATION.    District of Columbia          5,395   Rhode Island                    108   Connecticut                     310   Pennsylvania                    795   Delaware                      4,177   New Jersey                   10,851   New York                     15,017   Louisiana                    34,660   Tennessee                    44,535   Kentucky                     80,561   Georgia                     105,218   Maryland                    111,502   North Carolina              168,824   South Carolina              196,365   Virginia                    392,518   Mississippi Territory        17,088   Indiana Territory               237   Louisiana Territory           3,011   Illinois Territory              168   Michigan Territory               24  On the 10th of December, 1817, Mississippi applied for admission into the Union with a slave constitution. The provisions relating to slavery dispensed with grand juries in the indictment of slaves, and trial by jury was allowed only in trial of capital cases.  During the session of 1817-8, Congress was besieged by a large number of memorials praying for more specific legislation against the slave-trade. During the session the old fugitive-slave act was amended so as to make it more effective, and passed by a vote of eighty-four to sixty-nine. In the Senate, with several amendments, and heated debate, it passed by a vote of seventeen to thirteen; but upon being returned to the House for concurrence, the Northern members had heard from their constituents, and the bill was tabled, and its friends were powerless to get it up.  In 1818-9, Congress passed an act offering a premium of fifty dollars to the informer of every illegally imported African seized within the United States, and twenty-five dollars for those taken at sea. The President was authorized to have such slaves removed beyond the limits of the United States, and to appoint agents on the West Coast of Africa to superintend their reception. An effort was made to punish slave-trading with death. It passed the House, but was struck out in the Senate.  On the 12th of January, 1819, the Secretary of the Navy transmitted to the Speaker of the House of Representatives copies of circular letters that had been sent to the naval officers on the various stations along the sea-coast of the slave-holding States. The following letter is a fair sample of the remainder:[1]       \"NAVY DEPARTMENT, January 22, 1811.       \"SIR:--I hear, not without great concern, that the law      prohibiting the importation of slaves has been violated in      frequent instances, near St. Mary's, since the gun-boats have      been withdrawn from that station.       \"We are bound by law, by the obligations of humanity and sound      policy, to use our most strenuous efforts to restrain this      disgraceful traffic, and to bring those who shall be found      engaged in it to those forfeitures and punishments which are by      law prescribed for such offences.       \"Hasten the equipment of the gun-boats which, by my letter of the      24th ultimo, you were directed to equip, and as soon as they      shall be ready, despatch them to St. Mary's with orders to"]]]
