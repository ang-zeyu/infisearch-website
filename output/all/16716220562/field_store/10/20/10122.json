Sir Alexander Mackenzie was one of the most energetic and successful of the discoverers who have traversed the vast wilderness of British America.  He did his work single-handed, with slender means, and slight encouragement, at a time when discovery was rare and the country almost _terra incognita_.  The long and difficult route, so recently traversed by the Red River Expedition, was, to Sir Alexander, but the small beginning of his far-reaching travels.  He traced the great river which bears his name to its outlet in the Polar Sea, and was the first to cross the Rocky Mountains in those latitudes and descend to the Pacific ocean.  Being a man of action, and not particularly enamoured of the pen, his journal [For a sight of which apply to the British Museum, London, or the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh]--full though it be of important and most interesting facts--is a bare and unadorned though valuable record of progress made, of work done, which is unsuited to juvenile minds, besides being bulky and scarce.  Having spent some years in Rupert's Land, and seen something of Red Indian and fur-trading life, I have ventured to weave the incidents of Sir Alexander's narratives into a story which, it is hoped, may prove interesting to the young--perchance, also, to the old.  I take this opportunity of acknowledging myself deeply indebted to Sir Alexander's daughter, Miss Mackenzie, and to his two sons, for kindly placing at my disposal all the information in their possession.  R.M.B.  EDINBURGH, 1872.    CHAPTER ONE.  SHOWS HOW IT BEGAN.  \"The world is round,\" said somebody in ancient times to somebody else.  \"Not at all; it is flat--flat as a pancake,\" replied somebody else to somebody; \"and if you were to travel far enough you might get to the end of it and tumble over the edge, if so disposed.\"  Ever since the commencement of this early geographical controversy, men have been labouring with more or less energy and success to ascertain the form and character of the earth; a grand, glorious labour it has been; resulting in blessings innumerable to mankind--blessings both spiritual and temporal.  We have heard some people object to geographical discovery, especially in the inclement parts of the earth, on the ground that it could be of no use, and involved great risk to life and limb.  \"Of no use!\"  Who can tell what discoveries shall be useful and what useless?  \"The works of God are great, sought out of all those that have pleasure therein,\" saith the Scripture.  There is no reference here to usefulness, but the searching out of God's works, without limitation, is authorised; and those who \"take pleasure therein,\" will be content to leave the result of their labours in the hands of Him who sent them forth.  As to \"risk,\"--why, a carpenter cannot ascend to the top of a house to put the rafters thereon without risk; a chemist cannot investigate the properties of certain fumes without risk; you cannot even eat your dinner without risk.  Only this are we sure of--that, if man had never undertaken labour except when such was _obviously_ useful and devoid of risk, the world would still be in the darkness of the Middle Ages.  Reuben Guff held these sentiments, or something like them; and Reuben was a man who had seen a great deal of life in his day, although at the time we introduce him to public notice he had not lived more than six-and-thirty summers.  He was a bronzed, stalwart Canadian.  His father had been Scotch, his mother of French extraction; and Reuben possessed the dogged resolution of the Scot with the vivacity of the Frenchman.  In regard to his tastes and occupation we shall let him speak for himself.  Sitting under a pine-tree, in the wild wilderness that lies to the north of Canada with the drumstick of a goose in one hand and a scalping-knife in the other; with a log-fire in front of him, and his son, a stripling of sixteen, by his side, he delivered himself of the following sentiments:--  \"I tell 'ee what it is, Lawrence,\" (the lad was named after the great river on the banks of which he had been reared), \"I was born to be a pioneer.  Ever since I was the height of a three-fut rule I've had a skunner at the settlements and a love for the wilderness that I couldn't overcome nohow.  Moreover, I wouldn't overcome it if I could, for it's my opinion that He who made us knows what He wants us to do, an' has given us sitch feelin's and inclinations as will lead us to do it, if we don't run mad after _notions_ of our own, as the folk in the settlements are raither apt to do.\"  Here some of the \"notions\" referred to appeared to tickle the fancy of the backwoodsman, for he paused to indulge in a quiet chuckle which wrinkled up all the lines of good-humour and fun in his rough countenance.  After applying himself for a few seconds with much energy to the drumstick,--he resumed his discourse in a slow, deliberate style of speech which was peculiar to him:--  \"Yes, Lawrence, my lad, I've made it my business ever since I was fifteen to explore this here wilderness, livin' by my gun and guidin' the fur-traders on their v'yages, or consorting with the Injins, as you know very well; and, now that we've come to the big lake it is needful to tell 'ee that I'm still bent on followin' out my callin'.  I'm goin' away to the nor'ard to explore, and you'll have to make up your mind to-night whether _you_ will be my steersman or whether I'm to lay that dooty on Swiftarrow.  I needn't say which I'd like best.\"  The hunter finished the drumstick at this point, threw the bone into the fire, lighted his pipe, and awaited his son's answer in silence.  But the son appeared to be in no hurry to reply; for, after giving his father a glance and nod, which were meant to say, \"I hear and I'll consider, but I'm too much engaged just now to speak,\" he continued his occupation of devouring venison steaks, the sauce to which was evidently hunger.  Having finished his supper and lighted his pipe he became more communicative.  \"Father,\" he said, \"you have always advised me to think well before speaking.\"  \"I have, lad; it's the natur' of our forefathers an' a very good natur' too.  I'd be sorry to see it go out of the family.\"  \"Well, then; I've thought my best about goin' with 'ee on this trip,\" returned the youth, \"an' I've resolved to go on one condition--that Swiftarrow goes with us.\"  \"Why so, my son? we don't need him.\"  \"Perhaps not, but I like him; for he has taught me all that I know of woodcraft, and I'm certain that if you and I both leave him he'll be sure to return to the new settlement at the south end of Ontario, and you know what the end of that would be.\"  \"Death by drinkin',\" replied Reuben Guff shaking his head slowly, while he watched the upward flight of a ring of white smoke that had just issued from his lips.  \"Well, I won't leave him to _that_,\" continued the youth, with sudden energy of manner and look, \"as long as my name is Lawrence.  You know that nothin' would please me more than goin' to explore the wilderness with you, father; but if Swiftarrow is to be left behind, there shall be no pioneering for me.  Besides, three are better than two on such a trip, and the Injin will be sure to keep the pot full, no matter what sort o' country we may have to pass through, for he's a dead shot wi' the gun as well as wi' the bow.\"  \"I daresay you're right, lad,\" replied Reuben, in a tone of one who muses.  \"There's room in the canoe for three, and it's not unlikely that the Injin would go south to the settlement, for he is a lonely man since his poor mother died.  I do believe that it was nothin' but his extraor'nar' love for that old 'ooman that kep' him from goin' to the dogs.  Leastwise it was that kep' him from goin' to the settlement, which is much the same thing, for Swiftarrow can't resist fire-water. Yes, lad, you're right--so we'll take him with us.  As you say, three are better than two on such a v'yage.\"  Some weeks after the foregoing conversation the pioneers arrived at the northern end of that great inland sea, Lake Superior, which, being upwards of four hundred miles long, and one hundred and seventy-five miles broad, presents many of the features of Ocean itself.  This end of the lake was, at the time we write of, and still is, an absolute wilderness, inhabited only by scattered tribes of Indians, and almost untouched by the hand of the white man, save at one spot, where the fur-traders had planted an isolated establishment.  At this point in the wild woods the representatives of the fur-traders of Canada were wont to congregate for the settlement of their affairs in the spring of every year, and from this point also trading-parties were despatched in canoes into the still more remote parts of the great northern wilderness, whence they returned with rich cargoes of furs received from the \"red men\" in exchange for powder and shot, guns, hatchets, knives, cloth, twine, fish-hooks, and such articles as were suited to the tastes and wants of a primitive and wandering people.  Here Reuben Guff and his son found Swiftarrow, as they had expected, and proposed to him that he should accompany them on their voyage north,--a proposal which he accepted with pleasure,--for the strong-boned Indian had an adventurous spirit as well as a healthy frame.  Swiftarrow was a brave and powerful Indian, and was esteemed one of the best hunters of his tribe; but no one seeing him in camp in a quiescent state would have thought him to be possessed of much energy, for he was slow and deliberate in his movements, and withal had a lazy look about his eyes.  But the sight of a bear or moose-deer had the effect of waking him up in a way that caused his dark eyes to flash and his large frame to move with cat-like activity.  When Reuben Guff discovered him on the shore of Lake Superior, he was seated at the door of his skin lodge, anointing his hair, which was long and black, with bear's grease--t"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21691"],["title","The Pioneers (#1)"],["body","\"genuine article,\" without even the admixture of a drop of scent!--so pure, in fact, that the Indian basted his steaks and anointed his hair with grease from the same box.  \"Hallo!  Swiftarrow,\" exclaimed Reuben, as he sauntered up to the savage, with his gun on his shoulder, \"ye seem to be beautifyin' yerself to-day--not goin' to get married, eh?\"  Swiftarrow, whose long hair hung over his face like a glossy curtain, tossed aside his locks and gazed earnestly at the hunter.  A slight smile and a pleasant gleam lighted up his dark countenance as he wiped his greasy right hand on his legging and extended it, exclaiming, \"watchee!\" by which he meant, what cheer?  \"What cheer? what cheer?\" replied Reuben, with a broad but quiet grin, as he shook his friend's hand heartily.  Each man understood the other's language perfectly; but each appeared to prefer to talk in his own tongue; for while Reuben addressed the red man in English, Swiftarrow replied in Indian.  This had been an understood arrangement between them ever since the time when, as lads, they had first met and formed a close friendship, on the shores of Lake Huron.  \"Is my brother's trail to be through the woods or on the waters?  Does he go hunting or trading?\" inquired the Indian, after the first salutations were over.  \"Well, I may say that I'm neither goin' a-huntin' or tradin'--here, fill yer pipe wi' baccy from my pouch; it's better than yours, I'll be bound. In a manner, too, I'm goin' both to hunt an' trade in a small way; but my main business on this trip is to be diskivery.\"  The Indian uttered a sound, which meant that he did not understand.  \"I'm goin' to sarch out new lands,\" explained Reuben, \"away to the far north.  I've heard it said by Injins that have wandered to the nor'ard that they've met in with red-skins, who said that there is a big river flowin' out o' a great lake in the direction o' the north pole, an' that it runs into the sea there.  They may be tellin' truth, or they may be tellin' lies; I dun know; anyhow, I'm koorious to know somethin' about it, so I'm goin' north to see for myself, and I've comed to ask if Swiftarrow will go with me.\"  The hunter paused, but the Indian remained silently smoking his long stone-headed pipe, or calumet, with a countenance so grave and expressionless, that no idea of his sentiments could be gathered from it.  After a brief pause, Reuben continued--  \"It won't be altogether a trip of diskivery neither, for I've got some bales of goods with me, and as we go in a small birch canoe, we'll travel light; but I hope to come back sunk to the gunwale with furs, for the red-skins of the far north are like enough to have plenty of pelts, and they won't ask much for them.  As to grub, you and I could manage to supply ourselves wi' lots o' that anywheres, and I've got plenty of powder and lead.  Moreover, my boy Lawrence is goin' with me.\"  During the foregoing remarks, the Indian's countenance betrayed no sign of feeling until the name of Lawrence was mentioned, when a gleam of satisfaction shot from his eyes.  Removing the pipe from his lips, he puffed a volume of smoke through his nostrils, and said:--  \"Swiftarrow will go.\"  Backwoodsmen seldom take long to mature their plans, and are generally prompt to carry them into execution.  Two days after the brief conversation above narrated, the three friends pushed off in their little birch-bark canoe and paddled up the stream which leads to the Kakabeka Falls on the Kamenistaquoia River.  Surmounting this obstacle by the simple process of carrying the canoe and her lading past the falls by land, and relaunching on the still water above, they continued their voyage day by day, encamping under the trees by night, until they had penetrated far and deep into the heart of the northern wilderness, and had even passed beyond the most distant establishments of the adventurous fur-traders.  The world of forest, swamp, lake, and river, that still, however, lay between them and the land which they sought to reach, was very wide. Weeks, and even months, would certainly elapse before they could hope to approach it; one day, therefore, they buried their goods and stores in a convenient place, intending to dig them up on their return, and meanwhile turned aside into a country which promised to afford them a good supply of fresh provisions for the voyage north.  Here an adventure befell them which brought their voyage of discovery, at that time, to an abrupt close.    CHAPTER TWO.  TERRIBLE DISCOVERIES AND ALTERED PLANS.  \"Ho!\" ejaculated Swiftarrow.  \"Smoke!\" exclaimed Reuben Guff.  Both men spoke at the same moment,--their discovery having been simultaneous.  At the same time Lawrence pointed with the blade of his paddle to a thin line of smoke which rose above the tree-tops into the blue sky, and was faithfully mirrored in the lake on which they floated.  \"Injins!\" said Reuben, resting his steering paddle across the canoe for a few seconds.  Swiftarrow assented with another \"Ho,\" and Lawrence moved his gun into a handy position to be ready for an emergency; but there was no other sign of man's presence than the wreath of smoke.  All was perfectly silent. The air too was quite still, and the surface of the lake resembled a sheet of glass.  \"Strange,\" observed Reuben, \"red-skins ain't usually so shy.  If they mean mischief they don't ever let smoke be seen, an' when they don't mean mischief they generally show themselves.  Come, push on, lads; we'll go see what's i' the wind.\"  \"I'll show them the muzzle, father,\" said Lawrence, laying down his paddle and taking up his gun: \"it may be well to let 'em see that we have arms.\"  \"No need for that, boy.  If they know anything at all, they know that white men don't go about in the wilderness empty-handed.  Put down the piece, and use your paddle.\"  Thus reproved, Lawrence flushed slightly, but obeyed the order and resumed paddling.  In a few minutes they were on shore.  Still all was silent as the grave. Hauling the bow of the canoe on the beach to keep it fast, the three men took their weapons, and, entering the woods in single file, walked cautiously but swiftly in the direction of the smoke.  They soon reached the spot, and the scene which met their eyes was one which, while it accounted for the silence that reigned around, filled their minds with sadness and horror.  In an open space, where a number of trees had been cut down, stood about a dozen skin tents or Indian lodges, some with the curtain-doors closed, others open, exposing the interiors, on the floors of which the dead bodies of Indian men, women, and children, lay in every attitude and in all stages of decomposition.  Outside of the tents other corpses lay strewn on the ground, and most of these bore evidence of having been more or less torn by wolves.  The travellers knew at a glance that these unfortunate people had fallen before that terrible disease, small-pox, which had recently attacked and almost depopulated several districts of the Indian country.  How the disease was introduced among the Indians at the time of which we write, it is impossible to say and useless to conjecture.  The fact of its desolating effects is unquestionable.  One who dwelt in the country at the time writes: [See Sir Alexander Mackenzie's _Voyages_, page 14.] \"The fatal infection spread around with a baneful rapidity which no flight could escape, and with a fatal effect that nothing could resist. It destroyed with its pestilential breath whole families and tribes; and the horrid scene presented, to those who had the melancholy opportunity of beholding it, a combination of the dead, the dying, and such as, to avoid the fate of their friends around them, prepared to disappoint the plague of its prey by terminating their own existence.  To aggravate the picture, if aggravation were possible, the carcases were dragged forth from the huts by the wolves, or were mangled within them by the dogs, which thus sought to satisfy their hunger with the putrid remains of their masters.  It was not uncommon at this time for the father of a family, whom the infection had not reached, to call his household around him, represent the terrible sufferings and fate that awaited them, which he believed was owing to the influence of an evil spirit who desired to extirpate the race, and incited them to baffle death with all its horrors by at once killing themselves--at the same time offering to perform the deed of mercy with his own hand if their hearts should fail them.\"  That some of the dead before our pioneers had acted in this way was evident, for while most of the corpses bore marks of having been smitten with the disease, others were there which showed nothing to account for death save a knife wound over the region of the heart.  It was a sad and sickening sight, and drew forth one or two low-toned sorrowful remarks from Reuben, as he moved slowly towards the tent from which smoke still issued.  The three men paused before it because a sound came from within, and they felt reluctant to disturb the awful silence.  The pause, however, was but momentary.  Reuben lifted the covering and opened it wide.  A small fire still burned on the hearth in the centre of the lodge; around it lay the bodies of dead men, women, and children.  Only one figure, that of an old woman, remained in a half-reclining position, but she was motionless, and they thought her dead also.  This, however, was not the case.  The flood of light which streamed in on her appeared to rouse her, for she raised her grey head, and, gazing anxiously at the figures which darkened the entrance of the lodge, asked in a tremulous voice: \"Is that you, my son?\"  \"No, mother, but it is a friend,\" said Swiftarrow, who understood her language.  \"A friend,\" repeated the old woman, shaking her head slowly, \"I don't want a friend.  The Master of Life is my friend.  My people said that an evil spirit was slaying them; but I know better.  It was the"]]]
