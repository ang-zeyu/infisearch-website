He was such a tiny, frail, spotted thing that he seemed too delicate for a life of adventure on the wooded ridges and in the tangled swamps under the shadow of Blue Mountain.  \"Bless me!\" cried the good lady. \"This child's not much taller than an overgrown beet top and he can't be any heavier than one of Farmer Green's prize cabbages. And his legs--\" she exclaimed--\"his legs are no thicker than pea pods.... They'll be ready to eat in another month,\" she added, meaning _not_ her child's legs, as you might have supposed, but Farmer Green's early June peas. For Nimble's mother was very fond of certain vegetables that did not grow wild in the woods.  Of course young Nimble did not know what she was talking about. He had a great deal to learn. And he would have to wait until he was a good deal bigger before his mother took him on an excursion, by night, across the fields to Farmer Green's garden patch.  All at once Nimble leaped quickly upon his slightly wobbly legs. He trembled and gazed up at his mother with a look of fear in his great eyes. At the same time his mother, too, lifted her head and listened for a few moments. \"Don't be afraid!\" she said then, to Nimble. \"That's old Spot--Farmer Green's dog--barking. But he's down near the barns, so we don't need to worry.\"  That was the first time Nimble had ever heard a dog's voice. Yet no one needed to tell him that it wasn't a pleasant sound.  Even his mother couldn't help feeling that she had better put a wide stretch of rough country between her new youngster and old Spot's home. So in a little while she led the way slowly along the pine grown ridge which bent around a shoulder of the mountain. She was headed for the spring which marked the beginning of Broad Brook.  Her little spotted fawn, Nimble, kept close beside her. Slowly as his mother moved, he found the traveling none too easy. And he was glad when she stopped in a pocket-like clearing. There she spoke to a proud speckled bird who was sitting on a log and amusing himself by spreading his tail feathers into a beautiful fan.  \"Good morning, Mr. Grouse!\" said Nimble's mother.  \"Good morning, madam!\" replied the gentleman with the fan. \"What a handsome child you have! There's nothing quite like spots--or speckles--to add to a person's looks.\"  \"They _are_ pretty,\" Nimble's mother agreed with a happy glance at her son.  \"I can't say he favors his mother,\" Mr. Grouse remarked.  \"Oh, I had spots enough when I was young,\" she explained. \"You see, all our family lose our spots as we grow up.\"  \"I'm glad to say,\" Mr. Grouse said with a flirt of his tail, \"that all our family keep their spots, every one of them.\"  \"We get to be so swift-footed that we don't need spots,\" said Nimble's mother.  That speech seemed to displease Mr. Grouse.  \"I hope,\" he cried, \"you don't mean to say that we Grouse aren't swift!\"  \"No, indeed!\" Nimble's mother answered hastily.  \"I should hope _not_!\" was Mr. Grouse's response to that. \"For everybody knows that we go up like rockets at the slightest sign of danger.\"  \"Exactly!\" said Nimble's mother. \"You are so swift that you don't really need those spots to help conceal yourself, once you're grown up.\"  \"They're handy to have, all the same,\" he told her. \"And as for this youngster of yours, you needn't worry much about him. He'll be safe enough in the woods. He looks just like a patch of sunlight that has fallen through a tree top upon a leaf-strewn bank.\"  Nimble's mother was pleased to hear that.  \"Yes!\" said Mr. Grouse cheerfully. \"He'll be safe enough--except for the Foxes.\"  And that remark didn't please Nimble's mother at all.     II  LEARNING THINGS   Nimble's mother hadn't liked Mr. Grouse's remark about Foxes. Somehow she couldn't put Foxes out of her mind. And not once did she mean to let Nimble wander out of her sight.  At first, when he was only a tiny chap, it was easy for her to keep her young son near her. But Nimble grew a little livelier with each day that passed. And it wasn't long before he began to annoy his mother and worry her, too. For he soon fell into the habit of dodging behind something or other, such as a baby pine tree or a clump of blackberry bushes, when his mother wasn't looking. Every time she missed her spotted fawn the poor lady was sure a Fox had snatched him up and dragged him away. And when she found Nimble again she was so glad that she hadn't the heart to punish him.  However, one day she talked to him quite severely.  \"Do you want a Fox to catch--and eat--you?\" she asked him.  \"No, Mother!... Has a Fox ever eaten you?\"  \"Certainly not!\" Nimble's mother answered.  \"Do you expect to be caught by a Fox?\"  \"No, indeed!\" said his mother.  \"Then there can't be any great danger,\" Nimble remarked lightly.  \"Ah! There's always danger of Foxes so long as you're a little fawn,\" she explained. \"When you're grown up--or even half grown--no Fox would dare touch you. But if you wandered away alone at your tender age and you met a Fox----\" Well, the poor lady was so upset by the mere thought of what might happen that she couldn't say anything more just then.  But her son Nimble was not upset.  \"If I met a Fox,\" he declared bravely, \"I'd be safe enough. I'd stand perfectly still. And he wouldn't be able to see me, on account of my spots.\"  \"Ah! But if the wind happened to be blowing his way he'd be sure to smell you,\" cried Nimble's mother. \"And he would find you. And he would jump at you.\"  \"I'd run away from him then,\" said Nimble stoutly.  His mother shook her head.  \"You're spry for your age. But you're too slow to escape a Fox. You're not quick enough for that yet. You don't know how quick Foxes are. So look out! Look out for a sly fellow with a pointed nose and a bushy tail!\"  In spite of all these warnings Nimble didn't feel the least bit alarmed. And the older he grew the less he heeded his mother's words. He thought she was too careful. She seemed always to be on the watch for some danger. She was forever stopping to look back, lest somebody or something might be following her. Whenever she picked out a good resting place behind a clump of evergreens, out of the wind, she never lay down without first retracing her steps for a little way and peering all around. Then, of course, she had to walk back again before she sank down on the bed of her choosing. It all seemed very silly to young Nimble.  \"What's the use,\" he finally asked her one day, \"what's the use of fussing so much over your back tracks?\"  \"You should always know what's behind you,\" said his mother. \"Besides, I can't rest well if I'm uneasy.\"  \"Do you feel easy now?\" he inquired, for she had just then lain down after giving her back tracks her usual attention.  \"Quite!\" said Nimble's mother, as she closed her eyes and heaved a deep sigh of contentment.  Her answer pleased Nimble. He smiled faintly as he watched her closely. And he chuckled when his mother's head nodded three times and then sank lower and lower.  Presently Nimble rose to his feet, without making the slightest rustle. And very carefully he stole away.     III  AN INTERRUPTED NAP   Nimble, the fawn, stole away into the woods while his mother was sleeping. And when he went he took great pains not to disturb her. He was careful not to step on a single twig. For young as he was, he knew that the sound of a breaking twig was enough to rouse his mother instantly "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21619"],["title","The Tale of Nimble Deer (#1)"],["body","of the deepest sleep. And he made sure that he didn't set his little feet on any stones. For he knew that at the merest click of a hoof his mother would bound up and discover that he had left her.  So Nimble trod only upon the soft carpet of pine needles and made not the slightest noise. Meanwhile his mother slept peacefully on--or as peacefully as anybody can who is a light sleeper and keeps one ear always cocked to catch every stir in the forest.  She never missed her son at all until she found herself suddenly wide awake and on her feet, ready to run. Not seeing Nimble beside her, for a moment or two she forgot she had a child. Her only thought was to flee from the creature that was crashing through the underbrush beyond the old stone wall and drawing nearer to her every instant.  It was a wonder that she didn't dash off then and there. Indeed she took one leap before she remembered who she was and that she had a youngster named Nimble.  Then, of course, she stopped short and looked wildly around. But she saw no little spotted fawn anywhere.  She had been startled enough, before, roused as she was out of a sound sleep. And now she was terribly frightened.  \"Nimble!\" she called. \"Where are you?\"  \"Here I am!\" Nimble answered. Even as he spoke he burst into sight, leaping the stone wall in such a way that his mother couldn't help feeling proud of him.  \"What's the matter?\" she cried. \"Who's chasing you?\"  \"Nobody's chasing me,\" Nimble told her. \"When I saw the Fox I hurried back here.\"  \"The Fox!\" his mother exclaimed. \"Well, he won't dare touch you while I am with you.\" She began to breathe easily again. If it was only a Fox she certainly didn't intend to run. \"Where did you see the Fox?\" she demanded.  \"He was right over my head,\" Nimble said.  \"My goodness!\" his mother gasped. \"That was dangerous. Was he on a bank above you?\"  \"He was in a tree,\" Nimble replied.  His mother gave him a queer look.  \"What's that?\" she asked him sharply. \"In a tree? What did he look like? Was he red?\"  \"He was grayish and he had black rings around his long bushy tail; and his long pointed nose stuck out from under a black mask.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Nimble's mother. \"You didn't see a Fox. You saw a Coon!\"  Nimble was puzzled.  \"You told me once,\" he reminded his mother, \"that a Fox was a sly fellow with a bushy tail and a long pointed nose. And this person in the tree had----\"  \"Yes! Yes!\" said his mother. \"Now listen to what I say: A Fox is red. And his tail has no rings at all. And Foxes don't climb trees.\"  \"Yes, Mother!\" was Nimble's meek answer.  He was glad to learn all that. And he was glad, too, that his mother hadn't asked him how he happened to stray off alone into the woods.     IV  PLANNING A PICNIC   While he was only a fawn Nimble became very fond of water lilies. But he didn't carry them as a bouquet, nor wear one in his buttonhole. He was fond of lilies in a different way: he liked to eat them, and their flat, round, glossy pads. At night his mother often led him to the edge of the lake on the other side of Blue Mountain and there they feasted.  It was wonderful to stand in the cool water, not too far from the shore, with the moonlight shimmering on the ruffled lake, and breathe in the sweet scent of the lilies while nibbling at their pads.  \"There's nothing,\" said Nimble to his mother one night, \"nothing so good to eat as water lilies.\"  His mother said, \"Humph! Wait till you've tasted carrots!\"  \"Carrots!\" Nimble echoed. \"What are carrots and where can I find some? Do they grow in this lake?\"  \"Carrots,\" his mother explained, \"are vegetables and they grow in Farmer Green's garden.\"  When he heard that, Nimble wanted to start for Farmer Green's place at once. But his mother said, \"No!\" And he soon saw that she meant it, too.  However, the word _carrots_ was in his mouth a good deal of the time, for days and nights afterward. But Nimble wasn't satisfied with having only the _word_ in his mouth. There was no taste to that at all. Nor could he chew it, nor swallow it. He was wild to bite into a carrot and see if it actually was more toothsome than a water lily. Again and again he said to his mother, \"Can't we go down to Farmer Green's garden patch to-night? If we wait much longer somebody else will eat all the carrots before we get a taste of them.\" Or maybe he would exclaim, \"Let's have some carrots for supper! Please!\"  It was no wonder that Nimble's mother grew very tired of his teasing. At last she said to him, when he was urging her to take him down the hill and across the meadow to Farmer Green's vegetable garden, \"There's no sense in our going down there now. The carrots aren't big enough yet. They aren't ready to eat. But later, if you show you're trustworthy, and if you mind well, and if you grow enough, and if you can start quickly and run fast, perhaps I'll see that you have your first meal of carrots. Now, don't bother me any more!\"  Well, there were so many _ifs_ in his mother's promise that Nimble almost gave up hope of ever getting to Farmer Green's garden patch. He didn't quite dare expect that his mother would take him there with her. But he made up his mind that if she didn't he would go on a carrot hunt alone as soon as he could.  At the same time he practiced minding his mother, which was not always a pleasant thing to do. And he practiced starting and running, both of which were a good deal of fun. As for growing, Nimble did not need to practice that at all; for he was getting heavier and taller every day, without doing anything more than to eat and to sleep and to have the best time possible.  Meanwhile he told everybody he met that if all went well he would be eating carrots some day. And when his friends learned that he planned to go on an excursion to Farmer Green's garden patch there wasn't one of them that didn't say he would like to go too.  Jimmy Rabbit said he really ought to have a look at the cabbages. And if Nimble didn't mind he thought it would be pleasant to join the party. Patty Coon remarked that there were certain matters connected with corn which he must attend to, and if there was no objection he would go along with the rest, when the time came for the excursion. Even Cuffy Bear, who almost never went near the farm buildings, declared that there was nothing he would enjoy more than to make the trip with Nimble and his mother. He had once tasted baked beans. And ever since that occasion he had meant to see if he couldn't find some around Farmer Green's house.  Of course it would have been awkward to say no. So Nimble said yes to everybody. He even promised that he would let all his friends know when the excursion should take place.  But of all these things he said not a word to his mother. He was not sure that they would please her. In fact he was sure that they wouldn't.     V  NIMBLE'S MISTAKE   One morning Nimble's mother said to him, \"To-night, just as the moon rises, we'll start for Farmer Green's garden patch.\"  He knew what that meant. It meant that he was going to know, at last, what carrots tasted like. And he was delighted.  \"You've improved fast,\" his mother told him. \"You've grown a good deal. You start to run much more quickly than you did a month ago; and you're quite speedy now. I must say that you don't mind me any too well. Take care that to-night you do exactly as you're ordered!\"  Nimble promised. \"I'll be good,\" he said. \"No matter how many carrots you want me to eat, I'll finish every one.\"  \"No matter if you haven't had a chance to eat a single carrot, if I tell you to run you must obey instantly,\" his mother warned him. \"Two seconds' delay might be fatal,\" she added solemnly. \"If we hear a twig snap you mustn't stop to look nor listen.\"  \"Yes!\" said Nimble. But ten minutes later he couldn't have repeated a word that his mother said--except that they were going to start for the garden when the moon rose. That much he told Jimmy Rabbit when he met him in the woods a little while afterward. And Jimmy Rabbit agreed to get the news, somehow, to Fatty Coon and Cuffy Bear.  He was as good as his promise--even better. For Jimmy told everybody he met that day. He explained about the excursion to the garden patch and said that every one must be ready to start just as the moon peeped over the rim of the world, for Nimble Deer's mother wouldn't wait for anybody that wasn't on hand.  Nimble found that day a long one. He was so eager to get a carrot between his lips that he thought night would never come. But darkness fell at last. And some hours later his mother said to him, \"Are you ready?\"  He was. So together they passed silently along the old runway which led, as his mother knew, to the pasture fence. The woods were inky black, for the moon had not yet risen. But Nimble's mother remarked that she thought they would see it when they reached the open hillside.  Just before they came to the fence somebody spoke. Nimble's mother jumped when somebody cried, \"Good evening!\" But she knew at once that it was only Jimmy Rabbit.  \"I see you're on time,\" he said. \"I haven't been waiting long.\"  \"Waiting?\" Nimble's mother exclaimed. \"Waiting for what?\"  \"For you!\" he answered. \"I heard you were going down to the garden patch to-night; and I'm to be one of the party.\"  The good lady thought it queer. How did Jimmy Rabbit happen to have heard of the excursion? She couldn't imagine. But he was a harmless little fellow. Really she didn't mind having him go with her.  \"Very well!\" she told him. \"But remember: You must be quiet!\" And she was just about to walk up to the fence when she gave a searching look all around. \"Bless me!\" she muttered. \"I never saw so many eyes in all my life. Who are all these people?\"  It was no wonder she asked that question. For no matter where she turned, pairs of eyes burned in the darkness.  Strangely enough, nobody answered. Jimmy Rabbit didn't say a word. And as for Nimble, he didn't seem to hear--nor understand--anything his mother said.  "]]]
