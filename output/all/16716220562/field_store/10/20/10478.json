And he didn't want his nose bitten. So he kept quiet after that. But he hoped that Peter would take his advice.  \"Let's go down to the brook and fish,\" he suggested, hoping that he could get Peter's mind off Tommy Fox.  \"You can go if you want to,\" said Peter Mink. \"And save me some fish, too, or it will be the worse for you!\"  Slim decided that he wouldn't go fishing, after all. And he roamed through the woods with Peter, who was determined to find Tommy Fox.  And at last Peter found him, at a garden-party that was being given by Jimmy Rabbit, in Farmer Green's garden.  Everybody but Tommy Fox was having refreshments. But he said he didn't feel like eating anything. That was because he was polite. He never cared for lettuce, or peas, or cabbage.  Peter Mink had not been invited to the garden-party. But that made no difference to him. Before anyone knew what was happening he marched straight up to Tommy Fox and bit him on the nose.  Then there followed such an uproar as had never before been seen in Farmer Green's garden. Tommy Fox and Peter Mink rolled over and over upon the ground. And for a long time nobody could tell one from the other.  But after a while that squirming heap of tails and legs began to turn more slowly, until at last it stopped altogether.  Peter Mink was a sad sight. He had been ragged enough, before the fight. But now he looked ten times worse. And one of his eyes was closed. And he had lost his hat, and one shoe.  Everyone was glad that the trouble was over. And everyone was glad that Tommy Fox had won.  And to everybody's surprise, the gladdest of all was Slim Mink, Peter's cousin.  \"Hurrah!\" he cried. (The others had been too polite to say anything.)  \"What makes you shout that?\" Peter asked Slim as he crawled away.  \"Why,\" his cousin answered, \"Tommy Fox hurt you, instead of your hurting him. And now you won't have to go to the Reform School.\"  But for once Peter Mink thought there might be worse places than that. He thought that maybe a real bed would feel pretty comfortable, just then.     HELPING JIMMY RABBIT   Peter Mink was feeling even more peevish than usual. And this was the reason: Jimmy Rabbit had a new sled.  Now, Peter had never owned a sled; and it made him envious to see what a good time Jimmy was having, coasting down the side of Blue Mountain.  There was only one thing that Jimmy Rabbit did not like about his sled. It went so fast that he always fell off long before he reached the end of the slide.  \"I can fix that,\" Peter Mink told him. \"You go home and borrow your father's hammer and a few nails, and I'll show you how you can coast 'way down into Pleasant Valley without once tumbling off.\"  Jimmy thanked him. And he hurried home at once. He dragged his new sled after him, too; for he was afraid that if he left it behind he might not be able to find Peter Mink--or the sled, either--when he came back again.  But Peter did not seem to care. Perhaps he had something on his mind. Anyhow, when Jimmy Rabbit returned with the hammer and nails, Peter Mink was waiting patiently for him.  \"Now, then,\" said Peter, as he took the nails and the hammer, \"you sit on the sled, Jimmy, and I'll fix you up in no time.\"  So Jimmy Rabbit sat down on his new sled. And in a few minutes Peter Mink had nailed Jimmy's trousers fast to the sled.  \"Now you simply _can't_ fall off,\" Peter said. \"I'll give you a push; and the first thing you know, you'll be down in the valley.\"  Jimmy Rabbit said to himself that Peter Mink was very bright, to think of such a splendid plan as nailing his trousers to the sled. He thanked Peter; and he gripped the sled tightly--though he didn't need to--while Peter gave him a push that sent him flying down the mountainside.  Though he went like the wind, he never fell off once. And soon he was down in Pleasant Valley, skimming over the crust which covered the drifts in Farmer Green's meadow.  At last the sled stopped. And then Jimmy Rabbit decided that Peter Mink had forgotten something. How was he to get off the sled with his trousers nailed fast to it? And what would his mother say, when she saw the nail-holes in his trousers? And what would his father do, when _he_ saw the nails in Jimmy's new sled?  It was not very pleasant for Jimmy Rabbit, sitting all alone in the meadow, with such thoughts running through his head.  After he had sat there a while Jimmy heard something that worried him even more. He heard old dog Spot barking. And he saw that he would be in a good deal of a fix if Spot should happen to come along and find him. For he couldn't stir from his sled.  Jimmy began to hate that sled. He wished he had never seen it.... And then he heard somebody scampering over the crust. He was almost too frightened to look around to see who it was. But he turned his head. And he was glad to find that it was Peter Mink, who had run all the way down from Blue Mountain.  \"You had a fine ride, didn't you?\" said Peter Mink.  \"Yes,\" Jimmy answered. \"But I liked the beginning of it better than the end.\"  \"Why, what's the matter?\" Peter inquired.  \"I can't get off the sled,\" Jimmy said.  Peter Mink pretended to be surprised. And he said that he hadn't thought of that.  \"But I'll help you,\" he promised.  Jimmy Rabbit thanked him.  \"But,\" said Peter Mink, \"I can't do all these things for you for nothing, of course. I have too much else to do, to be wasting my time like this, without pay.\"  \"What do you want?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked him.  \"Give me the sled,\" said Peter Mink, \"and I'll help you to get off it.\"  \"All right,\" Jimmy agreed. He would even have given Peter his wheelbarrow, too, he was so anxious to be freed from his seat. \"I think, though, that you might pull me up the mountain,\" Jimmy added. \"I don't feel like walking.\" And that was quite true, because he had been so frightened, when he heard old Spot barking, that his legs were still shaking.  \"Well,\" said Peter Mink, \"I'm pretty particular who rides on my sled. But I'll pull you up the mountain, because I'm going that way myself, to slide.\"  And he started off, dragging Jimmy Rabbit behind him.  [Illustration]     WHAT COULD PETER DO?   Peter Mink was pulling Jimmy Rabbit up the mountainside. You remember that Jimmy had a new sled, and that Peter had nailed Jimmy's trousers to the sled, so he wouldn't fall off when he slid down Blue Mountain. But when Jimmy had coasted down into the meadow he found he could not get off the sled. So Peter Mink had offered to help him, if Jimmy would give him the sled in return for his kindness.  \"How do you like my new sled?\" Peter Mink asked Jimmy Rabbit, as he stopped to rest, after climbing a steep slope.  But before Jimmy Rabbit could answer, an alarming sound rang through the clear air and startled them both. It was old dog Spot, baying as if he had found some very interesting tracks.  \"Hurry!\" Jimmy Rabbit cried. \"We don't want Spot to catch us!\"  \"Get off my sled!\" Peter Mink ordered. \"How can I run fast, pulling a great, fat fellow like you?\"  \"How can I get off,\" Jimmy answered, \"when I'm nailed fast to the sled?\"  \"I'll get you off,\" said Peter. And he took hold of Jimmy Rabbit's ears and began to pull as hard as he could. But the sled only slipped along on the snow.  \"Grab this sapling!\" Peter Mink cried, drawing Jimmy close to a small tree. \"And I'll pull the sled from under you.\" But all his pulling did no more than to make Jimmy's arms ache. For Jimmy was nailed so fast to the sled that he stuck to it--or _it_ stuck to _him_--as if they were just one, instead of two, things.  \"I wish my mother hadn't made me wear such stout trousers,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. For once, he wished he wore old, ragged clothes, like Peter's. If he had, he thought he might have torn himself away from the sled. But now there seemed no hope for him, because old Spot's voice sounded nearer every minute.  At last Peter Mink became so angry because Jimmy didn't get off the sled that he flew at him and began to pommel him.  When Peter threw himself upon Jimmy the sled began to move. But Peter was so enraged he never noticed that, until they were coasting down the mountain so fast that he didn't dare jump off.  Once they struck something. They couldn't see what it was, because they were traveling like the wind. But Jimmy Rabbit thought he heard a frightened sort of yelp. Then they tore on again.  Before they reached the foot of Blue Mountain they struck something else. This time there was no yelp, for they ran right into a big maple tree. And Jimmy Rabbit felt himself sailing through the air, until at last he landed on top of a big drift, broke through the crust, and sank into the soft snow beneath.  He crawled quickly out of the drift. And when he saw that he and the sled had parted company he was so delighted that he never minded his torn trousers.  He looked around. And there was the sled, as good as ever, except for the nails Peter Mink had driven into it. And there was Peter Mink, lying very still beneath the maple tree. Though Jimmy listened, he could no longer hear old Spot baying.  [Illustration: JIMMY WENT SAILING THROUGH THE AIR]  That was because old Spot was running home as fast as his legs would carry him. He didn't know what it was that had struck him; and he was frightened.  When Jimmy Rabbit saw Peter Mink slowly open one eye he knew that it wouldn't be long before Peter was himself again. So Jimmy hurried back up the mountain, pulling the sled after him.  The next day, who should come to Jimmy's house but Peter Mink.  \"I've come for my sled,\" he said.  \"What sled?\" asked Jimmy Rabbit.  \"Why, the one you gave me for getting you off it,\" Peter answered.  \"But _you_ didn't get me off the sled,\" Jimmy told him. \"You don't even know how I got off. So I certainly am not going to give you my sled.\"  And Peter Mink had to go away empty-hand"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21845"],["title","The Tale of Peter Mink (#4)"],["body","ed. He didn't like it at all. But what could he do?     THE CIRCUS PARADE   If it hadn't been for the circus posters on Farmer Green's barn, the idea of having a circus parade would never have occurred to Jimmy Rabbit.  You see, all those wonderful pictures set him thinking. And he lost no time in inviting everybody to help. He even invited Peter Mink, though he was sorry, afterwards, that he had.  For a day or two everybody in the neighborhood of Blue Mountain was as busy as he could be, getting ready for the parade. Cuffy Bear had promised to be the elephant, because he was so big. Frisky Squirrel was to be a wolf, on account of his being so gray. And Jimmy had invited Peter Mink to march as a giraffe, for the reason that he had such a long neck. And as for Jimmy Rabbit himself, he said that he expected to be a little pitcher, because he had heard that they had big ears.  \"I've heard that, too,\" remarked Billy Woodchuck. \"But I never knew that a pitcher was an animal.\"  \"Well, you see you have a good deal to learn,\" Jimmy Rabbit said.  Then Tommy Fox murmured something about having heard that little pitchers had big mouths, too, and that they always talked a good deal. But Jimmy Rabbit made believe he didn't hear him.  Everything would have been pleasant, on the day of the parade, if it hadn't been for Peter Mink. He insisted that he must lead the procession; and that made trouble at once, because Jimmy Rabbit had expected to do that.  Peter finally settled the dispute.  \"A parade,\" he said, \"has two ends. Of course, one person can't march at both ends at the same time. So while I march at the front end, Jimmy Rabbit can march at the other. And that's perfectly fair.\"  At first Jimmy Rabbit looked quite glum. But pretty soon he seemed to feel more cheerful; and he said, \"All right!\"  Then there was a great bustle, and much talking, as the parade prepared to start.  \"Remember!\" Peter Mink warned everybody, \"you must follow everywhere I go, because I'm the leader.\"  At that, Cuffy Bear seemed somewhat worried. He knew that Peter Mink was fond of squeezing through narrow places; and he didn't see how he could follow him.  But after a while Cuffy began to smile again--right after Jimmy Rabbit had come and whispered something in his ear. You see, Jimmy went to everybody in the parade and whispered. And last of all he went to Peter Mink and whispered in his ear, too.  \"Everybody must look straight ahead,\" Jimmy told Peter, \"because that's the way they always do in a circus parade.\"  \"Don't you suppose I know that, just as well as you do?\" snapped Peter Mink. \"You'd better hurry back to the other end of the parade, because I'm going to start in exactly two or three minutes--I'm not sure which.\"  So Jimmy Rabbit hurried back as fast as he could. He might have run faster, if he hadn't stopped to wink at every person in the line. But he just managed to reach his place when the parade started.  Then a queer thing happened. When everybody had taken ten steps, the whole parade turned about in its tracks and started marching in the opposite direction. And now Jimmy Rabbit led the procession, instead of Peter Mink.  I said the _whole_ parade turned around; but what I meant to say was _everybody but Peter Mink_. You see, Jimmy Rabbit had told Peter not to look back, but to march straight ahead, with his eyes to the front. And naturally, Peter Mink supposed that that was what Jimmy had whispered to everyone else.  So away Peter Mink marched, trying to look as much like a giraffe as he could, and feeling very proud, too--because he thought the parade was following him.  [Illustration]     PETER LEARNS A NEW WORD   While Peter Mink marched on, believing that the circus parade was following him (when Jimmy Rabbit had actually led it away in the opposite direction), Peter kept trying to think of some trick he could play on the parade.  He decided, at last, that he would hunt around until he found the smallest hole he could possibly squeeze through, and he would squirm through it, and then have fun watching the others try to follow him.  Finally he found a log which lay upon a rocky ledge. Between the log and the rock there was a narrow opening. And when he saw that, Peter knew it was the very place he had been looking for. Without once glancing around, he thrust his head through the crack.  Then something happened. Peter Mink always claimed, afterwards, that the log settled a bit lower, or the rock rose a bit higher. Anyhow, to his astonishment, he found himself stuck fast under the log. Such a thing had never happened to him before.  \"Well!\" he said to himself, \"there are plenty of people here to help me, anyhow.\" You see, he hadn't discovered that the whole parade--except him--had turned about and followed Jimmy Rabbit.  Peter Mink thought it was strange that nobody came and offered to help him. And soon he began to shout.  Still no one came. And Peter began to wish that he hadn't tried to play a trick on the paraders. For he saw that he was in something very like a trap. In fact, it _was_ a trap, which Johnnie Green had set. But Peter didn't know that. If he had, he would have been even more worried than he was. It was bad enough, just to imagine what would happen if old dog Spot should come along and find him.         *       *       *       *       *  Jimmy Rabbit had a fine time leading the parade. You may be sure _he_ looked around at the procession following him. And he shouted a good many orders, too, telling different ones just what they should or shouldn't do.  The parade had marched through the woods for a long time; and Jimmy was about to stop and tell everybody that the fun was over, when he saw all at once that it was really just going to begin. For right in front of him he saw his friend. Peter Mink, pinned fast beneath the log.  \"You've been long enough coming to help me!\" Peter Mink growled. \"Get this log off me--you people--and be quick about it!\"  Brownie Beaver left his place in the parade and hurried forward, because he knew more about handling logs than anybody else there. But before he could get his coat off, Jimmy Rabbit called him one side and whispered to him. And then Jimmy whispered to everybody else. And the parade disbanded. Then everybody crowded around Peter Mink.  \"What is it you want?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked Peter.  \"Want?\" Peter Mink screamed. \"Are you blind? Can't you see this great log on top of me? Can't you get it off? What are you waiting for?\"  \"Ah!\" said Jimmy Rabbit. \"We are waiting for just one thing. And we haven't heard it yet.\"  \"Heard it?\" Peter Mink snarled. \"Aren't your ears big enough to hear everything?\"  \"We're going to teach you something,\" said Jimmy. \"And until you've learned the lesson, we're going to leave you right where you are.\"  You should have heard Peter Mink then--or rather, you're lucky you _didn't_ hear him. For the way he went on was something dreadful. But until Jimmy Rabbit heard what he was waiting for, he wouldn't let anyone roll the log off Peter.  Finally it grew so late that some of the paraders said they would have to be going home pretty soon. And then Billy Woodchuck remarked that he didn't believe Peter Mink had the least idea what they were waiting for.  \"I think we ought to tell him,\" Billy said.  So Jimmy Rabbit told Peter what it was.  \"I don't know what it means,\" said Peter.  \"Well--say it, anyhow!\" Jimmy Rabbit ordered. \"And after this, whenever you want anybody to do anything for you, don't forget to say it! It wouldn't do you a bit of harm to practice saying it every day, for a while, until you get used to it.\"  Peter Mink looked as if he would have liked to do something to Jimmy Rabbit. And for a long time he refused to obey. But when Brownie Beaver said that he simply _must_ go home, because it was so late, Peter Mink said what Jimmy had been waiting for.  It was \"Please!\"  And no doubt you guessed it long ago.     GOOD NEWS ABOUT PETER   \"Yes! They say he has at last decided to go to work,\" Mrs. Rabbit was saying to Billy Woodchuck's mother.  \"It's the best news I've heard in a long while,\" Mrs. Woodchuck remarked. \"And I hope he'll be so busy that he won't have time to come around here and get our sons into any more mischief.\"  \"Have you learned what his work is going to be?\" Mrs. Rabbit inquired.  But Mrs. Woodchuck said she didn't know that. She only knew that Peter Mink was going to turn over a new leaf and do some sort of honest work.  Now, Peter Mink had a plan. And he hadn't told any one exactly what it was.  The Grouse boys and the Woodchuck brothers gave a concert that very night. You see, Mr. Fox had taught them to make music like a fife-and-drum corps--the Grouse boys drummed and the Woodchuck brothers whistled. And whenever they gave a concert, almost everybody went to it.  Well, when the forest-people reached the hollow where the concert was to be given, there was Peter Mink, all smiles. He stepped up to each newcomer and said:  \"Check your hat and coat?\"  Some of the forest-people didn't know what he meant, until Peter explained to them that he would take care of hats, coats, umbrellas, walking-sticks, or anything else that anybody might like to leave with him during the concert.  \"How are you going to find my hat, if I leave it with you?\" Mr. Rabbit asked.  Peter Mink showed him a heap of oak leaves.  \"I'll tear one of these in two,\" he said, \"give you half of it, and stick the other half inside your hatband. When the concert is over and you come away, all you have to do is to hand me your half of the oak leaf and I'll see which piece matches it among those that I have kept. And the hat in which the other half happens to be stuck must be your hat. Do you understand? It's quite simple,\" Peter said.  Mr. Rabbit said that he understood, and that it was a good idea, too. But he thought he'd keep his hat with him.  Then his wife said to him in a low voice that he ought to do whatever he could to help Peter Mink.  \"Now that Peter"]]]
