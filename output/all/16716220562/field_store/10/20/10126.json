It is but justice to Reuben and his party to say that they offered no opposition to their leader during the whole voyage.  In regard to this, one speech made by Reuben will suffice to describe the spirit that animated him.  \"It don't do, Lawrence,\" said he, \"to go for to interfere wi' them as leads.  Be they wise or be they foolish it on'y makes matters wus to interfere wi' leaders, my lad; therefore it's best _always_ to hold your tongue an' do yer dooty.  What Monsieur Mackenzie is, it ain't for the likes of you and me to pretend for to judge.  He _seems_ to me an able, brave, and wise man, so my colours is nailed to the mast, d'ye see--as was said by the immortal Lord Nelson--an' I've made up my mind to follow him to the end, through thick and thin.  It's little right I would have to claim to be a pioneer if I didn't hold them sentiments.\"  \"Them sentiments,\" we need scarcely add, were heartily echoed by his Indian friend and his son.  The appearance of deserted native encampments still further confirmed Mackenzie in his belief that he had at length reached the land of the Esquimaux.  Round their fireplaces were found scattered pieces of whalebone, and spots were observed where train-oil had been spilt.  The deserted huts also corresponded in construction with those which were known to be built elsewhere by the denizens of the far north.  Several runners of sledges were also found, and the skulls of a large animal, which was conjectured to be the walrus.  Here the land was covered with short grass and flowers, though the earth was not thawed above four inches from the surface; beneath that all was frozen hard.  The pioneers had now at last reached the entrance of what appeared to be a lake, which was in the neighbourhood of the Polar Sea, if not that sea itself; but the variety of channels, the strength of currents, the shallowness of the water and quantity of ice with which it was beset, with the ignorance of their guide, rendered it impossible to make any further advance that season.  The object of the expedition, however, had been accomplished.  The largest northern river of America, estimated at 2000 miles in length, had been traced from its source to its outlet in the Polar Sea; the nature of the country and its inhabitants had been ascertained; coal and copper ore had been discovered; the region had been wrenched from the realms of _terra incognita_, and the energetic pioneer fixed the position of his most northerly discoveries in 69 degrees 7 minutes north latitude.  Another fact which proved that they were within the influence of the sea was the rise and fall of the water, which could be nothing else than the tide.  They caught a fish, also, resembling a herring, which none of the party had ever seen except English Chief who declared it to be of a kind that abounds in Hudson's Bay, and finally they beheld what settled the question, a shoal of white whales, which their Indian guide said was the principal food of the Esquimaux.  It was no wonder that the discoverers found the navigation very intricate, because that great river, now named the Mackenzie, is known to empty its waters into the Polar Sea by innumerable mouths which form a delta of about forty miles in width.  Storms, rain, and fogs, threw additional hindrances in their way.  There was, therefore, nothing left for it but to erect a post and take possession of the land in the name of the King.  Homeward! after that, was the order of the day.  But what a mighty distance off that home was!  And, after all, when reached it was but a log-hut or two in a part of the vast wilderness which, regarded from a civilised-land point of view, was itself the very confines of the known world.  Our space forbids us to follow Mackenzie and his men on their arduous and interesting return voyage.  Suffice it to say that they dragged the canoes by means of lines against the strong current for a large portion of the way; and, after incurring innumerable dangers from natives, rapids, storms, and starvation, they reached the Lake of the Hills and landed at Fort Chipewyan on the 12th of September 1789, having been absent for the long period of one hundred and two days.  That our hero was not content to rest upon the laurels thus gathered in the far north, but longed to act the part of pioneer over the Rocky Mountains into the far west, shall be made plain in our next chapter.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY TO THE FAR WEST PLANNED AND BEGUN.  Three years passed away, during which period Mackenzie, being busily occupied with his arduous duties as a fur-trader, could not carry out the more noble purposes of discovery on which his heart was set.  But a time at length arrived when circumstances permitted him to turn his eyes once more with a set purpose on the unknown wilderness of the West. Seated one fine morning about the beginning of spring, in his wooden residence at Fort Chipewyan, he observed Reuben Guff passing the window with an axe on his shoulder, that worthy, with his son and Swiftarrow, having engaged in the service of the fur-traders at the end of the late expedition.  Opening the door, Mackenzie called him in.  \"Where are you bound for just now, Reuben?\"  \"To dinner, monsieur.\"  \"Reuben,\" said Mackenzie, with a peculiar look, \"has all your pioneering enthusiasm oozed out at your finger ends?\"  \"No, monsieur,\" replied the man, with a slight smile, \"but Lawrence and I have bin thinkin' of late that as Monsieur Mackenzie seems to have lost heart, we must undertake a v'yage o' diskivery on our own account!\"  \"Good.  Then you are both ready, doubtless, to begin your discoveries with a canoe journey of some extent on short notice?\"  \"At once, monsieur, if it please you.\"  \"Nay, Reuben, not quite so fast as that,\" said Mackenzie, with a laugh; \"you may have your dinner first.  But to-morrow you shall become a genuine pioneer by preceding me towards the far west.  You know the position of our most distant settlements on the Peace River?\"  \"Perfectly,\" said Reuben, whose eye kindled as he began to see that his master was in earnest.  \"Well, I intend to visit these settlements this fall, and push on towards the Rocky Mountains.  It will take me to the end of the season to accomplish this, so that our real voyage of discovery will not begin until the following spring.  Now, there is a certain locality beyond our most distant outpost, which I shall describe to you afterwards, where I intend to build a fort and spend next winter, so as to be on the spot ready to begin the moment the ice breaks up.  Preparations must be made there for the building of the fort.  Timber must be felled, cut, and squared for the houses and palisades, and two able and willing, as well as experienced men, must go there to begin this work without delay.  It occurs to me that the two best men I have for such work are Reuben Guff and his son.  Are they prepared for this duty, think you?\"  \"Say the word, monsieur,\" was Reuben's laconic but significant reply.  \"Well, then, it is said.  Come back here after dinner with Lawrence, and I will give you instructions: you shall start to-morrow at daybreak.\"  Reuben bowed and left the hall with a light step.  Next day he and his son started on their journey in a small birch-bark canoe; on the 10th of October Mackenzie followed in a canoe of larger dimensions.  He visited several establishments of the district of which he had charge; ascended the Peace River towards its unknown sources, gave good advice to the several bands of Indians whom he met with by the way, and generally strengthened the hearts and hands of his agents.  Passing the last outpost on the river, he pushed on, until, finally, he reached his intended winter-quarters on the 1st of November--not a day too soon, for the river was already being covered with its winter coat of ice.  Here he found Reuben and Lawrence, bronzed and hardened with toil and exposure.  They had done good service during the previous summer, for all the timber was prepared, a space marked out for the fort, and a deep trench dug for the palisades.  Here also were found a band of natives, amounting to about seventy men, anxiously awaiting the arrival of the Chief, as they styled Mackenzie, and thirsting especially for tobacco and rum, both of which--unlike the natives of the far north--they were particularly fond of.  To build a fort in a few weeks, consisting of a dwelling-house and several stores, with palisades eighteen feet high, in the midst of frost so intense that their axes sometimes became as brittle as glass, and living in tents the while, exposed to the storms of wind and snow peculiar to a hyperborean clime, was a feat which, if detailed, would fill a volume.  We are constrained to dismiss the subject in a line. Thus curtly, also, must we treat the winter.  Yet some points we cannot forbear to touch on, illustrative as they are of some curious experiences of the fur-traders.  The Indians there were unusually ignorant of medical science, and when ill applied to Mackenzie, believing, with childlike simplicity, that he certainly knew everything and could do anything!  One woman came to him with a swelled breast, which her friends had lacerated with flints in order to cure it; this failing, they had blown on it, but with similar want of success.  Mackenzie knew not what to do, but, bringing common sense to bear on the case, he made the poor creature keep it clean (she was naturally dirty), poulticed it several times, and anointed it with healing salve.  In a short time a perfect cure was effected.  After that an Indian while at work in the woods was attacked with a sudden pain near the first joint of his thumb, which disabled him.  He appealed to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],["title","The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#0)"],["body","PIRATE CITY, BY R.M. BALLANTINE.  A Tale of the Pirates of the City of Algiers, and their Defeat by the British Navy.  The Time of the Action is about 1817.  The Pirate City--by RM Ballantyne    CHAPTER ONE.  OPENS THE TALE.  Some time within the first quarter of the present nineteenth century, a little old lady--some people would even have called her a dear little old lady--sat one afternoon in a high-backed chair beside a cottage window, from which might be had a magnificent view of Sicilian rocks, with the Mediterranean beyond.  This little old lady was so pleasant in all respects that an adequate description of her is an impossibility.  Her mouth was a perfect study. It was not troubled with anything in the shape of teeth.  It lay between a delicate little down-turned nose and a soft little up-turned chin, which two seemed as if anxious to meet in order to protect it.  The wrinkles that surrounded that mouth were innumerable, and each wrinkle was a distinct and separate smile; so that, whether pursing or expanding, it was at all times rippling with an expression of tender benignity.  This little old lady plays no part in our tale; nevertheless she merits passing introduction as being the grandmother of our hero, a Sicilian youth of nineteen, who, at the time we write of, sat on a stool at her feet engaged in earnest conversation.  \"Grandmother,\" said the youth in a perplexed mood, \"why won't you let _me_ go into the Church instead of brother Lucien?  I'm certain that he does not want to, though he is fit enough, as far as education goes, and goodness; but you know well enough that he is desperately fond of Juliet, and she is equally desperate about him, and nothing could be more pleasant than that they should get married.\"  \"Tut, child, you talk nonsense,\" said the old lady, letting a sigh escape from the rippling mouth.  \"Your father's dearest wish has always been to see Lucien enter the Church, and although Juliet is our adopted child, we do not intend to interfere with the wishes of her uncle the abbot, who has offered to place her in the convent of Saint Shutemup. As to you taking Lucien's place,\"--here the mouth expanded considerably--\"ah!  Mariano, you are too foolish, too giddy; better fitted to be a sailor or soldier I should think--\"  \"How!\" interrupted Mariano.  \"Do you then estimate the profession of the soldier and sailor so low, that you think only foolish and giddy fellows are fit for it?\"  \"Not so, child; but it is a school which is eminently fitted to teach respect and obedience to foolish and giddy fellows who are pert to their grandmothers.\"  \"Ah! how unfair,\" exclaimed Mariano, with assumed solemnity; \"I give you good advice, with gravity equal to that of any priest, and yet you call me pert.  Grandmother, you are ungrateful as well as unjust.  Have I not been good to you all my life?\"  \"You have, my child,\" said the little old lady; \"very good--also rather troublesome, especially in the way of talking nonsense, and I'm sorry to find that although your goodness continues, your troublesomeness does not cease!\"  \"Well, well,\" replied the youth, with a sprightly toss of the head, \"Lucien and I shall enjoy at least a few weeks more of our old life on the blue sea before he takes to musty books and I to the stool of the clerk.  Ah, why did you allow father to give us a good education?  How much more enjoyable it would have been to have lived the free life of a fisherman--or of that pig,\" he said, pointing to one which had just strayed into the garden and lain down to roll in the earth--\"what happy ignorance or ignorant happiness; what concentrated enjoyment of the present, what perfect oblivion as to the past, what obvious disregard of the future--\"  \"Ay,\" interrupted the little old lady, \"what blissful ignorance of the deeds of ancient heroes, of the noble achievements of great and good men, of the adventures of Marco Polo, and Magellan, and Vasco de Gama, over whose voyages you have so often and so fondly pored.\"  \"I see, grandmother, that it is useless to argue with you.  Let us turn to a graver subject.  Tell me, what am I to bring you from Malta?  As this is in very truth to be our last voyage, I must bring you something grand, something costly.--Ah, here comes Juliet to help us to decide.\"  As he spoke a pretty dark-eyed girl of nineteen entered the room and joined their council, but before they had gone very deep into the question which Mariano had propounded, they were interrupted by the entrance of the head of the house, Francisco Rimini, a strong portly man of about fifty years of age, with a brown, healthy complexion, grizzled locks, a bald pate, and a semi-nautical gait.  He was followed by a stranger, and by his eldest son, Lucien--a tall, grave, slender youth of twenty-three, who was in many respects the opposite of his brother Mariano, physically as well as mentally.  The latter was middle-sized, broad-shouldered, and very powerful, with short curly brown hair, flashing eyes and sprightly disposition--active as a kitten, and rather mischievous.  Lucien was grave, gentle, and studious; elegantly rather than powerfully formed, and disposed rather to enjoy fun by looking on than engaging in it.  Both brothers, as well as their father, possessed kindly dispositions and resolute spirits.  \"Mother,\" said Francisco, \"let me introduce to you my friend Signor Bacri, a merchant who goes in my vessel as a passenger to Malta.  He dines with us to-day; and that reminds me that you must hasten our dinner, as events have transpired which oblige me to set sail two hours earlier than I had intended; so please expedite matters, Juliet.\"  The stranger bowed with Oriental dignity to the little old lady, and, seating himself by her side, entered into conversation.  Bacri was a middle-aged man of magnificent appearance.  From the cast of his features it was easy to perceive that he was of Jewish extraction, and his proportions might have been compared to those of the ancient enemy of his nation, Goliath.  Like Saul, he was a head and shoulders higher than ordinary men, yet he evidently placed no confidence in his physical strength, for although his countenance was grave and his expression dignified, he stooped a good deal, as though to avoid knocking his head against ceilings and beams, and was singularly humble and unobtrusive in his manners.  There was a winning softness, too, in his voice and in his smile, which went far to disarm that distrust of, and antipathy to, his race which prevailed in days of old, and unfortunately prevails still, to some extent, in Christendom.  With the activity of a good housewife, Juliet expedited the operations of the cook; dinner was served in good time; Francisco, who was owner of his vessel and cargo, as well as padrone or captain, entertained Bacri with accounts of his adventures on the sea, which the Jew returned in kind with his experiences of mercantile transactions in savage lands. Mariano drank in all that they said with youthful avidity, and the little old lady's mouth rippled responsive, like the aspen leaf to the breeze; while Lucien and Juliet, thus left to themselves, had no other resource than to entertain each other as best they could!  Then the adieux were said, the voyagers went down to the port, embarked on board their good ship--a trim-built schooner--and set sail with a fair wind.  \"I wish I saw them all safe back again!\" said the little old lady, with a sigh.  Juliet said nothing, though she echoed the sigh.  Meanwhile the schooner leant over to the breeze, and ere night-fall left the shores of Sicily far behind.    CHAPTER TWO.  UNFOLDS A LITTLE OF THE TALE.  Another and a very different vessel chanced to be floating in those seas at the time the Sicilian trader set sail.  At a distance she might have been mistaken for a fishing-boat, for she carried only two lateen sails, of that high triangular form which may still be seen in the Mediterranean and on the lakes of Switzerland.  In reality, however, the vessel was of greater dimensions than even the largest boat, and her main-mast with its sail was of gigantic proportions.  She was also full-decked, and several pieces of heavy ordnance pointed their black muzzles from port-holes in her bulwarks.  No one could have mistaken her character as a vessel of war, for, besides the guns referred to, she had an unusually large crew of bronzed and stalwart men.  Their costume, as well as their arms, told that these were of Eastern origin.  Although there was much variety in detail, they all wore the same gold-laced jackets, the same loose Turkish drawers gathered in below the knees, and broad silken scarfs round their waists, with richly chased silver-mounted pistols and yataghans or curved swords.  Some wore the turban, others the blue-tasselled red fez or tarbouch of Tunis, while a few contented themselves with a kerchief tied loosely round their heads.  One, who appeared to be the captain of the vessel, stood near the steersman, leaning on the bulwarks, and scanning the horizon with a telescope.  His costume was similar to that of his men, but of richer material.  \"It is certainly a sail,\" said he whom we have styled the captain to one who stood by his side, and might have been his lieutenant or mate.  \"She bears sou'-west, I think,\" replied the latter.  \"So much the better,\" returned the captain; \"let her fall off a little-- so, steady.  If this wind holds for half an hour we shall get well abreast of her, and then--\"  The captain shut up the telescope with an emphatic bang, by way of termination to his remark, and, turning on his heel, paced the deck rapidly by the side of his mate.  \"We have been unlucky hitherto,\" he observed; \"perchance fortune may change and now be favourable.  At all events, we shall be ready.  See, the breeze freshens.  Go, call up the men and clear for action.\"  The breeze had indeed been freshening while he spoke, and now came down in a series of squalls that caused"]]]
