Everybody, except those who were already members, agreed. Many had thought the present arrangement unfair, and had grumbled loudly, though nobody had had the initiative to start a revolt. Now Joan Masters and Elspeth Frazer took the matter in hand seriously, tackled the clique, and argued the question.  \"You may run a private club if you like for your own amusement,\" said Elspeth, \"but if you're going to call it 'The Fifth Form Dramatic', and give a performance before the other Forms at Christmas, then it must be a fair and open thing. Everyone must be eligible for membership, and officers should be chosen by ballot.\"  \"Half of you wouldn't be able to join,\" declared Hilda Browne.  \"That's our own lookout. The point is that we ought to be able to do so if we want. If you persist in keeping it all to yourselves, you may act without an audience, for none of us will come to see you, and we'll tell the other Forms what the quarrel is.\"  \"I know they'd back us up,\" said Joan Masters.  Very unwillingly the clique gave way. They knew they had no just ground for their position, but they had hoped it would not be called in question.  \"It's all the fault of Gwen Gascoyne, with her Lower School notions,\" said Rachel Hunter.  \"She needn't think she's going to act!\" asserted Edith Arnold.  \"Don't want to!\" rapped out Gwen, who happened to overhear. \"I should miss the bus if I stayed behind after four. I only wanted to see things made fair and square.\"  Though the new arrangements were really owing to Gwen's enterprise, nobody was willing to accord her any thanks. Joan Masters and Elspeth Frazer received all the credit for having righted the wrong; and though a few might remember that Gwen had started the movement, they were almost ready to agree with Rachel Hunter that it was rather pushing of an ex-Junior to have taken so much upon herself. They had not yet forgiven her translation to the Fifth, and only the utmost humility on her part would have reconciled them. Humility was certainly not Gwen's characteristic, so she still went by the epithet of \"that cheeky kid\" in the Form.  \"So much for their gratitude,\" confided Gwen to Lesbia. \"I don't want to act, but some of those who have got into the play might at least acknowledge what I've done for them.\"  \"They seem a hateful set!\" sympathized Lesbia.  \"Detestable!\" said Gwen with unction.  One thing had not been settled by the Dramatic Society, and that was their choice of a President. Names were canvassed freely in the Form, and finally Hilda Browne and Elspeth Frazer were put up as candidates. Voting was to be by ballot during the interval, but while the papers were being given out Gwen bolted. She was feeling cross and forlorn, and sick of the whole affair.  \"I don't mind who's chosen President,\" she thought \"It makes no difference to me. They may elect whom they like.\"  So she went a solitary little walk round the playground, whistling a tune, and trying to look as if she didn't care about anything. She had not been there very long before she saw Betty Brierley and Ida Young signalling to her from the gymnasium door. She took no notice of their beckonings, whereupon they ran after her, and seizing her one by each arm, began to drag her towards the house.  \"You're wanted most particularly, Gwen Gascoyne!\" said Betty excitedly.  \"We've been sent to fetch you quick!\" chimed in Ida.  \"Hello! Hands off!\" cried Gwen, dragging herself from their grasp. \"What do you want with me, I should like to know?\"  \"It's the others who want you.\"  \"What for? Didn't know I was so popular!\"  \"You've not voted for a President yet.\"  \"No, and I don't mean to, either.\"  \"But, Gwen, you must! We've taken the ballot, and the votes are exactly even. You've got the casting vote!\"  \"Have I, indeed? No, thank you! It's rather too great an honour!\"  \"But look here, Gwen, it's the only way to decide it. We've got to choose either Elspeth or Hilda.\"  \"Then you may fight it out amongst you. You don't suppose, when you've all voted by ballot, that I'm going to take the responsibility of a casting vote. It's a most unfair proposal. Why, the rejected candidate and all on her side would never forgive me!\"  \"We might have the ballot again,\" suggested Betty. \"Then you need only put your cross.\"  \"As if everybody wouldn't know who was responsible for the extra cross! I might as well write Gwen Gascoyne on my paper at once! It's no use pulling my arm; I'm not coming in to be made a cat's paw. You may go and tell the others so if you like.\"  Betty and Ida departed, grumbling loudly at Gwen's \"unaccommodatingness\", as they called it, and Gwen stayed in the playground until the bell rang, fuming with indignation. Every fresh little episode seemed to serve to make her more of an alien in the Form than ever. But here her decision was absolutely justifiable; not one of the girls would have cared to accept the unenviable role which they had wished to thrust upon her. Perhaps for that very reason they were all the more annoyed at her action. She was received with black looks when she re-entered the classroom. Elspeth Frazer whispered something to a friend, and turned away. Gwen could not quite hear, but it sounded painfully like \"beast!\"  \"Have they settled it?\" she asked Netta.  \"Yes; Elspeth and Hilda drew lots, and Hilda won. I'm fearfully sorry she did. Elspeth says it's all your fault, and that you ought to have voted for her when you'd made such a fuss about the clique.\"  \"Would you have given a casting vote yourself?\"  \"Well, no; but if you'd only stayed and voted by ballot like everyone else, then nobody would have known who'd given the odd one. It was most stupid of you to rush away. You're rather an idiot, Gwen Gascoyne!\"  \"'_Et tu, Brute!_ Then fall, Cæsar!' I'm like the old man and his ass in Æsop; I seem to end by pleasing nobody.\"  \"Do you wish to compare yourself with the old man or the quadruped, my child? The latter's the more apt, certainly!\"  \"Oh, good night!\" said Gwen, who was getting the worst of it \"I wish sometimes I'd never come into your wretched Form.\"  \"You'd be far more at home among the Juniors!\" snapped Netta, rather out of temper.  A few days after this was the Rodenhurst Annual Distribution of Prizes. It was always held in the beginning of November, rather an unusual date, to be sure, but Miss Roscoe found it convenient in many ways to have it in the middle of the autumn term. It gave plenty of time to receive examiners' reports, and to chronicle successes in the July examinations, but on the other hand it did not interfere with Christmas celebrations.  The function took place in the Town Hall at Stedburgh, and there was invariably a large gathering of parents and friends. To the whole school it seemed an important occasion, and both Gwen and Lesbia were full of excitement when the afternoon arrived.  \"Not that I need alarm myself that I shall be called upon to walk up and receive a prize!\" said Lesbia. \"Never got one in my life, and never shall!\"  \"You might get the Sewing or the Holiday Competitions,\" said Gwen, trying to be encouraging.  \"No fear! One genius is enough in a family! I'll go prepared to clap you!\"  All the girls wore white dresses and blue hair ribbons, and made quite an imposing array as they sat in the central aisle of the large room at the Town Hall.  \"There seem to be far more of us when we're in white!\" said Gwen. \"We don't look half so many in the lecture hall at school. Have a few little angels crept in unawares?\"  \"You're not one of them, at any rate,\" laughed Netta, who was sitting next to her.  To Gwen the great feature of the occasion was that Father was seated on the platform, in company with several other clergymen and the Mayor, who was to distribute the prizes. Beatrice was amongst the audience, and had brought Martin with her, and Giles and Basil had come with the Boys' contingent. All her family were present, and if she were to get a prize, how pleased they would be!  The proceedings began with the usual speeches from the chairman and others. Gwen had heard these every year, and they were always pretty much on the same theme. It is hard to be original at prize-givings, and the gentlemen who had been asked to \"say a few words\" might be forgiven if their remarks were somewhat hackneyed. Miss Roscoe read the examiners' report on the school, and the successes in the Matriculation and the Senior and Junior Oxfords. These the girls knew already, so, though they clapped heartily, it did not cause much excitement. Everyone was waiting in suspense for the prize list.  Miss Roscoe always began with the lowest Form, so the first to walk up to the platform was a small kindergarten child, who had won honours for \"general improvement\". Neither Giles nor Basil had any luck; they were too erratic to be serious students, but when it came to the turn of the Middle Second, Lesbia Gascoyne was awarded the prize for plain sewing. A perfect storm of clapping greeted pretty Lesbia as she returned down the hall to her place. She was a tremendous favourite at Rodenhurst, and Seniors and Juniors alike applauded. It was the first time she had ever distinguished herself in any way, and though it was only for plain sewing, the girls were ready to give her an ovation. At last the Upper Fourth was reached, and Gwen knew that as she had taken her exams with her old Form (the Middle Fourth it had been in July) her name would be still on that list.  \"First prize for Mathematics, Gwen Gascoyne,\" read Miss Roscoe.  Gwen's heart thumped, for a moment she did not move, till Netta gave her an admonishing push, then she walked up the hall. The Mayor handed her a volume of Coleridge's poems, handsomely bound in calf, and emblazoned with the school arms; he smiled pleasantly as he did so, and added a word of compliment. Gwen murmured \"Thank you\", and turned away. Father was clapping his loudest on the platform, and there"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21688"],["title","Scottish Cathedrals and Abbeys (#0)"],["body","GUILD LIBRARY  \"All the manuals are fine examples of careful workmanship and scholarly industry.\"--\"Independent and Nonconformist,\" 17th August 1896.  \"A series of which we have often spoken in terms of very high commendation.\"--\"Record,\" 11th March 1898.  \"A most admirable series.\"--\"Methodist Times,\" 25th August 1898.  \"No more beautiful series of the kind passes under our notice.\"--\"Literary World,\" 21st October 1898.

R. HERBERT STORY, D.D., LL.D. PRINCIPAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW  LONDON: A. & C. BLACK, SOHO SQUARE EDINBURGH: R. & R. CLARK, LIMITED  PUBLICATION AGENTS FOR THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND  1901     PREFACE   In preparation for this Guild Book I wrote an account of every pre-Reformation structure in Scotland of which any remains now survive, but the prescribed limits of the series necessitated a selection. The Scottish cathedrals are all here treated, with representative collegiate and monastic buildings. Reference is also made to parish churches that represent the architecture of the various periods indicated in Chapter II. A survey of Scottish mediæval architecture will be found in pp. 194-206 that may enable readers to take a comprehensive view of the whole. A study of those treated in particular will lead to a study of those treated of necessity in general, and illustrate the idea that the history of the Scottish Church is the history of the ideality and faith of the Scottish people, and that the one cannot be separated from the other. A healthy present must always be bound by a natural piety to the past that has made it, or at least helped it to be what it is, and this study may enable readers to realise more that the Church of Scotland has a great and glorious past that begins with the days of St. Ninian and St. Columba. The past has much to teach the present, and the narrative of historical facts is not without suggestiveness to the varied life and work that characterise the Church of Scotland to-day.
