As for the pantaloons, they were a complete wreck. When Dick had possessed them they were well ventilated; but they were now ventilated so much more thoroughly that, as Dick said afterwards, \"a feller would be warmer without any.\"  \"That's Micky Maguire,\" said Dick; \"a partic'lar friend of mine, that had such a great 'fection for me that he stole my clothes to remember me by.\"  \"Perhaps,\" said Fosdick, \"it was on account of his great respect for General Washington and the Emperor Napoleon.\"  \"What would the great Washington say if he could see his coat now?\" said Frank.  \"When I wore it,\" said Dick, \"I was sorry he was so great, 'cause it prevented his clothes fitting me.\"  It may be necessary to explain to those who are unacquainted with Dick's earlier adventures, that the clothes in which he was originally introduced were jocosely referred to by him as gifts from the illustrious personages whose names have been mentioned.  Micky Maguire did not at first recognize Dick. When he did so, he suddenly shambled down Prince Street, fearful, perhaps, that the stolen clothes would be reclaimed.  They had now reached the St. Nicholas, and entered. Mr. Whitney led the way up to his apartment, and then, having a business engagement with a gentleman below, he descended to the reading-room, leaving the boys alone. Left to themselves, they talked freely. Dick related fully the different steps in his education, with which some of our readers are already familiar, and received hearty congratulations from Frank, and earnest encouragement to persevere.  \"I wish you were going to be in the city, Frank,\" said Dick.  \"So I shall be soon,\" said Frank.  Dick's face lighted up with pleasure.  \"That's bully,\" said he, enthusiastically. \"How soon are you comin'?\"  \"I am hoping to enter Columbia College next commencement. I suppose my time will be a good deal taken up with study, but I shall always find time for you and Fosdick. I hope you both will call upon me.\"  Both boys readily accepted the invitation in advance, and Dick promised to write to Frank at his boarding-school in Connecticut. At about half past ten, the two boys left the St. Nicholas, and went back to their boarding-house.  After a comfortable night's sleep, they got up punctually to the seven o'clock breakfast. It consisted of beefsteak, hot biscuit, potatoes, and very good coffee. Dick and Fosdick did justice to the separate viands, and congratulated themselves upon the superiority of their present fare to that which they had been accustomed to obtain at the restaurants.  Breakfast over, Fosdick set out for the hat and cap store in which he was employed, and Dick for Rockwell & Cooper's on Pearl Street. It must be confessed that he felt a little bashful as he stood in front of the large warehouse, and surveyed the sign. He began to feel some apprehensions that he would not be found competent for his post. It seemed such a rise from the streets to be employed in such an imposing building. But Dick did not long permit timidity to stand in his way. He entered the large apartment on the first floor, which he found chiefly used for storing large boxes and cases of goods. There was a counting-room and office, occupying one corner, partitioned off from the rest of the department. Dick could see a young man through the glass partition sitting at a desk; and, opening the door, he entered. He wished it had been Mr. Rockwell, for it would have saved him from introducing himself; but of course it was too early for that gentleman to appear.  \"What is your business?\" inquired the book-keeper, for it was he.  \"I've come to work,\" said Dick, shortly, for somehow he did not take much of a fancy to the book-keeper, whose tone was rather supercilious.  \"Oh, you've come to work, have you?\"  \"Yes, I have,\" said Dick, independently.  \"I don't think we shall need your valuable services,\" said the book-keeper, with something of a sneer. The truth was, that Mr. Rockwell had neglected to mention that he had engaged Dick.  Dick, though a little inclined to be bashful when he entered, had quite got over that feeling now. He didn't intend to be intimidated or driven away by the man before him. There was only one doubt in his mind. This might be Mr. Cooper, the second member of the firm, although he did not think it at all probable. So he ventured this question, \"Is Mr. Rockwell or Mr. Cooper in?\"  \"They're never here at this hour.\"  \"So I supposed,\" said Dick, coolly.  He sat down in an arm-chair, and took up the morning paper.  The book-keeper was decidedly provoked by his coolness. He felt that he had not impressed Dick with his dignity or authority, and this made him angry.  \"Bring that paper to me, young man,\" he said; \"I want to consult it.\"  \"Very good,\" said Dick; \"you can come and get it.\"  \"I can't compliment you on your good manners,\" said the other.  \"Good manners don't seem to be fashionable here,\" said Dick, composedly.  Apparently the book-keeper did not want the paper very particularly, as he did not take the trouble to get up for it. Dick therefore resumed his reading, and the other dug his pen spitefully into the paper, wishing, but not quite daring, to order Dick out of the counting-room, as it might be possible that he had come by appointment.  \"Did you come to see Mr. Rockwell?\" he asked, at length, looking up from his writing.  \"Yes,\" said Dick.  \"Did he tell you to come?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What was that you said about coming to work?\"  \"I said I had come here to work.\"  \"Who engaged you?\"  \"Mr. Rockwell.\"  \"Oh, indeed! And how much are you to receive for your valuable services?\"  \"You are very polite to call my services valuable,\" said Dick. \"I hope they will be.\"  \"You haven't answered my question.\"  \"I have no objection, I'm sure. I'm to get ten dollars a week.\"  \"Ten dollars a week!\" echoed the book-keeper, with a scornful laugh. \"Do you expect you will earn that?\"  \"No, I don't,\" said Dick, frankly.  \"You don't!\" returned the other, doubtfully. \"Well, you're more modest than I thought for. Then why are you to get so much?\"  \"Perhaps Mr. Rockwell will tell you,\" said Dick, \"if you tell him you're very particular to know, and will lose a night's rest if you don't find out.\"  \"I wouldn't give you a dollar a week.\"  \"Then I'm glad I aint goin' to work for you.\"  \"I don't believe your story at all. I don't think Mr. Rockwell would be such a fool as to overpay you so much.\"  \"P'r'aps I shouldn't be the only one in the establishment that is overpaid,\" observed Dick.  \"Do you mean me, you young rascal?\" demanded the book-keeper, now very angry.  \"Don't call names. It isn't polite.\"  \"I demand an answer. Do you mean to say that I am overpaid?\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, deliberately, \"if you're paid anything for bein' polite, I should think you was overpaid considerable.\"  There is no knowing how long this skirmishing would have continued, if Mr. Rockwell himself had not just then entered the counting-room. Dick rose respectfully at his entrance, and the merchant, recognizing him at once, advanced smiling and gave him a cordial welcome.  \"I am glad to see you, my boy,\" he said. \"So you didn't forget the appointment. How long have you been here?\"  \"Half an hour, sir.\"  \"I am here unusually early this morning. I came purposely to see you, and introduce you to those with whom you will labor. Mr. Gilbert, this is a young man who is going to enter our establishment. His name is Richard Hunter. Mr. Gilbert, Richard, is our book-keeper.\"  Mr. Gilbert nodded slightly, not a little surprised at his employer's cordiality to the new boy.  \"So the fellow was right, after all,\" he thought. \"But it can't be possible he is to receive ten dollars a week.\"  \"Come out into the ware-room, and I will show you about,\" continued Mr. Rockwell. \"How do you think you shall like business, Richard?\"  Dick was on the point of saying \"Bully,\" but checked himself just in time, and said instead, \"Very much indeed, sir.\"  \"I hope you will. If you do well you may depend upon promotion. I shall not forget under what a heavy obligation I am to you, my brave boy.\"  What would the book-keeper have said, if he had heard this?  \"How is the little boy, sir?\" asked Dick.  \"Very well, indeed. He does not appear even to have taken cold, as might have been expected from his exposure, and remaining in wet clothes for some time.\"  \"I am glad to hear that he is well, sir.\"  \"You must come up and see him for yourself, Richard,\" said Mr. Rockwell, in a friendly manner. \"I have no doubt you will become good friends very soon. Besides, my wife is anxious to see and thank the preserver of her boy.\"  \"I shall be very glad indeed to come, sir.\"  \"I live at No. ---- Madison Avenue. Come to-morrow evening, if you have no engagement.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  Mr. Rockwell now introduced Dick to his head clerk with a few words, stating that he was a lad in whose welfare he took a deep interest, and he would be glad to have him induct him into his duties, and regard with indulgence any mistakes which he might at first make through ignorance.  The head clerk was a pleasant-looking man, of middle age, named Murdock; very different in his manners and bearing from Mr. Gilbert, the book-keeper.  \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I will take the young man under my charge; he looks bright and sharp enough, and I hope we may make a business man of him in course of time.\"  That was what Dick liked. His heart always opened to kindness, but harshness always made him defiant.  \"I'll try to make you as little trouble as possible, sir,\" he said. \"I may make mistakes at first, but I'm willin' to work, and I want to work my way up.\"  \"That's right, my boy,\" said Mr. Murdock. \"Let that be your determination, and I am sure you will succeed.\"  \"Before Mr. Murdock begins to instruct you in your duties,\" said Mr. Rockwell, \"you may go to the post-office, and see if there are any letters for us. Our box is No. 5,670.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Dick; and he took"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],["title","Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#3)"],["body","hat at once and started.  He reached Chatham Square, turned into Printing House Square, and just at the corner of Spruce and Nassau Streets, close by the Tribune Office, he saw the familiar face and figure of Johnny Nolan, one of his old associates when he was a boot-black.  \"How are you, Johnny?\" he said.  \"Is that you, Dick?\" asked Johnny, turning round. \"Where's your box and brush?\"  \"At home.\"  \"You haven't give up business,--have you?\"  \"I've just gone into business, Johnny.\"  \"I mean you aint give up blackin' boots,--have you?\"  \"All except my own, Johnny. Aint that a good shine?\" and Dick displayed his boot with something of his old professional pride.  \"What you up to now, Dick? You're dressed like a swell.\"  \"Oh,\" said Dick, \"I've retired from shines on a fortun', and embarked my capital in mercantile pursuits. I'm in a store on Pearl Street.\"  \"What store?\"  \"Rockwell & Cooper's.\"  \"How'd you get there?\"  \"They wanted a partner with a large capital, and so they took me,\" said Dick. \"We're goin' to do a smashin' business. We mean to send off a ship to Europe every day, besides what we send to other places, and expect to make no end of stamps.\"  \"What's the use of gassin', Dick? Tell a feller now.\"  \"Honor bright, then, Johnny, I've got a place at ten dollars a week, and I'm goin' to be 'spectable. Why don't you turn over a new leaf, and try to get up in the world?\"  \"I aint lucky, Dick. I don't half the time make enough to live on. If it wasn't for the Newsboys' Lodgin' House, I don't know what I'd do. I need a new brush and box of blacking, but I aint got money enough to buy one.\"  \"Then, Johnny, I'll help you this once. Here's fifty cents; I'll give it to you. Now, if you're smart you can make a dollar a day easy, and save up part of it. You ought to be more enterprisin', Johnny. There's a gentleman wants a shine now.\"  [Illustration]  Johnny hitched up his trousers, put the fifty cents in his mouth, having no pocket unprovided with holes, and proffered his services to the gentleman indicated, with success. Dick left him at work, and kept on his way down Nassau Street.  \"A year ago,\" he thought, \"I was just like Johnny, dressed in rags, and livin' as I could. If it hadn't been for my meetin' with Frank, I'd been just the same to day, most likely. Now I've got a good place, and some money in the bank, besides 'ristocratic friends who invite me to come and see them. Blessed if I aint afraid I'm dreamin' it all, like the man that dreamed he was in a palace, and woke up to find himself in a pigpen.\"     CHAPTER III.  AT THE POST-OFFICE.   The New York Post-Office is built of brick, and was formerly a church. It is a shabby building, and quite unworthy of so large and important a city. Of course Dick was quite familiar with its general appearance; but as his correspondence had been very limited, he had never had occasion to ask for letters.  There were several letters in Box 5,670. Dick secured these, and, turning round to go out, his attention was drawn to a young gentleman of about his own age, who, from his consequential air, appeared to feel his own importance in no slight degree. He recognized him at once as Roswell Crawford, a boy who had applied unsuccessfully for the place which Fosdick obtained in Henderson's hat and cap store.  Roswell recognized Dick at the same time, and perceiving that our hero was well-dressed, concluded to speak to him, though he regarded Dick as infinitely beneath himself in the social scale, on account of his former employment. He might not have been so condescending, but he was curious to learn what Dick was about.  \"I haven't seen you for some time,\" he said, in a patronizing tone.  \"No,\" said Dick, \"and I haven't seen you for some time either, which is a very curious coincidence.\"  \"How's boot-blacking, now?\" inquired Roswell, with something of a sneer.  \"Tip-top,\" said Dick, not at all disturbed by Roswell's manner. \"I do it wholesale now, and have been obliged to hire a large building on Pearl Street to transact my business in. You see them letters? They're all from wholesale customers.\"  \"I congratulate you on your success,\" said Roswell, in the same disagreeable manner. \"Of course that's all humbug. I suppose you've got a place.\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick.  \"Who are you with?\"  \"Rockwell & Cooper, on Pearl Street.\"  \"How did you get it?\" asked Roswell, appearing surprised. \"Did they know you had been a boot-black?\"  \"Of course they did.\"  \"I shouldn't think that they would have taken you.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"There are not many firms that would hire a boot-black, when they could get plenty of boys from nice families.\"  \"Perhaps they might have secured your services if they had applied,\" said Dick, good-humoredly.  \"I've got a place,\" said Roswell, in rather an important manner. \"I'm very glad I didn't go into Henderson's hat and cap store. I've got a better situation.\"  \"Have you?\" said Dick. \"I'm glad to hear it. I'm always happy to hear that my friends are risin' in the world.\"  \"You needn't class me among your friends,\" said Roswell, superciliously.  \"No, I won't,\" said Dick. \"I'm goin' to be particular about my associates, now that I'm gettin' up in the world.\"  \"Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Roswell, haughtily.  \"No,\" said Dick. \"I wouldn't on any account. I should be afraid you'd want me to fight a duel, and that wouldn't be convenient, for I haven't made my will, and I'm afraid my heirs would quarrel over my extensive property.\"  \"How much do you get a week?\" asked Roswell, thinking it best to change the subject.  \"Ten dollars,\" said Dick.  \"Ten dollars!\" ejaculated Roswell. \"That's a pretty large story.\"  \"You needn't believe it if you don't want to,\" said Dick. \"That won't make any difference to me as long as they pay me reg'lar.\"  \"Ten dollars! Why, I never heard of such a thing,\" exclaimed Roswell, who only received four dollars a week himself, and thought he was doing well.  \"Do you think I'd give up a loocrative business for less?\" asked Dick. \"How much do you get?\"  \"That's my business,\" said Roswell, who, for reasons that may be guessed, didn't care to mention the price for which he was working. Judging Dick by himself, he thought it would give him a chance to exult over him.  \"I suppose it is,\" said Dick; \"but as you was so partic'lar to find out how much I got, I thought I'd inquire.\"  \"You're trying to deceive me; I don't believe you get more than three dollars a week.\"  \"Don't you? Is that what you get?\"  \"I get a great deal more.\"  \"I'm happy to hear it.\"  \"I can find out how much you get, if I want to.\"  \"You've found out already.\"  \"I know what you say, but I've got a cousin in Rockwell & Cooper's.\"  \"Have you?\" asked Dick, a little surprised. \"Who is it?\"  \"It is the book-keeper.\"  \"Mr. Gilbert?\"  \"Yes; he has been there five years. I'll ask him about it.\"  \"You'd better, as you're so anxious to find out. Mr. Gilbert is a friend of mine. He spoke only this morning of my valooable services.\"  Roswell looked incredulous. In fact he did not understand Dick at all; nor could he comprehend his imperturbable good-humor. There were several things that he had said which would have offended most boys; but Dick met them with a careless good-humor, and an evident indifference to Roswell's good opinion, which piqued and provoked that young man.  It must not be supposed that while this conversation was going on the boys were standing in the post-office. Dick understood his duty to his employers too well to delay unnecessarily while on an errand, especially when he was sent to get letters, some of which might be of an important and urgent nature.  The two boys had been walking up Nassau Street together, and they had now reached Printing House Square.  \"There are some of your old friends,\" said Roswell, pointing to a group of ragged boot-blacks, who were on the alert for customers, crying to each passer, \"Shine yer boots?\"  \"Yes,\" said Dick, \"I know them all.\"  \"No doubt,\" sneered Roswell. \"They're friends to be proud of.\"  \"I'm glad you think so,\" said Dick. \"They're a rough set,\" he continued, more earnestly; \"but there's one of them, at least, that's ten times better than you or I.\"  \"Speak for yourself, if you please,\" said Roswell, haughtily.  \"I'm speakin' for both of us,\" said Dick. \"There's one boy there, only twelve years old, that's supported his sick mother and sister for more'n a year, and that's more good than ever you or I did.--How are you, Tom?\" he said, nodding to the boy of whom he had spoken.  \"Tip-top, Dick,\" said a bright-looking boy, who kept as clean as his avocation would permit. \"Have you given up business?\"  \"Yes, Tom. I'll tell you about it some other time. I must get back to Pearl Street with these letters. How's your mother?\"  \"She aint much better, Dick.\"  \"Buy her some oranges. They'll do her good,\" and Dick slipped half a dollar into Tom's hand.  \"Thank you, Dick. She'll like them, I know, but you oughtn't to give so much.\"  \"What's half a dollar to a man of my fortune?\" said Dick. \"Take care of yourself, Tom. I must hurry back to the store.\"  Roswell was already gone. His pride would not permit him to stand by while Dick was conversing with a boot-black. He felt that his position would be compromised. As for Dick, he was so well dressed that nobody would know that he had ever been in that business. The fact is, Roswell, like a great many other people, was troubled with a large share of pride, though it might have puzzled himself to explain what he had to be proud of. Had Dick been at all like him he would have shunned all his former acquaintances, and taken every precaution against having it discovered that he had ever occupied a similar position. But Dick was above such meanness. He could see that Tom, for instance, was far superior in all that constituted manliness to Roswell Crawford, and, boot-black though he was, he prepared to recognize him as a friend.  When Dick reached the store, he did not immediately see Mr."]]]
