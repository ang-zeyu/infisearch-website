The silence was then explained.  The face was growing cold and rigid in death.  Drawing back hastily, the poor youth shouted to those outside to let them know what had occurred, but no one paid the least attention to him. He was about to renew his cries more loudly, when the thought occurred that perhaps they might attribute them to fear.  This kept him quiet, and he made up his mind to endure in silence.  If there had been a ray of light, however feeble, in the hold, he thought his condition would have been more bearable, for then he could have faced the lifeless clay and looked at it; but to know that it was there, within a foot of him, without his being able to see it, or to form any idea of what it was like, made the case terrible indeed.  Of course he drew back from it as far as the little space allowed, and crushed himself up against the side of the vessel; but that did no good, for the idea occurred to his excited brain that it might possibly come to life again, rise up, and plunge against him.  At times this thought took such possession of him that he threw up his arms to defend himself from attack, and uttered a half-suppressed cry of terror.  At last nature asserted herself, and he slept, sitting on the floor and leaning partly against the vessel's side, partly against the bulkhead. But horrible dreams disturbed him.  The corpse became visible, the eyes glared at him, the blood-stained face worked convulsively, and he awoke with a shriek, followed immediately by a sigh of relief on finding that it was all a dream.  Then the horror came again, as he suddenly remembered that the dead man was still there, a terrible reality!  At last pure exhaustion threw him into a dreamless and profound slumber. The plunging of the little craft as it flew southward before a stiff breeze did not disturb him, and he did not awake until some one rudely seized his arm late on the following day.  Then, in the firm belief that his dream had come true at last, he uttered a tremendous yell and struggled to rise, but a powerful hand held him down, and a dark lantern revealed a coal-black face gazing at him.  \"Hallo! massa, hold on.  I did tink you mus' be gone dead, for I holler'd in at you 'nuff to bust de kittle-drum ob your ear--if you hab one!\"  \"Look there, Peter,\" said Foster, pointing to the recumbent figure, while he wiped the perspiration from his brow.  \"Ah! poor feller.  He gone de way ob all flesh; but he hoed sooner dan dere was any occasion for--tanks to de captain.\"  As he spoke he held the lantern over the dead man and revealed the face of a youth in Eastern garb, on whose head there was a terrible sword-cut.  As they looked at the sad spectacle, and endeavoured to arrange the corpse, the negro explained that the poor fellow had been a Greek captive who to save his life had joined the pirates and become a Mussulman; but, on thinking over it, had returned to the Christian faith and refused to take part in the bloody work which they were required to do.  It was his refusal to fight on the occasion of the recent attack on the merchantman that had induced the captain to cut him down.  He had been put into the prison in the hold, and carelessly left there to bleed to death.  \"Now, you come along, massa,\" said the negro, taking up the lantern, \"we's all goin' on shore.\"  \"On shore!  Where have we got to?\"  \"To Algiers, de city ob pirits; de hotbed ob wickedness; de home ob de Moors an' Turks an' Cabyles, and de cuss ob de whole wurld.\"  Poor Foster's heart sank on hearing this, for he had heard of the hopeless slavery to which thousands of Christians had been consigned there in time past, and his recent experience of Moors had not tended to improve his opinion of them.  A feeling of despair impelled him to seize the negro by the arm as he was about to ascend the ladder and stop him.  \"Peter,\" he said, \"I think you have a friendly feeling towards me, because you've called me massa more than once, though you have no occasion to do so.\"  \"Dat's 'cause I'm fond o' you.  I always was fond o' a nice smood young babby face, an' I tooked a fancy to you de moment I see you knock Joe Spinks into de lee scuppers.\"  \"So--he was an Englishman that I treated so badly, eh?\"  \"Yes, massa, on'y you didn't treat him bad 'nuff.  But you obsarve dat I on'y calls you massa w'en we's alone an' friendly like.  W'en we's in public I calls you `sar' an' speak gruff an' shove you into black holes.\"  \"And why do you act so, Peter?\"  \"'Cause, don't you see, I's a hyperkrite.  I tole you dat before.\"  \"Well, I can guess what you mean.  You don't want to appear too friendly?  Just so.  Well, now, I have got nobody to take my part here, so as you are a free man I wish you would keep an eye on me when we go ashore, and see where they send me, and speak a word for me when it is in your power.  You see, they'll give me up for drowned at home and never find out that I'm here.\"  \"`A free man!'\" repeated the negro, with an expansion of his mouth that is indescribable.  \"You tink I's a free man! but I's a slabe, same as yourself, on'y de diff'rence am dat dere's nobody to ransum _me_, so dey don't boder deir heads 'bout me s'long as I do my work.  If I don't do my work I'm whacked; if I rebel and kick up a shindy I'm whacked wuss; if I tries to run away I'm whacked till I'm dead.  Das all.  But I's not free.  No, no not at all!  Hows'ever I's free-an'-easy, an' dat make de pirits fond o' me, which goes a long way, for dere's nuffin' like lub!\"  Foster heartily agreed with the latter sentiment and added--  \"Well, now, Peter, I will say no more, for as you profess to be fond of me, and as I can truly say the same in regard to you, we may be sure that each will help the other if he gets the chance.  But, tell me, are you really one of the crew of this pirate vessel?\"  \"No, massa, only for dis viage.  I b'longs to a old sinner called Hassan, what libs in de country, not far from de town.  He not a bad feller, but he's obs'nit--oh! as obs'nit as a deaf an' dumb mule.  If you want 'im to go one way just tell him to go toder way--an' you've got 'im.\"  At that moment the captain's voice was heard shouting down the hatchway, demanding to know what detained the negro and his prisoners.  He spoke in that jumble of languages in use at that time among the Mediterranean nations called Lingua Franca, for the negro did not understand Arabic.  \"Comin', captain, comin',\" cried the negro, in his own peculiar English--which was, indeed, his mother tongue, for he had been born in the United States of America.  \"Now, den, sar,\" (to Foster), \"w'en you goin' to move you stumps?  Up wid you!\"  Peter emphasised his orders with a real kick, which expedited his prisoner's ascent, and, at the same time, justified the negro's claim to be a thorough-paced \"hyperkrite!\"  \"Where's the other one?\" demanded the captain angrily.  \"Escaped, captain!\" answered Peter.  \"How?  You must have helped him,\" cried the captain, drawing his ever-ready sword and pointing it at the breast of the negro, who fell upon his knees, clasped his great hands, and rolled his eyes in an apparent agony of terror.  \"Don't, captain.  I isn't wuth killin', an' w'en I's gone, who'd cook for you like me?  De man escaped by jumpin' out ob his body.  He's gone dead!\"  \"Fool!\" muttered the pirate, returning his sword to its sheath, \"bind that prisoner, and have him and the others ready to go on shore directly.\"  In a few seconds all the prisoners were ranged between the cabin hatchway and the mast.  The hands of most of the men were loosely tied, to prevent trouble in case desperation should impel any of them to assault their captors, but the old Dane and the women were left unfettered.  And now George Foster beheld, for the first time, the celebrated city, which was, at that period, the terror of the merchant vessels of all nations that had dealings with the Mediterranean shores.  A small pier and breakwater enclosed a harbour which was crowded with boats and shipping.  From this harbour the town rose abruptly on the side of a steep hill, and was surrounded by walls of great strength, which bristled with cannon.  The houses were small and square-looking, and in the midst, here and there, clusters of date-palms told of the almost tropical character of the climate, while numerous domes, minarets, and crescents told of the Moor and the religion of Mohammed.  But religion in its true sense had little footing in that piratical city, which subsisted on robbery and violence, while cruelty and injustice of the grossest kind were rampant.  Whatever Islamism may have taught them, it did not produce men or women who held the golden rule to be a virtue, and certainly few practised it.  Yet we would not be understood to mean that there were none who did so.  As there were Christians in days of old, even in Caesar's household, so there existed men and women who were distinguished by the Christian graces, even in the Pirate City.  Even there God had not left Himself without a witness.  As the vessel slowly entered the harbour under a very light breeze, she was boarded by several stately officers in the picturesque costume-- turbans, red leathern boots, etcetera--peculiar to the country.  After speaking a few minutes with the captain, one of the officers politely addressed the old Dane and his family through an interpreter; but as they spoke in subdued tones Foster could not make out what was said. Soon he was interrupted by a harsh order from an unknown Moor in an unknown tongue.  An angry order invariably raised in our hero the spirit of rebellion. He flushed and turned a fierce look on the Moor, but that haughty and grave individual was accustomed to such looks.  He merely repeated his order in a quiet voice, at the same time translating it by pointing to the boat alongside.  Foster felt that discretion was the better part of valour, all the more that there stood at the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21751"],["title","The Middy and the Moors: An Algerine Story (#4)"],["body","'s back five or six powerful Arabs, who seemed quite ready to enforce his instructions.  The poor middy glanced round to see if his only friend, Peter the Great, was visible, but he was not; so, with a flushed countenance at thus being compelled to put his pride in his pocket, he jumped into the boat, not caring very much whether he should break his neck by doing so with tied hands, or fall into the sea and end his life in a shark's maw!  In a few minutes he was landed on the mole or pier, and made to join a band of captives, apparently from many nations, who already stood waiting there.  Immediately afterwards the band was ordered to move on, and as they marched through the great gateway in the massive walls Foster felt as if he were entering the portals of Dante's Inferno, and had left all hope behind.  But his feelings misled him.  Hope, thank God! is not easily extinguished in the human breast.  As he tramped along the narrow and winding streets, which seemed to him an absolute labyrinth, he began to take interest in the curious sights and sounds that greeted him on every side, and his mind was thus a little taken off himself.  And there was indeed much there to interest a youth who had never seen Eastern manners or customs before.  Narrow and steep though the streets were--in some cases so steep that they formed flights of what may be styled broad and shallow stairs--they were crowded with bronzed men in varied Eastern costume; Moors in fez and gay vest and red morocco slippers; Turks with turban and pipe; Cabyles from the mountains; Arabs from the plains; water-carriers with jar on shoulder; Jews in sombre robes; Jewesses with rich shawls and silk kerchiefs as headgear; donkeys with panniers that almost blocked the way; camels, and veiled women, and many other strange sights that our hero had up to that time only seen in picture-books.  Presently the band of captives halted before a small door which was thickly studded with large nails.  It seemed to form the only opening in a high dead wall, with the exception of two holes about a foot square, which served as windows.  This was the Bagnio, or prison, in which the slaves were put each evening after the day's labour was over, there to feed and rest on the stone floor until daylight should call them forth again to renewed toil.  It was a gloomy courtyard, with cells around it in which the captives slept.  A fountain in the middle kept the floor damp and seemed to prove an attraction to various centipedes, scorpions, and other noisome creatures which were crawling about.  Here the captives just arrived had their bonds removed, and were left to their own devices, each having received two rolls of black bread before the jailor retired and locked them up for the night.  Taking possession of an empty cell, George Foster sat down on the stone floor and gazed at the wretched creatures around him, many of whom were devouring their black bread with ravenous haste.  The poor youth could hardly believe his eyes, and it was some time before he could convince himself that the whole thing was not a dream but a terrible reality.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE BAGNIO--OUR HERO SEES SOMETHING OF MISERY, AND IS SOLD AS A SLAVE.  There are some things in this world so unbelievable that even when we know them to be true we still remain in a state of semi-scepticism.  When our unfortunate midshipman awoke next morning, raised himself on his elbow, and felt that all his bones and muscles were stiff and pained from lying on a stone floor, it was some time before he could make out where he was, or recall the events of the last few days.  The first thing that revived his sluggish memory was the scuttling away, in anxious haste, of a scorpion that had sought and found comfortable quarters during the night under the lee of his right leg.  Starting up, he crushed the reptile with his foot.  \"You will get used to that,\" said a quietly sarcastic voice with a slightly foreign accent, close to him.  The speaker was a middle-aged man with grey hair, hollow cheeks, and deep sunken eyes.  \"They trouble us a little at first,\" he continued, \"but, as I have said, we get used to them.  It is long since I cared for scorpions.\"  \"Have you, then, been long here?\" asked Foster.  \"Yes.  Twelve years.\"  \"A prisoner?--a slave?\" asked the midshipman anxiously.  \"A prisoner, yes.  A slave, yes--a mummified man; a dead thing with life enough to work, but not yet quite a brute, more's the pity, for then I should not care!  But here I have been for twelve years--long, long years!  It has seemed to me an eternity.\"  \"It _is_ a long time to be a slave.  God help you, poor man!\" exclaimed Foster.  \"You will have to offer that prayer for yourself, young man,\" returned the other; \"you will need help more than I.  At first we are fools, but time makes us wise.  It even teaches Englishmen that they are not unconquerable.\"  The man spoke pointedly and in a harsh sarcastic tone which tended to check Foster's new-born compassion; nevertheless, he continued to address his fellow-sufferer in a sympathetic spirit.  \"You are not an Englishman, I think,\" he said, \"though you speak our language well.\"  \"No, I am French, but my wife is English.\"  \"Your wife!  Is she here also?\"  \"Thank God--no,\" replied the Frenchman, with a sudden burst of seriousness which was evidently genuine.  \"She is in England, trying to make up the sum of my ransom.  But she will never do it.  She is poor. She has her daughter to provide for besides herself, and we have no friends.  No, I have hoped for twelve years, and hope is now dead-- nearly dead.\"  The overwhelming thoughts that this information raised in Foster's mind rendered him silent for a few minutes.  The idea of the poor wife in England, toiling for twelve years almost hopelessly to ransom her husband, filled his susceptible heart with pity.  Then the thought of his mother and Minnie--who were also poor--toiling for years to procure his ransom, filled him with oppressive dread.  To throw the depressing subject off his mind, he asked how the Frenchman had guessed that he was an Englishman before he had heard him speak.  \"I know your countrymen,\" he answered, \"by their bearing.  Besides, you have been muttering in your sleep about `Mother and Minnie.'  If the latter is, as I suppose, your sweetheart--your _fiancee_--the sooner you get her out of your mind the better, for you will never see her more.\"  Again Foster felt repelled by the harsh cynicism of the man, yet at the same time he felt strangely attracted to him, a fact which he showed more by his tones than his words when he said--  \"My friend, you are not yet enrolled among the infallible prophets. Whether I shall ever again see those whom I love depends upon the will of God.  But I don't wonder that with your sad experience you should give way to despair.  For myself, I will cling to the hope that God will deliver me, and I would advise you to do the same.\"  \"How many I have seen, who had the sanguine temperament, like yours, awakened and crushed,\" returned the Frenchman.  \"See, there is one of them,\" he added, pointing to a cell nearly opposite, in which a form was seen lying on its back, straight and motionless.  \"That young man was such another as you are when he first came here.\"  \"Is he dead?\" asked the midshipman, with a look of pity.  \"Yes--he died in the night while you slept.  It was attending to him in his last moments that kept me awake.  He was nothing to me but a fellow-slave and sufferer, but I _was_ fond of him.  He was hard to conquer, but they managed it at last, for they beat him to death.\"  \"Then they did _not_ conquer him,\" exclaimed Foster with a gush of indignant pity.  \"To beat a man to death is to murder, not to conquer. But you called him a young man.  The corpse that lies there has thin grey hair and a wrinkled brow.\"  \"Nevertheless he was young--not more than twenty-seven--but six years of this life brought him to what you see.  He might have lived longer, as I have, had he been submissive!\"  Before Foster could reply, the grating of a rusty key in the door caused a movement as well as one or two sighs and groans among the slaves, for the keepers had come to summon them to work.  The Frenchman rose and followed the others with a hook of sullen indifference.  Most of them were without fetters, but a few strong young men wore chains and fetters more or less heavy, and Foster judged from this circumstance, as well as their expressions, that these were rebellious subjects whom it was difficult to tame.  Much to his surprise, the youth found that he was not called on to join his comrades in misfortune, but was left behind in solitude.  While casting about in his mind as to what this could mean, he observed in a corner the two rolls of black bread which he had received the previous night, and which, not being hungry at the time, he had neglected.  As a healthy appetite was by that time obtruding itself on his attention, he took hold of one and began to eat.  It was not attractive, but, not being particular, he consumed it.  He even took up the other and ate that also, after which he sighed and wished for more!  As there was no more to be had, he went to the fountain in the court and washed his breakfast down with water.  About two hours later the door was again opened, and a man in the uniform of a janissary entered.  Fixing a keen glance on the young captive, he bade him in broken English rise and follow.  By this time the lesson of submission had been sufficiently impressed on our hero to induce him to accord prompt obedience.  He followed his guide into the street, where he walked along until they arrived at a square, on one side of which stood a large mosque.  Here marketing was being carried on to a considerable extent, and, as he threaded his way through the various groups, he could not help being impressed with the extreme simplicity of the mode of procedure, for it seemed to him that all a man wanted to"]]]
