It had seemed to Bob that he had been entirely oblivious to his presence; and it did not appear to him now, as he sat with a book before him, waiting for the clock on the mantel to strike five, that existence at Mr. Medlin's promised to be a lively one. Still, as there were boys and girls, it must be more amusing than it would be at his uncle's and, at any rate, the clerk would not be so formidable a personage to deal with as Mr. Bale.  At one minute to five he went down, so as to open the counting house door as the clock struck. As he went in through the outer door, his uncle came out from the inner office.  \"Ah! There you are, Robert.  \"Mr. Medlin, this is my nephew who, as we have arranged, will take up his residence with you. I am afraid you will find him somewhat headstrong and troublesome. I have already informed you why it has been necessary to remove him from school. However, I trust that there will be no repetition of such follies; and that he will see the necessity of abandoning schoolboy pranks, and settling down to business.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Mr. Medlin replied, seeing that his employer expected an answer.  Bob had noticed that, although the clerk's eyes were directed upon him, there appeared to be no expression of interest or curiosity in them; but that they might as well have been fixed upon a blank wall.  \"Your boxes have already been sent round in the cart to Mr. Medlin's, Robert. I don't know that there is anything else to say. Mr. Medlin will, of course, put you in the way of your duties here; but if you have anything to say to me--any questions to ask, or any remarks, connected with the business, or otherwise, you wish to make--I shall always be ready to listen to you, if you will come into the counting house at half past four.\"  So saying, Mr. Bale retired into his private room again. Mr. Medlin placed his papers inside his desk, locked it, took off his coat and hung it on a peg, put on another coat and his hat, and then turned to Bob.  \"Ready?\"  \"Quite ready.\"  Mr. Medlin led the way out of the counting house, and Bob followed. Mr. Medlin walked fast, and Bob had to step out to keep up with him. The clerk appeared scarcely conscious of his presence, until they were beyond the more crowded thoroughfare, then he said:  \"Two miles, out Hackney way. Not too far!\"  \"Not at all,\" Bob replied. \"The farther the better.\"  \"No burglars there. Wouldn't pay.\"  And Bob thought that the shadow of a smile passed across his face.  \"We can do without them,\" Bob said.  \"Hate coming here, I suppose?\"  \"That I do,\" Bob said, cordially.  Mr. Medlin nodded.  \"Not so bad as it looks,\" he said, and then walked on again, in silence.  Presently there was a break in the houses. They were getting beyond the confines of business London.  \"Do you see this little garden?\" Mr. Medlin asked, suddenly, in a tone so unlike that in which he had before spoken that Bob quite started.  The lad looked at the little patch of ground, with some stunted shrubs, but could see nothing remarkable in it.  \"Yes, I see it, sir,\" he said.  \"That, Bob,\" Mr. Medlin went on, \"--for I suppose you are called Bob--marks the end of all things.\"  Bob opened his eyes in astonishment, and again examined the little garden.  \"It marks, Bob, the delimitation between London and country, between slavery and freedom. Here, every morning, I leave myself behind; here, every evening, I recover myself--or, at least, a considerable portion of myself--at a further mark, half a mile on, I am completely restored.  \"I suppose you used to find just the same thing, at the door of the schoolroom?\"  \"A good deal, sir,\" Bob said, in a much brighter tone than he had used, since he said goodbye to the fellows at Tulloch's.  \"I am glad you feel like that. I expect you will get like that, as to the city, in time; but mind, lad, you must always find yourself again. You stick to that. You make a mark somewhere, leave yourself behind in the morning, and pick yourself up again when you come back. It is a bad thing for those who forget to do that. They might as well hang themselves--better.  \"In there,\" and he jerked his thumb back over his shoulder, \"we are all machines, you know. It isn't us, not a bit of it. There is just the flesh, the muscle, the bones, and a frozen bit of our brains. The rest of us is left behind. If, as we come out, we forget to pick it up, we lose ourselves altogether, before long; and then there we are, machines to the end of our lives. You remember that, Bob. Keep it always in mind.\"  \"It is a pity that my uncle didn't get the same advice, forty years ago, Mr. Medlin.\"  \"It is a pity my employer did not marry. It is a pity my employer lives in that dull house, in that dull lane, all by himself,\" Mr. Medlin said, angrily.  \"But he has not got rid of himself, altogether. He is a good deal frozen up; but he thaws out, sometimes. What a man he would be, if he would but live out somewhere, and pick himself up regularly, as I do, every day!  \"This is my second mark, Bob, this tree growing out in the road. Now, you see, we are pretty well in the country.  \"Can you run?\"  \"Yes, I can run pretty well, Mr. Medlin.\"  \"Very well, Bob. You see that tree growing out beyond that garden wall, about four hundred yards on. It is four hundred and twenty, for I have measured it. Now then, you walk on fifty yards, and then run for your life. See if I don't catch you, before you are there.\"  Bob, wondering as he went along at the astounding change that had come over his companion, took fifty long steps; then he heard a shout of \"Now!\" and went off at the top of his speed. He was still a hundred yards from the mark, when he heard steps coming rapidly up behind him; and then the clerk dashed past him, and came in fully twenty yards ahead.  \"You don't run badly,\" he said, as Bob stopped, panting. \"My Jack generally comes to meet me, and I always give him seventy yards, and only beat him by about as much as I do you. He couldn't come, this afternoon. He is busy helping his mother to get things straight. I expect we shall meet him, presently.  \"Well, what are you laughing at?\"  \"I was just thinking how astonished my uncle would be, if he were to see us.\"  Mr. Medlin gave a hearty laugh.  \"Not so much as you would think, Bob. Five years ago, my employer suddenly asked me, just as we were shutting up one afternoon, if I was fond of fishing. I said that I used to be.  \"He said, 'I am going down, for a fortnight, into Hampshire. I have no one to go with--suppose you come with me.'  \"I said, 'I will.'  \"He said, 'Coach tomorrow morning, eight o'clock, Black Horse Yard.'  \"I was there. As we went over London Bridge I found myself, as usual; and he found himself. I explained to him that I could not help it. He said he didn't want me to help it. We had a glorious fortnight together, and we have been out every year, since. He never alludes to it, between times. No more do I. He is stiffer than usual for a bit. So am I. But we both know each other.  \"You do not suppose that he would have sent you to me, if he hadn't known that I have got another side to me?\"  \"Well, I should not have thought,\" Bob said, \"from the way he talked, when he introduced me to you, that he ever had such an idea in his mind.\"  \"He was obliged to talk so,\" Mr. Medlin said, laughing. \"We were just machines at the time, both of us. But he talked in quite a different way when we were down fishing together, three weeks ago. He said then you were rather a pickle, and that he didn't think you would do yourself any good where you were, so that he was going to bring you up to business.  \"'I don't want him to turn out a dull blockhead,' he said, 'and so I propose that you should take charge of him, and teach him to keep himself young. I wish I had done it, myself.'  \"And so it was settled.  \"There is no better employer in the city than your uncle. There is not a man or boy about the place who isn't well paid, and contented. I used to think myself a lucky man, before we went out fishing together for the first time but, six months after that, he gave me a rise that pretty well took my breath away.  \"Ah! Here come the young uns.\"  A couple of minutes later, four young people ran up. There was a boy about Bob's age, a girl a year younger, a boy, and another girl, in regular steps. They greeted their father with a joyous shout of welcome.  \"So you have got everything done,\" he said. \"I thought you would meet me somewhere here.  \"This is Bob Repton, my employer's nephew, and future member of the firm. Treat him with all respect, and handle him gently. He is a desperate fellow, though he doesn't look it. This is the young gentleman I told you of, who made a night expedition and captured four burglars.\"  After this introduction, Bob was heartily shaken by the hand, all round; and the party proceeded on their way, the two girls holding their father's hand, the boys walking behind, with Bob, who was so surprised at the unexpected turn affairs had taken that, for a time, he almost lost his usual readiness of speech.    Chapter 3: An Unexpected Journey.   Hawthorne Cottage, Mr. Medlin's abode, was a pretty little house, standing detached in a good-sized garden, surrounded by a high wall.  \"Here we are, mother,\" the clerk said, as he led the way into a cozy room, where tea was laid upon the table, while a bright fire blazed in the grate.  A very pleasant-faced lady, who did not look to Bob more than thirty--although she must have been four or five years older--greeted her husband affectionately.  \"My dear,\" he said, \"in the exuberance of your feelings, you forget that I have brought you home a visitor. This is Mr. Robert Repton. While he is resident in the house, he may be greeted as Bob. We had a race, and he runs faster than Jack; fifty yards, in four hundred and twenty, is the utmost I can give him.\"  \"What nonsense you do talk, Will!\" his wife said,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21788"],["title","Held Fast For England: A Tale of the Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) (#8)"],["body"," laughing. \"I am sure Master Repton must think you out of your mind.\"  \"It is a very jolly way of being out of his mind, Mrs. Medlin. You don't know how pleased I am.\"  \"He thought I was an ogre, my dear, and that you were an ogress.  \"Now let the banquet be served; for I am hungry, and I expect Bob is, too. As for the children, they are always hungry--at least, it seems so.\"  It was a merry meal, and Bob thought he had never enjoyed one as much, except at his sister's. After tea they had music; and he found that Mr. Medlin performed admirably on the violin, his wife played the spinet, Jack the clarionet, and Sophy--the eldest girl--the piccolo.  \"She is going to learn the harp, presently,\" Mr. Medlin explained; \"but for the present, when we have no visitors--and I don't count you one, after this evening--she plays the piccolo. She is a little shy about it, but shyness is the failing of my family.\"  \"It is very jolly,\" Bob said. \"I wish I could play an instrument.\"  \"We will see about it, in time, Bob. We want a French horn; but I don't see, at present, where you are to practise.\"  \"Has uncle ever been here?\" Bob asked, late in the evening.  \"Yes, he came here the evening we got back from our fishing expedition. He wanted to see the place, before he finally settled about you coming here. My wife was a little afraid of him; but there was no occasion, and everything went off capitally--except that Sophy would not produce her piccolo. I walked back with him, till he came upon a hackney coach.  \"He said as he got in, 'I have spent a most pleasant evening, Medlin. You are a very lucky fellow.'  \"I went back to work the next morning, and we both dropt into the old groove; and nothing more was said until yesterday, when he informed me that you would come, today.\"  \"Oh, dear!\" Bob said, as he started with the clerk, at eight o'clock on the following morning. \"Now I am going to begin at that wretched counting house.\"  \"No, you are not, Bob. You are not coming in there, at present. When your uncle and I were talking--when we were fishing, you know--he said that he saw no use in your going in there, at present; and thought it would be quite time for you to learn how the books are kept, in another three or four years; and that, till then, you could go into the cellar. You will learn bottling, and packing, and blending, and something about the quality and value of wines. You will find it much more pleasant than being shut up in a counting house, making out bills and keeping ledgers.\"  \"A great deal,\" Bob said, joyfully. \"I sha'n't mind that at all.\"  Bob observed a noticeable change in his companion's demeanour, when he arrived at the tree and, on passing the last garden, his face assumed a stolid expression; his brisk, springy walk settled down into a business pace; his words became few; and he was again a steady, and mechanical, clerk.  A fortnight later, Bob was summoned to the counting house.  \"Mr. Bale wishes to see you,\" Mr. Medlin said.  Bob entered, wondering what he was wanted for.  \"I received a subpoena, a week ago, Robert, for you to attend as a witness at Kingston tomorrow. These interruptions to business are very annoying. I did not mention it to you before for, if I had done so, you would be thinking of nothing else.  \"This morning I have received a letter from Admiral Langton, requesting me to allow you to go down by the stage, this afternoon, and to sleep at his house. He will take you over, in the morning; and you will sleep there again, tomorrow night, and come back by the early stage.  \"I trust that you will endeavour to curb your exuberance of spirits. This is a very grave matter, and anything like levity would be altogether out of place.  \"The letter says that the stage leaves the Bell Tavern at four o'clock.\"  Bob replied, gravely, that he would be there in time; and went off to his work again, until twelve o'clock.  When he arrived at the admiral's, at a quarter to six, a lad in midshipman's uniform came rushing out into the hall.  \"Hulloa, Bob!\"  \"Why, Jim!--but no, I suppose I ought to say Mr. James Sankey, to an officer of your importance. How comes it, sir, that you are so soon attired in His Majesty's uniform?\"  \"I will punch your head, Bob, if you go on with that nonsense.  \"But I say, isn't it jolly? The very afternoon after you left came down a big letter, with a tremendous seal; and therein I was informed that I was appointed to His Majesty's ship Brilliant, and was ordered to join immediately. Of course, I did not know what to do, so I came up here; and who do you think I found here? Captain Langton, the admiral's son, who is in command of the Brilliant.  \"Of course, it was he who had got me the appointment. He was very kind, and told me that I could not join until after this trial; so that I could go down home, and stop there, till today; and the admiral sent me straight off, to be measured for my uniform. When I started, next day, he gave me a letter to my father--an awfully nice letter it was, saying that he intended to present me with my first outfit. I got here about an hour ago, and have been putting on my uniform, to see how it fitted.\"  \"You mean to see how you looked in it, Jim? It looks first rate. I wish I was in one too, and was going with you, instead of sticking in Philpot Lane.\"  \"I am awfully sorry for you, Bob. It must be beastly.\"  \"Well, it is not so bad as I expected, Jim, and uncle is turning out much better; and I don't live there, but with the head clerk, out at Hackney. He is an awfully jolly sort of fellow--you never saw such a rum chap. I will tell you all about it, afterwards.  \"I suppose I ought to go in, and see the admiral.\"  \"He is out, at present, Bob. He will be back at eight o'clock to supper, so you can come up and tell me all about it. Captain Langton is here, too.\"  Captain Langton spoke very kindly to Bob, when the two boys came down to supper; and told him that if, at any time, he changed his mind, and there was a vacancy for a midshipman on board his ship, he would give him the berth.  \"I should be very glad to have you with me,\" he said, \"after the service you rendered my father and sister.\"  On the following morning, Fullarton and Wharton came up from the school, and two carriages conveyed the witnesses over to Kingston. The prisoners, Bob heard, were notorious and desperate criminals, whom the authorities had long been anxious to lay hands on. The butler was one of the gang, and had obtained his post by means of a forged character. The trial only occupied two hours for, taken in the act as the men were, there was no defence whatever. All four were sentenced to be hung, and the judge warmly complimented the four boys upon their conduct in the matter.  The next morning, Bob returned to his work in the city.  For the next three months, his existence was a regular one. On arriving in the cellar, he took off his jacket and put on a large apron, that completely covered him; and from that time until five o'clock he worked with the other boys: bottling, packing, storing the bottles away in the bins, or taking them down as required. He learned, from the foreman, something of the localities from which the wine came, their value and prices; but had not begun to distinguish them by taste, or bouquet. Mr. Bale, the foreman said, had given strict orders that he was not to begin tasting, at present.  Three days before Christmas, one of the clerks brought him down word that Mr. Bale wished to see him in the office, at five o'clock.  During the three, months he had scarcely spoken to his uncle. The latter had nodded to him, whenever he came into the cellar; and had regularly said, \"Well, Robert, how are you getting on?\"  To which he had, as regularly, replied, \"Very well, uncle.\"  He supposed that the present meeting was for the purpose of inviting him to dine at Philpot Lane, on Christmas Day; and although he knew that he should enjoy the festivity more, at Hackney, he was prepared to accept it very willingly.  \"I have sent for you, Robert,\" Mr. Bale said, when he entered his office, \"to say that your sister has written to ask me to go down to spend Christmas with her, at Portsmouth. As her husband's regiment is on the point of going abroad, I have decided on accepting her invitation and, for the same reason, I shall take you down with me. You will therefore have your box packed, tonight. I shall send down a cart to fetch it, tomorrow. You will sleep here tomorrow night, and we start the next morning.\"  \"Thank you very much, uncle,\" Bob said, in delight; and then, seeing that nothing further was expected of him, he ran off to join Mr. Medlin, who was waiting for him outside.  \"What do you think, Mr. Medlin? I am going down to spend Christmas at my sister's.\"  \"Ah!\" the clerk said, in a dull unsympathetic voice. \"Well, mind how you walk, Mr. Robert. It does not look well, coming out from a place of business as if you were rushing out of school.\"  Bob knew well enough that it was no use, whatever, trying to get his companion to take any interest in matters unconnected with business, at present; so he dropped into his regular pace, and did not open his lips again, until they had passed the usual boundary.  Then Mr. Medlin said, briskly, \"So you are going down to your sister's, Bob!\"  \"Yes, that will be first rate, won't it? Of course, I went down in the summer to Canterbury, and hardly expected to go again this year. As I have only been three months here, I did not even think of going.  \"It will be the last holiday I shall have, for some time. You know Carrie said, when she wrote to me a month ago, that the regiment expected to be ordered abroad soon; and uncle said it is on the point of going, now.  \"He is coming down with me.\"  His voice fell a little, at this part of the announcement.  \"He is, eh? You think you will have to be on your best behaviour, Bob?\"  \"Before you told me about him, Mr. Medlin, I should have thought it would quite spoil the holiday. But I"]]]
