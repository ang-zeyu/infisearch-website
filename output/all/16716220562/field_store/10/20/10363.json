I shouldn't wonder, now, if that chap was a slave-trader.\"  \"The same idea has occurred to myself, Disco,\" replied Harold, \"and I would willingly leave him if I thought there was a town or village within twenty miles of us; but we are ignorant on that point and I have heard enough of the African climate to believe that it might cost us our lives if we were obliged to spend a night in the jungle without fire, food, or covering, and with nothing on but a wet flannel shirt and pair of canvas breeches.  No, no, lad, we must not risk it.  Besides, although some Arabs are slave-traders, it does not follow that all are. This fellow may turn out better than he looks.\"  Disco Lillihammer experienced some sensations of surprise on hearing his young friend's remarks on the climate, for he knew nothing whatever about that of Africa, having sailed chiefly in the Arctic Seas as a whaler,--and laboured under the delusion that no climate under the sun could in any degree affect his hardy and well-seasoned frame.  He was too respectful, however, to let his thoughts be known.  Meanwhile the Arab returned.  \"I sail this night,\" he said, \"when moon go down.  That not far before midnight.  You mus keep by boat here--close.  If you go this way or that the niggers kill you.  They not come _here_; they know I is here.  I go look after my goods and chattels--my Black Ivory.\"  \"Mayn't we go with 'ee, mister--what's your name?\"  \"My name?--Yoosoof,\" replied the Arab, in a tone and with a look which were meant to command respect.  \"Well, Mister Yoosoof,\" continued Disco, \"if we may make bold to ax leave for to go with 'ee, we could lend 'ee a helpin' hand, d'ye see, to carry yer goods an' chattels down to the boat.\"  \"There is no need,\" said Yoosoof, waving his hand, and pointing to the hut before mentioned.  \"Go; you can rest till we sail.  Sleep; you will need it.  There is littil rice in hut--eat that, and make fire, dry youselfs.\"  So saying, the Arab left them by a path leading into the woods, along which his men, who were Portuguese half-castes, had preceded him.  \"Make fire indeed!\" exclaimed Disco, as he walked with his companion to the hut; \"one would think, from the free-and-easy way in which he tells us to make it, that he's in the habit himself of striking it out o' the point o' his own nose, or some such convenient fashion.\"  \"More likely to flash it out of his eyes, I should think,\" said Harold; \"but, see here, the fellow knew what he was talking about.  There is fire among these embers on the hearth.\"  \"That's true,\" replied Disco, going down on his knees, and blowing them carefully.  In a few minutes a spark leaped into a flame, wood was heaped on, and the flame speedily became a rousing fire, before which they dried their garments, while a pot of rice was put on to boil.  Scarcely had they proceeded thus far in their preparations, when two men, armed with muskets, were seen to approach, leading a negro girl between them.  As they drew nearer, it was observable that the girl had a brass ring round her neck, to which a rope was attached.  \"A slave!\" exclaimed Disco vehemently, while the blood rushed to his face; \"let's set her free!\"  The indignant seaman had half sprung to his legs before Harold seized and pulled him forcibly back.  \"Be quiet man,\" said Harold quickly.  \"If we _could_ free her by fighting, I would help you, but we can't.  Evidently we have got into a nest of slavers.  Rashness will only bring about our own death.  Be wise; bide your time, and we may live to do some good yet.\"  He stopped abruptly, for the new comers had reached the top of the winding path that led to the hut.  A look of intense surprise overspread the faces of the two men when they entered and saw the Englishmen sitting comfortably by the fire, and both, as if by instinct threw forward the muzzles of their muskets.  \"Oh! come in, come in, make your minds easy,\" cried Disco, in a half-savage tone, despite the warning he had received; \"we're all _friends_ here--leastwise we can't help ourselves.\"  Fortunately for our mariner the men did not understand him, and before they could make up their minds what to think of it, or how to act Harold rose, and, with a polite bow, invited them to enter.  \"Do you understand English?\" he asked.  A frown, and a decided shake of the head from both men, was the reply. The poor negro girl cowered behind her keepers, as if she feared that violence were about to ensue.  Having tried French with a like result, Harold uttered the name, \"Yoosoof,\" and pointed in the direction in which the trader had entered the woods.  The men looked intelligently at each other, and nodded.  Then Harold said \"Zanzibar,\" and pointed in the direction in which he supposed that island lay.  Again the men glanced at each other, and nodded.  Harold next said \"Boat--dhow,\" and pointed towards the creek, which remark and sign were received as before.  \"Good,\" he continued, slapping himself on the chest, and pointing to his companion, \"_I_ go to Zanzibar, _he_ goes, _she_ goes,\" (pointing to the girl), \"_you_ go, and Yoosoof goes--all in the dhow together to Zanzibar--to-night--when moon goes down.  D'ee understand?  Now then, come along and have some rice.\"  He finished up by slapping one of the men on the shoulder, and lifting the kettle off the fire, for the rice had already been cooked and only wanted warming.  The men looked once again at each other, nodded, laughed, and sat down on a log beside the fire, opposite to the Englishmen.  They were evidently much perplexed by the situation, and, not knowing what to make of it, were disposed in the meantime to be friendly.  While they were busy with the rice, Disco gazed in silent wonder, and with intense pity, at the slave-girl, who sat a little to one side of her guardians on a mat, her small hands folded together resting on one knee, her head drooping, and her eyes cast down.  The enthusiastic tar found it very difficult to restrain his feelings.  He had heard, of course, more or less about African slavery from shipmates, but he had never read about it, and had never seriously given his thoughts to it, although his native sense of freedom, justice, and fair-play had roused a feeling of indignation in his breast whenever the subject chanced to be discussed by him and his mates.  But now, for the first time in his life, suddenly and unexpectedly, he was brought face to face with slavery.  No wonder that he was deeply moved.  \"Why, Mister Seadrift,\" he said, in the confidential tone of one who imparts a new discovery, \"I do honestly confess to 'ee that I think that's a _pretty_ girl!\"  \"I quite agree with you,\" replied Harold, smiling.  \"Ay, but I mean _really_ pretty, you know.  I've always thought that all niggers had ugly flat noses an' thick blubber lips.  But look at that one: her lips are scarce a bit thicker than those of many a good-looking lass in England, and they don't stick out at all, and her nose ain't flat a bit.  It's quite as good as my Nancy's nose, an' that's sayin' a good deal, _I_ tell 'ee.  Moreover, she ain't black--she's brown.\"  It is but justice to Disco to say that he was right in his observations, and to explain that the various negro tribes in Africa differ very materially from each other; some of them, as we are told by Dr Livingstone, possessing little of what, in our eyes, seems the characteristic ugliness of the negro--such as thick lips, flat noses, protruding heels, etcetera,--but being in every sense handsome races of humanity.  The slave-girl whom Disco admired and pitied so much belonged to one of these tribes, and, as was afterwards ascertained, had been brought from the far interior.  She appeared to be very young, nevertheless there was a settled expression of meek sorrow and suffering on her face; and though handsomely formed, she was extremely thin, no doubt from prolonged hardships on the journey down to the coast.  \"Here, have somethin' to eat,\" exclaimed Disco, suddenly filling a tin plate with rice, and carrying it to the girl, who, however, shook her head without raising her eyes.  \"You're not hungry, poor thing,\" said the seaman, in a disappointed tone; \"you look as if you should be.  Come, try it,\" he added, stooping, and patting her head.  The poor child looked up as if frightened, and shrank from the seaman's touch, but on glancing a second time in his honest face, she appeared to feel confidence in him.  Nevertheless, she would not touch the rice until her guardians said something to her sternly, when she began to eat with an appetite that was eloquent.  \"Come, now, tell us what your name is, lass,\" said Disco, when she had finished the rice.  Of course the girl shook her head, but appeared to wish to understand the question, while the Portuguese laughed and seemed amused with the Englishman's eccentricities.  \"Look here, now,\" resumed the tar, slapping his own chest vigorously, \"Disco, Disco, Disco, that's me--Disco.  And this man,\" (patting his companion on the breast) \"is Harold, Harold, that's him--Harold.  Now, then,\" he added, pointing straight at the girl, \"you--what's you name, eh?\"  A gleam of intelligence shot from the girl's expressive eyes, and she displayed a double row of beautiful teeth as in a low soft voice she said--\"Azinte.\"  \"Azinte? come, that's not a bad name; why, it's a capital one.  Just suited to 'ee.  Well, Azinte, my poor girl,\" said Disco, with a fresh outburst of feeling, as he clenched his horny right hand and dashed it into the palm of his left, \"if I only knew how to set you free just now, my dear, I'd do it--ay, if I was to be roasted alive for so doin'.  I would!\"  \"You'll never set anybody free in this world,\" said Harold Seadrift, with some severity, \"if you go on talking and acting as you have done to-day.  If these men had not, by good fortune, been ignorant of our language, it's my opinion that they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21748"],["title","Black Ivory (#3)"],["body"," have blown our brains out before this time.  You should restrain yourself, man,\" he continued, gradually dropping into a remonstrative and then into an earnestly confidential tone; \"we are utterly helpless just now.  If you did succeed in freeing that girl at this moment, it would only be to let her fall into the hands of some other slave-owner.  Besides, that would not set free all the other slaves, male and female, who are being dragged from the interior of Africa.  You and I _may_ perhaps do some small matter in the way of helping to free slaves, if we keep quiet and watch our opportunity, but we shall accomplish nothing if you give way to useless bursts of anger.\"  Poor Lillihammer was subdued.  \"You're right Mister Seadrift, you're right, sir, and I'm a ass.  I never _could_ keep my feelings down.  It's all along of my havin' bin made too much of by my mother, dear old woman, w'en I was a boy.  But I'll make a effort, sir; I'll clap a stopper on 'em--bottle 'em up and screw 'em down tight, werry tight indeed.\"  Disco again sent his right fist into the palm of his left hand, with something like the sound of a pistol-shot to the no small surprise and alarm of the Portuguese, and, rising, went out to cool his heated brow in the open air.    CHAPTER TWO.  YOOSOOF'S \"BLACK IVORY.\"  When Yoosoof entered the woods, as before stated, for the purpose of looking after his property, he followed a narrow footpath for about half a mile, which led him to another part of the same creek, at the entrance of which we introduced him to the reader.  Here, under the deep shadow of umbrageous trees, floated five large Arab boats, or dhows, similar to the one which has been already referred to.  They were quite empty, and apparently unguarded, for when Yoosoof went down the bank and stood on a projecting rock which overlooked them, no one replied to his low-toned hail.  Repeating it once, and still receiving no answer, he sat quietly down on the rocks, lighted a small pipe, and waited patiently.  The boats, as we have said, were empty, but there were some curious appliances in them, having the appearance of chains, and wristlets, and bars of iron running along and fixed to their decks, or rather to the flooring of their holds.  Their long yards and sails were cleared and ready for hoisting.  After the lapse of ten or fifteen minutes, Yoosoof raised his head--for he had been meditating deeply, if one might judge from his attitude--and glanced in the direction of an opening in the bushes whence issued a silent and singular train of human beings.  They were negroes, secured by the necks or wrists--men, women, and children,--and guarded by armed half-caste Portuguese.  When a certain number of them, about a hundred or so, had issued from the wood, and crowded the banks of the creek, they were ordered to stand still, and the leader of the band advanced towards his master.  These were some of Yoosoof's \"goods and chattels,\" his \"cattle,\" his \"black ivory.\"  \"You have been long in coming, Moosa,\" said the Arab trader, as the man approached.  \"I have,\" replied Moosa, somewhat gruffly, \"but the road was rough and long, and the cattle were ill-conditioned, as you see.\"  The two men spoke in the Portuguese tongue, but as the natives and settlers on that coast speak a variety of languages and dialects, we have no alternative, good reader, but to render all into English.  \"Make the more haste now,\" said Yoosoof; \"get them shipped at once, for we sail when the moon goes down.  Pick out the weakest among the lot, those most likely to die, and put them by themselves in the small dhow. If we _must_ sacrifice some of our wares to these meddling dogs the English, we may as well give them the refuse.\"  Without remark, Moosa turned on his heel and proceeded to obey orders.  Truly, to one unaccustomed to such scenes, it would have appeared that all the negroes on the spot were \"most likely to die,\" for a more wretched, starved set of human beings could scarcely be imagined.  They had just terminated a journey on foot of several hundreds of miles, with insufficient food and under severe hardships.  Nearly all of them were lean to a degree,--many so reduced that they resembled nothing but skeletons with a covering of black leather.  Some of the children were very young, many of them mere infants, clinging to the backs of the poor mothers, who had carried them over mountain and plain, through swamp and jungle, in blistering sunshine and pelting rain for many weary days. But prolonged suffering had changed the nature of these little ones. They were as silent and almost as intelligently anxious as their seniors.  There were no old pieces of merchandise there.  Most were youthful or in the prime of life; a few were middle-aged.  Difficult though the task appeared to be, Moosa soon selected about fifty men and women and a few children, who were so fearfully emaciated that their chance of surviving appeared but small.  These were cast loose and placed in a sitting posture in the hold of the smallest dhow, as close together as they could be packed.  Their removal from the bank made room for more to issue from the wood, which they did in a continuous stream.  Batch after batch was cast loose and stowed away in the manner already described, until the holds of two of the large boats were filled, each being capable of containing about two hundred souls.  This was so far satisfactory to Yoosoof, who had expended a good deal of money on the venture--satisfactory, even although he had lost a large proportion of the goods--four-fifths at least if not more, by death and otherwise, on the way down to the coast; but that was a matter of little consequence.  The price of black ivory was up in the market just at that time, and the worthy merchant could stand a good deal of loss.  The embarkation was effected with wonderful celerity, and in comparative silence.  Only the stern voices of the half-caste Portuguese were heard as they ordered the slaves to move, mingled with the occasional clank of a chain, but no sounds proceeded from the thoroughly subdued and worn-out slaves louder than a sigh or a half-suppressed wail, with now and then a shriek of pain when some of the weaker among them were quickened into activity by the lash.  When all had been embarked, two of the five boats still remained empty, but Yoosoof had a pretty good idea of the particular points along the coast where more \"cattle\" of a similar kind could be purchased. Therefore, after stationing some of his men, armed with muskets, to guard the boats, he returned with the remainder of them to the hut in which the Englishmen had been left.  There he found Azinte and her guardians.  He seemed angry with the latter at first, but after a few minutes' thought appeared to recover his equanimity, and ordered the men to remove the ropes with which the girl was tethered; then bidding her follow him he left the hut without taking any notice of the Englishmen further than to say he would be back shortly before the time of sailing.  Yoosoof's motions were usually slow and his mien somewhat dignified, but, when occasion required, he could throw off his Oriental dignity and step out with the activity of a monkey.  It was so on this occasion, insomuch that Azinte was obliged occasionally to run in order to keep up with him.  Proceeding about two miles in the woods along the shore without halt, he came out at length on the margin of a bay, at the head of which lay a small town.  It was a sorry-looking place, composed of wretchedly built houses, most of which were thatched with the leaves of the cocoa-nut palm.  Nevertheless, such as it was, it possessed a mud fort, an army of about thirty soldiers, composed of Portuguese convicts who had been sent there as a punishment for many crimes, a Governor, who was understood to be honourable, having been placed there by his Excellency the Governor-General at Mozambique, who had been himself appointed by His Most Faithful Majesty the King of Portugal.  It was in quest of this Governor that Yoosoof bent his rapid steps. Besides all the advantages above enumerated, the town drove a small trade in ivory, ebony, indigo, orchella weed, gum copal, cocoa-nut oil, and other articles of native produce, and a very large (though secret) trade in human bodies and--we had almost written--souls, but the worthy people who dwelt there could not fetter souls, although they could, and very often did, set them free.  Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, the Governor, was seated at the open window of his parlour, just before Yoosoof made his appearance, conversing lightly with his only daughter, the Senhorina Maraquita, a beautiful brunette of about eighteen summers, who had been brought up and educated in Portugal.  The Governor's wife had died a year before this time in Madrid, and the Senhorina had gone to live with her father on the east coast of Africa, at which place she had arrived just six weeks previous to the date of the opening of our tale.  Among the various boats and vessels at anchor in the bay, were seen the tapering masts of a British war-steamer.  The Senhorina and her sire were engaged in a gossiping criticism of the officers of this vessel when Yoosoof was announced.  Audience was immediately granted.  Entering the room, with Azinte close behind him, the Arab stopped abruptly on beholding Maraquita, and bowed gravely.  \"Leave us, my child,\" said the Governor, in Portuguese; \"I have business to transact with this man.\"  \"And why may not I stay to assist you, father, in this wonderful man-mystery of transacting business?\" asked Maraquita, with an arch smile.  \"Whenever you men want to get rid of women you frighten them away with _business_!  If you wish not to explain something to us, you shake your wise heads, and call it _business_!  Is it not so?--Come, Arab,\" she added, turning with a sprightly air to Yoosoof, \"you are a trader, I suppose; all Arabs are, I am told."]]]
