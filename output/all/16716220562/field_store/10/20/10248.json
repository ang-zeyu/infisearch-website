To be generally helpful was one of the chief points in the character of Charlie Brooke.  He was evidently born to aid mankind.  He began by helping himself to everything in life that seemed at all desirable.  This was natural, not selfish.  At first there were few things, apparently, that did seem to his infant mind desirable, for his earliest days were marked by a sort of chronic crossness that seemed quite unaccountable in one so healthy; but this was eventually traced to the influence of pins injudiciously disposed about the person by nurse.  Possibly this experience may have tended to develop a spirit of brave endurance, and might perhaps account for the beautiful modifications of character that were subsequently observed in him.  At all events, sweet, patient amiability was a prevailing feature in the boy long before the years of infancy were over, and this heavenly aspect of him was pleasantly diversified, in course of time, by occasional displays of resolute--we might almost say heroic--self-will, which proved a constant source of mingled pride and alarm to his widowed mother.  From a very early period of life little Charlie manifested an intense desire, purpose, and capacity for what may be called his life-work of rescuing human beings from trouble and danger.  It became a passion with him as years rolled on, and was among the chief means that brought about the changes in his chequered career.  Appropriately enough he began--almost in babyhood--by rescuing himself!  It happened thus.  One day, when he had reached the immature age of five, he was left in the nursery for a few moments in company with a wash-tub, in which his mother had been cleansing the household linen.  Mrs Brooke, it may be remarked, although in the middle ranks of life, was very much below the middle ranks in financial prosperity, and had therefore to perform much household drudgery.  Charlie's earnest desire to please and obey his mother constantly came into collision with that self-will to which we have referred. Separately, these qualities may perhaps work quietly, at least as regards their possessor, but unitedly they form a mixture which is apt to become explosive in early youth.  \"Don't touch the tub, Charlie; I'll be back directly,\" said Mrs Brooke, as she was leaving the nursery.  \"Don't even go near it.\"  \"No, muvver, I won't.\"  He spoke with much decision, for he adored water--not to drink but to play with--and seemed to realise the danger of his position, and the necessity for self-control.  The temptation to avail himself of the chance, however, was almost too much for him.  Feeling that an internal conflict was pending, he toddled to the fire, turned his back to it _a la_ paterfamilias, and glared at the tub, resolved, come what might, to be \"dood.\"  But fate was against him!  Suddenly he became aware that something more than radiated heat was operating in rear.  He glanced behind.  His cotton tunic was in flames! In the twinkling of an eye he was seated in the wash-tub, his hands clasped in horror as he thought of his guilt, and the flames thoroughly extinguished!  The solemn glare and pursed mouth with which he met his mother's look of blank amazement may be imagined but cannot be described--he looked so quiet, too, and so evidently contented, for the warm water was congenial!  \"O Charlie! did I not say that--\"  \"Yes, muvver, but I'm bu'nt.\"  The fearsome and dripping black patch which presented itself to the agonised mother when she lifted him out of the tub sufficiently enlightened her and exonerated the child, but her anxiety was not relieved till she had stripped him naked and ascertained for certain that no scrap of his fair skin had been injured.  This may be said to have been the real commencement of Charlie Brooke's career.  We mention it chiefly to show that our hero was gifted with some power of ready resource even in childhood.  He was also gifted with a fearless and daring disposition, a quietly enthusiastic spirit, a modest mien, and a strong muscular body.  Of course these admirable qualities were not fully developed in childhood, but the seeds were there.  In due time the plants came up and the flowers bloomed.  We would here caution the reader--especially the youthful reader-- against supposing that from this point our hero was engaged in rescue-work, and continued at it ever after without intermission.  Like Samson, with his great strength, he exercised his powers only now and then--more than half unconscious of what was in him--and on many occasions without any definite purpose in view.  His first act of heroism was exercised, when he had reached the age of nine, in behalf of a kitten.  It was on a magnificent summer day, soon after he had been sent to the village school, that the incident occurred.  Charlie was walking at the time with one of his school-fellows named Shank Leather.  Shank was a little older than himself, and a good enough fellow in his way, but much given to boasting, and possessed of very few of the fine qualities that characterised our hero.  The two were out for a holiday-ramble, a long way from home, and had reached a river on the banks of which they sat down to enjoy their mid-day meal.  The meal was simple, and carried in their pockets.  It consisted of two inch-and-a-half-thick slices of bread, with two lumps of cheese to match.  \"I wish this river was nearer home,\" said Shank Leather, as they sat down under a spreading oak to dine.  \"Why?\" asked his companion, with a felicitous brevity and straightforwardness which occasionally marked his conversation.  \"Because then I would have a swim in it everyday.\"  \"Can you swim?\" asked Charlie, a slight elevation of the eyebrows indicating surprise not unmingled with admiration--for our hero was a hero-worshipper.  He could not well have been a hero otherwise!  \"Of course I can swim,\" returned Shank; \"that is to say, a little; but I feel sure that I'll be a splendid swimmer some day.\"  His companion's look of admiration increased.  \"What'll you take to drink?\" asked Shank, drawing a large flask from the pocket in which he had concealed it up to that moment with the express purpose of giving his companion a pleasant surprise.  It may be well to add that the variety of dunks implied in his question was imaginary.  Shank had only one flask, but in the exuberance of convivial generosity he quoted his own father--who was addicted to \"the bottle.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Brooke, in curious expectancy.  \"Taste and see,\" said his friend, uncorking the flask.  Charlie tasted, but did not \"see,\" apparently, for he looked solemn, and tasted again.  \"It's liquorice-water,\" said Shank, with the look of one who expects approval.  \"I made it myself!\"  Nauseous in the extreme, it might have served the purpose of an emetic had not the digestion of the boys been ostrich-like, but, on hearing how it came into existence, Charlie put it a third time to his lips, took a good gulp, and then, nodding his head as he wiped his mouth with his cuff, declared that it was \"wonderful.\"  \"Yes, isn't it?  There's not many fellows could make stuff like that.\"  \"No, indeed,\" assented the other heartily, as he attacked the bread and cheese.  \"Does your father know you made it?\"  \"Oh yes, and he tasted it too--he'd taste anything in the shape of drink--but he spat it out, and then washed his mouth with brandy an' water.  Mother took some too, and she said she had tasted worse drinks; and she only wished that father would take to it.  That made father laugh heartily.  Then I gave some to little May, and she said it was `So nice.'\"  \"Ay.  That was like little May,\" remarked Charlie, with a quiet laugh; \"she'd say that a mess o' tar an' shoe-blacking was nice if _you_ made it.  But I say, Shank, let's see you swim.  I'd give anything if I could swim.  Do, like a brick as you are.  There's a fine deep hole here under the bank.\"  He pointed to a pool in the river where the gurgling eddies certainly indicated considerable depth of water, but his friend shook his head.  \"No, Charlie,\" he said, \"you don't understand the danger as I do.  Don't you see that the water runs into the hole at such a rate that there's a tree-mendous eddy that would sweep any man off his legs--\"  \"But you're goin' to swim, you know,\" interrupted his friend, \"an' have got to be off your legs anyhow!\"  \"That's all _you_ know,\" returned the other.  \"If a man's swept round by an eddy, don't you know, he'll be banged against things, and then the water rushes out of the hole with _such_ a gush, an' goes thunderin' down below, over boulders and stones, and--an'--don't you see?\"  \"That's true, Shank; it does look dangerous, even for a man that can swim.\"  He put such emphasis on the \"man\" that his comrade glanced sharply at him, but the genuine innocence of our hero's face was too obvious to suggest irony.  He simply saw that the use of the word _man_ pleased his friend, therefore he used it.  Conversation was cut short at this point by the sudden appearance on the scene of two strangers--a kitten and a dog.  The assertion that \"dogs delight to bark and bite\" is, perhaps, too sweeping, but then it was made by a poet and poets have an acknowledged licence--though not necessarily a dog-licence.  Certain it is, however, that this dog--a mongrel cur--did bark with savage delight, and display all its teeth, with an evident desire to bite, as it chased a delirious tortoise-shell kitten towards the river.  It was a round, soft, lively kitten, with the hair on its little body sticking straight out, its heart in its mouth, and horror in its lovely eyes.  It made straight for the tree under which the dinner was going on.  Both boys started up.  Enemies in front and rear!  Even a human general might have stood appalled.  Two courses were still open--right and left.  The kitten turned right and went wrong, for that was the river-side.

It reached the edge of the pool, spread out all its legs with a caterwaul of despair, and went headlong into the water.  Shank Leather gazed--something like glee mingled with his look of consternation.  Not so our hero.  Pity was bursting his bosom.  With one magnificent bound he went into the pool, caught the kitten in his right hand, and carried it straight to the bottom.  Next moment he re-appeared on the surface, wildly beating the water with one hand and holding the kitten aloft in the other.  Shank, to do him justice, plunged into the river up to his waist, but his courage carried him no further.  There he stuck, vainly holding out a hand and shouting for help.  But no help was near, and it seemed as if the pair of strugglers were doomed to perish when a pitiful eddy swept them both out of the deep pool into the foaming rapid below.  Shank followed them in howling despair, for here things looked ten times worse: his comrade being tossed from billow to breaker, was turned heels over head, bumped against boulders, stranded on shallows, overturned and swept away again--but ever with the left arm beating wildly, and the right hand with the kitten, held high in air.  But the danger, except from being dashed against the boulders, was not really as great as it seemed, for every time that Brooke got a foothold for an instant, or was driven on a rock, or was surged, right-end-up, on a shoot of water, he managed to gasp a little air--including a deal of water.  The kitten, of course, had the same chances, and, being passive, perhaps suffered less.  At the foot of the rapid they were whirled, as if contemptuously, into an eddy.  Shank was there, as deep as he dared venture.  He even pushed in up to the arm-pits, and, catching his comrade by the hair, dragged him to bank.  \"O Charlie, I've saved ye!\" he exclaimed, as his friend crawled out and sat down.  \"Ay, an' you've saved the kitten too!\" replied his friend, examining the poor animal.  \"It's dead,\" said Shank; \"dead as mutton.\"  \"No, only stunned.  No wonder, poor beast!\"  With tender care the rescuer squeezed the water from the fur of the rescued.  Then, pulling open his vest and shirt, he was about to place the kitten in his bosom to warm it.  \"No use doin' that,\" said Leather.  \"You're as wet an' nigh as cold as itself.\"  \"That's true.  Sit down here,\" returned Brooke, in a tone of command which surprised his comrade.  \"Open your shirt.\"  Again Shank obeyed wonderingly.  Next moment he gave a gasp as the cold, wet creature was thrust into his warm bosom.  \"It makes me shiver all over,\" he said.  \"Never mind,\" replied his friend coolly, as he got up and wrung the water out of his own garments.  \"It's beginning to move, Charlie,\" said Shank, after a few minutes.  \"Give it here, then.\"  The creature was indeed showing feeble symptoms of revival, so Brooke-- whose bosom was not only recovering its own heat, but was beginning to warm the wet garments--thrust it into his own breast, and the two friends set off homeward at a run.  At the nearest house they made inquiry as to the owner of the kitten, but failed to find one.  Our hero therefore resolved to carry it home. Long before that haven was reached, however, his clothes were nearly dry, and the rescued one was purring sweetly, in childlike innocence-- all the horrors, sufferings, and agonies of the past forgotten, apparently, in the enjoyment of the present.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE SHIPWRECK.  We have no intention of carrying our reader on step by step through all the adventures and deeds of Charlie Brooke.  It is necessary to hasten over his boyhood, leaving untold the many battles fought, risks run, and dangers encountered.  He did not cut much of a figure at the village school--though he did his best, and was fairly successful--but in the playground he reigned supreme.  At football, cricket, gymnastics, and, ultimately, at swimming, no one could come near him.  This was partly owing to his great physical strength, for, as time passed by he shot upwards and outwards in a way that surprised his companions and amazed his mother, who was a distinctly little woman--a neat graceful little woman--with, like her stalwart son, a modest opinion of herself.  As a matter of course, Charlie's school-fellows almost worshipped him, and he was always so willing to help and lead them in all cases of danger or emergency, that \"Charlie to the rescue!\" became quite a familiar cry on the playground.  Indeed it would have been equally appropriate in the school, for the lad never seemed to be so thoroughly happy as when he was assisting some boy less capable than himself to master his lessons.  About the time that Charlie left school, while yet a stripling, he had the shoulders of Samson, the chest of Hercules, and the limbs of Apollo. He was tall also--over six feet--but his unusual breadth deceived people as to this till they stood close to him.  Fair hair, close and curly, with bright blue eyes and a permanent look of grave benignity, completes our description of him.  Rowing, shooting, fishing, boxing, and swimming seemed to come naturally to him, and all of them in a superlative degree.  Swimming was, perhaps, his most loved amusement and in this art he soon far outstripped his friend Leather.  Some men are endowed with exceptional capacities in regard to water.  We have seen men go into the sea warm and come out warmer, even in cold weather.  Experience teaches that the reverse is usually true of mankind in northern regions, yet we once saw a man enter the sea to all appearance a white human being, after remaining in it upwards of an hour, and swimming away from shore; like a vessel outward bound, he came back at last the colour of a boiled lobster!  Such exceptional qualities did Charlie Brooke possess.  A South Sea Islander might have envied but could not have excelled him.  It was these qualities that decided the course of his career just after he left school.  \"Charlie,\" said his mother, as they sat eating their mid-day meal alone one day--the mother being, as we have said, a widow, and Charlie an only child--\"what do you think of doing, now that you have left school? for you know my income renders it impossible that I should send you to college.\"  \"I don't know what to think, mother.  Of course I intend to do something.  If you had only influence with some one in power who could enable a fellow to get his foot on the first round of any sort of ladder, something might be done, for you know I'm not exactly useless, though I can't boast of brilliant talents, but--\"  \"Your talents are brilliant enough, Charlie,\" said his mother, interrupting; \"besides, you have been sent into this world for a purpose, and you may be sure that you will discover what that purpose is, and receive help to carry it out if you only ask God to guide you. Not otherwise,\" she added, after a pause.  \"Do you _really_ believe, mother, that _every_ one who is born into the world is sent for a purpose, and with a specific work to do?\"  \"I do indeed, Charlie.\"  \"What! all the cripples, invalids, imbeciles, even the very infants who are born to wail out their sad lives in a few weeks, or even days?\"  \"Yes--all of them, without exception.  To suppose the opposite, and imagine that a wise, loving, and almighty Being would create anything for _no_ purpose seems to me the very essence of absurdity.  Our only difficulty is that we do not always see the purpose.  All things are ours, but we must ask if we would have them.\"  \"But I _have_ asked, mother,\" said the youth, with an earnest flush on his brow.  \"You know I have done so often, yet a way has not been opened up.  I believe in _your_ faith, mother, but I don't quite believe in my own.  There surely must be something wrong--a screw loose somewhere.\"  He laid down his knife and fork, and looked out at the window with a wistful, perplexed expression.  \"How I wish,\" he continued, \"that the lines had been laid down for the human race more distinctly, so that we could not err!\"  \"And yet,\" responded his mother, with a peculiar look, \"such lines as _are_ obviously laid down we don't always follow.  For instance, it is written, `Ask, and it shall be given you,' and we stop there, but the sentence does not stop: `Seek, and ye shall find' implies care and trouble; `Knock, and it shall be opened unto you' hints at perseverance, does it not?\"  \"There's something in that, mother,\" said Charlie, casting another wistful glance out of the window.  \"Come, I will go out and `seek'!  I see Shank Leather waiting for me.  We agreed to go to the shore together, for we both like to watch the waves roaring in on a breezy day like this.\"  The youth rose and began to encase his bulky frame in a great pilot-cloth coat, each button of which might have done duty as an afternoon tea-saucer.  \"I wish you would choose any companion to walk with but young Leather,\" said the widow, with a sigh.  \"He's far too like his father to do you any good.\"  \"Mother, would you have me give up an old playmate and school-fellow because he is not perfect?\" asked the youth in grave tones as he tied on a sou'-wester.  \"Well, no--not exactly, but--\"  Not having a good reason ready, the worthy woman only smiled a remonstrance.  The stalwart son stooped, kissed her and was soon outside, battling with the storm--for what he styled a breezy day was in reality a wild and stormy one.  Long before the period we have now reached Mrs Brooke had changed her residence to the sea-coast in the small town of Sealford.  Her cottage stood in the centre of the village, about half-a-mile from the shore, and close to that of her bosom friend, Mrs Leather, who had migrated along with her, partly to be near her and partly for the sake of her son Shank, who was anxious to retain the companionship of his friend Brooke. Partly, also, to get her tippling husband away from old comrades and scenes, in the faint hope that she might rescue him "]]]
