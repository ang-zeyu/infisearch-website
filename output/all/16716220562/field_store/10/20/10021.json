As far as Lepidoptera are concerned, and certain of Hemiptera, they are right--the antennæ in these creatures are the seat of the organs of audition. But in Orthoptera, in most of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera, and in certain bugs (Hemiptera), they are located elsewhere. The habit that almost all insects have of retracting their antennæ when alarmed by noise, or otherwise, has done much to advance and strengthen the opinion that these appendages are the seat of insect ears; yet I am confident that in nine cases out of ten the antennæ are retracted through fear of injury to them, and not through any impression made on them by sound. The antennæ are the most exposed and least protected of any of the appendages or members of the insect body; hence their retraction by insects when alarmed is an instinctively protective action. They shelter them as much as possible in order to keep them from being injured. Again, although the antennæ of most insects are provided with numerous sensitive hairs, or setæ, we have no right to assume that these hairs are auditory; no \"auditory rods,\" otoliths, etc., are to be found generally in antennæ, yet there are exceptional instances. Leydig found auditory rods in the antennæ of _Dyticus marginalis_ (Furneaux[17]), the giant water-beetle, and I myself have observed them in _Corydalis cornuta_ and other neuropterous insects. I am inclined to believe that the entire order of Neuroptera has antennal ears, and should therefore in this respect be classed with Lepidoptera.    [17] Consult Furneaux, _Life in Ponds and Streams_, p. 325.  In grasshoppers and crickets the ears are situated in the anterior pairs of legs. If the tibia of a grasshopper's anterior leg be examined, two (one before and one behind) shining, oval, membranous disks, surrounded by a marginal ridge, will be at once observed. These are the tympana or ear-drums of the ear of that leg. Where the trachea, or air-tube, enters the tibia it becomes enlarged and divides into two channels; these two channels unite again lower down in the shaft of the tibia. The tracheæ of non-stridulating grylli are much smaller than those of sound-producing grasshoppers. The same may be said of the tibial air-tubes of the so-called dumb crickets. In grasshoppers and crickets the ear-drums lie bathed in air on both sides--the open air on the external side and the air of the air-tube, or trachea, on the inside. Lubbock calls attention to the fact that \"the trachea acts like the Eustachian tube in our own ear; it maintains an equilibrium of pressure on each side of the tympanum, and enables it freely to transmit atmospheric vibrations.\"  In grasshoppers the auditory nerve, after entering the tibia, divides into two branches, one forming the supratympanal ganglion, the other descending to the tympanum and forming a ganglion known as Siebold's organ. This last-mentioned ganglion is strikingly like the organ of Corti in our own ear, and undoubtedly serves a like purpose in the phenomenon of audition. The organ of Corti is composed of some four thousand delicate vesicles, graduated in size, each one of which vibrates in unison with some particular number of sound vibrations. The organ of Siebold in the grasshopper's ear begins with vesicles, of which a few of the first are nearly equal in size; these vesicles then regularly diminish in size to the end of the series. Each of these vesicles contains an auditory rod, and is in communication with the auditory nerve through a delicate nerve-fibril. I have observed that each of these nerve-fibrils swells into a minute ganglion immediately after leaving its particular vesicle; the function of these ganglia is, I take it, to strengthen and reënforce nerve-energy. No other observer mentions these ganglia, as far as I have been able to determine; they may have been absent, however, in the specimens studied by others, yet in the specimens studied by myself--the \"red-legged locust\" (_Melanoplus femur-rubrum_, Comstock)[18] and the \"meadow grasshopper\" (_Xiphidium_), they were always present.    [18] Consult Comstock, _Manual for the Study of Insects_, p. 110.  That grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets can hear, no one who has observed these creatures during the mating season will for one instant deny; they hear readily and well, for in most of them the sense of hearing is remarkably acute.  Immediately behind the wings of flies two curious knobbed organs are to be observed; these are considered to be rudimentary hinder wings by entomologists, and are called the halteres. Bolles Lee and others of the French scientists call them _balanciers_. This latter name I consider the correct one, for these organs unquestionably preside over alate equilibrium: they are true balancers. I do not propose to enter into any discussion as to whether these organs are rudimentary wings or not; suffice it to say that they appear to me to be organs fully developed and amply sufficient to serve the purposes for which they were created. Whether or not in the process of evolution there has occurred a change of function, is a point which will not be discussed in this paper. As they now exist, I deem them to be auditory organs of Diptera (flies, gnats, etc.).  The semicircular canals are, to a great extent if not entirely, the seat of equilibration in man. Any derangement or disease of these canals interferes with equilibration; this is well shown in Ménière's disease, in which there is always marked disturbance of the equilibrating function.  If the balancers of a horsefly be removed, the insect at once loses its equilibrium; it cannot direct its flight, but plunges headlong to the ground. The same can be said of _Chrysops niger_--in fact, of the entire family of Tabanidæ, of the gall gnat (_Diplosis resinicola_, Comstock), and of the March flies (_Bibionidæ_). These widely differing flies constitute the material from which I have derived my data; I will venture to assert, however, without fear of contradiction, that what has been said about the flies mentioned above is equally true of all flies.  When the knobbed end of the balancers of the horsefly (_Tabanus atratus_, Comstock)[19] are examined with the microscope, the cuticle will be found to be set with minute hairs or setæ; some of these hairs penetrate both cuticle and hypoderm, are hollow, and receive into their hollows delicate nerve-fibrils. These nerve-fibrils pass inward toward the centre, and enter ganglia, which in turn are in immediate connection with the great nerves of the balancers. There is but one nerve in the insect's body that is larger than the balancer nerve, and that is the optic nerve; hence, it is natural to infer that the balancer nerve leads to some special sense centre. This centre in my opinion is, unquestionably, the seat of the auditory function.    [19] Consult Comstock, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 455.  It has been demonstrated beyond doubt that analogous hollow hairs, or setæ, are prominent factors of audition in many animals, notably crustaceans, such as the lobster, the crab, and the crayfish, and many of the insect family; hence, it is logically correct to conclude that the hollow hairs on the balancers of flies are likewise auditory hairs. Moreover, there are grouped about the bases of these knobbed organs certain rows of vesicles, which contain auditory rods almost identical in appearance with the auditory rods of the grasshopper. Indeed, I have found those in the upper row of vesicles to be precisely similar in appearance to the rods found in Melanoplus.  I have determined that in the horsefly (_Tabanus atratus_) there are six rows of these vesicles, and that they are graduated in size. There are in the knobs of the balancers minute spiracles (I do not think that these have been pointed out before by any other observer) through which air passes into the large, vesicular cells which make up the greater portion of the knobs; spiracles are also to be found in the shafts of the balancers, thus providing an abundance of air to the internal structures of these organs and allowing for the free transmission of sound vibrations.  I am well aware of the fact that in considering these organs to be the ears of flies, I antagonize Lee and others who consider them olfactory in character.[20] The position I take in regard to these organs is, however, a tenable one, and one that cannot easily be overthrown.    [20] Bolles Lee, _Les Balanciers des Dipteres_; quoted also by   Lubbock, _Senses, Instincts_, etc., pp. 110, 111.  The ears of Lepidoptera (butterflies) are situated in their antennæ. This fact has been clearly demonstrated by Lubbock, Graber, Leydig, and Wolff. Newport has made an especially exhaustive study of the antennæ of insects; and he, too, places the organs of audition in these appendages.[21] But in Coleoptera my experiments and microscopical researches compel me to assert that I differ somewhat from the conclusions of the above-mentioned authorities. These gentlemen locate the ears of beetles also in their antennæ. Lubbock bases his conclusions on an experiment of Will--an experiment which, if it had been carried a little further, would have demonstrated the fact that the ears of beetles are not in their antennæ, but are, on the contrary, in their maxillary palpi.    [21] Newport, _The Antennæ of Insects_, Entomol. Society, Vol. II.  Will put a female Cerambyx beetle into a box, which he placed on a table; he then put a male Cerambyx on the table, some four inches from the box. When he touched the female she began to chirrup, whereupon the male turned his antennæ toward the box, \"as if to determine from which direction the sound came, and then marched straight toward the female.\" Will concluded from this that the ears of the beetle were located in its antennæ.[22]    [22] Will, _Das Geschmacksorgen der Insecten_, Wiss. Zool.; quoted   also by Lubbock,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21608"],["title","The Dawn of Reason; or, Mental Traits in the Lower Animals (#6)"],["body","Senses, Instincts_, etc., p. 96.  Seeing that Will's experiment as described by him was incomplete, I took a pair of beetles belonging to the same family (genus _Prionus_), and determined the true location of their ears by a system of rigid exclusion. These beetles, when irritated, make a squeaking chirrup by rubbing together the prothorax and mesothorax.  When I irritated the female she began to chirrup, and the male immediately turned toward the small paper box in which she was confined. I then removed the antennæ of the male, and again made the female stridulate; the male heard her, and at once crawled toward her, although his antennæ were entirely removed.  This showed conclusively that the organs of audition were not located in the antennæ, as Will supposed and as Lubbock advocates. I then removed the maxillary palpi of the male, after which the insect remained deaf to all sounds emanating from the female.  Again, I took an unmutilated male, which at once turned and crawled toward the chirruping female. I then removed its labial palpi, leaving maxillary palpi and antennæ intact; it heard the female and made toward her. The maxillary palpi were then removed (the antennæ being left _in situ_), and at once the creature became deaf.  If the maxillary palpi of long-horned beetles be examined, certain vesicular organs, each containing a microscopic hair, will be observed in the basal segments; these, I take it, are auditory vesicles. In some of the Coleoptera I have found auditory rods in the apical segments, though this is by no means a common occurrence. In Cicindelidæ and Carabidæ these auditory vesicles are exceedingly small, and require a very high-power objective in order to be clearly seen.  In justice to other observers I must say, however, that I am inclined to believe that in all beetles the antennæ in some way aid or assist audition, but they are adjuncts, as it were, and not absolutely necessary. It is a matter of easy demonstration to show that some of these insects hear less acutely where they are deprived of their antennæ. I presume they are about as necessary in audition as are the external appendages of the human ear; this, however, is mere supposition, and has no scientific warrant for its verity.  I have purposely said but very little about the senses of touch, taste, and smell in this discussion of the senses in the lower animals. These three senses have been so exhaustively treated by Lubbock in his _Senses, Instincts, and Intelligences of Animals_, that I could not hope to introduce any new data in regard to them. Graber, Frey, Leuckart, Farre, Hertwig, and a host of others have likewise investigated these senses most thoroughly.  As to the senses of sight and hearing, the matter presented a different aspect. I was confident that I could add somewhat to the knowledge already formulated, consequently I have treated these senses at some length. Technicalities and the details of microscopic investigation, especially microscopic anatomy, have been omitted; they have no place in a work like this.     CHAPTER II  CONSCIOUS DETERMINATION   Conscious determination, or, effort induced by conscious volition, is the basic mental operation upon which is reared that complex psychical structure which is to be found in the higher animals, and especially in man--the highest product of evolutionary development.  By conscious volition is not meant that consciousness which appertains to the child of two or three years, who, at that age, recognizes the _ego_. Ego-knowledge, while undoubtedly present in some of the higher animals, such as the dog, monkey, horse, cat, etc., is not a factor in the psychical make-up of any of the lower animals (insects, crustaceans, mollusks, etc.). But consciousness, so far as volition or choice is concerned, enters into the _psychos_ of animals exceedingly low in the scale of animal life.  We have seen in the chapter on the senses in the lower animals, that animals possess one or all of the five senses--touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing; we will see in a later chapter that some of them likewise possess certain other senses which man has lost in the process of evolution.  Now, let us very briefly discuss the _modus operandi_ through which and by which conscious determination and other psychical manifestations arise from the physical basis--the senses.[23] I have asserted, and, as I believe, I have demonstrated elsewhere, the interdependence and correlation of physiology and psychology. Furthermore, I wish to be plainly understood as also asserting the physical basis and origin of all psychical operations whatever they may be.    [23] \"Sensorial impression is at the bottom of all our ideas, all our   conceptions, though it may at first conceal itself in the form of a   binary, ternary, quaternary compound; and, on our methodically   pursuing the inquiry, it is easily recognizable--just as a simple   substance in organic chemistry may be always summoned to appear, if we   sit down with the resolution to disengage it from all the artificial   combinations which hold it imprisoned.\"--LUYS, _The Brain and its   Functions_, p. 252.  Mind is always associated, according to our experience and knowledge (and this question must be studied objectively) with a peculiar tissue which is only to be found in animal organisms. This tissue is called nerve, and is made up of cells and, broadly speaking, prolongations of cells which are called nerve-fibres.  Certain accumulations of nerve-cells called ganglions (ganglia) are to be found scattered throughout the structure of animals. Experiment and observation teach that these ganglia subserve a governing influence over nerve-action; hence, they are called nerve-centres.  Nerve-tissue is found in all animals above and including Hydrozoa, according to Romanes;[24] I am inclined to believe, however, that it is present in animals even lower than Hydrozoa, for I have been able, on more than one occasion, to verify Professor Clark's observations in regard to the protozoan, _Stentor polymorphus_, which, as he asserts,[25] has a well-developed nervous system. Moreover, I have seen, in my opinion, unquestionable acts of conscious determination enacted by this little creature, as I will point out further along in this chapter.    [24] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Animals_, p. 24.    [25] Clark, _Mind in Nature_, p. 64 _et seq._  Nerve-tissue has the peculiar faculty of transmitting impressions made upon it by stimuli. When a nerve is acted on by a stimulus, the impression wave is transmitted along the in-going nerve to the ganglion; here, the stimulus is transferred to the out-going nerve, which, going to the muscle, causes it to contract.  This form of nerve-action is called reflex action, and reflex action is, in the beginning, the germ from which spring volition (choice) and all of the higher psychical attributes.  Again, it is to be observed, as animals become more highly organized, that nerves have the power of discriminating between stimuli, and \"it is this power of discriminating between stimuli,\" as Romanes puts it, \"_irrespective of their relative mechanical intensities_, that constitutes the physiological aspect of choice\" (volition). It is also through the faculty of discrimination that the special senses, upon which the entire psychical structure depends, have been evolved.  The fact of this power of discrimination has been so clearly and so beautifully demonstrated by Romanes, that I present his experiment and observations, as detailed by him in his magnificent work, _Mental Evolution in Animals_:--  \"I have observed that if a sea-anemone is placed in an aquarium tank, and allowed to fasten on one side of the tank near the surface of the water, and if a jet of sea-water is made to play continuously and forcibly upon the anemone from above, the result of course is that the animal becomes surrounded with a turmoil of water and air-bubbles. Yet, after a short time, it becomes so accustomed to this turmoil that it will expand its tentacles in search of food, just as it does when placed in calm water. If now one of the expanded tentacles is gently touched with a solid body, all the others close around that body, in just the same way as they would were they expanded in calm water. That is to say, the tentacles are able to discriminate between the stimulus which is applied by the turmoil of the water and that which is supplied by their contact with the solid body, and they respond to the latter stimulus notwithstanding that it is of incomparably less intensity than the former.\"[26]    [26] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Animals_, pp. 48, 49.  When a stimulus passes over a nerve to a ganglion, it leaves upon it an impression which remains for a shorter or longer time as the stimulus is great or small. Now, when a stimulus is again applied to the nerve, the impression wave follows in the footsteps, as it were, of the first impression wave, and the ganglion reflects or transfers it just as before, thus showing that nerve has another peculiar quality--that of _memory_.  Again, when two or more reflexes are excited by the same stimulus or stimuli, the ganglion learns to associate one with the other, thus showing that it possesses another quality--that of the association of ideas (stimuli and reflexes).  All of these operations are, in their beginnings, exceedingly simple; yet, as organisms increase in complexity, these simple beginnings become more complex and more highly developed.  Heretofore, the operations described have been entirely ganglionic (reflex) and utterly without that which we call consciousness. Now, since consciousness, as I understand it, is simply a knowledge of existence, and since this knowledge of existence is only to be had through sensual perceptions, and, since sensual perceptions are excited undoubtedly by coördinated stimuli, then, \"there cannot be coördination of many stimuli without some ganglion through which they are"]]]
