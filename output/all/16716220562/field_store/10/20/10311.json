Oh! a--about my being a celebrated hunter.  A very Nimrod--at least a miniature copy.  Well, Ralph, since we last met I have been all over the world, right round and round it. I'm a lieutenant in the navy now--at least I was a week ago.  I've been fighting with the Kaffirs and the Chinamen, and been punishing the rascally sepoys in India, and been hunting elephants in Ceylon and tiger-shooting in the jungles, and harpooning whales in the polar seas, and shooting lions at the Cape; oh, you've no notion where all I've been.  It's a perfect marvel I've turned up here alive.  But there's one beast I've not yet seen, and I'm resolved to see him and shoot him too--\"  \"But,\" said I, interrupting, \"what mean you by saying that you were a lieutenant in the navy a week ago?\"  \"I mean that I've given it up.  I'm tired of the sea.  I only value it as a means of getting from one country to another.  The land, the land for me!  You must know that an old uncle, a rich old uncle of mine, whom I never saw, died lately and left me his whole fortune.  Of course he died in India.  All old uncles who die suddenly and leave unexpected fortunes to unsuspecting nephews are old Indian uncles, and mine was no exception to the general rule.  So I'm independent, like you, Ralph, only I've got three or four thousand a year instead of hundreds, I believe; but I'm not sure and don't care--and I'm determined now to go on a long hunting expedition.  What think ye of all that, my boy?\"  \"In truth,\" said I, \"it would puzzle me to say what I think, I am so filled with surprise by all you tell me.  But you forget that you have not yet told me to which part of the world you mean to go, and what sort of beast it is you are so determined to see and shoot if you can.\"  \"If I can!\" echoed Peterkin, with a contemptuous curl of the lip.  \"Did not I tell you that I was a _celebrated_ hunter?  Without meaning to boast, I may tell you that there is no peradventure in my shooting.  If I only get there and see the brute within long range, I'll--ha! won't I!\"  \"Get _where_, and see _what_?\"  \"Get to Africa and see the gorilla!\" cried Peterkin, while a glow of enthusiasm lighted up his eyes.  \"You've heard of the gorilla, Ralph, of course--the great ape--the enormous puggy--the huge baboon--the man monkey, that we've been hearing so much of for some years back, and that the niggers on the African coast used to dilate about till they caused the very hair of my head to stand upon end?  I'm determined to shoot a gorilla, or prove him to be a myth.  And I mean you to come and help me, Ralph; he's quite in your way.  A bit of natural history, I suppose, although he seems by all accounts to be a very unnatural monster.  And Jack shall go too--I'm resolved on that; and we three shall roam the wild woods again, as we did in days of yore, and--\"  \"Hold, Peterkin,\" said I, interrupting.  \"How do you know that Jack will go?\"  \"How do I know?  Intuitively, of course.  I shall write to him to-night; the post does not leave till ten.  He'll get it to-morrow at breakfast, and will catch the forenoon coach, which will bring him down here by two o'clock, and then we'll begin our preparations at once, and talk the matter over at dinner.  So you see it's all cut and dry.  Give me a sheet of paper and I'll write at once.  Ah! here's a bit; now a pen. Bless me, Ralph, haven't you got a quill?  Who ever heard of a philosophical naturalist writing with steel.  Now, then, here goes:--`B'luv'd Jack,'--will that do to begin with, eh?  I'm afraid it's too affectionate; he'll think it's from a lady friend.  But it can't be altered,--`Here I am, and here's Ralph--Ralph Rover!!!!!! think of that,' (I say, Ralph, I've put six marks of admiration there); `I've found him out.  Do come to see us.  Excruciatingly important business. Ever thine--Peterkin Gay.'  Will that bring him, d'ye think?\"  \"I think it will,\" said I, laughing.  \"Then off with it, Ralph,\" cried my volatile friend, jumping up and looking hastily round for the bell-rope.  Not being able to find it, my bell-pull being an unobtrusive knob and not a rope, he rushed to the door, unlocked it, darted out, and uttered a tremendous roar, which was followed by a clatter and a scream from old Agnes, whom he had upset and tumbled over.  It was curious to note the sudden change that took place in Peterkin's face, voice, and manner, as he lifted the poor old woman, who was very thin and light, in his arms, and carrying her into the room, placed her in my easy-chair.  Real anxiety was depicted in his countenance, and he set her down with a degree of care and tenderness that quite amazed me. I was myself very much alarmed at first.  \"My poor dear old _woman_,\" said Peterkin, supporting my landlady's head; \"my stupid haste I fear you are hurt.\"  \"Hech! it's nae hurt--it's deed I am, fair deed; killed be a whaumlskamerin' young blagyird.  Oh, ma puir heed!\"  The manner and tone in which this was said convinced me that old Agnes was more frightened than injured.  In a few minutes the soothing tones and kind manner of my friend had such an effect upon her that she declared she was better, and believed after all that she was only a \"wee bit frichtened.\"  Nay, so completely was she conciliated, that she insisted on conveying the note to the post-office, despite Peterkin's assurance that he would not hear of it.  Finally she hobbled out of the room with the letter in her hand.  It is interesting to note how that, in most of the affairs of humanity, things turn out very different, often totally different, from what we had expected or imagined.  During the remainder of that evening Peterkin and I talked frequently and much of our old friend Jack Martin.  We recalled his manly yet youthful countenance, his bold, lion-like courage, his broad shoulders and winning gentle smile, and although we knew that six years must have made an immense difference in his personal appearance--for he was not much more than eighteen when we last parted-- we could not think of him except as a hearty, strapping sailor-boy.  We planned, too, how we would meet him at the coach; how we would stand aside in the crowd until he began to look about for us in surprise, and then one of us would step forward and ask if he wished to be directed to any particular part of the town, and so lead him on and talk to him as a stranger for some time before revealing who we were.  And much more to the same effect.  But when next day came our plans and our conceptions were utterly upset.  A little before two we sauntered down to the coach-office, and waited impatiently for nearly twenty minutes.  Of course the coach was late; it always is on such occasions.  \"Suppose he does not come,\" said I.  \"What a fellow you are,\" cried Peterkin, \"to make uncomfortable suppositions!  Let us rather suppose that he does come.\"  \"Oh, then, it would be all right; but if he does not come, what then?\"  \"Why, then, it would be all wrong, and we should have to return home and eat our dinner in the sulks, that's all.\"  As my companion spoke we observed the coach come sweeping round the turn of the road about half a mile distant.  In a few seconds it dashed into the town at full gallop, and finally drew up abruptly opposite the door of the inn, where were assembled the usual group of hostlers and waiters and people who expected friends by the coach.  \"He's not there,\" whispered Peterkin, in deep disappointment--\"at least he's not on the outside, and Jack would never travel inside of a coach even in bad weather, much less in fine.  That's not him on the back-seat beside the fat old woman with the blue bundle, surely!  It's very like him, but too young, much too young.  There's a great giant of a man on the box-seat with a beard like a grenadier's shako, and a stout old gentleman behind him with gold spectacles.  That's all, except two boys farther aft, and three ladies in the cabin.  Oh, _what_ a bore!\"  Although deeply disappointed at the non-arrival of Jack, I could with difficulty refrain from smiling at the rueful and woe-begone countenance of my poor companion.  It was evident that he could not bear disappointment with equanimity, and I was on the point of offering some consolatory remarks, when my attention was attracted by the little old woman with the blue bundle, who went up to the gigantic man with the black beard, and in the gentlest possible tone of voice asked if he could direct her to the white house.  \"No, madam,\" replied the big man hastily; \"I'm a stranger here.\"  The little old woman was startled by his abrupt answer.  \"Deary me, sir, no offence, I hope.\"  She then turned to Peterkin and put the same question, possibly under a vague sort of impression that if a gigantic frame betokened a gruff nature, diminutive stature must necessarily imply extreme amiability. If so, she must have been much surprised as well as disappointed, for Peterkin, rendered irascible by disappointment, turned short round and said sharply, \"Why, madam, how can _I_ tell you where the white house is, unless you say which white house you want?  Half the houses of the town are white--at least they're _dirty_ white,\" he added bitterly, as he turned away.  \"I think I can direct you, ma'am,\" said I, stepping quickly up with a bland smile, in order to counteract, if possible, my companion's rudeness.  \"Thank you, sir, kindly,\" said the little old woman; \"I'm glad to find _some_ little civility in the town.\"  \"Come with me, ma'am; I am going past the white house, and will show you the way.\"  \"And pray, sir,\" said the big stranger, stepping up to me as I was about to move away, \"can you recommend me to a good hotel?\"  I replied that I could; that there was one in the immediate vicinity of the white house, and that if he would accompany me I would show him the way.  All this I did purposely in a very affable and obliging tone and manner; for I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],["title","The Gorilla Hunters (#2)"],["body","that example is infinitely better than precept, and always endeavour, if possible, to overcome evil with good.  I offered my arm to the old woman, who thanked me and took it.  \"What!\" whispered Peterkin, \"you don't mean me to take this great ugly gorilla in tow?\"  \"Of course,\" replied I, laughing, as I led the way.  Immediately I entered into conversation with my companion, and I heard \"the gorilla\" attempt to do so with Peterkin; but from the few sharp cross replies that reached my ear, I became aware that he was unsuccessful.  In the course of a few minutes, however, he appeared to have overcome his companion's ill-humour, for I overheard their voices growing louder and more animated as they walked behind me.  Suddenly I heard a shout, and turning hastily round, observed Peterkin struggling in the arms of the gorilla!  Amazed beyond measure at the sight, and firmly persuaded that a cowardly assault had been made upon my friend, I seized the old woman's umbrella, as the only available weapon, and flew to the rescue.  \"Jack, my boy! can it be possible?\" gasped Peterkin.  \"I believe it is,\" replied Jack, laughing.--\"Ralph, my dear old fellow, how are you?\"  I stood petrified.  I believed that I was in a dream.  I know not what occurred during the next five minutes.  All I could remember with anything like distinctness was a succession of violent screams from the little old woman, who fled shouting thieves and murder at the full pitch of her voice.  We never saw that old woman again, but I made a point of returning her umbrella to the \"white house.\"  Gradually we became collected and sane.  \"Why, Jack, how did you find us out?\" cried Peterkin, as we all hurried on to my lodgings, totally forgetful of the little old woman, whom, as I have said, we never saw again, but who, I sincerely trust, arrived at the white house in safety.  \"Find you out!  I knew you the moment I set eyes on you.  Ralph puzzled me for a second, he has grown so much stouter; but I should know your nose, Peterkin, at a mile off.\"  \"Well, Jack, I did not know you,\" retorted Peterkin, \"but I'm safe never again to forget you.  Such a great hairy Cossack as you have become! Why, what do you mean by it?\"  \"I couldn't help it, please,\" pleaded Jack; \"I grew in spite of myself; but I think I've stopped now.\"  \"It's time,\" remarked Peterkin.  Jack had indeed grown to a size that men seldom attain to without losing in grace infinitely more than they gain in bulk, but he had retained all the elegance of form and sturdy vigour of action that had characterised him as a boy.  He was fully six feet two inches in his stockings, but so perfect were his proportions that his great height did not become apparent until you came close up to him.  Full half of his handsome manly face was hid by a bushy black beard and moustache, and his curly hair had been allowed to grow luxuriantly, so that his whole aspect was more like to the descriptions we have of one of the old Scandinavian Vikings than a gentleman of the present time.  In whatever company he chanced to be he towered high above every one else, and I am satisfied that, had he walked down Whitechapel, the Horse Guards would have appeared small beside him, for he possessed not only great length of limb but immense breadth of chest and shoulders.  During our walk to my lodgings Peterkin hurriedly stated his \"plan and proposal,\" which caused Jack to laugh very much at first, but in a few minutes he became grave, and said slowly, \"That will just suit--it will do exactly.\"  \"What will do exactly?  Do be more explicit, man,\" said Peterkin, with some impatience.  \"I'll go with you, my boy.\"  \"Will you?\" cried Peterkin, seizing his hand and shaking it violently; \"I knew you would.  I said it; didn't I, Ralph?  And now we shall be sure of a gorilla, if there's one in Africa, for I'll use you as a stalking-horse.\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed Jack.  \"Yes; I'll put a bear-skin or some sort of fur on your shoulders, and tie a lady's boa to you for a tail, and send you into the woods.  The gorillas will be sure to mistake you for a relative until you get quite close; then you'll take one pace to the left with the left foot (as the volunteers say), I'll take one to the front with the right--at fifty yards, ready--present--bang, and down goes the huge puggy with a bullet right between its two eyes!  There.  And Ralph's agreed to go too.\"  \"O Peterkin, I've done nothing of the sort.  You _proposed_ it.\"  \"Well, and isn't that the same thing?  I wonder, Ralph that you can give way to such mean-spirited prevarication.  What?  `It's not prevarication!'  Don't say that now; you know it is.  Ah! you may laugh, my boy, but you have promised to go with me and Jack to Africa, and go you shall.\"  And so, reader, it was ultimately settled, and in the course of two weeks more we three were on our way to the land of the slave, the black savage, and the gorilla.    CHAPTER TWO.  LIFE IN THE WILD WOODS.  One night, about five or six weeks after our resolution to go to Africa on a hunting expedition was formed, I put to myself the question, \"Can it be possible that we are actually here, in the midst of it?\"  \"Certainly, my boy, in the very thick of it,\" answered Peterkin, in a tone of voice which made Jack laugh, while I started and exclaimed--  \"Why, Peterkin, how did you come to guess my thoughts?\"  \"Because, Ralph, you have got into a habit of thinking aloud, which may do very well as long as you have no secrets to keep but it may prove inconvenient some day, so I warn you in time.\"  Not feeling disposed at that time to enter into a bantering conversation with my volatile companion, I made no reply, but abandoned myself again to the pleasing fancies and feelings which were called up by the singular scene in the midst of which I found myself.  It seemed as if it were but yesterday when we drove about the crowded streets of London making the necessary purchases for our intended journey, and now, as I gazed around, every object that met my eye seemed strange, and wild, and foreign, and romantic.  We three were reclining round an enormous wood fire in the midst of a great forest, the trees and plants of which were quite new to me, and totally unlike those of my native land.  Rich luxuriance of vegetation was the feature that filled my mind most.  Tall palms surrounded us, throwing their broad leaves overhead and partially concealing the starlit sky.  Thick tough limbs of creeping plants and wild vines twisted and twined round everything and over everything, giving to the woods an appearance of tangled impenetrability; but the beautiful leaves of some, and the delicate tendrils of others, half concealed the sturdy limbs of the trees, and threw over the whole a certain air of wild grace, as might a semi-transparent and beautiful robe if thrown around the form of a savage.  The effect of a strong fire in the woods at night is to give to surrounding space an appearance of ebony blackness, against which dark ground the gnarled stems and branches and pendent foliage appear as if traced out in light and lovely colours, which are suffused with a rich warm tone from the blaze.  We were now in the wilds of Africa, although, as I have said, I found it difficult to believe the fact.  Jack and I wore loose brown shooting coats and pantaloons; but we had made up our minds to give up waistcoats and neckcloths, so that our scarlet flannel shirts with turned-down collars gave to us quite a picturesque and brigand-like appearance as we encircled the blaze--Peterkin smoking vigorously, for he had acquired that bad and very absurd habit at sea.  Jack smoked too, but he was not so inveterate as Peterkin.  Jack was essentially moderate in his nature.  He did nothing violently or in a hurry; but this does not imply that he was slow or lazy.  He was leisurely in disposition, and circumstances seldom required him to be otherwise.  When Peterkin or I had to lift heavy weights, we were obliged to exert our utmost strength and agitate our whole frames; but Jack was so powerful that a comparatively slight effort was all that he was usually obliged to make.  Again, when we two were in a hurry we walked quickly, but Jack's long limbs enabled him to keep up with us without effort.  Nevertheless there were times when he was called upon to act quickly and with energy.  On those occasions he was as active as Peterkin himself, but his movements were tremendous.  It was, I may almost say, awful to behold Jack when acting under powerful excitement. He was indeed a splendid fellow, and not by any means deserving of the name of gorilla, which Peterkin had bestowed on him.  But to continue my description of our costume.  We all wore homespun grey trousers of strong material.  Peterkin and Jack wore leggings in addition, so that they seemed to have on what are now termed knickerbockers.  Peterkin, however, had no coat.  He preferred a stout grey flannel shirt hanging down to his knees and belted round his waist in the form of a tunic.  Our tastes in headdress were varied.  Jack wore a pork-pie cap; Peterkin and I had wide-awakes.  My facetious little companion said that I had selected this species of hat because I was always more than half asleep!  Being peculiar in everything, Peterkin wore his wide-awake in an unusual manner--namely, turned up at the back, down at the front, and curled very much up at the sides.  We were so filled with admiration of Jack's magnificent beard and moustache, that Peterkin and I had resolved to cultivate ours while in Africa; but I must say that, as I looked at Peterkin's face, the additional hair was not at that time an improvement, and I believe that much more could not have been said for myself.  The effect on my little comrade was to cause the lower part of his otherwise good-looking face to appear extremely dirty.  \"I wonder,\" said Peterkin, after a long silence, \"if we shall reach the niggers' village in time for the hunt to-morrow.  I fear that"]]]
