Majestic trees were there, with foliage of every shape and size and hue; some with stems twenty feet in circumference; others more slender in form, straight and tall; and some twisted in a bunch together and rising upwards like fluted pillars: a few had buttresses, or natural planks, several feet broad, ranged all round their trunks, as if to support them; while many bent gracefully beneath the load of their clustering fruit and heavy foliage.  Orange-trees with their ripe fruit shone in the sunbeams like gold.  Stately palms rose above the surrounding trees and waved their feathery plumes in the air, and bananas with broad enormous leaves rustled in the breeze and cast a cool shadow on the ground.  Well might they gaze in great surprise; for all these curious and beautiful trees were surrounded by, and entwined in, the embrace of luxuriant and remarkable climbing-plants.  The parasitic vanilla with its star-like blossoms crept up their trunks and along their branches, where it hung in graceful festoons, or drooped back again almost to the ground.  So rich and numerous were these creepers, that in many cases they killed the strong giants whom they embraced so lovingly.  Some of them hung from the tree-tops like stays from the masts of a ship, and many of them mingled their brilliant flowers so closely with the leaves, that the climbing-plants and their supporters could not be distinguished from each other, and it seemed as though the trees themselves had become gigantic flowering shrubs.  Birds, too, were there in myriads,--and such birds!  Their feathers were green and gold and scarlet and yellow and blue--fresh and bright and brilliant as the sky beneath which they were nurtured.  The great toucan, with a beak nearly as big as his body, flew clumsily from stem to stem.  The tiny, delicate humming-birds, scarce larger than bees, fluttered from flower to flower and spray to spray, like points of brilliant green.  But they were irritable, passionate little creatures, these lovely things, and quarrelled with each other and fought like very wasps!  Enormous butterflies, with wings of deep metallic blue, shot past or hovered in the air like gleams of light; and green paroquets swooped from tree to tree and chattered joyfully over their morning meal.  Well might they gaze with wonder, and smile too with extreme merriment, for monkeys stared at them from between the leaves with expressions of undisguised amazement, and bounded away shrieking and chattering in consternation, swinging from branch to branch with incredible speed, and not scrupling to use each other's tails to swing by when occasion offered.  Some were big and red and ugly,--as ugly as you can possibly imagine, with blue faces and fiercely grinning teeth; others were delicately-formed and sad of countenance, as if they were for ever bewailing the loss of near and dear relations, and could by no means come at consolation; and some were small and pretty, with faces no bigger than a halfpenny.  As a general rule, it seemed to Barney, the smaller the monkey the longer the tail.  Yes, well might they gaze and gaze again in surprise and in excessive admiration; and well might Barney O'Flannagan--under the circumstances, with such sights and sounds around him, and the delightful odours of myrtle trees and orange blossoms and the Cape jessamine stealing up his nostrils--deem himself the tenant of another world, and evince his conviction of the fact in that memorable expression--\"I've woked in paradise!\"  But Barney began to find \"paradise\" not quite so comfortable as it ought to be; for when he tried to get up he found his bones pained and stiff from sleeping in damp clothes; and moreover, his face was very much swelled, owing to the myriads of mosquitoes which had supped of it during the night.  \"Arrah, then, _won't_ ye be done!\" he cried, angrily, giving his face a slap that killed at least two or three hundred of his tormentors.  But thousands more attacked him instantly, and he soon found out,--what every one finds out sooner or later in hot climates,--that _patience_ is one of the best remedies for mosquito bites.  He also discovered shortly afterwards that smoke is not a bad remedy, in connection with patience.  \"What are we to have for breakfast, Barney!\" inquired Martin as he rose and yawned and stretched his limbs.  \"Help yersilf to what ye plase,\" said Barney, with a polite bow, waving his hand round him, as if the forest were his private property and Martin Rattler his honoured guest.  \"Well, I vote for oranges,\" said Martin, going towards a tree which was laden with ripe fruit.  \"An' I'll try plums, by way of variety,\" added his companion.  In a few minutes several kinds of fruit and nuts were gathered and spread at the foot of the tree under which they had reposed.  Then Barney proceeded to kindle a fire,--not that he had anything to cook, but he said it looked sociable-like, and the smoke would keep off the flies.  The operation, however, was by no means easy.  Everything had been soaked by the rain of the previous night, and a bit of dry grass could scarcely be found.  At length he procured a little; and by rubbing it in the damp gunpowder which he had extracted from his pistol, and drying it in the sun, he formed a sort of tinder that caught fire after much persevering effort.  Some of the fruits they found to be good,--others bad.  The good they ate,--the bad they threw away.  After their frugal fare they felt much refreshed, and then began to talk of what they should do.  \"We can't live here with parrots and monkeys, you know,\" said Martin; \"we must try to find a village or town of some sort; or get to the coast and then we shall perhaps meet with a ship.\"  \"True, lad,\" replied Barney, knitting his brows and looking extremely sagacious; \"the fact is, since neither of us knows nothing about anything, or the way to any place, my advice is to walk straight for'ard till we come to something.\"  \"So think I,\" replied Martin; \"therefore the sooner we set off the better.\"  Having no luggage to pack and no arrangements of any kind to make, the two friends rose from their primitive breakfast-table, and walked away straight before them into the forest.  All that day they travelled patiently forward, conversing pleasantly about the various and wonderful trees, and flowers, and animals they met with by the way; but no signs were discovered that indicated the presence of man.  Towards evening, however, they fell upon a track or foot-path,--which discovery rejoiced them much; and here, before proceeding further, they sat down to eat a little more fruit which, indeed, they had done several times during the day.  They walked nearly thirty miles that day without seeing a human being; but they met with many strange and beautiful birds and beasts,--some of which were of so fierce an aspect that they would have been very glad to have had guns to defend themselves with.  Fortunately, however, all the animals seemed to be much more afraid of them than they were of the animals; so they travelled in safety.  Several times during the course of the day they saw snakes and serpents, which glided away into the jungle on their approach, and could not be overtaken, although Barney made repeated darts at them, intending to attack them with his cutlass; which assaults always proved fruitless.  Once they were charged by a herd of peccaries,--a species of pig or wild hog,--from which they escaped by jumping actively to one side; but the peccaries turned and rushed at them again, and it was only by springing up the branches of a neighbouring tree that they escaped their fury. These peccaries are the fiercest and most dauntless animals in the forests of Brazil.  They do of know what fear is,--they will rush in the face of anything; and, unlike all other animals, are quite indifferent to the report of fire-arms.  Their bodies are covered with long bristles, resembling very much the quills of the porcupine.  As the evening drew on, the birds and beasts and the innumerable insects, that had kept up a perpetual noise during the day, retired to rest; and then the nocturnal animals began to creep out of their holes and go about.  Huge vampire-bats, one of which had given Barney such a fright the night before, flew silently past them; and the wild howlings commenced again.  They now discovered that one of the most dismal of the howls proceeded from a species of monkey: at which discovery Martin laughed very much, and rallied his companion on being so easily frightened; but Barney gladly joined in the laugh against himself, for, to say truth, he felt quite relieved and light-hearted at discovering that his ghosts were converted into bats and monkeys!  There was one roar, however, which, when they heard it ever and anon, gave them considerable uneasiness.  \"D'ye think there's lions in them parts?\" inquired Barney, glancing with an expression of regret at his empty pistol, and laying his hand on the hilt of his cutlass.  \"I think not,\" replied Martin, in a low tone of voice.  \"I have read in my school geography that there are tigers of some sort--jaguars, or ounces, I think they are called,--but there are no--\"  Martin's speech was cut short by a terrific roar, which rang through the woods, and the next instant a magnificent jaguar, or South American tiger, bounded on to the track a few yards in advance, and, wheeling round, glared fiercely at the travellers.  It seemed, in the uncertain light as if his eyes were two balls of living fire.  Though not so large as the royal Bengal tiger of India, this animal was nevertheless of immense size, and had a very ferocious aspect.  His roar was so sudden and awful, and his appearance so unexpected, that the blood was sent thrilling back into the hearts of the travellers, who stood rooted to the spot, absolutely unable to move.  This was the first large animal of the cat kind that either of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21750"],["title","Martin Rattler (#7)"],["body","had seen in all the terrible majesty of its wild condition; and, for the first time, Martin and his friend felt that awful sensation of dread that will assail even the bravest heart when a new species of imminent danger is suddenly presented.  It is said that no animal can withstand the steady gaze of a human eye; and many travellers in wild countries have proved this to be a fact.  On the present occasion our adventurers stared long and steadily at the wild creature before them, from a mingled feeling of surprise and horror.  In a few seconds the jaguar showed signs of being disconcerted.  It turned its head from side to side slightly, and dropped its eyes, as if to avoid their gaze.  Then turning slowly and stealthily round, it sprang with a magnificent bound into the jungle, and disappeared.  Both Martin and Barney heaved a deep sigh of relief.  \"What a mercy it did not attack us!\" said the former, wiping the cold perspiration from his forehead.  \"We should have had no chance against such a terrible beast with a cutlass, I fear.\"  \"True, boy, true,\" replied his friend, gravely; \"it would have been little better than a penknife in the ribs o' sich a cratur.  I niver thought that it was in the power o' man or baste to put me in sich a fright; but the longer we live we learn, boy.\"  Barney's disposition to make light of everything was thoroughly subdued by this incident, and he felt none of his usual inclination to regard all that he saw in the Brazilian forests with a comical eye.  The danger they had escaped was too real and terrible, and their almost unarmed condition too serious, to be lightly esteemed.  For the next hour or two he continued to walk by Martin's side either in total silence, or in earnest, grave conversation; but by degrees these feelings wore off, and his buoyant spirits gradually returned.  The country over which they had passed during the day was of a mingled character.  At one time they traversed a portion of dark forest heavy and choked up with the dense and gigantic foliage peculiar to those countries that lie near to the equator; then they emerged from this upon what to their eyes seemed most beautiful scenery,--mingled plain and woodland,--where the excessive brilliancy and beauty of the tropical vegetation was brought to perfection by exposure to the light of the blue sky and the warm rays of the sun.  In such lovely spots they travelled more slowly and rested more frequently, enjoying to the full the sight of the gaily-coloured birds and insects that fluttered busily around them, and the delicious perfume of the flowers that decked the ground and clambered up the trees.  At other times they came to plains, or _campos_, as they are termed, where there were no trees at all, and few shrubs, and where the grass was burned brown and dry by the sun. Over such they hurried as quickly as they could; and fortunately, where they chanced to travel, such places were neither numerous nor extensive, although in some districts of Brazil there are campos hundreds of miles in extent.  A small stream meandered through the forest and enabled them to refresh themselves frequently; which was very fortunate, for the heat, especially towards noon, became extremely intense, and they could not have existed without water.  So great, indeed, was the heat about mid-day, that, by mutual consent, they resolved to seek the cool shade of a spreading tree, and try to sleep if possible.  At this time they learned, to their surprise, that all animated nature did likewise, and sought repose at noon.  God had implanted in the breast of every bird and insect in that mighty forest an instinct which taught it to rest and find refreshment during the excessive heat of mid-day; so that during the space of two or three hours, not a thing with life was seen, and not a sound was heard.  Even the troublesome mosquitoes, so active at all other times, day and night were silent now.  The change was very great and striking, and difficult for those who have not observed it to comprehend.  All the forenoon, screams, and cries, and croaks, and grunts, and whistles, ring out through the woods incessantly; while, if you listen attentively, you hear the low, deep, and never-ending buzz and hum of millions upon millions of insects, that dance in the air and creep on every leaf and blade upon the ground.  About noon all this is hushed.  The hot rays of the sun beat perpendicularly down upon what seems a vast untenanted solitude, and not a single chirp breaks the death-like stillness of the great forest, with the solitary exception of the metallic note of the uruponga, or bell-bird, which seems to mount guard when all the rest of the world has gone to sleep.  As the afternoon approaches they all wake up, refreshed by their siesta, active and lively as fairies, and ready for another spell of work and another deep-toned noisy chorus.  The country through which our adventurers travelled, as evening approached, became gradually more hilly, and their march consequently more toilsome.  They were just about to give up all thought of proceeding farther that night, when, on reaching the summit of a little hill, they beheld a bright red light shining at a considerable distance in the valley beyond.  With light steps and hearts full of hope they descended the hill and hastened towards it.    CHAPTER NINE.  THE HERMIT.  It was now quite dark, and the whole country seemed alive with fire-flies.  These beautiful little insects sat upon the trees and bushes, spangling them as with living diamonds, and flew about in the air like little wandering stars.  Barney had seen them before, in the West Indies, but Martin had only heard of them; and his delight and amazement at their extreme brilliancy were very great.  Although he was naturally anxious to reach the light in the valley, in the hope that it might prove to proceed from some cottage, he could not refrain from stopping once or twice to catch these lovely creatures; and when he succeeded in doing so, and placed one on the palm of his hand, the light emitted from it was more brilliant than that of a small taper, and much more beautiful, for it was of a bluish colour, and very intense,--more like the light reflected from a jewel than a flame of fire.  He could have read a book by means of it quite easily.  In half an hour they drew near to the light, which they found proceeded from the window of a small cottage or hut.  \"Whist, Martin,\" whispered Barney, as they approached the hut on tiptoe; \"there may be savages into it, an' there's no sayin' what sort o' craturs they are in them parts.\"  When about fifty yards distant, they could see through the open window into the room where the light burned; and what they beheld there was well calculated to fill them with surprise.  On a rude wooden chair, at a rough unpainted table, a man was seated, with his head resting on his hand, and his eyes fixed intently on a book.  Owing to the distance, and the few leaves and branches that intervened between them and the hut, they could not observe him very distinctly.  But it was evident that he was a large and strong man, a little past the prime of life.  The hair of his head and beard was black and bushy, and streaked with silver-grey.  His face was massive, and of a dark olive complexion, with an expression of sadness on it strangely mingled with stern gravity. His broad shoulders--and, indeed, his whole person--were enveloped in the coarse folds of a long gown or robe, gathered in at the waist with a broad band of leather.  The room in which he sat--or rather the hut, for there was but one room in it--was destitute of all furniture, except that already mentioned, besides one or two roughly-formed stools; but the walls were completely covered with strange-looking implements and trophies of the chase; and in a corner lay a confused pile of books, some of which were, from their appearance, extremely ancient.  All this the benighted wanderers observed as they continued to approach cautiously on tiptoe.  So cautious did they become as they drew near, and came within the light of the lamp, that Barney at length attempted to step over his own shadow for fear of making a noise; and, in doing so, tripped and fell with considerable noise through a hedge of prickly shrubs that encircled the strange man's dwelling.  The hermit--for such he appeared to be--betrayed no symptom of surprise or fear at the sudden sound; but rising quietly, though quickly, from his seat took down a musket that hung on the wall, and, stepping to the open door, demanded sternly, in the Portuguese language, \"Who goes there?\"  \"Arrah, then, if ye'd help a fellow-cratur to rise, instead o' talkin' gibberish like that, it would be more to your credit!\" exclaimed the Irishman, as he scrambled to his feet and presented himself, along with Martin, at the hermit's door.  A peculiar smile lighted up the man's features as he retreated into the hut and invited the strangers to enter.  \"Come in,\" said he, in good English, although with a slightly foreign accent.  \"I am most happy to see you.  You are English.  I know the voice and the language very well.  Lived among them once, but long time past now--very long.  Have not seen one of you for many years.\"  With many such speeches, and much expression of good-will, the hospitable hermit invited Martin and his companion to sit down at his rude table, on which he quickly spread several plates of ripe and dried fruits, a few cakes, and a jar of excellent honey, with a stone bottle of cool water.  When they were busily engaged with these viands, he began to make inquiries as to where his visitors had come from.  \"We've comed from the sae,\" replied Barney, as he devoted himself to a magnificent pine-apple.  \"Och but yer victuals is mighty good, Mister-- what's yer name?--'ticklerly to them that's a'most starvin'.\"  \"The fact is,\" said Martin, \"our ship has been taken by pirates, and we two swam ashore, and lost"]]]
