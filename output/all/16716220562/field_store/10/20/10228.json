Accordingly, you will find collected within the four walls of that little room, knives and guns from Sheffield, cotton webs from Manchester, grindstones from Newcastle, tobacco from Virginia, and every sort of thing from I know not where all!  You can buy a blanket or a file, an axe or a pair of trousers, a pound of sugar or a barrel of nails, a roll of tobacco or a tin kettle,--everything, in short, that a man can think of or desire. And you can buy it, too, without money!  Indeed, you _must_ buy it without money, for there is not such a thing as money in the land.  The trade is carried on entirely by barter, or exchange.  The Indian gives the trader his furs, and the trader gives him his goods.  In order to make the exchange fair and equitable, however, everything is rated by a certain standard of value, which is called a _made-beaver_ in one part of the country, a _castore_ in another.  The first man that stepped forward to the counter was a chief.  A big, coarse-looking, disagreeable man, but a first-rate hunter.  He had two wives in consequence of his abilities, and the favourite wife now stood at his elbow to prompt, perhaps to caution, him.  He threw down a huge pack of furs, which the trader opened, and examined with care, fixing the price of each skin, and marking it down with a piece of chalk on the counter as he went along.  There were two splendid black bear-skins, two or three dozen martens, or sables, five or six black foxes, and a great many silver foxes, besides cross and red ones.  In addition to these, he had a number of minks and beaver-skins, a few otters, and sundry other furs, besides a few buffalo and deer-skins, dressed, and with the hair scraped off.  These last skins are used for making winter coats, and also moccasins for the feet.  After all had been examined and valued, the whole was summed up, and a number of pieces of stick were handed to the chief--each stick representing a castore; so that he knew exactly how much he was worth, and proceeded to choose accordingly.  First he gazed earnestly at a huge thick blanket, then he counted his sticks, and considered.  Perhaps the memory of the cold blasts of winter crossed his mind, for he quickly asked how many castores it was worth. The trader told him.  The proper number of pieces of stick were laid down, and the blanket was handed over.  Next a gun attracted his eye. The guns sent out for the Indian trade are very cheap ones, with blue barrels and red stocks.  They shoot pretty well, but are rather apt to burst.  Indeed this fate had befallen the chief's last gun, so he resolved to have another, and bought it.  Then he looked earnestly for some time at a tin kettle.  Boiled meat was evidently in his mind; but at this point his squaw plucked him by the sleeve.  She whispered in his ear.  A touch of generosity seemed to come over him, for he pointed to a web of bright scarlet cloth.  A yard of this was measured off, and handed to his spouse, whose happiness for the moment was complete--for squaws in Rupert's Land, like the fair sex in England, are uncommonly fond of finery.  As the chief proceeded, he became more cautious and slow in his choice. Finery tempted him on the one hand, necessaries pressed him on the other, and at this point the trader stepped in to help him to decide; he recommended, warned, and advised.  Twine was to be got for nets and fishing-lines, powder and shot, axes for cutting his winter firewood, cloth for his own and his wife's leggings, knives, tobacco, needles, and an endless variety of things, which gradually lessened his little pile of sticks, until at last he reached the sticking point, when all his sticks were gone.  \"Now, Darkeye,\" (that was the chief's name), \"you've come to the end at last, and a good thing you have made of it this year,\" said Mr Grant, in the Indian language.  \"Have you got all you want?\"  \"Darkeye wants bullets,\" said the chief.  \"Ah, to be sure.  You shall have a lot of these for nothing, and some tobacco too,\" said the trader, handing the gifts to the Indian.  A look of satisfaction lighted up the chief's countenance as he received the gifts, and made way for another Indian to open and display his pack of furs.  But Jasper was struck by a peculiar expression in the face of Darkeye.  Observing that he took up one of the bullets and showed it to another savage, our hunter edged near him to overhear the conversation.  \"Do you see that ball?\" said the chief, in a low tone.  The Indian to whom he spoke nodded.  \"Look here!\"  Darkeye put the bullet into his mouth as he spoke, and bit it until his strong sharp teeth sank deep into the lead; then, holding it up, he said, in the same low voice, \"You will know it again?\"  Once more the savage nodded, and a malicious smile played on his face for a moment.  Just then Mr Grant called out, \"Come here, Jasper, tell me what you think this otter-skin is worth.\"  Jasper's curiosity had been aroused by the mysterious conduct of Darkeye, and he would have given a good deal to have heard a little more of his conversation; but, being thus called away, he was obliged to leave his place, and soon forgot the incident.  During the whole of that day the trading of furs was carried on much as I have now described it.  Some of the Indians had large packs, and some had small, but all of them had sufficient to purchase such things as were necessary for themselves and their families during the approaching winter; and as each man received from Mr Grant a present of tobacco, besides a few trinkets of small value, they returned to the Hall that night in high good humour.  Next day, Jasper and his friends bade the hospitable trader farewell, and a few days after that the Indians left him.  They smoked a farewell pipe, then struck their tents, and placed them and their packs of goods in the canoes, with their wives, children, and dogs.  Pushing out into the stream, they commenced the return journey to their distant hunting-grounds.  Once more their shouts rang through the forest, and rolled over the water, and once more the paddles sent the sparkling drops into the air as they dashed ahead, round the point of rocks above the fort, and disappeared; leaving the fur-trader, as they found him, smoking his pipe, with his hands in his pockets, and leaning against the door-post of his once-again silent and solitary home.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  A SAVAGE FAMILY, AND A FIGHT WITH A BEAR.  About a week after our travellers left the outpost, Arrowhead had an adventure with a bear, which had well-nigh cut short his journey through this world, as well as his journey in the wilderness of Rupert's Land.  It was in the evening of a beautiful day when it happened.  The canoe had got among some bad rapids, and, as it advanced very slowly, young Heywood asked to be put on shore, that he might walk up the banks of the river, which were very beautiful, and sketch.  In half an hour he was far ahead of the canoe.  Suddenly, on turning round a rocky point, he found himself face to face with a small Indian boy.  It is probable that the little fellow had never seen a white man before, and it is certain that Heywood had never seen such a specimen of a brown boy.  He was clothed in skin, it is true, but it was the skin in which he had been born, for he had not a stitch of clothing on his fat little body.  As the man and the boy stood staring at each other, it would have been difficult to say which opened his eyes widest with amazement.  At first Heywood fancied the urchin was a wild beast of some sort on two legs, but a second glance convinced him that he was a real boy.  The next thought that occurred to the artist was, that he would try to sketch him, so he clapped his hand to his pocket, pulled out his book and pencil, and forthwith began to draw.  This terrified the little fellow so much, that he turned about and fled howling into the woods.  Heywood thought of giving chase, but a noise attracted his attention at that moment, and, looking across the river, he beheld the boy's father in the same cool dress as his son.  The man had been fishing, but when he saw that strangers were passing, he threw his blanket round him, jumped into his canoe, and crossed over to meet them.  This turned out to be a miserably poor family of Indians, consisting of the father, mother, three girls, and a boy, and a few ill-looking dogs. They all lived together in a little tent or wigwam, made partly of skins and partly of birch-bark.  This tent was shaped like a cone.  The fire was kindled inside, in the middle of the floor.  A hole in the side served for a door, and a hole in the top did duty for window and chimney.  The family kettle hung above the fire, and the family circle sat around it.  A dirtier family and filthier tent one could not wish to see.  The father was a poor weakly man and a bad hunter; the squaw was thin, wrinkled, and very dirty, and the children were all sickly-looking, except the boy before mentioned, who seemed to enjoy more than his fair share of health and rotundity.  \"Have ye got anything to eat?\" inquired Jasper, when the canoe reached the place.  They had not got much, only a few fish and an owl.  \"Poor miserable critters,\" said Jasper, throwing them a goose and a lump of venison; \"see there--that'll keep the wolf out o' yer insides for some time.  Have ye got anything to smoke?\"  No, they had nothing to smoke but a few dried leaves.  \"Worse and worse,\" cried Jasper, pulling a large plug of tobacco from the breast of his coat; \"here, that'll keep you puffin' for a short bit, anyhow.\"  Heywood, although no smoker himself, carried a small supply of tobacco just to give away to Indians, so he added two or three plugs to Jasper's gift, and Arrowhead gave the father a few charges of powder and shot. They then stepped into their canoe, and pushed off with that feeling of light hearted happiness which always follows the doing of a kind action.  \"There's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#6)"],["body"," up the river,\" said the Indian, as they were leaving.  \"Have ye seen them?\" inquired Jasper.  \"Ay, but could not shoot--no powder, no ball.  Look out for them!\"  \"That will I,\" replied the hunter, and in another moment the canoe was out among the rapids again, advancing slowly up the river.  In about an hour afterwards they came to a part of the river where the banks were high and steep.  Here Jasper landed to look for the tracks of the bears.  He soon found these, and as they appeared to be fresh, he prepared to follow them up.  \"We may as well encamp here,\" said he to Arrowhead; \"you can go and look for the bears.  I will land the baggage, and haul up the canoe, and then take my gun and follow you.  I see that our friend Heywood is at work with his pencil already.\"  This was true.  The keen artist was so delighted with the scene before him, that the moment the canoe touched the land he had jumped out, and, seating himself on the trunk of a fallen tree, with book and pencil, soon forgot everything that was going on around him.  Arrowhead shouldered his gun and went away up the river.  Jasper soon finished what he had to do, and followed him, leaving Heywood seated on the fallen tree.  Now the position which Heywood occupied was rather dangerous.  The tree lay on the edge of an overhanging bank of clay, about ten feet above the water, which was deep and rapid at that place.  At first the young man sat down on the tree-trunk near its root, but after a time, finding the position not quite to his mind, he changed it, and went close to the edge of the bank.  He was so much occupied with his drawing, that he did not observe that the ground on which his feet rested actually overhung the stream.  As his weight rested on the fallen tree, however, he remained there safe enough and busy for half an hour.  At the end of that time he was disturbed by a noise in the bushes. Looking up, he beheld a large brown bear coming straight towards him. Evidently the bear did not see him, for it was coming slowly and lazily along, with a quiet meditative expression on its face.  The appearance of the animal was so sudden and unexpected, that poor Heywood's heart almost leaped into his mouth.  His face grew deadly pale, his long hair almost rose on his head with terror, and he was utterly unable to move hand or foot.  In another moment the bear was within three yards of him, and, being taken by surprise, it immediately rose on its hind legs, which is the custom of bears when about to make or receive an attack.  It stared for a moment at the horrified artist.  Let not my reader think that Heywood's feelings were due to cowardice. The bravest of men have been panic-stricken when taken by surprise.  The young man had never seen a bear before, except in a cage, and the difference between a caged and a free bear is very great.  Besides, when a rough-looking monster of this kind comes unexpectedly on a man who is unarmed, and has no chance of escape, and rises on its hind legs, as if to let him have a full view of its enormous size, its great strength, and its ugly appearance, he may well be excused for feeling a little uncomfortable, and looking somewhat uneasy.  When the bear rose, as I have said, Heywood's courage returned.  His first act was to fling his sketch-book in Bruin's face, and then, uttering a loud yell, he sprang to his feet, intending to run away.  But the violence of his action broke off the earth under his feet.  He dropt into the river like a lump of lead, and was whirled away in a moment!  What that bear thought when it saw the man vanish from the spot like a ghost, of course I cannot tell.  It certainly _looked_ surprised, and, if it was a bear of ordinary sensibility, it must undoubtedly have _felt_ astonished.  At any rate, after standing there, gazing for nearly a minute in mute amazement at the spot where Heywood had disappeared, it let itself down on its forelegs, and, turning round, walked slowly back into the bushes.  Poor Heywood could not swim, so the river did what it pleased with him. After sweeping him out into the middle of the stream, and rolling him over five or six times, and whirling him round in an eddy close to the land, and dragging him out again into the main current, and sending him struggling down a rapid, it threw him at last, like a bundle of old clothes, on a shallow, where he managed to get on his feet, and staggered to the shore in a most melancholy plight.  Thereafter he returned to the encampment, like a drowned rat, with his long hair plastered to his thin face, and his soaked garments clinging tightly to his slender body.  Had he been able to see himself at that moment, he would have laughed, but, not being able to see himself, and feeling very miserable, he sighed and shuddered with cold, and then set to work to kindle a fire and dry himself.  Meanwhile the bear continued its walk up the river.  Arrowhead, after a time, lost the track of the bear he was in search of, and, believing that it was too late to follow it up farther that night, he turned about, and began to retrace his steps.  Not long after that, he and the bear met face to face.  Of course, the Indian's gun was levelled in an instant, but the meeting was so sudden, that the aim was not so true as usual, and, although the ball mortally wounded the animal, it did not kill him outright.  There was no time to re-load, so Arrowhead dropped his gun and ran.  He doubled as he ran, and made for the encampment; but the bear ran faster. It was soon at the Indian's heels.  Knowing that farther flight was useless, Arrowhead drew the hatchet that hung at his belt, and, turning round, faced the infuriated animal, which instantly rose on its hind legs and closed with him.  The Indian met it with a tremendous blow of his axe, seized it by the throat with his left hand, and endeavoured to repeat the blow.  [See frontispiece.] But brave and powerful though he was, the Indian was like a mere child in the paw of the bear.  The axe descended with a crash on the monster's head, and sank into its skull.  But bears are notoriously hard to kill.  This one scarcely seemed to feel the blow.  Next instant Arrowhead was down, and, with its claws fixed in the man's back, the bear held him down, while it began to gnaw the fleshy part of his left shoulder.  No cry escaped from the prostrate hunter.  He determined to lie perfectly still, as if he were dead, that being his only chance of escape; but the animal was furious, and there is little doubt that the Indian's brave spirit would soon have fled, had not God mercifully sent Jasper Derry to his relief.  That stout hunter had been near at hand when the shot was fired.  He at once ran in the direction whence the sound came, and arrived on the scene of the struggle just as Arrowhead fell.  Without a moment's hesitation he dropt on one knee, took a quick but careful aim and fired. The ball entered the bear's head just behind the ear and rolled it over dead!  Arrowhead's first act on rising was to seize the hand of his deliverer, and in a tone of deep feeling exclaimed, \"My brother!\"  \"Ay,\" said Jasper with a quiet smile, as he reloaded his gun; \"this is not the first time that you and I have helped one another in the nick of time, Arrowhead; we shall be brothers, and good friends to boot, I hope, as long as we live.\"  \"Good,\" said the Indian, a smile lighting up for one moment his usually grave features.  \"But my brother is wounded, let me see,\" said Jasper.  \"It will soon be well,\" said the Indian carelessly, as he took off his coat and sat down on the bank, while the white hunter examined his wounds.  This was all that was said on the subject by these two men.  They were used to danger in every form, and had often saved each other from sudden death.  The Indian's wounds, though painful, were trifling.  Jasper dressed them in silence, and then, drawing his long hunting knife, he skinned and cut up the bear, while his companion lay down on the bank, smoked his pipe, and looked on.  Having cut off the best parts of the carcass for supper, the hunters returned to the canoe, carrying the skin along with them.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  RUNNING THE FALLS--WILD SCENES AND MEN.  Next day the travellers reached one of those magnificent lakes of which there are so many in the wild woods of North America, and which are so like to the great ocean itself, that it is scarcely possible to believe them to be bodies of fresh water until they are tasted.  The largest of these inland seas is the famous Lake Superior, which is so enormous in size that ships can sail on its broad bosom for several days _out_ _of_ _sight_ of land.  It is upwards of three hundred miles long, and about one hundred and fifty broad.  A good idea of its size may be formed from the fact, that it is large enough to contain the whole of Scotland, and deep enough to cover her highest hills!  The lake on which the canoe was now launched, although not so large as Superior, was, nevertheless, a respectable body of water, on which the sun was shining as if on a shield of bright silver.  There were numbers of small islets scattered over its surface; some thickly wooded to the water's edge, others little better than bare rocks.  Crossing this lake they came to the mouth of a pretty large stream and began to ascend it. The first thing they saw on rounding a bend in the stream was an Indian tent, and in front of this tent was an Indian baby, hanging from the branch of a tree.  Let not the reader be horrified.  The child was not hanging by the neck, but by the handle of its cradle, which its mother had placed there, to keep her little one out of the way of the dogs.  The Indian cradle is a very simple contrivance.  A young mother came out of the tent with her child just as the canoe arrived, and began to pack it in its cradle. Jasper stopped for a few minutes to converse with one of the Indians, so that the artist had a good opportunity of witnessing the whole"]]]
