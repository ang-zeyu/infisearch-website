BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  IN WHICH THE HERO MAKES HIS FIRST FLASH AND EXPLOSION.  Somewhere about the middle of this nineteenth century, a baby boy was born on the raging sea in the midst of a howling tempest.  That boy was the hero of this tale.  He was cradled in squalls, and nourished in squalor--a week of dirty weather having converted the fore-cabin of the emigrant ship into something like a pig-sty.  Appreciating the situation, no doubt, the baby boy began his career with a squall that harmonised with the weather, and, as the steward remarked to the ship's cook, \"continued for to squall straight on end all that day and night without so much as ever takin' breath!\"  It is but right to add that the steward was prone to exaggeration.  \"Stooard,\" said the ship's cook in reply, as he raised his eyes from the contemplation of his bubbling coppers, \"take my word for it, that there babby what has just bin launched ain't agoin' to shovel off his mortal coil--as the play-actor said--without makin' his mark some'ow an' somew'eres.\"  \"What makes you think so, Johnson?\" asked the steward.  \"What makes me think so, stooard?\" replied the cook, who was a huge good-natured young man.  \"Well, I'll tell 'ee.  I was standin' close to the fore hatch at the time, a-talkin' to Jim Brag, an' the father o' the babby, poor feller, he was standin' by the foretops'l halyards holdin' on to a belayin'-pin, an' lookin' as white as a sheet--for I got a glance at 'im two or three times doorin' the flashes o' lightnin'. Well, stooard, there was lightnin' playin' round the mizzen truck, an' the main truck, an' the fore truck, an' at the end o' the flyin' jib-boom, an' the spanker boom; then there came a flash that seemed to set afire the entire univarse; then a burst o' thunder like fifty great guns gone off all at once in a hurry.  At that identical moment, stooard, there came up from the fore-cabin a yell that beat--well, I can't rightly say what it beat, but it minded me o' that unfortnit pig as got his tail jammed in the capstan off Cape Horn.  The father gave a gasp.  `It's born,' says he.  `More like's if it's basted,' growled Jim Brag.  `You're a unfeelin' monster, Brag,' says I; `an' though you _are_ the ship's carpenter, I _will_ say it, you 'aven't got no more sympathy than the fluke of an anchor!'  Hows'ever the poor father didn't hear the remark, for he went down below all of a heap--head, legs, and arms-- anyhow.  Then there came another yell, an' another, an' half a dozen more, which was followed by another flash o' lightnin' an' drownded in another roar o' thunder; but the yells from below kep' on, an' came out strong between times, makin' no account whatever o' the whistlin' wind an' rattlin' ropes, which they riz above--easy.--Now, stooard, do you mean for to tell me that all that signifies nothink?  Do you suppose that that babby could go through life like an or'nary babby?  No, it couldn't--not even if it was to try--w'ich it _won't_!\"  Having uttered this prophecy the cook resumed the contemplation of his bubbling coppers.  \"Well, I suppose you're right, John Johnson,\" said the steward.  \"Yes, I'm right, Tom Thomson,\" returned the cook, with the nod and air of a man who is never wrong.  And the cook _was_ right, as the reader who continues to read shall find out in course of time.  The gale in which little Robin Wright was thus launched upon the sea of Time blew the sails of that emigrant ship--the Seahorse--to ribbons.  It also blew the masts out of her, leaving her a helpless wreck on the breast of the palpitating sea.  Then it blew a friendly sail in sight, by which passengers and crew were rescued and carried safe back to Old England.  There they separated--some to re-embark in other emigrant ships; some to renew the battle of life at home--thenceforward and for ever after to vilify the sea in all its aspects, except when viewed at a safe distance from the solid land!  Little Robin's parents were among the latter.  His father, a poor gentleman, procured a situation as accountant in a mercantile house. His mother busied herself--and she was a very busy little creature--with the economics of home.  She clothed Robin's body and stored his mind. Among other things, she early taught him to read from the Bible.  As Robin grew he waxed strong and bold and lively, becoming a source of much anxiety, mingled with delight, to his mother, and of considerable alarm, mixed with admiration and surprise, to his father.  He possessed an inquisitive mind.  He inquired into everything--including the antique barometer and the household clock, both of which were heirlooms, and were not improved by his inquiries.  Strange to say, Robin's chief delight in those early days was a thunderstorm.  The rolling of heaven's artillery seemed to afford inexpressible satisfaction to his little heart, but it was the lightning that affected him most.  It filled him with a species of awful joy.  No matter how it came--whether in the forked flashes of the storm, or the lambent gleamings of the summer sky--he would sit and gaze at it in solemn wonder.  Even in his earliest years he began to make inquiries into that remarkable and mysterious agent.  \"Musser,\" he said one day, during a thunderstorm, raising his large eyes to his mother's face with intense gravity,--\"Musser, what is lightenin'?\"  Mrs Wright, who was a soft little unscientific lady with gorgeous eyes, sat before her son, perplexed.  \"Well, child, it is--it--really, I don't know what it is!\"  \"Don't know?\" echoed Robin, with surprise, \"I sought you know'd everysing.\"  \"No, not everything, dear,\" replied Mrs Wright, with a deprecatory smile; \"but here comes your father, who will tell you.\"  \"Does _he_ know everysing?\" asked the child.  \"N-no, not exactly; but he knows many things--oh, _ever_ so many things,\" answered the cautious wife and mother.  The accountant had barely crossed his humble threshold and sat down, when Robin clambered on his knee and put the puzzling question.--\"Fasser, what is lightenin'?\"  \"Lightning, my boy?--why, it's--it's--let me see--it's fire, of course, of some sort, that comes out o' the clouds and goes slap into the earth--there, don't you see it?\"  Robin did see it, and was so awestruck by the crash which followed the blinding flash that he forgot at the moment to push his inquiries further, much to his father's satisfaction, who internally resolved to hunt up the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ that very evening--letter L--and study it.  In process of time Robin increased in size.  As he expanded in body he developed in mind and in heart, for his little mother, although profoundly ignorant of electricity and its effects, was deeply learned in the Scriptures.  But Robin did not hunger in vain after scientific knowledge.  By good fortune he had a cousin--cousin Sam Shipton--who was fourteen years older than himself, and a clerk at a neighbouring railway station, where there was a telegraphic instrument.  Now, Sam, being himself possessed of strongly scientific tendencies, took a great fancy to little Robin, and sought to enlighten his young mind on many subjects where \"musser's\" knowledge failed.  Of course he could not explain all that he himself knew about electricity--the child was too young for that,--but he did what he could, and introduced him one day to the interior of the station, where he filled his youthful mind with amazement and admiration by his rapid, and apparently meaningless, manipulation of the telegraph instrument.  Cousin Sam, however, did a good deal more for him than that in the course of time; but before proceeding further, we must turn aside for a few minutes to comment on that wonderful subject which is essentially connected with the development of this tale.    CHAPTER TWO.  REFERS TO A NOTABLE CHARACTER.  Sparks, as a rule, are looked upon as a race of useless and disreputable fellows.  Their course is usually erratic.  They fly upward, downward, forward, and backward--here, there, and everywhere.  You never know when you have them, or what will be their next flight.  They often create a good deal of alarm, sometimes much surprise; they seldom do any good, and frequently cause irreparable damage.  Only when caught and restrained, or directed, do sparks become harmless and helpful.  But there is one Spark in this world--a grand, glowing, gushing fellow-- who has not his equal anywhere.  He is old as the hills--perhaps older-- and wide as the world--perchance wider.  Similar to ordinary sparks in some respects, he differs from them in several important particulars. Like many, he is \"fast,\" but immeasurably faster than all other sparks put together.  Unlike them, however, he submits to be led by master minds.  Stronger than Hercules, he can rend the mountains.  Fleeter than Mercury, he can outstrip the light.  Gentler than Zephyr, he can assume the condition of a current, and enter our very marrow without causing pain.  His name is Electricity.  No one knows what he is.  Some philosophers have said that he is a fluid, because he flows.  As well might they call him a wild horse because he bolts, or a thief because he lurks!  We prefer to call him a Spark, because in that form only is he visible--at least when handled by man.  Talking of that, it was not until the last century that master minds found out how to catch and handle our Spark.  In all the previous centuries he had been roaming gaily about the world in perfect freedom; sometimes gliding silently to and fro like an angel of light; sometimes leaping forth with frightful energy in the midst of raging tempest, like a destructive demon--ripping, rending, shattering all that attempted to arrest his course.  Men have feared and shunned him since the beginning of time, and with good reason, for he has killed many of the human race.  But although uncaught and untamed by them, our Spark was not altogether unknown to the ancients.  So far back as the year"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21716"],["title","The Battery and the Boiler: Adventures in Laying of Submarine Electric Cables (#1)"],["body","before the Christian era, Thales, one of the Greek sages, discovered that he hid himself in amber, a substance which in Greek is named _electron_--hence his name Electricity; but the ancients knew little about his character, though Thales found that he could draw him from his hiding-place by rubbing him with silk and some other substances.  When thus rubbed he became attractive, and drew light creatures towards him--not unlike human sparks!  He also showed himself to be fickle, for, after holding these light creatures tight for a brief space, he let them go and repelled them.  It was not till the days of good Queen Bess, towards the end of the sixteenth century, that a Dr Gilbert discovered that the wild fellow lay lurking in other substances besides amber--such as sulphur, wax, glass, etcetera.  It is now known that Electricity permeates all substances more or less, and only waits to be roused in order to exhibit his amazing powers.  He is fond of shocking people's feelings, and has surprised his pursuers rather frequently in that way.  Some of them, indeed, he has actually shocked to death!  It would take a huge volume to give a detailed account of all the qualities, powers, and peculiarities of this wild Spark.  We will just touch on a few facts which are necessary to the elucidation of our tale.  A great event in the world's history happened in the year 1745.  It was nothing less than the capture and imprisonment of wild, daring, dashing Electricity.  To the Dutch philosophers belongs the honour of catching him.  They caught him--they even bottled him, like ordinary spirits, and called his prison a _Leyden Jar_.  From that date our Spark became the useful and obedient slave of man. Yet is he ever ready, when the smallest conceivable door, hole, or chink is left open, to dash out of the prison-house man has made for him, and escape into his native earth.  He has no hope now, however, of escaping altogether, for he cannot resist the allurement of rubbing, by which, as well as by chemical action and other means, we can summon him, like the genii of Aladdin's lamp, at any moment, from the \"vasty deep,\" and compel him to do our work.  And what sort of work, it may be asked, can this volatile fellow perform?  We cannot tell all--the list is too long.  Let us consider a few of them.  If we fabricate tea-pots, sugar-basins, spoons, or anything else of base metal, he can and will, at our bidding, cover the same with silver or yellow gold.  If we grow dissatisfied with our candles and gas, he will, on being summoned, and properly directed by the master minds to whom he owns allegiance, kindle our lamps and fill our streets and mansions with a blaze of noonday splendour.  If we grow weary of steam, and give him orders, he will drive our tram-cars and locomotives with railway speed, _minus_ railway smoke and fuss.  He is a very giant in the chemist's laboratory, and, above all, a swift messenger to carry the world's news.  Even when out and raging to and fro in a wild state, more than half-disposed to rend our mansions, and split our steeples, and wreck our ships, we have only to provide him with a tiny metal stair-case, down which he will instantly glide from the upper regions to the earth without noise or damage.  Shakespeare never imagined, and Mercury never accomplished, the speed at which he travels; and he will not only carry our news, or express our sentiments and wishes far and wide over the land, but he will rush with them, over rock, sand, mud, and ooze, along the bottom of the deep deep sea!  And this brings us to a point.  Some of the master minds before mentioned, having conceived the idea that telegraphic communication might be carried on under water, set about experimenting.  Between the years 1839 and 1851 enterprising men in the Old World and the New suggested, pondered, planned, and placed wires under water, along which our Spark ran more or less successfully.  One of the difficulties of these experiments consisted in this, that, while the Spark runs readily along one class of substances, he cannot, or will not, run along others.  Substances of the first class, comprising the metals, are called conductors; those of the second class, embracing, among other things, all resinous substances, are styled non-conductors.  Now, water is a good conductor.  So that although the Spark will stick to his wires when insulated on telegraph-posts on land, he will bolt from them at once and take to flight the moment he gets under water.  This difficulty was overcome by coating the wires with gutta-percha, which, being a non-conductor, imprisoned the Spark, and kept him, as it were, on the line.  A copper wire covered in this manner was successfully laid between England and France in 1850.  When tested, this cable did not work well. Minute imperfections, in the form of air-holes in the gutta-percha, afforded our Spark an opportunity to bolt; and he did bolt, as a matter of course--for electricity has no sense of honour, and cannot be trusted near the smallest loop-hole.  The imperfections were remedied; the door was effectually locked, after which the first submarine cable of importance was actually laid down, and worked well.  French and English believers turned up hands and eyes in delighted amazement, as they held converse across the sea, while unbelievers were silenced and confounded.  This happy state of things, however, lasted for only a few hours. Suddenly the intercourse ceased.  The telegraphists at both ends energised with their handles and needles, but without any result.  The cable was dumb.  Our Spark had evidently escaped!  There is no effect without a cause.  The cause of that interruption was soon discovered.  Early that morning a French fisherman had sauntered down to the port of Boulogne and embarked in his boat.  A British seaman, having nothing to do but smoke and meditate, was seated on a coil of rope at the time, enjoying himself and the smells with which that port is not unfamiliar. He chanced to be a friend of that French fisherman.  \"You're early afloat, Mounseer,\" he said.  \"Oui, monsieur.  Vill you com'?  I go for feesh.\"  \"Well, _wee_; I go for fun.\"  They went accordingly and bore away to the northward along the coast before a light breeze,--past the ruined towers which France had built to guard her port in days gone by; past the steep cliffs beyond Boulogne; past the lovely beach of Wimereux, with its cottages nestled among the sand-hills, and its silted-up harbour, whence Napoleon the First had intended to issue forth and descend on perfidious Albion--but didn't; past cliffs, and bays, and villages further on, until they brought up off Cape Grisnez.  Here the Frenchman let down his trawl, and fished up, among other curiosities of the deep, the submarine cable!  \"Behold! fat is dis?\" he exclaimed, with glaring eyes, uplifted brows, shoulders shrugged, hands spread out, and fingers expanded.  \"The sea-sarpint grow'd thin,\" suggested the Englishman.  \"Non; c'est seaveed--veed de most 'strordinair in de vorld.  Oui, donnez-moi de hache, de hax, mon ami.\"  His friend handed him the axe, wherewith lie cut off a small portion of the cable and let the end go.  Little did that fisherman know that he had also let our Spark go free, and cruelly dashed, for a time at least, the budding hopes of two nations--but so it was.  He bore his prize in triumph to Boulogne, where he exhibited it as a specimen of rare seaweed with its centre filled with gold, while the telegraph clerks at both ends sat gazing in dismay at their useless instruments.  Thus was the first submarine electric cable destroyed.  And with the details of its destruction little Robin was intimately acquainted, for cousin Sam had been a member of the staff that had worked that telegraph--at least he had been a boy in the office,--and in after years he so filled his cousin's mind with the importance of that cable, and the grandeur and difficulty of the enterprise, that Robin became powerfully sympathetic--so much so that when Sam, in telling the story, came to the point where the Frenchman accomplished its destruction, Robin used to grieve over it as though he had lost a brother, or a kitten, or his latest toy!  We need scarcely add that submarine cable telegraphy had not received its death-blow on that occasion.  Its possibility had been demonstrated. The very next year (1851) Mr T.R. Crampton, with Messrs. Wollaston, Kuper, and others, made and laid an improved cable between Dover and Calais, and ere long many other parts of the world were connected by means of snaky submarine electric cables.    CHAPTER THREE.  EARLY ASPIRATIONS.  One pleasant summer afternoon, Mr Wright, coming in from the office, seated himself beside his composed little wife, who was patching a pair of miniature pantaloons.  \"Nan,\" said the husband, with a perplexed look, \"what _are_ we to do with our Robin when he grows up?\"  \"George,\" answered the composed wife, \"don't you think it is rather soon to trouble ourselves with that question?  Robin is a mere child yet.  We must first give him a good education.\"  \"Of course, I know that,\" returned the perplexed husband, \"still, I can't help thinking about what is to be done after he has had the good education.  You know I have no relation in the world except brother Richard, who is as poor as myself.  We have no influential friends to help him into the Army or the Navy or the Indian Civil Service; and the Church, you know, is not suitable for an imp.  Just look at him _now_!\"  Mrs Wright looked through the window, over one of those sunny landscapes which are usually described as \"smiling,\" across a winding rivulet, and at last fixed her gorgeous eyes on a tall post, up which a small black object was seen to be struggling.  \"What can he be up to?\" said the father.  \"He seems to be up the telegraph-post,\" said the mother, \"investigating the wires, no doubt.  I heard him talking about telegraphy to Madge this morning--re"]]]
