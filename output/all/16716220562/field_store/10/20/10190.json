CHAPTER TWO.  HEADQUARTERS--THE MEN--DISPUTATION AND UNCERTAINTY--NEW USES FOR THE SKINS OF DEAD BOYS!--MUTINOUS RESOLVES.  Moose Fort, the headquarters and depot of the fur-traders, who prosecute their traffic in almost all parts of the wild and uninhabited regions of North America, stands on an island near the mouth of Moose River.  Like all the establishments of the fur-traders, it is a solitary group of wooden buildings, far removed beyond the influences--almost beyond the ken--of the civilised world, and surrounded by the primeval wilderness, the only tenants of which were, at the time we write of, a few scattered tribes of Muskigon Indians, and the wild animals whose flesh furnished them with food and whose skins constituted their sole wealth.  There was little of luxury at Moose Fort.  The walls of the houses within the stockade, that served more as an ornament than a defence, were of painted, in some cases unpainted, planks.  The floors, ceilings, chairs, tables, and, in short, all the articles of furniture in the place, were made of the same rough material.  A lofty scaffolding of wood rose above the surrounding buildings, and served as an outlook, whence, at the proper season, longing eyes were wont to be turned towards the sea in expectation of \"the ship\" which paid the establishment an annual visit from England.  Several large iron field-pieces stood before the front gate; but they were more for the sake of appearance than use, and were never fired except for the purpose of saluting the said ship on the occasions of her arrival and departure.  The first boom of the cannon unlocks the long-closed portals of connection between Moose Fort and England; the second salvo shuts them up again in their frozen domains for another year!  A century and a half ago, the band of \"adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay\" felled the first trees and pitched their tents on the shores of James's Bay, and successive generations of fur-traders have kept the post until the present day; yet there is scarcely a symptom of the presence of man beyond a few miles round the establishment.  Years ago the fort was built, and there it stands now, with new tenants, it is true, but in its general aspect unchanged; and there it is likely to remain, wrapped in its barrier of all but impregnable solitude, for centuries to come.  Nevertheless, Moose is a comfortable place in its way, and when contrasted with other trading establishments is a very palace and temple of luxury.  There are men within its walls who can tell of log-huts and starvation, solitude and desolation, compared with which Moose is a terrestrial paradise.  Frank Morton, whom we have introduced in the first chapter, said, on his arrival at Moose, that it appeared to him to be the very fag-end of creation.  He had travelled night and day for six weeks from what he considered the very outskirts of civilisation, through uninhabited forests and almost unknown rivers, in order to get to it; and while the feeling of desolation that overwhelmed him on his first arrival was strong upon him, he sighed deeply, and called it a \"horrid dull hole.\"  But Frank was of a gay, hearty, joyous disposition, and had not been there long ere he loved the old fort dearly.  Poor fellow! far removed though he was from his fellow-men at Moose, he afterwards learned that he had but obtained an indistinct notion of the signification of the word \"solitude.\"  There were probably about thirty human beings at Moose, when Mr George Stanley, one of the principal fur-traders of the place, received orders from the governor to make preparations, and select men, for the purpose of proceeding many hundred miles deeper into the northern wilderness, and establishing a station on the distant, almost unknown, shores of Ungava Bay.  No one at Moose had ever been there before; no one knew anything about the route, except from the vague report of a few Indians; and the only thing that was definitely known about the locality at all was, that its inhabitants were a few wandering tribes of Esquimaux, who were at deadly feud with the Indians, and generally massacred all who came within their reach.  What the capabilities of the country were, in regard to timber and provisions, nobody knew, and, fortunately for the success of the expedition, nobody cared!  At least those who were to lead the way did not; and this admirable quality of total indifference to prospective dangers is that which, to a great extent, insures success in a forlorn hope.  Of the leaders of this expedition the reader already knows something. George Stanley was nearly six feet high, forty years of age, and endued with a decision of character that, but for his quiet good humour, would have been deemed obstinacy.  He was deliberate in all his movements, and exercised a control over his feelings that quite concealed his naturally enthusiastic disposition.  Moreover, he was married, and had a daughter of ten years of age.  This might be thought a disadvantage in his present circumstances; but the governor of the fur-traders, a most energetic and active ruler, thought otherwise.  He recommended that the family should be left at Moose until an establishment had been built, and a winter passed at Ungava.  Afterwards they could join him there. As for Frank Morton, he was an inch taller than his friend Stanley, and equally powerful; fair-haired, blue-eyed, hilarious, romantic, twenty-two years of age, and so impulsive that, on hearing of the proposed expedition from one of his comrades, who happened to be present when Stanley was reading the dispatches, he sprang from his chair, which he upset, dashed out at the door, which he banged, and hurried to his friend's quarters in order to be first to volunteer his services as second in command; which offer was rendered unnecessary by Stanley's exclaiming, the moment he entered his room--  \"Ha, Frank, my lad, the very man I wanted to see!  Here's a letter from headquarters ordering me off on an expedition to Ungava.  Now, I want volunteers; will you go!\"  It is needless to add that Frank's blue eyes sparkled with animation as he seized his friend's hand and replied, \"To the North Pole if you like, or farther if need be!\"  It was evening.  The sun was gilding the top of the flagstaff with a parting kiss, and the inhabitants of Moose Fort, having finished their daily toil, were making preparations for their evening meal.  On the end of the wharf that jutted out into the stream was assembled a picturesque group of men, who, from the earnest manner in which they conversed, and the energy of their gesticulations, were evidently discussing a subject of more than ordinary interest.  Most of them were clad in corduroy trousers, gartered below the knee with thongs of deer-skin, and coarse, striped cotton shirts, open at the neck, so as to expose their sunburnt breasts.  A few wore caps which, whatever might have been their original form, were now so much soiled and battered out of shape by long and severe service that they were nondescript; but most of these hardy backwoodsmen were content with the covering afforded by their thick, bushy locks.  \"No, no,\" exclaimed a short, thick-set, powerful man, with a somewhat ascetic cast of countenance; \"I've seen more than enough o' these rascally Huskies [Esquimaux].  'Tis well for me that I'm here this blessed day, an' not made into a dan to bob about in Hudson's Straits at the tail of a white whale, like that poor boy Peter who was shot by them varmints.\"  \"What's a dan?\" asked a young half-breed who had lately arrived at Moose, and knew little of Esquimau implements.  \"What a green-horn you must be, Francois, not to know what a dan is!\" replied another, who was inclined to be quizzical.  \"Why, it's a sort of sea-carriage that the Esquimaux tie to the tail of a walrus or sea-horse when they feel inclined for a drive.  When they can't get a sea-horse they catch a white whale asleep, and wake him up after fastening the dan to his tail.  I suppose they have conjurers or wizards among them, since Massan told us just now that poor Peter was--\"  \"Bah! gammon,\" interrupted Francois with a smile, as he turned to the first speaker.  \"But tell me, Massan, what is a dan?\"  \"It's a sort o' float or buoy, lad, used by the Huskies, and is made out o' the skin o' the seal.  They tie it with a long line to their whale spears to show which way the fish bolts when struck.\"  \"And did they use Peter's skin for such a purpose?\" inquired Francois earnestly.  \"They did,\" replied Massan.  \"And did you see them do it?\"  \"Yes, I did.\"  Francois gazed intently into his comrade's face as he spoke; but Massan was an adept at what is usually called drawing the long bow, and it was with the most imperturbable gravity that he continued--  \"Yes, I saw them do it; but I could not render any assistance to the poor child, for I was lying close behind a rock at the time, with an arrow sticking between my shoulders, and a score o' them oily varmints a-shoutin', and yellin', and flourishing their spears in search o' me.\"  \"Tell us how it happened, Massan.  Let's hear the story,\" chorused the men, as they closed round their comrade.  \"Well then,\" began the stout backwoodsman, proceeding leisurely to fill his pipe from an ornamented bag that hung at his belt, \"here goes.  It was about the year--a--I forget the year, but it don't matter--that we were ordered off on an expedition to the Huskies; 'xactly sich a one as they wants us to go on now, and--but you've heerd o' that business, lads, haven't you?\"  \"Yes, yes, we've heard all about it; go on.\"  \"Well,\" continued Massan, \"I needn't be wastin' time tellin' you how we failed in that affair, and how the Huskies killed some of our men and burnt our ship to the water's edge.  After it was all over, and they thought they had killed us all, I was, as I said, lyin'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21707"],["title","Ungava (#2)"],["body","a great rock in a sort o' cave, lookin' at the dirty villains as they danced about on the shore, and took possession of all our goods.  Suddenly I seed two o' them carry Peter down to the beach, an' I saw, as they passed me, that he was quite dead.  In less time than I can count a hundred they took the skin off him, cut off his head, sewed up the hole, tied his arms and legs in a knot, blew him full o' wind till he was fit to bu'st, an' then hung him up to dry in the sun!  In fact, they made a _dan_ of him!\"  A loud shout of laughter greeted this startling conclusion.  In truth, we must do Massan the justice to say, that although he was much in the habit of amusing his companions by entertaining them with anecdotes which originated entirely in his own teeming fancy, he never actually _deceived_ them, but invariably, either by a sly glance or by the astounding nature of his communication, gave them to understand that he was dealing not with fact but fiction.  \"But seriously, lads,\" said Francois, whose intelligence, added to a grave, manly countenance and a tall, muscular frame, caused him to be regarded by his comrades as a sort of leader both in action and in council, \"what do you think of our bourgeois' plan?  For my part, I'm willing enough to go to any reasonable part o' the country where there are furs and Indians; but as for this Ungava, from what Massan says, there's neither Indians, nor furs, nor victuals--nothin' but rocks, and mountains, and eternal winter; and if we do get the Huskies about us, they'll very likely serve us as they did the last expedition to Richmond Gulf.\"  \"Ay, ay,\" cried one of the others, \"you may say that, Francois.  Nothin' but frost and starvation, and nobody to bury us when we're dead.\"  \"Except the Huskies,\" broke in another, \"who would save themselves the trouble by converting us all into dans!\"  \"Tush, man! stop your clapper,\" cried Francois, impatiently; \"let us settle this business.  You know that Monsieur Stanley said he would expect us to be ready with an answer to-night.--What think you, Gaspard? Shall we go, or shall we mutiny?\"  The individual addressed was a fine specimen of an animal, but not by any means a good specimen of a man.  He was of gigantic proportions, straight and tall as a poplar, and endowed with the strength of a Hercules.  His glittering dark eyes and long black hair, together with the hue of his skin, bespoke him of half-breed extraction.  But his countenance did not correspond to his fine physical proportions.  True, his features were good, but they wore habitually a scowling, sulky expression, even when the man was pleased, and there was more of sarcasm than joviality in the sound when Gaspard condescended to laugh.  \"I'll be shot if I go to such a hole for the best bourgeois in the country,\" said he in reply to Francois' question.  \"You'll be dismissed the service if you don't,\" remarked Massan with a smile.  To this Gaspard vouchsafed no reply save a growl that, to say the best of it, did not sound amiable.  \"Well, I think that we're all pretty much of one mind on the point,\" continued Francois; \"and yet I feel half ashamed to refuse after all, especially when I see the good will with which Messieurs Stanley and Morton agree to go.\"  \"I suppose _you_ expect to be a bourgeois too some day,\" growled Gaspard with a sneer.  \"Eh, tu gros chien!\" cried Francois, as with flashing eyes and clinched fists he strode up to his ill-tempered comrade.  \"Come, come, Francois; don't quarrel for nothing,\" said Massan, interposing his broad shoulders and pushing him vigorously back.  At that moment an exclamation from one of the men diverted the attention of the others.  \"Voila! the canoe.\"  \"Ay, it's Monsieur Stanley's canoe.  I saw him and Monsieur Morton start for the swamp this morning.\"  \"I wonder what Dick Prince would have done in this business had he been here,\" said Francois to Massan in a low tone, as they stood watching the approach of their bourgeois' canoe.  \"Can't say.  I half think he would have gone.\"  \"There's no chance of him coming back in time, I fear.\"  \"None; unless he prevails on some goose to lend him a pair of wings for a day or two.  He won't be back from the hunt for three weeks good.\"  In a few minutes more the canoe skimmed up to the wharf.  \"Here, lads,\" cried Mr Stanley, as he leaped ashore and dragged the canoe out of the water; \"one of you come and lift this canoe up the bank, and take these geese to the kitchen.\"  Two of the men instantly hastened to obey, and Stanley, with the gun and paddles under his arm, proceeded towards the gateway of the fort.  As he passed the group assembled on the wharf, he turned and said--  \"You'll come to the hall in an hour, lads; I shall expect you to be ready with an answer by that time.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" replied several of the men.  \"But we won't go for all your expectations,\" said one in an undertone to a comrade.  \"I should think not,\" whispered another.  \"I'll be hanged, and burnt, and frozen if _I_ do,\" said a third.  In the meantime Mr Stanley walked briskly towards his dwelling, and left the men to grumble over their troubles and continue their debate as to whether they should or should not agree to go on the pending expedition to the distant regions of Ungava.    CHAPTER THREE.  SHOWS HOW STANLEY DEIGNED TO CONSULT WITH WOMANKIND--THE OPINIONS OF A CHILD DEVELOPED--PERSUASION FAILS--EXAMPLE TRIUMPHS--THE FIRST VOLUNTEERS TO UNGAVA.  On reaching his apartment, which was in an angle of the principal edifice in the fort, Mr Stanley flung down his gun and paddles, and drawing a chair close to his wife, who was working with her needle near a window, took her hand in his and heaved a deep sigh.  \"Why, George, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship.\"  \"True, Jessie,\" he replied, patting her shoulder with a hand that rough service had rendered hard and long exposure had burnt brown.  \"But the producing cause then was different from what it is now.  _Then_ it was love; _now_ it is perplexity.\"  Stanley's wife was the daughter of English parents, who had settled many years ago in the fur countries.  Being quite beyond the reach of any school, they had been obliged to undertake the instruction of their only child, Jessie, as they best could.  At first this was an easy matter, but as years flew by, and little Jessie's mind expanded, it was found to be a difficult matter to carry on her education in a country in most parts of which books were not to be had and schoolmasters did not exist. When the difficulty first presented itself, they talked of sending their little one to England to finish her education; but being unable to bring themselves to part with her, they resolved to have a choice selection of books sent out to them.  Jessie's mother was a clever, accomplished, and lady-like woman, and decidedly pious, so that the little flower, which was indeed born to blush unseen, grew up to be a gentle, affectionate woman--one who was a lady in all her thoughts and actions, yet had never seen polite society, save that of her father and mother.  In process of time Jessie became Mrs Stanley, and the mother of a little girl whose voice was, at the time her father entered, ringing cheerfully in an adjoining room.  Mrs Stanley's nature was an earnest one, and she no sooner observed that her husband was worried about something, than she instantly dropped the light tone in which she at first addressed him.  \"And what perplexes you now, dear George?\" she said, laying down her work and looking up in his face with that straightforward, earnest gaze that in days of yore had set the stout backwoodsman's heart on fire, and still kept it in a perennial blaze.  \"Nothing very serious,\" he replied with a smile; \"only these fellows have taken it into their stupid heads that Ungava is worse than the land beyond the Styx; and so, after the tough battle that I had with you this morning in order to prevail on you to remain here for a winter without me, I've had to fight another battle with them in order to get them to go on this expedition.\"  \"Have you been victorious?\" inquired Mrs Stanley.  \"No, not yet.\"  \"Do you really mean to say they are _afraid_ to go?  Has Prince refused? are Francois, Gaspard, and Massan cowards?\" she inquired, her eye kindling with indignation.  \"Nay, my wife, not so.  These men are not cowards; nevertheless they don't feel inclined to go; and as for Dick Prince, he has been off hunting for a week, and I don't expect him back for three weeks at least, by which time we shall be off.\"  Mrs Stanley sighed, as if she felt the utter helplessness of woman in such affairs.  \"Why, Jessie, that's what you used to say to me when you were at a loss for words in the days of our courtship,\" said Stanley, smiling.  \"Ah, George, like you I may say that the cause is now perplexity; for what can _I_ do to help you in your present difficulty?\"  \"Truly not much.  But I like to tell you of my troubles, and to make more of them than they deserve, for the sake of drawing forth your sympathy.  Bless your heart!\" he said, in a sudden burst of enthusiasm, \"I would gladly undergo any amount of trouble every day, if by so doing I should secure that earnest, loving, anxious gaze of your sweet blue eyes as a reward!\"  Stanley imprinted a hearty kiss on his wife's cheek as he made this lover-like speech, and then rose to place his fowling-piece on the pegs from which it usually hung over the fireplace.  At that moment the door opened, and a little girl, with bright eyes and flaxen hair, bounded into the room.  \"O mamma, mamma!\" she said, holding up a sheet of paper, while a look of intense satisfaction beamed on her animated countenance, \"see, I have drawn Chimo's portrait.  Is it like, mamma?  Do you think it like?\"  \"Come here, Eda, my darling, come to me,\" said Stanley, seating himself on a chair and extending his arms.  Edith instantly left the portrait of the dog "]]]
