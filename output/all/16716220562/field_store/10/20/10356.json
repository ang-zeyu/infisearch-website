It happened, however, that the last of these remittances had been lost, so that Mrs Brand had to depend for subsistence on Minnie's exertions, and on her brother's liberality.  The brother's power was limited, however, and Minnie had been ailing for some time past, in consequence of her close application to work, so that she could not earn as much as usual.  Hence it fell out that at this particular time the widow found herself in greater pecuniary difficulties than she had ever been in before.  Ruby was somewhat of an original.  It is probable that every hero is. He resolved to surprise his mother by pouring the money he had brought into her lap, and for this purpose had, while in Hull, converted all his savings into copper, silver, and gold.  Those precious metals he stowed separately into the pockets of his huge pea-jacket, and, thus heavily laden, went ashore about dark, as soon as the skipper returned.  At this precise hour it happened that Mrs Brand, Minnie Gray, and Captain Ogilvy were seated at their supper in the kitchen of the cottage.  Two days previously the captain had called, and said to Mrs Brand--  \"I tell 'ee what it is, sister, I'm tired of livin' a solitary bachelor life, all by myself, so I'm goin' to make a change, lass.\"  Mrs Brand was for some moments speechless, and Minnie, who was sewing near the window, dropped her hands and work on her lap, and looked up with inexpressible amazement in her sweet blue eyes.  \"Brother,\" said Mrs Brand earnestly, \"you don't mean to tell me that you're going to marry at _your_ time of life?\"  \"Eh! what?  Marry?\"  The captain looked, if possible, more amazed than his sister for a second or two, then his red face relaxed into a broad grin, and he sat down on a chair and chuckled, wiping the perspiration (he seemed always more or less in a state of perspiration) from his bald head the while.  \"Why, no, sister, I'm not going to marry; did I speak of marryin'?\"  \"No; but you spoke of being tired of a bachelor life, and wishing to change.\"  \"Ah! you women,\" said the captain, shaking his head--\"always suspecting that we poor men are wantin' to marry you.  Well, pr'aps you ain't far wrong neither; but I'm not goin' to be spliced yet-a-while, lass. Marry, indeed!    \"`Shall I, wastin' in despair,   Die, 'cause why? a woman's rare?'\"  \"Oh!  Captain Ogilvy, that's not rightly quoted,\" cried Minnie, with a merry laugh.  \"Ain't it?\" said the captain, somewhat put out; for he did not like to have his powers of memory doubted.  \"No; surely women are not _rare_,\" said Minnie.  \"Good ones are,\" said the captain stoutly.  \"Well; but that's not the right word.\"  \"What _is_ the right word, then?\" asked the captain with affected sternness, for, although by nature disinclined to admit that he could be wrong, he had no objection to be put right by Minnie.  \"Die because a woman's f---,\" said Minnie, prompting him.  \"F---, `funny?'\" guessed the captain.  \"No; it's not `funny,'\" cried Minnie, laughing heartily.  \"Of course not,\" assented the captain, \"it could not be `funny' nohow, because `funny' don't rhyme with `despair;' besides, lots o' women ain't funny a bit, an' if they was, that's no reason why a man should die for 'em; what _is_ the word, lass?\"  \"What am _I_?\" asked Minnie, with an arch smile, as she passed her fingers through the clustering masses of her beautiful hair.  \"An angel, beyond all doubt,\" said the gallant captain, with a burst of sincerity which caused Minnie to blush and then to laugh.  \"You're incorrigible, captain, and you are so stupid that it's of no use trying to teach you.\"  Mrs Brand--who listened to this conversation with an expression of deep anxiety on her meek face, for she could not get rid of her first idea that her brother was going to marry--here broke in with the question--  \"When is it to be, brother?\"  \"When is what to be, sister?\"  \"The--the marriage.\"  \"I tell you I _ain't_ a-goin' to marry,\" repeated the captain; \"though why a stout young feller like me, just turned sixty-four, _shouldn't_ marry, is more than I can see.  You know the old proverbs, lass--`It's never too late to marry;' `Never ventur', never give in;' `John Anderson my jo John, when we was first--first--'\"  \"Married,\" suggested Minnie.  \"Just so,\" responded the captain, \"and everybody knows that _he_ was an old man.  But no, I'm not goin' to marry; I'm only goin' to give up my house, sell off the furniture, and come and live with _you_.\"  \"Live with me!\" ejaculated Mrs Brand.  \"Ay, an' why not?  What's the use o' goin' to the expense of two houses when one'll do, an' when we're both raither scrimp o' the ready?  You'll just let me have the parlour.  It never was a comf'rable room to sit in, so it don't matter much your givin' it up; it's a good enough sleepin' and smokin' cabin, an' we'll all live together in the kitchen.  I'll throw the whole of my treemendous income into the general purse, always exceptin' a few odd coppers, which I'll retain to keep me a-goin' in baccy.  We'll sail under the same flag, an' sit round the same fire, an' sup at the same table, and sleep in the same--no, not exactly that, but under the same roof-tree, which'll be a more hoconomical way o' doin' business, you know; an' so, old girl, as the song says--    \"`Come an' let us be happy together,   For where there's a will there's a way,   An' we won't care a rap for the weather   So long as there's nothin' to pay.'\"  \"Would it not be better to say, `so long as there's _something_ to pay?'\" suggested Minnie.  \"No, lass, it _wouldn't_,\" retorted the captain.  \"You're too fond of improvin' things.  I'm a stanch old Tory, I am.  I'll stick to the old flag till all's blue.  None o' your changes or improvements for me.\"  This was a rather bold statement for a man to make who improved upon almost every line he ever quoted; but the reader is no doubt acquainted with parallel instances of inconsistency in good men even in the present day.  \"Now, sister,\" continued Captain Ogilvy, \"what d'ye think of my plan?\"  \"I like it well, brother,\" replied Mrs Brand with a gentle smile. \"Will you come soon?\"  \"To-morrow, about eight bells,\" answered the captain promptly.  This was all that was said on the subject.  The thing was, as the captain said, settled off-hand, and accordingly next morning he conveyed such of his worldly goods as he meant to retain possession of to his sister's cottage--\"the new ship\", as he styled it.  He carried his traps on his own broad shoulders, and the conveyance of them cost him three distinct trips.  They consisted of a huge sea-chest, an old telescope more than a yard long, and cased in leather; a quadrant, a hammock, with the bedding rolled up in it, a tobacco-box, the enormous old Family Bible in which the names of his father, mother, brothers, and sisters were recorded; and a brown teapot with half a lid.  This latter had belonged to the captain's mother, and, being fond of it, as it reminded him of the \"old ooman\", he was wont to mix his grog in it, and drink the same out of a teacup, the handle of which was gone, and the saucer of which was among the things of the past.  Notwithstanding his avowed adherence to Tory principles, Captain Ogilvy proceeded to make manifold radical changes and surprising improvements in the little parlour, insomuch that when he had completed the task, and led his sister carefully (for she was very feeble) to look at what he had done, she became quite incapable of expressing herself in ordinary language; positively refused to believe her eyes, and never again entered that room, but always spoke of what she had seen as a curious dream!  No one was ever able to discover whether there was not a slight tinge of underlying jocularity in this remark of Mrs Brand, for she was a strange and incomprehensible mixture of shrewdness and innocence; but no one took much trouble to find out, for she was so lovable that people accepted her just as she was, contented to let any small amount of mystery that seemed to be in her to remain unquestioned.  \"The parlour\" was one of those well-known rooms which are occasionally met with in country cottages, the inmates of which are not wealthy.  It was reserved exclusively for the purpose of receiving visitors.  The furniture, though old, threadbare, and dilapidated, was kept scrupulously clean, and arranged symmetrically.  There were a few books on the table, which were always placed with mathematical exactitude, and a set of chairs, so placed as to give one mysteriously the impression that they were not meant to be sat upon.  There was also a grate, which never had a fire in it, and was never without a paper ornament in it, the pink and white aspect of which caused one involuntarily to shudder.  But the great point, which was meant to afford the highest gratification to the beholder, was the chimney-piece.  This spot was crowded to excess in every square inch of its area with ornaments, chiefly of earthenware, miscalled china, and shells.  There were great white shells with pink interiors, and small brown shells with spotted backs.  Then there were china cups and saucers, and china shepherds and shepherdesses, represented in the act of contemplating the heavens serenely, with their arms round each other's waists.  There were also china dogs and cats, and a huge china cockatoo as a centre-piece; but there was not a single spot the size of a sixpence on which the captain could place his pipe or his tobacco-box!  \"We'll get these things cleared away,\" said Minnie, with a laugh, on observing the perplexed look with which the captain surveyed the chimney-piece, while the changes above referred to were being made in the parlour; \"we have no place ready to receive them just now, but I'll have them all put away to-morrow.\"  \"Thank'ee, lass,\" said the captain, as he set down the sea-chest and seated himself thereon; \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21746"],["title","The Lighthouse (#7)"],["body","they're pretty enough to look at, d'ye see, but they're raither in the way just now, as my second mate once said of the rocks when we were cruising off the coast of Norway in search of a pilot.\"  The ornaments were, however, removed sooner than anyone had anticipated. The next trip that the captain made was for his hammock (he always slept in one), which was a long unwieldy bundle, like a gigantic bolster.  He carried it into the parlour on his shoulder, and Minnie followed him.  \"Where shall I sling it, lass?\"  \"Here, perhaps,\" said Minnie.  The captain wheeled round as she spoke, and the end of the hammock swept the mantelpiece of all its ornaments, as completely as if the besom of destruction had passed over it.  \"Shiver my timbers!\" gasped the captain, awestruck by the hideous crash that followed.  \"You've shivered the ornaments at any rate,\" said Minnie, half-laughing and half-crying.  \"So I have, but no matter.  Never say die so long's there a shot in the locker.  There's as good fish in the sea as ever come out of it; so bear a hand, my girl, and help me to sling up the hammock.\"  The hammock was slung, the pipe of peace was smoked, and thus Captain Ogilvy was fairly installed in his sister's cottage.  It may, perhaps, be necessary to remind the reader that all this is a long digression; that the events just narrated occurred a few days before the return of Ruby, and that they have been recorded here in order to explain clearly the reason of the captain's appearance at the supper table of his sister, and the position which he occupied in the family.  When Ruby reached the gate of the small garden, Minnie had gone to the captain's room to see that it was properly prepared for his reception, and the captain himself was smoking his pipe close to the chimney, so that the smoke should ascend it.  The first glance through the window assured the youth that his mother was, as letters had represented her, much better in health than she used to be.  She looked so quiet and peaceful, and so fragile withal, that Ruby did not dare to \"surprise her\" by a sudden entrance, as he had originally intended, so he tapped gently at the window, and drew back.  The captain laid down his pipe and went to the door.  \"What, Ruby!\" he exclaimed, in a hoarse whisper.  \"Hush, uncle!  How is Minnie; where is she?\"  \"I think, lad,\" replied the captain in a tone of reproof, \"that you might have enquired for your mother first.\"  \"No need,\" said Ruby, pointing to the window; \"I _see_ that she is there and well, thanks be to God for that:--but Minnie?\"  \"She's well, too, boy, and in the house.  But come, get inside.  I'll explain, after.\"  This promise to \"explain\" was given in consequence of the great anxiety he, the captain, displayed to drag Ruby into the cottage.  The youth did not require much pressing, however.  He no sooner heard that Minnie was well, than he sprang in, and was quickly at his mother's feet.  Almost as quickly a fair vision appeared in the doorway of the inner room, and was clasped in the young sailor's arms with the most thorough disregard of appearances, not to mention propriety.  While this scene was enacting, the worthy captain was engaged in active proceedings, which at once amused and astonished his nephew, and the nature and cause of which shall be revealed in the next chapter.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  RUBY IN DIFFICULTIES.  Having thrust his nephew into the cottage, Captain Ogilvy's first proceeding was to close the outer shutter of the window and fasten it securely on the inside.  Then he locked, bolted, barred, and chained the outer door, after which he shut the kitchen door, and, in default of any other mode of securing it, placed against it a heavy table as a barricade.  Having thus secured the premises in front, he proceeded to fortify the rear, and, when this was accomplished to his satisfaction, he returned to the kitchen, sat down opposite the widow, and wiped his shining pate.  \"Why, uncle, are we going to stand out a siege that you take so much pains to lock up?\"  Ruby sat down on the floor at his mother's feet as he spoke, and Minnie sat down on a low stool beside him.  \"Maybe we are, lad,\" replied the captain; \"anyhow, it's always well to be ready--    \"`Ready, boys, ready,   We'll fight and we'll conquer again and again.'\"  \"Come uncle, explain yourself.\"  \"Explain myself, nephy?  I can neither explain myself nor anybody else. D'ye know, Ruby, that you're a burglar?\"  \"Am I, uncle?  Well, I confess that that's news.\"  \"Ay, but it's true though, at least the law in Arbroath says so, and if it catches you, it'll hang you as sure as a gun.\"  Here Captain Ogilvy explained to his nephew the nature of the crime that was committed on the night of his departure, the evidence of his guilt in the finding part of the plate in the garden, coupled with his sudden disappearance, and wound up by saying that he regarded him, Ruby, as being in a \"reg'lar fix.\"  \"But surely,\" said Ruby, whose face became gradually graver as the case was unfolded to him, \"surely it must be easy to prove to the satisfaction of everyone that I had nothing whatever to do with this affair?\"  \"Easy to prove it!\" said the captain in an excited tone; \"wasn't you seen, just about the hour of the robbery, going stealthily down the street, by Big Swankie and Davy Spink, both of whom will swear to it.\"  \"Yes, but _you_ were with me, uncle.\"  \"So I was, and hard enough work I had to convince them that I had nothin' to do with it myself, but they saw that I couldn't jump a stone wall eight foot high to save my life, much less break into a house, and they got no further evidence to convict me, so they let me off; but it'll go hard with you, nephy, for Major Stewart described the men, and one o' them was a big strong feller, the description bein' as like you as two peas, only their faces was blackened, and the lantern threw the light all one way, so he didn't see them well.  Then, the things found in our garden,--and the villains will haul me up as a witness against you, for, didn't I find them myself?\"  \"Very perplexing; what shall I do?\" said Ruby.  \"Clear out,\" cried the captain emphatically.  \"What! fly like a real criminal, just as I have returned home?  Never. What say _you_, Minnie?\"  \"Stand your trial, Ruby.  They cannot--they dare not--condemn the innocent.\"  \"And you, mother?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know what to say,\" replied Mrs Brand, with a look of deep anxiety, as she passed her fingers through her son's hair, and kissed his brow.  \"I have seen the innocent condemned and the guilty go free more than once in my life.\"  \"Nevertheless, mother, I will give myself up, and take my chance.  To fly would be to give them reason to believe me guilty.\"  \"Give yourself up!\" exclaimed the captain, \"you'll do nothing of the sort.  Come, lad, remember I'm an old man, and an uncle.  I've got a plan in my head, which I think will keep you out of harm's way for a time.  You see my old chronometer is but a poor one,--the worse of the wear, like its master,--and I've never been able to make out the exact time that we went aboard the _Termagant_ the night you went away.  Now, can you tell me what o'clock it was?\"  \"I can.\"  \"'Xactly?\"  \"Yes, exactly, for it happened that I was a little later than I promised, and the skipper pointed to his watch, as I came up the side, and jocularly shook his head at me.  It was exactly eleven p.m.\"  \"Sure and sartin o' that?\" enquired the captain, earnestly.  \"Quite, and his watch must have been right, for the town-clock rung the hour at the same time.\"  \"Is that skipper alive?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Would he swear to that?\"  \"I think he would.\"  \"D'ye know where he is?\"  \"I do.  He's on a voyage to the West Indies, and won't be home for two months, I believe.\"  \"Humph!\" said the captain, with a disappointed look.  \"However, it can't be helped; but I see my way _now_ to get you out o' this fix.  You know, I suppose, that they're buildin' a lighthouse on the Bell Rock just now; well, the workmen go off to it for a month at a time, I believe, if not longer, and don't come ashore, and it's such a dangerous place, and troublesome to get to, that nobody almost ever goes out to it from this place, except those who have to do with it.  Now, lad, you'll go down to the workyard the first thing in the mornin', before daylight, and engage to go off to work at the Bell Rock.  You'll keep all snug and quiet, and nobody'll be a bit the wiser.  You'll be earnin' good wages, and in the meantime I'll set about gettin' things in trim to put you all square.\"  \"But I see many difficulties ahead,\" objected Ruby.  \"Of course ye do,\" retorted the captain.  \"Did ye ever hear or see anything on this earth that hadn't rocks ahead o' some sort?  It's our business to steer past 'em, lad, not to 'bout ship and steer away.  But state yer difficulties.\"  \"Well, in the first place, I'm not a stonemason or a carpenter, and I suppose masons and carpenters are the men most wanted there.\"  \"Not at all, blacksmiths are wanted there,\" said the captain, \"and I know that you were trained to that work as a boy.\"  \"True, I can do somewhat with the hammer, but mayhap they won't engage me.\"  \"But they _will_ engage you, lad, for they are hard up for an assistant blacksmith just now, and I happen to be hand-and-glove with some o' the chief men of the yard, who'll be happy to take anyone recommended by me.\"  \"Well, uncle, but suppose I do go off to the rock, what chance have you of making things appear better than they are at present?\"  \"I'll explain that, lad.  In the first place, Major Stewart is a gentleman, out-and-out, and will listen to the truth.  He swears that the robbery took place at one o'clock in the mornin', for he looked at his watch and at the clock of the house, and heard it ring in the town, just as the thieves cleared off over the wall.  Now, if I can get your old skipper to take a run here on his return from the West Indies, he'll swear that you was sailin' out to "]]]
