The old man grumbled a good deal at first, but was finally so far mollified as to say less testily, while he put on his hat, \"I warrant me, young man, you are come on some wild-goose chase to this out-o'-the-way region of the land in search of the picturesque--eh?--a dauber on canvas?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied the youth, \"I profess not to wield the pencil or brush, although I admit to having made feeble efforts as an amateur. The scalpel is more to my taste, and my object in coming here is to visit a relative.  I am on my way to St. Just; but, having wandered somewhat out of my road, have been obliged to strike into bypaths, as you see.\"  \"As I _see_, young man!--yes, and as I _feel_,\" replied the old gentleman, with some remains of asperity.  \"I have already expressed regret for the mischance that has befallen you,\" said the youth in grey somewhat sternly, for his impulsive spirit fired a little at the continued ill-humour of the old gentleman. \"Perhaps you will return good for evil by pointing out the way to St. Just.  May I venture to ask this favour of you?\"  \"You may venture, and you _have_ ventured; and it is my belief, young man, that you'll venture many a thing before this world has done with you; however, as you are a stranger in these parts, and have expressed due penitence for your misdeed, though I more than half doubt your sincerity, I can do no less than point out the road to St. Just, whither I will accompany you at least part of the way; and, young sir, as you have taken pretty free liberty with _me_ this morning, may I take the liberty of asking _you_ the name of your relative in St. Just?  I am well acquainted with most of the inhabitants of that town.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied the youth.  \"The gentleman whom I am going to visit is my uncle.  His name is Donnithorne.\"  \"What!  Tom Donnithorne?\" exclaimed the old gentleman, in a tone of surprise, as he darted a keen glance from under his bushy eyebrows at his companion.  \"Hah! then from that fact I gather that you are Oliver Trembath, the young doctor whom he has been expecting the last day or two.  H'm--so old Tom Donnithorne is your uncle, is he?\"  The youth in grey did not relish the free and easy, not to say patronising, tone of his companion, and felt inclined to give a sharp answer, but he restrained his feelings and replied,--\"He is, and you are correct in your supposition regarding myself.  Do you happen to know my uncle personally?\"  \"Know him personally!\" cried the old gentleman with a sardonic laugh; \"Oh yes, I know him intimately--intimately; some people say he's a very good fellow.\"  \"I am glad to hear that, for to say truth--\"  He paused abruptly.  \"Ha!  I suppose you were going to say that you have heard a different account of him--eh?\"  \"Well, I _was_ going to observe,\" replied Oliver, with a laugh, \"that my uncle is rather a wild man for his years--addicted to smuggling, I am told, and somewhat given to the bottle; but it is well known that tattlers give false reports, and I am delighted to hear that the old boy is not such a bad fellow after all.\"  \"Humph!\" ejaculated the other.  \"Then you have never seen him, I suppose?\"  \"No, never; although I am a Cornishman I have seen little of my native county, having left it when a little boy--before my uncle came to live in this part of the country.\"  \"H'm--well, young man, I would advise you to beware of that same uncle of yours.\"  \"How!\" exclaimed the youth in surprise; \"did you not tell me just now that he is a very good fellow?\"  \"No, sir, I did not.  I told you that _some_ people say he is a very good fellow, but for myself I think him an uncommonly bad man, a man who has done me great injury in his day--\"  \"It grieves me to hear you say so,\" interrupted Oliver, whose ire was again roused by the tone and manner of his companion.  \"A decidedly bad man,\" continued the old gentleman, not noticing the interruption, \"a thorough rascal, a smuggler, and a drunkard, and--\"  \"Hold, sir!\" cried the youth sternly, as he stopped and faced the old gentleman, \"remember that you speak of my relative.  Had you been a younger man, sir--\"  Again the youth paused abruptly.  \"Go on, sir,\" said the old gentleman ironically, \"you would have pommelled me to a jelly with your cudgel, I suppose; is that it?--acting somewhat in the spirit of your kinsman, that same smuggling and tippling old scoundrel, who--\"  \"Enough, sir,\" interrupted the young man angrily; \"we part company here.\"  So saying, he vaulted over the wall that separated the road from the moor, and hurried away.  \"Take the first turn to the left, and keep straight on, else you'll lose yourself aga-a-a-in,\" roared the old gentleman, \"and my compliments to the rascally old smugg-le-e-r-r!\"  \"The old scoundrel!\" muttered the youth as he hurried away.  \"The young puppy!\" growled the old gentleman as he jogged along.  \"Given to smuggling and the bottle indeed--humph! the excitable jackanapes! But I've given him a turn in the wrong direction that will cool his blood somewhat, and give me leisure to cool mine too, before we meet again.\"  Here the old gentleman's red countenance relaxed into a broad grin, and he chuckled a good deal, in the midst of a running commentary on the conduct and appearance of his late companion, from the disjointed sentences of which it might have been gathered that although his introduction to the young doctor had been unfortunate, and the succeeding intercourse stormy, his opinion of him was not altogether unfavourable.    CHAPTER TWO.  SHOWS WHAT ASTONISHING RESULTS MAY FOLLOW FROM TAKING THE WRONG ROAD.  Before Oliver Trembath had advanced half a mile on his path, he had cooled sufficiently to experience some regret at having been so quick to take offence at one who, being evidently an eccentric character, should not, he thought, have been broken with so summarily.  Regrets, however, had come too late, so he endeavoured to shake off the disagreeable feelings that depressed him, and, the more effectually to accomplish this, burst forth into a bravura song with so much emphasis as utterly to drown, and no doubt to confound, two larks, which, up to that time, had been pouring their melodious souls out of their little bodies in the bright blue sky above.  Presently he came to a part of the moor where two roads diverged--one to the right and the other to the left.  Recalling the shout of advice which the old gentleman had given him in parting, he took that which led to the left, and was gratified, on gaining an eminence a short distance in advance, to see in the far distance a square turret, which he concluded was that of the church of St. Just.  Keeping this turret in view, the youth stepped out so vigorously that he soon reached the small town that clustered round the church, and going up to the first man he met, said, \"This is the town of St. Just, I suppose, is it not?\"  \"No, et is'n; thee's come the wrang road, sur,\" replied the rustic. \"This es Sennen church-town.  St. Just es up over th' hill theere.\"  Oliver Trembath's first feeling was one of surprise; this was followed by annoyance, which quickly degenerated into anger as it flashed into his mind that the old gentleman might possibly have led him wrong on purpose.  \"How far is it to St. Just?\" he inquired.  \"'Bout six miles, sur.\"  \"Then I suppose I am not far from the Land's End?\" said Oliver after a pause.  \"No, not fur,\" replied the man.  \"Et do lie straight before 'ee.\"  Thanking the man, Oliver started off at a smart pace, resolving, before proceeding to St. Just, to visit this extreme western point of England-- a visit to which he had often looked forward with pleasant anticipation.  During the last hour of his walk the sun had been obscured by clouds, but, just as he approached the cliffs, the clouds separated, and a golden flood rushed over the broad Atlantic, which now lay spread out before him in all its wide majesty as far as the eye could see.  \"A good omen!\" cried the youth with a shout, as he hurried towards the shore, intending to fling off his garments and bathe in the mighty ocean, which, from the place where he first beheld it, appeared to be smooth and still as a mill-pond.  But Oliver was compelled to restrain his ardour, for on nearing the sea he found that he stood on the summit of high cliffs, beyond which the Land's End stretched in a succession of broken masses of granite, so chafed and shattered by the action of the sea, and so curiously split, as to resemble basaltic columns.  To reach the outermost of those weather-worn sentinels of Old England, required some caution on the part of our traveller, even although well used to scaling the rocky heights of Scottish mountains, and when he did at last plant his foot on the veritable Land's End, he found that it was a precipice apparently sixty feet high, which descended perpendicularly into deep water.  His meditated bathe was therefore an impossibility, for those glassy undulations, which appeared so harmless at a distance, gathered slow and gradual height as they approached the land, and at last, assuming the form of majestic waves, flung themselves with a grand roar on the stern cliffs which they have battered so long in vain, and round which--always repulsed but never conquered--they seethed in milky foam.  With glistening eye, and heaving breast, and mantling colour, the young doctor stood long and motionless on this extreme point of land--absorbed in admiration of the glorious scene before him.  Often had he beheld the sea in the firths and estuaries of the North, but never till now had he conceived the grandeur of the great Atlantic.  It seemed to him as if the waves of those inland seas, when tossed by wild storms, were but rough miniature copies of the huge billows which arose before him, without apparent cause, and, advancing without rush or agitation, fell successively with solemn roar at his feet, awakening irresistibly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21726"],["title","Deep Down, a Tale of the Cornish Mines (#2)"],["body"," him deep and new thoughts of the Almighty Creator of earth and sea.  For many minutes he stood entranced, his mind wandering in a species of calm delight over the grand scene, but incapable of fixing itself definitely on any special feature--now sweeping out to where the Scilly Isles could be seen resting on the liquid horizon, anon following the flight of circling seagulls, or busy counting the innumerable ships and boats that rested on the sea, but ever and anon recurring, as if under the influence of fascination, to that rich turmoil of foam which boiled, leaped, and churned, around, beneath, and above the mighty breakers.  Awaking at last from his trance, Oliver tore himself from the spot, and hastened away to seek the nearest strip of sand where he might throw off his clothes and plunge into the boiling surf.  He proceeded in a southerly direction, impatiently expecting at every step to discover some spot suitable for his purpose, but he had taken a long and rapid walk before he found a break in those wild cliffs which afforded him the opportunity of descending to the water's edge.  Here, on a narrow strip of sand, he undressed and leaped into the waves.  Well was it for Oliver that day that he had been trained in all manly exercises, that his \"wind\" was good, that his muscles were hard, his nerves well strung, and, above all, that in earliest youth he had learned to swim.  Misjudging, in his ignorance, the tremendous power of the surf into which he sprang, and daring to recklessness in the conscious possession of unusual strength and courage, he did not pause to look or consider, but at once struck out to sea.  He was soon beyond the influence of the breaking waves, and for some time sported in the full enjoyment of the briny Atlantic waters.  Then turning towards the shore he swam in and was speedily tossing among the breakers.  As he neared the sandy beach and felt the full power of the water on his partially exhausted frame, he experienced a slight feeling of anxiety, for the thunder of each wave as it fell and rushed up before him in seething foam, seemed to indicate a degree of force which he had not realised in his first vigorous plunge into the sea.  A moment more and a wave caught him in its curling crest, and swept him onwards.  For the first time in his life, Oliver Trembath's massive strength was of no avail to him.  He felt like a helpless infant.  In another instant the breaker fell and swept him with irresistible violence up the beach amid a turmoil of hissing foam.  No sooner did he touch the ground than he sprang to his feet, and staggered forward a few paces but the returning rush of water swept sand and stones from beneath his feet, carried his legs from under him, and hurled him back into the hollow of the succeeding wave, which again rolled him on the sand.  Although somewhat stunned, Oliver did not lose consciousness or self-possession.  He now fully realised the extreme danger of his position, and the thought flashed through his brain that, at the farthest, his fate must be decided in two or three minutes.  Acting on a brave spirit, this thought nerved him to desperate effort.  The instant he could plant his feet firmly he bounded forwards, and then, before the backward rush of water had gathered strength, fell on his knees, and dug his fingers and toes deep into the sand.  Had the grasp been on something firm he could easily have held on, but the treacherous sand crumbled out of his grasp, and a second time he was carried back into the sea.  The next time he was cast on the beach he felt that his strength was failing; he staggered forward as soon as he touched bottom, with all the energy of one who avails himself of his last chance, but the angry water was too strong for him.  Feeling that he was being overpowered, he cast his arms up in the air, and gave utterance to a loud cry.  It was not like a cry of despair, but sounded more like what one might suppose would be the shout of a brave soldier when compelled to give way-- fighting--before the might of overwhelming force.  At that moment a hand caught the young man's wrist, and held it for a few seconds in a powerful grasp.  The wave retreated, a staggering effort followed, and the next moment Oliver stood panting on the beach grasping the rough hand of his deliverer.  \"Semen to me you was pretty nigh gone, sur,\" said the man, who had come thus opportunely to the rescue, as he wrung the sea-water from his garments.  He was a man of middle height, but of extremely powerful frame, and was habited in the garb of a fisherman.  \"Truly I had been gone altogether but for your timely assistance; may God reward you for it!\" said Oliver earnestly.  \"Well, I don't think you would be so ready to thank me if you did knaw I had half made up my mind to lev 'ee go.\"  Oliver looked at the man in some surprise, for he spoke gruffly, almost angrily, and was evidently in earnest.  \"You are jesting,\" said he incredulously.  \"Jestin'; no I ain't, maister.  Do 'ee see the boat out over?\" he said, pointing to a small craft full of men which was being rowed swiftly round a point not more than half a mile distant; \"the villains are after me.  They might as well have tried to kitch a cunger by the tail as nab Jim Cuttance in one of his dens, if he hadn't bin forced by the softness of his 'art to pull a young fool out o' the say.  You'll have to help me to fight, lad, as I've saved your life.  Come, follow me to the cave.\"  \"But--my clothes--\" said Oliver, glancing round him in search of his garments.  \"They're all safe up here; come along, sur, an' look sharp.\"  At any other time, and in other circumstances, Oliver Trembath's fiery spirit would have resented the tone and manner of this man's address, but the feeling that he owed his life to him, and that in some way he appeared to be the innocent cause of bringing misfortune on him, induced him to restrain his feelings and obey without question the mandate of his rescuer.  Jim Cuttance led the way to a cave in the rugged cliffs, the low entrance to which was concealed by a huge mass of granite.  The moment they entered several voices burst forth in abuse of the fisherman for his folly in exposing himself; but the latter only replied with a sarcastic laugh, and advised his comrades to get ready for action, for he had been seen by the enemy, who would be down on them directly.  At the same time he pointed to Oliver's clothes, which lay in a recess in the side of the cavern.  The youth dressed himself rapidly, and, while thus engaged, observed that there were five men in the cavern, besides his guide, with whom they retired into the farthest recess of the place, and entered into animated and apparently angry, though low-toned, conversation.  At length their leader, for such he evidently was, swung away from them, exclaiming, with a laugh, \"Well, well, he's a good recruit, and if he should peach on we--us can--\"  He concluded the sentence with a significant grunt.  \"Now, sur,\" he said, advancing with his comrade towards Oliver, who was completing his toilet, \"they'll be here in ten minutes, an' it is expected that you will lend we a hand.  Here's a weapon for you.\"  So saying, he handed a large pistol to Oliver, who received it with some hesitation.  \"I trust that your cause is a good one,\" he said.  \"You cannot expect me to fight for you, even though I am indebted to you for my life, without knowing against whom I fight, and why.\"  At this a tall thick-set man suddenly cocked his pistol, and uttering a fierce oath swore that if the stranger would not fight, he'd shoot him through the head.  \"Silence, Joe Tonkin!\" cried Jim Cuttance, in a tone that at once subdued the man.  Oliver, whose eyes had flashed like those of a tiger, drew himself up, and said--\"Look at me, lads; I have no desire to boast of what I can or will do, but I assure you it would be as easy to turn back the rising tide as to force me to fight against my will--except, indeed, with yourselves.  As I have said, I owe my life to your leader, and apparently have been the innocent means of drawing his enemies upon him. Gratitude tells me to help him if I can, and help him will if the cause be not a bad one.\"  \"Well spoken, sur,\" said the leader, with an approving nod; \"see to the weapons, Maggot, and I'll explain it all to the gentleman.\"  So saying, he too Oliver aside, told him hurriedly that the men who ere expected to attack them were fishermen belonging to a neighbouring cove, whose mackerel nets had been accidentally cut by his boat some weeks ago, and who were bent on revenge, not believing that the thing had been done by accident.  \"But surely you don't mean to use fire-arms against them in such a quarrel?\" said Oliver.  A sort of humorous smile crossed the swarthy countenance of the man as he replied--  \"They will use pistols against we.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" said Oliver; \"I will never consent to risk taking the life of a countryman in such a cause.\"  \"But you can't fight without a weapon,\" said the man; \"and sure, if 'ee don't shut them they'll shut you.\"  \"No matter, I'll take my chance,\" said Oliver; \"my good cudgel would have served me well enough, but it seems to have been swept away by the sea.  Here, however, is a weapon that will suit me admirably,\" he added, picking up a heavy piece of driftwood that lay at his feet.  \"Well, if you scat their heads with that, they won't want powder and lead,\" observed the other with a grin, as he rose and returned to the entrance of the cave, where he warned his comrades to keep as quiet as mice.  The boat which had caused so much angry discussion among the men of the cave had by this time neared the beach, and one of the crew stood up in the bow to guide her into the narrow cove, which formed but a slight protection, even in calm weather, against the violence of that surf which never ceases to grind at the hard rocks of West Cornwall.  At length they effected a landing, and the crew,"]]]
