The neck of ice through which they had broken had acted as a check on the pressure of the great body of the floe, and it was no sooner removed than the heavy mass began to close in with slow but irresistible power, compelling the little vessel to steam close up to the iceberg--so close that some of the upper parts actually overhung the deck.  They were slowly forced into this dangerous position.  With breathless anxiety the Captain and crew watched the apparently gentle, but really tremendous grinding of the ice against the vessel's side.  Even the youngest on board could realise the danger.  No one moved, for nothing whatever could be done.  \"Everything depends, under God, on the ice easing off before we are crushed,\" said the Captain.  As he spoke, the timbers of the yacht seemed to groan under the pressure; then there was a succession of loud cracks, and the vessel was thrust bodily up the sloping sides of the berg.  While in this position, with the bow high and dry, a mass of ice was forced against the stern-post, and the screw-propeller was snapped off as if it had been made of glass.  Poor Captain Vane's heart sank as if he had received his death-blow, for he knew that the yacht was now, even in the event of escaping, reduced to an ordinary vessel dependent on its sails.  The shock seemed to have shaken the berg itself, for at that moment a crashing sound was heard overhead.  The terror-stricken crew looked up, and for one moment a pinnacle like a church spire was seen to flash through the air right above them.  It fell with an indescribable roar close alongside, deluging the decks with water.  There was a momentary sigh of relief, which, however, was chased away by a succession of falling masses, varying from a pound to a ton in weight, which came down on the deck like cannon-shots, breaking the topmasts, and cutting to pieces much of the rigging.  Strange to say, none of the men were seriously injured, though many received bruises more or less severe.  During this brief but thrilling period, the brothers Vandervell and Benjy Vane crouched close together beside the port bulwarks, partially screened from the falling ice by the mizzen shrouds.  The Captain stood on the quarter-deck, quite exposed, and apparently unconscious of danger, the picture of despair.  \"It can't last long,\" sighed poor Benjy, looking solemnly up at the vast mass of the bluish-white berg, which hung above them as if ready to fall.  Presently the pressure ceased, then the ice eased off, and in a few minutes the _Whitebear_ slid back into the sea, a pitiable wreck!  Now had come the time for action.  \"Out poles, my lads, and shove her off the berg!\" was the sharp order.  Every one strained as if for life at the ice-poles, and slowly forced the yacht away from the dreaded berg.  It mattered not that they were forcing her towards a rocky shore.  Any fate would be better than being crushed under a mountain of ice.  But the danger was not yet past.  No sooner had they cleared the berg, and escaped from that form of destruction, than the ice began again to close in, and this time the vessel was \"nipped\" with such severity, that some of her principal timbers gave way.  Finally, her back was broken, and the bottom forced in.  \"So,\" exclaimed the Captain, with a look of profound grief, \"our voyage in the _Whitebear_, lads, has come to an end.  All that we can do now is to get the boats and provisions, and as much of the cargo as we can, safe on the ice.  And sharp's the word, for when the floes ease off, the poor little yacht will certainly go to the bottom.\"  \"No, massa,\" said the negro steward, stepping on deck at that moment, \"we can't go to de bottom, cause we's dare a-ready!\"  \"What d'ye mean, Butterface?\"  \"Jus' what me say,\" replied the steward, with a look of calm resignation.  \"I's bin b'low, an' seed de rocks stickin' troo de bottom. Der's one de size ob a jolly-boat's bow comed right troo my pantry, an' knock all de crockery to smash, an' de best teapot, he's so flat he wouldn't know hisself in a lookin'-glass.\"  It turned out to be as Butterface said.  The pack had actually thrust the little vessel on a shoal, which extended out from the headland off which the catastrophe occurred, and there was therefore no fear of her sinking.  \"Well, we've reason to be thankful for that, at all events,\" said the Captain, with an attempt to look cheerful; \"come, lads, let's to work. Whatever our future course is to be, our first business is to get the boats and cargo out of danger.\"  With tremendous energy--because action brought relief to their overstrained feelings--the crew of the ill-fated yacht set to work to haul the boats upon the grounded ice.  The tide was falling, so that a great part of the most valuable part of the cargo was placed in security before the rising tide interrupted the work.  This was fortunate, for, when the water reached a certain point the ice began to move, and the poor little vessel was so twisted about that they dared not venture on board of her.  That night--if we may call it night in a region where the sun never quite went down--the party encamped on the north-western coast of Greenland, in the lee of a huge cliff just beyond which the tongue of a mighty glacier dipped into the sea.  For convenience the party divided into two, with a blazing fire for each, round which the castaways circled, conversing in subdued, sad tones while supper was being prepared.  It was a solemn occasion, and a scene of indescribable grandeur, with the almost eternal glacier of Greenland--the great Humboldt glacier-- shedding its bergs into the dark blue sea, the waters of which had by that time been partially cleared to the northward.  On the left was the weird pack and its thousand grotesque forms, with the wreck in its iron grasp; on the right the perpendicular cliffs, and the bright sky over all, with the smoke of the campfires rising into it from the foreground.  \"Now, my friends,\" said Captain Vane to the crew when assembled after supper, \"I am no longer your commander, for my vessel is a wreck, but as I suppose you still regard me as your leader, I assemble you here for the purpose of considering our position, and deciding on what is best to be done.\"  Here the Captain said, among other things, it was his opinion that the _Whitebear_ was damaged beyond the possibility of repair, that their only chance of escape lay in the boats, and that the distance between the place on which they stood and Upernavik, although great, was not beyond the reach of resolute men.  \"Before going further, or expressing a decided opinion,\" he added, \"I would hear what the officers have to say on this subject.  Let the first mate speak.\"  \"It's my opinion,\" said the mate, \"that there's only one thing to be done, namely, to start for home as soon and as fast as we can.  We have good boats, plenty of provisions, and are all stout and healthy, excepting our doctor, whom we will take good care of, and expect to do no rough work.\"  \"Thanks, mate,\" said the doctor with a laugh, \"I think that, at all events, I shall keep well enough to physic you if you get ill.\"  \"Are you willing to take charge of the party in the event of my deciding to remain here?\" asked the Captain of the mate.  \"Certainly, sir,\" he replied, with a look of slight surprise.  \"You know I am quite able to do so.  The second mate, too, is as able as I am. For that matter, most of the men, I think, would find little difficulty in navigating a boat to Upernavik.\"  \"That is well,\" returned the Captain, \"because I do not intend to return with you.\"  \"Not return!\" exclaimed the doctor; \"surely you don't mean to winter here.\"  \"No, not here, but further north,\" replied the Captain, with a smile which most of the party returned, for they thought he was jesting.  Benjy Vane, however, did not think so.  A gleeful look of triumph caused his face, as it were, to sparkle, and he said, eagerly--  \"We'll winter at the North Pole, father, eh?\"  This was greeted with a general laugh.  \"But seriously, uncle, what do you mean to do?\" asked Leonard Vandervell, who, with his brother, was not unhopeful that the Captain meditated something desperate.  \"Benjy is not far off the mark.  I intend to winter at the Pole, or as near to it as I can manage to get.\"  \"My dear Captain Vane,\" said the doctor, with an anxious look, \"you cannot really mean what you say.  You must be jesting, or mad.\"  \"Well, as to madness,\" returned the Captain with a peculiar smile, \"you ought to know best, for it's a perquisite of your cloth to pronounce people mad or sane, though some of yourselves are as mad as the worst of us; but in regard to jesting, nothing, I assure you, is further from my mind.  Listen!\"  He rose from the box which had formed his seat, and looked earnestly round on his men.  As he stood there, erect, tall, square, powerful, with legs firmly planted, and apart, as if to guard against a lurch of his ship, with his bronzed face flushed, and his dark eye flashing, they all understood that their leader's mind was made up, and that what he had resolved upon, he would certainly attempt to carry out.  \"Listen,\" he repeated; \"it was my purpose on leaving England, as you all know, to sail north as far as the ice would let me; to winter where we should stick fast, and organise an over-ice, or overland journey to the Pole with all the appliances of recent scientific discovery, and all the advantages of knowledge acquired by former explorers.  It has pleased God to destroy my ship, but my life and my hopes are spared.  So are my stores and scientific instruments.  I intend, therefore, to carry out my original purpose.  I believe that former explorers have erred in some points of their procedure.  These errors I shall steer clear of.  Former travellers have ignored some facts, and despised some appliances.  These facts I will recognise; these appliances I will utilise.  With a steam yacht, you, my friends,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21733"],["title","The Giant of the North: Pokings Round the Pole (#7)"],["body"," who have shown so much enthusiasm and courage up to this point, would have been of the utmost service to me.  As a party in boats, or on foot, you would only hamper my movements.  I mean to prosecute this enterprise almost alone.  I shall join myself to the Eskimos.\"  He paused at this point as if in meditation.  Benjy, whose eyes and mouth had been gradually opening to their widest, almost gasped with astonishment as he glanced at his cousins, whose expressive countenances were somewhat similarly affected.  \"I have had some long talks,\" continued the Captain, \"with that big Eskimo Chingatok, through our interpreter, and from what he says I believe my chances of success are considerable.  I am all the more confirmed in this resolution because of the readiness and ability of my first mate to guide you out of the Arctic regions, and your willingness to trust him.  Anders has agreed to go with me as interpreter, and now, all I want is one other man, because--\"  \"Put me down, father,\" cried Benjy, in a burst of excitement--\"_I'm_ your man.\"  \"Hush, lad,\" said the Captain with a little smile, \"of course I shall take you with me and also your two cousins, but I want one other man to complete the party--but he must be a heartily willing man.  Who will volunteer?\"  There was silence for a few moments.  It was broken by the doctor.  \"I for one won't volunteer,\" he said, \"for I'm too much shaken by this troublesome illness to think of such an expedition.  If I were well it might be otherwise, but perhaps some of the others will offer.\"  \"You can't expect me to do so,\" said the mate, \"for I've got to guide our party home, as agreed on; besides, under any circumstances, I would not join you, for it is simple madness.  You'll forgive me, Captain.  I mean no disrespect, but I have sailed many years to these seas, and I know from experience that what you propose is beyond the power of man to accomplish.\"  \"Experience!\" repeated the Captain, quickly.  \"Has your experience extended further north than this point?\"  \"No, sir, I have not been further north than this--nobody has.  It is beyond the utmost limit yet reached, so far as I know.\"  \"Well, then, you cannot speak from _experience_ about what I propose,\" said the Captain, turning away.  \"Come, lads, I have no wish to constrain you, I merely give one of you the chance.\"  Still no one came forward.  Every man of the crew of the _Whitebear_ had had more or less personal acquaintance with arctic travel and danger. They would have followed Captain Vane anywhere in the yacht, but evidently they had no taste for what he was about to undertake.  At last one stepped to the front.  It was Butterface, the steward.  This intensely black negro was a bulky, powerful man, with a modest spirit and a strange disbelief in his own capacities, though, in truth, these were very considerable.  He came forward, stooping slightly, and rubbing his hands in a deprecating manner.  \"'Scuse me, massa Capting.  P'r'aps it bery presumsheeous in dis yer chile for to speak afore his betters, but as no oder man 'pears to want to volunteer, I's willin' to go in an' win.  Ob course I ain't a man-- on'y a nigger, but I's a willin' nigger, an' kin do a few small tings-- cook de grub, wash up de cups an' sarsers, pull a oar, clean yer boots, fight de Eskimos if you wants me to, an' ginrally to scrimmage around a'most anything.  Moreover, I eats no more dan a babby--'sep wen I's hungry--an' I'll foller you, massa, troo tick and tin--to de Nort Pole, or de Sout Pole, or de East Pole, or de West Pole--or any oder pole wotsomediver--all de same to Butterface, s'long's you'll let 'im stick by you.\"  The crew could not help giving the negro a cheer as he finished this loyal speech, and the Captain, although he would have preferred one of the other men, gladly accepted his services.  A few days later the boats were ready and provisioned; adieus were said, hats and handkerchiefs waved, and soon after Captain Vane and his son and two nephews, with Anders and Butterface, were left to fight their battles alone, on the margin of an unexplored, mysterious Polar sea.    CHAPTER FIVE.  LEFT TO THEIR FATE.  There are times, probably, in all conditions of life, when men feel a species of desolate sadness creeping over their spirits, which they find it hard to shake off or subdue.  Such a time arrived to our Arctic adventurers the night after they had parted from the crew of the wrecked _Whitebear_.  Nearly everything around, and much within, them was calculated to foster that feeling.  They were seated on the rocky point on the extremity of which their yacht had been driven.  Behind them were the deep ravines, broad valleys, black beetling cliffs, grand mountains, stupendous glaciers, and dreary desolation of Greenland.  To right and left, and in front of them, lay the chaotic ice-pack of the Arctic sea, with lanes and pools of water visible here and there like lines and spots of ink.  Icebergs innumerable rose against the sky, which at the time was entirely covered with grey and gloomy clouds.  Gusts of wind swept over the frozen waste now and then, as if a squall which had recently passed, were sighing at the thought of leaving anything undestroyed behind it.  When we add to this, that the wanderers were thinking of the comrades who had just left them--the last link, as it were, with the civilised world from which they were self-exiled, of the unknown dangers and difficulties that lay before them, and of the all but forlorn hope they had undertaken, there need be little wonder that for some time they all looked rather grave, and were disposed to silence.  But life is made up of opposites, light and shade, hard and soft, hot and cold, sweet and sour, for the purpose, no doubt, of placing man between two moral battledores so as to drive the weak and erring shuttlecock of his will right and left, and thus keep it in the middle course of rectitude.  No sooner had our adventurers sunk to the profoundest depths of gloom, than the battledore of brighter influences began to play upon them.  It did not, however, achieve the end at once.  \"I'm in the lowest, bluest, dreariest, grumpiest, and most utterly miserable state of mind I ever was in in all my life,\" said poor little Benjy Vane, thrusting his hands into his pockets, sitting down on a rock, and gazing round on the waste wilderness, which had only just ceased howling, the very personification of despair.  \"So's I, massa,\" said Butterface, looking up from a compound of wet coal and driftwood which he had been vainly trying to coax into a flame for cooking purposes; \"I's most 'orribly miserable!\"  There was a beaming grin on the negro's visage that gave the lie direct to his words.  \"That's always the way with you, Benjy,\" said the Captain, \"either bubblin' over with jollity an' mischief, or down in the deepest blues.\"  \"Blues! father,\" cried the boy, \"don't talk of blues--it's the blacks I'm in, the very blackest of blacks.\"  \"Ha! jus' like me,\" muttered Butterface, sticking out his thick lips at the unwilling fire, and giving a blow that any grampus might have envied.  The result was that a column of almost solid smoke, which had been for some time rising thicker and thicker from the coals, burst into a bright flame.  This was the first of the sweet influences before referred to.  \"Mind your wool, Flatnose,\" cried Benjy, as the negro drew quickly back.  It may be remarked here that the mysterious bond of sympathy which united the spirits of Benjy Vane and the black steward found expression in kindly respect on the part of the man, and in various eccentric courses on the part of the boy--among others, in a habit of patting him on the back, and giving him a choice selection of impromptu names, such as Black-mug, Yellow-eyes, Square-jaws, and the like.  \"What have you got in the kettle?\" asked Leo Vandervell, who came up with some dry driftwood at the moment.  \"Bubble-um-squeak,\" replied the cook.  \"What sort o' squeak is that?\" asked Leo, as he bent his tall strong frame over the fire to investigate the contents of the kettle.  \"What am it, massa?  Why, it am a bit o' salt pork, an' a bit o' dat bear you shooted troo de nose yes'rday, an' a junk o' walrus, an' two puffins, an' some injin corn, a leetil pepper, an' a leetil salt.\"  \"Good, that sounds well,\" said Leo.  \"I'll go fetch you some more driftwood, for it'll take a deal of boiling, that will, to make it eatable.\"  The driftwood referred to was merely some pieces of the yacht which had been cast ashore by the hurly-burly of ice and water that had occurred during the last tide.  No other species of driftwood was to be found on that coast, for the neighbouring region was utterly destitute of trees.  \"Where has Alf gone to?\" asked the Captain, as Leo was moving away.  \"Oh, he's looking for plants and shells, as usual,\" answered Leo, with a smile.  \"You know his heart is set upon these things.\"  \"He'll have to set his heart on helping wi' the cargo after supper,\" said the Captain, drawing a small notebook and pencil from his pocket.  A few more of the sweet and reviving influences of life now began to circle round the wanderers.  Among them was the savoury odour that arose from the pot of bubble-um-squeak, also the improved appearance of the sky.  It was night, almost midnight, nevertheless the sun was blazing in the heavens, and as the storm-clouds had rolled away like a dark curtain, his cheering rays were by that time gilding the icebergs, and rendering the land-cliffs ruddily.  The travellers had enjoyed perpetual daylight for several weeks already, and at that high latitude they could count on many more to come.  By the time supper was ready, the depressing influences were gone, and the spirits of all had recovered their wonted tone.  Indeed it was not to the discredit of the party that they were so much cast down on that occasion, for the parting, perhaps for ever, from the friends with whom they had hitherto voyaged,"]]]
