Half an hour was the time allowed to get ready, unless, any one being sick or animals having strayed, delay became necessary.  All day the flag remained up; its being lowered each evening was the signal for encamping.  Then the captains and their men arranged the order of the camp.  The carts as they arrived moved to their appointed places, side by side, with the trains outwards, and formed a circle, inside of which, at one end, the tents were pitched in double and triple rows, the horses, etcetera, being tethered at the other end. Thus they were at all times ready to resist attack from Indians.  Among other rules laid down on this occasion at starting were the following:--  No hunting to be allowed on the Sabbath day.  No party to fork off, lag behind, or go before, without permission.  No hunter or party to run buffalo before the general order, and every captain in turn to mount guard with his men and patrol the camp.  The punishments for offenders were, like themselves, rather wild and wasteful.  For a first offence against the laws, a culprit was to have his saddle and bridle cut up! For the second, his coat to be taken and cut up; and for the third he was to be flogged.  A person convicted of theft was to be brought to the middle of the camp, and have his or her name loudly proclaimed three times, with the word \"thief\" added each time.  It was the third week out from the settlement when the hunters met with Victor Ravenshaw and his friends, yet up to that day they had failed to find the buffalo, and were well-nigh starving.  The intelligence, therefore, that scouts had at length discovered game, had filled the camp with joy.  After having taken a little of the mettle out of his steed, as related in the last chapter, Victor caused him to make a wide circuit on the plain, and came up behind the line of hunters just as they topped a prairie undulation, or wave, and sighted the buffalo.  It was a grand array, the sight of which thrilled the young sportsman to the heart. Full four hundred huntsmen, mounted on fresh and restive steeds, were slowly advancing, waiting eagerly for the word to start.  Baptiste Warder, their chief, was in front with his telescope, surveying the game and the ground.  Victor pushed in between Ian and Rollin, who rode near the centre of the impatient line.  The wild cattle blackened the plain at the distance of about a mile and a half from them.  \"Surely they must have seen us by this time,\" said Victor, in a voice of suppressed agitation.  \"Have you got your powder-horn and bullets handy?\" asked Ian.  \"Yes; all right.\"  \"Put 'im in de mout, de mout,\" said Rollin quickly.  The half-breed here referred to a habit of the hunters, who carry several bullets in their mouths to facilitate loading while running at full speed.  The method is simple.  The hunter merely pours powder into his left palm, transfers it to his gun, drops a bullet from his mouth into the muzzle, hits the butt smartly on his pommel, which at once sends the charge home and forces priming into the pan, and thus is ready for another shot.  Victor, having forgotten all about this, immediately put three bullets into his mouth, his gun being already loaded.  \"Don't swallow them!\" said Ian.  \"Swallow your own advice,\" growled Victor.  \"Start!\" shouted Captain Warder.  The welcome signal sent an electric thrill along the line.  It was promptly obeyed, first at a slow trot, then at a hard gallop.  The low rumbling thunder of their tramp was in keeping with the wild eager looks of the half-savage hunters.  They had approached to within four or five hundred yards before the buffalo-bulls curved their tails into marks of interrogation and began to paw the ground.  Another moment, and the mighty herd took to flight.  Then the huntsmen let loose their eager steeds.  As squadrons of dragoons charge into the thick of battle, these wild fellows bore down with grand momentum on the buffalo bands.  The very earth seemed to tremble when they charged, but when the herd sprang away in the frenzy of terror it was as though a shock of earthquake had riven the plains.  Right into the careering mass the horsemen rushed. Shots began--here, there, and everywhere, until a rattle of musketry filled the air, while smoke, dust, shouts, and bellowing added to the wild confusion.  The fattest animals were selected, and in an incredibly short space of time a thousand of their carcasses strewed the plain.  The men who were best mounted of course darted forward in advance and secured the fattest cows.  They seldom dropped a mark to identify their property.  These hunters possess a power of distinguishing the animals they have slain during a hot and long ride, which amounts almost to an instinct--even though they may have killed from ten to twelve animals. An experienced hunter on a good horse will perform such a feat during one race.  He seldom fires till within three or four yards of his prey, and never misses.  A well-trained horse, the moment it hears the shot, springs on one side to avoid stumbling over the buffalo.  An awkward or shy horse will not approach nearer than ten or fifteen yards.  Badly mounted men think themselves well off if they secure two or three animals during one run.  As the battle continued, the very air was darkened with dust and smoke. Of course such a fight could not rage without casualties.  There were, in truth, many hairbreadth and some almost miraculous escapes, for the ground was rocky and full of badger-holes.  Twenty-three horses and riders were seen at one moment all sprawling on the ground.  One horse was gored by a bull and killed on the spot: two other horses fell over it and were disabled.  One rider broke his shoulder-blade, another burst his gun by careless loading, and lost three fingers, while another was struck on the knee by a spent ball.  The wonder was, not that so many, but that so few, were hurt, when it is considered that the riders were dashing about in clouds of dust and smoke, crossing and recrossing each other in all directions, with shots firing right and left, before, behind--everywhere--in quick succession.  The explanation must be that, every man being a trained marksman, nearly every bullet found its billet in a buffalo's body.  With his heart in his mouth, as well as his bullets, Victor Ravenshaw entered into the wild _melee_, scarce knowing what he was about. Although inexperienced, he knew well what to do, for many a time had he listened to the stories of buffalo-hunters in times past, and had put all their operations in practice with a wooden gun in mimic chase.  But it was not easy to keep cool.  He saw a fat animal just ahead of him, pushed close alongside; pointed his gun without raising it to his shoulder, and fired.  He almost burnt the animal's hair, so near was he. The buffalo fell and his horse leaped to one side.  Victor had forgotten this part of the programme.  He was nearly unseated, but held on by the mane and recovered his seat.  Immediately he poured powder into his palm--spilling a good deal and nearly dropping his gun from under his left arm in the operation--and commenced to reload while at full speed.  He spat a ball into the muzzle, just missed knocking out some of his front teeth, forgot to strike the butt on the pommel of the saddle, (which omission would have infallibly resulted in the bursting of the gun had it exploded), pointed at another animal and drew the trigger.  It missed fire, of course, for want of priming.  He remembered his error; corrected it, pointed again, fired, and dropped another cow.  Elated with success, he was about to reload when a panting bull came up behind him.  He seized his bridle, and swerved a little.  The bull thundered on, mad with rage; its tail aloft, and pursued by Michel Rollin, who seemed as angry as the bull.  \"Hah!  I vill stop you!\" growled the excited half-breed as he dashed along.  Animals were so numerous and close around them that they seemed in danger, at the moment, of being crushed.  Suddenly the bull turned sharp round on its pursuer.  To avoid it the horse leaped on one side; the girths gave way and the rider, saddle and all, were thrown on the bull's horns.  With a wild toss of its head, the surprised creature sent the man high into the air.  In his fall he alighted on the back of another buffalo--it was scarcely possible to avoid this in the crowd--and slipped to the ground.  Strange to say, Rollin was not hurt, but he was effectually thrown out of the running for that time, and Victor saw him no more till evening.  We relate no fanciful or exaggerated tale, good reader.  Our description is in strict accordance with the account of a credible eye-witness.  For upwards of an hour and a half the wild chase was kept up; the plain was strewn with the dead and dying, and horsemen as well as buffaloes were scattered far and wide.  Victor suddenly came upon Ian while in pursuit of an animal.  \"What luck!\" he shouted.  \"I've killed two--by accident, I think,\" said Ian, swerving towards his comrade, but not slackening his pace.  \"Capital!  I've killed three.  Who's that big fellow ahead after the old bull?\"  \"It's Winklemann.  He seems to prefer tough meat.\"  As Ian spoke the bull in question turned suddenly round, just as Rollin's bull had done, and received Winklemann's horse on its hairy forehead.  The poor man shot from the saddle as if he had been thrown from a catapult, turned a complete somersault over the buffalo, and fell on his back beyond.  Thrusting the horse to one side, the buffalo turned and seemed to gore the prostrate German as it dashed onward.  Puffing up at once, both Victor and Ian leaped from their horses and hastened to assist their friend.  He rose slowly to a sitting posture as they approached, and began to feel his legs with a troubled look.  \"Not much hurt, I hope?\" said Ian, kneeling beside him.  \"No bones broken?\"  \"No, I think not; mine leks are fery vell, but I fear mine "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21698"],["title","Rivers of Ice (#0)"],["body","OF ICE, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE ROVER'S RETURN.  On a certain summer morning, about the middle of the present century, a big bluff man, of seafaring aspect, found himself sauntering in a certain street near London Bridge.  He was a man of above fifty, but looked under forty in consequence of the healthful vigour of his frame, the freshness of his saltwater face, and the blackness of his shaggy hair.  Although his gait, pilot-cloth coat, and pocketed hands proclaimed him a sailor, there were one or two contradictory points about him.  A huge beard and moustache savoured more of the diggings than the deep, and a brown wide-awake with a prodigiously broad brim suggested the backwoods.  Pausing at the head of one of those narrow lanes which--running down between warehouses, filthy little rag and bone shops, and low poverty-stricken dwellings--appear to terminate their career, not unwillingly, in the Thames, the sailor gazed before him with nautical earnestness for a few seconds, then glanced at the corner house for a name; found no name; cast his eyes up to the strip of blue sky overhead, as if for inspiration; obtained none; planted his legs wide apart as if he had observed a squall coming, and expected the lane to lurch heavily--wrinkled his eyebrows, and pursed his lips.  \"Lost yer bearin's, capp'n?\" exclaimed a shrill pert voice at his side.  The seaman looked down, and beheld a small boy with a head like a disorderly door-mat, and garments to match.  He stood in what may be styled an imitative attitude, with his hands thrust into his ragged pockets, his little legs planted wide apart, his cap thrust well back on his head, and his eyebrows wrinkled.  He also pursed his lips to such an extent that they resembled a rosebud in a dirty bush.  \"Yes, imp,\" replied the seaman--he meant to have said \"impudence,\" but stopped at the first syllable as being sufficiently appropriate--\"yes, imp, I _have_ lost my bearings, and I'll give you a copper if you'll help me to find 'em.\"  \"Wot sort o' copper?\" demanded the urchin, \"there's three sorts of 'em, you know, in this 'ere kingdom--which appears to be a queendom at present--there's a farding and a ha'penny and a penny.  I mention it, capp'n,\" he added apologetically, \"in case you don't know, for you look as if you'd come from furrin parts.\"  The seaman's look of surprise melted into a broad grin of amusement while this speech was being fluently delivered.  At its conclusion he pulled out a penny and held it up.  \"Well, it ain't much,\" said the small boy, \"and I ain't used to hire myself out so cheap.  However, as you seem to be raither poorly off, I don't mind if I lend you a hand for that.  Only, please, don't mention it among your friends, as it would p'raps lower their opinion of you, d'you see?  Now then w'ot d'you want to know?\"  To this the \"capp'n,\" still smiling at the small boy's precocious insolence, replied that he was in search of an old woman who dwelt in a small court styled Grubb's Court, so he was told, which lay somewhere in that salubrious neighbourhood, and asked if he, the imp, knew of such a place.  \"Know's of it?  I should think I does.  W'y, I lives there.  It's right down at the foot o' this 'ere lane, an' a wery sweet 'ristocratik spot it is--quite a perninsular, bein' land, leastwise mud, a'most surrounded by water, the air bein' 'ighly condoosive to the 'ealth of rats, likewise cats.  As to old women, there's raither a broad sprinklin' of 'em in the court, rangin' from the ages of seventy to a hundred an twenty, more or less, an' you'll take some time to go over 'em all, capp'n, if you don't know your old woman's name.\"  \"Her name is Roby--,\" said the seaman.  \"O, Roby? ah,\" returned the small boy, looking sedately at the ground, \"let me see--yes, that's the name of the old 'ooman, I think, wot 'angs out in the cabin, right-'and stair, top floor, end of the passage, w'ere most wisiters flattens their noses, by consekince of there bein' no light, and a step close to the door which inwariably trips 'em up.  Most wisiters to that old 'ooman begins their acquaintance with her by knocking at her door with their noses instead of their knuckles.  We calls her place the cabin, 'cause the windows is raither small, and over'angs the river.\"  \"Well then, my lad,\" said the seaman, \"clap a stopper on your tongue, if you can, and heave ahead.\"  \"All right, capp'n,\" returned the small boy, \"foller me, an' don't be frightened.  Port your helm a bit here, there's a quicksand in the middle o' the track--so, steady!\"  Avoiding a large pool of mud with which the head of the lane was garnished, and which might have been styled the bathing, not to say wallowing, quarters of the Grubb's Court juveniles, the small boy led the bluff seaman towards the river without further remark, diverging only once from the straight road for a few seconds, for the purpose of making a furious rush at a sleeping cat with a yell worthy of a Cherokee savage, or a locomotive whistle; a slight pleasantry which had the double effect of shooting the cat through space in glaring convulsions, and filling the small boy's mind with the placidity which naturally follows a great success.  The lane presented this peculiarity, that the warehouses on its left side became more and more solid and vast and tall as they neared the river, while the shops and dwellings on its right became poorer, meaner, and more diminutive in the same direction, as if there were some mysterious connection between them, which involved the adversity of the one in exact proportion to the prosperity of the other.  Children and cats appeared to be the chief day-population of the place, and these disported themselves among the wheels of enormous waggons, and the legs of elephantine horses with an impunity which could only have been the result of life-long experience.  The seaman was evidently unaccustomed to such scenes, for more than once during the short period of his progress down the lane, he uttered an exclamation of alarm, and sprang to the rescue of those large babies which are supposed to have grown sufficiently old to become nursing mothers to smaller babies--acts which were viewed with a look of pity by the small boy, and called from him the encouraging observations, \"Keep your mind easy, capp'n; _they're_ all right, bless you; the hosses knows 'em, and wouldn't 'urt 'em on no account.\"  \"This is Grubb's Court,\" said the boy, turning sharply to the right and passing through a low archway.  \"Thank 'ee, lad,\" said the seaman, giving him a sixpence.  The small boy opened his eyes very wide indeed, exclaiming, \"Hallo!  I say, capp'n, wot's this?\" at the same time, however, putting the coin in his pocket with an air which plainly said, \"Whether you've made a mistake or not, you needn't expect to get it back again.\"  Evidently the seaman entertained no such expectations, for he turned away and became absorbed in the scene around him.  It was not cheering.  Though the summer sun was high and powerful, it failed to touch the broken pavement of Grubb's Court, or to dry up the moisture which oozed from it and crept up the walls of the surrounding houses.  Everything was very old, very rotten, very crooked, and very dirty.  The doorways round the court were wide open--always open--in some cases, because of there being no doors; in other cases, because the tenements to which they led belonged to a variety of families, largely composed of children who could not, even on tiptoe, reach or manipulate door-handles.  Nursing mothers of two feet high were numerous, staggering about with nurslings of a foot and a half long.  A few of the nurslings, temporarily abandoned by the premature mothers, lay sprawling--in some cases squalling--on the moist pavement, getting over the ground like large snails, and leaving slimy tracks behind them. Little boys, of the \"City Arab\" type, were sprinkled here and there, and one or two old women sat on door-steps contemplating the scene, or conversing with one or two younger women.  Some of the latter were busy washing garments so dirty, that the dirty water of old Father Thames seemed quite a suitable purifier.  \"Gillie,\" cried one of the younger women referred to, wiping the soap-suds from her red arms, \"come here, you bad, naughty boy.  W'ere 'ave you bin?  I want you to mind baby.\"  \"W'y, mother,\" cried the small boy--who answered to the name of Gillie--\"don't you see I'm engaged?  I'm a-showin' this 'ere sea-capp'n the course he's got to steer for port.  He wants to make the cabin of old mother Roby.\"  \"W'y don't you do it quickly, then?\" demanded Gillie's mother, \"you bad, naughty, wicked boy.  Beg your parding, sir,\" she added, to the seaman, \"the boy 'an't got no sense, besides bein' wicked and naughty--'e ain't 'ad no train', sir, that's w'ere it is, all along of my 'avin' too much to do, an' a large family, sir, with no 'usband to speak of; right up the stair, sir, to the top, and along the passage-door straight before you at the hend of it.  Mind the step, sir, w'en you gits up.  Go up with the gentleman, you bad, wicked, naughty boy, and show--\"  The remainder of the sentence became confused in distance, as the boy and the seaman climbed the stair; but a continuous murmuring sound, as of a vocal torrent, conveyed the assurance that the mother of Gillie was still holding forth.  \"'Ere it is,\" said the young pilot, pausing at the top of the staircase, near the entrance to a very dark passage.  \"Keep 'er 'ead as she goes, but I'd recommend you to shorten sail, mind your 'elm, an 'ave the anchor ready to let go.\"  Having thus accommodated his language to the supposed intelligence of the seaman, the elfin youth stood listening with intense eagerness and expectation as the other went into the passage, and, by sundry kicks and bumps against wooden walls, gave evidence that he found the channel intricate.  Presently a terrible kick occurred.  This was the seaman's toe against "]]]
