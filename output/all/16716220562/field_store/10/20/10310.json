Why not go out at once! and let be hurl'd   Dark, dread, unmitigated darkness o'er the world?   Why should the heavenly constellations shine?   Why should the weather evermore be fine?   Why should this rolling ball go whirling round?   Why should the noise of mirth and music sound?   Why should the sparrow chirp, the blackbird sing,   The mountains echo, and the valleys ring,   With all that's cheerful, humorous, and glad,   Now that my heart is smitten and my brain gone mad?\"  Queeker fetched a long deep-drawn sigh at this point, the agony of intense composition being for a moment relaxed.  Then, catching his breath and glaring, he went on in a somewhat gentler strain--    \"Forgive me, Floating-light, and you, ye sun,   Moon, stars, and elements of Nature, every one;   I did but vent my misery and spleen   In utt'ring words of fury that I hardly mean.   At least I do in part--but hold! why not?   Oh! cease ye fiendish thoughts that rage and plot   To bring about my ruin.  Hence! avaunt!   Or else in pity tell me what you want.   I cannot live, and yet I would not die!   My hopes are blighted!  Where, oh whither shall I fly?   'Tis past!  I'll cease to daily with vain sophistry,   And try the virtue of a calm philosophy.\"  The effect of composition upon Queeker was such that when he had completed his task he felt greatly tranquillised, and, having shut up his portfolio, formed the sudden resolution of dropping in upon the Durants to tea.  Meantime, and before the love-sick youth had begun the lines above quoted, Katie and her cousin walked home by a road which conducted them close past the edge of those extensive sandy plains called the Denes of Yarmouth.  Here, at the corner of a quiet street, they were arrested by the sobbing of a little boy who sat on a railing by the roadside, swaying himself to and fro in an agony of grief.  Katie's sympathetic heart was instantly touched.  She at once went up to the boy, and made earnest inquiries into the cause of his distress.  \"Please, ma'am,\" said the boy, \"I've lost a shillin', and I can't find it nowheres.  Oh, wot ever shall I do?  My mother gave it me to give with two other bobs to my poor sick brother whom I've comed all this way to see, and there I've gone an' lost it, an' I'll 'ave to lay out all night in the cold, for I dursn't go to see 'im without the money--boo, hoo!\"  \"Oh, how _very_ unfortunate!\" exclaimed Katie with real feeling for the boy, whose soul was thus steeped to all appearance in woe unutterable, was very small, and very dirty and ragged, and had an extremely handsome intelligent face, with a profusion of wild brown curls.  \"But I can make that up to you, poor boy,\" she added, drawing out her purse, \"here is a shilling for you.  Where do you live?\"  \"At Ramsgate, ma'am.\"  \"At Ramsgate?\" exclaimed Katie in surprise, \"why, how did you manage to get here?\"  \"I come in a lugger, ma'am, as b'longs to a friend o' ourn.  We've just arrived, an' we goes away agin to-morrow.\"  \"Indeed!  That will give you little time to see your sick brother.  What is the matter with him?\"  \"Oh, he's took very bad, ma'am.  I'm sorry to say he's bad altogether, ma'am.  Bin an' run'd away from 'ome.  A'most broke his mother's 'eart, he has, an' fall'd sick here, he did.\"  The small boy paused abruptly at this point, and looked earnestly in Katie's kind and pitiful face.  \"Where does your brother live?\" asked Katie.  The small boy looked rather perplexed, and said that he couldn't rightly remember the name of the street, but that the owner of the lugger \"know'd it.\"  Whereat Katie seemed disappointed, and said she would have been so glad to have visited him, and given him such little comforts as his disease might warrant.  \"Oh, ma'am,\" exclaimed the small boy, looking wistfully at her with his large blue eyes, \"_wot_ a pity I've forgot it!  The doctor ordered 'im wine too--it was as much as 'is life was worth not to 'ave wine,--but of course they couldn't afford to git 'im wine--even cheap wine would do well enough, at two bob or one bob the bottle.  If you was to give me two bob--shillins I mean, ma'am--I'd git it for 'im to-night.\"  Katie and her cousin conversed aside in low tones for a minute or two as to the propriety of complying with this proposal, and came to the conclusion that the boy was such a nice outspoken honest-like fellow, that it would do no harm to risk that sum in the circumstances.  Two shillings were therefore put into the boy's dirty little hand, and he was earnestly cautioned to take care of it, which he earnestly, and no doubt honestly, promised to do.  \"What is your name, boy?\" asked Katie, as she was about to leave him.  \"Billy--Billy Towler, ma'am,\" answered the urchin, pulling his forelock by way of respectful acknowledgment, \"but my friends they calls me Walleye, chiefly in consikence o' my bein' wery much the rewerse of blind, ma'am, and niver capable of bein' cotched in a state o' slumber at no time.\"  This reply had the effect of slightly damaging the small boy's character for simplicity in Katie's mind, although it caused both herself and her companion to laugh.  \"Well, Billy,\" she said, opening her card-case, \"here is my card--give it to your sick brother, and when he sends it to me with his address written on the back of it I'll call on him.\"  \"Thankee, ma'am,\" said the small boy.  After he had said this, he stood silently watching the retiring figure of his benefactress, until she was out of sight, and then dashing round the corner of a bye-street which was somewhat retired, he there went off into uncontrollable fits of laughter--slapped his small thighs, held his lean little sides with both hands, threw his ragged cap into the air, and in various other ways gave evidence of ecstatic delight.  He was still engaged in these violent demonstrations of feeling when Morley Jones--having just landed at Yarmouth, and left the sloop _Nora_ in charge of young Welton--came smartly round the corner, and, applying his heavy boot to the small boy's person, kicked him into the middle of the road.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE TEMPTER AND THE TEMPTED.  \"What are ye howlin' there for, an' blockin' up the Queen's highway like that, you precious young villain?\" demanded Morley Jones.  \"An' wot are you breakin' the Queen's laws for like that?\" retorted Billy Towler, dancing into the middle of the road and revolving his small fists in pugilistic fashion.  \"You big hairy walrus, I don't know whether to 'ave you up before the beaks for assault and battery or turn to an' give 'ee a good lickin'.\"  Mr Jones showed all his teeth with an approving grin, and the small boy grinned in return, but still kept on revolving his fists, and warning the walrus to \"look hout and defend hisself if he didn't want his daylights knocked out or his bows stove in!\"  \"You're a smart youth, you are,\" said Jones.  \"Ha! you're afraid, are you? an' wants to make friends, but I won't 'ave it at no price.  Come on, will you?\"  Jones, still grinning from ear to ear, made a rush at the urchin, who, however, evaded him with such ease that the man perceived he had not the smallest chance of catching him.  \"I say, my lad,\" he asked, stopping and becoming suddenly grave, \"where d'you come from?\"  \"I comes from where I b'longs to, and where I'm agoin' back to w'en it suits me.\"  \"Very good,\" retorted Jones, \"and I suppose you don't object to earn a little money in an easy way?\"  \"Yes, I do object,\" replied Billy; \"it ain't worth my while to earn a _little_ money in any way, no matter how easy; I never deals in small sums.  A fi' pun' note is the lowest figur' as I can stoop to.\"  \"You'll not object, however, to a gift, I daresay,\" remarked Jones, as he tossed a half-crown towards the boy.  Billy caught it as deftly as a dog catches a bit of biscuit, looked at it in great surprise, tossed it in the air, bit its rim critically, and finally slid it into his trousers pocket.  \"Well, you know,\" he said slowly, \"to obleege a _friend_, I'm willin' to accept.\"  \"Now then, youngster, if I'm willing to trust that half-crown in your clutches, you may believe I have got something to say to 'ee worth your while listenin' to; for you may see I'm not the man to give it to 'ee out o' Christian charity.\"  \"That's true,\" remarked Billy, who by this time had become serious, and stood with his hands in his pockets, still, however, at a respectful distance.  \"Well, the fact is,\" said Mr Jones, \"that I've bin lookin' out of late for a smart lad with a light heart and a light pocket, and that ain't troubled with much of a conscience.\"  \"That's me to a tee,\" said Billy promptly; \"my 'art's as light as a feather, and my pocket is as light as a maginstrate's wisdom.  As for conscience, the last beak as I wos introdooced to said I must have bin born without a conscience altogether; an' 'pon my honour I think he wos right, for I never felt it yet, though I've often tried--'xcept once, w'en I'd cleaned out the pocket of a old ooman as was starin' in at a shop winder in Cheapside, and she fainted dead away w'en she found it out, and her little grand-darter looked so pale and pitiful that I says to myself, `Hallo!  Walleye, you've bin to the wrong shop this time; go an' put it back, ye young dog;' so I obeyed orders, an' slipped back the purse while pretendin' to help the old ooman.  It wos risky work, though, for a bobby twigged me, and it was only my good wind and tough pair o' shanks that saved me.  Now,\" continued the urchin, knitting his brows as he contemplated the knotty point, \"I've had my doubts whether that wos conscience, or a sort o' nat'ral weakness pecooliar to my constitootion.  I've half a mind to call on the Bishop of London on the point one o' these days.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],["title","The Gorilla Hunters (#0)"],["body","GORILLA HUNTERS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  IN WHICH THE HUNTERS ARE INTRODUCED.  It was five o'clock in the afternoon.  There can be no doubt whatever as to that.  Old Agnes may say what she pleases--she has a habit of doing so--but I know for certain (because I looked at my watch not ten minutes before it happened) that it was exactly five o'clock in the afternoon when I received a most singular and every way remarkable visit--a visit which has left an indelible impression on my memory, as well it might; for, independent of its singularity and unexpectedness, one of its results was the series of strange adventures which are faithfully detailed in this volume.  It happened thus:--  I was seated in an armchair in my private study in a small town on the west coast of England.  It was a splendid afternoon, and it was exactly five o'clock.  Mark that.  Not that there is anything singular about the mere fact, neither is it in any way mixed up with the thread of this tale; but old Agnes is very obstinate--singularly positive--and I have a special desire that she should see it in print, that I have not given in on that point.  Yes, it was five precisely, and a beautiful evening.  I was ruminating, as I frequently do, on the pleasant memories of bygone days, especially the happy days that I spent long ago among the coral islands of the Pacific, when a tap at the door aroused me.  \"Come in.\"  \"A veesiter, sir,\" said old Agnes (my landlady), \"an' he'll no gie his name.\"  Old Agnes, I may remark, is a Scotchwoman.  \"Show him in,\" said I.  \"Maybe he's a pickpocket,\" suggested Agnes.  \"I'll take my chance of that.\"  \"Ay! that's like 'ee.  Cares for naethin'.  Losh, man, what if he cuts yer throat?\"  \"I'll take my chance of that too; only _do_ show him in, my good woman,\" said I, with a gesture of impatience that caused the excellent (though obstinate) old creature to depart, grumbling.  In another moment a quick step was heard on the stair, and a stranger burst into the room, shut the door in my landlady's face as she followed him, and locked it.  I was naturally surprised, though not alarmed, by the abrupt and eccentric conduct of my visitor, who did not condescend to take off his hat, but stood with his arms folded on his breast, gazing at me and breathing hard.  \"You are agitated, sir; pray be seated,\" said I, pointing to a chair.  The stranger, who was a little man and evidently a gentleman, made no reply, but, seizing a chair, placed it exactly before me, sat down on it as he would have seated himself on a horse, rested his arms on the back, and stared me in the face.  \"You are disposed to be facetious,\" said I, smiling (for I never take offence without excessively good reason).  \"Not at all, by no means,\" said he, taking off his hat and throwing it recklessly on the floor.  \"You are Mr Rover, I presume?\"  \"The same, sir, at your service.\"  \"Are you? oh, that's yet to be seen!  Pray, is your Christian name Ralph?\"  \"It is,\" said I, in some surprise at the coolness of my visitor.  \"Ah! just so.  Christian name Ralph, t'other name Rover--Ralph Rover. Very good.  Age twenty-two yesterday, eh?\"  \"My birthday _was_ yesterday, and my age _is_ twenty-two.  You appear to know more of my private history than I have the pleasure of knowing of yours.  Pray, sir, may I--but, bless me! are you unwell?\"  I asked this in some alarm, because the little man was rolling about in his seat, holding his sides, and growing very red in the face.  \"Oh no! not at all; perfectly well--never was better in my life,\" he said, becoming all at once preternaturally grave.  \"You were once in the Pacific--lived on a coral island--\"  \"I did.\"  \"Oh, don't trouble yourself to answer.  Just shut up for a minute or two.  You were rather a soft green youth then, and you don't seem to be much harder or less verdant now.\"  \"Sir!\"  I exclaimed, getting angry.  \"Just so,\" continued he, \"and you knew a young rascal there--\"  \"I know a rascal _here_,\" I exclaimed, starting up, \"whom I'll kick--\"  \"What!\" cried the little stranger, also starting up and capsizing the chair; \"Ralph Rover, has time and sunburning and war so changed my visage that you cannot recognise Peterkin?\"  I almost gasped for breath.  \"Peterkin--Peterkin Gay!\"  I exclaimed.  I am not prone to indulge in effeminate demonstration, but I am not ashamed to confess that when I gazed on the weather-beaten though ruddy countenance of my old companion, and observed the eager glance of his bright blue eyes, I was quite overcome, and rushed violently into his arms.  I may also add that until that day I had had no idea of Peterkin's physical strength; for during the next five minutes he twisted me about and spun me round and round my own room until my brain began to reel, and I was fain to cry him mercy.  \"So, you're all right--the same jolly, young old wiseacre in whiskers and long coat,\" cried Peterkin.  \"Come now, Ralph, sit down if you can. I mean to stay with you all evening, and all night, and all to-morrow, and all next day, so we'll have lots of time to fight our battles o'er again.  Meanwhile compose yourself, and I'll tell you what I've come about.  Of course, my first and chief reason was to see your face, old boy; but I have another reason too--a very peculiar reason.  I've a proposal to make and a plan to unfold, both of 'em stunners; they'll shut you up and screw you down, and altogether flabbergast you when you hear 'em, so sit down and keep quiet--do.\"  I sat down accordingly, and tried to compose myself; but, to say truth, I was so much overjoyed and excited by the sight of my old friend and companion that I had some difficulty at first in fixing my attention on what he said, the more especially that he spoke with extreme volubility, and interrupted his discourse very frequently, in order to ask questions or to explain.  \"Now, old fellow,\" he began, \"here goes, and mind you don't interrupt me.  Well, I mean to go, and I mean you to go with me, to--but, I forgot, perhaps you won't be able to go.  What are you?\"  \"What am I?\"  \"Ay, your profession, your calling; lawyer, M.D., scrivener--which?\"  \"I am a naturalist.\"  \"A what?\"  \"A naturalist.\"  \"Ralph,\" said Peterkin slowly, \"have you been long troubled with that complaint?\"  \"Yes,\" I replied, laughing; \"I have suffered from it from my earliest infancy, more or less.\"  \"I thought so,\" rejoined my companion, shaking his head gravely.  \"I fancied that I observed the development of that disease when we lived together on the coral island.  It don't bring you in many thousands a year, does it?\"  \"No,\" said I, \"it does not.  I am only an amateur, having a sufficiency of this world's goods to live on without working for my bread.  But although my dear father at his death left me a small fortune, which yields me three hundred a year, I do not feel entitled to lead the life of an idler in this busy world, where so many are obliged to toil night and day for the bare necessaries of life.  I have therefore taken to my favourite studies as a sort of business, and flatter myself that I have made one or two not unimportant discoveries, and added a few mites to the sum of human knowledge.  A good deal of my time is spent in scientific roving expeditions throughout the country, and in contributing papers to several magazines.\"  While I was thus speaking I observed that Peterkin's face was undergoing the most remarkable series of changes of expression, which, as I concluded, merged into a smile of beaming delight, as he said,--\"Ralph, you're a trump!\"  \"Possibly,\" said I, \"you are right; but, setting that question aside for the present, let me remind you that you have not yet told me where you mean to go to.\"  \"I mean,\" said Peterkin slowly, placing both hands on his knees and looking me steadily in the face--\"I mean to go a-hunting in--but I forgot.  You don't know that I'm a hunter, a somewhat famous hunter?\"  \"Of course I don't.  You are so full of your plans and proposals that you have not yet told me where you have been or what doing these six years.  And you ye never written to me once all that time, shabby fellow.  I thought you were dead.\"  \"Did you go into mourning for me, Ralph?\"  \"No, of course not.\"  \"A pretty fellow you are to find fault.  You thought that I, your oldest and best friend, was dead, and you did not go into mourning.  How could I write to you when you parted from me without giving me your address? It was a mere chance my finding you out even now.  I was taking a quiet cup of coffee in the commercial room of a hotel not far distant, when I overheard a stranger speaking of his friend `Ralph Rover, the philosopher,' so I plunged at him promiscuously, and made him give me your address.  But I've corresponded with Jack ever since we parted on the pier at Dover.\"  \"What!  Jack--Jack Martin?\"  I exclaimed, as a warm gush of feeling filled my heart at the sound of his well-remembered name.  \"Is Jack alive?\"  \"Alive!  I should think so.  If possible, he's more alive than ever; for I should suppose he must be full-grown now, which he was not when we last met.  He and I have corresponded regularly.  He lives in the north of England, and by good luck happens to be just now within thirty miles of this town.  You don't mean to say, Ralph, that you have never met!\"  \"Never.  The very same mistake that happened with you occurred between him and me.  We parted vowing to correspond as long as we should live, and three hours after I remembered that we had neglected to exchange our addresses, so that we could not correspond.  I have often, often made inquiries both for you and him, but have always failed.  I never heard of Jack from the time we parted at Dover till to-day.\"  \"Then no doubt you thought us both dead, and yet you did not go into mourning for either of us!  O Ralph, Ralph, I had entertained too good an opinion of you.\"  \"But tell me about Jack,\" said I, impatient to hear more concerning my dear old comrade.  \"Not just now,"]]]
