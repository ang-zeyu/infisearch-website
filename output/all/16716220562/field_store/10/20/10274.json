Indeed, a white rock usually lays about the depth of two feet under the soil.  It is difficult to cut through, and does not pay for the trouble.\"  \"Do you find gold on the surface?\" continued Frank.  \"Almost none.  Being weighty, it sinks downwards through the loose earth, and settles on the rock.  I see, gentlemen, that you are strangers, and, if I mistake not, Englishmen.  I am a countryman, hailing from Cornwall, and, if you have no objection, will accompany you in your inspection of the diggings.  My experience may be of service to you, perhaps, and I can at all events guard you from the scoundrels who make a livelihood by deceiving and cheating newcomers.\"  Frank thanked the Cornish miner for his kind offer, and accompanied by this new and intelligent friend, he and Joe continued their ramble.  One of the first men whom they addressed happened to be one of the sharpers referred to.  He was a Yankee, and although the Yankees were by no means the _only_ scoundrels there, for there was no lack of such-- English, Scotch, Irish, German, and Chinese--they were unquestionably the \"'cutest!\"  This man was very busy when they approached, and appeared to be quite indifferent to them.  Observing, however, that they were about to pass by, he looked up, and, wiping his brow, said, \"Good-evening.\"  \"Good-evening,\" said Frank, \"What luck?\"  \"Luck enough,\" replied the man, \"I'm tired of luck; the fact is, I have made my pile, and want to make tracks for home, but this is such a splendid claim that I can't tear myself away from it.  See here.\"  He struck his shovel into the ground as he spoke, and lifted a quantity of earth, or \"dirt,\" into a basin, washed it out, and displayed to the astonished gaze of the \"greenhorns,\" as newcomers were called, a large quantity of gold-dust, with several small nuggets interspersed.  \"Splendid!\" exclaimed Frank.  \"You'll make your fortin,\" said Joe Graddy.  \"It's made already, I reckon,\" said the Yankee, with the air of a man who was overburdened with success.  \"The truth is, I want to get away before the rainy season comes on, and will part with this here claim for an old song.  I'm half inclined to make you a present of it, but I don't quite see my way to that.  However, I've no objection to hand it over for, say a hundred dollars.\"  \"H'm!\" ejaculated the Cornish man, \"will you take a shovelful from the _other_ end of the claim and wash it out?\"  The Yankee smiled, put his finger on the side of his nose, and, wishing them success in whatever line of life they chose to undertake, went on with his work.  The Cornish miner laughed, and, as he walked away, explained to his astonished companions that this was a common dodge.  \"The rascals,\" he said, \"hide a little gold in a claim that is valueless, and, digging it up as you have seen, wash it out in the presence of newcomers, in the hope of taking them in.  But here we come to a party who will show you a little of legitimate gold-washing.\"  They approached, as he spoke, a bend of the river where several men were busy at work--some with pick and shovel, some with the cradle, and others with tin washing-pans.  Here they stood for some time watching the process of gold-washing.  At the time of which we write, only the two simple processes of washing, with the pan and with the cradle, were practised at Bigbear Gully, the more elaborate methods of crushing quartz, etcetera, not having been introduced.  The most simple of these was the _pan_ process, which was much in favour, because the soil, or \"dirt\" was so rich in gold-dust that it \"paid\" well, and it only required that the miner should possess a pick, a shovel, and a tin pan.  With this very limited stock in trade he could begin without delay, and earn at least a subsistence; perhaps even make \"his pile,\" or, in other words, his fortune.  One of the men connected with the party above referred to was engaged in pan-washing.  He stood in a hole four feet deep, and had just filled a flat tin dish with dirt, as Frank and his companions stopped to observe him.  Pouring water on the dirt, the miner set the pan down, dipped both hands into it and stirred the contents about until they became liquid mud--removing the stones in the process, and operating in such a manner that he caused some of the contents to escape, or spill, off the top at each revolution.  More water was added from time to time, and the process continued until all the earthy matter was washed away, and nothing but a kind of black sand, which contained the gold, left at the bottom.  The separation of the metal from the black sand was an after process, and a more difficult one.  It was accomplished in some cases by means of a magnet which attracted the sand.  In other cases this was blown carefully off from a sheet of paper, but a few of the miners, who managed matters in a more extensive and thorough manner, effected the separation by means of quicksilver.  They mixed it with the sand, added a little water, and stirred it about until the gold amalgamated with the quicksilver, converting it into a little massive, tangible, and soft heap.  It was then put into a buckskin cloth, through the pores of which the quicksilver was squeezed, leaving the pure gold behind.  Any trifling quantity of the former that might still remain was afterwards evaporated on a heated shovel or pan.  An expert worker in average ground could gather and wash a panful of dirt every ten minutes.  There were few places in Bigbear Gully that would not yield two shillings' worth of gold to the panful, so that in those early days, while the surface soil was still fresh, a man could, by steady work alone--without incidental nuggets--work out gold-dust to the value of between five and six pounds sterling a day, while, occasionally, he came upon a lump, or nugget, equal, perhaps, to what he could procure by the labour of a week or more.  Many, however, of the more energetic miners worked in companies and used cradles, by means of which they washed out a much larger quantity of gold in shorter time; and in places which did not yield a sufficient return by the pan process to render it worth while working, the cradle owners obtained ample remuneration for their toil.  The cradle, which Frank and his comrades saw working not far from the pan-washer, was by no means a complex affair.  It was a semi-circular trough hollowed out of a log six feet long by sixteen inches diameter. At one end of this was a perforated copper or iron plate, with a rim of iron or wood round it, on which the dirt was thrown, and water poured thereon, by one man, while the cradle was rocked by another.  The gold, earth, and small gravel were thus separated from the larger stones, and washed down the trough, in which, at intervals, two tranverse bars were placed; the first of these arrested the gold, which from its great weight sunk to the bottom, while the gravel, and lighter substances, were swept away by the current.  The lower bar caught any particles that, by awkward management, might have passed the upper one.  Having satisfied their curiosity, and learned from an obliging miner the method of washing the gold, our adventurers returned to Jeffson's store, and there spent the night in discussing their plan of procedure.  It was decided, first of all, that they should stick together and work in company.  \"You see, mates,\" observed Joe Graddy, after the others had given their opinions, \"this is how it stands.  I must stick by Mister Allfrey, 'cause why, we've bin pullin' in the same boat together for some time past, an' it's nat'ral for to wish to continue so to do.  Then Douglas and Meyer ought to stick to us, 'cause we have for so long stuck to them, an' they ought to stick to one another 'cause they're mootooally fond o' misty-physical jabberin' on religious subjects, which is greatly to our edification, seein' that we don't onderstand it, and finds it highly amoosin' while we smoke our pipes after a hard day's work, d'ye see?  So, on them grounds, I votes that we j'ine company an' go to work at seven o'clock to-morrow mornin'.\"  \"Das ist goot advise,\" said the German, slapping Joe on the shoulder, \"an' I vould add mine vott, vich is, to make you commandair of de forces.\"  \"Very good, then I command you to shut your mouth, and go to bed.\"  \"Unpossabil,\" replied Meyer, \"for I do snor, an' always do him troo de mout'.\"  \"I prefers to do it through the nose,\" remarked Joe, rolling his blanket round him and lying down on the hard boards with his head on a sack.  Expressing a hope that they would restrain their snoring propensities as much as possible, the remaining members of the new co-partnery lay down beside them, and were speedily in the land of dreams.  Need we add that their dreams that night were of gold?  Surely not, and perhaps it were equally unnecessary to observe that their slumbers were profound.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  GIVES THE RESULT OF THE FIRST DAY'S DIGGING, AND SHOWS THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF LYNCH-LAW.  Next morning Frank and his friends went out to choose their claim.  As we have said, the Bigbear Gully was not at that time generally known.  A comparatively small number of diggers had set to work in it, and they were careful to avoid giving much information to \"prospecting,\" or searching parties, because they knew that if the richness of the soil were known, there would be a general rush to it from all quarters. There was therefore no lack of unoccupied ground.  A suitable spot was chosen in a pleasant grove on the banks of the stream where it swept round the base of a magnificent precipice, not far from Jeffson's store.  Here Douglas, Meyer, and Joe set to work to build a kind of hut of logs, branches, and mud, while Frank returned to the store to purchase the necessary tools.  Having little money left, he was compelled to take credit, which Jeffson readily granted to him, knowing full well that there was little fear of the account remaining long unpaid.

THE BACKWOODS SETTLEMENT--CRUSOE'S PARENTAGE AND EARLY HISTORY--THE AGONISING PAINS AND SORROWS OF HIS PUPPYHOOD, AND OTHER INTERESTING MATTERS.  The dog Crusoe was once a pup.  Now do not, courteous reader, toss your head contemptuously, and exclaim, \"Of course he was; I could have told _you_ that.\"  You know very well that you have often seen a man above six feet high, broad and powerful as a lion, with a bronzed shaggy visage and the stern glance of an eagle, of whom you have said, or thought, or heard others say, \"It is scarcely possible to believe that such a man was once a squalling baby.\"  If you had seen our hero in all the strength and majesty of full-grown doghood, you would have experienced a vague sort of surprise had we told you--as we now repeat-- that the dog Crusoe was once a pup--a soft, round, sprawling, squeaking pup, as fat as a tallow candle, and as blind as a bat.  But we draw particular attention to the fact of Crusoe's having once been a pup, because in connection with the days of his puppyhood there hangs a tale.  This peculiar dog may thus be said to have had two tails--one in connection with his body, the other with his career.  This tale, though short, is very harrowing, and, as it is intimately connected with Crusoe's subsequent history, we will relate it here.  But before doing so we must beg our reader to accompany us beyond the civilised portions of the United States of America--beyond the frontier settlements of the \"far west,\" into those wild prairies which are watered by the great Missouri river--the Father of Waters--and his numerous tributaries.  Here dwell the Pawnees, the Sioux, the Delawares, the Crows, the Blackfeet, and many other tribes of Red Indians, who are gradually retreating step by step towards the Rocky Mountains as the advancing white man cuts down their trees and ploughs up their prairies.  Here, too, dwell the wild horse and the wild ass, the deer, the buffalo, and the badger; all, men and brutes alike, wild as the power of untamed and ungovernable passion can make them, and free as the wind that sweeps over their mighty plains.  There is a romantic and exquisitely beautiful spot on the banks of one of the tributaries above referred to--a long stretch of mingled woodland and meadow, with a magnificent lake lying like a gem in its green bosom--which goes by the name of the Mustang Valley.  This remote vale, even at the present day, is but thinly peopled by white men, and is still a frontier settlement round which the wolf and the bear prowl curiously, and from which the startled deer bounds terrified away.  At the period of which we write the valley had just been taken possession of by several families of squatters, who, tired of the turmoil and the squabbles of the then frontier settlements, had pushed boldly into the far west to seek a new home for themselves, where they could have \"elbow room,\" regardless alike of the dangers they might encounter in unknown lands and of the Red-skins who dwelt there.  The squatters were well armed with axes, rifles, and ammunition.  Most of the women were used to dangers and alarms, and placed implicit reliance in the power of their fathers, husbands, and brothers to protect them--and well they might, for a bolder set of stalwart men than these backwoodsmen never trod the wilderness.  Each had been trained to the use of the rifle and the axe from infancy, and many of them had spent so much of their lives in the woods, that they were more than a match for the Indian in his own peculiar pursuits of hunting and war. When the squatters first issued from the woods bordering the valley, an immense herd of wild horses or mustangs were browsing on the plain. These no sooner beheld the cavalcade of white men, than, uttering a wild neigh, they tossed their flowing manes in the breeze and dashed away like a whirlwind.  This incident procured the valley its name.  The newcomers gave one satisfied glance at their future home, and then set to work to erect log huts forthwith.  Soon the axe was heard ringing through the forests, and tree after tree fell to the ground, while the occasional sharp ring of a rifle told that the hunters were catering successfully for the camp.  In course of time the Mustang Valley began to assume the aspect of a thriving settlement, with cottages and waving fields clustered together in the midst of it.  Of course the savages soon found it out, and paid it occasional visits. These dark-skinned tenants of the woods brought furs of wild animals with them, which they exchanged with the white men for knives, and beads, and baubles and trinkets of brass and tin.  But they hated the \"Pale-faces\" with bitter hatred, because their encroachments had at this time materially curtailed the extent of their hunting grounds, and nothing but the numbers and known courage of the squatters prevented these savages from butchering and scalping them all.  The leader of this band of pioneers was a Major Hope, a gentleman whose love for nature in its wildest aspects determined him to exchange barrack life for a life in the woods.  The major was a first-rate shot, a bold, fearless man, and an enthusiastic naturalist.  He was past the prime of life, and, being a bachelor, was unencumbered with a family. His first act on reaching the site of the new settlement was to commence the erection of a block-house, to which the people might retire in case of a general attack by the Indians.  In this block-house Major Hope took up his abode as the guardian of the settlement,--and here the dog Crusoe was born; here he sprawled in the early morn of life; here he leaped, and yelped, and wagged his shaggy tail in the excessive glee of puppyhood, and from the wooden portals of this block-house he bounded forth to the chase in all the fire, and strength, and majesty of full-grown doghood.  Crusoe's father and mother were magnificent Newfoundlanders.  There was no doubt as to their being of the genuine breed, for Major Hope had received them as a parting gift from a brother officer, who had brought them both from Newfoundland itself.  The father's name was Crusoe; the mother's name was Fan.  Why the father had been so called no one could tell.  The man from whom Major Hope's friend had obtained the pair was a poor, illiterate fisherman, who had never heard of the celebrated \"Robinson\" in all his life.  All he knew was that Fan had been named after his own wife.  As for Crusoe, he had got him from a friend, who had got him from another friend, whose cousin had received him as a marriage gift from a friend of _his_; and that each had said to the other that the dog's name was \"Crusoe,\" without reasons being asked or given on either side.  On arriving at New York the major's friend, as we have said, made him a present of the dogs.  Not being much of a dog fancier, he soon tired of old Crusoe, and gave him away to a gentleman, who took him down to Florida, and that was the end of him.  He was never heard of more.  When Crusoe, junior, was born, he was born, of course, without a name. That was given to him afterwards in honour of his father.  He was also born in company with a brother and two sisters, all of whom drowned themselves accidentally, in the first month of their existence, by falling into the river which flowed past the block-house,--a calamity which occurred, doubtless, in consequence of their having gone out without their mother's leave.  Little Crusoe was with his brother and sisters at the time, and fell in along with them, but was saved from sharing their fate by his mother, who, seeing what had happened, dashed with an agonised howl into the water, and, seizing him in her mouth, brought him ashore in a half-drowned condition.  She afterwards brought the others ashore one by one, but the poor little things were dead.  And now we come to the harrowing part of our tale, for the proper understanding of which the foregoing dissertation was needful.  One beautiful afternoon, in that charming season of the American year called the Indian summer, there came a family of Sioux Indians to the Mustang Valley, and pitched their tent close to the block-house.  A young hunter stood leaning against the gate-post of the palisades, watching the movements of the Indians, who, having just finished a long \"palaver\" or \"talk\" with Major Hope, were now in the act of preparing supper.  A fire had been kindled on the green sward in front of the tent, and above it stood a tripod, from which depended a large tin camp-kettle.  Over this hung an ill-favoured Indian woman, or squaw, who, besides attending to the contents of the pot, bestowed sundry cuffs and kicks upon her little child, which sat near to her playing with several Indian curs that gambolled round the fire.  The master of the family and his two sons reclined on buffalo robes, smoking their stone pipes or calumets in silence.  There was nothing peculiar in their appearance.  Their faces were neither dignified nor coarse in expression, but wore an aspect of stupid apathy, which formed a striking contrast to the countenance of the young hunter, who seemed an amused spectator of their proceedings.  The youth referred to was very unlike, in many respects, to what we are accustomed to suppose a backwoods hunter should be.  He did not possess that quiet gravity and staid demeanour which often characterise these men.  True, he was tall and strongly made, but no one would have called him stalwart, and his frame indicated grace and agility rather than strength.  But the point about him which rendered him different from his companions was his bounding, irrepressible flow of spirits, strangely coupled with an intense love of solitary wandering in the woods.  None seemed so well fitted for social enjoyment as he; none laughed so heartily, or expressed such glee in his mischief-loving eye; yet for days together he went off alone into the forest, and"]]]
