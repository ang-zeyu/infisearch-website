We merely tell thus much to account for her position and her partial refinement--both of which conditions she shared with Susan.  \"Now then,\" said the latter, \"I must go, granny.  Stickle and Screw are not the men to overlook faults.  If I'm a single minute late I shall have to pay for it.\"  \"And quite right, Susy, quite right.  Why should Stickle and Screw lose a minute of their people's work?  Their people would be angry enough if they were to be paid a penny short of their wages!  Besides, the firm employs over two hundred hands, and if every one of these was to be late a minute there would be two hundred minutes gone--nigh four hours, isn't it?  You should be able to count that right off, Susy, havin' been so long at the Board-school.\"  \"I don't dispute it, granny,\" said the girl with a light laugh, as she stood in front of a triangular bit of looking-glass tying on her poor but neatly made hat.  \"And I am usually three or four minutes before my time, but Stickle and Screw are hard on us in other ways, so different from Samson and Son, where Lily Hewat goes.  Now, I'm off.  I'll be sure to be back by half-past nine or soon after.\"  As the girl spoke, footsteps were heard ascending the creaky wooden stair.  Another moment and Tommy Splint entering with a theatrical air, announced--  \"A wisitor!\"  He was closely followed by Sam Blake, who no sooner beheld Susy than he seemed to become paralysed, for he stood gazing at her as if in eager but helpless amazement.  Susy was a good deal surprised at this, but feeling that if she were to wait for the clearing up of the mystery she would infallibly be late in reaching the shop of the exacting Stickle and Screw, she swept lightly past the seaman with a short laugh, and ran down-stairs.  Without a word of explanation Sam sprang after her, but, although smart enough on the shrouds and ladders of shipboard, he failed to accommodate himself to the stairs of rookeries, and went down, as he afterwards expressed it, \"by the run,\" coming to an anchor at the bottom in a sitting posture.  Of course the lithe and active Susy escaped him, and also escaped being too late by only half a minute.  \"Never mind, she'll be back again between nine and ten o'clock, unless they keep her late,\" said old Liz, after Sam had explained who he was, and found that Susy was indeed his daughter, and chimney-pot Liz the nurse who had tended his wife to her dying day, and afterwards adopted his child.  \"I never was took aback so in all my life,\" said the seaman, sitting down beside the old woman, and drawing a sigh so long that it might have been likened to a moderate breeze.  \"She's the born image o' what her dear mother was when I first met her.  _My_ Susy!  Well, it's not every poor seaman as comes off a long voyage an' finds that he's fallen heir to a property like _that_!\"  \"You may well be proud of her,\" said old Liz, \"and you'll be prouder yet when you come to know her.\"  \"I know it, and I'm proud to shake your hand, mother, an' thankee kindly for takin' such care o' my helpless lassie.  You say she'll be home about ten?\"  \"Yes, if she's not kep' late.  She always comes home about that time. Meanwhile you'll have something to eat.  Tommy, boy, fetch out the loaf and the cheese and the teapot.  You know where to find 'em.  Tommy's an orphan, Cap'n Blake, that I've lately taken in hand.  He's a good boy is Tommy, but rather wild.\"  \"Wot can you expect of a horphing?\" said the boy with a grin, for he had overheard the latter remark, though it was intended only for the visitor's ear.  \"But I say, granny, there ain't no cheese here, 'cept a bit o' rind that even a mouse would scorn to look at.\"  \"Never mind, bring out the loaf, Tommy.\"  \"An' there ain't no use,\" continued the boy, \"o' bringin' out the teapot, 'cause there ain't a grain o' tea nowheres.\"  \"Oh!  I forgot,\" returned old Liz, slightly confused; \"I've just run out o' tea, Cap'n Blake, an' I haven't a copper at _present_ to buy any, but--\"  \"Never mind that old girl; and I ain't quite captain yet, though trendin' in that direction.  You come out along wi' me, Tommy.  I'll soon putt these matters to rights.\"  Old Liz could not have remonstrated even if she had wished to do so, for her impulsive visitor was gone in a moment followed by his extremely willing little friend.  They returned in quarter of an hour.  \"There you are,\" said the seaman, taking the articles one by one from a basket carried by Tommy; \"a big loaf, pound o' butter, ditto tea, three pound o' sugar, six eggs, hunk o' cheese, paper o' salt--forgot the pepper; never mind.\"  \"You've bin an' forgot the sassengers too--but here they are,\" said Tommy, plucking the delectable viands from the bottom of the basket with a look of glee, and laying them on the table.  Chimney-pot Liz did not look surprised; she only smiled and nodded her head approvingly, for she felt that Sam Blake understood the right thing to do and did it.  Soon the celebrated teapot was going the round, full swing, while the air was redolent of fried sausage and cheese mingled with the perfume of roses and mignonette, for this meal, you must know, was eaten in the garden in the afternoon sunshine, while the cooking--done in the attic which opened on the garden--was accomplished by Sam assisted by Tommy.  \"Well, you _air_ a trump,\" said the latter to the former as he sat down, greasy and glowing, beside the seaman at the small table where old Liz presided like a humble duchess.  We need hardly say that the conversation was animated, and that it bore largely on the life-history of the absent Susy.  \"You're quite sure that she'll be here by ten?\" asked the excited father for the fiftieth time that afternoon.  \"Yes, I'm sure of it--unless she's kep' late,\" answered Liz.  But Susy did _not_ return at the usual hour, so her impatient father was forced to conclude that she _had_ been \"kep' late\"--too late.  In his anxiety he resolved to sally forth under the guidance of Tommy Splint to inquire for the missing Susy at the well-known establishment of Stickle and Screw.  Let us anticipate him in that quest.  At the usual hour that night the employes of Stickle and Screw left work and took their several ways home ward.  Susy had the company of her friend Lily Hewat as far as Chancery Lane.  Beyond that point she had to go alone.  Being summer-time, the days were long, and Susy was one of those strong-hearted and strong-nerved creatures who have a tendency to fear nothing.  She had just passed over London Bridge and turned into a labyrinth of small streets on the Surrey side of the river, when a drunken man met her in a darkish and deserted alley through which she had to pass.  The man seized her by the arm.  Susy tried to free herself.  In the struggle that ensued she fell with a loud shriek, and struck her head on the kerb-stone so violently that she was rendered insensible.  Seeing this, the man proceeded to take from her the poor trinkets she had about her, and would have succeeded in robbing her but for the sudden appearance on the scene of a lowland Scot clad in a homespun suit of shepherd's plaid--a strapping ruddy youth of powerful frame, fresh from the braes of Yarrow.    CHAPTER THREE.  A VISITOR FROM THE NORTH.  How that Lowland Scot came to the rescue just in the nick of time is soon told.  \"Mither,\" said he one evening, striding into his father's dwelling--a simple cottage on a moor--and sitting down in front of a bright old woman in a black dress, whose head was adorned with that frilled and baggy affair which is called in Scotland a mutch, \"I'm gawin' to Lun'on.\"  \"Hoots! havers, David.\"  \"It's no' havers, mither.  Times are guid.  We've saved a pickle siller. Faither can spare me for a wee while--sae I'm aff to Lun'on the morn's mornin'.\"  \"An' what for?\" demanded Mrs Laidlaw, letting her hands and the sock on which they were engaged drop on her lap, as she looked inquiringly into the grave countenance of her handsome son.  \"To seek a wife, maybe,\" replied the youth, relaxing into that very slight smile with which grave and stern-featured men sometimes betray the presence of latent fun.  Mrs Laidlaw resumed her sock and needle with no further remark than \"Hoots! ye're haverin',\" for she knew that her son was only jesting in regard to the wife.  Indeed nothing was further from that son's intention or thoughts at the time than marriage, so, allowing the ripple to pass from his naturally grave and earnest countenance, he continued--  \"Ye see, mither, I'm twunty-three noo, an' I _wad_ like to see something o' the warld afore I grow aulder an' settle doon to my wark.  As I said, faither can spare me a while, so I'll jist tak' my fit in my haund an' awa' to see the Great Bawbylon.\"  \"Ye speak o' gaun to see the warld, laddie, as if 'ee was a gentleman.\"  \"Div 'ee think, mother, that the warld was made only for _gentlemen_ to travel in?\" demanded the youth, with the gentlest touch of scorn in his tone.  To this question the good woman made no reply; indeed her stalwart son evidently expected none, for he rose a few minutes later and proceeded to pack up his slender wardrobe in a shoulder-bag of huge size, which, however, was well suited to his own proportions.  Next day David Laidlaw took the road which so many men have taken before him--for good or ill.  But, unlike most of his predecessors, he was borne towards it on the wings of steam, and found himself in Great Babylon early the following morning, with his mother's last caution ringing strangely in his ears.  \"David,\" she had said, \"I ken ye was only jokin', but dinna ye be ower sure o' yersel'.  Although thae English lassies are a kine o' waux dolls, they have a sort o' way wi' them that might be dangerous to lads like you.\"  \"H'm!\"  David had replied, in that short tone of self-sufficiency which"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21737"],["title","The Garret and the Garden; Or, Low Life High Up (#3)"],["body","so much more than the syllable would seem to warrant.  The Scottish youth had neither kith nor kin in London, but he had one friend, an old school companion, who, several years before, had gone to seek his fortune in the great city, and whose address he knew.  To this address he betook himself on the morning of his arrival, but found that his friend had changed his abode.  The whole of that day did David spend in going about.  He was sent from one place to another, in quest of his friend, and made diligent use of his long legs, but without success. Towards evening he was directed to a street on the Surrey side of the Thames, and it was while on his way thither that he chanced to enter the alley where poor Susan was assaulted.  Like most Scotsmen of his class and size David Laidlaw was somewhat leisurely and slow in his movements when not called to vigorous exertion, but when he heard the girl's shriek, and, a moment later, saw her fall, he sprang to her side with one lithe bound, like that of a Bengal tiger, and aimed a blow at her assailant, which, had it taken effect, would have interrupted for some time--if not terminated for ever--that rascal's career.  But the thief, though drunk, was young, strong, and active.  It is also probable that he was a professional pugilist for, instead of attempting to spring back from the blow--which he had not time to do--he merely put his head to one side and let it pass.  At the same instant David received a stinging whack on the right eye, which although it failed to arrest his rush, filled his vision with starry coruscations.  The thief fell back and the Scot tripped over him.  Before he could recover himself the thief was up like an acrobat and gone.  At the same moment two policemen, rushing on the scene in answer to the girl's shriek, seized David by the collar and held him fast.  There was Highland as well as Lowland blood in the veins of young Laidlaw.  This sanguinary mixture is generally believed to possess effervescing properties when stirred.  It probably does.  For one moment the strength of Goliath of Gath seemed to tingle in David's frame, and the vision of two policemen's heads battered together swam before his eyes--but he thought better of it and restrained himself!  \"Tak' yer hands aff me, freens,\" he said, suddenly unclosing his fists and relaxing his brows.  \"Ye'd better see after the puir lassie.  An' dinna fear for me.  I'm no gawn to rin awa'!\"  Perceiving the evident truth of this latter remark, the constables turned their attention to the girl, who was by that time beginning to recover.  \"Where am I?\" asked Susy, gazing into the face of her rescuer with a dazed look.  \"Yer a' right, puir bairn.  See, tak' ha'd o' my airm,\" said the Scot.  \"That's the way, now, take hold of mine,\" said one of the constables in a kindly tone; \"come along--you'll be all right in a minute.  The station is close at hand.\"  Thus supported the girl was led to the nearest police station, where David Laidlaw gave a minute account of what had occurred to the rather suspicious inspector on duty.  While he was talking, Susan, who had been provided with a seat and a glass of water, gazed at him with profound interest.  She had by that time recovered sufficiently to give her account of the affair, and, as there was no reason for further investigation of the matter, she was asked if her home was far off, and a constable was ordered to see her safely there.  \"Ye needna fash,\" said David carelessly, \"I'm gawn that way mysel', an' if the puir lassie has nae objection I'll be glad to--\"  The abrupt stoppage in the youth's speech was caused by his turning to Susy and looking full and attentively in her face, which, now that the colour was restored and the dishevelled hair rearranged, had a very peculiar effect on him.  His mother's idea of a \"waux doll\" instantly recurred to his mind, but the interest and intelligence in Susy's pretty face was very far indeed removed from the vacant imbecility which usually characterises that fancy article of juvenile luxury.  \"Of course if the girl wishes you to see her home,\" said the inspector, \"I have no objection, but I'll send a constable to help you to take care of her.\"  \"Help _me_ to tak' care o' her!\" exclaimed David, whose pride was sorely hurt by the distrust implied in these words; \"man, I could putt her in my pooch an' _you_ alang wi' her.\"  Of this remark Mr Inspector, who had resumed his pen, took no notice whatever, but went on writing while one of the constables prepared to obey his superior's orders.  In his indignation the young Scot resolved to fling out of the office and leave the police to do as they pleased in the matter, but, glancing at Susy as he turned round, he again met the gaze of her soft blue eyes.  \"C'way, lassie, I _wull_ gang wi' ye,\" he said, advancing quickly and offering his arm.  Being weak from the effects of her fall, Susy accepted the offer willingly, and was supported on the other side by a policeman.  In a short time the trio ascended the rookery stair and presented themselves to the party in the garret-garden just as Sam Blake and Tommy Splint were about to leave it.  It is impossible to describe adequately the scene that ensued--the anxiety of the poor seaman to be recognised by his long lost \"babby,\" the curious but not unnatural hesitancy of that \"babby\" to admit that he _was_ her father, though earnestly assured of the fact by chimney-pot Liz; the surprise of David Laidlaw, and even of the policeman, at being suddenly called to witness so interesting a domestic scene, and the gleeful ecstasy of Tommy Splint over the whole affair--flavoured as it was with the smell and memory of recent \"sassengers.\"  When the constable at last bid them good-night and descended the stair, the young Scot turned to go, feeling, with intuitive delicacy, that he was in the way, but once again he met the soft blue eyes of Susy, and hesitated.  \"Hallo, young man!\" cried Sam Blake, on observing his intention, \"you ain't agoin' to leave us--arter saving my gal's life, p'raps--anywise her property.  No, no; you'll stop here all night an'--\"  He paused: \"Well, I do declare I forgot I wasn't aboard my own ship, but--\" again he paused and looked at old Liz.  \"I've no room for any of you in the garret,\" said that uncompromising woman, \"there ain't more than one compartment in it, and that's not too big for me an' Susy; but you're welcome, both of you, to sleep in the garden if you choose.  Tommy sleeps there, under a big box, and a clever sea-farin' man like you could--\"  \"All right, old lady,\" cried the seaman heartily.  \"I'll stop, an' thankee; we'll soon rig up a couple o' bunks.  So you will stop too, young man--by the way, you--you didn't give us your name yet.\"  \"My name is David Laidlaw; but I won't stop, thankee,\" replied the Scot with unexpected decision of manner.  \"Ye see, I've been lookin' a' this day for an auld freen' an' I _must_ find him afore the morn's mornin', if I should seek him a' nicht.  But, but--maybe I'll come an' speer for 'ee in a day or twa--if I may.\"  \"If you mean that you will come and call, Mr Laidlaw,\" said old Liz, \"we will be delighted to see you at any time.  Don't forget the address.\"  \"Nae fear--I'll putt it i' my note-buik,\" said David, drawing a substantial volume from his breast pocket and entering the address--`Mrs Morley, Cherub Court'--therein.  Having shaken hands all round he descended the stair with a firm tread and compressed lips until he came out on the main thoroughfare, when he muttered to himself sternly:  \"Waux dolls, indeed! there's nane o' thae dolls'll git the better o' me. H'm! a bonny wee face, nae doot but what div _I_ care for bonny faces if the hairt's no' richt?\"  \"But suppose that the heart _is_ right?\"  Who could have whispered that question?  David Laidlaw could not stop to inquire, but began to hum--    \"Oh, this is no my ain lassie,   Kind though the lassie be,--\"  In a subdued tone, as he sauntered along the crowded street, which by that time was blazing with gas-light in the shop-windows and oil-lamps on the hucksters' barrows.  The song, however, died on his lips, and he moved slowly along, stopping now and then to observe the busy and to him novel scene, till he reached a comparatively quiet turning, which was dimly lighted by only one lamp. Here he felt a slight twitch at the bag which contained his little all. Like lightning he turned and seized by the wrist a man who had already opened the bag and laid hold of some of its contents.  Grasping the poor wretch by the neck with his other hand he held him in a grip of iron.    CHAPTER FOUR.  DANGERS THREATEN.  The man who had been thus captured by David was one of those wretched forlorn creatures who seem to reach a lower depth of wretchedness and degradation in London than in any other city in the world.  Although young and strongly made he was pale, gaunt and haggard, with a look about the eyes and mouth which denoted the habitual drunkard.  The meanness of his attire is indescribable.  He trembled--whether from the effects of dissipation or fear we cannot say--as his captor led him under the lamp, with a grip on the collar that almost choked him, but when the light fell full on his haggard face a feeling of intense pity induced the Scot to relax his hold.  \"Oh, ye puir meeserable crater!\" he said, but stopped abruptly, for the man made a sudden and desperate effort to escape.  He might as well have struggled in the grasp of a gorilla!  \"Na, na, my man, ye'll no twust yersel' oot o' my grup sae easy! keep quiet noo, an' I'll no hurt 'ee.  What gars ye gang aboot tryin' to steal like that?\"  \"Steal!\" explained the man fiercely, \"what else can I do?  I _must_ live!  I've just come out of prison, and am flung on the world to be kicked about like a dog and starve.  Let me go, or I'll kill you!\"  \"Na, 'ee'll no kill me.  I'm no sae easy killed as 'ee think,\" returned David, again tightening the grasp of his"]]]
