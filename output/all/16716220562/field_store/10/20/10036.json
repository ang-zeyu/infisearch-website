He didn't even wait to get his own rusty coat and tattered hat, which he had left lying on the ground.  Uncle Jerry hadn't been gone long when all the company came jostling up to Nimble. Everybody--except Nimble--was very merry. Amid a good many jokes the company put on their hats and coats, until only Aunt Polly Woodchuck's poke bonnet hung from Nimble's horns.  Then--just for fun--Jimmy Rabbit set the bonnet on Nimble's head and tied its strings under his chin. And Aunt Polly Woodchuck herself laughed hardest of all.  And then all at once something happened. A dog barked. \"It's old dog Spot!\" somebody cried.  Nimble Deer was the first to run. One leap took him out of the evergreen thicket in which he had been standing all the evening. Three leaps more took him over the stone wall.  After that nobody saw him--nor Aunt Polly Woodchuck's bonnet--again that night.  The whole company scattered and vanished like baby grouse surprised in the woods. And when old dog Spot reached the clump of evergreens a few moments later he found nothing to show that there had been a party there--that is, he found nothing except a battered hat and a rusty coat lying on the ground.  Spot sniffed at them. \"Unless I'm mistaken, Uncle Jerry Chuck has forgotten something,\" he murmured. \"No doubt he'll be back here in a little while.\"  So Spot waited and waited there.  But Uncle Jerry Chuck was half a mile away and sound asleep in his underground chamber.  And Nimble Deer was a mile away, over in Cedar Swamp, trying to tear Aunt Polly's bonnet off his head by rubbing his horns against a young cedar."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2162"],["title","Anarchism and Other Essays (#0)"],["body","AND OTHER ESSAYS  Emma Goldman     With Biographic Sketch by Hippolyte Havel     CONTENTS   Biographic Sketch  Preface  Anarchism: What It Really Stands For  Minorities Versus Majorities  The Psychology of Political Violence  Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure  Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty  Francisco Ferrer and The Modern School  The Hypocrisy of Puritanism  The Traffic in Women  Woman Suffrage  The Tragedy of Woman's Emancipation  Marriage and Love  The Drama: A Powerful Disseminator of Radical Thought     EMMA GOLDMAN         Propagandism is not, as some suppose, a \"trade,\" because      nobody will follow a \"trade\" at which you may work with      the industry of a slave and die with the reputation of a      mendicant.

GEORGE JACOB HOLYOAKE.   Among the men and women prominent in the public life of America there are but few whose names are mentioned as often as that of Emma Goldman.  Yet the real Emma Goldman is almost quite unknown.  The sensational press has surrounded her name with so much misrepresentation and slander, it would seem almost a miracle that, in spite of this web of calumny, the truth breaks through and a better appreciation of this much maligned idealist begins to manifest itself.  There is but little consolation in the fact that almost every representative of a new idea has had to struggle and suffer under similar difficulties.  Is it of any avail that a former president of a republic pays homage at Osawatomie to the memory of John Brown?  Or that the president of another republic participates in the unveiling of a statue in honor of Pierre Proudhon, and holds up his life to the French nation as a model worthy of enthusiastic emulation?  Of what avail is all this when, at the same time, the LIVING John Browns and Proudhons are being crucified?  The honor and glory of a Mary Wollstonecraft or of a Louise Michel are not enhanced by the City Fathers of London or Paris naming a street after them--the living generation should be concerned with doing justice to the LIVING Mary Wollstonecrafts and Louise Michels.  Posterity assigns to men like Wendel Phillips and Lloyd Garrison the proper niche of honor in the temple of human emancipation; but it is the duty of their contemporaries to bring them due recognition and appreciation while they live.  The path of the propagandist of social justice is strewn with thorns. The powers of darkness and injustice exert all their might lest a ray of sunshine enter his cheerless life.  Nay, even his comrades in the struggle--indeed, too often his most intimate friends--show but little understanding for the personality of the pioneer.  Envy, sometimes growing to hatred, vanity and jealousy, obstruct his way and fill his heart with sadness.  It requires an inflexible will and tremendous enthusiasm not to lose, under such conditions, all faith in the Cause.  The representative of a revolutionizing idea stands between two fires: on the one hand, the persecution of the existing powers which hold him responsible for all acts resulting from social conditions; and, on the other, the lack of understanding on the part of his own followers who often judge all his activity from a narrow standpoint.  Thus it happens that the agitator stands quite alone in the midst of the multitude surrounding him.  Even his most intimate friends rarely understand how solitary and deserted he feels.  That is the tragedy of the person prominent in the public eye.  The mist in which the name of Emma Goldman has so long been enveloped is gradually beginning to dissipate.  Her energy in the furtherance of such an unpopular idea as Anarchism, her deep earnestness, her courage and abilities, find growing understanding and admiration.  The debt American intellectual growth owes to the revolutionary exiles has never been fully appreciated.  The seed disseminated by them, though so little understood at the time, has brought a rich harvest.  They have at all times held aloft the banner of liberty, thus impregnating the social vitality of the Nation.  But very few have succeeding in preserving their European education and culture while at the same time assimilating themselves with American life. It is difficult for the average man to form an adequate conception what strength, energy, and perseverance are necessary to absorb the unfamiliar language, habits, and customs of a new country, without the loss of one's own personality.  Emma Goldman is one of the few who, while thoroughly preserving their individuality, have become an important factor in the social and intellectual atmosphere of America.  The life she leads is rich in color, full of change and variety.  She has risen to the topmost heights, and she has also tasted the bitter dregs of life.  Emma Goldman was born of Jewish parentage on the 27th day of June, 1869, in the Russian province of Kovno.  Surely these parents never dreamed what unique position their child would some day occupy.  Like all conservative parents they, too, were quite convinced that their daughter would marry a respectable citizen, bear him children, and round out her allotted years surrounded by a flock of grandchildren, a good, religious woman.  As most parents, they had no inkling what a strange, impassioned spirit would take hold of the soul of their child, and carry it to the heights which separate generations in eternal struggle.  They lived in a land and at a time when antagonism between parent and offspring was fated to find its most acute expression, irreconcilable hostility.  In this tremendous struggle between fathers and sons--and especially between parents and daughters--there was no compromise, no weak yielding, no truce.  The spirit of liberty, of progress--an idealism which knew no considerations and recognized no obstacles--drove the young generation out of the parental house and away from the hearth of the home.  Just as this same spirit once drove out the revolutionary breeder of discontent, Jesus, and alienated him from his native traditions.  What role the Jewish race--notwithstanding all anti-semitic calumnies the race of transcendental idealism--played in the struggle of the Old and the New will probably never be appreciated with complete impartiality and clarity.  Only now are we beginning to perceive the tremendous debt we owe to Jewish idealists in the realm of science, art, and literature.  But very little is still known of the important part the sons and daughters of Israel have played in the revolutionary movement and, especially, in that of modern times.  The first years of her childhood Emma Goldman passed in a small, idyllic place in the German-Russian province of Kurland, where her father had charge of the government stage.  At the time Kurland was thoroughly German; even the Russian bureaucracy of that Baltic province was recruited mostly from German JUNKERS.  German fairy tales and stories, rich in the miraculous deeds of the heroic knights of Kurland, wove their spell over the youthful mind.  But the beautiful idyl was of short duration.  Soon the soul of the growing child was overcast by the dark shadows of life.  Already in her tenderest youth the seeds of rebellion and unrelenting hatred of oppression were to be planted in the heart of Emma Goldman.  Early she learned to know the beauty of the State: she saw her father harassed by the Christian CHINOVNIKS and doubly persecuted as petty official and hated Jew.  The brutality of forced conscription ever stood before her eyes: she beheld the young men, often the sole supporter of a large family, brutally dragged to the barracks to lead the miserable life of a soldier.  She heard the weeping of the poor peasant women, and witnessed the shameful scenes of official venality which relieved the rich from military service at the expense of the poor.  She was outraged by the terrible treatment to which the female servants were subjected: maltreated and exploited by their BARINYAS, they fell to the tender mercies of the regimental officers, who regarded them as their natural sexual prey.  The girls, made pregnant by respectable gentlemen and driven out by their mistresses, often found refuge in the Goldman home.  And the little girl, her heart palpitating with sympathy, would abstract coins from the parental drawer to clandestinely press the money into the hands of the unfortunate women.  Thus Emma Goldman's most striking characteristic, her sympathy with the underdog, already became manifest in these early years.  At the age of seven little Emma was sent by her parents to her grandmother at Konigsberg, the city of Emanuel Kant, in Eastern Prussia.  Save for occasional interruptions, she remained there till her 13th birthday.  The first years in these surroundings do not exactly belong to her happiest recollections.  The grandmother, indeed, was very amiable, but the numerous aunts of the household were concerned more with the spirit of practical rather than pure reason, and the categoric imperative was applied all too frequently.  The situation was changed when her parents migrated to Konigsberg, and little Emma was relieved from her role of Cinderella.  She now regularly attended public school and also enjoyed the advantages of private instruction, customary in middle class life; French and music lessons played an important part in the curriculum.  The future interpreter of Ibsen and Shaw was then a little German Gretchen, quite at home in the German atmosphere.  Her special predilections in literature were the sentimental romances of Marlitt; she was a great admirer of the good Queen Louise, whom the bad Napoleon Buonaparte treated with so marked a lack of knightly chivalry.  What might have been her future development had she remained in this milieu?  Fate--or was it economic necessity?--wi"]]]
