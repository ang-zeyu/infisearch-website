With his knife--a stone one--he cut off a little lump of blubber from the seal, and placed that in the opening, so that the stranger might eat on reviving, if so inclined, or let it alone, if so disposed.  Then, turning his face towards the land, he scurried away over the ice like a hunted partridge, or a hairy ball driven before an Arctic breeze.  He made such good use of his short legs that in less than an hour he reached a little hut, which seemed to nestle under the wing of a great cliff in order to avoid destruction by the glittering walls of an impending glacier.  The hut had no proper doorway, but a tunnel-shaped entrance, about three feet high and several feet long.  Falling on his knees, the Eskimo crept into the tunnel and disappeared.  Gaining the inner end of it, he stood up and glared, speechless, at his astonished wife.  She had cause for surprise, for never since their wedding-day had Nuna beheld such an expression on the fat face of her amiable husband.  \"Okiok,\" she said, \"have you seen an evil spirit?\"  \"No,\" he replied.  \"Why, then, do you glare?\"  Of course Nuna spoke in choice Eskimo, which we render into English with as much fidelity to the native idiom as seems consistent with the agreeable narration of our tale.  \"Hoi!\" exclaimed Okiok, in reply to her question, but without ceasing to glare and breathe hard.  \"Has my husband become a walrus, that he can only shout and snort?\" inquired Nuna, with the slightest possible twinkle in her eyes, as she raised herself out of the lamp-smoke, and laid down the stick with which she had been stirring the contents of a stone pot.  Instead of answering the question, Okiok turned to two chubby and staring youths, of about fifteen and sixteen respectively, who were mending spears, and said sharply, \"Norrak, Ermigit, go, harness the dogs.\"  Norrak rose with a bound, and dived into the tunnel.  Ermigit, although willing enough, was not quite so sharp.  As he crawled into the tunnel and was disappearing, his father sent his foot in the same direction, and, having thus intimated the necessity for urgent haste, he turned again to his wife with a somewhat softened expression.  \"Give me food, Nuna.  Little food has passed into me since yesterday at sunrise.  I starve.  When I have eaten, you shall hear words that will make you dream for a moon.  I have seen,\"--he became solemn at this point, and lowered his voice to a whisper as he advanced his head and glared again--\"I have seen a--a--Kablunet!\"  He drew back and gazed at his wife as connoisseurs are wont to do when examining a picture.  And truly Nuna's countenance _was_ a picture-round, fat, comely, oily, also open-mouthed and eyed, with unbounded astonishment depicted thereon; for she thoroughly believed her husband, knowing that he was upright and never told lies.  Her mental condition did not, however, interfere with her duties.  A wooden slab or plate, laden with a mess of broiled meat, soon smoked before her lord.  He quickly seated himself on a raised platform, and had done some justice to it before Nuna recovered the use of her tongue.  \"A Kablunet!\" she exclaimed, almost solemnly.  \"Is he dead?\"  Okiok paused, with a lump of blubber in his fingers close to his mouth.  \"No; he is alive.  At least he was alive when I left him.  If he has not died since, he is alive still.\"  Having uttered this truism, he thrust the blubber well home, and continued his meal.  Nuna's curiosity, having been aroused, was not easily allayed.  She sat down beside her spouse, and plied him with numerous questions, to which Okiok gave her brief and very tantalising replies until he was gorged, when, throwing down the platter, he turned abruptly to his wife, and said impressively--  \"Open your ears, Nuna.  Okiok is no longer what he was.  He has been born only to-day.  He has at last seen with his two eyes--a Kablunet!\"  He paused to restrain his excitement.  His wife clasped her hands and looked at him excitedly, waiting for more.  \"This Kablunet,\" he continued, \"is very white, and not so ruddy as we have been told they are.  His hair is brown, and twists in little circles.  He wears it on the top of his head, and on the bottom of his head also--all round.  He is not small or short.  No; he is long and broad,--but he is thin, very thin, like the young ice at the beginning of winter.  His eyes are the colour of the summer sky.  His nose is like the eagle's beak, but not so long.  His mouth--I know not what his mouth is like; it is hid in a nest of hair.  His words I understand not.  They seem to me nonsense, but his voice is soft and deep.\"  \"And his dress--how does he dress?\" asked Nuna, with natural feminine curiosity.  \"Like ourselves,\" replied Okiok, with a touch of disappointment in his tone.  \"The men who said the Kablunets wear strange things on their heads and long flapping things on their legs told lies.\"  \"Why did you not bring him here?\" asked Nuna, after a few moments' meditation on these marvels.  \"Because he is too heavy to lift, and too weak to walk.  He has been starving.  I wrapped him in the skin of a bear, and left him with a piece of blubber at his nose.  When he wakes up he will smell; then he will eat.  Perhaps he will live; perhaps he will die.  Who can tell?  I go to fetch him.\"  As the Eskimo spoke, the yelping of dogs outside told that his sons had obeyed his commands, and got ready the sledge.  Without another word he crept out of the hut and jumped on the sledge, which was covered with two or three warm bearskins.  Ermigit restrained the dogs, of which there were about eight, each fastened to the vehicle by a single line. Norrak handed his father the short-handled but heavy, long-lashed whip.  Okiok looked at Norrak as he grasped the instrument of punishment.  \"Jump on,\" he said.  Norrak did so with evident good-will.  The whip flashed in the air with a serpentine swing, and went off like a pistol.  The dogs yelled in alarm, and, springing away at full speed, were soon lost among the hummocks of the Arctic sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A RESCUE AND A HAPPY FAMILY.  While the Eskimos were thus rushing to his rescue, poor Red Rooney-- whose shipmates, we may explain at once, had thus contracted his Christian name of Reginald--began to recover from his swoon, and to wonder in a listless fashion where he was.  Feeling comparatively comfortable in his bear-skin, he did not at first care to press the inquiry; but, as Okiok had anticipated, the peculiar smell near his nose tended to arouse him.  Drawing his hand gently up, he touched the object in front of his mouth.  It felt very like blubber, with which substance he was familiar.  Extending his tongue, he found that it also tasted like blubber.  To a starving man this was enough.  He pulled the end of the raw morsel into his mouth and began to chew.  Ah, reader, turn not up your refined nose!  When you have been for several months on short allowance, when you have scraped every shred of meat off the very last bones of your provisions, and sucked out the last drop of marrow, and then roasted and eaten your spare boots, you may perhaps be in a position to estimate and enjoy a morsel of raw blubber.  Regardless of time, place, and circumstance, our poor wanderer continued to chew until in his great weakness he fell into a sort of half slumber, and dreamed--dreamed of feasting on viands more delightful than the waking imagination of man has ever conceived.  From this state of bliss he was rudely awakened by a roughish poke in the back.  The poke was accompanied by a snuffing sound which caused the blood of the poor man to curdle.  Could it be a bear?  He was not left long in doubt.  After giving him another poke on the shoulder, the creature walked round him, snuffing as it went, and, on reaching the air-hole already referred to, thrust its snout in and snorted.  Rooney turned his face aside to avoid the blast, but otherwise lay quite still, knowing well that whatever animal his visitor might be, his only hope lay in absolute inaction.  Venturing in a few seconds to turn his face round and peep through the opening, he found that the animal was in very deed a large white bear, which, having found and abstracted the remains of the blubber he had been chewing, was at that moment licking its lips after swallowing it.  Of course, finding the morsel satisfactory, the bear returned to the hole for more.  It is easier to conceive than to describe the poor man's feelings at that moment, therefore we leave the reader to conceive them.  The natural and desperate tendency to spring up and defend himself had to be combated by the certain knowledge that, encased as he was, he could not spring up, and had nothing wherewith to defend himself except his fingers, which were no match for the claws of a Polar bear.  The blood which a moment before had begun apparently to curdle, now seemed turned into liquid fire; and when the snout again entered and touched his own, he could contain himself no longer, but gave vent to a yell, which caused the startled bear to draw sharply back in alarm. Probably it had never heard a yell through the medium of its nose before, and every one must know how strong is the influence of a new sensation.  For some minutes the monster stood in silent contemplation of the mysterious hole.  Rooney of course lay perfectly still.  The success of his involuntary explosion encouraged hope.  What the bear might have done next we cannot tell, for at that moment a shout was heard.  It was followed by what seemed a succession of pistol shots and the howling of dogs.  It was the arrival of Okiok on the scene with his sledge and team.  Never was an arrival more opportune.  The bear looked round with a distinct expression of indignation on his countenance.  Possibly the voice of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21696"],["title","Red Rooney: The Last of the Crew (#2)"],["body","was familiar to him.  It may be that relations or friends of that bear had mysteriously disappeared after the sounding of that voice.  Perhaps the animal in whose skin Rooney was encased had been a brother.  At all events, the increasing hullabaloo of the approaching Eskimo had the effect of intimidating the animal, for it retired quickly, though with evident sulkiness, from the scene.  A few seconds more, and Okiok dashed up, leaped from his vehicle, left the panting team to the control of Norrak, and ran eagerly to the prostrate figure.  Unwrapping the head so as to set it free, the Eskimo saw with intense satisfaction that the Kablunet was still alive.  He called at once to Norrak, who fetched from the sledge a platter made of a seal's shoulder-blade, on which was a mass of cooked food.  This he presented to the starving man, who, with a look of intense gratitude, but with no words, eagerly ate it up.  The Eskimo and his son meanwhile stood looking at him with an expression of mingled interest, awe, and surprise on their round faces.  When the meal was ended, Red Rooney, heaving a deep sigh of satisfaction, said, \"Thank God, and thank _you_, my friends!\"  There was reason for the increase of surprise with which this was received by the two natives, for this time the foreigner spoke to them in their own language.  \"Is the Kablunet a messenger from heaven,\" asked Okiok, with increased solemnity, \"that he speaks with the tongue of the Innuit?\"  \"No, my friend,\" replied Rooney, with a faint smile; \"I bring no message either from heaven or anywhere else.  I'm only a wrecked seaman.  But, after a fashion, you are messengers from heaven to _me_, and the message you bring is that I'm not to die just yet.  If it had not been for you, my friends, it strikes me I should have been dead by this time.  As to my speaking your lingo, it's no mystery.  I've learned it by livin' a long time wi' the traders in the south of Greenland, and I suppose I've got a sort o' talent that way; d'ye see?\"  Red Rooney delivered these remarks fluently in a curious sort of Eskimo language; but we have rendered it into that kind of English which the wrecked seaman was in the habit of using--chiefly because by so doing we shall give the reader a more correct idea of the character of the man.  \"We are very glad to see you,\" returned Okiok.  \"We have heard of you for many moons.  We have wished for you very hard.  Now you have come, we will treat you well.\"  \"Are your huts far off?\" asked the seaman anxiously.  \"Not far.  They are close to the ice-mountain--on the land.\"  \"Take me to them, then, like a good fellow, for I'm dead-beat, and stand much in need of rest.\"  The poor man was so helpless that he could not walk to the sledge when they unrolled him.  It seemed as if his power of will and energy had collapsed at the very moment of his rescue.  Up to that time the fear of death had urged him on, but now, feeling that he was, comparatively speaking, safe, he gave way to the languor which had so long oppressed him, and thus, the impulse of the will being removed, he suddenly became as helpless as an infant.  Seeing his condition, the father and son lifted him on the sledge, wrapped him in skins, and drove back to the huts at full speed.  Nuna was awaiting them outside, with eager eyes and beating heart, for the discovery of a real live Kablunet was to her an object of as solemn and anxious curiosity as the finding of a veritable living ghost might be to a civilised man.  But Nuna was not alone.  There were two other members of the household present, who had been absent when Okiok first arrived, and whom we will now introduce to the reader.  One was Nuna's only daughter, an exceedingly pretty girl--according to Eskimo notions of female beauty.  She was seventeen years of age, black-eyed, healthily-complexioned, round-faced, sweet-expressioned, comfortably stout, and unusually graceful--for an Eskimo.  Among her other charms, modesty and good-nature shone conspicuous.  She was in all respects a superior counterpart of her mother, and her name was Nunaga. Nuna was small, Nunaga was smaller.  Nuna was comparatively young, Nunaga was necessarily younger.  The former was kind, the latter was kinder.  The mother was graceful and pretty, the daughter was more graceful and prettier.  Nuna wore her hair gathered on the top of her head into a high top-knot, Nunaga wore a higher top-knot.  In regard to costume, Nuna wore sealskin boots the whole length of her legs--which were not long--and a frock or skirt reaching nearly to her knees, with a short tail in front and a long tail behind; Nunaga, being similarly clothed, had a shorter tail in front and a longer tail behind.  It may be interesting to note here that Eskimos are sometimes named because of qualities possessed, or appearance, or peculiar circumstances connected with them.  The word Nuna signifies \"land\" in Eskimo.  We cannot tell why this particular lady was named Land, unless it were that she was born on the land, and not on the ice; or perhaps because she was so nice that when any man came into her company he might have thought that he had reached the land of his hopes, and was disposed to settle down there and remain.  Certainly many of the Eskimo young men seemed to be of that mind until Okiok carried her off in triumph.  And let us tell you, reader, that a good and pretty woman is as much esteemed among the Eskimos as among ourselves.  We do not say that she is better treated; neither do we hint that she is sometimes treated worse.  The Eskimo word Nunaga signifies \"_my_ land,\" and was bestowed by Okiok on his eldest-born in a flood of tenderness at her birth.  Apologising for this philological digression, we proceed.  Besides Nuna and Nunaga there was a baby boy--a fat, oily, contented boy--without a name at that time, and without a particle of clothing of any sort, his proper condition of heat being maintained when out of doors chiefly by being carried between his mother's dress and her shoulders; also by being stuffed to repletion with blubber.  The whole family cried out vigorously with delight, in various keys, when the team came yelping home with the Kablunet.  Even the baby gave a joyous crow--in Eskimo.  But the exclamations were changed to pity when the Kablunet was assisted to rise, and staggered feebly towards the hut, even when supported by Okiok and his sons.  The sailor was not ignorant of Eskimo ways.  His residence in South Greenland had taught him many things.  He dropped, therefore, quite naturally--indeed gladly--on his hands and knees on coming to the mouth of the tunnel, and crept slowly into the hut, followed by the whole family, except Ermigit, who was left to unfasten the dogs.  The weather at the time was by no means cold, for spring was rapidly advancing; nevertheless, to one who had been so reduced in strength, the warmth of the Eskimo hut was inexpressibly grateful.  With a great sigh of relief the rescued man flung himself on the raised part of the floor on which Eskimos are wont to sit and sleep.  \"Thank God, and again I thank _you_, my friends!\" he said, repeating the phrase which he had already used, for the sudden change from despair to hope, from all but death to restored life, had filled his heart with gratitude.  \"You are weary?\" said Okiok.  \"Ay, ay--very weary; well-nigh to death,\" he replied.  \"Will the Kablunet sleep?\" asked Nuna, pointing to a couch of skins close behind the seaman.  Rooney looked round.  \"Thankee; yes, I will.\"  He crept to the couch, and dropped upon it, with his head resting on an eider-down pillow.  Like a tired infant, his eyes closed, and he was asleep almost instantaneously.  Seeing this, the Eskimos began to move about with care, and to speak in whispers, though it was needless caution, for in his condition the man would probably have continued to sleep through the wildest thunderstorm. Even when baby, tumbling headlong off the elevated floor, narrowly missed spiking himself on a walrus spear, and set up a yell that might have startled the stone deaf, the wearied Kablunet did not move.  Okiok did, however.  He moved smartly towards the infant, caught him by the throat, and almost strangled him in a fierce attempt to keep him quiet.  \"Stupid tumbler!\" he growled--referring to the child's general and awkward habit of falling--\"Can't you shut your mouth?\"  Curious similarity between the thoughts and words of civilised and savage man in similar circumstances!  And it is interesting to note the truth of what the song says:--  \"We little know what great things from little things may rise.\"  From that slight incident the Eskimo child derived his future name of \"Tumbler\"!  We forget what the precise Eskimo term is, but the English equivalent will do as well.  When supper-time arrived that night, Okiok and Nuna consulted as to whether they should waken their guest, or let him lie still--for, from the instant he lay down, he had remained without the slightest motion, save the slow, regular heaving of his broad chest.  \"Let him sleep.  He is tired,\" said Okiok.  \"But he must be hungry, and he is weak,\" said Nuna.  \"He can feed when he wakens,\" returned the man, admiring his guest as a collector might admire a foreign curiosity which he had just found.  \"Kablunets sleep sounder than Eskimos,\" remarked the woman.  \"Stupid one!  Your head is thick, like the skull of the walrus,\" said the man.  \"Don't you see that it is because he is worn-out?\"  Eskimos are singularly simple and straightforward in their speech.  They express their opinions with the utmost candour, and without the slightest intention of hurting each other's feelings.  Nuna took no offence at her husband's plain speaking, but continued to gaze with a gratified expression at the stranger.  And sooth to say Reginald Rooney was a pleasant object for contemplation, as well as a striking contrast to the men with whom Nuna had been hitherto associated.  His brow was broad;"]]]
