Then there arose a gale which quieted the machine a little, and checked the sparkling flow of wit and humour.  When, during the course of the gale, a toppling billow overbalanced itself and fell inboard with a crash that nearly split the deck open, sweeping two of the quarterboats away, Mr Blurt, sitting in the saloon, was heard to exclaim:--  \"'Pon my word, it's a terrible gale--enough almost to make a fellow think of his sins.\"  To which Mrs Tods, who sat beside him, replied, with a serious shake of her head, that it was indeed a very solemn occasion, and cast a look, not of undying hate but of gentle appeal at Mrs Pods, who sat opposite to her.  And that lady, so far from resenting the look as an affront, met her in a liberal spirit; not only admitted that what Mrs Tods had said was equally just and true, but even turned her eyes upward with a look of resignation.  Well was it for Mrs Pods that she did so, for her resigned eyes beheld the globe of the cabin lamp pitched off its perch by a violent lurch and coming straight at her.  Thus she had time to bow to circumstances, and allow the missile to pass over her head into the bosom of Lady Tower, where it was broken to atoms.  The effect of mutual concession was so strong on Mrs Pods and Mrs Tods, that the former secretly repented having wished that one of Mrs Tods' little sons might fall down the hatchway and get maimed for life, while the latter silently regretted having hoped that one of Mrs Pods' little girls might fall overboard and be half-drowned.  But the storm passed away and the effervescence returned--though not, it is pleasing to add, with so much pungency as before.  Thus, night and day, the steamer sped on over the southern seas, across the mystic line, and into the northern hemisphere, with the written records, hopes, commands, and wishes of a continent in the mail-bags in her hold, and leaving a beautiful milky-way behind her.  But there were more than letters and papers in these mail-bags.  There were diamonds!  Not indeed those polished and glittering gems whose proper resting-place is the brow of beauty, but those uncut pebbles that are turned up at the mines, which the ignorant would fling away or give to their children as playthings, but for which merchants and experts would give hundreds and thousands of pounds.  A splendid prize that Royal Mail steamer would have been for the buccaneers of the olden time, but happily there are no buccaneers in these days--at least not in civilised waters.  A famous pirate had, however, set his heart on those diamonds--even old Neptune himself.  This is how it happened.    CHAPTER FIVE.  WRECK AND RESCUE.  One evening Miss Gentle and rotund little Mr Blurt were seated on two camp-stools near the stern, conversing occasionally and gazing in a dreamy frame of mind at the milky-way over which they appeared to travel.  \"I wonder much, Miss Gentle,\" said Mr Blurt, \"that you were not more afraid during that gale we had just before crossing the line?\"  \"I was a good deal afraid, though perhaps I did not show it.  Your remark,\" she added, with an arch glance at her companion, \"induces me to express some surprise that you seemed so much afraid.\"  \"Afraid!\" echoed Mr Blurt, with a smile; \"why, I wasn't afraid--eh! was I?\"  \"I beg pardon,\" hastily explained Miss Gentle, \"I don't mean frightened, of course; perhaps I should have said alarmed, or agitated--\"  \"Agitated!\" cried Mr Blurt, pulling off his hat, and rubbing his bald head--he was prematurely bald, being only forty, though he looked like fifty--\"agitated!  Well, Miss Gentle, if you had diamonds--\"  He stopped short, and looked at his companion with a confused smile.  \"Diamonds, Mr Blurt,\" said Miss Gentle, slightly surprised; \"what do you mean?\"  \"Well--ha! hem!\" said the other, rubbing his forehead; \"I see no reason why I should make a mystery of it.  Since I have mentioned the thing, I may as well say that a man who happens to have a packet of diamonds in the mail-bags worth about twenty thousand pounds, may well be excused showing some little agitation lest the ship containing them should go to the bottom.\"  \"I don't quite see that,\" returned Miss Gentle.  \"If the owner is on board, and goes to the bottom with his diamonds, it does not matter to _him_, does it?\"  \"Ah!\" said Mr Blurt, \"it is the inconsiderateness of youth which prompts that speech.  (Miss Gentle looked about twenty, though she was in reality twenty-seven!)  Do you think I have no anxiety for any one but myself?  Suppose I have a wife and family in England who are dependent on these diamonds.\"  \"Ah! that did not occur to me,\" returned the lady.  \"Have you any objection to become a confidante?\" asked Mr Blurt.  \"None whatever,\" replied Miss Gentle, laughing.  \"Well, then, to let you understand my feelings, I shall explain.  I have a brother--a dear little fellow like mys--ah, excuse me; I did not mean _dear_ like myself, but _little_.  Well, he is a naturalist.  He lives in London, and is not a very successful naturalist; indeed, I may say that he is an unfortunate and poor naturalist.  Last year he failed.  I sent him a small sum of money.  He failed again.  I sent him more money. Being a successful diamond-merchant, you see, I could afford to do so. We are both bachelors; my brother being much older than I am.  At last I resolved to send home my whole fortune, and return to live with him, after winding up my affairs.  I did so: made up my diamonds into a parcel, and sent it by mail as being the most secure method.  Just after doing this, I got a letter informing me of my brother being dangerously ill, and begging me to come to England without delay.  I packed up at once, left my partner to wind up the business, and so, here I am, on board the very steamer that carries my diamonds to England.\"  \"How curious--and how interesting,\" said the sympathetic Miss Gentle.  Whatever more she intended to say was checked by a large parti-coloured ball hitting her on the cheek, and falling into her lap.  It was followed up and captured with a shriek by the two little Todses and the three little Podses.  At the same moment the gong sounded for tea.  Thus the conversation came to a close.  The voyage of the _Trident_--with the exception of the gale before referred to--was prosperous until her arrival in the waters of the northern hemisphere.  By that time the passengers had crystallised into groups, the nobodies and self-forgetting-bodies fraternised, and became more and more friendly as time went on.  The uproarious-bodies got up concerts and charades.  The hatred of Pods for Tods intensified.  The arrogance of Major Beak, and the good-natured modesty of Mr Bright, increased.  The noise of Dr Bassoon made the manner of Mr Silky quite agreeable by contrast, while the pride of Lady Tower and Mr Stiff formed a fine, deep-shade to the neutral tint of Miss Gentle, and the high-light of Miss Squeaker.  Gradually, however, feelings began to modify.  The squalls and breezes that ruffled the human breasts on board the _Trident_ moderated in exact proportion as that vessel penetrated and experienced the storms of what should have been named the _in_-temperate zone.  At last they drew near to the shores of Old England, and then there burst upon them a nor-wester, so violent that within the first hour the close-reefed topsails were blown to ribbons, and the foretopmast, with the jib-boom, was carried away.  Of course this was a comparatively small matter in a steamer, but when it was afterwards discovered that the vessel had sprung a leak, things began to look more serious.  \"It's only a trifle, Miss Gentle; don't alarm yourself.  We can put that to rights in a few minutes,\" said Major Beak, with the confident air of a man whose nautical education had begun with Noah, and continued uninterruptedly down to the present time.  \"He's a hooked-nosed humbug, Miss Gentle, an' knows nothing about it,\" growled the captain.  \"Water rising rapidly in the hold, sir,\" said the carpenter, coming aft and touching his cap.  \"Rig the pumps,\" said the captain, and the pumps were rigged.  What is more to the purpose, they were wrought with a will by the crew; but in spite of their efforts the water continued to rise.  It might have done a student of human nature good to have observed the effect of this information on the passengers.  Regarded as a whole the little world became perceptibly paler in the cheeks, and strikingly moderate in tone of voice and manner.  Major Beak, in particular, began to talk low, and made no reference whatever to nautical matters, while Mrs Pods looked amiably--almost affectionately--at Mrs Tods.  Of course the passengers observed with breathless interest the action of the captain at this crisis.  That important personage did his best to stop the leak, but only succeeded in checking it, and it required the constant exertions of the crew night and day at the pumps to reduce the water in the hold even by an inch.  In these circumstances the young men among the passengers readily volunteered their services to assist the crew.  The gale continued and steadily increased.  At night the ladies, and such of the passengers as were not employed at the pumps, retired to the cabin.  Some of those who did not realise the danger of the situation went to bed.  Others sat up in the saloon and consoled each other as best they might.  Morning came, but with it came no abatement of the storm.  Water and sky seemed mingled together, and were of one uniform tone.  It was obvious that the men at the pumps were utterly exhausted, and worst of all the water was beginning to gain slowly on them.  The elderly men were now called on to help.  It became necessary that all should work for their lives.  Miss Bluestocking, who was muscular as well as masculine, rose to the occasion, and suggested that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21693"],["title","Post Haste (#5)"],["body"," ladies, so to speak, should man the pumps.  Her suggestion was not acted on.  At this point Mr Bright, who had been toiling night and day like an inexhaustible giant, suggested that music might be called in to aid their flagging powers.  It was well known that fatigued soldiers on a march are greatly re-invigorated by the band.  Major Beak, soaking from head to foot with salt water, almost blind with fatigue and want of sleep, and with the perspiration dropping from the point of his enormous nose, plucked up heart to raise himself and assert that that was true. He further suggested that Colonel Blare might play to them on the cornet.  But Colonel Blare was incapable by that time of playing even on a penny trumpet.  Dr Bassoon was reduced so low as to be obliged to half whisper his incapacity to sing bass, and as for the great tenor, Lieutenant Limp--a piece of tape was stiffer than his backbone.  \"Let the ladies sing to us,\" sighed Mr Fiery, who was mere milk and water by that time.  \"I'm sure that Mrs Tods and Mrs Pods would be--\"  A united shriek of protest from those ladies checked him.  \"Or Miss Troolove,\" suggested Mr Blurt, on whose stout person the labour told severely.  The lady appealed to, after a little hesitation, began a hymn, but the time was found to be too slow, while the voice, although sweet and true, was too weak.  \"Come, let us have one of the `Christy Minstrels',\" cried Mr Bright in a lively tone.  \"I'm certain Miss Mist can sing one.\"  Poor Miss Mist was almost hysterical with fear and prolonged anxiety, but she was an obliging creature.  On being assured that the other ladies would support her, she struck up the \"Land of Dixey,\" and was joined in the chorus with so much spirit that those who laboured at the pumps felt like giants refreshed.  Explain it how we may, there can be no question that lively music has a wonderful power of sustaining the energies of mankind.  With the return of cheerful sensations there revived in some of them the sense of the ludicrous, and it was all that they could do to refrain from laughter as they looked at the forlorn females huddled together, wrapped in rugs and cloaks, drenched to the skin, almost blown from their seats, ghastly with watching and fear, solemn-visaged in the last degree, and yet singing \"Pop goes the weasel,\" and similar ditties, with all the energy of despair.  We paint no fanciful picture.  We describe facts, and there is no saying how far the effect of that music might have helped in the saving of the ship, had not an event occurred which rendered further efforts unnecessary.  The captain, who had either lost his reckoning or his head, or both, was seen to apply himself too frequently to a case-bottle in the cabin, and much anxiety began to be felt as to his capacity to manage the vessel. Owing, also, to the length of time that thick weather had prevailed, no reliable observation had been obtained for several days.  While the anxiety was at its height, there came a sudden and terrible shock, which caused the good ship to tremble.  Then, for the first time, the roar of breakers was heard above the howling of the storm.  As if to increase the horror of the scene, the fog lifted and revealed towering cliffs close ahead of them.  The transition from a comparatively hopeful state to one of absolute despair was overwhelming.  The wild waves lifted the great hull of the vessel and let it down on the rocks with another crash, sending the masts over the side, while the passengers could only shriek in agony and cling to the wreck.  Fortunately, in taking the ground, the vessel had kept straight, so that the forepart formed a comparative shelter from the waves that were fast breaking up the stern.  In the midst of all this confusion the first mate and Mr Bright seemed to keep quite cool.  Between them they loaded and fired the bow signal-guns several times, by which means they brought a few fishermen and coastguard-men to the scene of disaster.  And among these, as we have seen, were our heroes, Philip Maylands and George Aspel.  On arriving, these two found that the rocket apparatus was being set up on the beach.  \"Phil,\" said Aspel in a quick low voice, \"they'll want the lifeboat, and the wind carries the sound of their guns in the wrong direction.  Run round, lad, and give the alarm.  There's not a moment to lose.\"  The boy turned to run without a word of reply, but he could not help observing, as he turned, the compressed lips, the expanding nostrils, and the blazing eyes of his friend, who almost quivered with suppressed excitement.  For some time George Aspel stood beside the men of the coastguard while they set up their apparatus and fired the rocket.  To offer assistance, he knew, would only retard them.  The first rocket was carried to the right of the vessel, which was now clearly visible.  The second went to the other side.  There was a reef of rocks on that side which lay a few yards farther out from the beach than the wreck.  Over this reef the rocket-line fell and got entangled.  Part of the shore-end of the apparatus also broke down.  While the men were quickly repairing it Aspel said in a hurried manner:--\"I'll clear the rocket-line,\" and away he darted like a greyhound.  \"Hold ha-a-rd! foolish fellow, you'll be drownded,\" roared one of the men.  But Aspel heeded him not.  Another minute and he was far away on the ledge of rock jutting out from a high cape--the point of which formed the outlying reef above referred to.  He was soon at the extremity of the ledge beyond which nearly a hundred yards of seething foam heaved between him and the reef.  In he plunged without a moment's halt.  Going with the rush of the waves through the channel he struck diagonally across, and landed on the reef.  Every billow swept over it, but not with sufficient force to prevent his struggling towards the rocket-line, which he eventually reached and cleared.  \"Wasn't that nately done!\" cried an enthusiastic young fisherman on the beach; \"but, och! what is he up to now?\"  A few seconds sufficed to give an answer to his question.  Instead of letting go the line and returning, young Aspel tied it round his waist, and ran or waded to the extreme edge of the reef which was nearest to the wreck.  The vessel lay partially to leeward of him now, with not much space between, but that space was a very whirlpool of tormented waves.  Aspel gave no moment to thought.  In his then state of mind he would have jumped down the throat of a cannon.  Next instant he was battling with the billows, and soon reached the ship; but now his danger was greatest, for the curling waves threw him so violently against the side of the wreck that he almost lost consciousness and missed the lifebuoy which, with a rope attached, had been thrown to him by the anxious crew.  A great cry of anxiety arose at this, but Mr Bright had anticipated it, and the first mate was ready to aid him.  Leaping into the sea with a rope round his waist, Mr Bright caught Aspel as he struggled past.  The mate's powerful hands held them both fast.  Some of the crew lent a ready hand, and in a few seconds George Aspel was hauled on board.  He had quite recovered by that time, and replied with a smile to the ringing cheer that greeted him.  The cheer was echoed again and again by the men on shore.  Major Beak attempted to grasp his hand, but failed. Mr Blurt, feeling an irresistible impulse, tried to embrace him, but was thrust aside, fell, and rolled into the lee-scuppers.  Scattering the people aside Aspel sprang on the bulwarks at the bow, and, snatching Mr Stiff's travelling-cap from his head, held it up as a signal to the men on shore.  Well did the youth know what to do in the circumstances, for many a time had he talked it over with the men of the coastguard in former days.  On receiving an answering signal from the shore he began to haul on the rocket-line.  The men in charge had fastened to it a block, or pulley, with two tails to it; a line was rove through this block.  The instant the block reached his hands Aspel sprang with it to the stump of the foremast, and looking round cried, \"Who'll lend a--\"  \"Here you are,\" said Mr Bright, embracing the mast with both arms and stooping,--for Mr Bright also knew well what to do.  George Aspel leaped on his shoulders and stood up.  Mr Bright then raised himself steadily, and thus the former was enabled to tie the block by its two tails to the mast at a height of about eleven feet. The line rove through the block was the \"whip,\" which was to be manipulated by those on shore.  It was a double, and, of course, an endless line.  Again the signal was given as before, and the line began to run.  Very soon a stout hawser or cable was seen coming out to the wreck.  Aspel fastened the end of this to the mast several feet below the pulley.  A third time the signal was given.  \"Now then, ladies, stand by to go ashore, and let's have no hesitation. It's life or death with us all,\" said the mate in a voice so stern that the crowd of anxious and somewhat surprised females prepared to obey.  Presently a ring-shaped lifebuoy, with something like a pair of short breeches dangling from it, came out from the shore, suspended to a block which traversed on the cable, and was hauled out by means of the whip.  A seaman was ordered to get into it.  Mrs Tods, who stood beside the mate, eyeing the process somewhat curiously, felt herself firmly but gently seized.  \"Come, Mrs Tods, step into it.  He'll take care of you--no fear.\"  \"Never! never! without my two darlings,\" shrieked Mrs Tods.  But Mrs Tods was tenderly lifted over the side and placed in the powerful arms of the sailor.  Her sons instantly set up a howl and rushed towards her.  But Mr Bright had anticipated this also, and, with the aid of a seaman, arrested them.  Meanwhile, the signal having been given, the men on the land pulled in the cradle, and Mrs Tods went shrieking over the hissing billows to the shore.  A few"]]]
