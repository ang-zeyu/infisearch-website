Vol. 2 (#8)"],["body","of conference upon differences between the two Houses, which was cheerfully granted by the House. On the 2d of March, Mr. Holmes, of Massachusetts, as chairman, made the following report:       \"1. The Senate should give up the combination of Missouri in the      same bill with Maine.       \"2. The House should abandon the attempt to restrict Slavery in      Missouri.       \"3. Both Houses should agree to pass the Senate's separate      Missouri bill, with Mr. Thomas's restriction or compromising      proviso, excluding Slavery from all territory north and west of      Missouri.       \"The report having been read,       \"The first and most important question was put, viz.:       \"Will the House concur with the Senate in so much of the said      amendments as proposes to strike from the fourth section of the      [Missouri] bill the provision prohibiting Slavery or involuntary      servitude in the contemplated State, otherwise than in the      punishment of crimes?\"  The vote resulted as follows: For giving up restriction on Missouri, yeas, 90; against giving up restriction of slavery in Missouri, 87.  Mr. Taylor, of New York, offered an amendment to include Arkansas Territory under the prohibition of slavery in the territory west and north of Missouri, but his amendment was cut off by a call for the previous question. Then the House concurred in the Senate amendment excluding forever slavery from the territory west and north of Missouri by a vote of 134 to 42! And on the following day the bill admitting Maine into the Union was passed without opposition.  Thus the Northern delegates in Congress were whipped into line, and thus did the South gain her point in the extension of slavery in violation of the sacred compact between the States contained in the ordinance of 1787.  But the struggle was opened afresh when Missouri presented herself for admission on the 16th of November, 1820. The constitution of this new State, adopted by her people on the 19th of July, 1820, contained the following resolutions which greatly angered the Northern members, who so keenly felt the defeat and humiliation they had Suffered so recently:       \"The General Assembly shall have no power to pass laws, first,      for the emancipation of Slaves without the consent of their      owners, or without paying them, before such emancipation, a full      equivalent for such slaves so emancipated; and second: to prevent      _bona-fide_ emigrants to this State, or actual settlers therein,      from bringing from any of the United States, or from any of their      Territories, such persons as may there be deemed to be Slaves, so      long as any persons of the same description are allowed to be      held as Slaves by the laws of this State.       ... \"It shall be their duty, as soon as may be, to pass such laws      as may be necessary,       \"First, to prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to, and      settling in, this State, under any pretext whatever.\"  Upon the motion to admit the State the vote stood: yeas, 79, nays, 93. Upon a second attempt to admit her, with the understanding that the resolution just quoted should be expunged the vote was worse than before, standing: yeas, 6; nays, 146!  The House now rested, until a joint resolve, admitting her with but a vague and ineffective qualification, came down from the Senate, where it was passed by a vote of 26 to 18--six Senators from Free States in the affirmative. Mr. Clay, who had resigned in the recess, and been succeeded, as Speaker, by John W. Taylor, of New York, now appeared as the leader of the Missouri admissionists, and proposed terms of compromise, which were twice voted down by the Northern members, aided by John Randolph and three others from the South, who would have Missouri admitted without condition or qualification. At last, Mr. Clay proposed a joint committee on this subject, to be chosen by ballot--which the House agreed to by a vote of 101 to 55; and Mr. Clay became its chairman. By this committee it was agreed, that a solemn pledge should be required of the Legislature of Missouri, that the constitution of that State should not be construed to authorize the passage of any act, and that no act should be passed \"by which any of the citizens of either of the States should be excluded from the enjoyment of the privileges and immunities to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States.\" The joint resolution, amended by the addition of this proviso, passed the House by 86 yeas to 82 nays; the Senate concurred (Feb. 27, 1821) by 26 yeas to 15 nays--(all Northern but Macon, of N. C.). Missouri complied with the condition, and became an accepted member of the Union. Thus closed the last stage of the fierce Missouri controversy, which for a time seemed to threaten--as so many other controversies have harmlessly threatened--the existence of the Union.  By this time there was scarcely a State in the North but that had organized anti-slavery, or abolition, societies. Pennsylvania boasted of a society that was accomplishing a great Work. Where it was impossible to secure freedom for the enslaved, religious training was imparted, and many excellent efforts made for the amelioration of the condition of the Negroes, bond and free. A society for promoting the \"_Abolition of Slavery_\" was formed at Trenton, New Jersey, on the 2d of March, 1786. It adopted an elaborate constitution, which was amended on the 26th of November, 1788. It did an effective work throughout the State; embraced in its membership some of the ablest men of the State; and changed public sentiment for the better by the methods it adopted and the literature it circulated. On the 15th of February, 1804, it secured the passage of the following Act for the gradual emancipation of the slaves in the State:       \"AN ACT FOR THE GRADUAL ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.       \"SECTION 1. _Be it enacted by the Council and General Assembly of      this State, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the      same_, That every child born of a slave within this State, after      the fourth day of July next, shall be free; but shall remain the      servant of the owner of his or her mother, and the executors,      administrators, or assigns of such owner, in the same manner as      if such child had been bound to service by the trustees or      overseers of the poor, and shall continue in such service, if a      male, until the age of twenty-five years, and if a female, until      the age of twenty-one years.       \"2. _And be it enacted_, That every person being an inhabitant of      this State, who shall be entitled to the service of a child born      as aforesaid, after the said fourth day of July next, shall      within nine months after the birth of such child, cause to be      delivered to the clerk of the county whereof such person shall be      an inhabitant, a certificate in writing, containing the name and      station of such person, and the name, age, and sex of the child      so born; which certificate, whether the same be delivered before      or after the said nine months, shall be by the said clerk      recorded in a book to be by him provided for that purpose; and      such record thereof shall be good evidence of the age of such      child; and the clerk of such county shall receive from said      person twelve cents for every child so registered; and if any      person shall neglect to deliver such certificate to the said      clerk within said nine months, such person shall forfeit and pay      for every such offence, five dollars, and the further sum of one      dollar for every month such person shall neglect to deliver the      same, to be sued for and recovered by any person who will sue for      the same, the one half to the use of such prosecutor, and the      residue to the use of the poor of the township in which such      delinquent shall reside.       \"3. _And be it enacted_, That the person entitled to the service      of any child born as aforesaid, may, nevertheless, within one      year after the birth of such child, elect to abandon such right;      in which case a notification of such abandonment, under the hand      of such person, shall be filed with the clerk of the township, or      where there may be a county poor-house established, then with the      clerk of the board of trustees of said poor-house of the county      in which such person shall reside; but every child so abandoned      shall be maintained by such person until such child arrives to      the age of one year, and thereafter shall be considered as a      pauper of such township or county, and liable to be bound out by      the trustees or overseers of the poor in the same manner as other      poor children are directed to be bound out, until, if a male, the      age of twenty-five, and if a female, the age of twenty-one; and      such child, while such pauper, until it shall be bound out, shall      be maintained by the trustees or overseers of the poor of such      county or township, as the case may be, at the expense of this      State; and for that purpose the director of the board of chosen      freeholders of the county is hereby required, from time to time,      to draw his warrant on the treasurer in favor of such trustees or      overseers for the amount of such expense, not exceeding the rate      of three dollars per month; provided the accounts for the same be      first certified and approved by such board of trustees, or the      town committee of such township; and every person who shall omit      to notify such abandonment as aforesaid, shall be considered as      having elected to retain the service of such child, and be liable      for its maintenance until the period to which its servitude is      limited as aforesaid.       \"A.

TO  THE LOYAL WOMEN OF AMERICA,   WHOSE PATRIOTIC CONTRIBUTIONS, TOILS AND SACRIFICES, ENABLED THEIR SISTERS, WHOSE HISTORY IS HERE RECORDED, TO MINISTER RELIEF AND CONSOLATION TO OUR WOUNDED AND SUFFERING HEROES;  AND WHO BY THEIR DEVOTION, THEIR LABORS, AND THEIR PATIENT ENDURANCE OF PRIVATION AND DISTRESS OF BODY AND SPIRIT, WHEN CALLED TO GIVE UP THEIR BELOVED ONES FOR THE  NATION'S DEFENSE,  HAVE WON FOR THEMSELVES ETERNAL HONOR, AND THE UNDYING REMEMBRANCE OF THE PATRIOTS OF ALL TIME,  WE DEDICATE THIS VOLUME.     PREFACE.   The preparation of this work, or rather the collection of material for it, was commenced in the autumn of 1863. While engaged in the compilation of a little book on \"The Philanthropic Results of the War\" for circulation abroad, in the summer of that year, the writer became so deeply impressed with the extraordinary sacrifices and devotion of loyal women, in the national cause, that he determined to make a record of them for the honor of his country. A voluminous correspondence then commenced and continued to the present time, soon demonstrated how general were the acts of patriotic devotion, and an extensive tour, undertaken the following summer, to obtain by personal observation and intercourse with these heroic women, a more clear and comprehensive idea of what they had done and were doing, only served to increase his admiration for their zeal, patience, and self-denying effort.  Meantime the war still continued, and the collisions between Grant and Lee, in the East, and Sherman and Johnston, in the South, the fierce campaign between Thomas and Hood in Tennessee, Sheridan's annihilating defeats of Early in the valley of the Shenandoah, and Wilson's magnificent expedition in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia, as well as the mixed naval and military victories at Mobile and Wilmington, were fruitful in wounds, sickness, and death. Never had the gentle and patient ministrations of woman been so needful as in the last year of the war; and never had they been so abundantly bestowed, and with such zeal and self-forgetfulness.  From Andersonville, and Millen, from Charleston, and Florence, from Salisbury, and Wilmington, from Belle Isle, and Libby Prison, came also, in these later months of the war, thousands of our bravest and noblest heroes, captured by the rebels, the feeble remnant of the tens of thousands imprisoned there, a majority of whom had perished of cold, nakedness, starvation, and disease, in those charnel houses, victims of the fiendish malignity of the rebel leaders. These poor fellows, starved to the last degree of emaciation, crippled and dying from frost and gangrene, many of them idiotic from their sufferings, or with the fierce fever of typhus, more deadly than sword or minié bullet, raging in their veins, were brought to Annapolis and to Wilmington, and unmindful of the deadly infection, gentle and tender women ministered to them as faithfully and lovingly, as if they were their own brothers. Ever and anon, in these works of mercy, one of these fair ministrants died a martyr to her faithfulness, asking, often only, to be buried beside her \"boys,\" but the work never ceased while there was a soldier to be nursed. Nor were these the only fields in which noble service was rendered to humanity by the women of our time. In the larger associations of our cities, day after day, and year after year, women served in summer's heat and winter's cold, at their desks, corresponding with auxiliary aid societies, taking account of goods received for sanitary supplies, re-packing and shipping them to the points where they were needed, inditing and sending out circulars appealing for aid, in work more prosaic but equally needful and patriotic with that performed in the hospitals; and throughout every village and hamlet in the country, women were toiling, contriving, submitting to privation, performing unusual and severe labors, all for the soldiers. In the general hospitals of the cities and larger towns, the labors of the special diet kitchen, and of the hospital nurse were performed steadily, faithfully, and uncomplainingly, though there also, ever and anon, some fair toiler laid down her life in the service. There were many too in still other fields of labor, who showed their love for their country; the faithful women who, in the Philadelphia Refreshment Saloons, fed the hungry soldier on his way to or from the battle-field, till in the aggregate, they had dispensed nearly eight hundred thousand meals, and had cared for thousands of sick and wounded; the matrons of the Soldiers' Homes, Lodges, and Rests; the heroic souls who devoted themselves to the noble work of raising a nation of bondmen to intelligence and freedom; those who attempted the still more hopeless task of rousing the blunted intellect and cultivating the moral nature of the degraded and abject poor whites; and those who in circumstances of the greatest peril, manifested their fearless and undying attachment to their country and its flag; all these were entitled to a place in such a record. What wonder, then, that, pursuing his self-appointed task assiduously, the writer found it growing upon him; till the question came, not, who should be inscribed in this roll, but who could be omitted, since it was evident no single volume could do justice to all.  In the autumn of 1865, Mrs. Mary C. Vaughan, a skilful and practiced writer, whose tastes and sympathies led her to take an interest in the work, became associated with the writer in its preparation, and to her zeal in collecting, and skill in arranging the materials obtained, many of the interesting sketches of the volume are due. We have in the prosecution of our work been constantly embarrassed, by the reluctance of some who deserved a prominent place, to suffer anything to be communicated concerning their labors; by the promises, often repeated but never fulfilled, of others to furnish facts and incidents which they alone could supply, and by the forwardness of a few, whose services were of the least moment, in presenting their claims.  We have endeavored to exercise a wise and careful discrimination both in avoiding the introduction of any name unworthy of a place in such a record, and in giving the due meed of honor to those who have wrought most earnestly and acceptably. We cannot hope that we have been completely successful; the letters even now, daily received, render it probable that there are some, as faithful and self-sacrificing as any of those whose services we have recorded, of whom we have failed to obtain information; and that some of those who entered upon their work of mercy in the closing campaigns of the war, by their zeal and earnestness, have won the right to a place. We have not, knowingly, however, omitted the name of any faithful worker, of whom we could obtain information, and we feel assured that our record is far more full and complete, than any other which has been, or is likely to be prepared, and that the number of prominent and active laborers in the national cause who have escaped our notice is comparatively small.  We take pleasure in acknowledging our obligations to Rev. Dr. Bellows, President of the United States Sanitary Commission, for many services and much valuable information; to Honorable James E. Yeatman, the President of the Western Sanitary Commission, to Rev. J. G. Forman, late Secretary of that Commission, and now Secretary of the Unitarian Association, and his accomplished wife, both of whom were indefatigable in their efforts to obtain facts relative to western ladies; to Rev. N. M. Mann, now of Kenosha, Wisconsin, but formerly Chaplain and Agent of the Western Sanitary Commission, at Vicksburg; to Professor J. S. Newberry, now of Columbia College, but through the war the able Secretary of the Western Department of the United States Sanitary Commission; to Mrs. M. A. Livermore, of Chicago, one of the managers of the Northwestern Sanitary Commission; to Rev. G. S. F. Savage, Secretary of the Western Department of the American Tract Society, Boston; Rev. William De Loss Love, of Milwaukee, author of a work on \"Wisconsin in the War,\" Samuel B. Fales, Esq., of Philadelphia, so long and nobly identified with the Volunteer Refreshment Saloon, Dr. A. N.
