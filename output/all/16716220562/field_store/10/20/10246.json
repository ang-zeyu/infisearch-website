Then there's the--But what's your hurry?\" said the seaman, as Miles rose.  \"It's getting late now, friend.  If I'm to find another lodging I must be off.  Doubtless, I'll find some respectable house to take me in for the night.\"  Miles suppressed a yawn as he put on his cap.  \"I don't believe you will,\" returned Molloy, also rising, and giving full vent to a sympathetic and vociferous yawn.  \"Hows'ever, w'en a young feller insists on havin' his way, it's best to give him plenty of cable and let him swing.  He's sure to find out his mistake by experience.  But look ye here, Miles, I've took a fancy to you, an' I'd be sorry to think you was in difficulties.  If,\" he continued, thrusting a hand into his breeches-pocket, and bringing up therefrom a mass of mixed gold, silver, and copper--\"if you don't objec' to accep' of a loan of--\"  \"Thank you--no, my friend.  It is very kind of you,\" said Miles quickly; \"but I have quite enough for present necessities.  So good-night.\"  \"All right,\" returned the sailor, thrusting the money back into his pocket.  \"But if you should ever want a jaw with Jack Molloy while you're in this here port you've only got to hail him at the _Sailors' Welcome_, an' if he should happen to be out, they always can tell you where he's cruisin'.  Good-night, an' luck go wi' ye!\"  Another tremendous yawn finished the speech, and next moment Miles found himself in the street, oppressed with a strange and miserable sensation which he had never before experienced.  Indeed, he had to lean against the house for a few minutes after coming out into the fresh air, and felt as if the power of connected thought was leaving him.  He was aroused from this condition by the flashing of a light in his eyes.  Opening them wide, he beheld a policeman looking at him earnestly.  \"Now, then, young fellow,\" said the guardian of the night; \"d'you think you can take care of yourself?\"  \"Oh! yes, quite well.  It's only a giddy feeling that came over me.  I'm all right,\" said Miles, rousing himself and passing on.  He staggered slightly, however, and a short \"Humph!\" from the policeman showed that he believed the youth to be something more than giddy.  Ashamed to be even unjustly supposed to be intoxicated, Miles hurried away, wondering very much what could be the matter with him, for he had not tasted a drop of strong drink, except the half-glass of beer he had swallowed before Molloy chanced to knock it out of his hand.  Suddenly he remembered that the sailor had said the beer was drugged.  If he could have asked the barman who had served him, that worthy could have told him that this was true; that the whole glassful, if swallowed, would, ere long, have rendered him insensible, and that what he had already taken was enough to do him considerable damage.  As he walked onward, he became rapidly worse; the people and the streets seemed to swim before him; an intense desire to sleep overpowered every other feeling, and at last, turning into a dark entry, he lay down and pillowed his head on a door-step.  Here he was found by a policeman; a stretcher was fetched, and he was conveyed to the station as \"drunk and incapable!\"  When brought before the Inspector the following morning, shame and reckless despair were the tenants of his breast.  Those tenants were not expelled, but rather confirmed in possession, when the Inspector--after numerous questions, to which Miles returned vague unsatisfactory replies--adopted the role of the faithful friend, and gave him a great deal of paternal advice, especially with reference to the avoidance of strong drink and bad companions.  Miles had the wisdom, however, to conceal his feelings, and to take the reproof and advice in good part.  Afterwards, on being set free, he met a recruiting sergeant, who, regarding him as a suitable subject for the service of her Majesty, immediately laid siege to him.  In his then state of mind the siege was an easy one.  In short, he capitulated at once and entered the Queen's service, under the name of John Miles.  We need scarcely say that his heart misgave him, that his conscience condemned him, and that, do what he would, he could not shut out the fact that his taking so hasty and irrevocable a step was a poor return for all the care and anxiety of his parents in years gone by.  But, as we have said, or hinted, Miles was one of those youths who, when they have once made up their minds to a certain course of action, fancy that they are bound to pursue it to the end.  Hence it was that he gave his name as John Miles instead of Miles Milton, so that he might baffle any inquiries as to what had become of him.  Once enlisted, he soon began to realise the fact that he was no longer a free agent--at least not in the sense in which he had been so up to that period of his life.  Constant drill was the order of the day for some weeks; for there was a demand for more troops for Egypt at the time, and regiments were being made up to their full strength as fast as possible.  During this period Miles saw little of his companions in arms personally, save that group of recruits who were being \"licked into shape\" along with him.  At first he was disappointed with these, for most of them were shy, unlettered men; some, raw lads from the country; and others, men who seemed to have been loafers before joining, and were by no means attractive.  The drill-sergeant, however, was a good, though stern man, and soon recognised the differences in character, aptitude, and willingness among his raw recruits.  This man, whose name was Hardy, made a powerful impression on our hero from the first; there was something so quiet and even gentle about him, in spite of his firm and inflexible demands in regard to the matters of drill and duty.  To please this man, Miles gave himself heart and soul to his work, and was soon so efficient as to be allowed to join the regiment.  And here he found, to his surprise and satisfaction, that the sergeant and young soldier with whom he had travelled to Portsmouth, were members of the company to which he was attached.  As we have said, Miles had taken a great fancy at first sight to the young private, whose name was William Armstrong.  Our hero was of an affectionate disposition, and would have allowed his warm feelings to expend themselves on a dog rather than have denied them free play.  No wonder, then, that he was attracted by the handsome manly countenance and deferential manner of Armstrong, who, although an uneducated youth, and reared in the lower ranks of life, was gifted with those qualities of the true gentleman which mere social position can neither bestow nor take away.  His intellect also was of that active and vigorous fibre which cannot be entirely repressed by the want of scholastic training.  The affection was mutual, for the contrasts and similarities of the two men were alike calculated to draw them together.  Both were tall, broad, square-shouldered, erect, and soldierly, yet, withal, modest as well in demeanour as in feeling, and so exactly like to each other in size and figure, and in the quiet gravity of their expressions, that they might well have been taken for twin brothers.  When, in uniform, the two strode along the streets of Portsmouth, people were apt to turn and look at them, and think, no doubt, that with many such men in the British army it would go hard with the foes of Old England!  The bond of union was still further strengthened by the fact that, while the comparatively learned Miles was enthusiastic and communicative, the unlettered Armstrong was inquisitive and receptive, fond of prying into the nature of things, and always ready as well as competent to discuss-- not merely to _argue_.  Observe the distinction, good reader. Discussion means the shaking of any subject into its component parts with a desire to understand it.  Argument has come very much to signify the enravelment of any subject with a view to the confusion and conquest of an opponent.  Both young men abhorred the latter and liked the former.  Hence much of their harmony and friendship.  \"Will you come with me up town?\" said Armstrong to Miles one day, as he was about to quit the barrack-room.  \"I'm going to see if there's any news of my Emmy.\"  \"I did not know you expected her,\" said Miles.  \"Come along, I'm ready.\"  \"I don't expect her yet,\" returned Armstrong, as they left the barracks; \"I only look for a letter, because it was on Wednesday that I wrote telling her of my going to Egypt, and she can scarce have had time to get ready to come down, poor girl!  In fact I am going to engage a room for her.  By the way, I heard this morning that there's to be another draft for Egypt, so you'll have a chance to go.\"  \"I'm rejoiced to hear it,\" returned Miles; \"for, to say the truth, I had been growing envious of your good fortune in being ordered on active service.\"  \"Hooroo, Armstrong, where away now?\" cried an unmistakably Irish voice, as a smart little soldier crossed the street to them, and was introduced to Miles as Corporal Flynn, belonging to another company in his own regiment.  \"My blissin' on ye, Miles.  John, is it?\"  \"Yes, John,\" replied our hero, much amused at the free-and-easy address of the little corporal.  \"Well, John Miles,\" he said, \"I don't know whether ye'll laugh or cry whin I tell ye that you'll likely be warned this evenin' for the draft that's goin' to Aigypt.\"  \"I certainly won't cry,\" returned Miles, with a laugh.  Yet the news brought a sudden feeling into his breast which was strongly allied to the opposite of laughter, for the thought of parting from father and mother without bidding them farewell fell upon his spirit with crushing weight;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21719"],["title","Blue Lights: Hot Work in the Soudan (#6)"],["body","t, like too many men who know they are about to do wrong, Miles hardened his heart with the delusive argument that, having fairly taken the step, it was impossible for him now to retrace it.  He knew-- at least he thought--that there was still the possibility of being bought off, and that his stern father would only be too glad to help him.  He also knew that at least he had time to write and let them know his circumstances, so that they might run down to Portsmouth and bid him good-bye; but he had taken the bit in his teeth, and now he resolved to abide the consequences.  Turning from his companions while they conversed, he looked into a shop-window.  \"Your chum's in the blues,\" said the lively corporal, in a lower voice.  \"Young fellows are often in that state after joining, ain't they?\" returned Armstrong.  \"True for ye--an' more shame to them, whin they ought to be as proud as paycocks at wearin' her gracious Majesty's uniform.  But good luck to 'ee!  I must be off, for I'm bound for Aigypt mesilf.\"  \"I am glad that I shall have the chance of seeing your wife, for I've been much interested in her since your friend Sergeant Gilroy told me about her,\" said Miles, as they resumed their walk.  \"Surely it is hard of them to refuse to let her go with the regiment.\"  \"Well, it _is_ hard,\" returned the young soldier; \"but after all I cannot find fault with the powers that be, for I married with my eyes open.  I knew the rule that those who marry without leave must leave their wives at home, for only a certain number of families can go abroad with a regiment--and that only in peace-time.\"  \"It might have been well,\" continued Armstrong, slowly, while a sad expression clouded his face for a few moments, \"if I had waited, and many a time has my conscience smitten me for my haste.  But what could I do?  Emmy most unaccountably fell in love wi' me--_thank God_! for I do think that the greatest earthly blessing that can be given to mortal man is the love of a gentle, true-hearted girl.  The wealth of the Indies cannot purchase that, and nothing else in life can supply the want of it.  Can you wonder that I grasped the treasure when within my reach?\"  \"I certainly cannot; and as certainly I do not blame you,\" returned the sympathetic Miles.  \"Of course I fell in love with Emmy,\" continued the soldier, with a slightly confused look.  \"I could no more help that than I could help growing up.  Could I?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said Miles.  \"Well, you see,\" continued his friend, \"as the affair was arranged in heaven, according to general belief, what was I that I should resist? You see, Emmy's father, who's a well-to-do farmer, was willing, and we never gave a thought to Egypt or the war at the time.  She will be well looked after while I'm away, and I'll send her every penny of my pay that I can spare, but--\"  He stopped abruptly, and Miles, respecting his feelings, remarked, by way of changing the subject, that, the pay of a private soldier being so small, very little could be saved out of that.  \"Not much,\" assented his comrade; \"but, little as it is, we can increase it in various ways.  For one thing, I have given up smoking.  That will save a little; though, to say truth, I have never expended much on baccy.  Then I have joined Miss Robinson's Temperance Band--\"  \"Strange how often that lady's name has been in my ears since I came to Portsmouth!\" said Miles.  \"Not so strange after all,\" returned Armstrong, \"when one reflects that she has been the means of almost changing the character of the town within the last few years--as far at least as concerns the condition of soldiers, as well as many of the poorer classes among its inhabitants-- so Sergeant Gilroy tells me.\"  As some of the information given by Sergeant Gilroy to the young soldier may be interesting to many readers, we quote a few of his own words.  \"Why, some years ago,\" he said, \"the soldiers' wives, mothers, and sisters who came down here to see the poor fellows set sail for foreign parts, found it almost impossible to obtain lodgings, except in drinking-houses which no respectable woman could enter.  Some poor women even preferred to spend a winter night under railway arches, or some such shelter, rather than enter these places.  And soldiers out of barracks had nowhere else to go to for amusement, while sailors on leave had to spend their nights in them or walk the streets.  Now all that is changed.  The Soldiers' Institute supplies 140 beds, and furnishes board and lodging to our sisters and wives at the lowest possible rates, besides reception-rooms where we can meet our friends; a splendid reading-room, where we find newspapers and magazines, and can write our letters, if we like, in peace and quiet; a bar where tea and coffee, bread and butter, buns, etcetera, can be had at all reasonable hours for a mere trifle; a coffee and smoking room, opening out of which are two billiard-rooms, and beyond these a garden, where we can get on the flat roof of a house and watch the arrival and departure of shipping.  There is a small charge to billiard-players, which pays all expenses of the tables, so that not a penny of the Institute funds is spent on the games.  Of course no gambling is allowed in any of Miss Robinson's Institutes.  Then there are Bible-class rooms, and women's work-rooms, and a lending library, and bathrooms, and a great hall, big enough to hold a thousand people, where there are held temperance meetings, lectures with dissolving views, entertainments, and `tea-fights,' and Sunday services.  No wonder that, with such an agency at work for the glory of God and the good of men, Portsmouth is almost a new place. Indeed, although Miss Robinson met with powerful opposition at first from the powers that be, her Institute is now heartily recognised and encouraged in every way at the Horse Guards.  Indeed, it has recently been visited by the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge, and highly approved of by these and other grandees.\"  While the two soldiers were chatting about the past and present of the Institute they arrived at its door.  \"Here we are.  Come into the reception-room, Miles, while I make inquiry about my letters.\"  They entered the house as he spoke.  The reception-room is on the right of the passage.  Armstrong opened the door and looked in, but, instead of advancing, he stood transfixed, gazing before him open-mouthed as though he had seen a spectre, for there, in front of the fire, sat a beautiful, refined-looking girl, with golden hair and blue eyes, gazing pensively at the flickering flames.  Miles was not kept long in suspense as to who she was.  \"Emmy!\"  \"Oh, Willie!\"  These were exclamations which would have revealed all in a moment, even though Emmy had not sprung up and rushed into Willie's open arms.  How she ever emerged from the embrace of those arms with unbroken bones is a mystery which cannot be solved, but she did emerge in safety, and with some confusion on observing that Miles had witnessed the incident with admiring gaze!  \"Never mind him, Emmy,\" said the young soldier, laughing; \"he's a good friend, a comrade.  Shake hands with him.\"  The action, and the ease of manner with which Emmy obeyed, proved that grace and small hands are not altogether dependent on rank or station.  \"Excuse me,\" said Miles, after a few words of salutation; \"I'll go and have a look at the library.\"  So saying he quitted the room, leaving the young couple alone; for there chanced to be no other visitors to the reception-room at the time.  In the lobby he found several soldiers and a couple of sailors enjoying coffee at the bar, and was about to join them when a man came forward whose dress was that of a civilian, though his bearing proclaimed him a soldier.  \"Hallo, Brown,\" exclaimed one of the soldiers, \"d'ye know that a troop-ship has just come in!\"  \"Know it? of course I do; you may trust the people of this house to be first in hearing such news.\"  \"Mr Tufnell told me of it.  I'm just going down to the jetty to boil the kettle for them.\"  As he spoke, two ladies of the Institute descended the broad staircase, each with a basket on her arm.  They entered into conversation for a few minutes with the soldiers at the bar, and it was abundantly evident to Miles, from the kindly tone of the former and the respectful air of the latter, that they were familiar acquaintances, and on the best of terms.  \"Are you all ready, Brown?\" asked one of the ladies of the soldier-like civilian, whom we have already mentioned.  \"All ready, Miss; a man has already gone to order the bread and butter and light the fire.  I hear the vessel is crowded, so we may expect a full house to-night.\"  Miles pricked up his ears on hearing this, and when Brown went out, leaving the two ladies to finish their conversation with the soldiers, he followed him.  \"Pardon me,\" he said, on overtaking the man.  \"Did I understand correctly that a troop-ship has just arrived?\"  \"Right,\" said Brown.  \"I am just going down to the embarkation jetty to get coffee ready for the men.  You seem to have joined but a short time, apparently, for though I am familiar with your uniform I have not seen yourself before.\"  \"True, it is not long since I joined, and this is my first visit to the Institute.\"  \"I hope it won't be the last, friend,\" returned Brown heartily.  \"Every soldier is welcome there, and, for the matter of that, so is every sailor and marine.\"  \"I have heard as much.  May I accompany you to this jetty to see the troops arrive, and this coffee business that you speak of?\"  \"You may, and welcome,\" said Brown, leading his companion through the town in the direction of the docks, and chatting, as they walked along, about the army and navy; about his own experiences in the former; and about the condition of soldiers at the present time as contrasted with that of the days gone by.
