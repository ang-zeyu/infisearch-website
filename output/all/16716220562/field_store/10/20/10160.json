She wore no ornament of any kind, and the slight shoes that covered her small feet were perfectly plain.  In short, there was a modest simplicity about the girl's whole aspect and demeanour which greatly interested the Englishman, inducing him to murmur to himself, \"What an uncommonly pretty girl she would be if she were only white!\"  The colour of her skin was, indeed, unusually dark, but that fact did not interfere with the classic delicacy of her features, or the natural sweetness of her expression.  The order of progress in narrow places was such that Manuela rode behind Pedro and in front of Lawrence, Quashy bringing up the rear.  In more open places the young Englishman used occasionally to ride up abreast of Manuela and endeavour to engage her in conversation.  He was, to say truth, very much the reverse of what is styled a lady's man, and had all his life felt rather shy and awkward in female society, but being a sociable, kindly fellow, he felt it incumbent on him to do what in him lay to lighten the tedium of the long journey to one who, he thought, must naturally feel very lonely with no companions but men.  \"Besides,\" he whispered to himself, \"she is only an Indian, and of course cannot construe my attentions to mean anything so ridiculous as love-making-- so, I will speak to her in a fatherly sort of way.\"  Filled with this idea, as the party came out upon a wide and beautiful table-land, which seemed like a giant emerald set in a circlet of grand blue mountains, Lawrence pushed up alongside, and said--  \"Poor girl, I fear that such prolonged riding over these rugged passes must fatigue you.\"  Manuela raised her dark eyes to the youth's face, and, with a smile that was very slight--though not so slight but that it revealed a double row of bright little teeth--she replied softly--  \"W'at you say?\"  \"Oh!  I forgot, you don't speak English.  How stupid I am!\" said Lawrence with a blush, for he was too young to act the \"fatherly\" part well.  He felt exceedingly awkward, but, observing that the girl's eyes were again fixed pensively on the ground, he hoped that she had not noticed the blush, and attempted to repeat the phrase in Spanish.  What he said it is not possible to set down in that tongue, nor can we gratify the reader with a translation.  Whatever it was, Manuela replied by again raising her dark eyes for a moment--this time without a smile--and shaking her head.  Poor Lawrence felt more awkward than ever.  In despair he half thought of making trial of Latin or Greek, when Pedro came opportunely to the rescue.  Looking back he began--  \"Senhor Armstrong--\"  \"I think,\" interrupted the youth, \"that you may dispense with `Senhor.'\"  \"Nay, I like to use it,\" returned the guide.  \"It reminds me so forcibly of the time when I addressed your good old father thus.\"  \"Well, Senhor Pedro, call me what you please.  What were you about to say?\"  \"Only that we are now approaching one of the dangerous passes of the mountains, where baggage-mules sometimes touch the cliffs with their packs, and so get tilted over the precipices.  But our mules are quiet, and with ordinary care we have nothing to fear.\"  The gorge in the mountains, which the travellers soon afterwards entered, fully justified the guide's expression \"dangerous.\"  It was a wild, rugged glen, high up on one side of which the narrow pathway wound--in some places rounding a cliff or projecting boulder, which rendered the passage of the baggage-mules extremely difficult.  Indeed, one of the mules did slightly graze a rock with its burden; and, although naturally sure-footed, was so far thrown off its balance as to be within a hair's-breadth of tumbling over the edge and being dashed to pieces on the rocks below, where a turbulent river rushed tumultuously at the bottom of the glen.  One of the snow-clad peaks of the higher Andes lay right before them. One or two guanacos--animals of the lama species--gazed at them from the other side of the gorge, and several ill-omened vultures wheeled in the sky above, as if anticipating a catastrophe which would furnish them with a glorious meal.  \"A most suitable place for the depredations of banditti, or fellows like Conrad of the Mountains, I should think,\" said Lawrence.  \"Bandits are sometimes met with here,\" returned Pedro, quietly.  \"And what if we should meet with such in a place where there is scarcely room to fight?\"  \"Why then,\" returned the guide, with a slight curl of his moustache, \"we should have to try who could fight best in the smallest space.\"  \"Not a pleasant prospect in the circumstances,\" said Lawrence, thinking of Manuela.  For some time they rode together in silence; but Quashy, who had overheard, the conversation, and was of a remarkably combative disposition, though the reverse of bad-tempered or quarrelsome, could not refrain from asking--  \"W'y de Guv'mint not hab lots ob sojers an' pleece in de mountains to squash de raskils?\"  \"Because Government has enough to do to squash the rascals nearer home, Quashy,\" answered Pedro.  \"Have a care, the track gets rather steep here.\"  He glanced over his shoulder at the Indian girl as he spoke.  She was riding behind with an air of perfect ease and self-possession.  \"Fall to the rear, Quashy,\" said Pedro.  The black obeyed at once, and a minute later they turned the corner of a jutting rock, which had hitherto shut out from view the lower part of the gorge and the track they were following.  The sight that met their view was calculated to try the strongest nerves, for there, not a hundred paces in advance, and coming towards them, were ten of the most villainous-looking cut-throats that could be imagined, all mounted, and heavily armed with carbine, sword, and pistol.  Taken completely by surprise, the bandits--for such Pedro knew them to be--pulled up.  Not so our guide.  It was one of the peculiarities and strong points of Pedro's character that he was never taken by surprise, or uncertain what to do.  Instantly he drew his sword with one hand, a pistol with the other, and, driving his spurs deep into his mule, dashed down the steep road at the banditti.  In the very act he looked back, and, in a voice that caused the echoes of the gorge to ring, shouted in Spanish--  \"Come on, comrades! here they are at last! close up!\"  A yell of the most fiendish excitement and surprise from Quashy--who was only just coming into view--assisted the deception.  If anything was wanting to complete the effect, it was the galvanic upheaval of Lawrence's long arms and the tremendous flourish of his longer legs, as he vaulted over his mule's head, left it scornfully behind, uttered a roar worthy of an African lion, and rushed forward on foot.  He grasped his great cudgel, for sword and pistol had been utterly forgotten!  Like a human avalanche they descended on the foe.  That foe did not await the onset.  Panic-stricken they turned and went helter-skelter down the pass--all except two, who seemed made of sterner stuff than their fellows, and hesitated.  One of these Pedro rode fairly down, and sent, horse and all, over the precipice.  Lawrence's cudgel beat down the guard of the other, flattened his sombrero, and stopping only at his skull, stretched him on the ground.  As for those who had fled, the appalling yells of Quashy, as he pursued them, scattered to the winds any fag-ends of courage they might have possessed, and effectually prevented their return.  So tremendous and sudden was the result, that Manuela felt more inclined to laugh than cry, though naturally a good deal frightened.  Lawrence and Pedro were standing in consultation over the fallen bandit when the negro came back panting from the chase.  \"Da's wan good job dooed, anyhow,\" he said.  \"What's you be do wid _him_?\"  \"What would you recommend?\" asked Pedro.  The negro pointed significantly to the precipice, but the guide shook his head.  \"No, I cannot kill in cold blood, though I have no doubt he richly deserves it.  We'll bind his hands and leave him.  It may be weakness on my part, but we can't take him on, you know.\"  While Pedro was in the act of binding the robber, a wild shriek, as of some one in terrible agony, startled them.  Looking cautiously over the precipice, where the sound seemed to come from, they saw that the man whom Pedro had ridden down was hanging over the abyss by the boughs of a small shrub.  His steed lay mangled on the rocks of the river bank at the bottom.  There was an agonised expression in the man's countenance which would have touched a heart much less soft than that of Lawrence Armstrong.  Evidently the man's power of holding on was nearly exhausted, and he could not repress a shriek at the prospect of the terrible death which seemed so imminent.  Being a practised mountaineer, Lawrence at once, without thought of personal danger, and moved only by pity, slipped over the crags, and, descending on one or two slight projections, the stability of which even a Swiss goat might have questioned, reached the bush.  A look of fierce and deadly hate was on the robber's face, for, judging of others by himself, he thought, no doubt, that his enemy meant to hasten his destruction.  \"Here, catch hold--I'll save you!\" cried Lawrence, extending his strong right hand.  A glance of surprise told that he was understood.  The bandit let go the hold of one of his hands and made a convulsive grasp at his rescuer. Their fingers touched, but at the same moment the branch gave way, and, with a cry of wild despair, the wretched man went headlong down.  Not, however, to destruction.  The effort he had made threw him slightly to one side of the line which his horse had taken in its fall.  The difference was very slight indeed, yet it sufficed to send him towards another bush lower down the cliff.  Still, the height he had to fall would have ensured the breaking of all his bones if the bush had not hurled him off with a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21699"],["title","The Rover of the Andes: A Tale of Adventure on South America (#5)"],["body","rebound.  Lawrence almost felt giddy with horror.  Next moment a heavy plunge was heard.  The man had fallen into a deep dark pool in the river, which was scarce distinguishable from the cliffs above.  Being fringed with bushes, it was impossible to note whether he rose again.  Lawrence was still gazing anxiously at the pool, when something touched his cheek. It was a lasso which Pedro had quietly dropped over his shoulders.  \"Hold fast to it, senhor, you'll never get up without it,\" he said, in tones so earnest that the youth became suddenly alive to the great danger of his position.  In the haste and anxiety of his descent he had failed to note that one or two of the slight projections on which he had placed his feet had broken away, and that therefore a return to the top of the almost perpendicular precipice by the same route was impracticable.  Even the slight ledge on which he stood, and from which the little shrub grew, seemed to be crumbling away beneath his great weight.  With that feeling of alarm which the sudden and unexpected prospect of instant death brings, we presume, even to the stoutest hearts, Lawrence clutched the line convulsively.  He was ignorant at that time of the great strength of the South American lasso, and hesitated to trust his life entirely to it.  Pedro guessed his feelings.  \"Don't fear to trust it,\" he said, \"many a wild bull it has held, four times your size; but wait till Quashy and I get our feet well fixed-- we'll haul you up easily.\"  \"Have you made the end fast?\" cried Lawrence, looking up and encountering the anxious gaze of the Indian maiden.  \"Yes, massa, all fast,\" answered Quashy, whose look of horror can be more easily imagined than described.  \"Hold on, then, and _don't_ haul.\"  The two men obeyed, and the active youth pulled himself up hand over hand, making good use in passing of any hollow or projection that afforded the slightest hold for his toes.  At the top he was roughly grasped by his rescuers and dragged into safety.  \"Poor fellow!\" he exclaimed, on reaching the top.  \"Well, massa,\" said Quashy, with a broad grin, \"das jist w'at I's agwine to say, but you's too quick for me.\"  \"I meant the bandit, not myself,\" said Lawrence, looking over the cliff at the pool with an expression of great pity.  \"Ha! don't be uneasy about him,\" said Pedro, with a short laugh, as he resumed the binding of the stunned robber.  \"If he's killed or drowned he's well out o' the way.  If he has escaped he'll be sure to recover and make himself a pest to the neighbourhood for many a day to come.-- No, no, my good man, it's of no use, you needn't try it.\"  The latter part of this speech was in Spanish, and addressed to the robber, who, having recovered consciousness, had made a sudden struggle to shake off his captor.  As suddenly he ceased the effort on finding that the strength of the guide was greatly superior to his own.  In another minute Pedro stood up, having bound the bandit's hands in front of him in a manner that rendered any effort at self-liberation impossible--at least in a short space of time.  \"There,\" said Pedro to Lawrence, \"I'll warrant him to lead a harmless life until to-morrow at any rate.\"  As he spoke he drew the man's pistols, knife, and carbine, and handed them to Quashy.  \"There,\" he said, \"you may find these useful.\"  Meanwhile the robber lay quietly on his back, glancing from one to another of the party with looks of hatred that told clearly enough how he would have acted had he been free.  Turning to him as he was about to remount and quit the scene, Pedro said very sternly in Spanish--  \"You and I have met before, friend, and you know my powers with the rifle at long-range.  If you offer to rise from the spot where you now lie until we have disappeared round that rocky point half a mile along the road, you are a dead man.  After we have turned the point, you may go where you will and do what you please.  I might point out that in refraining from cutting your throat I am showing mercy which you don't deserve--but it is useless to throw pearls to swine.\"  The man spoke no word of reply, though he did look a little surprised as the party left him and rode away.  \"Would it not have been safer to have bound his hands behind his back?\" asked Lawrence.  \"No doubt it would, but he is secure enough for our purpose as he is. If I had bound him as you suggest, he would have been almost certain to perish, being quite unable to help himself.  As it is, he can use his tied hands to some extent, and, by perseverance in sawing the lines against sharp rocks, he will set himself free at last.  By that time, however, we shall be beyond his reach.\"  From time to time they all glanced over their shoulders as they rode along, but the bound man did not stir.  After they had passed beyond the point of rock before referred to, Lawrence's curiosity prompted him to turn back and peep round.  The bandit had already risen from the ground, and could be seen walking, as quickly as circumstances permitted, up the track by which they had just descended.  In a few minutes his tall figure was seen to pause for a brief space at the summit of the pass.  Then it disappeared on the other side into the gloomy recesses of the mountains.    CHAPTER FOUR.  IN WHICH QUASHY IS COMMUNICATIVE AND AN ENEMY IS TURNED INTO A FRIEND.  The pass which our travellers had just crossed merely led them over a mountain chain which may be described as the Peruvian Cordillera. Beyond it lay a fruitful valley of considerable extent, which terminated at the base of the great range, or backbone, of the Andes.  Beyond this again lay another valley of greater extent than the first, which was bounded by a third range or cordillera of inferior height, the eastern slopes of which descended on one hand in varying undulations to the dense forests of equatorial Brazil, on the other, by easy gradations to the level Pampas or plains which extend for hundreds of miles through the lands of the Argentine Confederation to the Atlantic.  Two mountain passes, therefore, were still to be crossed, and Lawrence Armstrong began to think that if things went on as they had begun a pretty lively experience probably lay before them.  But in this he was mistaken, at least as regarded banditti, though in some other respects the journey was not quite devoid of stirring incidents--as we shall see.  We have said that the good-nature of the young Englishman induced him to attempt conversation with the Indian girl, and at first Manuela appeared to be amused, if not interested, by his unsuccessful efforts; but after one of these futile attempts Pedro made some remarks to the girl in the Indian tongue, and in a tone of remonstrance, which had the effect of rendering her more silent and grave than before.  Lawrence, therefore, finally ceased to address her, though his natural gallantry prompted him to offer assistance when it seemed necessary, and to accost her with a hearty good-night and good-morning each day.  As Pedro, in his capacity of guide, usually rode a few paces in advance, and was frequently in a silent, abstracted mood, Lawrence was thus thrown almost entirely on the negro for companionship.  Although the young Englishman may not have estimated his company very highly, nothing could have been more satisfactory to Quashy, who, with delight expressed in every wrinkle and lineament of his black visage, fully availed himself of his opportunities.  \"O Massa Lawrie!\" he exclaimed, at the close of one of their conversations, \"how I does lub to talk ob de ole times when me an' you was play togidder!\"  \"Yes, it's very nice to recall old times,\" answered Lawrence, with a half-suppressed yawn, for they had by that time gone over the old times so often that the novelty had rather worn off.  \"Yes, bery nice,\" repeated Quashy, with gleaming eyes, \"when I tink ob de ole fadder an' de ole mill an' de ole fun what me an' you carried on--oh! my heart goes like to bu'st.\"  \"Don't let it bu'st here, whatever you do, Quashy, for you'll need all the heart you possess to carry you safely over these mountain passes.\"  Quashy opened his huge mouth, shut his eyes, and went off in a high falsetto--his usual mode of laughing.  He always laughed at Lawrence's little jokes, whether good or bad, insomuch that the youth finally abstained from jesting as much as possible.  \"I did not know,\" continued Lawrence, \"that there were so many robbers about.  Pedro tells me that the mountains are swarming with them just now.\"  \"Ho yis, massa, plenty ob rubbers eberywhar,\" said Quashy, with a nod, \"more nor 'nuff ob dem.  You see, massa, Chili an' Proo's a-fightin' wid each oder jus' now.  What dey's fightin' about no mortial knows; an', what's more, nobody cares.  I s'pose one say de oder's wrong an' de oder say de one's say not right.  Bof say das a big lie so at it dey goes hammer an' tongs to prove--ha! ha! to prove dey's bof right.  Oh my!\"  Here the negro opened his cavernous jaws and gave vent to another explosion of shrill laughter.  \"What fools dey is!\"  \"Then you think it is only fools who fight, Quashy?\"  \"Ob coorse, massa.  Don' you see, if dey wasn't fools dey wouldn't fight; 'cause fightin' can't prove nuffin', an' it can't do nuffin', 'cep' waste life an' money.  No doubt,\" added the negro, with a meditative gaze at the ground, \"when rubbers come at a feller he's boun' to fight, for why? he can't help it; or when Red Injin savages--\"  \"Have a care, Quashy, what you say about Indians.  I've warned you once already.\"  \"O massa!\" said the poor black, with a look of almost superhuman penitence, \"I beg your pard'n.  I's quite forgit to remimber.  I was just agwine to say that there _is_ times when you _mus'_ fight.  But isn't Chili Christ'n, an' isn't P'roo Christ'n?  I don' bleeve in Christ'ns what cut each oder's t'roats to prove dey's right.  Howsever, das noting.  What I's agwine to say is--dars a lot o' white livers on bof sides, an' dese dey runs away,"]]]
