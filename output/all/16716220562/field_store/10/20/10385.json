Olaf thoroughly believed in his aunt's truthfulness and wisdom.  He set to work to assist in clearing away the confusion--part of which, in the shape of toys and chips--was of his own creating--and became so busy that he almost forgot the ships--at least if he did remember them they did not weigh heavily on his mind.  \"Now, Olaf,\" said Gudrid, going to the window when the preparations were nearly completed, \"you may run down to the shore, for the ships will soon be on the strand.\"  The boy waited no second bidding, you may be sure.  He flew out of the house, and to his great surprise beheld the two ships--which so lately had appeared like sea-birds on the horizon--coming grandly up the fiord, their great square sails bulging out before a smart breeze.  All the men of the little colony were assembled on the shore--all, at least, who chanced to be at home at the time; but many of the inhabitants were absent--some fishing, some gone to Iceland, and others on viking-cruise.  There were probably about thirty men on the sands, besides a good many women and children.  It must not be supposed, however, that this was the whole of that Greenland colony.  It was only the part of it that had settled at Brattalid in Ericsfiord.  There was another portion, a few miles distant, named Heriulfness, nearly as large as that of Ericsfiord, which had been founded by Heriulf a friend and companion of Eric the Red. Heriulf had soon followed his friend Eric to the grave, leaving the management of the colony of Heriulfness to his son Biarne.  Biarne had not been present when the two sails were first observed, but he chanced to come over to Brattalid just before their arrival.  \"What, ho!  Biarne,\" shouted Leif, as the son of Heriulf went down to the beach, \"come up hither.\"  Leif stood on an elevated rock apart, and Biarne, a good deal excited, went up to him.  \"Why, what ails thee?\" asked Leif.  \"Nothing,\" replied Biarne, \"but I think I know whose ship that first one is.\"  \"Ay! is it the ship of a friend or a foe?\"  \"A friend,\" replied Biarne--\"at least he was a friend when I knew him in Norway, nigh twenty summers past, and I did not think him changeable. You and I, Leif, have often sailed these northern seas together and apart, but I do not think that in all our wanderings either of us has met before or since a finer man than Karlsefin, though he was a mere stripling when I knew him.\"  The Norseman's eyes flashed as he spoke of his friend, for, besides being a strong and handsome man, he possessed a warm enthusiastic heart. Indeed, he had been noted in the settlement for the strength of his affection for his father Heriulf, and his dutiful conduct towards him as long as the old man lived.  \"Karlsefin,\" repeated Leif, musing; \"I know him not.\"  \"Yet he knows you,\" said Biarne; \"when I met him in Norway I told him all about your discovery of Vinland.\"  \"Nay, thine own discovery of it,\" said Leif.  \"Not so,\" replied the other, with a blush, in which a frown mingled; \"I did but look upon the land--you went ashore and took possession.\"  \"Well, if I did so I have not retained it,\" replied Leif, with a laugh; \"but say, how know you that this is Karlsefin's ship?\"  \"I know by the cut of her figure-head and the colour of her sails. Karlsefin was always partial to stripes of white and blue.\"  \"Well, it may be as you say; we shall soon know.\"  Thus saying, Leif descended to the beach as the vessels approached and ran their keels straight on the sandy shores of the bay.  There was great bustle on board, and there were many men, besides some women, who could be seen looking over the bulwarks with keen interest, while Leif's men brought planks with which to make a gangway from the ship to the shore.  The ships which had thus come to Greenland were of the quaint build peculiar to the Norse vessels of those days--a peculiarity of build, by the way, which has not altogether disappeared, for to this day the great central mast, huge square sail, and high prow may be seen in the fiords of Norway.  Each of the vessels which now lay beached in Ericsfiord had a high forecastle and poop, with figure-heads on stem and stern-posts that towered higher still.  The ships were only half-decked, with benches for numerous rowers, and each had a crew of sixty men.  When the gangway was laid to the leading ship the first man who descended to the shore was of striking appearance.  It was not so much that he was tall and strong enough to have been a worthy foeman to the stoutest colonist in Ericsfiord, as that his demeanour was bland and courtly, while there was great intellectuality in his dark handsome countenance.  Unlike most Norsemen, his hair and beard were black and close-curling, and his costume, though simple, was rich in quality.  The moment he landed, Biarne stepped forward, exclaiming, \"Karlsefin!\"  The stranger's face lighted up with surprise and pleasure.  \"Biarne!\" he said, seizing his hand, \"I thought you were in Iceland.\"  \"So I was, but now I am in Greenland, and right glad to be the first to welcome my friend.\"  Hereupon the two shook hands fervently; but, not content with this, they seized each other in an embrace, and their bearded mouths met with a hearty masculine smack that did credit to their hearts, and which it might have gratified the feelings of an affectionate walrus to behold.    CHAPTER TWO.  STRONG EMOTIONS ARE SUCCEEDED BY SUPPER, AND FOLLOWED BY DISCUSSIONS ON DISCOVERY, WHICH END IN A WILD ALARM!  When Karlsefin had been introduced to Leif Ericsson, the former turned round and presented to him and Biarne his friend Thorward, the captain of the other ship.  Thorward was not a tall man, but was very broad and stout, and had a firm yet pleasing cast of countenance.  Both Thorward and Karlsefin were men of about thirty-five years of age.  \"Are you not on viking-cruise?\" asked Leif as they walked up to the house together, while the male members of his household and the men of the settlement assisted the crews to moor the ships.  \"No; my friend Thorward and I are not men of war.  We prefer the peaceful occupation of the merchant, and, to say truth, it is not unprofitable.\"  \"I would that more were of your way of thinking,\" said Leif.  \"I do not love the bloody game of war, and glad am I that we have got into a quiet corner here in Greenland, where there is small occasion for it.  Biarne, too, is of our way of thinking, as no doubt you already know.\"  \"He has often told me so, and, if I mistake not, has feathered his nest well by merchanting.\"  \"He has,\" answered Biarne for himself, with a laugh.  While they thus advanced, talking, little Olaf had kept walking in front of the tall stranger, looking up into his face with unbounded admiration.  He had never before seen any man so magnificent.  His father and Biarne, whom he had hitherto regarded as perfect specimens of mankind, were quite eclipsed.  Looking backward and walking forward is an unsafe process at any time.  So Olaf found it on the present occasion, for he tripped over a stone and in falling hit his little nose with such violence that it soon became a big nose, and bled profusely.  Karlsefin picked him up and set him on his legs.  \"My poor boy, don't cry,\" he said.  \"No fear of _him_ crying,\" observed Leif; \"he never cries,--save when his feelings are hurt.  When you touch these he _is_ addicted to blubbering.--Run, lad, and Gudrid will wash you.\"  Olaf bounded into the house, where he was carried off to a sleeping-room and there carefully sponged by the sympathetic Gudrid.  \"Oh!--\" he exclaimed, while his face was being washed.  \"Does it pain you much, dear?\" said the pretty aunt, interrupting him.  \"Oh!\" he continued, enthusiastically, \"I never did see such a splendid man before.\"  \"What splendid man, child?\"  \"Why, Karlsefin.\"  \"And who is Karlsefin?\"  \"The stranger who has come across the sea from Norway.\"  \"Indeed,\" said Gudrid.  Whether it was the sound of the stranger's voice in the adjoining room, or anxiety to complete her hospitable preparations, that caused Gudrid to bring her operations on Olaf to an abrupt termination, we cannot tell, but certain it is that she dried him rather quickly and hastened into the outer hall, where she was introduced to the two strangers in due form as widow Gudrid.  She had no difficulty in distinguishing which was Olaf's \"splendid man!\" She looked at Karlsefin and fell in love with him on the spot, but Gudrid was modest, and not sentimental.  It is only your mawkishly sentimental people who are perpetually tumbling into love, and out of it, and can't help showing it.  Cupid shot her right through the heart with one powerful dart, and took her unawares too, but she did not show the smallest symptom of having been even grazed.  She neither blushed nor stammered, nor looked conscious, nor affected to look unconscious. She was charmingly natural!  But this was not all: Karlsefin also fell in love on the spot,--over head and ears and hair, and hat to boot; neither did he show sign of it! After the trifling ceremonies usual on an introduction were over, he turned to continue his conversation with Leif and paid no further attention to Gudrid, while she busied herself in preparing supper.  It is true that he looked at her now and then, but of course he looked at everybody, now and then, in the course of the evening.  Besides, it is well-known what is said about the rights of the feline species in reference to royalty.  At supper Gudrid waited on the guests, Karlsefin therefore, necessarily paid her somewhat more attention in accepting her civilities, but Thorward was quite as attentive as he, so that the most sharp-witted match-maker in the world would have failed to note any symptom of anything whatever in regard to either of them.  Gudrid felt this a little, for she was accustomed to admiration from the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#2)"],["body"," men of Ericsfiord and Heriulfness, and, you know, people don't like to want what they are accustomed to.  What Karlsefin thought, he did not show and never mentioned, therefore we cannot tell.  Now, good reader, pray do not run away with the notion that this love affair is the plot on which the story is to hinge!  Nothing of the kind. It ran its course much more rapidly, and terminated much more abruptly, than you probably suppose--as the sequel will show.  During supper there was not much conversation, for all were hungry, but afterwards, when cans of home-brewed ale were handed round, the tongues began to move.  Leif soon observed that Karlsefin merely sipped his beer, but never once drank.  \"You do not drink,\" he said, pushing a large silver tankard towards him; \"come, fill up.\"  \"Thanks, I drink but sparingly,\" said Karlsefin, taking up the large tankard and admiring the workmanship.  \"In good sooth ye do,\" cried Biarne, with a laugh; \"a mouse could hardly slake his thirst with all that you have yet imbibed.\"  \"I have been so long at sea,\" rejoined Karlsefin, smiling, \"that I have lost my relish for beer.  We had nothing but water with us.  Where got you this tankard, Leif, it is very massive and the workmanship such as one seldom meets with save in kings' houses?\"  \"It belonged to a king!\" replied Leif, with a look of pride.  \"Good King Olaf Tryggvisson gave it to me on an occasion when I chanced to do him some small service.  Many winters have passed since then.\"  \"Indeed, Leif! then you must be a favourite with King Olaf,\" exclaimed Karlsefin, \"for I am the bearer of another gift to you from his royal hand.\"  \"To me?\"  \"Ay.  Hearing that I meant to sail over to Greenland this summer, he asked me to bear you his remembrances, and gave me two slaves to present to you in token of his continued friendship.\"  Leif's face beamed with satisfaction, and he immediately filled and quaffed a bumper of ale to King Olaf's health, which example was followed by Biarne and the guests, as well as by the house-carls who sat on benches in various parts of the hall drinking their ale and listening to the conversation.  Even little Olaf--who had been named after the king of Norway--filled his tankard to the brim with milk, and quaffed it off with a swagger that was worthy of a descendant of a long line of sea-kings, who could trace their lineage back to Odin himself.  \"The slaves,\" continued Karlsefin, \"are from the land of the Scots. Wouldst like to see a Scotsman, Gudrid?\" he added, turning to the widow who sat near him.  \"I should like it much.  I have heard of the Scots in Iceland.  'Tis said they are a well-favoured race, stout warriors, and somewhat fond of trading.\"  Leif and Biarne both laughed loud and long at this.  \"In good truth they are a stout race, and fight like very wild-cats, as Biarne and I can testify; as to their being well-favoured, there can be no question about that; though they are rather more rugged than the people farther south, and--yes, they _are_ good traders, and exceedingly cautious men.  They think well before they speak, and they speak slowly--sometimes they won't speak at all.  Ha! ha!  Here, I drink to the land of the Scot.  It is a grand good land, like our own dear old Norway.\"  \"Brother-in-law,\" exclaimed Gudrid, reproachfully, \"do you forget that you are an Icelander?\"  \"Forget!\" exclaimed Leif, tossing back his yellow locks, and raising the tankard again to pledge his native land; \"no, I shall only forget Iceland when I forget to live; but I don't forget, also, that it is only about 130 years since my great-grandfather and his companions came over from Norway to Iceland.  Before that it was an unpeopled rock in the Northern Sea, without name or history.  [Iceland was colonised by Norsemen about the year 874.] 'Twas as little known then as Vinland is known now.\"  \"By the way, Biarne,\" said Karlsefin, turning to his friend, \"the mention of Vinland reminds me that, when you and I met last, you did not give me a full account of that discovery, seeing that you omitted to mention your own share in it.  Tell me how was it, and when and where was it?  Nay, have I unintentionally touched on a sore point?\" he added, on observing a slight shade of annoyance pass over Biarne's usually cheerful countenance.  \"He _is_ a little sore about it,\" said Leif, laughing.  \"Come, Biarne, don't be thin-skinned.  You know the saying, A dutiful son makes a glad father.  You had the best of reasons for acting as you did.\"  \"Ay, but people don't believe in these best of reasons,\" retorted Biarne, still annoyed, though somewhat mollified by Leif's remarks.  \"Never mind, 'tis long past now.  Come, give us the saga.  'Tis a good one, and will bear re-telling.\"  \"Oh yes,\" exclaimed Olaf, with sparkling eyes, for the boy dearly loved anything that bore the faintest resemblance to a saga or story, \"tell it, Biarne.\"  \"Not I,\" said Biarne; \"Leif can tell it as well as I, if he chooses.\"  \"Well, I'll try,\" said Leif, laying his huge hand on the table and looking earnestly at Karlsefin and Thorward.  The latter was a very silent man, and had scarcely uttered a word all the evening, but he appeared to take peculiar interest in Vinland, and backed up the request that Leif would give an account of its discovery.  \"About twenty summers ago,\" said Leif, \"my father, Eric the Red, and his friend Heriulf, Biarne's father, came over here from Iceland.  [A.D. 986.] Biarne was a very young man at the time--little more than a boy-- but he was a man of enterprise, and fond of going abroad, and possessed a merchant-ship of his own with which he gathered wealth, and, I will say it, reputation also--though perhaps I should not say that to his face.  \"He was a good son, and used to be by turns a year abroad and a year with his father.  He chanced to be away in Norway when Heriulf and my father Eric came over to Greenland.  On returning to Iceland he was so much disappointed to hear of his father's departure that he would not unload his ship, but resolved to follow his old custom and take up his winter abode with his father.  `Who will go with me to Greenland?' said he to his men.  `We will all go,' replied the men.  `Our expedition,' said Biarne, `will be thought foolish, as none of us have ever been on the Greenland sea before.'  `We mind not that,' said the men--so away they sailed for three days and lost sight of Iceland.  Then the wind failed; after that a north wind and a fog set in, and they knew not where they were sailing to; and this lasted many days.  At length the sun appeared.  Then they knew the quarters of the sky, and, after sailing a day and a night, made the land.  \"They saw that it was without mountains, was covered with wood, and that there were small hills inland.  Biarne saw that this did not answer to the description of Greenland; he knew he was too far south, so he left the land on the larboard side, and sailed two days and nights before they got sight of land again.  The men asked Biarne if this was Greenland, but he said it was not, `For on Greenland,' he says, `there are great snowy mountains, but this is flat and covered with trees.' Here the wind fell and the men wanted to go ashore, `Because,' said they, `we have need of wood and water.'  Biarne replied, `Ye are not in want of either;' and the men blamed him for this,--but the season was far spent, he knew not how long it might take him to find Greenland, so he had no time to spare.--Was it not so?\" said Leif, appealing to his friend.  \"It was so,\" replied Biarne, nodding gravely.  \"Well then,\" continued Leif, \"it must be told that he ordered them to hoist the sail, which they did, and, turning the bow from the land, kept the sea for three days and nights, with a fine breeze from the south-west, when a third time land was seen, with high snowy mountains. Still Biarne would not land, for it was not like what had been reported of Greenland.  They soon found it to be an island, and, turning from it, stood out to sea, when the breeze increased to a gale, forcing them to take in a reef; so they sailed for three days and nights more, and made land the fourth time.  This turned out to be Greenland, and quite close to Heriulf's dwelling at Heriulfness.  Biarne then gave up seafaring, and dwelt with his old father as long as he lived; but since his death he has been sometimes at sea and sometimes at home.  Now, these lands which Biarne discovered, were what I have since called Vinland.\"  \"Yes,\" exclaimed Biarne, with a look of indignation; \"and when I afterwards fared to Norway they blamed me for not going on shore and exploring these lands--as if I, at the end of autumn, could afford to put off time in explorations, when it was all I could do to make my port before the winter set in!\"  He finished off by striking the table with his fist, seizing his tankard, and draining it to the bottom.  \"I have often observed,\" said Karlsefin, quietly, \"that people who sit by their firesides at home, and do nothing, are usually very severe and noisy in their remarks on those who fare abroad and do great things; but that arises not so much from ill-will as ignorance.\"  \"But what of your own doings, Leif?\" said Thorward, breaking in here impatiently.  \"Well, I didn't do much,\" replied Leif.  \"I only took possession, and didn't keep it.  This was the way of it.  Fourteen years after this voyage of Biarne, [about the year A.D. 1000] I was seized with a desire to see these new lands.  I bought Biarne's ship from him, set sail with a good crew, and found the lands, just as Biarne had described them, far away to the south of Greenland.  I landed and gave names to some places. At the farthest south point we built huts and spent the winter, but returned home in spring.  I called this part Vinland, and this is the reason why: We had a German with us named Tyrker, who is with me here still.  One day Tyrker was lost; I was very anxious about him, fearing that he had been killed by wild"]]]
