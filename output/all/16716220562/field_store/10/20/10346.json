You are too much excited to hear about it just now.  Enough to say that I am much better.  Now, if you are wise, you will go without delay and take some steps about this affair.\"  \"You're right, lad,\" returned the captain, rising quietly and clapping on his hat; \"so good-bye to 'ee both.  I'll soon be back.  At present I'm off to consult my--my--solicitor! though I don't know who he is yet, more than the man in the moon.\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  AN UNQUIET, ADVENTUROUS MORNING IN THE SHELL-CAVE.  \"I think,\" said Jeff Benson one fine morning, as he got up and stretched himself, \"that I feel well enough to-day to get down to the shore without assistance.  You know, auntie, I shall never be able to walk alone if I give way to laziness, and lean so much on others.  I'm like the babies now, and must be encouraged to try it on my own hook.\"  He looked at Miss Millet with a half-pitiful smile, for there was something woefully true in his words, and his good little nurse found it necessary to go in search of the household keys for a minute or so before answering.  \"Well, Jeff, perhaps you are right and the day is splendid--sunny, calm, and warm--so you won't be likely to catch cold.  Only don't go far, for you might become tired out.  So, promise that you won't go far, and then I will let you go.\"  Jeff promised; but of course he did not do exactly as his nurse wished, for, in such circumstances, the word \"far\" has a wonderfully varied significance.  At first, leaning on his stick and pausing frequently to recover strength, he made his way to the shore; but when there, the invigorating air and the exhilarating sound of ripples on the sand, and a rest on the rocks, made him feel so much better, that he thought he might walk the length of the shell-cave without breaking his promise.  He tried, and succeeded, but was so fatigued, when at length he threw himself on the soft sand at the cave's mouth, that he felt uneasy about getting home again.  The shell-cave was a favourite nook in a lonely part of the cliffs, which Jeff had been wont to frequent in his coastguard days, especially at that particular time when he seemed to expect the revival of the smuggling traffic near Miss Millet's cottage.  He had frequently spoken of it to Rose as a beautiful spot where innumerable sea-shells were to be found, and had once taken her to see it.  It was, as we have said, a lonely spot, far removed from the fishing town, and was sought out by Jeff because he did not yet feel strong enough to hold much intercourse with his friends and former mates--none of whom had seen him since his illness began.  But the poor invalid was doomed to several interruptions that day.  The first comer was his comrade Wilson, of the coastguard, whose place he had taken on the eventful night of the wreck.  On rounding the point of rock, and coming suddenly on our hero, that worthy was struck dumb and motionless for at least a minute, while his eyes gradually opened wide with surprise, and his mouth partially followed suit.  \"Not Jeff Benson!\" said Wilson at last, in quite a solemn tone.  \"What's left of him,\" answered Jeff, with a faint smile.  \"An' it ain't much!\" returned Wilson, with a kind of gasp, as he approached softly.  \"Not much more than the bones an' clothes,\" said Jeff, with a laugh at his friend's expression; \"also,\" he added more seriously, \"a good deal of the spirit, thank God.  How are all the lads, Wilson?\"  The man tried to answer, but could not.  The sight of his old stalwart chum so reduced was too much for him.  He could only go down on one knee, and take the thin large hand in his.  Seeing this, Jeff returned his squeeze, and relieved him by saying--  \"You can beat me now, Wilson, but I could squeeze till I made you howl once, and mayhap I'll do it again--who knows?  But you must not think me unkind if I ask you to leave me, Wilson.  The Doctor is always insisting that I must keep quiet; so, good-day to you, my boy, an' remember me kindly to my comrades.\"  The next visitor, who appeared half an hour later, was the terrier dog of the station.  Bounce belonged, of right, to David Bowers, but, being amiable, it acknowledged the part-ownership of all the men.  On suddenly beholding Jeff, it rushed at him with a mingled bark and squeal of joy, and thereafter, for full two minutes, danced round him, a mass of wriggling hair from tip of tail to snout, in uncontrollable ecstasy. Mingled misery and surprise at Jeff's sudden and unaccountable disappearance, prolonged agonies of disappointed expectation, the sickness of heart resulting from hope long deferred, all were forgotten in that supreme moment of joy at reunion with his long-lost human friend!  Jeff had to rise and sit down on a shelf of rock to escape some of Bounce's overwhelming affection.  Presently Bounce's owner appeared, and went through something of a similar performance--humanised, however, and with more of dignity.  \"I can't tell 'ee how glad I am to see you again, Jeff,\" said Bowers, sitting down beside him, and grasping his hand.  \"But oh, man, how thin--\"  The huge coastguardsman choked at this point, as Wilson had done before him; but, being more ready of resource, he turned it into a cough, and declared, sternly, that night-work must have given him a cold, or \"suthin' o' that sort.\"  After which he made a great demonstration of clearing his throat and blowing his nose.  \"But you'll soon be yours--at least, somethin' like your old self, before long, Jeff.  The doctor told us that, the last time he was at the station.\"  \"If God wills,\" returned Jeff, softly; \"I am in His hands, and willing to be what He chooses.  You remember, David, the talk we once had about Miss Millet's argument, that God brings good out of evil.  I didn't believe it then; I believe it now.  I've bin to school since I last saw you, David, and I've learned a good lesson, for I can say from my heart it has been good for me that I was afflicted.\"  Bowers did not reply, but looked at his friend with an expression of puzzled surprise.  \"Yes,\" continued Jeff, with rising enthusiasm; \"I have lost my health-- the doctor thinks permanently.  I've lost the strength that I used to be so proud of, and with it the hope of being able to make a living in any active line of life; and I've lost much more besides.  But what I have found in my Saviour far more than makes up for it all.\"  In the \"much more besides,\" poor Jeff mentally referred to his loss of all hope of ever gaining the hand of Rose Millet; for if his chance seemed small before, how immeasurably was it reduced now that his health was shattered, and his power even of supporting himself gone.  No; he felt that that door was closed--that he must avoid the girl as much as possible in future; and, above all, be particularly careful not to fall in love with her.  Of course, it was only a passing fancy as yet, and, like fruit, would never ripen unless the sun shone.  He would avoid the sunshine!  Meanwhile, of all these rapidly fleeting thoughts, he said never a word to his friend David Bowers, but after a little more conversation, begged him also to go away and let him rest.  All very good, friend Jeff; but what if the sun should shine in spite of you?  Just about that time, in the course of his eager and somewhat erratic wanderings among solicitors and other men of business, Captain Millet made a sudden pause, and, by way of taking breath, rushed down to Folkestone, brought Rose up to Cranby, hired a dog-cart, and drove along the sands at low tide, in the direction of his sister's cottage.  \"I think it probable that you may see him today, Rosebud,\" he said, \"though I'm not quite sure, for the doctor is afraid of a relapse, and friends are not yet allowed to visit him.  To be sure bein' only a little girl, you probably wouldn't disturb him at all--'specially if you didn't speak.  Anyhow, you'll see auntie, which will be more to the purpose.\"  \"Father,\" said Rose, whose name seemed remarkably appropriate at that moment, \"I should like to get down here, and walk the rest of the way. By the time I arrive, you'll have had a little talk with poor Jeff and auntie.  Besides, there is a pretty cave that I used to gather shells in when I was last here.  I would like so much to pay it a visit in passing.\"  Of course the captain had no objection, and thus it came to pass that Jeff's fourth visitor on that unquiet morning was the Rosebud!  How feeble are written words to convey ideas at times!  If you could have obtained one glance of Rose and Jeff at that moment, reader, words would not be required.  No peony ever blushed like that Rose--to say nothing of the blank amazement in those wide blue eyes.  Jeff, still seated on the rock, became petrified.  Recovering first, as women always do, Rose hurried forward with--\"I'm _so_ glad, Mr ---,\" but there she stopped abruptly, for the unexpected sight of that stalwart coastguardsman, reduced to a big skeleton with pale face, hollow cheeks, cavernous eyes, and an old-man stoop, was too much for her.  She covered her face with her hands and burst into tears.  What could Jeff do?  He forgot his prudent resolves.  He forgot his weakness because his strength seemed to have suddenly returned.  He sprang up, intending to comfort the poor girl in a brotherly sort of way.  Somehow--he never could clearly remember how--he had her seated on the rock beside him, with his arm round her waist and her head on his shoulder.  A few moments later--he never could tell how many--the wickedness of his conduct came down upon Jeff like a thunderbolt.  He removed his arm, drew away from her about three inches, and looked in her surprised face with a solemn, self-condemned"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21744"],["title","The Lifeboat (#0)"],["body","LIFEBOAT, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE BEGINNING--IN WHICH SEVERAL IMPORTANT PERSONAGES ARE INTRODUCED.  There existed, not many years ago, a certain street near the banks of old Father Thames which may be described as being one of the most modest and retiring little streets in London.  The neighbourhood around that street was emphatically dirty and noisy. There were powerful smells of tallow and tar in the atmosphere, suggestive of shipping and commerce.  Narrow lanes opened off the main street affording access to wharves and warehouses, and presenting at their termini segmentary views of ships' hulls, bowsprits, and booms, with a background of muddy water and smoke.  There were courts with unglazed windows resembling doors, and massive cranes clinging to the walls.  There were yards full of cases and barrels, and great anchors and chains, which invaded the mud of the river as far as was consistent with safety; and adventurous little warehouses, which stood on piles, up to the knees, as it were, in water, totally regardless of appearances, and utterly indifferent as to catching cold.  As regards the population of this locality, rats were, perhaps, in excess of human beings; and it might have been observed that the former were particularly frolicsome and fearless.  Farther back, on the landward side of our unobtrusive street, commercial and nautical elements were more mingled with things appertaining to domestic life.  Elephantine horses, addicted to good living, drew through the narrow streets wagons and vans so ponderous and gigantic that they seemed to crush the very stones over which they rolled, and ran terrible risk of sweeping little children out of the upper windows of the houses.  In unfavourable contrast with these, donkeys, of the most meagre and starved aspect, staggered along with cartloads of fusty vegetables and dirty-looking fish, while the vendors thereof howled the nature and value of their wares with deliberate ferocity.  Low pawnbrokers (chiefly in the \"slop\" line) obtruded their seedy wares from doors and windows halfway across the pavement, as if to tempt the naked; and equally low pastry-cooks spread forth their stale viands in unglazed windows, as if to seduce the hungry.  Here the population was mixed and varied.  Busy men of business and of wealth, porters and wagoners, clerks and warehousemen, rubbed shoulders with poor squalid creatures, men and women, whose business or calling no one knew and few cared to know except the policeman on the beat, who, with stern suspicious glances, looked upon them as objects of special regard, and as enemies; except, also, the earnest-faced man in seedy black garments, with a large Bible (_evidently_) in his pocket, who likewise looked on them as objects of special regard, and as friends. The rats were much more circumspect in this locality.  They were what the Yankees would call uncommonly \"cute,\" and much too deeply intent on business to indulge in play.  In the lanes, courts, and alleys that ran still farther back into the great hive, there was an amount of squalor, destitution, violence, sin, and misery, the depth of which was known only to the people who dwelt there, and to those earnest-faced men with Bibles who made it their work to cultivate green spots in the midst of such unpromising wastes, and to foster the growth of those tender and beautiful flowers which sometimes spring and flourish where, to judge from appearances, one might be tempted to imagine nothing good could thrive.  Here also there were rats, and cats too, besides dogs of many kinds; but they all of them led hard lives of it, and few appeared to think much of enjoying themselves. Existence seemed to be the height of their ambition.  Even the kittens were depressed, and sometimes stopped in the midst of a faint attempt at play to look round with a scared aspect, as if the memory of kicks and blows was strong upon them.  The whole neighbourhood, in fact, teemed with sad yet interesting sights and scenes, and with strange violent contrasts.  It was not a spot which one would naturally select for a ramble on a summer evening after dinner; nevertheless it was a locality where time might have been profitably spent, where a good lesson or two might have been learned by those who have a tendency to \"consider the poor.\"  But although the neighbourhood was dirty and noisy, our modest street, which was at that time known by the name of Redwharf Lane, was comparatively clean and quiet.  True, the smell of tallow and tar could not be altogether excluded, neither could the noises; but these scents and sounds reached it in a mitigated degree, and as the street was not a thoroughfare, few people entered it, except those who had business there, or those who had lost their way, or an occasional street boy of an explorative tendency; which last, on finding that it was a quiet spot, invariably entered a protest against such an outrageous idea as quietude in \"the City\" by sending up a series of hideous yells, and retiring thereafter precipitately.  Here, in Redwharf Lane, was the office of the firm of Denham, Crumps, and Company.  Mr Denham stood with his back to the fire, for it was a coldish autumn day, with his coat-tails under his arms.  He was a big bald man of five-and-forty, with self-importance enough for a man of five-hundred-and-forty.  Mr Crumps sat in a small back-office, working so diligently that one might have supposed he was endeavouring to bring up the arrears of forty years' neglect, and had pledged himself to have it done before dinner.  He was particularly small, excessively thin, very humble, rather deaf, and upwards of sixty.  Company had died of lockjaw two years previous to the period of which we write, and is therefore unworthy of farther notice.  A confidential clerk had taken, and still retained, his place.  Messrs. Denham, Crumps, and Company, were shipowners.  Report said that they were rich, but report frequently said what was not true in those days.  Whether it has become more truthful in the present days, remains an open question.  There can be no question, however, that much business was done at the office in Redwharf Lane, and that, while Denham lived in a handsome mansion in Russell Square, and Crumbs dwelt in a sweet cottage in Kensington, Company had kept a pony phaeton, and had died in a snug little villa on Hampstead Heath.  The office of Denham, Crumps, and Company was small and unpretending, as was the street in which it stood.  There was a small green door with a small brass plate and a small brass knocker, all of which, when opened by their attendant, a small tiger in blue, with buttons, gave admittance to a small passage that terminated in a small room.  This was the outer office, and here sat the four clerks of the establishment on four tall stools, writing in four monstrous volumes, as furiously as if they were decayed authors whose lives depended on the result.  Their salaries did, poor fellows, and that was much the same thing!  A glass door, with scratches here and there, through which the head of the firm could gaze unseen, separated \"the office\" from Denham's room, and a wooden door separated that from Crumps' room, beyond which there was a small closet or cell which had been Company's room before that gentleman died.  It was now used as a repository for ancient books and papers.  \"Very odd,\" said Mr Denham, and as he said so he touched a small silver bell that stood on his writing-table.  The tiger in blue and buttons instantly appeared.  \"Here, Peekins, post these letters.  Has no one called this afternoon; I mean, no one resembling a sailor?\"  The boy in blue started, and his face became very red.  \"Why, what's the matter, boy?  What do you mean by staring at me, instead of answering my question?\"  \"Please, sir,\" stammered Peekins meekly, \"I didn't mean no 'arm, sir, but you see, sir, his face was so drefful fierce, and he looked sich a wild--\"  \"Boy, are you mad?\" interrupted Mr Denham, advancing and seizing the tiger by his blue collar; \"what are you talking about?  Now, answer my question at once, else I'll shake the little life you have out of your body.  Did any sailor-like man call at the office this afternoon?\"  \"Oh, sir, yes, sir,--I--I--thought he was drunk and wouldn't let 'im in, sir; he's bin a standin' stampin' at the door for more than--\"  The end of the sentence was cut short by Mr Denham suddenly ejecting the boy from the room and shouting, \"Let him in!\"  In a few seconds a heavy tread was heard in the outer office, and the boy ushered in a tall young man, of unusually large proportions, with extremely broad shoulders, and apparently about twenty-three years of age, whose rough pilot-coat, wide pantaloons, and glazed hat bespoke him a sailor.  His countenance was flushed, and an angry frown contracted his brow as he strode into the room, pulled off his hat and stood before the head of the house of Denham, Crumps, and Company.  \"I beg pardon, sir,\" began the sailor, somewhat sharply, yet without disrespect, \"when I am asked to come--\"  \"Yes, yes, Bax,\" interposed Mr Denham, \"I know what you would say. Pray calm yourself.  It is a pity you should have been kept waiting outside, but the fact is that my boy is a new one, and apparently he is destitute of common sense.  Sit down.  I sent for you to say that I wish you to take the `Nancy' to Liverpool.  You will be ready to start at once, no doubt--\"  \"Before the schooner is overhauled?\" inquired Bax, in surprise.  \"Of course,\" said Denham, stiffly; \"I see no occasion for _another_ overhaul.  That schooner will cost us more than she is worth if we go on repairing at the rate we have been doing the last two years.\"  \"She needs it all, sir,\" rejoined Bax, earnestly.  \"The fact is, Mr Denham, I feel it to be my duty to tell you that there ain't a sound plank or timber in her from stem to stern, and I'm pretty sure that if she costs you money, she's likely to cost me"]]]
