Generally speaking, one's eye can no more follow the legs than it can the spokes of a carriage wheel in rapid motion.\"  \"I do hope we may succeed in falling in with one,\" observed the major.  \"If you do there is not much chance of your shooting it,\" said the missionary.  \"Why not?\"  \"Because he is so difficult to approach.  Usually he feeds on some open spot where no one can approach him without being detected by his wary eye.  However, you have this in your favour, that his stupidity is superior to his extreme caution.  If a wagon should chance to move along far to windward of him, he evidently thinks it is trying to circumvent him, for instead of making off to leeward, as he might easily do, he rushes up to windward with the intention of passing _ahead_ of the wagon, and sometimes passes so near the front oxen that one may get a shot at the silly thing.  I have seen this stupidity of his taken advantage of when he was feeding in a valley open at both ends.  A number of men would commence running as if to cut off his retreat from the end through which the wind came, and although he had the whole country hundreds of miles before him by going to the other end, he rushed madly on to get past the men, and so was speared, for it is one of his peculiarities that he never swerves from the course he has once adopted, but rushes wildly and blindly forward, anxious only to increase his speed.  Sometimes a horseman may succeed in killing him by cutting across his undeviating course.  It is interesting to notice a resemblance between this huge bird and our English wild duck or plover. I have several times seen newly-hatched young in charge of a cock-ostrich who made a very good attempt at appearing lame in order to draw off the attention of pursuers.  The young squat down and remain immoveable, when too small to run far, but they attain a wonderful degree of speed when about the size of common fowls.  It requires the utmost address of the bushmen, creeping for miles on their stomach, to stalk them successfully; yet the quantity of feathers collected annually shows that the numbers slain must be considerable, as each bird has only a few feathers in the wings and tail.\"  \"Well,\" observed the major, shaking the ashes out of his pipe, \"your account of the bird makes me hope that we shall fall in with him before our expedition is over.\"  \"Do you mean to be out long?\"  \"As long as we can manage, which will be a considerable time,\" answered the major, \"because we are well supplied with everything, except, I regret to say, medicine.  The fact is that none of us thought much about that, for we have always been in such a robust state of health that we have scarce believed in the possibility of our being knocked down; but the first few weeks of our journey hither taught some of us a lesson when too late.\"  \"Ah, we are often taught lessons when too late,\" said the missionary; \"however, it is not too late on this occasion, for I am happy to say that I can supply you with all the physic you require.\"  The major expressed much gratification on hearing this, and indeed he felt it, for the country into which they were about to penetrate was said to be rather unhealthy.  \"You are very kind, sir,\" he said; \"my companions and I shall feel deeply indebted to you for this opportune assistance.\"  \"Are you quite sure,\" asked the missionary pointedly, \"that you are supplied with everything else that you require?\"  \"I think so,\" replied the major.  \"Let me see--yes, I don't know that we need anything more, now that you have so kindly offered to supply us with physic, which I had always held, up to the period of my residence in Africa, was fit only to be thrown to the dog.\"  The missionary looked earnestly in the major's face, and said--  \"Excuse me, sir, have you got a Bible?\"  \"Well--a--really, my dear sir,\" he replied, somewhat confusedly, \"I must confess that I have not.  The fact is, that it is somewhat inconvenient to carry books in such regions, and I did not think of bringing a Bible. Perhaps some one of our party may have one, however.\"  None of the party replied to the major's look except Tom Brown, who quietly said--  \"There is one, I believe, in the bottom of my trunk; one of my sisters told me she put it there, but I cannot say positively that I have seen it.\"  \"Will you accept of one?\" said the missionary, rising; \"we start at an early hour in the morning, and before going I would like to remind you, gentlemen, that eternity is near--nearer perchance than we suppose to some of us, and that medicine is required for the soul even more than for the body.  Jesus Christ, the great Physician, will teach you how to use it, if you will seek advice from himself.  I feel assured that you will not take this parting word ill.  Good night, gentlemen.  I will give the drugs to your guide before leaving, and pray that God may prosper you in your way and give you success.\"  There was a long silence round the camp-fire after the missionary had left.  When night closed in, and the sportsmen had retired to rest, the minds of most of them dwelt somewhat seriously on the great truth which he had stated--that medicine is needed not only for the body but the soul.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  DESCRIBES RIVER HUNTING.  \"Well, major, what are your orders for the day?\" asked Tom Brown one fine morning after breakfast, while they were enjoying their usual pipe under the shade of a large umbrageous tree.  \"You'd better try the river that we have just come to,\" said the major.  \"Do you think me amphibious, that you should always assign me that work?\" asked Tom.  \"Not exactly, Tom, but I know you are fond of telling fibs, and perhaps the amphibious animals may afford you some scope in that way.  At all events they are capable of such astonishing feats that if you merely relate the truth about them you will be sure to get credit in England for telling fibs--like poor Mungo Park, who was laughed at all his life for a notorious drawer of the long-bow, although there never was a more truthful man.\"  \"People won't judge _us_ so harshly, major,\" said Wilkins; \"for so many African travellers have corroborated Mungo Park's stories that the truth is pretty well known and believed by people of average education.  But pray is it your lordship's pleasure that I should accompany Tom?  You know he cannot take care of himself, and no one of the party can act so powerfully as a check on his inveterate propensity to inordinate smoking as myself.\"  \"You must have studied Johnson's dictionary very closely in your boyhood,\" said Tom, puffing a prolonged cloud as a termination to the sentence.  \"But, major, if you do condemn me to his company, please let us have Mafuta again, for Wilkins and I are like two uncongenial stones, and he acts as lime to keep us together.\"  \"Don't you think that Hicks had better be consulted before we make arrangements?\" suggested Pearson.  \"Hear, hear,\" cried Ogilvie; \"and I should like to know what is to be done with Brand and Anson, for they are both very much down with fever of some sort this morning.\"  \"Leave Jumbo with them,\" said Tom Brown; \"he's better at nursing than hunting.  By the way, was it not he who nursed the native that died last night in the kraal?\"  \"It was, and they say he killed the poor nigger by careless treatment,\" said Pearson.  \"What nigger do you refer to?\" asked Ogilvie.  \"The one who died--but, I forgot, you were out after that hyena when it happened, and so I suppose have not heard of it,\" said Pearson.  \"We had a funeral in the village over there last night, and they say that our fellow Jumbo, who it seems was once a friend of the sick man, offered to sit up with him last night.  There is a rumour that he was an enemy of Jumbo's, and that our cowardly scoundrel made this offer in order to have an opportunity of killing him in a quiet way.  Hicks even goes the length of saying he is sure that Jumbo killed him, for when he saw the sick man last he was under the impression what he had got the turn, and gave him a powder that would have been certain to cure--\"  \"Or kill,\" interrupted Tom Brown; \"I've no faith in Hicks's skill as a practitioner.\"  \"Of course not,\" said Wilkins, \"proverbial philosophy asserts and requires that doctors should disagree.\"  \"Be that as it may,\" continued Pearson, \"the native did die and was buried, so that's an end of him, and yonder sits Jumbo eating his breakfast at the camp-fire as if he had done a most virtuous action. The fact is, I don't believe the reports.  I cannot believe that poor Jumbo, coward though he is, would be guilty of such an act.\"  \"Perhaps not,\" said the major, rising, \"but there's no possibility of settling the question now, and here comes Hicks, so I'll go and make arrangements with him about the day's proceedings.\"  \"They have a primitive mode of conducting funerals here,\" said Tom Brown when the major had left.  \"I happened to be up at the kraal currying favour with the chief man, for he has the power of bothering us a good deal if he chooses, and I observed what they did with this same dead man.  I saw that he was very low as I passed the hut where he lay, and stopped to look on.  His breath was very short, and presently he fell into what either might have been a profound sleep, or a swoon, or death; I could not be quite sure which, not being used to black fellows.  I would have examined the poor man, but the friends kicked up a great row and shoved me off.  Before the breath could have been well out of his body, they hoisted him up and carried him away to burial.  I followed out of mere curiosity, and found that the lazy rascals had shoved the body into an ant-eater's hole in order to save the trouble of digging a grave.\"  While Tom and his friends were thus conversing over their pipes, their attention was attracted by a peculiar cry or howl of terror, such as they had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21740"],["title","The Iron Horse (#0)"],["body","IRON HORSE, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  TREATS OF THE ENGINE-DRIVER'S HOUSE AND HOUSEHOLD.  Talk of earthquakes! not all the earthquakes that have rumbled in Ecuador or toppled over the spires and dwellings of Peru could compare, in the matter of dogged pertinacity, with that earthquake which diurnally and hourly shocked little Gertie's dwelling, quivered the white dimity curtains of little Gertie's bed and shook little Gertie's frame.  A graceful, rounded little frame it was; yet strong, and firmly knit--perhaps in consequence of its having been from infancy so constantly and so well shaken together.  Her neat little body was surmounted by a head which no sculptor in search of an antique model would have chosen.  Gertie's profile was not Grecian; her features were not classic--but they were comely, and rosy, and so sweet that most people wanted to kiss them, and many people did. Gertie did not object.  Probably, being only six, she imagined that this was the ordinary and natural method of salutation.  Yet it was observable that the child did not reciprocate kisses except in one or two special cases.  She had evidently a mind of her own, a fact which was displayed most strikingly, in the passionate manner in which she reciprocated the embraces of John Marrot, her father, when that large hairy individual came in of an evening, and, catching her in his long arms, pressed her little body to his damp pilot-cloth-coated breast and her chubby face to his oily, smoke-and-soot begrimed countenance, forgetful for the moment of the remonstrance from his wife that was sure to follow:--  \"Now then, John, there you go again.  You ain't got no more power of subjewin' your feelings than one of your own ingines, w'ich is the schreechin'ist, fizzin'ist, crashin'ist, bustin' things I ever 'ad the misfortune to 'ave to do with.  There's a clean frock just put on this mornin' only fit for the wash-tub now?\"  But John was an easy-going man.  He was mild, kind, sedate, undemonstrative by nature, and looked upon slight matrimonial breezes as being good for the health.  It was only Gertie who could draw him into demonstrations of feeling such as we have described, and, as we have said, she always reciprocated them violently, increasing thereby the wash-tub necessity tenfold.  It would have been strange indeed if John Marrot could have been much put about by a small matrimonial breeze, seeing that his life was spent in riding on an iron monster with white-hot lungs and boiling bowels which carried him through space day and night at the rate of fifty miles an hour!  This, by the way, brings us back to our text--earthquakes.  Gertie's house--or Gertie's father's house, if you prefer it--stood close to the embankment of one of our great arterial railways--which of them, for reasons best known to ourself, we don't intend to tell, but, for the reader's comfort, we shall call it the Grand National Trunk Railway.  So close did the house stand to the embankment that timid female passengers were known occasionally to scream as they approached it, under the impression that the train had left the rails and was about to dash into it--an impression which was enhanced and somewhat justified by the circumstance that the house stood with one of its corners; instead of its side, front, or back; towards the line; thereby inducing a sudden sensation of wrongness in the breasts of the twenty thousand passengers who swept past it daily.  The extreme edge of its most protruding stone was exactly three yards four inches--by measurement-- from the left rail of the down line.  Need we say more to account for the perpetual state of earthquakedom, in which that house was involved?  But the tremors and shocks to which it was exposed--by night and by day--was not all it had to bear.  In certain directions of the wind it was intermittently enveloped in clouds of mingled soot and steam, and, being situated at a curve on the line where signalling became imminently needful, it was exposed to all the varied horrors of the whistle from the sharp screech of interrogation to the successive bursts of exasperation, or the prolonged and deadly yell of intimidation, with all the intermediate modulations--so that, what with the tremors, and shocks, and crashes, and shrieks, and thunderous roar of trains, Gertie's father's house maintained an upright front in circumstances that might have been equalled but could not have been surpassed by those of the Eddystone Lighthouse in the wildest of winter storms, while it excelled that celebrated building in this, that it faced a storm which knew no calm, but raged furiously all the year round.  John Marrot was an engine-driver on the Grand National Trunk Railway. This is equivalent to saying that he was a steady, sober, trustworthy man.  None but men of the best character are nowadays put in so responsible a position.  Nearly all the drivers on the line were of this kind--some better than others, no doubt, but all good.  Of course there are exceptions to every rule.  As in the best regulated families accidents will happen, so, on the best conducted lines, an occasional black sheep will get among the drivers, but this is the exception that proves the rule.  The rule in the Grand National Trunk Railway was--get the best drivers and pay them well.  The same may be said of the firemen, whose ambition was ultimately to drive the iron chargers which they fed.  Besides being all that we have said, John was a big, burly, soft-hearted, hard-headed man, who knew that two and two in ordinary circumstances made four, and who didn't require to be told that his left foot was not his right one.  It was generally supposed that John Marrot had no nerves, and that his muscles had imbibed some of the iron of which his engine was composed. This was a mistake, though there was some truth in both suppositions.  John's family consisted of himself when at home, which, although often, was never for long; his wife--fat and fair, capable of being roused, but, on the whole, a good, sensible, loving woman; his eldest daughter, Lucy or Loo--nineteen, dark, pretty, and amiable; his youngest daughter, Gertrude, _alias_ Gertie--six, sunny and serious, at least as serious as was possible for one so young, so innocent, so healthy, and so happy as she; his son Bob, aged twelve, who was a lamp-boy at the great station not far off, and of whom it may be briefly said that he was \"no better than he should be,\" and, lastly, the baby--not yet at the walking period of life, with a round head, round body, round eyes, and a round dozen at least--if not more--of hairs standing straight up on the top of his bald pate, suggesting the idea that he must at some period of his life have been singed by a passing locomotive--an event not by any means beyond the bounds of possibility, for it may be written, with more truth of this, than of any other infant, that he had been born and nurtured amid thunder, smoke, and blazes.  As might have been expected in the circumstances, he was a powerful baby.  We cannot afford space for a full description, but it would be wrong to omit mention of the strength of his lungs.  The imitative tendency of children is proverbial.  Clearly the locomotive was baby Marrot's pattern in many things.  No infant that ever drew breath equalled this one at a yell.  There was absolutely a touch of sublimity in the sound of the duet--frequently heard--when baby chanced to be performing a solo and his father's engine went shrieking past with a running accompaniment!  It is a disputed point to this day which of the two beat the other; and it is an admitted fact that nothing else could equal either.  There were two other inmates of John Marrot's house--not members of the family.  One was his fireman, William Garvie, who lodged with him, the other a small servant or maid-of-all-work who led a rugged existence, but appeared to enjoy it, although it kept her thin.  Her name was Ann Stocks, familiarly known as Nanny.  We are thus particular in describing the engine-driver's household because, apart from other reasons, a group of human beings who could live, and thrive, and eat, and sleep, and love, and learn, and so forth, in such circumstances is noteworthy.  It was quite a treat--believe it, reader--to see little Gertie and the baby slumber while the engines were apparently having \"a night of it\" outside!  Come with us and behold.  It is 10:30 p.m.  Father is crossing country on the limited mail at any pace you choose between fifty and eighty miles an hour, time having been lost at the last station, owing to the unaccountable disappearance of a first-class passenger, and time having to be made up by fair means or otherwise.  His mate stands beside him.  In the family mansion pretty Loo sleeps like a \"good angel,\" as she is, in a small room farthest from the corner next the line, but with her we have nothing to do at present.  Nanny, also sound asleep, lies in some place of profound obscurity among the coals in the lower regions of the house, laying in that store of health and vigour which will enable her to face the rugged features of the following day.  We dismiss her, also, with the hope that she may survive the coal-dust and the lack of oxygen, and turn to the chief room of the house--the kitchen, parlour, dining-room, drawing-room, nursery, and family bedroom all in one. Engine-drivers are not always so badly off for space in their domiciles, but circumstances which are not worth mentioning have led John Marrot to put up with little.  In this apartment, which is wonderfully clean and neat, there are two box-beds and a sort of crib.  Baby sleeps--as only babies can--in perfect bliss in the crib; Gertie slumbers with her upturned sweet little face shaded by the white dimity curtains in one bed; Mrs Molly Marrot snores like a grampus in the other.  It is a wide bed, let deep into the wall, as it were, and Mrs M's red countenance looms over the counterpane"]]]
