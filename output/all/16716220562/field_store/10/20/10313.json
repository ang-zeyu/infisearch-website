We had now reached this point.  The day before that on which we encamped in the woods, as above related, we arrived at a native village, and had been received kindly by the king.  Almost immediately after our arrival we heard so many stories about gorillas that I felt persuaded we should fall in with one if we went a-hunting, and being exceedingly anxious to add one to my collection of animals--for I had a small museum at home--I prevailed on Jack and Peterkin to go one day's journey into the bush to look for them.  They laughed very much at me indeed, and said that we were still very far away from the gorilla country; but I had read in some work on Africa a remark to the effect that there is no cordillera, or mountain range, extending across the whole continent to limit the _habitat_ of certain classes of animals, and I thought that if any animal in Africa would not consent to remain in one region when it wished to go to another, that animal must be the ferocious gorilla.  The trader also laughed at me, and said that he had never seen any himself in that region, and that we would have to cross the desert before seeing them.  Still, I felt a disposition to try; besides, I felt certain that we should at least fall in with some sort of animals or plants or minerals that would be worth collecting; so it was agreed that we should go out for a single day, and be back in time for a great elephant-hunt which was about to take place.  But to return from this digression.  Having finished breakfast, we made three bundles or packages of our blankets, provisions, and camp equipage; strapped them on our backs; and then, shouldering our rifles, set out on our return to the negro village.  Of course we gave Jack the largest and heaviest bundle to carry. Peterkin's and mine were about equal, for although I was taller than Peterkin, I was not by any means so powerful or active.  I often wondered at the great strength that lay in the little frame of my friend.  To look at him, no one would believe that he was such a tough, wiry, hardy little fellow.  He was the same hearty, jovial creature that I had lived with so pleasantly when he and Jack and I were cast away on the coral island.  With the exception of a small scrap of whisker on each cheek, a scar over the right eye, and a certain air of manliness, there was little change in my old comrade.  \"Ralph,\" said Jack, as we strode along through the forest, \"do you remember how we three used to wander about together in the woods of our coral island?\"  \"Remember!\"  I cried with enthusiasm, for at that moment the thought occurred to my own mind; \"how can I ever forget it, Jack?  It seems to me just like yesterday.  I can hardly believe that six long years have passed since we drank that delicious natural lemonade out of the green cocoa-nuts, and wandered on the coral beach, and visited Penguin Island, and dived into the cave to escape the pirates.  The whole scene rises up before me so vividly that I could fancy we were still there.  Ah! these were happy times.\"  \"So they were,\" cried Peterkin; \"but don't you go and become sentimentally sad, Ralph, when you talk of those happy days.  If we were happy there, are we not happy _here_?--There's no change in us--except, indeed, that Jack has become a gorilla.\"  \"Ay, and you a monkey,\" retorted Jack.  \"True; and Ralph a naturalist, which is the strangest beast of all,\" added Peterkin.--\"Can you tell me, Ralph, by the way, what tree that is?\"  \"I'm sure I cannot tell.  Never saw or heard of one like it before,\" I replied, looking at the tree referred to with some interest.  It was a fine tree, but the great beauty about it was the gorgeous fruit with which it was laden.  It hung in the form of bunches of large grapes, and was of the brightest scarlet colour.  The glowing bunches seemed like precious gems glittering amongst the green foliage, and I observed that a few monkeys and several parrots were peeping at us through the branches.  \"It seems good for food,\" said Jack.  \"You'd better climb up, Peterkin, and pull a few bunches.  The puggies won't mind you, of course, being one of themselves.\"  \"Ralph,\" said Peterkin, turning to me, and deigning no reply to Jack, \"you call yourself a naturalist; so I suppose you are acquainted with the habits of monkeys, and can turn your knowledge to practical account.\"  \"Well,\" I replied, \"I know something about the monkey tribes, but I cannot say that at this moment I remember any particular habit of which we might avail ourselves.\"  \"Do you not?  Well, now, that's odd.  I'm a student of nature myself, and I have picked up a little useful knowledge in the course of my travels.  Did you ever travel so far as the Zoological Gardens in London?\"  \"Of course I have done so, often.\"  \"And did you ever observe a peculiar species of monkey, which, when you made a face at it, instantly flew into a towering passion, and shook the bars of its cage until you expected to see them broken?\"  \"Yes,\" said I, laughing; \"what then?\"  \"Look here, you naturalist, and I'll put a wrinkle on your horn.  Yonder hangs a magnificent bunch of fruit that I very much desire to possess.\"  \"But it's too high to reach,\" said I.  \"But there's a monkey sitting beside it,\" said Peterkin.  \"I see.  You don't expect him to pull it and throw it down, do you?\"  \"Oh no, certainly not; but--\" Here Peterkin stepped up to the tree, and looking up at the monkey, said, \"O-o-o-oo-o!\" angrily.  \"_O-o-o-oo-oo_!\" replied the monkey, stretching out its neck and looking down with an expression of surprise and indignation, as if to say, \"What on earth do you mean by that?\"  \"Oo-o-o-oo-o!\" roared Peterkin.  Hereupon the monkey uttered a terrific shriek of passion, exposed all its teeth and gums, glared at its adversary like a little fiend, and seizing the branch with both hands, shook it with all its might.  The result was, that not only did the coveted bunch of fruit fall to the ground, but a perfect shower of bunches came down, one of which hit Jack on the forehead, and, bursting there, sent its fragrant juice down his face and into his beard, while the parrots and all the other monkeys took to flight, shrieking with mingled terror and rage.  \"You see I'm a practical man,\" observed Peterkin quietly, as he picked up the fruit and began to eat it.  \"Knowledge is power, my boy.  A man with a philosophical turn of mind like yourself ought to have been up to a dodge of this sort.  How capital this fruit is, to be sure!--Does it make good pomade, Jack?\"  \"Excellent; but as I'm not in the habit of using pomade, I shall wash this out of my beard as quickly as possible.\"  While Jack went to a brook that ran close to where we stood, I tasted the fruit, and found it most excellent, the pulp being juicy, with a very pleasant flavour.  While we were thus engaged a wild pig ran grunting past us.  \"Doesn't that remind you of some of our doings on the coral island, Ralph?\" said Peterkin.  Before I could reply a herd of lovely small gazelles flew past.  Our rifles were lying on the ground, and before either of us could take aim the swift creatures were lost sight of in the thick underwood.  Peterkin fired one shot at a venture, but without any result.  We were still deploring our stupidity in not having our rifles handy, when a strange sound was heard in the distance.  By this time Jack had come up, so we all three seized our rifles and listened intently.  The sound was evidently approaching.  It was a low, dull, booming roar, which at one moment seemed to be distant thunder, at another the cry of some huge animal in rage or pain.  Presently the beating of heavy hoofs on the turf and the crash of branches were heard.  Each of us sprang instinctively towards a tree, feeling that if danger were near its trunk would afford us some protection.  Being ignorant, as yet, of the cries of the various wild beasts inhabiting those woods, we were greatly at a loss to determine what creature it could be that approached at such headlong speed.  That its mad career was caused by fear soon became apparent, for the tones of terror either in man or beast, when distinctly heard, cannot be mistaken.  Immediately in front of the spot where we stood was an open space or glade of considerable extent.  Towards this the animal approached, as was evident from the increasing loudness of its wild roar, which was almost continuous.  In another moment the thick wall of underwood at its farther extremity was burst asunder with a crash, and a wild buffalo bull bounded into the plain and dashed madly across.  On its neck was crouched a leopard, which had fixed its claws and teeth deep in the flesh of the agonised animal.  In vain did the bull bound and rear, toss and plunge.  At one moment it ran like the wind; the next it stopped with such violence as to tear up the turf and scatter it around.  Then it reared, almost falling back; anon it plunged and rushed on again, with the foam flying from its mouth, and its bloodshot eyes glaring with the fire of rage and terror, while the woods seemed to tremble with its loud and deep-toned bellowing.  Twice in its passage across the open glade it ran, in its blind fury, straight against a tree, almost beating in its skull, and for a moment arresting its progress; but it instantly recovered the shock and burst away again as madly as ever.  But no effort that it was capable of making could relieve the poor creature from its deadly burden, or cause the leopard in the slightest degree to relax its fatal gripe.  It chanced that the wild bull's mad gallop was in a direction that brought it within a few yards of the spot where we stood, so we prepared to put an end to its misery.  As it drew near, Jack, who was in advance, raised his rifle.  I, being only a short distance from him, also made ready to fire,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21736"],["title","The Gorilla Hunters (#6)"],["body"," I confess that in the agitation of the moment I could not make up my mind whether I should fire at the buffalo or the leopard.  As far as I can recall my rapid and disjointed thoughts on that exciting occasion, I reasoned thus: \"If I shoot the leopard the bull will escape, and if I shoot the bull the leopard will escape.\"  It did not occur to me at that trying moment, when self-possession and decision were so necessary, that I might shoot the bull with one barrel, and the leopard with the other.  Still less did it occur to me that I might miss bull and leopard altogether.  While I was engaged in this hurried train of troubled thought, Jack fired both barrels of his rifle, one after the other, as quickly as possible.  The bull stumbled forward upon its knees.  In order to make assurance doubly sure, I aimed at its head and fired both barrels at once.  Instantly the bull rose, with a hideous bellow, and stood for one moment irresolute, glaring at its new enemies.  The leopard, I observed, was no longer on its back.  At this moment I heard an exclamation of anger, and looking round I observed Peterkin struggling violently in the grasp of one of the wild vines or thorny plants which abound in some parts of the African forests and render them almost impassable.  It seems that as the bull drew near, Peterkin, who, like Jack and me, was preparing to shoot, found that a dense thicket came between him and the game, so as to prevent his firing.  He leaped nimbly over a bush, intending to run to another spot, whence he could more conveniently take aim, but found himself, as I have related, suddenly entangled among the thorns in such a way that the more he struggled the more firmly he became ensnared.  Being of an impatient disposition, he did struggle violently, and it was this, probably, that attracted the attention of the bull and decided its future course and its ultimate fate; for after remaining one moment, as I have stated, in an irresolute attitude, it turned suddenly to the left and rushed, with its head down and its tail up, straight at Peterkin.  I cannot describe the sensations that overwhelmed me on observing the imminent danger of my friend.  Horror almost overwhelmed me as I gazed with a stare of fascination at the frightful brute, which with flashing eyes and bloody foam dripping from its mouth charged into the thicket, and crashed through the tough boughs and bushes as if they were grass. A film came over my eyes.  I tried to reload my rifle, but my trembling hand refused to act, and I groaned with mingled shame and despair on finding myself thus incapable of action in the hour of extreme peril. At that moment I felt I would joyfully have given my own life to have saved that of Peterkin.  It takes me long to describe it, but the whole scene passed with the rapidity almost of a flash of light.  Jack did not even attempt to load, but uttering a fearful cry, he sprang towards our friend with a bound like that of an enraged tiger.  A gleam of hope flashed through my soul as I beheld his gigantic form dash through the underwood.  It seemed to me as if no living creature could withstand such a furious onset.  Alas for Peterkin, had his life depended on Jack, strong and lion-like though he was!  His aid could not have been in time.  A higher Power nerved his arm and steeled his heart at that terrible moment.  As I gazed helplessly at Peterkin, I observed that he suddenly ceased his struggles to get free, and throwing forward the muzzle of his piece, stood boldly up and awaited the onset with calm self-possession.  The bull was on him almost in an instant.  One stride more and he would have been lost, but that stride was never taken.  His rifle poured its deadly charge into the skull of the wild bull, which fell a mass of dead flesh, literally at his feet.  It were vain to attempt to describe the state of our feelings on this memorable occasion--the fervour with which we thanked our heavenly Father for our friend's deliverance--the delight with which we shook his hands, again and again, and embraced him.  It was with considerable difficulty that we extricated Peterkin from his entanglement.  When this was accomplished we proceeded to examine our prize.  We were not a little puzzled on discovering that only three bullets had struck the bull.  For my part, I fired straight at its forehead, and had felt certain at the time that my shots had taken effect; yet there was but one ball in the animal's head, and that was undoubtedly Peterkin's, for the hair all round the hole was singed off, so near had it been to him when he fired.  The other two shots were rather wide apart--one in the shoulder, the other in the neck.  Both would have proved mortal in the long run, but neither was sufficiently near to a vital spot to kill speedily.  \"Now, Ralph, my boy,\" said Jack, after our excitement was in some degree abated, \"you and I must divide the honour of these two shots, for I fear we can't tell which of us fired them.  Peterkin only fired once, and that was pretty effectual.\"  \"Yes,\" I replied, \"it is rather perplexing; for although I have no objection whatever to your having all the honour of those two shots, still one likes to know with certainty who actually made them.\"  \"You'd better toss for them,\" suggested Peterkin, who was seated on the trunk of a fallen tree, examining, with a somewhat rueful countenance, the tattered condition of his garments.  \"There would not be much satisfaction in that,\" replied Jack, laughing.  \"It is probable,\" said I, \"that each of us hit with one barrel and missed with the other.\"  \"And it is possible,\" added Jack, \"that one of us hit with both, and the other missed with both.  All that I can positively affirm is that I fired both barrels at his shoulder--one after the other.\"  \"And all that I am certain of,\" said I, \"is that I fired both barrels at his forehead, and that I discharged them both at once.\"  \"Did you?\" said Peterkin, looking up quickly; \"then, Ralph, I'm afraid you must give all the honour to Jack, for you have missed altogether.\"  \"How do you know that?\"  I asked, in a somewhat piqued tone.  \"Simply enough.  If you fired both shots together at so short a distance, they would have been found close together wherever they had struck, whereas the two shots in the neck and shoulder are more than two feet apart.\"  I was compelled to admit that there was much truth in the observation, but still felt unwilling to give up all claim to having assisted in slaying our first buffalo.  I pondered the subject a good deal during the remainder of the time we spent in cutting up and packing part of the buffalo meat, and in preparing to continue our journey, but could come at no satisfactory conclusion in my own mind, and, to say truth, I felt not a little crestfallen at my conduct in the whole affair.  While wandering in this mood near the spot where the buffalo had been first wounded, I received a sudden and severe start on observing the leopard crouching within a couple of yards of me.  I saw it through the bushes quite distinctly, but could not make quite sure of its attitude. With a mingled cry of alarm and astonishment I sprang back to the place where I had left my rifle.  Jack and Peterkin instantly ran up with their pieces cocked.  \"Where is it?\" they cried in a breath.  \"There, crouching just behind that bush.\"  Jack darted forward.  \"Crouching!\" he cried, with a loud laugh, seizing the animal by the tail and dragging it forth; \"why, it's dead--stone dead.\"  \"Dead as mutton,\" said Peterkin.  \"Hallo! what's this?\" he added in surprise.  \"Two holes close together in its forehead, I do declare! Hooray!  Ralph, my boy, give us your paw!  You've missed the bull and hit the leopard!  If you haven't been and put two bullets right between its two eyes, I'm a Dutchman!\"  And so, in truth, it turned out.  I had aimed at the bull and hit the leopard.  So I left that spot not a little pleased with my bad aim and my good fortune.    CHAPTER FOUR.  WHEREIN WILL BE FOUND MUCH THAT IS PHILOSOPHICAL.  Having skinned the leopard and cut off as much of the buffalo meat as we could carry, we started for the negro village at a round pace, for we had already lost much time in our last adventure.  As we walked along I could not help meditating on the uncertainty of this life, and the terrible suddenness with which we might at any unexpected moment be cut off.  These thoughts led me naturally to reflect how important a matter it is that every one, no matter how young, should be in a state of preparedness to quit this world.  I also reflected, and not without a feeling of shame, on my want of nerve, and was deeply impressed with the importance of boys being inured from childhood to trifling risks and light dangers of every possible description, such as tumbling into ponds and off trees, etcetera, in order to strengthen their nervous system.  I do not, of course, mean to say that boys ought deliberately to tumble into ponds or climb trees until they fall off; but they ought not to avoid the risk of such mishaps.  They ought to encounter such risks and many others perpetually.  They ought to practise leaping off heights into deep water.  They ought never to hesitate to cross a stream on a narrow unsafe plank _for fear of a ducking_.  They ought never to decline to climb up a tree to pull fruit merely because there is a _possibility_ of their falling off and breaking their necks.  I firmly believe that boys were intended to encounter all kinds of risks, in order to prepare them to meet and grapple with the risks and dangers incident to man's career with cool, cautious self-possession--a self-possession founded on experimental knowledge of the character and powers of their own spirits and muscles.  I also concluded that this reasoning applies to some extent to girls as well as boys, for they too are liable through life to occasional encounters with danger--such as meeting with mad bulls, being run away with on"]]]
