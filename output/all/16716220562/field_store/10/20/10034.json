He feared that Cuffy Bear might be in some sort of trouble.  Nimble looked all about for help. But there wasn't a sign of anybody stirring, anywhere. All the mountain people seemed to have sought shelter from the storm.  At last, however, Peter Mink came sneaking up from the spring. He had set out to follow Broad Brook all the way up to its beginning, on a hunt for meadow mice. And when he set out to do a thing he always finished it, no matter what the weather might be.  \"You're just the person I want to see!\" Nimble cried. \"Will you do me a favor?\"  Now, Peter Mink never did anybody a favor if he could help it. So he promptly said, \"No!\"  \"Won't you go inside this cave for me and see what's happened to Cuffy Bear?\" Nimble implored him. \"He went inside the cave. I promised to wait for him here. And he has been gone for hours.\"  \"I won't go into that cave for anybody,\" Peter Mink declared. \"How do I know you're not trying to play a trick on me? I don't see any Bear tracks in the snow.\"  \"Of course you don't!\" Nimble agreed. \"All this snow has fallen since Cuffy crawled into the cave.\"  \"Why don't you go inside yourself?\" Peter Mink inquired with something very like a sneer.  \"I'm too tall,\" said Nimble. \"Besides, I don't like caves. I keep out of them.\"  \"So do I!\" Peter Mink declared--though everybody knew that he went everywhere--even under the ice along Broad Brook and Swift River.  Poor Nimble didn't know what to do. He felt that he ought to go for help, somewhere. But he had promised Cuffy Bear to wait for him.  Then all at once an idea came to him. Why not send Peter Mink for help?  \"Won't you please go down to Cedar Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to come up here?\" Nimble begged Peter.  \"I can't,\" Peter answered. \"I must go home now.\" And everybody knew that Peter Mink had no home at all! He was the vagabond of the woods.  Nimble saw then that it was useless to look for help from him. And after Peter Mink had gone his surly way Nimble still lingered there. He was hungry. So he began to paw the snow away here and there, to uncover the ground growths. And just as he was nibbling beside a bush somebody said, \"Don't step on me!\"  It was Mr. Grouse, half buried in the snow.  \"I wondered why you were waiting here so long,\" Mr. Grouse told Nimble. \"When I heard you talking to that rascal, Peter Mink, I knew the reason. But I didn't dare speak while he was about.\"  \"Are you going to spend the night here?\" Nimble asked him.  \"Yes!\" said Mr. Grouse. \"I shall be snug and warm after the snow covers me.\"  \"Well, your head won't be covered for some time,\" Nimble told him. \"Are you willing to keep an eye out for Cuffy Bear? I'm going down to Cedar Swamp to get help. And Cuffy Bear might come out of the cave while I'm gone.\"  \"I'd be glad to watch,\" Mr. Grouse replied, \"but it wouldn't be any use.\"  \"Why not?\" Nimble asked him. \"Don't you think we'll see Cuffy again?\"  \"Oh, we'll see him,\" Mr. Grouse answered. \"But it won't be till towards spring. For there's no doubt that Cuffy Bear has fallen into his winter's sleep.\"  And then Nimble exclaimed that Cuffy Bear had yawned as he turned away to enter the cave. He hadn't even begged pardon, nor covered his mouth with a paw.  \"No doubt he was very, very sleepy,\" said Mr. Grouse.     XIII  CUFFY BEAR WAKENS   The winter after Nimble lost his spike horns was a mild one. The snowfall was light. And Nimble was able to roam up and down Pleasant Valley and about Blue Mountain as he pleased.  It happened that a certain bright day in early spring found him far up the side of the mountain, near the cave where he had waited for Cuffy Bear weeks before. And as that whole queer affair came back to his mind Nimble remembered how he had fed upon the green things under the snow.  That thought made him hungry. So he began to paw away the soft heavy snow, which wasn't more than a foot deep; and he was enjoying a good meal when he heard a sudden _woof_ behind him.  Nimble wheeled instantly. And there, at the mouth of the cave, peering over the tangle which screened it, Cuffy Bear stood upon his hind legs, rubbing his eyes. Catching sight of Nimble, Cuffy blinked at him.  \"Where's Nimble Deer, madam?\" Cuffy Bear growled presently.  \"I'm right here!\" Nimble replied. \"But please don't call me 'madam!'\"  \"You're not Nimble Deer. You're a Doe,\" Cuffy Bear insisted. \"You have no horns.\"  \"I'm a Deer,\" Nimble retorted. \"I had horns; but I've shed them.\"  Cuffy Bear _woofed_ a bit more. He seemed to be somewhat ill-tempered.  \"You can't fool me,\" he grunted. \"Nimble Deer's horns were firm upon his head when I left him here and stepped inside this cave. He agreed to wait for me; and I'm surprised that he broke his promise.\"  \"I am Nimble Deer,\" Nimble declared again. \"You led me to this spot from the spring. You told me you wanted to take another look at this cave because you were thinking of making it your winter home.\"  Cuffy Bear eyed Nimble with astonishment. And he shambled up to Nimble and sniffed at him.  \"It _is_ you!\" Cuffy cried at last. \"So you _did_ wait for me!\"  \"No, I didn't,\" Nimble confessed.  \"But here you are!\" Cuffy Bear retorted. \"You _must_ have been waiting for me. And if I've kept you a bit longer than I intended to, I'm sorry. I think I fell asleep in that den and had a short nap.\"  [Illustration: Nimble Deer Tells Cuffy Bear About His Horns.                                                    _Page 71_]  \"A short nap!\" Nimble repeated. \"You've been asleep in there all winter! It's weeks and weeks since I last saw you. And I'm here now only because I happened to wander this way, when I heard old dog Spot baying.\"  Cuffy Bear was so surprised that he couldn't say another word. His mouth fell open. And he gazed blankly at Nimble.  But at last he spoke. \"I must apologize to you,\" he said, \"though it was really no wonder I called you 'madam.' You have changed a great deal since I left you here.\"  \"And you--\" Nimble told him--\"you have changed too.\"  \"I have?\" Cuffy Bear cried. \"How's that? How have I changed?\"  \"You look much hungrier,\" Nimble explained.  Cuffy Bear laid a paw across his waistcoat.  \"I _am_ hungry,\" he admitted. \"And if you're going down the mountain I think I'll stroll along with you and see what I can find to eat.\"  \"Very well!\" Nimble agreed.  \"One moment!\" Cuffy Bear said hastily. \"Just one moment, please! Wait till I go inside my cave! I believe I left my cap in there.\"  \"I'm not going to wait for you,\" Nimble replied firmly. \"For all I know you might not come out again till haying time.\"  And then Nimble trotted off down the mountainside, heading for Cedar Swamp. For he didn't think old dog Spot would wander in that direction.     XIV  ANTLERS   Although Nimble had lost his horns he managed to go through the winter without missing them as much as he had expected. And in time he had almost forgotten the pair of spikes that he had worn on his head the summer before. Then, one day, he made a great discovery. He found that new horns were sprouting to take the place of those that he had lost!  \"Now I can have some mock battles again--when my horns get long enough,\" he thought. And then he stopped short. What if the Spike Horns of the year before had no more horns? If they were hornless they certainly wouldn't care to take part in any mock battles.  Nimble's fears were soon set at rest. His old playmates soon let him know that they were all going to have new horns too.  And then, a little later, Nimble made another great discovery. He was looking into a pool one morning when he saw something that gave him huge delight. His new horns were not like last year's horns. He beheld, mirrored in the water, a handsome pair of Y-shaped antlers, each with two points!  \"Hurrah!\" he cried. \"I'll make those Spike Horns feel like hiding themselves again.\"  He had expected to have a pleasant time showing his new antlers to his old friends. When he met Dodger the Deer, Nimble called to him: \"See what I've got! Antlers! Two points!\"  \"Ho!\" said Dodger. \"So have I got antlers. And they have two points, too.\"  Nimble had been so interested in his own horns that he hadn't looked at Dodger's. And now when he gazed at them he saw that they were like his.  \"What about the rest of the Spike Horns?\" Nimble asked Dodger. \"Have they----\"  \"Yes, they have!\" Dodger interrupted. \"I tell you, 'two-pointers' are common this season.\"  \"So there aren't any more Spike Horns!\" said Nimble somewhat sadly.  \"Oh, yes! Plenty!\" Dodger answered. \"But they're an entirely new crop. They were fawns last year.\"  When he heard that bit of news Nimble felt happier. And as soon as he parted from Dodger the Deer he went and found some of the new Spike Horns and showed them his wonderful two-point antlers.  But somehow they didn't seem at all impressed. They were too much taken up with their own spikes to pay any attention to Nimble.  \"Anyhow,\" he said to himself, \"we 'two-pointers' can have some good mock battles together.\"  And they did. They had mock battles that became famous all around Blue Mountain. And of all the \"two-pointers\" that lived in that neighborhood, Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer were known as the best sham-fighters. They could look fiercer and act angrier than any of their young friends. And the way they tore into each other was almost enough to frighten you, if you had seen them.  Old Mr. Crow said it was worth flying a mile to watch one of their set-tos.     XV  A MOCK BATTLE   When Nimble had three-points on each of his antlers, in his fourth summer, he felt that he was at last grown up. He was now a \"three-pointer.\" Some of the older bucks had no more points than he. Many of them were but \"four-pointers.\" His own father had been a \"five-pointer.\" So Nimble hoped, secretly, that he would have five-point antlers in another two years.  As soon as his new horns were ready Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21619"],["title","The Tale of Nimble Deer (#5)"],["body","their mock battles again. And Nimble found them greater fun than ever.  Dodger was a spry fellow. He was quick as a flash at dodging. When Nimble ran at him with head lowered and horns aimed straight at him Dodger could wait until Nimble all but struck him, before leaping aside. And then Nimble would go rushing past him.  But Dodger did not always dodge when attacked. Sometimes he stood his ground, with his own head lowered in a threatening fashion. And then Nimble checked his headlong rush and merely clashed his horns pleasantly against Dodger's.  There was something about the sound that sent a thrill through Nimble and started his coat to bristling along his backbone with a queer, creepy feeling.  One day in the fall Nimble's mother came upon them in the woods when they were having one of their sham fights.  \"You'd better stop that!\" she said to them severely. \"Somebody will get hurt sooner or later if you're not careful.\"  Nimble and Dodger paid little heed to her warning, except to stop until the good lady had gone on and left them. Then, just as they were on the point of renewing their frolic, somebody spoke in a hoarse voice. It was old Mr. Crow. He sat on a low branch of a spreading pine, where he had been watching the contest for some time without being noticed.  \"I'd have my fun if I wanted to,\" he croaked. \"Ladies are too finicky. They don't know what a good time is.\"  Now, Mr. Crow's remarks pleased Nimble. And they pleased Dodger the Deer. They didn't know that the old gentleman was a famous trouble maker.  So Dodger and Nimble drew a little distance apart, as they always did when they were getting ready to clash.  \"Go it!\" squalled Mr. Crow.  And they started. And Mr. Crow jumped up and down in his excitement.  \"Now there's going to be some real fun,\" he muttered.  But Dodger the Deer leaped aside just in time to avoid being hit. And that didn't please Mr. Crow at all.  \"You fellows aren't half trying,\" he cried impatiently. \"Anyone would think you were a pair of Spike Horns.\"  Now, all Spike Horns were two whole years younger than Dodger and Nimble. So it was no wonder that Mr. Crow's words stung them.  Nimble charged more fiercely than ever. And Dodger stood his ground. With his feet planted firmly beneath him he waited for the blow.  There was a crack and a thud.  \"Ha!\" Mr. Crow squawked. \"That's a little more like it. Dodger didn't dodge that time, to be sure. But he stood still. And only a Spike Horn would stand and _wait_ for the enemy.\"  Of course Dodger couldn't help wanting to show Mr. Crow that he knew how to carry on a mock battle. So the next time Nimble rushed at him Dodger did not wait. He jumped to meet Nimble. They struck in the air with a frightful crash and fell sprawling upon the ground.  \"Ha! That's more like it!\" Mr. Crow applauded. \"That's the sort of mock battle I like to see!\"     XVI  MR. CROW LOOKS ON   Nimble and his friend Dodger the Deer picked themselves up off the ground where they had fallen after their collision in the air. They did not feel any too pleasant. One of Dodger's sharp tines had given Nimble a good prick. And one of Nimble's points had stung Dodger like a hornet's sting.  If only one of them had been pricked the whole affair might have ended differently. For then perhaps only one of them would have lost his temper. As they drew apart they were growing more angry every instant. And when they wheeled and glared at each other old Mr. Crow, who was watching them from his perch in the pine tree, called out: \"Don't stop! Make it lively, now!\"  Nimble gritted his teeth and stamped upon the ground.  \"I'll teach you not to prick me!\" he muttered.  \"I'll make you wish you'd left those new antlers at home!\" cried Dodger the Deer.  \"Don't stop!\" old Mr. Crow urged them once more as he teetered on his perch. \"Let the fun go on!\"  He squalled so loudly that his cousin Jasper Jay heard him half a mile away and came hurrying up to see what was going on. He arrived just in time to see Nimble and Dodger stagger back from another mad charge.  \"What's this? A mock battle?\" Jasper Jay inquired as he settled down beside Mr. Crow.  \"No!\" Mr. Crow replied in muffled tones. \"It is a real one--but they don't know it yet.\"  Next to quarreling himself, old Mr. Crow loved to look on while others wrangled. And though he had no taste himself for actual fighting, he liked to see his neighbors pummel and peck and buffet and bounce one another.  So Mr. Crow enjoyed watching the tilt between Nimble and Dodger the Deer. Neither Mr. Crow, nor his rowdy cousin Jasper Jay, had ever seen so furious a fracas as that one soon became. Sometimes Nimble and Dodger rushed together with such force that it seemed to Mr. Crow their horns must break off. Sometimes they reared and struck each other with their front hoofs.  At first, whenever he felt a hurt Nimble only fought the harder. When Dodger's horns gouged him and his hoofs cut him Nimble butted and thrust and struck all the faster. But for every buffet he repaid Dodger, Dodger gave him another that was heavier than ever.  It was no wonder that in time Nimble began to feel tired. But he didn't let Dodger the Deer know that.  \"This was easy to start,\" Nimble thought, \"but it seems hard to stop. I wish Dodger would run away.\"  In the meantime Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay agreed that the battle was growing tamer every moment.  \"Hustle it up!\" Mr. Crow called to Nimble and Dodger, while Jasper Jay jeered at them both and told them they were mollycoddles.  \"I shouldn't call this a mock battle now,\" Mr. Crow told them. \"It's more like a game of tag.\"  \"If only Dodger would run away!\" Nimble said under his breath. \"I'll stop a minute and see if he won't.\" So he stood still, with his nose all but touching the ground.  Dodger the Deer did not run. But he paused and stood exactly as Nimble was standing.  So they eyed each other for a while. And neither of them said a word.  \"Come!\" cried old Mr. Crow. \"This will never do. Give us more action!\"  And then Dodger the Deer looked up at Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay and spoke.  \"If you want more action why don't you two furnish it?\" he asked.  \"That's a good idea!\" Nimble exclaimed. \"Let's see a mock battle up in the tree!\"  [Illustration: \"Don't Stop!\" Said Old Mr. Crow, to Nimble.                                                  _Page 85_]  But Mr. Crow replied hoarsely that he had to meet a friend down the valley. \"I must be flapping along,\" he said. And off he went.  Jasper Jay grinned and winked at Nimble and Dodger behind Mr. Crow's back. And then with a loud squall--which might have meant almost anything--he too flew away.  \"That was the liveliest mock battle we ever had,\" Nimble remarked to his friend Dodger.  Dodger agreed with what he said.  Nimble's mother gasped when she saw her son a little later.  \"You're a terrible sight!\" she told him severely. \"What have you been doing?\"  \"I've been having fun with Dodger the Deer,\" Nimble explained. \"But to tell the truth, it wasn't as much fun as I had expected.\"     XVII  WHAT BROWNIE WANTED   Nimble Deer had stopped at Brownie Beaver's pond to get a drink. Just as he raised his head from the water he spied Brownie a little way off, on the bank, gnawing at a box alder tree.  \"Good evening!\" Nimble called to him.  \"Good evening!\" Brownie Beaver answered.  \"I see you're busy, as usual,\" Nimble remarked.  \"Yes!\" Brownie replied. \"And what are you doing--if I may ask?\"  \"Oh! I'm just rambling about,\" Nimble explained.  \"Then you're not doing much of anything,\" said Brownie Beaver.  Nimble admitted that he wasn't.  \"Since you're not working, perhaps you'll be willing to help me,\" Brownie suggested.  \"Certainly!\" Nimble cried. He liked Brownie Beaver. Everybody liked him--unless it was Timothy Turtle, who had a grudge against the whole Beaver tribe.  \"Maybe I can make arrangements with you to----\" Brownie began.  \"Of course you can!\" Nimble interrupted.  \"That's very kind of you,\" Brownie said. \"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you.\"  \"You're quite welcome,\" Nimble assured him.  \"You're sure you won't mind!\" Brownie Beaver inquired.  \"Not at all! No, indeed! What is it you want me to do for you? Do you want me to help you roll a log into the water, when you've finished cutting down that tree? I might use my horns for a cant hook, such as the lumbermen have.\"  \"No! It's not that--thank you!\" Brownie Beaver mumbled. He had not stopped working, while he talked. And having some chips in his mouth he did not speak any too clearly.  \"Maybe you'd like me to walk back and forth along the top of your dam and make it firmer,\" Nimble suggested.  \"No, it's not that,\" Brownie told him. \"The dam is firm. It has been here a great many years, ever since my great-great-grandfather's time.... You've noticed my house, I dare say,\" he went on.  \"I have,\" Nimble answered. \"It's a good one, though the chimney looks a bit lopsided, to me. Shall I give it a push and see if I can straighten it?\"  \"No, indeed--thank you!\" said Brownie hurriedly. \"For mercy's sake, don't touch my chimney! I worked a long time to make it. And if I do say so, it's the best one in the whole village.\"  Well, Nimble Deer couldn't guess what it was that Brownie Beaver wanted him to do. He couldn't think of any other way in which he might help.  \"Then what--\" he demanded--\"what is it you want?\"  \"There's something I need for my house,\" Brownie explained.  \"Shingles!\" Nimble cried.  \"No!\" Brownie said, as he shook his head.  \"I hope you don't want a pair of antlers to fasten over your chimney piece!\" Nimble exclaimed. \"I shouldn't care to part with my antlers--not just at present!\"  \"No!\" Brownie said once more.  \"I'm glad of that,\" Nimble replied. For a moment he had been worried.  And then Brownie Beaver told him what he had in mind: \"I need a flag to fly over my house.\"  \"That would be fine,\" Nimble observed. \"But I don't see how I could help you with that.\"  \"I've heard that you have a flag. I thought perhaps you'd let"]]]
