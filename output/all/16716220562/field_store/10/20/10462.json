They have come only to rescue their own people. You must give them up, or there can be no peace. The white chief tells me that if you injure or kill the white men you now have he will hold you responsible, because he is powerful, and is now ready to destroy you and your wives and children, but he does not want to do that. We are here to prevent you from going to the white man's house.\"  The consternation on the faces of the savages, at the appearance of two, was easily discernible. They listened in silence while Ralsea spoke, and, then indicated that they would hold a council and give their answer.  It was evident that the allies were taken by surprise, and it must have been obvious that they had no idea of the force which was in their front. Blakely had wisely stationed pickets to the right and the left, in order to observe their movements, after the first surprise was over.  The conference lasted until night fell, and thus the first object was gained; delay. In the morning one of the chiefs appeared, and Blakely and Ralsea again went to the front.  \"I will give you our answer,\" he said. \"The white man attacked us, and we fought him back. He has killed our warriors, and we will not treat with him at this time.\"  Ralsea replied: \"You have done the same that we have done toward the white man; we were always the first to attack them. They tried to be friendly, but we would not listen to them.\"  \"We will let you know in two suns what our answer is.\" And he withdrew.  \"That means,\" remarked Ralsea, \"that they are waiting for reinforcements.\"  \"So much the better. We will be reinforced much better than they by the time their reinforcements come to hand.\"  \"We must send a runner to the Great White Chief, and tell him to stop the Kurabus from coming to their assistance,\" said Ralsea.  \"That is a wise suggestion,\" answered Blakely; and without delay one was selected and made his way to the Brabos' village.  When the Professor received Blakely's note he called in the Brabo chief, Oma, and said: \"The forces we sent out are preventing the allies from going to our village, and have sent a runner here to inform us that the Kurabus are about to send more warriors to aid our enemies. Select one hundred warriors and let us go to the Kurabus' village and capture the warriors who are there, and also put the villages in our power. This may make them understand that they have no homes to go to unless they come to us.\"  This information delighted Oma, and he hurriedly gathered the warriors, and the Professor concluded to accompany them, as he did not want the warriors to commit any excesses against the villages and inhabitants of their former enemies, or exact any reprisals for the past indignities that some of them had suffered from the Kurabus.  A day's march brought them close to the main village, and scouts were sent to the front to ascertain whether the warriors still remaining in the village had gone forward. Before the scouts could return fully fifty warriors emerged from the village, and were taking up the march to join the allies.  The Professor instructed the warriors under his command to divide into three parties, one to remain with him, and the others to go to the right and to the left, so that the Kurabus would thus be entrapped.  The party marched forward unsuspectingly, directly toward the position occupied by the Professor, and he instructed Oma to show himself and inform them that they were surrounded and that resistance would be useless.  Some, more venturesome than others, started to retreat, but the unexpected appearance of the Professor's warriors drove them back, and without firing a shot or loosing an arrow they submitted. When the Professor appeared they were the more surprised. The whole were marched back to the village, and, although the women tried to escape, all were soon rounded up and brought back.  The captured Kurabus warriors were taken to the Brabos' village, and the women informed that they would not be injured, as the white man did not believe in making war.  The Professor at once sent a runner to Blakely and also to John. Two days afterwards the runner appeared at the Cataract with the following message from the Professor:  \"We captured the Kurabus' village to-day, and all the warriors left there, as they were about to leave to join the forces now before Blakely. We have taken all of them to the Brabos' village, where they will be held. Make the utmost speed with the weapons. In the meantime, I have sent a force to the north to intercept any reinforcements that the Tuolos may forward.\"  The message from Blakely was as follows: \"We arrested the movement of the allies yesterday, and asked why they were determined to attack us. They refused to give an answer, and they are, probably, awaiting reinforcements. My forces are between them and the Cataract, and they will give their answer in two days.\"  All this news was imparted to the people, and the knowledge was received with enthusiasm. It gave the warriors the first glimpse of the value of cooperation, and the benefits of a directing hand in their affairs.  At the Cataract matters were progressing favorably. Reports from Blakely and the Professor assured them that they would have no difficulty, in a few days, in getting at least thirty of the guns ready. Stut proved himself to be the most apt pupil, and nothing interested him as much as the forge and anvil, and John, noticing this, set him to work on the small anvil to forge out arrow heads.  The arrows used by the natives were uniformly of stone, but the metal ones were perfect, and so arranged that, with the ramie fiber, could be readily attached to the shaft. The most deft workers in the making of the native arrows were selected, and together they made up a large quantity of arrows, and Stut seemed to be indefatigable in turning out the heads for the workers.  During this period the larder was not forgotten. The hunters brought in every day an immense quantity of taro, which seemed to be their favorite vegetable.  This is a stemless plant, which has heart-shaped leaves, about a foot long, and the leaves and stalks are prepared by them in the same way that we use spinach and asparagus.  But the tuber, or root, of this vegetable is the most valuable part. It is larger than the common beet, and sometimes grows to a foot or more in length. This was beaten into a pulp by the natives, and made into a bread or pudding.  [Illustration: _Fig. 4. The Taro Plant and Bulb._]  \"I like the taro,\" said George. \"It can be used in so many ways, and I want to try it in the different forms as soon as we have an opportunity.\"  \"In the Sandwich Islands, and in many other places it is the vegetable from which the well-known Poi is made,\" said John.  \"Do you know how it is made?\" asked George.  \"It is beaten up, just as you see them do it here, and then set in the sun to ferment for about three or four days. It is afterwards boiled with fowl, and makes a very pleasant dish, most appetizing and nourishing. The fermented Poi will last for weeks. It is the same as the well-known kalo of the Pacific Island, the yu-tao of China, the sato imo of Japan, and the oto of Central America. A fine dish is made of it by boiling and then covering the leaves with a dressing of cocoanut oil.\"  Harry and the other boys had been in consultation for several days concerning the cave, and a day or two before they were ready to start had a talk with John about the treasure there. John listened attentively, and when they had finished, said:  \"You are quite right in wanting to take care of the valuables there. You are entitled to them.\"  \"But they are yours, as much as ours, and we shall not touch them unless it is with the understanding that you shall share with us,\" responded George.  \"I could not consider it for a moment.\"  \"You cannot help yourself,\" said the boys in chorus. \"We have arranged all that matter, and you have nothing to say about it.\"  \"But,\" protested John. \"I do not deserve it.\"  \"Well, do we?\" asked Harry.  \"But you and the Professor discovered it.\"  \"Before you or Ralph and Tom came we arranged the division, so that the Professor has one-third of it, but we own two-thirds, and that we propose to divide equally among all of us,\" added Harry.  \"Really,\" said Ralph, \"Tom and I are in the same position as John, and we feel it is not right to take a share, but the boys insist on it.\"  \"Well, if you consider that a settlement, I must say that I am going to make good more than my share and the shares of Ralph and Tom.\"  \"We don't want you to make it good,\" insisted George.  \"But you can't help yourself in that. The cave in the Tuolos' country has something in it that will make you wonder as much as the treasure you have here, and it will be fully as interesting to get at and recover as anything you have experienced here.\"  \"When do you think we ought to start for the west?\" asked Harry.  \"Day after to-morrow will see everything ready. We shall then have all the ammunition sufficient to last us until we can reestablish the plant, and as the new wagon is ready, it should not take us more than a day, with all the help we have, to load and apportion the different loads among the warriors.\"  \"Then why can't we take to-morrow for the expedition to the cave?\"  \"That will suit admirably,\" he replied.  On the following morning the boys had the yaks yoked up, and taking with them a number of the copper vessels, and a quantity of the ramie cloth, drove over to the side of the hill opposite the Cataract house, so as to reach the land entrance of the caverns.  \"It is not desirable to have any here know of our visit nor our purpose. It would not make any material difference, as the treasure there is of no value to them; but our motives will be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21832"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: Conquest of the Savages (#7)"],["body","derstood,\" remarked John.  Under the circumstances John and the four boys were the only ones in the party.  \"We are going to have some pretty tough work this morning. That gold weighs something.\"  \"Wasn't it a good thing you suggested the making the wagon?\"  John smiled without saying anything.  The boys eyed him sharply, and finally Harry said: \"That is what you suggested the new wagon for, was it not?\"  John nodded an assent.  \"Did the Professor say anything to you about bringing it along?\"  \"He did say it might be taken if you thought so.\"  \"Didn't he suggest that we should do so?\"  \"No; he said the matter was left entirely to your judgment, and that I should not say anything about it, unless you proposed that course.\"  \"Well, I am thinking we shall have a pretty good load for one team with what we get out of the place,\" said George.  \"It will make a good load, but we can add to it the lightest parts of the stock we have at the Cataract.\"  Before reaching the mouth of the cavern, a messenger hurried over from the Cataract with the information that two runners had arrived from the Professor and from Blakely, and they drove back as quickly as possible, and reached there to learn that another had just arrived from Blakely.  The two runners first to arrive conveyed the information stated in the previous chapter, but the last carried the additional news that there had been a fight between Blakely and the tribes, and that he was slowly moving back to the Cataract, but there was no occasion for alarm.  The latter part of the note read as follows: \"Do not be alarmed and continue your work, and if the matter should be at all serious I will advise you by runner in ample time, and shall in any event send another in the next four hours.\"  John called in Muro and said:  \"The forces with Blakely are having a fight with the tribes. I want you to take fifty men, and also twenty-five guns, and assist Blakely and his warriors, and keep me informed of the progress of events. Tell him that by day after to-morrow we shall be on our way. In the meantime you should draw them this way, as we do not want them to go back. For that purpose keep up the show of retreating, and hold them until day after to-morrow.\"  Within an hour the column was ready and moved toward the scene with celerity, equipped with the new guns, and an ample supply of ammunition, together with the new arrows which had been made.     CHAPTER IV  THE SURRENDER OF THE KURABUS   It was late that afternoon before John and the boys again drove over to the hill, and lost no time in entering the cave. The first care was to bring to the steps at the entrance all the vessels in the first recess.  Some of them were so heavy that it was necessary for four to carry each load. They then proceeded to the inner recess, and here a search was made for every trace of the treasures there, the time required thus making it almost dark before they were able to carry out all the different lots.  These were all stored in the bottom of the wagon. It was dark as they started for the Cataract. As they were leaving they heard the night cry of a bird which had often been noticed before, and Ralph shuddered, as he said:  \"It makes me tremble whenever I hear that doleful sound. It was above our head all of the night before the Tuolos captured us, and since that time it always sounded like an omen to me.\"  John turned to him, as he replied: \"That is the voice of the bird called by the Spanish, Alma Perdida.\"  \"Well it isn't a pleasant sound, to say the least,\" added George.  \"It is very significant at this time, however,\" remarked John.  The boys all turned to him, as he continued: \"It is the 'Cry of the Lost Soul'; that is what the name signifies.\"  And the boys thought of the terrible tragedy in the cave they had just left. The silence on the way home was significant.  The next morning marked the greatest activity in and about the buildings. The wagons were first loaded with the things contained in the shop, the laboratory and the home. Numerous packages were made up in form for the warriors to handle conveniently. Nothing was permitted to remain, as it was felt that the things they had made were too valuable to leave behind. It was past noon before the last articles were secured in bundles.  \"You should explain to them, Uraso,\" said John, \"that we shall have to give them pretty heavy loads for the first part of the journey, as the different things can be distributed to the others when we reach them.\"  \"It will not be necessary to do this,\" he answered; \"they are only too glad to carry the heaviest loads.\" And he refused to apologize to the warriors. This is referred to for the purpose of showing the spirit in which all of them worked to bring the things to their own country.  After the loads were all provided for, and the different ones instructed as to the parts which should be taken by each, John said:  \"There is one thing which must now take our attention, and that is the bringing in of the flag.\"  The boys had forgotten this. \"You may tell the warriors,\" said John, addressing Uraso, \"that we intend to go to the hill and bring in the flag, which must be taken with us.\"  As Uraso interpreted this to the people it had a remarkable significance to them. Uraso begged permission to take all of them on the expedition, and this was readily assented to.  The warriors all armed, as though going forth to battle, ascended the hill, with the boys in the lead. Arriving there John formed the column in a circle around the staff. Angel was present, and he shambled toward the pole and mounted it. He remembered the little wheel at the top, which had afforded them such an amusing incident when it was erected.  This time he came down without much solicitation on the part of George.  \"As George and Harry were the ones to hoist the flag, I shall delegate them to lower it,\" said John.  The boys went forward, and at the quiet suggestion of John took off their hats. At this signal John took off his, and Uraso followed suit, and the hint was sufficient for the warriors, who stood with uncovered heads while the boys reverently lowered it.  The wonder and amazement depicted on the faces of those who witnessed it was a spectacle. What an impressive thing it was to them; it was the mystery, which to the savage mind is always an important factor, and John knew it.  The flag was folded with the greatest care, the natives watching each move with intense interest, and was then wrapped in cloth, as though it was the most valuable treasure in the world.  \"We want them to feel that it is something they must love and protect. It is safe to say, that after this exhibition, everyone of the warriors would have fought to the death to preserve that emblem of power, like the Israelites of old, who regarded the Ark of the Covenant as their fortress and strength.\"  The last night at the Cataract was a sad one for the boys. For a year and a half it had been their home. They had built every part of it. Each portion had some delicious memory connected with it, and all must now be left to the ravishes of time. Only the water wheel would be left.  It hardly seems possible that the accumulations at the Cataract would make over one hundred packages, aside from the contents of the wagon. When the entire stock of material was arranged the next morning, it was an interesting sight.  The two wagons were driven out from the yard, Harry and Tom in charge of one, and George and Ralph of the other team. Twenty-five light loads had been made for the advance warriors, so that in case of scouting work, one could take the loads of two, and thus leave at least a dozen free for that duty when required.  A quantity of lumber had been cut over six months before, and this was well dried, and would be very valuable to them in beginning operations, and the loads on the wagons were so great that but little of it could be taken in that way. Uraso saw the utility of the material and insisted that it should all be taken.  Besides the packages thus arranged the most expert of the warriors carried the thirty-two guns, and they had been instructed in their use. Each also carried a bow and set of arrows, and some of them were provided with spears.  During the preceding day no message had come from Blakely, but he knew that the party would leave the Cataract on this day, and they felt no apprehension on his account.  One of the runners from John reached the Professor on the day the train left the Cataract. While the latter tried to prevent the knowledge of his occupation of the Kurabus village from reaching the ears of the warriors, the scouts sent out by the Professor intercepted and tried to capture the messengers which were sent to inform the allies, but failed in their efforts.  When John and his party left, Blakely had drawn the allies to a point within eight miles of the Cataract, and with the reinforcements, headed by Muro, he made a stand. During the night, after a consultation with Muro, the latter, with fifty of his warriors, made a wide detour to the north, and swung around to the west, thus taking a position behind the allies, and this was effected without their knowledge, as they believed.  The object of this movement was to protect the Professor, as the force from the Cataract, joined to that of Blakely's, would be ample to drive them forward, and it was desirable to effect a capture of the allies, and thus at one operation place them in their power.  Unfortunately, the messengers from the Kurabus' village reached the allies before Muro started on his trip. The effect on the allies was startling, and the Kurabus were determined to protect their homes. The latter believed that the object was to destroy the village and carry off the women and children, and it was but natural that they should go to their assistance.  As a result the allies during the night quietly stole to the south, which was in the direction of the Illyas' territory, intending to march"]]]
