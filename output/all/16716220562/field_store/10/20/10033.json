The woods aren't afire, are they?\" And she lifted her nose and sniffed at the air. But she could find no trace of smoke.  Somehow Nimble began to feel ill at ease. He edged away from his mother and tried to hide behind Jimmy Rabbit. And that was a ridiculous thing to do; because Nimble was ever so much the bigger of the two.  Presently his mother gave him a sharp look. And then he, too, raised his muzzle and sniffed.  \"I don't smell any smoke,\" he stammered.  \"Do you know why there's such a crowd here?\" she asked him sternly.  \"I think,\" he said, \"they expect to go to the garden patch with us.\"  And his mother wondered, then, why she hadn't guessed the secret instantly.     VI  AN UNEXPECTED PARTY   Nimble's mother's plans went all awry. She had expected to give her son a treat by taking him quietly to Farmer Green's carrot patch, so that he might have his first taste of carrots. So it wasn't strange that it upset her a bit when she found that there were dozens of other forest folk all ready and waiting to go along with them. One extra member of the party wouldn't have displeased her, especially when that one was Jimmy Rabbit. But she had never gone near the farm buildings with more than two others. And she didn't intend to break her rule now.  Besides, it annoyed her above all to know that her son had spread the news of the excursion far and wide.  \"Did you _invite_ these people?\" she asked Nimble in a low voice.  \"No! Oh, no!\"  \"Then what brings them here?\" she demanded.  \"Their legs, I suppose,\" he replied.  \"Be careful!\" she said. \"Be very careful!\"  Then Nimble began to whine. And that was something he almost never did.  \"They said they'd like to come,\" he told his mother. \"And I said maybe you wouldn't mind.\"  \"Well, I do mind,\" she declared firmly. \"When I take a child to the carrot patch for the first time I don't want company. One of this crowd is more than likely to rouse old dog Spot. And we can't have him ranging around while we're dining.\"  \"Then tell everybody to go home!\" Nimble suggested. \"Tell them to go 'way!\"  \"No!\" said his mother. \"That wouldn't be polite.\"  She was silent for a few moments. And then she explained to Jimmy Rabbit and to the owners of the pairs of eyes that still stared at her out of the darkness. She explained that on account of an unexpected party she wasn't going to the carrot patch that night.  \"When are you going?\" asked the owner of one pair of specially bright eyes.  \"Ha!\" Nimble's mother exclaimed. \"Is that Cuffy Bear speaking?\"  \"Yessum!\" said the same voice.  \"I fear,\" she told him, \"I may not be able to go for a long time.\"  \"Never mind!\" Cuffy cried. \"I can go any night--that is, until I den up for the winter.\"  And every one in the company declared that he hadn't a single engagement that would prevent him from visiting the garden whenever Nimble's mother should say the word.  \"Well,\" said she, \"it won't be to-night, anyhow.\" And with that she turned around and began to walk along the runway again, away from the pasture fence.  As Nimble followed her Jimmy Rabbit skipped alongside him and whispered in his ear.  \"Don't fail to let me know when the time comes!\"  But Nimble said never a word. Somehow he suspected that he had made a great mistake.  He _knew_ he had, a little later.     VII  THE STRANGE LIGHT   Weeks went by; and still Nimble's mother said no more about visiting Farmer Green's carrot patch. Nimble himself did not dare to mention carrots now. It was his own fault that the excursion had been postponed. And much as he still wanted a taste of carrots the whole affair was something he didn't care to talk about.  Anyhow, it was lucky that he liked water lilies. For his mother took him to the lake behind Blue Mountain every night, almost. And there they splashed in the shallows and ate all they wanted.  Most of those nights were much alike. But there was one that Nimble remembered for many a day afterward.  It was not a dark night; neither was it a light one. It was a half-and-half sort of night. There was a moon. But it was far from full. And it was not high in the sky. The light from it came slanting down upon the lake, throwing the shadows of the trees far out upon the water.  Where those shadows reached out darkly Nimble and his mother stood with the water lapping their sleek bodies. And they were eating so busily that neither of them noticed a blurred shape that glided slowly nearer and nearer to them, without making the slightest sound.  All at once a shaft of dazzling light swept along the shore. Nimble was so surprised and puzzled that he stopped eating to stand still and gaze at it.  [Illustration: Never Had Nimble Run So Fast Before.                                           _Page_ 42]  But only for a moment! Instantly his mother flung her tail upward, so that the under side of it gleamed white even in the half light. And that--as Nimble knew right well--that was the danger signal.  Almost before Nimble knew what was happening his mother made for the shore. As she plunged through the water her tail, still aloft like a flag, twitched from side to side.  Nimble needed no urging to follow it. Soon they scrambled, dripping, out of the lake to dive headlong into the cover of the overhanging willows.  In those few seconds the light darted swiftly towards them. But it was not quite quick enough. Only the ripples told where they had been standing. Only the gently waving branches of the willows showed where Nimble and his mother had vanished.  A noise like a thunder-clap crashed upon Nimble's ears and rolled and tumbled in the distance, tossed from the mountain to the hills across the lake, and back again. It frightened Nimble much more than did the odd whistle that whined just above his head a moment before the thunder peal.  Never had he run so fast before. Never had his mother set such a pace for him. Usually, when startled, she stopped after going a short distance and looked back to try to get a glimpse of whoever or whatever had alarmed her. To be sure, she always stopped in a good place, like the edge of Cedar Swamp, where she could duck out of sight if need be.  But this time Nimble's mother ran on and on without pausing.  \"Haven't you forgotten something?\" her son gasped after a while.  \"Forgotten something? What do you mean?\" she asked.  \"Haven't you forgotten to stop?\" Nimble inquired.  A queer look came over her face.  \"I declare,\" she said, \"I do believe I'd Have run all night if you hadn't reminded me.\" She fell into a walk. And neither of them said another word until they reached the swamp, which was one of his mother's favorite hiding places. Then Nimble spoke again.  \"I waved my flag too,\" he said proudly.     VIII  MRS. DEER EXPLAINS   For the first time in his life Nimble felt quite grown up. He forgot that he had not yet lived a whole summer. He had made a suggestion to his mother which she had promptly acted upon. It had never happened before. And that was enough to cause him great pleasure.  Then there was something else that made Nimble believe himself to be a person of some account: A strange affair had happened at the lake. He had seen it all. He had taken part in it himself. Really it was no wonder that he began to talk quite importantly.  \"It was lucky I was with you,\" he remarked to his mother as they rested amid the tangle of Cedar Swamp.  \"It was lucky we weren't any further out in the lake,\" she exclaimed. \"If you hadn't been with me no doubt I'd have gone where the water was much deeper. And that light would have caught me before I could have reached the shore.\"  What his mother said made Nimble feel bigger than ever. He wasn't quite sure what had happened back there, where they had been surprised while eating water lilies. But he meant to find out, for he thought it would make a good story to tell his friends.  \"Would the moon have burnt us if it had hit us?\" he inquired.  \"What in the world are you talking about?\" his mother asked him.  He looked puzzled at her question.  \"Wasn't that the moon that lit up the lake along the shore?\" he demanded.  \"Certainly not!\" she replied.  \"Didn't the moon fall into the water?\" he asked.  \"No, indeed!\" his mother cried. She was astonished at his question.  Nimble was disappointed. He had thought he had a wonderful tale to tell. And he couldn't understand yet why everything wasn't as he had supposed.  \"I was sure the moon fell into the lake and blew up,\" he explained. \"What was that terrible noise we heard if it wasn't the moon bursting into pieces?\"  His mother didn't laugh. Instead she was quite solemn as she answered Nimble's last question.  \"That--\" she said--\"that was a gun that you heard. And the light that you saw came from a lantern in a boat.\"  It was very hard for Nimble to believe what she told him.  \"I thought I heard a piece of the moon whistle past my head,\" he went on.  \"A bullet!\" his mother declared. As she spoke she moved a little distance, to a spot where the trees were not so thick. And she raised her nose towards the sky. \"There!\" she said. \"There's the moon! It's still up there where you've always seen it.\"  Nimble looked; and at last he knew that his mother had made no mistake. But somehow he was more frightened than ever.  \"Then--\" he faltered--\"then there must have been men in the boat--men that turned the light upon the shore--and fired the gun!\"  \"They were men--yes!\" said his mother. \"And they were lawbreakers, too. I hope the game warden will catch them at their tricks.\"  \"What is a game warden?\" Nimble asked her.  \"He's a man,\" she answered. \"He's a man that looks after all of us forest folk and he's the best friend we've got.... Goodness, child! Are you never going to stop asking questions?\"     IX  A SPIKE HORN   Nimble didn't mind losing his spots, when he grew older. He had something else that gave him much more pleasure than they ever had. He had a new toy. Or to be exact, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21619"],["title","The Tale of Nimble Deer (#3)"],["body","had two new toys. And everywhere he went he carried them with him.  He carried them on his head. And he couldn't have left them behind in the woods even if he had wanted to--at least not until he had enjoyed them for a whole season.  Of course you have already guessed that he had a pair of horns. They were not very big. But neither was Nimble, for that matter. So they suited him well. A little deer like him would have looked queer wearing great branching horns such as his father owned.  Nimble's horns were merely two spikes which stuck up out of the top of his head in a pert fashion.  It was a proud day for him when an old deer spoke to him and called him \"young Spike Horn.\" About that time the forest folk had begun to speak of him as a \"yearling.\" But there was something about \"Spike Horn\" that sounded much more important.  Somehow there was a new crop of Spike Horns that summer--Nimble's second summer. And every one of them had been--like him--a little spotted fawn the year before.  At first Nimble had thought it fun to use his new horns to jab anybody that happened to be with him. One day he even stole up behind his own mother and gave her a sharp prod with them.  He never did that again. His mother quickly taught him better. She wheeled and struck him smartly with her fore feet.  \"There!\" she cried. \"That's the first time a child of mine has played that trick on me.... Let it be the last!\"  And it was. Nimble was very careful, after that, to prod only those that didn't mind such pranks.  Luckily he soon found that the other Spike Horns liked the same sort of fun that he did. They were just as proud of their new horns as he was of his. And (sad to say!) there was a good deal of boasting among them. Each one declared that his own horns were the longest and strongest.  All the Spike Horns, including Nimble, were forever butting one another in play. And they had just discovered a new sport when Nimble met with what he feared, for a time, was a terrible accident.  Late in the fall, before the deep snows came, both his horns loosened and dropped off his head.  \"Oh! oh!\" he cried when he saw what had happened. \"I'll never be able to take part in another mock battle again!\" For the Spike Horns had had gay times pretending to fight one another in a most savage fashion.  After Nimble lost his horns he carefully avoided all his playmates. He didn't want the other Spike Horns to see him. At last, to his great dismay, one day he came face to face with one of them. They both tried to dodge out of sight. But the other, whose name was Dodger, was not quite quick enough. Before he hid behind a thicket Nimble saw that he had lost his horns too!  Then Nimble guessed the truth. He knew why it was that he had managed to keep out of sight of his friends. Every Spike Horn in the neighborhood had lost his horns! And every one of them had been trying to keep out of sight.     X  AT THE CARROT PATCH   During his first summer Nimble never reached Farmer Green's carrot patch once. His mother had planned to take him there. But on account of an unexpected party she had postponed their visit. And somehow the right night for a trip after carrots never seemed to come again.  Now, Nimble had never forgotten what his mother had told him about carrots. And he was going after some--so he promised himself--just as soon as he was big enough.  When Nimble's second summer rolled around he was big enough and old enough to prowl through the woods and fields much as he pleased. He was a Spike Horn. And he felt fit to go to the carrot patch without waiting for anybody to show him the way.  So one night he stole down the hillside pasture, across the meadow, and jumped the fence into Farmer Green's garden.  He saw at once that somebody was there ahead of him. It was Jimmy Rabbit. He was very busy with one of Farmer Green's cabbages.  \"I've come down to try the carrots,\" said Nimble.  Jimmy Rabbit made no reply, except to nod his head slightly. He was eating so fast that he really couldn't speak just then.  \"Are these carrots?\" Nimble inquired, as he looked about at the big cabbages, which crossed the garden in long rows.  Jimmy Rabbit shook his head.  \"They seem to be good,\" said Nimble, \"whatever they are. I'll taste of one.\"  And he did. In fact he tasted of three or four of them, eating their centers out neatly.  Meanwhile Jimmy Rabbit was becoming uneasy. And at last he spoke.  \"I thought,\" he said, \"you told me you had come down here to try the carrots.\"  \"So I did,\" Nimble answered. \"But I don't know where the carrots are.\"  \"Why didn't you say so before?\" Jimmy Rabbit asked him. And without waiting for a reply he cried, \"Follow me! I'll show you.\" And he hopped off briskly, with Nimble after him.  Soon Jimmy Rabbit came to a halt.  \"Here it is!\" he said. \"Here's the carrot patch. Help yourself!\" And then he hopped away again, back to his supper of cabbages.  [Illustration: Nimble Deer Followed Jimmy Rabbit.                                         _Page 57_]  Nimble Deer began to eat the carrot tops. And he was greatly disappointed.  \"They're not half as good as those great round balls,\" he muttered. And he turned away from the carrots, to go back and join Jimmy Rabbit. But he hadn't gone far when he met Jimmy bounding along in a great hurry.  \"Old dog Spot!\" Jimmy Rabbit gasped as he whisked past Nimble. \"He's out to-night and he's coming this way.\"  In one leap Nimble sprang completely around and followed Jimmy Rabbit across the meadow, up through the pasture and over the stone wall into the woods. There they lost each other.  The next morning Nimble met his mother along the ridge that ran down toward Cedar Swamp.  \"I went down to the carrot patch last night,\" he told her. \"And I must say I don't see why you're so fond of carrots. They're not half as good as some big green balls that I found in the garden. I call the carrot leaves tough. But the big green balls have very tender leaves.\"  His mother gave him a queer look.  \"Do you mean to tell me,\" she asked him, \"that you ate only the _leaves_ of the carrots?\"  \"Why, yes!\" said Nimble. \"I saw nothing else to eat. There was no fruit on them.\"  \"Ho!\" cried his mother. \"You have to dig with your toes to reach the carrots themselves. They're down in the ground. And to my mind there's nothing any juicier and sweeter and tenderer than nice young carrots, eaten by the light of the moon.\"  Nimble felt very foolish. And then he tossed his head and said lightly, \"Oh, well! It wouldn't have made any difference if I _had_ dug the carrots out of the dirt. They wouldn't have tasted right anyhow. For there was no moon last night!\"     XI  CUFFY AND THE CAVE   Nimble did not spend all his spare moments with the other Spike Horns. Once in a while he met Cuffy Bear prowling about near the foot of Blue Mountain. But Nimble never had a mock battle with Cuffy. Cuffy Bear was a famous boxer. And in each of his paws he carried long sharp claws. What if Cuffy should forget to pull in those claws sometime, when he struck you a playful tap? Ah! That wouldn't be very pleasant! This was what Nimble thought about the matter. So he never butted Cuffy Bear nor pricked him with his spikes.  On the whole they found each other good company. Cuffy liked to see Nimble jump. And Nimble liked to see Cuffy climb trees.  One day, late in the fall, that year when Nimble was a Spike Horn, he strayed half way up the side of Blue Mountain. It was seldom that Nimble wandered so far up the steep and thickly wooded slopes. But old dog Spot was ranging about the lower woods. And for once Nimble did not run for Cedar Swamp when he heard the old dog bay. Instead he climbed steadily until he was sure that he had shaken Spot off his trail.  Nimble had stopped for a drink at the spring which marked the beginning of Broad Brook and there he met Cuffy Bear, who was just turning away from the ice-framed pool. \"Aren't you a long way from home?\" Cuffy asked him.  \"Yes! But I can get down to my favorite ridge quickly enough, when I want to,\" said Nimble. \"Do you live in this neighborhood?\"  \"I'm not quite sure,\" Cuffy Bear replied. \"I've had my eye on a snug den a little further up the mountain. I'm thinking of living there, if it suits me.... Wouldn't you like to see it?\"  Nimble told Cuffy that he would be delighted. So they started up the mountain, after Nimble had had his drink.  Cuffy Bear led the way. And in a short time he stopped in front of a cave. A tangle of bushes hid the mouth of it. You'd have passed right by it without ever guessing that there was any cave there.  \"This is it,\" Cuffy Bear told Nimble. \"Come right in!\"  \"No, thank you. I'd rather not,\" said Nimble. \"I don't care for caves, myself, though this seems to be a good one.\"  \"It's worth seeing,\" Cuffy Bear urged.  \"No, thank you!\" Nimble repeated.  \"You don't mind if I take a look at it?\" Cuffy Bear inquired. \"Maybe I can make up my mind--about living here--if I look at the cave once more.\"  \"Go inside, by all means!\" Nimble cried.  \"Will you wait here till I come out?\" Cuffy asked him.  And Nimble promised that he would wait.  Cuffy Bear yawned as he turned away. And Nimble thought it strange that he didn't take the trouble to beg pardon, nor to cover the yawn with a paw. Only a very careless--or a very sleepy--person would forget those things, Nimble knew.  Well, Cuffy crept inside the cave. And outside Nimble waited. He waited and waited, until at last the afternoon light began to fade.  \"I wish he'd hurry,\" Nimble muttered. \"We're going to have a storm and I don't want to stay up here in it, all night.\"  Snowflakes were already falling. And Nimble wished he hadn't promised that he would wait till Cuffy Bear came out of the cave.  He went to the entrance and called. But he got no answer.  \"I hope nothing has happened to him,\" Nimble said.  But something had.     XII  CUFFY IS MISSING   Far up on the dark mountainside, in the driving snow, Nimble waited in front of the"]]]
