The other two, Bell and Blackburn, were buoyed up by their cork lifebelts, washed ashore, and saved.  The schooner itself was afterwards destroyed, and her crew of four men and a boy were lost.  Meanwhile the screams of those on board of her and the Stanley were borne on the gale to the vast crowds who, despite darkness and tempest, lined the neighbouring cliffs, and the Shields lifeboats just referred to made gallant attempts to approach the wrecks, but failed.  Indeed, it seemed to have been a rash attempt on the part of the noble fellows of the Constance to have made the venture at all.  The second cabin of the Stanley was on deck, and formed the bridge, or outlook.  On this a number of the passengers and crew had taken refuge, but a tremendous sea carried it, and all its occupants, bodily away. After this the fury of the sea increased, and about an hour before midnight the steamer, with a hideous crash, broke in two amidships.  The after part remained fast; the fore part swung round.  All the people who remained on the after part were swept away and drowned.  The new position into which the fore part of the wreck had been forced was so far an advantage to those who still clung to it, that the bows broke the first violence of the waves, and thus partially protected the exhausted people, thirty-five of whom still remained alive out of the sixty souls originally on board.  Ten of these were passengers--two being ladies.  Meanwhile fresh preparations were being made by the rocket-men. Messengers had been sent in hot haste to Cullercoats for more rockets, those at Tynemouth having been exhausted.  They arrived at five o'clock in the morning.  By that time the tide had fallen considerably, admitting of a nearer approach to the wreck, and once more a gleam of hope cheered the hearts of the perishing as they beheld the fiery messenger of mercy rush fiercely towards them from the shore.  But hope was still delayed.  Four of the rockets missed.  The fifth passed right over them, dropping the lifeline on the wreck, and drawing from the poor sufferers a feeble cheer, which was replied to lustily from the shore. This time, fortunately, no mistakes were made by those on board.  The blocks and tackle were drawn out, the hawser on which the sling-lifebuoy traversed was fastened high up on the foremast to prevent the ropes fouling the rocks, as they had done on the first attempt; then the lifebuoy was run out, and, eventually, every soul was drawn in safety to the shore.  Thus did that battle end, with much of disaster and death to regret, indeed, but with upwards of thirty-five rescued lives to rejoice over.  I have now shown the action and bearing of our coast heroes, both in circumstances of triumphant victory and of partial success.  Before proceeding to other matters it is well to add that, when intelligence of this disaster was telegraphed to the Lifeboat Institution, a new lifeboat was immediately forwarded to Tynemouth, temporarily to replace the damaged Constance.  Instructions were given for the relief of the widows and children of the two lifeboat-men who had perished, and 26 pounds was sent to the crew of the boat.  At their next meeting the committee of the Institution, besides recording their deep regret for the melancholy loss of life, voted 100 pounds in aid of a fund raised locally for the widows and seven children of the two men.  They likewise bestowed their silver medal and a vote of thanks, inscribed on vellum, to Mr Lawrence Byrne, of the coastguard, in testimony of his gallant services on the occasion.  Contributions were also raised by a local committee for the relief of the sufferers by these disasters, and a Volunteer Corps was formed to assist in working the rocket apparatus on future occasions of shipwreck.  Let me at this point earnestly request the reader who dwells in an _inland_ home, and who never hears the roaring of the terrible sea, carefully to note that in this case it was _men of the coast_ who did the work, and _people of the coast town_ who gave subscriptions, who sympathised with sufferers, and raised a Volunteer Corps.  Ponder this well, good reader, and ask yourself the question, \"Is all as it should be here?  Have I and my fellow-inlanders nothing to do but read, admire, and say, Well done?\"  A hint is sufficient at this point.  I will return to the subject hereafter.  Sometimes our gallant lifeboat-men when called into action go through a very different and not very comfortable experience.  They neither gain a glorious victory nor achieve a partial success, but, after all their efforts, risks, and exposure, find that their services are not required, and that they must return meekly home with nothing to reward them but an approving conscience!  One such incident I once had the opportunity of observing.  I was living at the time--for purposes of investigation, and by special permission-- on board of the Gull Lightship, which lies directly off Ramsgate Harbour, close to the Goodwin Sands.  It was in the month of March. During the greater part of my two weeks' sojourn in that lightship the weather was reasonably fine, but one evening it came on to blow hard, and became what Jack styles \"dirty.\"  I went to rest that night in a condition which may be described as semi-sea-sick.  For some time I lay in my bunk moralising on the madness of those who choose the sea for a profession.  Suddenly I was roused--and the seasickness instantly cured--by the watch on deck shouting down the hatchway to the mate, \"South Sand Head Light is firing, sir, and sending up rockets!\"  The mate sprang from his bunk--just opposite to mine--and was on the cabin floor before the sentence was well finished.  Thrusting the poker with violence into the cabin fire, he rushed on deck.  I jumped up and pulled on coat, nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my speed, wondering the while at the poker incident.  There was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold.  On gaining the deck I found the two men on duty actively at work, one loading the lee gun, the other fitting a rocket to its stick.  A few hurried questions by the mate elicited all that it was needful to know. The flash of a gun from the South Sand Head Lightship, about six miles distant, had been seen, followed by a rocket, indicating that a vessel had got upon the fatal sands in her vicinity.  While the men were speaking I saw the flash of another gun, but heard no report, owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward.  A rocket followed, and at the same moment we observed the distress signal of the vessel in danger flaring on the southern tail of the sands, but very faintly; it was so far away, and the night so thick.  By this time our gun was charged and the rocket in position.  \"Look alive, Jack; fetch the poker!\" cried the mate, as he primed the gun.  I was enlightened as to the poker!  Jack dived down the hatchway and next moment returned with that instrument red-hot.  He applied it in quick succession to gun and rocket.  A grand flash and crash from the first was followed by a blinding blaze and a whiz as the second sprang with a magnificent curve far away into surrounding darkness.  This was our answer to the South Sand Head Lightship.  It was, at the same time, our signal-call to the lookout on the pier of Ramsgate Harbour.  \"That's a beauty!\" said our mate, referring to the rocket.  \"Get up another, Jack.  Sponge her well out, Jacobs; we'll give 'em another shot in a few minutes.\"  Loud and clear were both our signals, but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence on that dark and dismal night.  The lookout did not see them.  In a few minutes the gun and rocket were fired again.  Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate.  \"Load the weather gun!\" said the mate.  Jacobs obeyed, and I sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks, for the wind seemed to be made of pen-knives and needles!  The sturdy Gull straining and plunging wildly at her huge cables, trembled as our third gun thundered forth its summons, but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low, wavering flight.  Another was therefore sent up, but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when we observed the answering signal--a rocket from Ramsgate pier.  \"That's all right now, sir; _our_ work is done,\" said the mate to me, as he went below and quietly turned in, while the watch, having sponged out and re-covered the gun, resumed their active perambulations of the deck.  I confess that I felt somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of the noise and excitement.  I was told that the Ramsgate lifeboat could not well be out in less than an hour.  There was nothing for it, therefore, but patience, so I turned in, \"all standing,\" as sailors have it, with a request that I should be called when the lights of the tug should come in sight.  Scarcely had I lain down, however, when the voice of the watch was heard shouting hastily, \"Lifeboat close alongside, sir! Didn't see it till this moment.  She carries no lights.\"  Out I bounced, minus hat, coat, and shoes, and scrambled on deck just in time to see a boat close under our stern, rendered spectrally visible by the light of our lantern.  It was not the Ramsgate but the Broadstairs lifeboat, the men of which had observed our first rocket, had launched their boat at once, and had run down with the favouring gale.  \"What are you firing for?\" shouted the coxswain of the boat.  \"Ship on the sands bearing south,\" replied Jack, at the full pitch of his stentorian voice.  The boat which was under sail, did not pause, and nothing more was said. With a magnificent rush it passed us, and shot away into the darkness. Our reply had been heard, and the lifeboat, steering by compass, went straight as an arrow to the rescue.  It was a thrilling experience to me!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],["title","Battles with the Sea (#6)"],["body","as a vision though it seemed, and brief almost as the lightning flash, its visit was the _real_ thing at last.  Many a time had I heard and read of our lifeboats, and had seen them reposing in their boat-houses, as well as out \"for exercise,\" but now I had _seen_ a lifeboat tearing before the gale through the tormented sea, sternly bent on the real work of saving human life.  Once again all became silent and unexciting on board the Gull, and I went shivering below with exalted notions of the courage, endurance, and businesslike vigour of our coast heroes.  I now lay wakeful and expectant.  Presently the shout came again.  \"Tug's in sight, sir!\"  And once more I went on deck with the mate.  The steamer was quickly alongside, heaving wildly in the sea, with the Ramsgate lifeboat \"Bradford\" in tow far astern.  She merely slowed a little to admit of the same brief question and reply, the latter being repeated, as the boat passed, for the benefit of the coxswain.  As she swept by us I looked down and observed that the ten men who formed her crew crouched flat on the thwarts.  Only the steersman sat up.  No wonder.  It must be hard to sit up in a stiff gale with freezing spray, and sometimes heavy seas sweeping over one.  I knew that the men were wide awake and listening, but, as far as vision went that boat was manned only by ten oilskin coats and sou'-westers!  A few seconds carried them out of sight, and thus, as regards the Gull Lightship, the drama ended.  There was no possibility of the dwellers in the floating lights hearing anything of the details of that night's work until the fortnightly visit of their \"tender\" should fall due, but next morning at low tide, far away in the distance, we could see the wreck, bottom up, high on the Goodwin Sands.  Afterwards I learned that the ship's crew had escaped in one of their own boats, and taken refuge in the South Sand Head Lightship, whence they were conveyed next day to land, so that the gallant men of Ramsgate and Broadstairs had all their toil and trouble for nothing!  Thus, you see, there are not only high lights and deep shadows, but also neutral tints in the various incidents which go to make up the grand picture of lifeboat work.  There is a Fund connected with the Broadstairs Lifeboat which deserves passing notice here.  It was raised by the late Sir Charles Reed, in 1867, the proceeds to be distributed annually among the seamen who save life on that coast.  The following particulars of this fund were supplied by Sir Charles Reed himself:--  \"Eight boatmen of Broadstairs were interested in a lugger--the Dreadnought--which had for years done good service on the Goodwins.  One night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a French barque; but though they secured the crew, a steam-tug claimed the prize and towed her into Ramsgate Harbour.  The Broadstairs men instituted proceedings to secure the salvage, but they were beaten in a London law court, where they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company.  In the meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of Normandy, and in this emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs.  The poor men had no means, and not being able to pay they were taken from their homes and lodged in Maidstone Gaol.  He (Sir Charles) was then staying in Broadstairs, and an appeal being made to him, he wrote to the `Times', and in one week received nearly twice the amount required.  The bill was paid, the men were liberated and brought home to their families, and the balance of the amount, a considerable sum, was invested, the interest to be applied to the rewarding of boatmen who, by personal bravery, had distinguished themselves by saving life on the coast.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITIES OF THE LIFEBOAT.  In previous chapters enough has been told, I think, to prove that our lifeboats deserve earnest and thoughtful attention, not only as regards their work, but in reference to their details of construction.  It has been said that the lifeboat possesses special qualities which distinguish it from all other boats.  Chief among these are the self-righting and self-emptying principles.  Stability, resulting from breadth of beam, etcetera, will do much to render a boat safe in rough seas and tempestuous weather, but when a boat has to face mighty rollers which turn it up until it stands straight on end, like a rearing horse, and even tumble it right over, or when it has to plunge into horrible maelstroms which seethe, leap, and fume in the mad contention of cross seas, no device that man has yet fallen upon will save it from turning keel up and throwing its contents into the water.  Instead therefore, of attempting to build a boat which cannot upset, men have deemed it wiser to attempt the construction of one which will not remain in that position, but which will, of necessity, right itself. The end aimed at has been achieved, and the boat now in use by the Lifeboat Institution is absolutely perfect in this respect.  What more could be desired in any boat than that, after being upset, it should right itself in a _few seconds_, and empty itself of water in less than one minute?  A boat which does not right itself when overturned is only a lifeboat so long as it maintains its proper position on the water.  Let its self-emptying and buoyant qualities be ever so good, you have only to upset it to render it no better than any other boat;--indeed, in a sense, it is worse than other boats, because it leads men to face danger which they would not dare to encounter in an ordinary boat.  Doubtless, lifeboats on the non-self-righting principle possess great stability, and are seldom overturned; nevertheless they occasionally are, and with fatal results.  Here is one example.  In the month of January, 1865, the Liverpool lifeboat, when out on service, was upset, and seven men of her crew were drowned.  This was not a self-righting boat, and it did not belong to the Lifeboat Institution, most of whose boats are now built on the self-righting principle.  Moreover, the unfortunate men had not put on lifebelts.  It may be added that the men who work the boats of the Institution are not allowed to go off without their cork lifebelts on.  Take another case.  On the 4th January, 1857, the Point of Ayr lifeboat, when under sail in a gale, upset at a distance from the land.  The accident was seen from the shore, but no aid could be rendered, and the whole boat's crew--thirteen in number--were drowned.  This boat was considered a good lifeboat, and doubtless it was so in many respects, but it was not a self-righting one.  Two or three of the poor fellows were seen clinging to the keel for twenty minutes, by which time they became exhausted, were washed off, and, having no lifebelts on, perished.  Again in February, 1858, the Southwold lifeboat--a large sailing boat, esteemed one of the finest in the kingdom, but not on the self-righting principle--went out for exercise, and was running before a heavy surf with all sail set, when she suddenly ran on the top of a sea, turned broadside to the waves, and was upset.  The crew in this case were fortunately near the shore, had on their lifebelts, and, although some of them could not swim, were all saved--no thanks, however, to their boat, which remained keel up--but three unfortunate gentlemen who had been permitted to go off in the boat without lifebelts, and one of whom was a good swimmer, lost their lives.  Let it be noted here that the above three instances of disaster occurred in the day time, and the contrast of the following case will appear all the stronger.  One very dark and stormy night in October, 1858, the small lifeboat of Dungeness put off through a heavy sea to a wreck three-quarters of a mile from the shore.  Eight stout men of the coastguard composed her crew.  She was a self-righting, self-emptying boat, belonging to the Lifeboat Institution.  The wreck was reached soon after midnight, and found to have been abandoned.  The boat, therefore, returned towards the shore.  Now, there is a greater danger in rowing before a gale than in rowing against it.  For the first half mile all went well, though the sea was heavy and broken, but, on crossing a deep channel between two shoals, the little lifeboat was caught up and struck by three heavy seas in succession.  The coxswain lost command of the rudder, and she was carried away before a sea, broached to, and upset, throwing her crew out of her.  _Immediately_ she righted herself, cleared herself of water, and was brought up by her anchor which had fallen out when she was overturned.  The crew meanwhile having on lifebelts, floated and swam to the boat, caught hold of the life-lines festooned round her sides, clambered into her, cut the cable, and returned to the shore in safety! What more need be said in favour of the self-righting boats?  The self-emptying principle is quite equal to the self-righting in importance.  In _every_ case of putting off to a wreck in a gale, a lifeboat ships a great deal of water.  In most cases she fills more than once. Frequently she is overwhelmed by tons of water by every sea.  A boat full of water cannot advance, therefore baling becomes necessary; but baling, besides being very exhausting work, is so slow that it would be useless labour in most cases.  Besides, when men have to bale they cannot give that undivided attention to the oars which is needful.  To overcome this difficulty the self-emptying plan was devised.  As, I doubt not, the reader is now sufficiently interested to ask the questions, How are self-righting and self-emptying accomplished?  I will try to throw some light on these subjects.  First, as to self-righting.  You are aware, no doubt, that the buoyancy of our lifeboat is due chiefly to large air-cases at the ends, and all round the sides from stem to stern.  The accompanying drawing and diagrams will aid us in the description.  On the opposite page you have a "]]]
