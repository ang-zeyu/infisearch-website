The fact was that English Chief was fond of a little fun, and despite the dignified position which he held, and the maturity of his years, he could not resist availing himself of any little chance that came in his way of having what is more pithily than elegantly styled \"a spree.\"  It happened to be the particular period at which the wild-fowl of those regions begin to cast their feathers.  Knowing this, English Chief quietly slipped off with his canoe when Mackenzie landed, and soon found a colony of swans afflicted with that humiliating lack of natural clothing, which is the cause, doubtless, of their periodically betaking themselves to the uttermost ends of the earth in order to hide in deep solitude their poverty, and there renew their garments.  Judge then, reader, if you can, the consternation with which these once graceful creatures discovered that their retreat had been found out by that inquisitive biped, man--that they were actually caught in the act of moulting!  Uttering a terrific \"hoozoo!\" or some such equally wild Red-Indian hunting cry, English Chief dashed his paddle into the water; squaws and comrade followed suit; the canoe shot in among the rushes, and the whole party leaped on shore.  Thus taken by surprise the swans bounced up, extended their miserable wings, uttered a trumpet-blast of alarm, and sought to fly.  Of course they failed, but although they could not fly, they fled on the wings of terror, and with straight necks, heads low, legs doing double duty, and remnants of wings doing what they could, they made for the interior of the island at a pace which at first defied pursuit.  The higher part of the island was level and open, with here and there a few stunted bushes.  Arrived here the trumpeting crew scattered, like wise troops when pursued.  English Chief set his heart and eyes on a particularly large bird, and dashed after it with upraised paddle.  The swan made a desperate _detour_, apparently bent on gaining the water; it ran round a bush, and was almost caught in the arms of the younger squaw, who, leaving her senior in the canoe, had joined in the pursuit.  A shriek from the squaw sent it off at a tangent to the left, pinions aloft, and terror depicted on its visage.  English Chief also doubled, but a crooked stump caught his foot and sent him headlong into the bush.  At that instant, Coppernose, having foiled a swan with a well-directed sweep of his paddle, came up and gave chase.  English Chief, nettled at the interference, sprung up, followed and overtook him just as the hard-pushed swan turned at bay.  Both men came upon it at the same moment, stumbled over it, and turned their wrath upon each other.  The swan, recovering, ran wildly and blindly back towards the young squaw, who was so much alarmed by its look that she fairly turned and fled; but hearing the shouts of the Indians as they struggled, she turned towards them.  Meanwhile, the elder squaw having landed, met the retreating swan just as it gained the rushes.  Stooping down she allowed it to approach to within a yard of her--like a true heroine--and then, rising, hit it a neat blow on the back of the head and laid it low for ever.  After this she joined her sister-wife (if we may be allowed the expression) in trying to tear the Indians asunder.  This was accomplished after a few seconds, but the two men still glared at each other.  Fortunately they could do little more, having left their knives in the canoe.  While they were still in a state of indecision, an unfortunate swan, which had taken refuge behind a bush, so far recovered its breath as to think it advisable to get still further away from such company.  It was observed and followed as wildly as before by English Chief.  This time Coppernose had the sense to confine his attentions to another part of the field, where, while prosecuting the chase, he suddenly came upon a flock of geese in the same helpless circumstances as the swans.  Soon the swans were routed out of their places of concealment, and the cries of men, women, and birds again resounded in the air.  The way in which those swans behaved was quite marvellous. They dodged the blows aimed at them, and \"jinked\" round the bushes as if they had been trained to such work in a regular public school for human bipeds, and they struck out with their pinions, too, so deftly and with such force that the pursuers had to become extremely cautious as well as bold in their approaches.  At last, when the Indians were thoroughly exhausted, they gave up the chase.  On conveying the fruits of their exertions to the canoe, they found that they had killed five swans and a like number of geese.  With these they returned in triumph to camp, to the great relief of Mackenzie, who had began to fear either that an accident had befallen them, or that they had deserted him.  At this place two bags of pemmican were concealed on an island, and here one of their leads was lost in taking soundings.  The current of the river also was so violent that Mackenzie concluded they must be approaching the rapids, of which some of the natives had made mention. The strength of the current may be estimated from the fact that, when the lead just referred to caught on the bottom and held on, they attempted to clear it by paddling up stream; yet although they had eight paddles, and were held by the line, the strength of which was equal to four paddles, they were borne down with such force that the line snapped asunder.  Here the weather became very bad.  They had frequent thunderstorms accompanied with violent rain, and, although it was at that time the beginning of July, ice lay in great quantities all along the banks of the river.  On shore, the earth was thawed only to a depth of about fourteen inches.  Indeed, the soil of those regions _never_ thaws completely.  At the hottest season of the year, if you were to dig down a few feet, you would come to a subsoil which is locked in the embrace of _perpetual_ frost.  Some signs of natives were discovered here, and, from the appearance of the cut trees, it was evident that they possessed no iron tools.  \"Push forward,\" was Mackenzie's watchword more perhaps than it had been of any previous discoverer in Rupert's Land.  The Indians began ere long to complain bitterly of his perseverance.  They were not accustomed to such constant and severe exertion, and it was with great difficulty that he prevailed on them to continue the voyage.  As they advanced, fresh signs of natives were observed, and at last, one evening, they came in sight of an encampment of them.  It was at a place where the current of the great river was so strong that it was in actual ebullition, and produced a hissing noise like a kettle of water in a moderate boiling state.  The region was mountainous, and just before them they perceived a high ridge covered with snow.  \"They're evidently not much used to visitors,\" said Mackenzie, on observing that the natives were running about in great confusion, some making for the woods, and others hurrying to the canoes.  \"They is used to be 'tacked by inimis,\" said English Chief, who was rather proud of his knowledge of the English language.  \"Hail them in the Chipewyan tongue,\" said Mackenzie, as the canoes touched the beach.  English Chief and the hunters landed first, and addressed the few natives who had ventured to remain, but they were so terrified as to be unable to reply.  Seeing this, Mackenzie quietly landed, and gave orders for the pitching of the tents.  While this was being done, the natives grew calm; they found that they understood Chipewyan; a few words relieved them of their apprehensions, and soon they not only came down to the tents, but were so gratified with their reception that they sent for those members of their tribe who had fled. Thus friendly relations were established.  There were five families, consisting of about thirty persons of two different tribes--the Slave and the Dog-rib Indians.    CHAPTER SIX.  INDIANS MET WITH, AND THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT RIVER REACHED.  Heroes are not perfect.  We deem it necessary to make this observation, because many modern biographers seem to imagine that their heroes _are_ perfect, and even attempt to prove them to be so.  We therefore feel it necessary to disclaim any such imagination or intention in regard to _our_ hero.  Alexander Mackenzie was indeed a hero, and a very fine specimen of a man--mentally as well as physically--if we are to credit the report of those who knew him best; but he was not perfect.  For instance, he evidently acted sometimes on the fallacious notion that whatever gave pleasure to himself must necessarily give pleasure to all other men.  Acting on this idea in the present instance, he sought to delight the hearts of these Slave and Dog-rib Indians by presenting them with pipes and tobacco, and inducing them to smoke.  To the credit of humanity be it recorded that they received the gift with marked dislike, although they were too polite to absolutely refuse it.  Slaves though one section of them were in name, they were not slaves to tobacco; and the other section being Dog-ribs, had, we presume, too little of Adam's rib in them to find pleasure in smoke.  Of course, they knew _something_ about smoke, but it was chiefly as a nuisance, which was very troublesome to the eyes, and which usually issued from the tops of their wigwams--not from human lips.  It must also be recorded that those estimable savages entertained a strong antipathy to grog when it was produced.  Their hearts were reached, however, and their souls gladdened, when knives, beads, awls, firesteels, flints, and hatchets were presented to them; and we can fancy how animated and earnest would be their converse over the wigwam fires, for weeks and months, if not for years, afterwards, when they brought out, for the thousandth time, and feasted their wondering eyes on, those"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21691"],["title","The Pioneers (#7)"],["body"," useful implements, which had been left by the mysterious white beings who had dropped upon them so suddenly, as if from the skies, and whom they felt half inclined at first to reverence as gods.  Having won their confidence and esteem, Mackenzie proceeded to question them as to that portion of the great river which yet lay before him. Their account was an exaggerated echo of that previously obtained from the Indians of Great Slave Lake.  Being, therefore, of little or no value, our hero was obliged to advance, and solve the question for himself.  As before, the effect of the Indian stories on the Indians of his party was very marked and discouraging.  With great difficulty Mackenzie overcame their objections to proceed, and even succeeded in persuading one of the Dog-rib Indians to accompany him by the potent influence of a small kettle, an axe, a knife, and a few other gifts. This man was a stout young fellow, in a very dirty deerskin coat and leggings, with a double blue line tattooed on his cheeks from the ears to the nose, on the bridge of which it met in a blue spot.  Hence Lawrence, following the natural bent of his mind, which he had already displayed in naming Coppernose, immediately addressed this new recruit as Bluenose.  These poor savages, although exemplary in the matters of grog and tobacco, were, we are constrained to admit, a very filthy set of creatures; very poor also, because utterly destitute of such wealth as the fur-traders had carried to many of the less remote tribes of Indians.  Nevertheless they possessed a considerable number of implements of their own manufacture, some of wood and others of bone, etcetera, which proved them to be possessed of much ingenuity and taste. The description of their weapons reminds one of those remains of prehistoric man which we find treasured in our museums, for they had arrows barbed with horn, flint, iron, and copper, spears shod with bone, daggers of horn and bone, and axes made of brown or grey stone.  The latter were from six to eight inches long and two thick, having the inside flat and the outside round, and tapering to an edge, and were fastened by the middle to wooden handles with a cord of raw skin.  They kindled fires by striking together a piece of white or yellow pyrites and a flint stone over a piece of touch-wood, and boiled water in water-tight baskets, by putting a succession of red-hot stones into them.  From these Indians the explorers learned that they had passed, on their voyage down the river, large bodies of Indians who inhabit the mountains.  \"He'll never make up his mind to go,\" observed Reuben, as, when about to set forth again, he looked at the pale countenance of the Dog-rib who had agreed to join the party.  Mackenzie had already had a severe argument with him in order to induce him to fulfil his engagement, and had left him under the impression that he had been successful; but when the poor man had said farewell to the tribe, and was on the point of entering the canoe, his courage failed, and he drew back.  Seeing this, Lawrence suddenly seized him by the nape of the neck, and exclaiming, \"Come, look sharp, Bluenose, get in with 'ee,\" gave him a lift that put the matter at rest by sending him sprawling on board.  Next moment they were off, and shooting down the rapid current of the river.  That night they encamped, amid heavy squalls of wind and rain, at the foot of a rocky hill, on the top of which their new guide said that it blew a gale every day of the year!  Here the Dog-rib became very unhappy, and pretended to be ill, but a strict watch was kept on him so that he could not escape.  The country around them was very wild and rugged, and they were informed by their guide that great numbers of bears and small white buffaloes (musk-oxen?) frequented the mountains; also some tribes of Indians.  Here some of the party attempted to ascend a steep hill, but were almost suffocated and fairly driven back by clouds of mosquitoes.  Natives were sometimes seen and spoken with, although their first impulse on beholding the voyagers was almost invariably to flee.  On one occasion a whole tribe fled save one old man, who came boldly forward and said that he was too old to run or to care much about the short time that yet remained to him of this life.  At the same time he pulled out his grey hair by handfuls, and distributed them among the party, imploring their favour for himself and his relations.  His mind was quickly relieved by Swiftarrow, who seemed to have a special desire, as well as talent, for comforting aged persons of both sexes.  Some of these tribes were named the Hare Indians--hares and fish being their principal means of support.  While spending a night with these people a storm of thunder and rain came on, in the midst of which the Dog-rib, Bluenose, managed to make his escape.  As it was important to have a guide, Mackenzie compelled a Hare Indian to fill his place; and, after carrying him off, took great pains to conciliate him--in which efforts he was happily successful.  Next day they observed natives on the east shore of the river, and directed their course towards them.  Their new guide began to call to them in an incomprehensible manner, and said that the natives did not belong to his tribe, but were a very wicked people, who would beat them cruelly, and pull out their hair, and maltreat them in various ways. Despite this warning Mackenzie advanced, and soon found them to be quite as willing to accept of gifts as other tribes.  He found that they understood their guide, and that English Chief clearly comprehended one of themselves, although he could not make himself understood.  Here the joyful information was obtained that in three days more they should meet with the Esquimaux, and in ten days at furthest reach the great salt lake--or the sea.  These natives were very superior to those whom the travellers had last met with, and one of them was engaged to take the place of Bluenose. This man, who was clad in a shirt made of the skins of the musk-rat, after which he was named, was a very lively individual.  He sang the songs not only of his own tribe, but also those of the Esquimaux, with whom his tribe had been formerly at war, but were now at peace.  He also undertook to perform an Esquimaux dance in Mackenzie's canoe, and would infallibly have upset that conveyance had he not been violently restrained.  He commented on the tribe to which Bluenose belonged with great contempt, calling them by the strong names of cowards and liars.  During these brief visits to the natives our discoverer was not only troubled by the thievish propensities of the natives, but had to guard against the same tendencies in his own men, some of whom were much confused as to the true course of rectitude in regard to \"mine and thine\"; in addition to which he had to contend with a general propensity on the part of his men to quarrel not only with each other, but with the weather, the journey, and the decrees of fate generally.  By a judicious mixture, however, of firmness and suavity, severity and kindness, he managed to keep the several parts of his discordant band together; and, in so doing, proved himself an able general for the highest generalship consists in making the most of existing circumstances and materials.  The river here ran through various channels formed by islands, some of which were without a tree, while others were covered with spruce, fir, and other trees.  The banks, which were about six feet above the surface of the river, displayed a face of solid ice intermixed with veins of black earth, and as the heat of the sun melted the ice, the trees frequently fell into the river.  The variety of channels in the river rendered it difficult to decide which should be followed.  Muskrat, the new guide, recommended that which ran to the east; but his leader, not feeling sure of his wisdom or knowledge, preferred the middle channel.  Here Mackenzie put ashore and proceeded to engage in some cabalistic pursuits which utterly confounded Muskrat.  \"What is he doing?\" asked the savage of English Chief.  \"Taking the sun,\" replied the interpreter, with immense pomposity.  \"What does that mean?\" asked the savage.  English Chief tried to explain, but failed for this good reason--that he himself was totally ignorant of the subject beyond the phrase, which he had picked up after the manner of a parrot.  It was found that the latitude was 67 degrees 47 minutes north.  This was further north than Mackenzie had expected to make it, but the difference was owing to the variation of the compass.  From this it became evident that the river emptied itself into the Polar Sea.  Not satisfied, however, with the apparent certainty of this, our pioneer resolved to have ocular demonstration--to push on to the mouth of the river, even although, by so doing, he should risk not being able to return to Fort Chipewyan for want of provisions.  But now his men became so much discouraged that they did their utmost to induce him to turn back, and he felt convinced that if they had had it in their power, some of them would have left him to his fate.  As Columbus did of old, in somewhat similar circumstances, he assured them that he would now advance only a specified number of days--seven, adding that if he did not then reach the sea he would return.  Indeed the low state of their provisions alone formed a sufficient security for the maintenance of his engagement.  That evening (the 11th July) they pitched their tents near to a spot where there had been three encampments of the Esquimaux, and here Mackenzie sat up all night to observe the sun, being now in that realm of bright unchanging day, which in winter becomes a region of continuous night.  At half-past twelve he called up Reuben Guff and his son and Swiftarrow, who were the most intelligent members of his party, to view a spectacle which they had never before seen.  They thought, on observing the sun so"]]]
