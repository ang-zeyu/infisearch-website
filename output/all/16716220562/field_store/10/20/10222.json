THE TEA-PARTY--ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS OF A MINOR KIND--GLYNN PROCTOR GETS INTO TROUBLE.  On the evening of the day in which the foregoing scenes were enacted, the Misses Dunning prepared a repast for their brother and one or two of his officers, who were to spend the last evening in port there, and discuss various important and unimportant matters in a sort of semi-convivio-business way.  An event of this kind was always of the deepest interest and productive of the most intense anxiety to the amiable though starched sisters; first, because it was of rare occurrence; and second, because they were never quite certain that it would pass without some unhappy accident, such as the upsetting of a tea-cup or a kettle, or the scalding of the cat, not to mention visitors' legs.  They seemed to regard a tea-party in the light of a firearm--a species of blunderbuss--a thing which, it was to be hoped, would \"go off well\"; and, certainly, if loading the table until it groaned had anything to do with the manner of its \"going off,\" there was every prospect of its doing so with pre-eminent success upon that occasion.  But besides the anxieties inseparable from the details of the pending festivities, the Misses Dunning were overwhelmed and weighed down with additional duties consequent upon their brother's sudden and unexpected determination.  Little Ailie had to be got ready for sea by the following morning!  It was absolute and utter insanity!  No one save a madman or a sea-captain could have conceived such a thing, much less have carried it into effect tyrannically.  The Misses Dunning could not attempt any piece of duty or work separately.  They always acted together, when possible; and might, in fact, without much inconvenience, have been born Siamese twins. Whatever Martha did, Jane attempted to do or to mend; wherever Jane went, Martha followed.  Not, by any means, that one thought she could improve upon the work of the other; their conduct was simply the result of a desire to assist each other mutually.  When Martha spoke, Jane echoed or corroborated; and when Jane spoke, Martha repeated her sentences word for word in a scarcely audible whisper--not after the other had finished, but during the course of the remarks.  With such dispositions and propensities, it is not a matter to be wondered at that the good ladies, while arranging the tea-table, should suddenly remember some forgotten article of Ailie's wardrobe, and rush simultaneously into the child's bedroom to rectify the omission; or, when thus engaged, be filled with horror at the thought of having left the buttered toast too near the fire in the parlour.  \"It is really quite perplexing,\" said Martha, sitting down with a sigh, and regarding the tea-table with a critical gaze; \"quite perplexing. I'm sure I don't know how I shall bear it.  It is too bad of George-- darling Ailie--(dear me, Jane, how crookedly you have placed the urn)-- it is really too bad.\"  \"Too bad, indeed; yes, isn't it?\" echoed Jane, in reference to the captain's conduct, while she assisted Martha, who had risen to readjust the urn.  \"Oh!\" exclaimed Martha, with a look of horror.  \"What?\" cried Jane, who looked and felt equally horrified, although she knew not yet the cause.  \"The eggs!\"  \"The eggs?\"  \"Yes, the eggs.  You know every one of the last dozen we got was bad, and we've forgot to send for more,\" said Martha.  \"For more; so we have!\" cried Jane; and both ladies rushed into the kitchen, gave simultaneous and hurried orders to the servant-girl, and sent her out of the house impressed with an undefined feeling that life or death depended on the instant procuring of two dozen fresh eggs.  It may be as well to remark here, that the Misses Dunning, although stiff, and starched, and formal, had the power of speeding nimbly from room to room, when alone and when occasion required, without in the least degree losing any of their stiffness or formality, so that we do not use the terms \"rush,\" \"rushed,\" or \"rushing\" inappropriately. Nevertheless, it may also be remarked that they never acted in a rapid or impulsive way in company, however small in numbers or unceremonious in character the company might be--always excepting the servant-girl and the cat, to whose company, from long habit, they had become used, and therefore indifferent.  The sisters were on their knees, stuffing various articles into a large trunk, and Ailie was looking on, by way of helping, with very red and swollen eyes, and the girl was still absent in quest of eggs, when a succession of sounding blows were administered to the green door, and a number of gruff voices were heard conversing without.  \"_There_!\" cried Martha and Jane, with bitter emphasis, looking in each other's faces as if to say, \"We knew it.  Before that girl was sent away for these eggs, we each separately and privately prophesied that they would arrive, and that we should have to open the door.  And you see, so it has happened, and we are not ready!\"  But there was no time for remark.  The case was desperate.  Both sisters felt it to be so, and acted accordingly, while Ailie, having been forbidden to open the door, sat down on her trunk, and looked on in surprise.  They sprang up, washed their hands simultaneously in the same basin, with the same piece of soap broken in two; dried them with the same towel, darted to the mirror, put on two identically similar clean tall caps, leaped down-stairs, opened the door with slow dignity of demeanour, and received their visitors in the hall with a calmness and urbanity of manner that contrasted rather strangely with their flushed countenances and heaving bosoms.  \"Hallo!  Ailie!\" exclaimed the captain, as his daughter pulled down his head to be kissed.  \"Why, you take a fellow all aback, like a white squall.  Are you ready, my pet?  Kit stowed and anchor tripped?  Come this way, and let us talk about it.  Dear me, Martha, you and Jane--look as if you had been running a race, eh?  Here are my messmates come to talk a bit with you.  My sisters, Martha and Jane--Dr Hopley.\"  (Dr Hopley bowed politely.) \"My first mate, Mr Millons\" (Mr Millons also bowed, somewhat loosely); \"and Rokens--Tim Rokens, my chief harpooner.\" (Mr Rokens pulled his forelock, and threw back his left leg, apparently to counterbalance the bend in his body.) \"He didn't want to come; said he warn't accustomed to ladies' society; but I told him you warn't ladies--a--I don't mean that--not ladies o' the high-flyin' fashionable sort, that give themselves airs, you know.  Come along, Ailie.\"  While the captain ran on in this strain, hung up his hat, kissed Ailie, and ran his fingers through his shaggy locks, the Misses Dunning performed a mingled bow and courtsey to each guest as his name was mentioned, and shook hands with him, after which the whole party entered the parlour, where the cat was discovered enjoying a preliminary meal of its own at one of the pats of butter.  A united shriek from Martha and Jane, a nautical howl from the guests, and a rolled-up pocket-handkerchief from Rokens sent that animal from the table as if it had received a galvanic shock.  \"I ax yer parding, ladies,\" said Mr Rokens, whose aim had been so perfect that his handkerchief not only accelerated the flight of the cat, but carried away the violated pat of butter along with it.  \"I ax yer parding, but them brutes is sich thieves--I could roast 'em alive, so I could.\"  The harpooner unrolled his handkerchief, and picking the pat of butter from its folds with his fingers, threw it into the fire.  Thereafter he smoothed down his hair, and seated himself on the extreme edge of a chair, as near the door as possible.  Not that he had any intention whatever of taking to flight, but he deemed that position to be more suited to his condition than any other.  In a few minutes the servant-girl returned with the eggs.  While she is engaged in boiling them, we shall introduce Captain Dunning's friends and messmates to the reader.  Dr Hopley was a surgeon, and a particular friend of the captain's.  He was an American by birth, but had travelled so much about the world that he had ceased to \"guess\" and \"calculate,\" and to speak through his nose. He was a man about forty, tall, big-boned, and muscular, though not fat; and besides being a gentlemanly man, was a good-natured, quiet creature, and a clever enough fellow besides, but he preferred to laugh at and enjoy the jokes and witticisms of others rather than to perpetrate any himself.  Dr Hopley was intensely fond of travelling, and being possessed of a small independence, he indulged his passion to the utmost.  He had agreed to go with Captain Dunning as the ship's doctor, simply for the sake of seeing the whale-fishery of the South Seas, having already, in a similar capacity, encountered the dangers of the North.  Dr Hopley had few weaknesses.  His chief one was an extravagant belief in phrenology.  We would not be understood to imply that phrenology is extravagant; but we assert that the doctor's belief in it was extravagant, assigning, as he did, to every real and ideal facility of the human mind \"a local habitation and a name\" in the cranium, with a corresponding depression or elevation of the surface to mark its whereabouts.  In other respects he was a commonplace sort of a man.  Mr Millons, the first mate, was a short, hale, thick-set man, without any particularly strong points of character.  He was about thirty-five, and possessed a superabundance of fair hair and whiskers, with a large, broad chin, a firm mouth, rather fierce-looking eyes, and a hasty, but by no means a bad temper.  He was a trustworthy, matter-of-fact seaman, and a good officer, but not bright intellectually.  Like most men of his class, his look implied that he did not under-estimate his own importance, and his tones were those of a man accustomed to command.  Tim Rokens was an old salt; a bluff, strong,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21714"],["title","The Red Eric (#3)"],["body"," cast-iron man, of about forty-five years of age, who had been at sea since he was a little boy, and would not have consented to live on dry land, though he had been \"offered command of a seaport town all to himself,\" as he was wont to affirm emphatically.  His visage was scarred and knotty, as if it had been long used to being pelted by storms--as indeed it had.  There was a scar over his left eye and down his cheek, which had been caused by a slash from the cutlass of a pirate in the China Seas; but although it added to the rugged effect of his countenance, it did not detract from the frank, kindly expression that invariably rested there.  Tim Rokens had never been caught out of temper in his life.  Men were wont say he had no temper to lose.  Whether this was true or no, we cannot presume to say, but certainly he never lost it.  He was the best and boldest harpooner in Captain Dunning's ship, and a sententious deliverer of his private opinion on all occasions whatsoever.  When we say that he wore a rough blue pilot-cloth suit, and had a large black beard, with a sprinkling of silver hairs in it, we have completed his portrait.  \"What's come of Glynn?\" inquired Captain Dunning, as he accepted a large cup of smoking tea with one hand, and with the other handed a plate of buttered toast to Dr Hopley, who sat next him.  \"I really cannot imagine,\" replied Miss Martha.  \"No, cannot imagine,\" whispered Miss Jane.  \"He promised to come, and to be punctual,\" continued Miss Martha (\"Punctual,\" whispered Miss J), \"but something seems to have detained him.  Perhaps--\"  Here Miss Martha was brought to an abrupt pause by observing that Mr Rokens was about to commence to eat his egg with a teaspoon.  \"Allow me, Mr Rokens,\" she said, handing that individual an ivory eggspoon.  \"Oh, cer'nly, ma'am.  By all means,\" replied Rokens, taking the spoon and handing it to Miss Jane, under the impression that it was intended for her.  \"I beg pardon, it is for yourself, Mr Rokens,\" said Martha and Jane together.  \"Thank'ee, ma'am,\" replied Rokens, growing red, as he began to perceive he was a little \"off his course\" somehow.  \"I've no occasion for _two_, an' this one suits me oncommon.\"  \"Ah! you prefer big spoons to little ones, my man, don't you?\" said Captain Dunning, coming to the rescue.  \"Let him alone, Martha, he's used to take care of himself.  Doctor, can you tell me now, which is the easiest of digestion--a hard egg or a soft one?\"  Thus appealed to, Dr Hopley paused a moment and frowned at the teapot, as though he were about to tax his brain to the utmost in the solution of an abstruse question in medical science.  \"Well now,\" he replied, stirring his tea gently, and speaking with much deliberation, \"that depends very much upon circumstances.  Some digestions can manage a hard egg best, others find a soft one more tractable.  And then the state of the stomach at the time of eating has to be taken into account.  I should say now, that my little friend Ailie, here, to judge from the rosy colour of her cheeks, could manage hard or soft eggs equally well; couldn't you, eh?\"  Ailie laughed, as she replied, \"I'm sure I don't know, Doctor Hopley; but I _like_ soft ones best.\"  To this, Captain Dunning said, \"Of course you do, my sensible little pet;\" although it would be difficult to show wherein lay the sensibility of the preference, and then added--\"There's Rokens, now; wouldn't you, doctor--judging from his rosy, not to say purple cheeks--conclude that he wasn't able to manage even two eggs of any kind?\"  \"Wot, _me_!\" exclaimed Mr Rokens, looking up in surprise, as indeed he well might, having just concluded his fourth, and being about to commence his fifth egg, to the no small anxiety of Martha and Jane, into whose limited and innocent minds the possibility of such a feat had never entered.  \"Wot, _me_!  Why, capting, if they was biled as hard as the head of a marline-spike--\"  The expanding grin on the captain's face, and a sudden laugh from the mate, apprised the bold harpooner at this point of his reply that the captain was jesting, so he felt a little confused, and sought relief by devoting himself assiduously to egg Number 5.  It fared ill with Tim Rokens that evening that he had rashly entered into ladies' society, for he was a nervous man in refined company, though cool and firm as a grounded iceberg when in the society of his messmates, or when towing with the speed of a steamboat in the wake of a sperm-whale.  Egg Number 5 proved to be a bad one.  Worse than that, egg Number 5 happened to belong to that peculiar class of bad eggs which \"go off\" with a little crack when hit with a spoon, and sputter their unsavoury contents around them.  Thus it happened, that when Mr Rokens, feeling confused, and seeking relief in attention to the business then in hand, hit egg Number 5 a smart blow on the top, a large portion of its contents spurted over the fair white tablecloth, a small portion fell on Mr Rokens' vest, and a minute yellow globule thereof alighted on the fair Martha's hand, eliciting from that lady a scream, and as a matter of course, an echo from Jane in the shape of a screamlet.  Mr Rokens flushed a deep Indian-red, and his nose assumed a warm blue colour instantly.  \"Oh! ma'am, I ax yer parding.\"  \"Pray don't mention it--a mere accident.  I'm so sorry you have got a bad--Oh!\"  The little scream with which Miss Martha interrupted her remark was caused by Mr Rokens (who had just observed the little yellow globule above referred to) seizing her hand, and wiping away the speck with the identical handkerchief that had floored the cat and swept away the pat of butter.  Immediately thereafter, feeling heated, he wiped the perspiration from his forehead, and unwittingly transferred the spot thereto in the form of a yellow streak, whereat Ailie and the first mate burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.  Even Miss Martha smiled, although she rather objected to jesting, as being a dangerous amusement, and never laughed at the weaknesses or misfortunes of others, however ludicrous they might be, when she could help it.  \"How can you, brother?\" she said, reproachfully, shaking her head at the captain, who was winking at the doctor with one eye in a most obstreperous manner.  \"Do try another egg, Mr Rokens; the others, I am sure, are fresh.  I cannot imagine how a bad one came to be amongst them.\"  \"Ah, try another, my lad,\" echoed the captain.  \"Pass 'em up this way, Mr Millons.\"  \"By no manner o' means; I'll eat this 'un!\" replied the harpooner, commencing to eat the bad egg with apparent relish.  \"I like 'em this way--better than nothin', anyhow.  Bless ye, marm, ye've no notion wot sort o' things I've lived on aboard ship--\"  Rokens came to an abrupt pause in consequence of the servant-girl, at a sign from her mistresses (for she always received duplicate orders), seizing his plate and carrying it off bodily.  It was immediately replaced by a clean one and a fresh egg.  While Rokens somewhat nervously tapped the head of Number 6, Miss Martha, in order to divert attention from him, asked Mr Millons if sea-fare was always salt junk and hard biscuit?  \"Oh, no, madam,\" answered the first mate.  \"We've sometimes salt pork, and vegetables now and agin; and pea-soup, and plum-duff--\"  \"Plum-duff, Ailie,\" interrupted the captain, in order to explain, \"is just a puddin' with few plums and fewer spices in it.  Something like a white-painted cannon-shot, with brown spots on it here and there.\"  \"Is it good?\" inquired Ailie.  \"Oh, ain't it!\" remarked Mr Rokens, who had just concluded Number 6, and felt his self-possession somewhat restored.  \"Yes, miss, it is; but it ain't equal to whale's-brain fritters, it ain't; them's first-chop.\"  \"Have whales got brains?\" inquired Miss Martha, in surprise.  \"Brains!\" echoed Miss Jane, in amazement.  \"Yes, madam, they 'ave,\" answered the first mate, who had hitherto maintained silence, but having finished tea was now ready for any amount of talk; \"and what's more remarkable still, they've got several barrels of oil in their skulls besides.\"  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed the sisters.  \"Yes, ladies, capital oil it is, too; fetches a 'igher price hin the markit than the other sort.\"  \"By the bye, Millons, didn't you once fall into a whale's skull, and get nearly drowned in oil?\" inquired the doctor.  \"I did,\" answered the first mate, with the air of a man who regarded such an event as a mere trifle, that, upon consideration, might almost be considered as rather a pleasant incident than otherwise in one's history.  \"Nearly drowned in oil!\" exclaimed the sisters, while Ailie opened her eyes in amazement, and Mr Rokens became alarmingly purple in the face with suppressed chuckling.  \"It's true,\" remarked Rokens, in a hoarse whisper to Miss Martha, putting his hand up to his mouth, the better to convey the sound to her ears; \"I seed him tumble in, and helped to haul him out.\"  \"Let's have the story, Millons,\" cried the captain, pushing forward his cup to be replenished; \"It's so long since I heard it, that I've almost forgotten it.  Another cup o' tea, Martha, my dear--not quite so strong as the last, and three times as sweet.  I'll drink `Success to the cup that cheers, but don't inebriate.'  Go ahead, Millons.\"  Nothing rejoiced the heart of Mr Millons more than being asked to tell a story.  Like most men who are excessively addicted to the habit, his stories were usually very long and very dry; but he had a bluff good-natured way of telling them, that rendered his yarns endurable on shore, and positively desirable at sea.  Fortunately for the reader, the story he was now requested to relate was not a long one.  \"It ain't quite a _story_,\" he began--and in beginning he cleared his throat with emphasis, thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his vest, and tilted his chair on its hind-legs--\"it ain't quite a story; it's a hanecdote, a sort of hincident, so to speak, and this is 'ow it 'appened:--  \"Man"]]]
