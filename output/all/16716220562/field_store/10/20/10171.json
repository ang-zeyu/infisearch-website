What was the name of the ship?\"  \"The `Fairy Queen.'\"  \"The `Fairy Queen,'\" echoed Kenneth, with a slight feeling of disappointment; \"from Australia?\"  \"Yes, from Australia.\"  \"Did she go to pieces?\"  \"Ay, not an inch of her left.  She was an old rotten tub not fit for sea.\"  \"Indeed!  That's by no means an uncommon state of things,\" said Kenneth, with some degree of warmth.  \"It seems to me that until men in power take the matter up, and get a more rigid system of inspection instituted, hundreds of lives will continue to be sacrificed every year. It is an awful thing to think that more than a thousand lives are lost annually on our shores, and that because of the indifference of those who have the power, to a large extent, to prevent it.  But that is not the point on which I want to speak to you to-day.  Was the `Fairy Queen' bound for this port?\"  \"No; for the port of London,\" said Gaff, with a cautious glance at his questioner.  \"Then why did she make for Wreckumoft?\" inquired Kenneth.  \"That's best known to the cap'n, who's gone to his long home,\" said Gaff gravely.  \"Were _all_ lost except yourself?\" pursued Kenneth, regarding his companion's face narrowly; but the said face exhibited no expression whatever as its owner replied simply--  \"It's more than _I_ can tell; mayhap some of 'em were carried away on bits o' wreck and may turn up yet.\"  \"At all events none of them came ashore, to your knowledge?\"  \"I believe that every mother's son o' the crew wos lost but me,\" replied Gaff evasively.  \"Were none of the children saved?\"  \"What child'n?\" asked the other quickly.  \"I didn't say there was child'n aboord, did I?\"  Kenneth was somewhat confused at having made this slip; and Gaff, suddenly changing his tactics, stopped short and said--  \"I tell 'ee wot it is, young man--seems to me you're pumpin' of me for some ends of yer own as I'm not acquainted with; now, I tell 'ee wot it is, I ain't used to be pumped.  No offence meant, but I ain't used to be pumped, an' if you've got anything to say, speak it out fair and above board like a man.\"  \"Well, well, Gaff,\" said Kenneth, flushing and laughing at the same moment, \"to say truth, I am not used to pump, as you may see, nor to be otherwise than fair and aboveboard, as I hope you will believe; but the fact is that a very curious thing has occurred at our house, and I am puzzled as well as suspicious, and _very_ anxious about it.\"  Here Kenneth related all that he knew about the little girl having been left at Seaside Villa, and candidly admitted his suspicion that the child was his niece.  \"But,\" said Gaff, whose visage was as devoid of expression as a fiddle figure-head, \"your brother-in-law's name was Graham, you know.\"  \"True, that's what puzzles me; the child's Christian name is Emma--the same as that of my niece and sister--but she says her last name is Wilson.\"  \"Well, then, Wilson ain't Graham, you know, any more nor Gaff ain't Snooks, d'ye see?\"  \"Yes, I see; but I'm puzzled, for I _do_ see a family likeness to my sister in this child, and I _cannot_ get rid of the impression, although I confess that it seems unreasonable.  And the thought makes me very anxious, because, if I were correct in my suspicion, that would prove that my beloved sister and her husband are drowned.\"  Kenneth said this with strong feeling, and the seaman looked at him more earnestly than he had yet done.  \"Your father was hard on your sister and her husband, if I bean't misinformed,\" said Gaff.  \"He thought it his duty to be so,\" answered Kenneth.  \"And you agreed with him?\" pursued Gaff.  \"No, never!\" cried the other indignantly.  \"I regretted deeply the course my father saw fit to pursue.  I sympathised very strongly with my dear sister and poor Tom Graham.\"  \"Did you?\" said Gaff.  \"Most truly I did.\"  \"Hum.  You spoke of suspicions--wot was your suspicions?\"  \"To be candid with you, then,\" said Kenneth, \"when I came to see you I suspected that it was _you_ who left that child at our house, for I heard of your sudden re-appearance in Cove, but I am convinced now that I was wrong, for I know you would not tell me a falsehood, Gaff.\"  \"No more I would, sir,\" said Gaff, drawing himself up, \"and no more I _did_; but let me tell to you, sir, nevertheless, that your suspicions is c'rect.  _I_ left Emmie Wilson at your house, and Emmie Wilson _is_ Emma Graham!\"  Kenneth stopped and looked earnestly at his companion.  \"My sister and brother?\" he asked in a low suppressed voice.  \"Dead, both of 'em,\" said Gaff.  With a mighty effort Kenneth restrained his feelings, and, after walking in silence for some time, asked why Gaff had concealed this from his family, and how it happened that the child did not know her proper name.  \"You see, sir,\" replied the sailor, \"I've know'd all along of your father's ill-will to Mr Graham and his wife, for I went out with them to Australia, and they tuk a fancy to me, d'ye see, an' so did I to them, so we made it up that we'd jine company, pull in the same boat, so to speak, though it _was_ on the land we was goin' and not the sea. There's a proverb, sir, that says, `misfortin makes strange bed fellows,' an' I 'spose it's the same proverb as makes strange messmates; anyhow, poor Tom Graham, he an' me an' his wife, we become messmates, an' of course we spun no end o' yarns about our kith and kin, so I found out how your father had treated of 'em, which to say truth I warn't s'prised at, for I've obsarved for years past that he's hard as nails, altho' he _is_ your father, sir, an' has let many a good ship go to the bottom for want o' bein' properly found--\"  \"You need not criticise my father, Gaff,\" said Kenneth, with a slight frown.  \"Many men's sins are not so black as they look.  Prevailing custom and temptation may have had more to do with his courses of action than hardness of heart.\"  \"I dun know _that_,\" said Gaff, \"hows'ever, I don't mean for to krittysise him, though I'm bound to say his sins is uncommon dark grey, if they ain't black.  Well, I wos a-goin' to say that Mr Graham had some rich relations in Melbourne as he didn't want for to see.  He was a proud man, you know, sir, an' didn't want 'em to think he cared a stiver for 'em, so he changed his name to Wilson, an' let his beard an' mowstaches grow, so that when he put his cap on there was nothin' of him visible except his eyes and his nose stickin' out of his face, an' when his hair grew long, an' his face was tanned wi' the sun, his own mother would have cut him dead if she'd met him in the street.  \"Well, we worked a year in Melbourne to raise the wind.  Tom, (he made me call him Tom, sir), bein' a clever fellow, got into a store as a clerk, an' I got work as a porter at the quays; an' though his work was more gentlemanly than mine, I made very near as much as him, so we lived comfortable, and laid by a little.  That winter little Emma was born. She just come to poor Tom and his wife like a great sunbeam.  Arter that we went a year to the diggin's, and then I got to weary to see my old missus, so I left 'em with a promise to return.  I com'd home, saw my wife, and then went out again to jine the Grahams for another spell at the diggin's; then I come home again for another spell wi' the missus, an' so I kep' goin' and comin', year by year, till now.  \"Tom was a lucky digger.  He resolved to quit for good and all, and return to settle in England.  He turned all he had into gold-dust, and put it in a box, with which he shipped aboard the `Fairy Queen,' of which I was one o' the crew at the time.  The `Fairy Queen,' you must understand, had changed owners just about that time, havin' bin named the `Hawk' on the voyage out.  We sailed together, and got safe to British waters, an' wos knocked all to bits on British rocks, 'cause the compasses wasn't worth a button, as no more wos our charts, bein' old ones, an' the chain o' the best bower anchor had bin got cheap, and wasn't fit to hold a jolly-boat, so that w'en we drove on a lee-shore, and let go the anchor to keep off the reefs, it parted like a bit o' packthread.  I took charge of Emmie, and, by God's blessin', got safe to land.  All the rest went down.  \"Now, sir,\" continued Gaff, \"it came into my head that if I took the little gal to her grandfather, he, bein' as hard as nails, an' desp'rit unforgivin', would swear I wos tellin' a lie, and refuse to take her in. So I thought I'd just go and put her down in the passage an' leave her, so that he'd be obleeged to take her in, d'ye see, not bein' able to see what else to do wi' her.  You know he couldn't throw her out, and let her die in the street, could he, sir?\"  \"Not exactly,\" replied Kenneth, with a sad smile, \"nevertheless he would not find it difficult to dispose of her in some other way; in fact, he has already spoken of sending her to the workhouse.\"  \"You don't say so, sir?\"  \"Indeed I do, but keep your mind easy, Gaff, for, without telling my father who little Emmie is, I will see to it that she is properly cared for.\"  Kenneth rode back to town that day with a heart so heavy that the bright eyes of Lizzie Gordon failed to rouse him to even the semblance of cheerfulness, and the effervescing small-talk of the volatile Gildart was almost intolerable.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  DAN HORSEY DOES THE AGREEABLE IN THE KITCHEN.  \"Captain Bingley,\" said Kenneth, entering my study somewhat hastily on the following morning, \"I am going to carry off Gildart for the day to have a ride with me, and I looked in on you in passing to tell you that Haco has arrived in his schooner, and that he is going to sail this evening for London and will take your Russians to their consul if you wish it.\"  \"Thank you, lad; many thanks,\" said I, \"some of them may be able to go, but others, I fear, are too much hurt, and may require to be nursed in the `Home' for some time yet.

BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE HUNTERS.  It was on a cold winter morning long ago, that Robin Gore, a bold hunter of the backwoods of America, entered his parlour and sat him down to breakfast.  Robin's parlour was also his dining-room, and his drawing-room, besides being his bedroom and his kitchen.  In fact, it was the only room in his wooden hut, except a small apartment, opening off it, which was a workshop and lumber-room.  Robin's family consisted of himself, and his wife, and his son Roy, who was twelve years of age--and his daughter Nelly, who was eight, or thereabout.  In addition to these, his household comprised a nephew, Walter and an Irishman, Larry O'Dowd.  The former was tall, strong, fearless, and twenty.  The latter was stout, short, powerful, and forty.  The personal history of Robin Gore, to the point at which we take it up, runs briefly thus:--  He had been born in a backwood's settlement, had grown up and married in the little hamlet in which he had been born, and hunted around it contentedly until he was forty years of age.  But, as population increased, he became restive.  He disliked restraint; resolved to take his wife and family into the wilderness and, after getting his nephew and an Irish adventurer to agree to accompany him, carried his resolution into effect.  He travelled several hundreds of miles into the woods--beyond the most remote settlement--built three wooden huts, surrounded them with a tall stockade, set up a flagstaff in the centre thereof, and styled the whole affair, \"Fort Enterprise.\"  \"I'm sorry to bring you to such a lonesome spot, Molly, my dear,\" said Robin, as he sat on the trunk of a fallen tree, on the afternoon of the day on which he arrived at the scene of his future home; \"it'll be rayther tryin' at first, but you'll soon get used to it, and we won't be bothered hereaway wi' all the new-fangled notions o' settlement folk. We'll dwell in the free wilderness, where there are no tyrannical laws to hamper a man, an' no nonsensical customs to fix the fashion of his coat an' leggins.  Besides, you'll have Roy an' Nelly an' Walter an' Larry to keep you company, lass, not to mention our neighbours to look in upon now and again.\"  \"Very true, Robin,\" replied the wife, \"I have no doubt it will be quite cheery and homelike in course of time.\"  She looked out upon the broad bosom of the lake which lay before the site of their forest home, and sighed.  It was evident that Mrs Gore had a strong partiality for the laws and customs which her husband abhorred.  The \"neighbours\" to whom Robin referred lived in a leather tent twenty miles distant from the Fort.  They were an Indian, named \"The Black Swan,\" his wife, named \"The White Swan,\" and a half-caste trapper, whose proper name was unknown to all save himself.  His cognomen in the wilderness was \"Slugs,\" a name which originated in his frequent use of clipped pieces of lead instead of shot in the loading of his gun.  But to return to the point from which we started:--  It was on a cold winter morning that Robin Gore entered his parlour and sat him down to breakfast.  It was not only cold--very cold; colder than ever was experienced in our favoured British isles--but it was also very dark.  Robin had risen before daybreak in order to visit his traps, and shoot some game as early in the day as possible.  The larder chanced to be nearly empty that day, a fact which was all the more to be regretted that it was New Year's day, and, as Robin remarked, \"that day didn't occur more than once in the year.\"  This statement Larry O'Dowd disputed, affirming that it occurred \"at laste twice ivery year--wance at the beginnin' an' wance at the end of it!\"  \"Come along, lad,\" said Robin, trimming the candle as his nephew Walter entered, \"we'll ha' to make the most of our time to-day, for we dine at sharp five p.m., an' our dinner--leastwise the most of it--is at this moment alive an' kickin', if it's not sleepin', in the forest, and has got to be found and shot yet.  Hallo! boy, where are _you_ bound for?\"  \"For the woods, father, with you and Walter,\" replied his son Roy, sitting down and coolly helping himself to a portion of bear's meat, with which the hunter was regaling himself.  \"Nonsense, boy,\" said Robin, somewhat gruffly.  \"You'll not be able to keep up with us,\" added Walter, \"for we've little time before us, an' a long way to go.\"  \"If I break down I can turn back,\" retorted Roy.  \"Very good; please yourself;\" said Robin in a tone of indifference, although his glance seemed to indicate that he was not sorry to see his boy determined to attempt an expedition which he knew from experience would be very trying to a lad of his years.  Breakfast over, the three hunters clothed themselves in habiliments suitable to the climate--leathern coats and trousers which were impervious to the wind; cloth leggings to keep the snow from the trousers; leather mocassins, or shoes with three pairs of blanket socks inside of them; fur-caps with ear-pieces; leather mittens with an apartment for the fingers and a separate chamber for the thumb, powder-horns, shot-pouches, guns, and snow-shoes.  These latter were light wooden frames, netted across with deerskin threads, about five feet long and upwards of a foot wide.  The shoes were of this enormous size, in order that they might support the wearers on the surface of the snow, which was, on an average, four feet deep in the woods.  They were clumsy to look at, but not so difficult to walk in as one might suppose.  In silence the three hunters entered the dark woods in front of Fort Enterprise.  Robin went first and beat the track, Walter followed in his footsteps, Roy brought up the rear.  The father sank about six inches at every step, but the snow which fell upon his snow-shoes was so fine and dry, owing to the intense frost, that it fell through the net-work of the shoes like dust.  Walter and Roy, treading in the footsteps, had less labour in walking, but Walter, being almost as strong as his uncle, took his turn at beating the track every two hours.  Through the woods they went, over mound and hollow, across frozen swamp and plain, through brush and break, until near noon, when they halted for rest and refreshment.  While Walter cut firewood, Robin and Roy cleared away the snow, using their snow-shoes as shovels, and prepared their meal.  It was simple; a few mouthfuls of dried meat and a tin can of hot tea--the backwoodsman's greatest luxury, next to his pipe.  It was short, too.  Half an hour sufficed to prepare and consume it.  \"Let's see, now, what we have got,\" said Robin, counting the game before resuming the march.  \"More than enough,\" said Walter, lighting his pipe for a hurried whiff, \"ten brace of white grouse, four rabbits, six red foxes and a black one, and two wolves.  We can't eat all that.\"  \"Surely we won't eat the foxes and wolves!\" cried Roy, laughing.  \"Not till we're starvin',\" replied his father.  \"Come, let's go on--are ye tired, lad?\"  \"Fresh as Walter,\" said the boy, proudly.  \"Well, we won't try you too much.  We'll just take a sweep round by the Wolf's Glen, an' look at the traps there--after which make for home and have our New Year's dinner.  Go ahead, Walter, and beat the track; it is your turn this time.\"  Without speaking, Walter slipped his feet into the lines of his snow-shoes, extinguished his pipe, and led the way once more through the pathless forest.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE STARVED INDIAN.  In the depths of the same forest, and not far from the locality to which we have introduced our reader, a Red Indian was dragging his limbs wearily along over the untrodden snow.  The attenuated frame of this son of the soil, his hollow cheeks and glaring eye-balls, his belt drawn with extreme tightness round his waist, to repress the gnawings of hunger, as well as his enfeebled gait, proved that he was approaching the last stage of starvation.  For many weeks Wapaw had been travelling in the woods, guided on his way by the stars, and by those slight and delicate signs of the wilderness-- such as the difference of thickness in the bark on the north, from that on the south side of a tree--which are perceptible only to the keen eye of an Indian, or a white man whose life has been spent in the wilderness.  But Wapaw was a very different man, when he quitted his tribe, from what he was at the time we introduce him to our reader.  Strong, wiry, upright, and lithe as a panther, he left his wigwam and his wife, and turned his face towards the rising sun; but the season was a severe one, and game was scarce; from the very beginning of his journey he had found it difficult to supply himself with a sufficiency of food.  Towards the middle of it he was on short allowance, and much reduced in strength; and now near its termination, he was, as we have said, almost in the last stage of starvation.  Fort Enterprise was Wapaw's goal.  He had never been there before, but from the description of the place and its locality, given by those of his kindred who had visited Robin Gore, he was able to direct his march with unerring certainty towards it.  Of course, as he drew near to it he could not ascertain his exact distance--whether he was a day or several days' journey off--but from the tracks of Robin's snow-shoes, which he crossed more than once, he guessed that he was nearing the Fort, and pushed on with renewed hope and energy.  Robin, however, was an active hunter.  He often made long and rapid marches from his lonely dwelling--sometimes staying away a week or two at a time even in winter; so that Wapaw thought himself nearer Fort Enterprise than he really was, when he first discovered the bold hunter's tracks.  When, at length, he did arrive at less than a day's journey from the Fort, he was not aware of its close proximity, and, having tasted nothing whatever for two days, he felt the approach of that terrible state of exhaustion which precedes death.  It was a"]]]
