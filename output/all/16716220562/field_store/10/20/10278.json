We'll make that the penalty of runnin' off again; so look out, Master Dick.\"  \"I'm down,\" replied Dick with a modest air, \"obedient as a baby, and won't run off again--till--the next time.  By the way, Joe, how many days' provisions did ye bring?\"  \"Two.  That's 'nough to carry us to the Great Prairie, which is three weeks distant from this; our own good rifles must make up the difference, and keep us when we git there.\"  \"And s'pose we neither find deer nor buffalo,\" suggested Dick.  \"I s'pose we'll have to starve.\"  \"Dat is cumfer'able to tink upon,\" remarked Henri.  \"More comfortable to think o' than to undergo,\" said Dick, \"but I s'pose there's little chance o' that.\"  \"Well, not much,\" replied Joe Blunt, patting his horse's neck; \"but d'ye see, lad, ye niver can count for sartin on anythin'.  The deer and buffalo ought to be thick in them plains at this time--and when the buffalo _are_ thick they covers the plains till ye can hardly see the end o' them; but, ye see, sometimes the rascally Red-skins takes it into their heads to burn the prairies, and sometimes ye find the place that should ha' bin black wi' buffalo, black as a coal wi' fire for miles an' miles on end.  At other times the Red-skins go huntin' in 'ticlar places, and sweeps them clean o' every hoof that don't git away. Sometimes, too, the animals seems to take a scunner at a place and keeps out o' the way.  But one way or another men gin'rally manage to scramble through.\"  \"Look yonder, Joe,\" exclaimed Dick, pointing to the summit of a distant ridge, where a small black object was seen moving against the sky, \"that's a deer, ain't it?\"  Joe shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed earnestly at the object in question.  \"Yer right, boy; and by good luck we've got the wind of him. Cut in an' take your chance now.  There's a long strip o' wood as'll let ye git close to him.\"  Before the sentence was well finished, Dick and Crusoe were off at full gallop.  For a few hundred yards they coursed along the bottom of a hollow; then turning to the right they entered the strip of wood, and in a few minutes gained the edge of it.  Here Dick dismounted.  \"You can't help me here, Crusoe.  Stay where you are, pup, and hold my horse.\"  Crusoe seized the end of the line, which was fastened to the horse's nose, in his mouth, and lay down on a hillock of moss, submissively placing his chin on his fore-paws, and watching his master as he stepped noiselessly through the wood.  In a few minutes Dick emerged from among the trees, and, creeping from bush to bush, succeeded in getting to within six hundred yards of the deer, which was a beautiful little antelope.  Beyond the bush behind which he now crouched all was bare open ground, without a shrub or hillock large enough to conceal the hunter.  There was a slight undulation in the ground, however, which enabled him to advance about fifty yards further, by means of lying down quite flat and working himself forward like a serpent.  Further than this he could not move without being seen by the antelope, which browsed on the ridge before him in fancied security.  The distance was too great even for a long shot, but Dick knew of a weak point in this little creature's nature which enabled him to accomplish his purpose--a weak point which it shares in common with animals of a higher order,--namely, curiosity.  The little antelope of the North American prairies is intensely curious about everything that it does not quite understand, and will not rest satisfied until it has endeavoured to clear up the mystery.  Availing himself of this propensity, Dick did what both Indians and hunters are accustomed to do on these occasions,--he put a piece of rag on the end of his ramrod, and, keeping his person concealed and perfectly still, waved this miniature flag in the air.  The antelope noticed it at once, and, pricking up its ears, began to advance, timidly and slowly, step by step, to see what remarkable phenomenon it could be.  In a few seconds the flag was lowered, a sharp crack followed, and the antelope fell dead upon the plain.  \"Ha, boy! that's a good supper, anyhow,\" cried Joe, as he galloped up and dismounted.  \"Goot! dat is better nor dried meat,\" added Henri.  \"Give him to me; I will put him on my hoss, vich is strongar dan yourn.  But ver is your hoss?\"  \"He'll be here in a minute,\" replied Dick, putting his fingers to his mouth and giving forth a shrill whistle.  The instant Crusoe heard the sound he made a savage and apparently uncalled-for dash at the horse's heels.  This wild act, so contrary to the dog's gentle nature, was a mere piece of acting.  He knew that the horse would not advance without getting a fright, so he gave him one in this way which sent him off at a gallop.  Crusoe followed close at his heels, so as to bring the line alongside of the nag's body, and thereby prevent its getting entangled; but despite his best efforts the horse got on one side of a tree and he on the other, so he wisely let go his hold of the line, and waited till more open ground enabled him to catch it again.  Then he hung heavily back, gradually checked the horse's speed, and finally trotted him up to his master's side.  \"'Tis a cliver cur, good sooth,\" exclaimed Joe Blunt in surprise.  \"Ah, Joe! you haven't seen much of Crusoe yet.  He's as good as a man any day.  I've done little else but train him for two years gone by, and he can do most anything but shoot--he can't handle the rifle nohow.\"  \"Ha! then, I tink perhaps hims could if he wos try,\" said Henri, plunging on to his horse with a laugh, and arranging the carcase of the antelope across the pommel of his saddle.  Thus they hunted and galloped, and trotted and ambled on through wood and plain all day, until the sun began to descend below the tree-tops of the bluffs on the west--then Joe Blunt looked about him for a place on which to camp, and finally fixed on a spot under the shadow of a noble birch by the margin of a little stream.  The carpet of grass on its banks was soft like green velvet, and the rippling waters of the brook were clear as crystal--very different from the muddy Missouri into which it flowed.  While Dick Varley felled and cut up firewood, Henri unpacked the horses and turned them loose to graze, and Joe kindled the fire and prepared venison steaks and hot tea for supper.  In excursions of this kind it is customary to \"hobble\" the horses; that is, to tie their fore-legs together, so that they cannot run either fast or far, but are free enough to amble about with a clumsy sort of hop in search of food.  This is deemed a sufficient check on their tendency to roam, although some of the knowing horses sometimes learn to hop so fast with their hobbles as to give their owners much trouble to recapture them.  But when out in the prairies where Indians are known or supposed to be in the neighbourhood, the horses are picketed by means of a pin or stake attached to the ends of their long laryats, as well as hobbled-- for Indians deem it no disgrace to steal or tell lies, though they think it disgraceful to be found out in doing either.  And so expert are these dark-skinned natives of the western prairies, that they will creep into the midst of an enemy's camp, cut the laryats and hobbles of several horses, spring suddenly on their backs, and gallop away.  They not only steal from white men, but tribes that are at enmity steal from each other, and the boldness with which they do this is most remarkable.  When Indians are travelling in a country where enemies are prowling, they guard their camps at night with jealous care.  The horses in particular are both hobbled and picketed, and sentries are posted all round the camp.  Yet, in spite of these precautions, hostile Indians manage to elude the sentries, and creep into the camp.  When a thief thus succeeds in effecting an entrance, his chief danger is past.  He rises boldly to his feet, and, wrapping his blanket or buffalo robe round him, he walks up and down as if he were a member of the tribe.  At the same time he dexterously cuts the laryats of such horses as he observes are not hobbled.  He dare not stoop to cut the hobbles, as the action would be observed, and suspicion would be instantly aroused.  He then leaps on the best horse he can find, and uttering a terrific war-whoop darts away into the plains, driving the loosened horses before him.  No such dark thieves were supposed to be near the camp under the birch-tree, however, so Joe, and Dick, and Henri ate their supper in comfort, and let their horses browse at will on the rich pasturage.  A bright ruddy fire was soon kindled, which created, as it were, a little ball of light in the midst of surrounding darkness for the special use of our hardy hunters.  Within this magic circle all was warm, comfortable, and cheery.  Outside all was dark, and cold, and dreary by contrast.  When the substantial part of supper was disposed of, tea and pipes were introduced, and conversation began to flow.  Then the three saddles were placed in a row; each hunter wrapped himself in his blanket, and, pillowing his head on his saddle, stretched his feet towards the fire and went to sleep, with his loaded rifle by his side and his hunting-knife handy in his belt.  Crusoe mounted guard by stretching himself out _couchant_ at Dick Varley's side.  The faithful dog slept lightly and never moved all night, but had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],["title","The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#8)"],["body","one observed him closely he would have seen that every fitful flame that burst from the sinking fire, every unusual puff of wind, and every motion of the horses that fed or rested hard by, had the effect of revealing a speck of glittering white in Crusoe's watchful eye.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE GREAT PRAIRIES OF THE \"FAR WEST\"--A REMARKABLE COLONY DISCOVERED, AND A MISERABLE NIGHT ENDURED.  Of all the hours of the night or day the hour that succeeds the dawn is the purest, the most joyous and the best.  At least so think we; and so think hundreds and thousands of the human family; and so thought Dick Varley, as he sprung suddenly into a sitting posture next morning, and threw his arms with an exulting feeling of delight round the neck of Crusoe, who instantly sat up to greet him.  This was an unusual piece of enthusiasm on the part of Dick, but the dog received it with marked satisfaction, rubbed his big hairy cheek against that of his young master, and arose from his sedentary position in order to afford free scope for the use of his tail.  \"Ho!  Joe Blunt!  Henri!  Up, boys, up!  The sun will have the start o' us.  I'll catch the nags.\"  So saying Dick bounded away into the woods with Crusoe gambolling joyously at his heels.  Dick soon caught his own horse and Crusoe caught Joe's.  Then the former mounted and quickly brought in the other two.  Returning to the camp he found everything packed and ready to strap on the back of the pack-horse.  \"That's the way to do it, lad,\" cried Joe.  \"Here Henri, look alive and git yer beast ready.  I do believe yer goin' to take another snooze!\"  Henri was indeed, at that moment, indulging in a gigantic stretch and a cavernous yawn, but he finished both hastily, and rushed at his poor horse as if he intended to slay it on the spot.  He only threw the saddle on its back, however, and then threw himself on the saddle.  \"Now then, all ready?\"  \"Ay,--oui, yis!\"  And away they went at full stretch again on their journey.  Thus day after day they travelled, and night after night they laid them down to sleep under the trees of the forest, until at length they reached the edge of the Great Prairie.  It was a great, a memorable day in the life of Dick Varley, that on which he first beheld the prairie,--the vast boundless prairie.  He had heard of it, talked of it, dreamed about it, but he had never,--no, he had never realised it.  'Tis always thus.  Our conceptions of things that we have not seen are almost invariably wrong.  Dick's eyes glittered, and his heart swelled, and his cheeks flushed, and his breath came thick and quick.  \"There it is,\" he gasped, as the great rolling plain broke suddenly on his enraptured gaze; \"that's it--oh!--\"  Dick uttered a yell that would have done credit to the fiercest chief of the Pawnees, and, being unable to utter another word, he swung his cap in the air and sprang like an arrow from a bow over the mighty ocean of grass.  The sun had just risen to send a flood of golden glory over the scene; the horses were fresh, so the elder hunters, gladdened by the beauty of all around them, and inspired by the irresistible enthusiasm of their young companion, gave the reins to the horses and flew after him.  It was a glorious gallop, that first headlong dash over the boundless prairie of the \"far west!\"  The prairies have often been compared, most justly, to the ocean.  There is the same wide circle of space bounded on all sides by the horizon; there is the same swell, or undulation, or succession of long low unbroken waves that marks the ocean when it is calm; they are canopied by the same pure sky, and swept by the same untrammelled breezes.  There are islands, too--clumps of trees and willow-bushes,--which rise out of this grassy ocean to break and relieve its uniformity; and these vary in size and numbers as do the isles of ocean--being numerous in some places, while in others they are so scarce that the traveller does not meet one in a long day's journey.  Thousands of beautiful flowers decked the green sward, and numbers of little birds hopped about among them.  \"Now, lads,\" said Joe Blunt, reining up, \"our troubles begin to-day.\"  \"Our troubles! our joys, you mean!\" exclaimed Dick Varley.  \"P'raps I don't mean nothin' o' the sort,\" retorted Joe.  \"Man wos never intended to swaller his joys without a strong mixtur' o' troubles.  I s'pose he couldn't stand 'em pure.  Ye see we've got to the prairie now--\"  \"One blind hoss might see dat!\" interrupted Henri.  \"An' we may or may not diskiver buffalo.  An' water's scarce, too, so we'll need to look out for it pretty sharp, I guess, else we'll lose our horses, in which case we may as well give out at once.  Besides, there's rattlesnakes about in sandy places--we'll ha' to look out for them; an' there's badger holes--we'll need to look sharp for them lest the horses put their feet in 'em; an' there's Injuns, who'll look out pretty sharp for _us_ if they once get wind that we're in them parts.\"  \"Oui, yis, mes boys, and there's rain, and tunder, and lightin',\" added Henri, pointing to a dark cloud which was seen rising on the horizon ahead of them.  \"It'll be rain,\" remarked Joe, \"but there's no thunder in the air jist now; we'll make for yonder clump o' bushes and lay by till it's past.\"  Turning a little to the right of the course they had been following, the hunters galloped along one of the hollows between the prairie waves before mentioned, in the direction of a clump of willows.  Before reaching it however, they passed over a bleak and barren plain where there was neither flower nor bird.  Here they were suddenly arrested by a most extraordinary sight--at least it was so to Dick Varley, who had never seen the like before.  This was a colony of what Joe called \"prairie-dogs.\"  On first beholding them Crusoe uttered a sort of half growl, half bark of surprise, cocked his tail and ears, and instantly prepared to charge, but he glanced up at his master first for permission.  Observing that his finger and his look commanded \"silence\" he dropped his tail at once and stepped to the rear.  He did not, however, cease to regard the prairie-dogs with intense curiosity.  These remarkable little creatures have been egregiously misnamed by the hunters of the west, for they bear not the slightest resemblance to dogs, either in formation or habits.  They are, in fact, the marmot, and in size are little larger than squirrels, which animals they resemble in some degree.  They burrow under the light soil and throw it up in mounds like moles.  Thousands of them were running about among their dwellings when Dick first beheld them, but the moment they caught sight of the horsemen rising over the ridge, they set up a tremendous hubbub of consternation; each little beast instantly mounted guard on the top of his house and prepared, as it were, to \"receive cavalry.\"  The most ludicrous thing about them was, that although the most timid and cowardly creatures in the world, they seemed the most impertinent things that ever lived!  Knowing that their holes afforded them a perfectly safe retreat they sat close beside them, and as the hunters slowly approached, they elevated their heads, wagged their little tails, showed their teeth, and chattered at them like monkeys.  The nearer they came the more angry and furious did the prairie-dogs become, until Dick Varley almost fell off his horse with suppressed laughter.  They let the hunters come close up, waxing louder and louder in their wrath; but the instant a hand was raised to throw a stone or point a gun, a thousand little heads dived into a thousand holes, and a thousand little tails wriggled for an instant in the air--then, a dead silence reigned over the deserted scene.  \"Bien, them's have dive into de bo'-els of de eart',\" said Henri with a broad grin.  Presently a thousand noses appeared, and nervously disappeared like the wink of an eye.  Then they appeared again, and a thousand pairs of eyes followed.  Instantly, like Jack in the box, they were all on the top of their hillocks again, chattering and wagging their little tails as vigorously as ever.  You could not say that you _saw_ them jump out of their holes.  Suddenly, as if by magic, they _were_ out; then Dick tossed up his arms, and, suddenly, as if by magic, they were gone!  Their number was incredible, and their cities were full of riotous activity.  What their occupations were the hunters could not ascertain, but it was perfectly evident that they visited a great deal and gossiped tremendously, for they ran about from house to house, and sat chatting in groups; but it was also observed that they never went far from their own houses.  Each seemed to have a circle of acquaintance in the immediate neighbourhood of his own residence, to which in case of sudden danger he always fled.  But another thing about these prairie-dogs (perhaps, considering their size, we should call them prairie-doggies), another thing about them, we say, was that each doggie lived with an owl, or, more correctly, an owl lived with each doggie!  This is such an extraordinary _fact_, that we could scarce hope that men would believe us, were our statement not supported by dozens of trustworthy travellers who have visited and written about these regions.  The whole plain was covered with these owls.  Each hole seemed to be the residence of an owl and a doggie, and these incongruous couples lived together apparently in perfect harmony.  We have not been able to ascertain from travellers _why_ the owls have gone to live with these doggies, so we beg humbly to offer our own private opinion to the reader.  We assume, then, that owls find it absolutely needful to have holes.  Probably prairie-owls cannot dig holes for themselves.  Having discovered, however, a race of little creatures that could, they very likely determined to take forcible possession of the holes made by them.  Finding, no doubt, that, when they did so, the doggies were too timid to "]]]
