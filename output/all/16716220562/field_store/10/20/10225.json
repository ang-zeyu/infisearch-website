Give way, lads; spring, boys.  Softly now, softly.\"  In another instant the boat's bow was on the whale's head, and Rokens buried a harpoon deep in its side.  \"Stern all!\" thundered the captain.  The men obeyed, and the boat was backed off the whale just in time to escape the blow of its tremendous flukes as it dived into the sea, the blue depths of which were instantly dyed red with the blood that flowed in torrents from the wound.  Down it went, carrying out the line at a rate that caused the chocks through which it passed to smoke.  In a few minutes the line ceased to run out, and the whale returned to the surface.  It had scarcely showed its nose, when the slack of the line was hauled in, and a second harpoon was fixed in its body.  Infuriated with pain, the mighty fish gave vent to a roar like a bull, rolled half over, and lashed the sea with his flukes, till, all round for many yards, it was churned into red slimy foam.  Then he turned round, and dashed off with the speed of a locomotive engine, tearing the boat through the waves behind it, the water curling up like a white wall round the bows.  \"She won't stand that long,\" muttered Glynn Proctor, as he rested on his oar, and looked over his shoulder at the straining line.  \"That she will, boy,\" said the captain; \"and more than that, if need be. You'll not be long of havin' a chance of greasin' your fingers, I'll warrant.\"  In a few minutes the speed began to slacken, and after a time they were able to haul in on the line.  When the whale again came to the surface, a third harpoon was cleverly struck into it, and a spout of blood from its blow-hole showed that it was mortally wounded.  In throwing the harpoon, Tim Rokens slipped his foot, and went down like a stone head-foremost into the sea.  He came up again like a cork, and just as the boat flew past fortunately caught hold of Glynn Proctor's hand.  It was well that the grasp was a firm one, for the strain on their two arms was awful.  In another minute Tim was in his place, ready with his lance to finish off the whale at its next rise.  Up it came again, foaming, breaching, and plunging from wave to wave, flinging torrents of blood and spray into the air.  At one moment he reared his blunt gigantic head high above the sea; the next he buried his vast and quivering carcase deep in the gory brine, carrying down with him a perfect whirlpool of red foam.  Then he rose again and made straight for the boat.  Had he known his own power, he might have soon terminated the battle, and come off the victor, but fortunately he did not.  Tim Rokens received his blunt nose on the point of his lance, and drove him back with mingled fury and terror.  Another advance was made, and a successful lance-thrust delivered.  \"That's into his life,\" cried the captain.  \"So it is,\" replied Rokens.  And so it was.  A vital part had been struck.  For some minutes the huge leviathan lashed and rolled and tossed in the trembling waves in his agony, while he spouted up gallons of blood with every throe; then he rolled over on his back, and lay extended a lifeless mass upon the waters.  \"Now, lads; three cheers for our first whale.  Hip! hip! hip!--\"  The cheer that followed was given with all the energy and gusto inspired by a first victory, and it was repeated again and again, and over again, before the men felt themselves sufficiently relieved to commence the somewhat severe and tedious labour of towing the carcase to the ship.  It was a hard pull, for the whale had led them a long chase, and as the calm continued, those left aboard could not approach to meet the boats. The exhausted men were cheered, however, on getting aboard late that night, to find that the other boats had been equally successful, each of them having captured a sperm-whale.    CHAPTER SIX.  DISAGREEABLE CHANGES--SAGACIOUS CONVERSATIONS, AND A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.  A striking and by no means a pleasant change took place in the general appearance of the _Red Eric_ immediately after the successful chase detailed in the last chapter.  Before the arrival of the whales the decks had been beautifully clean and white, for Captain Dunning was proud of his ship, and fond of cleanliness and order.  A few hours after the said arrival the decks were smeared with grease, oil, and blood, and everything from stem to stern became from that day filthy and dirty.  This was a sad change to poor Ailie, who had not imagined it possible that so sudden and disagreeable an alteration could take place.  But there was no help for it; the duties of the fishery in which they were engaged required that the whales should not only be caught, but cut up, boiled down to oil, and stowed away in the hold in casks.  If the scene was changed for the worse a few hours after the cutting-up operations were begun, it became infinitely more so when the _try-works_ were set going, and the melting-fires were lighted, and huge volumes of smoke begrimed the masts, and sails, and rigging.  It was vain to think of clearing up; had they attempted that, the men would have been over-tasked without any good being accomplished.  There was only one course open to those who didn't like it, and that was--to \"grin and bear it.\"  \"Cutting out\" and \"trying in\" are the terms used by whale-men to denote the processes of cutting off the flesh or \"blubber\" from the whale's carcase, and reducing it to oil.  At an early hour on the following morning the first of these operations was commenced.  Ailie went about the decks, looking on with mingled wonder, interest, and disgust.  She stepped about gingerly, as if afraid of coming in contact with slimy objects, and with her nose and mouth screwed up after the fashion of those who are obliged to endure bad smells.  The expression of her face under the circumstances was amusing.  As for the men, they went about their work with relish, and total indifference as to consequences.  When the largest whale had been hauled alongside, ropes were attached to his head and tail, and the former was secured near the stern of the ship, while the latter was lashed to the bow; the cutting-tackle was then attached.  This consisted of an arrangement of pulleys depending from the main-top, with a large blubber-hook at the end thereof.  The cutting was commenced at the neck, and the hook attached; then the men hove on the windlass, and while the cutting was continued in a spiral direction round the whale's body, the tackle raised the mass of flesh until it reached the fixed blocks above.  This mass, when it could be hauled up no higher, was then cut off, and stowed away under the name of a \"blanket-piece.\"  It weighed upwards of a ton.  The hook being lowered and again attached, the process was continued until the whole was cut off.  Afterwards, the head was severed from the body and hoisted on board, in order that the oil contained in the hollow of it might be baled out.  From the head of the first whale ten barrels of oil were obtained.  The blubber yielded about eighty barrels.  When the \"cutting out\" was completed, and the remnants of bone and flesh were left to the sharks which swarmed round the vessel, revelling in their unusually rich banquet, the process of \"trying in\" commenced. \"Trying in\" is the term applied to the melting of the fat and the stowing of it away in barrels in the form of oil; and an uncommonly dirty process it is.  The large \"blanket-pieces\" were cut into smaller portions, and put into the try-pots, which were kept in constant operation.  At night the ship had all the appearance of a vessel on fire, and the scene on deck was particularly striking and unearthly.  One night several of the men were grouped on and around the windlass, chatting, singing, and \"spinning yarns.\"  Ailie Dunning stood near them, lost in wonder and admiration; for the ears and eyes of the child were assailed in a manner never before experienced or dreamed of even in the most romantic mood of cloud-wandering.  It was a very dark night, darker than usual, and not a breath of wind ruffled the sea, which was like a sheet of undulating glass--for, be it remembered, there is no such thing at any time as absolute stillness in the ocean.  At all times, even in the profoundest calm, the long, slow, gentle swell rises and sinks with unceasing regularity, like the bosom of a man in deep slumber.  Dense clouds of black smoke and occasional lurid sheets of flame rose from the try-works, which were situated between the foremast and the main-hatch.  The tops of the masts were lost in the curling smoke, and the black waves of the sea gleamed and flashed in the red light all round the ship.  One man stood in front of the melting-pot, pitching in pieces of blubber with a two-pronged pitchfork.  Two comrades stood by the pots, stirring up their contents, and throwing their figures into wild uncouth attitudes, while the fire glared in their greasy faces, and converted the front of their entire persons into deep vermilion.  The oil was hissing in the try-pots; the rough weather-beaten faces of the men on the windlass were smeared, and their dirty-white ducks saturated, with oil.  The decks were blood-stained; huge masses of flesh and blubber lay scattered about; sparks flew upwards in splendid showers as the men raked up the fires; the decks, bulwarks, railings, try-works, and windlass were covered with oil and slime, and glistening in the red glare.  It was a terrible, murderous-looking scene, and filled Ailie's mind with mingled feelings of wonder, disgust, and awe, as she leaned on a comparatively clean spot near the foremast, listening to the men and gazing at the rolling smoke and flames.  \"Ain't it beautiful?\" said a short, fat little seaman named Gurney, who sat swinging his legs on the end of the windlass, and pointed, as he spoke, with the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#0)"],["body","IN THE WILDERNESS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE HUNTER.  On a beautiful summer evening, not many years ago, a man was seen to ascend the side of a little mound or hillock, on the top of which he lingered to gaze upon the wild scenery that lay stretched out before him.  The man wore the leathern coat and leggings of a North American hunter, or trapper, or backwoodsman; and well did he deserve all these titles, for Jasper Derry was known to his friends as the best hunter, the most successful trapper, and the boldest man in the backwoods.  Jasper was big and strong as well as bold, but he was not a bully.  Men of true courage are in general peacefully disposed.  Jasper could fight like a lion when there was occasion to do so; but he was gentle and grave, and quiet by nature.  He was also extremely good-humoured; had a low soft voice, and, both in mind and body, seemed to delight in a state of repose.  We have said that his coat was made of leather; the moccasins or Indian shoes on his feet were made of the same material.  When Jasper first put them on they were soft like a glove of chamois leather, and bright yellow; but hard service had turned them into a dirty brown, which looked more business like.  The sun had burned his face and hands to as deep a brown as his coat.  On his head he wore a little round cap, which he had made with his own hands, after having caught the black fox that supplied the fur, in one of his own traps.  A coloured worsted belt bound his coat round his waist, and beneath the coat he wore a scarlet flannel shirt.  A long knife and a small hatchet were stuck in the belt at his back, and in front hung a small cloth bag, which was so thickly ornamented with beads of many colours, that little of the cloth could be seen.  This last was a fire-bag--so called because it contained the flint, steel, and tinder required for making a fire.  It also contained Jasper's pipe and tobacco--for he smoked, as a matter of course.  Men smoke everywhere--more's the pity--and Jasper followed the example of those around him.  Smoking was almost his only fault.  He was a tremendous smoker.  Often, when out of tobacco, he had smoked tea. Frequently he had tried bark and dried leaves; and once, when hard pressed, he had smoked oakum.  He would rather have gone without his supper than without his pipe!  A powder-horn and shot pouch were slung over his shoulders by two cross belts, and he carried a long single-barrelled gun.  I have been thus particular in describing Jasper Derry, because he is our hero, and he is worth describing, being a fine, hearty, handsome fellow, who cared as little for a wild Indian or a grizzly bear as he did for a butterfly, and who was one of the best of companions, as he was one of the best of hunters, in the wilderness.  Having gained the top of the hillock, Jasper placed the butt of his long gun on the ground, and, crossing his hands over the muzzle, stood there for some time so motionless, that he might have been mistaken for a statue.  A magnificent country was spread out before him.  Just in front lay a clear lake of about a mile in extent, and the evening was so still that every tree, stone, and bush on its margin, was reflected as in a mirror.  Here, hundreds of wild ducks and wild geese were feeding among the sedges of the bays, or flying to and fro mingling their cries with those of thousands of plover and other kinds of water-fowl that inhabited the place.  At the lower end of this lake a small rivulet was seen to issue forth and wind its way through woods and plains like a silver thread, until it was lost to view in the far distance.  On the right and left and behind, the earth was covered with the dense foliage of the wild woods.  The hillock on which the western hunter stood, lay in the very heart of that great uncultivated wilderness which forms part of the British possessions in North America.  This region lies to the north of the Canadas, is nearly as large as all Europe, and goes by the name of the Hudson's Bay Territory, or Rupert's Land.  It had taken Jasper many long weeks of hard travel by land and water, in canoes and on foot, to get there; and several weeks of toil still lay before him, ere he could attain the object, for which his journey had been undertaken.  Wicked people say that \"woman is at the bottom of all mischief!\"  Did it never occur to these same wicked individuals, that woman is just as much at the bottom of all good?  Whether for good or for evil, woman was at the bottom of Jasper Perry's heart and affairs.  The cause of his journey was love; the aim and end of it was marriage!  Did true love ever run smooth?  \"No, never,\" says the proverb.  We shall see.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE THREE FRIENDS.  When the hunter had stood for full five minutes gazing at the beautiful scenery by which he was surrounded, it suddenly occurred to him that a pipe would render him much more capable of enjoying it; so he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, leaned his gun on it, pulled the fire-bag from his belt, and began to fill his pipe, which was one of the kind used by the savages of the country, with a stone head and a wooden stem. It was soon lighted, and Jasper was thinking how much more clear and beautiful a landscape looked through tobacco smoke, when a hand was laid lightly on his shoulder.  Looking quickly round, he beheld a tall dark-faced Indian standing by his side.  Jasper betrayed neither alarm nor surprise; for the youth was his own comrade, who had merely come to tell him that the canoe in which they had been travelling together, and which had been slightly damaged, was repaired and ready for service.  \"Why, Arrowhead, you steal on me with the soft tread of a fox.  My ears are not dull, yet I did not hear your approach, lad.\"  A smile lighted up the countenance of the young Indian for a moment, as he listened to a compliment which gratified him much; but the grave expression which was natural to him instantly returned, as he said, \"Arrowhead has hunted in the Rocky Mountains where the men are treacherous; he has learned to tread lightly there.\"  \"No doubt, ye had need to be always on the look out where there are such varmints; but hereaway, Arrowhead, there are no foes to fear, and therefore no need to take yer friends by surprise.  But ye're proud o' your gifts, lad, an' I suppose it's natural to like to show them off. Is the canoe ready?\"  The Indian replied by a nod.  \"That's well, lad, it will be sun-down in another hour, an' I would like to camp on the point of pines to-night; so come along.\"  \"Hist!\" exclaimed the Indian, pointing to a flock of geese which came into view at that moment.  \"Ah! you come of a masterful race,\" said Jasper, shaking his head gravely, \"you're never content when ye've got enough, but must always be killing God's creatures right and left for pure sport.  Haven't we got one grey goose already for supper, an' that's enough for two men surely. Of course I make no account o' the artist, poor cratur', for he eats next to nothin'.  Hows'ever, as your appetite may be sharper set than usual, I've no objection to bring down another for ye.\"  So saying the hunter and the Indian crouched behind a bush, and the former, while he cocked his gun and examined the priming, gave utterance to a series of cries so loud and discordant, that any one who was ignorant of a hunter's ways must have thought he was anxious to drive all the living creatures within six miles of him away in terror.  Jasper had no such wish, however.  He was merely imitating the cry of the wild geese.  The birds, which were at first so far-off that a rifle-ball could not have reached them, no sooner heard the cry of their friends (as they doubtless thought it) than they turned out of their course, and came gradually towards the bush where the two men lay hidden.  The hunter did not cease to cry until the birds were within gunshot. Then he fixed his eye on one of the flock that seemed plump and fat. The long barrel of the gun was quickly raised, the geese discovered their mistake, and the whole flock were thrown into wild confusion as they attempted to sheer off; but it was too late.  Smoke and fire burst from the bush, and an enormous grey goose fell with a heavy crash to the ground.  \"What have you shot? what have you shot?\" cried a shrill and somewhat weak voice in the distance.  In another moment the owner of the voice appeared, running eagerly towards the two men.  \"Use your eyes, John Heywood, an' ye won't need to ask,\" said Jasper, with a quiet smile, as he carefully reloaded his gun.  \"Ah!  I see--a grey swan--no, surely, it cannot be a goose?\" said Heywood, turning the bird over and regarding it with astonishment; \"why, this is the biggest one I ever did see.\"  \"What's yon in the water?  Deer, I do believe,\" cried Jasper, quickly drawing the small shot from his gun and putting in a ball instead. \"Come, lads, we shall have venison for supper to-night.  That beast can't reach t'other side so soon as we can.\"  Jasper leaped quickly down the hill, and dashed through the bushes towards the spot where their canoe lay.  He was closely followed by his companions, and in less than two minutes they were darting across the lake in their little Indian canoe, which was made of birch-bark, and was so light that one man could carry it easily.  While they are thus engaged I will introduce the reader to John Heywood. This individual was a youth of nineteen or twenty years of age, who was by profession a painter of landscapes and animals.  He was tall and slender in person, with straight black hair, a pale haggard-looking face, an excitable nervous manner, and an enthusiastic temperament. Being adventurous in his disposition, he had left his father's home in Canada, and entreated his friend, Jasper Derry, to take him along with him into the wilderness.  At first Jasper was very unwilling to agree to this request; because the young artist was utterly ignorant of"]]]
