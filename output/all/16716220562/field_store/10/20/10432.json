Twice Zaidos was visited by members of his father's family--devoted old servants who begged to do something to free him from his present position, and who questioned him vainly for news of Velo Kupenol.  On the second visit Zaidos decided to entrust the old servant with the papers which he carried.  He opened the flat leather folder in which he had placed them.  They were gone!  Zaidos was well aware that the packet had been on him since the moment he had received it.  He could only think that they had been stolen, while he slept.  But why should any one of the ignorant men about him take papers which could not concern them and leave untouched the large bills folded in the same compartment with the papers?  He reported his loss.  The officers who had been in charge on that eventful night had been transferred, but the new Commandant was just and obliging.  He had a thorough search made of every man in barracks, but the papers were gone.  Without them Zaidos felt himself an outcast.  He resigned himself to his fate.  How foolish he had been to suspect Velo!  He should have been the one of course to care for the valuables, yet he could not but remember his father's anger when Velo had suggested it.  Zaidos knew his father to be a just and generous man; and he knew that there was some good reason for his distrust and dislike, although the time had been too cruelly short for explanations.  The proofs of his identity at all events had disappeared, and in such a mysterious manner that it seemed hopeless to search for them.  Zaidos had always wanted to join the army, but he had anticipated all the honor and pleasure of graduating from West Point, in America.  This was indeed the raw and seamy side of soldiering.  He was a philosopher, however, so he shrugged his shoulders, gave the old servants the best instructions he could about closing up and caring for the estates, and threw himself, body and soul, into his new adventure.  The third day, while they were drilling, an automobile raced up and stopped with a suddenness that nearly threw its occupants from their seats.  It was filled with soldiers, and with them was a little fellow closely bound.  Zaidos looked at him with a sinking heart.  He had never seen the pallid, quivering face, with its wild black eyes.  No, the night had been too dark, but instinct told him that here was the deserting mountaineer.  Zaidos looked away.  The man was dragged through the doors, and again a thick curtain seemed to fall over the incident.  But a load of apprehension seemed to be cast on the soldiers.  They continued to talk about the prisoner in low voices.  Not one of them, with the exception of Zaidos, however, realized the true horror.  It was war times and at such a period there was but one end for desertion.  Zaidos prayed not to see it.  He would not let himself think of it.  He threw himself into his work and with his knowledge of Boy Scout tactics and the wonderful range of their knowledge he passed on to his comrades all he had learned before he had left America on the journey which had had such an exciting end.  He never once suspected the influence he innocently exerted for good.  Boy as he was, he taught the soldiers in his group so much that they were the special objects of attention to their officers.  Drill went smoothly and evenly; the men gained poise and assurance.  Zaidos was almost happy in his work.  Then suddenly on the fifth day the blow fell.  The unbelievable horror came to pass.  Zaidos and his group passed out into the street as usual, early in the morning.  As they made formation a smothered groan like a deep breath escaped them.  Against the blank wall before them, bound, stood the deserter.  Once Zaidos had read a highly colored account of a man who had felt the extremest depth of horror.  The book said that he had felt as though his bones were turning to water, and Zaidos had sneered at the description.  It flashed into his mind when he looked into the wild, chalky countenance of the man against the wall.  He glanced down the line of soldiers.  A stupid blankness seemed to envelop them.  Pale as death they stared at the shaking creature before them.  There was a terrible silence that sounded as loud and beat as fiercely in their ears as the boom of cannon.  Things moved with frightful deliberation. It seemed that they stood for hours staring at the doomed man.  It seemed to take hours of physical, dragging effort to obey the next command and move directly in front of that ghastly face.  Then more moments, hours, or ages, ticked off endlessly with the dull beating of their hearts.  In the face opposite a dull despair dawned slowly. Expression died out.  A fearful understanding of things washed away all earthly hope.  He stared at the file of men in front of him as dumbly as the ox approaching the butcher.  He had deserted, he had been caught, he was to die; that was all.  All the little simplicities of his life lay behind him.  His wife--his little _girl_-wife, the tiny baby, the warm hut, the friendly wildness of the trackless mountains. They were back of him; he could no longer turn to them. Back-to-the-wall he stood, this untrained, undisciplined creature, facing a line of muskets that wavered in the shaking hands of the soldiers.  There was not one of them who would not have faced a regiment, untried as they were, for the men of Greece are heroes; but to stand there and aim at that one poor quaking target. * * * It was a nightmare.  It was delirium.  Zaidos felt his bones turn to water.  He almost fell.  Down the line a man fainted.  The priest approached and, walking swiftly to the condemned man, spoke to him in a low and tender tone.  The man did not reply.  He nodded, but looked at the soldiers.  The priest, tears coursing down his face, stepped back.  There was a brief command, a rattle of arms, another order, a pause, a sharp word.  Then came a snarling report of guns * * * and on the ground before him lay a crumpled heap.  Zaidos, sick to the soul, obeyed the order to retire.  He had fired in the air!  The day passed in a horrid daze.  Two of the firing squad were so ill and shaken that they could only lie on their cots with eyes hidden, and moan.  It was the first tragedy that had entered their simple lives.  The heart of Zaidos rebelled.  He could have stood the rage and fear and excitement of battle, but this unspeakable act in which he had taken part seemed too much.  As night approached he began to fear the quiet hours of the dark.  When he closed his eyes he could see that white, blank face before him.  It was with a deep feeling of relief and gratitude then that he obeyed the order to march to the wharves.  There were forty men included in the command, and they went off gaily, glad of anything as a change from the barracks.  Three transports waited at the wharves.  Zaidos obeyed an order to go aboard the largest, a noble ship ready to put out.  It was crowded with men.  Zaidos, with two others, boarded her.  They were led down and down into the depths of the ship, and with despair Zaidos discovered that he was to be one of the assistant stokers.  The engine-rooms were stifling, notwithstanding the big electric fans that supplied a change of air as it entered through the great air intakes.  The furnaces roared.  A couple of engineers nodded to him and one of them led him to a bunk where he exchanged his uniform for the thin, scant garments suited to his new work.  At once he returned to his new duty.  He found the shifts were short, but the work was so heavy and the heat so intense that at the end of his first duty he went to his stuffy bunk and threw himself down, more exhausted than he had ever been in his life.  He lost track of time down there in the firelighted gloom, and the clock seemed to bring no understanding to him.  At last night came, and he was sent to his bunk again to remain until summoned.  The engineer, who was like an officer in charge, was not a hard man.  He understood the necessity of breaking his boys in gradually.  Zaidos, too tired to sleep, lay in his bunk watching the men about him and listening to their idle or boastful talk.  His native tongue had come back to his remembrance, and it was easy to understand most of them.  Presently he heard groans from the next berth, and a tall soldier came over and looked in.  \"What is the matter with you?\" he said to the complaining youth lying there.  \"I'm sick, I'm going to die!\" said a whining voice.  \"I have been down in the engine-room until I am nearly cooked.  I think my back is broken too.\"  The listening man laughed.  \"Not a bit of it, my boy!\" he said.  \"You are tired out.  That is what ails you.  You have soft muscles evidently.  You will be all right soon.\"  \"I tell you I am about dead!\" insisted the voice.  Zaidos listened, puzzled.  There was a familiar sound in the tones, but for the life of him he could not place the speaker.  \"I tell you I am in a bad way!\" insisted the unseen speaker.  \"I shall appeal this matter to the King as soon as we land.\"  \"That's a good idea,\" said a soldier, nodding.  \"When I came away I left my tobacco pouch in barracks.  I will appeal too.  It is not to be endured!\"  \"You don't understand,\" said the fellow.  \"I am Velo Kupenol, the head of the house of Zaidos.  I am a Count!\"  The tall soldier nodded with a twinkle in his eye.  Zaidos fell back in his bunk with a gasp of surprise, and listened.  \"Is that so?\" said the soldier.  \"I heard of the death of Count Zaidos the other day.  So you are his heir, eh?  I thought he had a son. Where does he appear in this story of yours?\"  \"He is dead,\" said Velo.  (It was he.)  \"He went to America, and has not been heard from.  So I am the heir.  I shall appeal to the King, I tell you!\"  \"All right; all right!\" agreed the soldier, while the others, listening near, laughed.  \"At least it is a pretty story,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21787"],["title","Shelled (#5)"],["body","t.  Stick to it. We like to hear you talk.\"  \"Well, it is so, and I can prove it!\"  \"How?\" said Zaidos, suddenly leaning over the edge of his bunk.  For a full minute Velo stared at him with bulging eyes.  \"How will you prove it?\" said Zaidos with a steady stare.  He leaped to his feet and, shoving the tall soldier out of his way, went to the berth and thrust his furious face close to his cousin's.  \"You won't prove anything!\" he said in a low, tense tone.  \"You have made a fool of yourself and of me.  I won't have my father's name dragged into this mess.  I'm here as Zaidos, the stoker; and you will forget Zaidos of Saloniki as fast as ever you can.  And if I find you telling anything more, I will thrash you, Velo Kupenol, within an inch of your life.  I can do it, too.  I learned that in America, at least. And for the present we are in the same fix.  We are here as common soldiers.  My papers were stolen from me in barracks the night my father died, Velo, so there won't be any proving at all.  We are just a pair of stokers on a transport.  But don't think for a _minute_ that I mean to stay where I am.  A Zaidos cannot be kept in the hold.  I shall do something for the honor of my name, you may be assured of that.  But remember _I am Zaidos, the stoker_.  As I said, if I find that silly tongue of yours wagging, I will make--you--good--and--sorry.\"  He paused, and with keen eyes searched Velo's face to make sure he comprehended it all.  Velo was silent, and Zaidos returned to his cot, once more conscious of his fatigue and lameness.  But Velo, turning to the wall, pressed his face to the hard mattress, and let the deadly hate he bore his cousin fill his very being.  He pressed his hand on the stolen papers hidden in his kit.  Zaidos must die.  Zaidos must die!  All his evil blood boiled in him.  For hours, when he should have been sleeping off his fatigue, as Zaidos was doing, he lay hating and plotting.  A dozen evil schemes formed in his mind, but Velo was a coward.  _He_ did not mean to be caught in anything that looked shady.  When he was finally rid of his cousin, he did not want to be unable to appeal to the King and later enjoy the boundless wealth and vast estates and unblemished honor of the Zaidos name.  Before dawn both boys were called to go into the engine-rooms with their shift.  Zaidos, although lame and aching, was still refreshed by his slumber and ready for work.  But Velo could scarcely drag himself along.  He worked as little as possible, the engineer grumbling at his poor performance.  He kept close to Zaidos, dogging him about like a treacherous and snapping cur.  His chance came finally.  Zaidos, with a great shovel of coal, was approaching the terrible open door of the blazing furnace.  Velo, with his empty shovel, had just left it.  As his cousin passed him he gave a sly twist to the dragging shovel, which threw the corner of it between Zaidos' feet.  He stumbled and fell headlong toward the open door where a horrible death seemed reaching for him.  But as he plunged forward, the chief, who was beside him, turned and shoved his rake against the falling body.  It was enough to change the direction of his fall.  He crashed to the ground safe.  He was on his feet instantly, turning to his cousin with a look where certainty and inquiry were mingled.  But as he opened his mouth to speak, a sudden jar under them was followed by a terrific crash, and in a moment a fearful list of the great vessel disclosed the worst.  The transport had been struck by a submarine and was sinking.  Water rushed into the engine-room and rose toward the immense bed of living coals in the furnaces.  There was a savage hiss of steam.  The ship listed rapidly to port.  A rapid ringing of bells cut the air.  The chief listened.  It was the danger signal, never sounded when any hope of saving the ship remained.  \"Up to the deck for your lives!\" he roared, and throwing down the shovels and rakes, the men and the two boys sped for the entrances. They struggled up with a mob of terrified men who pushed and fought. More and more the big boat leaned to the sea.  When Zaidos finally gained the deck, one rail nearly touched the water.  He thought she would go under immediately, but thanks to some uninjured air chamber below, she hung balanced.  On the bridge the Captain shouted through a megaphone.  \"Jump before she goes!\" he cried.  \"Swim away from the wreck!\"  Zaidos, forgetting all but the present danger, seized his cousin by the arm and rushed him to the side of the ship.  \"Jump!\" he cried.  \"No!\" screamed Velo.  \"No, no!  I am going to stay here!\"  \"Don't you hear the Captain?\" cried Zaidos.  \"Jump!  Jump!\"  Velo pulled back and Zaidos urged him toward the heaving water.  \"It's our one chance, Velo!\" he cried.  \"We will go down with the ship if we stay.\"  He suddenly gave Velo a push and flung him into the water.  Together they swam rapidly from the rail.  As though to give the soldiers the one slim chance for their lives, the ship, leaning on its side, still balanced at the lip of the sea.  Then with a sickening roar the vessel went down.  Zaidos looked over his shoulder.  On the bridge, white haired, erect, undismayed, stood the Captain.  As the waters engulfed him he even smiled.  A fearful force dragged at the boys and swept them toward the great whirlpool made by the ship.  They swam desperately, and just as strength seemed to fail, the pressure was released and they floated in a sea covered with wreckage and with swimming or drowning men.  The boys were swimming close together when Velo gave a cry and clasped Zaidos around the neck in a choking grip.  At once they both went under, and Zaidos fought his way out of the strangling clasp; but Velo seized him by the arm.  They came up, and Zaidos turned on his cousin.  \"Don't, don't let me go!\" Velo begged with staring eyes.  \"I'm getting a cramp!\"  \"Then let go of me!\" cried Zaidos.  \"I'll save you if I can, but don't grab me!\"  Velo, overcome with terror, tried to obey, but his reason was not as strong as his terror.  Once more he tried to grasp Zaidos.  The boy turned, grabbed him by the throat, and forced him under water.  He struggled furiously for a space, then suddenly went limp.  Zaidos drew him to the surface.  He was unconscious.  He supported the unresisting weight on his shoulder, and as he kept afloat, he despairingly scanned the horizon.  Bearing down upon them at full speed he saw an English Red Cross ship!     CHAPTER IV  A STRUGGLE IN THE SEA  Hope rose in Zaidos' bosom.  He gave a sigh of relief.  The boat was only a couple of miles distant, and coming full steam ahead.  Something bumped heavily against Zaidos' shoulder.  It was a dead soldier.  A gaping water-soaked wound on his head sagged open, and told the story as plainly as words could do.  He was supported by a life belt carelessly strapped around him.  The body pressed against Zaidos, bumping him gently as it moved in the wash of the sea.  Still holding Velo with his left arm, Zaidos unbuckled the single strap that held the life belt and the body, released, slipped down into the water and disappeared.  Zaidos, treading water as hard as he could, next managed to get the belt around Velo and buckled it.  He fastened it so high that Velo's head was supported well out of the water; and Zaidos let himself down in the water with a gasp of relief.  He felt that he was good for hours now.  Keeping a hand on the strap of the belt, he turned on his back and floated.  The water was warm, there was a hot sun shining, and with the Red Cross ship approaching, Zaidos felt that he was indeed lucky.  He felt no uneasiness about the Red Cross ship changing its direction; the sea about was full of wreckage and men swimming and clinging to spars and timbers.  It was not as though he and Velo had been alone there in the sea.  The Red Cross ship had no doubt seen the explosion and sinking of the transport.  So Zaidos floated easily beside his unconscious companion, occasionally calling to some hardy swimmer who came near, and expecting soon to see the rescuing vessel approach. Velo opened his eyes, felt the lap of the waves round his shoulders, and gave a convulsive leap out of the sea.  \"Had a good nap?\" asked Zaidos.  Velo groaned.  \"I am going to die,\" he said.  \"Not just yet,\" Zaidos assured him.  \"I wish you would have a little more courage,\" he said crossly.  \"You are in the _greatest_ luck.  The transport is gone, with all her officers and nearly all of the men.  I don't suppose there are more than six or eight hundred afloat out of the three thousand on board.  Look over there, Velo.  There is a Red Cross ship coming along.  She will pick us up, and then we will be all right.\"  Velo looked eagerly and gave a cry of dismay.  \"Oh, oh, _oh_!\" he screamed.  \"We are lost; we are lost!\"  He burst into tears.  Zaidos rolled over and looked.  When you are in the water, as every Boy Scout knows, every object afloat looks mountainous.  A common rowboat looms up like a three master, and Zaidos, looking in the direction of the Red Cross ship, saw a couple of battleships approaching, while a huge Zeppelin like a great bird of prey floated overhead.  How many submarines were playing around beneath him, he could not guess.  One thing was clear.  They were in a position stranger than any story, madder than any dream.  Floating there, almost exhausted in the sea, they were to be in the center of a sea fight.  Velo still wept, and Zaidos himself felt a sob of excitement choke his throat.  \"We are going to get it from both sides,\" he remarked to his cousin. \"That Red Cross ship is trying to get out of range until this thing is over.\"  \"What is going to become of us?\" cried Velo.  \"Don't know!\" said Zaidos.  \"And I don't so much care.  At least I don't mean to worry.  I've watched a lot of poor swimmers go down just from exhaustion; and if we are not rescued, why, we just _won't_, that's all.  I'll tell you one thing, though,"]]]
