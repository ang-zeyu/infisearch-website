When Charlie went out, as we have said, he found that Shank had brought his sister May with him.  This troubled our hero a good deal, for he had purposed having a confidential talk with his old comrade upon future plans and prospects, to the accompaniment of the roaring sea, and a third party was destructive of such intention.  Besides, poor May, although exceedingly unselfish and sweet and good, was at that transition period of life when girlhood is least attractive--at least to young men: when bones are obtrusive, and angles too conspicuous, and the form generally is too suggestive of flatness and longitude; while shyness marks the manners, and inexperience dwarfs the mind.  We would not, however, suggest for a moment that May was ugly.  By no means, but she had indeed reached what may be styled a plain period of life--a period in which some girls become silently sheepish, and others tomboyish; May was among the former, and therefore a drag upon conversation.  But, after all, it mattered little, for the rapidly increasing gale rendered speech nearly impossible.  \"It's too wild a day for you, May,\" said Brooke, as he shook hands with her; \"I wonder you care to be out.\"  \"She _doesn't_ care to be out, but I wanted her to come, and she's a good obliging girl, so she came,\" said Shank, drawing her arm through his as they pressed forward against the blast in the direction of the shore.  Shank Leather had become a sturdy young fellow by that time, but was much shorter than his friend.  There was about him, however, an unmistakable look of dissipation--or, rather, the beginning of it--which accounted for Mrs Brooke's objection to him as a companion for her son.  We have said that the cottage lay about half-a-mile from the shore, which could be reached by a winding lane between high banks.  These effectually shut out the view of the sea until one was close to it, though, at certain times, the roar of the waves could be heard even in Sealford itself.  Such a time was the present, for the gale had lashed the sea into wildest fury, and not only did the three friends hear it, as, with bent heads, they forced their way against the wind, but they felt the foam of ocean on their faces as it was carried inland sometimes in lumps and flakes.  At last they came to the end of the lane, and the sea, lashed to its wildest condition, lay before them like a sheet of tortured foam.  \"Grand! isn't it?\" said Brooke, stopping and drawing himself up for a moment, as if with a desire to combat the opposing elements.  If May Leather could not speak, she could at all events gaze, for she had superb brown eyes, and they glittered, just then, like glowing coals, while a wealth of rippling brown hair was blown from its fastenings, and flew straight out behind her.  \"Look! look there!\" shouted her brother with a wild expression, as he pointed to a part of the rocky shore where a vessel was dimly seen through the drift.  \"She's trying to weather the point,\" exclaimed Brooke, clearing the moisture from his eyes, and endeavouring to look steadily.  \"She'll never weather it.  See! the fishermen are following her along-shore,\" cried young Leather, dropping his sister's arm, and bounding away.  \"Oh! don't leave me behind, Shank,\" pleaded May.  Shank was beyond recall, but our hero, who had also sprung forward, heard the pleading voice and turned back.  \"Here, hook on to me,\" he cried quickly, for he was in no humour to delay.  The girl grasped his arm at once, and, to say truth, she was not much of a hindrance, for, although somewhat inelegant, as we have said, she was lithe as a lizard and fleet as a young colt.  A few minutes brought them to the level shore where Brooke left May to shelter herself with some fisher-women behind a low wall, while he ran along to a spot where a crowd of fishermen and old salts, enveloped in oil-skins, were discussing the situation as they leaned against the shrieking wind.  \"Will she weather it, Grinder, think you?\" he asked of an elderly man, whose rugged features resembled mahogany, the result of having bid defiance to wind and weather for nigh half a century.  \"She may, Mr Brooke, an' she mayn't,\" answered the matter-of-fact man of the sea, in the gruff monotone with which he would have summoned all hands to close reef in a hurricane.  \"If her tackle holds she'll do it. If it don't she won't.\"  \"We've sent round for the rocket anyhow,\" said a smart young fisherman, who seemed to rejoice in opposing his broad chest to the blast, and in listening to the thunder of the waves as they rolled into the exposed bay in great battalions, chasing each other in wild tumultuous fury, as if each were bent on being first in the mad assault upon the shore.  \"Has the lifeboat coxswain been called?\" asked Charlie, after a few minutes' silence, for the voice of contending elements was too great to render converse easy or agreeable.  \"Yes, sir,\" answered the man nearest to him, \"but she's bin called to a wreck in Mussel Bay, an' that brig will be all right or in Davy Jones's locker long afore th' lifeboat 'ud fetch round here.\"  Silence again fell on the group as they gazed out to sea, pushing eagerly down the beach until they were ankle-deep in the foam of each expended wave; for the brig was by that time close on the point of rocks, staggering under more sail than she could carry with safety.  \"She'll do it!\" exclaimed the smart young fisherman, ready to cheer with enthusiastic hope.  \"Done for!  Lost!\" cried one, while something like a groan burst from the others as they saw the brig's topmasts go over the side, and one of her sails blown to ribbons.  She fell away towards the rocks at once.  Like great black teeth these rocks seemed to leap in the midst of the foam, as if longing to grasp the ill-fated vessel, which had, indeed, all but weathered the dangerous point, and all might have been well if her gear had only held; but now, as if paralysed, she drifted into the bay where certain destruction awaited her.  Just at that moment a great cheer arose, for the rocket-cart, drawn by the men of the Coast-Guard, was seen rattling over the downs towards them.  Anxiety for the fate of the doomed brig was now changed into eager hope for the rescue of her crew.  The fishermen crowded round the Coast-Guard men as they ran the cart close down to the water's edge, and some of them--specially the smart young fellow already mentioned--made eager offer of their services.  Charlie Brooke stood aloof, looking on with profound interest, for it was the first time he had ever seen the Manby rocket apparatus brought into action.  He made no hasty offer to assist, for he was a cool youth--even while burning with impatient enthusiasm-- and saw at a glance that the men of the Coast-Guard were well able to manage their own affairs and required no aid from him.  As the brig was coming straight in they could easily calculate where she would strike, so that the rocket men could set up their triangle and arrange their tackle without delay.  This was fortunate, for the wreck was carried shoreward with great rapidity.  She struck at last when within a short distance of the beach, and the faces of those on board could be distinctly seen, and their cries heard, as both masts snapped off and were swept over the side, where they tore at the shrouds like wild creatures, or charged the hulk like battering-rams.  Instantly the billows that had borne the vessel on their crests burst upon her sides, and spurted high in air over her, falling back on her deck, and sweeping off everything that was moveable.  It could be seen that only three or four men were on deck, and these kept well under the lee of the bulwarks near the stern where they were strongest.  \"No passengers, I think,\" said one of the fishermen; \"no women, anyhow.\"  \"Not likely they'd be 'lowed on deck even if there was,\" growled Grinder, in his monotone.  \"Now, then, out o' the way,\" cried the leader of the Coast-Guard men, as he laid a rocket in its place.  \"Line all clear, Fred?\"  \"All clear.\"  Next moment there was a burst of flame, a crash, and a vicious whizz as the powerful projectile leaped from its stand and sped out to sea, in grand defiance of the opposing gale, with its light line behind it.  A cheer marked its flight, but a groan told of its descent into the boiling sea, considerably to the left of the wreck.  \"_What_ a pity!\" cried Shank Leather, who had come close to his friend when the rocket-cart arrived.  \"No matter,\" said Brooke, whose compressed lips and flashing eyes told of deep but suppressed feelings.  \"There are more rockets.\"  He was right.  While he was speaking, another rocket was placed and fired.  It was well directed, but fell short.  Another, and yet another, rose and fell, but failed to reach its mark, and the remainder of the rockets refused to go off from some unknown cause--either because they had been too long in stock or had become damp.  Meantime the brig was tossed farther and farther in, until she stuck quite fast.  Then it became evident that she must soon break up, and her crew perish.  Hasty plans and eager advice were proposed and given. Then the smart young fisherman suddenly sprang forward, and threw off his oil-coat and sou'-wester.  \"Here! hold on!\" he cried, catching up the end of the rocket line, and fastening it round his waist, while he kicked off his heavy boots.  \"You can't do it, Bill,\" cried some.  \"Too far to swim,\" cried others.  \"The seas 'll knock the life out o' ye,\" said Grinder, \"afore you're clear o' the sand.\"  Despite these warnings the brave young fellow dashed into the foam, and plunged straight into the first mighty breaker that towered over his head.  But he was too much excited to act effectively.  He failed to time his plunge well.  The wave fell upon him with a roar and crushed him down.  In a few seconds he was dragged ashore almost insensible.  Example, whether good or bad, is infectious."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21720"],["title","Charlie to the Rescue (#3)"],["body","strapping young fellow, stirred to emulation, ran forward, and, seizing the rope, tied it round his own waist, while they helped poor Bill up the beach and seated him on a sand-bank.  The second youth was more powerful than the first--and cooler.  He made a better attempt, but only got past the first wave, when his comrades, seeing that he was exhausted, drew him back.  Then a third--a broad burly youth--came forward.  At this point the soul of Shank Leather took fire, for he was by no means destitute of generous impulses, and he tried to get hold of the rope.  \"Out o' the way,\" cried the burly youth, giving Leather a rough push that almost sent him on his back; \"we don't want no land-lubbers for this kind o' work.\"  Up to this point Charlie Brooke, although burning with eager desire to take some active part in the rescue, had restrained himself and held back, believing, with characteristic modesty, that the fishermen knew far better than he did how to face the sea and use their appliances; but when he saw his friend stagger backward, he sprang to the front, caught hold of the line, and, seizing the burly fisherman by the arm, exclaimed, \"You'll let _this_ land-lubber try it, anyhow,\" and sent him spinning away like a capsized nine-pin.  There was a short laugh, as well as a cheer at this; but next moment all were gazing at the sea in breathless anxiety, for Brooke had rushed deep into the surf.  He paused one moment, as the great wave curled over him, then went through it head-first with such force that he shot waist-high out of the sea on the other side.  His exceptional swimming-powers now served him well, for his otter-like rapidity of action enabled him to avoid the crushing billows either by diving through them at the right moment, or holding back until they fell, and left him only the mad swirling foam to contend with.  This last was bad enough, but here his great muscular strength and his inexhaustible caloric, with his cork-like power of flotation, enabled him to hold his own without exhaustion until another opportunity of piercing an unbroken wave offered.  Thus he gradually forced his way through and beyond the worst breakers, which are always those nearest shore.  Had any one been close to him, and able calmly to watch his movements, it would have been seen that, great as were the youth's powers, he did not waste them in useless battling with a force against which no man could effectively contend; that, with a cool head, he gave way to every irresistible force, swimming for a moment, as it were, with the current--or, rather, floating easily in the whirlpools--so as to conserve his strength; that, ever and anon, he struck out with all his might, rushing through foam and wave like a fish, and that, in the midst of it all, he saw and seized the brief moments in which he could take a gasping inhalation.  Those who watched him with breathless anxiety on shore saw little of all this as they paid out the line or perched themselves on tiptoe on the few boulders that here and there strewed the sand.  \"Haul him back!\" shouted the man who was farthest out on the line. \"He's used up!\"  \"No, he's not, I know him well!\" roared Shank Leather.  \"Pay out, men-- pay out line!\"  \"Ay, ease away,\" said Grinder, in a thunderous growl.  \"He's a rigler walrus, he is.  Niver see'd sich a feller since I left the southern seas.  Ease away, boys.\"  A cheer followed his remark, for at that moment it was seen that our hero had reached the tail of the eddy which was caused by the hull of the wreck, and that one of her crew had darted from the cover of the vessel's bulwarks and taken shelter under the stump of the mainmast. His object was seen in a moment, for he unhooked a coil of rope from the belaying-pins, and stood ready to heave it to the approaching swimmer. In making even this preparation the man ran very great risk, for the stump was but a partial shelter--each wave that burst over the side sweeping wildly round it and leaping on the man higher than his waist, so that it was very difficult for him to avoid being torn from his position.  Charlie's progress was now comparatively easy.  A few vigorous strokes brought him under the lea of the wreck, which, however, was by no means a quiet spot, for each divided wave, rushing round bow and stern, met there in a tumult of foam that almost choked the swimmer, while each billow that burst over the wreck poured a small Niagara on his head.  How to get on board in such circumstances was a subject that had troubled Charlie's mind as he drew near, but the action of the sailor unhooking the coil of rope at once relieved him.  The moment he came within reach, the sailor, watching his opportunity between waves, threw out the coil.  It was aimed by an accustomed hand and fell on the rescuer's head.  Another minute and young Brooke stood on the deck. Without waiting an instant he leaped under the shelter of the stump of the mainmast beside the seaman.  He was only just in time, for a wave burst in thunder on the weather side of the quivering brig, and, pouring over the bulwarks, almost dragged him from the belaying-pins to which he clung.  The instant the strain was off, he passed a rope round his waist and gave the end of it to the sailor.  \"Here, make it fast,\" he said, beginning to haul with all his might on the line which he had brought from shore.  \"You're the skipper--eh?\"  \"Yes.  Don't waste your breath in speech.  I know what to do.  All's ready.\"  These few words were an unspeakable relief to our hero, who was well aware that the working of the rocket apparatus required a slight amount of knowledge, and who felt from his manner and tone that the skipper was a thorough man.  He glanced upwards as he hauled in the line, assisted by his companion, and saw that a stout rope with two loops on it had been fixed to the stump of the mast.  Just as he noted this with satisfaction a large block with a thin line rove through it emerged from the boiling sea.  It had been attached by the men on shore to the rocket line which Charlie had been hauling out with so much energy.  Its name was indicated by the skipper.  \"Here comes the _whip_,\" he cried, catching hold of the block when it reached him.  \"Hold me up, lad, while I make it fast to them loops.\"  While Charlie obeyed he saw that by fixing the tail-lines of the block quickly to the loops prepared for them, instead of winding them round the mast,--a difficult process in such a sea--much time was saved.  \"There, _our_ part o' the job is done now,\" said the skipper, pulling off his sou'-wester as he spoke and holding it up as a signal to the men on shore.  Meanwhile those to whom he signalled had been watching every movement with intense eagerness, and with the expressions of men whose gaze has to penetrate with difficulty through a haze of blinding spray.  \"They've got the block now,\" cried one man.  \"Does that young feller know about fixin' of it?\" asked another.  \"Clap a stopper on your mugs; they're a-fixin' of it now,\" said old Grinder.  \"There's the signal!  Haul away, lads!\"  We must explain here that the \"whip\" above mentioned was a double or endless line, passing through the block which had been hauled out to the wreck by our hero.  By means of this whip one end of a stout cable was sent off to the wreck, and on this cable a sling-lifebuoy was hung to a pulley and also run out to the wreck.  The working of the apparatus, though simple enough to seamen, would entail a complicated, perhaps incomprehensible, description to landsmen: we therefore pass it by with the remark that, connection with the shore having been established, and the sling-lifebuoy--or life-saving machine--run out, the crew received it with what was meant for a hearty cheer, but which exhaustion modified to a feeble shout.  \"Now, lads,\" cried the skipper to his men, \"look sharp!  Let out the passengers.\"  \"Passengers?\" exclaimed Charlie Brooke in surprise.  \"Ay--my wife an' little gurl, two women and an old gentleman.  You don't suppose I'd keep 'em on deck to be washed overboard?\"  As he spoke two of the men opened the doors of the companion-hatch, and caught hold of a little girl of about five years of age, who was handed up by a woman.  \"Stay! keep her under cover till I get hold of her,\" cried the skipper.  As he was passing from the mast to the companion a heavy sea burst over the bulwarks, and swept him into the scuppers.  The same wave wrenched the child from the grasp of the man who held it and carried it right overboard.  Like an eel, rather than a man, Charlie cleft the foam close behind her, caught her by the skirt and bore her to the surface, when a few strokes of his free arm brought him close under the lee of the wreck just in time to prevent the agonised father from leaping after his child.  There was terrible suspense for a few minutes.  At one moment our hero, with his burden held high aloft, was far down in the hollow of the watery turmoil, with the black hull like a great wall rising above him, while the skipper in the main-chains, pale as death but sternly silent held on with his left hand and reached down with his right--every finger rigid and ready!  Next moment a water-spout, so to speak, bore the rescuer upward on its crest, but not near enough--they went downward again.  Once more the leaping water surged upwards; the skipper's strong hand closed like the grip of death on the dress, and the child was safe while its rescuer sank away from it.  \"Help him!\" shouted the skipper, as he staggered to the shelter of the companion.  But Charlie required no help.  A loose rope hanging over the side caught his eye: he seized it and was on deck again in a few seconds.  A minute later and he was down in the cabin.  There, terror-stricken, sat the skipper's wife, never venturing to move, because she had been told to remain there till called.  Happily she knew nothing of the incident just described.  Beside her sat the other women, and, near to them, a "]]]
