Early on the following morning, Roy and Nelly rose to try the new style of duck-hunting which the former had devised.  \"I wonder if it will do,\" said the little girl, as she tripped along by her brother's side in the direction of a marshy bay, which had been selected as the scene of their experiments.  \"How clever of you to invent such a funny plan!\"  \"Well, I didn't exactly invent it, lass.  The fact is, that I remembered father havin' told me he had read it in a book before he left the settlements.  I _wish_ we had some books.  Pity that we've got no books.\"  \"So it is,\" assented Nell, with a touch of sadness in her tone.  Both Roy and his sister were good readers, having been taught by their mother out of the Bible--the only book that Robin Gore had brought with him from the settlements.  Robin could read, but he did not care much for reading--neither did Walter nor Larry O'Dowd.  Indeed the latter could not read at all.  Mrs Gore had wanted to take a few books with her into the wilderness, but her husband said he thought the Bible was enough for her; so the library at Fort Enterprise was select and small! One good resulted from this--the Bible was read, by all who could read, a great deal more than would have been the case had there been other books at hand.  But the young people longed earnestly for books containing fairy tales, such as was told to them by their mother; and wild adventures, such as Walter could relate or invent by the hour.  It might have been observed that Roy carried on his shoulder a remarkable object--something like a clumsy basket made of reeds, and about twice the size of a man's head.  This had been made by Nelly the night before.  The use to which it was to be put was soon shown by Roy. Having reached the spot where the experiment was to be tried, and having observed that there were many ducks, large and small, floating about among the reeds, he got Nelly to hold the basket, if we may so call it, as high as she could raise it.  There was a hole in the bottom of it. Through this Roy thrust his head, so that the machine rested on his shoulders, his head being inside and completely concealed.  \"Now, Nelly, what think you of my helmet?\"  \"Oh! it is splendid!\" cried the girl, laughing in a subdued voice. \"It's so awfully absurd looking, but can you see? for I don't see a bit of your face.\"  \"See? ay, as well as need be.  There's lots of small holes which I can peep through in all directions.  But come, I'll try it.  Keep close, Nell, and don't laugh too loud, for ducks ain't used to laughing, d'ye see, and may be frightened by it.\"  So saying Roy crept on his hands and knees to the edge of the lake, being concealed by bushes, until he got into the water.  Here a few steps took him into the reeds which clustered so thickly at that spot, and grew so tall that he was soon hidden from sight altogether.  He had not taken off much of his dress, which, we may remark in passing, was of the simplest at all times--consisting of a pair of trousers, a striped cotton shirt, and a grey cloth capote with a hood to it.  His capote and cap were left in charge of his sister.  As for the shirt and trousers, they could be easily dried again.  Nelly watched the place where her brother had disappeared with breathless interest.  As he did not reappear as quickly as she had expected, she became greatly alarmed.  In a few minutes more she would certainly have rushed into the lake to the rescue, regardless of consequences and of ducks, had not Roy's strange head-dress come suddenly into view at the outward verge of the reeds.  The lad had waded in up to his neck, and was now slowly--almost imperceptibly--approaching a group of ducks that were disporting themselves gaily in the water.  \"They'll never let him near them,\" thought Nelly.  She was wrong, for at that moment an extremely fat and pert young duck observed the bundle of reeds, and swam straight up to it, animated, no doubt, by that reckless curiosity which is peculiar to young creatures. Had its mother known what was inside of the bundle, she would no doubt have remonstrated with her head-strong child, but, old and sagacious though that mother was, she was completely deceived.  She was not even astonished when her duckling suddenly disappeared beneath the water, thinking, no doubt, that it had dived.  Soon the bundle of reeds drew near to the mother, and she, too, disappeared suddenly below the water. Whatever her astonishment was at feeling her legs seized from below, she had not time to express it before her voice was choked.  Nelly observed these disappearances with intense amazement, and delight stamped every lineament of her little visage.  When the bundle moved towards the father of the duck-family, that gentleman became agitated and suspicious.  Probably males are less trusting than females, in all conditions of animal life.  At all events he sheered off.  The bundle waxed impatient and made a rush at him.  The drake, missing his wife and child, quacked the alarm.  The bundle made another rush, and suddenly disappeared with a tremendous splash, in the midst of which a leg and an arm appeared!  Away went the whole brood of ducks with immense splutter, and Nelly gave a wild scream of terror, supposing--and she was right--that her brother had fallen into a hole, and that he would be drowned.  In the latter supposition, however, she was mistaken, for Roy swam ashore in a few moments with a duck in each hand!  \"O Roy! ain't you cold?\" inquired Nelly, as she helped him to squeeze the water out of his garments.  \"Y-y-ye-es,\" said Roy, trembling in every limb, while his teeth rattled like small castanets, \"I'm very c-c-c-cold, but I'm in luck, for I've g-g-g-got to-night's s-s-s-supper, anyhow.\"  This was true, but as he could not hope to procure many more suppers in the same fashion at that season of the year, he and his sister went off without delay to try the fishing.  They had brought a fishing-line and a few hooks, among other small things, from the Indian camp.  This line was now got out, overhauled, and baited with a bit of the young duck's breast.  From the end of the point of rocks, which had been named the Wharf, the line was cast, for there the lake was deep.  \"Take the end of the line, Nell; I want you to catch the first fish.\"  \"How d'ye know we shall catch--oh! oh--ooh!\"  The fish in Silver Lake had never seen a bait or felt a hook in their lives before that day. They actually fought for the prize.  A big bully--as is usually the case in other spheres of life--gained it, and found he had \"caught a Tartar.\" He nearly pulled Nelly into the lake, but Roy sprang to the rescue, and before the child's shout of surprise had ceased to echo among the cliffs, a beautiful silvery fish, about a foot and a half long, lay tumbling on the strand.  \"Hurray!\" cried Roy.  \"Try again.\"  They did try again, and again, and over again, until they had caught two dozen and a half of those peculiar \"white-fish\" which swarm in most of the lakes of North America.  Then they stopped, being somewhat exhausted, and having more than enough for present use.  Before sitting down to supper that night, they preserved their fish in the simple but effective manner which is practised among the fur-traders in cold weather, and which they had learned while with the Indians. Each fish was split open and cleaned out, and then hung up by the tail to dry.  \"What a jolly time we shall have of it!\" said Roy, with his mouth full, as he sat beside Nelly and toasted his toes that night at supper.  \"Yes,\" said Nelly--\"if--if we were only a _little_ nearer home.\"  This reply made them both silent and sad for a time.  \"Never mind,\" resumed Roy, cheerily, as he began another white-fish-- having already finished one fish and the duckling--\"cheer up, Nell, we'll stay here long enough to get up a stock o' dried meat, and then set off again.  I only wish it would come frost, to make our fish keep.\"  Roy's wish was gratified sooner than he expected, and much more fully than he desired.    CHAPTER TEN.  CHANGES, SLIDING, FISHING, ETCETERA.  That night King Frost spread his wings over the land with unwonted suddenness and rigour, insomuch that a sheet of ice, full an inch thick, sealed up the waters of Silver Lake.  Roy and Nelly had feasted heartily, and had piled wood on the fire so high that the hut was comparatively warm, and they slept soundly till morning: but, about sunrise, the fire having died out, they both awoke shivering with cold.  Being _very_ sleepy, they tried for some time to drop off again in spite of the cold.  Failing in this, Roy at last jumped up with vigour and said he would light the fire, but he had scarcely issued from the hut, when a shout brought Nelly in alarm and haste to his side.  If Silver Lake was worthy of its name before, it was infinitely more worthy of it now.  The sun had just over-topped the opposite ridge, and was streaming over a very world of silver.  The frozen lake was like a sheet of the purest glass, which reflected the silvery clouds and white rolling mists of morning as perfectly in their form as the realities that floated in the blue sky.  Every tree, every twig, seemed made of silver, being encased in hoar-frost, and as these moved very gently in the calm air--for there was no breeze--millions of crystalline points caught the sun's rays and scattered them around with dazzling lustre. Nature seemed robed in cloth of diamonds; but the comparison is feeble, for what diamonds, cut by man, can equal those countless crystal gems that are fashioned by the hand of God to decorate, for an hour or two, the spotless robe of a winter morning?  Had Roy been a man and Nelly a woman, the two would probably have cast around a lingering glance of admiration, and then gone quietly about their avocations; but, being children, they made up their minds, on the spot, to enjoy the state of things"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21703"],["title","Silver Lake (#8)"],["body","the utmost.  They ran down to the lake and tried the ice.  Finding that it was strong enough to bear them, they advanced cautiously out upon its glassy surface; then they tried to slide, but did not succeed well, owing to their soft mocassins being ill adapted for sliding.  Then they picked up stones, and tried how far they could make them skim out on the lake.  \"How I wish we could slide!\" exclaimed Nelly, pausing in the midst of her amusement.  Roy also paused, and appeared to meditate for a minute.  \"So you shall,\" said he quickly.  \"Come and let us breakfast, and I'll make you a pair of sliders.\"  \"Sliders! what are they?\"  \"You shall see; get breakfast ready, a man's fit for nothing without grub.\"  While breakfast was preparing, Roy began to fashion wooden soles for his sister's feet and his own.  These he fixed on by means of strips of deerskin, which were sunk into grooves in the under part of the soles to prevent them from chafing.  Rough and ready they were, nevertheless they fitted well and tightly to their feet; but it was found that the want of a joint at the instep rendered it difficult to walk with these soles on, and impossible to run.  Roy's ingenuity, however, soon overcame this difficulty.  He cut the soles through just under the instep, and then, boring two holes in each part, lashed them firmly together with deerskin, thus producing a joint or hinge.  Eager to try this new invention, he fastened on his own \"sliders\" first, and, running down to the lake, made a rush at the ice and sent himself off with all his force.  Never was boy more taken by surprise; he went skimming over the surface like a stone from a sling.  The other side of the lake seemed to be the only termination of his journey.  \"What if it should not be bearing in the middle!\"  His delight was evinced by a cheer.  It was echoed, with the addition of a laugh by Nell, who stood in rapt admiration on the shore.  Roy began well, with his legs far apart and his arms in the air; then he turned round and advanced the wrong way, then he staggered--tried to recover himself; failed, shouted, cheered again, and fell flat on his back, and performed the remainder of the journey in that position!  It was a magnificent slide, and was repeated and continued, with every possible and conceivable modification, for full two hours, at the end of which time Nelly said she couldn't take another slide to save her life, and Roy felt as if every bone in his body were going out of joint.  \"This is all very well,\" said Roy, as they went up to the hut together, \"but it won't do much in the way of getting us a supply of meat or fish.\"  \"That's true,\" assented Nelly.  \"Well, then,\" continued Roy, \"we'll rest a bit, and then set to work. It's quite plain that we can have no more wading after ducks, but the fish won't object to feed in cold weather, so we'll try them again after having had a bit to eat.\"  In pursuance of this plan the two went to the wharf, after having refreshed themselves, and set to work with the fishing-line.  Nelly baited the hook, and Roy cut a hole in the ice with his axe.  Having put in the hook, and let it down to the bottom, they stood at the edge of the hole--expectant!  \"Frost seems to spoil their appetite,\" said Roy, in a tone of disappointment, after about five minutes had elapsed.  A fish seemed to have been listening, for before Nelly could reply, there came a violent tug at the line.  Roy returned a still more violent tug, and, instead of hauling it up hand over hand, ran swiftly along the ice, drawing the line after him, until the fish came out of the hole with a flop and a severe splutter.  It was above four pounds weight, and they afterwards found that the deeper the water into which the line was cast the larger were the fish procured.  White-fish were the kind they caught most of, but there were a species of trout, much resembling a salmon in colour and flavour, of which they caught a good many above ten and even fifteen pounds weight.  All these fish, except those reserved for immediate use, they cleaned and hung up in the manner already described.  Thus they occupied themselves for several days, and as the work was hard, they did not wander much from their hut, but ate their meals with appetite, and slept at nights soundly.  One night, just as they were about to lay down to rest, Roy went out to fetch an armful of firewood.  He returned with a look of satisfaction on his face.  \"Look here, Nell, what call ye that?\" pointing to a few specks of white on his breast and arms.  \"Snow!\" exclaimed Nelly.  \"Ay--snow! it's come at last, and I am glad of it, for we have far more than enough o' grub now, and it's time we were off from this.  You see, lass, we can't expect to find much game on a journey in winter, so we must carry all we can with us.  Our backs won't take so much as the sled, but the sled can't go loaded till there's snow on the ground, so the moment there is enough of it we'll set off.  Before starting, hows'ever, I must go off and try for a deer, for men can't walk well on fish alone; and when I'm away you can be getting the snow-shoes repaired, and the sled-lashings overhauled.  We will set about all that to-morrow.\"  \"But isn't to-morrow Sabbath?\" said Nelly.  \"So 'tis!  I forgot; well, we can put it off till Monday.\"  It may be well here to remark that Mrs Gore, being a sincere Christian, had a great reverence for the Sabbath-day, and had imbued her children with some of her own spirit in regard to it.  During the troubles and anxieties of the period when the children were lost in the snow and captured by the Indians, they had lost count of the days of the week.  Roy was not much troubled about this, but his sister's tender conscience caused her much uneasiness; and when they afterwards ran away from the Indians, and could do as they pleased, they agreed together to fix a Sabbath-day for themselves, beginning with the particular day on which it first occurred to them that they had not kept a Sabbath \"for a long, long time.\"  \"We can't find out the right day now, you know,\" observed Nelly, in an apologetic tone.  \"Of course not,\" said Roy; \"besides, it don't matter, because you remember how it is in the Ten Commandments: `Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work, but the _seventh_ day is the Sabbath.'  We will keep _to-day_, then; work _six_ days, and then keep the _seventh_ day.\"  We have elsewhere observed that Roy was a bit of a philosopher.  Having reasoned the matter out thus philosophically, the children held to their resolve; they travelled six days, and observed every seventh day as the Sabbath.  The particular Sabbath-day about which we are writing turned out to be a memorable one, as we shall see.  Roy and Nelly lay down that night, side by side, as was their wont, with their separate blankets wrapped around them, and their feet pointing towards the fire.  Of course they never undressed at night on this journey, but washed their underclothing as they found time and opportunity.  Soon they were sound asleep, and their gentle breathing was the only sound that broke the stillness of the night.  But snow was falling silently in thick heavy flakes, and it soon lay deep on the bosom of Silver Lake.  Towards morning the wind arose, and snow-drift began to whirl round the hut, and block up its low doorway.  Still the brother and sister slumbered peacefully, undisturbed by the gathering storm.    CHAPTER ELEVEN.  A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER--RABBITS AND BEARS APPEAR.  \"Hi!  Hallo!  I say, Nelly, what's all this?\"  There was good cause for the tone of surprise in which Roy uttered these words when he awoke, for the fireplace and the lower half of his own, as well as his sister's, blanket were covered with at least half a foot of snow.  It had found its way in at the hole in the roof of the hut, and the wind had blown a great deal through the crevices of the doorway, so that a snow-wreath more than a foot high lay close to Nelly's elbow.  This was bad enough, but what made it worse was that a perfect hurricane was blowing outside.  Fortunately the hut was sheltered by the woods, and by a high cliff on the windward side; but this cliff, although it broke the force of the gale, occasioned an eddy which sent fearful gusts and thick clouds of snow ever and anon full against the doorway.  \"O Roy! what shall we do?\" said Nelly, in an anxious tone.  \"Don't know,\" said Roy, jumping up and tightening his belt; \"you never can know what's got to be done till you've took an observation o' what's goin' on, as daddy used to say.  Hallo! hold on.  I say, if it goes on like this it'll blow the hut down.  Come, Nelly, don't whimper; it's only a puff, after all, an' if it did capsize us, it wouldn't be the first time we had a tumble in the snow.  Seems to me that we're goin' to have a stormy Sabbath, though.  Rouse up, lass, and while you're clearin' off the snow, I'll go get a bundle o' sticks, and light the fire.\"  Roy stooped to pass under the low doorway, or, rather, hole of the hut, and bending his head to the blast passed out; while Nelly, whose heart was cheered by her brother's confident tone more than by his words, set about shovelling away the snow-drift with great activity.  Presently Roy returned, staggering under a heavy load of firewood.  \"Ho!  Nell,\" he cried, flinging down the wood with a clatter, \"just you come an' see Silver Lake.  Such a sight it is you never saw; but come slick off--never mind your belt; just roll your blanket round you, over head and ears--there,\" said he, assisting to fasten the rough garment, and seizing his sister's hand, \"hold on tight by me.\"  \"Oh, _what_ a storm!\" gasped the little girl, as she staggered out and came within the full force of the gale.  It was indeed a storm, such as would have appalled the hearts of youngsters less accustomed to the woods than were our hero and heroine. But Roy and Nelly had been born and bred in the midst of stormy backwoods' elements, and were"]]]
