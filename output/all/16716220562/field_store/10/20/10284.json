A viking was merely a piratical rover on the sea, the sea-warrior of the period, but a Sea-king was a leader and commander of vikings. Every Sea-king was a viking, but every viking was not a Sea-king; just as every Admiral is a sailor, but every sailor is not an Admiral.  When it is said that Erling was a Sea-king, it is much as if we had said he was an admiral in a small way.    CHAPTER TWO.  INTRODUCES, AMONG OTHERS, THE HERO AND HEROINE, AND OPENS UP A VIEW OF NORSE LIFE IN THE OLDEN TIME.  Ulf of Romsdal had a daughter named Hilda.  She was fair, and extremely pretty.  The young men said that her brow was the habitation of the lily, her eye the mirror of the heavens, her cheek the dwelling-place of the rose. True, in the ardour of their feelings and strength of their imaginations they used strong language; nevertheless it was impossible to overpraise the Norse maiden.  Her nut-brown hair fell in luxuriant masses over her shapely shoulders, reaching far below the waist; her skin was fair, and her manners engaging.  Hilda was undoubtedly blue-eyed and beautiful. She was just seventeen at this time.  Those who loved her (and there were few who did not) styled her the sunbeam.  Erling and Hilda had dwelt near each other from infancy.  They had been playmates, and for many years were as brother and sister to each other. Erling's affection had gradually grown into a stronger passion, but he never mentioned the fact to anyone, being exceedingly shamefaced and shy in regard to love.  He would have given his ears to have known that his love was returned, but he dared not to ask.  He was very stupid on this point.  In regard to other things he was sharp-witted above his fellows. None knew better than he how to guide the \"warship\" through the intricate mazes of the island-studded coast of Norway; none equalled him in deeds of arms; no one excelled him in speed of foot, in scaling the fells, or in tracking the wolf and bear to their dens; but all beat him in love-making!  He was wondrously slow and obtuse at that, and could by no means discover whether or not Hilda regarded him as a lover or a brother.  As uncertainty on this point continued, Erling became jealous of all the young men who approached her, and in proportion as this feeling increased his natural disposition changed, and his chafing spirit struggled fiercely within him.  But his native good sense and modesty enabled him pretty well to conceal his feelings.  As for Hilda, no one knew the state of her mind.  It is probable that at this time she herself had not a very distinct idea on the point.  Hilda had a foster-sister named Ada, who was also very beautiful.  She was unusually dark for a Norse maiden.  Her akin indeed was fair, but her hair and eyes were black like the raven's wing.  Her father was King Hakon of Drontheim.  It was the custom in those warlike days for parents to send out some of their children to be fostered by others--in order, no doubt, to render next to impossible the total extirpation of their families at a time when sudden descents upon households were common.  By thus scattering their children the chances of family annihilation were lessened, and the probability that some members might be left alive to take revenge was greatly increased.  Hilda and Ada were warmly attached.  Having been brought up together, they loved each other as sisters--all the more, perhaps, that in character they were somewhat opposed.  Hilda was grave, thoughtful, almost pensive.  Ada was full of vivacity and mirth, fond of fun, and by no means averse to a little of what she styled harmless mischief.  Now there was a man in Horlingdal called Glumm, surnamed the Gruff, who loved Ada fervently.  He was a stout, handsome man, of ruddy complexion, and second only to Erling in personal strength and prowess.  But by nature he was morose and gloomy.  Nothing worse, however, could be said of him.  In other respects he was esteemed a brave, excellent man. Glumm was too proud to show his love to Ada very plainly; but she had wit enough to discover it, though no one else did, and she resolved to punish him for his pride by keeping him in suspense.  Horlingdal, where Ulf and Haldor and their families dwelt was, like nearly all the vales on the west of Norway, hemmed in by steep mountains of great height, which were covered with dark pines and birch trees.  To the level pastures high up on mountain tops the inhabitants were wont to send their cattle to feed in summer--the small crops of hay in the valleys being carefully gathered and housed for winter use.  Every morning, before the birds began to twitter, Hilda set out, with her pail and her wooden box, to climb the mountain to the upland dairy or \"saeter\", and fetch the milk and butter required by the family during the day.  Although the maid was of noble birth--Ulf claiming descent from one of those who are said to have come over with Odin and his twelve godars or priests from Asia--this was not deemed an inappropriate occupation.  Among the Norsemen labour was the lot of high and low.  He was esteemed the best man who could fight most valiantly in battle and labour most actively in the field or with the tools of the smith and carpenter.  Ulf of Romsdal, although styled king in virtue of his descent, was not too proud, in the busy summertime, to throw off his coat and toss the hay in his own fields in the midst of his thralls [slaves taken in war] and house-carles.  Neither he, nor Haldor, nor any of the small kings, although they were the chief men of the districts in which they resided, thought it beneath their dignity to forge their own spearheads and anchors, or to mend their own doors.  As it was with the men, so was it with the women.  Hilda the Sunbeam was not despised because she climbed the mountainside to fetch milk and butter for the family.  One morning, in returning from the fell, Hilda heard the loud clatter of the anvil at Haldorstede.  Having learned that morning that Danish vikings had been seen prowling among the islands near the fiord, she turned aside to enquire the news.  Haldorstede lay about a mile up the valley, and Hilda passed it every morning on her way to and from the saeter.  Ulfstede lay near the shore of the fiord.  Turning into the smithy, she found Erling busily engaged in hammering a huge mass of stubborn red-hot metal.  So intent was the young man on his occupation that he failed to observe the entrance of his fair visitor, who set down her milk pail, and stood for a few minutes with her hands folded and her eyes fixed demurely on her lover.  Erling had thrown off his jerkin and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt of coarse homespun fabric, in order to give his thick muscular arms unimpeded play in wielding the hammer and turning the mass of glowing metal on the anvil.  He wore woollen breeches and hose, both of which had been fashioned by the fingers of his buxom mother, Herfrida.  A pair of neatly formed shoes of untanned hide--his own workmanship--protected his feet, and his waist was encircled by a broad leathern girdle, from one side of which depended a short hunting-knife, and from the other a flap, with a slit in it, to support his sword.  The latter weapon--a heavy double-edged blade--stood leaning against the forge chimney, along with a huge battle-axe, within reach of his hand.  The collar of his shirt was thrown well back, exposing to view a neck and chest whose muscles denoted extraordinary power, and the whiteness of which contrasted strikingly with the ruddy hue of his deeply bronzed countenance.  The young giant appeared to take pleasure in the exercise of his superabundant strength, for, instead of using the ordinary single-hand hammer with which other men were wont to bend the glowing metal to their will, he wielded the great forehammer, and did it as easily, too, with his right arm as if it had been but a wooden mallet.  The mass of metal at which he wrought was thick and unyielding, but under his heavy blows it began to assume the form of an axe--a fact which Hilda noticed with a somewhat saddened brow.  Erling's long hair, rolling as it did down his shoulders, frequently straggled over his face and interfered slightly with his vision, whereupon he shook it back with an impatient toss, as a lion might shake his mane, while he toiled with violent energy at his work.  To look at him, one might suppose that Vulcan himself had condescended to visit the abodes of men, and work in a terrestrial smithy!  During one of the tosses with which he threw back his hair, Erling chanced to raise his eyes, which instantly fell upon Hilda.  A glad smile beamed on his flushed face, and he let the hammer fall with a ringing clatter on the anvil, exclaiming:  \"Ha! good morrow to thee, Hilda!  Thou comest with stealthy tread, like the midnight marauder.  What news?  Does all go well at Ulfstede?  But why so sad, Hilda?  Thy countenance is not wont to quarrel with the mountain air.\"  \"Truly, no!\" replied the girl, smiling, \"mountain air likes me well.  If my looks are sadder than usual, it is because of the form of the weapon thou art fashioning.\"  \"The weapon!\" exclaimed Erling, as he raised the handle of the hammer, and, resting his arms on it, gazed at his visitor in some surprise.  \"It is but an axe--a simple axe, perchance a trifle heavier than other axes because it suits my arm better, and I have a weakness that way.  What ails thee at a battle-axe, Hilda?\"  \"I quarrel not with the axe, Erling, but it reminds me of thy love of fighting, and I grieve for that.  Why art thou so fond of war?\"  \"Fond of war!\" echoed the youth.  \"Now, out upon thee, Hilda! what were a man fit for if he could not fight?\"  \"Nay, I question not thine ability to fight, but I grieve to see thy love for fighting.\"  \"Truly there seems to me a close relationship between the love of war and the ability to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21730"],["title","Erling the Bold (#2)"],["body","fight,\" returned the youth.  \"But to be plain with thee: I _do not_ love war so much as ye think.  Yet I utter this in thine ear, for I would not that the blades of the valley knew it, lest they might presume upon it, and I should have to prove my ability-- despite my want of love--upon some of their carcasses.\"  \"I wish there were no such thing as war,\" said Hilda with a sigh.  Erling knitted his brows and gazed into the smithy fire as if he were engaged in pondering some knotty point.  \"Well, I'm not sure,\" said he slowly, and descending to a graver tone of address--\"I'm not sure that I can go quite so far as that.  If we had no war at all, perchance our swords might rust, and our skill, for want of practice, might fail us in the hour of need.  Besides, how could men in that case hope to dwell with Odin in Valhalla's bright and merry halls?  But I agree with thee in wishing that we had less of war and more of peace _at home_.\"  \"I fear,\" said Hilda, \"we seem likely to have more of war and less of peace than usual, if rumours be true.  Have you heard that Danish vikings have been seen among the islands?\"  \"Aye, truly, I have heard of them, and it is that which has sent me to the smithy this morning to hasten forward my battle-axe; for I love not too light a weapon.  You see, Hilda, when it has not weight one must sometimes repeat the blow; especially if the mail be strong.  But with a heavy axe and a stout arm there is no need for that.  I had begun this weapon,\" continued the youth, as if he were musing aloud rather than speaking to his companion, \"with intent to try its metal on the head of the King; but I fear me it will be necessary to use it in cracking a viking's headpiece before it cleaves a royal crown.\"  \"The King!\" exclaimed Hilda, with a look of surprise, not unmingled with terror, \"Erling, has ambition led thee to this?\"  \"Not so; but self-preservation urges me to it.\"  The maiden paused a few seconds, ere she replied in a meditative voice--\"The old man who came among us a year ago, and who calls himself Christian, tells me that his god is not a god of war, like Odin; he says that his god permits no war to men, save that of self-defence; but, Erling, would slaying the King be indeed an act of self-preservation?\"  \"Aye, in good sooth would it,\" replied the youth quickly, while a dark frown crossed his brow.  \"How can that be?\" asked the maiden.  \"Hast such small love for gossip, Hilda, that the foul deeds and ambitious projects of Harald Haarfager have not reached thine ear?\"  \"I have heard,\" replied Hilda, \"that he is fond of war, which, truly, is no news, and that he is just now more busy with his bloody game than usual; but what does that matter to thee?\"  \"Matter!\" cried the youth impatiently, as he seized the lump of metal on which he had been at work, and, thrusting it into the smouldering charcoal, commenced to blow the fire energetically, as if to relieve his feelings.  \"Know ye not that the King--this Harald Fairhair--is not satisfied with the goodly domains that of right belong to him, and the kingly rule which he holds, according to law, over all Norway, but that he means to subdue the whole land to himself, and trample on our necks as he has already trampled on our laws?\"  \"I know somewhat of this,\" said Hilda.  \"No one,\" pursued Erling vehemently, and blowing the fire into a fervent heat--\"no one denies to Harald the right to wear the crown of Norway. That was settled at the Ore Thing [see note 1] in Drontheim long ago; but everyone denies his right to interfere with our established laws and privileges.  Has he not, by mere might and force of arms, slain many, and enslaved others, of our best and bravest men?  And now he proposes to reduce the whole land to slavery, or something like it, and all because of the foolish speech of a proud girl, who says she will not wed him until he shall first subdue to himself the whole of Norway, and rule over it as fully and freely as King Eric rules over Sweden, or King Gorm over Denmark.  He has sworn that he will neither clip nor comb his hair, until he has subdued all the land with scatt [taxes] and duties and domains, or die in the attempt.  Trust me! he is like to die in the attempt; and since his Kingship is to be so little occupied with his hair, it would please me well if he would use his time and his shears in clipping the tongue of the wench that set him on so foul an errand.  All this thou knowest, Hilda, as well as I; but thou dost not know that men have been at the stede to-day, who tell us that the King is advancing north, and is victorious everywhere.  Already King Gandalf and Hako are slain; the two sons of King Eystein have also fallen, and many of the upland kings have been burned, with most of their men, in a house at Ringsager.  It is not many days since Harald went up Gudbrandsdal, and north over the Doverfielde, where he ordered all the men to be slain, and everything wide around to be given to the flames.  King Gryting of Orkadal and all his people have sworn fidelity to him, and now--worst news of all--it is said he is coming over to pay us a visit in Horlingdal.  Is not here cause for fighting in self-defence, or rather for country, and laws and freedom, and wives, and children, and--\"  The excited youth stopped abruptly, and, seizing the tongs, whirled the white mass of semi-molten steel upon the anvil, and fell to belabouring it with such goodwill that a bright shower of sparks drove Hilda precipitately out of the workshop.  The wrongs which roused the young Norseman's indignation to such a pitch are matters of history.  The government of the country at that time involved the democratic element very largely.  No act or expedition of any importance could be done or undertaken without the previous deliberation and consent of a \"Thing\", or assembly of landed proprietors.  There were many different Things--such as General Things, District Things, House Things of the King's counsellors, and Herd Things of the Court, etcetera, and to such of these there was a distinct and well-known trumpet call.  There were also four great Things which were legislative, while the small district Things were only administrative.  In addition to which there was the Ore Thing of Drontheim, referred to by Erling.  At these Things the King himself possessed no greater power than any of the bonders.  He was only a \"Thing-man\" at a Thing.  No wonder, then, that the self-governing and warlike Norsemen could not bring themselves tamely to submit to the tyranny of Harald Haarfager, or Fairhair, King of Norway by hereditary right, when he cast aside all the restraints of ancient custom, and, in his effort to obtain more power, commenced those bloody wars with his subjects, which had the effect of causing many of his chief men to expatriate themselves and seek new homes in the islands of the great western sea, and which ultimately resulted in the subjugation (at least during that reign) of all the petty kings of Norway.  These small kings, be it observed, were not at that time exercising any illegal power, or in the occupation of any unwarrantable position, which could be pleaded by King Harald in justification of his violent proceedings against them.  The title of king did not imply independent sovereignty.  They were merely the hereditary lords of the soil, who exercised independent and rightful authority over their own estates and households, and modified authority over their respective districts, subject, however, to the laws of the land--laws which were recognised and perfectly understood by the people and the king, and which were admitted by people and king alike to have more authority than the royal will itself.  By law the small kings were bound to attend the meetings of the Stor Things or Parliaments, at the summons of the sovereign, and to abide by the decisions of those assemblies, where all men met on an equal footing, but where, of course, intellectual power and eloquence led the multitude, for good or for evil, then just as they do now, and will continue to do as long as, and wherever, free discussion shall obtain.  To say that the possession of power, wealth, or influence was frequently abused to the overawing and coercing of those assemblies, is simply to state that they were composed of human beings possessed of fallen natures.  So thoroughly did the Northmen appreciate the importance of having a right to raise their voices and to vote in the national parliaments, and so jealously did they assert and maintain their privileges, that the King himself--before he could, on his accession, assume the crown--was obliged to appear at the \"Thing\", where a freeborn landholder proposed him, and where his title to the crown was investigated and proved in due form.  No war expedition on a large scale could be undertaken until a Thing had been converged, and requisition legally made by the King for a supply of men and arms; and, generally, whenever any act affecting national or even district interests was contemplated, it was necessary to assemble a Thing, and consult with the people before anything could be done.  It may be easily understood, then, with what an outburst of indignation a free and warlike race beheld the violent course pursued by Harald Fairhair, who roamed through the country with fire and sword, trampling on their cherished laws and privileges, subduing the petty kings, and placing them, when submissive, as Jarls, i.e. earls or governors over the districts to collect the scatt or taxes, and manage affairs in his name and for his behoof.  It is no wonder that Erling the Bold gathered his brow into an ominous frown, pressed his lips together, tossed his locks impatiently while he thought on these things and battered the iron mass on his anvil with the amount of energy that he would have expended in belabouring the head of King Harald himself, had opportunity offered.  Erling's wrath cooled, however, almost instantly on his observing"]]]
