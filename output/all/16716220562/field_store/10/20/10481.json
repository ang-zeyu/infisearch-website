It was a young maple, two inches through, lately set out, but it might have stopped a pair of very small horses.  Those in the road were large--almost too large to run well.  They were well-matched grays, and they came thundering along in a way that was really fine to behold; heads down, necks arched, nostrils wide, reins flying, the wagon behind them banging and swerving--no wonder everybody stood still and, except Mary Ogden, shouted, \"Stop 'em!\"  One young fellow, across the street, stood still only until the runaways were all but close by him.  Then he darted out into the street, not ahead of them but behind them.  No man on earth could have stopped those horses by standing in front of them. They could have charged through a regiment.  Their heavy, furious gallop was fast, too, and the boy who was now following them, must have been as light of foot as a young deer.  \"Hurrah!  Hurrah!  Go it, Jack!  Catch 'em!  Bully for you!\" arose from a score of people along the sidewalk, as he bounded forward.  \"It's Jack!  Oh dear me!  But it's just like him!  There!  He's in!\" exclaimed Mary Ogden, her dark eyes dancing proudly.  \"Why, it's that good-for-nothing brother of Mary Ogden.  He's the blacksmith's boy.  I'm afraid he will be hurt,\" remarked Miss Glidden, kindly and benevolently; but all the rest shouted \"Hurrah!\" again.  Fierce was the strain upon the young runner, for a moment, and then his hands were on the back-board of the bouncing wagon.  A tug, a spring, a swerve of the wagon, and Jack Ogden was in it, and in a second more the loosely flying reins were in his hands.  The strong arms of his father, were they twice as strong, could not at once have pulled in those horses, and one man on the sidewalk seemed to be entirely correct when he said, \"He's a plucky little fellow, but he can't do a thing, now he's there.\"  [Illustration: _The Runaway_.]  His sister was trembling all over, but she was repeating: \"He did it splendidly!  He can do anything!\"  Jack, in the wagon, was thinking only: \"I know 'em.  They're old Hammond's team.  They'll try to go home to the mill.  They'll smash everything, if I don't look out!\"  It is something, even to a greatly frightened horse, to feel a hand on the rein.  The team intended to turn out of Main Street, at the corner, and they made the turn, but they did not crash the wagon to pieces against the corner post, because of the desperate guiding that was done by Jack.  The wagon swung around without upsetting.  It tilted fearfully, and the nigh wheel was in the air for a moment, until Jack's weight helped bring it down again.  There was a short, sharp scream across the street, when the wagon swung and the wheel went up.  Down the slope toward the bridge thundered the galloping team, and the blacksmith ran out of his shop to see it pass.  \"Turn them into the creek, Jack!\" he shouted, but there was no time for any answer.  \"They'd smash through the bridge,\" thought Jack.  \"I know what I'm about.\"  There were wheel-marks down from the street, at the left of the bridge, where many a team had descended to drink the water of the Cocahutchie, but it required all Jack's strength on one rein to make his runaways take that direction.  They had thought of going toward the mill, but they knew the watering-place.  Not many rods below the bridge stood a clump of half a dozen gigantic trees, remnants of the old forest which had been replaced by the streets of Crofield and the farms around it.  Jack's pull on the left rein was obeyed only too well, and it looked, for some seconds, as if the plunging beasts were about to wind up their maddened dash by a wreck among those gnarled trunks and projecting roots.  Jack drew his breath hard, and there was almost a chill at his young heart, but he held hard and said nothing.  Forward--one plunge more--hard on the right rein--  \"That was close!\" he said.  \"If we didn't go right between the big maple and the cherry!  Now I've got 'em!\"  Splash, crash, rattle!  Spattering and plunging, but cooling fast, the gray team galloped along the shallow bed of the Cocahutchie.  \"I wish the old swimming-hole was deeper,\" said Jack, \"but the water's very low.  Whoa, boys!  Whoa, there!  Almost up to the hub--over the hub!  Whoa, now!\"  And the gray team ceased its plunging and stood still in water three feet deep.  \"I mustn't let 'em drink too much,\" said Jack; \"but a little won't hurt 'em.\"  The horses were trembling all over, but one after the other they put their noses into the water, and then raised their heads to prick their ears back and forth and look round.  \"Don't bring 'em ashore till they're quiet, Jack,\" called out the deep, ringing voice of his father from the bank.  There he stood, and other men were coming on the run.  The tall blacksmith's black eyes were flashing with pride over the daring feat his son had performed.  \"I daren't tell him, though,\" he said to himself.  \"He's set up enough a'ready.  He thinks he can do 'most anything.\"  \"Jack,\" wheezed a mealy voice at his side, \"that's my team--\"  \"I know it,\" said Jack.  \"They 're all right now.  Pretty close shave through the trees, that was!\"  \"I owe ye fifty dollars for a-savin' them and the wagin,\" said the miller.  \"It's wuth it, and I'll pay it; but I've got to owe it to ye, jest now.  Times are awful hard in Crofield.  If I'd ha' lost them hosses and that wagin--\"  He stopped short, as if he could not exactly say how disastrous it would have been for him.  There was a running fire of praise and of questions poured at Jack, by the gathering knot of people on the shore, and it was several minutes before his father spoke again.  \"They're cool now,\" he said.  \"Turn 'em, Jack, and walk 'em out by the bridge, and up to the mill.  Then come home to dinner.\"  Jack pretended not to see quite a different kind of group gathered under the clump of tall trees.  Not a voice had come to him from that group of lookers-on, and yet the fact that they were there made him tingle all over.  Two large, freckle-faced, sandy-haired women were hugging each other, and wiping their eyes; and a very small girl was tugging at their dresses and crying, while a pair of girls of from twelve to fourteen, close by them, seemed very much inclined to dance.  Two small boys, who at first belonged to the party, had quickly rolled up their trousers and waded out as far as they could into the Cocahutchie.  Just in front of the group, under the trees, stood Mary Ogden, straight as an arrow, her dark eyes flashing and her cheeks glowing while she looked silently at the boy on the wagon in the stream, until she saw him wheel the grays.  Even then she did not say anything, but turned and walked away. It was as if she had so much to say that she felt she could not say it.  \"Aunt Melinda!  Mother!\" said one of the girls, \"Jack isn't hurt a mite.  They'd all ha' been drowned, though, if there was water enough.\"  \"Hush, Bessie,\" said one of the large women, and the other at once echoed, \"Hush, Bessie.\"  They were very nearly alike, these women, and they both had long straight noses, such as Jack's would have been, if half-way down it had not been Roman, like his father's.  \"Mary Ann,\" said the first woman, \"we mustn't say too much to him about it.  He can only just be held in, now.\"  \"Hush, Melinda,\" said Jack's mother.  \"I thought I'd seen the last of him when the gray critters came a-powderin' down the road past the house\"--and then she wiped her eyes again, and so did Aunt Melinda, and they both stooped down at the same moment, saying, \"Jack's safe, Sally,\" and picked up the small girl, who was crying, and kissed her.  The gray team was surrendered to its owner as soon as it reached the road at the foot of the bridge, and again Jack was loudly praised by the miller.  The rest of the Ogden family seemed to be disposed to keep away, but the tall blacksmith himself was there.  \"Jack,\" said he, as they turned away homeward, \"you can go fishing this afternoon, just as I said.  I was thinking of your doing something else afterward, but you've done about enough for one day.\"  He had more to say, concerning what would have happened to the miller's horses, and the number of pieces the wagon would have been knocked into, but for the manner in which the whole team had been saved.  When they reached the house the front door was open, but nobody was to be seen.  Bob and Jim, the two small boys, had not yet returned from seeing the gray span taken to the mill, and the women and girls had gone through to the kitchen.  \"Jack,\" said his father, as they went in, \"old Hammond'll owe you that fifty dollars long enough.  He never really pays anything.\"  \"Course he doesn't--not if he can help it,\" said Jack.  \"I worked for him three months, and you know we had to take it out in feed.  I learned the mill trade, though, and that was something.\"  Just then he was suddenly embarrassed.  Mrs. Ogden had gone through the house and out at the back door, and Aunt Melinda had followed her, and so had the girls.  Molly had suddenly gone up-stairs to her own room. Aunt Melinda had taken everything off the kitchen stove and put everything back again, and here now was Mrs. Ogden back again, hugging her son.  \"Jack,\" she said, \"don't you ever, ever, do such a thing again.  You might ha' been knocked into slivers!\"  Molly had gone up the back stairs only to come down the front way, and she was now a little behind them.  \"Mother!\" she exclaimed, as if her pent-up admiration for her brother was exploding, \"you ought to have seen him jump in, and you ought to have seen that wagon go around the corner!\"  \"Jack,\" broke in the half-choked voice of Aunt Melinda from the kitchen doorway, \"come and eat something.  I felt as if I knew you were killed, sure.  If you haven't earned your dinner, nobody has.\"  \"Why, I know how to drive,\" said Jack.  \"I wasn't afraid of 'em after I got hold of the reins.\"  He seemed even in a hurry to get through his dinner, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21846"],["title","Crowded Out o' Crofield; or, The Boy who made his Way (#2)"],["body","minutes later he was out in the garden, digging for bait.  The rest of the family remained at the table longer than usual, especially Bob and Jim; but, for some reason known to herself, Mary did not say a word about her meeting with Miss Glidden.  Perhaps the miller's gray team had run away with all her interest in that, but she did not even tell how carefully Miss Glidden had inquired after the family.  \"There goes Jack,\" she said at last, and they all turned to look.  He did not say anything as he passed the kitchen door, but he had his long cane fishing-pole over his shoulder.  It had a line wound around it, ready for use.  He went out of the gate and down the road toward the bridge, and gave only a glance across at the shop.  \"I didn't get many worms,\" he said to himself, at the bridge, \"but I can dig some more if the fish bite.  Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't.\"  Over the bridge he went, and up a wagon track on the opposite bank, but he paused for one moment, in the very middle of the bridge, to look up stream.  \"There's just enough water to run the mill,\" he said.  \"There isn't any coming over the dam.  The pond's even full, though, and it may be a good day for fish.  I wish I was in the city!\"     CHAPTER II.  THE FISH WERE THERE.  Saturday afternoon was before Jack Ogden, when he came out at the water's edge, near the dam, across from the mill.  That was there, big and red and rusty-looking; and the dam was there; and above them was the mill-pond, spreading out over a number of acres, and ornamented with stumps, old logs, pond-lilies, and weeds.  It was a fairly good pond, the best that Cocahutchie Creek could do for Crofield, but Jack's face fell a little as he looked at it.  \"There are more fellows than fish here,\" he said to himself, with an air of disgust.  There was a boy at the end of the dam near him, and a boy in the middle of it, and two boys at the flume, near the mill.  There were three punts out on the water, and one of them had in it a man and two boys, while the second boat held but one man, and the third contained four. A big stump near the north shore supported a boy, and the old snag jutting out from the south shore held a boy and a man.  There they all were, sitting perfectly still, until, one after another, each rod and line came up to have its hook and bait examined, to see whether or not there had really been a bite.  \"I'm fairly crowded out,\" remarked Jack.  \"Those fellows have all the good places.  I'll have to go somewhere else; where'll I go?\"  He studied that problem for a full minute, while every fisherman there turned to look at him, and then turned back to watch his line.  \"I guess I'll try down stream,\" said Jack.  \"Nobody ever caught anything down there, and nobody ever goes there, but I s'pose I might as well try it, just for once.\"  He turned away along the track over which he had come.  He did not pause at the road and bridge, but went on down the further bank of the Cocahutchie.  It was a pretty stream of water, and it spread out wide and shallow, and rippled merrily among stones and bowlders and clumps of willow and alder for nearly half a mile.  Gradually, then, it grew narrower, quieter, deeper, and wore a sleepy look which made it seem more in keeping with quiet old Crofield.  \"The hay's about ready to cut,\" said Jack, as he plodded along the path, near the water's edge, through a thriving meadow of clover and timothy.  \"There's always plenty of work in haying time.  Hullo!  What grasshoppers!  Jingo!\"  As he made the last exclamation, he clapped his hand upon his trousers pocket.  \"If I didn't forget to go in and get my sinker!  Never did such a thing before in all my life.  What's the use of trying to fish without a sinker?\"  The luck seemed to be going directly against him.  Even the Cocahutchie, at his left, had dwindled to a mere crack between bushes and high grass, as if to show that it had no room to let for fish to live in--that is, for fish accustomed to having plenty of room, such as they could find when living in a mill-pond, lined around the edges with boys and fish-poles.  \"That's a whopper!\" suddenly exclaimed Jack, with a quick snatch at something that alighted upon his left arm.  \"I've caught him! Grasshoppers are the best kind of bait, too.  I'll try him on, sinker or no sinker.  Hope there are some fish, down here.\"  The line he unwound from his rod was somewhat coarse, but it was strong, and so was his hook, as if the fishing around Crofield called for stout tackle as well as for a large number of sportsmen.  The big, long-limbed, green-coated jumper was placed in position on the hook, and then, with several more grumbling regrets over the absence of any sinker, Jack searched along the bank for a place whence he could throw his bait into the water.  \"This'll do,\" he said, at last, and the breeze helped him to swing out his line until the grasshopper at the end of it dropped lightly and naturally into a dark little eddy, almost across that narrow ribbon of the Cocahutchie.  Splash--tug--splash again--  \"Jingo!  What's that?  I declare--if he isn't pulling!  He'll break the line--no, he won't.  See that pole bend!  Steady--here he comes. Hurrah!\"  Out he came, indeed, for the rude, strong tackle held, even against the game struggling of that vigorous trout.  There he lay now, on the grass, with Jack Ogden bending over him in a fever of exultation and amazement.  \"I never could have caught him with a worm and a sinker,\" he said, aloud.  \"This is the way to catch 'em.  Isn't he a big fellow!  I'll try some more grasshoppers.\"  There was not likely to be another two-pound brook-trout very near the hole out of which that one had been pulled.  There would not have been any at all, perhaps, but for the prevailing superstition that there were no fish there.  Everybody knew that there were bullheads, suckers, perch, and \"pumpkin-seeds\" in the mill-pond, and eels, with now and then a pickerel, but the trout were a profound secret.  It was easy to catch another big grasshopper, but the young sportsman knew very well that he knew nothing at all of that kind of fishing.  He had made his first cast perfectly, because it was about the only way in which it could have been made, and now he was so very nervous and excited and cautious that he did very well again, aided as before by the breeze. Not in the same place, but at a little distance down, and close to where Jack captured his second bait, there was a crook in the Cocahutchie, with a steep, overhanging, bushy bank.  Into the glassy shadow under that bank the sinkerless line carried and dropped its little green prisoner, and there was a hungry fellow in there, waiting for foolish grasshoppers in the meadow to spring too far and come down upon the water instead of upon the grass.  As the grasshopper alighted on the water, there was a rush, a plunge, a strong hard pull, and then Jack Ogden said to himself:  \"I've heard how they do it.  They wait and tire 'em out.  I won't be in too much of a hurry.  He'll get away if I am.\"  That is probably what the fish would have done, for he was a fish with what army men call \"tactics.\"  He was able to pull very hard, and he was also wise enough to rush in under the bank and to sulkily stay there.  \"Feels as if I'd hooked a snag,\" said Jack.  \"May be I've lost the fish and he's hitched me into a 'cod-lamper' eel of some kind.  Steady--no, I mustn't pull harder than the fish.\"  He was breathless, but not with any exertion that he was making.  His hat fell off upon the grass, as he leaned forward through the alder bushes, and his sandy hair was tangled for a moment in some stubby twigs.  He loosened his head, still holding firmly his bent and straining rod.  One step farther, a slip of his left foot, an unsuccessful grasp at a bush, and then Jack went over and down into a pool deeper than he had thought the Cocahutchie afforded so near Crofield.  There was a very fine splash, as the grasshopper fly-fisherman went under, and there was a coughing and spluttering a moment afterward, when his eager, excited, anxious face came up again.  He could swim extremely well, and he was not thinking of his ducking--only of his game.  \"I hope I haven't lost him!\" he exclaimed, as he tried to pull upon the line.  It did not tug at all, just then, for the fish on the hook had been rudely startled out from under the bank and was on his way up the Cocahutchie, with the hook in his mouth.  \"There' he is!  I've got him yet!  Glad I can swim--\" cried Jack; and it did seem as if he and this fish were very well matched, except that Jack had to give one of his hands to the rod while his captive could use every fin.  Down stream floated Jack, passing the rod back through his hands until he could grasp the line, and all the while the fish was darting madly about to get away.  \"There, I've touched bottom.  Now for him!  Here he comes.  I'll draw him ashore easy--that's it!  Hurrah! biggest fish ever was caught in the Cocahutchie!\"  That might or might not be so, but Jack Ogden had a three-pound trout, flopping angrily upon the grass at his feet.  \"I know how to do it now,\" he almost shouted.  \"I can catch 'em!  I won't let anybody else know how it's done, either.\"  He had learned something, no doubt, but he had not learned how to make a large fish out of a small one.  All the rest of that afternoon he caught grasshoppers and cast them daintily into what seemed to be good places, but he did not have another occasion to tumble in.  When at last he was tired out and decided to go home, he had a dozen more of trout, not one of them weighing over six ounces, with a pair of very good yellow perch, one very large perch, a sucker, and three bullheads, that bit when his bait happened to sink to the bottom without any lead to help it.  Take it all in all, it was a great string of fish to be caught on a Saturday afternoon, when all that the Crofield sportsmen around the mill-pond could show was"]]]
