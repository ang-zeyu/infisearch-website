Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave; And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Oh! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand   Between their loved homes and the war's desolation, Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land   Praise the power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto--\"In God is our trust\"-- And the Star Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Thy mandates make heroes assemble,   When Liberty's form stands in view; Thy banners make tyranny tremble   When borne by the Red, White, and Blue.  CHORUS.  When borne by the Red, White, and Blue, When borne by the Red, White, and Blue, Thy banners make tyranny tremble, When borne by the Red, White, and Blue.  When war waged its wide desolation,   And threatened the land to deform, The ark then of Freedom's foundation,   Columbia, rode safe through the storm, With her garlands of vict'ry around her,   When so proudly she bore her brave crew, With her flag proudly floating before her,   The boast of the Red, White, and Blue.--CHORUS.  That banner, that banner bring hither,   Tho' rebels and traitors look grim; May the wreaths it has won never wither,   Nor the stars of its glory grow dim! May the service united ne'er sever,   But they to their colors prove true! The Army and Navy forever,   Three cheers for the Red, White, and Blue.--CHORUS.     THE ARMY BEAN.

Gathering round our firesides,   Tho' it be summer time, We sit and talk of brothers abroad,   Forgetting the midnight chime.  CHORUS.  Brave boys are they!   Gone at their country's call; And yet, and yet we cannot forget   That many brave boys must fall.

Resting on grassy couches,   Pillow'd on hillocks damp, Of martial fare how little we know   Till brothers are in camp.--CHORUS.  Thinking no less of them,   Loving our country the more, We sent them forth to fight for the flag   Their fathers before them bore. Though the great teardrops started,   This was our parting trust: \"God bless you, boys! we'll welcome you home When rebels are in the dust.\"--CHO.  May the bright wings of love   Guard them wherever they roam; The time has come when brothers must fight   And sisters must pray at home. Oh! the dread field of battle!

Great battles at      Gettysburg! Union soldiers gain the day!_\" Upon hearing such      glorious news Chaplain McCabe sung this soul-stirring hymn,      all the prisoners joining heartily in the chorus, making the      old prison walls ring--\"Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!\"  [Illustration: SIXTEENTH CORPS.]  Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is tramping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible quick sword;      His truth is marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!  I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps; They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I have read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps;      His day is marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!  I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel, \"As ye deal with my contemners, so with my grace shall deal; Let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel,      Since God is marching on.\"  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!  He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet;      Our God is marching on.  CHORUS.--Glory, Glory, Hallelujah!  In the beauties of the lillies Christ was born across the sea With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, _let us die to make men free_,      While God is marching on.

If you look across the hill-tops that meet the northern sky, Long moving lines of rising dust your vision may descry;   And now the wind, an instant, tears the cloud veil aside,   And floats aloft our spangled flag in glory and in pride; And bayonets in the sunlight gleam, and bands brave music pour-- We are coming, Father Abraham--three hundred thousand more!  If you look all up our valleys, where the growing harvests shine, You may see our sturdy farmer-boys fast forming into line,   And children from their mothers' knees are pulling at the weeds,   And learning how to reap and sow, against their country's needs; And a farewell group stands weeping at every cottage door-- We are coming, Father Abraham--three hundred thousand more!  You have called us, and we're coming, by Richmond's bloody tide, To lay us down for freedom's sake, our brothers' bones beside.   Or from foul treason's savage grasp to wrench the murderous blade,   And in the face of foreign foes its fragments to parade. Six hundred thousand loyal men and true have gone before-- We are coming, Father Abraham--three hundred thousand more!  [Illustration]     TENTING ON THE OLD CAMP GROUND.  (Used by permission of S.

We're tired of the war on the old camp ground;     Many are dead and gone Of the brave and true who have left their homes;     Others been wounded long.--CHORUS.  We've been fighting today on the old camp ground;     Many are lying near; Some are dead and some are dying,     Many are in tears.  CHORUS.

Much patience and forbearance   The North has always shown Toward her Southern brethren,   Who had each way their own; But when we made our President   A man whom we desired Their wrath was roused, they mounted guns,   And on Fort Sumter fired.--CHORUS.
