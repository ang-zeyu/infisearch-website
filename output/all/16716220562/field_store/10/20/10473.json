It was as the rooster had said. The six geese were waddling around a corner of the barn in single file. Somehow the sight of them made him so furious that he forgot he had been picking a quarrel with the rooster.  \"I'll attend to them,\" he gobbled. \"I'll fix them. They'll be so scared that they won't dare leave this yard again.\"  Turkey Proudfoot hurried towards the geese. He didn't take time to strut, but ran across the yard with long strides.  \"Don't be silly geese!\" Turkey Proudfoot called. \"Keep away from the duck-pond! The weather's getting colder every day; and it makes me shiver to see you start off for a swim.\"  Turkey Proudfoot had supposed the six geese would be very meek and most eager to obey his commands. But to his great surprise they stopped, wheeled about so that they stood in a row, facing him, and hissed loudly.  It was not at all the sort of answer Turkey Proudfoot had expected.     IV  SCARING THE GEESE   The six geese stood in a row and hissed at Turkey Proudfoot. He was so astonished that any one of them could have knocked him over with a feather, almost. When he gobbled an order at them, telling them not to go swimming again, the geese hissed at him. That was just the same as telling him to keep still and mind his own affairs.  And Turkey Proudfoot was not used to answers like that.  The rooster had followed him across the farmyard in order to look on and listen while Turkey Proudfoot spoke to the geese. And his surprise was as great as Turkey Proudfoot's.  \"Surely!\" he muttered to Turkey Proudfoot, \"you aren't going to let these geese go unpunished. They've insulted you.\"  \"Ha! I _thought_ they had,\" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. \"And I'm glad to know that you agree with me. There's no doubt that they deserve a severe beating.\"  \"Ah!\" the rooster cried. \"Now we'll see some fun.\"  \"Yes!\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"I expect we'll have a merry time.\" Still he made no move to attack the geese, who stood motionless, facing him like soldiers.  \"Well!\" the rooster said impatiently. \"Aren't you going to punish these geese?\"  \"Certainly not!\" Turkey Proudfoot cried. \"Why did you tag after me across the yard if it wasn't to fight them? I've often heard that you were usually spoiling for a fight. So here's your chance!\"  It was true, in a way, that the rooster was always ready to fight. Not one of the cockerels on the farm dared to speak to him. But he always took care to fight only such as he knew he could whip. Certainly he had no desire to fight six geese all by himself. He drew back a little and shook his head.  \"This is not my quarrel,\" he declared.  \"But you suggested it,\" Turkey Proudfoot reminded him. \"And now I suggest that you take it up. I did my part. You must do yours.\"  A wild look came into the rooster's eyes. He wanted to run away. But he was a proud bird. He thought a great deal of the _looks_ of things. And he didn't know just what to do.  Then something happened that suddenly made him act--and act quickly. The six geese all took one step forward.  The rooster turned tail and dashed around the barn, out of sight. And Turkey Proudfoot found himself facing the six geese, who soon took one more step towards him and hissed louder than ever.  He had never felt so ill at ease in all his life. But he remembered that he was the ruler of the turkey flock and the handsomest bird on the farm. It would never do to have it said that he ran away from six silly geese.  \"I'll scare 'em,\" he thought. Thereupon he burst into a deafening gobble and took one step towards the geese.  He had fully expected to see them fall back. What they actually did was most annoying. Every one of them took another step towards him.     V  A SAFE PERCH   As Turkey Proudfoot faced the six geese in the farmyard he began to feel that he had made a great mistake in speaking to them. Their hisses were far from agreeable. They were even threatening.  \"This will never do,\" Turkey Proudfoot muttered to himself. \"No doubt I could whip all six of them; but they'd be likely to pull some of my tail feathers out. And I don't want my tail spoiled.\" For a moment or two he didn't know what to do. But suddenly an idea popped into his head.  \"Follow me!\" he ordered the geese. And wheeling about, he marched off across the farmyard.  The geese waddled after him.  Perched on top of a wagon wheel in front of the barn, the rooster saw the odd procession. And he gave voice loudly to his delight.  \"The geese are chasing Turkey Proudfoot!\" he crowed. He called to everybody to hurry and see the fun. And all the hens came a-running.  \"Nonsense!\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"I ordered the geese to follow me. They're simply obeying orders.\" And he strutted, a little faster than usual, toward the tree near the farmhouse where he roosted every night.  \"Halt!\" he cried to the geese when they reached the tree. As he spoke, Turkey Proudfoot flapped himself up and settled on a low branch. At last he felt safe. He knew that the geese wouldn't follow him up there. With their webbed feet they never roosted in trees.  Meanwhile the hen turkeys had come a-running too, from the meadow. They wanted to see what was going on. And they promptly fell into a loud dispute with the rooster and the hens.  \"He did!\" the hens cackled, meaning that Turkey Proudfoot had run away from the geese.  \"He didn't!\" the hen turkeys squalled, meaning that Turkey Proudfoot hadn't been chased, but had _led_ the geese across the farmyard.  The six geese took no part in the quarrel. They had driven Turkey Proudfoot into the tree. And knowing that he wouldn't come down so long as they waited there, they marched off in single file toward the duck pond.  \"Where are you going?\" the rooster asked them.  The leader of the geese turned her head at him and hissed. And her five companions turned their heads at him too, and hissed likewise.  \"I ordered them to go and have a swim,\" Turkey Proudfoot cried from his tree, as soon as the geese were out of hearing. \"I don't want them about the farmyard. I haven't time to bother with them. Besides, they're so stupid that I never could teach them anything. I walked ahead of them, across the farmyard, to show them the stylish strut. But they couldn't learn it. They'll waddle to the end of their days.\"  \"There!\" cried the hen turkeys to the hens. \"You hear what he says. The geese weren't chasing him. He was trying to teach them to strut.\"  \"Huh!\" exclaimed Henrietta Hen, who always spoke her mind right out. \"Turkey Proudfoot had better be careful. Some day those geese will teach him how to waddle.\"     VI  THE MIMIC   Young Master Meadow Mouse had often peeped at Turkey Proudfoot from behind a clump of grass, or a hill of corn. But he had never dared show himself to Turkey Proudfoot. Somehow the old gobbler looked terribly fierce. And he was so big that Master Meadow Mouse didn't like the idea of even saying \"Good day!\" to him. He had heard Turkey Proudfoot spoken of as a \"gobbler.\" Who knew but that a gobbler would gobble up young Master Meadow Mouse if he had a chance?  Unseen by everybody, Master Meadow Mouse had watched the geese drive Turkey Proudfoot across the farmyard and seen him flapping up to roost in a tree out of their reach. And though Turkey Proudfoot strutted and tried to act very lordly as he headed the procession across the yard, Master Meadow Mouse had noticed how Turkey Proudfoot kept a wary eye on the geese behind him, and stepped not quite so high as he usually did, but further.  \"Ho!\" Master Meadow Mouse had piped to himself in his thin voice. \"Turkey Proudfoot is not the brave fellow I always thought him. He's afraid of geese!\"  From that moment Master Meadow Mouse forgot his fear of Turkey Proudfoot. Nobody stands in awe of a coward. So the very next time that Master Meadow Mouse saw Turkey Proudfoot strutting in the yard he crept up behind Turkey Proudfoot and tried to walk exactly like him.  There were a good many farmyard fowls scratching about the yard at the time, and wishing to appear at his best, Turkey Proudfoot spread his tail, puffed out his chest, and strolled all around as if he--and and not Farmer Green--owned the place.  Although Turkey Proudfoot seemed to see none of his neighbors, nevertheless he was watching them carefully out of the corner of his eye, to see whether they were noticing him.  They were. There was no doubt of that.  Not only were they looking at him; they were laughing at him as well.  Turkey Proudfoot's face couldn't grow red with rage. It was red already. It was always red. Being very angry, he gobbled at the giggling hens, at the rooster, even at old dog Spot, \"Why are you laughing at me?\"  \"We aren't!\" they cried. \"You've no reason to be angry with us.\"  \"'Tis well,\" said Turkey Proudfoot with a toplofty toss of his bald head. \"Since you're not laughing at me, you needn't laugh at all. I don't like your sniggering.\"  \"We can't help laughing,\" a few of the more daring ones told him. \"It's so funny!\"  \"What is?\"  \"He is!\"  \"Who is?\"  \"Master Meadow Mouse!\"  \"Master Meadow Mouse!\" repeated Turkey Proudfoot in a bewildered fashion.  He looked in front of him. He looked to the left. He looked to the right. He couldn't see Master Meadow Mouse anywhere.  \"Look behind you!\" cried Henrietta Hen.  Turkey Proudfoot turned his head.  \"I don't see any Master Meadow Mouse,\" he grumbled.  \"How can you, when your tail's spread like that?\" Henrietta Hen asked him. \"Close up your tail and then you'll see what we're laughing at.\"  But Turkey Proudfoot declined to do anything of the sort.  \"It's just a trick,\" he squalled. \"You're all jealous of me and my beautiful tail. You don't want me to carry my tail this way.\"  Behind Turkey Proudfoot's tail Master Meadow Mouse did a very naughty thing. He stuck out his tongue. And all the onlookers shrieked with merriment.     VII  HALF WRONG   It was no wonder that Turkey Proudfoot was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21844"],["title","The Tale of Turkey Proudfoot (#2)"],["body","y. Everybody in the farmyard was laughing and looking his way--or so it seemed to him.  Since he couldn't see any joke, he decided to leave his silly neighbors and go off into the fields where he could be alone. So he walked slowly away, holding his head high and stepping in his most elegant manner.  To his great disgust peals of laughter followed him. And though he had intended to march off without saying a word, this last outburst so filled him with rage that he couldn't resist spinning about to glare and gobble at his tormentors.  He turned so quickly that he surprised Master Meadow Mouse with one of his tiny feet lifted high in the air. He surprised him so much that Master Meadow Mouse stood stock still and didn't even bring his foot down, but held it off the ground as if it had frozen stiff and couldn't be moved.  At first there was a most joyful look on Master Meadow Mouse's face. But it faded instantly into one of doubt and dismay. To tell the truth, Master Meadow Mouse hadn't expected Turkey Proudfoot to turn around and catch him right in his mimicking act.  \"Ah, ha!\" cried Turkey Proudfoot. \"So it's you that they're laughing at, eh?\"  Master Meadow Mouse was so upset that he murmured faintly, \"Yes, it's me.\"  \"Well, I don't blame them,\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"You certainly look very queer. Why are you holding your foot off the ground like that?\"  \"I was in the midst of taking a step when you turned around and startled me,\" Master Meadow Mouse explained. \"And I don't know whether to set my foot down ahead of me, or to put it behind me.\"  \"Don't be alarmed!\" Turkey Proudfoot said. \"I never fight folks of your size. You're too little for me to pay much attention to. I must say, however, that you have a very odd way of walking.\"  By this time Master Meadow Mouse had recovered from his surprise and wasn't afraid in the least. Now he laughed heartily.  \"I was walking the way you walk,\" he cried.  \"Oh, no!\" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. \"No, indeed! You certainly weren't.\" He didn't ask Master Meadow Mouse's pardon for contradicting.  \"I'd like to know why I wasn't,\" Master Meadow Mouse replied somewhat hotly. \"I was strutting right behind you, all the way across the yard. That's why everybody was giggling.\"  \"It's no wonder they were poking fun at you,\" Turkey Proudfoot told him. \"You amused the neighbors because you thought you were strutting, while you really weren't.\"  Master Meadow Mouse put his foot down on the ground. He was puzzled.  \"I don't know why I wasn't strutting,\" he retorted. \"I was raising my feet just as high as I could lift them.\"  \"Ah, yes?\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"But you forgot one thing.\"  \"What was that?\"  \"You didn't spread your tail,\" Turkey Proudfoot explained. \"And that's half of strutting.\"  \"I--I didn't know it,\" Master Meadow Mouse stammered. And then he darted away, to hide in the grass beyond the fence.  He felt much ashamed to have made such a mistake.     VIII  HARD TO PLEASE   It was very hard to please Turkey Proudfoot. To be sure, he always pleased himself. But nothing anyone else did seemed to suit him. And there was one thing that always made him peevish. That was the gobbling of the younger turkey cocks.  To anybody that wasn't a turkey, their voices sounded just as sweet as Turkey Proudfoot's. But he claimed that there was something wrong with all gobbles except his own. Either they were too loud or too soft, too high or too low, too long or too short. And whenever a young cock gobbled in his hearing Turkey Proudfoot was sure to rush up to him and order him to keep still, for pity's sake!  They usually obeyed him. Not only was Turkey Proudfoot the biggest gobbler on the farm, but he had a fierce and lordly look about him. It was a bold young turkey cock that dared defy him. Once in a while one of them foolishly ventured to tell Turkey Proudfoot to mind his own affairs. And then there was sure to be a fight--a quick, short, noisy fray which ended always in the same fashion, with Turkey Proudfoot chasing the young cock out of the farmyard.  Luckily for the youngsters, they could run faster than he could, for they were not nearly as heavy.  Although Turkey Proudfoot didn't like to hear others gobble, nevertheless he enjoyed the excuse for a fight that their gobbling gave him. And when he had nothing more important to do he often stood still and listened in the hope of hearing some upstart gobbler testing his voice in a neighboring field. Newly grown cocks had to go a long way off to be safe from Turkey Proudfoot's attacks.  One day in the middle of the summer the lord of the turkey flock was feeding behind the barn when a loud gobble brought his head up with a jerk.  \"Ha!\" Turkey Proudfoot cried. \"That's somebody in the yard, around the barn. He thinks I'm further away than this, or he'd never dare bawl like that.\"  Turkey Proudfoot dashed around the barn at a swift trot. He was surprised to see not a turkey cock in the farmyard. The rooster was there, however. And Turkey Proudfoot eyed him sternly.  \"You weren't trying to gobble a moment ago, were you?\" he inquired.  \"No, indeed!\" said the rooster.  Turkey Proudfoot looked puzzled.  \"Somebody gobbled,\" he declared. \"I'm sure the noise came from this yard. I was behind the barn when I heard it. And I hurried around the corner at once.\"  \"Maybe the person that gobbled ran around the other end of the barn, to dodge you,\" the rooster suggested.  \"I'll go and see,\" said Turkey Proudfoot. And he went back where he came from.  He found nobody there. But that annoying gobble sounded again and brought him back into the yard even faster than before. \"Who did that?\" he squalled.  And somebody mocked him. Somebody repeated his question after him. It was the same voice that had gobbled.  Turkey Proudfoot's rage was terrible to see.     IX  A STRANGE GOBBLE   \"Gobble, _gobble, gobble, gobble!_\"  Turkey Proudfoot stood in the farmyard and craned his neck in every direction. That sound certainly was close at hand. Yet there wasn't a turkey cock anywhere in sight, either on the ground or in the trees.  Just for a moment Turkey Proudfoot was worried.  \"That wasn't _my_ gobble, was it?\" he asked the rooster. \"If I gobbled, I didn't know it.\"  \"No! You didn't gobble,\" said the rooster, \"though I must say that gobbling sounded a good deal like yours.\"  \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!_\"  \"There it goes again!\" cried Turkey Proudfoot. He was almost frantic. \"How can I fight that fellow if I can't see him?\" he cried. He looked up at the roof of the barn; but there was no one there except the gilded rooster that told which way the wind blew. He looked up at the roof of the farmhouse.  \"You don't suppose that fellow's hiding in the chimney, do you?\" he asked.  \"No doubt he is,\" said the rooster. \"If I were you I'd fly up there and catch him.\"  \"The roof's high for one of my weight to fly to,\" Turkey Proudfoot remarked.  \"Still, I could flap up to the top of the woodshed and get to the roof of the house from there.... I'll take a look and see how high the house seems when I'm near it.\"  [Illustration: Polly Imitates Turkey Proudfoot's Gobble. (_Page_ 42)]  To the rooster's delight, Turkey Proudfoot started towards the house. The rooster promptly called to all the hens to \"come quick,\" because Turkey Proudfoot was going to fly to the roof of the farmhouse. \"I hope he won't get into trouble,\" said the rooster with a chuckle. \"It would be a pity if he fell down the chimney.\"  In spite of his words, the rooster didn't look at all uneasy. Indeed, the only thing that worried him was the fear that Turkey Proudfoot _wouldn't_ get himself into a scrape. But he thought it more polite not to say exactly what he hoped.  Turkey Proudfoot stalked up to the farmhouse and stopped near the piazza. He was gazing upwards and measuring the height of the roof with his eye when all at once a loud \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!_\" almost tipped him over backward.  The outcry came from the farmhouse. There was no doubt of that. But it didn't come from the roof, nor the chimney.  Turkey Proudfoot stared at the windows and the doors and saw no one except Miss Kitty Cat, dozing on a window sill. Then something moved beneath the piazza ceiling. It was a cage, which swayed as a green figure clung to the wires on one side of it.  \"I'm a handsome bird,\" a voice informed Turkey Proudfoot. \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble!_\"  For once in his life Turkey Proudfoot hadn't a word to say. For the moment he was struck dumb.  At last he found his voice. \"Who are you?\" he bellowed.  \"Ha! ha! ha! ha!\"  \"Don't laugh at me!\" cried Turkey Proudfoot.  \"Polly wants a cracker,\" said the green bird.  A few quick steps brought Turkey Proudfoot upon the piazza, nearer the cage where the annoying green person swung and made queer, throaty noises--sounds which only angered Turkey Proud foot the more.  Turkey Proudfoot took a little run and rose into the air, to crash against the cage and then fall flapping upon the piazza floor.  The green person shrieked. And the hired man, with an axe in his hand, peered out of the woodshed door.  \"Here, you old gobbler! You leave our Polly alone!\" he called. And he ran out and gave Turkey Proudfoot a sharp rap with the axe helve.  Turkey Proudfoot ran off and hid behind the barn and sulked.  \"There's a bird around here,\" he muttered, \"that mocks Miss Kitty Cat; and they call him a Cat Bird. Now, here's a bird that mocks me; so I should think they'd call him a Turkey Bird. But they don't. I heard the hired man call him Pretty Polly.  \"Pretty Polly indeed!\" Turkey Proudfoot sniffed. \"That creature is nothing but a bunch of green feathers and a loud voice.\"     X  THE WORM TURNS   Henrietta Hen had no love for Turkey Proudfoot. Beginning with the days of her chickenhood he had always ordered her about, telling her not to do this and not to do that. Even after she was grown up and had a family of her own, Turkey Proudfoot treated her as if she had just begun "]]]
