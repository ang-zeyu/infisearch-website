Distinct sexual desire fortunately does not make its appearance in the girl at this period, as it does in the boy, but she becomes filled with vague undefined and undefinable longings. It is the period of \"crushes\" when the girl is apt to bestow her overflowing emotion on a girl friend. There is nothing reprehensible in these crushes--they act as a safety valve--and only in rare cases are they apt to lead to abnormal development. This is also the period of day-dreaming and of romancing; the girl likes to read love-stories and novels in which she identifies herself with the heroine. And it makes quite some difference as to what the girl reads during this period, for literature has a strong influence on the young in the most plastic period of their lives; and it is important that older persons see to it that those in their care spend their time on books of noble ideals and high artistic value.  Girls of a highly sensitive or so-called \"nervous\" temperament, especially if there is \"nervousness\" in the family, must be particularly looked after. For it is during the years of puberty and adolescence that any neurotic traits are apt to develop and become emphasized. It is also the period when bad sexual habits (masturbation) are apt to develop, and the careful mother will devote special attention to her girls in their years of puberty, and guard them as much as possible against physical and emotional shocks.  The age of puberty in girls is by many writers considered as synonymous or synchronous with the onset of menstruation, which in this country in the majority of cases occurs between the ages of thirteen and fourteen. The year of gradual development before the onset of menstruation is by some referred to as the pre-pubertal year; and the first year after the onset of menstruation is the post-pubertal year. The period from puberty to full sexual maturity is called adolescence, and this term is applied generally to the period between thirteen and eighteen. For at eighteen the boy and the girl have reached full maturity. Mentally we acquire things as long as we live, and even physically the body gets larger for some years after eighteen. But sexually both boys and girls are fully mature at eighteen, though in order to become parents it is best, for various reasons, to wait to the ages of twenty or twenty-five.  =Nubility.= Nubility is the age or state when a boy or a girl is \"fit\" for marriage. This is a vague and unsatisfactory term. At the age of thirteen to fifteen boys and girls are physically \"fit\" for marriage, that is at that age a boy is capable of begetting and a girl of having children. But it does not mean that it would be advisable for them to marry at such an early age. Neither their bodies nor their minds are fully developed, and children begotten of such young parents are apt to be weaklings, both mentally and physically. The youngest age for girls to marry should be eighteen, and for boys twenty; but the youngest age for becoming parents should be twenty to twenty-two for the mother and twenty-three to twenty-five for the father.     CHAPTER SIX  MENSTRUATION   Definition of Menstruation--Where Menstrual Blood Comes From--Age   of Menstruation--Age of Cessation of   Menstruation--Duration--Amount--Regularity and Irregularity.   The first function with which the girl will be confronted, which will impress upon her that she is a creature of sex, that she is decidedly different from the boy, is _menstruation_. And this function we will now proceed to study.  What is menstruation? Menstruation is a monthly discharge of blood. The word is derived from the Latin word mensis, which means a month; and menstruation is also frequently spoken of as _the menses_. It is also called the catamenia or catamenia-flow (Greek, kata--by, men--a month). Other terms are: the periods, courses, monthlies, turns, monthly changes, monthly sickness, sickness, flowers, to be unwell, to be regular. \"Not to see anything\" is a common term for having missed the menses. This flow of blood recurs in most cases with remarkable regularity once a month; not a calendar month, but once a lunar month, i.e., once every twenty-eight days. And as there are thirteen lunar months a year, a woman menstruates not twelve but thirteen times a year.  Where does the menstrual blood come from? The menstrual blood comes from the inside of the womb. Every month, for a few days prior to menstruation, the inside lining of the womb (what we call the mucous membrane or endometrium) becomes congested and its bloodvessels become distended with blood. If the woman has sexual intercourse and pregnancy happens to take place, then this extra blood is used to nourish and develop the new child; but if no pregnancy takes place, that extra blood exudes from the bloodvessels (some of the bloodvessels rupture) and is discharged from the uterus into the vagina, and from there to the outside, where it is caught on cotton, sanitary napkins or some other pad.  =At what age does menstruation begin?= The usual age at which menstruation begins in this country is thirteen or fourteen; in some it may occur as early as twelve, in others as late as fifteen, sixteen or even seventeen. For menstruation to begin earlier than twelve or later than seventeen is in this country a rare exception. But in cold northern climates the age of eighteen is not rare, and in the hot southern climates menstruation often starts at the ages of ten or eleven. Change of climate or of country will often have an influence on the menses. In the early years of his medical practice, the author had many Finnish girls as patients. It was a very common occurrence for them to stop menstruating for the first few months or even for the first year of their residence in this country.  =At what age does menstruation cease?= The age at which menstruation ceases is called the _menopause_ or _climacteric_. It usually takes place at the age of forty-eight or fifty. In some cases it does not take place until the age of fifty-two, in others it takes place as early as forty-five or forty-four. In general, it may be said that the woman's menstruating period, during which she is able to have children, lasts about thirty-five years. And if no restraint be taken, and if no precautions be taken against conception, a woman could have twenty or thirty children during her childbearing period.  =How many days does a woman menstruate?= The usual number of days is from three to five; in some cases menstruation lasts only two days, in others as long as seven. As a rule, the greatest amount of blood passed is during the first two days.  =The amount of blood.= It is hard to estimate the exact amount of blood passed by a woman during her menses, but it reaches about an ounce and a half to three ounces. In some women the amount may reach as much as four or five ounces and in exceptional cases as much as eight ounces. Where it exceeds this amount, it is an abnormal condition, requiring treatment. The usual statement that a normally menstruating woman should not have to use more than three napkins during the twenty-four hours is correct.  _The periodical regularity_ with which menstruation recurs in many women is remarkable. I know a woman who has not missed her menses in twenty years; during those twenty years the menses have started every fourth Friday, almost always at the same hour. I know another one who has her menses every fourth Wednesday, about seven in the morning. She skipped her periods during her two pregnancies, then they were irregular for a while, then they came back to Wednesday. Other women have their menses on a certain day of the month, say the first or the fifth, regardless of the number of days in the month (such cases are, however, exceptional). And in some women the menses are irregular: every three weeks, every five or six weeks, every six or seven weeks, etc. Some women never know when they may expect their menses, so irregular they are.     CHAPTER SEVEN  ABNORMALITIES OF MENSTRUATION   Disorders of Menstruation--Menorrhagia--Metrorrhagia--Amenorrhea--   Vicarious Menstruation--Dysmenorrhea of Organic and of Nervous   Origin.   In many girls and women menstruation is a perfectly normal, physiological process. They suffer no discomfort whatever from it. They suffer no pains, no headache, no irritability, they have no admonition of its onset, until they feel the blood oozing or trickling out. But, unfortunately, this is true only of a small percentage. The majority of women have some unpleasant symptoms. Some have a headache for a day or two, some complain of a dragging down sensation, some are irritable, feel depressed or quarrelsome; some have no appetite, no ambition, no desire for work or company, while some girls have such severe pains and cramps that they are obliged to go to bed for a day or two and call in medical aid.  When the menstruation is very profuse, resembling more a hemorrhage than normal menstruation, it is called _menorrhagia_; if the hemorrhage from the uterus occurs out of the regular menstrual periods, it is called _metrorrhagia_. When the menses are skipped, or when they are so scanty that you can hardly notice any blood, we use the term _amenorrhea_. In a few rare cases the menstruation instead of coming normally from the uterus, comes from some other part of the body, for instance, the nose. Some women have a hemorrhage from the nose every month. In some a bloody discharge may come from the breasts. To such a substitute menstruation we apply the term _vicarious menstruation_. Such cases, however, are rare, and are mere curiosities.  =Dysmenorrhea.= I mentioned before that in some girls and women the menses are accompanied by pains and cramps. This affliction, which is the lot of millions of women, and from which men are entirely free, is called _dysmenorrhea_. Dysmenorrhea means painful and difficult menstruation.

They said he had the most beautiful tail on the farm. When he spread it and strutted about Farmer Green's place the hen turkeys were sure to nudge one another and say, \"Ahem! Isn't he elegant?\"  But the rest of the farmyard folk made quite different remarks about him. They declared Turkey Proudfoot to be a silly, vain gobbler, noisy and quarrelsome.  Now, there was truth in what everybody thought and said about this lordly person, Turkey Proudfoot. He did have a huge tail, when he chose to spread it; and his feathers shone with a greenish, coppery, bronzy glitter that might easily have turned the head of anybody that boasted such beautiful colors. Certainly the hen turkeys turned their heads--and craned their necks--whenever Turkey Proudfoot came near them. And when he spoke to them, saying \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble!_\" in a loud tone, they were always pleased.  The hen turkeys seemed to find that remark, \"_Gobble, gobble, gobble!_\" highly interesting. But everybody else complained about the noise that Turkey Proudfoot made, and said that if he must gobble they wished he would go off by himself, where people didn't have to listen to him.  And nobody but the hen turkeys liked the way Turkey Proudfoot walked. At every step he took he raised a foot high in the air, acting for all the world as if the ground wasn't good enough for him to walk upon. And when he wasn't picking up a seed, or a bit of grain, or an insect off the ground, he held his head very high. Often Turkey Proudfoot seemed to look right past his farmyard neighbors, as if he were gazing at something in the next field and didn't see them. But they soon learned that that was only an odd way of his. Really, he saw about everything that went on. If anybody happened to grin at him Turkey Proudfoot was sure to take notice at once and try to pick a quarrel.  After all, perhaps it wasn't strange that Turkey Proudfoot should act as he did. Being the ruler of Farmer Green's whole flock of turkeys, he was somewhat spoiled. All the hen turkeys did about as he told them to do. Or if they didn't, Turkey Proudfoot thought that they obeyed his orders. And the younger gobblers as well had to mind him. If they didn't, Turkey Proudfoot fought them until they were ready to gobble for mercy.  Having whipped the younger gobblers a good many times, Turkey Proudfoot firmly believed that he could whip anything or anybody. And there was nobody on the farm, almost, at whom he hadn't dashed at least once. He had even attacked Farmer Green. But Farmer Green quickly taught him better. A blow on the head from a stout stick bowled Turkey Proudfoot over and he never tried to fight Farmer Green again.  That proved that Turkey Proudfoot wasn't as empty-headed as some of his neighbors thought him. It was possible to get a lesson into his head, even if one had to knock it into his skull with a club.     II  THE SILLY SIX   Farmer Green owned six geese. Though there was an even number of them, they were odd creatures. They had little to do with the other farmyard folk, but kept much to themselves. If one of them started up the road on some errand, the other five always followed her. If one of them suddenly took it into her head to enjoy a swim her five companions were sure to want one too, and waddled with her to the duck pond.  Now, Turkey Proudfoot never went swimming. Like all the rest of the flock over which he ruled, he thought swimming was bad for one's health. He couldn't understand how anybody could enjoy cold water, except for drinking purposes. And somehow he always felt as if his feathers had been a bit ruffled whenever he saw the six geese set out for the duck pond. Although their taking a swim was no affair of his, still it made him angry.  \"Look at those geese!\" he would gobble angrily to anybody that happened to be near him. \"They're going to take another cold, wet bath. They're old enough to know better. I often wonder why Farmer Green wants such a stupid crew on his farm. The Silly Six, I call 'em!\"  When Turkey Proudfoot talked in that fashion there were some that didn't agree with him. The ducks never failed to quack their displeasure. And old Spot sometimes growled and told him he'd be the better for a good swim.  But Turkey Proudfoot always declared, in answer to that, that he knew he'd catch his death of cold if he ever stepped into the duck pond. And there were some of the same mind as he.  There was Miss Kitty Cat, who never liked to get her feet wet and on stormy days lay by the hour beneath the kitchen stove and dozed.  And there was the rooster. He didn't believe in wet, cold baths. He liked dry dust baths. And when, one day, Turkey Proudfoot turned to him suddenly and gobbled, \"There go the Silly Six to swim!\" the rooster answered with a sniff, \"Well, let 'em go! Don't stop 'em on my account. I certainly don't want to join them.\"  Turkey Proudfoot was all ready for a quarrel. \"I hope you don't think _I_ want to go swimming with the geese,\" he retorted. There was a dangerous glitter in his eyes.  Seeing this, the rooster made haste to assure Turkey Proudfoot that he meant nothing of the sort.  \"Don't let's quarrel!\" the rooster cried--for he was much smaller than Turkey Proudfoot. \"There's nothing for us to quarrel about. We're of the same mind about the geese and their swimming.\"  \"I'm disappointed,\" Turkey Proudfoot told him. \"For a moment I thought I had an excuse for fighting you. And I'm not sure that I oughtn't to be angry with you for agreeing with me when I didn't expect you to.\"  The rooster gave a hoarse crow. He thought Turkey Proudfoot was joking. And being afraid of Turkey Proudfoot, the rooster felt obliged to laugh loudly at his jokes.  \"Don't laugh at me!\" Turkey Proudfoot cried.  \"C-c-can't I laugh at the six silly geese?\" the rooster stammered.  \"Yes!\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"Yes--if you see anything funny about them. For my part, I couldn't laugh at them if I tried to. The mere thought of plunging into cold water almost gives me a chill.\"     III  THE MEDDLER   \"Why don't you tell the geese that it's dangerous for them to swim in the duck pond?\" the rooster asked Turkey Proudfoot. \"Tell them how it almost gives you a chill just to see them set out for the pond. Ask them to keep out of the water.\"  Turkey Proudfoot drew himself up to his full height, spread his tail, and looked down at the rooster with great disdain. \"Ask!\" he exclaimed. \"I never ask anything of anybody. I'll have you know, sir, that I give orders. And when I give 'em I expect folks to obey 'em.\"  \"Good!\" cried the rooster gayly. He was really shaking in his shoes and didn't intend to let Turkey Proudfoot know it. \"Order the geese to stay away from the water. Command them to stop swimming. If you don't, you'll have a terrible chill some day when you see them set out for the duck pond. And you don't want to be ill just before the holidays.\"  \"That's true,\" said Turkey Proudfoot. \"I don't want to get a chill and be ill.\" And then he turned suddenly upon the startled rooster. \"Look here!\" cried Turkey Proudfoot. \"It seems to me that _you_ are giving _me_ orders.\"  \"Not at all!\" the rooster assured him. \"No, indeed! You're mistaken.\"  \"Don't tell me I'm mistaken!\" Turkey Proudfoot bawled in an angry, gobbly voice. \"I'm never mistaken.\"  \"Oh, certainly not!\" said the rooster, who was bold as brass with most of his neighbors, but very mild with Turkey Proudfoot.  \"Ha!\" Turkey Proudfoot exclaimed. \"You're getting yourself into a hole, sir! If I wasn't mistaken, then you _were_ giving me orders. And in either case I should have to fight you.\"  This was too much for the rooster. He couldn't grasp what Turkey Proudfoot was saying. He only knew that things looked bad for him because Turkey Proudfoot was getting angrier every moment.  \"I say!\" the rooster cried. \"Please don't waste your time on me just now, Mr. Turkey Proudfoot! Here come the six silly geese back from the duck pond. And I'd suggest that you speak to them at once"]]]
