At that moment the bull's-eye light of an advancing constable became visible, and the defiant air of the thief gave place to a look of anxious fear.  It was evident that the dread of another period of prison life was strong upon the trembling wretch.  Drawing out a handful of coppers, David thrust them quickly into the man's hand, and said--  \"Hae, tak' them, an' aff ye go! an' ask the Lord to help 'ee to dae better.\"  The strong hand relaxed, another moment and the man, slipping round the corner like an unwholesome spirit, was gone.  \"Can ye direck me, polisman,\" said the Scot to the constable, as he was about to pass, \"t' Toor Street?\"  \"Never heard of it,\" said the constable brusquely, but civilly enough.  \"That's queer noo.  I was telt it was hereaboots--Toor Street.\"  \"Oh, perhaps you mean _Tower_ Street\" said the constable, with a patronising smile.  \"Perhaps I div,\" returned the Scot, with that touch of cynicism which is occasionally seen in his race.  \"Can 'ee direck me tilt?\"  \"Yes, but it is on the other side of the river.\"  \"Na--it's on _this_ side o' the river,\" said David quietly yet confidently.  The conversation was here cut short by the bursting on their ears of a sudden noise at some distance.  The policeman turned quickly away, and when David advanced into the main street he observed that there was some excitement among its numerous and riotous occupants.  The noise continued to increase, and it became evident that the cause of it was rapidly approaching, for the sound changed from a distant rumble into a steady roar, in the midst of which stentorian shouts were heard. Gradually the roar culminated, for in another moment there swept round the end of the street a pair of apparently runaway horses, with two powerful lamps gleaming, or rather glaring, above them.  On each side of the driver of the galloping steeds stood a man, shouting like a maniac of the boatswain type.  All three were brass-helmeted, like antique charioteers.  Other helmets gleamed behind them.  Little save the helmets and the glowing lamps could be seen through the dark and smoky atmosphere as the steam fire-engine went thundering by.  Now, if there was one thing more than another that David Laidlaw desired to see, it was a London fire.  Often had he read about these fires, for he was a great reader of books, as well as newspapers, and deeply had his enthusiasm been stirred (though not expressed) by accounts of thrilling escapes and heroic deeds among the firemen.  His eyes therefore flashed back the flame of the lamps as the engine went past him like a red thunderbolt, and he started off in pursuit of it.  But, as many people know, and all may believe, running in a crowded London street is difficult--even to an expert London thief.  Our Scot found that out after a sixty-yards' run; then he had the wisdom to stop, just as a little boy leaped out of his way exclaiming--  \"'Ullo, Goliah! mind w'ere you're a-goin' to.  I wonder yer mother let you hout all alone!\"  \"Whar's the fire, laddie?\" demanded David, with some impatience.  \"'Ow should _I_ know, Scotty!  I ain't a pleeceman, ham I? that I should be expected to know heverythink!\"  As the engine had by that time vanished, no one could tell where the fire was, and as the street had reverted to its normal condition of noise and bustle, David Laidlaw gave up the search for it.  He also gave up as hopeless further search for his friend that night, and resolved to avail himself of one of those numerous establishments in the windows of which it was announced that \"good beds\" were to be had within.  Entering one, the landlord of which had a round jovial countenance, he ordered tea, toast, and sausages, with pen, ink, and paper.  Having heartily consumed the former, he devoted himself to the latter and proceeded to write a letter.  Here is the epistle:--  \"BAWBYLON, I dinna ken where.  \"_5th July_ 18--.  \"DEAR MITHER--Here I am, in Lun'on, an' wow! but it _is_ an awfu' place! 'Ee'll no believe me, but I've been lost twa or three times a'ready, an' I've had a kine o' fecht an' a rescue, an' been taen to the polis office, an' made some freens, an' catched a thief (an' latten 'im aff wi' a caution an' a wheen bawbees), an' seen a fire-engine that lookit as if it was gawn full gallop to destruction.  Ay, wumin, an' I've fawn in a'ready wi' a waux doll!  But dinna ye fear, mither, I'm ower teugh to be gotten the better o' by the likes o' them.  An' noo I'm gawn to my bed, sae as to be ready for mair adventurs the mornin'.  Ye'll admit that I've done gey 'n' weel for the first day.  At this rate I'll be able to write a story-buik when I git hame.  Respecks to faither.  Yer affectionate son, DAVID.  \"_P.S._--The lan'lord's just been in, an' I've had a lang crack wi' him aboot the puir folk an' the thieves o' this Great Bawbylon.  Wow, but I _am_ wae for them.  Seems to me they have na got a chance i' the battle o' life.  He says he'll tak' me to see ane o' their low lodgin'-hooses the morn.  Guid-nicht.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  We turn now to a very different scene--to a West End drawing-room, in which is to be found every appliance, in the way of comfort and luxurious ease, that ingenuity can devise or labour produce.  An exceedingly dignified, large, self-possessed yet respectful footman, with magnificent calves in white stockings, has placed a silver tray, with three tiny cups and a tiny teapot thereon, near to the hand of a beautiful middle-aged lady--the mistress of the mansion.  She is reading a letter with evident interest.  A girl of seventeen, whose style of beauty tells of the closest relationship, sits beside her, eagerly awaiting the news which is evidently contained in the letter.  \"Oh, I am _so_ glad, Rosa! they have found traces of her at last.\"  \"Of who, mother--old nurse?\" asked Rosa.  \"Yes, your father's old nurse; indeed I may say mine also, for when I was a little girl I used to pay long visits to your grandfather's house. And it seems that she is in great poverty--almost destitute.  Dear, _dear_ old nurse! you won't be long in poverty if I can help it!\"  As she spoke, a handsome man of middle age and erect carriage entered the room.  There was an expression of care and anxiety on his countenance, which, however, partly disappeared when the lady turned towards him with a triumphant look and held up the letter.  \"Didn't I tell you, Jack, that your lawyer would find our old nurse if any one could?  He writes me that she has been heard of, living in some very poor district on the south side of the Thames, and hopes to be able to send me her exact address very soon.  I felt quite sure that Mr Lockhart would find her, he is such an obliging and amiable man, as well as clever.  I declare that I can't bear to look at all the useless luxury in which we live when I think of the good and true creatures like old nurse who are perishing in absolute destitution.\"  \"But being disgusted with our luxury and giving it all up would not mend matters, little wife,\" returned Jack with a faint smile.  \"Rich people are not called upon to give up their riches, but to _use_ them--to spend well within their means, so as to have plenty to spare in the way of helping those who are willing to help themselves, and sustaining those who cannot help themselves.  The law of supply and demand has many phases, and the profits resulting therefrom are overruled by a Higher Power than the laws of Political Economy.  There are righteous rich as well as poor; there are wicked poor as well as rich.  What you and I have got to do in this perplexing world is to cut our particular coat according to our cloth.\"  \"Just so,\" said the lady with energy.  \"Your last remark is to the point, whatever may be the worth of your previous statements, and I intend to cut off the whole of my superfluous skirts in order to clothe old nurse and such as she with them.\"  Rosa laughingly approved of this decision, for she was like-minded with her mother, but her father did not respond.  The look of care had returned to his brow, and there was cause for it for Colonel Brentwood had just learned from his solicitor that he was a ruined man.  \"It is hard to have to bring you such news, darling,\" he said, taking his wife's hand, \"especially when you were so happily engaged in devising liberal things for the poor, but God knows what is best for us. He gave us this fortune, when He inclined uncle Richard to leave it to us, and now He has seen fit to take it away.\"  \"But how--what do you mean by taking it away?\" asked poor Mrs Brentwood, perceiving that her husband really had some bad news to tell.  \"Listen; I will explain.  When uncle Richard Weston died, unexpectedly, leaving to us his estate, we regarded it you know, as a gift from God, and came to England resolving to spend our wealth in His service.  Well, yesterday Mr Lockhart informed me that another will has been found, of later date than that which made me uncle Richard's heir, in which the whole estate is left to a distant connection of whose very existence I had become oblivious.\"  \"Well, Jack,\" returned the lady, with a valiant effort to appear reconciled, \"but that is not _ruin_, you know.  Your pay still remains to us.\"  \"I--I fear not.  That is to say, believing the estate to be mine, I have come under obligations which must be met and, besides, I have spent considerable sums which must be refunded--all of which, if I understand the law of the land rightly, means ruin.\"  For some moments Mrs Brentwood sat in silent meditation.  \"Well,\" she said at length, with the air of one who has made up her mind, \"I don't understand much about the law of the land.  All I know is that my purse is full of gold just now, so I will snap my fingers at the law of the land and go right off to visit and succour our dear old Liz.\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  A NIGHT OF ADVENTURES.  According to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21737"],["title","The Garret and the Garden; Or, Low Life High Up (#5)"],["body","gement, David Laidlaw was taken the following evening by his landlord, Mr Spivin, to see one of the low lodging-houses of London.  Our adventurous Scot had often read and heard that some of the low quarters of London were dangerous for respectable men to enter without the escort of the police, but his natural courage and his thorough confidence in the strength of his bulky frame inclined him to smile at the idea of danger.  Nevertheless, by the advice of his new friend the landlord, he left his watch and money, with the exception of a few coppers, behind him--carefully stowed under the pillow of his bed in his shoulder-bag.  For further security the door of his room was locked and the key lung on a nail in an out-of-the-way corner, known only, as Mr Spivin pointed out, to \"their two selves.\"  \"But hoo dis it happen, Mr Speevin,\" asked David, as they walked along the streets together, \"that _ye_ can gang safely amang the thieves withoot a polisman t' proteck ye?\"  \"Oh, as to that,\" replied the jolly landlord, \"I'm connected with a religious society which sends agents down among them poor houtcasts to convert 'em.  They hall knows me, bless you.  But I ain't a-goin' with you myself.  You see, I'm a very busy man, and engagements which I 'ad forgotten prevents me, but I've made an arrangement with one o' the converted thieves to take you to a few of the worst places in London. Of course he can pass you hevery where as one of his friends.\"  To this David made no reply, save with a slight \"Humph!\" as he looked earnestly at his companion.  But Mr Spivin wore an expression of seraphic candour.  \"Here he is,\" added the landlord, as they turned a corner and drew near to a man in mean attire, who seemed to be waiting for some one.  \"He's rather disreputable to look at, only just been converted, an' not 'avin' 'ad the chance yet to better himself.--But--hallo!--you seem to know him.\"  The last exclamation and remark were called forth by the look of surprise on Laidlaw's face, and the air almost of alarm on that of the mean-looking man--alarm which was by no means unnatural, seeing that he was none other than the fellow who had attempted to rob our Scotsman the previous night.  David, however, was quick to recover himself.  \"Know him!\" he cried, with a hearty laugh, \"ay, I ken him weel.  I lent him a helpin' haund last nicht, no' far frae here.\"  \"Surely he was not beggin'?\" exclaimed Mr Spivin in tones of virtuous reproof, \"for a noo convert to go a-beggin', you know, would be houtrageous!\"  \"Na, na,\" answered David, with a quiet and somewhat cynical smile, \"he wasna beggin', puir lad, but I took peety on 'im, an' gee'd 'im some bawbees.  So this is yer new convert, is he? an' he's to be my guide? He'll do.  He'll do.  Sae I'll bid ye guid-nicht, Mr Speevin.\"  As the Scot held out his hand in a very decided manner the landlord was obliged to depart without further enlightenment, after cautioning the \"converted\" thief to take good care of his friend.  When he was gone the Scotsman and the ex-convict stood looking silently at each other, the first with an earnest yet half-sarcastic smile, the other with a mingled expression of reckless amusement, in which, however, there was a trace of anxiety.  \"Weel noo,\" said the former, \"aren't ye an oot-an'-oot blagyird?\"  \"If you mean by that an out-and-out blackguard,\" answered the thief, \"you're not far wrong.\"  \"Ye're honest the noo, ony way,\" remarked the Scot, with a nod.  \"Noo, my man, look ye here.  Ye are nae mair convertit than yer freen' Speevin is, though I took him for a rale honest man at first.  But bein' a blagyird, as ye admit, I'm wullin' t' hire ye in that capacity for the nicht.  Noo, what I want is t' see low life in Lun'on, an' if ye'll tak' me to what they may ca' the warst haunts o' vice, I'll mak' it worth yer while--an' I've got mair siller than ye think for, maybe.\"  A stern frown settled on the thief's face as David spoke.  \"I suppose,\" he said, \"that you want me to show you the misery and destitootion among the poor of London, that you may return to your 'ome in the North and boast that you 'ave `done the slums!'\"  \"Na--na, ye're quite mista'en, man,\" returned David quickly; \"but I want t' see for mysel' what I've heard sae muckle aboot--to see if it's a' true, for I'm wae--I'm\" (correcting himself) \"sorry--for the puir craturs, an' wud fain help some o' them if I could.  Noo, freen',\" he continued, laying his huge hand gently on the man's shoulder, \"if ye want to earn something, an'll tak' me t' where I want t' gang--guid.  If no'--I'll bid ye guid-nicht.\"  \"Do you know,\" said the man, with a furtive glance at David's kindly face, \"the risk you run from the men who live in such places if you go alone and unprotected?\"  \"I ken the risk _they_ run if they daur t' meddle wi' _me_!  Besides, I'll be naether alane nor unproteckit if I've _you_ wi' me, for I can trust ye!\"  A peculiar smile played for a moment on the haggard features of the thief.  \"Scotchman,\" he said, \"whatever your name may be, I--\"  \"My name is David Laidlaw, an' I've nae cause t' be ashamed o't.\"  \"Well, Mr Laidlaw,\" returned the thief, in vastly improved language and tone, \"I'm indebted to you for a good supper and a warm bed last night. Besides, yours is the first friendly touch or kind voice that has greeted me since I was discharged, and you've said you can _trust_ me! So I'll do my best for you even though you should not give me a penny. But remember, you will go among a rough lot whom I have but little power to control.\"  \"Hoots! c'way, man, an' dinna waste time haverin'.\"  Saying this, he grasped his guide by the arm in a friendly way and walked off, much to the surprise of a policeman with an aquiline nose, who turned his bull's-eye full on them as they passed, and then went on his way, shaking his head sagaciously.  As the ill-assorted pair advanced, the streets they traversed seemed to grow narrower and dirtier.  The inhabitants partook of the character of their surroundings, and it struck our Scotsman that, as ordinary shops became fewer and meaner, grog-shops became more numerous and self-assertive.  From out of these dens of debauchery there issued loud cries and curses and ribald songs, and occasionally one or two of the wretched revellers, male or female, were thrust out, that they might finish off a quarrel with a fight in the street, or because they insisted on having more drink without having the means to pay for it.  At one particular point a woman \"in unwomanly rags\" was seen leaning up against a lamp-post with an idiotical expression on her bloated face, making an impassioned speech to some imaginary person at her elbow.  The speech came to an abrupt end when, losing her balance, she fell to the ground, and lay there in drunken contentment.  At the same moment the attention of our explorer was drawn to a riot close at hand, occasioned by two men engaged in a fierce encounter. They were loudly cheered and backed by their friends, until all were scattered by two powerful constables, who swooped suddenly on the scene and captured one of the combatants, while the other almost overturned David as he ran against him in passing, and escaped.  \"Come down here,\" said the thief, turning sharp to the left and passing under a low archway.  It led to a narrow alley, which seemed to terminate in total darkness. Even Laidlaw's stout heart beat somewhat faster as he entered it, but he did not hesitate.  At the end of the passage a dim light appeared.  It was thrown by a very dirty lamp, and disclosed a small court of unutterable meanness and inconceivable smells.  One or two men had brushed past them, and David observed that his guide accosted these in a language, or slang, which he did not understand.  \"I've got a friend in here,\" said his guide, opening a door and disclosing an extremely dirty room of about ten feet square.  A woman with her back towards the door was busy at a wash-tub.  Ragged clothes were drying on a clothes-line.  A shattered bed, on which lay a bundle of straw and a torn blanket, stood in one corner; a rickety table in another.  Water and soapsuds blotched the broken floor, amongst which played two little boys, absolutely naked.  \"That's a woman that tries to keep respectable,\" whispered the thief, with something like a bitter laugh.  \"Hallo, Molly! here's a gen'lem'n as wants to bid 'ee good-night.\"  Molly raised herself, cleared the soapsuds from her thin arms, and turned a haggard but not dissipated face towards her visitor, who was almost choked, not only by the smell of the place, but by an uncontrollable gush of pity.  \"My puir wumin!\" he exclaimed, hastily thrusting his ever-ready hand into his pocket, \"I didna mean t' come in on 'ee unawears.  Hae, ye'll no' objec' to a wheen bawbees?\"  He put all the coppers he possessed into the woman's hand and hurried out of the room.  \"Weel, weel,\" muttered David, as they continued their walk through the miserable region, \"I've gane an' gie'd her a' the siller I had i' my pouch.  Pair thing!  She'll need it, but I've naething left for onybody else!\"  \"It's just as well, for there's nothing left now for any one to steal,\" said his companion.  \"Whar are 'ee gaun noo?\" asked Laidlaw.  The question put was not answered, for his guide, bidding him wait a minute, turned into a doorway and engaged in a low-toned conversation with a man.  Returning to his friend with an air of indecision about him, the thief was on the point of speaking when a small party of men and women--evidently of the better classes--came round the corner and approached.  \"Oho!\" exclaimed the thief, drawing his companion into the shade of the opposite doorway, \"we're in luck.  You see, this is what they call a low lodging-house, and the door-keeper thought that, respectable as you are in dress and looks, it might not be wise to take you in.  But we'll go in now at the tail o' this lot, and nobody will take notice of you. Only follow close to me.\""]]]
