Possibly she was thinking of the absurdity of taking tea at all at such an hour!  \"Well, then, Jeff,\" continued the captain, \"don't you go and judge unfinished work.  Perfect men and women are, in this world, only in process of manufacture.  When you see them finished, you'll be better able to judge of the process.\"  Jeff did not quite agree with his friend; for, gazing at Rose, he could not help feeling that at least one woman had, to his mind, been almost perfectly finished even here!  However, he said nothing.  At this point the conversation was turned by Miss Millet suddenly recalling to mind her brother's generous friend in China.  \"You have no idea, Dick, how much good I have been able to do with that money.  Of course it could not pay for the swimming-bath, or the church, or but here, I have a note of it all.\"  She pulled a soiled red note-book from her pocket and was about to refer to it, when she was arrested by the grave, sad expression that had overspread her brother's countenance.  \"Ah, Molly,\" he said, \"dear Clara Nibsworth was dying when I last saw her, and I fear her father won't survive her long.  You remember, I told you the poor girl was delicate and her father old, and the excitement and exertion of that night of the fire was too much for both of them. When I arrived this time in China, I took a run up to their place to see them, and found Clara almost at the point of death.  I had little time to spare, and meant to have returned the next day; but the poor broken-down father entreated me so earnestly to remain that I at last agreed to spend three days wi' them.  Durin' that time I read the Bible a good deal to the poor girl, and found that she had got her feet firm on the Rock of Ages.  She was very grateful, poor thing, and I never saw one so unselfish.  She had little thought about herself, although dyin' and in great sufferin'.  Her chief anxiety was about her old father, and what he would do when she was gone.  \"It was impossible for me to stay to the end, for no one could guess how long the poor thing would hold out.  I did my best to comfort the father, and then I left, bringing away a kind message to you, my poor Rosebud.  She seems to have loved you dearly, and said you were very kind to her at school.\"  Rose had covered her face with her hands, and with difficulty restrained her tears.  \"But you said the doctors had _some_ hope, father; didn't you?\" she asked.  \"No, darling, the doctors had none--no more had I.  It was her poor father who hoped against hope.  Death was written on her sweet face, and it could not be far off.  I doubt not she is now with the Lord.  When I was leaving, she gave me a small packet for you; but that, with everything else in the _North Star_, has gone to the bottom.  But we must be goin' now,\" continued the captain, rising.  \"I see Jeff is gettin' wearied--an' no wonder.  Besides, it won't do to keep you two up here talkin' till daylight.\"  Jeff protested that he was not weary--that in such company it was impossible for him to tire! but Rose was too much distressed by her father's narrative to observe the compliment.  Still, in spite of his protest, there was something in our hero's manner and look which belied his words; and when he returned to the coastguard station that day, and was about to lie down for much-needed repose, his friend and mate, David Bowers, was surprised to see him turn deadly pale, stagger, and fall on his bed in a state of insensibility.  \"Hallo!  Jeff, what's wrong?\" exclaimed Bowers, starting up, seizing his friend's arm, and giving him a shake, for he was much puzzled.  To see a man knocked into a state of insensibility was nothing new or unfamiliar to Bowers, but to see a powerful young fellow like Jeff go off in a fainting fit like a woman was quite out of his experience.  Jeff, however, remained deaf to his mate's hallo! and when at last a doctor was fetched, it was found that he had been seriously injured; insomuch that the medical man stood amazed when he heard how he had walked several miles and sat up for several hours after his exertions and accident at the wreck.  That medical man, you see, happened to be an old bachelor, and probably did not know what love can accomplish!  \"I very much fear,\" he said to Captain Millet, after inspecting his patient, \"that the poor fellow has received some bad internal injuries. The mast, or whatever it was, must have struck him a tremendous blow, for his side is severely bruised, and two of his ribs are broken.\"  \"Pretty tough ribs to break, too,\" remarked the captain, with a look of profound distress.  \"You are right,\" returned the doctor; \"remarkably tough, but not quite fitted to withstand such a powerful battering-ram as the mainmast of a six-hundred-ton barque.\"  \"Now, doctor, what's to be done with him?  You see, the poor young fellow is not only my friend, but he has saved my life, so I feel bound to look well after him; and this isn't quite the sort o' place to be ill in,\" he added, looking round the somewhat bare apartment, whose walls were adorned with carbines and cutlasses.  \"The wisest thing for him to do is to go into hospital, where he will receive the best of medical treatment and careful nursing.\"  \"Wouldn't the nursing of an old lady that loves him like a mother, and a comfortable cottage, do as well?\"  \"No doubt it would,\" said the doctor, with a smile, \"if he also had proper medical attendance--\"  \"Just so.  Well, that's all settled, then,\" interrupted the captain. \"I'll have him removed at once, and you'll attend him, doctor--who better?--that is, if you can spare the time.\"  The doctor was quite ready to spare the time, and the captain bustled off to tell his sister what was in store for her, and to order Rosebud to pack up and return to school without delay, so as to make room for the patient.  Great was his astonishment that his Rosebud burst into tears on receiving the news.  \"My Bud, my darling, don't cry,\" he said, tenderly drawing the fair head to his rugged bosom.  \"I know it must be a great disappointment to have a week cut off your holidays, but I'll go down to Folkestone with you, an' take a lodging there, an you an' I will have a jolly time of it together--till I get another ship--\"  \"Oh! father, it's not _that_!\" exclaimed poor Rose almost indignantly; \"it's--it's--\"  Not being able to explain exactly what it was that ailed her, she took refuge in another flood of tears.  \"Oh!\" she thought to herself, \"if I might only stay and nurse him!\" but she blushed at the very thought, for she was well aware that she knew no more about scientific nursing than a tortoiseshell cat!  Three months of the most tender and careful nursing by Miss Millet failed, however, to set Jeffrey Benson on his legs.  He was very patient and courageous. Hope was strong, and he listened with approval and gratitude to his nurse's teachings.  There came a day, however, which tried him.  \"You think me not much better, doctor?\" he asked, somewhat anxiously.  \"Not much,\" returned the doctor, in a low, tender tone; \"and I fear that you must make up your mind never again to be quite the same man you were.\"  \"Never again?\" exclaimed the youth, in startled surprise.  The doctor said nothing, but his look was--\"never again.\"    CHAPTER SIX.  GOOD NEWS TO THE CAPTAIN--ALSO TO JEFF.  There is a period, probably, in the life of every man, when a feeling akin to despair creeps over him, and the natural tendency of his heart to rebel against his Maker becomes unquestionable.  There may be some on whom this epoch descends gently--others, perhaps, who may even question whether they have met with it at all; but there must be many, of whom Jeff was one, on whom it comes like a thunderbolt, scathing for a time all the finer qualities of heart and mind.  \"If it had only come at a later period of life, or in some other form, auntie,\" he said one day, as he lay on a sofa at the open window of the cottage, looking out upon the sea; \"but to be bowled over at my age, when the world was all before me, and I was so well able--physically, at least--to fight my way.  It is terrible, and seems so outrageous!  What good can possibly come of rendering a young man helpless--a strong, capable machine, that might do so much good in the world, useless?\"  He spoke in an almost querulous tone, and looked inquiringly in his nurse's face.  It did not occur to the youth, as he looked at her, that the weak-bodied, soft, and gentle creature herself had been, and still was, doing more good to the world than a hundred young men such as he!  Miss Millet's face was a wholesome one to look into.  She did not shake her head and look solemn or shocked.  Neither did she laugh at his petulance.  She merely said, with the sweetest of little smiles, \"You may live, Jeff, to be a very useful machine yet; if not _quite_ as strong as you were--though even that is uncertain, for doctors are fallible, you know.  Never forget that, Jeff--doctors are fallible. Besides, your living at all shows that God has something for you to do for Him.\"  \"Nonsense, auntie.  If that is true of me, it is just as true of hundreds of men who live and die without making the smallest attempt to accomplish any work for God.  Yet He lets them live for many years.\"  \"Quite true,\" returned Miss Millet; \"and God _has_ work for all these men to do, though many of them refuse to do it.  But I feel sure that that won't be your case, Jeff.  He finds work just suited to our capacities--at the time we need it, too, if we are only willing.  Why, in my own very case, has He not sent you to me to be nursed, just as I had finished organising the new night-classes for the usher-boys; and I was puzzled--absolutely puzzled--as to what I should do next and here you step in, requiring my assistance, and giving me full employment.\"  \"That's it--that's it,\" returned Jeff hastily.  \"I am without means, and a burden on you and Captain Millet."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21743"],["title","Jeff Benson, or the Young Coastguardsman (#7)"],["body","  Oh! it is hard--very hard!\"  \"Yes, indeed, it _is_ hard to bear.  Of course that is what you mean, for, as God has done it we cannot suppose anything that He does is really hard.  If your illness had been the result of dissipation, now, or through your own fault, you could not have said exactly it was God's doing; but when it was the result of noble self-sacrifice--\"  \"Come, come, auntie; don't make me more vain than I am.  I'm bad enough as it is, and--and--I'm _very_ weary.\"  The poor youth's head fell back on the pillow, and he sighed deeply as his nurse brought him some strengthening food.  He needed it much, for he was reduced to a mere shadow of his former self.  His fine eyes had become quite awful in their size and solemnity.  His once ruddy cheeks were hollow.  His well-formed nose had become pinched, and his garments hung on, rather than clothed, a huge skeleton.  During all Jeff's illness Captain Millet was unremitting in his attentions, insomuch that a certain careworn expression began to take up its settled abode on his countenance.  But this was not altogether owing to sympathy with his friend, it was partly the consequence of his financial affairs.  Having lost his situation, as he had expected, he found it difficult to procure another, and was under the necessity of living on the small capital which he had accumulated in the course of laborious years.  Had his own subsistence been all his care, he would have had little trouble; but Rose had to be supported and educated, his sister had to be assisted, his charities had to be kept up, and now Jeff Benson had to be maintained, and his doctor paid.  The worst of it all was, that he could not talk on the subject to any of the three, which, to a sympathetic soul, was uncommonly hard--but unavoidable.  \"Yes, quite unavoidable,\" he muttered to himself one evening, when alone in his lodging.  \"They think I'm a rich old fellow, but I daren't say a word.  If I did, Jeff would refuse to eat another bite, an' that would kill him.  If I told Rosebud, it could do no good, and would only make her miserable.  If I told Molly, I--I really don't know what she'd do. She'd founder, I think.  No, I must go on sailin' under false colours. It's a comfort, anyhow, to know that the funds will last some little time yet, even at the present rate of expenditure; but it's perplexin'-- very.\"  He shook his head, wrinkled his brows, and then, rising, took a well-worn pocket-Bible from a shelf, and sought consolation therein.  Some time after that Captain Millet was seated in the same room, about the same hour, meditating on the same subject, with a few additional wrinkles on his brow, when he received a letter.  \"From Hong Kong,\" he muttered, opening it, and putting on his glasses.  The changes in his expressive face as he read were striking, and might have been instructive.  Sadness first--then surprise--then blazing astonishment--then a pursing of the mouth and a prolonged whistle, followed by an expressive slap on the thigh.  Then, crumpling the letter into his pocket he put on his glazed hat, sallied forth, and took the way to his sister's cottage.  At that cottage, about the same time, a great change had taken place in Jeff Benson--spiritually, not physically, though even in the latter respect he was at all events not worse than usual.  Having gone from bad to worse in his rebellion, he had at last reached that lowest depth wherein he not only despaired of the doctor's power to cure him, and his own power of constitution, but began silently, and in his own mind, to charge his Maker with having made a complete failure in his creation.  \"Life is a muddle, auntie, altogether!\" he exclaimed when he reached this point.  It was the lowest ebb--hopeless despair alike of himself and his God.  \"A muddle, Jeff?\" said the little woman, raising her eyebrows slightly. \"How can that be possible in the work of a Perfect Creator, and a Perfect Saviour who redeems from all evil--your supposed `muddle' included?\"  Our young coastguardsman was silent.  It was probably the great turning-point when the Holy Spirit opened his eyes to see Jesus, and all things in relation to Him.  For a long time he did not speak.  The lips of his nurse were also silent, but her heart was not so.  At last Jeff spoke--  \"It _must_ be so.  Perfection is bound to work out perfection.  This apparent evil _must_ be for good.  `He doeth all things well.'  Surely I have read that somewhere!\"  In a low clear voice his nurse said--    \"`He doeth all things well,'   We say it now with tears;   But we shall sing it with those we love   Through bright eternal years.\"  \"I think the light is dawning, auntie.\"  \"I am _sure_ it is, Jeff.\"  Again they were silent, and thus they remained while the natural light faded, until the western sky and sea were dyed in crimson.  The first thing that diverted their thoughts was a quick step outside, then a thunderous knock at the door, and next moment the captain stood before them, beaming with excitement, panting heavily, and quite unable for some minutes to talk coherently.  \"Sister,\" said he at last, \"sit down an' listen.  Jeff, open your ears.\"  He drew a crumpled letter from his pocket, spread it on his knee, put on his glasses, and read as follows:--  \"`My DEAR CAPTAIN MILLET,--  \"`You will, I know, be grieved, though not surprised, to hear that your old friend Nibsworth is dead.  Poor fellow! his end came much as you and I had anticipated when we last parted.  He followed his dear Clara about two months after her death.  I suppose you know that she died three days after you left their house.  \"`My object in writing just now, however, is to convey to you a piece of good news; namely, that Nibsworth has left you the whole of his property, which, altogether, cannot amount to less, I should think, than eighty thousand pounds.'\"  At this point the captain paused and looked over his glasses at his sister, who, with wide-open eyes, exclaimed--  \"Brother! he must be joking!\"  \"Sister,\" returned the captain, \"my friend _never_ jokes, except when in extremely congenial society, and then his jokes are bad--so bad as to be unworthy of repetition.\"  \"Wonderful!\" exclaimed Miss Millet.  \"Singular,\" murmured Jeff, whose thoughts seemed to be engaged with some far-off prospect.  \"He goes on,\" continued the captain, reading: \"`I am left the sole executor of his affairs.  Pray, therefore, write as to what you wish done.  I am not at present conversant with the precise duties of an executor, but of course I will get the best advice possible in the circumstances, and do the best I can.  I would recommend you to do the same at your end of the world, and let me have your instructions as soon as possible.  The enclosed statement will show you the nature of your property.  The greater part, you will observe, is in hard cash.  I may add that the house and grounds here would sell well at present, if you feel inclined to dispose of them.  \"`In conclusion, allow me to congratulate you on this piece of good fortune--perhaps, knowing your character so well, I should have written, this good gift from God.'\"  \"Ay, my friend,\" said the captain, folding the letter, \"you might have written, `this unexpected and undeserved gift from God.'  But now, Molly, what think ye of it all?\"  \"Wonderful!\" exclaimed the good lady in reply; and beyond this word she seemed unable to go for a time, save that, after a strong mental effort, she varied it to \"amazing!\"  Suddenly she seemed to recover, and said with a quick, earnest look--  \"Dick, what are you going to do?\"  \"Do?\" exclaimed Captain Millet, smiting his knee and looking from his sister to Jeff with a broad smile.  \"I'll run up to London, an' take a mansion in the West End, call at Long Acre in passing, and buy a carriage and four.  Then I'll run down to Folkestone an' buy a villa there, or a castle if they have one in stock; if not, I'll order one o' the newest pattern, with gas, water, electricity, and steam laid on. After that I'll buy a steam-yacht and take a trip round the world, so as to calm my brain and think over it.  Of course I'll drop in at Hong Kong, in passing, to have a look at my property; and then--\"  \"Hush, brother! don't run on with such nonsense when we ought to be only filled with serious thoughts.\"  \"How can a man be filled with serious thoughts, Molly, when a sort of Arabian Nights' affair has tumbled on him all of a sudden--took him aback like a white squall, and thrown him on his beam-ends?\"  \"And what a selfish fellow you are, too!\" said Jeff; \"not one word in all you propose to do about anybody except yourself--no mention even of Rosebud.\"  \"Pooh!  Jeff, are you so green as not to know that a wise man never puts his best foot foremost?  Don't you know that it is usual, when a man makes a speech, to keep tumblin' out one point after another--clinkin' 'em all as he goes along--until he comes to the `last but not _least_' point?  If you had let me alone, Molly, I was comin' to Rosebud and yourself too; but as you've been so unmannerly, I'll keep these points till another time.  By the way, when you write to Rosebud, not a word about all this.  It might unsettle the darlin' with her lessons.  An' that reminds me that one o' my first businesses will be to have her supplied wi' the best of teachers--French, Italian, Spanish, German masters--Greek an' Hebrew an' Dutch ones too if the dear child wants 'em--to say nothin' o' dancin' an' drawin' an' calisthenics an' mathematics, an' the use o' the globes, an' conundrums o' that sort.\"  \"Really, brother, if you go on like this, I'll begin to think your good fortune, as you call it, has turned your brain.\"  \"Never fear, Molly, when I come to say what I'm going to do about the little church, an' the night-classes, an' the soup-kitchens, and the model-houses and the swimming-bath, you'll whistle another tune.  But come, Jeff; it's time to ask how you are gettin' along.  You look better, my boy.\"  \"I _am_ "]]]
