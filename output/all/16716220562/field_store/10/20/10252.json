Then she sailed into the great Pacific, and for a time the _Walrus_ sported pleasantly among the coral islands.  During all this time, and amid all these changes, Charlie Brooke, true to his character, was the busiest and most active man on board.  Not that his own special duties gave him much to do, for, until the vessel should reach port, these were rather light; but our hero--as Stride expressed it--\"must always be doing.\"  If he had not work to do he made it--chiefly in the way of assisting other people.  Indeed there was scarcely a man or boy on board who did not have the burden of his toil, whatever it was, lightened in consequence of young Brooke's tendency to put his powerful shoulder voluntarily to the wheel.  He took the daily observations with the captain, and worked out the ship's course during the previous twenty-four hours.  He handled the adze and saw with the carpenter, learned to knot and splice, and to sew canvas with the bo's'n's mate, commented learnedly and interestingly on the preparation of food with the cook, and spun yarns with the men on the forecastle, or listened to the long-winded stories of the captain and officers in the cabin.  He was a splendid listener, being much more anxious to ascertain exactly the opinions of his friends and mates than to advance his own. Of course it followed that Charlie was a favourite.  With his insatiable desire to acquire information of every kind, he had naturally, when at home, learned a little rough-and-tumble surgery, with a slight smattering of medicine.  It was not much, but it proved to be useful as far as it went, and his \"little knowledge\" was not \"dangerous,\" because he modestly refused to go a single step beyond it in the way of practice, unless, indeed, he was urgently pressed to do so by his patients.  In virtue of his attainments, real and supposed, he came to be recognised as the doctor of the ship, for the _Walrus_ carried no medical man.  \"Look here, Brooke,\" said the only passenger on board--a youth of somewhat delicate constitution, who was making the voyage for the sake of his health,--\"I've got horrible toothache.  D'you think you can do anything for me?\"  \"Let's have a look at it,\" said Charlie, with kindly interest, though he felt half inclined to smile at the intensely lugubrious expression of the youth's face.  \"Why, Raywood, that is indeed a bad tooth; nothing that I know of will improve it.  There's a cavern in it big and black enough to call to remembrance the Black Hole of Calcutta!  A red-hot wire might destroy the nerve, but I never saw one used, and should not like to try it.\"  \"Horrible!\" exclaimed Raywood.  \"I've been mad with pain all the morning, and can't afford to be driven madder.  Perhaps, somewhere or other in the ship there may be a--a--thingumy.\"  \"A whatumy?\" inquired the other.  \"A key, or--or--pincers,\" groaned Raywood, \"for extracting--oh! man, couldn't you pull it out?\"  \"Easily,\" said Charlie, with a smile.  \"I've got a pair of forceps-- always carry them in case of need, but never use them unless the patient is very bad, and _must_ have it out.\"  Poor Raywood protested, with another groan, that his was a case in point, and it _must_ come out; so Charlie sought for and found his forceps.  \"It won't take long, I suppose?\" said the patient rather nervously, as he opened his mouth.  \"Oh no.  Only a moment or--\"  A fearful yell, followed by a gasp, announced to the whole ship's company that a crisis of some sort had been passed by some one, and the expert though amateur dentist congratulated his patient on his deliverance from the enemy.  Only three of the ship's company, however, had witnessed the operation. One was Dick Darvall, the seaman who chanced to be steering at the time, and who could see through the open skylight what was being enacted in the cabin.  Another was the captain, who stood beside him.  The third was the cabin-boy, Will Ward, who chanced to be cleaning some brasses about the skylight at the time, and was transfixed by what we may style delightfully horrible sensations.  These three watched the proceedings with profound interest, some sympathy, and not a little amusement.  \"Mind your helm, Darvall,\" said the Captain, stifling a laugh as the yell referred to burst on his ears.  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" responded the seaman, bringing his mind back to his duty, as he bestowed a wink on the brass-polishing cabin-boy.  \"He's up to everything,\" said Darvall in a low voice, referring to our hero.  \"From pitch-and-toss to manslaughter,\" responded the boy, with a broad grin.  \"I do believe, Mr Brooke, that you can turn your hand to anything,\" said Captain Stride, as Charlie came on deck a few minutes later.  \"Did you ever study doctoring or surgery?\"  \"Not regularly,\" answered Charlie; \"but occasionally I've had the chance of visiting hospitals and dissecting-rooms, besides hearing lectures on anatomy, and I have taken advantage of my opportunities.  Besides, I'm fond of mechanics; and tooth-drawing is somewhat mechanical.  Of course I make no pretension to a knowledge of regular dentistry, which involves, I believe, a scientific and prolonged education.\"  \"May be so, Mr Brooke,\" returned the captain, \"but your knowledge seems deep and extensive enough to me, for, except in the matter o' navigation, I haven't myself had much schoolin', but I do like to see a fellow that can use his hands.  As I said to my missus, not two days before I left 'er: `Maggie,' says I, `a man that can't turn his hands to anything ain't worth his salt.  For why?  He's useless at sea, an', by consequence, can't be of much value on land.'\"  \"Your reasoning is unanswerable,\" returned Charlie, with a laugh.  \"Not so sure o' that,\" rejoined the captain, with a modestly dubious shake of his head; \"leastwise, however unanswerable it may be, my missus always manages to answer it--somehow.\"  At that moment one of the sailors came aft to relieve the man-at-the-wheel.  Dick Darvall was a grave, tall, dark, and handsome man of about five-and-twenty, with a huge black beard, as fine a seaman as one could wish to see standing at a ship's helm, but he limped when he left his post and went forward.  \"How's the leg to-day, Darvall!\" asked young Brooke, as the man passed.  \"Better, sir, thankee.\"  \"That's well.  I'll change the dressing in half-an-hour.  Don't disturb it till I come.\"  \"Thankee, sir, I won't.\"  \"Now then, Raywood,\" said Charlie, descending to the cabin, where his patient was already busy reading Maury's _Physical Geography of the Sea_, \"let's have a look at the gum.\"  \"Oh, it's all right,\" said Raywood.  \"D'you know, I think one of the uses of severe pain is to make one inexpressibly thankful for the mere absence of it.  Of course there is a little sensation of pain left, which might make me growl at other times, but that positively feels comfortable now by contrast!\"  \"There is profound sagacity in your observations,\" returned Charlie, as he gave the gum a squeeze that for a moment or two removed the comfort; \"there, now, don't suck it, else you'll renew the bleeding.  Keep your mouth shut.\"  With this caution the amateur dentist left the cabin, and proceeded to the fore-part of the vessel.  In passing the steward's pantry a youthful voice arrested him.  \"Oh, please, sir,\" said Will Ward, the cabin-boy, advancing with a slate in his hand, \"I _can't_ make out the sum you set me yesterday, an' I'm quite sure I've tried and tried as hard as ever I could to understand it.\"  \"Let me see,\" said his friend, taking the slate and sitting down on a locker.  \"Have you read over the rule carefully?\"  \"Yes, sir, I have, a dozen times at least, but it won't come right,\" answered the boy, with wrinkles enough on his young brow to indicate the very depths of puzzlement.  \"Fetch the book, Will, and let's examine it.\"  The book was brought, and at his teacher's request the boy read:--  \"Add the interest to the principal, and then multiply by--\"  \"Multiply?\" said Charlie, interrupting.  \"Look!\"  He pointed to the sum on the slate, and repeated \"multiply.\"  \"Oh!\" exclaimed the cabin-boy, with a gasp of relief and wide-open eyes, \"I've _divided_!\"  \"That's so, Will, and there's a considerable difference between division and multiplication, as you'll find all through life,\" remarked the teacher, with a peculiar lift of his eyebrows, as he handed back the slate and went on his way.  More than once in his progress \"for'ard\" he was arrested by men who wished hint to give advice, or clear up difficulties in reference to subjects which his encouragement or example had induced them to take up, and to these claims on his attention or assistance he accorded such a ready and cheerful response that his pupils felt it to be a positive pleasure to appeal to him, though they each professed to regret giving him \"trouble.\"  The boatswain, who was an amiable though gruff man in his way, expressed pretty well the feelings of the ship's company towards our hero when he said: \"I tell you, mates, I'd sooner be rubbed up the wrong way, an' kicked down the fore hatch by Mr Brooke, than I'd be smoothed or buttered by anybody else.\"  At last the fo'c'sl was reached, and there our surgeon found his patient, Dick Darvall, awaiting him.  The stout seaman's leg had been severely bruised by a block which had fallen from aloft and struck it during one of the recent gales.  \"A good deal better to-day,\" said Charlie.  \"Does it pain you much?\"  \"Not nearly as much as it did yesterday, sir.  It's my opinion that I'll be all right in a day or two.  Seems to me outrageous to make so much ado about it.\"  \"If we didn't take care of it, my man, it might cost you your limb, and we can't afford to bury such a well-made member before its time!  You must give it perfect rest for a day or two.  I'll speak to the captain about it.\"  \"I'd rather you didn't, sir,\" objected the seaman.  \"I feel able enough to go about, and my mates'll think I'm shirkin' dooty.\"  \"There's not a man a-board"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],["title","The Coral Island (#0)"],["body","CORAL ISLAND, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  BEGINNING--MY EARLY LIFE AND CHARACTER--I THIRST FOR ADVENTURE IN FOREIGN LANDS, AND GO TO SEA.  Roving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the joy of my heart, the very sunshine of my existence.  In childhood, in boyhood, and in man's estate I have been a rover; not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic rover throughout the length and breadth of the wide, wide world.  It was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night on which I was born on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic Ocean.  My father was a sea-captain; my grandfather was a sea-captain; my great-grandfather had been a marine.  Nobody could tell positively what occupation _his_ father had followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother's side, had been an admiral in the Royal Navy.  At any rate, we knew that as far back as our family could be traced, it had been intimately connected with the great watery waste.  Indeed, this was the case on both sides of the house; for my mother always went to sea with my father on his long voyages, and so spent the greater part of her life upon the water.  Thus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving disposition. Soon after I was born, my father, being old, retired from a seafaring life, purchased a small cottage in a fishing village on the west coast of England, and settled down to spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had for so many years been his home.  It was not long after this that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within me.  For some time past my infant legs had been gaining strength, so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin off my chubby knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to stand up and walk like a man--all of which attempts, however, resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden surprise.  One day I took advantage of my dear mother's absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father's cottage door.  Ah, how vividly I remember the horror of my poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little body! From this time forth my rambles became more frequent and, as I grew older, more distant, until at last I had wandered far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble dwelling, and did not rest content until my father bound me apprentice to a coasting-vessel and let me go to sea.  For some years I was happy in visiting the seaports, and in coasting along the shores, of my native land.  My Christian name was Ralph; and my comrades added to this the name of Rover, in consequence of the passion which I always evinced for travelling.  Rover was not my real name; but as I never received any other, I came at last to answer to it as naturally as to my proper name.  And as it is not a bad one, I see no good reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph Rover.  My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and they and I got on very well together.  They did, indeed, very frequently make game of and banter me, but not unkindly; and I overheard them sometimes saying that Ralph Rover was a \"queer, old-fashioned fellow.\"  This, I must confess, surprised me much; and I pondered the saying long, but could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my old-fashionedness lay.  It is true I was a quiet lad, and seldom spoke except when spoken to.  Moreover, I never could understand the jokes of my companions even when they were explained to me, which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much grief.  However, I tried to make up for it by smiling and looking pleased when I observed that they were laughing at some witticism which I had failed to detect.  I was also very fond of inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and often fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my mind.  But in all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be exceedingly natural, and could by no means understand why my comrades should call me \"an old-fashioned fellow.\"  Now, while engaged in the coasting trade I fell in with many seamen who had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; and I freely confess that my heart glowed ardently within me as they recounted their wild adventures in foreign lands--the dreadful storms they had weathered, the appalling dangers they had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had seen both on the land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and strange people they had visited.  But of all the places of which they told me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the Coral Islands of the Southern Seas.  They told me of thousands of beautiful, fertile islands that had been formed by a small creature called the coral insect, where summer reigned nearly all the year round, where the trees were laden with a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit, where the climate was almost perpetually delightful; yet where, strange to say, men were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those favoured isles to which the Gospel of our Saviour had been conveyed.  These exciting accounts had so great an effect upon my mind that, when I reached the age of fifteen, I resolved to make a voyage to the South Seas.  I had no little difficulty, at first, in prevailing on my dear parents to let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would never have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting trade, he saw the truth of what I said and gave his consent.  My dear mother, seeing that my father had made up his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes.  \"But, oh Ralph!\" she said on the day I bade her adieu, \"come back soon to us, my dear boy; for we are getting old now, Ralph, and may not have many years to live.\"  I will not take up my readers' time with a minute account of all that occurred before I took my final leave of my dear parents.  Suffice it to say that my father placed me under the charge of an old messmate of his own, a merchant captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South Seas in his own ship, the _Arrow_.  My mother gave me her blessing and a small Bible; and her last request was that I would never forget to read a chapter every day and say my prayers, which I promised, with tears in my eyes, that I would certainly do.  Soon afterwards I went on board the _Arrow_, which was a fine, large ship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific Ocean.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE DEPARTURE--THE SEA--MY COMPANIONS--SOME ACCOUNT OF THE WONDERFUL SIGHTS WE SAW ON THE GREAT DEEP--A DREADFUL STORM AND A FRIGHTFUL WRECK.  It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvas to the breeze and sailed for the regions of the south.  Oh, how my heart bounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!  The captain shouted; the men ran to obey; the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and the shore gradually faded from my view; while I stood looking on, with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.  The first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on deck and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever and would require its services no more.  \"There, lass!\" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was completed--\"there, lass, take a good nap now, for we sha'n't ask you to kiss the mud again for many a long day to come!\"  And so it was.  That anchor did not \"kiss the mud\" for many long days afterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!  There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special favourites.  Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.  He had had a good education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild and quiet in disposition.  Jack was a general favourite, and had a peculiar fondness for me.  My other companion was Peterkin Gay.  He was little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years old.  But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could not have been so much beloved as he was.  \"Hallo, youngster!\" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder the day I joined the ship, \"come below and I'll show you your berth. You and I are to be messmates; and I think we shall be good friends, for I like the look o' you.\"  Jack was right.  He and I, and Peterkin afterwards, became the best and staunchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.  I shall say little about the first part of our voyage.  We had the usual amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling in the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of flying-fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot above the surface.  They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them; and one flying-fish, in its terror, flew over the ship, struck on the rigging, and fell upon the deck.  Its wings were just fins elongated; and we found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted into the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.  Jack and I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.  When we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of America, the weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.  \"Cape Horn,\""]]]
