Whether the reasoning of Macnab had much influence at that time could not be ascertained, for he was yet in the middle of one of his most graphic anecdotes when the Indian's owlish eyes shut with a suddenness that was quite startling, and he roused himself just in time to prevent his chin from dropping on his chest.  \"Waugh!\" he exclaimed with a slightly-confused look.  \"Just so,\" replied Macnab with a laugh, \"and now, boy, we'll turn in, for it strikes me we're going to have warmish weather, and if so, we shall have to make the most of our time.\"  Soon the blankets were spread; the fire was replenished with mighty logs; the travellers lay down side by side and in a few minutes snored in concert; the flames leaped upwards, and the sparks, entangling themselves on the snow-encrusted branches of bush and tree, gleamed there for an instant, or, escaping, flew gaily away into the wintry sky.  While the two men were sleeping, a change came over the scene--a slow, gentle, scarce perceptible change, which, however, had a powerful influence on the prospects of the sleepers.  The sky became overcast; the temperature, which had been down at arctic depth for many months, suddenly rose to that of temperate climes, and snow began to fall--not in the small sharp particles to which the fur-traders of the great northern wilderness are accustomed, but in the broad, heavy flakes that one often sees in England.  Softly, silently, gently they fell, like the descent of a sweet influence--but steadily, persistently, continuously, until every object in nature became smothered in the soft white garment. Among other objects the two sleepers were buried.  The snow began by powdering them over.  Had any one been there to observe the process, he would have seen by the bright light of the camp-fire that the green blankets in which they were wrapt became piebald first; then assumed a greyish-green colour, which speedily changed into a greenish-grey, and finally into a pure white.  The two sleepers might thus have represented those figures in chiselled marble on the tombs of crusaders, had it not been that they lay doubled up, for warmth--perhaps also for comfort--with their knees at their chins, instead of flat on their backs with their hands pressed together.  By degrees the correct outline of their forms became an incorrect outline, and gradually more and more rotund--suggesting the idea that the buried ones were fat.  As the night wore on the snow accumulated on them until it lay several inches deep.  Still they moved not.  Strong, tired and healthy men are not easily moved.  The fire of course sank by degrees until it reached that point where it failed to melt the snow; then it was quickly smothered out and covered over.  The entire camp was also buried; the tin kettle being capped with a knob peculiarly its own, and the snow-shoes and other implements having each their appropriate outline, while some hundredweights, if not tons, of the white drapery gathered on the branches overhead.  It was altogether an overwhelming state of things, and the only evidence of life in all the scene was the little hole in front of each slumberer's nose, out of which issued intermittent pufflets of white vapour.  So the night passed by and the morning dawned, and the wintry sun arose like a red-hot cannon ball.  Then Macnab awoke with a start and sat up with an effort.  \"Hallo!\" was his first exclamation, as he tried to clear his eyes, then he muttered something in Gaelic which, being incomprehensible, I cannot translate, although the worthy man has many a time, since the day of which I write, tried to explain it to me!  It may have been his action, or it may have been indignant northern fairies, I know not, but certain it is that the Gaelic was instantly followed by an avalanche of snow from the branch over the Highlander's head, which knocked him down and reburied him.  It also knocked Big Otter up and drew forth the inevitable \"Waugh!\"  \"Humph!\" said Macnab, on clearing himself a second time, \"I was half afraid of this.  We've got our work cut out for us.\"  The Indian replied not, but proceeded to light the fire and prepare breakfast, while his companion cleared the camp of some of its snow. The wolfish dogs took a lively interest in these proceedings, but lent no assistance beyond wagging their tails, either in approval or in anticipation of breakfast.  Of course breakfast was a repetition of the previous supper, and was soon disposed of both by men and dogs.  Then the latter were harnessed to their sledge, the snow-shoes were put on, and the journey was resumed--Macnab manfully leading the way.  And let not the reader imagine that this leadership involved little or no manhood.  Northern snow-shoes are about five feet long, and twelve or fifteen inches broad.  The netting with which the frames are filled up-- somewhat like the bottom of a cane chair--allows fine well-frozen snow to fall through it like dust and the traveller, sinking it may be only a few inches in old well-settled-down snow, progresses with ease.  But when a heavy fall such as I have described takes place, especially in spring, and the weather grows comparatively warm, the traveller's circumstances change greatly for the worse.  The new snow being light permits him to sink deep into it--perhaps eight or ten inches--at every step; being also soft, that which falls upon the shoes cannot pass through the netting, but sticks there, giving him many extra pounds weight to lift as he goes heavily along.  Add to this that his thick winter garb becomes oppressive in mild weather, and you will perceive that Macnab's duties as beater of the track were severe.  At first their progress was very slow, for it was through the thick woods, where fallen trees and bushes obstructed them as well as deep snow, but towards noon they came out on a more open country--in summer a swamp; at that time a frozen plain--and the travelling improved, for a slight breeze had already begun to make an impression on the new snow in exposed places.  \"Now, Big Otter,\" said Macnab, coming to a halt, \"we'll have some grub here, and then you will take a turn in front.\"  The Indian was ready for anything.  So were the dogs--especially for \"grub.\"  Indeed it was obvious that they understood the meaning of that word, for when Macnab uttered it they wagged their tails and cocked their ears.  It was a cold dinner, if I may describe the meal by that name.  The work was too hard, and the daylight in which to do it too brief, to admit of needless delay.  A frozen bird thrown to each of the dogs, and a junk of equally frozen pemmican cut out of the bag with a hatchet for the travellers, formed the repast.  The latter ate it sitting on a snow-wreath.  They, however, had the advantage of their canine friends in the matter of hard biscuits, of which they each consumed two as a sort of cold pudding.  Then they resumed the march and plodded heavily on till near sunset, when they again selected a suitable spot in the woods, cleared away the snow, and encamped as before.  \"It's hard work,\" exclaimed Macnab with a Celtic sigh, as he sipped his tea that night in the mellow light of the log fire.  \"Waugh!  Big Otter has seen harder work,\" returned the Indian.  \"No doubt ye have, an' so have I,\" returned Macnab; \"I mind, once, when away on a snow-shoe trip on the St. Lawrence gulf, bein' caught by a regular thaw when the snow turned into slush, an' liftin' the snow-shoes was like to tear one's legs out o' their sockets, not to mention the skinning of your toes wi' the snow-shoe lines, an' the wet turning your moccasins into something like tripe.  Yes, it might be worse, as you say.  Now, boy, I'll turn in.\"  The next day travelling was no better, and on the next again it became worse, for although the temperature was still below the freezing point, snow continued to fall all day as well as all night, so that our travellers and their dogs became like animated snowballs, and beating the track became an exhausting labour.  But difficulties cannot finally stop, though they may retard, a \"Nor'-wester.\"  On the sixth day, however, they met with a foe who had power to lay a temporary check on their advance.  On the night of the fifth day out, another change of temperature took place.  A thermometer, had they carried one, would probably have registered from ten to twenty below zero of Fahrenheit.  This, however, was so familiar to them that they rather liked the change, and heaped up fresh logs on the roaring fire to counteract the cold; but when a breeze sprang up and began to blow hard, they did not enjoy it so much, and when the breeze increased to a gale, it became serious; for one cannot face intense cold during a gale without the risk of being frost-bitten.  In the shelter of the woods it was all right, but when, towards noon, they came out on an extended plain where the wild winds were whirling the wilder snow in blinding drifts, they halted and looked inquiringly at each other.  \"Shall we try it?\" asked Macnab.  The Indian shook his head and looked solemn.  \"It's a pity to give in without--\"  A snow-drift caught the Highlander full in the mouth and literally shut him up!  The effect was not to subdue, but to arouse.  \"Yes,\" he said in a species of calm ferocity, when the gale allowed him the power of utterance, \"we'll go on.\"  He went on, followed by the obedient native and the unhappy dogs, but he had not taken half a dozen steps when he tripped over a concealed rock and broke a snow-shoe.  To walk with a broken snow-shoe is impossible. To repair one is somewhat difficult and takes time.  They were compelled, therefore, to re-enter the sheltering woods and encamp.  \"You're better at mending than I am,\" said Macnab to the Indian.  \"Set to work on the shoe when the camp is dug out, an' I'll go cut some firewood.\"  Cutting firewood is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21718"],["title","The Big Otter (#7)"],["body"," only laborious, but attended with danger, and that day ill-fortune seemed to have beset the Highlander; for he had barely cut half a dozen logs, when his axe glanced off a knot and struck deep into the calf of his left leg.  A shout brought Big Otter to his side.  The Indian was well used to such accidents.  He bound up the wound securely, and carried his comrade into camp on his back.  But now Macnab was helpless.  He not only could not walk, but there was no hope of his being able to do so for weeks to come.  \"Lucky for us we brought the dogs,\" he remarked when the operation was completed.  \"Waugh!\" exclaimed the Indian by way of assent, while he busied himself in preparing food.  It was indeed lucky, for if they had dragged the provision-sled themselves, as Macnab had once thought of doing, it would have fallen to Big Otter's lot to haul his comrade during the remainder of the journey. As it was, the dogs did it, and in the doing of it, despite the red-man's anxious and constant care, many a severe shake, and bump, and capsize in the snow did the unfortunate man receive before that journey came to a close.  He bore it all, however, with the quiet stoicism characteristic of the race from which he sprang.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE WOUNDED MAN.  It is needful now to return to Fort Dunregan.  The long winter is not yet past, but there are symptoms, as I have said, that it is coming to a close.  Snow and ice are still indeed the prevailing characteristic of the region, but the air is no longer intensely cold.  On the contrary, a genial warmth prevails, inducing the inhabitants to discard flannel-lined leathern capotes and fur caps for lighter garments.  There is a honeycombed look about the snow-drifts, which gives them an aged appearance; and, above all, there is an occasional dropping of water--yes, actual water--from the points of huge icicles!  This is such an ancient memory that we can scarce believe our senses.  We sniff, too, as we walk about; for there are scents in the air--old familiar smells of earth and vegetation--which we had begun to fancy we had almost forgotten.  The excitement caused by the arrival of the winter packet had also by that time passed almost out of memory, and we had sunk back into that calm state of patient waiting which may probably be familiar to the convict who knows that some months of monotonous existence still lie before him; for, not until the snow and ice should completely clear away and the summer be pretty well advanced could we hope for the blessed sight of a new face and the cheering sound of a fresh human voice.  Of course we had the agreeable prospect of hearing ere long the voices of wild-fowl in their noisy northern flight, but such a prospect was not sufficient to satisfy poor secluded humanity.  \"Oh that I were a bird!\" exclaimed Spooner, one morning as we were seated round the Carron stove in our hall.  \"No need to wish that,\" said Lumley, \"for you're a goose already!\"  \"Well, I'd even consent to be a real goose,\" continued Spooner, \"if I could only thereby use my wings to fly away over the snowy wilderness and alight in my old home.\"  \"What a surprise you'd give them if you did!\" said Lumley, \"especially if you came down with your ruffled feathers as clumsily as you tumbled into the saw-pit the other day when--\"  He stopped, for at that moment I said \"Hush!\" and held up a finger.  \"Sleigh-bells!\" exclaimed Spooner, with a catch of his breath.  \"Nothing new in that,\" said Lumley: \"we hear them every day.\"  \"Nothing new,\" I retorted, \"to your unmusical ear, but these bells are not _our_ bells--listen!\"  I started up as I spoke, flung open the outer door, and we all listened intently.  Clear and pleasant they rang, like the music of a sweet new song.  We all gave a shout, clapped on our caps, and ran out to the fort gate. There an almost new sensation thrilled us, for we beheld a team of dogs coming up weary and worn out of the wilderness, preceded by a gaunt yet majestic Indian, whose whole aspect--haggard expression of countenance, soiled and somewhat tattered garments, and weary gait--betokened severe exhaustion.  On the sled, drawn by four lanky dogs, we could see the figure of a man wrapped in blankets and strapped to the conveyance.  \"Who _can_ it be?\" exclaimed Lumley, as he hastened out to meet the new arrivals.  \"A sick man from somewhere,\" suggested Spooner.  \"Perhaps the governor,\" said I, \"on an unexpected tour of inspection.\"  As we drew near we could see that the recumbent figure waved a hand and cheered.  \"Macnab,\" said I, as the familiar voice struck my ear.  \"Ill--dying!\" gasped the anxious Spooner.  \"No dying man ever cheered like that!\" cried Lumley, \"except a hero of romance in the hour of death and victory!\"  A few seconds more and the matter was put at rest, while we warmly shook the hearty and genial Highlander by both hands.  \"Help me out, boys,\" he said; \"I'm tired o' this sled, and think I can do the little remaining bit o' the journey on foot with your help.\"  We disentangled him from the sledge and set him on his feet.  \"Hold on, Lumley,\" he said, with a smile on his haggard and unshaven face, \"I want to embrace you, like the Frenchmen.  There--my arm round your neck--so.  Now, Max, I want to embrace you likewise wi' the other arm.  I've grown awful affectionate in my old age.  You are rather short, Max, for a good crutch, but you're better than nothing.  You see, I've only got one good leg.\"  \"But what has happened to the other--when, how, and where?\" we exclaimed in chorus.  Macnab answered the questions to our chief, who came forward at the moment with welcome in his visage and extended hands.  \"It's only a cut, sir, stupidly done with my own hatchet when we had been but a few days out.  But rest will soon put me to rights.  My poor man, Big Otter, is more to be pitied than I.  But for him I should have perished in the snow.\"  \"What cheer? what cheer?\" said our chief, grasping the Indian's hand on hearing this.  \"What cheer?\" we all exclaimed, following his example.  \"Watchee! watchee!\" echoed Big Otter, returning the hearty salutation as well as his tongue could manage it, and giving us each a powerful squeeze with his huge bony hand, which temporary exhaustion had not appreciably reduced in strength.  The native was obviously a sociable, well-disposed man, for his eyes glittered and his white teeth gleamed and his bronzed visage shone with pleasure when Macnab explained the cause of our sudden burst of affection for him.  Thus chatting and limping we got the Highlander slowly up to the hall, set him down in our only armchair--a wooden one without stuffing--and fetched him a basin of hot soup, that being a liquid which our cook had always more or less frequently on hand.  \"Ha! boys!\" cried Macnab, smacking his lips, \"that's the thing to put life into a man!  I've not had anything like it for many a day.  You see, we had a small misfortune soon after my accident, which cost us our kettle, and rendered soup or tea impossible.\"  \"How was that?\" inquired our chief, sitting down, while we gathered round the stove to listen.  \"Well, you see, sir, not long after my accident, there came a sharp frost which made the surface of the snow hard after the thaw, so the dogs could run on the top of the crust without breaking it, but Big Otter, bein' heavy, broke through--by the way, I hope he's bein' looked after.\"  \"You may be sure of that,\" said Spooner.  \"I saw him safely placed in the men's house, and Salamander, who, it turns out, is a sort of relation of his, set to work to stuff him with the same sort of soup you think so much of.  I only hope they've enough to keep him going, for before I left the house he had drunk off two bowls of it almost without taking breath, though it was scalding hot.\"  \"Good.  He'll do it ample justice,\" returned Macnab, taking another pull at his own bowl.  \"I hope you're well provisioned, for Big Otter's an awful consumer of victuals.  Well, as I was saying, the surface of the snow got frozen thinly, and the work o' tramping after the sled and holding on to the tail-line was uncommonly hard, as I could see, for I lay with my head to the front, looping back on the poor man.  But it was on the exposed places and going down the slopes that the greatest difficulty lay, for there the dogs were keen to run away.  Once or twice they did fairly get off, and gave me some rough as well as long runs before my man could catch them up.  At last we came one afternoon to an open plain where the snow had felt the thaw and been frozen again pretty hard.  The moment we got on it away went the dogs.  Big Otter tried to run, but one of his shoes went through the crust and the other didn't, so down he came, and had to let go the line.  I felt easy enough at first, for the plain was level, but after a time it became lumpy, and I got some ugly bumps.  `Never mind,' thought I, `they'll be sure to come to some bushes, and that'll pull them up.'  Just as I thought so, we came to a slope, and the team went slap over a bank.  The sled and I threw a complete somersault.  Fortunately we came down on the dogs, which broke our fall, though it half killed them!  \"When Big Otter came and turned me right side up, I found that I had sustained no damage whatever, but, woe's me! our tin kettle was almost knocked flat.  The worst of it was that in trying to put it right we drove a big hole in the bottom of it, so we had to bid farewell to hot food, except what we roasted.  We could also melt snow by plastering up the hole so as to get enough to drink, but boiling water was quite out of the question.\"  \"Well, Macnab,\" said our chief, rising, \"since you have got the soup over at last, come along with me and let's hear about your Indian friend's proposals.\"  We assisted our visitor into the mess-room, which was also our principal council-chamber, and there left him to talk business with Mr Strang while we returned to Bachelors' Hall to let off our"]]]
