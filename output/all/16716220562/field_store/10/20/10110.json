Ask.\"  \"Let me go to-night.\"  \"What's the use? One officer is enough, and you could not do any good by going along. I should be in command--\"  \"Let me go in your place!\"  \"Nonsense! It's almost certain death.\"  \"I don't care. It's my chance. I can run the thing as well as you.\"  \"Oh, anybody can run the thing, for that matter.\"  \"My life is of no more value to the South or to me than yours. Come! You have had your chances, and improved them; give this to me.\"  Lacy hesitated.  \"Sempland, you're a fool, as I said before. You're running away from the woman who loves you. You're risking your life.\"  \"Never mind about that,\" returned the other. \"She doesn't love me, and I want to do it. For God's sake, old man, don't be selfish! Let me have an opportunity!\"  Sempland was ordinarily a reticent and a quiet man, but this possibility awoke him into action. He pleaded so long and so hard, and so determinedly that he overbore the other man, and finally wrung from him a grudging assent to his request.  \"If the general is willing, I'll give you my chance.\"  \"Thank you. God bless you! If I don't come back, remember that you're to make a man of yourself--for her.\"  \"You will come back. You must come back!\"     CHAPTER IV  OPPORTUNITIES EMBRACED   \"General Beauregard,\" said Lacy, as the two young officers were ushered into the general's office, \"I have a most unusual request to make of you, sir.\"  \"What is it, Major Lacy?\" returned the little general.  \"I want you to relieve me of the duty of taking out the _David_ to-night, sir.\"  \"What!\"  \"I want you to give it to Mr. Sempland here.\"  \"You wish to avoid the danger?\" queried Beauregard, gazing intently at Lacy.  \"He does it as a favor to me, General,\" interrupted Sempland. \"He has had his chance, and I have had none. I begged and implored him to allow me to go, and only wrung a most reluctant consent from him.\"  The general turned his head away, his fingers tapped softly on the desk.  \"Things have not gone as we wished,\" he murmured half to himself, \"the South is hard pushed, indeed. The war has dragged on. It becomes harder and harder, but we may not despair for our beloved country when her sons strive for posts of danger and are emulous to die in her service. Do you know what this means, Mr. Sempland?\"  \"What it means, General?\"  \"There is about one chance in a thousand of your coming back. Every time that infernal submarine has been used she has done no damage to the enemy and has drowned her crew. Payne was drowned in her with eight men when she was first sent out. She was swamped by the wash of a passing steamer on her next trial, and all hands were lost. Then she sank at Fort Sumter wharf, carrying down six of her men. Hundley took her into the Stono River and made a dive with her, hit mud, stuck there, and every soul was suffocated. They raised her and fixed her up again and tried her once more in the harbor here. She worked beautifully for a while, but fouled the cable of the receiving ship trying to pass under her keel, and stayed there. She has just been raised, the dead cleared out of her, now you want to go on her again.\"  \"I do, sir,\" returned Sempland.  \"Is life worth so little to you that you are willing to sacrifice it?\"  \"There is Lacy, sir.\"  \"Oh, he is different!\" burst out the general, and then bit his lip. \"It would be greatly to Lacy's credit,\" had flashed into his mind, \"if he could manage to die in some such heroic action.\"  Lacy and Sempland knew what the general thought, and Sempland could think of no words to bridge over the pause.  \"You see,\" at last said Lacy, smiling satirically at Sempland, \"the general understands. You would better let me go.\"  \"No. The thing sometimes works. Glassell got out alive when he tried to blow up the _New Ironsides_, and anyway, I want this chance. I have had four years of war and have spent three of it in prison. For God's sake, General--\"  \"Very well. You shall have it,\" answered Beauregard, \"but I will not have the boat used as a submarine. You can sink her until her hatch is awash, but no lower.\"  \"Thank you,\" answered the delighted Sempland; \"where shall I get a crew?\"  \"One has already been selected from among hundreds who volunteered. Five seamen are to attend to the propeller and an artillery officer to look after the torpedo. You can steer the boat?\"  \"I lived on the water before I entered the army.\"  \"All right. The _Wabash_ is lying off the Main Ship Channel. I have no instructions to give you except to go at her and sink her. I am told the most vulnerable spot of a ship is just forward of the mainmast. Hit her there. Don't explode your torpedo until you are in actual contact if possible. Glassell's went off the moment he saw her without touching, else he would have sunk the _New Ironsides_. You will find the torpedo boat at the government wharf. Everything is ready. You will leave at seven. The three blockade-runners will follow you as close as is practicable, and when you torpedo the frigate they will dart through the Swash and try to get to sea. I reckon upon the other Yankee ships running down to aid the _Wabash_. I'll see you on the wharf. God bless you, and may He have mercy on your souls!\" said the little general, solemnly.  He put out his hand to the young man, and Sempland shook it vigorously.  \"I pray that I may succeed for the sake of the South, sir,\" returned the young man, firmly.  \"For the sake of the South, gentlemen. That is our watchword,\" cried Beauregard, standing up and bringing his hand to a salute.  \"Have you any preparations to make, Sempland?\" asked Lacy, when they left the office.  \"I have a letter to write.\"  \"Very well. I will look after the boat and will meet you on the wharf. Shall you see Miss Glen before you go?\"  \"No.\"  \"You must.\"  \"I cannot. What difference does it make to her, anyway? I will be at the wharf\"--he looked at his watch, it was already six o'clock--\"in three-quarters of an hour. Good-by.\"  The two men shook hands and separated.  \"The boat is ready,\" said Lacy to himself. \"I saw to that this afternoon. There is nothing for me to do there. I wonder--by Jove, I'll do it!\"  A few minutes after he was ushered again into the presence of Miss Fanny Glen. She had at first pleaded indisposition, but he had insisted upon seeing her.  \"I have something of so much importance to tell you, Miss Glen,\" he began, as she entered the room, \"that I was forced to override your desires.\"  \"Is it about the subject that we--I--talked about this afternoon? If so--\"  \"It is not. I shall say no more on that score. I had my answer then.\"  \"I am very sorry,\" continued the girl. \"I admire you, respect you, but--but--I do not--\"  \"I understand. Never mind that. You said that Sempland had never done anything to distinguish himself. Well, he's going to do it to-night.\"  \"What is he going to do?\" asked the girl, all the listlessness instantly going out of her manner.  \"He is going to take out the _David_.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"And blow up the _Wabash_.\"  Her hand went to her heart. Her face turned whiter than the frock she wore.  \"My God!\" she whispered, \"Admiral Vernon's ship!\"  \"She loves him! She loves him!\" flashed into Lacy's mind, and for the moment he suffered agonies of jealous pain.  \"But,\" continued the girl, \"why should they--\"  \"In the first place,\" went on Lacy, \"if the venture succeeds, we sink a noble ship and put out of the way a most determined enemy, and we hope to let the blockaded cotton ships get to sea.\"  \"But the _David_!\" said the girl, who knew the sinister story of the crazy submarine torpedo boat as did every one in Charleston. \"It is sure death!\"  \"It is dangerous,\" said Lacy, softly, \"but General Beauregard has ordered Sempland to keep her on the surface. That ought to give them a chance. Glassell escaped, you remember, when he tried the _New Ironsides_.\"  \"He will be killed! He will be killed!\" she cried piteously, \"and--Admiral Vernon!\"  \"What is the Yankee admiral to you, to any of us?\" Lacy asked, curiously interested to know the meaning of her remark.  \"Why do you tell me of all this?\" she asked, failing to notice his question in her anxiety and alarm.  \"Because I want you to know Sempland as the hero he is, and because--forgive my frankness--I believe that you love him. So I want him to hear you say it before he goes out. It will double his chances of escape if he has your love to think of. You will inspire him to come back. As it is now, I am afraid he does not especially care to. He's too good a man to lose, if we--if you--can save him, Miss Fanny.\"  \"And this man abused you to me this afternoon!\" murmured the girl.  \"He said what was true. I honor him for it. I love you, Miss Fanny. I am proving it to you now as I proved it to him when I gave him my place at his earnest entreaty. The detail was mine.\"  \"Why did you do it?\"  \"For his sake, for yours. It's his solitary chance. I've had so many, you know.\"  \"And he is going to blow up the _Wabash_, the admiral's ship, did you say?\"  \"Yes, if he can.\"  Fanny Glen was a picture of terror plainly apparent in spite of her valiant effort to conceal her feelings. Her agitation was so overwhelming, her anxiety so pronounced, that even on the hypothesis of an ardent affection for Sempland, Lacy was completely at loss to account for her condition. What could it mean? But he had no time to speculate upon it. The minutes were flying by.  \"Come, Miss Glen,\" he said at last, \"it isn't so bad as all that.\"  \"But those men on the ship, the--the admiral! They won't have a chance for their lives. It is"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21681"],["title","A Little Traitor to the South (#4)"],["body"," to think of! I cannot bear it! I--\"  \"Let them lift the blockade then,\" coolly returned the young officer; \"it is a chance of war. Don't waste your sympathy on them. Bestow it nearer at hand. Sempland starts in half an hour. Won't you see him before he goes?\"  \"Yes,\" whispered the girl, \"if you will send him to me.\"  \"There is no time to lose. I will have him here in a few moments.\"  As he turned away the girl stretched out her hand to him.  \"You have been very good--very brave--very noble,\" she faltered. \"I wish--I--I loved you more than--than I do.\"  He stooped over her and kissed her bended head. She was a little woman and so appealing. He breathed a prayer over her and tore himself away.  \"Thank you,\" he said, \"you have rewarded me. Good-by.\"     CHAPTER V  WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STRONG ROOM   As she heard his departing footstep on the porch the poor girl threw herself down upon her knees and lifted her hands.  \"The South and--and--he, mistaken, but still--ah, where is my duty? The ship and Rhett Sempland! I love him. I cannot let him go! It would be wicked. God pity me! But how, how to prevent it? If I can only delay him until to-morrow, I can tell the general everything, and--is there a way, is there a way, O God?\"  She thought deeply, every atom in her being concentrated on the problem which tore her between love and duty, devotion to the cause of the South and those other appeals, which, finding lodgment in her heart, moved her so profoundly. She wrestled with the question as to where her duty lay as Jacob wrestled with the angel of old, and if she did not conquer, at least she decided.  Determining on a desperate course of action, she rose to her feet and sharply struck a bell by her side on the table. The house was an ancient mansion when it had been rented by her aunt and herself three years before. It dated back to Colonial times. There was a strong room in it, the windows of which were barred. It would make a safe prison for any one. He should be put in there and be kept there until morning. He would be safe there. No harm would come to the ship, and when the general knew, he would forgive her. She would tell him the first thing in the morning.  It would cause her lover pain and grief, this summary action of hers, but she could explain it to him, too; and he would forgive her also and she would reward him with herself! There was compensation in that, she thought proudly and tenderly.  \"Cæsar,\" she said, as the aged butler made his appearance in response to the bell, \"send Joe and Sam and Cato to me. Boys,\" she continued, as three stalwart young negroes presented themselves before her soon after, \"Mr. Sempland is coming here to-night to see me. I--he--\" she found it somewhat difficult to explain. \"General Beauregard wants him detained here. I cannot let him get away. Show him into the strong room on the other side of the house when he asks for me, and then lock the door on him. Don't let him get out under any circumstances until to-morrow, but on no account are you to do him any hurt. You hear? You understand?\"  \"Ya-as, Miss Fanny, I specs we does,\" answered Cato, the oldest and most intelligent of the three.  \"Cæsar, you lead him into the strong room. Say I will meet him there in a moment. He won't suspect anything, I reckon. The rest of you stay in the passage, and as soon as he enters lock the door upon him. Don't neglect that! He'll try to get out. He may break the door down. But you must keep him there, even if he attempts to kill you--unless I say for you to release him.\"  The three slaves were devoted to their young mistress and, accepting her orders without a question, they at once began their preparations to carry them out. As they were talking together a light step sounded on the porch. There was a ring at the door. The men hurried to their places of concealment. Miss Fanny Glen hid in the dark drawing-room, as Cæsar shuffled along the hall to the front door.  \"Your mistress has sent for me,\" said Sempland. And from where she stood in the drawing-room, Fanny Glen's heart leaped at the tones of his voice.  \"Yas, suh,\" returned the darky, obsequiously ushering him through the hall. \"Step right dis way, suh, Mass' Sempland. Miss Fanny done axes you to go in dis room at de end ob de passage, suh. An' she tol' me she gwine be wid you in a minute, suh.\"  The room was one which Sempland had never entered before. It was small, furnished like a library or office, with several large closets and an old iron safe, and had two grated windows and one heavy mahogany door. It had formerly been used as an office and as a treasure room. Seeing the visitor safe within, Cæsar calmly withdrew, and as he adroitly coughed violently in the passage Sempland did not hear the ponderous key turning in the old-fashioned lock. He waited a few minutes, and then, as time was precious, he looked around for a bell. Seeing none he walked to the door, laid his hand upon the knob, and tried to open it. It did not give.  \"Locked!\" he muttered in surprise.  Raising his hand he struck a light blow on the panels, but there was no reply. Then he called out and received no answer. He struck and called again and again, his voice rising to a shout while his hands were bleeding from the blows he had rained on the hard surface. Finally a voice came to him faintly through the door.  \"Wat's de matta, suh?\"  \"Open this door instantly, you black dog! Where is Miss Glen?\"  \"She's a-comin', suh.\"  \"I wish to see her immediately!\" he cried imperiously, kicking and battering again upon the door in furious rage, which was stilled the instant he heard her voice outside.  \"Mr. Sempland?\"  \"What is the meaning of this action, this outrage, Miss Glen?\" he cried. \"You sent for me. I came. Why am I locked in here? Open the door! I must leave immediately!\"  \"You are locked in here by my orders, Mr. Sempland,\" said Fanny Glen, nervously.  \"Impossible! For what reason?\"  \"Because I--I--\"  \"By heavens, this is maddening! You don't know what you do! I am ordered to-night on a hazardous expedition. I must be at my post in ten minutes. Let me out instantly!\"  \"I know,\" returned the girl.  \"Well, then, why don't you open this door? I will say nothing of this--\"  \"I cannot.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"I--I--do not wish you to go out on the _David_.\"  \"What is it to you? How dare you interfere? You said I had done nothing but lie in prison,\" he replied. \"I will show you to-night.\"  \"Not to-night.\"  \"This is madness! Think what you are doing!\"  \"I can't help it.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because I--I--\"  \"In God's name, what do you mean?\"  \"I will not have you take the risk. It is certain death to you, and the admiral's ship--\" said the girl, so softly that he could scarce hear her. \"You will forgive me when you understand. I shall release you to-morrow. Mercy! Have pity on me, I am almost crazy!\"  \"Do you know that you will dishonor me? If you care, let me go.\"  \"There is another reason. I will not have the _Wabash_ blown up. There is a--a--\"  \"Another man?\" shouted Sempland. \"You are a coquette! Let me out, I say! I will get out! My God, was ever a man in such a situation?\"  He beat and hammered on the massive door until his bruised hands bled again. He shook it in its frame like a madman. He was exhausted by the violence of his efforts and of his passion. Through it all the girl stood in the hall frightened nearly to death. What mad scheme had she entered upon? Had she strength enough to carry it through? The three servants were terrified also, their eyes rolling in their sockets, their hands nervously fingering their weapons. Suddenly another voice, Cæsar's, broke through the turmoil, reaching even the ear of the desperate man on the other side of the heavy mahogany door. He stopped to listen.  \"Miss Fanny,\" said the butler, \"dah's a sojah man at de do', an' he wants to know if Mass' Semplan' is heah.\"  \"Tell him, no,\" said Fanny Glen, resolutely. \"Say he left a half-hour ago.\"  \"My God!\" groaned Sempland. \"I am a disgraced and ruined man! Listen to me, Fanny Glen! I swear to you, on my honor as a gentleman, if you do not instantly open this door I'll blow my brains out in this room!\"  \"Oh, you wouldn't do that?\"  \"I will, so help me God!\"  There was conviction in his voice. The girl listening in the passage heard the click of a raised revolver hammer.  \"Don't!\" she cried in greater terror than ever, \"I will open!\"  He heard a brief whispered consultation, the key was turned in the lock, and the door was suddenly flung open. Sempland darted toward it on the instant and recoiled from the terrible figure of the little woman barring him with outstretched arms. If he had suffered within, she had suffered without the room. Such a look of mortal agony and anguish he had never seen on any human face. She trembled violently before him. Yet she was resolute not to give way, determined to keep the door. Clustered at her back were the three trembling negroes armed one with a knife, another with a pistol, another with a stout club. He would have swept them out of his path in an instant had it not been for the girl. She stood before him with outstretched arms, her attitude a mixture of defiance and appeal.  [Illustration: \"The door was suddenly flung open.\"]  \"It is too late,\" she said, \"you were to go at seven. It is past that now. Saved, saved!\"  He could do her no violence, that was certain. He stood silent before her, his head bent toward the floor, thinking deeply. Her heart went out to him then, her soul yearned to him. She had hurt him, he must hate her--and she loved him.  \"Will you not come in and speak to me for a moment?\" he asked her quietly enough at last.  She signed to the men, stepped forward, the door was closed, and locked behind her, and they were alone.  \"Did you think to be of service to me?\" he burst out, as she drew near and then paused irresolute, miserable. \"You have ruined me for life! I begged that detail. I volunteered. I must get out! They may wait for me. It may "]]]
