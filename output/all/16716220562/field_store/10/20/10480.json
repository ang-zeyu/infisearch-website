And I don't expect you're going to cut my foot off, because _you agreed not to_.\"  \"I never did anything of the kind!\" Peter Mink shouted.  \"Well, we'll go and ask Mr. Crow what he thinks about it,\" Jimmy Rabbit said. \"We'll leave it to him.\"     SETTLING A DISPUTE   While Jimmy Rabbit was looking for wise old Mr. Crow, Peter Mink stuck close behind him.  \"You needn't think you can run away with _my_ rabbit's lucky left hind-foot,\" Peter kept saying. \"That's _my_ foot! You promised to give it to me for helping you out of the mud. And I intend to have it. I'm going to follow you wherever you go. I wish you'd try to be a little more careful where you step with my foot.\"  But Jimmy Rabbit didn't seem the least bit worried.  \"You stand by your bargain, and I'll stand by mine,\" he told Peter. And that was all he would say.  At last Jimmy found Mr. Crow. And as soon as Peter Mink spied him he hurried up and began to complain to Mr. Crow that Jimmy Rabbit wouldn't stand by his bargain.  \"What was it?\" Mr. Crow asked.  \"He promised to give me his left hind-foot, if I'd pull him out of the creek,\" said Peter Mink.  \"Did he pull you out?\" Mr. Crow asked Jimmy Rabbit.  And Jimmy admitted that Peter had helped him out.  \"He helped me in, too,\" added Jimmy. \"But I didn't have to pay him for doing that.\"  \"You're out of order!\" Mr. Crow told Jimmy sharply.  And looking down at his mud-stained clothes, Jimmy Rabbit said that he supposed he was.  \"Can you repeat the exact words of the bargain?\" Mr. Crow asked Peter Mink.  \"Yes,\" Peter began. \"He said----\"  \"That will do!\" Mr. Crow cautioned him. \"I said, '_Can_ you repeat them?' I didn't _tell_ you to repeat them, did I?\"  \"No,\" Peter Mink admitted.  \"I advise you to be very careful,\" Mr. Crow warned him. Then Mr. Crow turned to Jimmy Rabbit.  \"Can _you_ repeat the exact words of the bargain?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir!\" said Jimmy Rabbit promptly.  \"Good!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"I'll settle this dispute in no time. Now, I want you, Jimmy Rabbit, to whisper the exact words in my _right_ ear, while Peter Mink whispers the exact words in my _left_ one. In that way I shall know at once if there's anybody that isn't telling the truth.\"  Mr. Crow was very particular. He made Peter and Jimmy begin at the same time. And he said that if they both told the truth it seemed to him that they ought to _finish_ at the same time, too.  And that's just the way it happened!  \"I don't see what the dispute is,\" said Mr. Crow. \"You both agree. And how can two people have a dispute, when they agree perfectly? The only difference I noticed in your stories was that Peter whispered much louder than Jimmy.\"  \"The trouble,\" Peter Mink cried, \"the trouble is, he won't let me cut off his left hind-foot!\"  Mr. Crow looked astonished.  \"And why should he?\" he exclaimed. \"You agreed to take, along with the foot, all the luck and _everything else that goes with it_. And if the rest of Jimmy Rabbit doesn't go with his left hind-foot, why--I should like to know what does!\"  Peter Mink looked very sour. But pretty soon he brightened up.  \"All right!\" he said. \"I get the whole of him, then--don't I?\"  \"You certainly do,\" said Mr. Crow. \"And what's more, you have to _carry him in your pocket_, for that was part of the bargain.\"  Now, when you stop to remember that Jimmy Rabbit was four times bigger than Peter Mink, you can understand how angry Peter must have been. He saw right away that such a thing was impossible.  \"I can't do that!\" he cried.  \"Then I declare the agreement to be broken,\" said Mr. Crow. \"And I advise Jimmy Rabbit to run home at once, for I happen to know that his mother is looking for him.\"  Afterward, Peter Mink always claimed that there was no use trying to get the better of anybody that had the left hind-foot of a rabbit. He said that they certainly were lucky, and that he knew what he was talking about.

Only a few of the kindly reviewers of the earlier editions of Crowded Out o' Crofield have suggested that it has at all exaggerated the possible career of its boy and girl actors.  If any others have silently agreed with them, it may be worth while to say that the pictures of places and the doings of older and younger people are pretty accurately historical.  The story and the writing of it were suggested in a conversation with an energetic American boy who was crowded out of his own village into a career which led to something much more surprising than a profitable junior partnership.

CHAPTER I.  THE BLACKSMITH'S BOY.  \"I'm going to the city!\"  He stood in the wide door of the blacksmith-shop, with his hands in his pockets, looking down the street, toward the rickety old bridge over the Cocahutchie.  He was a sandy-haired, freckled-faced boy, and if he was really only about fifteen, he was tall for his age.  Across the top of the door, over his head, stretched a cracked and faded sign, with a horseshoe painted on one end and a hammer on the other, and the name \"John Ogden,\" almost faded out, between them.  The blacksmith-shop was a great, rusty, grimy clutter of work-benches, vises, tools, iron in bars and rods, and all sorts of old iron scraps and things that looked as if they needed making over.  The forge was in the middle, on one side, and near it was hitched a horse, pawing the ground with a hoof that bore a new shoe.  On the anvil was a brilliant, yellow-red loop of iron, that was not quite yet a new shoe, and it was sending out bright sparks as a hammer fell upon it--\"thud, thud, thud,\" and a clatter.  Over the anvil leaned a tall, muscular, dark-haired, grimy man.  His face wore a disturbed and anxious look, and it was covered with charcoal dust.  There was altogether too much charcoal along the high bridge of his Roman nose and over his jutting eyebrows.  The boy in the door also had some charcoal on his cheeks and forehead, but none upon his nose.  His nose was not precisely like the blacksmith's.  It was high and Roman half-way down, but just there was a little dent, and the rest of the nose was straight.  His complexion, excepting the freckles and charcoal, was chiefly sunburn, down to the neckband of his blue checked shirt.  He was a tough, wiry-looking boy, and there was a kind of smiling, self-confident expression in his blue-gray eyes and around his firm mouth.  \"I'm going to the city!\" he said, again, in a low but positive voice. \"I'll get there, somehow.\"  Just then a short, thick-set man came hurrying past him into the shop. He was probably the whitest man going into that or any other shop, and he spoke out at once, very fast, but with a voice that sounded as if it came through a bag of meal.  \"Ogden,\" said he, \"got him shod?  If you have, I'll take him.  What do you say about that trade?\"  \"I don't want any more room than there is here,\" said the blacksmith, \"and I don't care to move my shop.\"  \"There's nigh onto two acres, mebbe more, all along the creek from below the mill to Deacon Hawkins's line, below the bridge,\" wheezed the mealy, floury, dusty man, rapidly.  \"I'll get two hundred for it some day, ground or no ground.  Best place for a shop.\"  \"This lot suits me,\" said the smith, hammering away.  \"'Twouldn't pay me to move--not in these times.\"  The miller had more to say, while he unhitched his horse, but he led him out without getting any more favorable reply about the trade.  \"Come and blow, Jack,\" said the smith, and the boy in the door turned promptly to take the handle of the bellows.  The little heap of charcoal and coke in the forge brightened and sent up fiery tongues, as the great leathern lungs wheezed and sighed, and Jack himself began to puff.  \"I've got to have a bigger man than you are, for a blower and striker,\" said the smith.  \"He's coming Monday morning.  It's time you were doing something, Jack.\"  \"Why, father,\" said Jack, as he ceased pulling on the bellows, and the shoe came out of the fire, \"I've been doing something ever since I was twelve.  Been working here since May, and lots o' times before that. Learned the trade, too.\"  \"You can make a nail, but you can't make a shoe,\" said his father, as he sizzed the bit of bent iron in the water-tub and then threw it on the ground.  \"Seven.  That's all the shoes I'll make this morning, and there are seven of you at home.  Your mother can't spare Molly, but you'll have to do something.  It is Saturday, and you can go fishing, after dinner, if you'd like to.  There's nothin' to ketch 'round here, either.  Worst times there ever were in Crofield.\"  There was gloom as well as charcoal on the face of the blacksmith, but Jack's expression was only respectfully serious as he walked away, without speaking, and again stood in the door for a moment.  \"I could catch something in the city.  I know I could,\" he said, to himself.  \"How on earth shall I get there?\"  The bridge, at the lower end of the sloping side-street on which the shop stood, was long and high.  It was made to fit the road and was a number of sizes too large for the stream of water rippling under it. The side-street climbed about twenty rods the other way into what was evidently the Main Street of Crofield.  There was a tavern on one corner, and across the street from that there was a drug store and in it was the post-office.  On the two opposite corners were shops, and all along Main Street were all sorts of business establishments, sandwiched in among the dwellings.  It was not yet noon, but Crofield had a sleepy look, as if all its work for the whole week were done.  Even the horses of the farmers' teams, hitched in front of the stores, looked sleepy.  Jack Ogden took his longest look, this time, at a neat, white-painted frame-house across the way.  \"Seems to me there isn't nearly so much room in it as there used to be,\" he said to himself.  \"It's just packed and crowded.  I'm going!\"  He turned and walked on up toward Main Street, as if that were the best thing he could do till dinner time.  Not many minutes later, a girl plainly but neatly dressed came slowly along in front of the village green, away up Main Street.  She was tall and slender, and her hair and eyes were as dark as those of John Ogden, the blacksmith.  Her nose was like his, too, except that it was finer and not so high, and she wore very much the same anxious, discontented look upon her face.  She was walking slowly, because she saw, coming toward her, a portly lady, with hair so flaxy that no gray would show in it.  She was elegantly dressed.  She stopped and smiled and looked very condescending.  \"Good-morning, Mary Ogden,\" she said.  \"Good-morning, Miss Glidden,\" said Mary, the anxious look in her eyes changing to a gleam that made them seem very wide awake.  \"It's a fine morning, Mary Ogden, but so very warm.  Is your mother well?\"  \"Very well, thank you,\" said Mary.  \"And is your aunt well--and your father, and all the children?  I'm so glad they are well.  Elder Holloway's to be here to-morrow.  Hope you'll all come.  I shall be there myself.  You've had my class a number of times.  Much obliged to you.  I'll be there to-morrow.  You must hear the Elder.  He's to inspect the Sunday-school.\"  \"Your class, Miss Glidden?\" began Mary; and her face suggested that somebody was blowing upon a kind of fire inside her cheeks, and that they would be very red in a minute.  \"Yes; don't fail to be there to-morrow, Mary.  The choir'll be full, of course.  I shall be there myself.\"  \"I hope you will, Miss Glidden--\"  The portly lady saw something up the street at that moment.  \"Oh my!  What is it?  Dear me!  It's coming!  Run!  We'll all be killed!  Oh my!\"  She had turned quite around, while she was speaking, and was once more looking up the street; but the dark-haired girl had neither flinched nor wavered.  She had only sent a curious, inquiring glance in the direction of the shouts and the rattle and the cloud of dust that were coming swiftly toward them.  \"A runaway team,\" she said, quietly.  \"Nobody's in the wagon.\"  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Miss Glidden; but Mary began to move away, looking not at her but at the runaway, and she did not hear the rest.  \"Mary Ogden's too uppish.--Somebody'll be killed, I know they will!--She's got to be taken down.--There they come!--Dressed too well for a blacksmith's daughter.  Doesn't know her place.--Oh dear!  I'm so frightened!\"  Perhaps she had been wise in getting"]]]
