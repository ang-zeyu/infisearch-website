Now, how long d'ye think it would take them?--guess.\"  Fred Borders smiled as he said this, and looked round the circle of men.  \"I know,\" cried one, \"it would take the whole forty thousand a _week_ to do it.\"  \"Oh! nonsense, they could do it easy in two days,\" said another.  \"That shows how little you know about big numbers,\" observed Tom Lokins, knocking the ashes out of his pipe.  \"I'm pretty sure it couldn't be done in much less than six months; workin' hard all day, and makin' allowance for only one hour off for dinner.\"  \"You're all wrong, shipmates,\" said Fred Borders.  \"That young doctor told me that if they'd begun work at the day of creation they would only have just finished the job last year!\"  \"Oh! gammon, you're jokin',\" cried Bill Blunt.  \"No, I'm not,\" said Fred, \"for I was told afterwards by an old clergyman that the young doctor was quite right, and that any one who was good at 'rithmetic could work the thing out for himself in less than half-an-hour.\"  Just as Fred said this there came a loud cry from the mast-head that made us all spring to our feet like lightning.  \"There she blows!  There she breaches!\"  The captain was on deck in a moment.  \"Where away?\" he cried.  \"On the lee beam, sir.  Sperm whale, about two miles off.  There she blows!\"  Every man was at his station in a moment; for, after being some months out, we became so used to the work, that we acted together like a piece of machinery.  But our excitement never abated in the least.  \"Sing out when the ship heads for her.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir.\"  \"Keep her away!\" said the captain to the man at the helm.  \"Bob Ledbury, hand me the spyglass.\"  \"Steady,\" from the mast-head.  \"Steady it is,\" answered the man at the helm.  While we were all looking eagerly out ahead we heard a thundering snore behind us, followed by a heavy splash.  Turning quickly round, we saw the flukes of an enormous whale sweeping through the air not more than six hundred yards astern of us.  \"Down your helm,\" roared the captain; \"haul up the mainsail, and square the yards.  Call all hands.\"  \"All hands, ahoy!\" roared Bill Blunt, in a voice of thunder, and in another moment every man in the ship was on deck.  \"Hoist and swing the boats,\" cried the captain.  \"Lower away.\"  Down went the boats into the water; the men were into their places almost before you could wink, and we pulled away from the ship just as the whale rose the second time, about half a mile away to leeward.  From the appearance of this whale we felt certain that it was one of the largest we had yet seen, so we pulled after it with right good will.  I occupied my usual place in the captain's boat, next the bow-oar, just beside Tom Lokins, who was ready with his harpoons in the bow.  Young Borders pulled the oar directly in front of me.  The captain himself steered, and, as our crew was a picked one, we soon left the other two boats behind us.  Presently a small whale rose close beside us, and, sending a shower of spray over the boat, went down in a pool of foam.  Before we had time to speak, another whale rose on the opposite side of the boat, and then another on our starboard bow.  We had got into the middle of a shoal of whales, which commenced leaping and spouting all round us, little aware of the dangerous enemy that was so near.  In a few minutes more, up comes the big one again that we had first seen.  He seemed very active and wild.  After blowing on the surface once or twice, about a quarter of a mile off, he peaked his flukes, and pitched down head foremost.  \"Now then, lads, he's down for a long dive,\" said the captain; \"spring your oars like men, we'll get that fish for certain, if you'll only pull.\"  The captain was mistaken; the whale had only gone down deep in order to come up and breach, or spring out of the water, for the next minute he came up not a hundred yards from us, and leaped his whole length into the air.  A shout of surprise broke from the men, and no wonder, for this was the largest fish I ever saw or heard of, and he came up so clear of the water, that we could see him from head to tail, as he turned over in the air, exposing his white belly to view, and came down on his great side with a crash like thunder, that might have been heard six miles off.  A splendid mass of pure white spray burst from the spot where he fell, and in another moment he was gone.  \"I do believe it's _New Zealand Tom_,\" cried Bill Blunt, referring to an old bull whale that had become famous among the men who frequented these seas, for its immense size and fierceness, and for the great trouble it had given them, smashing some of their boats, and carrying away many of their harpoons.  \"I don't know whether it's New Zealand Tom or not,\" said the captain, \"but it's pretty clear that he's an old sperm bull.  Give way, lads, we must get that whale, whatever it should cost us.\"  We did not need a second bidding; the size of the fish was so great that we felt more excited than we had yet been during the voyage, so we bent our oars till we almost pulled the boat out of the water.  The other boats had got separated, chasing the little whales, so we had this one all to ourselves.  \"There she blows!\" said Tom Lokins, in a low voice, as the fish came up a short distance astern of us.  We had overshot our mark, so, turning about, we made for the whale, which kept for a considerable time near the top of the water, spouting now and then, and going slowly to windward.  We at last got within a few feet of the monster, and the captain suddenly gave the word, \"Stand up.\"  This was to our harpooner, Tom Lokins, who jumped up on the instant, and buried two harpoons deep in the blubber.  \"Stern all!\" was the next word, and we backed off with all our might. It was just in time, for, in his agony, the whale tossed his tail right over our heads, the flukes were so big that they could have completely covered the boat, and he brought them down flat on the sea with a clap that made our ears tingle, while a shower of spray drenched us to the skin.  For one moment I thought it was all over with us, but we were soon out of immediate danger, and lay on our oars watching the writhings of the wounded monster as he lashed the ocean into foam.  The water all round us soon became white like milk, and the foam near the whale was red with blood.  Suddenly this ceased, and, before we could pull up to lance him, he went down, taking the line out at such a rate that the boat spun round, and sparks of fire flew from the logger-head, from the chafing of the rope.  \"Hold on!\" cried the captain, and next moment we were tearing over the sea at a fearful rate, with a bank of white foam rolling before us, high above our bows, and away on each side of us like the track of a steamer, so that we expected it every moment to rush in-board and swamp us.  I had never seen anything like this before.  From the first I had a kind of feeling that some evil would befall us.  While we were tearing over the water in this way, we saw the other whales coming up every now and then, and blowing quite near to us, and presently we passed close enough to the first mate's boat to see that he was fast to a fish, and unable, therefore, to render us help if we should need it.  In a short time the line began to slack, so we hauled it in hand over hand, and Tom Lokins coiled it away in the tub in the stern of the boat, while the captain took his place in the bow to be ready with the lance. The whale soon came up, and we pulled with all our might towards him. Instead of making off again, however, he turned round and made straight at the boat.  I now thought that destruction was certain, for, when I saw his great blunt forehead coming down on us like a steamboat, I felt that we could not escape.  I was mistaken.  The captain received him on the point of his lance, and the whale has such a dislike to pain, that even a small prick will sometimes turn him.  For some time we kept dodging round this fellow; but he was so old and wise, that he always turned his head to us, and prevented us from getting a chance to lance him.  At last he turned a little to one side, and the captain plunged the lance deep into his vitals.  \"Ha! that's touched his life,\" cried Tom, as a stream of blood flew up from his blow-holes, a sure sign that he was mortally wounded.  But he was not yet conquered.  After receiving the cruel stab with the lance, he pitched right down, head foremost, and once more the line began to fly out over the bow.  We tried to hold on, but he was going so straight down that the boat was almost swamped, and we had to slack off to prevent our being pulled under water.  Before many yards of the line had run out, one of the coils in the tub became entangled.  \"Look out, lads,\" cried Tom, and at once throwing the turn off the logger-head, he made an attempt to clear it.  The captain, in trying to do the same thing, slipped and fell.  Seeing this, I sprang up, and, grasping the coil as it flew past, tried to clear it.  Before I could think, a turn whipped round my left wrist.  I felt a wrench as if my arm had been torn "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21732"],["title","Fort Desolation: Red Indians and Fur Traders of Rupert's Land (#0)"],["body","DESOLATION, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  OR, SOLITUDE IN THE WILDERNESS.  THE OUTSKIRTER.  To some minds solitude is depressing, to others it is congenial.  It was the _former_ to our friend John Robinson; yet he had a large share of it in his chequered life.  John--more familiarly known as Jack--was as romantic as his name was the reverse.  To look at him you would have supposed that he was the most ordinary of common-place men, but if you had known him, as we did, you would have discovered that there was a deep, silent, but ever-flowing river of enthusiasm, energy, fervour--in a word, romance--in his soul, which seldom or never manifested itself in words, and only now and then, on rare occasions, flashed out in a lightning glance, or blazed up in a fiery countenance.  For the most part Jack was calm as a mill-pond, deep as the Atlantic, straightforward and grave as an undertaker's clerk and good-humoured as an unspoilt and healthy child.  Jack never made a joke, but, certes, he could enjoy one; and he had a way of showing his enjoyment by a twinkle in his blue eye and a chuckle in his throat that was peculiarly impressive.  Jack was a type of a large class.  He was what we may call an _outskirter_ of the world.  He was one of those who, from the force of necessity, or of self-will, or of circumstances, are driven to the outer circle of this world to do as Adam and Eve's family did, battle with Nature in her wildest scenes and moods; to earn his bread, literally, in the sweat of his brow.  Jack was a middle-sized man of strong make.  He was not sufficiently large to overawe men by his size, neither was he so small as to invite impertinence from \"big bullies,\" of whom there were plenty in his neighbourhood.  In short, being an unpretending man and a plain man, with a good nose and large chin and sandy hair, he was not usually taken much notice of by strangers during his journeyings in the world; but when vigorous action in cases of emergency was required Jack Robinson was the man to make himself conspicuous.  It is not our intention to give an account of Jack's adventurous life from beginning to end, but to detail the incidents of a sojourn of two months at Fort Desolation, in almost utter solitude, in order to show one of the many phases of rough life to which outskirters are frequently subjected.  In regard to his early life it may be sufficient to say that Jack, after being born, created such perpetual disturbance and storm in the house that his worthy father came to look upon him as a perfect pest, and as soon as possible sent him to a public school, where he fought like a Mameluke Bey, learned his lessons with the zeal of a philosopher, and, at the end of ten years ran away to sea, where he became as sick as a dog and as miserable as a convicted felon.  Poor Jack was honest of heart and generous of spirit, but many a long hard year did he spend in the rugged parts of the earth ere he recovered, (if he ever did recover), from the evil effects of this first false step.  In course of time Jack was landed in Canada, with only a few shillings in his pocket; from that period he became an outskirter.  The romance in his nature pointed to the backwoods; he went thither at once, and was not disappointed.  At first the wild life surpassed his expectations, but as time wore on the tinsel began to wear off the face of things, and he came to see them as they actually were.  Nevertheless, the romance of life did not wear out of his constitution.  Enthusiasm, quiet but deep, stuck to him all through his career, and carried him on and over difficulties that would have disgusted and turned back many a colder spirit.  Jack's first success was the obtaining of a situation as clerk in the store of a general merchant in an outskirt settlement of Canada.  Dire necessity drove him to this.  He had been three weeks without money and nearly two days without food before he succumbed.  Having given in, however, he worked like a Trojan, and would certainly have advanced himself in life if his employer had not failed and left him, minus a portion of his salary, to \"try again.\"  Next, he became an engineer on board one of the Missouri steamers, in which capacity he burst his boiler, and threw himself and the passengers into the river--the captain having adopted the truly Yankee expedient of sitting down on the safety-valve while racing with another boat!  Afterwards, Jack Robinson became clerk in one of the Ontario steam-boats, but, growing tired of this life, he went up the Ottawa, and became overseer of a sawmill.  Here, being on the frontier of civilisation, he saw the roughest of Canadian life.  The lumbermen of that district are a mixed race--French-Canadians, Irishmen, Indians, half-castes, etcetera,--and whatever good qualities these men might possess in the way of hewing timber and bush-life, they were sadly deficient in the matters of morality and temperance.  But Jack was a man of tact and good temper, and played his cards well.  He jested with the jocular, sympathised with the homesick, doctored the ailing in a rough and ready fashion peculiarly his own, and avoided the quarrelsome.  Thus he became a general favourite.  Of course it was not to be expected that he could escape an occasional broil, and it was herein that his early education did him good service. He had been trained in an English school where he became one of the best boxers.  The lumberers on the Ottawa were not practised in this science; they indulged in that kicking, tearing, pommelling sort of mode which is so repugnant to the feelings of an Englishman.  The consequence was that Jack had few fights, but these were invariably with the largest bullies of the district; and he, in each case, inflicted such tremendous facial punishment on his opponent that he became a noted man, against whom few cared to pit themselves.  There are none so likely to enjoy peace as those who are prepared for war.  Jack used sometimes to say, with a smile, that his few battles were the price he had to pay for peace.  Our hero was unlucky.  The saw-mill failed--its master being a drunkard. When that went down he entered the lumber trade, where he made the acquaintance of a young Scotchman, of congenial mind and temperament, who suggested the setting up of a store in a promising locality and proposed entering into partnership.  \"Murray and Robinson\" was forthwith painted by the latter, (who was a bit of an artist), over the door of a small log-house, and the store soon became well known and much frequented by the sparse population as well as by those engaged in the timber trade.  But \"the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.\"  There must have been a screw loose somewhere, for bad debts accumulated and losses were incurred which finally brought the firm to the ground, and left its dissevered partners to begin the world over again!  After this poor Jack Robinson fell into low spirits for a time, but he soon recovered, and bought a small piece of land at a nominal price in a region so wild that he had to cut his own road to it, fell the trees with his own hand, and, in short, reclaim it from the wilderness on the margin of which it lay.  This was hard work, but Jack liked hard work, and whatever work he undertook he always did it well.  Strange that such a man could not get on! yet so it was, that, in a couple of years, he found himself little better off than he had been when he entered on his new property.  The region, too, was not a tempting one.  No adventurous spirits had located themselves beside him, and only a few had come within several miles of his habitation.  This did not suit our hero's sociable temperament, and he began to despond very much.  Still his sanguine spirit led him to persevere, and there is no saying how long he might have continued to spend his days and his energies in felling trees and sowing among the stumps and hoping for better days, had not his views been changed and his thoughts turned into another channel by a letter.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE LETTER, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.  One fine spring morning Jack was sitting, smoking his pipe after breakfast, at the door of his log cabin, looking pensively out upon the tree-stump-encumbered field which constituted his farm.  He had facetiously named his residence the Mountain House, in consequence of there being neither mountain nor hill larger than an inverted wash-hand basin, within ten miles of him!  He was wont to defend the misnomer on the ground that it served to keep him in remembrance of the fact that hills really existed in other parts of the world.  Jack was in a desponding mood.  His pipe would not \"draw\" that morning; and his mind had been more active than usual for a few days past, revolving the past, the present, and the future.  In short, Jack was cross.  There could be no doubt whatever about it; for he suddenly, and without warning, dashed his pipe to pieces against a log, went into the house for another, which he calmly filled, as he resumed his former seat, lit, and continued to smoke for some time in sulky silence.  We record this fact because it was quite contrary to Jack's amiable and patient character, and showed that some deep emotions were stirring within him.  The second pipe \"drew\" well.  Probably it was this that induced him to give utterance to the expression--  \"I wonder how long this sort of thing will last?\"  \"Just as long as you've a mind to let it, and no longer,\" answered a man clad in the garb of a trapper, whose mocassin foot had given no indication of his approach until he was within a couple of paces of the door.  \"Is that you, Joe?\" said Jack, looking up, and pointing to a log which served as a seat on the other side of the doorway.  \"It's all that's of me,\" replied Joe.  \"Sit down and fill your pipe out of my pouch, Joe.  It's good 'baccy, you'll find.  Any news?  I suppose not.  There never is; and if there was, what would be the odds to me?\"  \""]]]
