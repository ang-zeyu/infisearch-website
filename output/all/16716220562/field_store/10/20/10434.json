It was very sore, and that same night, when he sat carefully on the edge of his narrow bed, waiting for Velo to come and help him undress, the bed went down and Zaidos was thrown to the floor.  It hurt his leg again.  Velo picked him up and was so sorry that for once Zaidos felt a twinge of remorse when he thought of the way he had guyed him.  But the nurse, who had been transferred to the land hospital also, pressed her lips tight together and thought hard.  Zaidos was almost too unlucky.  She took him under her own special care, although Velo protested and assured her that she must not burden herself while he was there to look out for his cousin.  \"I don't see why so many things keep happening to you,\" she said to Zaidos while she dressed the place on his arm where the brass pin had made a bad sore.  \"I _am_ playing in hard luck, at that,\" said Zaidos, smiling.  \"Every time I turn around I seem to bump myself somehow.  I was on the football team, and had won my letter for running.  Do you suppose I will ever get to run again?\"  \"I don't know,\" said the nurse.  \"I don't see why this leg should make much difference.  It was only one bone, you know, and you could bandage that leg if it felt weak.  But you can't keep falling off cots and sticking infected pins into you.\"  \"Funny thing about that cot,\" said Zaidos.  \"The bolt that held the spring and headboard together was gone--completely gone.  I wonder if it ever was in.  Perhaps when they put it together, they forgot that corner, and it stuck together until I happened to sit down on it just right.  I've known things like that.  I'm glad it didn't go down with some poor fellow who was badly wounded.  It gave my leg an awful jolt. And it certainly gets me where I got that pin in the crutch pad.  It must have been in the lining, and just worked out.  I don't believe it will make a bad sore.  My blood is pretty good.  It's funny, though.\"  \"A lot of queer things happen to you, Zaidos,\" said the nurse.  \"Tell me, have you no other name?  Are you just Zaidos and nothing else?\"  \"Oh, yes, I have five or six other names,\" said Zaidos, smiling.  \"But you know in Greece it is the custom to call the--\"  He glanced into the face before him with a queer embarrassed look, and stopped.  \"Just so,\" said the nurse.  \"I understand.  You are the head of your house, whatever that is, and you have very sensibly decided to keep it all to yourself while you are mixed up in this war.  Well, Zaidos, in England, too, we sometimes call the head of a noble house by his family name.  For my part, however, I prefer to think of you simply as a particularly nice, agreeable boy, who has made his illness a very pleasant time for the people who have been near him; and so I think I will call you something simpler than Zaidos.  Is John one of your five or six names?\"  \"Nothing so easy as that,\" said Zaidos, smiling.  \"Why, I will tell you what they are.\"  \"I don't want to know,\" said the nurse.  \"I, too, have a name that we will forget for the time, but you may call me Nurse Helen.  And I have the dearest father in the world whose name is John; so I will call you John.  Do you mind?\"  \"I should say not!\" said Zaidos.  \"You see, John,\" said Nurse Helen, \"every time I say that name I feel closer to my home and all the dear ones there.  Some day I will tell you about them all.\"  \"I wish you would,\" said Zaidos.  \"I have often wondered how your people could let a dandy girl like you get into this sort of thing.\" He wanted to say such a _pretty_ girl, but did not quite have the courage to do it.  \"You know you might even get hurt.\"  \"It's quite likely,\" said Helen simply.  \"One has to accept that chance.  And there _is_ a chance about everything.  A lot of the people in this war, dreadful as it is, will go home when it is over, and get run over by London busses, or fall down stairs, or things like that.\"  \"Or slip on banana peels,\" added Zaidos.  \"You are right about it.  I wonder I never thought of it before.\"  \"Who is Velo Kupenol?\" asked Helen.  \"Is he really your cousin?\"  \"My second cousin, to be exact,\" said Zaidos; \"He has lived at our house ever since he was a boy eight years old.  I don't exactly understand Velo lots of the time.\"  \"I wouldn't think he was too awfully hard to understand,\" said Helen.  \"Well, he is,\" said Zaidos.  \"He has been just nice to me ever since I was hurt, but he has done some of the queerest things.  And what he told the doctor about what happened the day we were in the water--Oh well, I can't explain it very well!\"  Zaidos was too modest to tell Helen that the account had simply been twisted around to Velo's advantage.  \"Don't try,\" commented Helen.  \"There is one thing I feel as though I ought to tell you.  That is, that I want you to watch that cousin of yours.  If we are doing him an injustice, we will find it out just so much sooner.  Otherwise it pays to be on guard.  Just tell me one thing, John.  If anything happened to you, would there be anything for Velo to gain by your death?\"  Zaidos looked uncomfortable.  \"Oh, I suppose so,\" he said.  \"Why, yes, to be honest with you, he would gain a lot.  But I can't--Oh, he wouldn't be such a sneak! Perhaps I had better tell you all about everything, now you have sort of adopted me.\"  \"Not if you think best not to,\" said Helen; \"but of course I would love to know all about you.\"  \"And I had better tell you,\" said Zaidos.  \"You see, I have no relatives at all except Velo, and we aren't too sure of him yet, are we?\"  He rapidly recounted the happenings of the past from the time the telegram reached him in far America.  Several times Helen interrupted with a keen question.  When Zaidos finished, she sighed.  \"Well, John,\" she said, \"as far as I can see, there is not a thing you can take as a real clue.  But it all looks queer, just the same. Sometimes everything _will_ happen so things look black.  That is why circumstantial evidence is always so dangerous.  But all the same, I worry over you.\"  \"Don't do that,\" said Zaidos.  \"I ought to be old enough to look out for myself.\"  \"What are you going to do when your leg heals?\" asked Helen.  \"I'm going to join the Red Cross,\" said Zaidos.  \"How perfectly fine!\" exclaimed Helen.  \"We will be posted together for awhile if you do, because the field hospitals at the front where I am going are very short handed.  Don't you suppose we could persuade Velo that his duty lies in some other sphere of action?\"  \"I don't believe so,\" said Zaidos.  \"No, I know we couldn't,\" said Helen.  \"He has repeatedly told me that he would never leave you.  Here he comes now.  Let's try it!\"  She smiled as Velo approached and drew himself up.  Nurse Helen was undeniably beautiful, even in her severe uniform.  No, Velo had _no_ intention of deserting his dear cousin.  If Zaidos joined the Red Cross, so would Velo.  It made no difference to him at all.  If Zaidos was stationed in the trench hospitals at the front, that was where _he_ would be found.  And two weeks later he actually did find himself there.  It was in one of the lulls between engagements, and they arrived with no more excitement or danger than might attend any summer trip.  But there they were, actually in the trenches.     CHAPTER VI  A LETTER HOME  Zaidos, who was still on sick list and walked with a cane, was nevertheless put to work, in order to familiarize him with the position of the trenches.  For two weeks the English had been expecting an attack, and the inaction was telling on the nerves of the officers.  The men are only kept under fire for four days.  At the end of that time, they are sent back a few miles in shifts to the nearest village where they find quarters, and rest from the nerve-racking, soul-shaking clamor of guns and buzz of bullets.  The trenches were wonderful. Zaidos and Velo, the Red Cross badges on their arms giving them free passage, soon explored every inch until they were perfectly familiar with them all.  Zaidos drew a sketch of the plan to send to the fellows in school.  First of all, and nearest the opposing force, is the line of the small trenches for the snipers or sharp-shooters.  These men, facing certain death in their little shelters, are picked shots, and keep up a steady, harassing fire at anything showing over the tops of the enemy's trenches or, failing that, at anything that looks like the crew of a rapid-fire gun.  These, of course, they guess at from the line of fire as the guns are placed in the first line of trenches in little pits of their own.  On his map Zaidos marked the positions of the guns with an A.  Behind the snipers are the barbed wire entanglements, a nightmare of tumbled wires piled high in cruel confusion.  Close behind this are the observation trenches.  There was no firing from these small trenches; they were simply what the name implied: look-outs.  Leaving these, and passing down the zig-zag connecting trench, the first line trench was reached.  This was fifty yards from the wire entanglements, and along here the rapid-fire guns were set.  [Illustration: Trench layout diagram]  When Zaidos and Velo made their first visit through the trenches, they were puzzled to see that the guns were all set at an angle, so that the line of fire intersected, usually just over the barbed wire entanglements.  Zaidos asked about it.  \"We protect our guns in that way,\" explained the young Lieutenant who accompanied them.  \"With the fire coming at an angle, it is difficult for the enemy to get the exact position of our guns, and they are unable to follow the line of our fire with their own fire, and so cripple us.  On the other hand, you notice that all trenches are either battlement shape or zig-zag.\"  \"I wondered why,\" said Zaidos.  \"Well, that is so a shot from the enemy, no matter what the angle, striking in a trench, will simply go a few feet, and plow into the bank of earth ahead of it.

The Siege of Gibraltar stands almost alone in the annals of warfare, alike in its duration and in the immense preparations made, by the united powers of France and Spain, for the capture of the fortress. A greater number of guns were employed than in any operation up to that time; although in number, and still more in calibre, the artillery then used have in, modern times, been thrown into the shade by the sieges of Sebastopol and Paris. Gibraltar differs, however, from these sieges, inasmuch as the defence was a successful one and, indeed, at no period of the investment was the fortress in any danger of capture, save by hunger.  At that period England was not, as she afterwards became, invincible by sea; and as we were engaged at the same time in war with France, Spain, Holland, and the United States, it was only occasionally that a fleet could be spared to bring succour and provisions to the beleaguered garrison. Scurvy was the direst enemy of the defenders. The art of preserving meat in tins had not been discovered, and they were forced to subsist almost entirely upon salt meat. During the first year of the siege the supply of fresh vegetables was scanty, in the extreme, and the garrison consequently suffered so severely, from scurvy, that at one time scarcely half of the men of the garrison were strong enough to carry a firelock, and perform their duty. The providential capture of a vessel laden with oranges and lemons checked the ravages of the scourge; and the successful efforts of the garrison to raise vegetables prevented it from ever, afterwards, getting a firm hold upon them.  In such a siege there was but little scope for deeds of individual gallantry. It was a long monotony of hardship and suffering, nobly endured, and terminating in one of the greatest triumphs ever recorded in the long roll of British victories.  G. A. Henty.    Chapter 1: \"Something Like An Adventure.\"   Had Mr. Tulloch, the headmaster and proprietor of a large school at Putney, been asked which was the most troublesome boy in his school, he would probably have replied, without hesitation, \"Bob Repton.\"  But, being a just and fair-minded man, he would have hastened to qualify this remark, by adding:  \"Most troublesome, but by no means the worst boy. You must understand that. He is always in scrapes, always in mischief. In all my experience I have never before come across a boy who had such an aptitude for getting into trouble; but I have nothing else to say against him. He is straightforward and manly. I have never known him to tell a lie, to screen himself. He is an example to many others in that way. I like the boy, in spite of the endless trouble he gives, and yet there is scarcely a day passes that I am not obliged to cane him; and even that does him no good, as far as I can see, for he seems to forget it, five minutes after it is over. I wonder, sometimes, if he has really got hardened, and doesn't feel it.  \"He is sharp, and does his lessons well. I have no difficulty with him, on that score; but he is a perfect imp of mischief.\"  With such characteristics, it need hardly be said that Bob Repton was one of the most popular boys at Tulloch's school.  School life was, in those days--for it was in August, 1778, that Bob was at Tulloch's--a very different thing to what it is, at present. Learning was thrashed into boys. It was supposed that it could only be instilled in this manner; and although some masters were, of course, more tyrannical and brutal than others, the cane was everywhere in use, and that frequently. Lads, then, had far less liberty and fewer sports than at present; but as boys' spirits cannot be altogether suppressed, even by the use of the cane, they found vent in other ways, and there was much more mischief, and more breaking out of bounds, than now take place. Boys were less trusted, and more harshly treated; in consequence of which there was a kind of warfare between the masters and the boys, in which the masters, in spite of their canes, did not always get the best of it.  Bob Repton was nearly fifteen. He was short, rather than tall for his age, but squarely built and strong. His hair could never be got to lie down, but bristled aggressively over his head. His nose was inclined to turn up, his gray eyes had a merry, mischievous expression, and his lips were generally parted in a smile. A casual observer would have said that he was a happy-go-lucky, merry, impudent-looking lad; but he was more than this. He was shrewd, intelligent, and exceptionally plucky; always ready to do a good turn to others, and to take more than his fair share of blame, for every scrape he got into. He had fought many battles, and that with boys older than himself, but he had never been beaten. The opinion, generally, among the boys was that he did not feel pain and, being caned so frequently, such punishment as he got in a fight was a mere trifle to him.  He was a thorn in the side of Mr. Purfleet, the usher who was generally in charge of the playground; who had learned by long experience that, whenever Bob Repton was quiet, he was certain to be planning some special piece of mischief. The usher was sitting now on a bench, with a book in his hand; but his attention was, at present, directed to a group of four boys who had drawn together in a corner of the playground.  \"There is Repton, again,\" he said to himself. \"I wonder what he is plotting, now. That boy will be the death of me. I am quite sure it was he who put that eel in my bed, last week; though of course, I could not prove it.\"  Mr. Purfleet prided himself on his nerve. He had been telling the boys some stories he had read of snakes, in India; among them, one of an officer who, when seated at table, had felt a snake winding itself round his leg, and who sat for several minutes without moving, until some friends brought a saucer of milk and placed it near, when the snake uncurled itself and went to drink.  \"It must have required a lot of nerve, Mr. Purfleet,\" Bob Repton had said, \"to sit as quiet as that.\"  \"Not at all, not at all,\" the usher replied, confidently. \"It was the natural thing to do. A man should always be calm, in case of sudden danger, Bob. The first thought in his mind should be, 'What is this?' the second, 'What had best be done, under the circumstances?' and, these two things being decided, a man of courage will deal coolly with the danger. I should despise myself, if I were to act otherwise.\"  It was two nights later that the usher, having walked down between the two rows of beds in the dormitory, and seeing that all the boys were quiet, and apparently asleep, proceeded to his own bed, which was at the end of the room, and partly screened off from the rest by a curtain. No sooner did he disappear behind this than half a dozen heads were raised. An oil lamp burned at the end of the room, affording light for the usher to undress; and enabling him, as he lay in bed, to command a general, if somewhat faint view of the dormitory. Five minutes after Mr. Purfleet had disappeared behind the curtain, the watching eyes saw the clothes at the end of the bed pulled down, and caught a partial view of Mr. Purfleet as he climbed in. A second later there was a yell of terror, and the usher leapt from the bed. Instantly, the dormitory was in an uproar.  \"What is it, Mr. Purfleet--what is the matter, sir?\" and several of the boys sprang from their beds, and ran towards him; the only exceptions to the general excitement being the four or five who were in the secret. These lay shaking with suppressed laughter, with the bedclothes or the corner of a pillow thrust into their mouths, to prevent them from breaking out into screams of delight.  \"What is it, sir?\"  It was some time before the usher could recover himself sufficiently to explain.  \"There is a snake in my bed,\" he said.  \"A snake!\" the boys repeated, in astonishment, several of the more timid at once making off to their beds.  \"Certainly, a snake,\" Mr. Purfleet panted. \"I put my legs down, and they came against something cold, and it began to twist about. In a moment, if I had not leapt out, I should no doubt have received a fatal wound.\"  \"Where did it come from?\"  \"What is to be done?\"  And a variety of other questions burst from the boys.  \"I will run down and get three or four hockey sticks, Mr. Purfleet,\" one of the elder boys said.  \"That will be the best plan, Mason. Quick, quick! There, do you see it moving, under the clothes?\"  There was certainly"]]]
