While passing over London on one occasion at night, at the height of about one mile, he heard the hum of the great city, and saw its lights. The river looked dull, but the bridges that spanned it, and the many miles of straight, intersecting, and winding streets were distinctly visible.  In referring to sound, he tells us that, on different occasions, at a height of 11,800 feet above the earth, a band was heard playing.  At between four and five thousand feet a railway whistle and the shouting of people were heard, and at 10,070 feet the report of a gun.  A dog was also heard barking at a height of two miles.  At a height of 19,000 feet the hands and lips were observed, during one ascent, to be of a dark bluish colour.  At four miles the palpitations of the heart were audible, and the breathing was affected.  Considerable difficulty was experienced in respiration at higher elevations.  From his various observations he found that the effect of high elevation is different upon the same individuals at different times, and believed that, up to heights less than three miles--to which persons of ordinary self-possession might ascend--delicate and accurate scientific observations might be made with ease, but at heights approaching to four miles, such observations could not be made so well, because of the personal distress of the observer, and on approaching to five miles above the earth it required the exercise of a strong will to take any observations at all.  The most wonderful and alarming of the experiences of Mr Glaisher appear to have occurred to him and his companion, Mr Coxwell, during an ascent made from Wolverhampton on the 5th September, when they reached the enormous elevation of between six and seven miles.  They felt no particular inconvenience until after passing above the fifth mile.  When at a height of 26,000 feet, Mr Glaisher could not see the column of mercury in the tube; then the fine divisions on the scale of the instrument became invisible.  Shortly afterwards he laid his arm on the table, and on attempting again to use it found that the limb was powerless.  He tried to move the other arm, and found that it also was paralysed.  He then tried to shake himself, and succeeded in shaking his body, but experienced the curious sensation of having no legs!  While in this condition he attempted to look at the barometer, and, while doing so, his head fell on his left shoulder.  Struggling to get out of this lethargic state, he found that he could still shake his body, although he could not move either arms or legs.  He got his head upright for an instant, but it dropped again on his shoulder, and he fell backwards, his back resting against the side of the car, and his head on its edge.  In this position his eyes were directed to Mr Coxwell, who did not at first observe the state of his companion, in consequence of his having had to ascend into the ring of the balloon to disentangle the valve-line, which had become twisted.  Hitherto Mr Glaisher had retained the power of moving the muscles of his back and neck, but suddenly this was lost to him.  He saw Mr Coxwell dimly in the ring, and attempted to speak to him, but could not do so.  A moment later intense black darkness surrounded him--the optic nerve had lost its power!  He was still conscious, however, and with his brain as active as at other times.  He fancied he had been seized with asphyxia, and that death would quickly ensue unless they descended without delay.  Suddenly the power of thought ceased, and he became unconscious.  All these extraordinary and alarming sensations, he calculated, must have taken place within five or six minutes.  While still powerless he heard the words \"temperature\" and \"observation,\" and knew that Mr Coxwell was in the car endeavouring to arouse him.  Presently he heard him speak more emphatically, but could neither see, reply, nor move.  Then he heard him say, \"Do try now, do,\" after which vision slightly returned, and in a short time he saw clearly again, rose from his seat, looked round, and said to Mr Coxwell, \"I have been insensible.\"  His friend replied, \"You have, and I too, very nearly.\"  Mr Coxwell had lost the use of his hands, which were black; Mr Glaisher, therefore, poured brandy over them.  His companion then told him that, on descending from the ring, he thought he had laid himself back to rest, but noticing that his legs projected, and his arms hung down by his side, it struck him there was something wrong, and he attempted to go to his assistance, but felt insensibility coming over himself.  He tried to open the valve, so that they might descend, but, having lost the use of his hands, could not.  In this critical moment he seized the cord with his teeth, dipped his head two or three times, and thus succeeded in opening the valve, and descending from those dangerous regions of attenuated atmosphere!  At first they went down at the tremendous rate of twenty miles an hour, but after descending three miles in nine minutes, the balloon's progress was checked, and they finally alighted safely in a grass field, where their appearance so terrified the country folk that it required a good deal of coaxing in plain English to convince them that the aeronauts were not inhabitants of another world!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  _Exeter Hall Lectures--Scientific Experiments in Balloons_, by James Glaisher, Esquire, F.R.S.--Published by James Nisbet and Company, London.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  ACCOUNT OF NADAR'S BALLOON, \"LE GEANT.\"  FIRST ASCENT.  As the \"Giant\" is the largest balloon that has yet been made, and as its experiences on the occasions of its first and second ascents were not only peculiar but terrible, we shall give an account of it in detail-- commencing with its construction, and ending with the thrilling termination of its brief but wild career.  Monsieur Nadar, a photographer of Paris, was the enthusiastic and persevering aeronaut who called it into being, and encountered the perils of its ascents, from which he did not emerge scatheless, as we shall see.  Besides being an experimental voyager in cloudland, Monsieur Nadar started a newspaper named _L'Aeronaute_, in which he gives an account of the \"Giant,\" and his reasons for constructing it.  These latter were peculiar.  He is emphatic in asserting that the huge balloon was never intended by him to be an \"end,\" but a mere stepping-stone to an end--which end was the construction of an _aeromotive_--a machine which was to be driven by means of a screw, and which he intended should supersede balloons altogether, so that his own \"Giant\" was meant to be the last of its race!  In reference to this, Monsieur Nadar tells us that he was deeply impressed with the belief that the screw would ultimately become our aerial motor, but that, being ignorant of what it was likely the experiments of this first aeromotive would cost, he had resolved, instead of begging for funds to enable him to accomplish his great end, to procure funds for himself in the following manner:--  \"I shall,\" says he, \"make a balloon--the _last balloon_--in proportions extraordinarily gigantic, twenty times larger than the largest, which shall realise that which has never been but a dream in the American journals, which shall attract, in France, England, and America, the crowd always ready to run to witness the most insignificant ascent.  In order to add further to the interest of the spectacle--which, I declare beforehand, without fear of being belied, shall be the most beautiful spectacle which it has ever been given to man to contemplate,--I shall dispose under this monster balloon a small balloon (_balloneau_), destined to receive and preserve the excess of gas produced by dilation, instead of losing this excess, as has hitherto been the case, which will permit my balloon to undertake veritable long voyages, instead of remaining in the air two or three hours only, like our predecessors.  I do not wish to ask anything of any one, nor of the State, to aid me, even in this question of general, and also of such immense, interest.  I shall endeavour to furnish myself the two hundred thousand francs necessary for the construction of my balloon.  The said balloon finished, by public ascents and successive exhibitions at Paris, London, Brussels, Vienna, Baden, Berlin, New York, and everywhere, I know that I shall collect ten times the funds necessary for the construction of our first aeromotive.\"  This first aeromotive, however, has not yet made its appearance, whether from want of funds or of practicability we do not know, but Monsieur Nadar carried his designs triumphantly into effect with the \"monster balloon,\" which in course of time made its appearance, performed flights, attracted the wonder and admiration, as well as a good deal of the coin, of hundreds of thousands in France and England, even conveyed royalty up into the clouds, broke the bones of its originator, and was exhibited in the great transept (which it nearly filled) of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.  While there, we had the good fortune to behold it with our own eyes!  The construction of this balloon merits particular notice; but first, it may be remarked that it is well worthy of being named a giant, seeing that its height was only forty-five feet less than that of the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral, namely 196 feet.  That Nadar had cut out for himself an arduous task will be readily believed.  Touching on this, he writes thus:--  \"I have set myself to work immediately, and with difficulties, sleepless nights, vexations which I have kept to myself alone to this hour, and which some one of the days of this winter, the most urgent part of my task being finished, I shall in part make in confidence to my readers.

Ballantyne (1825-1894), 1893.  ________________________________________________________________________  This book is full of action.  It deals with both a tribe of Red Indians, of the Dogrib nation, and a tribe of Eskimos.  Normally a certain animosity existed between these two, but this tale relates how under certain circumstances, members of these tribes could not only become close friends, and work together towards a common goal, but also intermarry.  There is no doubt but that the reader will have a greater knowledge of the ways and thoughts of the Indian and the Eskimo, and kindly feelings towards both, after reading this book--an easy task, for it is a good and absorbing read.  In this little preface we have deliberately used the old-fashioned terms for the two races, fully aware that they are both inexact, and that today we would, for instance, use the term Inuit instead of Eskimo. However, this book was written in 1893, and things were different then.  It has been written of Ballantyne that, in the last years before his death in 1894, the quality of his work was failing and indeed repetitive.  Anyone reading this book can see that this is untrue, for it is one of his very best.  Indeed it is a strange thing that his earlier books, which were well-promoted upon their publication, should still be so much more read than his later ones.  While working upon this edition of \"The Walrus Hunters\" we found ourselves several times reflecting upon this strange state of affairs.  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northern Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the H.B.C.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.  ________________________________________________________________________  THE WALRUS HUNTERS, A TALE OF LIFE ON THE ARCTIC SHORES OF CANADA, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  A ROMANCE OF THE ICE-WORLD.  A SURPRISE, A COMBAT, AND A FEED.  There is a river in America which flows to the north-westward of Great Bear Lake, and helps to drain that part of the great wilderness into the Arctic Sea.  It is an insignificant stream compared with such well-known waterways as the Mackenzie and the Coppermine; nevertheless it is large enough to entice the white-whale and the seal into its waters every spring, and it becomes a resting-place for myriads of wild-fowl while on their passage to and from the breeding-grounds of the Far North.  Greygoose River was the name given to it by the Dogrib Indians who dwelt in its neighbourhood, and who were wont, every spring and autumn, to descend its waters nearly to the sea in quest of game.  The Eskimos, who, coming from the mysterious north, were in the habit of ascending it a short way during open water in pursuit of their peculiar prey, named it Whale River.  The Indians and Eskimos did not often meet while on these trips.  They did not like meeting, because the result was apt to be disastrous. Besides, the land was wide and the game plentiful enough for both, so that they were not much tempted to risk a meeting.  Occasionally, however, meetings and encounters did take place, and sometimes bitter feuds arose, but the possession of fire-arms by the Indians--who were supplied by the fur-traders--rendered the Eskimos wary.  Their headstrong courage, however, induced the red men to keep as much as possible out of their way.  In short, there was a good deal of the spirit of \"let-be for let-be\" between the two at the time of which we write.  One morning in the spring-time of the year, soon after the floods caused by the melting snows had swept the ice clean out of Greygoose or Whale River, a sturdy young Eskimo urged his sharp kayak, or skin-covered canoe, up the stream in pursuit of a small white-whale.  But the creature gave him the slip, so that, after an energetic chase, he turned his light vessel towards the left bank of the stream, intending to land.  Cheenbuk, for such was his name, was one of those sedate beings whose energies run calm and deep, like a mighty river.  This feelings, whatever they might be, did not usually cause much agitation on the surface.  Disappointment did not visibly depress, nor did success unduly elate him.  The loss of the whale failed to disturb the placid look of grave contentment which sat on his good-looking countenance.  For it must be noted here that Cheenbuk was a handsome savage--if, indeed, we are entitled to style him a savage at all.  His features were good, and strongly marked.  His young beard and moustache were black, though not bushy.  His dark eyes were large and full of tenderness, which expression, by an almost imperceptible raising of eyelid and contraction of brow, was easily transmuted into a gaze of ferocity or indignation.  His bulky frame was clothed in the seal-skin garb peculiar to his people; his hair was straight, voluminous, and unkempt, and his motions gave indication of great strength combined with agility.  And no wonder, for a large part of our young Eskimo's life had been spent in battling with the forces of Nature, and the hardships of life as displayed in the Arctic regions--to say nothing of frequent conflicts with the seal, the walrus and the polar bear.  Running his kayak among the rushes of a small inlet, Cheenbuk stepped out of the hole in its centre into the stream.  The water was ankle-deep, but the youth suffered no discomfort, for he wore what may be styled home-made waterproof boots reaching to above the knees.  These had been invented by his forefathers, no doubt, in the remote ages of antiquity--at all events, long before india-rubber had been discovered or Macintosh was born.  Drawing his little craft out of the water, the young man took some food from its interior, and was about to begin his truly simple meal by eating it raw, when a distant sound arrested his hand on the way to his mouth.  He turned his head slightly on one side and remained for some moments like a singularly attentive statue.  Presently the voice of a wild-goose was faintly heard in the far distance.  Evidently the young Eskimo desired a change of fare, for he laid down the slice of raw seal, on which he had been about to regale himself, and disengaged a long slender spear from the bow of his kayak.  It is well-known that wild-geese will, with proverbial stupidity, answer to an imitation of their cry, particularly in spring.  Indeed, they will answer to a very bad imitation of it, insomuch that the poorest counterfeit will turn them out of their course and attract them towards the crier.  Availing himself of this weakness, our Eskimo hid himself behind a bush, and was opening his mouth to give vent to a stentorian goose-call when he was checked, and apparently petrified, by a loud report, which echoed among the neighbouring cliffs.  The youth knew the sound well.  He had heard it only once before, but, once heard, it could never be forgotten.  It was the gun, or, as his people called it, the fire-spouter, of an Indian.  Plunging quietly into the underwood, he hastened towards the spot where a little wreath of smoke betrayed the position of what may be almost styled his hereditary foe.  Cautiously, carefully, and with a catlike motion that could hardly have been excelled by an Indian brave, Cheenbuk advanced until he reached the edge of a partially clear space, in which he beheld an Indian leisurely engaged in pushing the head "]]]
