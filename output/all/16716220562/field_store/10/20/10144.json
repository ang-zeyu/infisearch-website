Ned's bruised, burned, and lacerated frame was concealed under a patchwork coverlet.  Only his face was visible, but that, although the least injured part of his body, was so deadly pale that even Mr Sparks was solemnised by the supposition that he was in the presence of Death.  \"Oh, Ned, Ned!\" exclaimed Maggie, unable to repress her grief, \"can you--can you ever forgive me?\"  She laid her hand on the fireman's broad breast, and passionately kissed his brow.  He opened his eyes, and whispered with difficulty, \"Forgive you, Maggie? God for ever bless you.\"  He could say no more, owing to excessive weakness.  \"Come, missus, you mustn't disturb him,\" said David Clazie, emerging from behind the curtains at the foot of the bed.  \"The doctor's orders was strict--to keep 'im quiet.  You'd better go into the other room, an' your brother likewise.  Pr'aps you might send 'im to tell Joe Dashwood to be ready.\"  David Clazie, who was more a man of action than of words, quietly, but firmly, ejected the brother and sister from the little room while he was speaking, and, having shut the door, sat down at his post again as a guard over his sick comrade.  \"Seems to me it's all up with 'im,\" observed Sparks, as he stood gazing uneasily into the fire.  As Mrs Crashington replied only by sobbing, he continued, after a few minutes--  \"Does the doctor say it's all up, Mag?\"  \"No, oh no,\" replied the poor woman, \"he don't quite say so; but I can't git no comfort from that.  Ned has lost _such_ a quantity of blood, it seems impossible for him to git round.  They're goin' to try a operation on 'im to-day, but I can't understand it, an' don't believe in it.  They talk of puttin' noo blood into 'im!  An' that reminds me that the doctor is to be here at twelve.  Do run round, Phil, to the Dashwoods, and tell Joe to be here in good time.\"  \"What's Joe wanted for?\"  \"Never mind, but go and tell him that.  I can't talk just now,\" she said, pushing her brother out of the room.  Tapping at Joe Dashwood's door, Phil received from a strong, deep voice permission to \"come in.\"  He entered, and found a very different state of things from that which he had just left.  A bright room, and bright, happy faces.  The windows were bright, which made the light appear brighter than usual; the grate was bright; the furniture was bright; the face of the clock, whose interior seemed about to explode on every occasion of striking the hour, was bright--almost to smiling; and the pot-lids, dish-covers, etcetera, were bright--so bright as to be absolutely brilliant.  Joe Dashwood and his little wife were conversing near the window, but, although their faces were unquestionably bright by reason of contentment, coupled with a free use of soap and the jack-towel, there was, nevertheless, a shade of sadness in their looks and tones.  Nothing of the sort, however, appeared on the countenances of the Rosebud and young Fred Crashington.  These gushing little offshoots of the Red Brigade were too young to realise the danger of Ned's condition, but they were quite old enough to create an imaginary fire in the cupboard, which they were wildly endeavouring to extinguish with a poker for a \"branch\" and a bucket for a fire-engine, when Mr Sparks entered.  \"Oh! kik, Feddy, kik; put it out kik, or it'll bu'n down all 'e house,\" cried little May, eagerly, as she tossed back a cataract of golden curls from her flushed countenance, and worked away at the handle of the bucket with all her might.  \"All right!\" shouted Fred, who had been sent to play with the Rosebud that he might be out of the way.  \"Down with Number 1; that's your sort; keep 'er goin'; hooray!\"  He brought the poker down with an awful whack on the cupboard at this point, causing the crockery to rattle again.  \"Hallo! youngster, mind what you're about,\" cried Joe, \"else there will be more damage caused by the engine than the fire--not an uncommon thing, either, in our practice!\"  It was at this point that he replied to Mr Sparks's knock.  \"Come in, Mr Sparks, you've heard of your poor brother-in-law's accident, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, I've just comed from his house with a message.  You're wanted to be there in good time.\"  \"All right, I'll be up to time,\" said Joe, putting on his coat and cap, and smiling to his wife, as he added, \"It's a queer sort o' thing to do. We'll be blood-relations, Ned and I, after this.  Look after these youngsters, Molly, else they'll knock your crockery to bits.  Good-day. Mr Sparks.\"  \"Good-day,\" replied Sparks, as Joe went out.  Then, turning to Mrs Dashwood, \"What sort of operation is it they're goin' to perform on Ned?\"  \"Did you not hear?  It's a very curious one.  Ned has lost so much blood from a deep cut in his leg that the doctors say he can't recover, no matter how strong his constitution is, unless he gits some blood put into him, so they're goin' to put some o' my Joe's blood into him.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Sparks, \"take blood out o' your husband and put it hot and livin' into Ned?  No, no, I've got a pretty big swallow, but I can't git _that_ down.\"  \"If you can't swallow it you'll have to bolt it, then, for it's a fact,\" returned Mary, with a laugh.  \"But how do they mean to go about it?\" asked Sparks, with an unbelieving expression of countenance.  \"Well, I ain't quite sure about that,\" replied Mary; \"they say that the doctor cuts a hole in a vein of the arms of both men, and puts a pipe, or something of that sort, into the two veins, and so lets the blood run from the one man into the other.  I don't half believe it myself, to say truth; but it's quite true that they're goin' to try it on Ned.  The doctor says it has bin tried before with great success, and that the main thing is to get a stout, healthy young man to take the blood from. They thought, at first, to get a healthy youth from the country, but my Joe begged so hard to let him supply his friend and comrade, with what they wanted, that they agreed, and now he's off to have it done.  Ain't it funny?\"  \"Funny!\" exclaimed Sparks, \"well, it is, just.  But I'm not such a fool as to believe that they can pump the blood out o' one man into another in that fashion.\"  \"I hope they can for poor Ned's sake,\" said Mary, in a sad tone, as she stirred a large pot which stood simmering on the fire.  There was a short silence after that, for Mary was thinking of the strange operation that was probably going on at that moment, and Phil Sparks was debating with himself as to the propriety of attempting to induce Mrs Dashwood to lend him a shilling or two.  He could not easily make up his mind, however; not because he was ashamed to ask it, but, because he was afraid of receiving a rebuke from the pretty little woman.  He knew that she and Martha Reading were intimate friends, and he had a suspicion that Mrs Dashwood was aware of Martha's fondness for him, and that she bore him no good will in consequence.  Besides, although one of the sweetest tempered women in London, Mary was one whose indignation could be roused, and whose clear blue eye had something overawing in it, especially to scoundrels.  He therefore sat there more than an hour, conversing on various subjects, while Mary busied herself in household matters; which she occasionally left off in order to assist in extinguishing the fire in the cupboard!  At last Sparks resolved to make the attempt, and thought he would begin by trying to propitiate Mary by commenting on her child.  \"That's a pretty little girl of yours, missis,\" he remarked in a casual way.  \"That she is,\" cried Mary, catching up the child and kissing her rosy face all over; \"and she's better than pretty--she's good, good as gold.\"  \"Oh 'top, ma.  Let May down, kik!  Fire not out yit!\"  \"That's right, never give in, May.  Wot a jolly fireman you'd make!\" cried Fred, still directing all his energies to the cupboard.  \"That's a queer sort o' helmet the boy's got on,\" said Sparks, alluding to a huge leathern headpiece, of a curious old-fashioned form, which was rolling about on the boy's head, being much too large for him.  \"It was bought for him by my Joe, in an old curiosity shop,\" said Mary.  \"Ha!\" replied Sparks.  \"Well, Missis Dashwood, I'll have to be goin', though I haven't got no business to attend to--still, a man must keep movin' about, you know, specially w'en he's had no breakfast, an' han't got nothin' to buy one.\"  \"That's a sad condition,\" said Mary, pursing her lips, for she knew the man.  \"It is, missis.  You couldn't lend me half-a-crown, could you?\"  \"No, I couldn't,\" replied the little woman with decision, while her cheeks reddened; \"moreover, I wouldn't if I could.  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr Sparks; it's a disgrace for a man of your strength and years to be goin' about borrowing as you're in the habit of doin'; and you have got the impudence, too, to be running after poor Martha Reading, but you shall never get her if I can prevent it.\"  Mr Sparks was much nettled by the first part of Mrs Dashwood's speech. The last part put him in a towering passion.  He started up, but had the wisdom to restrain himself to some extent.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, between his teeth, \"you _can't_ prevent it, missis.\"  \"Perhaps not, but I shall try.\"  At that moment, Master Fred Crashington chanced to stumble in his energetic attempts to extinguish the fire in the cupboard, which the Rosebud assured him, in excited tones, was \"not out yit; gittin' wus an' wus!\"  In falling, the old-fashioned helmet flew off, and the comb of it hit Mr Sparks a severe blow on the shin-bone.  In the heat of the moment he dealt Fred a violent slap on the cheek, which sent him tumbling and howling on the floor.  At that moment the door opened and Joe Dashwood entered.  He had heard the noise before entering, and now stood with a stern frown on his face as he gazed at his wife and her visitor.  \"Did _you_ do that?\" he demanded of Sparks, pointing to the little boy.  \"He did, Joe,\" said Mary; \"but--\"  Joe waited "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21696"],["title","Red Rooney: The Last of the Crew (#0)"],["body","ROONEY, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.  A Tale of Eskimo (Innuit) Life in Greenland at the end of the Eighteenth Century.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE LAST OF THE CREW.  LOST AND FOUND.  There is a particular spot in those wild regions which lie somewhere near the northern parts of Baffin's Bay, where Nature seems to have set up her workshop for the manufacture of icebergs, where Polar bears, in company with seals and Greenland whales, are wont to gambol, and where the family of Jack Frost may be said to have taken permanent possession of the land.  One winter day, in the early part of the eighteenth century, a solitary man might have been seen in that neighbourhood, travelling on foot over the frozen sea in a staggering, stumbling, hurried manner, as if his powers, though not his will, were exhausted.  The man's hairy garb of grey sealskin might have suggested that he was a denizen of those northern wilds, had not the colour of his face, his brown locks, and his bushy beard, betokened him a native of a very different region.  Although possessing a broad and stalwart frame, his movements indicated, as we have said, excessive weakness.  A morsel of ice in his path, that would have been no impediment even to a child, caused him to stumble. Recovering himself, with an evidently painful effort, he continued to advance with quick, yet wavering steps.  There was, however, a strange mixture of determination with his feebleness.  Energy and despair seemed to be conjoined in his look and action--and no wonder, for Red Rooney, although brave and resolute by nature, was alone in that Arctic wilderness, and reduced to nearly the last extremity by fatigue and famine.  For some days--how many he scarcely remembered--he had maintained life by chewing a bit of raw sealskin as he travelled over the frozen waste; but this source of strength had at last been consumed, and he was now sinking from absolute want.  The indomitable spirit of the man, however, kept his weakened body moving, even after the mind had begun to sink into that dreamy, lethargic state which is said to indicate the immediate approach of death, and there was still a red spot in each of his pale and hollow cheeks, as well as an eager gleam of hope in his sunken eyes; for the purpose that Red Rooney had in view was to reach the land.  It was indeed a miserably faint hope that urged the poor fellow on, for the desolate shore of Western Greenland offered little better prospect of shelter than did the ice-clad sea; but, as in the case of the drowning man, he clutched at this miserable straw of hope, and held on for life.  There was the bare possibility that some of the migratory Eskimos might be there, or, if not, that some scraps of their food--some bits of refuse, even a few bones--might be found.  Death, he felt, was quickly closing with him on the sea.  The great enemy might, perhaps, be fought with and kept at bay for a time if he could only reach the land.  Encouraging himself with such thoughts, he pushed on, but again stumbled and fell--this time at full length.  He lay quiet for a few seconds.  It was so inexpressibly sweet to _rest_, and feel the worn-out senses floating away, as it were, into dreamland!  But the strong will burst the tightening bands of death, and, rising once more, with the exclamation, \"God help me!\" he resumed his weary march.  All around him the great ocean was covered with its coat of solid, unbroken ice; for although winter was past, and the sun of early spring was at the time gleaming on bergs that raised their battlements and pinnacles into a bright blue sky, the hoary king of the far north refused as yet to resign his sceptre and submit to the interregnum of the genial sun.  A large hummock or ridge of ice lay in front of the man, blocking his view of the horizon in that direction.  It had probably been heaved up by one of the convulsions of the previous autumn, and was broken into a chaotic mass.  Here he stopped and looked up, with a sigh.  But the sinking of the heart was momentary.  Deep snow had so filled up the crevices of the shattered blocks that it was possible to advance slowly by winding in and out among them.  As the ascent grew steeper the forlorn man dropped on all-fours and crawled upwards until he reached the top.  The view that burst upon him would have roused enthusiasm if his situation had been less critical.  Even as it was, an exclamation of surprise broke from him, for there, not five miles distant, was the coast of Greenland; desolate, indeed, and ice-bound--he had expected that--but inexpressibly grand even in its desolation.  A mighty tongue of a great glacier protruded itself into the frozen sea.  The tip of this tongue had been broken off, and the edge presented a gigantic wall of crystal several hundred feet high, on which the sun glittered in blinding rays.  This tongue--a mere offshoot of the great glacier itself--filled a valley full ten miles in length, measuring from its tip in the ocean to its root on the mountain brow, where the snow-line was seen to cut sharply against the sky.  For some minutes Red Rooney sat on one of the ice-blocks, gazing with intense eagerness along the shore, in the hope of discerning smoke or some other evidence of man's presence.  But nothing met his disappointed gaze save the same uniform, interminable waste of white and grey, with here and there a few dark frowning patches where the cliffs were too precipitous to sustain the snow.  Another despairing sigh rose to the man's lips, but these refused to give it passage.  With stern resolve he arose and stumbled hurriedly forward.  The strain, however, proved too great.  On reaching the level ice on the other side of the ridge he fell, apparently for the last time, and lay perfectly still.  Ah! how many must have fallen thus, to rise no more, since men first began to search out the secrets of that grand mysterious region!  But Red Rooney was not doomed to be among those who have perished there. Not far from the spot where he fell, one of the short but muscular and hairy-robed denizens of that country was busily engaged in removing the skin from a Polar bear which he had just succeeded in spearing, after a combat which very nearly cost him his life.  During the heat of the battle the brave little man's foot had slipped, and the desperately wounded monster, making a rush at the moment, overturned him into a crevice between two ice-blocks, fortunately the impetus of the rush caused the animal to shoot into another crevice beyond, and the man, proving more active than the bear, sprang out of his hole in time to meet his foe with a spear-thrust so deadly that it killed him on the spot.  Immediately he began to skin the animal, intending to go home with the skin, and return with a team of dogs for the meat and the carcass of a recently-caught seal.  Meanwhile, having removed and packed up the bear-skin, he swung it on his broad shoulders, and made for the shore as fast as his short legs would carry him.  On the way he came to the spot where the fallen traveller lay.  His first act was to open his eyes to the uttermost, and, considering the small, twinkling appearance of those eyes just a minute before, the change was marvellous.  \"Hoi!\" then burst from him with tremendous emphasis, after which he dropped his bundle, turned poor Rooney over on his back, and looked at his face with an expression of awe.  \"Dead!\" said the Eskimo, under his breath--in his own tongue, of course, not in English, of which, we need scarcely add, he knew nothing.  After feeling the man's breast, under his coat, for a few seconds, he murmured the word \"Kablunet\" (foreigner), and shook his head mournfully.  It was not so much grief for the man's fate that agitated this child of the northern wilderness, as regret at his own bad fortune.  Marvellous were the reports which from the south of Greenland had reached him, in his far northern home, of the strange Kablunets or foreigners who had arrived there to trade with the Eskimos--men who, so the reports went, wore smooth coats without hair, little round things on their heads instead of hoods, and flapping things on their legs instead of sealskin boots--men who had come in monster kayaks (canoes), as big as icebergs; men who seemed to possess everything, had the power to do anything, and feared nothing.  No fabrications in the _Arabian Nights_, or _Gulliver_, or _Baron Munchausen_, ever transcended the stories about those Kablunets which had reached this broad, short, sturdy Eskimo--stories which no doubt began in the south of Greenland with a substratum of truth, but which, in travelling several hundreds of miles northward, had grown, as a snowball might have grown if rolled the same distance over the Arctic wastes; with this difference--that whereas the snowball would have retained its original shape, though not its size, the tales lost not only their pristine form and size, but became so amazingly distorted that the original reporters would probably have failed to recognise them.  And now, at last, here was actually a Kablunet--a _real_ foreigner in the body; but not alive!  It was extremely disappointing!  Our sturdy Eskimo, however, was not a good judge of Kablunet vitality. He was yet rubbing the man's broad chest, with a sort of pathetic pity, when a flutter of the heart startled him.  He rubbed with more vigour. He became excited, and, seizing Red Rooney by the arms, shook him with considerable violence, the result being that the foreigner opened his eyes and looked at him inquiringly.  \"Hallo, my lad,\" said Rooney, in a faint voice; \"not quite so hard.  I'm all right.  Just help me up, like a good fellow.\"  He spoke in English, which was, of course, a waste of breath in the circumstances.  In proof of his being \"all right,\" he fell back again, and fainted away.  The Eskimo leaped up.  He was one of those energetic beings who seem to know in all emergencies what is best to be done, and do it promptly. Unrolling the "]]]
