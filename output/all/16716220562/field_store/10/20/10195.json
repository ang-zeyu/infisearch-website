In Dr Thomson's _History of Chemistry_, an anecdote, related by Mr Benjamin Bell, refers to this as follows:--  \"Soon after the appearance of Mr Cavendish's paper on hydrogen gas, in which he made an approximation to the specific gravity of that body, showing that it was at least ten times lighter than common air, Dr Black invited a party of friends to supper, informing them that he had a curiosity to show them.  Dr Hutton, Mr Clerk of Eldin, and Sir George Clerk of Penicuik, were of the number.  When the company invited had arrived, he took them into a room where he had the allantois of a calf filled with hydrogen gas, and, upon setting it at liberty, it immediately ascended and adhered to the ceiling.  The phenomenon was easily accounted for; it was taken for granted that a small black thread had been attached to the allantois, that the thread passed through the ceiling, and that some one in the apartment above, by pulling the thread, elevated it to the ceiling, and kept it in its position!  This explanation was so plausible, that it was agreed to by the whole company, though, like many other plausible theories, it turned out wholly fallacious, for, when the allantois was brought down, no thread whatever was found attached to it.  Dr Black explained the cause of the ascent to his admiring friends; but such was his carelessness of his own reputation, that he never gave the least account of this curious experiment even to his class, and several years elapsed before this obvious property of hydrogen gas was applied to the elevation of balloons.\"  Cavallo made the first practical attempts with hydrogen gas six years later, but he only succeeded in causing soap-bubbles to ascend.  At last the art of aerial navigation was discovered in France, and in 1782 the first ascent was made.  The triumph was achieved by Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, sons of a wealthy paper-maker who dwelt at Annonay, on the banks of a rivulet which flows into the Rhone, not far from Lyons.  These brothers were remarkable men.  Although bred in a remote provincial town, and without the benefit of a liberal education, they were possessed in a high degree of ingenuity and the spirit of observation.  They educated themselves, and acquired an unusually large stock of information, which their inventive and original minds led them to apply in new fields of speculation.  They were associated in business with their father, a man who passed his quiet days like a patriarch amidst a large family and a numerous body of dependants, until he reached the advanced age of ninety-three.  Stephen devoted himself chiefly to the study of mathematics, Joseph to chemistry; and they were accustomed to form their plans in concert.  It appears that they had long contemplated, with philosophical interest, the floating and ascent of clouds in the air, and when they heard of or read Cavendish's theories in regard to _different kinds of air_, it at once struck them that by enclosing some gas lighter than the atmosphere in a bag, a weight might be raised from the earth into the air.  The brothers Montgolfier were men of that vigorous stamp who act promptly on receiving their convictions.  At once they set about experimenting, and constructed large bags of paper,--the substance which naturally came readiest to their hands, and which appeared to them to be best suited to their purpose.  These were filled with hydrogen gas, which raised them to the ceiling; but, owing to the escape of the gas through the pores and cracks of the case, those embryo balloons descended in a few minutes.  Instead of varnishing the paper to prevent the escape of the gas, and supposing, erroneously, that the fault lay in the latter, they sought about for a new gas more suitable to the paper. This they found, as they supposed, in the gas which resulted from the combustion of wet straw and wool, which had an upward tendency, they thought, on account of its electrical properties, which caused it to be repelled from the ground.  It is scarcely necessary now to point out that the true cause of the upward tendency lay in the rarefaction of the air by the heat of the fire, and that hot air has a tendency to rise because its bulk is greatly increased beyond the same quantity of the surrounding cold air.  Although wrong in assigning the cause of the result, they were right in the application of it.  While on a visit to Avignon Joseph Montgolfier procured a silk bag having a small opening at its lower end, and a capacity of about fifty cubic feet.  Under the orifice some paper was burnt; the air inside was heated and expanded so as to fill the bag, which, when let go, soared rapidly up to the height of seventy or eighty feet, where it remained until the air cooled and allowed it to descend. Thus did the _first_ balloon ascend in the month of November 1782.  Delighted with their success, the indefatigable brothers resolved to make further experiment on a larger scale.  They procured a quantity of packcloth or coarse linen, formed it into a globe about ninety feet in circumference, lined it with paper, and lighted a fire under it in an iron choffer.  This balloon went up with a force which they estimated as equivalent to 500 pounds.  After this the Montgolfiers appeared to have become ambitious of accomplishing greater things, and giving to their discoveries publicity; for we are told that, \"they invited the members of the provincial meeting of the states of the Vivarais, then assembled at Annonay, to witness the first _public_ aerial ascent.  On the 5th June 1783, amidst a very large concourse of spectators, the spherical bag or balloon, consisting of different pieces of linen, merely buttoned together, was suspended from cross poles.  Two men kindled a fire under it, and kept feeding the flame with small bundles of chopped straw.  The loose bag gradually swelled, assuming a graceful form, and in the space of five minutes it was completely distended, and made such an effort to escape that eight men were required to hold it down.  \"On a signal being given the stays were slipped, and the balloon instantly rose with an accelerating motion till it reached some height, when its velocity continued uniform, and carried it to an elevation of more than a mile.  All was admiration and transport.  Amidst the shouts of unbounded applause, the progress of the artificial cloud retiring from sight arrested every eye.  It was hurried along by the wind; but its buoyant force being soon spent, it remained suspended only ten minutes, and fell gently in a vineyard at a distance of about a mile and a half from the place of its ascension.  So memorable a feat lighted up the glow of national vanity, and the two Montgolfiers were hailed and exalted by the spontaneous impulse of their fellow-citizens.\"  This event created a sensation not only in France but over the whole of Europe.  In Paris, particularly, the effect on all classes was so great that they determined to have the experiment repeated, set a subscription on foot, and appointed a scientific man named Charles, and two brothers of the name of Robert, to construct a balloon.  This they did, but instead of applying the Montgolfier motive power--heated air--they used hydrogen gas, procured by the action of diluted sulphuric acid upon iron filings.  Their balloon, which was made of thin silk, varnished with a solution of elastic gum, was a much nearer approach to the balloon of modern days than that of Montgolfier.  It was a great success; it rose and remained suspended at a height of 100 feet, in which state it was conveyed with acclamation to the Place des Victoires, where it rested and underwent some repairs.  At midnight it was conveyed in solemn procession by torchlight, and guarded by a detachment of horse, to the Champ de Mars, where, on the following day, the whole world of Paris turned out to witness another ascent.  The balloon went up to the sound of cannon, and in two minutes reached a height of 3000 feet, when it was lost for a time in a dark cloud, but speedily reappeared still higher. After a flight of fifteen miles, performed in three-quarters of an hour, it sunk to the ground in a field near Ecouen, where it was secured by the peasants.  The Parisians now appeared to become balloon-mad.  The Royal Academy of Sciences invited Joseph Montgolfier to repeat his experiments, and another balloon was prepared by him of coarse linen with a paper lining, which, however, was destroyed by incessant and violent rain before it could be tried.  Undeterred by this, another was constructed by him, which ascended from Versailles on the 19th of September 1783.  This balloon deserves peculiar notice as being the first which carried up living creatures.  A sheep, a cockerel, and a duck, were the first aeronauts!  They ascended to a height of about 1500 feet; remained suspended for a time, and descended some two miles off in perfect safety--indeed we may say in perfect comfort, for the sheep was discovered to be quietly feeding when it returned to the earth!  The practicability of ballooning being now fairly established, men soon began to venture their own persons in the frail cars.  A young and enthusiastic naturalist named Rozier leaped into the car of another of Montgolfier's balloons soon after this, and ascended in safety to an elevation of about 300 feet, but on this occasion the balloon was held down by ropes.  The ice, however, was broken, and bolder attempts quickly followed.    CHAPTER THREE.  EARLY ATTEMPTS AT AERIAL NAVIGATION.  The first free and unfettered balloon voyage was performed very soon after the event mentioned at the end of the last chapter.  It was a daring attempt, and attended with great danger.  A balloon made by Montgolfier was used.  It was 75 feet high, 45 feet wide, and spheroidal in form--heated air being the motive power.  The bold aeronauts, on this occasion, were the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21708"],["title","Up in the Clouds: Balloon Voyages (#3)"],["body"," Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes, a major of infantry.  From the gardens of the Chateau of Muetta they ascended on the 21st November 1783.  In the car there was a quantity of ballast, and a provision of straw to feed the fire.  The balloon mounted at first with a majestic steady motion, gazed at in breathless wonder by thousands of spectators, who assembled not only in the neighbourhood of the Chateau, but clustered on every point of vantage in Paris.  When the daring voyagers reached a considerable height, they took off their hats and waved them to their friends below, and the multitude-- realising, perhaps, that that which in former ages had been deemed the dream of visionaries, was at last an accomplished fact--responded with enthusiastic acclamations until the balloon passed upwards through the clouds and was lost to view.  It would seem that these first aeronauts were of different temperaments; for, after they had reached a height of nearly 3000 feet, and the earth was no longer distinguishable, the Marquis began to think that he had seen enough of the upper regions, would fain have descended, and murmured against his companion, who still kept feeding the fire. Apparently his alarm was justifiable, for Rozier continued recklessly to heap on fuel, until he almost set the balloon on fire.  On hearing some cracks from the top, and observing some holes burning in its sides, the Marquis became so alarmed that he compelled his companion to desist, and with wet sponges stopped the conflagration, which had actually begun.  When the fire diminished, however, the balloon began to descend much quicker than was safe or agreeable, and the marquis himself began to throw fresh straw on the fire to enable them to clear the roofs of Paris.  This they did very dexterously, considering that they were so unaccustomed to such navigation, throwing on just as much fuel as was sufficient for the purpose, and keeping clear of steeples and chimneys until they alighted in safety beyond the Boulevards.  Their voyage lasted about half-an-hour, and they described a track of six miles around Paris, having ascended to a height of 3000 feet.  Thus was the first balloon voyage successfully accomplished by the French; and the Montgolfiers, besides enjoying the triumph which their persevering efforts deserved, were awarded the annual prize--six hundred livres--of the Academy of Sciences.  The elder brother was invited to Court, decorated with the badge of Saint Michael, and received a patent of nobility; while the younger received a pension and a sum of forty thousand livres wherewith to prosecute his experiments with balloons.  The great success of the Montgolfier balloons naturally threw the efforts of Monsieur Charles and the brothers Robert into the shade. Nevertheless those gentlemen had got hold of a better principle than their rivals; and, knowing this, they resolved to convince the sceptical by constructing another balloon.  They wisely began by obtaining subscriptions to enable them to carry out their designs, and finally succeeded in making a globe formed of tiffany, covered with elastic varnish, which was twenty-eight feet in diameter.  This they filled with hydrogen gas.  Some idea of their difficulties and expenses may be gathered from the fact that the mere filling of the balloon required an apparatus which cost about 400 pounds sterling, one-half of which was expended on the production of the gas alone.  The ascent of this balloon deserves to be regarded with special interest, because, besides being the first _hydrogen_ balloon which carried up human beings, it was the first in which scientific observations were made and recorded.  Monsieur Charles was a lecturer on natural philosophy, and, like our own great aeronaut, Mr Glaisher, does not seem to have been content to produce merely a spectacle, but went up to the realms of ether with an intelligent and scientific eye; for we read of him recording the indications of the thermometer and barometer at different heights and under various conditions.  There were many accidents and delays in the construction of this balloon; but at last, on the 1st December 1783, it was taken to the Tuileries and there filled with gas.  The process was slow, as the gas had to be generated in large quantities by means of diluted sulphuric acid and iron filings put into wooden casks disposed round a large cistern, from which it was conveyed through water in long leaden pipes. To keep the impatient populace quiet, therefore, during the tedious operation, Montgolfier sent up one of his fire-balloons.  At last, when it was sufficiently filled, Messieurs Charles and Robert stepped into the car, which was ballasted with sandbags, and the ropes were let go.  It went up with slow and solemn motion, at the rate of about five miles an hour.  \"The car,\" writes a reporter of the day in language more inflated than the balloon itself, \"ascending amidst profound silence and admiration, allowed, in its soft and measured ascent, the bystanders to follow with their eyes and hearts two interesting men, who, like demigods, soared to the abode of the immortals, to receive the reward of intellectual progress, and carry the imperishable name of Montgolfier.  After the globe had reached the height of 2000 feet, it was no longer possible to distinguish the aerial navigators; but the coloured pennants which they waved in the air testified their safety and their tranquil feelings.  All fears were now dissipated; enthusiasm succeeded to astonishment; and every demonstration was given of joy and applause.\"  The period of flight was an hour and three-quarters, which, for those early days of the art, was a pretty long voyage.  By throwing over ballast the voyagers ascended, and by letting off gas they descended at pleasure; and they observed that during an hour, while they were exposed to the sun's rays, the gas was heated up to the temperature of fifty-five degrees of Fahrenheit's scale, which had the effect of sensibly increasing the buoyancy of the balloon.  They descended safely on the meadow of Nesle, about twenty-five miles from Paris.  But, not content with what he had accomplished, Monsieur Charles made a sudden resolve to have another flight alone.  The shades of night were falling, and the sun had already set, when the enthusiastic aeronaut re-entered the car, and, casting off the grapnels, began his solitary night voyage.  He was well rewarded.  The balloon shot up with such celerity as to reach the height of about two miles in ten minutes, and the sun rose again to him in full orb!  From his lofty station he watched it until it set again below the distant horizon.  Probably Monsieur Charles was the first man in the world, on whom the sun thus rose and set twice in the same day!  In such regions, at that romantic period of night, the aeronaut, as might have been expected, saw strange unearthly sights.  Rising vapours concealed the lower world from view, and the moon shed her pale rays on accumulated masses of clouds, casting various hues over their fantastic and changing forms.  No wonder that one thus surrounded by objects of awful grandeur and sublimity, left, as it were, more completely alone with God than any of his fellow-mortals, found it impossible to refrain from giving vent to his emotion in tears.  Monsieur Charles did not remain long at this elevation.  As the cold was excessive, and night advancing, he deemed it prudent to descend; opened the safety-valve, out of which the gas rushed like a misty vapour with a whistling noise, and, after the lapse of a little more than half an hour, alighted in safety near the wood of Tour du Lay, having travelled about nine miles.  After this, balloon ascents became frequent.  We cannot here give a particular account of each, even if it were desirable to do so, but, before passing to the consideration of the more recent voyages, we shall run over a few facts and incidents that occurred during the early period of aerial navigation.  The first lady who went up in a balloon was a Madame Thible.  She ascended from Lyons on 28th June 1784 with a Monsieur Fleurant in a fire-balloon.  This lady of Lyons mounted to the extraordinary elevation of 13,500 feet--at least so it was estimated.  The flagstaff, a pole of fourteen pounds weight, was thrown out and took seven minutes to reach the ground.  The thermometer dropped to minus 43 degrees Fahrenheit, and the voyagers felt a ringing sensation in their ears.  The first long voyage accomplished was about the same period, by a balloon constructed by Monsieur Robert, which was filled with hydrogen. It was 56 feet in height, and 36 in diameter.  The Duke de Chartres ascended in it along with Robert and two others to a considerable height, and in five hours performed a voyage of 135 miles.  This machine was furnished with a helm and four oars, for men still laboured under the erroneous belief that it was possible to direct the course of a balloon.  One of the most interesting balloon voyages of the last century was that of Monsieur Testu.  He ascended from Paris on the 18th June 1786 in a balloon of glazed tiffany, 29 feet in diameter, which was constructed by himself.  It was filled with hydrogen, and had wings as well as oars! When the aeronaut deemed it advisable to descend, he attempted to do so by using the wings.  These had little or no power, but the gradual waste of gas lowered him until he alighted safely in a corn field in the plain of Montmorency.  Here he began to collect stones without quitting the car; but while thus engaged, was seized by the proprietor of the field with a troop of peasants, who demanded indemnification for the damage alleged to have been done by him.  Poor Testu assured them that his wings being broken, he was at their mercy, whereupon the stupid and ill-natured boors seized the stay of the balloon, which floated some height above the ground, and dragged him in triumph towards their village.
