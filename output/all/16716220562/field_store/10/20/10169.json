Thus far all was well.  But there was stern work still to be done. Having ascertained that the vessel was a collier, and that none of her crew were lost, I sent the six men with an escort to the Sailors' Home, and followed the lifeboat, which was already on its way to the second wreck, not more than five hundred yards from the first.  Here they were equally successful, three men and a boy being rescued from the vessel, which also proved to be a small collier.  Then the boat was conveyed to the third wreck, which turned out to be a brig, and was nearly a mile removed from the harbour, just opposite the fishing village of Cove.  The crew of the lifeboat being now much exhausted, were obliged to give up their oars and life-belts to fresh men, who volunteered for the service in scores.  Nothing, however, would persuade John Furby to resign his position, although he was nearly worn out with fatigue and exposure.  Once more the lifeboat dashed into the sea, and once again returned with a crew of rescued men, who were immediately led up to the nearest hut, which chanced to be that of Stephen Gaff.  One of the saved men, being insensible, was carried up and laid in Stephen's bed, as I have already described.  There was still some uncertainty as to whether all those on board the wreck had been rescued, so the boat put off again, but soon returned, having found no one.  As she struck the shore a larger wave than usual overwhelmed her, and washed the coxswain overboard.  A loud cry burst from those who witnessed this, and one or two daring fellows, running into the surf up to their waists, nearly perished in their brave but vain efforts to grasp the drowning man.  Furby did not struggle.  He had been rendered insensible by the shock, and although several ropes were thrown to him, and one actually fell over him, he could make no effort to save himself, as the waves rolled him inshore and sucked him back again.  At this moment the sound of horses' hoofs was heard on the sands, and my young friend Kenneth Stuart dashed past us, at full gallop, into the sea!  Kenneth was a splendid and a fearless rider.  He kept the finest horses in the neighbourhood.  On this occasion he was mounted on a large strong chestnut, which he had trained to gallop into a foaming surf.  Checking his pace suddenly, when about knee-deep in the foam, he took up such a position that the next billow would wash the drowning man within his reach.  The wave came on.  When about a hundred yards from the spot where the young horseman stood, it fell with a prolonged roar, and the foam came sweeping in like a white wall, with the dark form of Furby tossing in the midst.  The sea rushed furiously upon horse and rider, and the terrified horse, rearing almost perpendicular, wheeled round towards the land.  At the same instant the coxswain was hurled against them. Kenneth seized the mane of his steed with one hand, and grasping Furby with the other, held on.  The noble charger, swept irresistibly landward, made frantic efforts to regain his footing, and partially succeeded before the full force of the retreating water bore back upon him.  For one moment he stood quivering with the strength of his effort. Kenneth was very strong, else he had never maintained his grasp on the collar of the coxswain.  A moment more, and the horse made a plunge forward; then a dozen hands caught him by bridle and saddle-girth, and almost dragged the trio out of the sea, while a loud cheer greeted their deliverance.  I ordered four stout men to carry the coxswain to Gaff's cottage, remaining behind for a few minutes in order to congratulate my young friend on his escape and success, as well as to see that no other wrecks had occurred in the neighbourhood.  Having satisfied myself as best I could on this latter point, I was about to proceed to the cottage when Kenneth came forward, leading his good horse by the bridle, and offered his disengaged arm to my niece.  Lizzie thanked him and declined, observing that, after his gallant and successful rescue of Furby, he must himself stand in need of assistance, or something to that effect.  I cannot say what his reply was, but I observed that she immediately afterwards took the proffered arm, and we all walked up to the hut together.  On reaching it we met Kenneth's groom coming out, he having failed, as has been shown, to make any impression on the Russians with his Turkish!  I found the place completely filled with men and women, the latter being in a state of great excitement.  \"Here's the agent! make way, lads! here comes Cap'n Bingley,\" several voices exclaimed as I entered.  Going to the bed and seeing how matters stood with poor Furby, who had been placed on his back, I ordered the people to leave the hut, and had the half-drowned man turned instantly on his face.  The other half-drowned man, having recovered, was lying on a blanket before the fire.  \"Clear the room, lads,\" said I firmly, \"the man wants fresh air; open the window, and take these wrecked men up to the Home in town. Everything is prepared for them there, hot coffee and beds, and a hearty welcome.  Away with you, now; carry those who can't walk.\"  With the assistance of Kenneth and his man the hut was soon cleared, only a few being allowed to remain to aid me in my efforts to recover the coxswain.  \"You see,\" said I, as I rolled Furby gently and continuously from his face to his side, in order to produce what I may term artificial breathing, \"it is not good to lay a half-drowned man on his back, because his tongue will fall into his throat, and prevent the very thing we want to bring about, namely, respiration.  Go to the foot of the bed, Kenneth, put your hands under the blankets, and chafe his legs with hot flannel.  Hold the smelling salts to his nose, Lizzie.  That's it, now. Mrs Gaff, put more hot bottles about him; see, he begins to breathe already.\"  As I spoke the mysterious vital spark in the man began to revive, and ere long the quivering eyelids and short fitful gasps indicated that \"Uncle John,\" as the coxswain of the lifeboat was styled by the household, had recovered.  We gave him a teaspoonful or two of hot coffee when he was able to swallow, and then prepared to take our leave.  I observed, while I was busy with Furby, that my niece took Mrs Gaff aside, and appeared to be talking to her very earnestly.  Lizzie was a lovely girl.  She was tall and slightly formed, with rich brown hair and a dark clear complexion that might have been almost styled Spanish, but for the roses which bloomed on her cheeks.  I could not help admiring the strong contrast between her and the fair face and portly figure of worthy Mrs Gaff, who listened to what she said with an air of deep respect.  Little Tottie had taken Lizzie's hand in both of hers, and was looking up in her face, and the boy Billy was gazing at her with open-mouthed admiration.  I observed, too, that Kenneth Stuart was gazing at her with such rapt attention that I had to address him several times before he heard me!  This I was not surprised at, for I remember to this day the feelings of pleasure with which I beheld my pretty niece, when, having lost her father and mother, poor dear! she came to find a home under my roof, and it was natural she should inspire admiration in a young man like Kenneth.  My family and the Stuarts had become acquainted only a few weeks before the events of which I am now writing, and this was the first time that the young people had met.  They were not altogether unknown to each other, however, for Lizzie had heard of Kenneth from the fishermen, who used to speak with interest of his horsemanship and his daring feats in rescuing drowning people from the sea during the storms that so frequently visited our coast, and Kenneth had heard of Lizzie, also from the fishermen, amongst whom she was a frequent visitor, especially when sickness entered their cots, or when the storm made their wives widows, and their little ones fatherless.  I had set my heart on seeing these two married.  My dear wife, for the first time in her life I believe, thoroughly agreed with me in this wish.  I mention the fact with unalloyed pleasure, as being what I may term a sunny memory, a bright spot, in a life of subdued though true happiness.  We neither of us suspected at that time what bitter opposition to our wishes we were to receive from Kenneth's father, who, although in many respects a good man, was very stern--unpleasantly stern.  Having done all that could be done for the wrecked people, Lizzie and I returned to our residence in Wreckumoft at about four in the morning.  Kenneth insisted on walking with us, sending his man home with his horse, which Lizzie patted on the neck, and called a noble creature.  It was quite evident that Kenneth wished that he himself was his own horse on that occasion--so evident that Lizzie blushed, and taking my arm hurriedly urged me to go home as it was \"very late.\"  \"Very early would be more correct, my dear,\" said I, \"for it is past four.  You must be tired, Lizzie; it is wrong in me to allow you to subject yourself to such storms.  Give her your arm, Kenneth.\"  \"If Miss Gordon will accept of it,\" said the youth approaching her promptly, \"I shall be--\"  \"No, thank you,\" said Lizzie, interrupting him and clinging closer to me; \"I am not in the least tired, and your assistance is quite sufficient, uncle.\"  I must confess to being surprised at this, for it was quite evident to me that Kenneth admired Lizzie, and I was pretty certain--so was my dear wife--that Lizzie admired Kenneth, although of course she never gave us the slightest hint to that effect, and it seemed to me such a good and reasonable opportunity for--well, well, I need not bore you, reader, with my wild ideas, so peculiarly adapted it would seem for the twentieth century--suffice it to say, that I _was_ surprised.  But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21702"],["title","Shifting Winds: A Tough Yarn (#5)"],["body"," truth must be told, I have always lived in a state of surprise in regard to the thoughts and actions of women, and on this particular night I was doomed to the unpleasant surprise of being received with a sharp rebuke from Mrs Bingley, who roundly asserted that she would stand this sort of thing no longer.  That she had no notion of being disturbed at such unearthly hours by the noisy advent of a disagreeably damp and cold husband, and that if I intended to continue to be an agent of the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society, she would insist upon a separate maintenance!  I was comforted, however, by finding a good fire and a hot cup of coffee in the parlour for myself and Lizzie, provided by our invaluable housekeeper, Susan Barepoles, a girl who was worthy of a better name, being an active, good-looking, cheerful lass.  She was the daughter of the skipper of one of our coal sloops, named Haco Barepoles, a man of excellent disposition, but gifted with such a superabundance of animal spirits, courage, and recklessness, that he was known in the port of Wreckumoft as Mad Haco.  Much exhausted by one of the hardest nights of toil and exposure I ever spent, I retired to my room and sought and found repose.    CHAPTER FIVE.  THE BREAKFAST PARTY AT SEASIDE VILLA.  The morning after the storm was bright and beautiful.  The breakers, indeed, were still thundering on the shore, but otherwise the sea was calm, and the sun shone into the breakfast parlour of Seaside Villa with a degree of intensity that might have warmed the heart of an oyster.  It certainly warmed the heart of the household cat, which, being an early riser, was first down-stairs, and lay at full length on the rug, enjoying at once the heat of the glowing fire which tinged its brown back with red, and the blazing sun which turned its white breast yellow.  Presently a dark cloud entered the room.  It sat on the brow of George Stuart, Esquire, of Wreckumoft, the head of the family.  Mr Stuart walked up to the fire and turned his back to it, as if to offer it a deliberate insult, while yet he accepted all the benefit it could afford him on that cold December morning.  The cat being in his way, he moved it out of his way with his foot.  He did it roughly, but he did not exactly kick it, for he was not a cruel, or naturally unkind man.  Having disposed of the cat, and looked twice at his watch, and blown his nose three times--the last twice unnecessarily--Mr Stuart rang the bell with violence.  Mrs Niven entered.  \"Why is breakfast not ready?\" said the master with asperity.  \"Breakfast _is_ ready, sir,\" replied the housekeeper with dignity.  \"Where is my sister, then, and the rest of them?\"  The questioner was partly answered by the abrupt and somewhat flurried entrance of the sister referred to.  \"What's the meaning of this, Peppy?\" demanded Mr Stuart with a frown.  \"My dear George,\" said Miss Peppy, bustling about actively, \"I really _am_ sorry, but you know things can't always be just as one would wish, and then when things _do_ turn out occasionally as one would _not_ wish, and as one had no expectation of, and, so to speak, without consulting one at all, (dear me, where _is_ that key?)--and when one can't help things turning out so, you know, it's really too much to--to--you know what I mean, brother; come now, be reasonable.\"  \"I do _not_ know what you mean, Peppy,\" (the lady's name when unabbreviated was Penelope, but as she never was so named by any one, she might as well not have had the name at all), \"and,\" continued Mr Stuart, emphatically, \"I would advise _you_ to be reasonable and explain yourself.\"  \"Dear George, how _can_ you,\" said Miss Peppy, who talked with great volubility, and who never for a moment ceased to bustle about the room in a series of indescribable, as well as unaccountable, not to say unnecessary, preparations for the morning meal, which had already been prepared to perfection by Mrs Niven; \"you surely don't forget--things do happen _so_ surprisingly at times--really, you know, I _can not_ see why we should be subjected to such surprises.  I'm quite sure that no good comes of it, and then it makes one look _so_ foolish.  Why human beings were made to be surprised so, _I_ never could understand.  No one ever sees pigs, or horses, or cows surprised, and they seem to get through life a great deal easier than we do, at all events they have less worry, and they never leave their children at their neighbour's doors and run away--what _can_ have got it?--I'm quite sure I put it there last night with the thimble and scissors.\"  Miss Peppy thrust her right hand deep into that mysterious receptacle of household miscellanies her pocket, and fingered the contents inquiringly for a few moments.  \"What are you looking for?\" inquired her brother impatiently.  \"The key of the press,\" said Miss Peppy with a look of weariness and disappointment.  \"What key is that in your left hand?\" said Mr Stuart.  \"Why, I declare, that's _it_!\" exclaimed his sister with a laugh; \"there _is_ no accounting for things.  My whole life is a series of small surprises and perplexities.  I _wonder_ what I was born for!  It seems to me so ridiculous that so serious a thing as life should be taken up with such little trifles.\"  \"What's that you say about trifles, aunt?\" asked Kenneth, who entered the room at the moment, and saluted Miss Peppy on the cheek.  \"Nothing, Kennie, nothing worth mentioning,\" (she seated herself at the table and began to pour out the tea): \"it seems that you have been saving more lives last night.\"  \"Well, yes, at least I saved _one_,\" said Kenneth, with a look of mingled pride and pleasure; \"stout John Furby, the coxswain of the new lifeboat, was knocked overboard and nearly drowned.  Bucephalus and I chanced to be near the spot at the time, so we managed to pull him out between us.\"  \"I don't like Bucephalus,\" observed Miss Peppy, stirring her tea with her egg-spoon by mistake.  \"Don't you, aunt--why?\"  \"Because he's so big and strong and fierce.  I wonder you can take pleasure in riding such a great cart-horse, Kennie.\"  Miss Peppy at this moment discovered her mistake in regard to the egg-spoon, and rectified it, observing with a look of resignation, that there _was_ no accounting for the way in which things happened in this world.  \"Don't call my Bucephalus a cart-horse, aunt,\" said Kenneth, beginning to eat languidly; \"true, he is uncommonly big and strong, but then I am unusually big too, so we're well matched; and then his limbs are as delicately turned as those of a racer; and you should see him taking a five-barred gate, aunt!--he carries me over as if I were a mere feather. Think of his swimming powers too.  John Furby is not the first man he has enabled me to drag out of the stormy sea.  Ah! he's a noble horse-- worthy of higher praise than you seem inclined to give him, believe me.\"  \"Well I'm sure I have no objection to the horse if you have none, Kennie, and it's a good thing for a beast to be able to save human lives, though why human lives should require to be saved at all is a mystery that I never could fathom; surely if men would only agree to give up going to sea altogether, and never build any more ships, there would be no more drowning, and no need of lifeboats and cork boots--or coats, I forget which--that enable them to walk on the water, or float in it, I don't remember which.  I'm sure with all that I have to remember it's no wonder--what with ridiculous little trifles to worry one, such as keys, and thimbles, and scissors, when we should be giving our minds to the solemn realities of life--and then,--as if that were not enough for any woman's shoulders,--to have a little child left at one's door.\"  \"Oh, by the way,\" interrupted Kenneth, \"I had quite forgotten the child. Mrs Niven told me about it, and I looked into the crib as I went up to bed last night, or rather this morning, and saw that it was sleeping-- somewhat restlessly I fancied.  Who brought it here?\"  Mr Stuart, who had hitherto eaten his breakfast in silence, looked at his sister as if the reply would interest him.  Before the answer could be given the door opened, and a smart handsome youth of apparently eighteen years of age entered.  His dress bespoke him a midshipman in the navy, and the hearty familiarity of his manner showed that he was on intimate terms with the family.  \"Gildart, my boy, how are you?\" cried Kenneth, springing up and shaking the youth warmly by both hands.  \"Hearty, old fellow, and happy to see my ancient chum.  How d'ye do, Miss Penelope?  How are ye, Mr Stuart?\"  My son Gildart had been Kenneth's favourite companion when they were boys at school.  They had not met for many years.  \"Sit down,\" said Kenneth, pressing his friend into a chair; \"when did you arrive; where did you come from; what brought you home?--your appearance is so unexpected!--hope you've come to stay with _us_.  Had breakfast?\"  \"Well, now, such a string of 'em to answer all at once,\" replied Gildart Bingley, laughing.  \"Suppose I try to reply in the same order--came this morning; direct from China, where we've been sinking junks and peppering pirates; got leave of absence for a few weeks to run down here and see the old folks at home; whether I stay with _you_ will depend on the treatment I receive; I have had breakfast, and came down here supposing that yours would have been over--but I'm capable of a second meal at any time; have tried a third occasionally with reasonable success.  Now, Kennie--I'm not afraid to call you by the old name, you see, although you _have_ grown so big and manly, not to say fierce--having answered your questions, will you be so good as to tell me if it's all true that I hear of your having saved the life of a fisherman last night?\"  \"It is true that I pulled him out of the sea, aided and abetted by Bucephalus, but whether all that you have heard of me is true I cannot tell, not knowing what you have heard.  Who told you of it?\"  \"Who?"]]]
